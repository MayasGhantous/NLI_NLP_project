  i managed to narrow it down from two clues . 
  my earliest saved / r/counting related comment was 189,499 and according to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3cx05e/counting_rcountings_top_600_counting_counters/ ) my first post was on 04/10/14 . 
  edit : i dug deeper and found my first post on the subreddit too !, 
  [ kakskytviis ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/22g3pd/counting_in_finnish/cgp85wd/ ) from the counting in finnish thread . 
  good finale for for the series . 
  most of the loose ends got resolved and characters got resolution . 
  i did n't check any of the commentary for the series before finishing it , and the amount of ecchan hate was supprising . 
  i was cheering for her till the end . 
  same here . 
  i played katawa shoujo while recovering from accident . 
  the game helped me to process . 
  data . 
  i think that following the patter is better than breaking it to make complete avokado left of kekkonen . 
  that 's a good plan , makes it free of mistakes . 
  i tried to count it with [ paint ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ffcrroz.jpg ) but i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  this is still possible with one other person . 
  i 've been game sharing with my brother since i got my xbox one . 
  depens on your legistlation . 
  in the eu you own the game and have right to resell it . 
  [ video evidence ] ( https://youtu.be/nunte9crzki?t=20 ) look at the finnish flag . 
  their reasoning can be found on r/videos wiki :, 
   rationale :, 
   policing is a sensitive issue on the internet , and on reddit especially . 
  this causes two problems with our pre-existing rules : firstly , videos of police harassment and abuse are often indistinguishable from political propaganda for one side or the other ; and , secondly , the public nature of their office means that the police are often trivially easy to doxx -- a term which means ` reveal the personal information of ' , typically for the purpose of witch-hunting . 
  as you 'll see from the above sections , this manages to break all three of our rules so far , and is something with which we have had huge problems in the past , leading to verbal warnings from the admins . 
   as the outrage sparked by these kinds of videos leads invariably to multiple infractions of our rules against personal information and witch-hunting -- as well , often , to the rule against videos of assault -- , we do not allow them on the subreddit . 
  there are , as the rule says , subreddits designed for the sole purpose of housing this kind of content , and , as we 'll discuss in our breakdown of rule 9 , the size of / r/videos means that we have to ensure that our content is suitable for as many of our subscribers as possible . 
  violence of any kind is difficult to reconcile alongside this requirement , and so we try to minimise it where possible for the most part . 
  still on it . 
  i also started to do avocado on http://pxls.space/, 
  it has more users than place2, 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  i did n't know that upgrading bundles was a thing . 
  after accusations of racism this film was soon pulled from eu 's official youtube channel . 
  [ the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/06/european-commission-criticised-racist-ad ) , [ time ] ( http://world.time.com/2012/03/07/is-a-new-european-union-ad-racist-controversial-video-campaign-is-pulled/ ), 
  playing my first iron man game , france 1619 with random new world . 
  i need tips for colonial management . 
  i think one of my colonial nations is getting too big . 
  [ blue in circled belongs to one colonial nation . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wcoexqw.png ) i lowered tarifs and got the liberty desire under 50 % , but i still worry . 
  * should i continue to feed land to my native vassal instead of cn ? 
  * if i conquer spanish or portuqese colonial nation will the stay independent or get absorbed into mine ? 
  * is there mapmode to see colonial regions ? 
  r5 : bug, 
  event chain a political marriage had two options : '' suggest political marriage '' or '' i 'll marry for love '' . 
  i went with political marriage one . 
  that caused my heir to sent letter to herself , and simultaneously become ruler of both france and hainault . 
  [ who am i ? 
  what year am i ? 
  how am i doing ? 
  correct !, 
  france and 1714 . 
  playing my first ironman game . 
  playing as france , year is 1765 and i just started my first eu4 succession war . 
  i 'm facing my biggest rivals commonwealt and spain . 
  i can call in my ally the ottomans . 
  how succession wars differ from normal wars and which front should i focus on ? 
  invisible war was my entry to the series . 
  i played throught it with guns blazing and it still is one of my favourite original xbox games . 
  i got human revolutions expecting more the same and was disappointed . 
  too much focus on stealt , i never finished it . 
  my first ironman game is almost done . 
  i have taken a month long break from any console gaming , but this week i might visit the iron temple and see if i could get my last achievement . 
  good but not perfect . 
  you are missing the prussian ports that sweden held between 1629-1635 . 
  from the end of [ polish -- swedish war ( 1626 -- 29 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93swedish_war_ ( 1626 % e2 % 80 % 9329 % 29 ) to [ treaty of stuhmsdorf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_stuhmsdorf ) . 
  i managed to win my war . 
   second toughest war of the whole campaing . 
  the turk was little use and in order to force pu i had to siege down half of the plc myself . 
  got 21 achievements on this run . 
  it 's easy to argue that at the time new zealand , australia and finland were n't countries either . 
  they were autonomous parts british and russian empires respectively . 
  but new zealand does n't have fixed date of independence , it was [ gradual thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_of_new_zealand ) . 
  r5 : just got the achievement `` rekindling the flames '', 
  this has been fun game . 
  started as custom nation in northern india and in first war took out rump delhi . 
  after that i got, 
  warned by timurids for 60 years and had to slow down my expansion . 
  they looked really [ scary ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t0bfvio.jpg ) at one point . 
  eventually i took full advantage from their weakness and expanded . 
  then kicked down newborn persia while they were still weak . 
  war against ming might have ended badly but luckily after i had gotten couple of victories they got declared by a coalition . 
  i got the final needed province when the ottomans attacked me and showed some really bad tactics . 
  at this point of the game my biggest threat are the russians . 
  i 'm currently defending against the second russian crusade . 
  thanks for the cloud line break down . 
  the price difference between cloud and core was only 10 $ and i was wondering which one should i pick . 
  since i 'm going use it mainly with xbox one , core sounds better choice . 
  i 'm little confused did you mean cloud core or cloud silver ? 
  from your breakdown :, 
   the cloud are for people who :, 
   c. strictly pc gamers ( splitter tends to break ), 
  anyway , i looked up prices from couple of finnish shops :, 
  hyperx cloud core 49 $, 
  hyperx cloud 59,90 $, 
  velour pads do sound good but not 30 $ good . 
  i was going to suggest same until i realised this was 360 subreddit . 
  from friends who moved to xbox one from 360 , i heard it was getting hard to find people to raid with on 360 . 
  [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dj7dobs.jpg ) is what they would be looking at .
