  i liked it . 
  althought this is one of the games where i would have liked to have alternate `` dark side '' ending . 
  trip puts slave headband on monkey and kills him if wanders few steps off course . 
  if it had been option i would have snapped her neck on the first opportunity . 
  if the player missed key element of the game it 's valid comment . 
  like people complaining about difficulty of witcher 2 because they somehow did n't accuire silver sword . 
  the game has two swords steel to use against humans and silver for monsters . 
  with only steel sword game is indeed very difficult . 
  it 's possibly to use [ globe view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xuaxq1f.png ) in risk ii . 
  thought it 's not very useful . 
   he was using the nail gun in it 's proper position to secure plywood and a nail hit a knot or something hard underneath popping the gun up towards his face with his finger still on the trigger . 
  they took a couple pictures then he casually pulled it out . 
  then there was blood .

  i quess that this map was made before [ `` the lands of ice and fire '' ] ( http://www.fantasticmaps.com/2013/03/official-world-map-of-a-song-of-ice-and-fire/ ) map set was published . 
  it mapped some more of the easter parts of essos . 
  my internet was actually down last week for couple of days and i ended playing lots of risk ii . 
  because of game sharing most of my xbox one games are online only . 
  i thought about playing euiv , but i was was unsure how offline mode would effect achievements . 
  i had n't touched risk ii for couple of years and it felt good to refress some memories . 
  i have 50 hours of play time in kings fall hard mode and 7 completions . 
  it 's usual that at least quater of my raid group is shitfaced . 
  when everyone is sober game becomes much easier . 
  i fully agree . 
  today i had some serial tickets that were about to expire and i watched both the mummy and wonder woman . 
  i thought that the mummy was much better movie . 
  i was about to fall asleep in wonder woman 's dancing in the village part . 
  the mummy had no such parts and i think that it had better , [ less predictable .

  i think ahmaned answered both of those questions . 
  while nick was watching the jennys corpse she said that by becoming seth he would have power over live and death . 
  earlier she said that chosen would not die but become living god , what that exactly meant was left open . 
  still it was stupid gamble to trust the word of the villain , but it paid off .

  i recommend checking your local library before buying this . 
  mine has four xbox one games : cities skylines , valentino rossi : the game , the lego movie videogame and lego marvel super heroes . 
  that is actually rather poor selection , but for 3 $ fee i can have any title from my finnish region delivered there . 
  that increases the number of titles to 64 . 
  completing winds of winter wo n't satisfy the fans .

  if you have trespasser dlc i regomment using [ trials ] ( http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/trials ) . 
  i originally got the base game from ea access and recently bought the game of the year edition to play the dlc content . 
  i played from where i left and to avoid tanky enemies i continued on normal difficulty . 
  in retrospect that was mistake because i played throught the descent without dying once , and it was quite boring experience . 
  then i started to do achievements that required specific trials and game become fun again . 
  after i run out interesting achievements my interest waned little bit , but when i continue the game it will likely be with few trials constantly turned on . 
  my kings fall [ stats ] ( https://raid.report/xb/peltsi ) are even more brutal than i thought . 
  16 % completion , 11 clears and average time of 7h 44min . 
  edit : i think that average should be average from succesful runs , it would give more realistic result . 
  ty , i added it into the description . 
  i believe being warlock helpped , i managed to slow down my momentum little bit . 
  now im all set for the second one !, 
  invisible war is an excellent game , certainly better than human revolutions . 
  flawless raider on destiny . 
  in it raid must be completed without anyone of your fireteam dying . 
  i did it solo on crotas end . 
  after weeks of practise finally succeeding was so satisfying .

  if someone in my clan has suggestion for better game to us play together , i 'll support it and cancel my preorder . 
  this happened to me on my first and only me2 playtrought . 
  all loyalty missions done and fully geared up for the suicide mission , then when i try to start it team just randomly leaves normandy for some reason ... 
  it 's one of the main reason why i thing me2 is the weakest of the series .

  personally i really disliked destiny 2 beta 's pvp . 
  they took the fun out destiny and turned it into shittier halo clone . 
  i started to play on tenhou few weeks ago and this was my biggest win so far . 
  here are some of my recent defeats to balace it out :, 
  us xbox has hbo ? 
  one of biggest reasons why i cancelled my hbo nordic subscribtion was the lack of app for 360/one . 
  i just binge watched from seasons 3 to current episode , and i preferred it that way . 
  stuff from books felt less repetive and plotlines were fresh on my mind . 
  thought stopping at the s07e06 feels really jarring . 
  now it feels like worst episode of the series , but if i could continue right into the next episode it 's impact would be lessened . 
  my top ten :,
