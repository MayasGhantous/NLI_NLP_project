  i recently joined / r/imaginaryflags modteam and would like to see that interesting subreddit as part of imaginarynetwork . 
  [ last results thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarynetwork/comments/1qxtjl/vote_rimaginaryflags/ ), 
  in that two issues were raised :, 
  one there was no submissions ,, 
  two whenever there would be enough content for subreddit . 
  1 . there are now dozen submissions . 
  2 . there are thousands of imaginary flags on alternatehistory.com alone . 
  plus most gaming alliances , clans and guilds have flags . 
  even on deviantart there are 333305 relevant deviations for `` flag '' . 
  running out of flags wo n't be an issue . 
  me and my brothers used to play lots of 3 humans vs computer battles in rome total war . 
  turns out this is n't possible in medieval 2 total war . 
  what about newer games ? 
  empire , shogun 2 or rome 2 ? 
  when / r/counting is n't enough . 
  feel free to comment or post things related to finnish history . 
  i do n't interpret . 
  i just like enjoying the stories .
