  you must look deeper . 
  i purchased in on release for 32 $, 
  it worked . 
  this was only wikipedia banner that i have intentionally clicked . 
  ayleid ruins were just too big and unwieldy . 
  `` citezen 's freedoms are slowly being taken away '', 
  sounds like over an overreaction . 
  you are still living in democratic western country . 
   white straight men have no idea what the fuck they 're talking about like 90 % of the time . 
  when i first saw this i deemed it to be bad troll and gave it downvote for missing the point of the tread . 
  their bait seems like an obvious troll . 
  rest of the comments look like genuine racistic opinions . 
  just remove all that steam spam . 
  i do n't want to hear about steam sales either . 
  whats the lighter spot in the creatures face ? 
  this version remains me of mass effect 2 and blood dragon armor .

  deus ex : invisible war . 
  one of my favourite games for xbox . 
  i prefer it over human revolutions . 
  it has better settings and puts less emphasis on sneaking . 
   finland is a sovereign republic . 
   the constitution of finland is established in this constitutional act . 
  the constitution shall guarantee the inviolability of human dignity and the freedom and rights of the individual and promote justice in society . 
   finland participates in international co-operation for the protection of peace and human rights and for the, 
   development of society . 
  finland is a member state of the european union ( 1112/2011 , entry into force 1.3.2012 ) . 
  ** o_o **, 
  and this is how i find out that they are changing constitution . 
  oblivions dungeons were too big and complex . 
  too easy to get lost . 
  linearity and clairvoyance have fixed that problem . 
  mass effect/eroge games, 
  if you flirt with all the girls , you can miss the one you really want . 
  steam . 
  got some bad personal experiences and i dislike the fact that even single player games force you to install that program on your computer .

  i played ps2 version of half live for 20 minutes . 
  very disappointing , have n't touched the series since, 
  then . 
  i liked invisible war much more than human revolution . 
  world was more interesting and it was n't so stealth based . 
  i saw your pictures yesterday but forgot to comment . 
  you are very pretty . 
  good thing about your scar is that it 's on side of your face . 
  does n't really break symmetry . 
  the scar hiding job is amazing . 
  if you need more karma you really should post tutorial to r/makeup . 
  being male i simply got no idea how to proceed in masking my own scar . 
  this is not my life, 
  looks like beginning of line dance .

  same happened with dragon age 2 : the exiled prince dlc . 
  i was planning to buy that game on launch . 
  changed my mind after hearing that they would cut one companion from normal edition of the game . 
  instead decided to wait till i could get whole launch game for less than 20 $ . 
  i will be doing same with mass effect 3 . 
  looking forward playing me3 in 2013 . 
  this will be awesome !, 
  np : oldies but happies, 
  schools will never close because of snow .
