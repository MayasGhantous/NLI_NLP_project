  set my goal on that as 200 books . 
  backs of the classics are even more dangerous . 
  like old man and the sea . 
  what 's the point of reading book about epic fishing trip if ending is in back cover ? 
  actually they are quite big books with huge font . 
  every book has about 300 pages . 
  you are right . 
  i remember reading book five and cursing author for writing books with so little content . 
  the book basically told how dwarf and boy walked from one city to another . 
  out of these i have read the damned trilogy and legacy of aldenata . 
  legacy had better action and the hippie aliens of damned got on my nerves , but i still think that the damned trilogy was better read . 
  btw , thanks for the tip . 
  now reading : valor confederation, 
  / r/norse and / r/asatru, 
  btw , why r/pagan does n't have sidebar links to these and other related subreddits ? 
  kalevala would be bad place to start . 
  it 's different religion , sami have their own gods . 
  request : hammer flair . 
  hotel is only non-yuri oneshot that i could name . 
  awesome story . 
  and for yuri , my favourite is maple love by otsu hiyori . 
  i bought dragon age 2 ( 10 $ ) via origin . 
  no problems so far . 
  i 've got issues with steam , so origin is my preferred digital distribution channel . 
  i follow finnish paganism . 
  i feel that it 's ancient and proper religion for finnish person . 
  christianity is invalidated because it was forced on my ancestors by blood and steel . 
  deus ex : invisible war is one of my favourite xbox titles . 
  for me human revolution was huge disappointment . 
  setting was not as interesting iw . 
  also , instead of giving player the choice action and map design felt like made for stealth . 
  fable 3 also had quite anticlimactic ending . 
  random pack of balverines was much more tougher enemy than final boss . 
  [ after beating that blind old man ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i expected true enemy show itself , but no , the game was over . 
  i like modern game music more . 
  played around 200 ps1 games , ca n't say that any of them had memorable music . 
  nowadays i actually like to listen game soundtracks . 
  one of her attacks is sticking grenade to opponent . 
  my favourite fighting game series . 
  doa5 is only game i 'm expecting this year . 
  just counted my tabs ... 
  i got none and neigbours had password protection . 
  now it 's sunday and i 'm in school to access reddit . 
  [ templar order ] ( http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/templar_order ) from dragon age games . 
  is that really supposed to apply for all free offers ? 
  i got broken sword : shadow of the templars when it was free and after the offer ended , it disappeared from my account . 
  after seeing the title i thought that this was / r/shittyaskhistory post :d, 
  i really liked faded sun trilogy . 
  they are my favourite cherryl books . 
  spam = karma, 
  ask from / r/girlsgonebitcoin, 
  i was on reddit when it happened !, 
  1 = 1 so for 6 hours you need drink 6 litres . 
  little uppdate : still got no internet at my place . 
  this week my cybernations account got deleted due inactivity . 
  i played that browser game for over 5 years . 
  edit1 :, 
  spending part of my summer at my parents place . 
  it was too easy to fall back to the old rhythm of spending most of my waking hours on the internet . 
  guess this addict ca n't do moderation ... 
  edit2 :, 
  school started again and i still do n't have internet at my place !, 
  awesome freedom . 
  light up the bonfire !, 
  average midsummer in [ finland . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/finland/comments/vl52v/midsummer_fest_2012_death_toll_and_incidents_so/ ), 
  thanks for the link . 
  works well from finland too . 
  at the beginning of the year i set my goal to 200 books . 
  today i had read 184 and decided to add another 100 to mine this year 's reading goal . 
  never read this much books in my live . 
  my internet usage was getting little out of hand so , i cut myself off the net and read books instead . 
  i like reading with goal , feels like i 'm achieving something . 
  i 'm against combining especially with monotheistic religions . 
  mixing different mythologies is also hard to me to understand . 
  but if historical rituals and practises have been lost , it 's all right to take inspiration from other pagans or different religions . 
  for example from shintoism or hinduism . 
  if you have account [ goodreads ] ( http://www.goodreads.com ) is also handy for recommendations . 
  [ reddit group ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/16435-reddit ), 
  mandarin has this too ? 
  as finnish speaker it 's good to know that there are other languages which have achieved this level of superiority . 
  completely normal . 
  in finland 77 % of population belongs to church , but only 27 % believes in christian god . 
  if someone had said curing my confirmation training that they actually believed in god , there would have been lots of weird looks and gossiping . 
  personally i always felt closer to old gods of finland , that the new one . 
  and i 'm going to fill the church resignation form at the beginning of next month . 
  keep looking and you will find the comfortable faith/world view to live with . 
  what does your degree says about mormonism ? 
  christian or not ? 
  [ 90s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90s ), 
  war at 40s were a joke !, 
  like caligula 's campaign to conquer britain . 
  he fails miserably , declares victory regardless . 
  in finland we had lecture about instant loans on first week of uni . 
  using text message to get 20 $ loan , that you need to pay pack next week as 25 $ is actually pretty shitty deal . 
  especially in you consider yearly interest . 
  tying credit score to credit card use is weird concept to me . 
  it 's punishing those who should have the best score . 
  people who use money they have earned instead of borrowed .
