  two days ago i too cut my last tie with christianity . 
  although in little less showy fashion , i just filled form in the internet and state church was left behind . 
  it felt awesome nevertheless . 
  article spoke of `` jesus question '' to me this whole concept is little weird . 
  in finland if you are n't part of the church nobody will presume that you still believe in jesus . 
  actually it 's usually the opposite : 77 % of the population belongs to the church while 27 % believes in christian god . 
  if you can stomach non-professional writing and are willing to register the [alternatehistory.com ] ( http://www.alternatehistory.com ) has what you asked .

  '' / r/games - informative content '', 
  and '' / r/truegaming - discussions only '', 
  even without tags it 's relatively easy to find meaningful content .

  interesting article about the long distance running :,

  article mentions how this is related to olympics . 
   police started taking back slums long given over to the drug trade as rio vied to host the 2014 world cup and the 2016 olympics . 
  the plan disrupted trade , and the factions began hemorrhaging money , said duarte . 
  crack seemed like the solution , and the drug flooded the market . 
  it does n't bother me . 
  games are not reality . 
  i remember playing medieval 2 total war as lithuania , and purging cristianity out of europe with sword . 
  that doens ' t mean that i 'm pro-genocide in real live . 
  restarted my studies , this season will tell if im going to be engineer or not . 
  doing bjj , getting my body into shape . 
  finally there is this nice girl , whith i ` ve gone into bar couple of times, 
  if i succeed in two of these goals i 'll be happy with my live . 
  no kids or teen classes , age limit to start training is 16 . 
  yup , i have trained in two different finnish schools both had that rule . 
  first matrix definetly , rest are more about action than philosophy . 
  i remember my first course of high scool philosophy . 
  most people had seen matrix , so we watched blade runner instead . 
  thats another good option . 
  i try to avoid posting thing in the internet that would land me in trouble in real live . 
  if my friends or family discovered my reddit username and read trough my comment history , they would get few new revelations but nothing really shocking . 
  it could be done by having finnish protagonist . 
  first part of the game would be winter war . 
  second part would be our hero feeling bitter about losing the war and voluenteering to continue fight in the ranks of ss division wiking . 
  im currently reading his book letters to lucilius and it has made both laugh and thing . 
  letter format makes reading both easy and intresting . 
  i sit at the top of the food chain and everything below me is potential nourisment . 
  i do n't see the difference between eating rabbit or a carrot . 
  other humans are on sama level as me . 
  they are really dangerous . 
  if cannibalism would be widespread , i ` d have fear for my own live . 
  thats the reason why im against eating humans . 
  i remember playing ps one game , which took place in anciend egypt .
