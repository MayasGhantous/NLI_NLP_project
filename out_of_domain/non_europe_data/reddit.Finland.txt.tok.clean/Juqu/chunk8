  you just need to reach level 60 to transcend . 
  developers have said that all chest have small chance of being empty . 
  edit : that being said there are definetly more empty chest than there should be . 
  god said : `` take this rune of power '' but when i opened the chest it was empty . 
  yeah no pvp at the moment , it 's all ai . 
  when you invade with champion it will eventually get transported to another players realm and fight him . 
  you can see recort of how well your champions have done at , crusade  crusade champions . 
  no graphical differences . 
  only difference that i know about is old 360 \u00a8 s making more noise . 
  i 've noticed that it 's `` updating content '' takes longest . 
  load times will probably lessen once game gets out of the beta . 
  i apriciate people who are willing to support the game . 
  if nobody bought souls game would go down . 
  multireddits are making my reddit experience awesome again . 
  my frontpage is good but smaller subreddits tent to get little visibility . 
  other option would be unsubscribing from the last defaulds i 'm using but there is still intresting content at / r/askreddit / r/books / r/bestof and / r/worldnews, 
  chest types do n't change . 
  edit : [ map ] ( http://ascendvault.com/page/world ), 
  i did my time in finnish army . 
  and it was one of the best times of my live i support the conscript system . 
  that depend how good you are at drawing . 
  for someone artistic who can do winning piece in ten minutes this could be good deal . 
  / r/ascend, 
  / r/ascend has more info, 
  been playing ascend : hand of kul, 
  it 's free game in beta . 
  so not exatly patient gaming . 
  but i 'm patiend only because of profit . 
  plug for / r/ascend, 
  test, 
  test 4, 
  europe should remember that : `` capabilities , not intentions are significant . '', 
  geopolitical situations can change quickly . 
  and if there are no realistic military to respond new challenges , things might end up badly . 
  this joke is ancient . 
  update : halloween level has been delayed . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.signalstudios.net/forums/announcement.php?f=19 ), 
   we are aware of the connectivity issues users have been experiencing after the update on october 25th , 2013 . 
  since then , there have been multiple instances in where users are unable to log into the game . 
   for this reason , we have decided to delay the halloween level until further notice . 
  while this decision is not  the most favorable , we would like to focus our efforts in resolving the server issues before continuing to add  more content ( this will not impact the planned title update ) . 
   thank you for your patience as we continue to make adjustments to the open beta . '', 
  too bad : /, 
  i was really looking forward for new content . 
  does calling game beta excuse shotty qc ? 
  i 've been playing [ / r / ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ascend ) ascend : hand of kul, 
  free rpg on xbox360 . 
  it was featured prominently on games with gold and got over million dowloads . 
  awesome game but riddled with constant disconnects and the lack of promised content . 
  can ^ i ^ s ^ u ^ m ^ m ^ m ^ onbots ? 
  i grow up in finnish home where [ nordic attitude ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) was taken to extreme and religion was never talked about . 
  as a kid i thought about religion and came to conclusion that there were two different religions from which i could choose mine . 
  christianity or old finnish beliefs . 
  the church was cold and grim place . 
  i felt more comfortable at sea . 
  so ahti and other old finnish gods become my religion . 
  when i went to school i was surprised that no one appeared to share my worldview . 
  any kid who openly admitted to believe in god or anything else supernatural was openly mocked by other kids . 
  i stayed quiet about my beliefs . 
  at 15 i got confirmed . 
  there were tree reason for this . 
  i did n't want to talk about religion with my family . 
  i wanted to go the week long confirmation camp with my friends . 
  i was looking forward to all those expensive confirmation gifts . 
  after moving on my own place i finally filled internet form and resigned from finnish church . 
  just got the witcher 2 : enhanced edition from library . 
  finally my tax euros are being put into good use !, 
  pros and cons :, 
  koa : reckoning, 
  + very long , lots to play, 
  - difficulty is poorly balanced , game gets too easy towards the end . 
  dragon age : origins, 
  + solid bioware quality, 
  - chararter origins do n't really matter that much . 
  modded oblivion, 
  i was trying to get laid with cute tavern keeper at cheydinhal . 
  but she wasnt warming up . 
  so i cast charm spell on her . 
  then middle of the action spell wore off and she started sreaming for help . 
  guards busted in and i tried to make run for it . 
  but i was stark naked and they easily cut me down . 
  yep ... though i got myself killed in the process . 
  thanks for reminding that this exists . 
  liquor filled candy . 
  not a problem for me . 
  videssos cycle, 
  mod relevant to this story is called friends and lovers . 
  thats the main goal gay marriage activist in finland . 
  because they already have `` registered relationship '' which in the eyes of law is exatly same as marriage . 
  only differencea being that it isnt called marriage or performed in church . 
  first chapter of ` veronica deciedes to die ' worked well as a short story . 
  i choose not to read rest of the book for couple of years . 
  witcher 2 : assassins of kings, 
  sometime ago i found myself on subreddit where users would post multireddits of their subscriptions . 
  ca n't find it again . 
  what is it called ? 
  then this is first reply to your post . 
  star wars : knights of the old republic, 
  just realised that it was released decade ago . 
  she does n't look that skinny .
