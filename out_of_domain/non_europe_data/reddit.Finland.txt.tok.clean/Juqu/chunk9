  `` during the continuation war , the finnish army discovered that the retreating soviets had scattered radio-controlled mines throughout the re-captured city of viipuri . 
  these mines were set off when a three-note chord was played on the frequency the radio was tuned to , causing three tuning forks ( of which each mine had a unique combination ) to vibrate at once . 
  once the army and yleisradio experts discovered how the mines worked , a yleisradio mobile transmitter was brought to viipuri , and [ s\u00e4kkij\u00e4rven polkka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzx1zl_svti ) was played on the same frequencies the mines used . 
  they played the song continuously from august 1941 until 2 february 1942 , about 1,500 times . 
  it had been calculated that it would take at least three months for the batteries of the mines to be empty . '',
