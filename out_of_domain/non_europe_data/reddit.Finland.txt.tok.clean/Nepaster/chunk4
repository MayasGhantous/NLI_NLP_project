  what height ? 
   i consume around 10.000 calories pr . 
  day . 
  it varies a lot , though , depending on whether i am working as an actor or to compete in the worlds strongest man or the likes .

  bake -  nise -  neko -  2nd season, 
  they only start shipping september 24th though,

  just remove a few keycaps and check the switch types ? 
  60 % looks beautiful , but the lack of keys makes me stick with full at least for now . 
  where do you live and did you need to pay any taxes etc. 
  on top of the monitor price ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  cup of tea ... heh, 
  his comment is satire . 
  anything from parallel to ass-to-grass is fine . 
  he has better recording gear, 
  it 's the baader-meinhof phenomenon, 
  it is in hd . 
  dvi = hdmi except hdmi can also carry audio , but as this monitor does n't have speakers in the first place it makes no difference . 
  guess i 'll add that they 're not exactly the same thing sans audio , but you would not get any extra benefits from using hdmi over dvi or vice-versa in this case . 
  this seems howtobasic level ... all it 's missing is the eggs, 
  if you want a really simple tool that you only need to run when you want to change the wallpapers download [ dual wallpaper ] ( http://dualmonitortool.sourceforge.net/ ), 
  you just simply run the program , insert whichever wallpapers you want to use , zoom them/move them/whatnot and then press set wallpaper and close the program , 
  also contrary to its name it allows more than just dual monitors . 
  currently using triple monitors with it . 
  if it makes you feel any better i bought a 60gb one . 
  bad ssd too , the kingston v300 one :(, 
  at least i bought it over a year ago , but i 'm still salty . 
  actually i thought that was the case , but a lot of the commenters are actually brutally honest . 
  hit ` controversial ' and find someone unattractive . 
  the sub is still pretty shit but i do n't think it 's dishonest . 
  yep !, 
  4690k @ 4.5 ghz with thermalright macho rev.a . 
  here !, 
  vodka, 
  well it 's affordable , quietly stylish and good quality . 
  also comes in various sizes ; it 's no wonder it 's popular . 
  actually vram does n't stack so it 'll still be 8gb whether you sli or not . 
  aside from what others have said so far you should drop in another $ 100 for a 250gb ssd . 
  install os + most used programs on it and then store everything else on the hdd . 
  i have a very similar heatsink that fortunately came with an extremely useful long screwdriver . 
  yours did n't come with one ? 
  i got the [ thermalright macho rev. 
  thing was a bitch to mount but is bloody efficient with cooling :d, 
  it 's not fanless , the fan is just not yet attached to it . 
  the fan is a low rpm 140mm fan though , so it 's pretty much silent . 
  are n't you running your fans straight to the molex cable though ? 
  in that case it should run at steady 12 volts , no ? 
  i really disliked how loud they were running so i just plugged them straight into mobo so i can control their speeds , now they 're always quiet for me . 
  this build should run 1440p just fine too . 
  yep . 
  i think they 're actually $ 650 now ... 
  check out this http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/2nh648/gpu_xfx_radeon_r9_295x2_64900_67900_30_mir/, 
  just curious , i hope you do n't get offended . 
  i 've heard a few people before mention they dislike the fans * not * spinning under safe ( 64 degrees celsius ) temperatures . 
  why is that ? 
  it 's not like it 's going to make the gpu degrade faster by running higher idle temps , and the complete lack of noise seems like a very good deal to me . 
  also i 'm not sure if you 're aware but you * can * make the fans start running at lower temps too if you so desire . 
  people curious about noise levels might be interested in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmivf9cma9i&amp;list=uuv3pua2rwlqi8k7tgb2oc8g ) . 
  it compares the different cards noise levels - although i do think some of the cards in test might have been bad batches ( for example the gigabyte and asus cards sound really loud under load ) . 
  maybe so they can advertise them at x price ? 
  it 's pretty bizarre yeah . 
  wow , the front io cabling is awesome , i might have to do that myself as well . 
  wonder why they did n't do that by default ( instead the cables go down the middle section ) . 
  upper circuit board is led hub , while the lower one is a fan hub . 
  it 's the grid ( non-plus ) just naked i believe . 
  it comes by default with the h440 . 
  that exclusive was for mx clears . 
  reds/browns/blues should be available . 
  seems to be ducky zero shine . 
  displayport can handle 144hz just like dvi . 
  would n't two 2-way crossfire cards become 4-way crossfire ? 
  so like , similar to 4 discrete cards in crossfire mode . 
  in that case it 's worth checking out how cards start performing when put into +3 - way sli/crossfire configs , i think linustechtips did a pretty good video about it . 
  basically the final word was that anything over 3-way card setups are n't worth going for , and even 3-way setups can have minor hiccups . 
  personally i would go for 2-way gtx 980 's right now , or at most 3-way and then keep the extra money you save for future pc components for when the current setup ca n't keep +60 fps @ 4k resolution . 
  also at this price point i suggest custom watercooling ; either do it yourself or pay someone to do it for you . 
  probably asus rog swift as it 's the most popular ( the only ? ), 
  1440p 144hz monitor, 
  i had it for a while , could n't access bios most of the time . 
  sometimes the pc booted just slow enough to get the bios popup and i could access it . 
  i 'd say if you need to access bios a lot do n't bother putting it on the fastest option . 
  obviously you can always just unplug the sata connector for the boot drive if you do need to access bios and ca n't access it by other means . 
  personally i have it off since i 'm running win7 and i need to check bios every now and then . 
  win8 can access bios from desktop i believe . 
  sleek . 
  what kind of rig are you running ? 
  gigabyte g1 , msi gaming and asus strix seem to be the best choices . 
  g1 is the most juiciest , but is quite large . 
  msi and asus cards are relatively juicy , have 0db mode and fit in more cases . 
  the high resolution image is the original ; the one in the original post is downscaled . 
  it 's actually one of the larger mini-itx cases on the market :p, 
  now something like lian li pc-tu200 builds ... 
  they are something else man . 
  oh man i had n't even heard of that case yet , so tiny . 
  has to have some kind of magic going on . 
  thanks for the links , i 'll take a look !, 
  haha yeah , that 's one of the prices you need to pay to get such a small pc :p, 
  whole milk for life .
