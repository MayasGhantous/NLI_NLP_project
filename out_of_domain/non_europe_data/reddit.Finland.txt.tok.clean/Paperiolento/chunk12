  just search the underground and you will eventually find one . 
  also try digging 2 wide tunnel down and try to find the biome that way . 
  i didi n't know that . 
  i will jsut have clothier living in snow biome for now and guide will take his room . 
  got ta love those claws . 
  what are they in game ? 
  vampire knifes ? 
  i was joking a bit with that . 
  expert mode with hardcore would be really brutal . 
  but just try to do full expert mode play trough . 
  helping to trasnport illegal imegrants, 
  i 'm concerned . 
  i think morgana can carry pretty hart atleast in the lower elos , where people ca n't dodge so well . 
  also you can save your adc from so many thresh hooks and such, 
  i believe i could eaaily climb to the rank i 'm ment to be with my current skill level , if i had someone that i can trust to be good adc . 
  one of the reasons they play few patches behind is to prevent bugs . 
  they always play on the most recent hotfix patch . 
  coming to wreck your ranked promos tomorrow, 
  what is the thing here ? 
  3 smites or something else ? 
  ca n't you go check yourself ? 
  does it realyl matter what champions you missed ? 
  please do n't use caps . 
  it 's annoing to read . 
  what do you mean by tech ? 
  you are not explaining this very well . 
  well , i ca n't now . 
  no , the client is pretty bad . 
  i 'm pretty sure i have been killed by taric 's heal . 
  this will never happen . 
  they do n't mind lane smites , as long as they are balanced . 
  also this could never work . 
  jungler gets left without smite . 
  it jsut seperates good zed 's from bad ones . 
  i do n't think you understand what balanced means . 
  if it is better than other options , then it is n't balanced . 
  would n't it take longer to start the game then , tough ? 
  i wont comment on the gameplay aspect , becuase i have no idea how good of a play that was . 
  i like the editing syncing with the music , but it 's just a ^ bit too flashy . 
  leaving those bubble things out would make it better . 
  this motherfucker . 
  ^ ^ uuu !, 
  ^ ^ such ^ ^ ms ^ ^ ^ paint ^ ^ skills, 
  necessary question . 
  do you play cho'gath ? 
  this is known bug . 
  happens sometimes . 
  this is a shit post . 
  not really contributing anything . 
  why ? 
  or is this just a shit post stating an opinion ? 
  because you are chat restricted ? 
  ok , fine get your personal data . 
  just the : `` all comments on my other 2 post are upvoted '' makes it sound like karma whoring . 
  yes , but silver 2, 
  i just dislike his passive , not much else . 
  you really do n't understand . 
  if smite mid lane is a must have , then it is not balanced . 
  as simple as that . 
  i kinda feel bad for laughing at that . 
  simple thing to fix this issue : remove runes all together . 
  see ? 
  now all is better in the world . 
  only 2 supports and i already got free skin for leona from riot = /, 
  go ad sona mid with new warrior enchantment . 
  edit : oh i 'm missing a / s, 
  or never . 
  lol, 
  gold 1, 
  gold v, 
  that song tough, 
  no idea . 
  now i see that . 
  that would actually be really cool . 
  an actual reason to buy chroma packs . 
  he does n't see it . 
  ssw fucking thresh with his smiley face on the hat . 
  still there are champions with sunfire and mobis . 
  sad day for me . 
  what did we learn ? 
  do n't play trundle support . 
  i mean recomended items . 
  i didi n't notice that . 
  square . 
  then , one day , her parents die . 
  what then ? 
  really if they have questions , they google . 
  there are lots of good sites . 
  i would argue on internet one . 
  it 's easy to find good information that is reliable if you are not stupid . 
  `` something in german '', 
  - albert einstein, 
  yes . 
  i didi n't . 
  started really playing ranked seriously in season 5, 
  i was on mobile too . 
  now i see it when i 'm on computer . 
  or just the later ** is ** and the first ** no **, 
  how about do n't get discoureged about not doing aswell against real people as against bots ? 
  just play one bot game with champions when you try them for the first time and then take them to normals .
