  there are some branches of the cleric tree that have proven to still be relevant . 
  one perk , which has been said to perhaps be too op , allows clerics to send their followers on surprise raids to other servers . 
  but they came from the sea, 
  high sparrow is actually melissandra , who is six years old ? 
  could lower pain treshold cause higher pain tolerance ? 
  i 'm paranoid . 
  i did 6 and also covered the tunnels with hay and bricks to avoid it spreading through vines . 
  thought bubles ? 
  so that the characters do n't talk to themselves, 
  also it does n't feel too long of a time, 
  because she is underage ? 
  i would imagine that is the case . 
  children basicly being the property of their parents for 18 years is a cause of a lot of bullshit, 
  this * definetly * is n't the right place to post it, 
  atleast that had some thought but into it , but i 'm not even sure that this one was n't made with ms paint . 
  that fits way too well, 
  it should be a dinosaur , because who would n't want a rapid fire dinosaur gunning you down from a mile away !, 
  does healing him grant assist for the tire kill ? 
  and does healing the tire grant assist for the kill ? 
  i love junkrat 's lshift , because it can get you away from so many places . 
  mei ulted ? 
  lshift + m2 and let the bombs rain from above . 
  put one in the health pack . 
  they wo n't expect it . 
  life is more than ones and tires, 
  true tire is without form, 
  `` you have sight , but yet you still ca n't find the path to harmony '', 
  `` they see us , but they still have to learn to understand '', 
  `` they have sight of us , yet they are still blind '', 
  junkrat is amazing , yet i choose torture myself with playing zenyatta . 
  i guess i 'm crazy after all . 
  life is more than just tires and zeros, 
  only thing i 'll ever play with a controller are fighting games ( and maybe some platformers ) . 
  for pretty much everything else , keyboard and mouse are superior, 
  just throwing some ideas out there , what if zen gains a speed bonus when one of his orbs is out , and an additional speed bonus when both of his orbs are out there ? 
  that could be too much tough , since you will have both of them out pretty much always . 
  another way could be rewarding zenyatta for landing his orbs of destruction . 
  maybe so that everytime you hit an enemy , you gain increased movement speed for a short duration . 
  that would keep his skill cap high , while giving him a little bit better chance at winning in 1 vs 1 by dodging his opponents attacks . 
  the bare minimum would be to give him bonus movementspeed while trancended . 
  i often use the ult to safe myself from a sure death , even if no teammates are around . 
  if it had a bit of bonus speed , i could reach my teammates . 
  bottom line is that zen needs some love in form of movement speed . 
  when your orb is n't on anyone , you have regen ? 
  but i think that should only work on his hp though , since your shield regenerates anyways . 
  i just hate having to take health kits while i 'm missing a small sliver of hp , which i need because i have so little anyways . 
  inb4 symmetra comes spamming shield and no one dies . 
  he has the lowest hp , with 50 and also lowest total of 150 shared with tracer . 
  tracer has her speed and blinks to dodge damage . 
  zenyatta has . . an invunerability . 
  in his ultimate . 
  i really do n't see the reason he has to be so squishy, 
  i feel like what makes zen so hard are actually his orbs of destruction . 
  they deal considerable damage to discorded enemies , but they are hard to land . 
  also i would like to know what your weapon accuracy is with zenyatta , since you main him . 
  i should probably make some kind of `` quiz '' to see what kind of a weapon accuracy people have with their `` main '' heroes ... 
  and i do n't think they would have seen homer as mommy, 
  btw i 'm still waiting for the people who were against that to do things they said they would , if gay mariage was going to be legal . 
  if i recall , one man said that he 'll burn himself . 
  america , where you can earn money and be famous for a while by being a horrible person, 
  i think it is trying to make a joke, 
  i tagged you : `` came while shitting a massive turd '', 
  so now ser pounce is targaryen , azor ahai , heir to the iron throne * and * the puss in boots ? 
  that 's one scary kitten, 
  thank you , ser . 
  just to make sure i now have / u/goboomyay tagged as the leader of / r/overwatch department of illuminati, 
  i do n't question reddit . 
  i deny it 's existance . 
  all is lie, 
  if we make dank memes danker , would n't the level of dank be over 9000 ? 
  widowmeicree ? 
  umm ... yes we can !, 
  we were born from salt of the onlywatch , but now our watch has ended and we do n't need to onlywatch anymore . 
  but we shall not get rid of the salt !, 
  it fuels us !, 
  it feeds us !, 
  it makes us stronger !, 
  we waited so long for this game , but now we hate every character in it , because that is what we do in / r/overwatch !, 
  what is salt may never die !, 
  what is salt mei never die !, 
  what is dank mei never melt, 
  sometimes i feel like zenyattas orbs curve * away * from the target, 
  i 'm ** zenyatta ** , you are ** anyone ** . 
  if you want an orb , stop running circles around me so i can actually target you , also you do n't have to come close , it 's actually easier for me to hit you when you are bit further away . 
  and stay in my field of view , so you keep the orb on you . 
  i 'm ** trancended zenyatta ** , you are a ** anyone expect a sniper or a support ** . 
  follow me if i ult and run to the point . 
  zenyatta ult is great for rushing the control point or the payload , because it both heals you and distracts the enemies with the large effect . 
  only time that is usefull when you are behind me and i do n't notice you . 
  when ever i try to switch to her gun , it automaticly swaps back to hear staff . 
  same with torbj\u00f6rn . 
  it 's really annoying . 
  tried it , but keeps doing it ... decided to bind 1 and 2 to voice commands instead . 
  whenever i try to open lootboxes between games , it says that i have to leave my current game . 
  could be , because they really do n't want to put effort in dubbing all the movies in finnish/swedish/norwegian / danish/etc . 
  but dubbing to languages that are spoken in multiple/high population countries is pretty efficient i assume . 
  let 's simplify . 
  we love it when zarya says anything . 
  absolutely anything . 
   the other parts of scandinavia,
