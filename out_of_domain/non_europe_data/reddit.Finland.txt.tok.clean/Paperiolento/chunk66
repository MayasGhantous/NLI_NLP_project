  this is physically hurting me !, 
  when ever i hear anyone saying that you should build damage on support morgana it 's like fingernails on a chalkboard . 
  do i count ? 
  i 'm 1/2 a support main, 
  i 'm for sale !, 
  i 'm probably crazy but that sounds like a finnish accent to me . 
  source : i 'm finnish, 
  or leona vs braum pong . 
  nobody plays tankali anymore . 
  i do not understand how anyone ever thought that was a good pick . 
  i played it quite a lot and only won a single game with it . 
  building damage on support morgana is just not worth it . 
  sure she has nice ratios , but you are n't going to get enough ap to make them worth it . 
  she does a lot better with utility item build in my experience . 
  she can place it in the walls i believe , but it 's still visible . 
  anivia is the most op champion now . 
  closest thing to ` will ' in finnish is ` aion ' which is closer to ` intend to ' than ` will ', 
  when talking about the future we pretty much have to ad a future time like ` tomorrow ' or ` next week ', 
  in finnish `` i love you '' translates to `` min\u00e4 rakastan sinua '', 
  rakastan = love ( specificly when talking in first person ), 
  sinua = you, 
  though in conversational finnish it 's convinient to just leave out the pronoun and just say `` rakastan sinua '' , because the pronoun is included in the verb , you ca n't take away the word `` sinua '' . 
  if you did , then it would just be `` i love '', 
  `` aion '' is perhaps more like `` i intend '' ( aion uncludes the pronoun . 
  `` intend '' by itself translates to `` aikoa '', 
  i guess you could call that a sort of an future tense , but that really is the closest thing you 'll get to a future tense in finnish . 
  that 's a bit of a clunky sentence , but that is the straight translation . 
  if i were to make it sound like an actual thing someone would say , i would drop the word for `` you '' :, 
  to make it even better i 'll add `` do so '', 
  there . 
  and ** yes i will **, 
  closest translation i can think of . 
  pretty much equivalent, 
  i would write here my amazing sarcastical story about finnish history , and how we are posessed by demons and saunas are swedish torture devices , but i 'm too tired now . 
  i need to add that finnish language is n't actually even a language to it though . 
  we care about our future ? 
  i ca n't imagine what the rest of the world is like then . 
  i think the word we should look at is * aikoa * . 
  it changes to * aion * when talking in first person , and to * aiot * when talking in second person . 
  * aikoa * is a verb , which can really be translated to * plan to * , * intend to * or * will * , but not to * going to * , because you are not sure if it is going to happen, 
  the last one directly translates to * yes , i will * ( or * intend to * or * am going to *, 
  it works because when talking about the future , you take the present form and a future time , let 's use * tomorrow i will eat *, 
  quick translation of the words, 
  tomorrow = huomenna, 
  will = aikoa ( but because it 's in first person , it 's actually aion ), 
  and here is the same in english with all the words in the same place :, 
  ** i will eat tomorrow **, 
  but the word * aikoa * only works when you are only planning to do so . 
  if there is * going to * you ca n't use * aikoa * . 
  let 's use ** it is going to blow up * as an example :, 
  again quick translations :, 
  it = se, 
  is = on ( this translation is n't important because we wo n't use it ), 
  going to = there is no translation, 
  direct translation with word in the same place :, 
  ** it blows up **, 
  so when saying that , * it * can blow up now , in 5 minutes , soon , tomorrow , in a year etc. 
  that 's why the equivalent of future tense is created by adding an implication of time in the end :, 
  ** it blows up soon **, 
  i hope this clears it out . 
  sorry if this is a bit confusing . 
  it 's really late here . 
  you can just say ** my\u00f6hemmin ** = ** later **, 
  direct translation with the words in the same order, 
  ** i go to the shower later **, 
  to be more clear , * aikoa * is a verb which roughly means * intend to * or * plan to *, 
  it can be used in the place of * will * , * intend to * , * plan to * etc , but not in the place of * going to * , because that means that you know it is going to happen . 
  that 's where there 's a blank in translation, 
  i bet there are lot of people just peeking out of the closet , yet too scared to fully exit . 
  pull them out . 
  it will most likely be good for them ( do n't do it in front of other people , they might not be ready to tell everyone right away , even if it is obivous ), 
  i was one of those and no one pulled me out , even though i was silently screaming for it . 
  do them a favour . 
  `` i am going to the store '' would translate to :, 
  that means you are currently going to the store, 
  more common way of saying that is :, 
  i go to the store, 
  weather or not you are talking about the future largely depends on the context . 
  your username is too relevant, 
  also here . 
  i have no idea wtf is this sub . 
  how exactly would that benefit anyone ? 
  artist of any kind would be doomed , because they would n't own any of their work anymore . 
  zyra main here, 
  mage supports are played for their pressure in lane . 
  their point is to haras , poke and kill you . 
  but like most mages , they are squishy and vunerable to lot of supports who can get the jump on them . 
  this is one of the main reasons i find champions like blitz or thresh to be pretty hard match-ups , because you can lose lane by making a simple misspositionion . 
  so try and punish them for over extending and dodge their spells whenever possible . 
  i do n't have time to watch esports , but what are the mid laners currently played ? 
  i 'm just wondering how likely zyra mid would be , in terms of match-ups, 
  yeah it does n't work in that case . 
  * i rather take coffee than tea *, 
  but passion does n't pay bills . 
  i would love to be able to live in a world , where people could focus on their passions , without a worry about having money to live , but that just is n't realistic right now . 
  there are artist who do it , because it is their passion , but they also make money from it . 
  this , in my opinion , is ideal . 
  i hate the shit that the music industry throws at us . 
  it 's engineered to produce money . 
  wait .
