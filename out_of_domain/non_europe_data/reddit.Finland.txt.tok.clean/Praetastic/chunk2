  if you have choppers on your tail you want to get rid of , go to the wind farm . 
  those wind turbines eat helicopters for lunch . 
  i learned that the hard way . 
  what 's the difference between a ferrari and a dead five year old girl ? 
  i do n't have a ferrari in my garage . 
  edit : formatting, 
  alright , i 'm down . 
  i tend to start skipping both the op and ed once i 'm a couple episodes into the show . 
  actually , he used a fruit . 
  a shame it was co-op on the same screen , not split screen though ... 
  still was lots and lots of fun . 
  purple with a black stripe . 
  what i 'd like to know is if you can use a cargo bob to lift another cargo bob ... 
  a shame maiko did n't turn out to actually be a guy , since the head of trap development being a trap would 've been hilarious . 
  although i guess it 's still possible ... ? 
  log horizon is a currently airing show you might like . 
  the general idea is the same as sao 's , people stuck in an mmo , but it 's not as dark and there 's no permadeath involved . 
  i wonder how many levels serara jumped up for finishing off the monk ? 
  a level 19 killing a level 90 , that 's got ta be loads of xp ( although she had a lot of help ) . 
  well , this explains why the homeroom teacher is stripping down all the time . 
  power ups !, 
  that reminds me a lot of [ this square ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/helsinki_lutheran_cathedral_and_senate_square_from_air_1934.jpg ) in my hometown , just without the church . 
  homu runner , that sounds more like a homestar runner and madoka crossover ... and now i want to see someone do that . 
  nicely done . 
  for a second i thought it was a sped up . gif of a wax sculpture melting or something . 
  if you ask me , game developers should seriously be taking notes from avalanche regarding open world games . 
  jc2 was a really nice piece of work ... dat view distance , for example . 
  mirror 's edge induced vomiting ? 
  i do n't think they could give an answer to everything even if they wanted to , 3.0 raised way too many questions as is , not to mention all the stuff from 2.0 that might still need explaining . 
  no way they could manage all of that in just two hours without the movie becoming a convoluted mess . 
  though giving conclusive answers has never been a habit of nge anyway , so it 's to be expected . 
  trust me , you 're going to need that if you want to have a chance of landing in your garage after flying down the street at 400 mph . 
  well , ultimately a cyborg is , by definition , something living that has both organic and artificial parts . 
  so , someone with a pacemaker or an insulin pump could be considered a cyborg . 
  it 's not necessarily always something as awesome as a completely cybernetic body , but like darlantan said , it has to begin somewhere . 
  and personally i do consider it quite awesome that we 've come as far as this when it comes to integrating technology into humans that actually works . 
  the future is a pretty sneaky bastard . 
  i think that it 's related to the mural stuff on mount chiliad . 
  supposedly there 's a weird radio broadcast that plays ( even if your radio is off ) if you go to that spot on the map at a specific time . 
  so the activity is probably from people going there to check it out , and when you have a lot of players in a small area , well ... you know what happens . 
  anyway , / r/chiliadmystery might have more info on this if you want to know more , i have n't been following the gtav mysteries related stuff for a long while now . 
  the same umbrellas that were all over the place in blade runner . 
  not sure if what i do exactly counts as sleepwalking , since i 'm sort of half-awake and remember what i did , but it 's all a bit hazy . 
  i also tend to snap out of it most of the time . 
  anyway , once i started hitting a friend with a pillow who was sleeping in the same room before going back to sleep like nothing happened . 
  though apparently i did n't hit him that hard since all he could really remember was me standing over him and doing something weird . 
  another time i managed to remove the lamp from my ceiling ... woke up to find it on my desk . 
  me too , i 've always wanted to work in a place that makes me feel like the ceo of an evil corporation . 
  though in reality it 's probably just maintenance space for ac , elevators or something similar , not intended for office use . 
  poor yuuka , she 's just trying to be a retro gamer and all she gets is the misunderstanding of the decade . 
  ** ops **, 
  * [ welcome to nhk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcgr3dj5mqy ) my fridge told me i should include this song, 
  * [ gits : sac ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-f7cak3ly ) i 'm a huge fan of this one , but the opening animation that goes with it ... eh , not so much . 
  * [ database database ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfi6ejdqzzg ) a major ear worm , this one , but in a good way . 
  * [ rumba rumba rumba ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkbcc5qz7e4 ) never actually seen the anime itself , but the op alone makes me want to . 
  oh well , another one for the backlog !, 
  ** eds **, 
  * [ flcl ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zm3eawu6ge ) i do n't think i can ever get enough of this one . 
  * [ gits : sac ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xesrejjgx-i ), 
  * [ gits : sac 2nd gig ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp9x7bchcps ), 
  coppelion also had both a really good [ op ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dewbbxydccs ) and [ ed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uauj-bntww ) , though that was pretty much all i liked about the show , unfortunately . 
  gameplay and story segregation , man . 
  we need more nonon art . 
  actually , scratch that , we need more klk art in general . 
  but more of nonon especially . 
  definitely interested in something like this . 
  i 've got some tabletop rpg experience , mainly from dd ( 3.5 and pathfinder ) and wh40k ( rogue trader ) . 
  i also have some ideas for potential general scifi/cyberpunk campaigns , though my gming experience so far is zero , so i 'm not sure how well i 'd fare to be honest . 
  unless my memory is fucking with me , was n't the game set in autumn ? 
  this image looks more like spring or summer to me . 
  now remember , do n't drop the soap ... because someone might die if it lands on top of them . 
  as of right now , a tiltshifted image of [ messier 106 . 
  it 's even more hilarious when it 's not the players getting critical fails ... just a while back , our gm threw a huge cave spider at us in our session . 
  he 'd intended for it to be pretty tough , but the dice gods had other things in mind ... 
  so the spider critically failed pretty much every roll it possibly could . 
  it tripped twice . 
  a monster with eight friggin ' legs tripped twice !, 
  it failed to land even a single attack , only managed to shoot some web once . 
  that was the most anti-climatic boss fight i 'd ever seen . 
  are you in the us , europe or somewhere else ? 
  crap , so it 's region locked then i 'm guessing ? 
  kill you ? 
  all they want is to give you hugs !, 
  do n't run away !, 
  they 're actually going to start airing pupa ? 
  i was so sure no network would touch that show with a ten feet pole after hearing about the premise . 
  gon na continue watching kill la kill and log horizon , i 'm a couple episodes behind on the latter though , so i have some catching up to do . 
  not that many must-sees for me in winter season other than space dandy and chuunibyou 2nd season , though i 'm probably gon na do some random sampling to see if there 's something good that was n't obvious at first glance . 
  other than that , my anime backlog 's getting no smaller , that 's for sure . 
  there 's so much stuff on my hdd waiting for me to watch it , but as of right now i 'm actively working my way through fma brotherhood , bakemonogatari and the index series ( possibly followed by railgun if i like it enough , been kinda eh so far to be honest ) . 
  what , you do n't like tang ? 
  what kind of person does n't like the refreshing orange flavor that is tang ? 
  i 'm pretty sure this has to be from a mod , no way bethesda would include something like baby eating in their game . 
   it 's japan . 
  well , that 's true , though i imagined that brother sister cannibalism with incest undertones would be a bit too much even for them . 
  yeah , i 'm definitely gon na steal this idea too . 
  well , they could be tigers instead . 
  eh , really ? 
  i 've never been killed by a cassawary while playing the game . 
  you can pretty easily put them down even with a pistol .
