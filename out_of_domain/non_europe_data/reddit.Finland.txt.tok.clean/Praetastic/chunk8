  the censoring was one of the reasons i stopped watching and started reading the manga instead . 
  `` video games ca n't be art , '' yeah i think we 've heard this stuff before ... 
   psycho-pass s2 , log horizon s2 , parasyte , fate/stay night, 
  oh my god , so much stuff to watch next season , i 'm gon na be buried ... 
   ronia the robber 's daughter, 
  well , color me surprised on this one , though i probably should n't , considering the fascination japanese have with anything nordic apparently ( what is it about us that interests you so , dang it ? ) . 
  the nostalgia values alone make this a must-watch for me . 
  they 're going to have to work pretty hard since [ ending spoilers ] ( / s `` they just went and offed makishima at the end , and he was a pretty damn compelling villain . 
  i 'd imagine kougami will take his place . '' ), 
  that 's going to be pretty tricky to top , but i hope urobutchi & co can pull it off . 
  shiiit , why do you do this to me , japan ? 
  and of all the studios , it 's ghibli . 
  or there 's no bomb and it 's just a plain ol' trap . 
  airport chess ? 
  now that 's just contrived as fuck . 
  i do n't like where this show is headed now ... 
  i suppose you could use the 40k dh and rt crit tables as a reference , they have page after page of descriptions for damage to body parts , ranging from fairly gruesome to complete existential failure . 
  really good stuff . 
  romance ? 
  ai n't gon na happen . 
  sure , but remember that they still had very primitive weapons . 
  the usefulness of the log trap vs. an at-st or the clothesline vs. the hover bikes i could still believe , but taking down armored soldiers with bows and spears is really stretching it in my opinion . 
  commie . 
  they pretty much get off on doing [ shit like this . 
  that and shaft . 
  what plot holes ? 
  we do n't even know if the lh characters ' physical bodies even exist in the real world anymore . 
  no , it 's merely an as of yet unexplained plot ** point ** right now . 
  just because something is n't explained immediately does n't make it a plot hole . 
  now , if it was either a. never touched upon in any way over the course of the entire series , or b. explained , but in a way that made no sense in the series ' context , then you could call it a plot hole . 
  seems that the sign to the right forbids sleeping on the benches or something to that effect , he 's just taking advantage of the loopholes . 
  it 's [ this park ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gbum98k.png ) near the bottom of the panorama . 
  it 's a bit of a love-hate relationship . 
  he gets shit done , but has the emotional capacity of a cardboard box . 
  i prefer slaine to be honest . 
  it 's actually surprisingly easy to dox someone by using a picture like that , since you can look at the picture 's exif data , which on smart phones sometimes includes the gps coordinates of the location where the image was taken . 
  it 's a good watch , though they went anime original with the ending so it fell a bit flat on its face near the end . 
  still a solid 8/10 series . 
  using a rocket to send something into orbit has an insane cost per pound , and you ca n't reuse rockets , so it most likely would be . 
  and seven days is a perfectly acceptable drawback when your other option is something that can blow up on the launch pad or in mid-air . 
  or just map crouch to c. 
  i regret nothi -- aaaaarghhhh, 
  fortunately i do n't play cs . 
  well , there 's that episode where they defeat the angel with the power of synchronized dancing so ... close enough ? 
  and then there 's the philosophist , standing so far to the right he ca n't see any of the others . 
  not that he cares though , he 's too busy chasing butterflies . 
   likes : mom 's homemade food , ** bridges **, 
  wait as second , bridges ? 
  is this guy an architecture otaku or something ? 
  she sure does look a lot like a [ certain someone ... ] ( http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/241789.jpg ), 
  heavy light machine gun ? 
  they do n't , the arms are just pointing in a different direction in each panel . 
   given that the confusion , stress , and fear the martians wield is so much more dangerous then their space-age technology , a person who rarely gets stressed would probably fare a lot better then his peers . 
  assuming you mean inaho here , i do n't really have a problem with him being a good tactician or anything . 
  it 's just that the reasons why he 's good are never really explained , aka his lack of emotion , we just get inko claiming that she can tell when he 's happy or sad . 
  so without any of that characterization , he 's pretty boring . 
  plus he does do stupid shit , like [ spoiler ] ( / s `` going full retard by pulling his gun on slaine in the last episode and getting shot for it . '' ), 
  as for characters acting like idiots , what 's your take on the vers emperor , since he pretty much takes the cake on the `` wait , what ? '', 
  train . 
  first he 's calling for a ceasefire , then he wants all terrans dead . 
  i mean , did he want to commit genocide to begin with and was only pretending to care , but if so , why go to so much trouble ? 
   this is the kind of issue that should have come up with the first two borderlands when the complaint was slightly valid ( sirens are the only females and the only healers ) . 
  eh , not really . 
  in bl1 , roland has a skill tree called `` medic , '' which does exactly that . 
  maya is the only one in 2 who can be specced for healing though . 
  still , not as valid critiscism as you 'd think imo . 
  never really played bl1 online myself , so i ca n't really say , though i 'd imagine that the damage upgrades from the other two trees would be more desirable . 
  then just throw a couple points into aid station and that 'd probably be enough as far as healing the team goes . 
  mal has him listed as `` creator ( story ) '' for the first season , though i 'm not entirely sure what to make of it since he did the script for only the three episodes . 
  9 pm here . 
  shit 's terrible , yo . 
  hand-drawn animation is actually one of the most expensive media to make a movie in from what i understand , though they 've probably used cgi and other tricks to cut down the costs . 
  the tunnel seems to continue off to the right , so i 'm assuming there 's an elevator or hangar doors there . 
  until they become illegal because they `` interfere '' with police operations , anyway . 
  happens a lot with anime adaptations of manga and light novels . 
  you sure you posted this to the right subreddit ? 
  / r/finland is the one in english . 
  yeah , this is not gon na happen . 
  and even if they really wanted that , finland would most likely refuse , since actually getting the area up to our standards would cost too much . 
  to me , all of those seem like terrible options . 
  mouseover gives `` the devil ( devil 's train '' . 
  no idea what that 's supposed to mean , exactly . 
  is that a station inside the building , or does it just pass through ? 
  would be pretty awesome to have a train station just outside the door to my apartment . 
  i like how they used the laughing man logo as a censor in the trailer video . 
  i really like this , though the sw portion looks kind of empty , with just ocean . 
  if you made the island chain in the east to stretch all the way to the west , then it 'd be pretty much perfect . 
  it really irks me that he 's trying to use evangelion as evidence for his argument , especially when the scene in the image he included was in no way intended as fanservice ( if anything , it was ** anti ** - fanservice ) , and actually served a purpose in terms of plot . 
  i hope that 's really not the case . 
  it 's gon na feel awkward flying when you do n't have full control over the ship . 
  been to the shop in question , and as far as i remember , they did n't sell a lot of comics ... 
  mainly games , miniatures , figures , mtg , movies and so on . 
  also had some interesting stuff for collectors , like a pulse rifle scale replica and an actual tie-fighter pilot costume used in the movies . 
  plus it 's a pretty old image , since that place does n't even exist anymore . 
  a shame , really . 
  it is n't . 
  the movie takes place after s2 . 
  well , that 's nice and all , except that the ussr stopped existing in 1991 , so i 'm not sure how this by itself could entitle russia to crimea in any way , unless you engaged in some major mental gymnastics . 
  interesting . 
  though it still makes me wonder how much legitimacy the claim would actually have , since right now it 's just coming across as insane troll logic to me honestly , not to mention too convenient .
