  and there probably are n't that many other cases from history that could be compared to this to get some idea . 
  does n't work that well for slow acting poisons though . 
  then we 'll just brrrrt it to death with a minigun or two . 
  the problem with this is that invisibility cloaks are literally fucking magic . 
  they laugh in the face of muggle science . 
  it 's the wizards man , they do n't want you to know the * truth * . 
  needs more thunder thighs . 
  looks like that kid is going to become [ this guy ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/borderlands/images/1/17/badass_psycho.png ) when he grows up . 
  yeah , i 've noticed this too ( especially with manga ) , though it also makes me wonder what the japanese to spanish translation quality is like when they churn out stuff at that pace . 
  saitama , so good he 's on the list twice . 
  video is not working ? 
  it 's a pretty terrible idea if you do n't take the correct precautions , like running whatever 's on the stick through a vm on your computer first . 
  solo has a guaranteed drop the first time you play it after the update . 
  that 's how i got my first and so far only item . 
  someone please correct me if i 'm wrong , but did the first order just casually [ spoilers ] ( / s `` blow up coruscant with the starkiller station ? 
  that 's at least what i 'm assuming , since they wanted to strike against the republic , and one of the planets that exploded looked very much like coruscant . 
  if so , that was one hell of an underwhelming reaction all around to hundreds of billions getting killed . '' ), 
  makes sense i suppose , then again why did leia react to that specifically , while nothing seemed to happen when all those planets got obliterated by starkiller base ? 
  anyway , if i had to guess , rey is probably luke 's daughter , or at the very least closely related . 
   voting is working exactly as intended . 
  if you take a look at reddiquette , then no , not really . 
   what is a `` constructive discussion '' about star wars , exactly ? 
  one that results in less back patting and circlejerking , i 'd imagine . 
  contrary opinions have their place , unless you want to build an echo chamber . 
   nobody is being suppressed . 
  you made this post , did n't you ? 
  and nobody stopped you ? 
  so no suppression . 
  if the mods were actively trying to prevent people from posting certain things those would apply , but that 's obviously not the case , and no one said it was . 
   people downvote things they do n't like or think are stupid . 
  and that is the problem . 
   you 're not entitled to upvotes because you 're going against the grain . 
  i do n't think anyone was asking for upvotes , just for people to stop downvoting things solely because they do n't like them . 
   nobody is forced to respect your opinion . 
  true , but hiding things you do n't like wo n't do much good to you . 
  because that 's what downvoting is . 
  [ that pout ] ( http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/5ceecb436d9e492775b2a68ba12d6a7f1451944470_full.jpg ) is just too cute . 
  proxies or vpns . 
  though there 's also safety in numbers , considering the millions of p2p connections going on at any given time . 
  from what i know , the only guaranteed deathclaw you 're going to run into in the glowing sea when the quest to go there comes up is the one outside the place you go to at the end . 
  and even that one 's sleeping so you can just sneak around it . 
  noihin muihin heitt\u00e4isin itse viel\u00e4 jatkoksi dance with the deadin , erityisesti [ out of body ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8egyvs7jun8 ) ja [ near dark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25r9gl6fwc ) levyt .

  i can already see where this is going ... 
  roll 1d20 to fjord the river . 
  me2 sets the stage for a me3 that ended up not existing because bw changed me3 's plot . 
  from what i understand , drew karpyshyn wrote the plot for me1 and 2 , and his plan was to involve dark energy , hence the references in 2 , and also confirmed in the leaked original script for me3 . 
  but he was ultimately not involved in the making of the game , so it was casey hudson who wrote the ultimate ending , leading to lots of changes that you may or may not agree with . 
  not pointing fingers , just saying what 's there . 
  another interesting tidbit is that there 's an optical illusion related to this building and the finlandia house across the street . 
  when looking at the two from the other side of the nearby t\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 bay , [ it seems like the main tower of the national museum is actually part of the finlandia house . 
  there 's also some companies that actually used to be in that illegal business before they went legit , crunchyroll for example . 
  in anchorage the rifles ' white color scheme makes perfect sense , though it does n't really explain why they 're all white , unless somehow all the chinese assault rifles in the games are leftovers from alaska . 
  i 'm not sure , the only ones that come to mind immediately are the ghoulified chinese at mama dolce 's , and they were spies . 
  kes\u00e4 pls come back . 
  that 's great , but it 's not okay to force your os on people , no matter how good it might be . 
  if your os is actually good , then people will get it because of that reason , not because you forced or tricked them into upgrading . 
  you just got banned for trying to cheat . 
   getting rid of the excess some how ... 
  lots and lots of fried chicken . 
  yeah , fraud exists with both systems , but the key difference is that with physical voting , the difference between changing one vote and changing one hundred or a thousand is significant ( lots of resources and coordination required on the part of the one trying to pull off the fraud ) , whereas when it comes to electronic votes , if you can fradulently change just one vote , it is trivial to change thousands of them . 
   if you allow people to tamper with the software or results . 
  and that might be easier than you think . 
  like , say , discreetly plugging an infected usb stick into the machine when it 's your turn to vote . 
  or , if the results are sent to some central server in order to produce the final count , how do you make sure that server is n't compromised ? 
  or that the connection is n't intercepted or dropped ? 
  anyway , i suppose the main point i 'm trying to make here is that if you dump ten thousand votes into the trash , that leaves a trail way bigger than electronic vote manipulation . 
  something like the infected usb stick i mentioned can be done by a single person with the right know-how . 
  i 'd say never underestimate human incompetence , stupidity and laziness . 
  take sony for example , a multi-million dollar company that made the mindbogglingly stupid mistake of storing psnetwork usernames and passwords in plain text , and when their servers got compromised the attackers could just walk away with all the sensitive data , no decrypting or anything required . 
  and that 's just one example . 
  it 's not really a toy since it 's not inteded to be used as one , more accurate would be to say it 's something you put on display . 
  still really expensive in my opinion . 
   the only one i have n't came up with is swat . 
  [ the patriot ] ( http://images.mocpages.com/user_images/34673/1391291679m_splash.jpg ) from mgs3 , of course !, 
   i thought it was clear jet was around before the bombs fell . 
  what ? 
  no , it was invented by myron , way after the bombs fell . 
  it 's made from brahmin shit basically . 
  i always assumed that the reason you find jet in vaults and other impossible locations is the same reason you find pipe weapons in weird places : bethesda dun goofed with their loot generation algorithms . 
  then i suppose it 's possible that bethesda decided to change the canonical origins of jet for some reason . 
  or alternatively , they fucked up with keeping track of the already existing canon . 
  1 and 2 were made by black isle , 3 and 4 by bethesda , while nv was by obsidian ( which also happens to employ a lot of the former black isle folks ) . 
  funny that the first related thing i thought of was the [ combine apc ] ( http://www.ganjica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/apc_scene_050_cam01_gp.jpg ) . 
  now pick up that can , cyka . 
  it seems that the next monmusu chapter will be [ delayed indefinitely now .

  thanks kanna . 
  discord comes to mind . 
  steam also has in-game overlays , but it 'd be pretty damn stupid if it was n't whitelisted by default . 
  well yeah , it 's pretty obvious that having access to the device itself via malware or exploits is going to negate any actual security that using tor grants . 
  or any kind of security or obfuscation , such as encryption . 
  so you should always , first and foremost , ensure that the device you 're using is secure enough . 
  if i had to guess , the official reason is probably to curb piracy , which is outright bullshit , since horriblesubs and the like rip the release way before the 24h/48h mark . 
  so basically , they 're pissing on their customers and telling them that it 's raining . 
   this is n't about invading our privacy this is about trying to stop terrorists from butchering innocent people ... 
  but no sure , make this about us in our rooms and our precious reddit privacy world where the government is out to get us . 
  sure , terrorists are bad , but i do n't like the idea of handing the government the keys to look through any and all encrypted whatsapp communications they please under the pretext of counterterrorism . 
  they 're probably going to pinky swear they will only look at the terrorists messages , but we do n't have any way of knowing if they 'll actually keep their word . 
  and i do n't think that eeither of us are naive enough to believe that counterterrorism will be all they 'll be doing with that power .
