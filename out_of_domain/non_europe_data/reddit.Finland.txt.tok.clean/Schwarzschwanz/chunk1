  have him do chores for breaking them and make it clear that he is n't allowed to smoke inside your house . 
  if you 're bankrolling his studies , make it clear that if the grades start to slip and he does n't have an adequate excuse , you 'll cut him off . 
  i have parents who 've laid down rules similar to yours . 
  if they 'd caught me smoking inside , i 'd have to spend a weekend doing forest maintenance . 
  with how the parliamentary elections last year panned out in mind , it 's interesting to see the markets reacting like this based on a relatively minor swing in the polls . 
  ironically , the jovial mood in the in camp might have an effect on voter turnout , especially among younger voters , which could hand the referendum to the brexiters .

  [ holy textwall batman !, 
  ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/mcxhz.jpg ) i did not read your 24 points - as a matter of fact i did not even get through your preamble , but i 'll try to give you my two cents !, 
  northern european men ( everything from england and up , basically ) are ** generally ** not very aggressive in approaching women . 
  it 's to do with a respect for personal space , respect for women , a more general self-reflectiveness and whatnot . 
  a woman asking a man out is n't out of the ordinary here , and if you 're interested i 'd recommend doing so !, 
  i wish you the best of luck !, 
  that 's not right !, 
  we hate ** some ** russians , like stalin ( who was georgian , but whatever ) and bobrikov . 
  some , like alexander the first , are among the most revered men in finnish history . 
  russian culture is very much appreciated and consumed in great volume , and though the relationship between the two countries is n't exactly great , we are certainly on better terms with the russians then most of the rest of the eu . 
  yea , because we do n't have a minimum wage in finland , like all economically literate countries . 
  ** edit ** : you can downvote me all you want , it does n't make it any less true . 
  none of the nordic countries have legal minimum wages . 
  the welfare up here is extensive , but ( apart from norway ) not intervening in market functions unless deemed absolutely necessary is a pillar of our success . 
  to add to this , certain crimes that carry a lower penalty than that are included , and shoplifting is one of these !, 
  \u00c5land has a restriction on domicile rights for new arrivals which , among other things , prevents them from voting in municipal elections and purchasing property . 
  after living in \u00c5land for 5 years and successfully taking a swedish language test you are granted these rights . 
  but that 's not how it works !, 
  if you campaign on making the us like denmark , you can not ignore the things that make the system economically feasible !, 
  finland and sweden ( the countries that i am familiar with , but i am sure the same goes for denmark ) were both extremely capitalist societies up until the middle of the 20th century , which is what made the welfare state possible . 
  if you put the cart before the horse you end up like brazil , and not like the nordics . 
  would you care to give me an example of a place that is doing better than finland or sweden , for example , and where everything is hunky-dory ? 
  this is not an ideal world , and as far as i 'm concerned the nordics have achieved a hell of a lot , much of it thanks to rational economic policies . 
  well , i want a dragon for a pet , and if that is n't possible i 'll settle for a unicorn !, 
  if you go about trying to turn the us into a welfare state in the imagine of the nordics in the way sanders is proposing , you 'll end up like a banana republic and not a nordic style welfare state . 
  his policies are , by definition , not economically literate . 
  i would contend that that has more to do with the organisation of the welfare state , and less to do with a minimum wage . 
  it 's the state 's way of making sure that even the careless put away money for their retirement , which eases the burden on the state . 
  oh , well that is exactly what i 'm doing !, 
  not criticising ? 
  on the internet ? 
  :o preposterous !!, 
  i 'm sorry to break the reddit sandersnista circlejerk , but if enough of you yankees join in , the us is going to bern its dick off ( greatest in world , might i add ) !, 
  i feel like it 's my place to chime in seeing as the nordic model is often cited as the one that should be pursued by the american left . 
  the problem is that they seem to have no clue of what it actually entails !, 
  except it 's not !, 
  one addresses the problem flexibly through redistribution after taxes , the other is a rigid intervention in the market function which can be devastating for the economy , particularly if instituted on a national level in a country as big and economically diverse as the us . 
  that 's like saying state ownership of all business and taxation of businesses are the same thing - they 're both ways through which the state gathers resources through enterprise . 
  if you have a welfare state where you support the poor through higher taxation , the burden is carried by the economy as a whole , and a as a result it is more flexible than setting a legal minimum wage . 
  because of this huge difference in flexibility , the end results are not similar at all !, 
  except a minimum wage ( especially if it 's high , like the 12 dollars proposed in the us ) is detrimental to productivity !, 
  you shut out a huge chunk of the workforce . 
  is n't it better to let the market set the minimum wage and then help the least skilled through welfare state functions ? 
  a negative income tax could do just that , for example . 
  even if you go for a welfare state , the cost of supporting the poor is carried more evenly , and the effect is less damaging . 
  i do n't understand the question !, 
  businesses have to work within the constraints of economic reality . 
  if your question is whether or not i think businesses should foot the bill for what effectively amounts to welfare , my answer is definitely no . 
  i would say it 's more of a mandatory insurance for citizens !, 
  i do not !, 
  a wage is a regular payment made by an employer to an employee in exchange for work . 
  the welfare state provides a safety net that in its most basic form provides a basic sustenance to everyone who can not provide for themselves and , in a more expanded form , provides more advanced services . 
  the reason state support is different is that it is carried by society as a whole . 
  the impact of introducing a minimum wage has quite a different result , both in terms of who gets the enjoy the benefit and how it impacts society . 
  i am not familiar with costa rica !, 
  finland was a middle income country by european standards before the outbreak of the first world war , so your statement is quite inaccurate . 
  because the side effects are very different !, 
  mandating a minimum wage is a market intervention that has serious repercussions both for low-skilled labour and businesses . 
  lol . 
  in what scenario would that be the case ? 
  how about sticking to the topic ? 
  well , to be honest it 's very complicated !, 
  this is microeconomics at a university level , and explaining it in a reddit thread is not easy . 
  through the link earlier i was trying to give some information on the fundamentals of a minimum wage and was hoping that you , based on that , could draw at least a few conclusions as to how it differs from governmental benefits . 
  for starters , a wage is something that is paid in exchange for an employee 's time , be that on an hourly , weekly , monthly or yearly basis . 
  a governmental benefit is not a quid pro quo situation . 
  not counting various administrative requirements , the receiver of the benefit gets a sum that is not dependent on giving something in return . 
  in addition , the worker with a wage is producing something that , in a perfect market situation , is worth as much or slightly more than he or she receives in salary . 
  the receiver of a benefit is not producing anything . 
  it all boils down to basic economics : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdbdpfewso, 
  as long as the marginal benefit of hiring someone outweigh the marginal cost of doing so , businesses make more money by hiring someone . 
  if you set a minimum wage below equilibrium , it wo n't have any effect until the market situation changes , and if you set it above the equilibrium a certain portion ( the size of which depends on the price elasticity ) of the labour market will be shut out of work , because the minimum wage makes their contribution costlier to an employer than their benefit . 
  now , if we instead agree on a certain income level that is to be regarded as the lowest tolerable , we can subsidise the difference between the people on very low incomes and bring them up to this income level . 
  a negative income tax could work great . 
  this way the state must bear a smaller burden too , since the lowest earners will at least produce what they can , and not only be dependent on state subsidies , which would be the case if their capacity to produce was below that of the minimum wage . 
  i do n't think race plays a role , but culture certainly does !, 
  just compare the difference between the protestant north and the catholic south of europe !, 
  of course it has relevance !, 
  it is evident from your last reply that you 're still not comprehending what a minimum wage is . 
  you 're mistaking your own ignorance for me dodging the question .
