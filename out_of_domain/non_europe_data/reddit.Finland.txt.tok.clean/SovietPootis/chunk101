  no , i mean that you should n't be able to spawn to friendly vehicles when they have left the main base . 
  this would reduce the amount of `` clusterfuck '' even more . 
  this question has been asked for numerous times , and there is a solution which works all the time :, 
  seriously , start playing with your irl buddies , or if you do n't have any then add some random people ; either ask for some here on reddit or add some people after playing on solo mm matches . 
  not only the language barrier is removed but there are other premade perks as well ; it 's easier to make strategies , you know the general skill level of your teammates , you can assign people for certain people more easily . . it 's just way better in general . 
  once you have done this you 'll know that you 'll never play with rooskies anymore . 
  yeah m1ip is an excellent workhorse , definitely a must-have for us decks . 
  [ do you know what else does n't feel very fair ? 
  i think that you missed the point . 
  the thing is that all redfor planes have so little rpm in their main cannons , meaning that all blufor aircraft have a big advantage in dogfights . 
  1vs1 will always , always favor blufor . 
  almost all top-tier blufor planes have 4k + rpm in their cannons while redfor planes have that piss-poor 267 rpm . 
  or than i am just a noob who misses something critical about it . 
  so who else would deal with those terrorists ? 
  ukraine 's own forces ? 
  they might not be able to handle that job , so . . better to send someone more skilled from abroad . 
  after what happened in eastern ukraine i doubt that ukraine would request russia 's help with that job . 
  it 'd be pretty cool to see spetsnaz in cs : go though . 
  so gign handling the situation is pretty logical after all . 
  gign or gsg-9 , either of them are good . 
  and i doubt that the geographical location would matter * that * much in this situational since france is just a bit more distant from ukraine than germany is . 
  so who would ukraine send to deal with those terrorists ? 
  they were disbanded after what happened in maidan ( they killed 100 + protestors ) , expect those who were in crimea ; they joined russia . 
  so who else ukraine could send to handle the situation ? 
  well , there 's a bunch of regular grunts and militias ; probably something that i would not send to such a critical situation like this , especially after they failed miserably to retake eastern ukraine from seperatists ( but i do admit that it must 've been hard since those seperatists are backed by russia ) . 
  so yeah , my point still stands ; ukraine has ~ ~ shit ~ ~ not very good soldiers . 
  edit : word . 
  alright , i get your point but i do not completely agree with it . 
  there 's a lot of info available for the public and you can also make logical assumptions out of . 
  yes , we do not know details about their inner workings etc. 
  but the accomplishments speak more than anything . 
  [ gign has an admirable operation record ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_gendarmerie_intervention_group#operations ) while ukraine is a country on a verge of bankrupt with grunts and newly-founded militias ( which some of them refer themselves as special forces ) . 
  their combat record is not very good ( they failed to re-take eastern ukraine ) . 
  head over to / r/ukrainianconflict if you seek more information about the subject . 
  and if ukraine still has some super-secret counter-terrorism units that they have n't been sent to fight against seperatists . . well , that is possible but highly unlikely to be true as well . 
  to put it bluntly , your idea is terrible . 
  these challenges would simply be pointless . . 
  i mean , it would force players to change their playstyles in order to get some xp . 
  like for example if you were a tank pilot who 's using his tank properly ( aka supporting infantry from afar ) and got a challenge like `` destroy 3 vehicles in 1 minute '' , it would make this particular pilot to charge desperately into a town in order to get that final kill . 
  now if you do stuff like that , you would be in a very big risk to be killed and that 's what prob . 
  would happen . 
  so your idea would * courage * people to play ineffectively . 
  and what would be your reward if you played poorly ? 
  worthless . 
  and by worthless i mean that you would not contribute to the match at all . 
  it 's pretty obvious that you got this idea from cod ghosts , but in that you are encouraged to play poorly . 
  if you do those challenges in ghosts you actually get a properly rewarded ; killstreak . 
  not only they are fun to use but they can also be decisive whether your team wins or loses . 
  as i said , your idea is terrible overall . 
  the only way i could actually see this being useful if it encouraged teamwork instead of playing poorly . 
  let 's just say that squad leader could assign his teammates to heal/resupply him or even assign recons to lase targets for his laser-guided missiles . 
  doing these things would grant extra xp for your teammates and it might actually incentive them to help you . 
  all parties would benefit since you ( as a squad leader ) would get what you need while your teammates get rewarded for that . 
  but this idea might be too hard to implement so i am not sure if it really should be implemented . 
  as for your challenges . . well . . make them up by yourself . 
  use your imagination !, 
  you do n't need some worthless points to prove yourself that you can kill 3 guys with only 1 magazine , do you ? 
  edit : word . 
  kennys has been on point today so they could actually make it happen . 
  [ so i just found this on his twitch channel . 
  ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/sacriel/c/5302008 ) holy shit . 
  i doubt that eugen will remove patriot but i 've seen some valid suggestion in this subreddit how to fix it . 
  you can either nerf the patriot to `` normal '' ranges , make buk-m1 into a redfor patriot ( and increase the price ) or make mig 31 into a super-sead plane . 
  it really does n't matter * that * much which option would be applied but i am sure that eugen will inevitably do something about it . 
  i would also like to point out that ios version has fewer maps than the * base * game . 
  and on top of that it also lacks that expansion pack which also brings a lot of new maps to the game . 
  and those features that the expansion pack adds . . they make the game a lot better . 
  if you really get into xcom you can also download this amazing mod called long war - it basically feels like a second expansion to the game . 
  it is so good that even the developers of xcom have praised it !, 
  and quarian . 
  been there , done that . 
  was n't fun :(, 
  well , there 's always the famous [ kalakukko . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalakukko ) it 's really not my favourite food and i favour the lanttukukko version which is made from swede instead of fish , but kalakukko is definitely the more famous one . 
  it is a pretty tricky to make so you can always [ buy some ] ( http://www.varusteleka.com/en/product/kalakalle-kalakukko-170-g-sailyke/27360/ ) instead of making it . 
  ^ that ^ does n't ^ make ^ me ^ feel ^ any ^ better, 
  not only it is cheaper but it is also better . 
  you can stay cloaked forever while ghost cloak disappears next turn and has limited uses . 
  this is pokpung-ho , is n't it ? 
  in that case it 'd be pretty unfair if one faction would have such advanced technology ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  well , thank you for the answer !, 
  it seems pretty unfortunate that you guys are so limited in modifying this game . . on the other hand though it is impressive how much you can achieve nevertheless . 
  anyway , your solution would be swell but there is a problem ; \u00f8 and \u00f6 are n't the same as o ; nordic countries use that letter as well and most of the countries even use \u00e5 , which is a different type of o. 
  in fact in sweden '' \u00e5 '' is used as `` o '' while `` o '' is used as `` u '' . 
  those svenskj\u00e4vlarna are just silly , do n't you agree ? 
  simply swapping these letters would make some of these names . . incorrect . 
  another solution would be that you would remove all of the names that include these special letters . 
  sure , it would shrink the list of available names but that would at least solve the biggest `` issue '' while keeping all of these names correct . 
  however , this would n't completely solve the issue between norwegian/swedish names since some of these names are unique to that specific country , like andersson for example , which is a swedish name . 
  however , you could explain that they are norwegians/swedes living in sweden/norway , even though that these minority groups are n't that big . 
  well anyway , thank you for noting this small issue . 
  no matter what your solution will be , i would like to thank you for fixing it . 
  a fine bottle of whiskey did the trick for me . 
  or maybe a dozen of them , i ca n't remember . 
  unfortunately i am not a native swede/norwegian so i ca n't help you with this matter , sorry . 
  [ oh my . . what a legend he is . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wqwfhx6cqg ) when it comes to ost this dude is * the best * , hands down !, 
  yes , i absolutely second mass effect . 
  it is a must-play if you are even slightly into story-based games . 
  even if the story itself is n't the most unique ( humans are living among other aliens now , ancient evil threat threatens the whole humanity . . ) , characters in this game are just superb .
