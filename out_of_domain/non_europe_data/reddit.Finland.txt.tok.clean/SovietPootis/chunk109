  i decided to follow him to another server . 
  this time he was using apcs and he sucked with them as well . 
  after killing him twice he just told me that * i * was a cheater with dual 25mm cannons or some sort , using `` nx '' cheat or something like that . 
  he `` knew exactly '' what i was doing . 
  being rather pissed , he told me that he would show his `` evidence '' to fairfight and i would be banned swiftly . 
  that was a moment i knew that justice had been served . 
  a cheater who gets owned even with his cheats , 
  i was n't flying the f35 but when i do , i use 20mm , ecm , laser guided missiles and stealth coating . 
  ouch . 
  keep in mind that community is n't a single person - there are thousands of us so there will be . . different opinions . 
  even though i think that some of the complaining is purely just bitching , i genuinely think that this `` community map '' thingy is underwhelming . 
  when i started watching trailer i truly expected that we would * finally * get modding tools , or even map editors would 've been amazing . 
  there is * so much * potential on user-created content . 
  most franchises , including battlefield , exist today thanks to modding community . 
  and history has proven over and over again that having mod tools is user-friendly , and in vast majority of cases it also benefits the developer , because a successful mod means more players that are interested , and more interested players means more sold copies . 
  let 's look at cs : go for example . 
  people can pretty much mod everything , so they can create content for community servers * for free * . 
  and then there 's the whole operation pass map packs/weapon skin thingy , in which both valve and content creators make money while the player has access to all content ( including maps ) , excluding purely cosmetic weapon skins . 
  having no mod tools only makes me wonder what sort of goodies have we missed due to lack of mods . 
  yeah , i 'd like to see that as well . 
  i doubt that the roster change will happen before the major though since allu made it there as well with 3dmax ( unless they change allu with xarte , but i doubt that ) . 
  however , it 's not still abundantly clear if allu is suitable for the team . 
  i 'm excited to see their results in upcoming faceit matches . 
   it would probably get boring to play out each day by day , so instead , i will forward time until the next mission , and that will give me the date of the next stream date, 
  airgame in ps2 is nice and unique , it just takes a while to get used to ( and a lot of time to get good at ) . 
  2142 controlling pretty bollocks , at least when compared to ps2 ( although 2-seated fighters were nice ) . 
  . . but you ca n't deny that there 's no visual resemblance , can you ? 
  okay okay ^ i 'll ^ just ^ ^ remove ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ shitpost, 
  well , if they just harvest synthetics , the organics will have 50 000 years of time to create even deadlier synthetics , whereas harvesting organics would cause new organics to build murderbots from scratch , and even then they have like 2000 years ( like asari who discovered citadel 2000 years ago ) . 
  also , you ca n't make reapers from synthetics . 
  oh , another variant of leo 2 is already out ? 
  i thought that us finns would * finally * get some latest stuff when we bought 2a6 's : /, 
  i can imagine that happening eventually . 
  we are already using amv 's , [ some of which are equipped with amos ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/tykillinen_amv.jpg/1280px-tykillinen_amv.jpg ), 
  having a replacement , or a supplement for our bmp-2ms and cv-90 's would be pretty neat , but unfortunately we need to replace our f-18cs in the near future as well ( most likely by f35 's ) , and it would be better if rk 62 and rk 95 assault rifles would be swapped for something better too . 
  so , under these . . economical circumstances it 'd be quite difficult to get them all , at least in a short period of time . 
  aiming a bit low in insurgency in certain circumstances is the right thing to do because a ) bodyshots can kill instantly too , and it is very difficult to land a headshot at longer ranges . 
  b ) if there are enemies at distances at a larger map , the sight might block their vision and c ) people laying on the ground can be totally missed if your sight is just blocking the floor . 
  maybe playing like this in dust 2 is wrong but there are no official maps like this in insurgency - they all have more or less long ranges . 
  that 's an interesting question and i 'll attempt to elaborate . 
  first of all , everybody here acknowledges the fact that ukraine was invaded , and is still being invaded by russia . 
  even though putin bots on the internet are trying to influence that opinion , nobody is taking their talks seriously . 
  we 've had first-hand experience about russia doing dirty things while talking the other thing . 
  the winter war is still being remember with great pride when finns furiously fought against invading soviets - and with exceptional success . 
  russians have recently tested our interceptors with their aircraft , and this has angered a lot of finns . 
  testing interceptor capabilities is indeed preparing for war , even if they are n't planning to attack . 
  currently there are no fears about an imminent invasion , but current events have definitely raised concerns . 
  people are definitely agreeing that finnish defence forces could use some additional funding , and while a lot of people support the idea of joining nato , according to recent surveys ~ 50 % of the people oppose the idea . 
  some people think that our conscription army can handle the invasion by themselves or with the help of sweden ( a military alliance between our countries ) . 
  some do not think that russia would invade finland , and maintaining good relations with both sides , like in cold war , will keep the peace . 
  some think that russian economy will not be in a very good position to launch a full invasion is simply not sustainable , and you ca n't do smaller stuff like `` support rebels '' against an united country like finland , which has vastly different cultural values than russia . 
  and on top of that , having good relationships with them is important for us finns . 
  russia is the most important trading partner for us ( or was , before sanctions ) , and russian tourism is important . 
  well , that too was before sanctions since the russian middle class has lost a lot of their buying power since ruble is doing poorly . 
  but what do i personally think about this situation ? 
  well , you can say that i should put my tinfoil hat on but i am those who think that russian invading , or annexing parts of finland is some of their long-term goals . 
  a lot of russian have bought some land that are placed in strategical locations . 
  firstly it is batshit insane that such pieces of lands are sold in the first place , but secondly the government is not anything about it . 
  in case of an invasion they could definitely have a role like jamming communications and such . 
  but why would russia annex parts of finland , especially since we have friendly relations , at least on paper ? 
  well , [ here 's an interesting article ] ( https://translate.google.fi/translate?hl=fi&amp;sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsuomenkuvalehti.fi%2fjutut%2fkotimaa%2fvenaja-vaatii-suomelta-laivastotukikohtaa-gotlanti-miehitetaan-voisiko-nain-tapahtua%2f%3fshared%3d71925-a966ca7d-500 ) about a scenario where russia invades either swedish gotland or finnish \u00c5land to have a foothold in the baltic sea . 
  this is just speculating though , but as i stated above , we 're talking about long-term goals . 
  being a nato country it would be impossible that russia would invade us , and i highly doubt that russia would stop trading with us if we did so . 
  i personally , and many too think that we should join nato while it is still possible - in a few years it may be too late to become a member . 
  norwegian armored deck - got ta have dem chaffees !, 
  well that may be your opinion , but that would be a massive nerf for recon units , especially for low-tier ones , making them pretty much redundant . 
  since gameplay is more important than realism , i do n't support your idea at all . 
   it 's kind of a perfect balance between simulation and arcade . 
  expect it is not . 
  at all . 
  i mean , battlefield 4 is almost on-par with call of duty when it comes to realism - weapon/vehicle/aircraft handling is way off , damage models on both tanks and vehicles are vastly different ( like apc could never penetrate mbt armor with the autocannon while mbt would one-shot kill the apc in real life ) , crew size on both vehicles and aircraft are much bigger in real life . . 
  perhaps the correct word here to use is authentic instead of realistic ? 
  i mean , battlefield 4 has nice graphics , weapons/vehicles/aircraft are modeled really well , weapons and such work in somewhat similarly than in real life , firefights happen in * relatively * correct ranges and such . 
  if you could somehow squeeze extra $ 100 to your budget , that would be great since the optimal budget for pcs are between, 
  if you ca n't do that , i recommend that you get only a single 4gb ram stick , look for a cheaper hdd and case , maybe a cheaper motherboard ( if you are n't looking to overclock ) and swap gtx660 to [ 270x , ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr9270x2gbd5ppdhe ) which is both cheaper and better than 660 . 
  well , you really need a solid cpu since a lot of games require it , like planetside 2 . 
  so , how about more something like this ?

  i would also like to note that the power supply is pretty bad , but with this budget you do n't have a lot of options . 
  also , if you want to overclock , you need to spend extra on your cpu and a better power supply . 
  it 's also recommended that you get a second ram stick later on . 
  edit : the ~ ~ cpu ~ ~ psu wo n't do it , it does n't fulfill the requirements . 
  get this instead if you want to cheap out :, 
  oh , it was only a 5400rpm , my bad . 
  the case is good for it 's price and since you are on budget it 's one of the place where you can cut out . 
  oh and you may want to buy additional fans + some sort of adapter for them . 
  now please , do this with blowpipes !,
