  and i 'm using only 4 infantry cards because i thought that i 'd use the deck on a bit more open maps where tanks and such would excel , and panzerfaust 3 on heabyung '90s would be enough to kill tanks for me . 
  i suppose that it 'd be better if i added some chu-mats , just like you said . 
  really ? 
  after playing like 200 matches i had n't figured that yet ; i only thought that more expensive artillery gives extra accuracy and range , which i found worthless . 
  well , i better change my decks , then . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  su-27s is n't necessarily shit . 
  it has 7700m range on its sa missiles , giving it a slight advantage in head-to-head engagements . 
  also you get two of them per card . 
  so no , it is not shit , just ai n't the best option though . 
  i 'm not completely sure , but most likely barrel bombs . 
  now , imagine how useful this thing would be . . you would be able to use them if there was n't any aa and if survived the small-arms . . and the blast radius . 
  exactly .

  nsfw you have been warned lol, 
  expect mcdonalds does give you steady quality , and you know what you will get . 
  this case in the other hand . . is like buying meat from a company that is known to have their meat being rotten . 
  they may or may not send you edible meat if they screw up . 
  sure , you can buy it six months in advance or buy the product after you have seen it with your own eyes . 
  and sure , people are granted to buy meat from companies with such practices and this is also why they get away with it . 
  maybe you just have a bit too nostalgia in your eyes or are caught by the reddit circlejerk . 
  sure , the business model may have changes but the games themselves have never been as cheap as they are now . 
  such model that you are presenting is only applied mostly in mainstream games , and even then this is better than in the past . 
  for example , here 's some [ snes prices ] ( http://vgtribune.com/vgtribune/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/game-catalog-600x732.jpg ) back in the day . 
  80 bucks for a donkey kong ? 
  haha no , that 's actually $ 130 with the inflation being accounted . 
  and what does battlefield cost ? 
  about $ 100 with the base game and the premium , and you can go a lot lower all the way down to $ 30 with the sales . 
  you can also guess which title has more content in it . . 
  what about times before snes ? 
  game arcades ? 
  paying constantly to play such games ? 
  yeah , when you really start to think about it , games are a lot cheaper than they used to be ( like you have tons of superb content on pc without spending a dime ) , and even the worst cases like battlefield are n't that bad either . 
  seconded on english . 
  most of us finns simply do not possess such linguistic skills that we would able to discuss with the ( god-forsaken ) language . 
  anyway , back to the topic . 
  i personally think that left-wing lost a lot of loyal voters . 
  sdp has recently become more and more centre , and people simply do not believe that sdp would represent them anymore . 
  this is why they have voted for both centre party and finns party . 
  that and their unsuccessful period as a cabinet party did n't help them either . 
  as for the vasemmistoliitto , which is usually seen as the left-wing party for the young , lost a lot of voters as well , mostly to the green league . 
  as / u/elmokki mentioned , there needs to be reforms for the left-wing . 
  they have been constantly losing seats since the cold war , and if centre parties now have a successful period in the cabinet ( assuming that left-wing parties wo n't participate ) , this would be even more devastating for them . 
  maybe they are trying to compensate for the fact that they 're now selling mods through workshop ? 
  [ yes , the shit is fucking real . 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/aboutpaidcontent/ ), 
  my knee-jerk reaction is that this will lead into terrible things . . but i dunno , we will just wait and see i guess . 
  here 's an usa deck a with focus on heli openings, 
  my thoughts :, 
  ** logistics : ** there 's not much needed to be said , 1vs1 no need for a fob and in 2vs2 a teammate brings one . 
  twin huey instead of blackhawk because tacom does n't need to be first in combat . 
  might change cheap jeep for something beefier . 
  ** infantry : ** the general idea is that light riflemen and deltas are used for a fast capture with the help of helis and recon infantry . 
  light riflemen can kill light vehicles while are good vs infantry . 
  marines and smaw are heavy hitters which will come in to play slightly later . 
  stingers are also in ground transports since there 's dap 's are for initial air protection . 
  ** support : ** pretty basic stuff here to be fair . 
  the deck is n't arty heavy so there 's no atacms to be included ( albeit it is an amazing unit ) . 
  ** tank : ** m1a2 for super-heavy stuff , m1a1 as the workhorse ( that 's why the downvet ) . 
  m8 ags is a nimble glass cannon and that 's why it 's included . 
  recon : longbow is crucial for air openings as it 's your best option to kill tanks . 
  infantry is used in openings as well ; seals will plow infantry while rangers are pretty much used for basic stuff , and their carl gustav can initially do some good damage against vehicles and tanks . 
  bradley does n't need introductions and lav scout is great fire support and is scattered across the map . 
  ** vehicle : ** since there is no bradleys in the infantry tab i feel like i need some additional atgms . 
  ontos on the other hand is a great heat launcher . 
  there 's no dedicated fire support since the lav scout has that one covered . 
  ** heli : ** daps are obviously one of the critical components in this deck : they 're just amazing aa helos and only the chinese helo is better in the role . 
  supercobra is a supplement both for the longbow and the dap . 
  ** plane : ** there 's asf , bomber , sead , atgm , napalm . . there 's not much else needed to be said , is there ? 
  and why is that ? 
  i mean , airborne decks are great for openings . . and that 's it . 
  their ground units have very limited options . 
  sure , if you are playing with high player counts then it 's good but i am seeking to play this with 1vs1 or 2vs2 , so that i will have some solid ground units as well . 
  also , heli openings are very predictable if you are using airborne deck . 
  yea you 're right about the first point , maybe i 'll put some wheels on my rangers . 
  i 'm not so sure about putting stingers on blackhawks though , i 'm confident hat my daps can protect from air/heli until the back-up arrives ( since light ~ ~ infantry ~ ~ riflemen can keep ir aa at distance ), 
  if i ditch out my lav scout then i need a different ~ ~ support ~ ~ unit to do the fire support . 
  i do n't think that lvtp-7a1 's alone could do that . . maybe i 'll add comvat and remove ontos ? 
  now , this is what i find interesting . 
  i have a soft spot for rally racing and it has been very disappointing how inadequately the genre is represented in gaming . 
  there 's just something intriguing about driving time trials where the pavement is mostly something else than asphalt . 
  i 'm just wondering how good the ea is in it 's current state . 
  are there any major bugs ? 
  how about the performance ? 
  how much content is included at the moment ? 
  well , it 's arguable the best at heli in the soviet arsenal . 
  the 65 % accuracy is a nice bonus ( vs. akula with 50 % and 2nd reroll at 2625m or something ? 
  ) , and the amount of missiles will definitely scare away even a bit larger pushes . 
  but . . the 25ap is n't amazing . 
  this thing wo n't pop superheavies left and right like the longbow does . 
  the amount of missiles is n't that big of a deal since the enemy will most likely use ir aa to fend off/kill the chopper after you have fired few missiles . 
  mi-28 is definitely a mixed bag . 
  mi - ~ ~ 28 ~ ~ 24vp and mi - ~ ~ 28 ~ ~ 24p could be better options due to the cost-efficiency , but these things are * even worse * at killing heavy tanks . 
  if mi-28 was in the us arsenal for example then it would be just outright bad , but if it 's carefully microed and used in right situations , then the mi-28 is without a doubt a valuable asset . 
  also , the amount of rockets is bad , just like / u/justarandomgerman said . 
  the rocket themselves are superior to mi-24 counterparts , but since you get only 10 of them . . you can only kill one squad of infantry and be done with it . 
  well i bought any way , played for 90 minutes and i can already say that i 'm not regretting my purchase . 
  gameplay-wise the game is * exactly * what i have been looking out for years . . and it finally came out today out of the blue . 
  seriously , if you have even the slightest interests in rally then the game is a must-buy !,
