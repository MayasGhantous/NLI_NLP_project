  atleast not on team fortress 2 . . he was once on the same server where i was , and he was actually pretty good !, 
  well never mind . . our savior said that windows is a sin . . 
  i do n't know does he deserve this but . . why not ? 
  i kinda agree with tk : ing , it forces people to play more carefully . 
  especially when i said sorry . . 
  i made an grammar error , forgot to remove it . 
  i am actually quite careful with my fire , i just did n't notice that guy . 
  the problem is his behavior : he gets teamkilled , and the team killer apologies . 
  but still , he decides to spend his c4 to a friendly tank , when there is low resource income and you need all help to stop vanu zerg . 
  if somebody enters that sundie the twenty minutes recharge time resets . 
  forgive me my grammar errors , i typed this in rush and i am not native english speaker . 
  but yes , in future tense . 
  i never have heard of this guy , prob . 
  because he has `` only '' 300k subscribers . 
  i would 've personally pick frankieonpcin1080p to lead vanu . 
  he has `` only '' 350k subscribers but he gains a lot more views than day 9 , and he would attract a lot of players into this game . 
  edit : fail comment , stop downvoting me plz, 
  the goal of this marketing campaign is not how does his make . 
  the point of this marketing campaign is to get as much as possible new players to this game . 
  if justin bieber made fps commentary then yeah , maybe i would suggest him . 
  if he has tons of people watching his streams , then i will take back my words . 
  seems about right . 
  well damn . 
  i should watch more esports . 
  since studio alpha , actually . 
  he is one of the first guys who has made ps2 content . 
  this is quite wrong actually . 
  indar : tr and vs have a good fight against each other , while nc is usually getting crushed . 
  sometimes vs or tr push to each others warp gate . 
  esamir : usually nc and vs are dominating the map while tr is getting crushed . 
  sometimes tr gets some landgrab but vs usually denies it quickly . 
  amerish : most of the time this continent is dominated by tr . 
  however , this continent is not dead because there usually atleast one enemy platoons state base and multiple enemy platoon state base . 
  i found this :, 
  pretty shit bundle i have to admit . 
  i was actually greatly surprised how you managed to capture so much from indar tonight . 
  and you actually managed to defend that territory for a while !, 
  usually when you capture our mao tech plant we just re-capture all that territory swiftly and push you back to the rashnu bio lab and beyond . 
  only place where nc shines is the esamir . 
  somehow my fellow tr has some kinda amerish fetish , they always gather a massive zerg and capture 80 % of the territory and then hold positions . 
  i do n't know why . . 
  i love engineer . 
  in me1 though it 's terrible class . 
  he has poor abilities and you have only heavy pistol . 
  also it 's very boring class to play when almost all of his abilities look like same . 
  wan na go what is finland 's national shame ? 
  [ here it is ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onfwmeptuz0 ), 
  you have overload that can drains shields, 
  freeze which allows you to freeze opponents which has `` health '' , making as good as dead . 
  incinerate does good damage to armor and you can ignite enemies with health . 
  also you can detonate frozen enemies . 
  you have combat drone which does n't do very nice damage but can distract enemies and if you upgrade it , it will explode when destroyed . 
  also , you have hacking . 
  you can hack synthetic enemies , making them as your allies for a brief time . 
  very fun class to play , i highly recommend !, 
  if you have played female quarian engineer in me3 mp , you know why . 
  tr was dominating amerish at that point . . not fun . 
  he is finnish justin bieber . 
  the amount of auto-tune is cringe-worthy , words of this song are terrible and young girls like ~ ~ her ~ ~ him . 
  also , some finnish devs are making movie about him . 
  fixed that, 
  just lower the difficulty if it 's too hard this game is too great to be skipped . 
  and later you will have one of the most epic `` holy shit ! '', 
  moment in your gaming history . 
  i am talking about [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvrifijtgt0 ) scene ( do n't press it op , spoiler ! ), 
  ` murica, 
  i have to disagree with this . 
  i bought myself a shotgun - i did n't like it . 
  why ? 
  because i found myself in too many situations where enemies are too far away from efficient range . 
  prob . 
  because of my playstyle . 
  does slugs have the same damage if i hit all pellets to my target with standard ammunition ? 
  or make a cert upgrade which allows you to bail out . 
  this should go to same spot where the flares are , so you ca n't have a competitive aircraft and ability to jump down at the same time . 
  i do n't care about kills . 
  i care about xp . 
  if the person bails out i gain only 75xp instead of 175 . 
  that is one reason why aa in this game is so unrewarding . 
  the situation is worse with bursters and skyguards . 
  yes i do know that , but you can still bail out with a light assault without any upgrades , and survive . 
  medical kit . 
  medical kit instantly gives you instantly full health , while restoration kit regenerates your health in 6 seconds . 
  also , if you have nanoweave armor upgrades you wo n't even get a full health . 
  sure , you will save 20 certs if you buy restoration kit but 20 certs is nothing . 
  [ nope ] ( / spoiler `` me3 '' ), 
  who is jacob ? 
  [ these ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dyzugsqluw ) [ should ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em4iqn2si-u ) [ answer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6debljy73g ) [ your ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjjs4if4dro ) [ question ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-xboyixlhw ), 
  there are 3 empires you can choose in this game :, 
  humanity aka terran republic, 
  corporate whores aka new conglomerate, 
  religious fanatics aka vanu sovereignty . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qmcevpv9n4 ) video made me join the terran republic, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mapvehk_oe ) is our glorious leader , totalbiscuit, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-im81youb0 ) is the heretic `` leader '' of the vanu sovereignty , tobuscus, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg_k32lvtg8 ) is the primitive leader of the new conglomerate , seananners, 
  planetside 2 does n't have sexy blue aliens . . but those vanu latex butts do just fine . 
  we already have maxes . . 
  human does not equal humanity, 
  also , other images are linking to other soe games , such as everquest 2 .
