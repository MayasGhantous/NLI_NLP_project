  for a title like battlefield a multiplayer is not a necessity . 
  for me the bf2-style multiplayer with bots is just enough , especially if the bots offer a decent challenge . 
  campaigns . . well , bad company series was okay i suppose , but bf3 & bf4 were just stupid cheesy scripted doodoo dogshit . 
  they tried to go cod route with campaigns , and i would argue that their product was even worse than what cod has to offer . 
  they were dull , mindless shooters that were pretty trivial , even on the hardest difficulty . 
  [ their `` innovative '' features also failed horribly . 
  this is correct . 
  the new spray is pretty much the same as the old one , expect a shitton of extra random spray . 
  you ca n't learn to predict randomness , can you ? 
  if i had to guess , that would n't offer any protection against , well , anything . 
  not that the thin layer of metal called `` armor '' on the t-34 would n't protect them anyway . 
  or 2142 in general . 
  people seem to just assume it 's a silly futuristic shooter with lasers and all that other gimmicky stuff . 
  what people do n't know that it was pretty realistic vision of 22nd century 's warfare . 
  almost everything is achievable in today 's technology : emp , projectiles ( bullets and railguns ) , nuclear reactors as an energy source for walkers . . totally feasible in the next century . 
  sure , some things went somewhat overboard , like the titans for example , but nonetheless the game is based on real-life technology instead of pure sci-fi . 
  there 's your shitton of extra rng . 
  at a long ( and short ) distance you need more luck to land your targets , especially after the first 15 bullets , which is a major deal in 2-3k spraydown scenarios . 
  the game already required plenty of luck even before the patch , but this is a whole new level of shitty rng . 
  my only problem with the titan mode was the rdx camping - it was pretty much impossible to get to a reactor console if a handful of coordinated defenders decided to slap indestructible rdx charges next to that chokepoint . 
  those charges should be destructible with emp or he grenades , and maybe give the defenders a carriable shield to help attackers to push through . 
  but then again if defenders dug too deep then you could just capture the silos and win the game the boring way . 
  i do n't completely agree with the weapons being completely balanced . 
  the eu standard assault rifle was far inferior the pac krylov - only +2 damage but a lot worse firerate . 
  what . 
  surely you meant authentic ? 
  battlefield is as arcadey as it gets . 
   future is just made up rubbish no one wants in a bf game . 
  battlefield 2142 did sell pretty well . 
  it was established in a pretty realistic universe . 
  they 've done it before so i do n't see why they would n't do it again . 
  besides , there has been nothing but modern era battlefield in the past seven years . 
  it is gettimg pretty damn stale . 
  * singleplayer, 
  perhaps it 's not versatile , but [ pm-9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minebea_pm-9 ) would be a nimble machine pistol . 
  patton being fucked in the callout thread was hilarious . 
  the drama nearly reached / r/planetside levels . 
  there have been plenty of internal drama , like the most infamous , very highly skilled player abandoning the game after being frustrated with its development , but i think [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nlpuqqm.png ) is the most popular one . 
  basically a mod went full sjw and forced him to do a 500-word essay to get him unbanned after a trap joke . 
  the original post was about a person showing off her swag whom most likely was a transsexual as his big arms pointed out his manly appearance . 
  the thread overall was a mess as people told op that trans people are subhumans etc. 
  [ a thread in / r/kotakuinaction ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/390bni/user_banned_from_rplanetside_after_using_a_meme/ ) about the situation made it to # 1 / r/all , and / r/planetside was basically raided by all parts of reddit . 
  the rest is history . 
  china is n't a capitalistic state ? 
  lol . 
  china 's economic model is a state capitalism , not communism . 
  in a communistic society , the means of production would be controlled by the workers - the fruits of labor would be shared equally among the workers instead of capitalists exploiting their labor . 
  the workers would gain wholly the value that they have produced instead of petty $ 0.05 per hour gained in sweatshops etc. 
  china is a state capitalism , a form of capitalism . 
  the commercial activity is controlled by the state through state-owned business enterprises . 
  nearly all communistic states , including ussr , were state capitalisms . 
  so yeah , capitalistic greed is a driving force in china 's environmental issues . 
  on the other hand though , the country has invested greatly in renewable energy , more than any other country in the world . 
  2142 knifing was a blast . 
  i remember playing in one of those knife only gibraltar servers in which the experienced made their usage of knife a form of art . 
  all those sprint timings , proper diving , spinning and fake spins . . 
  i mean , it definitely did beat the shit out of current animation system . 
  i think he 's only doing his job . 
  i think i solved your mystery . 
  someone suggested here that there should be a defender that can place cameras . 
  [ with pc gaming hardware market worth more than $ 20 billion ] ( http://jonpeddie.com/publications/pc_gaming_hardware_market_report ) it 's safe to say that the market is there . 
  a market that will purchase accessories like oculus rift . 
  well , 43 % of the market is `` enthusiast '' - plenty of high-end rigs in there . 
  but you do have a point , though . 
  the first generation of vr devices wo n't be available for the mainstream market . 
  the market will be somewhat niche , but it still could sell in millions over time . 
  if the vr revolution happens like it did with smartphones then it will take few years as hardware get cheaper , software gets better and the vr devices themselves get more advanced . 
  ant 's , basebuilding , new base layouts . . plenty of good stuff . 
  unless we 're talking about ~ ~ panserbils ~ ~ , hachi-nanas or hinds . 
  krylov fa-37 , scar 11 . . and shuko k-80 of course . 
  lg has a pretty decent chance of pulling it off . 
  they have been legends three times in a row in majors , and their current roster mopped the floor in dreamhack winter with eu teams . 
  we will see if they manage to continue being such a force to be reckoned with or eu teams manage to figure their playstyle and end their momentum . 
  i think line inf not having piss-poor weapons is a start . 
  j\u00e4gers and their scandinavian brethren are useful as their mg 's can ditch out some neat damage . 
  bochongsu as well . 
  pkm-and m60 carriers ? 
  not so much . 
  if they make a futuristic bf then it 's probably a sequel for 2142 . 
  and trust me , 2142 was n't laser bs . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/390bni/user_banned_from_rplanetside_after_using_a_meme/ ), 
  as usual , drinking alcohol . 
  lots of it . 
  smoke is a lurker . . what ? 
  he 's one of the best classes suited for defending the site . 
  the gas grenades give you plenty of extra time to prepare when the enemy team breaches the site . 
  toss in a smoke grenade when a wall or a door gets blown up - now you can position yourselves better and call in the lurkers for backup as the attackers ca n't push to the site . 
  pulse can also be a very powerful site defender . 
  you can detect enemies slapping breaching charges on walls , windows and doors , giving you a chance to position yourselves better or even blast them away with a shotgun or nitro . 
  very useful in maps like embassy , 2nd floor . 
  also , rook is suited for lurking as well . 
  he 's nothing but a gun after he drops his armor bag . 
  well , does n't make him an ideal for that roll but still . 
  i have only tried the rollercoaster demo with the shitty dk1 and it was absolutely mindblowing . 
  definitely going to buy the consumer version once it gets released . 
  there have been server issues lately with the game . 
  usually it works just fine , and the issues are hopefully soon resolved . 
  source : i am literally in matchmaking queue while browsing reddit . 
  the core of the armored decks are superheavies . 
  mixed red wo n't get any of them .
