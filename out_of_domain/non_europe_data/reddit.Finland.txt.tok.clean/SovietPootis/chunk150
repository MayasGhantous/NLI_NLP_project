  entering, 
  well that is one way to put it . 
  consider this , though : people who are better off , mostly capitalists , steal legally by taking value from something that the worker himself has produced . 
  a worker might generate 20 $ value per hour for the company but he only gets paid for his wage , and the capitalist steals legally the rest . 
  i think it 's fair that the people who are better off give back some of the value that most of them did n't earn from their own labor . 
  for services like healthcare that everybody needs it 's fair that everybody contributes so that people , even those who could n't afford it otherwise , get it . 
  even with its drawbacks ontos is surprisingly good . 
  it fires a salvo of 6 rounds in a short burst - a single unit can do up to 18he worth of damage in a heartbeat . 
  let 's not forget that it has also decent heat ap , so it chews lightly armored targets , and even heavy tanks if they 're unattended . 
  to compensate for its poor accuracy you should use it at close range . 
  a stack of four can do wonders in forests . 
  yes !, 
  in-game wheel must rotate as much as it does in reality . 
  it surely would ruin your immersion when you rotate the wheel 90 degrees when you actually did 300 or something . . 
  i also bought the game on ea day 1 , and i 'm most satisfied with my purchase . 
  they 've done almost everything flawlessly with the game . 
  however , i would argue that 1:1 hands are important for the feel of presence . 
  with the dashboard view i do n't mind rudimentary cockpit as you see your own hands and wheel . 
  with vr however i do n't think shitty tracking or invisible hands would cut it . 
  hopefully they will manage to make that happen . 
  sweden did trial t-80u ( and some t-72 's ) in 1993-1994 . 
  one ca n't be surprised too surprised about the fact that the obsolete design ca n't hold its own against something more modern . 
  especially bf4 , i wonder why op used that as an example . 
  for the first 10 months the game was unplayable due to abysmal tickrate and networking , bugs etc. 
  if i consistently die a second after i had dashed to cover then the game is simply too broken to play , which is what happened with bf4 . 
  after the first 10 months the game became playable . 
  better servers , better tickrate and a new preset . 
  for more than a year after that they continued to improve networking and added shitton of new content . 
  nowadays the game is very good and i would recommend it if you like shooters like that . 
  but to claim that the game was finished at launch is just objectively wrong - it was one of the worst releases in the gaming history . 
  [ ea was literally sued due to false statements .

  at least this game is labeled as unfinished , and you were warned when you bought it . 
  its just the content that 's lacking , and with the introduction of ss weapons i think the game has a decent amount of it .

  with save scumming you really can really do wonders . 
  people do n't seem to understand that 2142 was n't * that * futuristic . 
  gameplay was slower than in any cod , no jetpacks , no `` laser bs '' , and even lock-ons were quite rare . 
  and some boat spotting,

  ye the community can be rough . 
  the experience does get somewhat better if you find the proper servers and stick to them . 
  gp-5 is so sexy, 
  with ra3 i think they had the right idea , and i was content with the execution . 
  the mechanics were mostly the same as they were in earlier games , the goofy art-style with warm colors was something that i would expect from a ra title , and having actors like simmons and hasselhoff thrown into the mix made it all better . 
  c&c 4 though . . just why ? 
  :( they even fucked up the cutscenes , which is an accomplishment of itself . 
  wargame : red dragon . 
  you get dozens of different artillery pieces ranging from small french 60mm mortar all the way up to soviet 203mm spg 's . 
  then there 's also rocket artillery . 
  you get your usual he warheads , but also cluster - , incendiary - , [ and even thermobaric rockets .

  the vocal part of the community is mostly ex-cod players that have an urge to prove their `` loyalty '' by disavowing their former franchise . 
  i mean , there 's nothing bad about quality banter , but their insults are truly infantile over some damned video games . 
  there are bots in the game . . 
  that 's beside the point . 
  bots do exist in the game , and they are designed in a way that a team of 5 can beat them . 
  i would not want them in my team , but ubi would make them better if they were to be implemented to regular 5vs5 . 
  ye that 's what i meant - to have bots that can shoot decently and use their gadgets ordinarily : if there is a wall between him and the objective it slaps a breaching charge . 
  if it hears enemies behind a wall & there is no friendlies then it uses cluster charge . 
  i think th bots with better aim & additional functionality would be good enough for the job . 
  would these bots be as good as average players ? 
  no , of course not . 
  useless ? 
  definitely not , i would have a decent bot that can shoot & use their gadgets over 4vs5 . 
  they would also be good enough for offline practice too ( if that 's something that one desires ) .

  gev\u00e6rmenn and dragoner '75 variants are 10 points tho . 
  unfortunately they have the shitty law but they 're still great units for the price . 
  this is true , which is why you must have some sort of at support with them . 
  dude , a-10 is turd in wargame , and probably in real life as well . 
  that was developed in the late 1920 's .

  i 'm pretty sure they 'll release it on consoles when every piece of dlc is released . 
  something between 60-70 % . 
  playing xcom with a controller is a design that 's proven to work , meaning that controls are n't a limitation . 
  unless the sales were abysmal on consoles , i think they will release xcom 2 complete edition with all the dlc , maybe even with some popular mods like from lws and capnbubs . 
  it may be hard to get into , especially if you have n't driven a real car before .
