  something . . something like [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yooi7zjbl0&feature=youtu.be&t=2m12s ), 
  but i can promise you one thing : this game is different . 
  if you have any interests in driving games , i highly recommend picking up this game . 
  driving feels great and even though i am not a truck driver all i can say is that the driving is realistic . 
  it takes you a while to brake , acceleration is slow but strong , and uphills/downhills effect the driving too . 
  also , the cargo effects the driving . 
  i once had a gravel cargo with only 2 pairs of wheels , and the truck was quite unstable because of that . 
  i almost flipped the car many times to its side , and i actually managed to do it once . 
  also , when you are driving you need to manage things like wipers , headlights and flashers , just like in real driving . 
  you can even listen rl radio and add your favourite radio channels !, 
  also , the game punishes you quite a lot if you crash or get many fines , but i heard in late game the economy is too easy and those do not matter so much . 
  aesthetics are really great in this game . 
  you actually feel like you are driving in european countryside . 
  no matter if you drive in plains with lots of farms or along mountains with lots of spruce around , it feels great . 
  also , rain and night really change the mood . 
  towns and cities unfortunately do not manage to have that feeling though . 
  graphics are quite decent in this game , but if we compare this to other simulators , they are great . 
  so you do n't have to worry that the graphics would suck . 
  the map includes whole germany , great britain and switzerland , western poland , eastern poland , northern italy , large chunk of austria and czech and eastern france . 
  if this is n't enough for you then it seems likes that there has been done some mods for this game , which will add extra maps . 
  and the map scale ? 
  it has been shrunk quite a lot so it would n't too large , but still , the map is massive when we compare it to other games . 
  and the detail in the map is great in this scale . 
  the game includes the largest truck brands , such as man , scania and volvo . 
  you have tons of different models to available for you to purchase . 
  you can also modify your vehicles visually and more powerful parts . 
  i am not very familiar with this yet so i ca n't go to details . 
  you can also carry many different types of stuff and material . 
  pipes , food , chemicals , wood , gravel . . you name it . 
  and as i mentioned earlier , the stuff that you have in your truck also effects the driving . 
  in this game you start a truck logistics company . 
  first you have to work as a freelancer and drive with other people trucks , but you can have a loan from the bank quite quickly , and buy your first truck for your business . 
  after that you can start doing logistics with your own truck and explore the world by yourself . 
  later on you can expand , open new offices , hire employees and buy new trucks . 
  but for me that is semi-relevant , because i just wanted to drive a truck . 
  there are tons of mods already made to this game . 
  so if you get bored , you can always go and try some mods out . 
  unfortunately there is n't steam workshop , but i hope that we 'll get one in the future . 
  if you are n't convinced yet , you can try the free demo . 
  it offers so many gameplay hours . 
  when i was playing the demo i could n't notice anything that would limit me . 
  only thing that i noticed was the lack of choice of car brands , but that is very very irrelevant . 
  ** tl : dr ** euro truck simulator is a fantastic game which simulates truck driving very well . 
  it is one of the best simulator games out there , imo the best . 
  you can try the free demo which offers tons of content . 
  first of all do n't get me wrong , red orchestra 2 and rising storm are both amazing games . 
  you can read good ysb from [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shouldibuythisgame/comments/1jczgn/ysb_rising_storm_on_steam/ ) , and i do n't bother writing one by myself . 
  the reason why you should n't buy ro2 is that if you buy rs you also get full access to ro2 multiplayer . 
  however , you wo n't get access to ro2 single-player , but that does n't matter since it 's just bots in multiplayer maps . 
  however , if you buy only ro2 , you also get access to rs , but you can only play with rifleman class and you do n't gain more level or weapons . 
  americans have semi-auto garand in rifleman class but as a `` f2p '' player you can only play with inferior springfield . 
  ** tl ; dr ** you should n't buy ro2 because you get multiplayer access to both games when you buy rs , and singleplayer is utterly crap . 
  ** edit !!!!!, 
  ** [ it seems like you get rs cheaper if you buy ro2 first . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedeals/comments/1jcxjd/steam_midweek_madness_rising_storm_50_off_red/cbdep5f ) i ca n't confirm if it goes -75 % off if you buy ro2 now , but i believe so . 
  someone please confirm this . 
  have you always wanted to play realistic shooter which require teamwork and tactics , but arma just did n't have it ? 
  or did you play battlefield 3 in a hope that you would get true tactical shooter where teamwork is essential , but got disappointed ? 
  well i have a solution for you : project reality . 
  project reality is a mod for battlefield 2 , which has been in development for 8 years . 
  beta stage finally ended few days ago . 
  as the name suggests , the goal was to make as realistic game as possible for battlefield 2 . 
  battlefield 2 , just like rest of the bf franchise , is generally an arcade shooter on a large scale which requires some teamwork . 
  pr however , takes the bf concept of class-based shooter on large maps with teamwork , and makes it realistic . 
  almost everything has been changed from bf2 . 
  only some voice acting and squad screen are similar to bf2 . 
  so , what makes this this game realistic ? 
  the game is true test of teamwork . 
  if you do n't want to play with other people with microphone , do n't even bother trying this game . 
  do n't worry , the community is very good , helpful and noob-friendly . 
  you only need to join squad and say you 're a noob and you need some help with the game . 
  also , there 's an in-game voice chat called mumble , so you do n't need teamspeak or anything . 
  keep your squad members informed all the time . 
  if you spot an enemy , you say something like `` i spotted enemy at 120 at the second floor , about 75 meters , requesting to open fire '' . 
  also , if you need medic , ammo , questions etc , you ask from squad members . 
  also , there is also local chat which allows you to talk friendlies nearby , even if they 're not in your squad . 
  use this if you need revive and you want to guide medics . 
  firing guns is quite different when compared to other games . 
  it takes couple seconds before you can shoot accurately when you stop moving , and firing full-auto is very inaccurate . 
  also , bullets are very lethal . 
  you can take about 1-2 bullets before you get shot down . 
  if you get shot down you still can be revived . 
  reviving is a long process : it takes about 20 seconds . 
  so if you have enemies nearby , do n't expect to get revived soon . 
  if you have n't been revived after 5 mins you got shot down , you will bleed to death . 
  also , if you get killed by tank shell or something like that you usually ca n't be revived . 
  vehicles are also very lethal , but they are much harder to use . 
  you ca n't escape a tank just by hopping around - it will kill you if he spots you . 
  but there is a twist how this is `` balanced '' : at rounds are much more lethal and you ca n't repair your vehicle on the field . 
  you must go to hq repair depot . 
  also , ammo is limited and you must resupply at hq . 
  now you might ask `` well , if you can take down tanks easily then why do n't you spam the at class ? '', 
  the answer easy : class limitations . 
  there are many classes in pr . 
  most of them use the same rifle , which is faction specific . 
  germans use g36s , americans m4s , israeli tar-21s , insurgent factions use ak47s . . also , you usually have alternative version of that class , which is carbine version , different sight , or even different gun sometimes . 
  however , different classes have different equipment . 
  rifleman , which is the basic class , can used by everybody at anytime . 
  he has an ammo pack which has limited amount of extra ammo .
