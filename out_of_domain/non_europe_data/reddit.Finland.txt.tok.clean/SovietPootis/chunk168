  ** tl ; dr ** i have all of my ranked soldiers at sickbay + mecd , the game slaps a council mission and ufo crash site for the same day . 
  on the second month . 
  and i think about killing myself once again . 
  seriously , this is infuriating . 
  there are times when i just want to sit on my computer and play some ps2 after a hard day . 
  i log in to my computer and . . nope !, 
  still doing some patching . 
  and let me guess : even when you unlock these servers , many , if not most the players will experience the infamous 98 % bug . 
  and when you * finally * manage to log in to a server , you should already be grabbin ' some sleep . 
  now , i understand that you yankees deserve to be in priority because of freedom and hamburgers , but please , why ca n't some of your employees wake up during 2am and start rollin ' in the patch when we europoors are going to do our jobs . 
  i mean , it really would n't require * that * much of an effort , would it ? 
  join in if you 're fancy for some mp . 
  first come , first serve !, 
  [ here 's the link ] ( http://reddit_xcom.challonge.com/tournaments/signup/mn8hbsengj ), 
  edit : i guess that 's it . . but if more people would want to participate in , i guess that the host could make some extra slots . . right ? 
  so , here 's the deal : xcomleague.com is setting up a big xcom mp tournament ; up to 32 players . 
  they 're currently struggling to get some additional players , because mp scene is almost dead : only a handful of dedicated players are playing the mp . 
  so , if you think that you have guts to test your skills against the top-tier mp players , then come and join us !, 
  the clan itself is russian , but do n't be afraid to participate in : the tournament itself is international . 
  the biggest xcom mp youtuber [ firewatergasoline ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfloo_pyq2q&list=uukmbb2q04shettusyeevzzq ) is also joining in , so it could be your time to shine in youtube if you end up against him . 
  as for every good tournament , there 's also [ some prizes ] ( http://xcomleague.com/threads/%d0%a2%d1%83%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%80-%d0%ad%d1%82%d0%be-%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%be-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%87%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%be-just-the-beginning-tournament.53/ ) for the very best players . . and losers will get some valuable experience !, 
  [ here 's the link where you can register  ( http://xcomleague.com/threads/%d0%a2%d1%83%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%80-%d0%ad%d1%82%d0%be-%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%be-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%87%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%be-just-the-beginning-tournament.52/ ) just follow those directions and comment something to the thread !, 
  * good luck , commander . 
  seriously mods , wtf ? 
  there are tons of great screenshots and then you decide to slap something like that on the banner . . just why ? 
  so my request is pretty simple ; can somebody link me pro match which was casted in swedish ? 
  props for newer matches and for those in which casters get excited and start shouting like crazy . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  so , the story is short and bitter ; the game is 14 15 on nuke . 
  we were playing the ct side . 
  we mow down ts as they push in to a. 
  the game is now 5vs1 , meaning that we won the round , right ? 
  not in this case unfortunately . 
  even though i practically yelled to my teammates that `` go a , secure the bomb and watch all directions , do n't chase him down '' , they simply did n't listen . 
  as my practical yelling turned into actual yelling my teammates just kept chasing him down ; ramp , hut . . they all got picked one by one and soon the game was 2vs1 . 
  my teammate who actually listened to me got picked from an angle which either of us did n't watch . 
  and then he proceeded to pick me with a nice headshot , and we lost the round , and the game , which should have been a trivial victory . 
  while chasing the last guy down might a good idea but on the last round ** there 's not a single good reason ** to chase that guy down . 
  you put yourselves on a stupid risk by giving him a stupid chance to clutch the round . 
  if you are going to chase him down make sure that your economy is good and someone on your team has enough time to run away if everything goes ape shit . 
  remember , there 's no nice 1vs5 wins . 
  there 's only stupid 5vs1 losses . 
  man , this game is just awesome . 
  i have always sucked in rts games because microing is just absurdly difficult for me , but i find these game mechanics really enjoyable . 
  microing perhaps is n't as hard as it was in c&c titles but i still fail to get a grasp on it . 
  i usually get shrekt when i play some mp but when i play against other noobs . . well , i usually get owned nevertheless but i feel like i 'm slowly learning new things and i actually won my first 1vs1 match !, 
  oh well , my opponent got pretty frustrated when i picked some of his good units and then he just full yoloed with his tanks and uhm . . easy pickings i suppose , 
  anyway , i am slowly learning new things and it 's fairly relieving that i can play against other noobs consecutively so we 're all having fair matches . 
  just wanted to say that even though i played against some of the best xcom players in the world ( not much to brag about but who cares ) , rts is just a concept that i 'm willing to learn properly this time around . 
  so , i 'm pretty new to this game . 
  my 2nd prison failed since prisoners started a massive riot and a lot of prisoners died in the process . 
  i assume that one of them had instigator trait , but it was hidden so how i should have discovered that with informants , right ? 
  anyway , how can i use informants to prevent this stuff ? 
  and are there any other effective ways to stop rioting ? 
  so , i 'm thinking about buying a laptop for school . 
  acer aspire v3-112p seems to fulfill all my needs - it 's small ( 11 ' 6 ) , costs only 300 $ , has 4 gigs of ram , 500gb hdd , and even a touchscreen , which is a big plus . 
  it seems that this laptop would be perfect for typing - and even for some * very * low-end gaming . 
  i have some questions , though . 
  first of all , ** how noisy is this thing ? 
  ** i do n't have too much experience about laptops but i 've heard that some low-end models might be . . noisy . 
  if the laptop sounds like a jet engine then it 's obviously a no-go . 
  my laptop must be silent , so my fellow undergraduates would n't be disturbed by the sound of the fan . 
  ** what about the processor ? 
  ** sure , n3530 sucks ass but for 300 $ you really ca n't expect too much , can you ? 
  but this process is surely powerful enough to handle basic tasks smoothly , right ? 
  so far i 've found that v3-112p gives most for bang for my buck . 
  ** are there any better alternatives ? 
  ** if you can show me a better alternative in my region ( finland ) for < 300 $ then please , show it to me . 
  spawning directly to vehicles is a gameplay mechanic that was introduced in bf4 . 
  one of its goal was to prevent players from camping in their main base , spamming e and wait to vehicles to spawn . 
  it also allowed us to have jet maps without airfields . 
  however , the mechanic has caused more trouble than it has prevented . 
  there are reasons for that , let me explain . 
  1 ) you ca n't repair vehicles on your main base because someone will spawn on it and take it ( and most likely either waste it or crash it immediately ) . 
  everybody who has played classic/hardcore knows this feeling . 
  once you 've taken a bit of a licking , you just need to repair your vehicle . 
  the main base is the safest place to do it ( well , at least it should be ) , but you simply ca n't do it because some fool thinks that everything he touches is his , ignores all of your tells to leave and , well , crash it in less than 15 seconds because it 's his very first time flying the chopper . 
  and if you are a jet pilot things are even worse for you - sometimes main base is the only place where you can put down your plane , and there is nothing more frustrating to see than someone taking it and ramming it to a wall . 
  2 ) in the past , if you wanted to take a jet , you had to spawn to your main base , run to the jet and take it , take off and then fly where-ever you want . 
  now you just skip the whole process !, 
  now , why is this a bad thing ? 
  because it is the fastest way to get around . 
  people just use it as a taxi , wasting the whole thing !, 
  and the thing is that there are actually people who want to properly use this vehicle . 
  if you could n't spawn to it directly , people would use jeeps and such to get around , and jets would be mostly preserved for those who actually wanted to use them . 
  3 ) it 's just not the main base that is affected by the mechanic . . you see , if you see a vehicle parked at enemy flag , you must either destroy it or take it yourself instead of just . . guarding it since you can spawn directly in it . 
  now , it 's not an issue if you have some c4 with you but if you are alone , have no explosives remaining/at all , and are under circumstances that you ca n't take it , you 're toast . 
  i do give credit dice for this idea and implementing it , but unfortunately it did n't turn out so well . 
  it 's also unfortunate that you ca n't revert this change since maps are designed in a way that having parked jets is not possible . 
  so i bought the game as soon as i saw it on early access . . and it was amazing !, 
  then i bought a g27 . . and the experience became even better ( albeit i suck with the wheel ) . 
  but now the recent update broke the game for me . 
  much to my dismay i 've been experiencing the infamous error 41 for the past two days , and i have n't figured how to solve it . 
  verifying the integrity of the game ? 
  nope , did n't do a damn thing . 
  since the game is on ea , is there anything else i could do than sit around and hope for the best ? 
  it 'll get eventually fixed , that 's for sure . . 
  courtenay taylor is indeed a very talented voice actor , and her performance in xcom was quite remarkable . 
  yes , she had her ups and downs but overall her role was . . memorable . 
  but wait , who 's the character that we 're talking about ?
