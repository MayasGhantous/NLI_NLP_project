  i think this is much better . 
  just think about this way : your faction color is red , bases etc are red too , your enemies text is red , your minimap shows all friendlies blue , enemies red , and your cap points and friendly name texts are green . 
  this was very confusing when i played this game . 
  i think it 's better that everything is red . 
  red = good guy . 
  not red = bad guy . 
  atleast the games are much cheaper and you do n't require always-on connection . 
  i bet they will add mod support to it too . 
  nah , they 're just not op anymore . 
  this is not cringe . 
  please , read [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/10cg0c/okay_rcringe_we_need_to_have_a_talk/ ) post . 
  i hate to admit it but vs was best faction on miller before ues . . what happened ? 
  i think that maybe tobuscus should 've been the vanu leader after all . . 
  that would be perfectly balanced !, 
  i expected reaver at mine bombing . 
  oh well , this is nice too . 
  slap a suppressor to it - it sounds like it fires faster after that . 
  you fascist !, 
  damn , me too : /, 
  edit : everything is fine now . 
  this peasant must be a troll . 
  a true peasant does n't even know what a graphic card is . 
  so that 's why nc has done well lately . . 
  i can confirm this . 
  i was once going to repair a generator after we successfully defended our amp station . 
  i looked around like 30 seconds is there any proxies . 
  after that i walked in there and boom . 
  i nearly shat myself . 
  yeah , proxies and betties need a nerf . 
  not only they are more effective than claymores , they are also much harder to spot , almost impossible . 
  they 've said that they will continue optimization even after this patch . 
  you should make a video about that !, 
  i can only imagine you speaking that with your calm , slightly horny voice . 
  fuck you , i will * never * trade away my turbo !, 
  no , because without my turbo i 'm like . . i 'm like . . 
  tell me more about those spinners . 
  it 's your loss . 
   engie - ammo bandolier, 
  it seems like you have too many certs, 
  but with flash turbo you can * fly . . * i mainly use this for lulz but it can be useful too . 
  for example , if you find a small rock you can use it and jump over the amp station walls . 
  you can be a communist in a first world country . 
  you wo n't regret your choice . 
  just remember to explore , do all sidequests , talk to everybody . 
  do n't collect the minerals in me1 !, 
  it will be waste of your time . 
  also , once you come to me3 , remember to download all free dlc and play some multiplayer . 
  it will be extremely fun . 
  if you wan na buy some dlc get the lair of the shadow broker for me2 . 
  it is a must-buy and should 've included in the trilogy . 
  also , the arrival dlc explains what happens between me2 and me3 . 
  for me3 , if you want some story dlc get the from ashes and leviathan . 
  after you 've finished with the trilogy come check the [ r/masseffect ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect ) . 
  we have a really nice subreddit . 
  you fascist scum , [ here is some communistic brainwashing for you !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ydrtner_5m ), 
  the turbo got `` buffed '' again , because the turbo was unintentionally nerfed . 
  [ no , your friend is a fascist ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/18/article-1097324-02d766c1000005dc-602_468x314.jpg ), 
  this is great news !, 
  cosmetics in this game are mainly very dull , and i 'd like to see some gas-masks for tr , something like [ this ] ( http://gamercrash.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/killzone3box_24872_screen.jpg ) . 
  we should have also something like steam workshop where people could see these items and vote their favourites , and the best ones gets released . 
  tell me , was the crown more easy to attack ? 
  cause the lack of fights anywhere than the crown is killing the game atm for me . 
  ti alloys . 
  crossroads . 
  crown . 
  nothing else . 
  i do n't know about you , but if i get more awarded from doing other things then i would do them more often . 
  killing is the best source of xp atm ( expect destroying sundies , maybe ) . 
  but i am sure that many people would think other way . 
  but , if they figure out that if i capture areas i will get rewarded better , and i should do that , then everybody would be more happy . 
  the goal of this game is to capture and hold territory , not farm some certs !, 
  and the continent design is indeed quite poor , but you will not get a fix for this soon . 
  unless you wipe the crown and some other annoying bases off . 
  but here 's a question : if you get cure for your symptom is it better than living in pains ? 
  i think yes . 
  maybe they want to wait so they could just keep getting more xp ? 
  i do n't understand why to just * kill * people with no good reason . 
  or maybe you are just right . 
  i know that , but this is not the same . 
  now you get kicked if you afk , you would still gain resources and you must have 4 + facilities to actually gain certs . 
  xp boost would n't work , atleast not so effective . 
  did you know that we already have an xp boost per continent ? 
  i do not want to move people away from indar , i want to move them away from crown . 
  all fighting on indar is mainly focused on crown . 
  here on miller , we do have big fights at esamir during peak hours . 
  and at there , there is not such a place where people want to have it at all costs . 
  do you know what 's more fun ? 
  killing vs maxes , 
  read the whole post and other comments . . 
  that would be an overkill then . 
  i mean , if you buy 12 ( or 6 , ca n't remember which one ) months of membership , it costs 9 euroes per month . 
  if you 'd buy station cash with that money you would get 1000sc . 
  so , maybe 1000sc is slightly too much . 
  of course it would be very nice but . . yeah . 
  thirty euroes . 
  20 $ was spent on 3x sc day . 
  yup , i 'm a cheap guy, 
  700 sounds fine . 
  if i played vanu i 'd pay 500 smedbucks for that .
