  wrex is awesome in every situation . 
  he is like a big bro for everybody ( expect for garrus , of course ) . 
  there is . 
  he just did n't record them . 
  i have n't noticed it here on miller . 
  though i almost never fight on andvari though . . 
  dubstep is awful , gameplay is not good and there is too much editing . 
  this is one of those `` cod montages '' that are just rubbish . 
  [ here 's what i saw when i saw this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlkxdq9fk8a ), 
  so , next time do a montage when something special actually happens , do n't do too much edit and choose better music . 
  sure , i could replace it with `` owned '' or `` served '' , but i though word `` trolled '' actually fitted well in this situation . 
  but you are right after all , it is quite bad word . 
  here on miller this game is not called indarside 2 . 
  esamir has almost the same population as the indar does , sometimes more , sometimes less . 
  on prime time there is 50 % of the time enemy platoons state base on mani bio lab . 
  no worries , here on miller esamir has healthy pop and i will continue playing in there . 
  i do not know are these listed but . . 
  - vehicles have extra camouflage , atleast on mossy, 
  - tower vehicle spawn room is different, 
  you should get the mass effect trilogy . 
  those are games that everybody should play . 
  [ here 's the proof ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvqyn2rjfva ), 
  first game has some problems like graphics are n't very nice and the combat is poor but the story is just amazing . 
  mass effect 2 fixed those problems and it won 17 goty awards , and mass effect 3 continues the succession of me2 . 
  you should absolutely play this trilogy , it is just mind-blowing !, 
  do n't worry , i will stay loyal to planetside ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ dice ^ ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ bf2143, 
  i 've played 250 hours of this game and i have never been killed by that weapon . 
  . . is it mentioned anywhere that miranda can live 300 years ? 
  but 150 years is not an average , is n't it ? 
  i remember shepard saying liara that we are * lucky * if we hit 150, 
  imagine there are other people like you . 
  not exactly like you , because they do have different face , skin , body weight etc. 
  and the sharing is that you give each other stuff , stuff like food or tools , or even ideas . 
  now you might think what 's the point of it ? 
  well , you will become friends who will become allies then . 
  if you are together you can survive better against wild animals or nature . 
  also if you put your wise minds together you will create new ideas and create them if it 's possible . 
  you see , in your wild world surviving alone is going to be hard . 
  if you was n't the only one you would have better chance to survive . 
  if you give food to wild animals , for example for a goat , they might start following you around and give you some milk !, 
  or if you give you some food to wolves they might think you are their leader and you will become their leader . 
  i do not recommend trying because well , wolves probably will tear you apart and the genocide of humanity is finished . 
  we already had crazy legs , i suppose i should 've expect this one coming . 
  ffs this is the 4th modern day shooter from dice in a row !, 
  first it was ww2 - vietnam - modern day - future . 
  not it is modern day - modern day - modern day - modern day, 
  i am so dissapointed . 
  oh well , atleast i do have planetside 2 . 
  it is not bf but it feels more bf than bf3 ( and bf4 prob . ), 
  maybe on indar and amerish , but you guys are doing shit on esamir . 
  yes you should , but consider buying battlefield : bad company 2 instead . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shouldibuythisgame/comments/199z8x/ysb_battlefield_bad_company_2_instead_of/ ) is my post which tells you should buy bc2 instead . 
  i wanted to see this repost . 
  take * that * you filthy fascist !, 
  i have only 160 smedbucks left . 
  i need moar !, 
  atleast his goal is to destroy op american military . . 
  planetside 1 did have 3 man tanks , and i think they were fine . 
  i havent played ps1 though , so i am not 100 % sure . 
  one thing i know is that ps2 is heavily marketed for bf vets , and devs are slowly turning this game from bf like to original ps like . 
  maybe we will see 3 man tanks in the future ? 
  highly unlikely , but it is plausible . 
  first i recommend trying the original game , which is completely free . 
  jagex bought the license and made their own version . 
  jagexs version lacked the `` classic '' mode when the game was launched . 
  fans demanded it and jagex finally added it to the game . 
  [ here 's the original ace of spades ] ( http://buildandshoot.com/ ), 
  and i though i was a good pilot . . 
  what hell march remix is this ? 
  i expected that flash would fly . . oh well, 
  vega is twice more popular than tali ? 
  i do not believe in that . 
  everybody likes tali . 
  she is symphetic character and the mystery behind the mask makes her very interesting character . 
  maybe if you have n't played me1 & 2 then you do n't know her pilgrimage etc. . . which can make her less interesting . 
  my best bet though is that you get tali to your squad very late , and these numbers are based on how many times you choose x character to your squad . 
  that would explain the low popularity of kaidan and ashley too . 
  it depends completely what genre you do prefer . 
  i 'm sure they are not like these on competitive league . . ? 
  yes, 
  # 2 is going to be fixed and i suggested # 3 but i was downvoted to hell . 
  welcome to the master race ( and reddit ) my brother !, 
  t2 striker , here i come !, 
   rocket launchers that fire clusters of shotguns strapped to a rocket, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_sy4txtjjy&amp;t=0m37s ), 
  i ca n't choose my favourite . 
  original squad ( wrex , garrus , tali , liara ) are all my favourites !, 
  mass effect 2 final mission is one of the best ones out there . 
  you should go for bioshock infinite . 
  it is getting hammered by top ratings everywhere . 
  i have not played neither one of those but bioshock 1 was a great game . 
  tomb raider seems like that it 's a good game but it 's quite linear and the story is n't amazing . 
  infinite however seems like it 's a masterpiece . 
  you did good son , you did good . 
  i 'm . . proud of you . 
  the mission was good because of how complex all outcomes were . 
  try searching that image from google which shows all possibilities and effects of decisions . 
  miller also here , i have no problems at all . 
  i recommend you to buy mass effect trilogy . 
  it has amazing story and you have huge replay value because you can play it as a paragon , which has big morale and renegade who takes care of things brutally .
