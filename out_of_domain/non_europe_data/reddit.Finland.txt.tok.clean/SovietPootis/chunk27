  they last for two hours and there is a notion that next alert starts in next 10 minutes . 
  currently there is only one type of alert and it is capture x continent . 
  if you are fighting in that continent you will gain 20 % xp during the alert . 
  if you manage to capture the continent you will win the alert and gain 10k xp . 
  if not , then the winner is that empire which has the largest chunk of land when the alert ends . 
  10k xp will be shared with all empires depending how many % each of them had . 
  winners do not gain any extra xp , only, 
  so far i have not seen a single continent capture yet , but the fights are very intense !, 
  yesterday there was an alert on amerish . 
  tr had 35 % of land and nc had 33 % . 
  i was defending a base which was getting annihilated by nc . 
  1 minute remaining . 
  i was in a flank , unnoticed . 
  i had a chance to capture one of the points and secure the victory for tr . 
  but my greed was stronger and i went and destroyed an unguarded sunderer . 
  then i got killed after that . 
  guess what ? 
  nc captured the base in the bloody last second and nc won the alert . 
  so sorry guys , it was my fault . 
  maybe soe is so confident that you are hacking because their cheat detection failed and some people who you killed reported you from hacking and told other people to report through / re or / orders . 
  anyway , this is [ unacceptable . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07so_ljqyqw ) soe should be very skeptical if you are a paying customer and you are being reported by hacking . 
  keep spamming messages to forums and to soe , and you will get noticed . 
  soe ca n't simply ignore stuff like this or they will lose some potential customers . 
  hmm . . your server seems to have different skill tree than i do . 
  [ this is our skill tree in my server . 
  ] ( http://www.suensaari.tornio.fi/lukio/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;itemid=52 ), 
  they were features , not bugs . 
  people did n't like those features so devs added stuff like [ modern health care ] , [ vaccine ] and [ modern drugs ] . 
  some of those bad features are still present on some servers , just because the devs are so lazy . 
  actually , tr is more popular than nc on miller . 
  most of the it is like vs 28 - tr 36 - nc 36 but it is more common to see 40 % tr than 40 % nc . 
  hmm . . could be the case . 
  tr is the active when big stuff happens . 
  i am almost 100 % sure that 's not replica of any me gun . . first i though it was a tempest but it looks too much like a pistol . 
  [ oh god d  ( http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b374/thejizzlobber/surprise.gif?t=1249346731 ), 
  you should also get medical kits . 
  the first level costs only 50 certs so it is worth it . 
  i personally feel like claymores are not so useful as the medical kit is . 
  i am one of those lone wolf snipers who tries to flank or get behind enemy lines . 
  sometimes you get shot and after you manage to survive the encounter you usually have low hp . . being far away from teammates means that med kit can save you later . 
  sure claymores give you some extra xp but the survivability is more important imo . 
  also if you are sniping far away your clays wo n't do titties . 
  stock cloak is much better than the hunter cloak . 
  you gain small amount of damage protection when using hunter cloak but the cloak drains a lot faster . 
  you can go to vr area and test it by yourself . 
  i use the ammo perk for my solo infil . 
  it was pretty much essential some patches ago before we gained 2 extra mags per loadout , but still , it is very useful . 
  ooh , official app  the non-officials ones were quite terrible . 
  first impressions : you guys have done a great job . 
  i have n't noticed so far any issues . 
  you should go and check out [ mirror 's edge . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n1tjp1cxmo ), 
  basically it is a parkour game which is something very unique . 
  unfortunately it has quite short campaign but it is definitely worth your money . 
  i see some bad experience about this page . 
  i should remove thid post then i guess . 
  i was resupplying my infantry gear and then suddenly i noticed her doing that . 
  i tried to do that again but it just did n't work . 
  i guess it just randomly happens . 
  i assume they added it to game unfinished but then they realized it 's not so good idea but they forgot to remove it .

  during the whole easter weekend nc and vs worked in smooth harmony so they would remove our cont lock . 
  guess what ? 
  they did fail . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/a/k4zgw#0 ) some pics if you are interested in . 
  we had 50 % of the continent before nc started pushing us . . 
  so which faction atv is this ? 
  i hope they would add faction specifics , the ns ones just . . suck . 
  i ca n't find the post but somebody made fan-art models for es flashes . 
  tr gets motorbikes , nc gets current flash and vs gets small hovercraft . 
  nah , tr is all about speed . 
  a sidecart would just slow it down . 
  perhaps make it optional ? 
  max speed without a cart - 100 . 
  with - 80 . 
  in my first playthrough everybody survived . 
  i though i could get the happy ending in me3 . 
  too bad , tali did a suicide and i got the vaporize ending . . 
  i recommend getting x-com enemy unknown . 
  imo civ 5 and x-com are the best tbs games out there . 
  yes you should , absolutely !, 
  i ca n't recommend enough hitman games . 
  is the codename 47 included in the trilogy ? 
  if so , just skip it . 
  it 's not worth your time .

  am i the only one who is an active pilot and does n't get bothered by this bug ? 
  i know tf2 system . 
  it 's quite good but the bf2 commo rose is the best imo . 
  it just was perfect . 
  pressing q pops up [ regular commo rose ] ( http://bfstuff.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/commo-rose-610x225.png ) , while the t pops up [ squad leader commo rose ] ( http://bf3blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bf3-commo-rose.jpg ) . 
  while holding q/t you just quickly move your mouse and click what you want to say . 
  [ commo-rose in action , 2142 version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwyuyejfonm ) ( which is pretty much the same than bf2 version ),

  if you buy your own pc you should invest like 1000 $ and you have a system that will run everything atleast on medium or few years . 
  in moments like these i wish humanity would focus more on science rather killing each other : /, 
  i made tr ha guide on steam , go check that out,
