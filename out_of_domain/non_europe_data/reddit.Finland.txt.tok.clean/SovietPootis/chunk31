  also , [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qmcevpv9n4 ), 
  yes you should . 
  it is really exciting game . 
  but you should get the gods & kings expansion so you can get the most out of it . 
  [ here 's the gold edition for 15 $ ] ( http://www.cdkeys.com/pc/games/civilization-v-5-gold-edition-pc-cd-key ), 
  even though ms is a scumbag we are dependent on windows . . :(, 
  not battlefield 3 though . 
  it feels like that everybody is just trying to improve their k/d ratio and not giving a shit about ptfo . 
  maybe you can get it for 12 $ , but i do not think it 's worth the wait, 
  it 's still ms. 
   notice the colors and physics shared between the trailers , the focus on team-based gameplay and class interplay , and the rock/paper/scissors game play that is the battlefield hallmark . 
  you do n't see any of that in the official battlefield trailers : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfrrap1blam, 
  and the new bf is nothing but scripted scenes . . 
  i miss my sp bots . 
  it 's the only sp that i want . 
  hmm . . that 's a shame . 
  in me2 & 3 theme is that robots are not necessarily evil . 
  me3 has been on sale for multiple times in origin . 
  you can buy it for $ 20 or wait until becomes $ 10 . 
  the game is definitely worth $ 20 . 
  but i expect it will soon drop to $ 10 . 
  you 'd better upgrade that frigate to battleship . 
  magnificent . 
  i am bf vet and i am done with this series . 
  or atleast i will skip bf4 and come back when they release a game set in different era and/or has mod tools in it . 
  unless bf4 is actually really different from bf4 . 
  single-player footage says otherwise . 
  chinese and commander are in it but those will not make me grab the game . 
  i have to see some mp footage and then i will make my final decision . 
  fake , every vanu has a latex butt . . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ecvdin5.jpg ) a screenshot i took from test server, 
  1000sc and available for all classes expect for max . 
  i doubt they have changed it . 
  [ here 's r/masseffect dlc guide .

  i remember in my game my allied city state captured enemy city state and it did n't raze it . 
  well done !, 
  now give yourself a challenge and try to win in king . 
  i must disagree . 
  i love my dreadnought helmet even though it would look better with composite armor . 
  imo infil is not-so-silly after al. 
  close your eyes until the spinning stops . 
  problem solved . 
  hurry , hurry mr. 
  bubbles !, 
  that thing is definitely not worth $ 2000 . 
  i am not american so i am not 100 % sure about the prices . 
  if you build something like that by yourself it would cost something like $ 1200 dollars . 
  just build yourself a pc !, 
  it is like building legoes . 
  after you have to do some research but it is not so hard thing to do . 
  also , it is exciting when you learn about components . 
  and you will also save a hefty amount of money !, 
  edit : i answered wrong to your question . 
  i personally do not think that 's a so great build . 
  [ well done mister ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/well_done_sir.gif ), 
  i barely see the difference when compared to digital camo . 
  oh god . . 
  i had the problem but it works now again . 
  edit : nope, 
  nope, 
  i have 2 suggestions :, 
  heavy tank, 
  this tank would be bigger , slower , could deal and take much more damage . 
  heavy tank would have separate tank gunner and driver , just like in planetside 1 . 
  current tanks would be called medium tanks . 
  so , heavy tanks would be more effective if they were used by dedicated gunner and pilot . 
  medium tanks would be better for those who prefer to play solo or feel more comfortable when they have the full control of the tank . 
  battlewalker, 
  my second suggestion comes straight from battlefield 2142 . 
  [ this ] ( http://bf2142.free-gfx.com/bf2142_vehicles/bf2142_eu_vehicles/eu_battlewalker_l5_riesig/battlewalker_l5riesig_01.png ) walking death machine has a driver and a gunner . 
  the driver has 2 miniguns ( or 2 plasma cannons for pac variant ) which are excellent with gunning down infantry in pretty much all ranges . 
  he also has rocket pods which makes you win almost every 1vs1 tank fight on longer ranges but are almost completely uses at longer ranges . 
  the gunner controls top turret which is good gunning down infantry but also good taking down aircraft . 
  it 's pretty much like g30 walker . 
  he also has 2 emp cannons which will disable enemy aircraft for few seconds which can cause the aircraft to crash . 
  the walker is clearly designed for close-quarters but you can still take down infantry & aircraft from longer ranges . 
  ** marv assembly complete .

  civ 5 is really amazing game . 
  but here 's some things you should keep in mind :, 
  - the games are really long . 
  on normal speed the matches are 2-6 hours . 
  if you do not like to sit around and wait for long times then this game is not for you . 
  - gods & kings expansion adds tons of new content to the game , and you must get it if you like the game . 
  also there is new expansion called brave new world coming which also adds tons of new features to the game . 
  - gandhi is an asshole . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.go2arena.com/civilization-v-gods-kings-1.html ) gk for 8 $ . 
  planetside 2 has quite mature community . 
  we do taunt enemy team but that is just mainly circlejerking , nothing very serious . 
  we also have lots of mature platoons which are dedicated for teamwork .
