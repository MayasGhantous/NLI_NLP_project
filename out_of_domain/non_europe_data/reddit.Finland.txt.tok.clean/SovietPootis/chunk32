  if you live in europe come here in miller . 
  if you live in east coast stay the f * ck away from mattherson . 
  we need admiral title - my name is incomplete without it, 
  because it 's a [ repost ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1dm4lg/civilization_5_brave_new_world_gameplay_with_adam/ ), 
  the problem i see with this is that it 's very boring . 
  but still , i am tempted to try this once . 
  [ splendid . 
  ] ( http://files.sharenator.com/slow_clap_re_i_dont_care-s420x315-139732.gif ), 
  tr tactical superiority . 
  we like to call this tactic `` orbital bombarment . '', 
  i have n't played either of those but i can promise you that fc3 and blood dragon have nothing in common when it comes to story . 
  the weapons are different too . 
  [ faster stronger better gaben ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9rrs32ctqk ), 
  i must partly disagree with this . 
  a good sniper can wait until the target stops and then shoot the target before it starts moving again . 
  a great sniper can reliably land moving target headshots . 
  it 's a great game but not as good as me2 was . 
  but still it 's worth getting it . 
  but you need to get those save files . 
  the game without save files is absolutely terrible when compared to a game with save files . 
  you can try [ this ] ( http://www.masseffect2saves.com/ ) site and get a save file that matches your one . 
  test server is meant for testing . 
  devs announce when they have a playtest ( which happens about 2 times a month ) and the fights there are pretty good . 
  devs also tell us what to test ( last time it was harasser and max stuff . ), 
  so i believe the test server is successful . 
  arma is a war simulator . 
  arma tries to be as realistic as possible , sacrificing balance or even gameplay . 
  in arma you can easily run around for 30 minutes and then suddenly get shot by a sniper and you have no idea where that shot came from . 
  it is not typical shooter where you have mp gamemodes . 
  you just mainly do co-op missions with your buddy . 
  [ crazy legs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pseyek1hkcw ), 
  tmg-50 does have single-fire . 
  goodbye 2143 then i guess . 
  if they release something set in future era i doubt they would release another one shortly . 
  plus 2143 would compete against battlefront 3 . 
  the best scenario would be that both games will get released . 
  this is irrelevant but how do you have a milk can as your flair ? 
  an inside joke then , huh . 
  i can deal with it . 
  omg nerf vs plz so op, 
  pc version has a level editor . 
  you can play maps created by the community . 
  there are currently 251k community maps available . 
  also you can go creative and make your own map . 
  also portal 2 had some free multi-player dlc but i do not know if it was just pc exclusive . 
  so is it worth the full price ? 
  imo no , because you have already played the full game . 
  but buying it from sale for 5 $ is worth it if you are interested in playing those community maps . 
  i think we can count it as futuristic because it has very advanced technology . 
  slap some camo and it will look better . 
  atleast with non-infil classes . 
  in destroy ending all synthetic life gets killed , not just the bodies . 
  that guy is finnish ex-presidents husband . 
  i have bad feeling that this is a setup scene . . 
  if your child dies and you decide to make another one , can you call it the same ? 
  i should change the faction then . . 
  get them both . 
  they both are truly amazing games , and you should play them both . 
  but first , get mass effect trilogy . 
  it has 60-80 hours campaign while bioshock : infinite offers 15 hours . 
  both of them have massive replay value too . 
  yes, 
  is it deep-fried ? 
  then stop showing me that damn diet food !, 
  [ postal 2 . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwqdf-ibn0 ) even though it is outdated it is quite fun ( for atleast 20 minutes ) . 
  you just do everyday jobs such as buying milk etc. . 
  the style is free , just go and get the job done . 
  remember , the game is as violent as you are . 
  i used to be a damn commie but r/murica enlighmented me . 
  i hate that guy . 
  tr already has a [ team captain ] ( http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/3/39/team_captain_soldier.png ) . 
  getting a [ bill 's hat ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/e/ee/bill's_hat.png/250px-bill's_hat.png ) is not a problem either , i guess . 
  [ i 'm wondering what tr gets after that . . ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/list_of_soldier_cosmetics ), 
  definitely manage them by yourself . 
  automated workers just keep spamming mainly trading posts . 
  while they are not so bad you should still mainly build farms and mines . 
  he suddenly pops out of nowhere with his bloody scythe when i 'm strolling on foot . . 
  and shooting him down alone is pretty much impossible . 
  and when the backup arrives he just flees and waits until he can come back again . 
  he 's a good pilot . 
  too good . 
  i would say that i am a good pilot . 
  in bf3 i used to be in top 1000 before i got fed up with it . 
  i am good pilot in ps2 although but i do not fly that much . 
  i have n't 1vs1 artorius yet . . maybe i could beat him . 
  i do n't know . 
  and i meant that shooting him down alone from ground is pretty much impossible . 
  we need a playtest and then see how that goes . 
  but i agree with you , the cap time is too fast . 
  it needs to be faster but not as fast as this . 
  he lifts, 
  . . but i play tr :(, 
  but that would look good indeed . 
  i listen pretty much anything than dubstep . 
  imo dubstep is n't even music . 
  is that . . is that rpg-7 ? 
  damn commie !, 
  dat red beret . 
  amen .
