  devs visit actively on that subreddit and take directly requests and really listens our feedback . 
  also , we have quite amazing community there . 
  expect to have 30fps at the largest battles . 
  yes, 
  [ k\u00e5 ] ( http://samwinkworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/man-boobs.jpg ), 
  over 9000, 
  how is that even possible ? 
  but still , 412 turn golden age . . 
  so i can have internet without computers ? 
  nice . 
  i 'm wondering what piety and commerce looks like then . . 
  do they actively comment and take feedback in social media such as reddit ? 
  i mean , not like just once in a week but like multiple times a day ? 
  soe does that in r/planetside . 
  turn up the difficulty . 
  if you have too much gold and do n't know how to spend it , make things harder !, 
  if you have too much gold however , spend it on units , unit upgrades , buildings . . just do n't spend too much and try to keep up the balance . 
  now this is quite bs , is n't it ? 
  special deals shown only in one soe game ? 
  why you just did n't give to every game ? 
  just wondering . . 
  have you played me1 & 2 ? 
  if you have n't , please play those first to get the full experience . 
  you 're going to miss a lot if you have n't . 
  here vs is the underdog but still , vs has indar like 95 % of the time . 
  i partly blame nc though . 
  they always fuck us up when we are just about to wg vs. 
  ottoman is really great civ in g&k . you can capture any naval unit , including non-barbarians . 
   i think you 've confused ctf with conquest, 
  ftfy, 
  grab it while you can lads !, 
  tr tactical superiority, 
  enjoy your victory . 
  finland was terribad and it deserved the 4th place . 
  next year ^ maybe ^ we ^ will ^ win, 
  step 1 : build tons of chu-ko-nus, 
  step 2 : rape everything, 
  step 3 : upgrade them when it 's possible ; repeat step 2, 
  that 's pretty much all you need to know . 
  upvoting these is quite difficult, 
  try playing on smaller maps, 
  play it . 
  that 's the best way to figure it out . 
  i can win a victory even if it 's not recommended in ideology ? 
  new achievement : we 're gon na liberate the shit out of you . 
  win domination victory with freedom ideology, 
  mongols and attila . 
  mounted archers ftw !, 
  oh . . you . 
  die rebel scum !, 
  nerf the bursters !, 
  we had them since the launch and we can agree they are op . 
  nerfing bursters also nerfs vs&tr abilities . 
  i nuked my capital once . 
  damn misclicks . . 
  build farms next to lakes and rivers , religious & policy enhances , maritime city states . . 
  c&c , battlefield , medal of honor , nfs , dead space , all ea sports titles . . 
  i hope you are not talking about me3 . . 
  i think that was really good game and it was not so much eas fault that the ending sucked . 
  i have n't touched da2 but i have only heard bad things about it . 
  the dlc thing went too far in me3 though . 
  from ashes should 've been in the standard game and the costume things . . well they were stupid but did n't effect the game . 
  weapon packs were also dumb but since the packs were like 1,50 $ and you did n't need those weps they were acceptable . 
  fortunately the story dlc was good and definitely worth the money . 
  they handled mp well though . 
  all dlc was free , and they added tons of content to it . 
  sure , you could buy those crates with money but you could get moderately easily $ 3 crate in 30 minutes . 
  so no , definitely not pay2win . 
  higby pls, 
  console + competitive ? 
  that 's impossible . 
  it has to be . 
  good but still , i would prefer perma-killing leaders . 
  i bought this game 2 months ago . 
  i just do n't understand the logic why i ca n't raze capitals . 
  what . 
  the . 
  this game is really anti-sexist but advertising it with bare skin and tits ? 
  well , china is china i guess . . 
  [ how about this ? 
  ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/1847084-commo_rose.png ), 
  how rare is this thing btw ? 
  i have done roughly dozen playthroughs and i have seen it only once . . 
  sorry , ca n't talk about it . 
  they broke the rule # 4 . 
  and you broke the rule # 1 !, 
  i have 7300se in my `` junk '' computer . . 
  i installed civ 5 to it . 
  it was n't pretty . 
  all on low settings , minimum fps . . 
  i barely had 5fps though . 
  so yeah , get a better pc . 
  wrong place to circlejerk . . 
  i usually do n't mind banging sexy blue aliens but this . . no thanks, 
  there are tons of f2p games out there . 
  team fortress 2 , warframe , planetside 2 , world of tanks , league of legends , dota 2 , blacklight : retribution , tribes : ascend . . 
  you should watch some yt videos and decide what 's interesting and what 's not . 
  [ it could have been worse ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=mapsi0qku_0 ), 
  gameplay is almost as epic as the ad so i see no problem with ut, 
  hitman 2 and contracts are worth getting .
