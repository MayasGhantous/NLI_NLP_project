  so i came back and subscribed to this subreddit . 
  no regrets . 
  so what i 've been doing here ? 
  well , answering to sib and wsib . 
  mostly i have tried to recommend mass effect for rpg/sp buyers , because that series my favourite sp game ever . 
  my most unforgettable experience is when i did a post why ysb bad company 2 instead of battlefield 3 . 
  battlefield 3 has tons design flaws and other bad things that makes bc2 superior . 
  also , as a bf vet i can not forgive what dice has turned that series into . 
  that post caused lots of discussion and it 's currently ranked # 44 in the most upvoted posts of all time . 
  even though i am not so active and answer to every second post , i 've had a great experience here . 
  this is definitely one of my favourite subreddits , and i am sure that this subreddit will have a positive future - 15k subscribers and still growing !, 
  how many maps & content does it have when we compare it to pc version ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1az1pl/this_is_what_happens_when_professional_gamer/ ) thanks for reminding about this cancerous even though . 
  alhambra gives 20 % boost in one city . 
  chapel gives you 25 % boost in all cities . 
  being part of pc master race is n't about how good your gaming pc is , it 's about owning a one . 
  sure , you 'd do a great service for yourself and gaben by building a better pc , but we accept you to our ranks like you are . 
  4000 flash kills . 
  not bad . . not bad . . 
  it 's marketing . 
  microsoft gives ea/dice a hefty amount of money so the dlc would come first to xbone . 
  and because it comes first to xbone , some people decide to pick xbone version over the pc/ps4 version . 
  i personally find this very stupid but hey , capitalism . 
  i have only 55 :(, 
  [ here it is ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041714204/games?tab=recent ), 
  the mouse i 'm using is [ roccat savu . 
  ] ( http://www.roccat.org/products/gaming-mice/roccat-savu/ ) it 's excellent right-handed palm mouse . 
  it has large sliding parts , which makes it very stable and smooth . 
  it has rough side grips which might feel odd but once you get used to them , it 's great . 
  also , the drivers are fantastic . 
  you can also make macros , and there are 20 pre-made macros for games like counter-strike , starcraft 2 and guild wars 2 . 
  you also have dumb stuff like achievements , clicking recording . . only major downside of this mouse is that you can only choose 400 , 800 , 1600 and 4000dpi . 
  the video is [ bf4 official frostbite 3 feature video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9yvv6g3q7g ), 
  it reminds me more about [ crysis nanosuit ] ( http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100102202620/crysis/images/d/db/960x0_11.jpg ), 
  it has to be [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvqyn2rjfva ) , a masterpiece from mikkrobitti . 
  this trailer would convince anybody to play this game who 's even slightly interested in rpgs . 
  i got my alpha trial too , but it does n't show on my library . . 
  same problem here , maybe it 'll show later . 
  are these on public test server ? 
  well , it does n't work . 
  you 'll be fine with that build for many years , brethen . 
  i hope that it 's open beta , because i do n't have premium . 
  well , they made northern strike expansion in 2007 . 
  1.5 patch added 1 completely new map and a re-make of wake island . 
  it was released on 2008 . 
  also , 1.51 patch was released in 2011 , which made northern strike expansion free . 
  also , we got 2 completely new maps and they re-made strike at karkand and operation blue pearl . 
  i 'm afraid that you must kill him . 
  he is bringing great shame to your family and he has already gone too far ; he can not be saved anymore . 
  dragon valley is possibly coming in china rising but i agree , re-making bf3 maps feel like waste of time and money . 
  he is going to either buy a second 780 later or the lack of experience . 
  i recommend borderlands 2 . 
  it is extremely good game , especially when played with friends . 
  mostly the game is fun gun-looting shoot 'em ` up action . 
  the story is quite good , but it does n't take itself too seriously . 
  it is lan and online play , 1-4 players . 
  only speculations . 
  but dragon valley fits perfectly to expansion : it 's set in chinese mainland and it was a favourite bf2 map for many people . 
  why would n't they do it ? 
  i kinda have to disagree . 
  if you watch the trailer and do not focus on the details , you will not spoil it . 
  only thing you can figure out is that there is an invasion coming . 
  you ca n't do a trailer for all three games without spoiling something . 
  atleast not a good one . 
  if you want a cooler and you do n't overclock , a 30-40 $ air cooler should do the trick . 
  i had no problems running aix on w7 . 
  have you tried to do basic stuff like running as administrator and running it on compatibility modes ? 
  well this is a no-brainer . 
  battlefield 2 is one of the best games ever made , and every fps fan should at least try it . 
  and reddit t-shirt ? 
  well . . it 's a fucking t-shirt !, 
  sure , you could have funny moments with other redditors but 4channers and 9faggers would think bad things about you . 
  get the battlefield 2 . 
  i recommend getting standard edition if you find it cheaper . 
  euro force and armored fury expansion packs became f2p after 1.5 patch , and special forces expansion is pretty much dead . 
  do n't waste your money on that abomination . 
  it wo n't be a good thing . 
  i would say that it would barely run it . 
  low quality , 30-40fps , possibly drops to 25 . 
  and that will be painful . 
  instead , build your own pc !, 
  you will save tons of money . 
  for 500 $ you could get a pc that would run bf4 somewhat nicely ( not counting accessories ) , but the more you spend on that build the better it will be . 
  start doing your own research on pc and parts . 
  just spend time studying small little details ; `` does ddr2 ram fit on ddr3 slot ? '', 
  `` what is a socket ? '', 
  trust me , it 'll be easier than it sounds . 
  if you spend few days studying pcs you should know everything you need to know . 
  well you already know many things because you 've played bc2 and bf3 . 
  but there are some differences . 
  first of all , air is much more powerful than in bf3 . 
  do n't get frustrated if you get killed so many fricken times by choppers and jets ; accept your role as a cannon fodder . 
  teamwork is much more relevant in bf2 . 
  there is no auto-heal and you get much less ammo than in bf3 . 
  this means that you must stick to your squad mates , in order to get healed and re-supplied . 
  keeping alive squad leader is very important : he 's the only squad spawn point and he is receiving directly orders from commander . 
  he can also ask for supplies and vehicle drops from commander . 
  remember that not every round this perfect food chain happens : sometimes commander sucks , squads do not communicate with him or there is no teamwork in the squad . 
  usually rounds like these are lost , unless the opposing team sucks too . 
  do n't expect weapons to act the same way as they do in bf3 .
