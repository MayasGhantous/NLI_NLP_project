  but there 's one thing that pistols do need : more customization . 
  having a laser and a suppressor is pretty much a no-brainer for pistols . 
  compensators , flash suppressor or possibly some new attachments would be nice . 
  summer sale starts tomorrow and i am confident that bnw will not be on sale . 
  here on europe bnw is still -10 % off , and you should buy it while you can . 
  edit : why am i getting downvoted ? 
   have you tried, 
  thanks for clearing that for me , i somehow though it was -5 % reduction . 
  [ this is quite old news , actually . 
  ] ( http://hexus.net/gaming/news/industry/56841-microsofts-e3-xbox-one-demos-ran-nvidia-powered-pcs/ ) and it was n't just bf4 running on pc , all xbone games were running on pc . 
  wait , we have traitors ? 
  allied with filthy nc ? 
  do n't worry fellow tr , we 'll have them executed soon . 
  atleast they said that they suck, 
  you will only get brave new world if you buy it , nothing else . 
  also , there is n't any official info about complete edition , but i 'm sure it will come sooner or later . 
  mass effect ? 
  i have n't played last of us but no game has effected me emotionally so much than the mass effect trilogy . 
  maybe intel got too cocky because they pretty much dominate cpu markets and they believe that they can do whatever they want ? 
  i hope intel realizes that they are about to shoot their own foot . 
  otherwise i 'll switch to amd . 
  patience my brother !, 
  our lord is testing our faith !, 
  have you tried red orchestra 2 and its new stand-alone expansion , rising storm ? 
  i have fell in love in that game . 
  it is n't exactly like battlefield , but you will find many great features that exist in bf , such as commander and squads . 
  there is n't any vehicles expect tanks in vanilla red orchestra 2 . 
  the game is also very hardcore : getting shot to a torso is almost always a one-shot kill . 
  because of this teamwork is much more relevant in bf . 
  the game is almost purely infantry focused , and there are multiple classes which you can choose . 
  most of the guys get the bolt-action rifle with iron sights , but you have classes with smgs , lmgs , scoped bolt-action rifles , anti-tank rifles . . 
  the game mode is a mixture of conquest and rush . 
  attackers must capture all control points or kill all defenders in order to win . 
  defenders must hold at least one control point hold for x amount of minutes or kill all attackers . 
  battles are streamlined just like in bf rush , but it is still fun . 
  red orchestra 2 is really fun game with tons of features included in battlefield . 
  it can be brutal and you might get frustrated and even paranoid in your first few hours , but when you get into it it 's really great experience . 
  i guess you 've been living in a barrel . 
  moba is one of the most popular genres on the pc , prob . 
  the most popular . 
  expect that most of his content is n't let 's play . 
  god . 
  poland colors are not inverted !, 
  100 players is actually exciting in large maps such as dragon valley or daqing oilfields . 
  i once played great wall 16 with 100 players . 
  i do n't want to sound elitist or anything , but now it would be a great time to switch to pc gaming . 
  if you invest that 600-2000 $ you get much cheaper games , superior graphics and framerates , better sound quality , much more exclusives , lots of f2p games , ability to other things ( such as editing ) , you have more mature community , dedicated servers , modding , superior controls , huge variety of different controllers and joysticks , emulators for older console titles , better patch support . . 
  and while your hardware is already having limitations ( bf4 is running at 720p , division is 30fps ) , pc is already advancing to resolutions such as 1440p , 2k or even 4k . 
  while they exist even today , these resolutions will become much more common in the future . 
  same problem here ... shit . 
  2 am here on finland too . 
  i will wait too even if i had to drink a dozen cup of coffee to stay awake . 
  [ ohmygodohmygodohmygod ] ( http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/3407850/oh-my-god-o.gif ), 
  i found my religion after i started trading . 
  i guess that explains something . 
  that depends on a map . 
  actually , most of the maps are not ideal for 64 players , because they are just too small . 
  yeah sure , pc is gaming so expensive . 
  easy . 
  live in finland and the government pays you if you go to university . 
  i 'm in !, 
  edit : sorry , i have changed my mind . 
  i wo n't play today . 
  i think you should buy a sound card . 
  they do n't cost too much and they give you a noticeable difference . 
  getting guns is ridiculously fast and easy in tf2 . 
  and , most of the stock guns are the best in most of the situations . 
  the difference is n't massive but there is some . 
  here on europe ( atleast on finland ) they barely taught us about south american history , maybe nothing at all if i remember . 
  op is a coward , he deleted his account . 
  i lost my sanity when i saw what they did to battlefield . 
  ftfu, 
  shepard, 
  i 'm surprised that planetside 2 is n't in the first question . 
  both developers and fans are really passionate about that game . 
  [ please , do n't pre-order games ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5uj4xit1y ), 
  sorry , but i must correct this for you . 
  bad company 2 is not battlefield 2 . 
  battlefield 2 is a pc-exclusive title released in 2005 . 
  bad company was released in 2010 , and it is multi-platform . 
  soe , you are finally getting it . 
  but just like someone else said , these do not quite fit the default armor look . 
  maybe more matt color ? 
  06 looks kinda like tr helmet which was crafted later to vs helmet . 
  but 08 . . man , that helmet looks really nice . 
  it 's really good helmet for vs arsenal imo, 
  well , this is n't much but [ here 's my humble rainmeter theme ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y3kc0mf.jpg ), 
  [ and here 's the wallpaper ] ( http://gamingbolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/planetside-2-hd-wallpaper.jpg ), 
  it 's . . it 's . . beautiful ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ heretic, 
  i should learn to do a proper theme . 
  i just took pieces from other themes and put something together . . 
  how so ? 
  is n't the [ increased price for their games ] ( http://www.product-reviews.net/2013/07/10/ps4-xbox-one-games-from-ea-with-warning/ ? 
  ) , more and more dlc ( 2 bf4 dlc were announced before we even saw any bf4 mp footage , dlc in almost every single title ) , [ micro-transactions ] ( http://bf4central.com/battlefield-4-battlepacks/ ) , [ betraying fans ] ( http://www.computerandvideogames.com/241306/dice-well-never-charge-for-battlefield-maps/ ) , [ removing mod tools and then spitting lies for excuse ] ( http://gamerant.com/battlefield-3-no-mod-tools-trung-94727/ ) , [ changing classic game mechanics in the last game of the franchise ] ( http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews ) , [ not knowing what fans really want or just attempting to pull our dicks ] ( http://ps3.mmgn.com/news/consumers-love-microtransactions-eas-pla ) , rushing game production , leaving some of them incompete , bad enough ? 
  if these changes not made for money greed , then ea really have a problem to manage their expenses . 
  [ actually , they do have a problem ] ( http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/playstation-lounge/ea-to-spend-100-million-in-marketing-for-bf3-with-the-intent-of/td-p/31053183 ) . 
  $ 100 + million is wayyy too much for a single game . 
  and i 'd say that viral marketing is as effective as normal marketing , even more effective !, 
  i am not a part of the dae hate ea - circlejerk - i believe in good games and good business practices . 
  but their latest business practices and lying has really aggravated me lately .
