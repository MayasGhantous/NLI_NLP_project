  i think that origin was a smart move from them for example - expect that it 's a shit service . 
  if it was actually a good service and had many community features that steam has then i would have not problem with it . 
  atleast they have 60fps , meaning that it 's not completely unplayable . 
  we should form a circle around him and spit on him . 
  amen my brother , amen . 
  why do you say that it 's ruined ? 
  well , jetpacks and mining drill thing ofc but i was comparing old ace of spades and classic mode . 
  from what i 've seen from youtube that the classic is pretty much the same than the old aos - only with improved graphics . 
  and that 's i want with my 2 $ . 
  no my brother , that is what the peasants do !, 
  i have played that game and i 'd like to hear a proper argument why ace of spades classic mode is worse than original ace of spades . 
  i 've seen so many people saying that the sequel for x game was ruined , but i rarely see good explanations other than `` it 's not the same '' . 
  before that , no upvotes for you . 
  my friend played only me3 . 
  he said that he felt it was a great experience and he did n't miss a lot . 
  maybe he actually learned a lot of stuff from dialogues . 
  or he does n't know what he missed . . 
  this is the answer that i was looking for  thanks , i 'll pick it up, 
  tr turret has one advantage though : it 's the least visible one . 
  nc and vs turrets shine quite brightly , especially the vs. 
  but the tr turret is much harder to see . 
  it is so much fun to do a composite rush against a noob . 
  is . . is that a peasant game as your wallpaper ? 
  [ it was a very painful to watch , as painful as the scene where starks got slaughtered . 
  but still , both of them are really beatiful in their own way . 
  ] ( / spoiler `` game of thrones '' ), 
  free tmg-50 - well that 's nice . 
  this game is like civilization . . with trucks !, 
  just one more delivery . . aaaand it 's 6am . 
  i tried to add my favourite radio channel to the list , but it did n't work :( other , worse channels did work though . 
  easter weekend . . never forget !, 
  i also like tb very much , he is so arrogant brit in a good way . 
  there are many big youtubers that i like , and because of that i 'd like to talk about smaller channels which i like . 
  speaking about brits , i like very much [ unit lost . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/unitlosttube/videos ) they do lots of let 's plays filled with british humor but they also do 30 minute rants about certain topics . 
  also , the [ blackbustercritic . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/blackbustershow/videos ) he is truly a pc gamer , who has done a massive campaign against xbox one . 
  and now that microsoft has changed xbone drm policies , he is focusing more on ea . 
  [ sergeantmerrell ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/sergeantmerrell/videos ) makes lots of videos about shooters , and he knows lots of stuff about guns themselves . 
  he goes to very close details if the topic is about real life guns . 
  then i watch lots of channels which make montage parodies , such as [ mlgyolo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/mlgyolo/videos ) , [ rocketbobsled ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/rocketbobsled/videos ) , [ trickehkitteh ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/trickehkitteh/videos ) , [ chatsgames ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/chatsgames/videos ) and [ snipars ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/snipars/videos ) . 
  they pretty much directly insult peasants by showing what kinda shit they produce . 
  i am not entering the competetion , but i 'd like to share this :, 
  i am not sure this is your type of humour . . 
  stack some gold , build 6-8 archers and 1-3 melee units , get luxury tech ( s ) and then construction . 
  upgrade your archers to bowmen with all the gold you 've gathered and then conquer your neighbor civ . 
  pre-artillery siege units suck though when compared to bombers and arty + rocket arty . 
  they are at least 1 turn in city bombarment range , unless there is a road or something, 
  i highly recommend ets 2 , if you like driving games . 
  that game was really positive surprise for me . 
  and as usually , a controller or steering wheels + pedals are really big plus , but the game is playable with keyboard too . 
  you can try out ets 2 demo , it offers tons of content and you can easily figure out do you like the game or not . 
  ahh . . good ol' poor cable management in the first build . 
  we all did this same mistake , admit it . 
  congrats , a bot made your gun lvl 50 . 
  i guess he was a peasant after all , he deleted his account . 
  i 'd sat that they are useful if you want to get more fov and do n't want to make the game look silly . 
  in a game like euro truck simulator 2 that would help very much . 
  but since oculus rift is coming i 'd say that multiple monitors will be inferior and irrelevant . 
  [ loadsamoney !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on-7v4qnhp8 ), 
  agreed , they should use at least current gen gpus , not 2,5 years old . 
  i really have trouble to believe that this is official . 
  ahh . . this reminds me how many hours i spent practicing in an empty lan server in bf2 . 
  so many memories . 
  well definitely not the weirdest . 
  far from it . 
  i , honestly , ca n't give a fuck about whole trading card thing . 
  only good thing about it is free money . 
  i 've made nearly 2 euroes selling them but that 's about it . 
  yes , i recommend getting it !, 
  it 's quite different experience from cs : s but if you ask from me , the cs : go is the best cs . 
  it 's an endless debate which cs is the best , and i think you should figure it out by yourself . 
  all of them are great though ( expect cz , which is n't a bad game but it does n't offer anything new ) . 
  the problem with those german simulators is that they suck . 
  low production values , low graphical quality , bad physics , low support etc. . 
  this game however , is good !, 
  driving physics are great , cargo type effects the driving , graphics are good and the aesthetics are amazing !, 
  also , you need to manage things like the lights , flashers and wipers . 
  also , devs are constantly supporting this game and adding new stuff . 
  and the amount of mods . . oh my . 
  it 's just a cherry in top of a cake . 
  those spikes did go down during pts times . 
  great choice !, 
  i very highly recommend getting gold edition upgrade asap . 
  it 's -75 % off today , costing only 2,5 $ . 
  it has all dlc expect the latest one , brave new world . 
  gods & kings expansion adds lots of new mechanics such as espionage and religion , and it improves combat a lot . 
  also , gods & kings includes all the small expansions , such as civs and scenarios . 
  and you should get brave new world too . 
  it makes the late-game much better . 
  it adds world congress , trading and tourism , which is related to new culture victory . 
  also , ideologies have much more relevant role . 
  no need to rush with this expansion though , base game and g&k offers you lots of gameplay hours before that . 
  it seems like that your firewall is blocking punkbuster, 
  indie goty said by who ? 
  last year there were tons of great games , and in vga walking dead won the goty award . 
  even though you might be wrong about goty thingy , this game is still great . 
  fools !, 
  heretics !,
