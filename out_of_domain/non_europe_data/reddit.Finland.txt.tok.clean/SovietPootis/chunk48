  it definitely lacks something what older c&c s had . 
  imo even c&c 3 had that but ra3 . . 
  it 's not a bad game but it does lack something . 
  it is much , much better than c&c 4 obviously . 
  chivalry in the other hand , is a great game . 
  i highly recommend it . 
  it is very skill-based game , even though it first feels like a simple melee combat game . 
  so . . it 's practically steam workshop ? 
  also , can the players themselves show their opinion ? 
  that is not worth $ 750 , it 's worth about $ 500-600 . 
  that being said , you got a fantastic deal . 
  also , get a 1tb hdd for a storage drive . 
  you should get one with 60 bucks . 
  this reminds me about [ david vetter , the bubble boy . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_vetter ), 
  because of his disorder his immune system did n't work at all . 
  because of that he had to live inside a sterile bubble . 
  when he was 9 he got a spacesuit and with that he could explore his environment outside of his bubble . 
  [ here 's a document if anybody 's interested ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cfpduaj41y ), 
  in my opinion c&c 3 is better than ra3 . 
  the graphics , aesthetics and mood is much deeper and serious than in ra3 . 
  also , the combat is better imo . 
  it 's faster , better units . . ra3 has naval combat though , which is a big plus . 
  they 're both good games but c&c 3 is better . 
  the expansion , kanes wrath adds a lot of content to it , and it is a must-buy if you like that game . 
  also , c&c 3 has a 8/10 story and kanes wrath makes it even better . 
  i am not sure about mp community anymore , but last time i checked both games did have one , small but dedicated . 
  expect to get your ass raped by these veterans , many many times . 
  i could n't handle it so i quit . 
  speaking about c&c , it is a shame that ea really fucked up c&c 4 in every possible way . 
  that game had tons of potential but ea . . 
  i have no idea what crack they were taking when they designed the mechanics and wrote the story . 
  being part of pc master race is n't about not owning a console , it is about owning a gaming pc . 
  that being said , this man has done nothing wrong . 
  ps3 has some nice exclusives and i ca n't blame him . 
  but it is highly possible that 30fps and 720p will make him mad soon and he will soon come back to the one true platform . 
  i actually prefer bc2 audio over bf3 - bf3 guns , actually bf3 audio generally just lacks that aggression and punch what bc2 offers . 
  if tr guns sounded just like that . . oh my . 
  my dreams would 've come true . 
  [ here 's a comparison ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ivxaga70ri ), 
  they are the best out of new ones , not sure if the best out of all . 
  and they 're great !, 
  i highly recommend picking up c&c 3 and kanes wrath . 
  they 're very loyal to original franchise and they 're good games . 
  sure , some people critize whole alien thingy but i think they 're good !, 
  also , they fit to the lore . 
  [ i second this . 
  ] ( http://www.therpf.com/attachments/f47/mass-effect-3-ending-opinions-feelings-mass-effect-dlc-message-2.jpg-88189d1332460289 ), 
  and that 's why i have a ps3 for cases like these . 
  i highly recommend [ roccat savu . 
  ] ( http://www.roccat.org/products/gaming-mice/roccat-savu/#crb_1 ) it 's an excellent palm mouse with tons of programming capabilities . 
  it has an easyshift-button , which gives you an alternative function for every button on your mouse when you 're holding it . 
  making macros etc. 
  is really easy and you can edit delays etc. 
  just as you wish . 
  also , [ there are some pre-made macros . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qs3hsxg.jpg ) and customizing other options is really good !, 
  only thing that i do n't like about this mouse is that i can only choose between 400 , 800 , 1600 and 4000dpi . 
  a mouse that costs 60 $ should have more options imo . 
  if palm mouses are n't your thing then i recommend checking out kone , kova and pyra ( and their alternative versions ) . 
  they should fill your non-palm needs . 
  they have easyshift etc. 
  goodies that savu has . 
  what about camos ? 
  if you ask from me , giraffes are one true zombies . 
  i pretty much always build only 3-5 cities . 
  always . 
  and if i play wide then i conquer them , because i always play tall if i do n't go for domination . 
  fine , so be it : /, 
  so , hl3 confirmed anyway ? 
  it started , but they got kicked out and they ca n't get back :p, 
  euro truck simulator 2 ? 
  you can listen real life radio channels when you drive . 
  also , you can add your own radio channels from internet . 
  i tried to add my favourite one but it did n't work though : /,

  [ read this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shouldibuythisgame/comments/1jd22d/ysnb_buy_red_orchestra_2_ysb_rising_storm_only/ ), 
  i found it amusing that apu means help in finnish, 
  i would n't be worried about pc getting outdated . . you ca n't improve that build so much anymore . 
  i 'd say it will stay somewhat relevant for at least 4 years . 
  you get m12 trenchgun , type 99 lmg , 4x for japanese sniper and m1 garand with bayonet . 
  that being said , i personally do n't like m12 trenchgun . 
  all guns have 1 shot kill capability so i do n't see a shotgun to be important , since i lose lots of range . 
  i am not so sure what 's the different between type 99 and 96 , since they both look almost the same and i have n't played so much with them . 
  i usually go usually with type 99 because hey , why not . 
  4x scope for type 99 is n't worth it . 
  both lvl 0 and 25 scopes suck . 
  they just are awful . 
  i am not so sure about lvl 50 scope , but that one you must unlock anyway . 
  bayonet obviously adds more melee damage , but i am not sure if you get garand or just the bayonet . 
  also you get 2 character skins for rising storm and a tommygun , which is a cheap assault rifle ( i know it 's not an assault rifle but it 's used by the commando class which specializes in assault rifles ) . 
  you also get the os for rs and ro2 . 
  so yeah , if you have the extra money you should go for it , especially if you own kf . 
  nothing wrong about supporting great developers !, 
  aw piss , i did n't know about it . 
  i though both games were -75 % off !, 
  damn , i must edit my post then . 
  i was wrong . 
  you can get those tf2 hats 0,30 $ each from community store . 
  also , read my other comment about those pre-order bonuses .
