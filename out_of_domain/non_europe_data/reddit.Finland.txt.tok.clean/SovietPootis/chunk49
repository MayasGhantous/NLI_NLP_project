  they 're genuine .

  ahh , console peasants and their petty humor . 
  * `` strong minds discuss ideas , average minds discuss events , weak minds discuss people . '' * - socrates, 
  aww , that kid really wanted to be part of your platoon . 
  i somehow feel sympathy for him . 
  at least he did n't fuck your mother or something . . 
  actually , yes . 
  socrates does have some amazing quotes . 
  my favourites are `` as for me , all i know is that i know nothing '' and `` there is only one good , knowledge , and one evil , ignorance . '', 
  the comment is misleading . 
  in the video he admits that he is a console peasant who wants to learn how to play on pc with keyboard + mouse , but he does n't want to abandon his heretic habits . 
  remember people ; there are only opinions not facts . 
  i liked gta 4 a lot . 
  it was a good game . 
  it was n't anything amazing but a very 7.5 / 10 experience . 
  i never liked gta series so much though . 
  but i found that sr3 was a shit game . 
  i never understood the humor where everything is pulled to the utmost . 
  it 's just too silly . 
  in a very bad way . 
  i did n't like gta franchise so much , like i loved battlefield franchise . 
  this is quite unpopular opinion but vice city was my favourite . 
  those 80s aesthetics really blew me away . 
  rest of the gta franchise . . 7/10 or something . 
  but i see understand what you 're trying to mean : franchise changed too much after bf2142 . 
  first they made console exclusive title , then they made another one with pc port . 
  i actually liked bc2 even though it was n't a true battlefield . 
  and when i saw battlefield 3 was coming i jizzed my pants . 
  `` finally , a true battlefield we veterans have been waiting for 5 years ! '', 
  it 's just really sad that the final product was 32vs32 death-match designed and marketed for call of duty players , with as generic as possible `` evil russian terrorists nuke america '' story , and tons of dlc . 
  also , the final `` fuck you '' from ea&d ice was the lack of mod tools , [ and insulting our modding skills ] ( http://gamerant.com/battlefield-3-no-mod-tools-trung-94727/ ), 
  maybe you see gta iv vs old franchise the same way . 
  have you tried the ballad of gay tony ? 
  it makes the game more like `` original '' , with tons of silly elements . 
  it does n't go too far like srs do , but i 'd say it has many features that the base game has . 
  i personally did n't mind that gta 4 had too serious story . 
  i actually liked it . 
  the random rampaging did get quite boring soon , just like in other gtas . 
  i 'm not sure if this is a fair comparison , but borderlands franchise manages to do it the best . 
  you do the silly stuff while you are doing the missions , and you will see everything while you do them . 
  you have lots of good non-floodplain tiles , so getting a petra would be really really good . 
  +2 faith for flood plains ? 
  bloody hell , that is so op . 
  brotherhood of nod ? 
  i highly approve . 
  why the hell would you buy quadro 6000 ? 
  it 's not a gaming gpu . . titan or even something worse is much , much better than quadro 6000 . 
  if i was a millionaire i would buy [ something like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rddinmd0xns ), 
  your monitor solution is quite . . amusing . 
  sure , i 'll play battlefield 4 with oculus if i end buying that game and it gets the support . 
  oculus rift has already won dozens of awards . 
  one of those awards was [ best hardware of e3 ] ( http://www.tweaktown.com/news/31531/oculus-rift-takes-out-best-hardware-of-e3-2013-award-beats-out-the-next-gen-consoles/index.html ) , beating both ps4 and xbox one . 
  as a future father i would give teach them noble ways right from the beginning - keyboard + mouse , not some peasant controllers . 
  if you want to try something extreme , i recommend [ battlefield 2 : project reality mod . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jxk7sqnwfm ) it 's definitely not a game for everybody . 
  you pretty much ca n't get anything more realistic than that . 
  but if you want to have something less realistic and more gamey , go for rising storm . 
  or if you want something casual in `` realistic standards '' , battlefield franchise is the way to go . 
  [ here 's a good ysb explaining it . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shouldibuythisgame/comments/1jczgn/ysb_rising_storm_on_steam/ ), 
  red orchestra 2 is set in russian ww2 theater . 
  most of the , if not all battles happen in stalingrad and nearby regions . 
  rising storm is a stand-alone expansion for it , and it is set in pacific theater . 
  if you buy rising storm you get access to ro2 multiplayer too , but if you buy ro2 only you get only limited access to it . 
  rs is focused on asymmetric combat while ro2 is symmetric balance . 
  sure , german guns perform overall slightly better than russian variants but in rs americans get massive advantages over japanese , while japanese have some guerrilla tactics in their pockets . 
  do n't expect the game to be easy . 
  you will die . 
  a lot . 
  it is very brutal and unforgiving , but once you learn to play it will be tons of fun . 
  so yeah , if you like mp shooters and you do n't mind brutality then this is a game for you . 
  edit : if you want to get the game for the cheapest price , buy red orchestra 2 first and then rising storm . 
  you will gain -75 % off rs if you own ro2 . 
  but if you want to get it the cheapest , go find somebody who has ro2 and would buy rs for you . 
  portal 2 , and all valve games are always on sale during big sales . 
  and i 've seen portal 2 in midweek madness/daily deal/weekend deal . 
  instead of adding dumb crab like this , why wont they use development for important stuff such as bug fixing ? 
  i have no idea how they 're gon na pull that off , pc performance is so rubbish . 
  i disagree . 
  civ 5 gold edition includes base game , all dlc , expect bnw . 
  and since base game costs 7,50 $ and gold 10 $ on sale , you should wait for that sale or buy it with tf2 keys or something . 
  actually , 1.6 is on xbox too , go is on ps3 and 360 too . 
  actually , there 's nothing wrong about the console version , it 's just that you ca n't play it with controller . 
  but that is what you 're trying to say i presume . 
  that being said , i totally agree with you . 
  [ apparently 1/3 like one of the shittiest civs the most . . ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vou5je6wvzizep6a8rngkrvegirqavhwyfhn80zllog/viewanalytics ), 
  i ca n't tell correct stats , but [ battlefield 2 : project reality ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jxk7sqnwfm ) has to be # 1 for pc master race . 
  a mod created by small team , after 8 years being in development , it is finally worth the weight . 
  as the name suggests , the mod focuses on creating as realistic game as possible . 
  almost everything has been changed from base game . 
  it is not one of those games that you can easily just hop in . 
  there 's a long , long learning curve . 
  also , you must communicate with teammates and stick to them if you want to be effective . 
  if you want to figure out what the game looks like , go and [ check this guy out . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/bluedrake42/videos ) he is the best source for this mod . 
  this mod is definitely not for everybody . 
  but if you want true pc master race experience , this is the best you can get . 
  enclave was the role model for other outfits , it 's sad that they 're gone :(, 
  yes .
