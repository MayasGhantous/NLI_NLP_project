  i watched plat . 
  farming guide from jumpinproductions , and he did the same thing . 
  i should try that loadout sometimes . 
  when i played demolisher i had very different power balance , and played with typhoon and black widow . 
  it was n't very effective , so i gave up . 
  it would be great idea , but maybe not yet . 
  the time when graphics have been improved massively , like in 5 years , then it would be time for an upgrade . 
  there has been released gameplay for black mesa : source ( as many of you know , i presume ) , and it looks amazing compared to half-life . 
  wait , what ? 
  a site full of cod fags voted glados and shepard as the best shooter characters ? 
  my faith on humanity has returned, 
  we only saw shepard breathing in that scene . 
  i bet all his/her components are destroyed , and he/she is unable to move . 
  could be opportunity to get close . 
  need pants . 
  wait , no , have pants !, 
  excellent !, 
  this is actually first time i 've seen geth cosplay . 
  oh wait , then there was this one :, 
  epic . 
  i 've got nothing more to say to you . 
  i flipped mako upside down . 
  i love ants . 
  shows how communism has succeeded . 
  everyone works for a nest , and does their job . 
  please not f2p . . every f2p title so far what ea has released is pay2win . . 
  probably you can instantly launch scud storm just for 1,99 $ price . . 
  please . . f2p ca n't work on stradegy game, 
  no . . [ it is this motherfucker ] ( http://www.stcatharines.ca/en/resources/street_light.jpg ), 
  edit : not in every game, 
  well , mako did n't meet any trees . 
  if joker dropped [ this ] ( http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/8/b/gfs_49160_2_1.jpg ) instead of mako , saren would n't never reached the conduit, 
  it 's already been dead for many years . 
  `` resurrection '' just makes things worse, 
  well , yeah . 
  i never liked ra3 but it still was c&c . kw was last good c & c, 
  do n't call me a guy , dude !, 
  it 's not about why , it 's about why not ? 
  i 'm not sure about the exact numbers , but in the final battle , alliance poured in everything what they had . 
  and , alliance lost lots of ships earlier battles , like the whole 2nd , and 4th fleet , and lots of ships are lost from other battles . 
  well . . that 's what i said, 
  instead of romance shepard and vega should have some casual sex instead of true romance . 
  vega cares only about shepards titties, 
  i doubt they will use it theory , after ec , with leviathan dlc , almost every plothole is filled . 
  bioware also said like 100 times it theory is false . 
  i 'm absolutely sure that there wo n't be another mass effect with reapers & shepard included . 
  i 'm 80 % sure that there was tweet where they said indoctrination theory is n't true . 
  but i can be wrong . 
  the `` 100 times '' was a parable of all the evidence bioware has given us , that it theory is wrong . 
  but if two years later mass effect 4 is released and that proves it was right after all , i 'll bake you a cake . 
  once i got everyone expect greenland . . even the madagascar got killed, 
  it seems like i 've made some really stupid arguments , and i 'm dead tired , so my english is n't proper . 
  what i 'm trying to say :, 
  bioware gave us extended cut . 
  it explained most of the plot holes , why suddenly normandy came and picked squad members , how anybody knew shepard made it to the citadel . 
  also , the catalyst explained lots of things , like reapers , crucible , and who the catalyst actually is . 
  later , leviathan dlc filled more plotholes . 
  also , there is the refuse . 
  refuse ending gives you an option to resist and the cycle will continue . 
  and also , they did a big job on new cut-scenes and dialogues , explaining what happened after all this . . 
  i do n't think it 's all just happening in shepard 's head . 
  also , i have to appreciate his loyalty on indoctrination theory . 
  i do n't know where he gets all these ideas to support this theory . 
  all this `` evidence '' is very brittle , like for example , `` destroyer on rannoch said you will resist , but you will fail . 
  he did n't say humans or other organic race . 
  so all that time , destroyer means reapers will control shepard , and this is confirmed evidence that shepard was indoctrinated in front of beam '', 
  just start watching the video , and you will understand how desperately this guy is trying to keep indoctrination theory alive . 
  i think it did n't need one , seeing bare butts is n't so nfsw, 
  well . . no . 
  i am finnish too . 
  we also go to sauna naked . . 
  now you know it . 
  i am sorry , i did n't realize seeing bare butt is a shock for some people . 
  i will do it next time . 
  i do n't believe in indoctrination , but maybe catalyst wanted to shepard go alone to citadel , and let him end the cycle . 
  catalyst said that he had solutions , but he could n't done them , because there was n't crucible , and he just ca n't make them . 
  remember , tali also said that suits will stay as part of quarian culture , because they 've used them for so many years . 
  my theory is lack of time & laziness . 
  the quarian only slide shows in both geth destroyed & peace slide . 
  they just simply did n't have time make more slides , that 's why they put them in both . 
  better make quality pics than rushing low-quality, 
  don ' y forget the geth slide , were the reaper is helping to build, 
  if the ending is synthesis peace , its without masks . 
  if the ending is control or destroy quarians alive , it 's quarians with masks . 
  people have asked so much for seeing tali 's face ( more than that shitty photoshop pic ) , so they unique synthesis ending , geth & quarians glowing green , quarians unmasked, 
  well , if you had best destroy ending , shepard was still breathing . 
  he also made [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2wywpbrfxy&amp;feature=my_liked_videos&amp;list=ll7tba34qdnxtvvrjuzhmbza ) masterpiece , but it was removed , because of machinima and blahblahblah . 
  it even had 150k views !, 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bovomqif-0 ) the video copied by some other dude,

  12 years later ( battlefield 4 ), 
  na na nah na na nah , * more explosions than in pearl harbor movie by michael bay *, 
  you want key too ? 
  [ make a smart comment , there 's only 2 keys left ! ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztjyocvgldg&amp;list=uul8ag-a8bfuegeo9jzr6h_q&amp;index=0&amp;feature=plcp ), 
  same here , but tr is still getting their asses kicked in eu 01 : s, 
  eu1 is doing really , really bad . 
  we had only had four control points yesterday . 
  and the worst part is , we usually have the most amount of players, 
  tali must be loyal if you send her , and the squad leader must be miranda , garrus or jacob .
