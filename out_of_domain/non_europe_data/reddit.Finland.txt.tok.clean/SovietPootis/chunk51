  they feed lies to themselves about console superiority and they actually believe it . 
  but when somebody beats some sense to their dumb heads , they just refuse to believe it and spit lies to themselves . 
  these are common arguments why consoles are better :, 
  `` pc gaming is much more expensive ! '', 
  - not true , games are much cheaper and you do n't have to pay monthly for any service . 
  also , you can get pc for $ 500 that pretty much runs anything at highest settings . 
  `` i can just sit on sofa and relax with my controller , instead of hurt my back and sitting at desk '' - you can do that on pc too . 
  and it 's easy !, 
  `` consoles are easier - just plug in and play '' - you must be really lazy if you do n't want to learn how to use pc - it does n't take so long . 
  `` consoles have more exclusives '' - lies !, 
  pc has more exclusives , which are often new ips instead of gears of war 6 , halo 8 or god of war 9001 . 
  sure , there are some good titles such as last of us , but i 'd say pc exclusives are much more worth it . 
  `` my friends play on consoles '' - well , get better friends !, 
  `` pc has viruses and they tend to crash more often '' - you do n't get viruses if you are smart on the internet and have anti-virus software - even free ones like mse do the job !, 
  also , what does it matter if my games crash now and then , my games boot up in less than 10 seconds !, 
  `` modding ruins gaming '' - go fuck yourself . 
  they would n't if they knew how sovereign our platform actually is . 
  [ maybe more like this ] ( http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/terminus_assault_armor ), 
  you should start with f2p games . 
  some f2p games nowadays are very good and not p2w at all . 
  team fortress 2 , league of legends , dota 2 , planetside 2 , world of tanks , warthunder , warframe , blacklight : retribution , tribes : ascend . . you 'd better check these out !, 
  [ i would n't use those hacks . . ] ( http://bf3.gamebanana.com/news/20430 ), 
  * sigh *, 
  finland , we are trying to win diplomatic victory , and science is our backup plan . 
  we also produce tons of science even though our pop is low . 
  also , if somebody demands a tribute from us , we always knuckle under it . 
  pr2 will be running on cryengine 3 , and it will be completely free . 
  not f2p game where 's microtransactions or you need a game with ce3 , just completely free to play . 
  [ here 's an article of it ] ( http://www.dsogaming.com/news/battlefield-2s-most-realistic-mod-project-reality-comes-to-cryengine-3/ ) , and some screenshots . 
  also , [ here 's some additional screenshots ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=project+reality+cryengine+3&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=fi&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=fp4dupeoc6ss4atag4cabw&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=837&amp;sei=g_4dup2-aowm4asku4bg#bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=ffb1e92b6eb6b175&amp;hl=fi&amp;q=project+reality+cryengine+3&amp;sa=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;um=1&amp;imgdii=_ ) ( not all of them are pr2 , obviously ) . 
  but as you can see , this is a real deal but it will take time before we even have pre-alpha or sumthing . 
  they might have some questionable pay2win elements , like in ps2 you do n't have any aa equipment and it takes quite some time to unlock air weapons , but most of the stuff in that game are just sidegrades . 
  but that 's nothing when compared to old f2p games : horrible guns at the start , you can unlock guns for 1-3 days with free money , purchasable guns are so op . 
  `` i do n't have to prove you anything . 
  spectres are above the law , we clear ? '', 
  maybe that 's not my favourite quote , but it is definitely my favourite renegade one . 
  can we see the rig that enlightened this man who was once ugly and dirty peasant ? 
  rushing gl is generally a bad option . 
  why ? 
  because you are not the only one who wants it . 
  unless you find proper techs from ruins and/or you can chop down forest asap and have high production , i would n't go for it . 
  source : i learned it the hard way . 
  stop treating them like dumbass ais , who will be friendly for you if you are nice to them . 
  always prepare for war and assume he is going to backstab you . 
  i ca n't see shit due to so small picture , but i believe that is cyborg r.a.t. 
  i ca n't tell which model it is though . 
  i have n't had any experience with it but my friend has it and he says that it is a good mouse , even though it looks so . . uncomfortable . 
  correct translation : i love consoles and i know pcs are better so i 'll just spit anything from my mouth to defend consoles , and actually believe it . 
  civ 5 is a game that might surprise you . 
  i loved x-com eu so i decided to give this game a shot even though i had my suspicions , but i ended up loving up that game . 
  it 's . . it 's great !, 
  and very addictive too !, 
  i ca n't say that you might end up liking it , but many people have just tried this game and fell in love , just like i did . 
  you just have to try it and figure it out by yourself . 
  i ca n't say anything about dark souls though . 
  you know more about it than i do apparently . 
  definitely the gold edition . 
  it has all dlc included , expect the latest one , brave new world . 
  gods & kings expansion makes the game so much better than the vanilla . 
  it adds tons of good mechanics such as religion and espionage . 
  also , it improves combat a lot too . 
  it is definitely a must-buy . 
  if you end up liking the game i 'd recommend getting bnw too , but it is definitely not a must-buy for a noob . 
  i do n't like this idea . 
  the whole point of battlefield has always been rock-paper-scissors . 
  you should always have a weakness against something , while having an advantage over something . 
  this idea would make every single class to do anything , pretty much removing rps . 
  sorry , it 's just bad idea . 
  if this idea would come live it would be so op that would make vehicles useless , just like bc2 : v choppers , or they would be so weak that it would be pointless . 
  dude , this game is not realistic . 
  even the guys at dice had said that bf3 is just an arcade shooter . 
  sure , it is more realistic than cowwaduuty but it is just a joke to call it war simulator . 
  any bullet can kill you with one shot , even if it 's just a bodyshot . 
  you are almost guaranteed to die if tank shell , chopper rocket or pretty much any explosive blows almost next to you . 
  you can not be revived in seconds and get back into the fight - it might take months , years or maybe never . 
  at launcher can take down a tank with a single round , if it hits the right spot . 
  tanks require separate driver and a gunner . 
  ammo packs do n't give you ammo forever . 
  bullet drop is wayy too exaggerated in bf3 . 
  you ca n't spawn to your squad mates in the heat of battle . . do i have to continue this list ? 
  if you want to play something really realistic then play arma series , red orchestra 2 , or battlefield 2 : project reality . 
  sure , these games too have some gamey elements but they are nothing compared to bf franchise . 
  i 'd take 60fps any day , unless the game would look like diarrhea . 
  i have n't played halo so i ca n't say anything about it . 
  and i ca n't remember exact stats of 1943 , but that rifle grenade did very little damage to tanks . 
  also , grenade launcher can take down vehicles . 
  i have taken down a chopper with it , and taking out jet is possible too . 
  but against a tank . . 
  i do n't want . 
  also , the recon class gets the c4 instead of support , making support class weaker . 
  overall support is getting a massive buff though with better weapons and nerfed ammo capacity/no ammo pool . 
  i agree what you are trying to say : every infantry guy must have fighting capability against vehicles . 
  but your solution is wrong if you ask from me . 
  bullets making damage would give every single soldier capability to destroy vehicles at long range . 
  so what do we need then ? 
  make infantry more exposed when operating vehicle :, 
  - remove remotely guided turrets . 
  jeep/tank turrets should have turrets which must be mounted by a soldier , making him vulnerable , just like in bf2 . 
  also , i would remove bullet proof windows , at least make them vulnerable against high-caliber ammunition . 
  - vehicle enter/exit animations .
