  and he/she must be loyal too . 
  otherwise , tali dies .

  they really do n't matter , only in the final push do n't make garrus , zaeed or grunt your squadmate . 
  jack or samara/morinth . 
  she must be loyal too . 
  if you choose any other character with biotics , he/she will fail . 
  even if he/she 's loyal . 
  i did n't get it, 
  yeah i saw it , here on finland . 
  we usually do n't have video game commercials , but when we do have , they 're usually call of duty or battlefield . 
  i had just finished me3 , thinking in my head , what the fuck just happened . 
  then i went and watch some tv , and saw the commercial . 
  i feel stupid now . 
  i did n't even notice greedoshoots1st . 
  [ lies !,

  there is also missing `` fuck you dice , you ruined everything '' option . 
  [ lies !,

  scar is the best if you can handle the recoil, 
  [ something like this on bigger scale ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ootzz46iipe&amp;t=1m50s ), 
  you must get 5-7 points if you are paragon , 7 if you are renegade, 
  - tali is not exiled - 2 points, 
  - resolve the argue between tali and legion with paragon or renegade - 1 point, 
  - destroy heretics - 2 points, 
  - destroy geth fighter squadron - 1 point, 
  - save admiral koris - 1 point, 
  and , if one of these things has been done - no peace, 
  - less than 4 bars of reputations, 
  - not played mass effect 2, 
  - legion not recruited, 
  - legion loyalty mission not done, 
  - legion or tali dead in mass effect 3, 
  well that 's a shit deal for you, 
  after the events of me3 , new races will discover mass relay network , and the citadel ( like the one race , i ca n't remember it but they joined citadel in 2184 , but when the reapers came they left quickly the citadel , destroyed all the evidence and destroyed all spacecrafts , including the satellites , so the reapers wont think they 're so evolved ) , and after that , they may become humanitys client race . 
  but wait , was n't the relay network destroyed . . ? 
  this will lead to one resolution : humanity will never have client race , because relays are destroyed , and they can not be fixed on other end , because there were n't reapers , unless the race evolves and fixes the relay by themselves . 
  collectors/harbinger hired blood pack to spread plague . 
  seems like garrus and tali are perfect couple , they 're both dextro , they both like calibrating ships and they both hate spiders . 
  mario will watch you while you fap, 
  shepard can be his buddy, 
  never talked to tali . 
  i did n't know where he was, 
  i really wan na the harbinger to be the final boss !, 
  you do n't see every day somebody hanging from 50 meters , with nonexistent safety gear stabbing bee nest with a stick , and collecting the pieces . 
  i 'd say it 's pretty wtf, 
  oh , i forgot that one . . 
  [ fear me lesser creatures ] ( http://media.desura.com/images/groups/1/3/2632/u8bwp1.gif ), 
  best nfs ? 
  best driving game ever !, 
  atleast they were n't long, 
  in the internet , i do n't know what 's parody and what is n't, 
  black mesa & ep2 fixed this, 
  but unfortunately , even though they have diverse weaponry , one or two weapons per weapon category is overpowered . 
  and these weapons are harrier , typhoon , krysae , carnifex/paladin , talon , reegar , piranha and hurricane . 
  and this game would make its mark in history of fps/mmo gaming , if they smooth the game overall , fix performance problems , make variety ( and balanced ) weaponry , and not making it extremely pay2win . 
  and the combat must be balanced . 
  before that patch , the fights were just `` drop the gal here and let hundreds of people spawn from here . '', 
  now , it 's just too tank-focused . 
  getting at rockets to gunships takes too long , and they 're the best at weaponry , if there is n't much aa around . 
  also , i 've heard that terran republic infantry weapons are up compared to nc/vs counterparts . 
  but hard to say , so far i 've only played tr . 
  [ you have to admit , it looks much better ] ( http://imgur.com/w6nrz ), 
  just wondering . . why does everybody cosplay samara , not liara or aria instead ? 
  i must disagree with you . 
  i learned to play with brass beast . 
  how ? 
  it was the hard mode , jumping behind a corner while the gun is spinning was really hard . 
  but i practiced and i came somewhat good with it . 
  i even bought a strange brass beast and named it `` golden pootis '' , because i loved it so much . 
  then i made 1300 kills with it . 
  then one day i decided to go back to minigun . 
  and it was amazing . 
  i felt like god-like playing with it , because i was comfortable with brass beast . 
  so , the brass beast is n't so bad than you might think . 
  if you 're playing pub server with 12 players , and you 're the secondary medic , then yes , quick-fix is good quickly getting quickly health to people . 
  but on other cases , the normal medigun , or kritzkrieg , is a must . 
  normal medigun might have slower health replenish time , but that 's not much difference . 
  medigun has also overheal . 
  50 % more health . 
  that 's a much difference . 
  soldier can take one more extra rocket hit , heavy getting quick headshot , still he has full health . 
  scouts can take a perfect meatshot from enemy scout and still can fight him effectively . 
  also , the ubercharge just is damn good . 
  a good medic can save his team if enemies are pushing , or he can push up , ubering 3 people at the same time . 
  and the kritzkrieg is not a bad option either . 
  crit sticky can kill all enemies who are close to it , unless they 're overhealed . 
  crit minigun can make every enemy flee . 
  only thing that can counter kritzkrieg is to kill medic or blocking them with an ubercharge . 
  exactly .

  beautiful, 
  when i was playing mw3 free weekend , it was full of assholes whining about everything : `` hacker , noob , akimbo noob , hardscope noob , campers etc. '', 
  and there were actually real hackers alot . 
  i remember one dude , he had godmode or something . 
  i did none damage to him , even when i emptied whole clip to him .
