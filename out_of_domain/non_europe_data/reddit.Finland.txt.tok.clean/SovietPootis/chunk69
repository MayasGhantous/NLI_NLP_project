  sure , there were some serious discussion but overall it is a bloody circlejerk . 
  `` pc master race '' - does n't the name tell that it 's not serious ? 
  well visually , it does . . 
  shen might be a hypocrite , but vahlen is a fucking psychopath . 
  she might look a good woman but in reality she just enjoys messing with those aliens . 
  firaxis got some heavy inspiration from [ tf2 medic . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lszumbjnc&amp;t=0m19s ), 
  if vahlen would live in nazi era , she would prob . 
  be in charge of auschwitz or something . 
  and she would enjoy her job . 
  since you like rpgs , i highly recommend you trying out mass effect if you have n't . 
  do n't worry , he 'll soon realize his great mistake . 
  gg is acceptable if it comes from the losing game or the game has been very close . 
  however , if you say `` easy '' , then you should stop gaming . 
  seriously . 
  `` gl hf '' is the best option , and that must be said before the game starts . 
  that was disgusting . 
  you have to pay it for every month though . 
  pc players pays it once , ps3 players have to pay for every month . 
  also , are we talking about premium or the base game ? 
  i just googled and there is no evidence that ps players got the premium for free . 
  pc players also had a [ origin humble bundle . 
  ] ( http://gamerslottery.com/wordpress/images/humble-bundle-origin-games.png ) $ 5 for all that is a very good deal , better than ps + !, 
  i am not saying that ps + is bad though . . sure , it is great , but it ca n't beat pc deals !, 
  is the vpn thingy secure ? 
  i 've never done it . . 
  btw i 'm buying from europe . 
  [ correct . 
  ] ( http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-27-ibuypowers-steam-machine-priced-at-usd499 ), 
  500 bucks for a system like this is the game-changer . 
  our influence grows !, 
  lolno . 
  you can gild me if you want , 
  just kidding , i just shared this vid . 
  all credit goes to theskillclinic, 
  you deserved your flair . 
  you can also do this outside of us , if you use vpn . 
  15 $ for bf4 , even though it is a buggy pos atm ? 
  i 'll take it !, 
  do you have a 1440p @ 120fps monitor btw ? 
  well , no . 
  bf3 has the same asshat community as bf4 does . 
  however , if you seek for co-operation , but also realism , i highly recommend trying out project reality , which is a mod for battlefield 2 . 
  yes , the game is outdated , hard to learn , has tons of dull moments when you are advancing but there is a dedicated and mostly friendly fanbase who are committed to teamwork and communication . 
  no matter what public game you go , you should n't have a problem to find a squad who is committed to teamwork . 
  the mod has a built-in mumble , so communication wo n't be a problem . 
  and i promise you , there are tons of epic moments when you play in there . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtso7tmukfu ) makes tons of good pr videos , check out if you are interested !, 
  get some proper headphones this time . 
  most of the `` gaming '' headphones are just popular because of the brand - not worth the price . 
  akg , beyerdynamic , sennheiser . . all of these are high-quality brands who are specialized in audio engineering who do n't use petty marketing . 
  i personally have sennheiser hd 518s - and i love them !, 
  my only complaint is the bad cable , but i can replace it if it gets too bad . 
  also , since these are headphones , you do n't get a mic ; so buy a cheap webcam , mod mic , table mic or something . . 
  i also have asus xonar dgx soundcard . 
  it 's great . 
  if you 're going to buy more than $ 100 headphones , then you should definitely get one of these too , so you can squeeze the most out of your headphones . 
  if you want to play call of duty on pc , get black ops 2 . 
  treyarch actually did put some effort to their pc port ( and to the game itself , actually . 
  atleast when we compare to that abomination . ), 
  another re-post . . * sigh *, 
  debit card does n't work on origin , since it 's a visa electron . 
  also , i used vpn because i live in europe . 
  my paypal confirmation code will arrive in 1-3 days , and it is too late for that sale then . . 
  well i know , thrusting strangers on the internet is hard : at least you could contact mods and tell them to give me a `` biggest douchebag '' - flair or something , if i lied to you . 
  bad rats for 0,40 $ . 
  sure , pretty much anything should be worth that price but nope . 
  even flash games are better than that pos . 
  i have a new debit card and i have n't been able to buy anything from the steam sale yet , because the paypal is still being activated . 
  battlefield 4 for twenty bucks , dishonored for less than five bucks . . 
  i just could n't get them !, 
  [ here 's my steam account .

  edit : who the hell is giving these downvotes ? 
  really mature guys . . 
  . . aaand he 's gone . 
  goddammit , why did you scare him away ? 
  fair enough . 
  i used to enter in all giveaways too in the past , but now i only enter to those which i really want . 
  he prob . 
  thought that i was friendly . 
  since this is your first build , you should also get a mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse . 
  once again , re-post . . 
  i just find it funny how russianbadger makes more or less fun out of ea/dice in pretty much every video . 
  this time it was the slim jim . 
  there 's no way that this player is the best on ps4 . . he constantly does basic mistakes , has bad aim , is in bad positions , does n't notice many guys . . and he is a bloody rank 1 !, 
  downvoted for lying . 
  i think this subreddit is pissed pretty badly about bf4 launch fail and has told it pretty badly . . however , fb/youtube comments people instantly claim you a cod fanboy if you give any negative feedback about bf4 , even if it is broken as hell . 
  they are our retarded little brother which father gaben demands us to accept . 
  yes , it was . 
  but only because ** we ** allowed it . 
  how ? 
  if we all commonly would agree that we should not buy their games until we absolutely know that the game does n't have any major issues , then publishers would be forced to delay the game , because bugs = no income . 
  remember people , ** consumer is always right . 
  ** right now we find it acceptable to run games in horrible condition . 
  so please , stop pre-ordering games and buy them when they are fixed !, 
  [ stop accepting failure !,
