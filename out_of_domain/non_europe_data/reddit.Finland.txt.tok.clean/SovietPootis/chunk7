  and he was so arrogant , he every round called my team `` omg how noob team '' or `` gg guys  '', 
  and that was my call of duty nutshell . 
  i 'm sure your ps3 ca n't handle 2000 players on the same server at the same time . . 
  well , that 's the whole point of f2p games . 
  f2p players are second-class citizens , they do n't have access to everything . 
  in runescape , you ca n't go everywhere , you ca n't get dragon stuff etc. , and you 're stuck to f2p servers . 
  in team fortress 2 , you ca n't get hats and other goodies , and you must wear your ghastly gibus . 
  then there 's pay2win games , like combat arms or battlefield play4free . 
  the whole idea of f2p games is that people can come and play it , and then they hate it or get hooked to it . 
  after that , they realize that if i pay money i will become something more . 
  and that 's about it . 
  in planetside 2 i think , quick access to all weaponry , vehicle & character cosmetic customization and passing server queues will be the reasons why people wan na become members . 
  yeah , i used to be a trader but it 's really boring stuff to trade , so i quit, 
  that 's also one reason why i hate trading . . stuff costs too much . 
  how much is its value , a bud ? 
  also , people are really greedy , and the price of earbuds are already 28 keys . 
  that 's 56 euroes !, 
  and just for small bunch of pixels !, 
  too much for me . 
  f2p players ca n't trade the stuff they dropped . 
  and by `` goodies '' i meant miscs , taunts and strange weapons . 
  sure , you can spent that 1 dollar , but you need keys if you wan na hats . 
  or , you can start trading , but new traders are prob . 
  gon na get sharked . 
  i love tf2 f2p model . 
  you have everything what you need to become skilled player , even if you have n't got a single weapon dropped yet . 
  if you wan na the premium stuff , which do not give you an advantage , then you must spend money . 
  or start trading . 
  if you are going for bills & buds or wan na backpack full of hats you must do something else than just wait . 
  and yes , you can start your trading career from refined . 
  but still , you need to spent that one dollar to start your trading career . 
  and yes , if you pay more for keys , it will make things easier . 
  i solod bronze with salarian melee + arc pistol . . 
  agreed , in many games you get only one gun with it . 
  i do n't know about that . . when i am playing somewhere where 's only few dudes , i have steady 60fps . 
  but when i go to massive battles with 200 players or something , my pc is suffering with 25fps . 
  and , the game is really pretty and has massive maps & fov , consoles just ca n't handle it . 
  and also , consoles would n't allow so big servers , they would take too much network . 
  it does tell from where does the packages come from that website . 
  correct if i 'm wrong . 
  that 's . . impressive ? 
  [ i jumped out of my jet and killed enemy jet with c4 while airborne .

  but my record is 842m , so all i can say congratulations !, 
  in battlefield 2 , you can host your own lan server , and play it yourself . 
  that 's how i learned to fly . 
  you bad bf3 pilots should search for empty 1 player servers and fly there . 
  or search some flying practice only servers . 
  i did n't mean * you * , i mean all * you * bad pilots who are reading this comment . 
  i apologize saying it so offensively , but i did n't mean it . 
  that 's really impressive . . her face , hair & color , armor and filters makes it look really good . 
  possibly the best femshep cosplay so far !, 
  the gun looks shit though, 
  no hats, 
  she just killed the most racist character in the game . . 
  i would n't be so shocked . 
  . . i can only imagine her reaction if someone dies in suicide mission . 
  the game costs 20 bucks , and i can say that mp is worth that much . 
  yes , you should get it . 
  monkeys do it too . 
  today i learned . 
  well , everybody has one of those , even if they did n't buy me3 . . 
  i played that on playstation 2 . 
  and hell it was a fun game . 
  well . . 
  i though you did n't know, 
  i think it 's sfm , not gmod, 
  i guess people did n't get the idea . . 
  image says scream fortress update and the title says mann vs machine update . 
  maybe not the # 1 on my list . . but definitely on top 10 !, 
  one reason more why i am a proud finn . 
  ( aka demospam ), 
  in the first game playing as engineer sucks . 
  it 's very , very lame class to play . 
  on the second game engineer is much more fun class , as well as in 3rd game . 
  agreed , the ending is not that bad than you might think . 
  after the extended cut it actually makes some sense . 
  just watch the original endings after you 've played and you understand why they were so hated, 
  it 's like why nobody makes jokes about chuck norris . 
  he 's the ultimate badass , and nobody wants to fuck with him . 
  same applies to femshep . 
  you will die . 
  soon . 
  chuck norris does n't need to learn how to use a phone , he shouts so loud that everybody can hear him . 
  chuck norris has only one weakness : clint eastwood . 
  reminds me about [ this ] ( http://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0cciqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fthechive.com%2f2012%2f03%2f15%2fman-is-either-crazy-or-brilliant-to-marry-a-doll-12-photos-video%2f&amp;ei=rq6sumrxhq-q4gtdn4daba&amp;usg=afqjcngvnprjsxtods_zpnlf8i9c4rjhuq] ), 
  i do n't know . . 
  i wake up every morning at 6am because he shouts so loud . 
  and his words are highly intelligent , only a person with less than 60 iq ca n't understand him . 
  and oh yeah , eastwood has been in space too, 
  bruce lee and god fought once in space . 
  that place is now called black hole . 
  why use perfect ( * dat ass * ) and arrogant human when you have a huge list other interesting characters ? 
  the black guy, 
  you 're welcome . 
  you are actually the first dude happy about this , not saying that `` origin sucks , i ca n't download it ! '', 
  and i actually do n't care if they watch my stuff in my computer , it 's already filled with shit . 
  let them freely look around !, 
  it 's worth a free game !, 
  agreed , dragoons were disappointing .
