  clegg vs higby - who would win the fight ? 
  somebody plz test . 
  it 's funny how many jokes become reality at one point . 
  so you are saying that if 100 guys can do the job in 10 days , 200 guys can do it in 5 days ? 
  sorry , but that is not how programming works . 
  you need experience and creativity to solve problems . 
  it 's a demolition derby . 
  that 's why they show us how you can smash these cars . 
  these guys also made the flatout series , so this is its spiritual successor . 
  project cars is n't pc exclusive though . . it will come to all next-gen consoles ( later though ) . 
  lol noob uninstall, 
  christmas is nothing but a celebration of capitalism .

  bra nationalen dagen !, 
  i 'm just rolling with my amazing swedish skills . . 
  i could use a new monitor , my 1600x900 fujitsu monitor aint so master-race worthy :(, 
  also , extra money on steam is n't such a bad thing . . right ? 
  korea and babylon . 
  100 % balanced , no question about that !, 
  omg ura such master trole xdxdd i bet u fucked my mum relly hard xd, 
  hey , let 's not turn this sub into r/gaming . . 
  get two 4gb ram sticks instead of one 8gb . 
  dual channel is better than one stick . 
  just google it up !, 
  also , just like u/the _ jicky said , get a cheaper case and better gpu . 
  looking good . 
  however , you should get [ 7870 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-video-card-hd7870dc22gd5v2 ) instead of 7850 . 
  it 's only 10 bucks more expensive , but it definitely is much better !, 
  also , this is an overclocked version . 
  yes !, 
  it 's not fun to be in the receiving end . 
  i do n't think so . 
  he 's saying how massive the secret is . 
  iirc the ship crash also was in the paracel storm is , so i ca n't believe this is the secret . 
  and in the finland . 
  seriously , you would had to pay like ~ 100 bucks for a surgery like that . 
  i was a ps2 peasant for a long , long time . 
  it was a great console , because it had tons of great games and exclusives . 
  then one day i figured out that you can actually play some proper games with it . 
  i saw this game called `` battlefield 2 . '', 
  it looked very intriguing , especially since there was 64 player multiplayer battles . 
  it sounded like insane !, 
  and there i was . 
  with my 7300se i ran the game . 
  it looked like shit on low , but the silky smooth 60fps guaranteed a masterrace worthy experience . 
  i had some amazing time , even though i got my arse kicked . 
  later i bought the sequel , 2142 , which i liked even more . 
  7th generation consoles looked intriguing , but i heard about these stories on screaming kiddies who 've fucked my mum on ps3 and xbox 360 . . how was this possible ? 
  can gamers be these kinda of wankers ? 
  on my time with bf series , there were pretty much fine gentlemen who acted properly . . and there was teamwork !, 
  and later on i decided to stick with the master race , even though those were the dark times for it . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ bought ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ps3 , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ left ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ guys . 
  also , do n't use those goddamn memes . 
  we do n't find them acceptable in this subreddit . 
  edit : advice animals . 
  * internet as a whole would break . 
  i 'm surprised how xm25 dart has so little kills . . it 's a great shotgun !, 
  actually , the pcs are the capitalism and consoles are the communism . 
  pc has competition which results in low prices , while on consoles sony/ms/nintendo can do whatever they want . 
  anybody can do whatever they want with their pcs , consoles are heavily restricted . 
  pcs deliver what they promised , while consoles use false marketing , aka propaganda . 
  i actually did n't realize that it was tb . . 
  i guess i am not big enough fanboi . 
  why do we have to keep splitting up the community all the time ? 
  also , what should we do instead of hunt for easter eggs ? 
  post yoloswag montages ? 
  complain how broken the game is ? 
  few minutes . 
  fail the first mission , ragequit . 
  christmas is nothing but a celebration of capitalism , so . . it fits nc . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wlofjvfvc ), 
  i really believe that most of the manufacturers wo n't do this so they would save some money . 
  but if valve made some special editions . . maybe . 
  battlefield series is a great example where having humor makes a difference . 
  [ bad company 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uahcmxfjlhy ) had a great and funny story , where a us squad go rogue in a middle of us vs russia war , attempting to steal gold from mercenaries . 
  the game is really awesome , it is quite unfortunate that they did n't make it for pc . 
  constant jokes kept me entertained all the time and without them , the game would 've been dull . 
  also the jokes were subjectively good instead of lazy memes or references . 
  bc2 took a step to more serious direction , but the campaign was still solid . 
  then game the bf3 . . the story was very serious , and the story was literally the generic `` evil russian terrorists want to destroy america by nuking it , but good american heroes save the day ! '' . 
  the campaign was imo very poor and cringe-worthy , and i constantly kept thinking `` why put any effort to this ? 
  why not focus to mp completely ? 
  who likes this shit ? '', 
  it is quite obvious that you are under 18 and your parents refuse to buy premium for you , so . . 
  go mow some yards , bitch . 
  they 'd better make a proper port this time . . otherwise i just wo n't buy it . 
  currently the game is so goddamn broken that i personally wo n't buy it , until they fix it . 
  i recommend you doing the same thing aswell . 
  however , if you really want it , you should wait for christmas sales . 
  origin has them too . 
  ( not ) arquinas, 
  higby 's hair, 
  hows your gta v pc fags lolololo, 
  are memes becoming a rule instead of an expection ? 
  i certainly do not hope so . . 
  yes , we do like pc gaming and think that its the best platform , but do you really call console players as `` peasants '' or think that gaben is the god ? 
  was there ever a point in gaming ? 
  what 's the point of life ? 
  why should n't i just kill myself . . that would n't make a difference , would it ?
