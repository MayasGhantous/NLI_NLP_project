  it 's a good weapon of choice - that shit is so op . 
  animal cruelty !, 
  and rightfully so . 
  posting le memes is just . . ugh . 
  got ta love jimquisition . 
  alright , let 's try your logic in a different situation !, 
  the terrorists of 9/11 were muslims . 
  therefore we come to a conclusion that all muslims are terrorists . 
  well , you do n't need to , but i highly recommend still playing it . 
  it 's still a great game , not because of its `` nostalgic value '' , but it actually is great and fun game to play . 
  you 're right . 
  we `` ruined '' the shit of r/gaming for few days , while us went into iraq and killed hundreds of thousands , ruining their shit for . . which is still ruined . 
  so basically we fought back while iraq people could n't . 
  most of us did n't want to participate in it , but causing a shitstorm was the only option , because of that * one * doxxing asshole ruined our reputation . 
  why does ace-52 do 45 damage ? 
  seriously , it kills in 3 shots and it is 2-shot kill if enemy has less than 90hp . 
  not even an assault rifle do this kinda of damage !, 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  just ridiculous . 
  they took our whole subreddit down !, 
  what the hell should 've we done ? 
  just be quiet about it ? 
  also , the reason why this whole mess started . . somebody posted a gaming pc on r/gaming and u/thorse removed it . 
  it started a long argument why they are not allowed while consoles are . 
  apparently they might not be gaming related , while gaming consoles are , even though you can do tons of non-gaming related things with them . 
  when we demanded an answer for that , it was ignored . 
  also , downvote brigades . . you ca n't stop them on any subreddit . 
  if somebody who wants to downvote , he can easily search that threat , even if all names have been sensored . 
  that does n't justify being one of the reasons the subreddit got taken down . 
  r/shitredditsays has done it so many times and reddit admins are apparently completely fine with it . 
  some of our members clearly went too far with it , but it is just saddening that we did n't get proper answers to our questions and our actions caused a lot of trouble while other subs slip away when they do that . 
  . . go back to 9gag . 
  he said something like `` it 's a gurll ... gurll ... '', 
  it 's a good option for a low-budget builder . 
  and you also stress their servers ( if it 's mp game ) , so it 's worse than piracy . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/1t9mlm/amidst_the_battlefield_4_drama_ea_confirms/ ) the thread at r/games on that subject . 
  he uses sennheisers . . he knows what he 's talking about . 
  do you seriously believe that stuff like this will actually have an effect ? 
  the casual market is so strong that ea&a ctivision really do n't have to care if hardcore market boycotts their games or not . 
  but here 's a thing that ** all ** of you should do : ** stop pre-ordering games . 
  ** after the game gets launched wait a week or two , look for professional reviews , forums , gameplay footage , and ** then ** decide if the game is good or not . 
  i stopped pre-ordering games after bf3 and i have ** always ** known if the game is going to be worth my money or not . 
  big companies will continue publishing shitty games , but at least you do n't have to get disapointed . 
  agreed , they might be good on 24 players but they 're just horrible at 64 players . 
  i really hated both maps . 
   ew is the completed version of eu, 
  ehh . . 
  i do n't know man . 
  it feels like something is still missing . 
  it 's like the same situation as with civ 5 : the first expansion fixes a lot of stuff , but it is still lacking something . 
  and the second expansion makes the whole package full . 
  i 'll bet 10 bucks that the 2nd expansion will arrive next years . 
  this . 
  i was really confused why everybody cried how op it was . 
  imo it was balanced vehicle which could be effective if the pilot + gunner were good and they coordinated with mics , but one stinger could deny the area while two of them could take it down ( at least after gunner flares were removed . 
  they were op ) . 
  * i guess they have n't tried out bf2 . . *, 
  if you are xcom fanatic like me and do n't manage to be at home all the time , then i highly recommend getting this game !, 
  the port is bloody well done : yes , it looks like garbage and framerates drop below 10 sometimes ( with ipad 2 ) , but on a turn-based strategy it does n't bother me so much . 
  it has almost all features the base game has . 
  normal classes , game-modes , units , techs . . it even has an ironman and some second wave options !, 
  the only big complaint i have about this port is the lack of maps . . the vanilla xcom already could 've used more maps , but here it is even less . 
  i ca n't blame devs though , since they had to make the game smaller so they 'd be approved to appstore . 
  also , you ca n't customize your soldiers armor color and helmets , but you can get used to that . 
  i bought this thing for full price and i 've had a blast . 
  worth $ 10 ? 
  definitely !, 
  imo squadsight snipers are still op . 
  i did n't meant that bugs are the problem , it 's the lack of content . 
  civ 5 expansions solved this problem . 
  ew brought many features that made early-and mid game exciting , just like first civ 5 expansion did . 
  after that civ 5 end-game was still lacking , and the second expansion solved this problem . 
  xcom has the same problem : once you 've done with exalt , base defense , hyperwave relay and satellites on all countries . . there just is n't anything to do but grind through missions and unlock final techs . 
  soon you have even unlocked all techs , and the game is soon over . 
  so , the late-game definitely needs new gadgets and techs , and also deadlier units . 
  exalt needs plasma weaponry , new alien units , maps , special missions ( like base defense ) . . or possibly multiple bases and skyrangers !, 
  i love xcom , but it still just could be better . 
   dice began charging for extra maps in bf2, 
  battlefield 2 or bad company 2 ? 
  either way , dice did n't charge just for extra maps ; they released proper expansion , which had new weapons , skins , voice acting , tools , skins , factions . . in bf3 & 4 they just released maps with few new weapons and gadgets and uhh . . that 's it !, 
  much smaller than what they 'd previously released . 
  also , in bf2 and bc2 they also released free maps which did n't require any subscription or what-so-ever . 
  and if you are talking about vip pass on bc2 , that is only for used console games . 
  it was free for all new consoles copies and all pc copies . 
  but graphics ruin games !, 
  and back to karkand . 
  even though it uses a different engine , tons of assets are used from original maps . 
  an era has ended . 
  may she rest in peace . 
  and a peasant . 
  well this seems like a thrust-worthy article . 
  get only [ rising storm ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/234510/ ) . 
  you get full access to rising storm and red orchestra 2 multiplayer . 
  yoy do n't get ro2 singleplayer if you only buy rs , but that really does n't matter since sp is shit . 
  if you buy only ro2 you get both sp and mp on ro2 , but on rs you get an access only to one class . 
  i have 10k comment karma and 2,7 k karma on this subreddit alone . 
  i 've been active member of this subreddit when it had less than 10k subs . 
  i do live in europe and i have spare time to browse new-section ( especially during holidays ) unfortunately i have n't got 2 years of reddit time yet ( almost though ) , but i hope that you can overlook that aspect . 
  i might not be the best moderator , but i 'll do my best . 
  i have also reminded people many times about these rules , especially after the r/shallnotbenamed case .
