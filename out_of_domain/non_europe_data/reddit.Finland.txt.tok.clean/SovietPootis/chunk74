  i typed in text chat that there 's maa at x location and it must be taken down in order to gain air superiority . 
  it did nothing though : team is still full of wookies . 
  i even tried it with capslock , but that did n't have any effect . . later on i had to take it down by myself , but i do not think that 's teamwork anymore . 
  when i play with my buddies there will be tons of teamwork , but do you really expect pubbies to take down maa when most of them ca n't even throw ammo packs ? 
  in that particular situation i was flying moderately high - not at the flight ceiling or anything like that . 
  i counted that flares will remove any incoming missiles - nope . 
  my jet pretty much dived to the water and there was nothing that i could do about it . 
  usually i can take those hits but in that situation i was caught by surprise and my countermeasures just did n't work . 
  and ecm ? 
  i stopped using them quickly because they never removed active radar from me . 
  ever . 
  maybe i was incredibly unlucky but every time active radar managed to ignore ecm . 
  a ) i did n't know that in real life people jump out of their jets and take down boogies behind their tales with their rpgs and jump back into their jets . . today i learned . 
  b ) alright , i 'll answer to that question . 
  first of all , ** vehicle is an asset . 
  ** it is an advantage granted for that team , which they must utilize wisely . 
  ** losing a soldier usually means a loss of a ticket , but losing a vehicles removes it for few minutes , giving an advantage for opposing team ** , because they do n't have to deal against that powerful asset for a while ( unless it 's a fast vehicle respawn server , which i avoid at all costs ) . 
  there are jeeps and quad bikes which are mainly designed for transporting people quickly around the battlefield , and they are not well-suited for combat . 
  then there are powerful vehicles such as tanks and jets , which grant strong offensive powers . 
  an equally skilled soldier is in disadvantage on 1vs1 , and rightfully so : he is dealing against a limited asset . 
  now , how he can engage those targets ? 
  ** low-skilled weapons ** and ** high-skilled weapons . 
  against aircraft , lock-on launchers are low-skilled weapons . 
  it is easy to land a shot with these and thanks to this they only do low damage . 
  however , if many of these launchers engage the same target at the same time , it will oppose a real threat against aircraft : this ** promotes teamwork . 
  then there is high-skilled weapons and against aircraft , they are dumb-fire weapons and sraw . 
  using these weapons against aircraft is significantly harder to use , but they grant insta-kill if the shot is successful : this ** promotes individual skill . 
  now , imagine if there were lock-on launchers which would ignore flares and could instantly take down aircraft ; what would be the point of using aircraft then ? 
  that would instantly make aircraft completely useless , because you could n't use them because you would be taken down instantly , no matter how good pilot you were . 
  and what if this power was granted to other assets ? 
  what if an rpg shot could disable a tank from front and instantly destroy it from behind ? 
  would that make tanks viable anymore ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** vehicles are limited assets and because of that , not a single foot-soldier should have the ability to take it down with low-skilled weaponry which he can use all the time . 
  well think about it for a second , what is the story of me after all ? 
  fairly generic space opera about evil who want to destroy humanity ? 
  filled with lots of different races ? 
  no , that 's not what the me is known about . 
  me is known from it 's squad members . 
  most of the people who 've played me always remember garrus , liara , wrex and tali . 
  lots of people think that they are one of the best , if not the best npcs in gaming !, 
  you can very easily get attached to these characters . 
  also , me is known from its interesting universe and races . . but that is not what i meant when i talked about the story . 
  why do you think that the final dlc for me3 was dedicated to squad members completely ? 
  because people really cared about them !, 
  people wanted to say the final goodbye to these npcs that they 've cared for years . 
  they [ brought back wrex as a squad member , even though he was n't your squad member in the vanilla game !, 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  sure , there is an interesting story behind every race but this whole reaper invasion thing . . it really is n't that relevant after all . 
  also , the story of me2 . . if you really think about it , do n't you think that it kinda does n't fit in ? 
  why [ would collectors attempt to invade earth when there 's a reaper invasion incoming ? 
  and since there was n't any connections to collector references in me1 and nothing to do with me3 ( expect that paladin mission aftermath info ] ( / spoiler ) , so it kinda feels like it was somehow squeezed in between me1 and me3 . 
  so i stand behind what i said : story is not that relevant in me . 
  about that spoiler . . 
  i was implying to me3 . 
  in that game he was n't . 
  fine , i was maybe telling about the story too negatively , but me would n't be ( in my opinion ) a good game without all those fantastic squad members . 
  however , you could still have a good game if you had same squad members but a different story . 
  i am wondering how you think that was anger . . did the part a sound like it due to it 's sarcasm ? 
  or my post ? 
  well , that was anger . . but not this . 
  also , i almost always throw my comments in a `` my opinion '' mode , because almost everything is subjective , not objective . 
  you presumably wanted a good answer why this is the case , and i delivered . 
  there is no objective answer to your question , because if i just answered `` that would break the game '' , you could just say once again `` why '' , and i 'd have to answer that subjectively . 
  ultimately explaining these things would lead into question `` what is the point of life ? 
  '' , so let 's not get into that . 
  also , why am i writing long answers ? 
  because i 'm bored . 
  that 's why . 
  i do n't think looking at simply stats is a good solution . . 
  bf3 had balanced choppers : a coordinated team could wreak havoc which could not be taken down by a single stinger , but multiple of them could . 
  this is balance . 
  now , everybody started crying how op attack choppers are while nobody realized that it requires some pretty darn good skill to get those 50-1 stats and barely nobody tried to take them down together . 
  so what happened ? 
  attack choppers in bf4 are pretty much completely useless . 
  maybe the best pilots can somehow use them but otherwise . . no . 
  scout helis are better than them in every . 
  single . 
  way . 
  dice should look some constructive feedback from experienced players instead of looking at stats and looking at those `` omg nerf plz '' posts ( which they stopped doing so , fortunately ) . 
  i would n't consider myself being a jet whore since i do n't even have 100 kills on either of these jets ( but i was in top 1k on bf3 leaderboards , so i 'm pretty good pilot ) , so i would n't call myself a jetwhore . 
  so think about this : if maa from enemy base can take me down fairly experienced pilot when i am in my own base and even my flares wo n't do anything about that , how will worse pilots perform ? 
  if i really wanted to whore with jets , i would play some battlefield 2 : infantry has no stingers , anti-aircraft is worthless and my bombs would one-shot kill everything . 
  who said that i go 1vs1 against maa ? 
  i never engage maas unless they are distracted by other aircraft . 
  jets are supposed to be the king of battlefield : it currently is powerful , but having an ability to destroy on other side of the map while flares do not even work against them ? 
  bollocks . 
  assets ( vehicles ) are supposed to be powerful and challenging to take down . 
  maa is powerful vehicle : i have no problems with its cannon damage or lock-on missiles i have a problem with its ability to take me down because my countermeasures do not work against them , even though they supposed to . 
  playing against vehicles can be challenging and i can tell that from experience . . some people just ca n't handle it and just claim everything op . 
  but hey , that 's why dice made op locker for people you . 
  and where did i say that i am mad that i ca n't be a sky god ? 
  i like to play against maa . 
  it creates a challenge to avoid it and engage it when the time is right . 
  my problem , once again is that active radar missiles can take me down across the map even though i have counter-measures which do not always work against them . 
  and you just proved my point there . 
  if you really ca n't contribute for conversation and go personal all the time , then mindless meatgrinder is just perfectly designed for you . 
  i do n't usually go personal level , but this time you asked for it . 
  ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ filthy ^ ^ ^ casual, 
  finally , somebody talking some sense !, 
  i 've been insulted in this thread all the time , even though i kept my post informative .
