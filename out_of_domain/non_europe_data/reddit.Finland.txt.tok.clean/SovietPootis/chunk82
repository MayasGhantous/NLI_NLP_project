  the general rule is that a proper headphone is more comfortable than gaming headphone due to higher build quality . 
  then stuff like shape also do matter . 
  obviously youtubers push traffic . 
  many , if not most of the indie games nowadays are popular thanks to youtubers . 
  also , most of the people watch youtube channels because of their personalities , not because of the games which they play . 
  also , bf4 has had pretty big issues lately and there 's really nothing else similar to bf4 other than older bfs and planetside 2 . 
  seconded . 
  it is quite easy to take down maxes with rocket launcher and c4 . 
  also , maxes can take punishment fairly easily , if you just keep pulling the trigger . 
  obviously the max is the most powerful infantry class , but in no way it is a `` noob tube '' class . 
  it has lots of disadvantages which might not be so obvious for newbie players . 
  experienced max players know their weaknesses too , so they try to avoid them . 
  also , maxes have had a fair amount of nerfs during the game . 
  they used to be the best solution for pretty much everything , but that is not the case anymore . 
  just use a proxy if you want to use tpb . . but i get your point , it sucks that murican cunt laws apply to ourselves too . 
  then tell me , if controllers are better for shooters then why most , if not all console shooters have automatic aim ? 
  i do n't know about your definition of p2w game , but in my book it is n't . 
  there are only very few things that count as p2w , such as some darker camos make you harder to spot at night , which helps you to play, 
  you can easily kill max level dude , even if you 're just a beginner . 
  there is n't anything like `` super-ammo '' which makes you to do double damage or anything like that . 
  all stock weapons are very good and you can kill stuff with them ( expect esfs ) , but other than that playing fields are pretty even : it 's the player skill that matters . 
  also , planetside 2 is an mmo shooter : individual performance really does n't matter that much after all . 
  filling missing roles is the best thing that individual soldier can do , like starting to repair stuff if there are n't any engineers around . 
  nah , they just want us to buy their dlc . 
  great !, 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uriu143si3w ) an informative video to get started !, 
  my steam url :, 
  ** crysis max edition ** - i really enjoyed sequels of this franchise , especially the crysis 3 . 
  my buddies have told me that the original titles were even better . 
  ** super hexagon ** i want to have an epileptic seizure . 
  thanks !, 
  you ca n't bribe a loyal terran soldier to fight for alien freaks or corporate fascists !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ u/arquinas . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ \u00ees ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ side . 
  indeed . 
  if dice would make a sequel for battlefield 2142 , that would seal the deal . 
  and i have a feeling that there 's going to be black ops 3 announced too , which is set even farther in the future than black ops 2 . 
  i joined the club pretty late . . battlefield 2 . 
  before that i was a dirty ps2 peasant . 
  i assume that you have n't played bf4 . 
  i must massively disagree : the whole point of 2142 was to create a realistic vision of future warfare . 
  almost all stuff in the game is based on technology which exists today : all weapons are projectiles , walkers are fueled by tiby nuclear reactors , emp grenades . . and stuff like forcefiels exist at least on theoretical level . 
  but lasers ? 
  sounds good in paper but theoretically and practically it has proven to be very impractical . 
  i certainly do agree that the technology is rapidly getting better and there are some massive laser guns like [ this , ] ( http://en.ria.ru/images/15649/21/156492136.jpg ) but currently it seems like that laser-based weaponry wo n't be as effective as projectile weaponry , even if they manage to make them conventionally sized . 
  also , projectile weaponry have earned quite a lot advancements in 2142 : pac uses caseless rounds , stationary turrets are extremely accurate rail-guns . . eu apparently has some outdated tech though . 
  however , that does n't mean that bf2142 does n't have some . . ridiculous designs . 
  mechs are iconic vehicles in futuristic games , even though they prob . 
  would be unpractical and unstable as hell when compared to `` standard '' vehicles . 
  hover technology is being used everywhere , especially on pac arsenal . 
  those titans , two massive airborne aircraft carriers hovering in the sky . . that 's some serious sci-fi shit right there !, 
  if he likes to play something like gta iv or skyrim , install some graphics mods , plug in his controller , configure the same keys and map the same buttons as he uses them on his consoles . 
  once he 's been blown away tell him how cheap the hardware actually is and how dirt-cheap the games are . 
  and if he uses `` exclusives '' as an argument , show him something like cs : go , dayz or planetside 2 . 
  or show him some star citizen footage !, 
  and if he thinks pc gaming is dead , show him some proper numbers , like [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/15/steam-tops-75-million-users ), 
  and if nothing helps . . kill him . 
  he 's bringing a great shame to your family !, 
  yeah , i know that it aint an exclusive . . but on a console it 's pretty much a cashgrab due to horrendous controls and no updates . 
  well you definitely got a point there . . this game definitely lacks tougher end-game enemies . 
  the only one that makes may cause trouble is sectopod , but that 's it . 
  early game however . . it might make you blood boil . 
  nice !, 
  next time you 'd better make an imgur album though . . 
  so basically , why did n't i spot that particular unit ? 
  firstly , i had a bioelectric skin which should 've reveal it . 
  i moved my assault in so i could sink its overwatch shot , but . . it was still cloaked . 
  after that i threw a battle scanner for it , it still did n't reveal anything . 
  so i prepped with smoke , in case it was bugged . 
  later on he came in with his ethereal and he used his rift . 
  luckily i had a mind shield ( which reduces rift damage . . ? ), 
  so i took only 6 damage . 
  the cloaked unit took 18 damage and apparently got killed . . but no corpses left . 
  i 'd like to note that there was a seeker earlier on . 
  so is this is a bug after all ? 
  ps that guy was a wanker . 
  he constantly taunted and belittled me . 
  and when i owned him with well-placed movements , he just said `` lucky '' and [ ragequitted . 
  alright , thanks for the help !, 
  finally somebody realizes that just demoting memes is n't enough to save the subreddit . . just look what happened to r/atheism . 
  may gaben smile upon you , noble u/pedro19 !, 
  no wait , wrong subreddit . . 
  well i do n't play it anymore . 
  for someone like me who finds enjoyment on playing well and finding ways to improve himself , [ having completely broken core gameplay mechanics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smyliiadwz8 ) just completely ruins the gameplay for me . 
  so yeah , no matter how fancy the graphics are how astonishing audio design is , having broken core gameplay elements just ruins the whole package for me . 
  i am not a developer so i ca n't tell them what they 're screwing up , but i do n't need to be a bloody doctor to recognize that i am sick either . 
  luckily , there are varieties for bf4 . 
  i 've had a blast with planetside 2 recently . 
  red orchestra 2 is kinda similar to bf franchise , only more brutal to say the least . 
  project reality is a great modification for battlefield 2 , which focuses heavily on tactical gameplay and realism . 
  these games definitely have their issues but they 're nothing what bf4 currently has . 
  then there 's other great games outside of fps genre too . 
  well , since you like rpgs , i definitely recommend trying out mass effect franchise . 
  even though the ending of the last game was questionable , it is still my favorite sp genre of all time . 
  the main strength of this franchise are the characters : they are just unforgettably amazing and well written companions !, 
  just go ahead and try it . 
  it 's great !, 
  wooh , thanks a lot !, 
  really nice that you people do stuff like this ,
