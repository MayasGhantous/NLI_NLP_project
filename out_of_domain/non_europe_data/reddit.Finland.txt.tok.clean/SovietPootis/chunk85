  gunning those maggots down is much easier than killing aliens . 
  their tech ca n't keep up with yours , their gene-mods are pretty bollocks , their spawn mechanics is the primary reason why they 're easy and they have pretty poor aim . 
  early-game actually got . . even harder this time . 
  i am not completely sure , but thin man might 've gotten some aim boosts , but i am not completely sure . 
  also , there are some new mission which will make scream `` what the fuck is this '' . . but i wo n't spoil that much . 
  overall enemy within is an excellent expansion . 
  those new maps alone gives the game so much more replay value . 
  the heavy downside is that early-game is even harder and late-game is even easier this time . 
  sure , mechtoid is a worthy opponent , sectoid commanders do appear on regular missions and sectopod got twice as much health . . but that 's about it . 
  if developers would make new opponents and really buff the exalt , this expansion would be much better . 
  8/10 , i do recommend . 
  africa is actually pretty guddamn good . 
  you definitely should attempt a satellite , because that extra 30 % is hefty amount of money . 
  yeah , i can agree with that . 
  but if you launch 4 satellites + get the biggest funding countries , that 30 % really does help . 
  every time somebody gets a kill beyond rendering distance with that at turret , a kitten will die somewhere . 
  even though the game does n't constantly crash anymore etc. , [ it is still broken as hell .

  i 'm sorry , but i think [ you have too much nostalgia .

  me titles are running on unreal engine 3 , which is fairly light engine . . so unless your pc is something like 8 years old dell laptop , you should be able to run it . 
  mrws should be dished out too . 
  there are sometimes some clever ones like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1wjzug/when_i_alttab_while_playing_a_game_on_the_source/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pbrrf/nvidias_face_when_nextgen_consoles_dont_use_their/ ) , but they are mostly just `` peasant said x thing '' and there 's some laughing dude in the gif . 
  this . 
  this is the reason why bf4 is imo completely broken . 
  i am not exactly one of those people who use the best possible loadout and learn proper gun pattern so my muscle memory would improve , but i am doing my best , fulfill the roles my team is lack and try to improve my gunplay skills every round . 
  and i can also notice when i personally made a mistake in my gameplay and when the game took a dump on my face . 
  i just ca n't play the game because most of the firefights just are n't fair . 
  how can i play the game if the offensive player ( the one who pops out from the corner and shoots ) starts shooting me when i even ca n't see him ? 
  also , most of the time i ca n't take cover if the enemy is shooting me : when get behind the cover , the enemy can still see and shoot me ; ultimately killing me . 
  bf4 looks fantastic with it 's amazing visuals and impressive audio , but because the core of the game is so rotten , i simply just ca n't enjoy playing it . 
  i do not want this message to sound elitist or anything like that , but most of the players just ca n't notice the problems in this game . 
  everybody can notice when the game crashes a lot , but having broken core gameplay mechanics might not be so obvious , especially when the playerbase is fairly casual . 
  i simply ca n't stand the gunplay in this game : the enemy might already be shooting at me while i ca n't see him , i have died behind cover after dashing in 1-2 seconds before i got shot , hitboxes in maps are terrible ( lots of invincible walls and objects ) and so on . 
  i could continue bitching about these issues but let me say it this way : the problems are there , most people just are ca n't notice them . 
  they think that the opponent was just so good or they just personally suck . 
  most people are fine with these issues but for me , it makes the game unplayable and not fun at all . 
  i actually thought that they would get bf4 right this time . 
  since bf4 uses tons of assets which were recycled from bf3 , i expected that dice would 've had time to fix core issues which riddled bf3 . 
  and oh boy how wrong i was . . 
  well , when compared to bc2 . . that 's where you are correct . 
  well , getting shot behind cover should be counted in milliseconds , not in seconds , do n't you agree ? 
  that is what is happening in bf4 . 
  now , i am not sure what the hell is the issue , but we can definitely blame dice . 
  if servers are messed up , then they must get better servers . 
  if the game is messed up , then they must fix the game . 
  if these issues are unfixable ( which i am currently afraid of ) , then they should 've not made the game in a way that it looks on trailer and having rottened core gameplay mechanics which not everybody might not realize , but definitely causes a lot of frustration . 
  well i do n't . 
  i do ( or i think i do ) recognize when it was my fault , but i really do think about situations when i do get killed . 
  if i attempted to make a flank and i get killed , that was my fault . 
  if i dash behind solid cover and die couple seconds later , that 's because the game screwed up . 
  i do understand that every online game has some sorta of lag , but in this game it 's beyond ridiculous . 
  the jump from 570 to 670 is n't that big , but that monitor definitely looks solid and has a good price . 
  that being said , if you have shite monitor and can possibly sell your 570 and your older monitor , then you definitely should go for it . 
  . . flush . 
  let me guess : [ castleminer z ? 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173765673 ) pure minecraft clone which has just been released on steam . 
  well , kids like cod and minecraft so it is no wonder that it is one of the best-selling indie titles on steam . 
  ace of spades actually has some proper effort and uniqueness , but this . . this looks like a pure ripoff for cod kids who like minecraft . 
  as u/cadrid pointed out , you do n't focus on anything outside of pc , so it prob . 
  is n't dungeon keeper . 
  also , [ developers are apparently removing threads from steam page . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/1wyu01/castleminer_z_developer_yes_actual_developer_is/ ), 
  the lack of lens flare , swag and dank is really disturbing . . do you even blaze bro ? 
  ~ 45 % of them . 
  and i am unable to answer enemy threat . 
  i mean , who the hell first gives a bunch of seekers which will most likely wound your units and then gives you a bloody council mission + medium ufo crash site five days later ? 
  and do n't even suggest that i would clear a medium ufo with three 55-60 aim rookies in the second month . . 
  there were some . . things that could 've prevented this , such as getting meld earlier and in that way getting mecs earlier , but noo , obviously the sectoid misses his shot and destroys the bloody canister i am about to capture . 
  i guess my body was not ready for such an . . experience . 
  i guess i just need try again and hope that things will go better this time . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  apology accepted . 
  internet is full of non-native english speakers who just ca n't understand what some of the more , complicated words actually mean , so it might be better to be a. . grammar nazi . 
  as far as i am concerned `` decimated '' is pretty much a synonym for `` destroyed '' , at least when used in the internet and so on . 
  flush does n't always work and even when it does , it is still pretty rubbish ability . 
  there are many , more reliable ways to deal enemies behind cover , and who says that the enemy does n't dash to better cover ? 
  rapid fire however , is one of the best abilities in the game . 
  it allows you to take two shots , which not only allows you to do up to twice as much damage , but [ is also more accurate . 
  ] ( http://sinepost.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/probability-in-games-xcom/ ), 
  combine alloy cannon with rapid fire , and you have insanely powerful gun at your hands . 
  you are guaranteed to do 2x8 damage if you have 100 % aim , and you will most likely crit anyway : 13-15 damage per critical shot . 
  now , what is the max damage to alloy cannon ? 
  15 is the maximum critical damage . 
  bring 'em on grants you up to +5 critical damage , making it up to 20 . 
  use killer instinct , which makes it 30 . 
  now , what about havin ' two of them ? 
  with rapid fire you have a chance to ** one-hit kill sectopod . 
  so yeah , flush is pretty shit and does n't always work , while rapid fire is one of the best abilities in the game . 
  i 've got ta ask something from you : did you never find 2142 frustrating at all ? 
  i mean , do you remember all that nade spam in maps like camp gibraltar , or all those goddamn ar rockets , that infuriating voss which is objectively more superior than any other weapon . . or that fucking rdx , especially when used in titan as a camping tool ? 
  i get it and i agree with you , there has been and there still is many infuriating sides in this game , especially the av turret , but many of these issues have been dealt with . 
  but overall the game is in pretty ok state in terms of balance . 
  is the game really just that unbalanced , or are you just extremely frustrated with the game ? 
  i mean , if you 've esfs for 1k hours , that might indicate that you 're just played the game so much that you are so frustrated with it and you want to accuse everything . 
  i recommend you to have break . 
  maybe month or two . 
  maybe things will get better after that . 
  maybe things are n't so frustrating anymore after you 've tried out something refreshing . 
  well bloody hell . .
