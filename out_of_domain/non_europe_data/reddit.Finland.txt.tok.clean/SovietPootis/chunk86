  how on earth is a picture of a bear related to peasants at all ? 
  yes , it is a meme but you didnt answer to my question : how is a ** picture ** of that bear related to peasants , or anything we discuss about in this subreddit ? 
  well , i do not . 
  and if it 's related in that way , then it is not related at all . 
  `` and they are n't blatant reposts or ** low-effort . 
  make up something `` smart '' , choose the meme , edit the textso it would fit in , done . 
  where is my karma ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1rsfvn/fixed_a_peasant_meme/ ) is a relevant meme . 
  advice animals ? 
  sectopod health = 60 . 
  2x max . 
  alloy cannon shots ( 30 ) = 60 . 
  do you even math ? 
  edit : why did i get downvoted ? 
  sectopod has effectively 60hp . 
  assault can shoot a 30 damage shot with alloy cannon . 
  he can also shoot twice . . 
  i am not in home atm , so . . was the arctic wolf released ?!?!?

  it reminds me about [ this .

  we need tb to do few speeches . 
  that should sort the situation out . 
  he has already earned 707k certs . . 
  the community is small that you just need to hop in to a random server . 
  i recommend finding a good server and sticking to them . 
  if you live in europe , then i recommend trying out [ 40-1 ] servers , if they 're still populated . 
  do n't expect anything that people would use their mics all the time , but there sometimes is a player who takes the lead and tells other people what to do - not that this is a bad thing of course , because if he can organize players to attack at very specific moment , like let 's say after an artillery strike , he can lead your team to victory . 
  and the playerbase is pretty mature . 
  there are some asshats here and there of course , but mostly the playerbase focus on playing the game instead of , you know , raging and trolling . 
  killing floor is pretty solid . 
  it is my favourite zombie shooter of all time - and for a good reason . 
  unlike many other zombie shooters , it focuses heavily on teamwork , utilizing different classes and tactics . 
  not to forget that bloody british humour . 
  it 's a great game for co-op !, 
  origin itself is n't that bad though . . sure , it 's not as good as steam and i would n't use it over steam , but it is n't uplay to say the least . 
  respawn , wan na get pc gamers to play your game ? 
  in that case , give us dedicated servers , mod tools and most importantly : a game that is n't broken piece of shit . 
  * cough * battlefield 4 * cough *, 
  why not ? 
  i mean , if you manage to land twice a 30 critical shot ( which will be reduce to 15 against sectopod ) , it should definitely do enough damage against sectopod , which has 30hp + -50 % damage reduction . 
  or am i missing something heree ? 
  [ yup .

  and no , these were n't just some seldom moments , so this youtuber would make the game look worse than it is - this happens all the time . 
  oh boy , this is going to be a fun episode . . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  their other titles are doing pretty shit though . 
  master trele 2014, 
  how close your other soldiers are ? 
  if you have 2 , or at least 1 soldier quite close , then this is pretty easy . 
  first , try to make a flanking shit with one of your other soldiers against that sectoid behind the police car . 
  if it 's a kill , use your grenade ( if it reaches , it should reach ) against those two sectoids at the door . 
  if you fail , use your second soldier to nade the sectoid at the police car . 
  then , dash rest of your soldiers behind that car . 
  if you succeed in this , sectoids will most likely mind-merge and have two shots after that . 
  the mind-merged one will have 35 % critical shot chance after that , and 25 % aim . 
  he has ~ 7-8 % chance of killing one your soldiers . 
  if he misses , then the other sectoid has only ~ 2 % chance killing one of your soldiers . 
  they both can of course take two shots against a same soldier , but that is only ~ 6 % chance of succeeding . 
  note that possible aim bonuses are n't counted in my math . 
  after that , you have three grenades . 
  try to kill the sectoids using conventional guns so you would get extra weapon fragments , but position two of your soldiers near these sectoids so they can nade those sectoids if your other soldiers fail to kill them ( which is what is going to most likely happen ) . 
  after that , mission accomplished . 
  yeah , i agree with that . 
  mmorpgs have never been my thing though so it 's a pass for me . 
  not that the game itself is bad , the genre just is n't for me . 
  [ i 'm going to throw something wild here . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96z2cd2pf_e ), 
  note that this is best played when your squad speaks russian . 
  i think they should remove completely the damage against heavier vehicles , and tweak damages against maxes and lighter vehicles . 
  in terms of shotgun capabilities it appears to be pretty balance against infantry : no ohk with bodyshots , slow bolt pulling time : you will definitely be in a disadvantage in close quarters against proper cqc weapons . 
  but still , it is a bloody shotgun for the sniper . 
  this rifle seems to be powerful , but i kinda am ok with that if other es sniper rifles at least offer similar efficiency . 
  vs sniper has unlimited ammo but it is harder to use , so this would be very efficient weapon for a skilled camper . 
  tr rifle on the other hand . . are devs really attempting to destroy tr ? 
  tb , you should do some speeches to inspire terran soldiers . 
  tr is losing numbers because of non-diverse & dull weaponry and that fucking horizontal recoil . 
  killing floor is pretty solid . 
  it is my favourite zombie shooter of all time - and for a good reason . 
  unlike many other zombie shooters , it focuses heavily on teamwork , utilizing different classes and tactics . 
  not to forget that bloody british humour . 
  it 's a great game for co-op !,

  i think the current weapon mechanics and stats are fine ( expect that the recoil is just retarded ) , but the weapon model is imo terrible and looks like a vs weapon . 
  i am confident that soe really wants remove tr from this game . . slowly but surely it 'll happen . 
  aside from day 1 dlc , me3 was n't messed up by ea . 
  yes , everybody complains about the ending , but that was terrible writing , not company fucking you to the ass . 
  aside from ending , i would count me3 to be a fantastic game . 
  but that is another topic and i do n't wish to open it up here . 
  now , if you can give me a legitimate source which proves that me3 ending was bad because of ea then please , share it with me . 
  also , co-op . 
  it sounded bad that there would be micro-transactions , but it was actually great !, 
  they added tons of expansion packs which were all free . 
  sure , you could buy micro-transactions but grinding ( playing ) that stuff was pretty fast too . 
  well , lots of players have quit the game because of this , like me .
