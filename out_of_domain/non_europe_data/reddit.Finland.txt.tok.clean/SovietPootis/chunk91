  dice attempted to make a realistic vision of future warfare in bf2142 , so they did n't go too crazy in their design . 
  oh , yes i will . 
  it wont be much , but valve is n't getting my money until they fix them . 
  that means pirating even if the game is at -75 % off . 
  sure , developers unfortunately wo n't get any money out of it but that is n't my fault . 
  they do not give a damn about me . 
  why should i give about them ? 
  stop giving them any money until they fix their issues . 
  buy your games from other sources or pirate them . 
  valve does n't deserve your money , and they certainly wo n't fix their issues if you keep buying those tempting -75 % off purchases . 
  valve gets ~ 30 % cut from all steam sales . 
  that 's too much for them . 
  i would buy their games from alternative sources , but since almost every game that interests me is exclusive on steam , i ca n't do nothing but pirate them . 
  the only time i purchased something out of steam was dungeon keeper 2 from gog . 
  when ( if ) valve gets their thing working on again , i 'd be glad to buy their games from steam again . 
  nah , i 've just realized that valve is as just as money-greedy as ea is . 
  they just make their money more fairly than their competition does . 
  also , they are more successful in making money . 
  even though that their sales are brilliant , their servers are just in an unacceptable state . 
  only fanboys can accept that . 
  maybe if they would n't get so much money , they would get the message . . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  but they do n't give a damn about the server issues or their customer service ; in that way i do n't give them undeserved money . 
  fix your issues , get my money . 
  it is as simple as that . 
  you should cancel your pre-order . 
  before fb bought the whole thing , we knew what direction the vr was heading on . 
  but right now everything is uncertain . 
  it is hard to say what we will get at the end . 
  if cv1 ends up being a great product without any social bullshit , i will definitely buy it . 
  but right now we dont know jackshit . 
  yes , only if they do n't force me to use facebook or any other bs . 
  i 'd rather buy a $ 450 device than $ 200 device with forced facebook & ads . 
  valve does have their headset prototypes . . and if facebook completely screws over oculus ( which is unlikely but definitely possible ) , valve could start developing and producing their own headset . 
  yes , they are n't a hardware company but if oculus or sony ( on pc ) wo n't do it , valve has to do it . 
  if you could stop posting those stupid memes , that would be great . 
  mass effect 1 & 2 . 
  if you are even slightly interested in single-player games , these games are a must . 
  me1 gameplay is choppy , but the story and especiallycharacters are brilliant . 
  same goes for me2 , expect that the gameplay is much better . 
  me3 is also worth picking up from origin if you end up liking prequels . 
  edit : these games arent quick ones , but they are great . 
   why would anyone want facebook to be at the helm of a device that connects to your actual face and streams data ? 
  you know , your smartphone does have a camera . 
  if the nsa or anything likes that wants to see your face , they are already doing it right now . 
  besides , why would they need your face to sell data ? 
  they already have your fb data !, 
  also , your face is already prob . 
  at some database , so . . 
  do n't be afraid of losing your privacy . 
  google/fb/whatever has already sold your personal info to advertisers/nsa . 
  [ ... ] ( http://awesomegifs.com/wp-content/uploads/dead-horse.gif ), 
  so soon ? 
  damn :(, 
  [ i will direct this personally . 
  ] ( http://masseffect.kikaimegami.com/talisummingdirectcontrol05.png ), 
  just no . 
  if you want some squad-based action where people really do communicate , then i highly recommend trying out [ project reality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xts6m7jax9y ) mod for battlefield 2 . 
  fights are pretty slow-paced , walking around is part of the game . 
  you usually get only couple kills per round . 
  combat is somewhat clunky in modern standards , not to mention graphics . 
  but still , it is extremely satisfying game if you seek out for teamwork : you just need to hop in to a public server and join in to a squad !, 
  are you sure that your soldier was standing * directly * above her , or was he barely inside the ring ( which does n't count as stabilization area ) ? 
  if your soldier was standing right at her , then that was one of the many bullshit bugs this game has afaik . 
  agreed . 
  land mines would be extremely efficient in a country like finland - lots of land to cover but not-so many men to defend . 
  just imagine walking as russian soldier in finnish woods , where there could be land mines anywhere . . 
  i 'd be very afraid !, 
  why did you decide to do the ama at r/pcmasterrace ? 
  well . . r/pcmasterrace just might be the best for your game . 
  after looking at those pictures and looking back [ this thread , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/18grkt/art_team_please_stop_this_these_helmets_are/ ) it is certain that we 've come a long journey from those days . . 
  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  on a more serious note : if you 've played any game for about 1600 hours in a such a short period of time , it is no wonder that you get burnt out sooner or later . 
  sure , bug fixes & tweaks and implementing intercontinental lattice etc. 
  will definitely make your experience better in the future , but after 1600 hours the change you 're hoping for might not be as big as you might think . 
  or save that money to upgrade your gpu ? 
  just sayin ' . . 
  ah , alright then . 
  upgrading laptops is definitely trickier than desktops . 
  this gif wouldve been better without those stupid meme texts . . 
  battlefield 2 is still a pretty damn popular game . 
  when i posted this comment , there were nearly 40 servers which had at least 16 players . 
  lots of players are playing this game weekly , if not daily . 
  if project reality ( which has a couple hundred simultaneous players all the time ) gets affected by this , i will rustle my jimmies , and so do will thousands of other players who plays that mod actively . 
  not to mention vanilla bf2 which is much more popular than tons of 2-3 years old aaa titles . . 
  2142 or vietnam might be dying titles , but bf2 still does have a healthy playerbase . 
  that priest prob . 
  stepped on lego with barefoot . 
  so i kinda do understand him . 
  so bf2 , which still has thousands of active players and two major mods in development , will die due to this bullshit ? 
  i really , really hope that ea does something to fix this . 
  bf2 is way more popular than tons of 2 years old aaa titles , and seeing it dying in such a shameful way . . no !, 
  i still do play project reality . 
  hopefully that mod will somehow be preserved . 
  i absolutely agree with this . 
  [ battlefield 2 ] ( https://www.gametracker.com/search/bf2/?searchipp=50&amp;sort=c_numplayers&amp;order=desc ) , [ battlefield 1942 ] ( https://www.gametracker.com/search/bf1942/?sort=c_numplayers&amp;order=desc&amp;searchipp=50#search ) and [ bad company 2 ] ( https://www.gametracker.com/search/bc2/?sort=c_numplayers&amp;order=desc&amp;searchipp=50#search ) still do have thousands of active players . 
  pulling the plug from these titles would be insulting , because they are still rollin ' with a healthy quantity of players . 
  not to mention that the modding community on bf2 is still very active . 
  it would be unfortunate , but acceptable that [ vietnam ] ( https://www.gametracker.com/search/bfv/?sort=c_numplayers&amp;order=desc&amp;searchipp=50#search ) and [ 2142 ] ( https://www.gametracker.com/search/bf2142/?sort=c_numplayers&amp;order=desc&amp;searchipp=50#search ) would be shut down , because they barely have any players on them . 
  rest of the mentioned bf titles should be preserved however , because they are very alive and kickin ' .
