  it 's referring to this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/57dw9a/im_american_citizen_undecided_voter_loving/d8r75aa/, 
  so i would n't say he 's shitposting , it 's more of a `` op delivered '' type of thing . 
  i really wish the anime had filler . 
  so much potential . 
  i ordered it from bookdepository and despite the site listing the release date as the 17th i got it today, 
  i really hated how polnareff blurted out random french phrases and swears in like every second speech bubble . 
  it was such a chore to read . 
  damn , i have none of those . 
  im hoping for tenten, 
  when you start reading part 5 , be sure to read the new black and white scans by jojo 's colored adventure, 
  theyre all up on batoto . 
  you 'll need to create an account though . 
  not really . 
  might wan na spoiler tag that, 
  who is she ? 
  they 're all on batoto , you 'll need to create an account though . 
  to think i bought the game and all dlc for 70 $, 
  black jotaro and green johnny, 
  sometimes i pronounce my favorite song names in the japanese accent, 
  when i bought it i was n't even halfway through part 5, 
  feel le bern xd, 
  is this modern feminism, 
  but will he make anime real, 
  sky high and the rods, 
  he should play limbo, 
  does n't ` got ta ' mean ` got to ' instead of ` got a ', 
  can somebody put ` dont skip parts ' in the sidebar in a big flashy font, 
  just an excuse to recite the lyrics to the portal ending song, 
  japanese anime voices are all overly exaggerated too . 
  stand power !, 
  bring ring ring, 
  they 're gon na censor hayato 's dick with all that fog, 
  trailer next week ? 
  somebody says `` voi vittu '' during the break which means `` oh fuck '', 
  theres a bunch of manga apps out there, 
  i really dug that joke, 
  horriblesubs actually just rips the crunchyroll subs , that 's why the names are still edited in their releases . 
  if you wan na watch the anime with the original names i 'd suggest downloading some-stuffs ' releases . 
  yeah , the blu-rays are uncensored . 
  here 's the release schedule : http://jojo-animation.com/bddvd/, 
  this episode gets released on the 24th of may, 
  [ it was n't shown in the manga so i guess not ] ( http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/01/28/j/read52e74e029aba9/img000010.png ), 
  yeah , viz released the jojonium versions of part 1 and 2 which contain more chapters than the original releases . 
  they 're hardcover as well . 
  part 1 has three volumes and part 2 has four . 
  part 3 was released in 16 paperback volumes but it 's also getting released in the jojonium format which will have 9 volumes . 
  viz does n't really edit their releases anymore . 
  i think they only censored naruto and dragon ball . 
  only difference the hardcovers have are the altered names , for example kars , wamuu and esidisi . 
  speedwagon is still speedwagon though . 
  the artwork is kept the same . 
  even the sound effects are still in japanese with small translations next to them , which is really rare for a viz release . 
  the manga scans on batoto use wham cars and acdc though . 
  i think some fansubs of the anime use them too . 
  but yeah kars wamuu and esidisi are the official spellings, 
  but part 6 has d & g, 
  boi he bout to do it, 
  i got the physical ps3 version and tried the ps4 demo for a while . 
  from what i can tell , the ps3 version is nearly the same . 
  the graphics just have lower textures . 
  asb is on sale for 5 $ in europe, 
  [ quality queen is back ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y6gthtph.jpg ), 
  one of their best , never gets old, 
  parts 1-4 have soshuhen editions , they 're large and contain around 800 pages each . 
  the paper is very thin though . 
  parts 1-6 have bunkobon box sets . 
  the bunkobons are a bit smaller than the regular tankobons and have a few more chapters in each volume . 
  i really like rohan 's colors, 
  just so you know , each part consists of multiple arcs, 
  i was expecting hair bondage, 
  is this lion king, 
  p\u0101sento, 
  part 8 has started to look pretty different from part 7 already, 
  whys that penn and teller dude there, 
  an online art piece, 
  i like them all except incunabula and elseq, 
  how do you even find these subreddits, 
  just one second dude, 
  i never really realized it until i saw the out of context jojo blog, 
  well its a convention exclusive so it 's gon na be harder to come by, 
  around a month . 
  it took me nearly 3 years to read from part 3 to the latest chapter of part 8, 
  `` nato girl '', 
  is calling jews kikes your attempt at being edgy ? 
  i want araki to draw jolyne hentai, 
  you forgot yakuza, 
  monthly animal house ( 1989 -- 1992 ), 
  young animal ( 1992 -- present ), 
  i think he 's trying to say good evening, 
  arent they like 7 years old, 
  i was excited about cr getting funi 's series but none of them are available in finland, 
  chapter 1 page 1, 
  what , you think girls over 18 ca n't have small boobs ? 
  say what you say about part 5 but it has the best fanart, 
  if cruchyroll calls sticky fingers zipper man i 'm gon na cancel my subscription tbh, 
  cowboy, 
  well , the japanese name of part 5 is \u014cgon no kaze , which translates to golden wind , and jayro is just a different romanization of gyro 's name in japanese , which is spelled \u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30ed or jairo . 
  i never understood why every woman is bi in porn, 
  looks more like yukako cosplaying, 
  looks like fugo,
