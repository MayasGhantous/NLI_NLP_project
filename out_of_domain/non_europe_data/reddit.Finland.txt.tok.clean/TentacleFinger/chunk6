  lol so random, 
  the full quote in japanese is, 
  and here 's the panel http://blog-imgs-26.fc2.com/g/i/o/giorno5ger/20080804145122.jpg, 
  try pasting that into google translate and see for yourself, 
  i was trying to say that kira still mentions getting a boner when he first saw mona lisa 's hands in japanese, 
  yeah i 'm guessing they 'll go with `` i got aroused '' or something, 
  rubber johnny, 
  i loved the filler and how bites the dust and the hands dragging kira looked . 
  and the shot of young kira looking at the hands, 
  you could 've just read the wikipedia page, 
  ftfy, 
  is tenten single ? 
  i 'd suggest buying the pal version : https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/b01j4kow82/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1482798556&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=sy200_ql40&amp;keywords=jojo+eyes+of+heaven+ps4&amp;dppl=1&amp;dpid=61ode8opral&amp;ref=plsrch, 
  cool dude , i prefer blue bruno too, 
  i 've seen people mention hunter x hunter a bunch of times , it supposedly features similiar fights, 
  ghiaccio 's moveset would be pretty self-explanatory and foo fighters could just shoot plankton, 
  cdjapan, 
  so is it fresh or dirty ? 
  open your third eye !, 
  ps3 games are n't region locked . 
  the ps3 version is in japanese but the controls are simple enough to learn and you can view the story on youtube . 
  i wonder if the soap got on the lens, 
  would you skip an arc just because it 's boring ? 
  i believe ` ch\u014d ' is written \u30c1\u30e7\u30fc instead of \u30c1\u30aa\u30fc, 
  current jojolion artstyle has a nice cartoony yet realistic look to it . 
  i also like late vento aureo, 
  how much did all that cost ? 
  seems like a fortune, 
  gim me all your change kid, 
  highschool sucks, 
  the disc version costs more because it 's a bit rare . 
  i 'd suggest buying the digital prestige edition , it contains the game and all dlc, 
  in additiom to what dornyth said the bunkobons are a bit smaller than the tankobons and also have kind of uglier looking covers, 
  something something narancia, 
  yeah the tankobon covers are all great looking but the bunkobon covers just have a part of the original cover in small frame and an ugly background . 
  i wonder why viz added those black spots on the logo, 
  t\u014dh\u014d is definitely pronounced toohoo in japanese, 
  yes it can, 
  reminds me of the cover of battles ' album la di da di, 
  nobody i knew had a gameboy growing up, 
  its like tumblr raided reddit,

  but now i 'm back on my shit, 
  you can jump right in to part 5 , but it 's worth checking the manga out too . 
  i personally never read parts 1 & 2 and started part 3 after i finished the first anime season back in 2013 . 
  but thats not nier automata, 
  needs more lung cancer, 
  the same way as ` uguu ~ ' and ` nyaa ~ ' are pronounced, 
  the . zip files have them, 
  the same thing as the manga, 
  the sfx translations are taken from hi wa mata noboru 's releases, 
  but thats not will smith, 
  nearly every time people try to imitate araki 's style it just looks off . 
  i never understood why people even wan na imitate his style , nobody tries to draw like masashi kishimoto for example, 
  i preferred the slower pacing in pt3 , pt4 felt too adhd, 
  am i a weeb for thinking weekly shone jump, 
  its cool, 
  i 'd rather buy sealed copies from ebay rather than those used ones, 
  london 2012, 
  i remember reading a thread like this a few months back, 
  oh man , i did n't know that josuke minissimo figure was already released . 
  i probably would n't buy it anyway , but still . 
  looks really fancy . 
  because all the slice-of-life scenes are really good, 
  such an awful poster . 
  does n't even have the title on it , just a hashtag, 
  you should hear the new island soundtrack . 
  something not related to the song name or lyrics at all, 
  the konoha 11 are not fodder, 
  is this ok ? 
  `` joestar offer '' is the game with an extra dlc costume for johnny . 
  `` prestige edition '' is a bundle with the game and all dlc, 
  i watched the first season of the anime back in around november 2013 . i then started the manga from part 3 onwards . 
  i read part 3 in around three weeks or so , and part 4 in about a month . 
  part 5 took me like a year because the scans were bad and the fights were confusing , and i concentrated more on the part 3 anime . 
  i then breezed through the first chapters of part 6 quickly and stopped for a about a month , and by that time the entire part had gotten colored scans so i read the rest in color . 
  part 7 did n't take me long either , i think i read like 20 chapters a day . 
  as for part 8 i actually catched up to it before even finishing part 4 but i forgot all about it so i read up until the latest chapter in like tree days . 
  this was in like 2016 october . 
  what im trying to say it took me around three years in total, 
  le gem has arrived, 
  i dont understand why people use the term sannin , it literally means three ninja, 
  iirc viz and the games use something like ` three great ninja ', 
  thick outlines are not a jojo reference, 
  which volume is that introduction from ? 
  its just a deliquent with a pompadour, 
  i wish araki retconned narancia 's gender, 
  i wish it was actually sewn instead of glued, 
  i 've been playing yakuza 0 all week . 
  i played through the japanese version back in 2015 and skipped all the cutscenes . 
  now that i understand everything it feels like a totally different game . 
  i 'd recommend to all beat - 'em - up and rpg fans, 
  imagine anasui doing that pose, 
  why is narancia a boy, 
  goo goo dolls is plural too, 
  i thought this was cringeanarchy for a second, 
  its because buff chads are stupid and cant spell amirite, 
  every single time, 
  must be an american thing, 
  people have been saying that ever since the 2012 anime .
