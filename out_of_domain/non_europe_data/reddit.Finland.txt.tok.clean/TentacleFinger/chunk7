  i despise all the forced memes, 
  manga panels of just about every character, 
  they 're have the same covers as the japanese bunkobon release does , [ heres how the japanese cover of vento aureo vol 1 looks like ] ( http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/neobk-304247 ), 
  i was thinking it looked familir but i couldnt put my finger on it, 
  tumblr has a ton of jjba blogs, 
  good , who the fuck uses mastercard anyway, 
  is your le wife le single xddddd, 
  jjba does n't really have suitable music for a game like that, 
  nice indirect harry potter spoiler . 
  grateful dead & beach boy , white album , metallica , jumpin ' jack flash , planet waves , d4c, 
  his name is spelled \u30a2\u30f4\u30c9\u30a5\u30eb in japanese , which reads as ` avuduru ' . 
  it uses the katakana \u30f4 instead of \u30d6 , which is read ` bu ' . 
  so the name has always been intended to be written and pronounced with a ` v ' . 
  the most correct romanization would be ` avdul ', 
  it has really good character designs and the fights are exciting and the powers are creative and the art is good, 
  i got into jojo because the stand powers were cool in the first place, 
  his necklace is actually connected to his ears, 
  i like every part , character and stand equally and have no favorites, 
  he looks like a cartoon character . 
  also fuck gallowboob, 
  pork pie hat kid , polpo , ghiaccio, 
  when neji died, 
  i want a tenten wedding episode, 
  kars ' name and the name of the band are both written as \u30ab\u30fc\u30ba in japanese . 
  however esidisi 's name is \u30a8\u30b7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7 ( eshidishi ) while the band is written as \u30a8\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc \u30fb \u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc ( eeshii diishii ) and the band wham !, 
  is written as \u30ef\u30e0 !, 
  and wamuu 's name is \u30ef\u30e0\u30a6 ( wamuu ), 
  r/popular was a mistake, 
  i prefer every late part style . 
  looks like a 3ds game, 
  none and no, 
  but yanderes are the best, 
  this is a redraw of a picture by apostle, 
  yes , reading the manga is a good idea . 
  nearly everyone on this subreddit has read it, 
  no , you 're supposed to post it in the weekly dojyaan, 
  something classy like the intro song for jojo asb . 
  the japanese title is \u014cgon no kaze , which literally means golden wind . 
  loool he 's wearing socks and sandals at his wedding, 
  just play yakuza ishin, 
  if you hate episodic shows why are you even watching jojo ? 
  every time i see someone use `` lul '' i assume they 're like 7 years old, 
  it really is, 
  those are mangastream 's scans, 
  i 'll check it out . 
  no , not yet . . 
  mizuryu kei is the best, 
  i 've come to le bargain xd, 
  if jjba was set in finland there 'd be a stand battle in a sauna, 
  trying too hard to be like banksy, 
  i want to die, 
  i like them all except gyro , it sounds off, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://giogio.proboards.com/thread/413/spoiler-kidding ) a thread about part 6 's ending from 2003, 
  i was even more confused since i 've disabled custom subreddit themes, 
  sunahara wataru better draw her wearing that skirt in his next doujin if you know what i mean, 
  oh look , it 's the generic tumblr face, 
  is denki a boy or a girl ?? 
  the anime is starting with an arc that is n't in the manga , but it 's still canon . 
  really ?? 
  because storm 4 is already on ps4 . 
  ivrea publishes manga in finland as well , i hope this means they 'll release it in finnish at some point . 
  cathamburger, 
  the manga chapter titles have those too . 
  must be a japanese thing, 
  sheer nose attack, 
  iirc most people wanted jotaro instead, 
  oh man dragon ball is so nerdy xd, 
  it 's a funny picture , but i refuse to upvote gallowboob 's posts . 
  all you want is that sweet karma amirite xdd, 
  yep , nobody really calls it jba . 
  either jjba or jojo, 
  i 'm not a moderator , but you 're supposed to post stuff like this in the weekly dojyaan thread, 
  here 's the entire art book ` jojo 6251 ' : http://imgur.com/gallery/djvee, 
  source ? 
  so wacky and random xddd, 
  but one piece is good, 
  is that matti nyk\u00e4nen, 
  it had it 's moments . 
  hardly working or workly harding amirite, 
  just try to embrace it . 
  ramen is a soup, 
  american porn looks so ridiculous . 
  it 's like it 's sped up . 
  why does every lesbian scene turn into a threesome with a man, 
  many of shueisha 's big titles have digitally colored editions , but only a few of them have english translations , for example jojo and one piece, 
  the only one i can remember is kakyoin 's asb theme . 
  it 's so good, 
  no subreddit is safe from hailcorporate, 
  seems to be the 're - edited ' version, 
  something about r/natureisfuckinglit annoys me so much, 
  do you know what r/wholesomememes is about ? 
  tom of finland vibes, 
  ari means ant in japanese , but the battle cry is supposed to be the first syllable of arrivederci , at least in japanese . 
  hentai where some dude has tentacles coming out of his fingers . 
  guess the rest . 
  but they 're parts , not arcs, 
  but it 's not the english release, 
  the japanese release costs around 700 dollars in total and does n't include english subtitles, 
  the ova ends just before this arc . 
  it does n't exist,
