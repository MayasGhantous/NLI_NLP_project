   gamergate is a recent exampe of this . 
  the meaning of the word is n't defined by the majority of the people participating in the movement , but by media outlets who define it as a `` hate movement '' in their stories or give publicity to people who express such views . 
  this is how a movement concerned about journalistic integrity in gaming media got redefined as an anti-woman hate movement . 
  it only took a few articles in which they defined the people who made threats as typical gamergaters . 
  once larger publications started using the word to refer to people who harrass game developers , the fight over the definition was lost . 
   on related note , it 's funny how you can criticize game developers and the industry all you want . 
  but once you call bull on ridiculously bad arguments which try to paint the industry as blatantly anti-woman , you 're a `` misogynist '' and a `` harrasser '' . 
  the philiph roth example is really aggravating . 
  attkinsson and roth are people who have no trouble whining about inaccuracies on wikipedia but when it comes to improving the situation they ca n't be bothered to do anything useful . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=the_human_stain&amp;oldid=472630468 ) is how the article in question looked like on january 22 2012 , before any of this useless drama . 
  as can be seen from the article 's [ history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=the_human_stain&amp;offset=20120907181316&amp;action=history&amp;tagfilter= ) , someone claiming to be roth 's biographer removed the `` incorrect '' references `` at philip roth 's insistence '' . 
  firstly , this is vandalism , pure and simple . 
  they removed information about a critic 's interpretation about the book , allegedly because the author did n't like it . 
  secondly , how in the fuck are we supposed to verify they 're acting for the author ?!, 
  the edit was made from the ip address 166.147.72.21 and the exact same vandalism was repeated the same day from another ip ( 166.147.72.32 ) after a revert . 
  thirdly , and this really is the icing on the cake here : roth had never published anything to correct the misstatements before writing his whiny [ open letter to wikipedia ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-to-wikipedia ) on september 6 . 
  that 's right , roth wanted sourced information removed from an article and have that replaced with unsourced information ( remember , he had n't published anything to refute the critic 's interpretation ) . 
  and get this : roth petitioned wikipedia to remove the `` misstatements '' through his `` official interlocutor '' ( i 'm guessing the biographer ) . 
  the interlocutor wrote a letter to wikipedia and got a standard response from an admin , which was a reference to wikipedia 's sourcing requirements . 
  so instead of taking 5 minutes to read up on wikipedia 's rules on sources he had someone vandalize a wikipedia article and write a fucking letter , wasting the time of an admin and regular editors . 
  ** tl ; dr : author does n't like critic 's interpretation , has his biographer vandalize wikipedia . 
  complains that wikipedia editor 's ca n't read his mind . 
  her wikipedia example was extremely shit too . 
  i just [ ripped my dick off about it in another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/2xs37k/sharyl_attkisson_an_investigative_journalist/cp3ne9z?context=3 ) .

  the save location for me is '' ~ / . steam/steam/steamapps / common/torchlight ii/my games/runic games/torchlight 2 '' . 
  this is on linux mint 17 with a default steam install . 
  runs only decently on my machine , 40-60 fps on the starting area with max settings at 1080p ( mostly 40-50 fps , fires/particles seem to lower it from 60 ) . 
  in the estherian enclave fps goes down to 30-36 !, 
  i have vsync off btw . 
  my specs :, 
  amd fx-8320, 
  radeon r7 260x, 
  i 'm using the open source drivers from oibaf 's ppa , which probably explains the performance difference . 
  it also seems that the fps is limited to 60 even without vsync . 
  which is a shame if you have a monitor that can go higher . 
  not really . 
  the site summarises software licenses in general , not only open source ones . 
  the submission title is misleading . 
  i also have this problem . 
  however , there is no problem when i create a completely new firefox profile and install res as the only add-on . 
  i 'm fairly certain neither noscript or \u00b5block is the problem , as i disabled both of them and reloaded the page . 
  i 'll dig deeper if i can find the time . 
  * night mode : true, 
  * res version : 4.5.4, 
  * browser : firefox, 
  * browser version : 36.0.1, 
  * cookies enabled : true, 
  * platform : windows, 
  there 's also an issue with security . 
  anyone can join a public bittorrent swarm and get a list of peers who are requesting a specific file . 
  if this file is a critical security update , it 's possible for an attacker to obtain multiple targets from the swarm and pull off attack ( s ) on them before they 've applied the update or before the vulnerable components have been reloaded ( in cases where a program restart or even a full reboot is necessary ) . 
  this rather interesting possibility came up elsewhere in a discussion about windows 10 's upcoming p2p patch downloading feature , which probably inspired this reddit submission . 
  one might argue this is n't a big risk considering the relatively small user base of linux-based oss , but i think it should still be taken seriously . 
  i 'm starting to think that the only way to stop these bionic password replacement fads is to let them become more common , allow them to become the center of a few catastrophic security scandals ( let the heads roll !, 
  ) , and just let natural selection take care of it . 
  why are these biometric logins even supposed to be a thing ? 
  fingerprints and faces are n't supposed to be used as passwords because they ca n't be changed once they 're compromised ( which will happen ) . 
  the only thing they can be used is as a user name , and even then it 's directly tied to your identity , which is n't always ideal . 
  or ca n't people be bothered to remember their user names , is that it ? 
  though i 'm sure there are parties ( governmental and others ) who would love to access people 's computers without their consent just by waving a picture of their face in front of their webcam . 
  i was n't referring to attacks involving sending crafted software packages . 
  as you said , that particular threat has already been taken care of rather well . 
  what i mean is that joining a bittorrent swarm gives an attacker an easy way to find many vulnerable machines . 
  let 's say there 's an update available for a package which fixes a serious remote code execution flaw . 
  all an attacker needs to do is join the swarm with this particular update package 's hash ( public information ) and become a seeder ( or fake being one , does n't matter ) . 
  he will start receiving requests for pieces of the file from peers in the swarm . 
  since peers downloading the file are very likely obtaining it for the purposes of installation ( and patching the flaw ) , the attacker is now getting ip addresses for machines which are vulnerable to this specific code execution flaw . 
  even if the addresses are n't ipv6 , they 're still good pointers . 
  and with ipv6 becoming more common , it 'd be more likely the addresses were for network interfaces in actual machine rather than those in routers . 
   do n't you think we could do with a little more diversity ? 
  natural diversity is okay . 
  however , the thought that diversity ( be it gender , cultural , or racial ) is inherently good is very dangerous because it can lead discrimination . 
  we 've seen this with various outreach programs , such as gnome 's outreach program for women : the core idea is to recruit people based on their gender , not just the fact that they 're capable . 
  girl develop it seems to be the same , but taking it a step further , as their website states they help `` women of diverse backgrounds '' . 
  it seems that being a woman is n't enough , you also need to be part of a minority group . 
  this is the kind of stuff i refer to when i say `` dangerous '' . 
  glorifying diversity can lead to thinking that some group being homogenous is due to discrimination or some other form of social injustice . 
  and when you start throwing money at organisations who try to get these supposedly disadvantaged groups involved , you 're definitely doing it wrong . 
  and regarding what you said to another commenter ( `` are you a female ? 
  because if you are n't then you are n't really in a position to say that . '' ) ... 
  you 're sailing in dangerous waters . 
  if you actually think one 's gender makes a difference when making a statement about discrimination in the industry , i recommend some serious introspection . 
  to me that statement sounded like `` you are n't a woman , so you ca n't possibly know enough this subject to talk about this . 
  therefore , your argument is invalid . '',
