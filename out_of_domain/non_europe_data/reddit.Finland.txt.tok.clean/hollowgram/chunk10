  [ read before spewing your ignorance . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taliban#origin ), 
   the taliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from afghans weary of the corruption , brutality , and the incessant fighting of mujahideen warlords . 
  two contrasting narratives explain the beginnings of the taliban . 
  [ 20 ] one is that the rape and murder of boys and girls from a family traveling to kandahar or a similar outrage by mujahideen bandits sparked mullah omar and his students to vow to rid afghanistan of these criminals . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . 
  the other is that the pakistan-based truck shipping mafia known as the `` afghanistan transit trade '' and their allies in the pakistan government , trained , armed , and financed the taliban to clear the southern road across afghanistan to the central asian republics of extortionate bandit gangs . 
   although there is no evidence that the cia directly supported the taliban or al-qaeda , some basis for military support of the taliban was provided when , in the early 1980s , the cia and the isi ( pakistan 's inter-services intelligence agency ) provided arms to afghans resisting the soviet invasion of afghanistan , and the isi assisted the process of gathering radical muslims from around the world to fight against the soviets . 
  [ 24 ] osama bin laden was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign muslim volunteers . 
  the u.s. poured funds and arms into afghanistan , and `` by 1987 , 65,000 tons of u.s.-made weapons and ammunition a year were entering the war . 
  '' [ 25 ] fbi translator sibel edmonds , who has been fired from the agency for disclosing sensitive information , has claimed united states was on intimate terms with taliban and al-qaeda , using them to further certain goals in central asia . 
  [ citation needed ] the taliban were based in the helmand , kandahar , and uruzgan region which is overwhelmingly pashtun territory and predominantly durranis . 
  [ 26 ] the new york times reported that the reagan administration delivered several hundred stingers to afghan resistance groups , including the taliban .

  it seems to be totally random which fonts cause the machine to beg for mercy . 
  if the font is large ( grunge-type ) then that usually guarantees longer loading times .
