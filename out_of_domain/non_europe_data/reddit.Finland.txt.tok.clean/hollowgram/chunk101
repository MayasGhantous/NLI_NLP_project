  the more apps you load in and pin to the dock , the faster the battery goes though . 
  still rocking 58 % after a long day with 8 items in the dock . 
  icloud drive and/or an app like documents does n't suffice ? 
  it all depends what files and what you expect you can do with them . 
  with documents you can even unzip files etc. 
  you said `` have a good day '' so you thought about the reader , * poof * you are a ux designer . 
  wow , more concept than i expected . 
  great stuff !,

  thanks , removed comment . 
  google maps has this widget as well ? 
  reddit is huge . 
  there is no single unifyibg point , some even hate cats . 
  they do reduce prices as they ramp up production and phase out previous gen offerings , just like with the og rmbp . 
  what are you on about ? 
  a lot of blind people use computers daily . 
  the author is not saying that apple is doomed , rather he 's making the argument that because of an operations mindset , apple will continue to focus on short-term gains through refinement and maintaining their trajectory at the expense of long-term potential with new markets that have the potential to make their business model ( s ) irrelevant . 
  * for the us, 
  you can divide the tb3 ports into 24 separate inputs , you just need hubs . 
   there is no way to directly connect the iphone to the mbp, 
  not out of the box , [ but there is a cable ] ( http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/mk0x2zm/a/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1m ) . 
  have you tried wireless camera transfer solutions ? 
  good luck . 
  is that jpegs or raw ?

  i was merely countering the absurd notion that none of the claims in the photo have a basis in what trump has said or done . 
  one can be split for two normal monitors ( not sure if 4k is possible from both ) but you 'll have data bandwidth left over to plug in other things into it as well . 
  for example new 5k lg monitor has 6 part usb 3 port hub and ethernet . 
  these new connectors have 50gbps to give , each , both ways . 
  highly doubt connectivity will be the limiting factor for you . 
  is that considering a potential carbon tax to truly account for the costs created by using that fossil fuel ? 
  i still do n't get hdr on monitors : is n't it all about the source material ? 
  ok , so it 's more bit depth than anything , providing a wider color gamut ? 
  who says the cold war ever really ended ?

  everyone losing their shit about this is hilarious . 
  i dont get why they dont have up/down swipes to reveal other tools . 
  the f key reveal kinda looks like a vertical reshuffle already . 
  restore would probably increase performance . 
  i 'd think real water would be viscous ? 
  the drops would form a bigger drop more than just casually passing by , no ? 
  maybe once i tried and it could n't do it ? 
  i think it was to set a timer . 
  sketch and marvel are a better fit for me . 
  xd has promise but it still feels way too bare bones for any real work . 
  try documents , might do the trick for ya . 
  it 's ridiculous how badly apple has managed the app store since release . 
  devs get very limited sandbox abilities and near zero effort in moderation , all the whole taking 30 % . 
  the big takeaway is that you ca n't copy paste a concept to another platform and expect success . 
  it takes work , this merely erodes trust . 
  i use the logitech create keyboard ( also has a place for the pencil ! ), 
  and i love it . 
  no fn + delete which is a bummer , but otherwise works exactly how i want it . 
  lots of apps lack advanced features , but it 's the bomb for basically everything text-related . 
  i much prefer it as a note-taking device vs. 15 '' mbp , less intimidating/blocking in client meetings and a breeze with multitasking . 
  sure , it could be better , but i use it nearly daily . 
  i did n't originally have the keyboard and getting it made the pro 10x more valuable as a tool . 
  it 's taken over a year . 
  i owned a second hand 6s and thought the previous owner gaffed it , so i did n't bother taking it to repairs or anything . 
  sad to see it 's taken so long to address this , but i guess/hope it 's only affecting a small percentage of users . 
  i already moved on to the 7 , it 's a shame to know whoever bought it will probably not get it fixed .

   there is a possibility that android users may embrace apple watch without buying an iphone , ipad , or other apple product .

  donnie strong !, 
  aside from leia and tarkin valley , i really enjoyed this . 
  it felt like the original trilogy wrapped into a single movie : causes found , fathers murdered , climbing tall places and a small rebel force fighting in the tropics . 
  but it elevated itself . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of the star wars movies but i enjoy them , and this was really satisfying . 
  then when vader came , it was amazing . 
  really enjoyed it , leia was forced ( could have gone without the full frontal face reveal ) but a beautiful way of wrapping it up and tying it to the fourth . 
  gon na recommend this to everyone . 
  people , rethink the movies you go watch .

  not likely .
