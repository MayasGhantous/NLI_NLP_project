  what charging issue ? 
  you do know the pencil comes with a female to female adapter to be used with a lightning cable ? 
  people do n't actually charge by having it hang out of an ipad except when you 're in a pinch , that feature is meant for pairing . 
  yes , the original creator of the idea of things eminating from people 's heads . 
  i think so , you need to buy separately . 
  ebay has cheap alternatives . 
  worst part is the lack of focus control .

  we already abort most pregnancies that have an extra chromosome and its pretty standard to eradicate disease from ivf babies . 
  is n't it ethical to ensure a healthy life when possible ? 
   for instance , parents can choose to screen embryos created via in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) for sex or diseases , a process known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis . 
  scientists have also recently reported a method of extracting defective mitochondria , the energy powerhouses of cells , from a woman 's egg and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg .

  steve jobs was one of the first people talking about the `` post pc era '' in macworld 2001 . iphones and ipads helped catalyze that change . 
  sure , the last five years have been boring and apple deserves flack for dragging their feet with macs and not being as progressive with machine learning/siri as we would want , but that at least is something every player struggles with . 
  fact is , last five years have been relatively boring on all fronts in tech as far as mainstream products/services are concerned . 
  most of the change/progress has been backend/behind the scenes , revving up to something bigger , such as ar/vr and context-rich ai . 
  i dunno , for me aperture was a shitshow in terms of performance vs. lightroom and its centralized database corrupted and lost my originals , only noticed once all backups has been replaced with the corrupt version .
