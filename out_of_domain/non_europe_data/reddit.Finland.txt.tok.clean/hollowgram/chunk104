  document it and submit it , i 'd upvote , 
  show us this left and this proposed plan you speak of . 
  i hope so as well , but i 'm doubtful . 
  they are on so many platforms that have so many more users that i 'm not sure they 're ready to dedicate resources to make it happen . 
  developing on the watch is a headache , can only imagine how hard it would be to make music streaming happen via sdk . 
  i strongly believe/hope that the notch will be hidden later on in landscape mode . 
  right now it 's seems a bit like a mess . 
  `` hey lets spend a lot of money to make a subpar experience for a gazillion different devices so we can maybe move a few units while we damage our reputation of delivering seamless experiences while using our limited resources on a competitors platform . '', 
  genius . 
  i want to hear what other redditors have witnessed during their years of halloween festivities , what 's the most wicked decorations you 've seen/been scared to death by , what games did the hosts have to get everyone wasted and fornicating . 
  any nightmare scenarios ? 
  personally the best party i was at was last year ... it was n't so much the place as it was the booze and atmosphere and happy ending , 
  it 's annoying not having videos there to always click . . the assortment of subreddits on the top bar seems always in flux and totally at random . 
  what gives ? 
  i find it strange that an unused shirt i 've left on the floor for a few days smells like it has n't been worn since my first birthday while a used shirt can go a week without getting this smell . 
  even keeping them in the closet nicely tucked does n't seem to eradicate this . 
  i do n't sweat much and my odor does n't stink , what 's causing the fabric to get this smell and how can one avoid/get rid of it ? 
  so i 'm soon making the dip to get my first d-slr , i want to be able to take a wide array of photos . 
  of course a solid telephoto lens ( i 'm looking at the canon ef-s 55-250mm f/4 -5.6 is currently for that ) , but what else ? 
  should i purchase the kit where i get the default lens or should i opt for something better ? 
  thanks in advance for the input . 
  edit : oh , and i 'll hopefully be doing all kinds of photography from nature to portrait , so do n't let that be a limiting factor . 
  lem me know what 's out there !, 
  and if humans would n't aspire to mate none of us would be here !, 
  all i 'm saying is that nomenalizing such a great community misses the point entirely . 
  food is more than the molecules it consists of . 
  let 's make every part of our lives as good as they can be , including this site we spend so much of our time in . 
  ok , if you do n't want the back story , skip to after the line :, 
  i 'm a 22 year old aspiring multimedia producer living in finland . 
  i was supposed to go to tanzania earlier this year ( around september ) after planning a business venture with a tanzanian friend who lived in finland who owns land there and ( at least claimed ) to have strong connections to key people over there . 
  unfortunately there was a total communication breakdown and i 'm still here ( freezing my ass off ) without the plan going any further . 
  i 've decided i do n't want to do business with someone who ca n't keep me informed on what the situation is or in general keep communication going . 
  i 've tried contacting him and every time i do he gives me assurances and not much more . 
  the story is more complicated naturally but that 's the gist of it . 
  i have a friend living in tarragona who runs his own company and has offered me a chance to start a multimedia production/marketing division that i can run in barcelona with his brother . 
  we hashed out the plan and now we need to get it going , which brings us to the current situation :, 
  i need to find a place to live in around the barcelona area . 
  it does n't have to necessarily be barcelona but quick transportation to barca ( within an hour ) would be necessary . 
  it would need to have two bedrooms ( or at least two separate places to sleep ) and at least some level of furnishing . 
  it ca n't exceed $ 600 ( ideally $ 500 ) in monthly rent . 
  unfortunately my friend has only moved to tarragona in the last 4-5 months so he 's not superbly versed or networked to figure out how to go about getting a crib , especially one that is n't from an agency ( who ask for higher prices and one months rent as a reward ) . 
  we 've tried searching online , calling and emailing people ( even [ barcelona 's craigslist ] ( http://barcelona.craigslist.es/ ) ) but so far all we 've come across are scammers ( funny stories ) and people who ask for something closer to a $ 1000 , the latter of which is understandable because i 'm quite sure downtown barcelona does n't have many furnished apartments going for less . 
  location is secondary , pricing is key . 
  if there 's anything a multimedia producer can do as a counter-favor , let me know . 
  ** edit : ** the reason it 'd ideally be before new years is because my friend is paying for the rent until we get business running and he wants to spend new years in barcelona with his family , so if he 'd be able to live in the apartment for new years it 'd save him the trouble of spending more money on a hotel room . 
  and yes , he 's a stand-up guy in every way , 
  i mean , did n't apple revamp the program at least in sl to be more efficient ? 
  how can my otherwise fast computer be brought to a simmering halt when opening such a small file that 's built on a technology ( true type font ) that 's nearly as old as midi ? 
  in the beginning when the guy is brought in front of the tribe , the leader family has a dispute that others experience first-hand and have an influence in what goes down . 
  i 'm pretty sure human culture for tens of thousands of years was very similar , those who know better please do correct me . 
  our current state of affairs stems greatly from our social heritage and everything from gossip to politics stems from our primate past . 
  i remember reading about how primates who usually lived in groups of 30-40 multiplied into the hundreds or thousands in a zoo that caused them to be very stressed and associated only with their family group and a few others . 
  when they would be fed they would look directly at the ground and eat what 's in front of them and avoid all possible conflict . 
  i think if we became more aware of our blueprints that we inherit as members of earth , we as humanity could grow our understanding of our behaviors and motives . 
  how aware are you of your blueprints ? 
  besides the obvious being born , going to school , etc. 
  i 'm really interested in hearing what * you * hold to be the most important choice that you have made that has affected your life so far . 
  this is n't an easy question and had to struggle for some time to make an answer myself . 
  after much deliberation i 've come to the conclusion that the choice that had the most effect on who i am today was to watch david deangelo 's advanced series seminar when i was 15 . 
  my friend had found out about him through some means and asked me to find him the ebook , which i did and read myself . 
  this led me to acquiring his seminar and watching it in three days . 
  before this i was quite shy and unsure of how we function as social beings ( `` the rules '' ) . 
  i had a relatively tough childhood ( no father figure , moving to different countries several times before the age of 7 ) and watching the seminar gave me not only a sense of approval to express myself , but also some guidelines to sculpt my self-image . 
  this newly-found self-respect/confidence led me to socializing with girls ( our group was an international class where my friends were mostly males and did n't integrate that much with the majority of kids my age ) . 
  at one point i had three girls i considered my girlfriends and that picture did n't end up too nicely , but it taught me a lot about our emotions and values . 
  all of this led me to find a girl who was hands-down my dream girl and we went out for over a year , i focused my energies into making it the most awesome relationship i could foster , which was n't hard as reciprocated love was something that i had n't really experienced at such a deep level before . 
  my focus on her instead of my group of friends led me to miss out on a lot of shady growth periods they went through and facilitated me experiencing sides of life i would n't of probably been exposed to . 
  i 'm fairly convinced that without deangelo and the following course life took afterwards i would n't be the person i am today ( naturally ) . 
  his other seminars later in my life ( 2nd edition of advanced series , man transformation ) have helped me a lot to grow as an individual later in life and not merely on how to chase tail , i feel it has helped catalyze the change within me through information and inspiration . 
  what , in your opinion , changed it all for you ?

  [ age of stupid ] ( http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_xmtizodm2nzq4.html ), 
  if you have n't convinced yourself that we 're heading towards a path of self-destruction , i do n't think you 're looking at the situation head-on . 
  i feel that we are * really * fucked and we ** really ** need to wise up and take it to the streets . 
  i 'm thinking everything from restaurants to web design services . 
  i recently moved here and do n't know the language , so knowing where to go put my links would be very useful . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  i mean , [ these ] ( http://www.rkm.com.au/cell/animalcell.html ) are [ great ] ( http://www.science-art.com/image.asp?id=1319&search=1&pagename=animal_and_plant_cell ) and [ all ] ( http://www.rkm.com.au/cell/ ) , but after reddit made me realize that eggs are essentially one big cell ( largest being an unfertilized ostrich egg ) i became fascinated with how different cells can be . 
  does anyone know of a website that shows various animal , plant , fungi and bacteria species ' cell photos and of liver , heart , muscle , etc. ? 
  i 'm really interested in seeing the differences . 
  i 've read the anecdotes of ` that one kid in computer class who would sit in front of a computer and it would stop working ' and felt the confirmation bias sometimes ( oh how the computer stalls at the most opportune time ) , but i came across this :, 
   [ . . ] physicist wolfgang pauli , whose talents in this area are so legendary that physicists have jokingly dubbed it the `` pauli effect . '', 
  it is said that pauli 's mere presence in a laboratory would cause a glass apparatus to explode , or a sensitive measuring device to crack in half . 
   in one particularly famous incident a physicist wrote pauli to say that at least he could n't blame pauli for the recent and mysterious disintegration of a complicated piece of equipment since pauli had not been present , only to find that pauli had been passing by the laboratory in a train at the precise moment of the mishap !, 
  there 's of course the pseudoscience of pk , but that 's not relevant to what i 'm asking . 
  have you or someone you know ever caused equipment to malfunction repeatedly ? 
  the business owner has been learning coding and spends endless hours tweaking and figuring out what he 's doing , seeking to improve his search engine ranking . 
  granted , he has a very reputable business and claims his website gets him business , which to an extent it 's true . 
  in paranoia i do n't want to link to the website directly , but it 's a basic web 1.0 design . 
  i 'm trying to sell him on the idea of creating a design for him and creating a cms back-end so that he can post updates , blog and have a nice , clear style-set to add content however he wishes . 
  all-in-one seo and sitemap xml plugins etc. 
  do n't mean a thing to this man . 
  i 'm feeling a sense this could go bad if i venture to continue , but i did tell him i 'd at least send him my proposition . 
  what do you suggest i offer/tell him ? 
  i do n't know what i did , at one point this worked and now it does n't .
