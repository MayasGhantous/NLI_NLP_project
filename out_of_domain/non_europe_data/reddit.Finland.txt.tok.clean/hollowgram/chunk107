  i can be a bit claustrophobic , my worst fears center around being in a mine/cave , having it collapse , being stuck in a small space unable to move or breathe well , slowly dying from lack of oxygen/nutrition . 
  i have many dreams where i crawl through small spaces , the thought terrifies me to be stuck in a small space , unable to escape by fitting through a small passage . 
  makes me think i might have had a tough time at birth :d, 
  what death terrifies you ? 
  ** edit : ** whoa . 
  part of me regrets this post , another part is very impressed by the responses . 
  i 'm in europe , so this is a genuine question . 
  the guy seems to know his shit , has ideas and i truly believe your country needs more men like him in congress and senate . 
  so , anyone not voting for him for any particular reason ( s ) ? 
  campaign : http://schiffforsenate.com/, 
  so i 'm nearly overdue for a project , the biggest sticking point is that i ca n't get the friggin ' language pack to work . 
  i downloaded the oscommerce finnish pack and converted it into oscmax ( lots of lines and files missing due to the extra plugins oscmax has ) . 
  every time i try loading the language i just get a blank white page . 
  i try uploading one file at a time ( could n't get past the definitive * . php root file that contains most of the important stuff ) . 
  i converted all the umlaut characters into unicode . 
  i tried combing through the code and everything seems to match up . 
  but no !, 
  it just wo n't load . 
  website : http://www.koirankauppa.fi/index.php ( finnish is current , finn was an attempt to bring in files one by one ) . 
  language files : http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5612065/finnish%20for%20oscmax.zip, 
  also , for some reason the thumbnails are n't showing up except on the product page . 
  any tips for that would be appreciated , templatesquare ( where i bought the template ) has n't responded to my inquiries . 
  thank you all in advance , i appreciate the love . 
  i 'm installing oscmax and it automatically switches to english ( due to my computer settings being in english ) , but the store needs to be in finnish . 
  how can i make the . php file force ? language = fi onto the end of the url ? 
  i 'm assuming there 's something that i can add to the main template file that will then keep the pages at that language . 
  prompted by the recent `` my favorite trick to get the kiss '' thread , i think it 's important to state that anything you read wo n't be gold or shit by itself , it all comes down to you . 
  that 's why it 's important to think about inner game and social dynamics . 
  what is the difference between a success and crashing ? 
  what kind of body language are successful guys doing and what do i * really * look like ? 
  ask a friend to film you in a social setting and play it back , i guarantee you 'll be shocked . 
  what am i thinking about when i approach women and talk with them ? 
  am i signaling that i want something ? 
  nothing is clear cut and no line/technique will be the holy grail . 
  i think ( and hope ) you know that . 
  i love this place because there 's so much talk about mindset , fr 's that expose a lot of the inner thinking , and although it 's important to share techniques it 's important for you to always know that the best stuff comes on the spot when you 're enjoying yourself in the flow . 
  of course the # 1 thing is to keep going out there and getting into situations . 
  through quantity comes quality . 
  practice makes better . 
  suggested playlists , more tv-like screen after the video that seems to nail suggesting the next video if you 're watching parts with a big -- huge button , and some other tweaks have really given youtube a nice polish . 
  surprisingly nothing , i mean nothing turned up on a google search . 
  so as the description says , i 'm planning to get a guitarist to lay over the same melody with an acoustic guitar , bring in the overlay after the 2 bar break and utilize the higher frequencies to give more clarity to the mix and let him rip it on the no-guitar break towards the end . 
  what do you guys think about the record so far ? 
  i had a nice program called search & replace but it 's shareware , after 6 tries it asks to register . 
  bummer . 
  i 've tried searching the internets for an automator script to do it , but i only found some scripts by automated workflows llc that are for `` viewing only '' unless purchased . 
  fffuuu . 
  so does anyone know where to get this script that appears to me at least quite simple . 
  i would think os x ships with this capability but alas :p, 
  find `` string of characters '' replace with `` this string of character '', 
  i posted asking for an automator script to handle bulk search & replace or any other way of doing this common and surprisingly not-included task and all i got was a downvote . 
  is there really no way except to buy a program for this purpose ? 
  edit : [ this was my previous post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d3hxv/anyone_have_a_find_replace_script_for_automator/ ) , mattswain123 introduced me to [ textwrangler ] ( http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ ) which does the job . 
  thanks again for an awesome and quick response !, 
  i 'm trying to figure out how to switch from one instrument to another , but i have no idea how the hell the mixer binding works . 
  sorry for the newb question but this simple yet elusive problem is driving me up the walls .

  if you do n't speak spanish , in the beginning the texts are saying that juan likes to go out and party and do cocaine . 
  his use is bothering his friends . 
  ana on the other hand likes to be at home and take tranquilizers . 
  her sister broke up with her boyfriend and is coming to see her . 
  so there 's a lot of info out there about the common cold , but i 'd like real scientists to pitch in with what research says about how the following affect recovery :, 
  - taking showers, 
  - being outside, 
  - feeling/being in the cold, 
  - drinking hot tea ( with honey and lemon ), 
  - using the computer , doing work , watching films, 
  - laying in bed doing nothing, 
  - smoking cigarettes ( ~ 5 a day ), 
  also , what could you recommend to help accelerate the body 's fight against the virus ? 
  i 'm using after effects and it seems like with all the power this program has there should be a way to select a frame and ask it to keep a certain tolerance ( to not matte small shifts due to artefacts etc. ), 
  and mask out everything that enters . 
  even friggin ' photo booth does this , albeit horribly . 
  am i deluded or does such a thing exist ? 
  ** edit : ** brentpenman got it , apparently ae supports this natively ( i 'd imagine other similar software does as well ) , it 's called a difference matte , i found [ this tutorial ] ( http://livedocs.adobe.com/en_us/aftereffects/8.0/help.html?content=ws3878526689cb91655866c1103a9d3c597-7b4b.html ) with a quick googling .

  is there any study that has figured out/shown protein becoming fat in the human body ? 
  i 'm looking to sell t-shirts with my designs and i was wondering if you guys knew any excellent ones . 
  i 'm sure we all know cafepress , you design it , custom ink , spreadshirt , zazzle and uber prints , but i have no experience with them . 
  also one thing i find strange is that * all * of them limit the print area , not allowing to utilize the entire size of the shirt . 
  not even an extra price option as far as i can tell !, 
  how come ? 
  is there a service where i get to design around the entire shirt ? 
  i 'm leaving in january/february to open an internet cafe in a couple places in tanzania among some other things . 
  problem is i 'm going in low budget and [ i noticed the uk has cheap computers ] ( http://computers.shop.ebay.co.uk/desktop-pcs-/179/i.html?lh_prefloc=2&lh_price=40..100%40c&_trkparms=65%253a12%257c66%253a2%257c39%253a1%257c72%253a3444&rt=nc&_catref=1&_dmpt=uk_computing_desktoppcs&_mprrngcbx=1&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_sop=15&_sc=1 ) . 
  instead of using my time to visit and orientate myself in a country i 've never been to , i 'm wondering if redditors could give some ideas on how i could get some computers over to tanzania . 
  i 've been thinking sending them by sea in shipping containers , as i 'd figure that 's the cheapest option although it 'll take a long time . 
  i 'll be blogging about the venture at hollowgram.net , although that site is going up beginning of next year . 
  please help me figure this out , although it 's not really in the spirit of / r/favors , i 'm naturally ready to use money to get this done , i just need solutions on how to do this . 
  routers and switchboards are a bit smaller and simpler to get , so i think i have that covered . 
  edit : ideally i 'd imagine that i 'd buy the computers via ebay and people would help pick them up and send them to tz . 
  how hard is this ? 
  i 've been living in spain for this last year and i moistened my skin after being out in the sun , this resulted in no peeling as long as i treated the skin for a few days with normal hand moisturizing cream .
