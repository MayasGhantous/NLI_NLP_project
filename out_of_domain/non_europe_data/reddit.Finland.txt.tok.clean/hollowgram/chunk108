  i 'm not heading off to tanzania which is a bit more vicious with the sun , so i 'm wondering if i should finally cave in an use sunscreen . 
  there has been a lot of talk about how nearly none of the available sunscreens do their job and some can actually increase skin cancer rates . 
  i know it 's not the same as before but we 've lived for a long time without any sunscreen and i 'm not convinced i need them to avoid issues . 
  is moisturizer enough ? 
  i 'm quite sure i have type 2 skin ( pale , burns moderately easy but tans ) . 
  this is a 1 gig file and personally i have a on/off internet connection ( recently moved to developing country ) so downloading this in one go is nearly impossible . 
  i was shocked to see there 's no combo update available , i see one but it says `` revisioner '' and that makes me weary . 
  any suggestions ? 
  won some award , talked about meta-researches , compiled research , etc. 
  really extensive . 
  ca n't find it amidst my 20k bookmarks ... :p, 
  when i plug it into my mbp it does n't show anywhere that i can think of , although i see the light blinking on the modem it does n't mount installation files . 
  how can i get the mountable partition to show ? 
  i could really use some films and documentaries if you have some you do n't care for that much . 
  i have a 3g modem that costs a fortune for 1gb , so i ca n't even watch youtube . 
  i 'm hoping once i get things established properly i 'll get a decent landline , but for now all i have is wwii documentaries and tron legacy . 
  they sell movies on streets but they 're terrible quality and usually dubbed in swahili . 
  my postal address is :, 
  one life one world, 
  box 1461, 
  many thanks in advance , but please ** do n't mail me porn **, 
  so i 'm living in tanzania and where i am there is no landline , so they gave us a fixed wireless terminal device ( model ets2077 ) and a data cable that 's basically a serial -  usb . 
  drivers only for windows on driver cd . 
  [ i found this ] ( http://www.planet-rcs.de/article/mac_serial_port/ ) but i ca n't find the serial usb cable show up in system profiler ( maybe no electricity coming from the device ? ), 
  i tried the generic pl2303 driver but no difference . 
  the user guide does n't say anything about activating the serial port connection and the phone settings menu has nothing either . 
  anyone have any ideas what i could do to make my mac connect ? 
  we would do all the design and html/css , what we 're looking for is a very competent web developer , especially well versed in php , sql and javascript . 
  we need someone who is capable of setting up secure systems , preferably using a popular cms , such as wordpress ( mostly to enable users of the website to add/edit content via e-mail or smartphone apps and access to many popular plug-ins ) that would set up systems for things like real estate , buy/sell , yellow pages/business directory , e-commerce , etc. 
  as well as be able to develop plug-ins that would enable interplay between systems ( such as hotel reservation system connected to an erp/accounting system ) . 
  ideally your skill set would exceed our demands . 
  work samples , cv and pricing examples can be sent to info@mizanitz.com, 
  i 'd want to take a detailed photo of a city , i 'm thinking if maybe there would be a script/program/service that would ask me to show the top left and bottom right portions of the desired picture , and then at that zoom level it sequentially takes snapshots of the center of the map , outputting either a whole photo by itself or pieces that i 'll stitch together in photoshop . 
  any ideas ? 
  the way i figure is the only reason we have had representatives is that it would have been too cumbersome to have everyone vote on each and every issue , but now that we have the internet , is n't it imaginable to create a verified system where each issue is votable by all citizens ? 
  remove the middle man , why not ? 
  an alternative would be to remove the party system , have causes instead ( fighting poverty , improving education , limiting corporate personhood , etc. ), 
  and have everyone represent themselves , thus having to actually work together , aligning with causes instead of party systems . 
  na\u00efve or ? 
  as you can guess that calculating size ... never disappears :p, 
  630mb , archive of old graphics work . 
  the unarchiver says, 
  `` the contents of the file `` name.zip '' can not be extracted with this program '', 
  in archive utility ( default extractor ) :, 
  unable to unarchive `` name.zip '' into `` old '' . 
  ( error 1 - operation not permitted . ), 
  i have - rw-r -- r -- rights , so do n't see any reason why . 
  unzip in terminal gives me :, 
  archive : name.zip, 
  end-of-central-directory signature not found . 
  either this file is not, 
  a zipfile , or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive . 
  in the, 
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on, 
  the last disk ( s ) of this archive . 
  archive : name.zip,

  ** edit ** fixed !, 
  use zip - ff name.zip -- out outputname.zip, 
  for example , [ this amp ] ( http://www.djsuperstore.co.uk/kam-kxd4400 ) has only two outputs . 
  how would i set up , let 's say , 6 speakers ? 
  is there some splitter that would then give me individual volume control and pan for each speaker ? 
  the quality is amazing , and i figure there 's at most two cameramen , audio i 'd assume is from a video mic . 
  anyone have an idea what cameras and lenses they might have used ? 
  my google-fu does n't yield answers . 
  i have a company that puts [ this campaign ] ( http://blog.ivman.com/wp-content/ad06.jpg ) in their portfolio and i have my doubts that they 're the original creators of the ad , my google-fu does n't give me a name , only thousands of blogs using the photo . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  so i 'm transferring a friend 's website away from weebly.com ( ugh ) to make it multilingual . 
  i 'm using wordpress with qtranslate . 
  [ the original ] ( http://www.morethanpaella.com ), 
  [ my work-area ] ( http://morethanpaella.hollowgram.net ), 
  problem is , i ca n't get the drop-down menu to work . 
  the weebly system is something outrageous , but for the life of me i ca n't figure out how i can get this thing to work , no matter how many scripts i try . 
  bascially the issue i see is that wp creates a <ul within the <li and for the life of me i ca n't figure out how to get the . children to come down when someone hovers over . page-item-11 . 
  i 've already removed the weebly . js that handles drop-down menus as the system wp uses for its menus is too different for me to start poking around the . js file . 
  any help is more than welcome . 
  i was living in tanzania where 1 gb of 3g connectivity costs close to 4 euros , so youtube etc. 
  were off limits for me ( ysk 512 kbit adsl costs over a 100 euros a month , if you 're `` lucky '' enough to live in an area with a phone line ) . 
  my business partner ended up trying to embezzle money so we gtfo . 
  what awesome videos came out or to attention this year that i should definitely check out ? 
  only reason i 'm having to keep quicktime as my default video player is because i lose the ability to preview video files before opening them . 
  google is n't giving me anything for this specific issue . 
  so i was trying to find skype 's brand guidelines ... 
  i go to [ skype media library ] ( http://about.skype.com/media-library ) based on a google search . 
  images , video , screenshots , logo , no luck . 
  my eye fell on the [ skype press room ] ( http://about.skype.com/press/ ) which promises `` official press releases , news , brand guidelines and media downloads . '', 
  nice , i must have found it !, 
  when i go there , i see no brand guidelines . 
  instead i see a link back to the media library stating that 's where i 'll `` get the brand guidelines , logo and media downloads '', 
  so i use the search , and although i get a dry , text version of the [ trademark guidelines ] ( http://search2.skype.com/search/click.cgi?rank=1&collection=skype-en&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.skype.com%2fintl%2fen%2flegal%2fterms%2ftrademark-guidelines%2f&index_url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.skype.com%2fintl%2fen%2flegal%2fterms%2ftrademark-guidelines%2f&auth=bd3xhd2es3pol%2ft2wl2q%2fa&search_referer=http%3a%2f%2fabout.skype.com%2fmedia-library%2flogos.html&query=brand%20guidelines&identifier=1321363508.9722 ) i could n't find the original , beautiful and inspiring pdf brand gudielines . 
  it 's actually easier for me to go straight to a 3rd party page via google search to find skype 's own brand guidelines . 
  fail !, 
  [ original website ] ( http://www.morethanpaella.com ), 
  [ wip multilingual conversion ] ( http://morethanpaella.hollowgram.net ), 
  so my friend and his wife arrange experiences for tourists in catalunya , spain and they wanted to make their site multilingual .
