  i used [ sitesuckr ] ( http://www.sitesucker.us/home.html ) to get the files from the site and adapted the site to work as a wp theme . 
  weebly auto-generated code is horrible , empty syntax everywhere . 
  the css files are huge . 
  everything seems to hang on by a thread and easily breaks . 
  i do n't have a lot of time to deal with this and although i 'm using wordpress ' php-generated menu , the submenu is totally broken and i 've spent hours ( my debug-fu is not the strongest , i usually build from scratch or wireframe ) trying to get it to work it still does n't work fluid . 
  compared to the original the site is all out of whack and i do n't know exactly what 's causing it . 
  i 've tried tweaking the pages but it 's crazy hard . 
  should i just redo each page from the ground up or is there something to be done ? 
  what would you do ? 
  thanks in advance and i know for sure i will never again agree to transfer an online-generated wysiwyg website again !, 
  i have the entry-level 15.4 '' mbp and it 's had [ it 's share of issues ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/h4nod/apple_is_replacing_my_threeyearold_macbook_pro/c1snpel ) , but ever since it came out of repairs for the third time , i 've been loving it . 
  the only problems left were sluggish aperture , force quitting photoshop and slight slowness here and there . 
  i finally decided to try the only thing i could reasonably do : upgrade my ram . 
  i had the standard 4 gb , but i found a [ fairly cheap ] ( http://tinyurl.com/ch4t8zo ) ( apologies for tinyurl , reddit formatting had the link skewed ) deal from crucial that made me decide to see what it could do for me . 
  holy shit . 
  the last nuances of slowness and sluggishness are out the door . 
  everything feels smooth . 
  i would n't say the computers faster per se , but it feels like it cruises through even when it 's under load . 
  anyone considering how to get more out of their mbp , i 'd recommend maxing out your ram . 
  [ crucial ] ( http://www.crucial.com/upgrade/apple-memory/macbook+pro-models.html ) has a list of compatible ram for each model , but what do i know , maybe there are better deals for ram ( finland has a relatively expensive market , i would 've ended up paying double for those ) . 
  sure , the default styling is fine but all the custom functions just obfuscate my theme and make it harder for me to style . 
  i 'm no php programmer and i find it infuriating how there 's all these functions that should be good but all i see is i do n't have as much freedom over customizing how my information is presented ( defining where each element comes because it 's pre-wrapped in some thematic function i ca n't get access to directly ) . 
  is there anything i could watch to get my head wrapped around this thematic thing or is it really just fud for normal html/css/jquery guys without much php background ? 
  before i 've always merely done the `` restore '' operation in disk utility that normally gives me a bootable partition . 
  the mistake i did was i dragged some files into the same partition and that caused it to not be bootable anymore ( i think ? 
  ) , so i erased the partition by doing the restore again . 
  now the problem is it does n't boot , i ca n't select it from startup disk and it does n't show up when i hold down alt while booting . 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
  what info could i give to help ? 
  my bro 's computer is busted and i got ta get it working . 
  so my idea is that i have a page that lists several locations in several cities . 
  <p location 1 </p, 
  <p location 2 </p, 
  <p location 1 </p, 
  <p location 2 </p, 
  when the page loads , all cities load . 
  on the side there is a list of cities ( linked ) that , when clicked , would show only that city div . 
  - all, 
  how can i accomplish this with jquery ? 
  all examples i find online are for calling content that 's hidden on load . 
  how can i do it so that all cities are listed on page load and clicking on the navigation hides all but the selected city ? 
  thanks in advance reddit !, 
  ** edit : ** i 'm not too proficient in javascript , code examples would be greatly appreciated . 
  [ here is a plugin/tutorial ] ( http://papermashup.com/jquery-show-hide-plugin/ ) that is close to what i 'm looking for . 
  the thing i do n't get is how do i get everything to show first and then hide all except the city which is clicked . 
  thanks again !, 
  would it be possible to make a good list of resources and perhaps an faq page on the sidebar for newcomers such as myself ? 
  i use jquery on and off but do n't have a good grasp on javascript , would be awesome to learn though . 
  so after new year my kit lens refuses to autofocus . 
  i tried cleaning the contacts and going through the menus to make sure it was n't a settings issue ( had a friend fiddle with the cam during the night ) , but nothing seemed to be working . 
  i tried my other lens , a 55-250mm ef-s and the autofocus worked as expected , so i 'm guessing this is an issue with the lens . 
  does reddit have any suggestions what i could do to try and make it work ? 
  any point in taking it to an authorized repair shop ? 
  he has a valid work permit and is a true professional when it comes to his profession ( it , networking , security , linux admin ) . 
  he speaks 8 ( eight ! ), 
  languages , and although he does n't speak finnish yet it 's only a matter of time . 
  [ i made him a website ] ( http://www.houssamhammoudi.com ) to help promote his visibility . 
  [ here is his cv ] ( http://www.houssamhammoudi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/houssam-hammoudi-resume-finland.pdf ) . 
  i think this has something to do with the sudden motion sensor ( sms ) , it detects movement and puts the computer to sleep to prevent damage , but it 's annoying as hell in usual use . 
  i have a non-apple hard drive , and i hear that ( especially ) laptop hdd 's have their own sms 's so apple 's built-in one might not be necessary . 
  i 'd like to keep it on if possible though , what are my options ? 
  so i thought i 'd share this with anyone considering to get a [ bookbook ] ( http://twelvesouth.com/products/bookbook_iphone/ ) cover for their iphone , as i did for a long time . 
  well , i received it today in the morning and i 've been using it for half a day . 
  it replaced [ something akin to this ] ( http://www.dealextreme.com/p/protective-pu-leather-case-for-iphone-4-black-42289 ) that broke after 3 months of use , the plastic edges broke off and ultimately did n't support the iphone at all . 
  mine was thinner than the linked one and it was quite thin and nice , the magnetic latch is a nice touch and helped support the full-open position when talking on the phone . 
  so now , i took the dive to the majestic-looking land of bookbook , hoping it 's as awesome as the video makes it out to be . 
  the bookbook is made from a nice leathery-like material and it 's clearly designed so that you put some cards into the side pockets . 
  i put my cards and they feel quite at home , but it 's tight for more than 4 cards in total . 
  cash does n't seem to be designed for this case besides a few bills . 
  no camera hole , and although the faq says `` simply pull the quick tab and slide your iphone up 1/2 inch to expose the lens , then snap a quick picture or video . '', 
  the quick tab does nothing for the phone ( no magnet or touch surface ) and even in their video the nice-looking-but-obsolete-quick-tab just pops up , needing nice placement once you slide your iphone back down ( having to readjust the flimsy leathery-feeling-fabric that 's around the iphone back into optimal positioning . 
  this is a really big drawback , as taking a photo is cumbersome and sliding it up obstructs the screen . 
  also , i ca n't just take out my iphone and double-tap the power to have a flashlight ( cydia springflash for those unfamiliar ) . 
  the top part actually easily obstructs the proximity sensor on the iphone so the screen goes black until i adjust the top to be ever-so-perfect . 
  i 'm not kidding , it feels loose and easily obstructs the normal functioning of the phone . 
  maybe i should make it shrink somehow ... 
  in my pocket it feels thick ( we 're talking 2-3x thickness compared to no case ) and because of the material it 's a bit hard to get out without making an effort . 
  ultimately , i 'm giving a lot of thought to selling this onwards . 
  good potential but unless i grow into it in a week or so i do n't see myself continuing to use this . 
  having my id , credit card , bus pass etc. 
  is also a consideration , althought it 's easy to get the phone * out * of the case if you want to play music or something . 
  putting it back in is a bit more cumbersome compared to snap-fit plastic cases , which do seem to break easier but are a fourth of the cost . 
  ** tl ; dr ** imho bookbook is n't all it 's cracked up to be . 
  might not fulfill expectations , cheaper generic cases with the same design can offer a better experience . 
  i do n't live in the usa so it 's hard for me to gauge the damage from the news reports . 
  what are we looking at ? 
  it 's hot as hell , if i leave it just to sit for ten seconds it 's still really hot , if i blow on it for ten seconds it feels cool . 
  only theory i have is that the macaroni is really bad at retaining heat so my cooler-than-boiling-water air that i breathe into it causes the heat to dissipate . 
  what 's really going on here ? 
  hey , so i have a really large bookmarks collection . 
  i 've been collecting links since 2006 . 
  exported it makes a 25 megabyte file . 
  anyways , i really like the idea of being able to bookmark from work rather than emailing myself the link to bookmark at home , which i suppose is the idea with bookmark syncing , but what i bookmark at work does n't show at home , and even my full list of bookmarks does n't show at work ( nor on my iphone ) . 
  is there something i could do to tweak this to work as it 's meant or am i totally off base ? 
  asking me to have a smaller bookmark collection does not help , 
  so i have the latest aperture with a library of a little over 70 gb . 
  i have a lot of photos and some of my best shots are missing their master file , i get the little file icon in the bottom right and i have no idea how this has happened or at what point . 
  it seems that this was a while ago because my backup library has the same issue . 
  what can i do to recover/repair the library ? 
  so i had an app ( fonecta caller ) that was for finding extended info for contacts you already have , like seeking address info via the fonecta service and linking contacts with facebook friends .
