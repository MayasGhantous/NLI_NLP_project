  we 've cracked the code . 
  thanks for this ama , it has brought to attention a lot of archetypal origins and fascinating info . 
  what do you plan to do once you graduate ? 
  gahh !, 
  these fools !, 
  imagine how much they 'd save by providing $ 4 or $ 8 for 480p/720p downloads instead of having to go through the process of dvd and bluray production . 
  environmentally * and * economically more reasonable . 
  the reason people go to theaters is for the experience primarily . 
  it 's magical when it 's a proper theater . 
  746 fonts , no manual installations . 
  verified fonts , nothing noticable . 
  the program itself opens and functions well , but when opening fonts with it and installing it can bring the entire computer to a standstill for 10 -, 
  40 seconds . 
  soon they 'll cast electric nets that cover crowds , nailing them to the ground . 
  then they blast the [ lrad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lrad ) . 
  uncle howie is quite the guy . 
  necro is some * old school * stuff , brings back memories for me . 
  entrepreneur who made it with porn and rapping , he 's built himself quite the empire and following . 
  this was the first single to his album named the same . 
  [ std ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqxipczfw4a ) came before all of that . 
  do n't fuck with it . 
  apparently there is a gap between what i mean and what you mean with the word confidence . 
   confidence | \u02c8k\u00e4nf\u0259d\u0259ns ; - f\u0259\u02ccdens |, 
   the feeling or belief that one can rely on someone or something ; firm trust : * we had every confidence in the staff | he had gained the young man 's confidence . 
   \u2022 the state of feeling certain about the truth of something : * it is not possible to say with confidence how much of the increase in sea levels is due to melting glaciers . 
   \u2022 a feeling of self-assurance arising from one 's appreciation of one 's own abilities or qualities : * she 's brimming with confidence | [ in sing . ], 
  he would walk up those steps with a confidence he did n't feel . 
  if you need objects to feel wholesome , i think you need to do some work on yourself . 
  i 'm all for expressing yourself , but she needs more practice . 
  this would have so much more if she 'd be more experienced and aware of her artform . 
  it reminds me of russian rap , very similar in many ways . 
  practice , practice , practice . 
  well in essence eukaryote cells are theorized to have evolved from the bacterial cell , seems plausible to me . 
  or what , are you a creationist ? 
  got ta love users worthy of their name , 
  dude , great story !, 
  would read again , 
   the statement `` i ought not to let others be wrong '' is not a factual statement . 
  logic , helps every time ... 
  some editors are just too careful about their mating language . 
  what exactly ? 
   this is * such * a fake passport . 
  ftfy . 
  who needs logic puzzles when you have reddit for such delightful cerebral stimulation : /, 
  even that is n't necessarily enough , they could be renting it themselves and claiming ownership . 
  having a lawyer who can check the ownership of the specific residence , copies of ownership documents and seeing his/her passport is what i demand before i put my name on a contract and start shelling out cash . 
  you 're awesome , 
  another thread to remind me i still do n't have my eos ... 
  other than that , this thread is pure win !, 
  i would 've never thought reddit had so many beautiful members of the ** human race ** to be honest . 
  this place seems more like home after this , you 're all freakin ' gorgeous !, 
  and your inner beauty and compassion shine through those eyes , i 'm not talking simply about curves . 
  happy new year !, 
  how did it come down onto its own blueprints if a column on the south side buckled ? 
   piss on big pharma . 
  ftfy . 
  i remember reading the restoration thread on that one forum . 
  simply amazing , so ahead of its time !, 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  that 's a ufo on the moon !, 
  nasa is trying to play it off !!!, 
  ! eleven, 
  he 's a professional and probably knows what he 's doing , execs are trying to cut corners and make the buck bang pronto . 
  what privacy rights ? 
  ok , ok . a composer who mashes the best into one greater-than-its-parts-orchestra-symphony . 
   this is not a nation of brainwashed muslims, 
  mm-hmm , because the us ' presence is so benevolent in the middle east ... 
  this belongs as much in psychology as fffffuuuuuuuuu comics belong in politics . 
  nothing wrong with osho or the post , but * psychology * ? 
  with the knowledge of how cold it is , how can the fact that there 's few inhabitants be a surprise ? 
  but this is not true . 
  at this point in time , 252 comments have been posted but i 'm sure a lot of people will see this . 
  perhaps not as many that see the top 5 threads or so , but hey , you ca n't have it all , 
  i 'd say be less worried about what happens with your comments and spend more time writing and making sure your input is as good as you c can make it . 
  and yes , focus on new submissions , 
  here we go ( edit note : webdesign links first reply to this ) :, 
  ** theory **, 
  ** webdesign **, 
  [ i 'm sure you 'll find this inspirational and informative .

  the way this works is that you put the image in the original post and wait for the end result . 
  ya got ta give to get , 
  [ the monkeys make trophies and give them to each other , as if it means something ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a15kgyxbx24 ) . 
  but how will popcorn ? 
  [ emma thompson ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-qf6cbjo2vy/sg736p9kuti/aaaaaaaafka/tejnljp4fz0/s400/emma_thompson.jpg ) sprung to my mind . 
  we have a wiener !, 
  [ that 's some tarantino ] ( http://medias.fluctuat.net/films/1/2/12302/boulevard-de-la-mort-grindhouse-1ere-seance/photos/53834-quentin-tarantino.jpg ) right there . 
  they seem to have an artistic department ahead of the competition . 
   there is broad acceptance of a link between brain size and intelligence . 
  that was embarrassingly surprising to me , i always thought that was disproved . 
  that 's terrible if true , where is your source ? 
  i saw this in 2008 , got scared , 2009 came and nothing seemed to happen , life went on . 
  i just do n't see this happening , personally . 
  it 's not like the world is sleeping and a few individuals are putting the pieces together and going wtf are we regulating into law , every step of the way involves hundreds if not thousands of people and such regulations would go against so many interests we 'd hear more about it than this . 
  the history of the codex group is very fascinating , if true . 
  great work , keep it up !, 
  one of the greatest arguments against our current batshit-insane policy of drug `` regulation '' : if you ca n't keep drugs out of a maximum security prison , how are you going to ever eradicate them from society ? 
  but then again , we should all know by now that the drug laws have nothing to do with `` doing the right thing '', 
  sounds delicious but i ca n't digest spoons .
