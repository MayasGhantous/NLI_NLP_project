  this helped to some extent but i started seeing weird behavior ( photos swapped randomly , birthdays appearing for contacts not selected ) so i uninstalled the app and even formatted/restored my phone just in case . 
  unfortunately this has n't helped and i keep getting a random photo for contacts i add ( not every time , but most of the time ) . 
  is there some file i could delete in iexplorer to make this go away ? 
  what can i do to restore normality to my address book ? 
  i 've been broke for ages and today i got my nice paycheck which will help pay back debts incurred and allow me to enjoy some nights out with friends . 
  the wait has been worth it .

  [ dat bottom ] ( http://photos.appleinsider.com/iphone5120808-1.jpg ), 
  putting the headphone jack on the bottom with the data connector makes so much sense , especially if they allow the screen to rotate 180 \u00b0 in portrait mode universally . 
  that sleek curved metal frame holding the thing together . 
  he believes gold has intrinsic value , that it would prevent inflation and printing endless supplies of money and would auto-regulate in some form how business is done . 
  i 've tried to convince him otherwise but i lack proper sources , and googling just gets me generic lines like `` the gold standard is not advocated by mainstream economists '' and that the gold standard worsened the great depression ( in reference to a book written about the subject ) . 
  please help me explain why returning to a gold/silver standard would not make way for economic progress and perhaps some ideas ( such as regulation ) that would help bring more equality and fairness to how we run our world . 
  thank you . 
  so i 'm building a site that functions like a slideshow . 
  slide 1 has my welcome and logo , slide 2 has an overview , slide 3 is a full-screen image , slide 4 has a background image and about text , etc. 
  some pages would require vertical scrolling , but horizontally it would snap between slides . 
  i 've found [ this content slider ] ( http://www.musca.se/full-window-width-jquery-tools-content-slider-demo/html5-css3-responsive.html ) with built-in touch support that i 've tweaked to make width 100 % , but the overflow : hidden and javascript calculated widths are really ruining my progress and forcing me down the position : absolute path . 
  there 's [ superslides ] ( http://nicinabox.github.com/superslides/ ) but that makes any image you throw at it into the background image , as it 's more for full-screen slideshows ( and fantastic at that ) . 
  ** tl ; dr ** how can i retain maximum control of the divs/my layout while making it possible to swipe between slides that are full screen and responsive to screen size ? 
  any examples ? 
  while doing [ the lying tricep extension ] ( http://vimeo.com/25983467 ) for the thousandth time ( i love this exercise ) except in the morning ( first time ) , i went into the dip/starting position waaay too relaxed . 
  i did n't tighten my upper body , i was focusing only on my hands , and this caused my sternum to slightly pop out of place . 
  hurt a bit , but i managed to finish my sets and exercise . 
  however , pain started radiating . 
  by the night i was worried , but quick googling told me i 'd either die or be fine . 
  day 3 , today i 'm going to the doctor because i have the flu ( will update if i get any other advice ) , but the sternum is healing and it looks like the only medicine is time . 
  it was n't a severe strain and i feel ok , but i wanted to remind everyone :, 
  ** focus exactly on what you 're doing when doing your set or you might have a bad time ** . 
  i 'm looking to buy something [ akin to this ] ( http://www.cowboystudio.com/product_p/newcb_bwg_triplekit.htm ) , but with shipping to finland and taxes it would be six times that price . 
  i found some place in south korea ( i think ? ), 
  that sold a similar set-up for a cheaper ( total ) price , but i can no longer find their site . 
  what would you buy ? 
  why is it that after the speech query is returned , e.g. 
  `` set a timer for 10 minutes '' , it still takes time for the command to execute ? 
  is it because * nothing * is processed on the phone , and after the query is returned , it again scoops up anything relevant ( e.g. 
  contact info ) and sends it to apple 's servers , and back again ? 
  it frustrates me sometimes that something simple can take close to a minute to run . 
  might as well do it manually !, 
  it 's not that hard . 
  apple 's software is 1.0 . 
  their solution also helps openstreetmaps , so it 's win-win but of course it will take some time to be on par . 
  perhaps google will launch an app , perhaps not . 
  you can still use it today by going to http://maps.google.com and adding it to your home screen . 
  i subscribe to apphookups and iosgaming . 
  as i was reading reddit a moment ago , i saw that [ the zombie games ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-zombie-games/id553998563?mt=8 ) was free . 
  seemed interesting and i 'm always up to try a new game , especially when it 's free . 
  so i search for it and get 2,000 + results even though the title was a suggested search query . 
  as i scroll , i see under that post that [ tiny troopers ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/app/tiny-troopers/id494242260?mt=8 ) is also free . 
  as i 'm scrolling through the results for the zombie games , i come across tiny troopers before i find what i searched for . 
  i get to [ result 51 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m5q37.jpg ) and it does n't even show what 's next . 
  i tried opening via synced tabs inchrome , no dice . 
  does n't open app store . 
  i use safari to open the link , it opens the app store and then it crashes . 
  tried again and it finally worked !, 
  so would it have been easier to install it on my mac 's itunes and sync ? 
  all in all a tedious , twisted ux . 
  apple , y u no offer list view ? 
  [ kit here ] ( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/new-1500w-studio-continuous-lighting-kit-with-background-support-3x6m-backdrop-/250932213985?pt=uk_photography_studioequipment_rl&hash=item3a6cb9b8e1#ht_7097wt_1220 ), 
  i live in finland and am looking for a continuous lighting kit for studio filming and photography . 
  i do n't want to order from the states ( otherwise i 'd pony some more cash and buy from [ cowboystudio ] ( http://www.cowboystudio.com/ ) ) as import taxes can be a bitch once the price is 200 + usd ( not even considering shipping , which can double the cost ) . 
  what 's your review on such deals , any prior experience ? 
  what would you recommend that would n't cost over $ 400 ? 
  [ link to pulse news ] ( https://www.pulse.me/ ), 
  i 've been dabbling with making a grid system to show dynamic content from a variety of sources into one view , looking into the [ css flex box model ] ( http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-grid-layout/ ) and scripts like [ masonry.js ] ( http://masonry.desandro.com/ ) , but nothing has quite seemed to fit the bill . 
  flex box seems more for interfaces rather than dynamic content and masonry seems like i could sink into its js-based limitations quite fast . 
  i want to keep things light , compatible and customizable . 
  pulse seems to really have their model together , but i 'm sure it 's a custom-built js solution . 
  what resources could you recommend , how would you go about this ? 
  refer to the sidebar on how to do that . 
  most if not all discussion threads explicitly state that you do n't need to use spoiler tags for ** this weeks episode ** or any before that .

  i 've made a simple map in illustrator i 've exported to svg and used canvg to convert it to a canvas xml file . 
  is there something ( e.g. 
  js script ) i can throw in there to make it zoomable and draggable ? 
  perhaps , even associate click events from other elements on the page ( highlighting certain layers ) ?

  so my new imac came with ml . 
  mostly i 've had no problems , but the notes app sometimes loses my newest note . 
  example : i write something , look up and suddenly the entire note has disappeared . 
  happened once or twice . 
  example # 2 : i took down meeting notes on the notes app . 
  i used other apps and then left the computer for an hour . 
  i return , remember i should forward the notes to colleagues , go to notes , am just about to press share and the flash happens and suddenly it 's gone . 
  during this time i had written a note on my iphone elsewhere , that note appeared and the other vanished . 
  what gives ? 
  apologies for wall of text, 
  so i 've been doing a three day split so far , but i feel like i want to up it a notch . 
  i 'm not sure if the spread is ideal but my idea is one major compound movement per day and try to hit each muscle group at least twice each week .
