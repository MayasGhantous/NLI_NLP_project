  hey guys and girls ,, 
  i have a friend who has had to struggle so much in the last few years , and he 's currently working his butt off every weekday to pay his student loans and to send money to his mother and sister in morocco . 
  he 's one of the most caring and brilliant guys i know ( it engineer , speaks 7 + languages , etc. ), 
  and it kills me that he 's far away across the atlantic and i ca n't personally congratulate him . 
  so my idea was to see if reddit would be interested in going to his house before he leaves to work and ( hopefully ) wake him up with a birthday song , with me joining in via facetime/skype . 
  it would make his week and would give him a big smile i 'm sure he has n't had in a while . 
  can we do this ? 
  it 's driving me crazy that i can see history , playlists , channels etc. 
  but no link to my `` liked '' videos in the navigation . 
  help ? 
  [ article from time stating from aha that ] ( http://healthland.time.com/2013/03/22/salty-truth-adults-worldwide-eating-too-much-sodium/?xid=rss-topstories&utm_source=pulsenews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=feed%3a+time%2ftopstories+%28time%3a+top+stories%29 ) `` links too much salt in the diet to a higher risk for heart disease , hypertension and stroke , and according to research presented this week at the aha 's 2013 scientific sessions , excessive salt led to nearly 2.3 million heart-related deaths worldwide in 2010 . '' . 
  this clashes with [ gary taubes ' article ] ( http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/rice/stat2/salt.html ) concerning meta-analyses that claims this is a hard issue to scientifically study and is loaded with politics . 
  what does the actual science show us ? 
  any time i try saving to evernote it says my credentials do n't work , even though i copy/pasted it and successfully used them on evernote apps . 
  no mention of it anywhere ... did they air ? 
  i 've endured a lot for aperture . 
  it made my shitty mbp screech to a halt , and so i waited to get my new imac . 
  it even destroyed my best photos so far with database corruption some time in january 2012 ( why only the 3-5 star photos ?!?!, 
  ) , but i forgave the program , saying it must have been my own stupidity somehow or the shitty mbp . 
  well , today i was importing 230 photos from a photoshoot , and it got stuck at 91 % ( importing some thumbnail ... 
  what ? ) . 
  i cancelled the import because i had already edited one photo and i wanted to bring it to photoshop to remove a blemish , and was told i ca n't do that until importing has finished . 
  so i cancel the import . 
  guess what happens ? 
  all the photos i was importing were removed from my library , and nothing remains . 
  to top it all off it 's still stuck trying to cancel the import , so i had to force quit the app . 
  i was on the fence for a long time , i have created numerous presets , was in the process of making a photo album etc. 
  but i do not trust apple with pro software anymore at all . 
  lightroom , as soon as i get paid next month for a new external hdd , here i come . 
  ok , there 's hm.com but i 'm thinking something that has several brands . 
  i have a wide and close-up shot that i want to blend together . 
  manual work and z-space camera work will do a lot , but i 'd prefer the end result of a tool for the trade could do . 
  i 've heard of gimp animate but am very unfamiliar with that . 
  both shots are on a tripod and against the same wall . 
  what are my options ( $ 0 -- re : flex $ 589 ) ? 
  so i just got the apple tv to take care of all the hard work of getting my imac to mirror in full hd to the tv . 
  now , after connecting via ethernet to remove any latencies and setting the resolution at 1920x1080 to make sure no downsampling is needed from the imac , i managed to easily get the mirroring on , but as soon as there is movement it comes out garbled and compressed to hell . 
  mirroring from iphone/ipad via wifi produces no such problems but in fact works perfectly . 
  there are no settings for airplay mirroring in display settings and i feel like i 'm at a dead end even after googling returned angry rants instead of solutions . 
  what gives ? 
  edit : solved !, 
  rebooting both imac and atv did the trick . 
  i 'm asking because before updating i went to close premiere and it crashed and i had to re-import my project to get the sequences after updating and seeing the file became corrupt . 
  i 've removed user files ( preferences , application support and cache files ) but the problem persists . 
  i ca n't find any thread with a solution . 
  any ideas ? 
  edit : i do not have a [ com.apple.audio.aggregatedevices.plist file ] ( http://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/kb/playback-stops-loops-soundbooth-premiere.html ) in / library/preferences nor in ~ / library/preferences , as some instructions say should be removed . 
  [ looking at the sneak peek on apple 's website ] ( http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/ ) makes it look like the memory is at least swappable . 
  the specs seem pretty crazy , but then again it 's way out of my price range ( i use an imac for my productions ) , but it seems at first glance a pretty mean work machine . 
  thunderbolt carries a premium but there 's [ many signs to show ] ( http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/01/with-licensing-and-cost-issues-can-thunderbolt-break-out-of-its-niche/ ) that might finally be easing , perhaps expanding via thunderbolt 2 wo n't be such a pipe dream in 2014 . 
  what are your thoughts ?
