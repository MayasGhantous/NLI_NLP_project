  hello experts and dabblers alike ,, 
  i 'm trying to modify a blog so that certain archived news items that do n't have much content do not act as a link to the post when they are listed ( title and body ) . 
  i have a tag `` archive '' that i attach , but i can also create a new category/make other changes if necessary , but what is important is modifying the listings of these posts so that they are n't links , because clicking on them to view them as a single page adds nothing to the viewers experience . 
  i 've trawled google and wordpress forums but i 'm not finding instructions for this . 
  any help is appreciated . 
  although i have edited a dozen shorts , i still feel my workflow is clunky and not optimal and that there are many features within a normal nle that i have yet to capitalize on . 
  besides spending money on a proper education , i am sure there are great resources online for all stages of editors . 
  below are a couple basic level suggestions from me :, 
  - [ learn adobe premiere cs 5 from adobe tv ] ( http://tv.adobe.com/show/learn-premiere-pro-cs5/ ), 
  - [ media college - introduction to editing ] ( http://www.mediacollege.com/video/editing/ ), 
  lived a year in barcelona in 2010 , did some road tripping with friends to the pyrenees , but now i 'll be going at this alone . 
  i 've driven long distances before ( longest so far being helsinki to lapland ) , but that was with friends . 
  i 'll be travelling with a backpack with my photography gear and a tent/sleeping bag . 
  idea would be to do this as cheaply as possible . 
  so , as a lone traveller in spain 's mediterranean coast in 2013 , what are places you recommend i stop by and what points should i keep in mind while on the road ? 
  i was reading a [ muscle recovery article ] ( http://www.uncanny.ch/2013/08/04/healing-factor-recover-like-wolverine/ ) with sources , and they pointed to a study by [ kerksick , kreider , & willoughby ( 2010 ) ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19967420 ) stating that consuming antioxidants before training is beneficial to recovery . 
  i thought antioxidants were discredited ? 
  what 's the `` consensus '' or state of affairs in regards to antioxidants consumed from outside sources and our health ? 
  if i make a podcast mixtape that has a variety of songs from many artists , not the entire song ( but 1-3 minutes of the recording ) and distribute it for free , is this legal ? 
  i was watching the bts of the music video [ trampoline ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_hwbj9cyki&list=tlhjydvrdlnre ) and noticed the led bars they 're using . 
  those are probably pretty expensive , but the technology behind them is fairly straightforward . 
  has anyone made a cheap alternative to a programmable led bar yet ? 
  [ youtube link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufwafdutyx0 ), 
  musician makes the song with loops , just intensifies as it builds . 
  a kid wo n't stop tearing up paper , so his parents take him to various doctors to make him stop , to no avail . 
  finally the parents take him to the most expensive doctor there is . 
  he examines the child , interviews the parents and sits down again with the kid . 
  the doctor says `` you know , if you stopped tearing paper , your parents would stop taking you to see doctors . '', 
  the child is shocked , he turns to his parents and says `` why did n't you tell me that in the first place ? '', 
  i somehow remember [ this tidbit from wwdc 2013 ] ( http://www.intomobile.com/2013/06/10/wwdc-2013-ios-7-brings-true-multitasking-idevices/ ) that does n't seem tobe living up to its promise for me . 
  apps that i frequently used start from the beginning ( not only loading , but going to the start screen of the app ) , even if they 're ios 7 optimized ( e.g. 
  pulse news ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm enjoying ios 7 a lot ( except for having to wait for animations to finish before registering another gesture ... ) , but i have apps like facebook messenger ( not yet optimized for ios 7 though ) that lose my login credentials ( a documented bug ) but most of all do n't seem to provide a `` true '' multitasking experience as advertised . 
  something i 'm missing ? 
  so i found [ nauticam ] ( www.nauticam.com ) via national geographic 's instagram account when they were showing their equipment , and i ca n't help but wonder if there 's a cheaper alternative to house a 550d to be able to go max ~ 10 m under water ? 
  1000 usd or so is kind of out of my budget . 
  basically i had my latest copy on icloud and a sync from pre-ios7 on my itunes ( running on an imac , has contacts app synced so this might be relevant ) . 
  i noticed that my numbers were gone , so i searched google for some info but the only good advice was to check whether the numbers were still on icloud.com . 
  they were , so i got ready to restore my phone from a backup . 
  before restoring , i tried pressing `` sync '' . 
  lo and behold , all my contacts came back . 
  ** tl ; dr ** if you have your contacts synced to your mac , plug into itunes and press sync . 
  software totally free with foreseeably lifelong updates with * cross-plaform document creation * . 
  a free os update for computers for computers * even as old as the first intel models from 2007 * . 
  the other pc manufacturers ( not to mention microsoft ) are probably feeling the heat right about now . 
  what are your thoughts on the long-term implications of this ? 
  flagged posts show 123 unread but no emails showing in the content . 
  disabling and re-enabling the account does nothing to improve the situation . 
  what can i do ? 
  i used to have thousands of mails and now they 're gone , although the database should still be on my computer . 
  edit : fixed !, 
  mailbox -  rebuild did the trick . 
  while i was watching the daily show and eating some candy i was biting down with my teeth fairly far apart and my jaw went clack !, 
  hurt for a while , tingling on the side of the incident , but no swelling . 
  what 's up with my jaw ? 
  my keyboard and mouse are wireless and give good response , but things like airplay mirroring is quite laggy and more of an afterthought via wifi . 
  what kind of technology do we need to enable real wireless displays ? 
  pulse used to be much more smooth to the eyes , one major reason i used it over its competitors is because of the soothing color palette . 
  now that they 've gone full-on white ( not even a shade of light grey ) , i 'm inclined to just delete the app . 
  what are your thoughts ? 
  single soft light flash ? 
  hello ,, 
  my friend houssam hammoudi planned to get married this may in the philippines with his fianc\u00e9 grace acojedo , who currently lives there . 
  unfortunately she was in ormoc when hurricane haiyan hit , and she had the roof of her house topple on her . 
  for the first four days she was in bad condition at a local hospital that stitched her terribly and did very little to improve her condition . 
  houssam flew out from canada to take her and her family to cebu , a city less ravaged by the hurricane , where she is currently getting better care . 
  houssam has been updating his facebook with posts about what is going on but his poor internet connection there and constantly caring for grace leaves him with little chance to coordinate anything , so i am acting as an intermediary to get the word out . 
  houssam has been interviewed in canada by several media outlets ( [ link 1 ( french ) ] ( http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2013/11/11/il-senvole-au-secours-de-sa-future-femme ) , [ link 2 ] ( http://globalnews.ca/news/958388/for-montreals-filipino-population-worry-and-uncertainty-after-deadly-typhoon/ ) , [ link 3 ( french ) ] ( http://www.lapresse.ca/videos/actualites/201311/10/46-1-philippines-la-communaute-de-montreal-sorganise.php/d1d5f0c020294fca976c21095486c34 ) , [ link 4 ] ( http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/video?clipid=1040904 ) ) . 
  houssam has spent over $ 3000 paying for her treatments . 
  we are sending him money but we are running out of money to send and soon houssam needs to return to canada to continue working and we are all greatly worried for grace , as her injuries require immediate attention . 
  grace suffers from :, 
  - critical eye trauma, 
  - face reconstruction is required because she had glass in the face which causes swelling ( plastic surgery ), 
  - broken ulna and wrist ( bone surgery with metal implant tomorrow morning ), 
  - very badly hit ribs, 
  - big infection on the leg that was not stitched correctly ( now they are putting antibiotic directly to the wound to take out the swelling and therefore restitch her correctly ) . 
  they want to avoid that the bacteria access the blood vessels . 
  she is plugged with iv . 
  - all front teeth need to be replaced ( dental reconstruction ), 
  i have created a tumblr blog to relay messages from his facebook and dropbox photos to the world and it can be found at http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com/, 
  ** edit : ** removed paypal link as requested . 
  i 'm helping my friend houssam , who travelled from canada to the philippines , by putting up his facebook statuses and other media to a tumblr page to try and raise awareness for his and his fianc\u00e9e grace 's plight to get her back to full health . 
  basically they met and fell in love with each other some time ago , but their situations in life have delayed them getting married and grace moving to canada for some time . 
  they had planned to get married in may in the philippines and get everything in motion , with venue reservations etc. 
  already done . 
  when hurricane haiyan hit , houssam had no means of contacting grace and her family . 
  he faintly heard through a terrible phone connection that something bad had happened , but he did not know how bad nor where she was . 
  after that , he was unable to get any further contact so he decided he had to travel to the philippines to find her and give her any help he could . 
  he took a leave from work and flew out as soon as he could and found her four days later in an absolutely putrid clinic where she was stitched horribly and not receiving the medical attention she needed . 
  apparently the roof of their house fell on grace and did a lot of damage to her , a lot of which went undiagnosed and untreated for four days ( not to mention horribly done stitching ) . 
  after pleading with the coast guard lieutenant in charge , he got assistance to board a boat ( as all ticket vendors claimed there were no spots to sell ) and got her to a better hospital in cebu . 
  he 's spent over $ 3000 in bills so far and they keep finding new injuries on grace that require operations . 
  this has been very stressful for houssam and grace , but also for us as his friends , as we have sent the money we have been able to send but i for one feel very powerless in what i can further do . 
  i 'm trying to reach out to the good people on reddit and networks in facebook but i do n't know if it 'll be enough . 
  any advice on getting more awareness is very much appreciated , sharing and considering even a small donation would be of great assistance . 
  developments will be posted to http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com, 
  ** tl ; dr ** friend 's fianc\u00e9e got seriously injured by hurricane haiyan , we are all running out of money to help her , what can i do to raise awareness and get them more help ? 
  grace acojedo was seriously injured during the haiyan/yolanda disaster in ormoc , philippines when the roof of her house collapsed on her . 
  she spent the first four days in horrendous conditions that have left her in bad shape . 
  houssam travelled from canada to the philippines to find her and has helped take to a better hospital in cebu , where she has begun the long process of recovery .
