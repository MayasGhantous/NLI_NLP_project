  we have been documenting her journey on a [ tumblr blog ] ( http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com/ ) as well as creating an [ imgur album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bmly9 ) that gained the attention of [ r/pics ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1qz1h6/canadian_man_travels_to_philippines_to_find_his/ ) that helped us get donations and articles published by [ buzzfeed ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-story-of-one-mans-journey-from-canada-to-the-storm-ravag ) , [ yahoo !,

  we recently [ made a video ] ( http://youtu.be/s9bb2nspzhy ) to update everyone on grace 's situation . 
  today we managed to upload a video of [ houssam finding grace ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp8zdju-_ru&feature=youtu.be ) at the clinic in ormoc . 
  there have been some facts misreported , such as the coast guard taking houssam and grace to cebu , whereas in fact they * helped * houssam and grace board a ferry that the ticket companies claimed had no remaining seats despite it being a medical emergency . 
  so here is a chance to ask houssam ( / u/desertman82 ) and me questions about what happened , where we are with things and what is to come . 
  you can help grace by sharing her story or donating even $ 1 to help with medical expenses . 
  ** edit ** here is [ some additional proof ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dozvu ) aside from my reddit history . 
  ** edit2 : ** it 's close to midnight in the philippines , so houssam is going to catch some sleep . 
  feel free to post any questions you have and he 'll chime in when he wakes up . 
  i have n't found anything with googling , but i 'd like to adjust colours by using knobs on my midi controller or ipad . 
  are there any options ?

  it 's the only computer on the network . 
  router has been turned off and on several times since this started but it has n't helped mitigate this . 
  i have logmein and remote access enabled if that helps .

  now that they 've had a president resign , they could n't possibly afford to have it again , right ? 
  so no matter how hard frank will have it in season 3 , his party will need to help him regardless . 
  fuck i ca n't believe we have to wait another year for s03 !,

  { foolishly pushed forward , did not have a strong start . }, 
  { he flanchettoed on both sides , on queenside i enforced with pawns and kingside met his white flanchetto . }, 
  { to be honest his knight reinforcement went unnoticed , but i did n't mind about the pawn and used the chance to castle . 
  we exchanged white bishops ( of course unfortunate for me , i was aware my beginning was not going well ) . 
  we also exchange knights and he castles kingside as well . }, 
   13 bg5 qe8 14 re1 nd5 15 qd3 rf5, 
  { my plan was to put pressure on the e file , stack rooks and go in somehow with all my pieces . 
  but boy will it take me a while to get my other knight in the game . }, 
  { oh damn that does n't look good }, 
   17 f4 h6, 
  { my bishop is a goner , need to move forward . 
  his rook is exposed , could give me a checkmate . 
  no way that 'll go unnoticed . }, 
  { yeah he noticed . }, 
   20 hxg5 a5, 
  { h file is open !, 
  queenside push starting ? }, 
   21 a4 rf7 22 nd2 c5, 
  { finally got the knight out ! }, 
  { well this is a pickle }, 
  { haha !, 
  i feel the tides turning , i 'm churning at his freedom and he 's getting more occupied defending , he has no clear attack }, 
  { a moment of pride from getting my rooks aligned is met with a setback . 
  it does n't matter , i can manage with the loss }, 
   29 rxe6 re7 30 rxg6 re2 + 31 kf3 qe7, 
  { i got his bishop pinned and i do n't feel his queen and rook can work together enough to avoid getting eaten }, 
  { the most beautiful fork i 've had in a live game dawns on me , but unfortunately i see it will only give me an exchange with his rook }, 
  { my king is safe for now , his king is squeezed , but my rook is exposed }, 
   37 rd6 re7, 
  { rook is safe but i have like 3 seconds left on the clock !, 
  damn !, 
  i see the most awesome next move ! }, 
  the queen is down , i repeat the queen is down }, 
  { why did n't i go straight to h1 ? }, 
   42 rd6 + rf6 0-1, 
  { * aand * i run out of time and bjant wins . 
  all in all it was a great game that i enjoyed a lot . 
  beginnings are not my strong suite but holding on and calculating without stressing that can lead to a psychological edge in my experience . 
  chess is infinite , you can make the impossible happen if you keep your head focused . 
  i bought [ synthesia ] ( http://www.synthesiagame.com/ ) to learn songs , but the ones included are pretty limited , and the ones i find for free online so far have been classical pieces . 
  where could i find good piano midi files to use to learn songs ? 
  so schoolboy q is coming to finland . 
  kendrick killed it with his first show a few years back , but i watched schoolboy q 's man of the year via itunes festival and he was skipping the last words on every line . 
  it 's a challenging song for sure but it 's not like he did n't know it when he made it . 
  it seemed like a weak set and i 'm not sure if it 'd be worth the cost . 
  so hhh , from your experience does q put on a good show that made you bounce , or does he do it for the $ $ $ and make you bounce ? 
  my heritage might be slightly confusing but i was born in russia but raised mostly in finland , lived on the west coast in the us when i was younger for a few years , also was an entrepreneur in barcelona for a year and another in tanzania . 
  english is my strongest language , but i also speak russian , finnish and swahili . 
  a little spanish too . 
  i do photography , video , music and user interface design as a profession , hobbies are too long to list . 
  i love meeting new people and aside from introducing myself to people in parks and bars , i 'd like to hang out with peeps who could help me hop from place to place on the weekend to get more out of what the city has to offer . 
  i 'm situated battery plaza until sunday ( then in brooklyn at boerum hill ) and working on seventh avenue at times square . 
  ready to travel to meet up somewhere in manhattan or other boroughs . 
  pm me if you 're interested in getting acquainted and exploring the city . 
  so salesforce requires our company to pay more ( their pricing is quite confusing ) if i want to have auto-response rules to email signups , so either we can tell everyone `` we 'll contact you soon '' or `` here is your file to download '' . 
  we 've tried using mailchimp , but it has a two-step opt-in to a newsletter , which is not what people want when they request our file . 
  we do n't get their lead info until they verify , so it 's not ideal . 
  what is a good solution to this problem ? 
  the anchors rarely come , after getting rid of the initial 6 within the first 15 moves when lucky with making squares , i maybe get 1 to 3 usually . 
  twice i 've had 11/12 and no moves left , and i 've sunk too much time into this already . 
  why did they do this ? 
  does it only get worse ? 
  ocd people , stay away from this game . 
  on a static page , i 'm trying the following code to show the content of a post that has the <!---\u00a0more\u00a0-- tag ( with no whitespace before ) . 
  this is outside of the loop , which is further up the page but basically irrelevant . 
  i 'll have four bits like this one after another . 
  $ my_postid = 284 ;, 
  $ content_post = get_post ( $ my_postid ) ;, 
  $ content = $ content_post -  post_content ;, 
  global $ more ; $ more = 0 ; the_content ( ` read more ' ) ;, 
  $ content = apply_filters ( ` the_content ' , $ content ) ;, 
  $ content = str_replace ( ' ] ]  ' , ' ] ]  ' , $ content ) ;, 
  echo $ content ;, 
  i 've been reading through all the forums and tried every suggestion but i either get a blank print out or the entire content . 
  i 'd like to still have the html formatting from the post , but only up to the <!--\u00a0more\u00a0-- portion .
