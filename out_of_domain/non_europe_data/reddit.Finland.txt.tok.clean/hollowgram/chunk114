  what are my options ? 
  [ not only is there no way to select an image if it 's inside a table cell ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9lxmp6k.png ) , trying to move an image around text will have it jump around after you let go of it . 
  this is no way for a word processor from a company like apple to behave in 2014 . 
  '09 handled both things without problems . 
  i 'm getting sick of it , and i 'm going to torture my mac by having to run word to get this job done . 
  i have an ipad mini retina and it 's never crashed when i switch to normal mode to see the content . 
  i understand the programming behind the optimal view that might actually cause instability , but i 'd like to be able to try it out . 
  is there a way to disable this message ? 
  can someone explain how this happens ? 
  or do you still need to use touch id on your phone ? 
  how does it know you 're the person authorized to make the payment ? 
  `` romance scifi '' does n't quite prepare you or your girl for worms , dead pigs and slight self-mutilation . 
  watched this yesterday and i was left perplexed by some ideas :, 
  1 ) the motivations of the sampler . 
  from the information i found on the internet , the director said that the sampler 's motivation for transmitting worms from humans to pigs is that his music is inspired by the psychic connection he is able to tune into between the pig and their human . 
  so why does he drown the piglets ? 
  how come he keeps doing this frequently enough to the point that a botanical industry blossoms and is dependent around this ? 
  2 ) the people who become infected never seek out medical attention ? 
  they always stab themselves and try to self-operate before being drawn to the sampler 's sound ? 
  i mean , all in all , i am really surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reaction this movie has got from nearly all critics and viewers alike . 
  perhaps i as a viewer am at fault ? 
  i think the movie was beautiful and in parts interesting , but i felt that there were many inconsistencies / ( dare i say ) holes in the motivations of its characters and the outcomes of their actions . 
  am i alone in thinking this way ? 
  for me ,, 
  - spotlight suggestiins and bing results do n't show even after i enabled them in settings . 
  not on ipad ( mini retina ) nor iphone ( 5s ), 
  - only been prompted once by my ipad with the possibility to answer my phone when on the same wifi, 
  - siri does n't catch or at least type out the first words i say to it, 
  - `` who is '' commands to siri does n't search the web but goes theough my contacts instead, 
  other than these , really solid release . 
  been having no issues with lag or crashing . 
  what 's your experience ? 
  [ our twitter conversation so far ] ( https://twitter.com/thehollowgram/status/524304708643471362 ), 
  i 've had my share of problems , but it seems to be time to jump ship once my billing cycle comes up again . 
  basically , i 've had downtime and other issues with them before . 
  now i 'm having days of long wait times , [ pingdom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/06q9kck.png ) shows average load times to be around 9 seconds , 8 of which are spent waiting for a server connection . 
  i ca n't use their support to even create a ticket because now they 've mandated attaching files to tickets when the issue is with site slowness ( !! ), 
  and their own uploader does n't work . 
  i went to twitter and after first claiming to have fixed an apache error and me calling them out that no , the issue still exists , they promised to send an email that never came . 
  now they want me to submit a ticket , but it 's not possible . 
  no sign of an email . 
  ** tl ; dr ** dreamhost has huge issues and horrible customer support . 
  i strongly recommend against using their service . 
  noticed this already in the alien blue , ever since ios eight was released . 
  sometimes when clicking the share button , the menu quickly fades away , other times when i press , for example , twitter , nothing happens . 
  how come tds goes on week hiatuses every now and then with no warning ? 
  this week only one new episode , with steve carrell , on wednesday . 
  so strange !, 
  any reason behind it ? 
  i 'm wondering if it 's possible to stop notifications from popping up when watching video files in full screen , e.g. 
  watching video in quicktime or vlc . 
  edit : i can manually toggle it on and off . 
  i 'm wondering if there 's an automated way of doing this . 
  i ca n't find the button anymore , it 's gone from the share sheet . 
  tested on iphone 6 and ipad mini 2 . 
  anyone else have this ? 
  so i noticed lately that although my iphone 5s ( if i remember correctly ) tracked cycling automatically in the health app , my iphone 6 does not . 
  at first i thought it was me removing the moves app , which still correctly knows when i bicycle or not , but apparently that app does n't write cycling data to the health app !, 
  argus has the same deal : even though they mark cycling , if you manually start it , they will not add that data to the health app . 
  manually starting to log the cycling seems to defeat the whole purpose of a motion coprocessor for me . 
  as far as i can tell , apple has removed any mention of automatic cycling detection from their website , forums are filled with users complaining ( [ here 's one ] ( https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6549380 ) and [ another ] ( https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6549380 ) ) . 
  i feel let down . 
  i had a feature that used to work , and although i appreciate the barometer , it 's a shame that for whatever reason , auto-logging cycling data is now off the table . 
  i 'm hoping ios 9 will bring this back . 
  i noticed that even facetime on the iphone 6 is n't optimized , tapping to reveal the top bar shows it in zoom mode ( !! ) . 
  apple , please take the time to get it right . 
  my friend is doing his doctoral thesis and the assigned professor is a real asshat : does n't do what he promises , postpones meetings , does n't show on time and gets co-author credit for articles he supervises but does next to nothing to help students create them . 
  now this supervisor has even gone so far as to write and publish an article that has the same topic as what my friend had been working on for years , using the concepts and ideas he shared with the professor as his own . 
  is my friend doomed to simply swallowing his pride and moving on , or can something be done to curb such actions by the supervisor ? 
  his status as a tenured professor seems to give him some protection against accusations and although my friend has mountains of research and notes on the topic the article was made from , he gives me the impression that it 's his word against the professor . 
  even if he ca n't prove that he straight copied his ideas , ca n't something be done to make note of his behaviour ? 
  is there any accountability ? 
  this is someone in finland btw , studying in helsinki university . 
  i 've noticed some nifty ideas , for example :, 
  - ** behance ** along with general inbox and daily stats , it lets you discover nearby user projects with geotagging ( artist community ), 
  - ** strava ** real-time information of training data ( health tracker ), 
  - ** cook with m&s ** check timers , shopping lists and recipes, 
  - ** argus ** start , pause and stop any activity , audio coach , view challenges ( health tracker ), 
  - ** trello ** create , read and comment on cards , view recently open cards , check checklists , label labels , admin board members ( gtd kanban app ), 
  - ** adobe color cc ** see color palettes that were created nearby , add to your library with a swipe or pass to iphone for further refinement, 
  - ** foursquare ** and ** yelp ** find a restaurant/bar/attraction / spot nearby from the watch, 
  every playlist i create is a local one and wo n't sync . 
  what gives ? 
  [ here is the imgur album showing the issue ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zlosv ) and [ here is the website i 'm working on that shows the problem ] ( http://pointpanic.vitaligusatinsky.com/graafinen-suunnittelu/ ) . 
  i 've never come across this before , but apparently webfonts can somehow become mangled through encoding/browser rendering to display a total mess of things . 
  whether it 's google fonts or typekit , the font itself makes no difference apparently . 
  i 've googled to find nothing except hints that maybe utf-8 is not being enforced properly . . ? 
  chrome renders the pages with no issue , but firefox , ie , safari all show either substitute fonts ( even though the webfonts contain the glyphs ) or render the umlauts in wonky ways . 
  anyone have any idea/experience with this issue ? 
  ** edit ** thank you so much for the quick help . 
  / u/roveboat helped pinpoint the problem and eli5 :, 
   this looks like a classic unicode problem - it 's possible to represent the letter ' \u00e4 ' in two different ways . 
  nfc ( normal form composed ) or nfd ( normal form decomposed ) . 
   nfc * \u00e4 * would be one glyph : [ u00e4 ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00e4/index.htm ) or latin small letter a with diaeresis . 
   nfd * \u00e4 * , however is two glyphs : [ u0061 ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0061/index.htm ) or latin small letter a and [ u0308 ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0308/index.htm ) or combining diaeresis . 
   you can use something like [ this ] ( https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter ) to see what your unicode string * actually * contains , and looking at the page you linked , it indeed looks like the issue . 
  the word * mylla\u0308ka\u0308ssa\u0308 * is decoded as \\ u006d \\ u0079 \\ u006c \\ u006c \\ u0061 \\ u0308 \\ u006b \\ u0061 \\ u0308 \\ u0073 \\ u0073 \\ u0061 \\ u0308 and you can see those pesky 0308s in there . 
  as you seem to be dealing with finnish , please remember that this will also screw up your sorting orders , string matching , string lengths etc. . unicode is * fun * , is n't it ?? 
   i 'm guessing your original text was made on an apple , as apple prefers ( and at times , forces ) one to use the nfd encoding when it encounters unicode , while other systems typically use the composed glyphs by default ( as these are in the oldschool character sets as well ) . 
  thanks , steve !,
