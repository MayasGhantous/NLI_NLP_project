  putting your photos on stock photography sites like [ istockphoto ] ( http://www.istockphoto.com ) will help you get that passive revenue . 
  so what makes you think stock sites do n't want that ? 
  let the customer decide what photos they need , your main concern is to make sure your pictures are in raw format , make sure they look as good as possible and make them as accessible as possible . 
  that script breaks the slider and does n't help the lightbox either : /, 
  i 'm wondering if maybe the slider is working just barely and is somehow obstructing the lightbox from working ... 
  [ a live version is available here if that helps ] ( http://www.sweetnessdesigned.com/test2/ ) . 
  ok , so the script should still be valid even without the @ ? 
  r/food recently had a [ great `` quick and dirty '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/ajnp9/lazy_gourmet_what_have_you_come_up_with_thats_too/ ) thread . 
  prarie dogs have a language that consists of nouns , verbs and adjectives . 
  they distinguish between a tall man wearing a blue shirt from a short man wearing green . 
  unfortunately i lack citation :(, 
  i recommend ape and the sushi master for a crash-course into his work . 
  amazing book . 
  you 're both leeching off each others insecurities . 
  why 'd you go promise something like stop smoking if you have no reason to ? 
  whatever advice you get wo n't help shit , you 're in a totally wrong mentality with life . 
  i 'm too tired to try and really pour something out , i just feel it 's important for you to consider you 're going about this the wrong way . 
  life is about being independent and enjoying others company because you * want * to , you 're in a state where you 're afraid of loss and that cheat you out of enjoying the most of everything . 
  living by these types of standards where you even have these dilemmas should be a big flashing warning sign . 
  links to his music , please . 
  the man probably busts some wicked tunes . 
  i second undercover , i bought it when i got my mbp and feel better because of it . 
  my friend had his imac stolen recently and i 'm quite sure with undercover it could have been recovered . 
  he did have rescuetime installed but those guys did n't answer his e-mails . 
  best to have a way of getting your ip info at least broadcasted , ideally screenshots and web photos , 
  yeah , apple is in real danger . 
  that would 've worked well enough with just the top two . 
  live and learn . 
  looking back at this you will see what you did wrong and hopefully avoid such patterns of behavior in the future . 
  awesome !, 
  so the guy paints himself ? 
  you 're getting there . 
  * [ citation needed ] *, 
  and yet , without posts like these we would be much worse off . 
  ya kaunt win em all , jauny . 
  i feel man-handled . 
  fcuk you . 
  well then [ this might prove to be quite a valuable resource ] ( http://chycho.blogspot.com/2010/01/language-of-mathematics-table-of.html ) if you 're interested in getting that handled . 
  i 've personally found these videos to be very helpful . 
  most people never reach this point , 
  maturity is independence , pivoting your life where you are n't needy from life imo is a great position . 
  fairness is so misunderstood too . 
  if life was fair we 'd all have to settle for what we have since hey , it 's fair , right ? 
  the unfairness in life is our greatest gift , responsibility and curse . 
  shit dude , sounds like you need perspective . 
  travel !, 
  taking antibiotics is somewhat of a choice , but churchill and flemming have nothing to do with your choices , unless you want to get all metaphysical , 
  i feel for you and i hope you find the strength to not be hung up on that , although that sucks . 
  the future literally is possibility itself , let the world surprise you !, 
  i 'm sure big auto had nothing to do with gushing every ounce of this tragedy to help markets lean towards us automakers . 
  could n't be bothered to upload onto liveleak or somewhere where it does n't start downloading immediately ? 
  perhaps it 's because i 'm on a mac ... 
  so what do you do , fitness-wise ? 
  one option is to exercise together , at least in the beginning . 
  bodyrock.tv has some awesome routines i use myself . 
  if you want good advice , you got ta give us more info on your specific situation . 
  there is no real formula for these kinds of things ... 
  as a website it 's honestly a little unpleasant to browse because of the lack of contrast between elements , unnecessary effects and a lack of clear content organization ( navigation is n't distinguished , for example ) . 
  for more thorough analysis , [ / r/webdesign ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/webdesign ) is a great community for such things . 
  websites should be primarily functional ( especially if the intent is to showcase , google `` portfolio websites '' for some great examples ) and then aesthetic . 
  functionality does n't have to come at the expense of aesthetics , but if the visual presentation is n't functional then there is a lacking in design . 
  design is working with restraints . 
  that said , this is n't a * terrible * website , but i do n't know what your focus here was because if it 's to showcase your work it 's a bit buried and also the visual noise of the background and colors distract from really immersing into the work itself . 
  should n't you have a jquery image scroller/gallery immediately upon entering if that 's the main focus ? 
  check out examples , read up on website composition and theory and i think you 'll be able to churn out work that far exceeds this . 
  shit i just moved here , let 's get acquainted !, 
  garble garble . 
  i ** loathe ** women who ca n't kiss . 
  total deal-breaker . 
  it 's not like you can teach 'em either , trust me i 've tried . 
  `` so you 're the guy that 's fucking my wife '', 
  `` yep , that 's me '', 
  `` can i watch ? '', 
  i do n't know why those come in there , i coded the site without any - moz parameters . 
  i second that neuron !, 
  the fear stems from the ancient days even before humans when aliens would come down in balloon-shaped vehicles to abduct unknowing animals for horrendous testing . 
  it 's an evolutionary trait . 
  polar bears skin is black . 
  good luck on your journey !, 
  now that 's what i call an argument !, 
  trying writing the facts down and in general processing it consciously , much more likely to get ingrained in your head . 
  the origin is a misquoted einstein . 
  how much science , or better yet the whole of humanity , could progress faster if we just talked more instead of holding onto our limited beliefs to make sense of it all . 
  that 's quite a success . 
  you 'd think a guy who split oceans in half and descended from a mountain with tablets from gid himself wouldve made a dent somewhere in his historical records . 
  absence of proof * is * proof of absence on such a major ( fictional ) character . 
  like jesus . 
  historians existed way back when . 
  people had oral traditions as well as written . 
  there is nothing to show that either person really existed , unlike , for example , mohammed or plato . 
  you ca n't be that significant and leave * nothing * behind . 
  i 'm sorry , they 're fairytales . 
  well we have no reason to doubt pharaohs did n't exist , we can debate details but there is * zero * evidence for the existence for this persons whole existence unlike , for example , mohammed or plato . 
  you ca n't be that significant and leave nothing behind . 
  i 'm sorry , moses is a fairytale . 
  well i hope it was worth it , meeting pam and all because of it ... 
  what , you never been told you look like jim from the office ? 
  * collective reddit hug to userx9 *, 
  i hope your solitary situation is of choice .
