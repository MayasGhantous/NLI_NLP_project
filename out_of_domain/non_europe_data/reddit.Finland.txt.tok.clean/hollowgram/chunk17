  arrows are there for a reason . 
  i 'm sure they will be pleased . 
  but it 's a bit of a circle-jerk . 
  more like `` meet neal katyal who i will smear as an unpatriotic scum bag who defends the people we are waging war against '', 
  how about ambient and angled lighting with no flash ? 
  maybe with a makeshift tripod ?

  macs come with [ garageband ] ( http://www.apple.com/ilife/tutorials/#garageband ) , you should give that a look . 
  i 'd really suggest [ getting logic ] ( http://www.apple.com/logicstudio/ ) and learning it , it 's * extremely * powerful and will handle all your needs , especially when you give it some nice plug-ins like sampletank . 
  does pretty much everything . 
  that said , [ here are some alternatives you can install right now ] ( http://www.pure-mac.com/audio.html ) . 
  audacity is n't * that * bad , but then again i 've never used it extensively . 
  in most eu countries private companies usually have customs w / dogs come in once or twice a week for a check . 
  or so i 've heard . 
  that 's what happens when you do n't give a damn about the outcome . 
  cold reading . 
  ever read detective stories ? 
  women want their hugh grant moments . 
  hollywood is a cheap knockoff compared to what your instincts can compel you to spark passion in a woman . 
  the question is , are you passionate about yourself ? 
  your description was a great example of walking in the middle with things . 
  shame we humans tend to live in black and white instead of shades .

   the secret of the great stories is that they have no secrets . 
  the great stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again . 
  the ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably . 
  they do n't deceive you with thrills and trick endings . 
  they do n't surprise you with the unforeseen . 
  they are as familiar as the house you live in . 
  or the smell of your lover 's skin . 
  you know how they end , yet you listen as though you do n't . 
  in the way that although you know that one day you will die , you live as though you wo n't . 
  in the great stories you know who lives , who dies , who finds love , who does n't . 
  and yet you want to know again . 
  that is their mystery and magic . 
  it 's those kinds of things they do n't tell you about life . 
  great point . 
  it 's a constant struggle to actually ask the right question/have all the variables to have the right answer .
