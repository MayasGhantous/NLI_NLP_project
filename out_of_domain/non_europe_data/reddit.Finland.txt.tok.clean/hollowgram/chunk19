  you 're probably right , a keyboard is quite a beast in surface area and much less dense with electronics , i put my keyboard in a sauna for the night after i spilled some tea on it and it worked fine ever since .

  iso exercises are useless in comparison to compound exercises .

  you 're merely overclocking the same hardware . 
  data corruption ensues , but you 're not concerned with the checksums . 
  well i figure the goal is quite clear in the context of this thread , of course isolation exercises have their place in workout regimes , apologies if i was too absolute when making my point .

  ** tl ; dr : ** salt is not nearly as harmful as it has been made out to be , as the debate has gone from `` salt is the most dangerous food additive '' to `` salt might cause a slight decrease in blood pressure if consumption is lowered '' and there are many issues within our policy-making and scientific communities that need to be addressed .

   white chocolate is a confection of sugar , cocoa butter , and milk solids . 
  the melting point of cocoa butter is high enough to keep white chocolate solid at room temperature , yet low enough to allow white chocolate to melt in the mouth . 
  in contrast to the usual dark color of cocoa , white chocolate is white in appearance , which has led to the popular belief that white chocolate does not contain cocoa .

  i guess it 's going to take soldiers banging people 's heads against the wall before they wake up to what the us government is . 
  a private corporation catering to the needs of the highest class , which happens to be hoarding all wealth to them at all costs while keeping people in order , literally hypnotized .

  what constitutes the difference between opinion and fact ? 
  discuss . 
  in finland they have these saliva tests as well . 
  they 're not admissible evidence in court and thus if you test positive on the saliva test you 're taken into custody for a blood test . 
  problem is , i know of many accounts relayed by friends where they got pulled over straight after toking and never tested positive . 
  amphetamines and cocaine is another story though , i figure it works much better for those . 
  protip : if you test positive , ask for a second test before being ripped out of whatever you were doing . 
  tough luck is , most patrols only have one tester . 
  does n't hurt to ask !, 
  i 've read articles where allegedly phillip morris and other tobacco giants have experimented with perfecting the cannabis cigarette with heavy risks to be able to release competing products in the event of legalization . 
  hell , it 's amazing it was made illegal in the first place .

  hemp vs. wood industry . 
  why did n't the american doctors association go against it ? 
  they never heard of marijuana , it was called cannabis before !, 
  and just like new york and many other fools who nearly banned water , they merely went with facts provided instead of actually finding out what this all is .

  instead of doing work .
