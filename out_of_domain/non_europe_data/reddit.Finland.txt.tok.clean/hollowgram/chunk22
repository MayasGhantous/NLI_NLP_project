  what was with that over-jump ? 
  seemed a bit staged at that point , although i know how much it 's about honor ... 
  that was really well done , i wonder if it was made totally digitally . 
  omg people do this to each other ? 
   the universe of the cyberiad is pseudo-medieval . 
  there are kingdoms , knights , princesses , and even dragons in abundance . 
  robots are usually anthropomorphic , to the point of being divided into sexes . 
  love and marriage are possible . 
  physical and mental disabilities , old age and death , particularly in case of accidents or murder , are also common , though mechanical language is used to describe them . 
  golden advice , 
  * i ai n't no drummer from reddit , but i 'll tell ya : *, 
  fuck yes . 
  askreddit is that way        , 
  hopefully this will instigate the german people to start calling for removing their troops . 
  us ' middle east campaigns are a disaster , they 've * created * the next generation of enemies for themselves with so much violence against the people of foreign countries . 
  because we have appearances to uphold !, 
  what 's a life to an immaculate record ? 
  what 's with the admiral picking/pointing his eye ? 
  was he trying to signal something ? 
  remember the guy who wanted to help his chocolate-dropping uncle ? 
  turns out he was a troll [ evidence inside ], 
  no one will ever believe you . 
  yes , this is a righteous crusade !, 
  may we abolish such insolvency toward cs ** forever !, 
  ever owned a juicer ? 
  be sure to check where the fish oil is from though , you do n't want ocean/sea fish oil , preferably the fish farmed organic type . 
  toxins accumulate in the liver of all animals and the ocean/sea is pretty fucked right now , you do n't want to be dosing yourself with that stuff . 
  funny you should put kanye as the dichotomy as he 's helped a lot of artists rise , from miri-ben ari to lupe fiasco . 
  not that he 's innocent to `` dumbing it down '' . 
  i 'd say 50 cent and his g-unit shit , lil ' wayne , rick ross and the bunch , starting with the nwa craze days who are the true pundits here . 
  i mean cribs and bloods , i.m.p. , seagram , 5th ward boyz etc. 
  threw some awesome gangster rap back in the days , but it 's a shame it spread into the mainstream in such vile ways . 
  today definitely all we see is sex , violence and mixing mastery ... but where 's the spirit ? 
  i yam who i yam , the hollow gram . 
  yeah i know those acts , some good old school right there . 
  i really liked rappin ' ron and ant diddley dog with their bad n fluenz album and pretty much everything produced by khayree ( mac dre 's first album & rompilation , young d boyz , ray luv ) . 
  do n't worry , lots of people know about this stuff , especially in finland . 
  i 've moved past most rap though , usually i listen to some tight funk or soul , as well as jazz and blues . 
  i got into a lot of this music by studying rap production and getting the sample sources , it just grew from there . 
  i 'm not that big on finnish rap myself , but from what i can say avain had a great first album ten years back with [ * punainen tiili * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oym4ha8psdy&amp;feature=related ) ( red brick ) , [ pl-2000 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzykvlctrqo ) is a classic , the pl standing for p\u00e4lti which is a name for bad bad quality hash . 
  [ jontti & shaka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb2idtlbwlk&amp;feature=related ) have been on the scene for ages , [ petos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_8gmg5rb10 ) with his city-karhun mets\u00e4st\u00e4j\u00e4 ( city bear hunter , referring to cops ) is some proper ug stuff . 
  hope that 's something , i 'm sure youtube will give you alright suggestions to go from . 
  nice . 
  anyone got a spare to help a redditor ? 
  i think results speak for themselves , i 've had the least typing errors with the new aluminum keyboards and macbook ( pro ) lineup .

  fuck hollywood , the world is making a lot of awesome movies . 
  oh , and dig deeper than imdb listings , 
  wtf that guy 's a powerhouse , wow !, 
  gossip is gossip no matter what the scale . 
  i 'd say it 'd be best for reddit to mature its understanding of human social interactions rather than facilitate fertile grounds for the hypocrisy that obviously follows . 
  what are the rules ?

  although it does n't contradict this post , i wish to remind everybody that george w. bush was born and partially raised in connecticut , not texas as is usually thought . 
  and no , i 'm actually a european . 
  go to [ tunecore ] ( http://www.tunecore.com ) and download their free pdfs , also consider putting your tracks on itunes , amazon etc. 
  through their service . 
  seinfeld has a surprisingly small pool . 
  i was half-expecting kramer to barge in and start going on about the earthquake and having jerry agree on everything . 
  yes , well , this is a message even the nra can not sponsor . 
   but as he and his co-authors write in nature : `` humans have engaged in endurance running for millions of years ... '', 
  you 'd think they 'd be a bit more , you know , * scientific * with their language . 
  i am the fireman !, 
  motherfucker !, 
  lyrical genius . 
  [ for the love of water ] ( http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=bolivia+water+documentary ), 
  next time , use / r/tipofmytongue , they 're really good at forgotten titles/names/the works . 
  your username divides by zero . 
  that does n't even begin consider fat . 
  donate a few hours of your time working for a ngo , like a homeless shelter , orphanage or something similar . 
  if you still have those feelings , which i 'm convinced you wo n't , go right ahead . 
  i feel the problem is that you lack a sense of purpose or meaning in your life . 
  do n't let me armchair psychology distract you from you growing interest in my advice . 
  go and do it , you have nothing to lose but the world to gain . 
  stupid is as stupid does :d, 
  that brought back the memories .
