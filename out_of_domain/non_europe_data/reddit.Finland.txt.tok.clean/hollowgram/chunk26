  sure you can create on a pc , but for me it seems like such a hassle . 
  i did graphics on pc , picked up everything else once i switched . 
  drivers , crashes , hacking ... not my thing . 
  this is n't ignorance , os x has core audio and other layers that allow fluent communication even between apps ( e.g. 
  rewire to route one programs synths into another ), 
  everyone 's entitled to their opinion , 
  definitely going to check out ip man . 
  have you seen ong bak 3 ? 
  also , i thought tony jaa is directing his own movies since ob2 ? 
  apparently so , i do n't know if his intention is to quit films , he 'll probably be back in a year or two .

  here is my hand . 
  * yeah , turn your head toward me *, 
  * i 'll show you what i 'd do with that hand *, 
  * i wonder if i 'll get through the rest *, 
  that 's some of the best editing i 've seen in a long time . 
  powerful . 
  yes , there is nothing wrong with the system . 
  we should be grateful for everything that is given to us and never try and point out problems . 
  with all the evidence there is ( not just this video by far ) we should merely look the other way and go to our jobs . 
  everything is fine . 
  you ca n't honestly tell me you do n't see the importance of having a properly functioning legal system in place for society to function ? 
  analyzed or lived , life is life . 
  we all have it for now , but only energy is forever . 
  stay up - 88-keys ft. kanye west, 
   * this some good pussy dog , please do n't waste it *, 
  yes , must fight the white space !, 
  how the fuck does a mac mini have fw800 , hdmi and 4 usb ports while mbp only has fw and 2 usb ports ? 
  ridiculous !, 
  well that fucking sucks . 
  any sources ( i was unable to find anything on att.com ) where i could look at the real numbers and see if this is truly the case ? 
  fucking shit sucks . 
  i want my iphone 4  hd video recording and editing is the beast i need on my phone . 
  edit :, 
   new and renewing at&t wireless customers who entered into a 1 - or 2-year service commitment prior to june 1 , 2010 , have an early termination fee ( etf ) of $ 175 less $ 5 for each full month of service commitment completed . 
   new and renewing at&t wireless customers who enter into a 1 - or 2-year service commitment on or after june 1 , 2010 , and include certain specified equipment , have an etf of $ 325 less $ 10 for each full month of service commitment completed . 
  otherwise the etf is $ 150 less $ 4 for each full month of service commitment competed . 
   an early termination fee is not charged if you cancel service within 30 days of activation . 
  so what happens if my friend would cancel before 30 days ? 
  ( s ) he 'd have to return the phone ? 
  you 're too young to be spurlock 's son . 
  elaborate !, 
  he accidentally the whole thing . 
  while in labor . 
  here 's tom with the weather . 
  well , that 's always a matter of time . 
  yuh , you can see the laptop and mic in the first shot , did my best to line it up , 
  did they now ? 
  ( real ) historians unanimously agree that moses and the events in the old testament/torah are fictional . 
  no king solomon . 
  no real jerusalem . 
  yup , playing them back to back i ca n't even tell them apart . 
  \u0298 _ \u0360\u0298, 
  do n't try re-inventing the wheel . 
  go with it , let the melodies tell you where to take them . 
  starting strength for two months , then do p90x . 
  change your diet , get rid of processed foods and eat to feel healthy and good . 
  blend fruits and make smoothies . 
  get protein powder . 
  and stop smoking !, 
  once you take a run or two and actually feel your lungs , you 'll be inspired . 
  just convince yourself you 're a non-smoker again , why would you even think about smoking ? 
  given me unjustified upvotes . 
  that was mind blowing ball control . 
  so your personal mythology is that we do n't have answers to life and that science is the key to understanding it ? 
  i 'm not sure if you quite understood what is meant by mythology . 
  it 's akin to a metaphor , and on some level you are telling your own story to yourself and others . 
  how do you view yourself and your life ? 
  i suggest watching a hero 's journey , linked above . 
  you might gain some insight . 
  yup , jung was also pivotal in campbell 's work . 
  it 's discussed in the documentary posted above . 
  great discussion on cold fusion in the comments . 
  i was excited there in the beginning , 
  i recommend checking mark ripperton 's starting strength , might be what you need . 
  yes , it would be better if we dismantled our public education system instead of bettering it . 
  so , `` dumped a woman who was in love with me for a girl who ended up getting married behind my back '', 
  one of the things that went wrong ... 
  this will be amazing . 
  ingenious , mind blowing . 
  son , one day you 'll back at this moment and say to yourself `` i really di n't know the inernests back than '', 
  as a non-american i could say the world would be a better place if americans got their shit together . 
  do n't worry about us , look at yourselves . 
  even if you 're gone , the amish shall prosper . 
  and lest we forget [ beer worm ] ( http://members.fortunecity.com/pelimaa/bworm.gif ) , its close cousin . 
  if you think there are n't any agent provocateurs in gx protests then you 're sadly mistaken . 
  who benefits from trashing property , the protesters or the status quo ? 
   wiped his ass with his hand and used sand to wash it . 
  he 's doing it wrong . 
  omg penis hide the kids !, 
  yes , these comments contain the hidden truth . 
  find the agenda through youtube comments . 
  media manipulates by default , there 's no such thing as objective reporting . 
  it 's not a crime to speak out , but definitely the interests we collectively have as a society has sculpted our system so that the encouraged course of action is to be a consumer and nothing more .
