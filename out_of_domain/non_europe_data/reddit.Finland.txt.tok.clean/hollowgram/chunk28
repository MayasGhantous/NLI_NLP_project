   and remember , the oil spill that has taken just 3 months to unfold on a single well in the gulf is expected to cost in excess of # 20 billion , meaning iter is dirt cheap . 
  is this a moran or a pr worker ? 
  that is some ridiculous spin . 
  `` honestly , i thought i lived there ! '', 
  is there a connection between plasma patterns and cave drawings ? 
  [ the squatting man ] ( http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/041231predictions-rock-art.htm ) ? 
  i do n't get it , would n't the best amputations back in the olden days be a guillotine where the blade coming down would be red-hot ? 
  instant chop-off and suturing . 
  it 's an awesome design that 's gone through a lot of testing , as they showed in the press conference only 0.55 % of people have called applecare with antenna/reception issues . 
  this antennagate is just ridiculous , the iphone 4 is awesome and i 'm getting mine as soon as they come to spain , 
  yup , better to die from whatever you have then go to a hospital and ending up with who-knows-what and suffer ten times more before death . 
  more harm has been caused by those lamenting the demise of humanity than by that which they talk about . 
  see : righteous causes . 
  life goes on , be positive , seek truth , be a beacon of light to those around you . 
  ca n't blame you for what you did . 
  i would have killed it to end its suffering . 
  and to which justice system are you referring to ? 
  i , police or whatever that movie was called . 
  zzz !, 
  [ silliest one i could find in a moments notice ] ( http://imgur.com/noav2.jpg ) . 
  `` cute '' coming from bubba_boy is heart-warming , really . 
  i have no idea wtf a straight-on is . 
  even urbandictionary could n't set the record straight-on that . 
  sure , i 've submitted to these types of threads before . 
  [ @ 6:14 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0xewi_gdc8#t=6m14s ) dj does the scripted salute , gets a tad nervous/excited and starts moving around faster , decides to get more chill by adjusting his cap and * sloowling * his movements to be ever so * cool * . 
  ca n't believe they had brotha lynch , spice 1 , above the law and others performing at this event , then again i suppose they have bills to pay . 
  and what the fuck was up with all those clown-faced rappers ?!, 
  are they all members of the icp or something ? 
  that will breed a cult . 
  you guys are missing the point : internet shows are growing not only in quantity but in quality as well . 
  he understands why you want to hate him . 
  it has been . 
  and drinking . 
  a lot . 
  lol , you just made my day :d, 
  mohammad has become a giant !, 
   to find it , now imagine you take two pencils , stick one in your eye and the other in your ear ; the amygdala is where the pencils meet, 
  1 ) which eye ? 
  2 ) aaaaaahhh !!, 
  the hollow is working on his ep . 
  [ here 's a taste ] ( http://soundcloud.com/hollow-gram/the-day-after-no-verse-2 ) . 
  this mix was lost due to a burglary at the studio , have n't re-mixed it yet , those bells in the break should be an octave lower etc. 
  [ here 's one with read vocals , i.e. 
  a real work in progress ] ( http://soundcloud.com/hollow-gram/comin-up-with-much-love-vocal-draft ) . 
  go up and say hi . 
  if you want to say something else , say it . 
  feel the moment . 
  if you crash and burn , you do . 
  but go and say hi . 
  that 's it . 
  vlc ca n't open it ? 
  strange . 
  that 's . aiff basically , standard lossless file format for the mac . 
  [ here , an . mp3 conversion ] ( http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5612065/bassline.mp3 ), 
  sure , why not :d, 
  not bombtrack tho . 
  unless you 're the black eyed peas , then it 's a new hit chorus . 
  why 'd the intro cut like that ? 
  really good vibe cut a tad too short ( or too long ) . 
  stone cold sober . 
  thanks for the help , 
  you 'd be surprised how much we operate without thought . 
  this is n't necessarily by purpose . 
  the 90 's of that page . 
  the 256 colored `` web-safe '' images , the image link map , that hideous drop shadow . 
  nope :(, 
  it does , but unfortunately no . 
  the bassline i 'm thinking of is more sine wave-ish , no grain . 
  lol . 
  nah , this track has a very straight 4/4 beat . 
  keeps it real tight . 
  nope , but thanks for reminding me that one day as a lion is out . 
  great video to boot !, 
  it just cuts all of a sudden , would be nice to let it ride for a sec . 
  it just seems to cut mid-beat . 
  must investigate . 
  wow , really awesome feedback . 
  i 'll try figuring out who the dj was at the tony hawk show in barceloneta beach in barcelona the last sunday . 
  dope tracks , i had n't heard of either before . 
  true that . 
  if only i would have had my iphone and shazam . 
  it was at a tony hawk show ( that sucked major balls , no real skating for 45 minutes after the show opened ) at barceloneta beach in barcelona . 
  could be tool though , must investigate further . 
  [ yes .

  you 're ( mostly ) a stranger ( to this man ) giving delicately calibrated advice to this man concerning his son with which i totally agree . 
  yanked one of my teeth out as a kid by having rope in between my teeth while climbing up and slipping on a ladder to get to a plank of wood that worked as a makeshift slide . 
  my idea was to keep pulling myself up after sliding down , saving me the trip down . 
  did n't hurt too much , thankfully it was one of my last milk teeth . 
  i was turning off the studio monitors one night , reaching for the power switch behind these cube monsters and something within me twitched my head straight towards the edge of the monitor , poking the sharp corner against the bone next to the side of my eye . 
  hurt like fuck , i was just standing in pain saying `` why the fuck did i do that ? '', 
  to myself . 
  nice , but it 's a shame that youtube audio quality is absolute shite . 
  holy overkill , batman !, 
  i 'm thinking kiev with these :, 
  how hard is it to get a job ? 
  especially if you 're foreign and speak languages , have talents ? 
  would the job pay enough to live happily in kiev ? 
  like , go out , eat well , etc. 
  how much are living expenses ?
