  poor-me does n't get anywhere . 
  even if it 's backed by statistics . 
  read the thread . 
  see the attempts at help . 
  feel his anger . 
  what are we , responsible for others ? 
  mm , but given our tries and his responses have been close-minded , like he does n't even try to understand . 
  [ i think this comment encapsulates it quite well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cviw5/asian_guys_do_you_find_it_harder_than_white_guys/c0vl5yg ) . 
  i 'm not saying we should turn his backs , in fact it looks like he did since he stopped responding to the thread . 
  i put in time and posted quite a long comment to try and get him to see a little of what a lot of the advice was trying to say ( imo ) , and alas nothing . 
  life goes on , all the best to everyone !, 
  live it to the max , destroy the boundaries you find for the sake of breaking them !, 
  yup , i know a girl who let me look at their hate database . 
  top 10 was just asians , go figure ... 
  in all seriousness though , the world is not cut and dry . 
  the difference between men and women is n't that large , although the way things are set up we grow into our roles . 
  we both put up with each others crazy , we both run the opposite way when we see it . 
  you know as well as i do if you give it thought that in life few things are set in stone and your approach to situations defines their outcomes . 
  a split-second action ( e.g. 
  giving the finger instead of offering your hand to shake ) can make the world of a difference . 
  reactions to actions can have the same effect ( e.g. 
  laughing instead of being sincere at a sad story ) . 
  if you 're not excited about yourself , passionate about your life and developing it , not dealing with your hang-ups and putting in the hard work to become a centered , powerful individual then of course things look out of reach and the advice/stories seem outlandish . 
  theory, 
  to me , the guy is doing his thing in the beginning , but after christina takes over he gets stuck on his train of thought and because of the female anchors talk about her figure/form he tries to disarm himself in front of her `` i do n't want to come off like i 'm hitting on you , but ... '' but guy brings back the conversational thread in a manner that 's totally not smooth because he draws back everyones minds without a proper hook , and it 's as if you can feel the cold descend onto the situation as he realizes he 's not getting there . 
  he 's quite alert and frozen in his posture while the others are talking , giving full attention towards the interviewee . 
  christina hendricks classily `` negs '' him and they get the pacing back on track and wrap up . 
  what are your thoughts ? 
  [ i pity the fool who know not dub fx ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whbor_tgxci ) . 
  reggie is awesome too .

  i also have photoshop , indesign , illustrator , webdesign/ui , brand/logo , inpsiration , typography and resources bookmark folders , 
  awesome work , keep going out and getting yourself into situations !, 
  for a first night out that 's a great fr !, 
  sounds like the last situation would require some experience and knowledge on how to * really * push her buttons to magnetize her towards you . 
  sounded like a slightly tough situation . 
  remember though , you have nothing to lose , better to overdo sexual innuendo than leave empty handed . 
  it 's educational . 
  keep going out and working on your stuff , main thing is to create many memories of just being in the middle of crowds in bars/clubs and being totally happy with yourself , as you are , where you are . 
  pm me your e-mail , i do n't want to line-break them all , plus you 'll get the headers instead of just the link . 
  kant made significant contributions to ethics and science . 
  what is this bs about bashing him ? 
  read his stuff and not third-hand comments . 
  for example : bike to the store , stroll indoors . 
  and your username to those who know there are only omelets . 
  [ i really liked this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvzyxqg9n1c&amp;feature=related ) . 
  that man is a legend . 
  personally i favor the old macking al green to the later reverend al green . 
  perverts guide to the cinema had this scene . 
  lynch is a genius , shame he got trapped in all that tm crap . 
  that was some awesome editing . 
  something makes me think jackie chan would n't approve . 
  that was hardcore . 
  i ca n't imagine how much time that took . 
  through quantity comes quality . 
  keep producing . 
  illuminati exposed : music video with esoteric symbolism . 
  alien dna found in human genome !, 
  outdoor air is more poisonous than tap water !, 
  yup , be straight forward . 
  hiding intentions and thoughts in fear of hurting his feelings will backfire and is a weak mindframe . 
  be a man , talk things through with him . 
  even if you argue you 'll settle things later with a greater understanding . 
  thanks for sharing , that sounded like a trip of a lifetime , 
  not only that , cs has a great community in many countries . 
  here in barcelona it 's really hard to find a couch to surf on , impossible if you do n't put effort and personalize each message , but on top of that there are many weekly meetings and someone 's organizing or letting you know what 's happening in town . 
  cheap venues , restaurant specials , etc. 
  not to mention nearly every major city has its own [ wiki ] ( http://wiki.couchsurfing.org/en ) , providing a lot of insider info . 
  plus it 's just wicked meeting up with locals and seeing the real deal of the country you 're in . 
  mirror for the second body talk video ? 
  that server does n't work for me , download fails halfway . 
  funky and cute but that flow has nothing on the best . 
  here 's my contenders :, 
  [ brotha lynch hung - rest in piss ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rw-qyh_drm ) . 
  [ rappin ' ron & ant diddley dog - you ai n't heard shit yet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdocrdjhhpa ) . 
  i think you mean baastan . 
  now that 's a photograph !, 
  that 's why i 'm here , news with views !, 
  stoned and tripping balls . 
  yes , she probably does not like you . 
  am i spelling this out enough ? 
  how about washing the razor in pure alcohol after the fact ? 
  it 's water that causes the rusting and dullness . 
  yes . 
  do n't worry too much about that , understand that she wants to be with you and express herself but lacks the experiences to have confidence to do so . 
  who knows what kind her previous boyfriends were like , the common stock of men is quite poor unfortunately , but that 's an advantage to us high quality catches . 
  come from a perspective of understanding ( i.e. 
  really listening ) and be her guide through this unexperienced part of her existence . 
  praise her and * want * her . 
  you 'll do great , do n't sweat it . 
  c'mon guys , he broke his back for that career . 
  twice !, 
  modern animation stories carry deep truths , they 're worth re-watching . 
  the storytelling is par excellence . 
  up , nightmare before christmas ... 
  good of you to put in there that you were looking for an agent . 
  ask and thou shall receive !, 
  this needs exposure , i think / r/worldnews or / r/politics would be more appropriate though . 
  thanks for helping bring another atrocity to light !, 
  funny , mine are :,
