  the truth is the system is built around money that does n't have inherit value , a system where everyone lives in debt , a system where banksters live above the law . 
  as valentijn said , do n't get scared , get mad . 
  read about this , research it , do n't take anyones word for anything . 
  make up your own damn mind , 
  great skit , 
  i doubt that was the focus or point of the video ... did you even watch it or are you just a stooge/troll ? 
  whoa , you got it !, 
  [ i found this simple tutorial for it ] ( http://livedocs.adobe.com/en_us/aftereffects/8.0/help.html?content=ws3878526689cb91655866c1103a9d3c597-7b4b.html ) , thanks again for nailing it !, 
  brentpenman got it , apparently i was looking for the difference matte , 
  thanks !, 
  lol , love how the camera operator panned the camera before ( i assume ) they went running for cover . 
  that 's professionalism right there . 
  i figure i have influenza because i have feverish symptoms as well as a runny nose . 
  diminish your carbs , get your energy from protein and fat . 
  main thing is burning more than you ingest , so exercise and do n't eat as much . 
  [ i 'm sure you 've heard of mr. twinkie diet ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2010/health/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html ) by now ... 
  cute , and very real . 
  thanks for sharing , 
  got ta love network caches . 
  holy shit , and to believe i partially believed this crap when i came across it ages ago . 
  i recommend picking up [ drawing on the right side of the brain ] ( http://www.drawright.com/ ) , it 's a real eye-opener . 
  it seems that you 're painting what you * think * should be there ( eye , mouth , hair , etc. ), 
  instead of what 's * really * there ( shades of light , different textures ) . 
  it 'll blow your skills to a whole nother level , even if a `` distinct '' look is what you 're going for . 
  keep at it , through quantity comes quality . 
  til ... 
  you do n't need a conspiracy to see that power is conglomerated and that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer . 
  i 'm sorry if my writings make you think i lean towards the conspiracy mindset , i do n't . 
  i believe when one looks at the facts and figures , the pieces make a strong argument by themselves : we need to change the way we do things . 
  lol . 
  let 's not pretend there 's only one form of fat and carbohydrates . 
  for a crash course into seeing why fat ** does n't ** clog your arteries and why carbohydrates are a bad source of energy i 'd recommend watching [ this brilliant lecture ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbnniua6-om ) by robert h. lustig , md , ucsf professor of pediatrics in the division of endocrinology . 
  but you 're right , in the end it 's about burning more than you ingest . 
  so , not for mac i take it :p, 
  that 's like saying that not being allowed in a certain establishment is imprisonment . 
  banning is a specific word used in a specific context , you need to go with the definition instead of making the definition you seem fitting for the occasion . 
   ban : an official prohibition or edict against something, 
   banned - forbidden by law, 
  i 'd imagine it 's partially because gaga is actually a very talented musician/performer who comes off cheap because of her pop orientation . 
  i have no idea what the fuck you 're trying to demonstrate . 
  thank you !, 
  [ it 's not just what you hear ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3r3kqrjai4 ) , it 's what she 's capable of :, 
   she learned to play piano from the age of four , went on to write her first piano ballad at 13 and began performing at open mike nights by age 14 . 
  [ 11 ] at the age of 11 , gaga attended convent of the sacred heart , a private roman catholic school on manhattan 's upper east side , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] but has stressed that she does not come from a wealthy background , saying that her parents `` both came from lower-class families , so we 've worked for everything -- my mother worked eight to eight out of the house , in telecommunications , and so did my father . 
  '' [ 14 ] an avid thespian in high school musicals , gaga portrayed lead roles as adelaide in guys and dolls and philia in a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . 
  [ 15 ] she described her academic life in high school as `` very dedicated , very studious , very disciplined '' but also `` a bit insecure '' as she told in an interview , `` i used to get made fun of for being either too provocative or too eccentric , so i started to tone it down . 
  i did n't fit in , and i felt like a freak . 
  '' [ 16 ] [ 17 ] acquaintances dispute that she did not fit in school . 
  `` she had a core group of friends ; she was a good student . 
  she liked boys a lot , but singing was no . 
  1 , '' recalled a former high school classmate . 
  [ 18 ] referring to her `` expressive , free spirit '' , gaga told elle magazine `` i 'm left-handed !, 
   at age 17 , gaga gained early admission to the new york university 's tisch school of the arts and lived in a nyu dorm on 11th street . 
  there she studied music and improved her songwriting skills by composing essays and analytical papers focusing on topics such as art , religion , social issues and politics . 
  [ 11 ] [ 20 ] gaga felt that she was more creative than some of her classmates . 
  `` once you learn how to think about art , you can teach yourself , '' she said . 
  by the second semester of her sophomore year , she withdrew from the school to focus on her musical career . 
  [ 21 ] her father agreed to pay her rent for a year , on the condition that she re-enroll for tisch if she was unsuccessful . 
  `` i left my entire family , got the cheapest apartment i could find , and ate shit until somebody would listen , '' she said . 
  ** tl ; dr ** everything gaga is doing is because * she * wants to do it * exactly * like that . 
  we can disagree with her tastes and direction , but it 's foolish to say she does n't have talent . 
  you do know words have meanings and for good reason , right ? 
  to call someone untalented is to say they do n't know what the fuck they 're doing . 
  this is not the case with gaga . 
  that 's all . 
  i do n't listen to her music , but i think she 's a talented individual and i 'm happy she 's successful doing her thing . 
  i rap , so i need to memorize a lot of words . 
  i dunno if you can apply this to your singing , but the way i work is first i flesh out the lyrics , then i record it while reading the lyrics , so the flow etc. 
  is quite bad but the words are there . 
  i then listen to the recording and the instrumental over and over again , reciting and making adjustments to the lyrics and re-doing the take a couple times . 
  once i 've listened to the track and recited it enough times i go off to my friends studio to do the final record . 
  hope that helps . 
  thanks for a thorough response !, 
  notice that link next to the comment box called formatting help ? 
  might want to click that . 
  invite her over for coffee , say it 's good for neighbors to know each other . 
  talk casual , see where it goes . 
  make her open up about her life . 
  act mature . 
  by moving on . 
  strangest thing a passenger has ever done ? 
  most dangerous situation ? 
  weirdest overheard conversation ? 
  i hope you realized your photo is over-exposed to the point it takes away from the experience , for example parts of the opposite wall are missing that takes a significant portion of the photo . 
  tricky shot with a single exposure , you 're inside but you 're capturing a lot of the outside . 
  using your analogy , all these programs are great saws , they just have different grips . 
  learn one , do n't try to master all of them . 
  i use logic . 
  so i have a domain called lorem.com , but i 've installed the wordpress in ipsum.net/wordpress . 
  lorem.com/music works as well as ipsum.net/wordpress/music , and i want the links in wordpress to reflect lorem.com instead of ipsum.net/wordpress . 
  but i ca n't upload anything to the . com address , i 'm merely able to redirect using that address . 
  dunno if that makes sense . 
  the . com was registered elsewhere , wordpress installation is on my server . 
  the domain was registered to a friend , i have my own domain , i created a subdomain on my domain and pointed the nameservers at the subdomain directory . 
  however , on my ftp , it 's my domain and her subdomain in it to which the domain is pointed toward . 
  there is no root directory per se , and i 'm trying to find out how to make wordpress point towards itself ( or visually at least the links ) as the domain name instead of my domain plus subdirectory . 
  i hope that 's not too confusing ... :p, 
  server type : debian, 
  i 'd imagine it 's apache . 
  how can i find out if it 's dedicated or shared ?
