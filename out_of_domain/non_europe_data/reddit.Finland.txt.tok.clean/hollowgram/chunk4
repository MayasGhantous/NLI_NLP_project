  i guess he was pioneering sober rationality behind the scenes already back in his mtv days ( did n't watch so i ca n't say what he was like on camera ) . 
  heh , been too long since i lastheard that , 
  did n't take long for the internet to get back on track , 
  ask on a forum , hell you might get some volunteers here . . everyone wants if nothing else an alt . 
  mix to reference to . 
  be sure to get many bands , no two recordings are alike , not even mentioning the variety of `` studio '' and studio environments . 
  their regular trademark !, 
  this is messy , but bear with me :, 
  ** theory : **, 
  ** photoshop : **, 
  ** vector/illustrator : **, 
  that was thorough . 
  you did n't leave a single rock unturned , congrats !, 
  my first gen has a boatload of scratches on it , i awoke one morning with a massive headache and a slight crack in the glass next to the button . 
  then another time more recently it fell onto concrete and cracked the glass some more , this time through the screen . 
  still works like a charm , 
  know a fuck ton ? 
  what happened there ? 
  tl ; dr : he kept being active online with a new name , lots of people used their time to track him down , got caught very casually in the end . 
  best bet is to film every encounter , makes sure things like throwing laptops on the ground less likely to occur and also gives you a chance at getting reimbursed . 
  awesome pictures ( interesting this is n't in the science subreddit ) . 
  i was wiping tears after laughing so hard over this comment :, 
   its very shocking to see that this collider is being set up again !!, 
  last year when it was , it was and caused lots of news bc cern said that it could end civilization and create a black hole . 
  i am shocked that the world is approving this and seems so careless this time around . 
  no one has said anything this time of the harmful effects that this can cause . 
  everyone needs to know and everyone should have a vote on if cern should be operating such a destructive machine that can easily destroy the world !!!!, 
  please do something about this !!!, 
  please call cern , do something before something catastrophic happens !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  wtf is up with that high-pitch sound ? 
  that 's special . 
  if you 've never heard that quote before then i suggest reading more and submitting less ( at least to bestof , [ til ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned ) might be more your making ), 
  whoa , he just raped every color in the rainbow !, 
  think of failiure . 
  think of the cigarette . 
  think of death . 
  think of the cigarette . 
  think of suffering . 
  think of the cigarette . 
  think of failiure . 
  think of the cigarette . 
  when you place that cigarette on your lips , you are doing yourself a disservice . 
  you are actively ruining your health . 
  view this as absolutely as possible , accept no slips . 
  just stop . 
  whenever you get the idea in your head , remember those associations . 
  do n't make your future less awesome by being the sponge for toxins . 
  be sure to exercise , that 'll make you feel the benefits of recovering lungs and health . 
  someone shoot that cunt with a bazooka !, 
  that sounds terrible !, 
  uhh , you have n't seen r 'n' b/hip hop culture in the last 10 years ? 
  i was half-expecting them to juggle balls on their boobs by the tone of the title :d, 
  now what would be wicked would be to see an x-ray version of that belly dancing . 
  for a while i was afraid you were bullshitting and it 'd be that [ humble oil ] ( http://www.grist.org/i/assets/2/humble-oil.jpg ) ad from a few days ago . 
  but alas , great find , 
  this hits pretty close to what i think the op is going for when it comes down to actually doing something to become `` that guy '' . 
  want to be seen as interesting ? 
  become interesting . 
  learn to know people , touch their buttons . 
  it 's nothing overt , it 's the art of subtlety fused with a charismatic sense of self . 
  it 'd be even worse if the memories are generic yet you could n't shake the raw emotions and thoughts that stem from them : /, 
  i made it through the whole video . 
  now i have a hole in my head . 
  bathing ape . 
  get him to the gym , even if it 's only to sit down and watch . 
  keep doing this , keep pushing him . 
  once that barrier is broken it 'll be much easier to get him on a treadmill/bicycle , the vibe of the gym and you not demanding anything except some quality 1-on-1 time will do a lot of the work . 
  so it 's best to make the gym more than just a place of working out . 
  make it a place to talk over some protein shakes or even watching tv there . 
  anything to get him to positively associate with the gym . 
  then work your way from there , always keeping his sensitivities in mind but after a while the threshold will grow until you 're cheering him with shouts to finish that last rep. 
  no way i could choose a winner , my eyes kept going from one to the other with more and more awe . 
  sometimes it 's a wonder to be alive . 
  that 's exactly the opposite conditioning you want for him to have . 
  perhaps gym is too much , perhaps going to a sport event or just going for a walk with him is a better idea to start things off . 
  you should proceed in the sense that you want to deepen your relationship with him , make him understand that you 're trying to illicit the archetypal `` father passing knowledge to son to get ready for the world '' kind of thing ( how old are you btw ? 
  ) , or whatever it is to get him to feel good about the whole thing . 
  if it 's this conflict-laden then you wo n't get anything no matter how much you insist or wait it out . 
  read some basic psychology and persuasion articles to get a hang of how to approach this issue . 
  to me it seems clear that he has a resigned attitude towards at least a part of his life , which of course is always sad . 
  seek to understand him but keep up the appearance of him being the stronger guy teaching you the ropes ( or whatever ) . 
  be ready once you 've established a closer bond with him that he might open up to you big time , but that 's a tragiawesome thing hopefully you 'll get to . 
  right now it just seems that your relationship in regards to this issue at least is clobbered in obstacles . 
  find a way to make them go away and to strengthen your general bond with your dad if you 're that concerned . 
  doing it wrong will only avert him further . 
  but down the road , as much as i hate to say it , you got ta learn to let go deep down so that you can enjoy every moment you have rather than trying to make it into something else . 
  all things pass . 
  definately not worth it . 
  i ca n't imagine what it 'd be like trying to have a conversation with these people ; either you 'd manage to illicit some critical thinking into them or then you 'd just become one of them . 
  or you might just have a sudden seizure , i really do wonder ... 
  `` oh i went through that phase between years 1 and 5 . 
  during year 6 i started to overcome my own insanity and started recollecting things . 
  by year 8 i remembered every single thing that had ever happened to me . 
  by year 11 i figured out the complex relations people have between being honest and open and fending for themselves . 
  by year 15 i understood the conditioning i went through as a child so thoroughly i felt i had the answer on how to rectify our errors in upbringing . 
  by year 20 i ascended to a higher plane where i found a deep understanding for why the world is the way it is and saw the essence of our condition . 
  it was perfect . 
  when i came through in year 23 the sensation of being able to communicate with the outside world became far greater than any wisdom i attained and so do n't have much interest in pursuing that anymore . 
  bring me the beer ! '', 
  i hope you never become head of product development .
