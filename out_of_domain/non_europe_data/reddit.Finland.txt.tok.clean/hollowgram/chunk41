  i explained that i needed the computer to work at 100 % as i was now starting to produce multimedia instead of just graphics and web development , that please make sure it works . 
  a week later i got my computer back and they said it works perfectly , the memory was corrupt . 
  i wondered how they had missed it the first time , he apologized , but i was happy at the premise of a working computer and went off . 
  coming back home the computer worked the same . 
  i had noticed they had n't formatted the hard drive , so i wondered perhaps my hard drive was the issue . 
  due to the recession in europe and my primitive spanish skills , i pursued another business venture in tanzania . 
  there i bought a new hard drive from a respectable dealership , and although now i could copy several big files simultaneously and do other things , not only would os x not install from a hdd image as it used to ( saved bringing fragile dvd 's ) , the system would totally freeze after only a few minutes of use , totally randomly , and would n't recover . 
  i brought the hard drive back for analysis , they said it was fine . 
  i have since returned to my stalling hard drive for at least some ability to do work , but there is no official apple dealership on the entire continent and i am at my wits end with the computer and the service available . 
  try finding an email for mac hardware issues from their website , they only offer calling them , which is not cheap . 
  now i am merely saving up to buy another computer , as my late imac worked perfectly , and i feel this is a monday computer that has come into my life to teach me patience and perseverance . 
  i know my situation is unique but i never felt much compassion or real help from apple 's side . 
  actually from his dre dog days , from the album hate you with a passion . 
  the thing , mouth of madness , prince of darkness, 
  oddly enough all made by john carpenter . 
  whoa , amazing !, 
  please underscore the price if you can as i will have to pay taxes regardless if they are a gift or not . 
  would upvote again , 
  sure , as long as it 's not an arm and a leg , 
  but usually when someone is infected with malaria they get several strains , if i remember correctly there are around 40 types of malaria in the world , when you get seven or more it 's very serious . 
  i live in tanzania and was infected with seven strains , had artemisia-based medication and it went away . 
  definitely would n't want to live with malaria , waiting for that gsk vaccine that 's supposedly coming out this year . 
  you guys are welcome to come visit tanzania !, 
  are those numbers reps or sets ? 
  any back problems with the sldl 's ? 
  are you able to keep your back straight during the whole routine ? 
  born in russia , raised in finland attending english school . 
  living in tanzania . 
  so , in order of skill , i 'd say english , finnish , russian , swahili . 
  anyone find the link to `` download the analysis '' ? 
  learn more page says it should have it but no link !, 
  what would you say was your most important decision/turning point in your life concerning your career ? 
  [ direct link to article ] ( http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-real-web-design-application/ ), 
  umm , in finland , which was the first country to declare internet access as a human right , you still need to pay for your connection . 
  the human right part is that no one should be denied access even if their credit rating etc. 
  is fucked . 
  but people here get 40 meg connection for 24 euros . 
  well in finland actually they 'll give you a city house and pay the bills , so not quite the same , but with the financial support you get from the gov ' t it 'd be well affordable to add a cheap broadband as well , probably even able to get a computer on a monthly plan . 
  ott - queen of all everything, 
  please elaborate , how would i use the co-ordinates to map a big area ? 
  i 'll believe it when someone successfully argues that in court . 
  that 's the trailer , watch the show . 
  from the get-go it 's gold . 
  shit we had an ipod nano 2nd gen that was out the whole winter on the driveway , each day getting run over at least a dozen times . 
  we found it once the snow melted in spring , plugged it in and it still was recognized as a flash memory , so i really doubt it 'd be the memory that fails :d, 
  some of the time , it 's funny all the time . 
  could you give us your most memorable examples for both ? 
  shadiest illegal thing , shadiest immoral thing ? 
  one of them being that it 's a joke , 
  no multi-part , that was the folder the zip was created in .

  iirc , this was supposed to be the lead single to his sophomore album but after the album leaked and he had his accident he went with through the wire . 
  ca n't believe i had to close nine comment trees to get to this link !, 
  how the hell do they manage logistics when things change in an instant ( got ta go to location x to meet mr. y instead of location z with mr. x ) , in tense environments suddenly a four team crew shows up . 
  damn bbc , you manage !, 
  a print company operating in several countries , www.rapidprint.info ( redirects to another url , lol ) . 
  umm , upgrade to ios 5 and you 'll get location-based reminders . 
  download the garmin or tomtom app ? 
  parties , especially clubs , are like an alternate reality , you can get away with murder . 
  have fun , be experimental . 
  lots of good advice here , and the best thing is you can easily move from set to set as you try new angles . 
  only way to become good at something is to do it . 
  there 's no substitute in music for the instrument , i 'd recommend getting any cheap midi controller for like 30 bucks , attaching it to your computer and using ableton , reason or some other synth/daw program as your sound bank . 
  if you own a mac , garageband comes with piano and guitar lessons that many have said are helpful . 
  just out of curiosity , what type of deal do you usually make if it is n't cold hard cash ? 
  [ lol ] ( http://www.lightbikes.nl/scalpel/hollowgram.jpg ), 
  a multitude of reasons , such as remote control with iphone , better volume control , fixing broken avi indexes , more versatile subtitle support , i mean the list goes on . 
  shame it seems to be too tricky to take away the default privilege from quicktime ... 
  problem is i want to move from qt to vlc , it 's not about the codecs . 
  i 'm trying to fid a way to preserve quick look capability while having vlc as the default video app . 
  i recommend the [ blue yeti ] ( http://www.bluemic.com/yeti/ ) . 
  you can get a good price on ebay and those things are amazing quality-wise , durable as hell and sound amazing . 
  that 's why this is * r/askscience * , no ?

  switched in 2008 to an imac from pc , had looked into apple a while before , convinced my friend to get the first intel imac that was released . 
  never looked back, 
  ok , my apologies  post deleted . 
  you get what you pay for . 
  my php developer friend tipped me to dreamhost and afterwards i never looked back . 
  around 100 usd per year , true unlimited hosting and bandwidth , amazing support and fast servers . 
  i 'd say with my eyesight i get sd , with glasses it becomes hd . 
  fuck it , it 's 3d , 
  my first year was around 7 usd but nowadays i pay around a 100 . 
  read their faq on the subject , they do not have caps on bandwidth or storage as long as its not storing personal files inaccessible through your site . 
  this is not as good as pure lipsum because it can distract you as a designer from the actual layout of the text , which is at least for me the main utility of lipsum , to be able to see the shape and form of the text design without being distracted by the content of the text . 
  up and down, 
  but in the end, 
  it 's round and round,

   for an impact , i listed exactly what you just said .
