   [ `` fidelity management and research is the top stock holder , the top investment firm that is selling the bonds as investment securities . 
  they pool them and sell them as mortgage backed securities . 
  also when they pool them , they sell them as mutual funds on the stock market . 
  by `` pooling '' we mean the securities on the inmates . 
  '' ] ( http://www.wariscrime.com/2008/11/07/news/how-illuminati-are-trading-prisoners-like-cattle/ ), 
  many private prison corporations trade on the public stock market and they derive their value partially by the amount of inmates they contain , they are marked as a part of the company 's stock .

  i 'm thinking op meant industry with the word trade , as in the * america re-invented the slave industry * .

  i 'm surprised no one has mentioned [ social navigation ] ( http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/social_navigation ) yet . 
  this is the theory that people look to others for cues on how to choose . 
  example : if you are hungry and pass by two restaurants next to each other , one empty and one with people who seem to be enjoying themselves , you 're most likely going to enter the one with people in it .

  thanks , the code looks appropriate , but could you elaborate how do i link to city id 's to call the function ? 
  thanks for the thorough code , but the < li  are not selectable , should they have < a  tags ? 
  thanks again for the help !, 
  looking at that list makes me feel all kinds of funny . 
  welcome to the 21st century . 
  as a first language . 
  perhaps add a link to this thread ? 
  this has a nice list of resources and i dunno if they would all conveniently fit into the sidebar . 
  thanks for the update though , i sure have a lot of reading ahead of me , 
  [ here is the website ] ( http://tsemppari.hollowgram.net/tsempparit/ ) , unfortunately the < li  's are n't causing any actions . 
  jquery is on , code is as suggested . 
  any help would be greatly appreciated !, 
  i wish it worked . 
  honestly , i tried this once for a website because it looked like an awesome cms and pretty straightforward , but it failed miserably . 
  the admin navigation did n't show , inline editing did n't work and everything worked slow . 
  later devs told me its security is pretty flawed and is server-heavy ( inefficient coding ) . 
  it 's free so go ahead and try it . 
  the concept is awesome but i 'm personally sticking to wordpress . 
  it 's actually an illuminati plan to flood the world in 2012 using satellite weapons to raise water levels in 90 % of cities to above windshield height to decrease populations worldwide and make way for a new generation of automobiles .

  hey ,, 
  thanks for the tip , unfortunately it did n't work , nothing happens on clicking . 
  would reformatting the script to work with, 
  tags work better ? 
  i do n't know how to do this though , was hoping you could help me out : /, 
  wicked , it actually works  would you have a suggestion for how to bring it back to `` view all '' mode ? 
  awesome , thanks so much !, 
  i just spent my last money getting you 1 month of reddit gold , 
  nice site !, 
  i wanted to ask here since i 'm sure this would be on others minds as well ; you say you 're proficient in wordpress , but you do n't explicitly mention php . 
  what 's your proficiency in php coding ? 
  personally i think your website is clear and presents itself neatly . 
  the only thing is that there is a lot of text on the research page , so perhaps give a bigger font size and more line spacing . 
  keep up the good work !, 
   yes i have made sure it 's in af . 
  yes , just checked , the aperture still changes . 
  i do n't know why but i have a feeling i 've seen this before .

  hey man , hope you 've been having a good time . 
  sorry to bother you , feel free to ignore me :d but i installed a few plugins and the jquery selector you helped me with a week or so ago stopped working , i was wondering if you would have an idea what caused it to malfunction . 
  working great , thanks . 
  i added the script as a custom page footer script and it seems to hold well . 
  thanks again for the awesome help !,

  mzungu can mean european , or novel . 
  also locals say to each other `` wewe mzungu '' to say `` you 're a wealthy guy ( like a european ) '' . 
  word comes from kuzungu , which literally translated means `` to wander around aimlessly '' ( used also to describe strangeness , oddity and novelty ) . 
  adding a suffix you get kuzunguka ( to rotate , go around ) .

  unfortunately this is legitimized by the patriot act etc. 
   according to the american civil liberties union , section 412 of the usa patriot act permits indefinite detention of immigrants ; one of the most highly publicized cases has been that of jose padilla . 
   on november 29 , 2011 , the united states senate rejected a proposed amendment to the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 that would have banned indefinite detention by the united states government of its own citizens , leading to criticism that habeas corpus in the united states has been undermined .
