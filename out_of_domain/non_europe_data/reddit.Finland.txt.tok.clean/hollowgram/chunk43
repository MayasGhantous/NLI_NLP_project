  fucking huge congratulations !, 
  this is awesome !, 
  you 're awesome !, 
  obviously it did n't , because he was awarded 22m , but that 's because they finally let him have his day in court . 
  if they wanted to they could have kept him there forever and no one would have been able to do anything . 
  i 'd say it 's safe to bet with the amount of news coming about people in guantanamo and immigrants such as jose padilla that this has happened to many nationalities , including us citizens . 
  now what would be a reasonable way to do this ? 
  prisons and i suppose jails as well in the us ( i 'm writing from finland ) are private institutions , i doubt there 's any full-scale `` inventory '' that could even be done that could somehow take such situations into consideration . 
  what studies are there that you could do statistics from ? 
  i 'm sure there are * at the very least * a handful of people that are being imprisoned until their death before having a day in court . 
  if you 've ever been in the drunk tank or spent some time in jail you get a small feeling of what it must be like to live inside that system . 
  it 's not peculiar for something like this to happen , especially in history and in less `` democratic '' socities . 
  ninja edit : also the ndaa and expanding powers and scope of the war on terror will continue to threaten our well being and will make situations like this and worse more and more common . 
  also , some reading material ( a little all over the place , but a small glimpse of what i 'm talking about ) :, 
  and links related to the expanding and inhuman war on terror :,

  i honestly wish there was a way to make an iframe . 
  heh , after seeing ngo work first hand in east africa , trust me : charity is a business , 
  dude , i have been a victim of the slip-out-hit-side-not-hole ( reverse cowgirl ) and i must say it is no joke . 
  i hurt for weeks afterward , i nearly went to the doctor but decided to let it heal , but i 'll tell you the one month or so of recovery from that moment ( which did n't hurt that much at the time ) makes me very cautious when i have her weight over mine, 
  `` it makes your heart pulse when you see it '', 
  no shit , especially if you 're johny ive . 
  no one will live your life for you . 
   and the * macro * ability of the iphone 4s is amazing, 
  ftfy, 
  i had a friend in spain who seriously thought apple was the dumbest company ever because they released the [ scrollwheel laptop ] ( http://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=onion%20apple%20laptop%20scroll&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0cdoqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theonion.com%2fvideo%2fapple-introduces-revolutionary-new-laptop-with-no%2c14299%2f&amp;ei=rgkqt_p9ickq4gtchdcvdg&amp;usg=afqjcnhsbtxelqxuns1nvf38xbdmxta9fa&amp;sig2=eex6_6w7rfacwabclxf6nq ) . 
  [ with the systems-on-a-chip ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microcontroller ) constantly getting smaller and cheaper , eventually they 'll become viable to stick into toothbrushes , food produce , etc. 
  [ that has the potential of turning life into someething more akin to an rpg ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/jesse_schell_when_games_invade_real_life.html ) . 
  just some wild thoughts . 
  i 'm at [ 7 ] . 
  can you really call it cold calling with so much information to go on ? 
  does n't look like theres a plugin for that . 
  have you considered flickr for photo hosting ? 
  there 's a lot of wp gallery plugins that can utilize flickr albums . 
  so much white space , why is writer so close to your name ? 
  line spacing !!, 
  / designerrant, 
  its a nice business card . 
  lol take it to an apple store in the us and see what happens , 
  show them this post !, 
  up the shadows ( from highlights/shadows in image -  adjust ) , duplicate layer filter -  other -  high pass ( vary the value depending on effect desired ) , change duplicated layer blend mode to overlay . 
  all hail the codex !, 
  if you 're a hammer , all your problems look like nails . 
  go mission control -  go to space 2 -  drag window into space 1 screen box above, 
  done . 
  well considering that 99 % of people never used spaces before from my experience ( yes , very subjective but still 30 + sample size  , i 've seen people utilize mission control more ( mostly because it replaces/adds onto expose ) . 
  so it might be one less step , but the framework/philosophy of mission control makes it more practical/accessible to everyday users . 
  even though i 'm a multimedia producer and sometimes am editing video while designing in photoshop and coding a website , before mission control i nearly never stretched my work on multiple desktops because i felt it to be a hassle remembering what is where and how do i get there . 
  now with mission control i do n't hesitate when i feel like i need more real estate . 
  it 's not perfect , e.g. 
  having multiple windows within an app open spread over many desktops ( like ftp for multiple web projects ) it can feel a bit incongruous what window is selected when , and i empathize with multi-monitor setup people ( although it 's more envy that they have such problems in the first place ) , but for me i do n't see any backwardness in how apple evolved expose and spaces into mission control . 
  tl ; dr no need to install lion , the future moves onwards even without our approval , understanding does n't make a difference . 
  we consume the jelly of the genius minds . 
  get the net !, 
  great , first link i open and my friend walks in . 
  yes , this is how i spend my time . 
  got ta love that motherfucker in there , 
  those are ex-police officers who annually do this to test police stations how easily a report can be made . 
  they know their rights and having to answer questions to the guy who supposed to give you the form is not a requirement . 
  it 's clear that the cop in harte is trying to not get a report made and get as much info so he can protect and serve his fellow policeman . 
  swahili is a very straight-forward language , i picked it up in 10 months to a proficient level . 
  i 'm planning to do a webseries to teach its basics , as the net has a small amount of accessible food swahili resources , but that 'll be a while . 
  for now , know that it 's a language with very few exceptions and takes its words mostly from bantu , arabic and english . 
  for your example `` this is a chair '' in swahili is `` hiki ni kiti '' , 
  i think the op meant using tear gas to disperse squabblers or something . 
  imagine what bad cops could do with this for stalking etc. 
  would have linked directly to the video but it 's flagged private :p, 
  non-disclosure agreement get one ( google it ), 
  do n't give a full copy of what you 've drafted to the client ( bullet points to refresh memory ), 
  you should be charging for such a consultation !, 
  that is definitely the clooney batman . 
  nearly all countries have wholesale stores , most of them just need you to sign up using a company/organization to get a card . 
  ask your family and friends . 
  if finland has em , you most likely have em too , 
  the thing is , in somalia it 's more of the situation . 
  with kony , we have an individual who is terrorizing entire nations with his lra . 
  plus , this ultimately is a cause started by one guy , i 'm sure there are other causes for somalia but they definitely do n't have their `` marketing '' as tight as invisible children . 
  i 'm hoping that once kony is jailed they will move to improve the infrastructure of neighbouring east african countries . 
   ... serifs are semi-structural details on the ends of some of the strokes that make up letters and symbols . 
  that thing at the end is a serif , but alas it was my mistake , i really forgot helvetica 's r had a small serif at the end . 
  my bad .

  fta :, 
   we have never claimed a desire to `` save africa , '' but , instead , an intent to inspire western youth to `` do more than just watch . '' and in central africa , focus on locally-led long-term development programs that enable children to take responsibility for their own futures and the futures of their countries . 
  if you already have a card i 'd recommend eos 550d/t2i as you can get that and a 50mm prime lens with 600 and use magic lantern to get hdmi output . 
  configuring proper lighting will take the quality of photos higher than simply switching to a 1d . 
  [ here 's a forum post on flickr ] ( http://www.flickr.com/groups/canon_550d/discuss/72157624010539527/ ) discussing overheating . 
  the op says he got 40-45 min recordings done but towards the end the overheating warning icon popped up . 
  so basically , you should be able to do 40 minute recordings without problems . 
  i bought some timberlands in 2008 from ebay for 60e and they 're still doing their job each fall/winter/spring , and i 'm living in finland ( so they get their fair share of wear and tear ) . 
  drinking while eating has no effect on your digestion . 
  this was debunked in / r/health or askscience a while back . 
  but great post !, 
  [ and yet ... ] ( http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/pharmawater_site/ ), 
  are you an expert in the field ? 
  basically your comment is saying `` these scientists and their report have it wrong '' . 
  should be a banner though , nothing like barely leading i death rally only to lose because battery is at 20 % . 
  have you heard of the research into using mdma to lessen ptsd ?
