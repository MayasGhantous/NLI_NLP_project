  7 bucks on dealextreme . 
  they would n't do it now , but they 've started to sow fb right into the os where the site itself is not presented , a la siri for google/wolfram . 
  fb is definitely going to have bumpy ride ahead , and if it plunges into the darkness i would n't be surprised to see apple scoop it up . 
  but it 's just sideline speculation , the main focus of what i was trying to say is that i think apple is playing its cards right and we 're witnessing the peak of their existence come into fruition . 
  unbeknownst to h8mx , cocothecat11 was in charge of that decision in apple . 
  back in 3g days , the s was speed . 
  it was such a noticeable change . 
  now , the s stands for siri . 
  tim cook confirmed this in d10 . 
  from a designer perspective there is absolutely no reason to go try and change the ui . 
  it works , people know it and those who do n't find it intuitive . 
  do n't fix what is n't broken . 
  if you want `` advanced '' and feel so caged , jailbreak or go android . 
  i 'm surprised to say i have probably inserted ten disks the entire time i 've owned my mid-2009 mbp . 
  the reason for no siri support ( iirc ) is that the ipad 2 does n't sport the same voice processing unit which does n't enable it to `` hone in '' on your voice from other outside noise . 
  also , iphone 4 does n't have dual antennas so maybe the qos is n't high enough to warrant adding facetime over 3g . 
  i may be wrong about this one though . 
  yeah , if it were my decision i 'd greenlight it , but apple has its own reasons , but for some reason i ca n't quite convince myself their motives are purely monetary . 
  how is this nsfl ? 
  fuck you barry . 
  you should start with graphics design theory and move onto photoshop tutorials to get a grounded understand of what it 's all about . 
  pm me your e-mail address and i 'll send you more tutorials than you can shake a stick at , 
  why is n't this app available in the eu ?!, 
  grr !, 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  ... what is her profession ? 
  [ here ] ( http://justcreative.com/2008/06/13/how-to-design-learn-the-basics/ ) are [ two ] ( http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/04/25/a-comprehensive-guide-for-amateur-graphic-designers-and-beginners/ ) good round-ups on theory with links to further resources . 
  below is a selection of tutorials/resources from my collection , if you have something specific in mind , let me know and i 'll post you what i can . 
  that is some a quality advice right there . 
  generic pop music requires clean sounds all reaching for +0 db , it 's challenging as fuck from a producing perspective . 
  you should channel that frustration into better challenges , setting up a question where the only possible answer highlights the absurdity of their stance . 
  for example :, 
  mrhubris : i still believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion and we should n't hold science at a higher level than what the average joe believes . 
  you : well would you consult the average joe on a heart condition and let them operate on you ? 
  frustration is not sexy at all and it 's antisocial behavior . 
  being in a group is its own social dynamic and you should n't ever have to resort to threatening behavior , which frustration can easily project , but rather keeping your cool and laughing off the ignorance of others and moving onto having a great time . 
  frustration is beta behavior , it means you 're losing control of the situation and of your own state . 
  this is unattractive to everyone , especially at a party . 
  an alpha does n't lose his state . 
  parties are social gatherings and everyone aims to enjoy themselves and to mingle with the high-status people ( people having a great time at a party are at a higher standing than those in the sidelines looking at the party ) . 
  people will quickly leave your company if you 're aggressively confrontational rather than opinionated and suave . 
  edit : removed slightly tasteless end comment , if you want to see it [ rambis has it in his comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/v7cy2/if_you_say_that_homeopathy_is_bullshit_in_a_party/c523pxx ) below . 
  true , my bad . 
  have a good day nonetheless !, 
  i never said convert them ( or heaven forbid debate them , that turns ugly fast ) , just poke at the gaping holes and have a laugh . 
  we are talking about a party setting here , 
  how did they find out who he was accurately enough to know who to ban ? 
  was he prank-calling with his passport number ? 
  cc is not merely making it more real , it 's bring out the atmosphere that 's more in line with what you 're trying to express . 
  so stick with the original on this one , 
  thank god for the ussr !, 
  you 're not very good at this ` job ' thing , are you ? 
  insulting your boss while admitting to wasting marketing funds is a fail in my book . 
  if you go to the all mail folder you 'll see your archived mails too . 
  so that would be b ), 
  the sea of waves below the dotted visualizer does n't react at all really to the sounds , but this was pretty to look at . 
  slight camera pan would add a lot of depth . 
  how about a decentralized anarchy ? 
  pedometer going off the charts here . 
  no twista ? 
  [ overnight celebrity ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsydbpouyue ), 
  [ mr tung twista ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkevkwyin1i ), 
  she 's pretty but down-to-earth kind of pretty . 
  people can relate while still idolize/fantasize . 
  it 's good . 
  in the sense that it 's clear . 
  i 'd recommend showing two boxes under the contact box on the front page , the two most recent added films , for example . 
  also , the youtube descriptions of these videos has a lot of info on the project . 
  adding those below the video on the video page would help create context and provide additional info ( = better search ranking ) . 
  edit : also navigation text size could increase a lot . 
  you probably wo n't be adding anything into the navbar and there 's a lot of empty space plus the text is smaller than other texts on the page . 
  about page styling could use more hierarchy , like the films he 's worked on section , the whole thing is one text after another even though these are distinguished marks of his career . 
  edit2 : also your theme is n't very responsive . 
  try dragging the window smaller and watch the horror . 
  i do n't watch the show , but i 'd imagine watching that much of anyone would make some people feel really emotionally attached to her . 
  i 'm glad they went with her though , perfect fit for the role . 
  should have ended on monday . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  big frikkin surprise . 
  note : if you really want to see it via youtube , set up a proxy or use the easier-but-not-meant-for-streaming [ hotspot shield ] ( http://hotspotshield.com/ ) . 
  there are * ahem * other ways of findorrenting it . 
  quality hour of television i must say , i 'm looking forward to episode 2 . 
  well responsive means flyidly flexing to even mobile ( 320px width ) sizes . 
  its nit mandatory , but when you have `` responsive design '' written in tour footer it is expected . 
  full width might not be so good , you need to scroll down for any info and it hogs the cpu . 
  theres the full screen button if i wanted to cover my screen . 
  blue !, 
  for the love of all that is holy , use baby and navy blue . 
  this red is the wrong color to use for lucid dreaming . 
  think night-time , dream world . 
  nice texture , now why is the info itself so small ? 
  unless this is a card for an optometrist , i 'd suggest making the content at least a 1/3 of the actual space available . 
  [ reminded me of this classic scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwdwkok0qcu ) . 
  was that the normal speed or does/can it go faster ? 
  how cost-effective is it ?

  unless , of course , by `` i 've just done this for her '' you mean `` i 've rehosted an old image on imgur '' and by `` my girlfriend '' you mean `` reddit '', 
  what 's the most heated situation you witnessed ? 
  consume 2000 kcal of table sugar .
