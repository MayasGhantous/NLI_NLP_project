  if you want to catch up on nutritional science , i recommend [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbnniua6-om ) . 
  tbh , on my iphone , images can take a while to load ( especially gifs ) , and in the latest alien blue , articles can go through readability , so reading is preferable to me . 
  then again , i am not your average redditor . 
  if you have even the slightest interest in music , even if you never tried to play before , i recommend getting garageband and watching some youtube videos on it . 
  it 's amazing and wonderful music exploration made easy . 
  camera + is kick-ass for photo editing . 
  there are a lot of games for iphone , from gtaiii to infinity blade to ticket to ride , so give them a try . 
  personally i play a lot of othello and backgammon :d, 
  star walk is a beautiful app . 
  you 're not flying over the atlantic in that case . 
  - new layer, 
  - merge that new layer with the old ones you wish to merge . 
  i think you can set the audio output source in your sound settings . 
  i dunno , that 's a pretty impressive physique if you ask me . 
  big in finland too . 
  true , but that 's a bit overkill for my taste . 
  it takes a helluva lot of dedication and work to get to where that guy is and i can relate to him . 
  those guys ... worked like hell and sacrificed but i ca n't relate to them nearly as much . 
  dat color . 
  calories in vs calories used is all it is , metabolism is overrated . 
  eat less or exercise more my friend . 
  can you run an itunes version that allows library sharing ?

  future-proof your device if you 're dropping so much on this next-gen machine .

  good for those who want it scheduled i suppose . 
  you could save someone 's life if they 've just passed out from huffing too much helium/nitrogen . 
  blow into their mouth to introduce co2 back into their lungs . 
  many people seeing someone pass out from helium/nitrogen might think they 're ok .

  and how exactly is this proper file management ? 
  setting resources to 0 mb ? 
  this video is a joke . 
  i do graphics for a living for the past 10 years and i can tell you this video is full of crap . 
  if you really think you can copy and store youtube videos in a photoshop file maybe you deserve to believe his words :d, 
  ok guys and girls , i ca n't imagine anyone taking this advice seriously , but just in case , here 's a run-down for why ** this video is fud ** :, 
  - subscribing and liking yt videos has no effect on their ability to be downloaded . 
  this is a scam to get more subs and likes . 
  - copying the thumbnail images from your browser will not magically copy the videos . 
  - pasting images into photoshop will not link these files to anything . 
  if you drag files into ps , they will become [ smart objects ] ( http://www.photoshoplab.com/photoshop-smarter-smart-objects.html ) ( which are still copies of the original file ) . 
  - the more resources you give photoshop , the better it will run . 
  if you feel 0 mb is a good setting , great . 
  it 's just has no correlation to reality . 
  - unit sizes do nothing but obscure your ps . 
  if you want to work in picas , go ahead , but this is not usually used . 
  points and pixels are much more common . 
  - history states to 1000 ? 
  ok , i 'd recommend 100-150 at most . 
  not much effect on performance . 
  - more cache levels = slower file opening but more performance, 
  if you want to read on ps optimization , [ read this ] ( http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/optimize-performance-photoshop-cs4-cs5.html ) . 
  if you want to learn how to download youtube videos , use a service like [ keepvid ] ( http://keepvid.com/ ) . 
  if you want to learn how to embed video into photoshop files , delete photoshop . 
  does satire have a place at / r/howto ? 
  could lead amateurs astray . 
  but yes , i did take it seriously . 
  i shall resume eating cardboard . 
  yup , because finland is so prone to earthquakes ... 
  even rabbi 's were going `` go shorty , it 's your birthday ! '', 
  it was definitely a defining moment in hip-hop history . 
  but no history rests on any single story . 
  i tried it in finland and there was nearly nothing near helsinki , pretty much everything was from northern areas and estonia . 
  but who knows , that was half a year ago . 
   if you guys do n't want proof that is totally fine, 
  when in reddit history has this ever happened ? 
  spooky how close that looks to the first ipad . 
  also reminds me of the old [ macbook ] ( http://www.notebookcheck.net/uploads/tx_nbc2/overview_hero1_20100518.jpg ) . 
  female saps fleeing the scene :d, 
  great example of how pr is done .

  [ you can read their journey of making this happen ] ( http://www.custom-logic.com/blog/v-motion-project-the-instrument/ ) and see [ this ] ( http://vimeo.com/45220781# ) video test where the same song is playing and the effect of his movements are more pronounced . 
  shit , this is the type of thing i 've seen in my dreams , this inspires me to keep pushing my music and art so i could one day take it to the next level with something as accessible as this . 
  edit : by no means was this an easy feat , but the inroads made with their work and describing their process in detail helps bring this type of technology into the mainstream . 
  give it a couple years . 
  they 'll be back asking for the exact same thing until they get it . 
  keep at it , it 's definitely a slow starter .
