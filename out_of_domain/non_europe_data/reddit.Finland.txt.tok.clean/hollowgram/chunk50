  your whole food intake is your diet . 
  modern use of the `` diet '' has diminished the meaning of the word , but your diet is your diet .

  i am in no way officially affiliated with apple and i can confidently confirm that the iphone might get widgets at some point in time . 
  i always got my products , customer service answers . 
  shipping can take a while though . 
  night off is what got me back into my habits . 
  i do n't recommend it . 
  used l3ttxj37rr7l , first and last already used . 
  would have been nice to see photos of the concept prototypes ... 
  nsfw . 
  ever since al gore presented the idea conspiracy websites have been running rampant that governments want to tax us for breathing , i.e. 
  the carbon tax . 
  any google about `` carbon tax '' and `` conspiracy '' will give a lot of material . 
  damn shame too . 
  i figure it 's big oil and the like manufacturing this type of disinformation . 
  step 1 : buy proper peanut butter or make it yourself . 
  sorry , but you still need to use visual studio to make the apps . 
  you need to use microsoft 's proprietary winjs library for javascript effects . 
  you can not make a website perform like a native app even within ie10 . 
  so just because ms is using html5 and css it does n't mean they 're standards compliant all of a sudden . 
  if you look at the official video or lyrics you 'll see they say cray , not kray . 
  security agencies put out warnings every day for all kinds of targets . 
  `` you do n't get it man , they randomly take people and brainwash them to be terrorists . '', 
  with this line of reasoning * everything * is caused by the all-mighty . 
  to be fair , the judge was letting him use foul language to quite an extent until he went totally overboard and threw logic out the window . 
  at first there was a glimmer of hope he would formulate a valid argument against police testimony ( not that it would have mattered ultimately ) , which i thought was right of the court , but if you go off like that in a court room all you can get is a bad sentencing . 
  it 's a joke . 
  but if you want to quench your thirst for logic , most likely this headache would take some time to develop and thus would n't immediately disappear either . 
  she looks nearly two-faced with the way the shadows reveal how much powder make-up she has on the shadowed side of her face . 
  seems paler than the other side as well . 
  me no likey , although otherwise the photo is nice . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  does this mean reinstalling would fox it ? 
  what dis your dad do to fix it ? 
  thanks .

  the thing is i have hundreds of contacts and tens of photos for different contacts . 
  i guess i 'll just have to tolerate it until i visit a country with a genius bar :p, 
  i 've tried googling the issue but so many non-relevant results show up i just gave up . 
  it was only supposed to copy profile pics , birthdays and email/im info . 
  reddit users spot seedy submission behind worldwide news . 
  hollow checking in , sounds dope !, 
  they 're taking marketing tips from apple i suppose , 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  definitely an objective , might fail to hold onto the money until next month , 
  but the problem is that pretty much any venture can be treated as ridiculous , from pro-legalization to gay marriage , and addressing it without any `` respect '' . 
  these people hold religion close to their heart , i do n't think it helps anyone to approach their beliefs with a sense of ridiculousness . 
  highlighting how it 's ridiculous to you is better , but to say `` my view is better than your view '' is exactly what i believe we 're trying to fight against . 
  we all have ridiculous beliefs on how the world works . 
  each usb has the two holes on the plug . 
  hollow side up and it goes right in , 
  y u no learn ? 
  you are free to whine for the limitations of free service but it wo n't make the situation any different . 
  if you want control , you need to pay for it . 
  i highly recommend it too . 
  way better centered in this case . 
  use the rule of thirds for the sky/water line . 
  and i 'd recommend doing something about the noise . 
  turn off wifi when going about your biz , has given me like 30 % more battery . 
  ok , i do n't want to sound crude , but perhaps you 're looking at it the wrong way . 
  wordpress is open-source and free , developed by volunteer devs and automattic , the company the creators of wordpress founded . 
  they make some money but they 're not living large , and they give a free platform to quickly get a blog up and running . 
  you can run an impressive blog from their service , and many do . 
  content is always king . 
  a big part of content is the ability to search through it . 
  the mechanics of enabling on/off states for various parts of a theme requires more coding and more drain on the server . 
  wordpress is n't the most efficient platform ( php as a language itself is partially to blame ) and asking for more without paying for it i hope you understand can be seen as absurd . 
  they operate many services , aid in developing a content management system that powers ~ 14 % of the top 1 million websites on the internet and give it all for free . 
  all you would need to do is find a host , which range from free ( not recommended ) to a couple dollars to around a hundred a year . 
  ** tl ; dr ** there 's a finnish saying that do n't look a gift horse in the mouth . 
  hi , i am someone who got killed for picking up a hitchhiker , ama . 
  most likely it will be `` the new iphone '' . 
  sign up for couchsurfing , ask friends who have an accoint to leave a few recommendations , request a couch from members . 
  go to couchsurfing.org , read the faq , google for more info , ask around . 
  amazing job , you got lucky seeing all those animals !, 
  too dark , i doubt this would be distinctive when printed . 
  brighten it up , get rid of that inner shadow ( why ?! ), 
  and try keeping font width below 120 % . 
  use a complementary color to the blue ( shades of orange ) to make it pop more . 
  a man dies twice , once in flesh and another in memory . 
  2 steps forward , 1 step back . 
  rinse , repeat . 
  gauge . 
  he handled that well . 
  you have to risk it all to get it at all . 
  if this breaks you , at least you can say for certain you gave it your everything . 
  do n't fear death , fear never living . 
  google `` free date ideas '' and you 'll get a plethora of options . 
  you miss 100 % of the shots you do n't take my friend . 
  if there is interest from you and her , pursue it .
