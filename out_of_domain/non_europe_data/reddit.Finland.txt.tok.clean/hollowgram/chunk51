   in an unusually forthright interview on israeli television , matthew gould said that an increasing number of britons see israel as `` goliath '' and the palestinians as `` david '' -- a mirror image of the jewish state 's narrative of itself . 
  that fake narrative ca n't have anything to do with this , can it ? 
  oh , my bad :(, 
  what is it that you want to do ? 
  logic should automatically detect the presence of the keyboard . 
  to bind the various functions you can use cmd + l to bind functions as you please or install m-audio drivers as djohnh pointed out .

  the last two summers were fantastic . 
  long summer days . 
  this summer is an abomination ( with only a handful of good days ) , something i 'd expect of britain . 
  and get this , the last two years i was abroad in spain and tanzania . 
  i visited last summer for two weeks and it was awesome . 
  i had high expectations of this summer but it has been a mixed bag . 
  but when it 's good , it 's damn good .

  if you were surprised what you were getting into there , i have a few websites to show that can make you insanely rich ... 
  it boils down to the second law of thermodynamics . 
  eat as much as you use and you wo n't add or lose weight . 
  no study has ever been able to show evidence that the timing of a meal or the size of the portion has any effect on how it is absorbed . 
  of course , timing can make a huge difference in whether you feel starving or nourished , but for weight gain/loss it 's all about the calories . 
   but at the very least breakfast makes me feel better :p, 
  and that , my internet-stranger-friend , is what it is all about  feeling better . 
  everything becomes more entropic over time . 
  i should have just said `` laws of thermodynamics '' because the jist of what i 'm getting at is that 2 . no engine is 100 % efficient and 1 . the body constantly uses energy . 
  a calorie is not a calorie in the sense that 2000 kcal of eggs will not affect your body in the same way as 2000 kcal of refined sugar , but you * can not be unable * to lose weight eating at a calorie deficit . 
  the body simply must get its energy from somewhere and a calorie is a measure of the foods combustibility ( e.g. 
  the body 's ability to get energy/fuel from the food ) . 
  [ case in point ] ( http://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ceoqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cnn.com%2f2010%2fhealth%2f11%2f08%2ftwinkie.diet.professor%2findex.html&amp;ei=grkkuoadluxt4qtopidoca&amp;usg=afqjcnf8nroxudhawuz7ynql4qubxtcdbw ) . 
  everything is more expensive than semen . 
  well if you consider yourself as nothing compared to others , you got self-worth issues to solve before you 'll be able to attract ladies . 
  ask yourself who are you . 
  what makes you who you are . 
  what are the best things about you ? 
  what do you have to give to people ? 
  what do you look for in others ? 
  focus on those in all situations , build upon that foundation and you have a good start . 
  rather ashes than dust my friend . 
  i thought the whole purpose of android is to root it and make it as custom as you want . 
  * shrugs *, 
  the whole android ethos seems to be niche groups of tech-savvy it people and cheap smartphone-wanting masses . 
  i 've jailbroken but i never really got that much out of the additional functionality ( and had the camera bug on me each time ) so i 'm rolling vanilla and enjoying my ota updates  i just enjoy things that just work , like instruments . 
  others demand more control , which is fine i guess . 
  nearly anyone i 've ever met who praises the customized solutions he/she has made has never convinced me that this would be something every user could benefit from . 
  but i would support making a backdoor `` advanced mode '' available , although i know it wo n't ever come officially . 
  i feel ya , it would be nice to have 3g , wifi , bluetooth , location servies toggles in the notification center . 
  perhaps one day it will become mission control ? 
  one can dream ... , 
  alternatively they could make use of the never-useful volume slider in the app switcher next to orientation lock . 
  would be a logical place for them too . 
  judging by the quote i 'd say it 's from season 1 , episode 9 : compassion . 
  i meant more the prupose of owning one , as its expandable functionality ( that android users always seem to rave about ) are otherwise very limited . 
  why do they feel nolan should express his political view ? 
  i think his absence of straight up revealing what he thinks to be a strong suite in this movie , he shows different ideals struggling and even contradicting each other . 
  why is that an issue for these critics ? 
  that is a simple post-process effect achieved easily in after effects even by a beginner .

  i do n't think that guy published these books , he 's referring to material he 's read while making those ... animations ... 
  b. . . but it 's news 2.0 !, 
  yup , let 's privatize the military . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  well this was in response to the whole `` get the government out of my life '' ideology that op ( before my comment ) was referring to . 
  he would argue that the current gold reserves would n't hurt economies and the limit would n't come for a long time . 
  count your calories and i 'm sure you 'll realize you do n't `` suck through the calories '' , you just have a balanced calorie intake .
