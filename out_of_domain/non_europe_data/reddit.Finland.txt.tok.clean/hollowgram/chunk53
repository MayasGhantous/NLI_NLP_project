  weighs nothing , awesome performance , great screen . 
  mbp weighs a lot and produces a lot of heat . 
  tell me about it , i was expecting it to be released alongside the rmbp , but alas it 's nothing but waiting ... 
  i really really really dislike tittie boy . 
  ever since i got introduced to him via beez in the trap ( srsly people , wtf was with that song ? ), 
  and hearing him say his name 300 times the only silver lining is that his verse in mercy was n't horrible . 
  he 's just a country boy making it big with the right people . 
  i do n't hate on the guy , but i sure ai n't listening to his music and do n't know why someone would . 
  what did i just watch ? 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=auycxbzep9o#t=98s '' ) . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but bacteria ca n't survive on a tongue scraper even overnight . 
  im sure a lot of people would find your job interesting , talk about that !, 
  please do !, 
  dem good ` ol days when fridges had cfc 's , tv gave us the news and we could buy trucks without thinking about the earth !, 
  in an infinite amount of universes , one is bound to be where your life is a reality tv show . 
  good news is , you 're director , writer and producer as well as the main lead !, 
  if you think there is no difference between a 7d and c100 sensor or video performance i have a bridge to sell you . 
  yeah , you need to say `` thanks for the drink , excuse me but i ( need to get back to my friends/want to enjoy it alone ) '' if you are n't feeling the buyers company . 
  the horror !, 
  barbell squats my friend !, 
  do n't send final deliverables until final payment . 
  always have a contract with a termination clause . 
  watch [ f * ck you , pay me ] ( http://vimeo.com/m/22053820 ) . 
  i hate new android devices because of the lack of a dedicated home button . 
  it 's valuable not to be able to accidentally go out of the screen im in . 
  also , iphone designs are evolutionary and there 's no reason to fix what is n't broke . 
  each iteration is that much closer to the ideal of what the iphone team has in mind . 
  funny , the wiki page on fruity has nothing about people acting crazy !, 
  you need 101 upvotes on this to get to 909 status !, 
   i feel fortunate for the things that i 've been blessed with , simply by being an american . 
  had i been born somewhere else , i would n't have the liberty of commenting to this post , must less having an opinion in general . 
  only an american would say such a thing ...

  all i could do is yell fucking idiots at my screen . 
  sorry , i 'm new here . 
  infection is much higher during the first six months of the carrier catching the disease , which is also the time when it 's not readily noticeable . 
  afterwards the chances lower significantly . 
  rswany , you benevolent internet stranger , i salute you . 
  thank you so much .

  yup , big difference between fasting and starving .

  she was saying to the son that `` he probably means you '' etc. 
  but `` nervously '' laughing at the whole thing . 
  shame we do n't have another angle ... 
  you sound like a reversed car salesman . 
  bomb !, 
  do you jog with camera gear ? 
  jogging stays . 
  independently confirmed by the publishing company , they came forward . 
  you think the fbi and apple went `` oh shit ! '', 
  and cut them a deal ? 
  you kinda need a brain to feel pain or experience anything really . 
  that 's what you get for investing in first gen tech !, 
  got everything it needed from the mother via the umbilical until birth . 
  reduce your caloric intake and increase the amount of protein you eat . 
  i think the first works best . 
  if there would be an old man on the left bench to contrast with the younger dudes on the right it would 've worked even better . 
  nice shoes . 
  they do , at least in ipad . 
  but for an iphone screen having a windowed video playing is counter-productive in 99 % of cases ( this being one of the 1 % situations ) . 
  google 's new youtube app has inline video , but i doubt it 's possible to accomplish inside a browser currently . 
  what i wonder is why does n't apple do mobile versions of its own website ? 
  * shrug *, 
  go to a shoemaker store and ask them , the color and material have a big effect on what 's the correct substance and application method . 
  they 'll gladly help you and it 'll add years to your shoe !, 
  that was magic , even at [ 0 ] . 
  well , it does have the artists credit at the bottom of each image ... 
  good luck trying to keep those clean , 
   implying you want the suede to keep looking like suede and not chemical vomit, 
  you perhaps live in a dry area ? 
  here in finland , such boots untreated will lose color and become hideous pretty fast , discolored and fugly because of the snow and slush . 
  and unlike leather , you ca n't really recolor it to give it back its shine . 
  what was sign ? 
  with next-gen imacs on the way and an ipad mini most definitely coming before holiday season , it would seem the peak is still not here . 
  this `` innovation '' you speak of is a dud term and does n't mean anything concrete . 
  no one is offering a tablet solution that touches near the ipad ( 91 % mobile web presence ) . 
  many people lament the iphone 5 and yet it sold 2m pre-orders in less than 24 hours . 
  apple will be moving a lot of product for the next year at least no matter what pundits say . 
  maybe they will come out with an appletv and a renewed mac pro next year , who knows . 
  but they 're not starting their decline this year for sure .
