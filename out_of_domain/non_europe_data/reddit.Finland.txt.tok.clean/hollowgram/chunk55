  i 'd recommend a superwide , a normal zoom lens and a telephoto lens to get started . 
  [ amber lyon ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2012-09-30/3-time-emmy-award-winning-cnn-journalist-mainstream-media-takes-money-foreign ) is a three-time emmy-winning journalist . 
  sorry about the source , but she has no wiki . 
  i 'm sure everyone is n't mistaking her emmy winnings , though , and that puts weight on what she says to the extent that you should n't dismiss the source , succumbing to something akin to a reverse appeal of authority fallacy . 
  you genetic lottery winning motherfucker , 
  slow it down a bit and add some music . 
  it 'll smooth it out , i do n't think this requires tracking at all . 
  not true , i live in finland but use the local app store in english . 
  that 's a nice 3d render . 
  this is like volkswagen vs. audi = they might have the same engine and skeleton , but the audi has much more durable build quality . 
  same with chinese rip-offs of popular brands . 
  i 'm not saying orvis makes bad boots , but red wing is legendary , brushing them off as `` exactly the same '' is n't accurate at all . 
  sure , people love being ripped off , therefore audi . 
  i highly doubt the build quality is as good as red wing , their boots can last over a decade . 
  whats the reference ? 
  well , when we 're talking about the general way of how society functions , it 's not far off . 
  is n't this a bit like a 3rd party repair parts manufacturer being held accountable that the main company does n't make products that do n't break ? 
  or protein supplement producers being criticized because it 's hard to eat wholesomely nowadays ? 
  pharmaceutical companies are working on [ preventative medicines ] ( http://www.cancerquest.org/cancer-prevention-with-drugs.html ) as well as `` cures '' , but it 's all multi-faceted and complicated as hell . 
  easy to point fingers and say `` conspiracy '' but ultimately there 's no golden standard to compare to , other than researching how it is in reality , talking with industry insiders and scientists and getting a bigger picture . 
  but that 's a lot of work , so fuck it , right ? 
  we should n't throw around the word `` cure '' around so liberally , strictly speaking we 've only managed to cure bacterial infections with the use of antibiotics ( and small triumphs over viruses , like smallpox ) , but even those are losing their effects because of over-use . 
   so long as a company can sell it at a profit , they 'll produce pharmaceuticals . 
  so in other words , as long as they 're in business they 'll keep doing their job . 
  sure , we should lobby our governments to invest more in treatments and medicine research , but we can hardly blame companies for operating on a profit incentive , that 's their obligation to shareholders !, 
  if we want to change that , we should n't be talking to companies themselves but the government that regulates how companies function . 
  again , what standard are we comparing all of this to ? 
  has it been better in some other time ? 
  we can perhaps * imagine * how things could be better but that does n't mean we should * demand * things function the way we wish them to , who knows what the unintended consequences of that may be . 
  imo , we should think about how we want our government ( aka society ) to function , promote discussion and participation and work to remodel the system rather than blaming companies for doing what they see as best within the confines and edges of how laws are set . 
  edit : smallpox is not a bacteria :p, 
  oops , my bad . 
  corrected above . 
  demand good performance . 
  if restoring does n't work , take it to an apple store ( not the place you bought it from , if it is n't one ) and you 'll be set . 
  this is what you pay for !, 
  or chalky white !, 
  * woke up this morning , watched them all in one *, 
  remember , owen has a skill set . 
  gah , some folks ( like me ) do n't watch the previews . 
  * please * use spoiler tags for things not covered in this episode . 
   their obligation * should * be to people who are dying of painful diseases , not to some person thousands of miles away . 
  again , see my comment :, 
   we can perhaps imagine how things could be better but that does n't mean we should demand things function the way we wish them to, 
  the pharmaceutical companies do * their * best in helping people who are ill ( not just the painfully so ) , if they would n't actually help those in need they would n't be in business , now would they ? 
  but ultimately , they 're a business and need to operate as one . 
  if you think this is n't how it should be , it 's up to you and me to do something about it . 
  but once you start getting into the nitty gritty , it 's not so clear-cut . 
  and i 'd consider myself an anarchist of sorts but i believe the only way we 'll decentralize societal control is by evolving , not revolting . 
  participating in government and shaping it to serve its citizens imo is the first step in making an anarchist society -- by making government obsolete . 
  organic news !, 
  that 's what she said . 
  you should !, 
  kickstarter this !, 
  quite rude to call his music average . 
  perhaps it gave the actors a sense of urgency when running . 
  `` they 're after us ! '', 
   4 years later there i am . 
  how old are you ? 
  i can bend my left thumb all the way back to touch my wrist . 
  no more keying cars , it 'll be cutting cars !,

   redditor for 12 hours, 
  proof ? 
  i can [ imagine the hand gesture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kibcd.gif ) as i read this . 
  at least these guys show the whole thing on youtube !, 
  make the m work as a negative as well . 
  the pulse linesseems a bit too squigly for a logo implementation . 
  simplify , highlight the core idea and make that m stand out . 
  great job !, 
  i 'd recommend addinga slight blueish hue to the concrete rather than leaving it totally grey though . 
  you 're about as subtle as a kick in the teeth . 
  i 'd imagine lag being an issue ? 
  well , it also does 2.7 k at 30fps , 1080p at 60fps and 720p at ** 120 fps ** . 
  definite improvements ( wifi app , remote to simultaneously link up to 50 cameras , touchscreen and battery modules ) , amazing quality . 
  just [ look at the footage ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=a3pdxmyof5u ) . 
  all i 'm saying is if someone were to buy me one of these , i would not be mad . 
  30 consecutive photos @ 12 megapixels , at 3,5 or 10 photos per second . 
  edit : 30 fps for one second , or 3/5/10 fps continuous , as pointed out by / u/acearchie, 
  return it !, 
  alternatively , sell it today ( aka asap ) . 
  most people do n't know this is out yet , value wo n't drop for a while . 
  i bet my left testicle that the whale was alive . 
  super rich kids roll with indifference , super rich kids go slow and do n't repent . 
  he helped a lot with aids research and medicine access as well as some other stuff .

  how can you tell a joke is bad ? 
  when you can guess the punchline . 
   why does he deserve a nice apartment for free, 
  because homeless people are human beings ? 
  there 's a lot of rich people living in mansions because they were born into wealth , should we take away all of that as well ? 
  if you do n't give people a chance to live , they will go extreme . 
  just look at us prison system vs. nordic penal systems , portugal drug laws vs. 
  us drug laws . 
  in finland where i live there are communal centers and housing offered to those without a home ( and although the system is n't perfect ) , it prevents people from freezing to death or alienating themselves from society . 
  woah , i see some future in that . 
  [ see this comment !,

  do people just not know about the ux differences between ios and android ?
