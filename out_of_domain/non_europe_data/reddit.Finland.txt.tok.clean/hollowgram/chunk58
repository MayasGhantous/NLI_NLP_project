  i was disappointed there was no talk of the `` fiscal cliff '' . 
  also , is it just me or does the video player buffer forever in full screen but resumes the instant i view it in its container ?

  beat the hell out that fucker . 
  why the hell did they remove the `` browse '' button from the top navigation ( next to upload ) ? 
  now on the left sidebar there 's `` browse channels '' and that 's it . 
  do n't they want people to discover content ?

  [ there was a discussion in design_critiques a few days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/14f4bd/so_youtube_just_changed_their_design_check_it_out/ ) about this topic . 
  my opinion is that overall i like the flattened new look , but the user interface is tiny , non-responsive and worst of all , it 's harder to discover content . 
  the browse button on the top navigation has disappeared , replaced by browse channels in the left sidebar and a `` recommended for you '' in the front page feed . 
  fusion drive , my friend . 
  fusion drive . 
  $ 250 , 3tb is 400 . 
  this will make your entire setup exponentially faster and help make it last into the future . 
  otherwise you have a ** 5400rpm drive ** . 
  well that looks like it could be amazing . 
  do you have undercover installed ? 
  hmm , strange . 
  i have this same issue as you , i figured it was find my mac/undercover updating its location . 
  not to mention it could have imploded because it was just a small outpost instead of central command like the whole movie made it feel like . 
  and why only one t-1000 ? 
  that shit was the penultimate .

  god no !!!,

  stewart covers the news in a way only a jester in king 's court can , full of truth by pointing at the obvious , inciting laughs .

  modern `` republicans '' are very pro-military , no one is saying that they 're held as military leaders . 
  but you 'd be living under a rock or in utter hubris to deny that the drive for military action ( no defense cuts , more aggressive foreign policy , etc. ), 
  is mostly coming from the gop . 
  both sides are fucked , i 'm living in finland , from here it looks like the us is eating itself alive . 
  bs instead of substance , words instead of action . 
  the gop is as much of a political party as cancer is an organism . 
   my point of view on it is why bother ? 
  i do n't see the downside to having scripts running by default . 
  1 ) as op pointed out , you get faster loading pages, 
  2 ) google and other parties ca n't track your behavior, 
  3 ) iirc jquery and other frameworks can be enabled , meaning most `` functionality '' is preserved , as most websites use these, 
   though i would n't have thought a few kb of data would mean much speed increase . 
  it 's not about file sizes , it 's about processing power and memory . 
  flash ( especially on non-windows computers ) is a monster hoarder , as well as scripts that do everything from tracking your clicks to behavior patterns in your browsing to target your advertising and search results . 
  just read a google eula and search to see all the analytics and ad network programs out there . 
  why was the browse button removed from the top next to upload ? 
  my eyes are not fine , i do n't wear glasses/contacts and i 'm not fatigued . 
  why do they have humans at all ? 
   only 192 kbps, 
  i 'm pretty sure you could n't tell the difference if i played 320 and 192 back to back for you . 
  it 's a company funding production and not a nation . 
   the heritage foundation is an american conservative think tank based in washington , d.c. heritage 's stated mission is to `` formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise , limited government , individual freedom , traditional american values , and a strong national defense '' . 
  make of that what you will . 
  i produce music as a hobby and stand bymy words . 
  have a friend play you 192 and 320 songs and see if you can spot the difference over 50 % of the time . 
  what 's wrong with donating organs after you 've deceased ?
