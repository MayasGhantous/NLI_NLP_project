  your only luck to score any money is to give all your time to everyone trying to make the new facebook/twitter for free , settling for whatever they promise to give once they make the big time . 
  defragging is unnecessary and some programs can actually screw up the symbolic relations between files and make the system unusable .

  smells of chemicals . 
  i 've always held that the simpsons is much more enjoyable and logical watched in reverse : it 's about an artists passion to capture an essence of the american way of life , starting grandiose and simplifying it until it looks hand-drawn and as short as a sketch .

  wait , do the producers of that youtube clip get compensated for the airing of that clip ? 
  from the above reply by shikahusu :, 
   the `` trick '' jones referred to was placing a chart of proxy temperature records , which ended in 1980 , next to a line showing the temperature record collected by instruments from that time onward . 
  `` it 's hardly anything you would call a trick , '' mann said , adding that both charts were differentiated and clearly marked . 
   the `` decline '' refers to the `` divergence problem '' . 
  this is where tree ring proxies diverge from modern instrumental temperature records after 1960 . 
  the divergence problem is discussed as early as 1998 , suggesting a change in the sensitivity of tree growth to temperature in recent decades ( briffa 1998 ) . 
  it is also examined more recently in wilmking 2008 which explores techniques in eliminating the divergence problem . 
  so when you look at phil jone 's email in the context of the science discussed , it is not the schemings of a climate conspiracy but technical discussions of data handling techniques available in the peer reviewed literature . 
  [ his reply is much better , it has links !,

  it 's so sad ... it 's like the fact that more people die in america in a month from car crashes then have ever died from terrorist attacks is a bad thing , since we have people like this and governments like that which are fueling the terror , creating the next generation in the middle east and elsewhere to absolutely loathe america because of what is done abroad in its name .

  only read this in case of relapse :, 
  here 's a suggestion that worked for some : instead of saying to yourself `` i ca n't drink at all '' , how about selecting one liquor store across town and make that the only place you can buy alcohol from . 
  and you ca n't take it with you either , you have to go there to get and drink your drink . 
  and you have to walk there . 
  soon your brain will be rewired so it 's just not bloody worth the walk to go get the drink .
