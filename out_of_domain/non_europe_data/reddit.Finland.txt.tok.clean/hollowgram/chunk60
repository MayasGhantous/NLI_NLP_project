  nsfw , i suppose . 
  that song by lupe critiqued the state of mainstream rap and its effects on younger minds , wrong track to diss bro . 
  umm hsbc story has been big news since it broke two weeks or so ago . 
  if the verses on the song appear dumb to you , i think you 're a close-minded individual who can not appreciate other artists work . 
  you do n't need to like rap or lupe to see the great feat he pulls off with those 48 bars . 
  reflections , material properties ... a lot of awesome cgi is with black but they utilize shades . 
  prevent it from operating in tge us because they aided the enemy ? 
  i di n't know , but the slap on the wrist they got goes against a lot of what this so-called war on terror is supposed to be . 
  but whatever , i was just providing a requested citation . 
  or grails . 
  or a handful of other language objects . 
  there 's this oldschool thing you may have heard of , it 's called personal memories , 
  i ca n't imagine this is shocking to anyone . 
  newer models after iphone 4 and ipad 2 had a dedicated noise-reduction chip to improve clarity . 
  still not enough reason imo but i think that 's the reason for apple giving it in ipad mini and not ipad 2 . 
  along with making that cash . 
  honestly curious : why would n't the large sums of money being printed by the fed * not * cause inflation once they start entering the market ? 
  that analogy to crusaders is ridiculous . 
  well , the app bar only surfaces from a swipe gesture , but imo one of the big hurdles of `` metro '' is , as you pointed out , poor use of space to give room to the content that matters . 
  it 's even more maddening on the windows phone platform where titles might take up even 40 % of the screen real estate , 10 % goes to the app bar with actual action buttons and all you have are three items of content . 
  [ example ] ( http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1651891/windows-phone-8-review-403-555.jpg ) . 
  as a ui/ux designer , working on windows 8 projects is a lot of fun , because there 's the consistency across the board , but at times frustrating , because you 're unable to show that much content to the user or really let the branding shine . 
  apple tv airplay mirroring would get this on the tv . 
  or am i not understanding the commment ? 
  if you have no music playing and no track `` paused '' , it will appear as it does for op .

  having wifi bars is as reliable of an indicator of an internet connection as a wallet is for having money . 
  doing defrag ( only possible with 3rd party apps ) can wreck your disk and render files inaccessible/corrupt . 
  please do n't do it . 
  best option is to back up , format , partition in disk utility via external boot ( with installation disc/mount ) and then re-install and restore . 
  wow . 
  windows has a different file system . 
  symbolic links in hfs + can be broken with defragging which will render your file system corrupt . 
  i do n't have a source handy and google yields product offers and diy articles . 
  do it if you want , but consider yourself warned . 
  it seems some have had successes itt but i would recommend against it , just reinstall to partition and it will `` defrag '' upon restore . 
  burpees , bw squats , normal pushups ... no excuses !,

  actually the chloride in water would denature the acid from what i 've heard . 
  finland has suffered from numerous school shootings as well as people using guns to harm others . 
  but i tend to agree with you , however to own a gun in finland you ( to my understanding ) need to be part of a hunting organization or have another legitimate reason to purchase a rifle . 
  in the us , judging from atf youtube videos , in the us you can walk into a gun store intoxicated and walk out with a semi-auto . 
  so imo it 's both gun control and gun culture . 
  not to mention general well-being of the society at large . 
  in all honesty , that just makes it worse .

  jasmine removed background play with an update due to yt 's request . 
  the yt app to my knowledge never had background play . 
  going to soundcloud.com in safari allowed background music though , as well as some other apps i have . 
  i think that 's a taser ... 
  edit : news interview shows he does have a glock as well as a taser .

  [ how about an article from the economist ? 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/13279051 ) if you search on google `` death penalty more expensive '' you 'll get a lot of results to read from , but as / u/jet _ heller pointed out , there are so many factors involved in sanctioning and carrying out a death penalty that it 's clear how death penalties cost more . 
  was nice to watch it to the end . 
  but no subtitles :(, 
   if it bleeds i can kill it, 
  i saw many tanzanian/kenyan films while living for a year in tanzania . 
  low production , over-acting , trope-level music and ridiculous drama for the most part , but there were some gems that felt like they conveyed a story . 
  most of them just tried emulating something that simply does not exist . 
  iphones have had tether since iphone 4 . 
  at least there 's a lot of parking space for disabled people !, 
  the more water is used in finland , the land of a thousand lakes , the better . 
  we have ample water and the water pipes have been made too big , as they are n't utilized in the volumes they were designed for . 
  low water levels expose the metal to oxygen and moisture = rust . 
  it 's the most studied food additive in human history and it 's been in the market for over 30 years . 
  i 'd say the evidence shows it 's safe to consume .

  well , to be fair , the daughter was pretty messed up . 
  what 's more technologically viable in the near future - scaling current tech into larger spaces or creating new tech and cram everything into the space of a contact lens ?

  the only logical conclusion is that australians either pirate more or do not produce as many customers to deserve the higher price .

  `` holy shit '' summarizes it quite well . 
   they even gave the agents a sample of their syrup to take home and enjoy .

  it 's a ** compilation **, 
  aside from timing , also helps build a sense of rhythm and co-ordination , and helps train you not to flinch .
