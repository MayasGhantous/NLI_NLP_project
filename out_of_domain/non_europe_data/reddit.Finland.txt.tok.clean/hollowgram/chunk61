  pretty braindead , but you 'd also have to be to not see the design similarities to the iphone 5 . 
  edit : [ photoshop comparison mockup ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zlhbzsj.jpg ) and to clarify , i 'm talking about taking the backplate of the iphone and modeling the entire htc one design around its concept . 
  [ ok here , i quickly made a mock-up in photoshop ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zlhbzsj.jpg ) . 
  first the iphone , then the htc one , then the iphone 5 horizontally flipped and overlayed on top of the htc one with 50 % opacity . 
  separately and superimposed ? 
  to my knowledge prior to the iphone 5 no phones carried this type of design . 
  i 'm not saying that htc was in the wrong , but i 'm asking whether it 's just me in seeing design similarities .

  can we make this into an after effects/premiere plugin ? 
  travel and daily meditation are good ideas .

  people are talking about the company though , it has accomplished something . 
  apple wireless keyboard and trackpad .

  thanks for the breakdown !, 
  my stats are n't too impressive , i squat 100 kg 1rm , dl about the same , bench 80 kg . 
  pull ups and chin ups hit different muscles , doing them on on monday just activates some arm regions that do n't get worked on that day and squeeze a bit more out of the ones that have .

   nitrous oxide inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin b12 by oxidation . 
  symptoms of vitamin b12 deficiency , including sensory neuropathy , myelopathy , and encephalopathy , can occur within days or weeks of exposure to nitrous oxide anesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin b12 deficiency . 
  [ citation needed ] symptoms are treated with high doses of vitamin b12 , but recovery can be slow and incomplete . 
  [ 75 ] people with normal vitamin b12 levels have stores to make the effects of nitrous oxide insignificant , unless exposure is repeated and prolonged ( nitrous oxide abuse ) . 
  [ citation needed ] vitamin b12 levels should be checked in people with risk factors for vitamin b12 deficiency prior to using nitrous oxide anesthesia .

  did n't accepting a solar-centric view of our solar system herald the rise of the scientific method and all advances that followed ?

  many products would be more durable and environmentally solid ( e.g.

  it 's silly to think he does n't have his own agenda .

  even more peculiar is that [ in the other ads ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mnq8ekwxj0 ) they show a smartphone type device for checking in on your home while you 're away and a smartwatch for phone calls and laptops with videoconferencing but think people would use phone booths to call home and video chat .

  from my experiences living in finland , it would seem that co-operation is good ( treating them like humans ) and there are no rights to protect - if the cops want to enter your property to search for something , they have every right to do so . 
  the current prison system in america is as fucked as you could make it if you tried and is run for-profit as modern day slavery ( the fourteenth amendment excludes prisoners from slave-like labor ) and does nothing to bring justice or rehabilitation to those in the system .
