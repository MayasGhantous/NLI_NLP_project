  it 's a waste of human potential tbh and no matter what , no one leaves unharmed or better equipped for nothing more than that type of life . 
  [ quick google ] ( http://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/walletoystoryfake.jpg ), 
  here 's sflogicninja 's [ great explanation ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtx_grdvcug ) . 
  came for the gif , was not disappointed . 
  are the current imacs even repairable ? 
  the glass is glued to the aluminum frame . 
  protein calories take more energy to metabolize than carbohydrates or fat calories , so a calorie is not just a calorie , although it 's an important rule of thumb . 
  it 's like a living painting . 
  in 2-5 years high-quality camera sensors and lenses will be so saturated that building a `` camera bar '' that will even do 4k at 1000 fps will be feasable , as most likely storage will also continue to expand in size . 
  the future is awesome !, 
  wow . 
  some strangers baby . 
  that was excruciatingly bad . 
  [ here 's another one with john malkovich ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=mh4trthlrpi ), 
  hjallis harkimo is a finnish businessman and sportsperson . 
  he is the chairman of the board of the helsinki-based ice-hockey team jokerit . 
  he is also the developer of the team 's home arena , hartwall areena , and an investor in sports . 
  harkimo has also hosted finnish version of the apprentice in 2009 and 2010 . 
  your video is 30 seconds whereas my link 2:36 ... would be nice to have the whole thing in better quality , 
  a lineage of royal gimps ... 
  i remember seeing this many years ago . 
  it is/was ( no more official website ? ), 
  a startup from south africa . 
  had a lot of potential , i even contacted their sales to seek distributing them when i was in tanzania , but they had n't been able to scale to market then ( 2011 ) . 
  now it looks like there 's nothing left of them except videos and a great idea . 
  their history was foretold in their name . 
  a really nice song with a mesh of 80 's dance and modern rhythms , music video reminded me of the dala dala 's in tanzania . 
  that was refreshingly well made and enjoyable . 
  camera lenses are a gateway to the internals , light passes through the optics onto the sensor . 
  glass does not stop emp . 
  [ here is the scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mtayu2_uilq#t=1620s ) for the lazy . 
  i dunno , saw [ this test on youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq2u6bbapik ) done by university of washington where the umbrella withstands wind going at 71 mph . 
  thought of space balls as well , 
  [ 13 years ago ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ryldzbuzco ), 
  make your own version , upload to cafepress , purchase ? 
  under the bridge ? 
  californication ? 
  i think you meant * threat * not * treat * . 
  uhh ... 
  i think ? 
  no , it 's to give us the best bullshit out there as soon as the bullshit happens . 
  it is :p, 
  triple tap app bar to quickly switch . 
  and if you 're not from the states , use [ proxmate ] ( http://proxmate.dave.cx/ ) . 
  come back after puberty . 
  so from my guess this is a programmed 3d project that runs in real time . 
  some of those can fit into ridiculous sizes , like 4 kb . 
  solid work , keep at it !, 
  january : /, 
  if it 's a hobby , would n't an app be more suitable ? 
  odd no one has mentioned **[appleinsider.com ] ( http://www.appleinsider.com ) ** , very little editorials , usually breaks news before others . 
  hypochondria is the word you 're looking for , 
  it 's a cow for crying out loud , not a tiger . 
  a total waste . 
  that pot page did n't seem to list any other effects than ` intoxication ', 
  goes to show how harmless pot is . 
  one brownie would be enough for a full sized adult , here 's a dog that probably weighs 1/18 of an adult and consumed a 12x dose and all it 's doing is drooling and having betw concerned about the chocolate it ate . 
  try that with any other substance !, 
  as the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light in every direction , it would be safe to say there is no true center point in the universe . 
  therefore , it is n't out of the scope of truth that anyone or any point on earth can be considered , in a way , a center of the universe . 
  inline via res it was some song lyrics video , but clicking the link went to the proper video . 
  they should really go after those nasty borrowers . 
  `` you would n't borrow your wife ... '', 
  it makes sense . 
  the father 's presence in the states is extremely dangerous , he 's wanted by feds . 
  no way he would have met her in ins holding . 
  possibly , he had to stand a hissy fit from his daughter and he happened to be in town . 
  jimmy could possibly come back a year ( or two ) later ( what was the gap between s2-s3 ? ), 
  after doing what needed to be done to get the wife all the permits she needs ( and possibly gone through med school ) . 
  because apple was afraid phones would evolve good mp3 functionality and erode market share for the ipod , so why not do it yourself and evolve phones ? 
  it would have to be this syntax :, 
  < p  text < / p , 
  * could be any element , not just div, 
  so basically it would have to be a < p  tag nested within two elements and even then , what would happen ? 
  more/less line-height and a margin . 
  thoughtfully choose your image host , eh ? 
  [ tampons were originally invented to stop the bleeding from bullet wounds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tampon#history ) . 
  the implications of what this could mean for biological sciences is staggering . 
  odd , in swahili * fulani * means * something * . 
  how is that better for cholesterol ? 
  when i was younger i had ingrown toenails for two years or so . 
  loved playing soccer , had to walk home from school every now and then . 
  everything was pain . 
  my socks would have yellow puss drying them to my toes with an odd smell i remember to this day . 
  every now and then the pain would be so unbearable i 'd self-operate trying to alleviate the nail that was growing through my skin and into the fat and flesh beneath . 
  i could n't do much except to temporarily alleviate the pain , but it always came back and worse . 
  my toes were nearly double their normal size . 
  we went to the hospital after some months but they operated one per year ( i think the justifications were to not keep me bedridden or hamper my childhood activities further ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure they did the vandenbos procedure ( if faint of heart , do not google ) and i had to replace the gauze and dressing for some time ( a month or two iirc ) , but it was such a relief to not feel pain . 
  nowadays my toes are fine , aside from one of them having a [ slightly split nail ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zdwvq9f.jpg ) , which i do n't mind as it reminds me of the haunting years i had to endure that i feel robbed me of memories but gave me a steel spine and determination to persevere through the worst -- it will get better .

  no more merry-go-rounds left ? 
  my heart . 
  it 's * some thing * ( object , concept ) at its essence , depending what you use it in relation with . 
  in english we have `` other '' as an example , it refers to what other ? 
  other person , other time or other meaning ?
