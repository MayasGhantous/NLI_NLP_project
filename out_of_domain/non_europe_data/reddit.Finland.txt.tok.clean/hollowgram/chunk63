  imo it 's a concept that would be worth pursuing . 
  everything is possible with planning and determination , 
  you shall not download free alternatives !, 
  promising thing , but :, 
  1 ) ca n't access your files from other computers, 
  2 ) adding external hdd 's to your backup repertoire can be a hassle if not all are connected constantly ( i never was sure if they were backing up ) . 
  3 ) for me , after a few months ( might have been my shitty computer ) it did n't manage to connect to crashplan servers anymore, 
  4 ) after changing computers , i would have had to buy a new license to continue using their service . 
  at least i got some of my money back , 
  give up your personal aspirations to further that of the common good , duh !, 
  trust me , the weather is reliably predictable only 1-2 days ahead here in finland . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm reading this correctly . 
  are you saying there is a way of getting the 10 minute option ? 
  * hides head in shame *, 
  what 's the hold up though ? 
  evernote api 's might have changed but apps still use it . 
  all norway needs is to change all the * private * lights and the problem would * vanish !, 
  this is true . 
  still requires them to have ** a lot ** of crazy backend code to make everything run smoothly . 
  they have something like 200 versions of each movie/episode in various resolutions and playback qualities to maximize performance and quality depending on the current bandwidth situation . 
  the aws api was a off-shoot of amazon choosing to make each division of amazon only able to communicate to other divisions via api 's . 
  it cost them a lot of money but the end result was an api that works fantastically . 
  so everyone gets a lot of value by choosing good cloud solutions because they take care of the most labor-intensive stuff for you . 
  this is my understanding , i am not a developer nor programmer but a designer who dips into technical stuff to better understand my work .

  rest is history . 
  the least you could do is share hair !, 
   people need to remember that when you have amnesia, 
  do you see what you did there ? 
  in that case you might know the device she 's using , the [ tc-helion voicelive touch ] ( http://www.tc-helicon.com/voicelive-touch-2-some-things-to-know/ ) , which allows real-time looping , harmony and auto-tune effects . 
  i 'm not saying you 're necessarily wrong , and i 'm sure it 's been post-processed , but the hardware she uses ( and perhaps additional hardware we do n't see ) does address the points you raise . 
  ** edit ** so point by point :, 
  plosions only come when directed towards the mic . 
  you can see she rarely projects directly into the mic . 
  low gain/noise gate as you suggested would cover this . 
  see video of voicelive touch in action . 
  it can create multi-octave harmonies on the fly . 
  do something you are passionate about with the new time you have . 
  what type of icon does you app have ? 
  all i have are 1000px previews , good enough for small portions in a photo book but not full-size as they deserve . 
  i use it as motivation to go through the other 4,000 photos and find new prime shots . 
  export versions for files you 've edited , masters for rest . 
  googling will yield many articles dedicated to this . 
  i 've searched the package contents and no trace was found of the file name . 
  i learned the hard way :p, 
  worst was that i did n't notice it until my ( then ) single backup had been replaced with the library file missing the photos . 
  around january 2012 is when the corruption happened ( found no missing masters past this point ) and i 've switched computers . 
  if they 're not magically hidden in the aperture library somewhere , they 're gone for good :(, 
  no i noticed they were missing before getting a new computer . 
  all files have always been in aperture library and i have n't touched organization settings . 
  thanks for the help tho . 
  i appreciate your help , and i did n't say it removed them from the flash card . 
  it removed them from the library ( folder remains with 0 items ) . 
  i 'm not doubting what you say , but i am telling you that 100 % i did not manually delete the masters from within the library . 
  [ here is a screenshot of what aperture shows ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dmjc8pf.png ) . 
  i is unable to locate the files and i am unable to locate them within the library . 
  the chronological img_xxxx is broken where the files are missing and it still breaks my heart and nothing you say of how it is supposed to be will replace those photos . 
  so take my word for it that they are gone , i have searched long and hard for them . 
  aperture destroyed them and although i was stupid for not having several backups since the beginning it does n't take away the fact that aperture , although sweet in its interface and promise , does n't deliver for me what i am looking for . 
  maybe you 'll finally get some sleep, 
  back when i boxed , they said that if you train bench , at the end , to throw the bar in the air and catch it for a few sets of ten , and shadowboxing , to counteract sluggishness . 
  the tools that advance mediocracy also enable independent creativity . 
  removed pretty quick . 
  i never had a problem with it ( just the bar , and not too far from your grip ) , but of course bad things can happen . 
  clapping push ups are always good , always part of boxing circuit training ( as far as i know ) .

  because building structures to withstand ocean forces is easy and 3 % of the worlds oceans is only larger than the land mass of the us .

  copy paste xommsnd line and relaunch finder ? 
  you 're really taking this first world problem thing a bit too far , 
  i 've never been too big on games , but that shit had me hooked like heroin . 
  so immersive . 
  what a waste of time !, 
  you 're assuming the local police force/fbi/cia would have a direct line to query apple 's fingerprint database ( assuming there even would be one , there 's no need for a fingerprint authentication to be decipherable by apple , e.g. 
  public/private keys a la ssh ) , which does n't make much sense . 
  even teleoperators , who are notoriously co-operative with law enforcement , do not have an effect on how much illegal activity is co-ordinated via cell phones . 
  the point i was trying to make is that for fingerprint authentication , apple does n't need a copy of your fingerprint on their servers to make authentication work , and from a security perspective it 's better for them to not retain a copy -- were such a db ever be compromised it would be a pr disaster . 
  [ this scene from * a bugs life * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41bp__mehr4 ) sums it up quite nicely . 
  edit : thanks for the correction . 
  instead of downvotes , why not raise some conversation ? 
  basically the concept portrayed is that if you give the ants more than what they barely need to get by , they might start thinking why do they need to submit to the will of the grasshoppers for . 
  a single ant is powerless against a grasshopper , but a swarm of them are a great force . 
  if hunger/poverty were to be eradicated ( we produce enough food on the planet to feed twice the population ) , we remove the power structures that exist and level the playing field to the extent that everything would change , scarcity would in some ways be abolished , and this is terrible for the short-term max-profit mentality of the markets today . 
  personally i believe things are more complicated than that , there are many forces trying to do good who are well organised and financed , but this is the viewpoint i have heard many times over . 
  damn that 's awesome !, 
  if someone could help me illustrate what each part is saying , i could make this into a visual design .
