  chill . 
  come join local meetups . 
  recovered comments :, 
   op 's comments , in chronological order : ( for context , i included comments from other redditors , they are in italics ) proof , i 'm working so more coming http://imgur.com/xxg0gh9 one more http://imgur.com/kvdq2pd `` we need source , pls '' uploaded my credentials for this show ok he ran into the dressing room saying hide me hide me . 
  police have taken his cars and passport . 
  his set may be cut short ran into catering tent first said `` they 're gon na arrest me they 're gon na arrest me . 
  staff had to bring him cold towels cause he was in such hysterics `` so just to clarify , you 're working at the venue he 's playing at right now ? '', 
  yes , working at dubai rugby sevens stadium for his may 5th second date also of note , one of his entourage was on stage in local dress acting like a chode and made all the locals and local authorities enraged ok so the rental car company that gave him the lambo is part of a sheikhs family , their mad as hell , took his passport and even if not arrested he may miss his next tour date more pics from venue `` i 'm monitoring this thread so please continue , it sounds hilarious !, 
  hopefully it picks up before there 's a news article , you really deserve credit for this insight '' it 's utter madness with this kid . 
  his whole touring crew despises him http://imgur.com/tohqygg `` on nights like this , do you ever consider that this job is n't worth the shit you have to deal with ? '', 
  on nights like this ... i 'm smiling from ear to ear `` please find weed , please find weed ... '' they are searching his cars in before the impounding them police waiting http://imgur.com/v6gptik `` submit this shit to tmz . '', 
  if he does indeed get arrested and i can get a pick i just may . 
  reddits my family `` hmm , this would be amusing if true . 
  i 'll remain skeptical for now , because apparently some people falsely claimed he was arrested in dubai yesterday . '', 
  yesterday was they day he ditched his police escort , he was swearing at the police when they caught him and a member of his entourage was arrested `` how are you getting all this info ? 
  you ca n't possibly be witnessing all this . 
  not that i do n't want this to be hilariously true . '', 
  i 'm in joc ( joint operations centre ) ok they have let him leave the venue but unsure if they have taken his passport or he 'll be able to leave the county . 
  sorry for the anti climactic end, 
  i think many women seem more womanly after pregnancy . 
  palestinians are semites , so supporting them is the opposite of antisemitism . 
  oops , forgot that logic is irrelevant . 
  i know . 
  just a shame one country can usurp a word like that . 
  it 's the same if finns claimed that when people speak against they government they are anti-slavic . 
  should be captainobvious.gif, 
   sound mixeresque, 
  ftfy, 
  run the alphabet for topics . 
  anything in the situation that starts with an a ? 
  keep goong until you find something and gonwith it . 
  `` do you accept ... pause ... cash ? '', 
  smile . 
  `` i 'll pay with card today '' deadpan . 
  share a laugh . 
  note , you will crash and burn hard many times , but without it you 'll never get anywhere . 
  take chances , have fun . 
  breathe . 
  not the kind of bike i was expecting :d, 
  uk and ireland only . 
  mirror ? 
  easy to set up when you 're sleeping with the directors wife . 
  his lungs must be epic . 
  with some quick searching , [ this is the effect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi9c9j0qgu4 ) i 'm trying to achieve . 
  i the slide to unlock patent was invalidated a few months back . 
  ( http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/german-court-finds-apples-slide-to-unlock-patent-invalid/ ), 
  wtf 1.5 miles ai n't shit , jog there and not only will you have warmed up , you 'll have completed half of your goal !, 
  i think saying `` i sleep a lot because my dreams are better than my real life '' is one way of saying `` i 'm lazy '', 
  you are now tagged as sgt. 
  in lime . 
  forever !, 
  thanks . 
  i had come across some sites mentioning reshape . 
  i think a combination of that , motion blur and camera z-plane zoom will do the trick . 
  if you look at the cliff below the rainbow , it 's much less blurred than everything else . 
  nothing suggests there would be a slope toward the camera . 
  could have been blurred out by the photographer ( just make a mask of the rocks below to keep them in focus ) . 
  still a great photo , the blur is overdone imo . 
  all those dance lessons , 
  [ the scene from true romance ] ( http://youtu.be/_svnsf5olbi ) . 
  sid i miss a theon scene in e08 ? 
  since this is most likely your tutorial ( nothing bad with trying to educate ) , next time start with showing the end product of what the tutorial will accomplish . 
  ** edit : ** apparently i missed it . 
  it 's at 00:35 . 
   to be fair , going after this stuff would be the most pointless move anyway . 
  and yet , [ look at what happened to tommy chong ] ( http://old.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030912chong0912p5.asp ) . 
  i am more than mildly infuriated by this . 
  same people who say they put them back to conserve nature ( wtf ? 
  it 's wood ! ), 
  are the same people who throw cigarette butts on the ground . 
  there is no good reason for putting them back into the matchbox . 
  limit the fury of people lighting things and do n't put them back . 
  [ jazza is an awesome guy ] ( http://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/creator-resources/tutorials/art-tutorials ) for video tutorials . 
  i recommend picking up `` drawing with the right side of the brain '' and `` figure drawing for all its worth '' , amazing information in them . 
  anything by andrew loomis is mind-boggling . 
  width and margin values like that imply there 's some js calculating the values . 
  i load up the map area in apple maps i want to use on my iphone , and then i can see my location based on cell tower triangulation . 
  not sure how this would work on a 3g/lte ipad though . 
  yup , i was just clarifying for those who might not have seen it . 
  pouring ( more like `` slamming '' ) water from a bucket up high can sometimes get the job done . 
  swiping with four fingers between open apps is pretty darn close to multitasking for me . 
  seriously , [ bravo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6umzhdz.gif ) with the analysis . 
  don is someone who can not enjoy ordinary life , as you said he seeks the ideal . 
  having control over his circumstance seems paramount to his ego , and when it 's threatened he throws chaos in the mix with rash actions . 
  in the end , it ca n't go on forever . 
  something 's got ta give sooner or later . 
  not always . 
  especially with info-based apps ( web and note-taking centric tasks that require multitasking ) can co-exist in the ram and have switching between them without having to wait for a reload . 
  confrontation starts at ** 1:30 **, 
  i also have two distinct memories before age 3 of which one has been confirmed . 
  all major social apps , music production/instruments , drawing/photo-editing , games ... are you seriously asking ? 
  not for a * tablet * experience . 
  betty and megan fucked ted ? 
  not playable from outside the us :(, 
  gorillaz if you want a big name . 
  i dabble with garageband and propellarhead 's stuff ( and a little rockmate with friends ) on the ipad . 
  some use it much more seriously , and why not ? 
  a tablet can be a versatile music station . 
  pete rock - petestrumentals should definitely be on the instrumentals list . 
  also , pete rock and cl smooth - mecca and the soul brother has some serious classics .
