  in all seriousness , big got ta be on that list . 
  college dropout changed the game a lot too , maybe put that where lupe fiasco is repeated ( you have food & liquor twice on the grid ) . 
  spend $ 100,000 making a native app with iap . 
  i think it was an intentional swap . 
  hey , this worked !, 
  i was unable to find the restart option and pulling out the power cable did n't do the trick , but selecting restart from settings -  general ( at the bottom ) did it . 
  now if only the fps would be 30 ... 
  thy will , but i doubt music or ebooks will be options for a loooong time . 
  mirror ? 
  what is this ? 
  if you think it is . 
  many old people have excelled in skills developed later in life , but a key ingredient is believing you can and pursuing those 10,000 hours it takes to become a master at something . 
  the first movie had no real script and many scenes were adlibbed . 
  the character and rdj 's personality fused . 
  googling `` iron man no script '' pulled [ this as the first result ] ( http://io9.com/5417310/jeff-bridges-admits-iron-man-movie-had-no-script ) . 
  look at that lag !, 
  are they midi versions or licensed songs ? 
  the version of power in the video was some alt version . 
  would be wicked if the tracks were remade for this game and we could get our hands on the tracks ... 
  ** edit : ** if you want something done right , ya got ta do it yourself . 
  [ here is the background music of the 0.3 version ] ( https://mega.co.nz/#!cruivcxz!g221is5guhihaapoazzxut17elxrmjthvrdhsl2mpgu ) via megaupload . 
  some are made for the game , others are instrumentals . 
  lengths vary from 5 minutes to 9 seconds .

  if you have an ios device , alien blue is awesome . 
  one of its features is showing pages in ` optimal ' view that also makes all videos play on mobile . 
  even if you have another os , there should be some app to sort that out for you . 
  [ extracted and shared the background music from the game ] ( https://mega.co.nz/#!cruivcxz!g221is5guhihaapoazzxut17elxrmjthvrdhsl2mpgu ) . 
  the picture is a composite of 4 images stacked vertically , i believe that 's why it appears slightly squashed . 
  [ judging by this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ledyf4sghui ) , several have been on their knees but none on their asses . 
  uhh , me or the church ? 
  yes to both actually , 
  i did , but due to all the cars and renovations going on with kazansky sabor i did n't manage any proper shots . 
  visiting the amazing petergof will be another trip , 
  awesome !, 
  thanks for the tip . 
  clean recordings come from level , position and acoustics . 
  [ but apparently it is a product ] ( http://www.amazon.com/beats-detox-edition-headphone-monster/dp/b004w1exyc ), 
  this is / r/web _ design !, 
  you can even see it in the terminology , it 's very much a game ( think : tennis ) . 
  games take place in/on a court , with a non-partial judge making sure both sides play by the rules . 
  they take turns serving and the outcome is ruled in favor of one party . 
  a + + would agree again . 
  if i appear asleep , just shake me . 
  i 'm always dtf . 
  that 's a wonderful etymology dictionary , thanks for the tip !, 
  i had forgotten about it , but serious sam was a kick-ass game back in the day . 
  glad to see y' all still making games even though i 'm not playing fps ' anymore , 
  i dunno , if you have three dragons it might help . 
  ... because you 've used them both ? 
  bravo john !, 
   beyond desolation, 
  would have thought they would have saved that for the third instalment . 
  [ yep !,

  as far as developer api 's and os security go , ios is ahead of the pack . 
  plug into power , home and power held down until you see the apple logo . 
  exactly what i 'm looking for . 
  i just do n't program php :(, 
  ... motherfucker, 
  so you do n't shower or clean because it 'll get messy later anyway ? 
  i 'd love to see your cooking :d, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm pretty proficient in html/css and although i 've been working with wordpress for many years , sometimes these if/else clauses can be hard to pin down . 
  the codex is definitely a trove , but it can be daunting to try and create a php declaration by yourself . 
  you 've definitely set me on the right track , so thanks a lot for this !, 
  that interview knocked it out of the park !, 
  awesome !, 
  rapgodfathers * cough *, 
  crazy album !, 
  how are expensive gadgets and minimalism related ? 
  do come to / r/wearethemusicmakers, 
  hey !, 
  i have the same iphone case as that guy !, 
  [ i liked this so much i had to give it a better visual layout ] ( http://i.imgur.com/itqvck0.png ) . 
  i ca n't help but think the status quo plays into this as well . 
  who would n't buy an issue with `` prism : 10 ways this affects you '' or something similar . 
  no , it 's character assassination time . 
  you really screwed the pooch on this one , serendipitybot . 
  we can not understand the association of the color green with the concept of `` enabled '' without historical context !, 
  what if the grooves in the cork are caused by the grooves in the glass , i.e. 
  the cork itself is not pre-molded in any way ? 
  lifeprotip : if you do n't understand something , google the concepts/words you do n't get . 
  well [ googling rolling shutter ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=rolling+shutter&amp;oq=rolling+shutter&amp;aqs=chrome.0.59j0l3j60j62.1320j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) gives you [ the wikipedia entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolling_shutter ) of rolling shutter , [ the second photo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lightning_rolling_shutter.jpg ) showing the same phenomena as in op 's photo and a straightforward explanation :, 
   rolling shutter is a method of image acquisition in which each frame is recorded not from a snapshot of a single point in time , but rather by scanning across the frame either vertically or horizontally . 
  in other words , not all parts of the image are recorded at exactly the same time , even though the whole frame is displayed at the same time during playback . 
  this produces predictable distortions of fast-moving objects or when the sensor captures rapid flashes of light . 
  this is in contrast with global shutter in which the entire frame is exposed for the same time window . 
  i 'm sure you 're not dumb , or clueless , 
  you have made a terrible mistake !, 
  yes , protect the worlds toughest glass with a film of plastic . 
  he has no contract . 
  he felt for ted . 
  you 'll get more progress faster doing squats and benches with just the barbell ( and progressively loading it as you feel safe ) than merely doing cardio . 
  cardio is good , it gets a bad rap at / r/fitness , but definitely do it after some power lifts that utilizes your cns and forces your body to exert itself . 
  express and connect . 
  there really is n't a real competitor to this product . 
  the h4n has been the go-to for videographers for years , and zoom really upped the game with the h6 . 
  [ tascam ] ( http://tascam.com/applications/recording/handheld_recorder/ ) is one manufacturer that offers competing products to the h1 to h4 line , but the h6 is new and i must say , awesome . 
  but unless you 're * really * serious about investing in a solution that will last you for a long time and can expand , there is no reason to spend $ 399 on a recorder .
