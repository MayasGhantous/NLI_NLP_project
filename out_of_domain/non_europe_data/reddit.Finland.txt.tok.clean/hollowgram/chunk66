  ** example setup : ** the h1 is a great recorder , it 's light and attaches directly to your dslr shoe and costs $ 99 . 
  a decent lavalier mic is $ 30 and a pocket digital recorder like the sony icd-px333 is $ 50 ( or just plug it to a smartphone and use a lossless recorder app ) and is great for most conversational recordings . 
  so an h1 + two lavaliers + two recorders = ** ~ $ 269 ** and you have three mic systems , your go-to being the h1 . 
  if you wanted a shotgun option , a rode video mic would set you back $ 80 - $ 100 ( price for h6 modular attachment unknown ) . 
  if you want to use the h6 for lavalier systems you 'll need wireless transmitters , which can be * super * expensive ( easily $ 1000 ) . 
  so in short , the h6 is an awesome step forward but for most an overkill , it 's an investment so be sure you really need it . 
  every dollar invested in your equipment should help you accomplish things and move you forward , not merely have the latest or best for the sake of it . 
  sell sell, 
  i have n't used a mouse in 3 years ( macbook pro trackpad and magic trackpad for imac ) . 
  source : i do graphics design , videography and music production professionally . 
  definitely a case of `` pick the tool that helps you get things done best '' but i just wanted to chime in to show that a mouse is not a necessity to do pixel-perfect work .

  man , was that an awesome interview or what ? 
  so much information , would be awesome if someone would transcribe the facts raised . 
  jon stewart would n't have ever left his guest hanging like that though , john was feeling the weight of the interview to address key points . 
  i suppose i 'll try to find time to transcribe the interview if no one else does , but i 'm * hella * busy . 
  tried www.forecast.io ? 
  i 'm in stitches . 
  that kid probably was enjoying his cake like its the last slice on earth and then suddenly everything went black . 
  it actually takes significantly more battery life to keep turning the radio on and off . 
  i 'm wondering more about the multitasking . 
  well the issue with multitasking has always been , many apps sucking away at battery life . 
  now they say there 's `` true '' multitasking and with great battery life , and i wonder how they 're pulling that off . 
  out of curiosity , what new features do you use that you do not get with the iphone ? 
  every camera produces flares when you point them at the sun and the issue was made way bigger than it actually is ( surveys show people prefer the iphone camera ) . 
   i ca n't think of anything new that works well that apple has brought to the table in a long time . 
  perhaps i just misunderstood that . 
  but i get your point , a lot of people enjoy a dashboard home screen with widgets/livetiles/what-have-you to display the info they want to see . 
  heh , made a list of pro apps i use and then read the description :d my timesavers are :, 
  - littleipsum ( quickly get filler text for designs , from one word to several paragraphs with a click of a button ), 
  - jumpcut ( clipboard history , huge timesaver ), 
  - jitouch ( for three-finger tap to open new tab ), 
  - logmein ( great if i 'm away and forgot to do something on the computer , mostly moving files to dropbox ), 
  - beamer ( drag and drop anything to play on my appletv ), 
  spotlight does both . 
  hit cmd + space ( some eu keyboards i 've seen ctrl + space ), 
  type mood . 
  you 'll see at the bottom * look up * mood . 
  hovering over the entry shows you its dictionary entry . 
  type your song name . 
  hit enter . 
  song starts playing in itunes . 
  i 'm not against using 3rd party tools , and some people love making it just right for them , but still , i 've yet to see what alfred/other launchers can do that spotlight can not . 
  +1 to you good sir . 
  neat , thanks for showing me something new ,

  in the states , any people have periods of homelessness because of the small social safety nets that exist , e.g. 
  kicked out of apartment for inability to pay bills after a hospital visit . 
  `` by their own decision '' is such a sweeping generalization its only purpose can be to make you sleep better at night , 
  thankfully my finnish passport will allow entry  sorry to hear you were n't able to enter !, 
  they have backup machines . 
  also , most likely they are using custom builds that make absolutely sure that the features demoed work as intended . 
  confidence and congruity .

  graham hancock is full of bullshit , misrepresenting facts about history to try and argue aliens built the pyramids . 
  that was a strange interview . 
  how about [ his official website ? 
  ] ( http://www.grahamhancock.com/archive/supernatural/article_02.html ), 
  ok , i might have mixed him up with david icke and the lot , but he does claim that there was an ancient civilization responsible for building pyramids around the world that align exactly with stars and that these buildings are much older than what archeologists tell us . 
  he 's most known for his book * fingerprints of the gods * and his `` documentary '' [ quest for the lost civilization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5dnvymtkyk ) .

   the economic consequences are hard to predict . 
  economists historically frowned on minimum wages as distortionary price fixing that reduced demand for workers affected by the wage . 
  but that assumption has come under fire from a growing body of research . 
  i can only imagine how liam felt going to commercial . 
  too funny !,

  from all accounts ( john lasseter accepting the disney award for him to name a recent example i came across , as well as his biography ) , this changed with time . 
  his experience of being ousted out of apple and running next changed him to be less of a jerk .
