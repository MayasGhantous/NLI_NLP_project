  they had planned to get married in may in the philippines and get everything in motion , with venue reservations etc. 
  already done . 
  when hurricane haiyan hit , houssam had no means of contacting grace and her family . 
  he faintly heard through a terrible phone connection that something bad had happened , but he did not know how bad nor where she was . 
  after that , he was unable to get any further contact so he decided he had to travel to the philippines to find her and give her any help he could . 
  he took a leave from work and flew out as soon as he could and found her four days later in an absolutely putrid clinic where she was stitched horribly and not receiving the medical attention she needed . 
  after pleading with the coast guard lieutenant in charge , he got assistance to board a boat ( as all ticket vendors claimed there were no spots to sell ) and got her to a hospital . 
  he 's spent over $ 3000 in bills so far and they keep finding new injuries on grace that require operations . 
  this has been very stressful for houssam and grace , but also for us as his friends , as we have sent the money we have been able to send but i for one feel very powerless in what i can further do . 
  i 'm trying to reach out to the good people on reddit and networks in facebook but i do n't know if it 'll be enough . 
  any advice on getting more awareness is very much appreciated , sharing and considering even a small donation would be of great assistance . 
  thank you / u/wreckoning for helping spread the word . 
  ** edit : ** [ follow up video ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1r5zo3/operation_saving_grace_video_update_thank_you/ ) posted . 
  chong hua hospital in cebu , philippines . 
  thank you . 
  he has been planning her move to canada for some time , but i will pass these words to him . 
  it was unfortunate that grace was in ormoc when the hurricane hit , it really devastated the entire island . 
  glad to hear your fiancee was safe !, 
  hello , i am helping coordinate communications between houssam and grace to the outside world to try and get them help with donations ( which is working and i am extremely grateful for the show of support , i will update our progress on tumblr as things progress ) . 
  i would be more than happy to offer any further proof of validity that i can . 
  i 'm putting all the material houssam posts on his facebook to the tumblr page ( on the side bar of the page there are links to press interviews of houssam as he was preparing to leave ) . 
  i want to thank everyone for their help , before this i was feeling very powerless but i 'm a little relieved to see that people care for my friend and his fianc\u00e9e . 
  if you knew the troubles houssam has faced in his life you would be dazed , he is a strong force of good who keeps facing a lot of trials . 
  it can not be put into words how much this means to him , grace and me .

  ** edit # 2 : ** [ here is a note houssam made ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dozvu ) , hope that is valid proof . 
  we have uploaded [ new bills ] ( http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com ) on our tumblr page that he has managed to pay because of help from reddit . 
  thank you again everyone for helping spread awareness and donating !, 
  this is the guy who used to sign his work as `` reduced by rick rubin '', 
  driving on the coast of spain with no traffic at all , doing 140 km/h . 
  some mercedes appears from nowhere pulls up in front of me doing at least 180 , immediately changes lanes to be in front of me after passing . 
  i find it odd , but continue . 
  he slows so he 's not going much faster than me . 
  i look down for a second to reach for water , from the corner of my eye i find something is amiss . 
  i go into instinct mode , but what happened was that i looked up , saw he was emergency braking with emergency blinks on , slowly going off the road but still in front of me . 
  i quickly adjust the wheel to get out of his way but nearly oversteer , correcting immediately and preventing me from flying through the barrier and off the ledge into a huge drop into the mediterranian . 
  his filming style reflects his state of mind , quite beautiful . 
  this was in finland . 
  we had an ipod nano 2nd gen go missing around early winter at a communal house i used to live in . 
  after the snow melted we found it on the gravel driveway , we had at least one car go over it twice a day , each day . 
  although the screen did n't work , it powered up and even played music . 
  hello ,, 
  if you check the [ tumblr page ] ( http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com ) you can see updates as they come in . 
  thank you for your continuing interest !, 
  grace was seriously injured in the philippines when haiyan hit the region . 
  my good friend houssam travelled from canada to find her and get her the help she needs . 
  a couple days ago / u/wreckoning submitted the [ imgur album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bmly9 ) we created and it [ really took off ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1qz1h6/canadian_man_travels_to_philippines_to_find_his/ ) . 
  since then , we have been covered by buzzfeed , toronto sun , yahoo !, 
  news and other media outlets . 
  they have gotten over $ 10,000 cad in donations to help cover the huge medical bills that are coming in every day . 
  if any remaining funds remain , we will donate to doctors without borders who are active in the region ( unlike the red cross , info on that in the video ) . 
  links to press stories , photos of grace and bills incurred , the donation page and more updates at http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com, 
  thank you again , and look for our ama on saturday !, 
  noticed my mistake , video should work now . 
  i understand not everyone has 18 minutes to give to watch the video , so the major points are below :, 
  - grace is on the road to recovery . 
  her plight was covered by buzzfeed , yahoo !, 
  news , toronto sun , cjad and others because of the attention reddit brought to the story, 
  - the previous clinic was horrible , her ankle is destroyed and the stitching done by the clinic actually stitched on top of her tendon . 
  there is a severe bacterial infection that prevents fixing the tendons due to the fatal risk of the infection reaching the heart . 
  they are cultivating bacteria to figure out what strand is causing the infection in order to operate . 
  since her jaw is wired shut , her operation will be expensive as it requires a dental surgeon to loosen the wiring . 
  they will combine the operation with removal of a plate that was put to fix her broken wrist . 
  - grace 's spirit is much better , much in part because of the love you all have shown with your support, 
  - we have received around $ 10,000 cad in donations . 
  houssam has spent thousands already and just yesterday had to pay $ 1600 for her jaw operation . 
  doctor fees are only billed once grace will be discharged . 
  - if there is any money left over after everything , we will donate it forward to help other victims of haiyan . 
  - the red cross is only operating in the airport . 
  the only organisation houssam has seen on the field in ormoc is [ doctors without borders ] ( http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org ), 
  - poor communication has been a big problem , me and houssam have n't been able to communicate properly besides facebook messenger . 
  - because everyone probably has unanswered questions , we will organise a reddit ama on saturday . 
  due to the huge time differences ( me in finland , houssam in the philippines and most of you guys in north america ) it is hard to say what time we will start . 
  - a huge thank you to everyone, 
   really , the fundamental , ultimate mystery -- the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets -- is this : that for every outside there is an inside and for every inside there is an outside , and although they are different , they go together . 
  -- alan watts, 
  apologies for the top comment hijack , but i wanted to let everyone know grace is on her way to recovery thanks to the exposure from this submission . 
  [ we recently uploaded a video ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1r5zo3/operation_saving_grace_video_update_thank_you/ ) where we review the situation ( and start off with a thank you from grace ) . 
  all the best to everyone and a huge thank you from us for all the help !,
