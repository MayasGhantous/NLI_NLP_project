  yes but that increase in contrast is a downside if you 're doing video or photo editing and that portion you thought was absolute black to hide a wrinkle in your backdrop actually shows up on the clients matte monitor and they give you shit for not doing a proper job . 
  tl ; dr pro 's need at the very least a matte secondary monitor, 
  one of the best interviews in a while , a great episode !, 
  how is this relevant to / r/apple ? 
  i 'd say the only factor really is that they could n't produce enough fingerprint sensors to include it , i 'm sure it 'll be there next year .

  guaranteeing him ms has no interest in a gui os , getting advance access to the macintosh to develop ms office while secretly developing the first version of windows . 
  do or do n't , only you carry the burden either way . 
  could you recommend a good value microscope that isnt going to kill the wallet ? 
  get one refurbished/second hand ? 
  airs are a good option too depending on your needs . 
  she found this thread . 
  the xerox parc os had severe limitations that the macintosh team solved , such as overlapping windows ( and repainting content by itself rather than after clicking on the window to make it active again ) , a finder , drag and drop , etc. 
  something about this image screams 1993, 
  some atrocious stuff is available in tanzania when i was there , basically bleach for the skin . 
  ruins the beautiful skin the women there have , but many use it . 
  humans always want what they do n't have , remember that tans used to be unappealing because it meant you had to work outside to make a living , now it 's a sign that you can afford to travel to warm locations .

  this is ridiculous . 
  `` normal people are the strangers you have yet to meet '', 
  best to book there . 
  i lived in mwanza for 10 months while working there , did two treks to the serengeti but never used the tour packages . 
  what i can say is that there are charges from the park ( iirc ~ $ 100 usd per park ) that may or may not be included in the price quoted for the tour . 
  usually reputable operators will be very upfront about everything and want you to enjoy your stay , ** the fees are never low for professional safari tours ** . 
  arusha is the most tourist-centric city in tanzania , as it is close to the serengeti and kilimanjaro . 
  seek reputable companies with a long history , not a bad idea to ask advice from hotels . 
  finding groups you can join might be a good strategy as well . 
  [ here is tanzania tourist board 's ] ( http://tanzaniatouristboard.com/tour_search/index_tz.php ) list of registered tour operators , if that helps . 
  and it had the `` darn '' variation of \u0431\u043b\u0438\u043d , which comes from the food \u0431\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b .

  would require a native wrapper as to my understanding access to webcam is quite limited in html5 . 
  he sure did . 
  organize files into folders , evernote for everything else ( quick writing , snippets from the web , dictation , etc. 
  this is actually based on a [ scientifically-sound ] ( http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/ ) 7 minute workout template that 's quite popular nowadays . 
  broscience ftw , 
  it really depends on your goals and lifestyle . 
  most people do not move at all for fitness . 
  even if you go to the gym later in the day , one set of this would be a great start to a day and doing all three sets is a good conditioning workout for the average joe . 
  better to move than to not move imo . 
  this is a recommendation by measured experiments . 
  as a routine this is n't bad at all and if someone has * evidence * of how this study and i am wrong then please enlighten me . 
  i 'm sure there are other routines that work well ( bodyrock.tv has some great ones although i have n't visited nor used their routines in ages ) , but the main thing is to do * something * rather than nothing . 
  hahaha that image made my day  thanks . 
  listen , if you so this every day you 'll live a much more healthy life . 
  that is what this routine is about . 
  most people live a very immobile life and this causes severe health complications along the way . 
  so results in this case is living longer and healthier . 
   the coroner determined thomas died from brain damage and asphyxiation caused by the beating .

  from the article you linked :, 
   the 7-minute workout undeniably has some benefits . 
  in fact , i gave it a test drive and it raised my heart rate , and i 've been training consistently for more than 15 years . 
  to that end , there is nothing wrong with the workout , and it can be a great solution for anyone looking for a quick workout . 
  create a low-frequency sine wave and subchain it to your 808 kick so it gets triggered by the kick . 
  iirc logic 's ultrabeat has a hip hop kit with a ready-made 808 + sine kick in it . 
  it is my understanding that in british culture there is no such thing as `` too self deprecating '' .

  ok , from now on i 'm marking all internet sarcasm with / s , 
  those things age beautifully and can be resold for good value though . 
  the reason for that is because sweeteners/sugar alcohols draw water to the large intestine and are only partially digested .
