  might be me though . 
  fuck it man , if that 's what it takes to get in shape and put in the effort to appear as a 2.0 version of yourself , do it !, 
  are you using an xlr cable ? 
  one or two microphones ? 
  or a usb stereo microphone ? 
  assuming you have one microphone and you 're getting a stereo signal :, 
  record in stereo, 
  select audio, 
  press \u2325 \u2318 f ( [ or right click with audio selected and go convert -  convert to new audio files ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gp4yhue.png ) ), 
  select stereo conversion and `` interleaved to split '', 
  usually it 's your color that moves ( i.e. 
  which color pieces do you see at the bottom of the board from your perspective ) . 
  exactly , horribly written article that is absolutely useless . 
  has iap for machines . 
  once you make it , everything is fair . 
  you used youtube capture for a vertical video ? 
  that 's impressive in and of itself !, 
  i was feeling really eery about the whole grotesquely idyllic archetypes with only some having slight morphs in their face , i 'm thinking damn this is gon na get demented , i 'm kinda scared but kinda intrigued as to where they 'll take it . 
  then you see the `` mirror '' of anguish and things continue and you set into the groove , there wo n't be anything super scary most likely . 
  then some weird but funny stuff happens and it goes along . 
  in the end it was n't so bad and look , a parrot !, 
  fun tunes . 
  ** tl ; dr ** video is a trip, 
  for a while i thought this was from / r/upliftingnews, 
  you can get very good at answering sats and not being able to write essays that professors reward high marks to . 
  spoiled by opening credits ? 
  i can barely read half the discussion here without seeing what the previews had . 
  google music is free for 250,000 songs . 
  i 'm actually in finland , surprised it works here ( arrived ~ 2 weeks before itunes match support ), 
  they do their ads more professionally . 
  gopro does offer that intro video for free to download . 
  many people add it to try and give their video more prestige , others for the hell of it . 
  because humans are pack animals and we have a deep desire to look up to others . 
  in time this has morphed into celebrity gossip culture . 
  in the hospital, 
  that moment of zen ... 
  mute the video and pause the video where you need to . 
  or do n't watch it . 
  a great episode , jon was on fire especially with louis . 
  could watch them for an hour reminiscing . 
  just because something is natural or naturally occurring does n't mean it wo n't harm an ecosystem . 
  wipe your finger before trying , saw my success rate improve like crazy . 
  does more than wiping the sensor imo, 
  [ taken a few years ago with a 4s ] ( http://www.vitaligusatinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/img_04041.jpg ) , still consider it my best iphone photo . 
  yeah , sorry about that . 
  i was at work ( so no access to the original ) and my site auto-generates that pos . 
  gon na remove it when i get to redesigning my site . 
  flu helped . 
  also smoking as much as i wanted but always from a different pack , so i had reds , lights and menthol . 
  lots of coughing and nausea , conditioned my body to hate it . 
  no smoking for 2 years . 
  [ original / r/pics submission that started it all ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1qz1h6/canadian_man_travels_to_philippines_to_find_his/ ), 
  [ link to blog with press links and more images ] ( http://operationsavinggrace.tumblr.com ), 
  [ link to ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1raarn/we_are_vitali_and_houssam_of_operation_saving/ ), 
  with reddit 's help , this story was publicised around the world and allowed houssam and grace to get the financing for operations to help grace recover . 
  this would probably not have happened without the help of this amazing community . 
  if there is interest we are ready to do another ama to answer any questions people may have , although last time there was n't much asked . 
  and then goes to open keystone and ramps up natural gas , coal and other dirty energy sources . 
  [ this rs article is worth reading ] ( http://m.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obama-and-climate-change-the-real-story-20131217 ), 
  [ conspiracies do happen ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/true-government-conspiracies-2013-12 ) and [ large amounts of people can be part of a larger whole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manhattan_project ) without realizing what the ultimate goal is . 
  also let 's remember prism and mkultra . 
  i 'm not saying jfk is a valid conspiracy , but skepticism toward the official story ( especially one that is quickly presented after an incident ) should be encouraged . 
  no damage is done , this was from using davinci resolve , which requires a minimum of 1 gig of gpu to run without overloading . 
  i have less on my imac and this happens from time to time . 
  if you have 1 gig or more , you can always overload by opening other graphics-intensive apps ( i.e. 
  after effects , premiere , photoshop ) and get similar overloading . 
  i had choice paralysis when i used my free trial . 
  probably spent three hours in total trying to figure out what movie to watch and in the end i did n't watch any . 
  suga free !, 
  did n't know he was still around . 
  dope . 
  i. . . am i missing something ? 
  i thought this sub only accepted portaits , i.e. 
  people looking directly into the camera ? 
  imo this is a powerful photo that belongs but i 've had similar photos removed because they were not portrait-style and directed to post on / r/earthlingporn, 
  use logmein to remotely access your computer , it 's free . 
   fuck , seems it 's almost better to not do heroin, 
  ftfy, 
  they have pro versions that are mostly enterprise users , it 's been free for as long as they 've existed . 
  i do n't see that as a valid reason for why not to use the software that maybe some day you might have to stop using it or pay . 
  if remote access software was vulnerable then people and especially enterprises would not use them , but suit yourself , 
  very thorough definition , i actually do portrait photography myself ( i should actually submit some oc here ) . 
  [ this is the post that was removed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/humanporn/comments/1sy9wa/death_grips_performing_in_nyc_4332x3342/ ) , but it 's not important , lets keep posting , 
  woman next to her is wiping tears from laughter, 
  well if he would n't be so picky he 'd be employed by now,

  my `` paper candy '' app will crush your meagre fifty three users !, 
  what makes aspartame or msg bad ?

  shitty website keeps crashing ipad browser and alien blue . 
  shit i thought my library was big at 185 gb ... 
  i use itunes for home and google play to access select playlists from mobile devices ( finland ) . 
  ** this ** people do n't realize the amount of publicity blockchain is getting from misrepresenting the issue . 
  they knowingly broke the rules and were removed because of it . 
  if it 's a crackdown , how come [ coinjar ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/coinjar-for-iphone/id725209873?mt=8 ) is still around ? 
  above link has screenshots . 
  when it was submitted for approval it only had wallet viewing feature , after approval they added sending and receiving , as the app is a native wrapper for an html-based website . 
   the most common types of filters used by people who inject are cotton wool , tampons , cigarette filters and swabs ( for example , alco-wipes ) . 
  these materials all provide a basic level of filtering ; they remove many of the larger insoluble particles and they are also useful in drawing up drug mixes from spoons and in helping to preserve a sharp needle point .
