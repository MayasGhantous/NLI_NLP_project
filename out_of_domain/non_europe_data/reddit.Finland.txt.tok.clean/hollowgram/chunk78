  felt more like a vlog thrown together than a thought out overview of what made your trip ( and seattle ) awesome . 
  a lot of people are concerned with the legal frameworks giving too much control over our food to the big food corporations . 
  i mean , they run the show now , but they do n't own the seeds they use to grow . 
  a threat to biodiversity in other words . 
  damn , bill is such a sport . 
  stop resisting !,

  [ noodler 's ahab ] ( http://www.gouletpens.com/noodlers_black_pearl_ahab_flex_fountain_pen_p/n15047.htm ) is a cheap and terrific fountain pen , only 20 bucks . 
  [ check the wiki page on social identity theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_identity_theory ) , basically people define themselves through what they associate with . 
  this involves exaggerating differences between other groups/preferences to have a distinct idea of self . 
  this can apply to brands , sports teams , religions , pretty much anything . 
  it 's a matter of taste . 
  i think the composition works pretty well , although i agree that having it horizontal would make it more interesting imo . 
  good job , but vignetting the top and bottom ever so slightly might help draw even more attention to the trio ( maybe even a radial mask around them to boost the shadows ) . 
  granted , it 's features are far ahead of iwork , but it is a strain on system resources compared to pretty much anything except chrome and adobe cs . 
  that 's sarcasm , right ? 
  from ios device management to the music/movie stord , itunes is a cornerstone of apple 's services . 
  thats from the sequels btw . 
  so , do n't try to right a wrong today because of possible new problems tomorrow ? 
  but are you aware of your biases when you 're reading ? 
  ** ok , you have a chance to do fantastic work and elevate your career if you 're willing to put in the time and effort to do this right . 
  i 've created websites and done graphics design in one form or another since ' 97 , nowadays i 'm moving more towards video and photography but i continue to do a fair share of ui/ux and front-end . 
  i 've never managed to properly harness javascript ( i 'm eternally grateful for [ jquery ] ( http://learn.jquery.com/ ) ) nor really do coding from scratch in php , grails , django , python , never mind objective-c , c++ or other programming languages i 've come across during my time doing this ( i use [ wordpress ] ( http://codex.wordpress.org ) ) . 
  ** realize that html and css are * easy * as hell ** , they 're markup and style sheet languages , meaning you 're just dressing up text and giving it properties , which as a graphics designer you know is what design deconstructs to . 
  you can make empty boxes and give them background images , define the line height of text , make a grid model that collapses as the screen gets smaller , etc. 
  it 's really limitless . 
  follow the big thinkers and doers of the industry to see where the ball is at and where it 's going . 
  this is a fast-moving industry . 
  i recommend trying to find quality resources ( [ code academy ] ( http://www.codecademy.com/ ) is a solid learning center ) , know the [ w3school ] ( http://www.w3schools.com/html/ ) as a reference , and just go about it step by step . 
  there are tons of videos and tutorials out there , [ smashing magazine ] ( http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ ) is one good example . 
  search on google for `` good web design tutorial websites '' and take you pick . 
  but * read * and try things . 
  get a proper html/css program so you can experiment ( [ coda is what i use on mac ] ( https://panic.com/coda/ ) , [ textwrangler ] ( http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ ) is a good free alternative ) . 
  ** understanding html and css ** ( [ html intro video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8iuzjtei8q ) | [ css intro video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjtanox4iqi ) ), 
  mobile devices have their own considerations , e.g. 
  viewports ( [ intro video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrmtutzx4co ) ), 
  recommeneded reading is [ apple human interface guidelines ] ( https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/ ) , especially the [ layout ] ( https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/layoutandappearance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/tp40006556-ch54-sw1 ) and [ design strategies ] ( https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/principles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/tp40006556-ch4-sw1 ) sections to get an overview of things to take into consideration when thinking of creating mobile versions of websites/interfaces . 
  invest in some books about the things that interest you the most . 
  [ lukew ] ( http://www.lukew.com/ff/ ) presents the idea of '' [ mobile first ] ( http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1846 ) '' , [ smashing magazine ] ( http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/05/building-a-better-responsive-website/ ) has a good overview of it . 
  basically : do n't think of web design as difficult , do n't get overwhelmed , google all your questions , try to find videos if the concept seems hard to grasp , always focus and refine your hold of the fundamentals , [ be inspired ] ( http://bestwebgallery.com/ ) but never forget [ usability ] ( http://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/ ) nor the [ standards ] ( http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/ ) . 
  if you want to do ux , you need to do user research and read about the studies . 
  [ you need to wireframe ] ( http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399 ) and be able to prototype your designs quickly . 
  start with the ideas and let them define how they should look and feel . 
  i do n't have time to google the links for you , but here 's some terms you should check out : a/b testing , user flow , information architecture , usability study , peek.com , agile development , kanban boards , moscow , git , prototyping on paper . 
  if you get good , you can do beautiful things . 
  you might not end up coding , but you 'll understand what it takes to get your designs into reality . 
  try to kindle your passion , do n't get cocky , be active . 
  how do you mean ? 
  supergreen !, 
  meh , first season was kinda interesting but the main character is such an evil bastard and it only gets more violent in season 2 . 
  felt disgusting following his antics , many problems he was the culprit of . 
  not my bag of tea . 
  some nice ones i had n't seem before , thanks for sharing . 
  bootcamp which comes with os x allows you to run windows on mac hardware , less issues with drivers and great battery life for laptops . 
  plus due to lower rates of depreciation you can actually get more money back when you sell/upgrade as opposed to pcs . 
  * everything * is an ad for ikea . 
  `` low poly '' =\\ = `` modern art style '', 
  does n't matter , has nukes . 
  look out for automata . 
  should be good . 
  reminded me of the [ when i 'm gone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmsbxsfe3l8 ) song , but sorry , has clapping :p, 
  angle of reflections on the screen make me suspect a fake . 
   `` white balance can be misleading '', 
  you have white sheets in the background !, 
  imo the main allure of rolling your own smoke is being able to put in the amount of tobacco at the density you want , ending as close or as far from the filter as one wants , and rolling it all together with the paper as you feel appropriate in that situation . 
  of course , for many it 's the decreased price , but for me when i smoked and was in my hand-rolling phase , the custom roll i made each time was the main factor that i enjoyed . 
  ... and none resemble the psd provided . 
  we dream every night , but most of us forget them . 
  trick is to have intent to remember + we wake up for a small bit during the night , trying to not go instantly back to sleep but to write down whatever you remember , these will help increase recall and retention . 
  [ every person ever studied sleeping ] ( http://www.asdreams.org/subidxeduq_and_a.htm ) has shown brainwaves that correlate to rem sleep phases . 
  although with current technology it is in fact impossible to absolutely determine whether a person never dreams or simply never recalls his/her dreams , my understanding is that the view of the scientific community is that every person in fact does dream , even if they are unable to ever recall them . 
  do n't try to get over it . 
  after a few more dates , ask him what he thinks of style and clothing . 
  ask if he 'd mind if you took him shopping . 
  make it fun and non-judgemental . 
  he might freak , but who knows . 
  let 's wait until the official announcement ? 
  something makes me think these do n't represent the final backplate of the 6 . 
  doesnt always allow me to scale the image to a well visible size . 
  he wanted to share the exciting masterplan with him so he could congratulate him on his gangs ingenuity . 
  he looked so shocked and slightly betrayed when it went the other way . 
  have you tried proxmate ? 
  works for me . 
  it 's a plugin for firefox/chrome , understandable that you might not have access to those browsers at work though . 
  why are you watching tv shows at work anyway ? 
  probably referring to extensions and widgets . 
  [ here 's one resource ] ( http://rapidnfc.com/ ) . 
  does n't resolve how to watch internet-exclusive extended interviews . 
  in finland , i 'm only able to eat granny smith and red delicious from the store , others give me an allergic reaction for whatever reason . 
  local , natural ones pose no issues . 
  i 'm all for local produce , but do n't hate on the red delicious !, 
  people like me have no real choice most of the year . 
  * whoa *,

  war never changes . 
  1password i guess would be an obvious recommendation .
