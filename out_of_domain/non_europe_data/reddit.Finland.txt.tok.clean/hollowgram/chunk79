  interesting observation , but the whole thing was speculation from the beginning . 
  either apple did n't feel a need to repeat this phrase ( as only their first report had it ) , or they actually received a demand based on the patriot act afterward . 
  hard , if not impossible , for any outsider to say which way it is . 
  software is . 
  optical is is hardware . 
  more frames per second = faster shutter speed = more light needed, 
  basically the faster you take a photo , the more light you need , and really video is just a fast succession of photos . 
  there 's sensor sensitivity to light ( iso ) and aperture ( size of the hole through which light passes ) which can help compensate , but these have a limit as well . 
  so 240 fps needs a fair amount of light to produce viewable results . 
  does n't the homekit standard allow your iphone to remotely send these scheduled commands via wi-fi and internet to these devices , or does the system actually require an ios device to be present in the network to make these changes occur ? 
  shutter effect could mean many things . 
  do you mean a slight flickering of the brightness between frames ? 
  required characteristic of reporters in the 21st century . 
  rumoured to be a feature . 
  sapphire tends to shatter when it breaks , obvious limitation for why it is n't used for smartphone screens . 
  how is apple responsible for rumours ? 
  phones use gorilla glass 3 , manufactured by corning . 
  the flicker is caused by the oscillation of the light source when filming . 
  basically , artificial light flickers on and off , but at rates we ca n't detect with our eyes . 
  the slow mo frame rate brings this out in your footage . 
  [ here 's a video demonstrating this with different light sources ] ( http://vimeo.com/45537299 ) . 
  iirc jasmine removed this functionality when asked to by google . 
  that is a marvelous execution of a concept . 
  the 4 is glass on both sides . 
  if that bent in your hands , you 'd have bigger issues than a bent phone . 
  son , today i am not disappoint . 
  i have a creative d100 that has n't failed to keep impressing me since i got it . 
  useful idea to keep in mind too when discussing/debating . 
  do n't get misled by red herrings . 
  htc m series was the easiest to bend according to the consumer reports test . 
  samsung s5 was also bendable . 
  what are you on about ? 
  apple is n't sacred and screws up , but this is one of those times . 
  i hate bs being peddled as fact . 
  enjoy it though . 
  he did it all for the nooki .

  video has a good point , but the background music is not for me . 
  my brother said he found this exact same kind of system at barcelona airport , this ai n't new !, 
  that is such a solid resource . 
  thanks for sharing !,

  pelmenit is a small cozy house kitchen style restaurant in kallio that can be reserved for such occasions .

  is the actress playing mabel that aryan looking surgeons wife in the knick ? 
  [ ** edit ** she is !, 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2464250/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t10 ), 
  not only that , they could n't be bothered to fill in the missing part of the arm ? 
  the quote is n't even from the show !, 
  very shoddy . 
  how do you think practical special effects are done ? 
  i think you missed the word `` practical '' there . 
  check the behind the scenes photos of ghostbusters , star wars , alien , 2001 , batman , even some tumbler scenes in the dark knight trilogy , and many more . 
  bimbos and burkas , what more context do you need ? 
  $ 44,99 for the os x version . 
  [ i knew it !, 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2464250/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t10 ) , mabel is also eleanor in [ the knick ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2937900/ ) , a surgeons wife .

  yes , but thats not the name of the show . 
  what was up with that ex-cia director ? 
  how can such humour and lightedness exist in a man who held that position and secretary of defence ? 
  and in the end of the online special make the joke `` you better watch what you say '' ? 
  wow .

  genetically tailored medicine ? 
  i 'm glad to hear that the deciders are paying more attention to the issue , but my question was more geared to asking what new technologies are on the horizon , what will the tomorrow of disease prevention/fighting look like , especially since it seems antibiotics are becoming less effective . 
  thank you for your answers . 
  anyone made a list ? 
  that 's how you kick ass with civility . 
  yeah my cash does n't run out of battery , so no , this is n't the end of physical currency . 
  awesome tip !, 
  will share with friends who want to get it . 
  amazon does n't care as long as you buy the products . 
  kindles are n't made for profit , they 're devices for consuming amazon services . 
  difference is glaring on my iphone 5s . 
  pay as much as for an ipad air for a less capable machine ? 
  talk all you want about specs , the apps are an entire tier below ios . 
  ** edit : ** thanks for all the downvotes and no real retorts . 
  as we saw from thursday 's special event , ios supports pixelmator , replay , among apps like garageband , imovie , infinity blade iii , etc. 
  that deliver experiences you just do n't get today with android . 
  i hope the situation gets better , but it 's understandable that devs ca n't support such a large swathe of devices with various capabilities on top of running in an os that does n't prioritize touch events over other computations , no matter how many jabs google has done to try and rectify the slow responsiveness of android in comparison to ios . 
  restore your phone . 
  should take care of these issues . 
  my mbp is late 2011 , so far no issues . 
  this has me worried . 
  15 '' model :p, 
  thankfully i use it mostly when i 'm visiting clients/prospects , but as a designer/photographer/video producer it does get gpu intensive at times . 
  how the fuck is one of the most recognized artists who has a fully realized vision of tech and fashion in this sub ? 
  this is what * artists do * . 
  wtf ? 
  he * is * an artist . 
  very mainstream , i do n't listen to his music or follow what he 's up to , but he is doing his thing with talent and is successful . 
  how is he fit for / r/delusionalartists ? 
  that is profanely stupid .
