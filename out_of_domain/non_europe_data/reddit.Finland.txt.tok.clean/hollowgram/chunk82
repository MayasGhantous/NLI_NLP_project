  iphone can also record in 4k with procam app . 
  trains could have been automated long ago , yet they still have conductors . 
  aside from, 
   pilots enjoy the control and thrill, 
  ( that 's hardly the socioeconomic reason we still have pilots piloting airplanes ), 
  you pretty much make my point , automation will * ease * the lives of professionals , and definitely remove middlemen and grunt jobs , but i think we 're still far off from when banks and major institutions will be run my ai algorithms . 
  they will learn to fetch and display data in ways we want way faster than we can imagine , but ultimately a human will be the one interpreting the data and being the final say-so . 
  that said , ultimately i think a big change will come if and when automation advances to the level of being an extremely effective and brilliant personal assistant , coupled with societies moving forward to have such things such as universal basic income and generally investing in the well-being and thriving of its members , instead of its current tendency of being a punitive system motivated by fear of its members and propagating the necessity to work to sustain living , could lead to something akin to a new enlightenment age of culture and science . 
  but who knows , right ?

  i swear , growing up in the 90 's i wondered about how much they follow each others careers ( they were really head-to-head in the pop world ) , this settles it for me that at least aguilera was all up on spears .

  how much energy would it require to throw an ice moon out of orbit and towards a trajectory with venus ?

  [ bullshit ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-mossad-chief-calls-netanyahus-iran-speech-bullshit/ ), 
  the thing is , this is the first time that apple is going into a new market that is n't already established . 
  they had to drop the amount of sensors because the tech is n't ready quite yet . 
  i 'm sure watch will sell well at launch . 
  but the 2nd or 3rd generation will ( hopefully ) take it to another level . 
  probably a word used in his/her contacts . 
  needs more exposure and shadow boost , was way dark to watch . 
  filming could have been more 1 point perspective from the side . 
  i just watched a guy go back and forth , and the cuts and angles were all pretty much the same for each . 
  music built hype that never came . 
  soda can left me confused . 
  keep going at it , put as much thought into the video * beforehand * , think of the shots you want to get . 
  and crank that exposure , 
  random thoughts below :, 
  what camera do you use ? 
  do you do photography ? 
  looking into its principles can help you develop your understanding of lighting and composition . 
  look at strobist blog and the hundreds of quality photography videos on youtube . 
  look into davinci resolve for color correction , it 's free and industry leading . 
  boosting highlights and shadows , color balances , etc. 
  is what this program excels at . 
  led lights are not expensive . 
  [ here 's one for $ 30 ] ( http://www.dx.com/p/hd-126-7-6w-5600k-126-led-video-light-photoflood-lamp-photography-luminaire-black-6-x-aa-188956#.vpxvl4hlc8s ) . 
  i recommend getting a couple . 
  set them up with [ light stands ] ( http://www.dx.com/p/portable-2-fold-folding-photo-studio-tripod-light-stand-black-203236 ) and [ flash brackets ] ( http://www.dx.com/p/universal-plastic-swivel-flash-bracket-32969#.vpxwhihlc8s ) . 
  practice in a room lighting and filming objects with your lighting setups . 
  ** light  lens  camera **, 
  do n't forget the sketchpad . 
  edit : when it boils down to its core , a good skate video is no different than other good videos . 
  [ here are some examples ] ( https://vimeo.com/search?q=skate ) . 
  manual control is key . 
  learn to dial in the settings your camera gives you , but ideally you would have manual control over everything : shutter speed , aperture , iso sensitivity , white balance , focus . 
  no magic can be done to bad footage in nle 's . 
  get it to be as good as you can in-camera . 
  investing in a 600d and proper lenses is definitely a step in the right direction . 
  but most important thing is to learn to wield the weapon you have . 
  [ check these pro photographers using toy cameras ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl7ecb90d96df59de5 ) , you ca n't let yourself be defined by what you own , because there will always be something else to get . 
  many people find your m500 enough for their purposes . 
  fisheye is sweet for skating , but a basic 17-50mm f/2 .8 will let you explore more . 
  shoot a lot and shoot with purpose . 
  surprises always happen when you press rec , but what matters is what you have done before pushing that button . 
  think ideas . 
  think scenes . 
  think stories . 
  now put it together and make a video that expresses * something * .
