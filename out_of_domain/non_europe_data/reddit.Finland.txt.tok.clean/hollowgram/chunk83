  the research is then validated by attempting to replicate its design elsewhere .

  apple does more than the competition to [ improve working conditions ] ( http://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/ ) . 
  what has microsoft , google , lg , motorola , et al. 
  done ? 
  close to nothing . 
  i suppose it 'll be similar to the current situation : apple has authorized resellers that have guidance manuals from apple , but it 's boils down to a case-by-case basis . 
  you can manually make a normal sim into a micro sim with [ this tool ] ( http://www.dx.com/p/micro-sim-card-cutter-black-126906 ) , so you could use the 4s if you felt like upgrading , 
  shame pebble never integrated a heart rate monitor into their watches . 
  i find it hard to believe that apple would include `` gimmick '' level features to their product . 
  measuring heart rate is n't a super detailed venture , but it sure is valuable information . 
  blood pressure etc. 
  is even more valuable , but that 's tougher to pull off , especially on a watch . 
  heart rate just requires a light measuring luminosity changes of the skin . 
  finally !, 
  wait a minute , did they change the processor as well ? 
  because the gold model has a * white * home button , which is the touch id , separate from the screen .

  1 ) apple changed fingerprint sensor with the screen for whatever reason , but not the cpu . 
  so the fingerprint sensor does n't work, 
  2 ) apple gutted an entire black iphone and put it into this gold shell , for whatever reason . 
  3 ) apple did n't really repair this phone, 
  hmm ... 
  that 's from a video showing how it 's built .

  i 'd be interested in seeing a video of it in action . 
  because then it would mean that either they really cannibalized another phone for yours or that they have a way of pairing the cpu with a new touchid sensor . 
  not relevant to this case though .

  whats up with arching your neck as you bench ? 
  keeping your neck straight/aligned with the rest of your spine will help give that extra ounce of strength and prevent injury . 
  that 's finnish spring . 
  so rain , sleet and occasional snow . 
  ca n't let that be an excuse not to get around when your bus pass has expired and you have no money to renew it :d, 
  perhaps do n't look at the bar but rather keep looking up ? 
  this is what rippetoe also advises in starting strength . 
  you seem to have a regular spotter . 
  ask him to put his hand on your forehead as you bench ( with a lighter weight ) to get the feel . 
  close your eyes and focus on keeping it straight . 
  i think it 's worth working on , it looks like it could lead to an injury down the road . 
  what synth/drum machine are you using for the 808 ? 
  that prob has a pitch setting in itself . 
  esx is a sampler , so audio only or basic wave functions . 
  sure , record playing the note , select it and go to file -  bounce -  regions in place . 
  be sure you quantize/get it like you want it before . 
  this will create a new audio track from the recorded region . 
  but !, 
  let me take a moment to show you how to do it so you can pitch it however you want non-destructively in midi , perhaps it will give some insight into how logic works , and a bit about ultrabeat . 
  [ open this image and i 'll explain what each section means .

  if you 're using the boutique 808 preset , it creates a track stack set . 
  i 've created one for the screenshot in a project i opened , so there 's other non-related tracks visible in the mixer . 
  make sure you have the track info open ( marked in red ) , as well as the mixer ( key shortcut is x , also marked in green ) . 
  on the top of the track , you always see its input . 
  so for track stacks , they use busses , which are basically auxiliary tracks that can feed into multiple tracks . 
  this is a great way of reducing cpu overhead by e.g.
