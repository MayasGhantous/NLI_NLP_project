  having echo busses you can send your audio to , so it processes all the audio sent to it at once , instead of having the same preset for each track individually . 
  so , here in my screenshot the boutique 808 track ( which is expandable ( highlighted in white ) to allow you to create independent tracks for various parts of the drum , e.g. 
  kick effects come from one track , etc. 
  the effects you put on the kick track will affect all kick sounds in that track stack , even if there is no midi data recorded onto its track . 
  i 'm still not 100 % on how track stacks exactly work , since i 've been using logic since version 8 , but that 's a basic primer . 
  [ here 's a video that goes over it in more detail ... 
  i think . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot3g51tzgns ) . 
  ** ok so now for what you want to do : pitch the 808 snare . 
  ** by opening the mixer , we see the tracks and busses of your project . 
  the track input is bus 24 in my case , so i look at the bottom where i see the track outputs to find bus 24 that has an input of ultrabeat . 
  this is a drum machine synth part of logic . 
  it 's a beast . 
  i have it open to the right . 
  ultrabeat has oscillators , noise generator and various filters . 
  osc 2 has the sampler section , e.g. 
  it has the option of loading an audio file . 
  the area circled in pink is where you can define your pitch . 
  that blue off text actually allows you to bind the pitch setting to a control , e.g. 
  a knob on your midi controller . 
  ultrabeat is a real beast , and a great introduction to its power and abilities to materialize your musical ideas are immense . 
  i * really * recommend checking the [ two videos sflogicninja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kelps7_rizm ) has on the synth to understand your way around it . 
  it 's worth the time investment . 
  i hope that helped . 
  all the best , and enjoy logic !,
