  a physician ? 
  weigh your needs and decide . 
  i have a friend who has a mini with a 5400 rpm drive who produces music without a hitch . 
  i do multimedia ( graphics , video , photographs ) with a fusion drive ( imac ) , ca n't say i miss having faster read speeds . 
  at least with the mini you can more realistically change your mind later by swapping the hdd . 
  attempting to improve things = / = things improve, 
  tell that to windows phone 7 users . 
  had this with the 5s when accepting calls . 
  no problems so far with the 6 . 
  condolences, 
  takes a lot of time to do any type of printing on a 3-dimensional surface . 
   adult mantidflies are predators of suitably sized insects , which they catch as mantids do . 
  i chuckled . 
  one fix : require passcode to erase settings and data . 
  the exception proves the rule . 
  no , it does the opposite . 
  dem feels . 
  women are n't the only ones who experience this . 
  especially as i get older , casual hookups for the sake of hooking up do n't seem worth it at all . 
  there are regulations for how electronic devices function and they have to be able to be turned off from a power button in * x * amount of seconds by law . 
  apple ii was the first true personal computer all-in-one . 
  the macintosh was a popular success back in its day and helped usher gui computing , bringing concepts from xerox parc to the masses and pushed microsoft to develop windows . 
  sounds like the problem might be in your router/modem or in its configuration . 
  holy shit you could feel the vortex of emotions flowing through the room at the end of the set . 
  wow !, 
  louis keeps pushing , a true master . 
  iirc , that 's if the app uses the universal cache . 
  unfortunately , no matter how good-intentioned , [ anti-gmo campaigners are doing exactly that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy-uphlj31a ) : by forcing more regulation and fear-mongering , the price for researching and licensing gmo seeds is driven so high that only big agra has the ability to invest in it . 
  plus gmo 's actually [ enable the possibility of using less pesticides ] ( http://reason.com/blog/2014/11/06/biotech-crops-use-less-pesticide-study-r ) . 
  man that got weird . 
  in cases like this , that attention is delegated to someone stretched too thin to catch his/her mistake until it 's too late . 
  and that was last week . 
  this week is repeats again :(, 
  shame it does n't go across the pond , apple is way more strict with that stuff in europe . 
  forget it if you do n't have an official apple store , everything goes through authorized repair centres that answer to the eu headquarters in ireland , * way * more stingy with replacing faulty hardware . 
  you 're obviously wrong because it clearly says 11:0:39:22, 
  mayweather is a boxer , there is no grappling in boxing . 
  it 's a wonderful idea , but think about it in practice : in 2014 , [ apple got roughly 130 million * new * customers ] ( http://mashable.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-stats/ ) and has sold over 1 billion ios devices to date . 
  let 's imagine that in 2015 they conservatively sell only 150 million devices total . 
  that 's 750 * million * gigabytes from giving each of them 5 gigabytes . 
  that 's an insane amount of data to store ( in addition it 's encrypted ) , manage in datacenters and to transmit back and forth . 
  google can do it because of the economies of scale . 
  [ google is 40 % of the internet today ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/08/17/fascinating-number-google-is-now-40-of-the-internet/ ) , that gives you the ability to offer services like unlimited high resolution uploads . 
  it 's quite a feat to be able to offer that for free . 
  mirror ? 
  not available in my country . 
  try endnote if you want to doodle stuff ? 
  evernote has alarms . 
  you can combine it with skitch , a doodle program owned by evernote to combine sketches to it . 
  macs and mobile devices have n't quite yet gotten that casual drawing notation down , so no you wo n't have anything that will 1:1 replace your whiteboard . 
  you will need to adapt yourself to digital equivalents . 
  you will have a small helper in your system bar [ like so ] ( http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/03/evernote312.png ) that you can use to quickly write down something where you can also take an image of your screen/screen area ( like a doodle you might have drawn ), 
  also you can install the evernote web clipper which lets you save internet pages and iirc you can even doodle notes on the page as you save it . 
  you will also have an email address you can send notes to . 
  lots of great movies made from the lives of real-life douchebags . 
  found a girl on tinder ? 
  whats he doing there ? 
  red flags throughout . 
  possible solution : create a siri session tag server-side , after processing the request , go back and analyse the audio stream sent from beginning to identify song . 
  would n't work except for the loudest and most popular tunes , but could improve hit %, 
  the suggestion would be for apple to implement , this is not something that third parties could do . 
  dashboard < launchpad in miserability . 
  that 's a baboon , not a banana . 
  [ here you go sir ] ( https://www.ifixit.com/guide/how+to+apply+anti-fingerprint+oleophobic+coating/9682 ) . 
  imagine if apple has collaborated with tv manufacturers to have a standardized communication protocol that then allows the apple tv to control supported tv sets with just the to-be-unveiled new apple remote . 
  strange , mine degraded . 
  did you remove messenger as well ? 
  i 'd recommend buying the applecare code from ebay to save money . 
  what are the downsides ? 
  its a code you enter in apple support and its registered . 
  saves around 30-50 % of the price . 
  no , this is a chance for pro-level audio units being ported from mac to ios . 
  imagine sampletank or kontakt or amplitube and waves effects on your phone . 
  studio-grade audio plugins for your little riff on a busride . 
  haha finnish girl toward the end saying `` this ca n't be real '' ( t\u00e4\u00e4 ei oo totta ), 
  on their os x preview site they talk about the new chinese and japanese system fonts , thought it referred to that . 
  happy to be wrong !, 
  would be cool , but i do n't think forcetouch can distinguish such subtle levels of pressure ( at least not yet ) . 
  that is the most redditty reddit silver i have ever seen . 
  your audio levels are out of whack , clipping on cuts makes me feel that you did n't add end fades . 
  your shooting angles need work and your exposures are a bit too high . 
  also your younger actor tries to emote too much and ends up fidgeting . 
  keep at it though !, 
  not bad !, 
  this is why 1 ) ebay sellers have ratings 2 ) you have paypal buying protection . 
  you quote 85 % , any source on that ? 
  stories of what happened to a friend of a friend do n't count . 
  buyers are well-protected on ebay , sellers get screwed more often . 
  use a less colorful background , have more subtle colors . 
  get closer !, 
  on a bus, 
  [ chopper !,

  study , emulate and learn from your favourite movies and the masters of the craft . 
  learn the rules somyou know how to break them . 
  ask him how do our bodies use the metric system so accurately ? 
  complete broscience . 
  i 've been having pain around my shoulder blades for some time and around the infraspinatus connection . 
  massage and rest have n't removed the pain . 
  sometimes i wake up with numbness in my arms that goes away once i stretch by gripping the bed and pulling by body in the opposite/away direction .
