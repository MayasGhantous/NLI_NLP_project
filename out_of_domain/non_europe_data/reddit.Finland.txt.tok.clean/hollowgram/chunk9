  i know parrish74 only had the best intentions but honestly , this is like a level 5 shit-test and i think we all just passed . 
  well if you do n't know anything about their business how are you going to make it clear how they benefit from a new website or even know how to go about designing it with * their * customers in mind ? 
  you need to know about business in general and their market as much as possible . 
  most business owners are wrapped up into their goals/perspective , when you come and tell them about how you see they 're doing x and y but how they 're missing out on this potential and how your estimates show that most likely within the first six months they 'll get their money back and start turning a profit as well as have a much more solidified brand presence on - and offline ? 
  you got ta know how to talk jibe to business owners and businesspersons if you want business . 
  best way is to run your own shop ( experience ) and extensive research ( knowledge ) . 
  there 's a lot of businesses no matter where you go , offering varying packages ( wp theme installation w / adsense up to full-blown brand identity design ( stationary templates and everything ) and marketing campaigns ) . 
  imitate the best , learn from the rest , innovate and find your place . 
   it 's a pain to use keyboard shortcuts or type while holding a stylus,

  how do you suggest i find the place there easier then before i leave ? 
  i do n't speak spanish ( yet ) unfortunately . 
  my friend who lives in tarragona can go and visit any prospective apartments and personally meet to discuss details , but that 's quite a drive away . 
  i just have an impression that if i go to barca without an apartment i 'll spend a fair share of money on hostel rooms looking for an apartment that may or may not materialize , i do n't want to leave it to that . 
  right now i 'm going to exhaust every single option there is in finding a decent crib before i venture off . 
  do you have any tips for how to go about finding a place/choices once i get there ?

  thank you profusely for giving me a great tip !, 
  `` do n't deal with your immaturity and take it out on your mom for all to see on facebook '' seems like a more appropriate title . 
   i 'm too afraid of disappointment and being talked down to to find a job, 
  when we experience a feeling , our brain flushes our body with specific chemicals associated with that feeling , and that spreads all around your body . 
  we experience fully with our mind and body but in modern western culture we 're very trapped in our logic and rationalizations . 
  hone in on your feelings , especially those that come up when you 're uncomfortable and instead of freezing , follow the sensation . 
  where is it ? 
  what color is it ? 
  what shape ? 
  follow the feeling , feel it change and move . 
  this is integrating yourself with your state and instead of labeling and judging , you experience . 
  get out of your comfort zone , even if it 's with microsteps . 
  ultimately your problem is your limited beliefs and bad rapport with yourself . 
  i bet you talk to yourself in such a way that if you talked that way to others they would n't be around for long . 
  see the immidiate problems that can cause ? 
  no one is perfect and you should n't hold any masks , instead you should tyy to be as honest as possible with yourself and where you are . 
  love yourself , the reason you hold the outer world as separate from yourself is because you 've insulated yourself out of it all and now all you have are your memories , beliefs and thoughts ( which are all ** very ** limited ) . 
  you ca n't change until you accept , you ca n't accept until you see . 
  if you want to become a better you , it 's totally possible . 
  just do n't come from a negative , problem-oriented perspective . 
  it 's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking then it is to think your way into a new way of acting . 
  but you need to ask yourself , are you ready to let go of all that pain , frustration and anger you feel towards others ?
