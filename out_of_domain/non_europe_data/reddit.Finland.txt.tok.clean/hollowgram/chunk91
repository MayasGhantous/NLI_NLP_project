  guess they rolled out to the rest of europe . 
  i live in finland . 
  personally my experience was that using the mobile site + having messenger drained my battery like crazy . 
  well , i do n't quite like it either ( why does it ping me for new messages and only after opening the app does it go get the actual message ? 
  left waiting for 10s + while it connects and fetches , even when background app refresh is enabled ) , nearly all of my friends and overall social network use messenger to communicate , so without it i would miss their messages . 
  please explain why the soviets never called out the lie and how [ mirrors were put on the moon that have been used daily to bounce lasers for accurate distance measuring ?

  not publishing content earlier and being stuck in a quest for perfection that can not exist . 
  you obviously are oblivious to the challenges of astronomic flight . 
  this was the 60 's , not 2015 . 
  anyway , [ with a powerful enough telescope you can actually see the landing sites ] ( http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/celestial-objects-to-watch/moon/how-to-see-all-six-apollo-moon-landing-sites/ ) on the moon . 
  believe what you want but with all the evidence it 's pretty ridiculous to claim the moon landing was fake . 
  oh , and a little mitchell and webb for you http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p6monehcouw, 
  yes , astronomy and all the worlds space programs are one big conspiracy to lie about the van allen radiation belt levels . 
  [ do the math . 
  ] ( http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/algebra1/3page7.pdf ) sorry i forgot you do n't really care about questioning things , just repeating what you saw in some `` cool '' documentaries . 
  go out and talk to the people who work for a living in these things , the world does n't operate in a closet . 
  challenge your notions , because pretty much anything you can think of has thousands of people studying , working and analyzing that issue . 
  ignorance is n't lack of knowledge , it 's the illusion of having knowledge . 
  do the math . 
  loafer power !, 
  as someone who gets part of my income from photography , lightroom is lightyears better than aperture ever was . 
  i do n't know what you mean about slow , on every mac i 've run cc on it 's performed well with 20 megapixel raw files . 
  crashes sometimes , yes . 
  botched updates ? 
  occasionally . 
  the new import screen is a few steps back . 
  but it 's my go to software . 
  photoshop integration , batch exports , all dem tools , etc. 
  make it worth it for me . 
  the integration with ios allow me to sync my latest shoot and flag the best photos , do basic adjustments . 
  keeping that library synced when editing does destroy performance tho , but its quick to turn off . 
  aperture destroyed most of my originals back in the day . 
  only noticed once backups were gone as well . 
  my bad for consolidating my photos into a library , eh ? 
  and photoshop plus lightroom is ~ ~ $ 20/mo . ~ ~ $ 9.99 / mo.

  i dunno what you mean by disappointing mini 2 , i upgraded from the original and have had zero regrets . 
  it 's my reading/gaming/drone flying device that still has awesome battery life and gets it done . 
  wish someone would gift me the 4 of course , but i do n't feel the need to drop hundreds on this upgrade . 
  the mini 2 is still more than fine for pretty much everything . 
  ymmv indeed . 
  sudden slowdowns in performance is not normal . 
  restoring usually helps . 
  i actually had a mini 2 that had a camera which suddenly stopped working . 
  restore did n't help , took it to repairs and got a brand new one as a replacement less than a week later . 
  new and better requires years of r&d with a-level staff . 
  rare to find outside of apple nowadays . 
  companies play it safe and cheap . 
  strange , i have the 5k imac and lightroom cc performs really well with 20mp raw files . 
  its incredible to edit photos that big and see them nearly 1:1 on the screen , can see fine hairs etc. 
  sell it and buy a new one ? 
  if its new you can get nearly all your money back . 
  she really does n't wan na rush things with fitz :d, 
  inspiring and fun story , 
  do you have the standard hdd or did you opt for ssd/fd ? 
  i did customize mine , but i 'd say reach out to apple about it if a restore wo n't increase performance , i do n't think that 's normal . 
  in finland iphone prices went up . 
  iphone 6 64gb last year cost $ 769 , now still retails for $ 759 , 6s version costs $ 869 . 
  ai n't no one gon na talk smack about their jane and get away without some pay . 
  [ here 's a follow-up by tyt ] ( https://youtu.be/jgujnlbc9io ) , saying parts are false . 
  stopped watching , dunno what i expected but the cops vs. the blond was ridiculous for me . 
  yes , they got their brightest to make it illegal to hunt them . 
  damn fish lobbyists !, 
  i would have gotten closer and moved myself more toward the right slightly and panned the camera leftward to get her to fill the frame more and create more depth , somehow the full trunk of the tree and bush on the right distract and take away more than bring to the composition imo . 
  colorwise i 'd have moved the yellow hue more toward orange and perhaps work with the skin tones more , white balance seems relatively on point but it feels desaturated , especially since her skin tone is scraping by . 
  solid effort , keep working at it !, 
  anyone got a link to the final episode ? 
  tip : redo your touch id after ever handwash . 
  a great reason to go with a 3rd party accessory . 
  none . 
  pay the price of a coffee for unlimited adblocking . 
  i use purify myself . 
  they sell an experience , with accessories they really crank up the luxury meter . 
  nice save . 
  that truck nearly touched gravel . 
  til about the [ glasgow coma scale ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/glasgow_coma_scale ), 
  great , let 's have ten more anecdotes and we can call it evidence !, 
  [ that 's why they focus so much on developing countries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ushhoch4q8 ), 
  no available tables .

  examples of good ui :,

  door handles, 
  steering wheel, 
  default html form, 
  good ui does not need explaining , its appearance implies its usability and function ( affordance ) . 
  depends on the car on how intuitive it is . 
  if you 'd dig a bit deeper on how apple has built its ecosystem , you 'd find they work together and are technologically `` merged '' from the start more than you might think . 
  same thing in finland , a coo gave himself a speeding ticket because he noticed he was exceeding the limit .

  thank you for sharing your thanks with the sharer . 
  yes , better to shy away from such things and keep trucking . 
  * what ? 
  went from 6 to 6s plus , the camera ois and bigger screen are amazing . 
  still fits in my pockets  only minus is its weight , but what can you do ? 
  it 's not horrible but def makes the 6 feel like air :d,
