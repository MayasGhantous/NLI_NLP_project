  screenshots are saved in photos as well . 
  it 's no excuse that because the camera does n't take gifs that photos does n't support it . 
  gifs are a bane for devs , but no one is rushing to replace it :p, 
  screenshots are png , images are jpg . 
  what are you on about ? 
   this is not complicated . 
  no , it really is n't . 
  which is why we 're wondering why a key part of ios does n't support gifs . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/ofx7het940c ), 
  they upped the price by 100 this year :p, 
  spin it how you want , but there 's $ 100 more to each model than last year . 
  adjustment or otherwise , prices went up . 
  would removing your preview preference file and flushing cache work ? 
  worse than trash . 
  edit : have y' all heard the ye version of tell your friends ? 
  what is the saving grace of that pos ? 
  sounded like a 5 am soundcheck . 
  which would make both the pen and ipad less convenient by making them slimmer and thicker respectively by introducing such a feature . 
  the swahili was real , i.e. 
  he said what was subtitled . 
  i think we will in the coming episodes , because they just montaged the whole logical continuation of what they set up in this episode with h.q. 
  i do n't get how they went from that to `` well , that was a helluva thing . 
  merry christmas buddy . '', 
  lol . 
  yes , we really needed more apple maps-type fiascos to let apple shine . 
  `` he presented facts in a coherent fashion that made me feel uncomfortable , so he was obviously attacking my beliefs . '', 
  that would have changed things quite a bit . 
  and it was orchestrated by al-qaeda and osama bin laden ?!, 
  crazy . 
  ah , doom3 , the game that made all computers bend over and beg for mercy . 
  never did play more than a few mins . 
  missed the simplicity of the first ones , although iirc this was pretty straightforward . 
  better than the movie :d, 
  i 'm thinking that might be morra 's play in the long game ? 
  there 's definitely more to the backstory than what we know . 
  i should try the same technique for blackletter calligraphy , 
  no one has mentioned it yet , but the connector is a standard two pin power cable , so [ any one of these does the trick in a pinch ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=power+cable+two+pin&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1437&amp;bih=1297&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi5-vaerbdjahwfkswkhtkzcweq_auibigb ) . 
  my experience creating motion graphics , editing 4k and developing 20 + mp raw photos in lightroom begs to differ . 
  its my main workhorse and it does the job amazingly . 
  any creative professional who complains about performance with a 5k imac with 16gb ram and fusion drive is either whiny brat who blames equipment for their lack of skills or a hardcore professional who knows they should have gone with a mac pro . 
  if you do n't mind saying `` ouch '' every now and then . 
  checking phone/facetime settings for devices that can accept a call . 
  vsco for post processing i assume ? 
  really nice , human and touching story , 
  wtf is up with all these breaks ? 
  if by `` shit people '' you mean people who try and take a shit on an entire group of people based on some anecdotal videos ? 
  no , we do n't . 
  please leave or never come , whichever applies to you . 
  trying to reap that karma , eh ? 
  copy-pasting a week-old tip wo n't do you much good . 
  a little touchy i see . 
  have a chill pill and enjoy your day , 
  ok , my bad . 
  [ i thought it was an identical copy of this post ] ( https://m.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3tl2ll/the_most_annoying_thing_about_apple_pencil_solved/ ) but apparently i misremembered a bulleted list . 
  apologies for my crassness . 
  whats so stupid and knee-jerk in offering an alternative that does n't suffer from --, 
  you know what ? 
  nevermind . 
  `` i personally feel like the only color that should ever be used is black . 
  am i wrong ? 
  i feel like i 'm right but am open to opinions '', 
  he was the resident deranged millionaire on the daily show for years :d, 
  that 's a traced sketch . 
  kinda different from learning how to draw , sorry . 
   of course , just because a tos creates an enforceable agreement , does not mean that every provision of the tos will be enforced by a court, 
  sure , it 's something . 
  but how do you know the extent to which the person actually drew vs. used eye-dropper tools to get the right colors and/or applied a filter to get the entire face in one go ? 
  i do n't want to be a killjoy or shit on someones progress , but tracing a photo is not the same as being able to draw , just like following a recipe does n't make you a chef . 
  through quantity you will realize what separates quality and crap . 
  the master has failed more times than the student has tried . 
  to be clear , i never said anything about publishing . 
  `` the smallest action is worth more than the best intentions '' is more what i was going for . 
  article title implies that the * root * of this issue goes deep , i.e. 
  affects a lot of people , not that there 's a clear reason for it . 
  at least that 's how i see it . 
  if it did n't have the `` is really deep '' at the end , i 'd tend to agree with you . 
  so edgy . 
  who gets to say what 's true islam then ? 
  99 % of muslims live peaceful lives . 
  there 's extremist buddhist terrorists in myanmar , is that because of buddhism ? 
  religion is n't the reason , it 's the excuse . 
  without it , there would be another ideology for them to rally around and justify horrid actions . 
  otherwise we might as well blame sports for how fanatical fans behave . 
  ** edit ** [ a good summation by a muslim redditor from another thread ] ( https://reddit.com/r/news/comments/3vfaji/san_bernardino_shooting_attacker_pledged/cxn0l5l ), 
  sports fans , not sports themselves . 
  i think you missed my point . 
  adobe is guilty of screwing around with their updates though , no doubt . 
  lightroom crashes all the frikkin time . 
  trying restoring with itunes ? 
  buy one used on ebay . 
  ^ ^ mirror here, 
  [ not only did jesus approve of all the old testament cruelty ] ( http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/nt_list.html ) , there 's a lot of stuff about killing and torturing people as well . 
  sure , the old testament probably takes the cake in bad stuff , but it 's not like the new testament was the literary version of kumbaya . 
  how about octopi ? 
  are n't they like wicked smart as well ? 
  would you have a link ? 
  app store search just shows me music apps . 
  my lost apps came back !, 
  thought i reinstalled all of them , apparently not :d,
