  mirror ? 
  doesnt load for me at least . 
  edit : does n't work on mobile , but loaded on desktop . 
  some cool new ones i didnt know , but instagram ? 
  first world problems incarnate  the fact that an average person can pull off such a trip is mind-boggling to me in and of itself . 
  glad you guys made it , but please remember to keep things in perspective . 
  there 's still around [ half of the world 's population living in squalor ] ( http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7102/205.9 ) . 
  how would one go about betting against gopro stock ? 
  where to start ? 
  i know nothing !, 
  edit : thanks for all the informative replies , learned a lot !, 
  sounds like a self-worth issue . 
  do n't feel you 're weird or unlovable . 
  give guys a chance to surprise you with compassion and companionship . 
  mail that does n't crash/corrupt itself and airdrop that works reliably ? 
  last one is the only cohesive one of the bunch . 
  when it has worked , it 's fine . 
  the problem is that it nearly never sees any of my devices , all running the latest os versions on my small local wifi . 
  even when i go into the airdrop folder and wait . 
  it 's faster just to send via dropbox . 
  full hd slomo is way crispier , plus 12mp photos gives more cropping leeway and 4k video allows zoom without ruining quality . 
  front flash is nice sometimes . 
  oh and its faster , with double ram and force touch is all sorts of awesome ( open an app right into the function you want , like shazam now ) . 
  i 've noticed in general everything is just way faster . 
  aside from waiting for animations to finish , this phone keeps up with my pace . 
  other than that , what did you expect ? 
  the 6 had 1080@60fps ... 
  only great thing about the old look was that animations would n't reject your interactions before finishing loading . 
  us only ? 
  not available in finland . 
  shazam now, 
  import into vsco, 
  write status to facebook, 
  new tab for safari, 
  recognizing an issue is the first step . 
  you ca n't change what you ca n't see . 
  no one is alone , reach out . 
  it 's strength to try and communicate the complexity within . 
  you are the person who has the power to nurture a better future self . 
  my theory is that since the dark side has so much power over the galaxy , and the movie lore is all about balance , rey is able to learn at such breakneck speed and have such strong power because of this imbalance . 
  rey is luke 's daughter , i guarantee it . 
  there were a lot of sliding transitions !, 
  watch again , 
  shocking tbh . 
  macbook pros have fans , you 're thinking about the new macbook .

  ** tl ; dr ** it 's hard to fake math . 
  it 's as if halving the shutter speed makes the image brighter !, 
  [ the internet - cocaine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3ricxc94am ) , kinda different feel but there 's more than a few similarities .

  a complete trainwreck of an interview . 
  mirror ? 
  blocked in finland it seems . 
  css media breakpoints . 
  they go by screen size , not mobile user agent strings . 
  that was something else , hah !, 
  nice , but face mask needs more detail . 
  keep at it !, 
  sound could be better used to create a more purposeful atmosphere , to help focus on the narration and pacing . 
  no problems for me with amrc on mobile . 
  sounds like the mbp would be suitable for you . 
  portability is awesome . 
   conformed, 
  ftfy, 
  i mean , i kinda want to see the quality with my own eyes , just for kicks . 
  if i had $ 100k i could set up and run a small video production company . 
  wow . 
  [ with a $ 950 carrying handle accessory ] ( http://www.ducloslenses.com/collections/bracketry/products/12x-carry-handle ) . 
  wow . 
  super cheesy , music felt like it was a commercial , the story felt so sugary . 
  i dunno , was n't for me . 
  thanks for the timestamps going past the fluff . 
  if you 're on mobile , just go to around 8:00 . 
  cheers !, 
  works well for me . 
  got the 256 version w normal ram . 
  20mp raw images as well as a3 photoshop documents work well . 
  once you get to big complex files there is crunching but its still great performance imo . 
  i modify the key command to be alt + tab , works great for me  an essential feature for powerusers imo !, 
  as they said in the film `` they do n't want to know the rates '' , they are pitched the dream and told not to worry about payments , and sucker them into loans they could n't afford in any way . 
  the failure of banks and regulatory agencies to reign in this bad behavior while doing everything to perpetuate this system is the crux of the problem . 
  it 's like trying to blame a special needs child for not being able to perform well in a university entrance exam . 
  had ingrown toenails when i was a young teen . 
  the pain continued for so long , was playing soccer and walking home from school . 
  i do have a pretty good pain tolerance because of it though , surgery fixed the toes , 
  businessman ran a business like damn !, 
  how warm does it run ? 
  perhaps doing a backup and restore could remove the issue . 
  does n't sound normal . 
  have you checked the energy tab in the activity monitor ? 
  edit : thanks downvoters , i really learned my lesson . . ? 
  i thought it was a solid opening episode , was great to see all the characters again . 
  william h. macy is amazing as always . 
  debby 's world is crashing so hard , what a foolish young girl . 
  she just does n't understand how things work . 
  no more terminator sequels ? 
  i give it 5 years tops .
