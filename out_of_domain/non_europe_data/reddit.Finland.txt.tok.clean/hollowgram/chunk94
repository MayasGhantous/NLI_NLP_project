  ftfy, 
  camera quality looks pretty bad , no real improvement except for a bigger megapixel count . 
  who cares ? 
  you see like 7 stops of dynamic range in the most ideal circumstances ... 
  i bet nighttime flying would be the same as looking at tv static . 
  give us teh quality !, 
  imessage is a sound suggestion . 
  apple watch with android ?

  how about accounting for diet ? 
  drew images of spaceships and centers . 
  now a designer / media creator . 
  draw that as small as you can . 
  look at the thickness of those lines . 
  logo should be closer to that level . 
  also , myriad pro , really ? 
  edit : your downvotes really helped shed light on the shortcomings of my feedback . 
  thanks .

  have you tried the app ? 
  bring in the exported video and add audio , publish .
