   later in the year should see a brand-new , major update to transmit , that will increase speed , add panic sync , seriously expand protocol support , and more . 
  a transmit overhaul is long overdue and we are extremely excited to get this out to the world in 2016 .

  the thing, 
  please explain this to me , i 'm only familiar with composite films ( narrative technique ) . 
  have n't heard of this film composite before , how does it differ ? 
  [ read about the kinetic chain ] ( http://uconnsportsmed.uchc.edu/injury/prevention/kinetic_chain.html ) , basically the more you activate your entire body for any given movement , the more power you can exert . 
  muscles contract from electrical impulses , the more your cns is activated for a movement , the more muscle you can effectively recruit . 
  i recommend checking out [ athlean-x 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/jdcav24 ) youtube channel , top-level stuff !, 
  i was n't saying that the characters were made with cgi , but rather cg was used to composite the shots together . 
  i could have been more clear .

  solid review , thanks for sharing !, 
  1 ) download app you dont want , sign up for a free trial , find and listen to album , cancel renewal . 
  listen more , set it up on other devices if needed , eventually uninstall app/delete account . 
  2 ) click a link and immediately have the album forever to use as you dare . 
  hmm ... 
  edit : i 'm not justifying illegal behavior . 
  my point was to highlight how average consumers act . 
  jumping thru hoops to enjoy some culture is something nearly no one wants to do , especially if it results in a lesser experience ( no control ) .

  his brother actually served time for murder and cannibalism . 
   album is coming out next year, 
  shit , this is from 2003 , will we ever see that new album ? 
  he really really really likes working with johnny depp . 
  proof or gtfo, 
  security has been strong since day 1 . 
  check their white papers , the eff report or even snowdens comments on the issue . 
  prob figures it was a goos tactic . 
  i smell utter desperation from the gop . 
  i believe many people like myself and others here also watch this late at night before sleeping but enjoy the mental stimulation the late show provides , sometimes subtly with quips , or with stuff like this . 
  it 's a great show imo , hope they keep maturing the format . 
  i completely understand where you 're coming from and agree to an extent , but that last comment kinda rubbed me wrong . 
  wasted potential can also be a sign of the lack of support to make it happen , across all social divides . 
  it 's not easy to bit your lip and power through the grind to make your plans happen , especially if you 're all alone , especially if you suffer from disorders . 
  good old real deal . 
  imagine this : you wake up to loud music and a pounding sound , occasionally followed by yelling . 
  you begrudgingly go downstairs and you see your roommate kicking and punching doors of the house that you live in . 
  you confront him , asking what the fuck , and all you see before you it is a big drunk son of a bitch bent on deatruction . 
  you end up wrestling with him , waking up the other roommates , and collectively proclaiming that this is no way to live . 
  roommate moves out . 
  sounds like a bubble . 
  in finland we had a huge upset last election that shocked a lot of people living in helsinki when nationalists won seats .
