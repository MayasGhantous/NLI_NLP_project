  i can completely see how fleshed out the features are . 
  i 'm definitely going to be an early switcher from antenna as soon as this is out . 
  kudos to the dev !, 
  you 're doing a great job with it , best of luck with the launch !, 
  will try it out and share , 
  sell them then . 
  they announced this in november and have approval process for 3rd party apps , but yea no apps for replicating main app functionality . 
  [ you mean something like this ? 
  ] ( http://www.satechi.net/index.php/type-c-usb-hub-gold ), 
  most people never even realize they have 3d touch or timelapse/slomo functionality . 
  selling points are n't really based on what people need , rather what they might want . 
  if only it logged workouts/duration into the health app ... 
  what i meant was that the strong app does n't log workouts into healthkit , which does have support for workouts and their duration , not reps or sets . 
  this in itself would be great , since strong already records both . 
  great video , [ here 's the tl ; dw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vrfs8qo.jpg ) . 
  thats why insurance is good to have . 
  everything is only improved , do it !, 
  i have the exact same model . 
  the elevation reading ( can be viewed in the compass app ) is pretty decent . 
  the phone could use readings to simply state how many floors above/below you are , especially if it has detected walking the stairs and/or using an elevator . 
  that defence never works . 
  watch pirates of silicon valley . 
  well tbh those ux people who pursue phd 's are n't usually the best in practice , just like those best versed in music theory are n't usually the most talented musicians . 
  hw predictions are impossible , as witnessed by this mbp refresh fiasco . 
  it 's a natural time , to introduce a new watch with a new iphone , but ultimately your guess is as good as anyone else 's . 
  come on guys , this is n't about being accurate , this is about putting in the work to create a fun little story . 
  gets my vote !, 
  until i need it and notice the app i 'm using does n't support it . 
  this should be higher up , my favorite games of all time and i do n't like other rpgs . 
  as well as leather tanning . 
  thus the expression `` piss poor '' because you could make money taking urine to the tanner . 
  buy the apogee duet , 
  hah , i remember checking out fufme.com back in the day , hilarious joke . 
  now it 's apparently the near-future : people be banging their computers . 
  just use a basic toothpick . 
  hard to damage soldered electronics with that , unless you pushing like a madman . 
  exactly , why is a company literally fucking a customer so bad ? 
  putin says : homosexual propaganda !, 
  maybe his music is really ambient ? 
  it 's not good form to answer a straightforward how-to question with `` why would you want to do that ? '', 
  i use vsco sometimes when i 'm on the road shooting wit my 6d . 
  no raw support , this is true . 
  lightroom mobile is cool but vsco is faster for me for my mobile workflow . 
  kinda sad , silver was a dream fulfilled . 
  now they went and robbed him of that . 
  harmonica ? 
  jeez , you 'd think he 'd take that opportunity to demolish her petty personality by just running through a list of detailed obscenities about her . 
  seems like the kinda bitch who would make it easy . 
  insult her out of the car !, 
  hey look everyone , software stabilization is n't as good as ois !, 
  kthx, 
  smoke less . 
  not only for filters , vsco has great algorithms for contrast , highlight recovery , etc. 
  pantteri is its own flavor , hard to describe definitely . 
  a menthol like subtexture or something like that . 
  fazer blue is its own level of choco goodness and the fruit candies ( tutti frutti , remix , etc. ), 
  are different from what i 've tasted anywhere else . 
   but most of the material included in the previously-classified 28 pages was largely raw , unvetted intelligence . 
  later investigations by the cia and the fbi largely debunked many of the claims or allegations made in the classified 2002 report . 
  indeed , the 2004\u00a09/11 commission report and the conclusions of a 2005 joint fbi-cia study , also released friday , both dismissed the idea of any official saudi connivance in the sept. 11 attacks .

  the order of things by michel foucalt . 
  gon na try again some day !, 
  no profits yet because they choose to invest in ... seizing digital control of the entire logistics of retail . 
  that takes money . 
  sochi winter olympics had similar reports , it proceeded . 
  check the watermark in the bottom right corner of the vid . 
  he did say `` world is at war '' and later clarified . 
   `` now there is this one ( war ) . 
  it is perhaps not organic but it is organized and it is war . 
  we should not be afraid to speak this truth . 
  the world is at war because it has lost peace . '', 
   about 15 minutes later , after an adviser spoke to him , francis took the microphone again as he was leaving the journalists ' section in the plane and said he wanted `` to clarify '' that he was not referring to a war of religion . 
   `` not a war of religion . 
  there is a war of interests . 
  there is a war for money . 
  there is a war for natural resources . 
  there is a war for domination of peoples . 
  this is the war , '' he said . 
  `` all religions want peace . 
  others want war . 
  do you understand ? '',

  the problem with that is that that is one person saying what islam is . 
  there are [ 1.6 billion muslims ] ( https://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewj7w9ui1pboahwfkywkhszwcomqfggcmae&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2flist_of_religious_populations&amp;usg=afqjcngcdqjklqso2bieijg5vklbjcd0pq&amp;sig2=w-c9hapjhi9bxmjnifipyw&amp;bvm=bv.128617741,d.bgg ) living in the world today and the overwhelming majority live peaceful lives . 
  [ here 's a pastor ] ( http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/16/christian-pastor-doubles-down-on-saying-the-government-should-use-firing-squads-to-kill-gay-people/ ) who says the government should use firing squads to kill gays . 
  is he representative of christianity ? 
  so let 's not paint a double standard for islam . 
  just like any school of thought ( from veganism to scientology ) , it can be used as a justification for violence . 
  licensing issues w / music usually hampers int ' l releases . 
  meh , in finland it 's been a negative that not enough people have a vocational education . 
  a lot of unemployed academics , lots of open jobs that go unfilled by locals . 
  shaving actually promotes elasticity of the skin . 
  so if you stop shaving your skin will age faster . 
  zika is sexually transmittable though . 
  do you live in a cold country ? 
  using your phone in cold weather under 50 % increases the chance that you deplete a cell in the battery that then can not be recharged , diminishing battery capacity and leading to sudden shutdowns when a certain voltage threshold is passed . 
  it 's not a design flaw , but a technological limitation .
