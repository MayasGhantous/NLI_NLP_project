  ok i did n't think about that thanks, 
  well it 's actually 350 euros here, 
  at least in finnair planes you can use your phones in airplane mode even during take offand landing or at least that 's how i remember it . 
  edit : no it 's not like that but you can use your switch when the seatbelt light is of, 
  i 'm going to buy one when i have the money, 
  i think most people that bought a switch o launch were nintendo fans and i think most of them own a wii u, 
  well therre 's actually mario kart 8 , fast rmx , just dance 2017 and breath of the wild is technically a port, 
  i understand that but i 'm now talking about the fans that will buy every nintendo console, 
  i 'm not sure if that would be sfw, 
  and motion controls are also on the wii u version and i think they were there from the star, 
  11 days in holy shit, 
  yes nintendo was right believing in zelda as the only major launch title and spacing out other releases . 
  when mk8d , splatoon 2 and smo drop there will be more millions sold, 
  actually it was sold at a loss after its first year, 
  you should be thankfull for what you have and be grateful you can even get that . 
  things are 100 % better in the usa than uruguay, 
  well if it is as easy as the first look trailer indicates i would buy it for the switch if i were to buy it, 
  i 'm 100 % buying it when i can aford a switch d - :, 
  nintendo 's marketting has been seriosly on point . 
  was n't this confirmed already, 
  well fire emblem warriors is still coming but after that i 'm seeing nothing, 
  well fire emblem warriors is still coming but after that i 'm seeing nothing, 
  now only thing they have to do anymore is changing their youtube policies . 
  yea same but if i had enough money i think i would at least buy a ps4 also, 
  what about horizon or uncharted i get your point for the most part ( i do n't own a ps4 ), 
  do you live in the eu, 
  yea i mean i mostly play multiplayer games thats why sense the ps2 i 've only owned nintendo consoles, 
  oh god what 's that prise in eur, 
  does n't the ps4 use like 3, 
  that 's the left joy con so it dose n't have an infrared camera, 
  well the gamepad had a camera, 
  ok yea oops but it does n't use the infrared camera on the bottom, 
  i 'd say horizon zero dawn, 
  could somebody tell me why is the binding of isaach afterbirth plus m rated, 
  ok yea but still it seems weird to me, 
  ok yea nevermind sorry i just do n't understand esbr ratings because i 'm from europe, 
  or you can buy it from american eshop or import it from america, 
  that could be the reason why japanese i am setsuna has english text, 
  umm from that list you can see that most people in the world use t dmy system, 
  well it 's not like the system is super fragile watch the gizmo slip video, 
  well persona 5 is coming to the switch, 
  oh wait oops i mixed disagea 5 and persona 5 . 
  persona 5 has n't been confirmed . 
  well tha was shitty, 
  the wii u is deeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaad, 
  well there was a lot off showelware and old game ports from 3rd party on the wii, 
  yea mine too but we have to face the facts, 
  why would you want a devkit if you wo n't develope games with it, 
  i mean the devkits cost more than the consumer console, 
  well she has gotten many things right about the switch in the past, 
  well nintendo does need multiplatform games, 
  do n't they sell those already, 
  the fuck is going on in this picture :-o, 
  well that could still be true and ubi did have mario and luigi as rabbids in one of their commercials . 
  well at least you reffered to her as a she, 
  arms will be out before e3, 
  and also in finland, 
  well those people that only own a switch or want the portability or do n't so much care about achievements, 
  if somebody discriminates you because of your colour choices they are the child not you, 
  that 's kinda what happened with me but i ca n't but i do n't have the money to make the switch from the wii u yet d :, 
  well most of lkd leaks turned out to be true and the rabbids x mario could still be true, 
  i do n't have a switch and have never owned a handheld so take my oppinnion with a grain of salt but i 'd say it 's both, 
  arm and x86 are not that different ecpecially with nvidia involved and the switch is really easy to develop for like we saw with snake pass so devs do n't have any excuses other than the power, 
  well ok but you ca n't deny that it 's easy to develop for at least if we believe that the snake pass developers got the game running well enough in a week, 
  usb-c , 720p screen and also countles other details of the system by confirming what emily rogers said , splatoon remastered ( let 's face it 2 seems basicly remastered ) and as i said mario x rabbids could still happen . 
  porting a game in months is still pretty impressive, 
  well ubi did have mario and luigi as rabbids in one of their commercials, 
  well ttg has not said that this game is not coming to the switch, 
  well the switch is n't sold at a loss, 
  that would be an insta buy for me ( i 've never played rocket leaque ), 
  ok it 's nice to support animal rights but this goes a bit toi far, 
  ok its nice to support animal rights but that 's a bit too far, 
  do n't they want to be, 
  i think that 's an april fools joke, 
  if that was in a normal dock you should send that in to nintendo, 
  well is n't hal labs part of nintendo like monolith soft, 
  thats why youbuy a console when youhave the money for it and do n't buy it with someone, 
  ok tha changes things, 
  every single multi platform game that will release because i can only afford one console ( i know that wo n't happe but on can always hope ), 
  i think so but no new stuf before e3, 
  well it 's bassicly cofirmed that they are coming and do you actually need the millionth device that is able to do that . 
  e3 mark my words, 
  well when the developers see switch selling well they will port more games over, 
  arms looks like it 's going to be fun, 
  it 's hard to say yet but so many of the casual gamers that bought the wii are on their smartphones so i 'd say no but it will do well . 
  but are you a casual gamer, 
  or that could just be a placeholder, 
  was that in the us or world wide ? 
  also in the post its says in the us, 
  some faith in humanity restored, 
  that could actually be possible if we believe liam robertson, 
  i almost completely agree with you . 
  i do n't own a switch yet but have had so much time with one that i think i can make a fair judgement . 
  while i do n't think the pro controller is a necessity at all i think the joy con buttons are a bit too clicky , the grip is a bit too small for my liking and the joysticks an buttons could be a bit further apart . 
  other than that great innovation by nintendo . 
  and fire emblem heroes has microtransactions, 
  wait the handheld screen is 720p, 
  and in the eu tech always has a 2 year warranty, 
  the best club in the world with the best console in the world nice, 
  well blue and red are the barcelona colours,
