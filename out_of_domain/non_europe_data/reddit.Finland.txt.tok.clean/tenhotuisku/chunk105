  this show , like `` cops '' , is part entertainment , and part propaganda . 
  am i the only one who has a huge problem with police officers being part entertainment ? 
  i think the point is every person is possibly a lunatic and i 'd rather risk having unarmed lunatics than an armed one who 's also more likely than average not to view himself as an ordinary citizen bound by the rules of society, 
  not saying he necessarily did the right thing , but this was probably his logic, 
  well no shit you do irresponsible stuff under the influence of drugs . 
  would it be better if we just shut our mouths about it and pretended it does n't happen ? 
  i do n't think that 's the r/trees way of doing things . 
  story about a fulfilling relationship and grand adventures = bragging about having a fulfilling relationship and grand adventures, 
  cool logic there bro, 
   this shit is illegal, 
  versus is for faggots, 
   no , versus is for people who actually know how hockey is played, 
  are you being serious ? 
  versus is full of noobs . 
  i sometimes play it with my friends if there is 3 of us or something because 2-on-1 's suck and even though were almost always drunk and high on these occasions but i ca n't recall ever losing . 
  most of the time the oppontent quits at 3-0 in the 1st period . 
  for the record i do n't play otp either . 
  online team play has some skilled players but if you really want skilled 1on1 's there is no other option than hut . 
  you forgot hut . 
  after they introduced hut i have n't played one ( single player ) game of any other game mode . 
  there 's just no reason . 
  it 's the most fun and has the most skilled opponents . 
  well of course those are stylish as fuck but rarely do two porn star looking chicks show up at my door during the night so i prefer to just use boxers, 
  maybe because it was a funny story in his mind ? 
  you need to get some ointment for that butt hurt, 
  i 'm not saying it 's ok to be irresponsible because you were stoned . 
  i 'm saying weed is an intoxicating drug just like many others and while under the influence of it people tend to do more irresponsible stuff than sober . 
  just because it gives stoners a bad name does n't mean it does n't happen , that was my point , and i do n't get why i got a ton of downvotes for it . 
  i was n't defending any behaviour , just saying it happens and i 'd rather laugh about it than try to cover it up . 
  i did n't say `` weed made them do it '' . 
  i said an intoxicating drug such as cannabis makes it easier to forget stuff and therefore be irresponsible . 
  i was n't defending them , i did n't say it was ok , did n't say it could n't happen sober . 
  but based on personal experience i 'll admit weed makes me more forgetful . 
  my point was that just because some people find this `` not beneficial '' to the image of stoners i 'd still rather laugh at these ( probably fictional ) stories than try to avoid talking about the whole thing . 
  i love weed and support legalization but i 'll be the first to admit a stoned person 's brain does not function exactly like a sober one . 
   if you were part of that school , that would make you go wtf, 
  only if you were n't an exchange student , because you must be anglo-american for this to wtf you, 
  i do n't agree with this . 
  the very post by scy1192 explains what 's wrong with the `` heat-based weaponry '' . 
   you ca n't go rambo because your gun would overheat , but you also do n't have to worry about taking down 5 enemies with only one bullet left . 
  this does not sound good . 
  i like to have the control of my ammo , saving hundreds of ammo for that good weapon until a big fight so that ** i can go rambo ** . 
  the overheat system does n't reward you in any way for using a less powerfull weapon or dropping enemies with headshots and conserving your ammo . 
  with overheating weapons you 're basically always in the same situation if you just wait 5 seconds in cover . 
  i do n't like that . 
  i hate halo , and i 'm a 360 player . 
  i 've played more than a thousand hours of fps games on 360 but halo still sucks dick every time i give it a `` second '' chance . 
  yeah it was ok fun playing the 4 player split-screen on the original xbox but even that has been done better in dozens of games . 
  the only thing more boring than the story are the enemies , guns lack any cojones and i just overall do n't like the execution of the game . 
  that being said i wo n't participate in flame wars and i 'll let you play the game , but i really do n't think it 's a good fps game in today 's market . 
  do you mean the series or the first game ? 
  because while i love the series the first one was really bad . 
  alpha protocol is no doubt in the top 5 worst games i 've played on xbox360 ( and i 've played hundreds ) . 
  kinect games not included as most do n't really even count as games, 
  the worst part was i was jizzing my pants when i heard about a secret agent rpg . 
  i hoped so much for that game to be good , and then it was what it was . 
  while that is a possibility i 've also seen what happens when you mistakenly expect that to have happened when in reality someone really did take the phone . 
  i 'm sorry for not being any help ( probably the opposite ) op , because i know that feel . 
  i still say it 's better to expect it was her and act on it and maybe face a moment of awkwardness than not take the chance and wonder `` what if '' for years . 
  i 'd much rather get relationship advice from r/trees than the rest of reddit . 
  do it faggot, 
  the `` denial of rights '' should be done before it 's too late to abort . 
  if the mother still chooses to keep the baby knowing she 'll have to raise it on her own it 's her choice and she has the right to it . 
  i think this is less difficult to justify than the woman having the right to abort the baby even against the father 's will ( not talking about medical emergencies here ) . 
  or is the fathers contribution suddenly irrelevant ? 
   though it is immoral, 
  i do n't see abortion as immoral . 
  the fetus has no intelligent brain activity . 
  it 's better for an unwanted baby not to be born . 
   i believe that would introduce an unjust pressure to abort, 
  how is the pressure unjust ? 
  only one of the two wants to have a child so only one would have to raise it . 
  at least they still have a choice unlike men who are n't just unjustly pressured but ** forced ** into financing the baby . 
  what happened with them ? 
  i 'm familiar with all these subreddits but i do n't know anything that `` happened with them '' . 
  except for jailbait which got censored because of hypocrite admins . 
  i believe you 're either trolling or an idiot . 
  either way i wo n't continue this conversation . 
  good day sir . 
  because the adult still has a complex developed brain no matter what state it is in . 
  he has memories , he has aquintances , he has family , he 's had a life . 
  no one will miss a fetus . 
  the fetus was never capable of emotion . 
  the fetus does n't have memories , it 's brain is n't even capable of memories . 
  it is closer to a jellyfish than a human . 
  around 3-6 months . 
  that 's why there is a limit as to how late you can abort . 
  i personally have no problem even with abortion later than that because the baby still has no memories or personality but i understand how some people have an issue with it once it looks like a baby . 
  but even at 9 months it 's still nothing like a person in a coma . 
  i honestly had n't heard that argument before but hey , most pro-life people are n't that bright so go figure . 
  i think you 're view is one of those rainbows and unicorn thoughts that looks nice on paper but in real life it 's just not logical or practical . 
  when we have the technology to prevent it why should we force ourself into raising an unwanted baby that 's life will be nowhere as enjoyable as a baby 's who would be born 5 years later to the same parents when they are financially stable and actually want a kid . 
  i do n't think of an abortion as `` killing '' someone . 
  it 's preventing birth . 
  you have to be born to be killed . 
  if i use a condom am i not restricting the future life of my possible would-be child ? 
  should contraception be banned ? 
  because gene pool , survival of the fittest etc. 
  if a woman wants to raise the baby on it 's on she 's welcome to . 
  giving the man equal rights to choose not to have a baby even after conception is not pressuring the woman into an abortion .
