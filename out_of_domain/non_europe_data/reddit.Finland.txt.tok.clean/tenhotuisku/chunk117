  i 'm playing on xbox and been one shotting wolves since like lvl 6, 
  exactly . 
  i 've been using abp ( well originally ab ) for something like 7 years now . 
  it 's simply horrible trying to use someone 's computer that does n't have abp . 
  especially if they have a slow connection or mobile internet or something . 
  a lot of times the actual site is less than 10 % of the data and flashy ads take up the rest . 
  he does n't look very new, 
  you . . do n't check the subs before each game ? 
  no it is n't . 
  i 've always played with manual and play a lot better with them . 
  sure an occasional easy short pass misses but it 's nothing compared to the amount of suckage the auto passes force on you . 
  it feels like 50 % of the time the cpu thinks i want to pass to someone completely different . 
  well a comic about smoking trees and going about your business as usual would n't be very interesting . 
  besides everyone has stoner moments , sure they get rarer the more experience you get but still they do happen . 
  and i 'm not here to `` promote an image as responsible adults '' . 
  i 'm here to be honest and i could n't care less what it does to your `` image '' . 
  also i doubt many non-smokers or `` anti drug people '' follow this subreddit . 
  i understand that . 
  the `` cashier was n't helping the situation '' was referring to how she got hung up arguing about with the customer when she could 've just said `` ok , your total will be : ( whatever greek salad costs ) '' . 
  at that point the customer has the choice of paying or leaving , which are both better for everybody else than a pointless debate about salads . 
  can someone post the gif from op 's post, 
  moralfags gtfo, 
  jelly, 
  yeah and a lot of `` dealers '' are just normal guys who buy a little extra to get it cheaper, 
  you still have to see all the trouble so i do n't see why he should smoke the customer up . 
  they both have weed and/or money so of course they pitch in 50/50, 
  lol was n't that hard . 
  just spam the typhoon balls and shoot her while she 's recovering, 
  you can use the typhoons when she 's charging at you and she 'll be knocked back by the balls if timed right, 
  yeah i mean to each his own but just because i like to play video games and watch tv does n't mean go around saying `` i do n't need painting to keep me entertained '', 
  tl ; dr do what you want , do n't be a dick about it, 
  how do you know the stoned guys not jerking off too but just more cool about it, 
  or the other guy is high as well, 
   i do n't understand the need for the open top, 
  i think open tops are a reason in themselves . 
  this is way too awesome, 
  all good then . 
  nice painting, 
  at first i thought this was a postal reference . 
  works either way i guess . 
  and neither is chopping wood in skyrim . 
  besides doing anything `` for the gold '' in skyrim is retarded since the system is broke and pretty soon you 'll be an all powerfull master of everything anyway and throwing away gold rings because none of the merchants have any money left so it 's not like it matters . 
  horses are n't worth it in skyrim . 
  they 're only slightly faster than you can run and if you have the restoration perk that also heals stamina you can sprint indefinitely . 
  also you wo n't have to get down from the horse every 30 seconds and the horse is n't starting unnecessary figts or just running off every time you look the other way . 
  i use to have a horse until i decided it could go suck my dick and actually after a while it shops following you . 
  never killed it or anything . 
   that was just a particularly good year . 
  i do n't think there 's been a real drop off in quality in general . 
  yes it was but yes there has . 
  there are so many necessary perks and so few points i decided not to spend any on speech . 
  i have speech ranked up because it 's nice but i 'd rather spend points in combat skills . 
  indeed . 
  and the lack of variety . 
  every horse looks the same , i wo n't recognize my own even if there were only 2 horses standing next to each other . 
  not like in rdr where horses were the shit . 
  yes but in a movie it 's even more spoilery . 
  you ca n't stop the audience from seeing the poster on the background simply by not mentioning it and also there 's was less time to get the story told in a movie so everything unnecessary is cut . 
  once you see the poster you know what 's going to happen . 
  if you 're finnish . 
  i 'm glad i pirated it with the original title before seeing it on tv . 
  also it 's the `` key to escape '' part after her name that spoils the most . 
  just because the movie was n't a documentary about how to break out of prisons does n't mean i want to get the story spoiled . 
  i have bad memories from notebook . 
  when i lived in the u.s and it was a new movie this chick came over to watch it with me . 
  after like 10 minutes i jokingly said `` so let me guess ; this guy is also that guy and x is y and this and this will happen '' . 
  she got so mad and started yelling at me how i 'm a party pooper and she never wants to watch anything with me again and stormed out . 
  so i guess my guess was right , i did n't bother finishing the movie . 
  either way i 'm calling it predictable and boring . 
  and she was a bitch . 
  loosely translates into : pekka and p\u00e4tk\u00e4 as niggers . 
  the 13th and final movie in the pekka ja p\u00e4tk\u00e4 series since the actor of p\u00e4tk\u00e4 killed himself shorty after . 
  it 's about two jazz musicians who nobody takes seriously so they decide to paint their faces with shoe polish to pass as respectable american black musicians . 
  ca n't make this shit up . 
  i do n't know how much it has to do with being older . 
  i also think the 90s movies were better than the 80s or 70s or well heck any time before that . 
  in the 90s we had the big budgets and action of modern times while movies still had an edge . 
  think about movies like se7en ( spoiler alert ) . 
  brad pitt and morgan freeman in a movie where the killer not only murders the main characters innocent wife but also fills his prophecy and `` wins '' . 
  no way that would happen any more in any hollywood movie . 
  there would had been a timer that stopped 2 seconds or just as kevin spacey was about to shoot we 'd hear a gunshot but it did n't come from his gun and we see spacey fall down shot in the back by pitt or any other lame way to get the tension that something bad is about to happen without it actually happening . 
  you know to not risk the box office income . 
  i do n't know what this site is but they seem to have a pretty good listing . 
  i 'll just leave this here .
