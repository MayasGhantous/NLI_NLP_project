  they just changed the name in the last minute but the responses are still the same . 
   nintendo hell , where they bleed their characters for all the nostalgia they can get, 
  so wait , i 'm in nintendo hell ? 
   version 1.6 : september 12 , 2003, 
  i remember the same bug from when cs switched over to steam . 
  9 years apparently . 
  also what kind of a teenager/anyone who lives with their parents has his screen to the door ? 
  home is the one place where i do n't want to contain myself, 
  all the time . 
  never got caught as long as i lived there . 
  haha i was actually just thinking about de_airstrip . 
  i guess that was the map i was playing when i first learned about steam or something because i always get flashbacks of it when i think about cs 1.5 / steam coming . 
  god damn riot shields . 
  basically how it works is whichever player goes to the ball first will assume the `` default position '' for air balls and then defend his footing against opponents . 
  the best place to be is about 1-2 feet from the `` default position '' towards the source of the cross . 
  of couse it depends on the spin and the players etc. 
  but `` one step closer '' is a good rule of thumb . 
  you do n't need l2 . 
  just run in front of the opponent and keep leaning on him so he does n't get any closer . 
  when the ball is nearing take one step ahead and time your jump/header right . 
  it 's not something you can really explain , you just have to keep trying until you get the hang of it . 
  helps if you practice it with a team that has a tall striker . 
  signed up, 
  yeah i 've heard putting cheese on broccoli is actually pretty common in america then again putting cheese on anything is pretty common in america . 
  but why would you want to ruin the delicious taste of broccoli with cheese ? 
  all it needs is a bit of melt butter . 
  the city i live in went nuts with those white boards that connect to the computer so you can view power points and shit and add little notations with a special `` marker '' . 
  the things cost a ton , they put them into every classroom in every high school , middle school and even some grade schools and none of the teachers use them because they suck dick . 
   a lady who neglected a lump on her breast for various reasons, 
   never had a chance poor thing, 
  yes she did, 
  nipples are awesome though, 
  i play mostly h2h . 
  i did n't understand your question . 
  well we 're talking about a tiny dab of butter . 
  at least according to google you 're supposed to pour cheese over the broccoli , not just add a tiny swab in one corner . 
  besides who said anything about healthy ? 
  e. the guy i was responding to apparently did , but then again he did n't mention butter . 
  i do n't think finesse affects headers . 
  i might be wrong as well though . 
  well playing with light armor is something i 'd ever consider in any video game . 
  however it seems i must do so at some point to achieve maximum rank . 
  we also had these overhead projector type devices called `` document cameras '' ( direct translation ) . 
  it looked just like an old fashioned one but instead of using those transparent slides it had a camera where the mirrors used to be so you could use normal copy paper and any pen . 
  the device would then photograph the paper in real time and relay that to the projector in the roof . 
  now those were actually handy . 
  if you wanted you could put a newspaper article under it or a picture or your hands or anything . 
  main advantage was that you could write in a normal position with any pen so teachers were able to write fast yet still comprehendable text . 
  good for you , sport !, 
  but you 're not being sensitive !, 
  shut up now . 
  rape is worse than murder . 
  because it is . 
  unless you 're a man . 
  men ca n't get raped . 
  that would be nice . 
  i do n't understand why they made the horses so slow if you ca n't even attack while riding . 
  it 's purely for transportation but goes just barely faster than you run . 
  why are you making a problem out of thin air ? 
  i never said ** every american eats their broccoli with cheese ** . 
  i said it 's ** `` pretty common in america '' ** to pour cheese on broccoli . 
  am i not correct ? 
  at least i 've heard tons of references to cheese & broccoli in american literature and movies . 
  i 've never seen in any other country dispite traveling quite a bit . 
  it was just an observation . 
  not everything 's an attack against your national heritage or something for gods sake . 
  my `` good for you '' actually meant `` good for you '' . 
  depends how much weed i have . 
  when i have tons i like doing anything high and i can be a `` productive stoner '' ( well i still wo n't be very productive tbh but at least i 'll get some stuff done ) . 
  if i have less than a few grams everything changes though . 
  i do n't want to `` waste '' any of the high doing mundane tasks . 
  in those times i get all chores etc done as fast as i can and set up everything i might need while high ( drink already in glass , another cooling outside the window , xbox turned on game loaded and paused or movie already in with the correct subtitles etc. 
  cushions properly placed , blanket ready ) i want there to be absolutely nothing i have to do once i toke so i can just enjoy it fully . 
  so the more ( false ) copyright claims they make the more international advertising they get ? 
  now how could that ever be exploited . 
   not one of my dealers i 've had would ever act this way, 
  how do you know ? 
  have you had some sort of hypothetical coming out conversations ? 
  a lot of people with prejudices act just like anyone else and can be in fact very good mannered . 
  make him feel worse ? 
  do n't you know a grammar mistake is an instant pass to the front page ? 
  besides who feels bad about a grammar mistake they made in r/trees . 
  correcting grammar is not hate . 
  you should really visit 4chan some time . 
  what what what whaaaaaaat . 
  you did not just do that . 
  this is the same exact situation upside down yet you still figure it 's the somehow some unknown straight people 's fault ? 
  now i have nothing against gay people or homosexuality but it 's exactly shit like this that irritates people and certainly does n't help anyone 's acceptance . 
  like that new zealand website about spousal abuse where no matter which gender you played as or whatever you did at the end tha man was at fault . 
  that 's one of my most commonly used phrases when referring to someone outside the conversation . 
  i do n't see what weed has to do with it . 
  you 're going abroad for the summer ... and you want to work ? 
  what the fuck dude . 
  you got some issues . 
  it was selfish of me to masturbate when i lived with my parents ? 
  oh you silly americans, 
  there 'll probably be another bus in 20 minutes, 
  what . 
  the . 
  true , but black soul gems are rare to come by,
