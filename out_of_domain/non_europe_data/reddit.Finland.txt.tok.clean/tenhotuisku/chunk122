  on the downside as a kid some relatives send you one present for birthday and christmas :(, 
  you never thought about it ? 
  when i was a kid playing the usual `` which super power would you have '' pro sports is all i thought about , 
  to be honest you can scratch the `` when i was a kid '', 
  i went to firenze only a few months after ac2 came out and i was surprised that all the buildings actually had those rings and bricks sticking out etc. 
  that in the game only felt like added shit so that you could climb more freely . 
  if you were a climbing/parkour pro firenze really would be like in assassins creed . 
  well snoop dogg was arrested for posession in sweden when he played in stockholm . 
  luckily it 's only a small fine or something so who cares but still pretty funny . 
  that 's not so much a scumbag move as a funny prank . 
  friends play pranks on each other . 
  probably the tenth time i 've seen this link, 
  ipad ! = mobile device meaning just because the ipad is a piece of shit does n't mean every mobile device is . 
  my girlfriend has an ipad as well as a few of my relatives . 
  i have around 10 hours of personal ipad use experience . 
  oh but i 'm uninformed , right . 
  besides how can stating simple facts be uninformed behaviour ? 
  or did they add usb and a 16:9 screen to the ipad in the last couple of days without me realizing ? 
  and why would i be biased ? 
  i own a macbook , i own an imac and several ipods . 
  clearly i have nothing against apple . 
  or is the `` biased '' just a standard defense mechanism for anyone who spent their money on that garbage . 
  oh wikipedia . 
  shoulda known, 
  well nobody 's saying freshly baked bread with simply butter is n't delicious . 
  it 's the amount of butter that 's horrifying people . 
   please feel free to provide said `` simple facts '' . 
  `` the ipad is a piece of shit '' is not a fact . 
  `` ipad ! = mobile device '' is not a simple fact . 
  were you referring to the fact that you correctly identified it as a 4:3 screen ratio as `` stating simple facts '' . 
  you 're clearly well-informed about the product , my mistake . 
  here you go, 
   a 4:3 tablet with no usb , mmc or flash, 
  these are facts . 
  of course `` a piece of shit '' is n't a fact . 
  it 's an opinion largely based on these facts . 
  and i think 10 hours is plenty of time to try out a device . 
   the `` why '' is irrelevant . 
  the bias is obvious and pathetic . 
  to be bias should n't i have some other brand that i idolize and/or hate the company that makes the ipad . 
  neither one is true . 
  not everyone who disagrees with you is biased . 
   clearly i have nothing against apple, 
   except the absurd and ignorant rants against ipads . 
  i do n't see how ranting about the quality of ipad is an `` exception '' to having anything against apple . 
  i still like many of their products . 
  this one i do n't . 
  everyone 's always talking about how dreamcast was too advanced for it 's time . 
  it had a shitty controller , that 's why i chose playstation . 
  not because it was `` too advanced '' . 
  i already forgot what the original post was about, 
   of course `` a piece of shit '' is n't a fact . 
  it 's an opinion largely based on these facts . 
   `` largely based '' , huh ? 
  thanks for admitting your opinion is based on superficial , useless spec cherry-picks , and not on any of the relevant differentiators . 
  you 're really trying too hard . 
  it 's largely based on those three facts . 
  there are other factors as well . 
   it 's largely based on those three facts, 
   so let 's get this straight . 
  it 's a `` piece of shit '' based on a 4:3 screen , no usb ( debatable ) , and no mmc ( debatable ) ? 
  and flash . 
  forgot about flash . 
  yes , those are the biggest reasons . 
  also lack of proper multitasking and software limited to app store etc. 
  the ipad has it moments too of course but sadly they 're rare . 
  viewing photos and simple internet pages is better than in any other similiar device i 've tried . 
  lastly there 's nothing apple or anyone can do about this but i just do n't like typing anything longer than a word on a touch screen . 
  good luck replying to an e-mail compared to a small laptop/netbook . 
  hijacking your top comment for link to more pictures of the event from [ the library of congress ] ( http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=auto%20polo ), 
  it 's not very specific . 
  it 's one of the most basic things in chemistry , i 've seen it in school from like the 3rd grade to high school . 
  it 's like knowing how to add and substract in math . 
  yes, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/trees+treecomics+stonerengineering+woahdude works as well, 
  just double click on any subreddit on the top bar . 
  you can set the subreddit it links to manually and the nickname of the shortcut . 
  you can add multiple subreddits with '' + '' r/trees + treecomics like so, 
  e. oh and in case you did n't have res yet [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://reddit.honestbleeps.com ), 
  \\  surrender, 
  \\  internet, 
  ctr totally copied mario kart ... and made it better . 
  i loved mario kart but ctr is the only go kart game we still pull out monthly with friends and it 's great . 
  you see my friend i 'm not here to `` win '' an argument . 
  this is not a game for me where i try to compensate for my shortcomings in real life . 
  i 'm not posting to prove you wrong or make you change your mind . 
  i 'm simply stating my personal opinion on ipad after using it for some time and you 're trying to turn it into some kind of competition where you cut my posts in 10 pieces and add some smart-ass commentary . 
  you actually think there is a winner in an online argument about personal opinions on a device . 
  now that 's sad . 
  middle button -  settings -  preferences -  voice -  play through speakers, 
  works like a charm . 
  i own none of the games you listed , my gold 's about to run out and have around 40 dollars total for the rest of the month so it 's not like i 'm swimming in a pile of money . 
  you 'll probably find someone who needs this even more but i 'd be happy to receive it . 
  reddit is one of the bitchiest sites on the internet . 
  it 's always filled with complaints about sexism and equality etc. 
  makes me sick just being around you fags . 
  yeah i only read like five of your page lenght responses and not ten . 
  it 's my opinion . 
  i 'm not trying to prove my opinion is superior to yours . 
  i really do n't give a shit what you think .
