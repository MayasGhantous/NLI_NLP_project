  entire name ? 
  or more pics ? 
   drinking to excess, 
  who said anything about excess . 
  i stopped reading at this point . 
  i was talking about the alcohol culture . 
  not health statistics . 
  it 's an adjective here . 
  you can loosen up and `` lose a little control '' without having drunk `` too much '' . 
  well that 's an american definition of `` drinking in excess '' . 
  i do n't see getting drunk as having drank too much , it 's often the whole point of drinking . 
  drinking in excess is when you have drank ** too much ** and ca n't control your drunkenness . 
  i 'm not just talking about the laws . 
  for example when i was studying in the u.s we were taught in `` business class '' that often if you 're having lunch with a possible future employer they like to `` test '' you by asking if you 'd like a drink as well but you should always decline it because it shows responsibility or some shit . 
  where i come from if a man offers you a drink it 's almost rude to decline if you do n't have a proper reason . 
  it certainly does n't help you getting along with that person or your possible employment . 
  that was just a single example off the top of my head . 
  the alcohol culture is very different in the states . 
  especially when adults talk to younger folk . 
  it 's almost like a taboo . 
  well was n't i comparing cultures to begin with ? 
  i do n't see your point . 
  that 's not very great, 
  are people actually thinking that 's a note written by anyone 's mom ? 
  so why could n't you work hard while living at home ? 
  of course it is n't real . 
  i do n't think anyone was `` fooled '' by this . 
  yeah me too . 
  i have nothing against public displays of attraction but it makes me feel awkward if i accidentally look at them . 
  not that i mind , i just quickly look the other way . 
  where did he claim so ? 
  if you 're referring to the title it 's part of the joke . 
  there was another post like this titled `` 19 years old and i still get this every time she makes me lunch '' . 
  or the roommate just could n't sleep and was looking for someone to lash out at, 
  what 's the difference between poison and venom ? 
  weed has the total opposite effect on me . 
  i ca n't imagine dancing high . 
  vaping maybe but definitely not if i 've smoked some . 
  now beer on the other hand . 
  i start moving to the music before i 'm even feeling buzzed . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  of course some will take it seriously but if one posts a self-deprecating joke like this it is common to follow it with more jokes that make the same assumption the original did . 
  not to me it is n't . 
  if i enjoy a game i often beat it again ( on a harder difficulty ) . 
  i have 14 x360 games on my shelf . 
  9 of them are the kind you can beat . 
  6 of them i 've beaten at least twice . 
  tbh that number is affected by the fact that i trade away most games i have no interest in after beating them but still . 
  to me story in video games is like 5 % of the experience , even in single player campaigns . 
  gameplay is like 80 % . 
  i often enjoy beating games several times and hardest difficulty settings . 
  and let 's be honest . 
  it 's not like stories in video games are ever that good compared to books or movies . 
  oh so were through blaming rock 'n roll and the moving pictures ? 
  not trying to poop on your parade but that does n't sound like an especially high tolerance . 
  even if i took a two week tolerance break i 'd still have to smoke 1 gram a day or more if i tried to be high the entire day . 
  and a full bowl to get `` all the way there '' ? 
  that 's a pretty vague description but it sounds pretty standard . 
  you smoke half a bowl to get buzzed and a full bowl to really get high . 
  that 's how it 's been with me and my friends for years . 
  not most but all of my friends smoke . 
  most are unproductive members of society . 
  like myself . 
  to be honest if i had a roommate like you i 'd just tell you to deal with it or move out . 
  of course common courtesy is always good but there 's a line when it 's just your own god damn problem . 
  if i 'm wearing headphones i 've done enough on my part . 
  learn to sleep in it . 
  hell in the city you hear louder noises from the outside all the time and i still get sleep . 
  i use download statusbar on firefox . 
  it adds a tine little thing on the corner and if i click on it it lists my downloads . 
  the thumbnail shows number of loading files & number of completed files so i know without clicking when my download is complete . 
  works pretty well . 
  yes i find that telling jokes and even the self-deprecating kind can be fun at parties . 
  i 'll be sure to cancel that invite then . 
  well i mean define hard . 
  it 's not hard to not smoke weed at all , it 's just not as fun as smoking it . 
  if you have any tips on smoking ( nearly ) every day ** and ** keeping your tolerances low i 'd be glad to hear them . 
  trust me i do n't waste any either . 
  i smoke only what i need to get high , i roll bigger joints/blunts only when to celebrate when i have tons of weed . 
  usually i smoke about 0.2 grams at a time . 
  but that 's the absolute minimum i need to even get high . 
  if i smoke less then i ca n't really feel anything and it feels like even more of a waste . 
  of course it varies on the quality etc. 
  but i 'm talking about averages . 
  yeah that 's why i pretty much need to have at least a few sober days a week . 
  otherwise it would n't work at all . 
  a whole week every now and then is nice too . 
  and gravity bongs  do n't know what it is but it works . 
  i usually play games on hard too but often times it unlocks an `` insane '' or `` veteran '' or whatever even more difficult mode . 
  also if i 'm not that familiar with the series or the genre i 'll opt for normal first just to see `` what it 's like '' . 
  also just to have a harder difficulty available if i choose to play through it again . 
  a lot of times i make the decision to go back and start on hard in the first 60 minutes though . 
  some games like vanquish are hard enough on normal that they 're fun to play again . 
  though i did beat it on hard too . 
  did n't even try the insane or whatever . 
  my parents are cool with it as long as i do n't smoke inside the house or car because `` the smell sticks to surfaces '' . 
  i was kinda surprised when i first got `` caught '' and that was their main concern . 
  actually i was pretty impressed by the speech my dad gave me . 
  about how experiementing is part of life and weed is fun and ok as long as you make sure it 's not the biggest thing in your life and you keep actively chasing your dreams etc. 
  i never imagined i 'd agree with my parents once they give me the `` drug talk '' .
