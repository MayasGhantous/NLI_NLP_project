  that 's some counter-strike shit , 
  cats dying in a garage ? 
  animal cruelty . 
  dogs and horses living out in the woods without seeing a vet and dying if they get sick ? 
  that 's nature . 
  i would n't consider not having a human doctor artificially lenghten their lives animal cruelty . 
  yeah but i 'm not browsing r/trees , i 'm browsing all my subscribed subreddits which is about 98 so only a few percent of the posts i see are from r/trees . 
  so when the top posts on [ / r/trees ] ( / r/trees ) are some random `` give me upvotes without content '' garbage it does n't leave room for many quality posts before i reach page 10 or something . 
  i 'd say there are quite many redditors who subscribe to more than one subreddit . 
  well it 's nothing like it was in bf2 before the fix that 's for sure :d, 
  and it only affected black ops which had a `` dive to prone '' feature . 
  it 's not in the mw series . 
  it 's not just north america . 
  northern europe ( scandinavia , germany etc. ), 
  uses honking the same way . 
  extremely rarely when somebody 's being a dick and/or in dangerous situations . 
  in southern europe they honk all the time but you do n't want to drive there anyway . 
  well it 's not like my day is ruined but i 'd rather enjoy quality reddit than browse crappy reddit . 
  i live in a nation that 's even smaller and also has a draft army but i do n't know anyone who 's been killed . 
  ooohh now i get it * removes downvote *, 
  in case you 're referring to the [ / r/adviceanimals ] ( / r/adviceanimals ) background there is no black dot there .

  i ca n't see it in firefox . 
  must be in the way browsers handle css or something . 
  because downvoting does n't solve the problem , it only hides it until another shitty post makes the front page . 
  we need to rid [ / r/trees ] ( / r/trees ) of this crap and for that we need to raise awareness and spark conversation . 
  it 's like giving the hungry man a fish or a rod etc. 
  firefox 11 on os x, 
  it just works ? 
  i would n't say faggy . 
  makes him look more like a lesbian . 
  a nice 3 button suit is still nice , but ** never ever ** button the bottom button . 
  well you 're browsing reddit . 
  what do you expect ? 
  the black ops `` dolphin dive '' is nothing really compared to the bf2 one so i 'll just explain that one . 
  in bf2 you could go prone and the character would lie down almost instantly . 
  you could also do this while jumping to `` dive into cover '' etc. 
  pretty soon people figured out you could jump , go prone , get up , jump , go prone ... extremely fast ( especially using scripts ) and shoot the entire time . 
  this resulted in people `` dolphin diving '' when encountering an enemy head on . 
  if you 're just standing still the enemy has your entire body to target . 
  if you 're floating horizontally in mid air he basically only has your head and shoulders to hit . 
  [ illustrated in this shitty drawing i just drew ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gpmig.jpg ) . 
  blue represents possible hit area or something you probably get the point . 
  e. [ here 's a video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ex5uzucztcq#t=17s ), 
   only care these animals get is food an water ? 
  their living conditions are hell . 
  i think it 's pretty clear she owned land where these animals roamed freely . 
  now if i had a house pet of course i would groom him and keep him healthy but for billions of years animals have lived on their own in the wild so i fail to see how `` only '' providing these animals with food and water is `` animal cruelty '' . 
  it was fixed . 
  it was awesome at first but it did grow old really quickly . 
  not buttoning the bottom button is universal age old wisdom though . 
  every boy should be taught that when they get their first suit . 
  southern europe ? 
  you know how our problem is mostly that people take speeding limits as `` general guidelines '' instead of strict limitations ? 
  it 's the same in southern europe , except with lanes . 
  yeah but sometimes you really do n't want to pass it that far but there is an opponent in the middle . 
  especially if the defender is to your side the options are rolling the ball with the risk of a striker or throwing it out of bounds . 
  yeah my grandpa fought in the war ( and he 's jewish , how messed up is that ) so of course i know someone that knows someone that died in it . 
  i 'm just saying it has very little to do with conscription . 
  yeah 3-button suits do tend to look `` not modern '' to put it nicely but if the cut and fabric and texture is nice and ageless i would n't reject a suit just because it has 3 buttons . 
  why are people downvoting ? 
  seems like this guy is the only one with actual relevant experience . 
  how could you not ? 
  i had to read the sentence twice until i understood what she meant . 
  that 's not even the kind you can blame auto-correct for . 
  no because there already exist stupid people who actually try and still hold everyone back . 
  not just north america . 
  i actually studied in the u.s for a year and you guys do way more work than us finns . 
  our work tends to be more difficult but still . 
  it 's there every time you load/save ( of course if you only ever use quick save you wo n't see it ) and i think you can see it somewhere in the inventory or skills menu or one of them . 
  if you have a horse he 's named after you as well and it 's displayed each time you mount it . 
  op is on ps3 though ( no quicksave ) so i doubt he actually did n't remember his name . 
   does anyone have a map that shows who actually has control over those regions, 
  i think that 's an issue too complex for a map, 
  how can you be so butt hurt over a few horses living wild in the forest ? 
  while on the subject of crappy mw3 guides . 
  i was googling sitrep pro in case there was any good advice how to unlock it quick . 
  i came across this :, 
   the sitrep pro effect is also fairly useless . 
  increasing the sound of enemy footsteps really does not help all that much , as the sound of footsteps does not really indicate if a person is in front of you , behind you , above you , or below you . 
  yeah . 
  and this guy is is selling his advice for ** only ** $ 37.99, 
  this is not america . 
  she 'd probably get medical bills worth and maybe a few thousand for the pain . 
  getting hurt is n't like winning the lottery outside the states . 
  yeah you 'd think they would be extra careful during the last 10 seconds . 
  especially when they 've just been asked to check the clock 15 seconds prior . 
  i do n't know what kind of technology the nhl uses but it ca n't be that difficult to press a button on time . 
  did you know he plays with a long stick ? 
  yeah that 's what the announcers said but i could n't see it change direction in the replay . 
  there was no super x slow-mo to be clear though . 
  you 've seen what called icing in other games ? 
  i do n't know if this is relevant but such a thing as no touch icing exists . 
  it 's not in use in the nhl but pretty common in international hockey . 
  something about a watch and 60 minutes and preparing . 
  it did n't make much sense without mute either . 
  google proxy server list or free proxy or whatever . 
  pick an american one . 
  if you 're using firefox go to settings -  advanced -  network -  connection, 
  paste the proxy ip and port,
