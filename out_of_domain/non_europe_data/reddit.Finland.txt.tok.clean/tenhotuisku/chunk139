  i 've always been more of a long sightlines kind of player ( i rarely use a sniper but assault rifles , especially mk14 ) and did n't like how many mw3 maps were just cqc clusterfucks . 
  actually i just checked my k/d per map from elite and it seems my three highest maps were overwatch , black box and liberation . 
  though it 's probably also affected by how i had already played the game when those came out . 
  when i was a kid i always dreamed of getting an m5 . 
  now i 'm an adult and realize i do n't really need a car and the maintenance and parking in a city would just not be worth it . 
  still i want that m5 though , maybe if i win the lottery . 
  yeah it 's a shame . 
  especially when cod is still the without a doubt the best in it 's category . 
  it just could be so much better . 
  i know yours was a joke reply but while we 're on the subject i 'll give you some personal experience . 
  when i was studying in an american high school ( michigan , 17yo ) they actually had a cop come over to the school and write me a ticket for having a tin of snus ( tobacco ) in my back pocket . 
  i did n't use it in class but it was visible through my jeans . 
  and because i was a foreigner i had to go down to the courthouse where a judge told me to play $ 50 . 
  now this stuff is just as illegal for a minor ( actually you ca n't even sell it anyone ( thanks eu ) so ** more ** illegal ) in finland but i had never had any problem even using it in class . 
  at most teachers told me to make sure it ended in the trash and not the floor/under my desk . 
  again not bashing but the way students were treated in an american high school felt very much like our middle school . 
  over here they treat you more like an adult by the time you 're in high school . 
  you can question or correct the teacher without getting detention ( also happened , twice ) . 
  it 's actually encouraged as it spawns interesting conversations . 
  if you skip class there is no phone call or detention , you might just fail your class which only hurts yourself . 
  tbh i have nothing to say to that . 
  after i heard what happened to iw after mw2 i have n't really been paying much attention on that level . 
  yeah in our school seniors and juniors were allowed to leave the premises during lunch break but sophomores and freshmen were n't and it was a small town so the cops would actually stop cars coming out of the school parking lot and check if there were any young kids they recognized on the back seat :d, 
  to this day it 's still probably the funniest/most pointless use of police resources i 've seen . 
  i love weed and try to smoke it as often as i can but i still downvoted your comment . 
  i advise you to think why i chose to do so . 
  [ a large one ? 
  i do n't think you understand `` sarcasm '', 
  because double standards etc. 
  but `` aloud '' ? 
  really ? 
   i do n't you you understand how to read . 
  get cancer . 
  good point !, 
  that 's the joke, 
  what is the american law like ? 
  is it theoretically possible to sue someone aged 7 for sexual harrasment ( or anything ) ? 
  where i live if you 're under 15 you 're not `` criminally responsible '' . 
  i admit the limit is way too high but it means you ca n't be either sued or punished before turning 15 . 
  you do have to cover for damages you cause though . 
  is there no limit like this in the u.s ? 
  strict, 
   `` hard drugs '' is a pretty worthless distinction when the one of the hardest , alcohol , is okay, 
  a lot of alcohol `` users '' are annoying as well, 
  what i find most bizarre in these stories is that it seems to make no difference whether the policeman was on duty or off . 
  when a cop is off duty he should act and be treated like a civilian , barring an emergency where they 're forced to act as a police ( witnessing a robbery for example ) . 
  a few months back i read a story about an off duty cop shooting at kids on the highway . 
  eventually he was charged with use of excessive force . 
  he was off duty , he should n't have been using any force , that 's attempted murder . 
   a huge amount of time of your education was useless, 
  newsflash, 
  yes because extremes are the only options, 
  i 'm genuinely surprised there was no photoshop in the comments, 
  these are all good points but there was actually a reddit blog post or similiar quoting actual visitors and registered users etc. 
  which stated that 90 % lurk , 10 % have accounts , 10 % of those ( 1 % of all ) ever comment . 
  i can try and find it but it was a while back, 
  that 's not a bad idea actually , i do n't remember the last time i used caps lock, 
  i do n't know why it 's whoosh but he 's got a good point . 
  ever since firefox updated to the `` awesome bar '' i 've barely bookmarked any sites because i use the bar all the time to visit any site i 've been to like certain wikipedia articles or subreddits or forum topics etc. 
  especially handy when there 's some great ( porn ) videos i saw briefly while i was in the middle of something else and want to watch again later . 
  and music on youtube . 
  i love recon pro so i put the otherwise necessary sleight of hand in my 1st kill and assassin after 3 . 
  you rarely need to reload before first kill anyway so it 's great . 
   complete challenges with all different set ups , even stupid ones ie ak-47 + thermal . 
  i have a lot of friends who do this but i do n't necessarily agree with that . 
  the weapon attachment challenges are only 1000xp . 
  something trivial like red dot on a weapon that does n't require it or extended mags is worth the little trouble for extra xp but i honestly think you get much more xp just playing a good game with a standard weapon than a couple lousy games with an attachment that simply does n't suit your weapon/playstyle . 
  yeah but you get those regardless of the attachments . 
  do n't get me wrong , if switching attachments wo n't affect your game ( greatly ) it 's wise to get those challenges but if it 's something that just does n't work like thermal on mp7 it 's not worth it to force it and get those 40 kills maybe in 3 games when you could get 40 kills in one game with a silencer and gain all sorts of different challenges and points with kill streaks etc. 
  in finland it 's illegal to sit in the driver 's seat ** if the key is in ** and your bac is over the limit . 
  and like australia it 's not illegal to drink while driving , as long as your bac is not over the limit . 
  and drunk driving is part of the general `` crime law '' not `` road laws '' so it does n't matter where the car is . 
  i do . 
  rarely / b / though . 
  you can use the dashboard clip thing and make this a widget , then drag that widget out of the dashboard into your desktop . 
  i know it 's not the same as a wallpaper but it should work pretty well too . 
  actually i think americans are the only ones with `` teeth smiles '' . 
  when i look thgough my fb friends ' pictures most of them are smiling but rarely anyone show any teeth . 
  now if i look through my american fb friends it 's all teeth everywhere . 
  personally i do n't even know how to smile with teeth . 
  my best attempt looks like somebody is stuffing something up my ass and i 'm trying to act like it is n't happening . 
  pistol in every single class except one `` worst case scenario '' blind eye/stinger class . 
  the pistol is necessary for me . 
  not only do i get a lot of pistol kills but it 's so much quicker to pick up guns and the way i play i 'm constantly picking up guns . 
  if i try to play with a stinger it 's so easy to get killed while switching weapons . 
  i do n't consider leaving / r/atheism to be acting high and mighty . 
  i 've been an atheist since birth . 
  i unsubscribed from / r/atheism the day i joined reddit . 
  in fact it was one of the main reasons i registered ( that and r/politics , i 'm not american ) . 
  exactly . 
  i would never call the cops on a friend no matter what they did . 
  that 's simply not something you do . 
  except if they 're hurting your other friends/you . 
  even then i 'd first talk to them and avoid involving any authorities as long as possible . 
  that 's why ski masks exist . 
  unlike csi would have you believe the police do n't actually have resources to do sophisticated 3d fist models or dna testing on every single crime . 
  while i appreciate your zen-like calm approach there are times when violence is indeed the best option . 
  i 'd still probably try to talk to them first . 
  and even then i 'd call social services , not the police ( though they 'd probably involve the police immidiately ) . 
  tbh it 's hard to say what i 'd do since i do n't have friends who i could imagine beating their child .
