  there are more than one way to `` master '' a dish . 
  this looks and sounds like a pretty good combination . 
  plastic bottles are the basic foundation of entgineering though . 
  yes i know they wo n't last and yes i know they can be dangerous to your health but to me `` traditional '' engineering is when you have no papers and nothing to smoke out of and you macgyver a bong out of household supplies . 
  not with diamond drill bits and electric circuits but gatorade bottles and duct tape . 
  not that there 's anything wrong with the fancy planned out self-made bongs . 
  they 're great and i 'll upvote every submission but these `` ghetto bongs '' as we call them in my native language are the roots of entgineering and what most of us started with . 
  what 's with the `` you ca n't use this weapon drop the kit '' ? 
  you can find pics like this for any country and they do n't tell shit . 
  our highway patrol has porsches and i 've never seen one irl . 
  most cop cars in america look pretty much like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yp9bjpaj4fs/tcgetb3xaki/aaaaaaaaad0/3bm1kyctboq/s1600/police-car1.jpg ) . 
  and no , this is not a competition and i 'm not bashing america or american cop cars . 
  women 's hockey is almost like a different sport though . 
  not hating , just stating a fact . 
  `` must have a vagina '' is not the only difference in rules . 
  making a joke is a far way from cheering or applauding . 
  just to be clear . 
  top 5 comments as of now :, 
  * an elephant never forgets , an elephant never forgives . 
  * stomp stomp fuck you, 
  * note to self : never stay at the hotel hotel, 
  * i just hope the guy deserved it !, 
  if not ... 
  i feel pretty bad about uploading this . 
  * i 'm confused as to why the man is naked, 
  if you ca n't take jokes maybe you better stay off the comment section of reddit . 
  yeah it was pr : vietnam but why is it showing that message ? 
  you 'd think any soldier is capable of firing a simple rifle , or was there some secondary weapons that required some special skill ? 
  it does n't look good ** for an xbox360 game ** . 
  and even mw3 looks a lot better with the same engine . 
  my point is your pics are just as far away from reality as op 's, 
  have you tried hardcore ? 
  i do n't believe smoking from a plastic chamber is bad , it just tastes bad . 
  but if the bowl/downstem is plastic it might melt a bit and the gases released then are bad for you . 
  shittier places but even those shittier places are usually ran by western companies . 
  not necessarily american but often they are . 
  then again i 'd presume there are still worse companies than ea in places like china or india . 
  if you do n't like bank of america there are like a hundred different banks out there . 
  if you like battlefield there is only one publisher to buy it from . 
  i typed in bold because i already wrote the exact same thing in my above comment but he managed to ignore it . 
  you do n't have to go to 3rd world countries for those . 
  ok yeah that 's a good point . 
  still though i blame the governments and the governments solely for the bail-outs and their effects . 
  if i invest badly , i pay the price . 
  if boa invests badly , they should pay the price . 
  a business is supposed to make profit , of course they 'll accept free money , that 's why i do n't think they are the ones to blame . 
  taking risks as a private company is completely acceptable , tax payers bailing you out after you take too much risks is n't . 
  what if i want to visit that one really good video i saw 3 months ago ? 
  i 'm not going to hide my porn watching from myself . 
  that 's not the freedom our grandfathers fought for . 
   you 're not going to get much better on six year old hardware . 
  this is not a counterargument for `` this game looks bad for the console it 's on '' . 
   stop pandering to less skilled players by giving them crutches and rewards for not making an effort to improve . 
  what rewards are you referring to ? 
  you mean deathstreaks ? 
  i do n't like deathstreaks either but it 's not like it 's something a bad player can rely on to do good . 
  for three deaths you get one easier kill ( and sometimes not even that ) , i would n't say that takes away the incentive to get better . 
  i agree . 
  not to mention i actually enjoy the single player campaigns . 
  treyarch 's have never been as good as iw 's but still i 've played through them at least twice ( hardened then veteran ) . 
  mw1 and mw2 sp campaigns i completed around 10 times total . 
  yes they do n't make a huge effort improve but god damn it they 're still always one of the most entertaining releases of the year . 
  screwed over ? 
  sure it 's not a masterpiece but i enjoyed it . 
  for 30 $ two months after launch it was/still is well worth the price . 
  now if you 're a pc player i better understand what you mean , from what i 've heard . 
  do n't actually know anyone who has mw3 for pc . 
  the final stand in mw3 is something inexcusable . 
  the way you are immune to shots ** while you are able to fire ** . 
  it 's simply horrible . 
  especially in hardcore . 
  you land 4 shots in your opponent and he 's still just laying there and shoots you twice killing you . 
  while i do n't use support i think it 's a good thing . 
  i 'll much rather have noobs running and gunning and capturing flags than sitting in some dark corner hoping they 'd finally manage to get a kill streak . 
  especially the emp . 
  if there are multiple support guys they can easily block out the other teams killstreaks with much less effort than it took to obtain those kill streaks . 
  remote sentry does n't do shit ( at least in core ) so i 'm not too worried about that . 
  personally i have no problem with the stealth bomber . 
  i think it 's good there is at least one offensive kill streak in support , after all support is designed for team work which is crucial for winning and i think the players should be rewarded . 
  also because despite it 's name you can hear it like 8 seconds in advance and cover is rarely further than that . 
  how about those commercial `` space tourism '' flights ? 
  they 've already started those , right ? 
  the hole would probably suck air so hard that it 'd put out the fire instantly . 
  specialist is the best . 
  i love combining sitrep pro and dead silence . 
  also recon pro with guns i 'd usually need sleight of hand with . 
  pick hardline and get sleight of hand after 1 kill . 
  you rarely need to reload before 1st kill anyway . 
  my grandfather lost his right arm and hearing from a soviet grenade . 
  but you can doubt all you want . 
  i 'm a troll now ? 
  you 're the one suggesting mass murder immidiately when i just bring up that not all people are identical intelligence-wise . 
  people of european descent have a distintcly different genetic make-up from africans . 
  europeans cross-bred with homo neanderthalensis who had superior intelligence and use of tools etc but were not as gregarious as home sapiens and did n't breed as actively which proved to be their downfall . 
  homo neanderthalensis never went to africa , their dna is purely homo sapiens . 
  there have been multiple studies about this , many by credible historians and universities . 
  i remember one published just last year . 
  surprise surprise only a few magazines had the balls to release the news and even less of a surprise is they got angry letters because of their `` racism '' . 
  for publishing a scientific study . 
  the gif and the original scene were always ruined ( to me atleast ) because of bad that check is .
