  but neither is dying and loading when you know you could beat that part easily just by mashing pause and stacking up 200 health potions ( because every other potion is pointless ) . 
  i understand that , but given that every other street ad you see these days has a qr code and that this is a trailer ( an ad ) showing a qr code i would assume it has some meaning and not there just because in the future this is how they catalog weapons . 
   and to them it appears as ancient as the 19th does to us makes sense . 
  no it does n't . 
  i was born in 1990 . 
  to me 1980 's or 70s does n't seem as distant as 1920 's . 
  did they ever live in the same century as 1990s ? 
  do people measure time simply by centuries and ignore the last two digits ? 
  19th century feels a long ago because when i was born it had ended 90 years ago , not because the second digit is different . 
  come one these kids will live in a world where they watch movies from the last century , their siblings/friends ' siblings might be from another century , they 'll watch reruns of tv shows from the last century and hear music from the last century every day . 
  hell if they 're poor they 'll wear clothes from the last century . 
  there was n't much of a connection to the 1800 's when i was growing up . 
  well most wapanese still understand our letters . 
  are shapes more language-neutral ? 
  maybe . 
  but they certainly are n't easier when you 're discussing games in three different languages . 
  because in each language they 're different where as the letters stay exactly the same no matter what the rest of the sentence is . 
  we were outside . 
  nobody held on to the dog . 
  the dog came to us and after the initial surprise it intentionally kept sniffing the smoke . 
  it 's not like we forced it . 
  it was wagging it 's tail and even chasing after the smoke clouds like if we were playing . 
  after that she displayed no negative signs , maybe a bit of hyperactivity like when she was a pup and is still alive and healthy . 
  why is it suddenly bad just because she ca n't speak ? 
  exactly , i 'm 100 % with you . 
  science ca n't prove anything does n't exist . 
  that 's why people claiming something exists have to come up with the evidence to prove their theories . 
  not the other way around ( assuming something exists until it 's proven not to ) . 
  yeah and that `` everything is wonderful and we should hold hands and never say anything mean '' usually goes over by the time you finish college . 
  seriously , people ** can ** look and act like idiots and if they do it 's ok to laugh . 
  only if it 's purposeful/by choice of course , there 's nothing fun about disfigurement or disabilities . 
  no it would n't . 
  it 's perfectly ok to like ale . 
  i know a lot of girls who enjoy a quality beer , and not because it 's `` different '' . 
   ales generally being viewed as neither a young person 's or a girls drink, 
  what ? 
  i get the `` girls do n't drink beer '' stereotype but since when have ales not been for young people ? 
  soo . . not that bad , huh ? 
  it 's not like she 's a regular smoker . 
  or even an occasional one . 
  she inhaled ** second hand smoke ** once . 
  i 'm willing to bet eating every single thing she comes accross and racing after minks because she 's an idiot are going to kill her before that smoke does . 
  one misconception i hate the most is the `` dogs ca n't eat chocolate '' . 
  yeah i know eating copious amounts of cacao beans can be dangerous because they lack the ability to digest it or something , but people think even the smallest amount will kill their dog . 
  if you drop a herseys kiss on the floor it 's not a disaster . 
  one time our labrador got into the kitchen after we had baked cupcakes and they were cooling off . 
  she ate 12 very large chocolate cupcakes with chocolate bits in them . 
  she even ate the papers :d nothing happened except a large poop . 
  soo . . what do young brits drink ? 
  other than `` the cheapest '' because that 's obvious in any country . 
  i feel this is a serious matter and needs to be investigated thoroughly, 
  it 's rare to see quality beers in clubs etc though . 
  one of the main reasons i rarely go to them , that pisswater they serve is definitely not worth the 6 $ . 
  to get good beer you have to go to the certain quality pubs or `` beer restaurants '' . 
  there are a few more outgoing bars with live rock bands that take pride in their selection of beers . 
  but none of these places tend to have any women :d, 
  yeah i knew it was going to be a joke when the first two words were `` a real patriot '' . 
  seriously i wonder how these people survive in the real world/any other website where jokes are not explained by the username . 
  fucking novelty accounts . 
  it took me ages to realize why you 're agreeing like you 're arguing . 
   we do n't love our government . 
  they are slimy bastards . 
  do n't feel too bad . 
  my country is often chosen as one of the `` best places to live '' and least corrupt . 
  we hate our government as well . 
  they are slimy bastards as well . 
  with all the secret bits in black ops and zombies etc. 
  i think it 'd be foolish to disregard a qr code in a release trailer for a game like this just because the military has some uses for them as well . 
  look at the way it stands out . 
  the whole animation is as if to show it off . 
  it just seems unlikely treyarch would show a qr code this clearly in a trailer and have it not mean anything . 
  you can send it to me via pm . 
  i promise not to tell anybody or creep behing your window, 
  seriously though you 'd be a babe for any age , let alone 50s . 
  i think he 's calling out to jorg\u00e9, 
  combine that with impact and it 'd be totally op . 
  even now i love using impact with recon pro and getting a good share of my kills through surfaces . 
  it was my favourite gun in blops as well . 
  now my favourite by far is the mk14 . 
  to op 's question : despite what stats say the main problem with m16 is it feels impossible to get a kill with one burst . 
  type95 usually kills with one burst unless the enemy is far away . 
  that 's the key difference . 
  speaking of counter-strike have you tried playing specialist and combining sitrep pro with dead silence ? 
  i 've seen very few others do this but it can be absolutely devastating ( i also use recon pro , assassin and a silencer with this combo ) . 
  had to google your definition of qq ` ing . 
  to me qq ` ing has always been the same as `` yy'ing '' meaning switching the weapons back and forth quickly ( q switched weapons in counter-strike ) . 
  including a perk that increases bullet damage is like removing one of the perk categories because there is absolutely no reason to use anything else . 
  so no . 
  i liked how in black ops the equivelant of assassin did n't help against blackbird ( equivelant of advanced uav except even better because it was in real time ) . 
  would n't work in mw3 though since auav is a support reward . 
   hardline is close, 
  this is how i can tell you 're a noob . 
  except for specialist hardline is pretty pointless . 
  it 's just as easy getting an 11 kill streak as it is getting 12 . 
  and a lot easier to get 12 with a perk that actually improves your character than 11 without it . 
  because it adds nothing to the conversation , and downvoting posts like that is pretty much the point of downvotes at least according to reddiquette . 
  i 'd play the shit out of that playlist . 
  i was just thinking how much better this game would be without snipers . 
  or at least without quick-scoping . 
  ca n't understand why they a. did n't remove it b. made quickdraw affect sniper rifles .
