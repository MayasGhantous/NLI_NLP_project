  i 'd say everything over 20yds away counts as a long shot . 
  not that i celebrate every goal from over 20yds away like crazy . 
  30ish is when they become `` spectacular '' and start to feel great . 
   do n't control any of your back line on defense . 
  only use your cm/cdm to chase the ball around . 
  i disagree . 
  i always control my cb 's simply because i do n't want them to get out of position like they usually do if they 're ai controlled . 
  now just because i control the cb does n't mean i use him to chase the ball . 
  i use secondary pressure to chase down the ball carrier and only switch to the cm/cdm when it 's time to steal the ball ( since it 's much more effective manually ) . 
  yes it is . 
  cod does n't require you constantly going to an inventory of hundreds of items or switching between 10 blocks in your hotbar . 
  yes they 'll probably simple it down for xbox but when it comes to minecraft that 's not a good thing . 
  i play with man city which has a lot of tall strong players . 
  also i 've found an extremely effective way to kick the corner . 
  it 's actually so good it sometimes feels like an exploit so i only do it once a game/if i 'm down a goal . 
  are you actually able to create your own corner formations ? 
  i 'd love to do that since the cpu does n't always place the players in a way that i 'm able to perform this `` signature move '' . 
  i took 3 courses of latin in high school . 
  no regrets , easy points . 
  common sense and science . 
  that house is great in every way . 
  with an mk14 you can defend both sides and the alleyway . 
  if someone comes inside ( the bottom floor ) they make a distinct walking on wood sound . 
  wow . 
  best pic of nessa ever . 
   his k/d was over five, 
  pics or did n't happen, 
  i only shop at stockmann . 
  up until a few years ago i thought clip-ons were a joke . 
  like a prop for slapstick comedies . 
  i had no idea people actually wore them . 
  i guess they 're more popular in america though . 
  having a mall cop ask you why you were helping a child is not the same as jail . 
  i 'd still help the kid , but mainly because i 'm not a neckbeard assburger who ca n't express himself so i probably would n't end up in questioning for 45 minutes . 
  or maybe because i 'm not looking for a juicy story to tell the internet . 
  it 's not much of an insult , i have nothing against actual homosexuals . 
  it 's that even heterosexual swedes act like the most stereotypical gay people you can see in fashion tv shows or something . 
  it 's not the penis in the butt i have a problem with , it 's the overly dramatical act . 
  i do n't care how many women you 've fucked that shit is annoying . 
  especially when most of the time it seems `` faked '' as hell . 
  eveything has stereotypes . 
  does n't mean they 're accurate , i know most gay people do n't act like `` stereotypical gay people '' . 
  which also does n't mean that the `` stereotypical gay '' act is n't annoying as fuck . 
  i do n't really care what the correct technical term in your mind should be and i 'm not intending to offend any gay folk . 
  this type of behaviour just happens to be associated with gay people , thanks to tv and movies . 
  `` let 's play _____ '' is a popular title on youtube for gameplay/commentary videos . 
  i guess he makes those . 
  possible repercussions from taking the girl to an info booth on an airport ? 
  you do understand that there are always cameras on an airport , right ? 
  and besides what kind of a shitty kidnapper would take the kid to an info booth ? 
  possible overreactions/stupid reactions causing you temporary hurt of feelings ? 
  yes . 
  actual legal reprecussions ? 
  wow you had to talk to your mother without it being a national holiday ? 
  your life must be ruined . 
  if by weeks you mean years then yes . 
  reddit can fuck with your perception of time i know . 
  those 80 's maps with ussr work `` just fine '' as well . 
  a couple minor flaws but we do n't want to waste tax dollars do we ? 
  all the girls i 've ever had serious relationships with came from rich families . 
  never had to worry about things like this . 
   you 'd wonder what kind of shitty kidnapper would take the kid to an info booth , but the woman and the cops in the op would n't wonder that . 
  do n't expect all people to be as logical about it as you . 
  and it would be the first thing i 'd say to them , thus forcing them to wonder that . 
  there 's nothing wrong with criticising idiots who put clothes on their dogs . 
  also assuming reddit is better than anything is stupid . 
  not a cameo , he 's actually a recurring character, 
  also that carpet bit was priceless, 
  oh i get it now . 
  i never knew people can be allergic to weed . 
  makes sense though i guess you can be allergic to anything . 
  idk about soft euros , in any european league he 'd get jumped . 
  this is just iihf . 
  ticket prices are handled by the national hockey federation . 
  sweden slashed it 's prices day before yesterday , finland did n't . 
  instead they 're offering buy 1 get 4 ( yesterday it was 2 for 1 ) for certain matches that are `` lower quality '' ( fin-fra , fin-kaz ), 
  and throwing out fans protesting the prices ( to be fair they removed all blankets/signs `` not supporting a team '' ), 
  more of the one on the right :, 
  my team has no north american imports but i try to go to the games as often as possible and i can guarantee you you would n't get away with that . 
  though i admit my team has always carried a repuration of `` north american '' style that fans love and opponents hate . 
  this means hard hitting , plenty of forecheck and foremost standing up for your teammates ( i.e fights ) . 
  quote from wiki :, 
   one of the major influences to hifk was the nhl veteran and stanley cup winner carl brewer . 
  hired in 1968 as a playing coach , he advocated a north american style of play which has persisted in hifk since . 
  brewer 's influence to the way hockey is played in finland led to his posthumous induction to the finnish hockey hall of fame in 2003 . 
  exactly . 
  and even if you 're afraid of your parents for some reason they 're sitting a couple rows ** down ** . 
  who the fuck looks behind him in a movie theater ? 
  and nobody dare post that jean reno gif, 
  when i was 14 my parents had no problem with me kissing a girl . 
  then again even when i was 14 i went to the movies ** to watch a movie ** . 
  if i wanted to make out i had plenty of places to do it without paying $ 6, 
  no it is n't . 
  and secondly our right wing parties would be left as fuck in america . 
  even in the uk . 
  50 % milk, 
  50 % coffee, 
  haters gon na hate, 
  do n't worry , it 's bullshit . 
  the vasa sank because the king wanted to show off his guns ( of which there were too many in the first place ) and water got into the gun holes or whatever they 're called .
