  like / r/gifs and r/reactiongifs get the same fucking gifs reposted every other day and it feels like they always make the front page . 
  now if it 's something you 've seen once or twice some time ago hide is the better way to go . 
  you do n't need any of those for link karma , just look at my submissions, 
  yeah i admit the sub seems to be that way for most people . 
  personally i just look for new reaction gifs to post on forums etc , i do n't really care about the one time joke in the title . 
  but like i said that 's just me . 
  i just started studying computer science so i 'm glad to know my choice is reddit approved from the highest level . 
  yeah but still the law would impact legal ownership a lot more than illegal owners . 
  and guess which ones are more often used for crime . 
  soo ... what are the changes ? 
  do you have headphones ? 
  if not , get a pair . 
  they make all the difference in cod ( any fps game to be honest ) . 
  have you ever seen an mlg or any other even semi-pro player play without headphones ? 
  when i was a kid and counter-strike was the shit no one would even consider playing it without headphones . 
  that 's just something you did n't do . 
  these days that culture seems to have disappeared or dimished ( probably greatly due to the shift from pc to consoles , headphones are standard with pc but very few use them with their tvs ) . 
  nevertheless they still make an enormous difference , especially when paired with perks like sitrep pro or dead silence ( or both specialist ftw ) . 
   blast shield will be buffed for hardcore . 
  really ? 
  i already thought it 's pretty damn effective . 
  i hope they do n't make it like black ops where a nade could literally fall in between your legs or you could run straight into a claymore and you would n't die if you had flak jacket , even in hc . 
  i disagree completely . 
  nobody taught me how to play games , i learnt it myself . 
  in an age where games did n't even have tutorials . 
  and i had no problem doing it . 
  if you 're too distracted by a flashing light in the distance to see the huge press rt to fire you ca n't blame the game developers . 
   blast shield in hardcore has zero effect on explosives as it is built currently in mw3 . 
  what 's the source for this ? 
  i often use blast shield in hc and it seems to make capping objectives a lot easier . 
  without it someone always throws a blind semtex that lands 15 feet away from me and kills me , not so with blast shield . 
  the first mandatory class we had was called `` basic programming '' where we learnt the basics of java which i 'm writing on the right side of the screen right now . 
   java is a ** programming language **, 
  i hope they do n't copy the black ops system . 
  that 91 % was so op it was ridiculous . 
  and i used flak jacket all the time , core and hc . 
  key word being `` nobody '' . 
  most people will still continue paying , either because they do n't know how to pirate or because they have a moral problem . 
  it shared the same slot as ghost ( assassin for bo ) in black ops as well . 
  tbh i never understood why these `` invisible in the uav '' perks are as popular as they are . 
  i get the appeal but people act like they 're the best perks in the game . 
  i do n't know linus torvalds wrote linux while studying computer science in the same university as i and also there 's a huge variety of courses to choose from , a lot of them being strictly programming . 
  i think i 'll do fine . 
  in black ops each player could choose an explosive , a tactical nade ** and ** an equipment , so yeah . 
  he really does . 
  especially considering how big he looks on ice . 
  yeah i do n't think the make up job for the picture on the left was really that good . 
  on the right she looks like if she put any make up on she 'd be way hotter than the one on the left . 
  even this way it 's like 50-50 but the hair wins it for me . 
  skin blemishes go away eventually anyway . 
  it 's not even a good `` plasticy '' pic . 
  if [ this picture ] ( http://blindgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/annalynn-mccord-1.jpg ) was on the left for example then the parent comment would have a valid point . 
  i realize reddit is very liberal . 
  it 's still a lot more than nothing . 
  how many ( no matter how biased ) sites following news from any european country do you browse ? 
  true , but she still probably looked better on the photoshoot than in that red carpet pic . 
  because at least to me that pic is pretty horrible . 
  well i never said european redditors have a complete understanding of american politics . 
  i simply said it was better than most americans ' idea of european politics . 
  who said anything about natural hair ? 
  `` may have '' in the title or a title ending in a question mark -  ignore . 
  stealing ? 
  it 's not the same as stealing , and your definition of stealing ( getting something that someone else is paying for , for free ) is pretty weird . 
  what about give-aways , am i a thief if i get a free game while others go to gamestop and pay for it ? 
  but yeah i 'm not one of those people who try to justify pirating , i understand it 's morally wrong , i admit i 'm guilty . 
  it 's just that i do n't really care . 
  so they hate you for being male , not for being gay . 
  that makes a lot more sense . 
  i understand everyone has their own prefernces but is the popular opinion ( just look at the upvotes ) in america really that tomato soup is good ? 
  it 's funny because where i 'm from tomato soup is something we threaten kids with . 
  `` if you do n't start acting it 's tomato soup for dinner '', 
  `` you can have either this or tomato soup '', 
  not only my mom but our daycare `` teachers '' as well and talking about it afterwards it seems to have been pretty common . 
  is it really moving or am i just imagining because i have homework to do ? 
  so did you take advantage of the amazing offer by gamestop ? 
  `` bring in an xbox slim 250gb and get star wars xbox for ** only ** 199 , - '', 
  yes i 'm being serious . 
  my emblem is boobs . 
  boobs are great . 
  i like boobs . 
  tbh even if most of them are stupid i think custom made emblems are a thousand times more interesting than the identical emblems you see on mw 's . 
  [ in case you really want to know ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8kvr7yi_ki ), 
  if someone who you do n't know for sure about asks you `` do you smoke '' i 've found the best answer to be `` no i do n't smoke cigarettes '' . 
  seems perfectly innocent if the asker does n't smoke weed but if he does n't he knows what you 're saying . 
  my favourite smoke shop has no rules like this . 
  i 'm not saying other shops are stupid for them because i understand them wanting to minimize risks but i also enjoy walking in and just asking shit like it 's any other stoner i 'm talking to and not having to watch every word i say . 
  yeah well i 'd still rather get jumped by two bigger guys and get beaten than by two guys with a gun . 
  and it 's nice not having to wonder whether these guys are carrying one or not . 
  haha homo means gay, 
  i might be an inconsiderate asshole towards guerillas but if i had a kid and brought him to a zoo i 'd let him play with the guerilla baby as much as he wants . 
  yeah it might be against some zoo regulations but come on , that shit is ** amazing ** for a kid ( tbh it 'd be amazing if i got to play with a guerilla ) . 
  i suggest [ this one ] ( http://images.wildammo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/handshake.gif ), 
  well yeah of course but it 's not like the rest of the players do n't wear pads, 
  here have a slight tap, 
  good point, 
  i know i know . 
  it 's 7am and i 'm still up , brain farts tend to happend at this hour . 
  i can see you 're new because you still have the stamina to answer all the comments . 
  that 's a good thing btw , we 're just used to op 's never delivering . 
  if this leads to at least one teenage/preteen boy seeing tits i 'm proud of 4chan .
