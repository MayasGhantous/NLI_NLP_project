  god 's work i tell ya . 
  i do n't know though , as inappropriate as it may be he/she 's got a point . 
  i wish that would had been me and i 'm not even in high school anymore . 
  yes because the joke is clearly about the rape . 
  come on mensrights , now you 're pushing it . 
  for a long time this sub has started to sound like one of those feminist circlejerks just looking for ways to get offended . 
  boy raped ? 
  serious mr worthy content . 
  a joke about a city name in the article ? 
  who gives a fuck . 
  do me !, 
  do me !, 
  i 'm a long time apple user who absolutely hates the iphone , what am i , like northern ireland ? 
  tons of long shots , deadly corners . 
  i score more than 1/3 of corners , and because i shoot a lot there 's plenty of them . 
  5 star man city, 
  4 star colombia, 
  3 star finland, 
  if he 's good looking reddit gets angry because she 's only interested in looks, 
  if he 's fat reddit gets angry because she 's only interested in money, 
  you really think the message here is `` do n't marry a guy with education '' ? 
  `` but emotions produced danger '', 
  `` i guess somebody watched equilibrium last night '', 
  maybe not but pp equals peepee which comes out your weewee, 
  we do n't dub any of the programs if that 's what you 're asking . 
  all the shows are broadcasted in the original language ( usually english ) , you just have to tolerate the subtitles ( although you can remove them from certain channels ) . 
  most popular american tv shows are shown here as well , usually a bit later though . 
  this can mean days for shows like conan or even a full year for dramas etc. 
  proxys and vpn are legal . 
  no it makes sense . 
  especially in southern europe they dub everything and it sucks if you 're stuck in a hotel room or something . 
  i think our way is actually pretty rare but i 'm sure glad someone somewhere a long time ago decided it was a good idea . 
  while people may not learn english simply by watching tv it still familiarizes us to the languge . 
  i 'm no scientist but i bet this is one of the main reasons almost every finnish person speaks at least `` ok '' english , compared to places like france or italy . 
  growing up a lot of kids ( like me ) used to put tape over the subs and just try to listen . 
  maybe it 's some sort of inverted causality deal because where i live colleges are free and we have full-sized desks, 
  and yes i just made that word up because google translate did n't help . 
  why do you have people like that for friends ? 
  yeah well those people do exist but they 're a tiny minority . 
  at least when i was in school we were given this image of a `` stereotypical drug user '' who pushes drugs onto others . 
  tbh in my mind if you give into peer pressure you have no one to blame but yourself . 
  not that i 'd pressure anyone but `` he pressured me '' is a shitty excuse . 
  i think it adds a nice modern touch . 
  cliffs and trees are so 1800s, 
  no it would n't . 
  does n't mean it 's not true . 
  full qwerty is a must, 
  my tv growing up did n't have teletext :(, 
   i did notice though that all children 's programming is dubbed , if it 's of foreign origin . 
  not all but yes children 's programming is the only kind we dub . 
  and this is ** goddamn bullshit ** . 
  i do n't have a tv , even if i had i would n't watch yle . 
  the only radio is listen to is bassoradio and even that 's via internet . 
  why the fuck do i have to pay yle . 
  i need physical buttons . 
  i can write extremely fast with my phone without looking either at the screen nor the keyboard . 
  these days i can write full lenghts sms 's and send them without proofreading and most of the time there 'll be 0 typos . 
  thus making it even easier for us ? 
   first off , the dlc is shit anyway ,, 
  what makes you say that ? 
  the dlc maps are ** way better ** than the original maps which had almost no long sightlines and were just adhd akimbo bullshit . 
  maybe not worth $ 15 but definitely not shit . 
  i do n't snipe and i love liberation . 
  i have tried it on my sisters samsung . 
  it was better than using iphone but still light years away from my e71 . 
  i 'm not going to buy a touch screen phone just for the off chance that if i keep using it long enough it might be as good as my current , which i still do n't believe btw . 
  i 'm pretty damn fast with my phone . 
  i pay the police in case i need them , i pay kela in case i need them , i pay for hostpitals . . you get the point . 
  i do n't see a scenario where i would be fucked if it was n't for yle . 
  indeed it is . 
  thus allowing us to have a better idea ( not a complete picture ) with much less effort than you guys . 
  nobody 's blaming you for not knowing what goes on in here , i 'm just simply saying how it is in practice . 
   you 're unwilling to try . 
  maybe because it costs like $ 500 to try , jackass . 
  that 's the joke . 
  you bring in a new xbox slim 250 and pay two hundred ( euros in this case ) for the same console with a different paintjob . 
  no it should n't . 
  i 'm perfectly fine with the fifa12 crowd . 
  but it 's not the hardware 's fault it looks like crap . 
  i 've had many ipods and all of them have served be great . 
  none have broken , i 've just upgraded . 
  in some maps i change around but if it 's unlocked i use mk14 over 90 % of the time as well . 
  it 's the best weapon in the game hands down imo . 
  i get accused of `` modded controllers '' all the time as well . 
  i guess i have a pretty fast trigger finger , i do well with pistols too . 
  you really missed out if you only started playing demolition in mw3 . 
  because they royally screwed up demo in mw3 . 
  used to be my favourite game mode , now i ca n't even play it . 
  in mw2 or black ops the spawns would be pretty constant , one side for defenders , one for attackers , like in ctf . 
  the bomb site would be somewhere a little closer to the defenders than attackers . 
  in mw3 the spawns are like tdm . 
  as an attacker you might spawn ** right next to the bomb site ** . 
  i 've literally spawned less than 10 feet from it , pretty easy to get a plant . 
  or as a defender you might spawn on the other side of the map behind the attacking team . 
  it makes absolutely no sense and i 'm genuinely mad at iw for managing to fuck such a simple concept up . 
   i think there is a way to combine this . 
  leveling up/challenges was great , but so was unlocking things in the order that the player preferred . 
  not really . 
  after a while you have that one attachment that 's the best and you just simply choose that for the first unlock , after that you do n't even bother checking the menu for new unlocks . 
  kony is n't a thing outside the u.s.
