  infinity plus one, 
  playstation = playstation, 
  playstation 2 = playstation, 
  playstation 3 = playstation, 
  xbox = xbox, 
  xbox 360 = xbox, 
  xbox 8 = xbox, 
  that 's how i roll, 
  oh yeah i see them now, 
  do n't forget about the [ $ 100,000 bill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/large_denominations_of_united_states_currency ), 
  no it was 9gag, 
  do n't like gifs ? 
  [ here 's a jpeg ] ( http://de.academic.ru/pictures/dewiki/69/erected_and_flaccid_penis.jpg?rescuing%20teens%20from%20polygamy ), 
  also i never said i did n't like books . 
  i 'm reading a book right now . 
  all i said was dictionaries in printed form are kinda pointless these days . 
  actually this was on r/nsfw _ gif ( or r/nsfw _ gifs i always get those mixed up ) yesterday . 
  e. http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw_gif/comments/ly12y/the_reveal/, 
  i guess the original source is gonewild : http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/lwr4u/the_reveal_gif/, 
  so you 're saying it 's easier for me to carry around a large book everywhere rather than check the internet which is not only on my computer but on my phone as well ? 
  interesting . 
  you can ask for the money on saturday , you can ask for it on monday . 
  i doubt it 'll make a huge difference in your economical situation . 
  it 's just a douchy thing to do asking for money on a mother 's day ( or their birthday for that matter ) . 
  so i should get a dictionary and stop using my phone because someone else somewhere else on the planet does n't have a smartphone ? 
  interesting . 
  seeing as how you are commenting on reddit i thought it was safe to assume we both have access to internet, 
  i bought it too but the servers were down/horribly slow ( it was on reddit front page at the moment ) so i pirated it and got it full speed ( 10mbytes/sec ) . 
  but it 's ok because i still paid , right ? 
  this could happen even without that rule though . 
  a lot of times in soccer overtime is not golden goal but `` classic '' meaning 30 minutes regardless of score . 
  so if you 're only up by 1 at 90 minutes you might consider 30 minutes for 2 goals an easier feat than 1 goal in the remaining seconds . 
  could n't it be theoretically possible though , exactly because golden goal is not used ? 
  if up by only 1 and 92 minutes into the game or something you might want to score an own goal and try for two goals in the overtime , since golden goal is not used . 
  dogs are like the best thing while high . 
  granted they 're pretty awesome nevertheless but especially if you 're high . 
  males do n't get searched or what 's the logic here ? 
  even though they ca n't open it they can still confiscate it and take you downtown where they 'll probably do some x-ray shit or something . 
  not saying this is bound to happen each time and it 'll probably work `` on the scene '' but if they do indeed decide to see the trouble and investigate it will be able to open it , if not by other means then by court order . 
  and at that point you could be fucked with the `` traffic by post '' just because they 're angry you wasted their time . 
  i 'm pretty sure they can confiscate the letter based on the smell which makes it a bit harder to move . 
  also never underestimate the trouble some cops will go through to bust marijuana users, 
  i meant it as in confiscate it as evidence until they get the warrant and then press charges, 
  why are there [ ones `` as of may 18 '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lfvmh.png ) already up ? 
  also why was finland behind slovakia at may 13th after beating them but suddenly jumped over u.s in the latest one after losing to them 5-0 ? 
  what are these !, 
  while phaneuf is great in the nhl it seems that year after year they keep picking him yet he 's the player most lost out there on the big ice . 
  i do n't know if it 's speed or what he lacks but his level simply drops so much from the nhl . 
   do you guys think this hit deserves 5 + 20, 
  nope, 
  yeah i 've had cops tell me to `` put that bong away before we get any more angry calls '' as well but that does n't mean there are n't cops out there who hold the law to the smallest detail . 
  http://i.minus.com/iboh8lgka3chxo.gif here you go, 
  oh yeah it does say 2008 at the top . 
  you 're right this was the first result on google and i even tried clicking to the front page and back to `` power rankings '' to see i was n't in archives or something but apparently i never left the `` 2008 site '' . 
  how about franzen cross-checking the russian who was looking elsewhere well after sweden had scored a goal ? 
  or do we forget his dirty after the whistle plays because he got his nose broken ? 
  good point, 
  while i never condone spearing franzen should 've gotten the exact same penalty for initiating the after the whistle scrum after his own team scored . 
  well at least he got his nose broken . 
  that 's russian karma for you . 
  or how they 'd obey the red lights but completely ignore the player if he 's stopped for a red light . 
  they 'd just ram right into you . 
  and then the cops would shoot you for the fender bender . 
  3rd line has 33 characters . 
  the bullet that should be there does take up some space though . 
  either way you ca n't have a definite number of characters for a font that 's not monospaced, 
  how is kazakhstan so poor if they have such a big oil field ? 
  i followed him more closely while he played for the flames . 
  i just did n't want to upset any fans :p, 
  that 's ... terrible . 
  it really depends on the teammates you happen to get . 
  sometimes it 's amazing , most of the time it 's shit . 
  if you have a group of friends with fifa12 ( or just find some redditors or others to play with ) there is a mode called pro clubs where you also control a single player but instead of random teammates you play for a `` club '' ( anyone can start one ) and there you can have actual teamwork . 
  yeah i got fed up with the ranked pro matches pretty quick too . 
  these days i only play custom games with my pro in the team . 
  you can control the entire team but still rank up your pro . 
  it 's great fun . 
  actually i was down like -3 when i complained and then went up to around +3 where it 's now . 
  i 'm genuinely surprised . 
  might as well remove that line now though . 
  i think famas and galil were the two best weapons in the game . 
  technically famas might 've been a bit better , but i tended to do better with the galil . 
  might have something to do with how i 'm a long sightlines kinda player . 
  do n't know for sure since i have n't really looked at any damage drop-off charts or anything . 
   a really good gun in each category , like , one ar that is clearly the best, 
  no , no , no . 
  not bests and worsts . 
  different characteristics fitting different situations . 
  balancing firepower with worse iron sights and reload time etc. 
  in an online game having one gun above the rest in each category just basically means there 's only 4 or 5 weapons in the game . 
  most importantly i hope there is no zero-recoil gun like the famas in bo or acr in mw2 . 
  they 're always the best and the most boring to use . 
  cod 1 & 2 had mp-44 . 
  the rifles were equally good though . 
   in 2004 , mls decided to eliminate overtimes for regular season games . 
  thus , there would be a draw if the teams were tied . 
  i 'm so glad hockey does n't have draws anymore even in europe/international games . 
  nobody likes a draw , both teams ( and fans ) felt like they lost . 
  overtime goals are awesome . 
  so what are these ?
