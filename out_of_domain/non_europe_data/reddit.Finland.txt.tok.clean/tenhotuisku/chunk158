  like deus ex where you could find parts and ammo for the silencer sniper rifle but only those who pre-ordered could use it . 
  if only there was a solution ... oh yeah right i already solved this by not giving a shit whether someone gets paid for an ad . 
  i 've used istat pro for about 5 years now as well but i dragged it off my dashboard into the desktop . 
  i have a 27 '' imac so there 's some extra space . 
  i rarely look at my desktop either . 
  that 's probably the worst photo compression i 've seen, 
  when did `` we '' agree to make all pictures self posts ? 
  that 's just plain stupid . 
  no point in restoring them while you still have years left on your contract, 
  haha that 's retarded . 
  there 's a reason reddit is designed to handle images and videos as link posts and text as self posts . 
  well not that i really care since i never post anything on this subreddit but still . 
   if you are thinking are cool or something and can watch it , just do n't . 
  it is n't cool to kill your own soul . 
  you must be new here, 
  i was talking about internets in general but i 'm glad everything 's working out for you, 
  til orange box is for osx . 
  i 'm still shocked that i can play d3 . 
  yeah i downloaded steam for mac when it came out but there really were n't that many available games . 
  at least back then . 
  last blizzard game i played was wc3 . 
  i knew about sc2 but literally never even thought about it while hearing diablo hype . 
  i was pleasantly surprised about 24 hours before launch . 
  now i want to know what he said, 
  i already had everything in the orange box long ago, 
   europeans are old enough to drink/use fake id, 
  this fucking gif has never had a perfect use because it sucks ass . 
  also the link is already purple . 
  well it 's good nobody 's really asking you . 
  founders of diablo ? 
  what makes you call mouse-movement horrible ? 
  i 've had no trouble with it . 
  to be honest playing this game with a keyboard sounds pretty terrible . 
  a pad would probably work . 
  though i 'd still prefer the mouse . 
  are you sure ? 
  i know the attack speed or attack bonus are calculated into the dps but poison also ? 
  so the actual physical damage from the weapon is the dps minus the poison damage ? 
   the diablo franchise has always been about the numbers - about grinding to get the best stats and the best gear . 
  exactly . 
  and the game 's only been out for a week . 
  of course it 's not fun getting one shotted by enemies , that 's why you grind for better equipment which make it possible to at least fight the inferno enemies . 
  ** you are n't supposed to be able to clear inferno the moment you unlock it ** . 
  by the time you finally have good enough equipment i guarantee skill will be a huge factor , it 's not just about numbers . 
  well if the dps shown in the base damage includes the + poison damage like you say then to get the `` actual '' base physical damage you would have to substract the poison damage from the total damage . 
  i do n't understand what you do n't understand . 
  i do n't think normal was reasonably difficult . 
  i did n't use a single potion or a health spell and did n't die once . 
  and it 's not like i was super 100 % focused during the entire time either , it was just really easy . 
  i know it 's diablo and normal has always been easy but this was just ridiculous . 
  especially considering it 's the only time i 'm going to bother watching the videos so there 's all this drama and build-up and then just zero challenge . 
  that being said i 'm loving the game so far . 
  nope me too . 
  before getting my own pc i hated playing simcity at a friend 's house because they would always want to fuck it all up with volcanoes and tornadoes etc. 
  why would i purposefully destroy something i 've put a lot of effort into ? 
  i still do n't get it . 
  i did n't disable the random ones but all the hundreds of hours i played simcity ( or cities ) i never ever clicked on the buttons myself . 
  besides it 's not like natural disasters are the # 1 challenge in the game . 
  balancing the budget and pollution and education and healthcare etc in a growing city is a much bigger problem than sending out 2 firetrucks every 4 hours of gameplay . 
  while i understand it to be more useful on a ranged character i still ca n't really understand how it 's painful to the wrist to use the `` stand attack '' . 
  i do n't much know about spreading the action , i have 7 buttons on my mouse so i have all 6 skills + stand attack macro on my mouse . 
  i give 99.9 % of commands via the mouse and it 's worked out great . 
  that 's what i love about diablo . 
   the problem that no one talks about is that inferno 's act 1 is not sufficient for gearing up for act 2 , and is hardly sufficient for gearing up for act 1 . 
  the people who got through inferno almost all exploited various chests or monster ai in order to do it , and as such they got to get items that the rest of us do n't have . 
  if everyone had played legitimately ... 
  see in my mind this is not a `` problem '' . 
  and we have different views of playing legitimately . 
  while i 'd agree with you in regards to most games i do n't see diablo as a game that you should be able to beat just going forward all the time without replaying any area . 
  i do n't see replaying as `` less legitimate '' . 
  i do agree however that playing long sessions should be awarded over quick runs of certain areas and chests but they 're already working on that over at blizzard . 
  just today i 've seen people killed and decapitated on reddit and those images did n't do anything but this keyboard actually made me gag a bit . 
  you had three different people in one day ? 
  how was it ? 
  because youtube needs your support, 
  thanks , si_bot !, 
  happened today as well . 
  except i was home and dry and sad about it when i smelt the familiar odor coming in from the window so i texted my neighbour . 
  everything went better than expected . 
  this was probably the most light hearted and at the same time best porn trailer i 've ever seen . 
  i just want to watch it on a neverending loop . 
  i do n't really get how mulism would be racist, 
   your eyes also become very dependent on them so if you choose to stop using them in the future your eyes will become even more red, 
  this is very true but people like me have little choice . 
  before i started smoking trees i never needed eye drops . 
  until i found out my eyes got red as hell from smoking . 
  so i have to put in eye drops . 
  but after years of active use i often have to use them even without smoking . 
  maybe not have to but especially in the morning my eyes get super groggy like never before and eye drops fix them instantly . 
  so it 's either use eyedrops smoking and not smoking , or have the worst stoner eyes . 
  i chose the former . 
  also ** a tip ** not mentioned in the original post . 
  when using your left thumb and index to whole the eye open use the ( left ) middle finger to balance the eye drop bottle . 
  so it 's held by both the right hand and the left hand which is supported by your head for a perfectly balanced tripod kinda way . 
  makes a huge difference . 
  the thumbnail looks like a porn gif but the link takes me to an image composed of diablo3 items . 
  wtf ? 
  actually i noticed this while browsing porn subreddits and kept getting sfw images . 
  no funemployment can save me from this . 
  there are ads on imgur ?
