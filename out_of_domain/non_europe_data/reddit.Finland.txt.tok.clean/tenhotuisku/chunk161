  i can boost my mf from 130ish ( with valor ) to 240 . 
  so far i 've managed to switch every time before the boss dies ( hell/inf ) . 
  diablo is especially easy because he stops moving and hitting before dying . 
  uncharted with a different artistic style and a npc escort . 
  might pick it up when it 's on sale for less than $ 10 . 
  tbh i think op 's being a whiny little bitch . 
  it 's not like he even specified a single real problem . 
  i do n't see drinking alcohol or doing coke at a trance gig bad behaviour in itself . 
  it 's like he 's shocked people use intoxicants at clubs . 
  people acting like assholes or puking on you - a problem, 
  you not being able to enjoy music because someone else is not sober - your problem . 
  from what i 've understood in the case of bosses nv affects the amount of loot from a boss , not the rarity . 
  ( non-nv ) mf affects the rarity . 
  i really do n't know for a fact , this is just what i read . 
  well i started doing this two days ago and i 've gotten a few items that were by far better than anything i 've gotten before , but it 's too early to say anything for certain . 
  yeah that 's what i meant by quality . 
  it does n't affect the attributes but improves the chances of a magic/rare/legendary / set . 
  you mean the chip shot or what are you referring to ? 
  eh , i get chip shots from outside the box all the time . 
  it 's really not that difficult . 
  pro tip : keep your eyes on the map . 
  now 2 from 32 yards out ... 
  i only played 1 & 2 but i also enjoyed them . 
  being like uncharted is not a bad thing . 
  although i 'm still very suspicious about a game that 's basically one big escort mission . 
  yeah and besides since when did we start caring about acting `` mature '' . 
  `` mature '' people do n't smoke weed . 
  they pay taxes and drink alcohol at establishments which pay taxes . 
  not sure if sarcastic, 
  [ another pic ] ( http://x.fap.to/images/full/46/211/2119122441.jpg ) do n't know source sry,

  i have no fucking clue what apple beer is i 've only seen somersby cider that looks identical and it 's actually pretty good . 
  sweet but good . 
  e . if you google for somersby apple beer you only find pictures of the cider . 
  [ apparently ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fterazpiwo.blogspot.fi%2f2012%2f04%2fsomersby-apple-beer-drink-carlsberg.html ) it 's another name for the drink to avoid polish import taxes or something . 
  it 's still cider if i understood that shitty translation properly . 
  yeah however the concept of `` dps '' is kinda odd in d3 since `` dps '' is not actually how much damage you do per second . 
  all my skills ( even the `` free '' one ) do a lot more than 100 % dps . 
  my friend ( or his mom ) has a vw phaeton . 
  2007 i believe . 
  it 's a nice car . 
  ims does n't count for sitrep pro . 
  trust me , i always play with sitrep pro so it 's the first thing i do when i prestige . 
  it has to be equipment , not killstreak reward . 
  turrets do n't count either . 
  for anyone having trouble with it i suggest rushing in ctf with emp nades . 
  always equipment around the flag . 
  hmm you 're right ims 's do light up . 
  i wonder why turrets do n't then . 
  they have also most likely watched television and gone to public school . 
  tv and public schools cause drug addiction . 
  not doing something just so you 're able to say you have n't sounds like the dumbest reason . 
  why are you downvoted ? 
  he 's actually confessed to not smoking weed ( not sure if it was an iama or just someone from reddit who met him and asked the question ) . 
  well i 'm glad i made your life happier but you really should n't hold your personal experiences back for the sake of trolling . 
  i 've always wanted that . 
  thief was pretty good . 
  and i guess skyrim . 
  so you 're letting alcoholism not only dictate his life but yours also ? 
  well suit yourself . 
  actually i believe alcohol is a pretty shitty drug . 
  i personally prefer others . 
  but i also feel alcohol is a substance that everyone should experience and be aware of it 's effects before demonizing it . 
  because most women ( who sound like that ) are bitchy . 
  yeah it 's not funny at all . 
  i scrolled all the way down these comments and still no cp . 
  you mean 9gag ? 
  or ebaumsworld ? 
  is it just me or did the `` from his bible study class '' in the first sentence make anyone else doubt the validity/biasness of this article ? 
  also why did police just keep showing up and beating him more and more ? 
  there 's like a dozen guys at one scene , what 's the point ? 
  i 've never heard of such site . 
  are you sure you do n't mean 9gag ? 
  numbers can get confusing . 
  ever since i 've had a car i 've wanted to do this . 
  was it as awesome as it sounds like ? 
  you can have sex legally at any time in finland . 
  it 's illegal for an adult to have sex with a 14-year for example but two 12 years old can have all the sex they want . 
  which is good because making teenage sex illegal for both parties is just retarded . 
  what 's supposed to happen ? 
  i see nothing out of the ordinary, 
  on the default settings it makes your screen so orange you ca n't see shit . 
  it 's useful around 5k though . 
  but yeah it does n't dim anything . 
  it 's not supposed to be used in full-screen applications like movies or video games . 
  i was talking about sentries . 
  though i can see how one would get confused as sam is the only one with the word `` turret '' actually in it . 
   edit : fixed for firefox, 
  i see it now, 
  actually smaller more skilled players have more of a chance now than they did at least 10 years ago , thanks to the rule changes ( no more constant slashing and hooking ) . 
  i saw an interview with selanne earlier this year and they were talking about how his rookie goal record is one of those nhl records that will probably never be broken . 
  his comment was `` well you have to remember half the goalies back then were semi-pro '' ( in finnish so something might be lost in translation ) . 
  and this was ' 93 . 
  trust me i 've tried it . 
  my eyes never adjusted to such a dramatic orange . 
  did n't matter if it was the slow 1 hour transition or if it was the first time i used the computer that day , i 'd always go `` what the fuck is up with the colors '' . 
  with 5k at night it just feels natural and less stresfull on the eyes without making every color orange . 
  i know and i might just be cynical but a grieving widow talking about how his husband was just coming home from bible study just sounds a little over the top . 
  might be true though who knows .
