  actually there was a major rule overhaul before and during the 04-05 lockout . 
  mainly because the league wanted more goals per game . 
  but you are right kahvakiekko was more prevalent in international hockey . 
  i feel jail is a bit too harsh though . 
  not because this is n't a a serious matter because it is , but because i 'd never do anything that could land my parents in jail and most people would probably agree . 
  illegal so the police/social services side with you ? 
  good idea . 
  prison ? 
  not so much . 
  you really have to ask ? 
  you mean shotgun shells do n't spread at a 90 degree angle and become useless after 15 feet ? 
  well yes they make the initial decision of course , but i 'm talking about reporting it to the authorities . 
  sending your mother to jail is something i doubt many people have the guts or will to do . 
  now you can translate that however you want , but this clip aired several times on canal + during this years world championship . 
  it 's a pay channel so i doubt i 'll find it online . 
  and it 's in finnish . 
  yeah it is http://urbaanisanakirja.com/word/molari/, 
  mola-rei ( plural ) - sta ( in this context `` of '' as in `` half of the goalies '' ), 
  molareista, 
  in older versions crosshair size affected the accuracy . 
  not anymore , but habit . 
  i do n't know i seem to run into quivers everywhere i go . 
  i have like 8 different good ones saved for when i maybe play dh :p, 
  with suits like that who cares ? 
  \\  on playstation, 
  \\  complains about connection issues, 
  would you care to take a guess why it 's always ps3 users talking about how live costs money while xbox users are just fine with it ? 
  because live works , and it 's totally worth the $ 3 a month just to avoid the shittiness the likes of psn . 
  also fifa12 is the best fifa since fifa98 . 
  my lag is usually 60-120ms . 
  what servers are you using ? 
  or a shitty connection/router ? 
  so ... where exactly is this ? 
  yeah i had to use satellite for a while when i was in the u.s, 
  worst system ever . 
  and download limits ? 
  in the 21st century ? 
  only `` read '' the first 10 pages none of which had understandable dialog so too hipster for me . 
  i 've heard of them in the us and uk but none of the isps here have dl limits . 
  except for some mobile connections but those are rare now too . 
  downvoted for speaking the truth, 
  used to be known as sage, 
  lol, 
  yeah i mean i joke about women all the time it 's not a thing to get pissy over . 
  this is a joke on facebook , who cares ? 
  there are actual problems to worry about instead of wasting time getting offended over something like this that 's never gon na go away . 
  me too yet here i am 20 something and unemployed . 
  i do n't think dead man 's hand is nearly as bad . 
  at least it does n't give the other guy invulnerability ** and ** ability to shoot at the same time . 
  it 's not so terrible in core but fucking last stand in hc . 
  i get 4-5 hit markers and he gets one so i die because he had last stand ? 
  or at least make it like in black ops where it would take a fraction of a second for you to pull out your gun while falling into last stand so there is n't that ~ 1 second window where you take 0 damage but can shoot ** with your primary weapon ** . 
  \\  becoming, 
  this actually makes sense . 
  yea i got the game at launch ( or the morning after ) and have played 120ish hours and i 've had connection problems maybe once or twice . 
  one time i could n't log in . 
  sounds like a pretty good reason not to play hc ( for me personally ) . 
  i hate games that have lives or whatever and force you to replay previous parts if you die . 
  i do n't see myself enjoying hc anymore than regular and i 'd be pissed when i die . 
  probably was n't his first character . 
  it 's real easy to skip most of normal difficulty with good gear and with extra xp you 'll be 60 in no time . 
  did n't play the 100 pins mode that much but i used to play a lot of regular wii bowling and after some time i developed a really consistent throwing style , using tons of spin . 
  it 's easier to predict than little or no spin . 
  i do n't see any other possible reaction http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/498/1300044776986.jpg, 
  you feel like a better person for stopping this karma misjustice ? 
  who gives a shit about karma . 
  i do n't go to / v / . 
  i had n't seen this . 
  i 'm glad op posted it . 
  yeah but i really , really do n't care . 
  it was a funny picture , no one did this picture professionally in an attempt to make money off of it . 
  it 's made to spread . 
  that 's internet and imageboards . 
  well i do n't know about that . 
  it makes more damage for sure but i die to last stand about 10:1 more than dead man 's hand . 
  sure it is n't as popular either but being someone who enjoys long distances dead man 's hand is mostly just a nice looking finish , have n't had real problems with it . 
  if i was someone who played by rushing with dual wield scorpions or something then dmh would surely be worse . 
  yup . 
  it 's pretty bad game design imo . 
  especially when i could do it with a little twitch of the hand while lying on the couch . 
  not me . 
  then i 'd log off diablo and play other games because i have no reason to come back to diablo since i do n't have my character any more . 
  there is no skill points to adjust or anything , i do n't see the thrill of leveling characters back to 60 as it will always be an identical experience . 
  i actually go to the other side more often . 
  the potion man who also fixes my shit . 
  i always assume the worse and that i totally underpriced it so this could only prove me wrong . 
  which would be nice . 
  yes, 
  i do n't think so . 
  at least at some point in hell he only had the shittier ones . 
  no runics or mythics . 
  i have n't checked since . 
  still sounds pretty bad, 
  having seen the e3 gameplay footage i 'm kinda suspicious . 
  are you joking or just have n't played the original games ? 
  conviction was a press x to win shooter . 
  it was n't bad but it had nothing to do with splinter cell . 
  in early splinter cells getting into a gunfight meant dying . 
  you hid bodies and shot lightbulbs . 
  yeah but i already have like 50-100 unwatched movies on my hard drive just waiting .
