  you 're wrong and you know it . 
  usb or a memory card slot on a tablet has nothing to do with nerdom , it 's main use would be to transfer movies and other files and to show and share the pictures or video you took . 
  and besides , i use the usb on my computer less than 10 % of the time i 'm on it , still a computer without a usb would be considered fucking crippled . 
  that 's a moronic argument . 
   they 'll email you the code to redeem , not mail you a card , despite making you confirm your shipping address . 
  so should n't you be able to just make up an address and receive it by e-mail or do they make you verify your identity somehow . 
  what do you mean by confirm ? 
  just click ok or what ? 
  me2 is way better than me1, 
  no i 'm not, 
  yeah but you can make a second accout to the live us , i already have one . 
  they do n't check it out or anything and a silver one is free, 
  because women 's hockey is a fucking joke . 
  not sexist , but it is . 
  let me give you an example , in the 2010 olympics team finland got the bronze medal . 
  about a month pior they played a pratice match against a boys `` c1 '' ( 15 and younger ) team . 
  not a junior national team , just some team . 
  the boys beat them 11-0 . 
  and this was exactly the same team that was the third best women 's team in the world . 
  this is not folklore , i can google the news story . 
  but it was n't really talked about that much seeing as how it was pretty embarassing for the whole sport and people generally do n't like to talk about anything that puts women in a bad light . 
  e. [ here 's ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/jaakiekko/2009120910751680_jk.shtml ) the news story [ and here 's ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.iltalehti.fi%2fjaakiekko%2f2009120910751680_jk.shtml&amp;act=url ) the google translated version , the national team is always referred to as `` lions '', 
  apparently the team played a bunch of matches against the 15yo boys as practice . 
  [ this here ] ( http://www.junnut.com/t1/lue.php?id=11019 ) story tells how they lost a match 17-0 and that so far they 've played 9 games losing every single one, 
  apparently the truth hurts, 
  you 're wrong . 
  it 's the same with court trials and presumed innocent until proven guilty . 
  shit does n't exist until proven otherwise . 
  no i do n't think so . 
  i love nice fake boobs but those things look horrible . 
  just like people who prefer natural boobs do n't have to love every pair of tits they see, 
  april cheryse, 
  it would be better if you had n't followed the `` think minecraft '' chart as accurately . 
  those birch threes look like shit, 
  best video i 've seen from the riots so far , thanks, 
  bolted on tits ( \u2022 y \u2022 ) big . 
  fake . 
  no mention that they should also be terrifying, 
  well shit, 
  apparently not but that has nothing to do with my original point that disliking these boobs in no way means you could n't enjoy this subreddit, 
  i 've played bc2 for almost 500h online , no problems with controls . 
  learn to play . 
  i loved hasek but every video on youtube about him was so blurry you could n't even tell where the puck was . 
  shit sucks . 
   these saves may appear like they take a lot of skill , but many other goalies would probably never be in a situation where they would have to make saves like that . 
  true , but those other goalies would n't make some of the amazing stops ( not talking about the kind of desperation saves in the video ) that thomas can because of his aggressive style . 
  never had a problem with sd hockey , and ca n't really understand people that do, 
  then again i did grow up watching hockey if not every night at least weekly, 
  yeah and music used to be better and clothing was n't stupid like with these young people nowadays and movies are n't as good anymore , besides whatever happened to kids respecting their elders and there 's only crap on tv anymore back when i was young . . 
  get glasses, 
  what 's the context ? 
  did you win a tournament or just proud to be american or what ? 
  you can do taxes online in english . 
  nowhere near manhattan , but yeah compared to rest of finland it 's pretty much the same as manhattan and the rest of the u.s, 
  my cousin pays $ 1700 a month for a 20m2 appartment in manhattan , and it was pretty cheap for the neighbourhood, 
  then again there is a reason for the prices , you do n't want to live outside of helsinki/espoo, 
  i 'm not saying hd is n't better , of course it is . 
  just that i 've never had any problem with the puck in sd broadcasts . 
  now online streams are another story . . 
  you mean like [ this guy ] ( http://www.gifninja.com/animatedgifs/58980/riot-fail.gif ) ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://uppix.net/9/7/1/6a5bff6d484bf89d8e320abc9f916.gif ) the same thing from a different angle , apparently the sauce is ctv news for that one, 
  i 'm guessing he still got pretty bad burns and just trying to play it off smooth/mixture of alcohol and adrenaline in his blood blocks the pain for a couple of seconds, 
  car interiors and gas/lighter fluid burn pretty hot, 
  way too much unnecessary text . 
  we can see it 's a car door and that you are touching it . 
  classic rage has as little text as possible, 
  older mspaints use bmp , do you think tid would have a top of the line os, 
  i wish i got 35 upvotes when i post an advice animal, 
  my real parents never do this but when i was an exchange student in the states my `` mother '' always complained when i was in my room and not `` socializing '' aka watching tv . 
  so instead of south park and funny pictures i was forced to watch local news and crappy sitcoms, 
  in our house if you want to save something for yourself you put a post-it on it . 
  otherwise it 's free game, 
  i 'm pretty sure you wo n't have such a positive attitude towards black men 's penis size once you drop your soap [ ] ( / rtroll ), 
  sights * [ ] ( / son ), 
  ** rules **, 
  * do n't submit things that are n't comics . 
  [ ] ( / son ), 
  i 've never listened to a song by bohemian rhapsody because i assumed them to be crap . 
  i googled this song to try it out and it was way worse than i expected . 
  i just listened to this song for the first time ( inspired by this comic ) and i hate it, 
  why would you be inside your neighbor [ ] ( / melvin ), 
  i used to have a `` 24/2 '' that was 12/1 ,5, 
  i switched my isp and now i have ( for the same price ) 110/5 that works at 105/5, 
  downvoted for censorship, 
  not that i 'd want to see his ass but it 's the principle, 
  it was, 
  350f 175c ~ 10 minutes, 
  i was surprised how well done it still was . 
  there was n't really much gooey raw dough , just soft and fluffy . 
  i suggest you buy some papers and tobacco ( not the pre-rolled cigarettes kind but you know what i mean , i 'm not american sorry :d ) and practice rolling cigarettes . 
  you do n't need to smoke them , just roll over and over again or give them away . 
  it 's great practice and even if you throw them in the trash ~ $ 5 for learning how to roll is not much, 
  i love how you get over 130 karma just for admitting your skin color, 
  very possibly the first animated . gif i ever saw on the internet, 
  too bad i do n't really give a fuck . 
  if you 're spending your time at feminist subreddits laughing at trolls on r/mensrights there 's not much i can do . 
  then again if that 's the case i doubt you have much effect on anything that i care about either . 
  this is such bullshit , trying to create conflicts whenever anyone says anything . 
  it 's not like he was trying to insult homosexuals . 
  besides , i enjoy practicing heterosexuality and even if i somehow did n't i would n't get offended if someone said to me i must get laid a lot .
