  i think the person over reacting is the fireman taking this into court in hopes of a quick buck . 
  where is that money going to come from ? 
  the same taxpayers that fund his fire station . 
  it 's different though . 
  i can barely tell the difference ( mainly smoother fps ) but a friend of mine has beat the game 105 % and according to him the difference is huge . 
  we still play the game at least once a month ( on ps1 of course ) . 
  maybe in c.s.i but not in the real world, 
  while these are very nice the only song i really want to find is the one they played between almost all the matches and immidiately after the final . 
  very `` battle musicy '' google translate tells me the word i 'm looking for is `` grandiloquent '' but i 've never even seen that word so . . 
  e. found it !, 
  at the time of posting and also right now the top comment is `` he 's a dumbfuck thug who just really wanted to play at being a bigshot that day . '' . 
  that 's not criticism . 
  that 's hate . 
  that site needs some sort of a `` how it works '' video . 
  i look at the product and read the description and i have no clue what it does and where . 
  when did britain invade finland ? 
  i 'm not arguing it 's incorrect but i 've never heard of this in history lessons . 
  i 'm so glad twitter never took off where i live . 
  honestly i do n't see the difference between twitter and status updates , why do i need two separate services for that ? 
  though it 's annoying when all the tv channels try to force it `` you can also send us questions via twitter ! '', 
  `` let 's look at some tweets '' then there 's like 3 stupid tweets and they have to read two of them out loud because they 're so `` up to date with interwebs 'n shit '' . 
  finland . 
  i do n't know anyone who uses twitter . 
  a lot of people have created an account when twitter hype was at it 's higherst but no one ever goes there . 
  complaining about cpu in rts ? 
  i seriously hope you guys are n't serious . 
  why in the world would anyone ever play an rts against a cpu opponent ? 
  i 'd rather not play the game at all if my internet connection was temporarily down for example . 
  this would take a lot of time to develop and in the end who plays starcraft 2 against cpu ? 
  maybe like 0.1 % of the players if even that . 
  waste of resources i say . 
  shaving *, 
  implying people actually do their homework right after school and not 30 minutes before deadline, 
  yeah but shaving ryan 's privates is actually an existing movie, 
  you can follow people 's status updates on facebook without them accepting you if they 've allowed it ( celebrities often do ) . 
   i 've never heard of a tv channel not getting inundated with tweets after a request . 
  generally , they get hundreds if not thousands of tweets , because some people will take any shot they can to be mentioned on tv . 
  maybe that 's because where you live people actually use twitter . 
  that 's true but i do n't think any of those battles actually took place on finnish territory . 
  well russian finnish territory but you know what i mean . 
  being able to force friendly fire is not good game design . 
  dropping shit on top of tanks feels more like an exploit than a counter to me . 
  i 'm not complaining if someone uses it as is since it is part of the game , but i definitely would n't mind if they added a hold fire command . 
  it requires micro to pull off and it makes more sense than tanks shooting at each other even if you do n't want them to . 
  not only does it make sense in a realism sort of way (  sc2  realism ) that you can stop your units from shooting friendlies but it i also like the possibilities it 'd add to gameplay mechanics and balance . 
  definitely a good suggestion . 
   you should strain the butter from now on , makes for a much better final product in terms of taste and consistency/dryness, 
  this is always included as an `` important step '' in almost any recipe but i fail to see it 's point . 
  weed cookies taste like weed anyway , i do n't really eat them for the taste . 
  maybe it 's just me ( i know it is n't ) but i hate the feeling of something possible going to waste . 
  so i just eat my cookies with the weed . 
   in 1897 an italian immigrant reinvented a napoletana staple food into one of the worlds most eaten foods . 
   reinvented, 
  pizza has been around for centuries if not millenia . 
  sure it was n't exactly like these days but leftover scraps spread on a dough is a very old tradition . 
  even the ancient greek had something that closely resembles a pizza . 
   although the word `` pizza '' was documented the first time in 977 in gaeta [ 1 ] and successively in different parts of central and south italy , the history of the dish itself are not very clear or well documented . 
  he has dual citizenship . 
  he 's not any less austrian , he just gained the rights that american citizens posess as well . 
  that 's no doubt a reason to celebrate . 
  asdf , your donation is now complete . 
  it 's just a few dollars but i 'm a college student myself and thus not exactly swimming in money . 
  anyway i had to support this sort of `` here 's a free game , please donate '' idea in a world where people left and right are simply asking for donations for nothing in exchange . 
  would be so much better without the last panel, 
  would be so much better without the last panel or simply if the last panel had no text . 
  http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/star-wars-blu-ray/14903/ first result on google . 
  i guarantee you the search term was shorter to type than your question . 
  it 's not even mildly interesting . 
  several percentages missing would be , this is nearly as common as the percentages adding up to 100 %, 
   and with even more than what we will ever pay in taxes . 
  maybe if you 're poor . 
  i 've definitely paid more taxes than my education was worth and will continue paying taxes for the rest of my life . 
  yeah i use roads too but that 's about it . 
  public healthcare is a joke in finland . 
  they basically put you in a waiting line long enough for either the illness to cure itself or you to drop dead . 
  either way problem solved . 
  what 's up with the censorship . 
  censoring words like `` ass '' makes it look like he was actually swearing . 
  like that `` unnecessary censorship '' skit some talk show had . 
  a few years back i had a sports injury and my leg basically tore itself off from my hip ( i could explaing this better if finnish ) . 
  i got rushed into the hospital and put into a wheel chair . 
  the initial doctor came in pretty quickly and gave me a diagnosis and sent me to the mri . 
  i wheeled myself across the hospital a few times because the first scan room turned out to be occupied and i got sent to the secondary where i waited a few hours only to find out that `` apparently there had been a double booking '' and that i could get another time to the scan ** 3-4 weeks later ** . 
  that evening i called my local private hospital and got an mri at 8am the next morning including a specialist analysis immidiately afterwards . 
  i 'm never going to a public hospital again . 
  keep in mind this happened in the ** richest ** county of finland . 
  it only gets worse the more rural you go . 
  especially with older people , my grandma would had had to wait months for her operation so she just got in done in estonia . 
   i would n't recommend anyone under the age of 18 smoke weed for the real clinical disadvantage, 
  there 's a big difference between 21 and 18 . 
  i 'm over 21 so i do n't really care but this law is still bullshit . 
  silly america with your multiple choice math exams, 
  learn to play . 
  the poke check was completely overpowered . 
  if you could n't play defense in nhl12 you 're just a bad player . 
  yes it was underpowered in 12 but it was still completely usable . 
  the 13 pokecheck is still more effective even after the nerf . 
  it 's pretty easy . 
  some places require you to get an `` alcohol & hygiene pass '' or something along those lines but not everywhere . 
  mostly the ones where you might end up handling food as well .
