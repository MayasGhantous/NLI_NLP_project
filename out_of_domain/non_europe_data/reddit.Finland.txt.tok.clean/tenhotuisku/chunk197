  challenge is killing gaming . 
  half of / r/wtf is like this `` graphic pictures of a man being beheaded with a dull knife '' what the fuck man how was i supposed to know it was going to be gross without a nsfl tag, 
  but why ? 
  well that 's all fine as you seem to have a reason for each software . 
  though i ca n't understand how someone working with software for a living would use safari . 
  here they 're like 3,5 $ so i just assumed it 'd be about the same in the u.s, 
  loose tobacco is cheaper than packs . 
  here at least . 
  though i get much more than 25 out of one bag . 
  hockey . 
  checkmate . 
  i think you 're confusing a joke with a serious complaint, 
  actually you are full of crap . 
  i use istarpro to track the memory usage etc. 
  at any given time ( it 's visible on my desktop instead of being hidden on the dashboard ) . 
  hidden applications use just as much memory as they always did , it makes no difference if it 's on the background or foreground . 
  do n't forget about the countries that still enforce mandatory military service . 
  for men only surprise surprise . 
  i do n't really understand why people in this subreddit assume she was being serious . 
  quoting a comedian ? 
  well must not be a joke then am i right ? 
  i study computer science so i 'm not completely oblivious to how memory works in a computer . 
  but i also know having little free memory significantly slowers your computer . 
  this i did n't learn in lectures but simply from having used a computer and os x. 
  before upgrading my memory i would often have only 200mb or so free if i ran photoshop along with other software . 
  every software worked slow even though technically i did n't even use up all my available memory . 
  it certainly helps to have a `` buffer '' of free memory available , not to even mention a situation where you 're using so much memory stuff has to be stored on to your hard drive . 
  it will certainly slow your computer down considerably . 
  this has absolutely zero to do with my studies . 
  it 's common sense and decades of just using a computer . 
  having free memory is not memory going to waste , unless you 're so used to having your memory filled up and computer working slowly that you assume it 's its regular state . 
  if he 's an emt he should n't be shocked by gory pictures . 
  i do n't really see the difference between a finger and a penis from a medical standpoint . 
  of course it does n't speed anything up while being free , but the fact that there is free memory for ** when it 's needed ** does speed up your computer or more accurately avoid slowing it down . 
  whenever the data stored in memory has to be transfered to the hard drive it slows your computer down . 
  applications do n't use a steady amount of memory , sometimes it goes up in spikes and at those times the free ready-to-use memory does stop your computer from choking . 
  i guess i walked right into that one . 
  but imagine a doctor that ca n't deal with penises . 
  `` i got into this accident and i 'd like you to take a look at it '', 
  `` ok let 's see it '', 
  `` well it 's right here ... '', 
  `` oh god that 's a penis put it away '', 
  i 'd love to watch gsl but for some reason the gomtv software wo n't even open on my computer . 
  i love the twitchtv stream and ca n't really even understand why they 'd use their own software for something as simple as streaming . 
  i know . 
  i 've tried . 
  it required installing three different things first of which required four additional things i did n't have so i just gave up . 
  i doubt my grandma would be any better at installing compilers . 
  it was n't as simple as `` open stream in vlc '' . 
  finland # 1 bitches !, 
  just like in ice hockey http://gifwall.net/gif/gw-ooooooooooooooooooooo.gif, 
  [ been there done that ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3464/3244161128_8fff7f6f3f.jpg ), 
  while i understand having control of your stream and not outsourcing it i still do n't see the reasoning behind their own player . 
  why not just use a standard ( flash ) streaming system on their own website ? 
  i really do n't see the need or the benefits of a separate software . 
  so you have a build where you deal tons of damage without any real defense . 
  you can use kiting to easily kill 98 % of the enemies . 
  you 're complaining about the existence of the 2 % . 
  reflect damage is supposed to be like that . 
  it 's to encourage ( or enforce ) a player to improve other things than dps as well . 
  you know items can have defensive stats too , right ? 
  if reflect damage is such an issue for you maybe you should balance your build a little bit . 
  i think it 's perfectly reasonable that you ca n't always pick only the items that bump your damage . 
  sometimes you have to sacrifice offense for defense . 
  for melee classes this applies to the entire game , you 're complaining because it applies to one affix . 
  does n't html5 support video streaming without the use of flash ? 
  they could still have it on their own site with their own ads and total control without the need for gomplayer . 
  i just think it feels very 2004 to have an own separate program for exactly one ( simple ) purpose . 
  these days everything works within your web browser . 
  and i like it . 
  the additional benefit on a browser based interface is that it works everywhere . 
  school , work , library , friend 's house . . you can watch that important final you forgot about instantly . 
  having to install software is an unnecessary step and honestly i believe it 's costing them tons of viewers . 
  i 'm not saying they should remove the option to use gomplayer , but it certainly should n't be required . 
  i was n't just trying to come up with an interesting title but instead it 's a legitimate question . 
  i 've been browsing the gsl 's vod page plenty of times and contemplating on purchasing a ticket about as frequently simply to get the hq vods and suddenly they 're just there . 
  and i have n't heard about this on any starcraft 2 website or this subreddit . 
  oh ok that explains it , i was still in the first game . 
  my sisters are both lactose intolerant and drink just as much milk as i do . 
  here in finland ** every ** store has specially processed milk with the lactose removed/deactivated ( i 'm not a milk scientist ) . 
  i do n't think it 's even more expensive than regular . 
  the old `` hyla '' ( i see you use the same word in sweden ) taste disgustingly sweet but in recent years they 've introduced a product that 's not technically even called milk but `` a milk beverage '' but it does n't contain any lactose either yet tastes like regular milk . 
  i suggest you try it . 
  e. apparently it was introduced to the market in 2001 so not that recent, 
   or sold at a profit, 
  what ? 
  they are n't allowed to take a cut ? 
  then who pays the rent and the salaries ? 
  no one 's forcing you to take anything unless you 're strapped in a mental institution or something . 
  well if those are the options then the meds do n't sound all that bad do they ? 
  i know he did n't , i 'm familiar with his work . 
  but just because she used the word privilege does n't automatically make it not a joke . 
  in that case you can also buy these tablets from the pharmacy that you either break apart ( they contain a powder ) and scatter on the food or ingest the tablet first and then eat the food . 
  they 're supposed to break up the lactose in your stomach somehow and save you from the stomach ache . 
  my sister `` got '' her lactose intolerance only in the age of 12 or so so she used those while she was getting used to the taste of lactose free milk . 
  worked great for her . 
  i understand what you 're saying though . 
  i absolutely love milk , but whenever i go abroad i can barely drink the milk . 
  i know it 's perfectly fine but it just does n't taste the exact same and for some reason that 's way more important when it comes to milk . 
  e. i believe it was called lactrase,
