  people are judgmental for a reason . 
  that guy is a fucking dumbass . 
  even if he does n't have to worry about his job eye tattoos are extremely dangerous even if done correctly and often lead to loss of vision . 
  it 's not like a face tattoo where the only danger is looking like an idiont and being unemployed , this one 's actually bad for your health . 
  the pay is n't the only thing that matters in a job . 
  i sure as hell would n't want to work on an oil field no matter what the pay ( yeah yeah ok if they gave me a million for a day i 'd do it you know what i mean ) . 
  i do n't . 
  i consider all soldiers to be brainwashed pawns dumb enough to believe the `` freedom and bill of rights '' propaganda while in reality they 're not fighting for `` american values '' they 're fighting for whoever happens to be in charge . 
  you ca n't disobey orders . 
  i do n't respect anyone who does n't make his own decisions . 
  there are different levels of `` bad for you health '' and you know this . 
  besides i do think it 's idiotic to smoke . 
   i prefer iw games too but on the multiplayer map front , mw3 was bad, 
  that 's because ** mw3 is not an iw game ** . 
  something op apparently does n't know either . 
  yes it does have the iw logo on it but the only reason for that is that activision owns the rights to the iw trademark . 
  not a single lead developer who worked with cod1 ,2 , mw1 or mw2 was involved in the making of mw3 . 
  they all left the studio around the release of mw2 because they got fed up with activision . 
  nearly everyone else from the iw staff as well , only exceptions being a few newer or `` low-level '' employees . 
  look it up on wikipedia or one of the hundreds of news articles you 'll surely find on google . 
  the current `` iw '' is nothing but employees from other branches of activision relocated under the name of iw . 
  [ respawn entertainment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/respawn_entertainment ) is the name the real iw goes by these days , though the team did break up pretty badly . 
   trying to get any foreign media ** legally ** from outside your own country can be a huge pain, 
  you forgot the key word . 
  i 've never had any issues getting my movies or music simply because i do n't pay for anything . 
  how so ? 
  everything is available within 30 minutes of airing and sites like tvt have practically every episode of every show ever released . 
  so do n't set your country to chile ? 
  \\  thinks people talking about pirating are trying to justify it, 
  actually seeing a hacker on xbl is about 1/1000 as propable as seeing one on pc . 
  one of the perks of console gaming . 
  yes . 
  yes i am . 
  at first i thought it was a cd peeled in one continuous motion like the orange [ post ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y821l.jpg ) from yesterday . 
  i am not a clever man . 
  that was the laziest attempt at a bodybuilding.com troll , yet elegant in it 's simplicity, 
   but the gravitational force -- 10 gs -- from the spinning loops at 223 miles per hour in that single minute is lethal . 
  just two days ago i was watching a video about a guy who survived 40 + gs . 
  sure he was n't an average human being but still i would n't trust gs to kill anyone . 
  need more spikes or something . 
  fair enough . 
  dying to g 's still sounds pretty unpleasant though which kinda defeats the purpose of euthanasia . 
  why is staying behind a generation a good thing ? 
  not arguing but curious , what do you consider to be the advantage ? 
  i live ~ 6 months behind in gaming in general . 
  i make an exception for some multiplayer games but campaign/single player focused games i buy either 6 months later for 20 $ or the goty for ~ 30 when it comes out . 
  i just finished mass effect 3 and got started on arkham city . 
  it 's not like either is ruined by age and i paid 45 $ total for the two . 
  none of the other posts had name or source either :(, 
   there 's still a demand 6 months after release . 
  sure but i 've determined 4-12 months is when the demand and the price meet at a reasonable point . 
  you say games are $ 5-20 for old generations . 
  they 're $ 15-25 at the point when i buy them . 
  not really worth waiting years for that $ 5 imo . 
  the red ring is extremely cheap ( free ) and easy ( picked up from your house ) to fix . 
  and newer models ( jasper , falcon , slims ) do n't even get rrod . 
  i paid 150 for my xbox 5 years ago . 
  gamecube was $ 99 really quickly too . 
  the prices do n't take that long to come down . 
  oh god that csi bus stop eyeball reflection episode was terrible . 
  my favourite is in the 1st season of las vegas where they zoom in on security vcr tape and catch a reflection off a monitor on the other side of the store that 's displaying something but `` every 1/60th of a second the screen goes black '' . 
  and the reflection is of a roller coaster or something over a mile away in the other direction . 
  that look 's awesome . 
   newer models do n't get rrod , but i do n't have that kind of money . 
  every xbox sold these days is `` new '' . 
  remember that xbox i mentioned i got 4 years ago for $ 150 ? 
  that 's jasper , the newest model of non-slim free of any issues . 
  rrod issues only affect the ones manufactured 2004-2007 or so . 
  do n't buy packs . 
  i 've bought one pack ( with ea pucks ) and none with real money and i 've got a great team . 
  just make good deals on the marketplace . 
  i always have limes simply for corona/drinks . 
  and one of those lime juice bottles as a backup . 
  good enough . 
  no kidding my sister posted this pic on facebook over a month ago , it was much better quality ** and ** a link to 9gag . 
  that tells enough about the quality of this post . 
   when i mention where i live with this account i 'm usually lying or exaggerating, 
  how do you exaggerate place of residence ? 
  you ca n't be black this is reddit, 
  also using thesaurus to sound like a 17th century british royalty is n't the same as being well-spoken . 
  the word count convinced me he 's autist/otherwise mentally challenged . 
  yeah i have to admit i though it was funny as hell too . 
  i agree it 's not a meme but a funny picture . 
  however none of this is relevant because the image has been posted to / r/trees probably a dozen times which is most likely the reason it did n't get such a warm welcome . 
  why did they pick cleveland for the spin-off in the first place ? 
  he was never one of the interesting characters in the show . 
  yeah that 's what i figured . 
  kinda lame to be honest . 
  it 's not just america . 
  i can speak for the entire nation of finland when i assure you no one over here gave two shits about the paralympics either . 
  got ta love it . 
  makes it impossible to prestige though once you get used to it . 
  it 's most useful in snd but it 's absolutely game changing in any game mode . 
  mw2 was the first fps 's i played on a console . 
  i did n't use to be so good having played on a pc all my life . 
  after about a year i realized i did n't use a headset with my xbox even though i 'd never play a pc fps without headphones . 
  tried them out , instantly like tripled my k/d . 
  i went from average player to pwning every public match simply by plugging in a pair of headphones . 
   a great game made magical by one man 's voice . 
  a shitty game that even a magical voice ca n't save *,
