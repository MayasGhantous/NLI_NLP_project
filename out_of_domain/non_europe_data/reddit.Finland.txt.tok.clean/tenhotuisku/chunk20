  done that . 
  see that 's the fact, 
  no it 's not and you need to watch more chappelle 's show, 
  a comment, 
  i wish i could downvote that title more than once, 
  is n't it common knowledge that you can drive just fine after 1 beer ? 
  even my driving instructor actually said that you are more relaxed and therefore drive better . 
  i do n't know about that but if something was posted on reddit 3y and 4 months ago chances are it was also posted 2 months ago . 
  and today . 
  this actually made me laugh harder than any other comment on the entire thread, 
  which country ? 
  not much skimming to do now, 
  well , fuck you too, 
  i do n't read r/politics and the title is biased, 
  i do , obviously, 
  i 've hated jews since i was fifteen . 
  my biggest pet hate is having to explain myself . 
  why does everyone want to have this conversation over hanukkah dinner , while they spin some dreidels ? 
  ive given up on trying not to sound like an asshole . 
  my standard reply ? 
  `` when i was fifteen i wanted to trick an art teacher into thinking i had emotional depth . '', 
  i did , what do i win ? 
  ** circlejerk **, 
  [ ] ( / son ), 
  you obviously do as you keep raging, 
  cool , story , bro, 
  where did you buy yours ? 
  i ca n't find one for less than $ 130 which is more than what i 'm gon na spend on a video cable adapter, 
   `` you live in a nation where your online activity is not censored '', 
  no i do n't . 
  also , just because things are worse somewhere else does n't mean we should just accept everything that 's going on over here . 
  there 's no reason to make a self post since image posts load 10x quicker . 
  also they do n't require an additional click while browsing with res, 
  fuck old people . 
  seriously . 
  he mentioned skin colour , racist alert, 
  you can just enter the page number in the url . 
  and it 's not like it 's difficult . 
  i wonder where to put the number, 
  story of my life, 
  i 'm not mad at karma whores because they get karma . 
  i 'm mad because they waste my time with shitty submissions . 
  it 's not classy to reference to things that have actually happened ? 
  do n't tell me internet has n't taught you majority of people are stupid, 
  what movie is this from ? 
  downvoted for * le me *, 
   the important thing is turning her on . 
  yeah because the woman is the only one that matters, 
  i 'm just here for all the leftover karma, 
  someone actually uses safari ? 
  have n't you noticed it 's a piece of crap the like of ie ? 
  so does firefox if you select it from the options, 
  it only works if you have more than 1 tab open though, 
  i never actually fapped to the game , but gta hookers inspired me to open my web browser many times, 
  i tried to post this four hours ago ( this post is 2hr old atm ) but reddit was down fuu fuuu i knew there was going to be lots of delicious karma, 
  also the last time it was funny, 
  because owning a mac prohibits you from building another pc ? 
  absolutely not . 
  it 's even worse alone than left 4 dead, 
  or 20 and buy yourself a case of beer, 
  he 's away in russia so you ca n't understand the words on your phone wtf, 
  you are welcome to get the fuck out, 
  do n't worry , we 'll find a way to manage without you, 
  thanks for clarifying he 's not just any friend but an ** asian ** friend, 
  i never understood people who were afraid to downvote . 
  propaganda with faulty logic, 
  talk about shitty weed, 
  who the fuck pays 59.99 for a video game, 
   but slips like these might just give me away sooner or later . 
  slips like . . doing laundry ? 
  what the fuck man, 
  i 'm not saying you ca n't be addicted to weed . 
  just that thinking about it does n't automatically make you an addict . 
  yeah because no sober person would ever make such a huge mistake, 
  i 'm just not an idiot . 
  this is one of the most amazing gaming related things i 've seen in a while, 
  so your video player does n't have a `` skip 10 seconds '' button ? 
  nope . 
  res -  view images . 
  scroll down neverending reddit with images already opened and enjoy the ride . 
  you do realize that the game developers get exactly the same amount of money if you pay 59.99 to gamestop or 34.99 two weeks later to certain online stores . 
  or names ? 
  sauce ? 
  anything ? 
  that 's how i feel when i see a generic forum bombing gif posted on reddit for the hundreth time this month with a `` funny '' title, 
  it took you how long to figure that out ? 
  25 % yeah right, 
  this comic needed about 10 % of the text that was there, 
  running while high ? 
  what is this madness, 
  get the fuck out you sick man, 
  yeah because she totally would n't look retarded with a different facial expression, 
  420 m high dynamic tower, 
  i 'm 420m high and found this amusing, 
  a round elevator with computer technology perhaps ? 
  it 's great but so is just cause 2 . 
  i recommend you get both . 
  play on easy/normal, 
  complain about the game being easy, 
  i 'm sure you 'll find enough filthy rich people in dubai/mid-east who want a 360 view from their skyscraper apartment no matter what the cost .
