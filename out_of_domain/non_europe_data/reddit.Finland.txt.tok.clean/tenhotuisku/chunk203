  makes sense . 
  yeah and i doubt marley who was against recreational drug use would want everyone to smoke weed, 
  \\  show defined my childhood, 
  what ? 
  that 's terrible . 
  it takes like 10 minutes to download a 1080p movie on a 100mbit connection . 
  a knocked up spin-off ? 
  why have n't i heard about this , i loved that movie . 
  you must 've hung out in the wrong crowd or in the country side . 
  having grown up in helsinki vast majority of the people i know smoke weed . 
  but these days it 's pretty easy to get it where ever you live , though people and cops are more uptight the further into the wilderness you go . 
   this is a rather shallow/dumb post, 
  could you sound any more butthurt ? 
  this is reddit . 
  everything is shallow/dumb . 
  this one at least included a pun . 
  and the way it 's bothering you and making you try to convince people this is the stupidest joke ever just highlights that it 's actually kinda funny . 
  who does n't ? 
  playstation controller is best of thps . 
  but that 's the only thing it 's better for imo . 
  does the pc version have servers though ? 
  i thought the game was hosted on one of the players computers like on consoles . 
  i ca n't not read this in day9 's voice for some reason . 
  no because we had moontv and atv which ran reruns through the night . 
  battlefield 3 beats bc2 on every aspect ... on paper . 
  i enjoyed playing bc2 a lot more . 
  like the video shows it 's really difficult to put into words . 
   as someone who does n't play starcraft 2 online, 
  so you play the game and read r/starcraft , but you only play against the cpu ? 
  then he 'd probably say `` as someone who does n't play starcraft 2 '', 
  source ? 
  who the fuck plays any rts against cpu ? 
   who the fuck plays any rts against cpu ? 
  it 's not like a player who only plays a couple games a week could n't win games in bronze . 
  whatever floats your boat i guess . 
  i could n't enjoy playing cpu even if i beat it ever game ( or especially then ) . 
  i 'd rather lose all my matches online . 
  why the fuck would the pump ask for a zip code ? 
  honest question . 
  over here all you need is your pin . 
  that sounds even less fun, 
  i went looking for the comment and it 's deleted :(, 
  i wanted to see what all the fuzz was about, 
   she 's 18 and her boyfriend proposed ? 
  america !, 
  i know who she is but is there a joke i do n't get because i have n't seen the notebook ? 
  well actually i started seeing it but did n't get past 30 minutes . 
  silly americans and multiple choice tests . 
  first of all , i did search this subreddit , the entirety of reddit and the / r/looper subreddit and found no discussion of this . 
  secondly , i 'm not saying looper was a bad movie or the make up was bad , i just think it looked a lot like younger deniro . 
  so much i started wondering if it was deniro co-starring in the film instead of bruce like i remembered . 
  the last pic is not supposed to look like deniro , it 's just there to demonstrate the huge change in makeup that happened mid-film . 
  did you look at the pictures ? 
  it 's not just the makeup , he had the same body language/gestures . 
  hard to capture in a screenshot but especially visible [ in this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xh5di.jpg ) . 
   though there are times i suppose bruce willis and de niro have shared similar attributes, 
  that is true . 
  they both do the same eye squinting thing and the wrinkles on the forehead . 
  i guess you could say jgl 's gestures were from bruce , but since bruce and deniro act very similiarly and the make up looks more like deniro that 's why he also `` copies '' deniros mannerisms . 
  he probably just assumed so because they were human . 
  what 's up with people crying and acting all sad like this is the only day kids die . 
  more than twenty children starve every day in third-world-countries . 
  kids younger than the ones shot today are sold for sex and slave trafficing . 
  kids are killed if they ca n't keep up in sweat shops . 
  as long as these things exist i feel like people acting overly emotional whenever a news story like this pops up just points out how they ignore the problems on every other day of the year .

   having said that , some products are designed to be taken apart and some are n't . 
  no shit . 
  imac belongs in the latter category . 
  thus the title . 
  i 've built and/or upgraded all my pc 's before buying an imac and i would never dare to crack it open . 
  nothing to do with interest or elitism . 
  same with firefox . 
  alternatively shift + ctrl + r or shift + cmd + r if on a mac ( f-keys can be a bitch ) . 
  yeah i agree . 
  simply saying something stupid and incorrect is n't sarcasm . 
   because people do n't want to read subtitles, 
  any game i 've ever played the first thing i do is turn on subtitles . 
  same with movies and tv even if i speak the language . 
  i 'd rather have the italian scenes in italian ( and thus `` forcing '' me to read the subtitles ) and the modern day scenes in english ( since the characters speak english ) . 
  the added immersion would be way worth the `` price '' of having to read the subtitles . 
  besides , it was suggested this would be an option in the menus , not the default . 
  it would take very little effort since the italian sound track is already there . 
  came to post this . 
  not even a joke , i feel pretty bad about it . 
  the eu version ( the one i played ) had both english and italian soundtracks on the same disc . 
  that 's not the case in skyrim appartenly but we 're not talking about skyrim , we 're talking about assassin 's creed where there apparently is enough disc space . 
  yeah definitely . 
  just like with the bleeped swearwords , they require advertisers to fund the show . 
  especially early on there were lots of situations where they made stoner jokes and just replaced the word weed with alcohol or jack daniels , it 's pretty obvious .
