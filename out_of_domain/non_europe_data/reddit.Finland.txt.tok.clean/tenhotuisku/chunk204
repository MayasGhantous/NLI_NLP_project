  til people still use voice mail . 
  the last time i got a voice mail was back in the days of landlines and separate voice mail machines with little tapes inside of them . 
  i assume you 're american ? 
  ( honest question , not bashing ) . 
  you can on wp, 
  i do n't know anyone who has a voice mail service activated so yes , i hang up . 
  the only person that ever left voice mail in our family landline was my grandmother . 
  i was n't kidding when i said i have n't received or heard of anyone using voicemail since those little tapes . 
  there 's a propeller that turns and the missile arms after a certain number of revolutions . 
  at least that 's how many rpg 's work ( not the rpg-7 though , it works purely based on g forces iirc ) , i assume it 's a similiar system if not something more advanced . 
  note that i am not an expert and this is completely out of my ass/from watching too much military channel . 
  i 'm not from either . 
  i 'm finnish . 
  i could download that in 5 seconds . 
  feel really sorry for you pal . 
  i 'm glad there are no caps on non-mobile nor mobile internets where i live ( finland ) . 
  unlimited internet with 4g . 
  100 texts ( really more than enough because of whatsapp ) and 100 minutes for 16 $ for me here in finland . 
  not complaining . 
  i have but that coexisted with the time of the landlines and tapes . 
  i do n't think i 've heard it since ala-aste though ( grade school ) . 
  overpriced is relative though . 
  as someone who owns and mbp and an imac i 'll admit the pricing is ridiculous , but then again i would n't change either to a pc with similiar specs even if that meant i got my $ 600 back . 
  yes the price difference is n't justified if you just look at the specs , but i 'll gladly pay it to get to use os x. 
  so you could say it is n't overpriced at all , just smartly priced since people are willing to pay that much . 
  [ what everyone who 's played cod or battlefield is thinking ] ( http://jollyroger666.narod.ru/revolvers/mp412/mp412_01.jpg ), 
  well i do spend about 10 hours a day on my computer . 
  my mbp is 5 years old and still runs perfectly , smoother than most brand new pc laptops . 
  600 $ for 10 x 365 x 5 and all of a sudden the added cost of using a mac does n't seem that much . 
  i 'm not incredibly invested in anything , i just enjoy it more . 
  and that 's exactly what i was commenting on . 
  this mbp did n't cost $ 600 . 
  it was ~ 2000 $ but i got it for ~ 1500 $ since i did n't have to pay taxes . 
  about $ 600 more than a pc laptop with similiar specs . 
  so $ 600 more to use os x for 5 years ( and running ) . 
  about 30 cents more per day . 
  what do n't you get ? 
  i understand some people might prefer other operating systems but how does that stop you from understanding my logic ? 
  but out of all the novels in the world why would they choose those three lines ? 
  so because it 's from some random novel all of a sudden it is n't a crazy quote ? 
  like this was the only english crime novel they could find in japan , and that 's the only page . 
  i 'm still not sure, 
  we just call that `` rolling inverted '' in finland . 
  did n't know it was associated with the netherlands . 
  i 'd like to see how it looks in a profile/in the game . 
  without the surroundings it looks just like any picture made with paint . 
  it 's not so much the word `` nigger '' as the context it 's put in . 
  i think these are better than what [ she ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y1saa.jpg ) [ had ] ( http://www.pulsarmedia.eu/data/media/388/nessa%20devil%20free%20high%20quality%202560x1600%20wallpapers%20for%20your%20desktop%2085100093%2025.07.2011%20_2_2.jpg ) [ before ] ( http://files.sexwisienki.pl/gallery/1875544597.jpg ) . 
  when [ pushed together ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6qtyxnold1rysrn4o1_1280.jpg ) they looked great but otherwise the gap is just way too big . 
  btw while looking for these pics i came across the exact same pic op posted but it was posted in december 2011 . 
  so not exactly `` new '' . 
  i think it 's pretty wtf that in america you can apparently sell a drink that contains melatonin at a truck stop . 
  over the counter at a drug store and mixed in a drink at a truck stop are two very different things if you ask me . 
  well you ca n't where i live . 
  still , i 've seen pharmacies inside grocery stores in places like wal-mart so i kinda understand why it 'd be allowed in a supermarket . 
  a petrol station on the other hand should n't sell anything more complicated than aspirin if you ask me . 
  actually now that i think of it i 'm pretty sure you ca n't even buy aspirin at a truck stop where i live , but i 'm not certain that 's the best option either .

  `` please do n't have played video games '' is as likely as not having watched tv . 
  or eaten cereal as a kid . 
  maybe the killer listened to some sort of music as well . 
   how could she not be ? 
  because never in the history has there been a funny woman comedian . 
  actually never mind that , a funny woman . 
  wait , there 's a reference ? 
  i was n't referencing anything . 
  mirror ? 
  was surprised i had to scroll all the way down for this . 
   who can not be trusted to take anything seriously, 
  secret santa is serious business ? 
  this entire comment page is so unbelievable . 
  people raging that he should have gotten her a $ 10 amazon gift card ? 
  they 're two adults , a joke is always worth more than $ 10 . 
  and you do n't have to `` understand the meme '' to laugh at how terrible that painting is . 
  terrible in a funny way . 
   a real gift like a gift card, 
  what ? 
  a gift card is probably the most boring gift there is . 
  yeah if you 're 14 years old and your finances rely on allowance then it 's nice but a funny gift like an absolutely terrible painting is always better than a damn gift card . 
  especially if there 's a limit on spending like there usually is with secret santa . 
  who cares about $ 10 or $ 20 ? 
  more importantly , who cares that they `` missed out on the possibility '' of getting a $ 10 gift card and instead got a joke painting ? 
  like their entire finances relied on that secret santa gift card . 
  ease up reddit , learn to take a joke . 
  `` severily injured '' what happened ? 
  i personally prefer it when the meals are n't included . 
  i do n't eat airplane food anyway ( not that i would n't eat what op posted ) so i prefer not paying for the food in my ticket either . 
  no this is just nordic culture . 
  that 's the minimum distance we must keep to be comfortable around each other ( unless we 're drunk ) . 
  so actually in reality this picture is much less awkward than if notch had put his hand on the kid 's shoulder or something . 
  i wish i was joking . 
  i 've flown quite a lot across the atlantic . 
  i normally sleep around 10 hours of the way so there 's no need for eating .

  i drive better high . 
  let me explain . 
  yes my potential driving skills are better sober .
