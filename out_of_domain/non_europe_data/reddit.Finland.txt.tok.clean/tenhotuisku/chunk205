  if i had to clock the fastest time around n\u00fcrburgring or something i 'd do better if i was n't high . 
  but the reality is when i drive sober i 'm always half-assing it . 
  i drive over the speed limit ( not a lot , but 20 % or so ) , i often fall into a `` trance '' , not really paying that good attention to surroundings and signs etc. 
  anyone who says they never do is a liar . 
  when i drive high i 'm fucking 100 % focused on driving . 
  yes my reaction time might be 0,2 seconds slower but i 'll never go over the speed limit , i read every sign , i 'm constantly aware of my surroundings etc. 
  and i never do anything else whle driving like check my phone or something that might easily happen sober . 
  genius, 
  i think that 's the point, 
  maybe it 's just me but i 'd prefer an hbo ( mini ) series over any movie any day . 
  it makes me kinda sad how 4 of the top 5 comments are `` i have no clue what 's going on '' . 
  i know the rules to football ( both ) , baseball and basketball . 
  even lacrosse . 
  i do n't think rolling while driving or smoking while driving is a very good idea . 
  though i do admit to the latter , i was young and stupid . 
  still am both but that 's beside the point . 
  and it should also be noted that there definitely is such a thing as being too high to drive . 
  does n't make him any less of an asshole . 
  just like obeying the law does n't necessarily make your actions right . 
  i actually do understand australian football somewhat . 
  it 's a very interesting looking sport though i would n't say i know the rules , i 've only seen a couple of matches . 
  i was surprised so many people use the default hotkeys . 
  they 're terrible . 
  download [ darkgrid ] ( http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=257590 ) or other custom setup . 
  it 's best to learn it early on before getting used to the shitty default keys . 
   no guy or girl , young or old , ever complained that they had a boring conversation with someone cos they only talked about themselves . 
  not true at all . 
  i 've seen a ton of situations where a conversation gets awkward because the other guy is asking way too many questions and it 's more like an interview . 
  especially if the people do n't really know each other . 
  fuck those driving missions though, 
  that and the time limits that made no sense . 
  i have delivered all the boxes , i 'm driving towards the garage just to park my car . 
  100 feet away from the door time is up and i have to restart the mission . 
  what ? 
  why would there be a time limit to when he has to park his car , it was pointless and infuriating . 
  this picture has probably been posted a dozen times but i ai n't even mad . 
   available for custom videos ( solo ; g/g ; b/g ; anal ) . 
  there must be some out there, 
  a quarter is 7 grams . 
  anything less than gram a day i would n't consider a `` heavy smoker '' . 
   work, 
  itunes 11 introduced `` play next/queue '' which is a feature i 've been waiting for in itunes since i got my first ipod in 2004 . 
  i 'm not about to stick to an older version just so i could give away my money . 
  i have two computers but i 'd rather use 11 on both of them because i rarely use them at the same time . 
  i really do n't see the point of intentionally making things more difficult or using inferior software just so that i could pay for stuff . 
  i pay to make my experiences more enjoyable , not the other way around . 
   i agree , but there are n't always good alternatives to getting some of these videos , illegal or not . 
  i see you obviously do n't have an account to any quality trackers . 
  so did you save the comment to return in 5 months or just randomly stumble upon it ? 
  did the opposite for me . 
  i was looking at the pic sad such a pretty girl ruined herself . 
  turned out everything went better than expected . 
  also name ? 
  \\ # 1 non-alcoholic dance club in 2012, 
  ladies night ladies pay only $ 10 cover, 
  that 's a pretty shitty deal, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1562gr/tonight_ill_be_taking_you_inside_the_mind_of_a/ 16 days so not quite literally but almost, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1562gr/tonight_ill_be_taking_you_inside_the_mind_of_a/ agreed, 
  yeah that 's what i usually do when i see a repost but not when it 's been given the moderator seal of approval http://gifwall.net/gif/gw-6laog.gif, 
   i live by the law, 
  at 15-18 i was partying at friends ' houses drinking our asses off . 
  there was a teenage club nearby but nobody really went there except some immigrants and out of town people . 
  it was considered lame though they did have an okay pool table . 
  thx, 
  dat waist & ass too bad about the boobs, 
  i 'd also like to know in case you found out, 
  i still do n't get it, 
   perhaps it 's that i grew up with touchscreens ( i 'm in college right now ) on every phone that i 've had , but i preferred typing without the physical interface . 
  what ? 
  i just started college and the first 8 or so phones that i owned had physical buttons . 
  yeah i have never seen not swallowing outside of porn . 
  my ex put it simply `` it 's the quickest way to get rid of it '' . 
  i agree . 
  since when is success kid not the correct meme for getting blowjobs ? 
  well that explains some . 
  i 'm from finland ( nokia ) so by the time i was in 3rd grade everyone had a cell phone . 
  nokia n-gage, 
  nokia e71 which i hung onto for 5 years because i simply did n't want to give up physical qwerty, 
  and now lumia 920, 
   the reason why people believe it is dying is because people that leave facebook often tend to do so publicly . 
  the reason i feel facebook is dying is that i 've noticed myself and a lot of other users ( who all still have their accounts ) not using it that much anymore . 
  there used to be a time i 'd check facebook every 15 to 30 minutes . 
  now i do it once a day if i remember . 
  we still play ctr with my friends . 
  and it 's still great fun . 
  i have n't played mario kart in a decade . 
  exactly . 
  it 's not just me that 's lost interest , what you said about the newsfeed changing in front of you was spot on . 
  there was a reason i used to check it constantly : the constant new content . 
  now 1-2 minutes once a day is enough to see everything my ~ 450 friends have posted . 
  yeah to be honest it probably has more to do with the fact that everyone has either a ps1 or ps2 lying around or ps3 and the psn version of ctr . 
  no one i know owns wii and nes 's , snes 's and 64s ( especially with 4 working controllers ) are much rarer than playstations . 
  i personally prefer not having the music on . 
  overall i thought the casting sounded very professional . 
  did n't have the feel of someone who 's `` looking for pointers '' . 
  good job . 
  not to rain on your parade or anything because obviously these are matters of opinion but i would n't even want to eat that . 
  it looks disgusting to be honest . 
  and i love steak . 
  fat tastes like fat .
