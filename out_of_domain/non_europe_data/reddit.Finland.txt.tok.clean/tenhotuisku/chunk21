  i had to go through this about 6 months back and at least then u.s users had this option on the website while europeans did n't, 
  you do realize it 's a horror game and not a railshooter ? 
  you 're supposed to run away from the enemies and not shoot them all . 
  it says so in the box ( or manual ) . 
  i live in finland in the suburbs of helsinki and it looks a lot like that . 
  apartment buildings and forest . 
  pics from google : [ 1 ] ( http://dwww01.morning.fi/files/images/tapiola.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.pjoy.fi/galleria/espoo/0506155247_std.jpg ), 
  main difference being the city in the background instead of nothing, 
  apparently reddit does n't appreciate your sense of humour, 
  on my mac alt + e gives me \u00e9 directly , i ca n't find a way to get an a with accent . 
  i 'm pretty sure that guy with the beard played the killer in an episode of csi, 
  i have no idea but it seems to be in all the photos : [ album ] ( http://www.pjoy.fi/galleria/espoo/0506155245.htm ) . 
  talk about overkill, 
  maybe in 1984 they were n't but that car 's 27 years old, 
  that 's actually pretty good advice . 
  i bet most rape victims would n't suffer most physical wounds/bruises if they stopped fighting, 
  good thing i do n't pay a cent for either one . 
  oh and everything is available . 
  even stuff that is n't on dvd yet . 
  it 's called tapiola , espoo . 
  espoo is a seperate city but i live closer to downtown helsinki than most helsinkians  ( 6km ~ 4mi ), 
  we share a border with munkkiniemi as well , it 's cropped right outside the picture number 2 . 
  santa cruz looks real nice , how long is the drive to the shore ? 
  i upvoted this because it 's the stupidest fucking idea i 've seen in a while, 
  dying ( / melvin ), 
  why is every comment in this picture downvoted so much ? 
  dead ? 
  are n't bics refillable ? 
  why would you get a pipe like that ? 
  it just looks . . difficult, 
  it 's not technically in helsinki but in espoo , kinda like new jersey to ny . 
  it 's a 4mi drive to downtown helsinki so i just refer to it as suburbs of helsinki when talking to non-finns . 
  [ tapiola ] ( http://maps.google.com/?ll=60.173975,24.799447&amp;spn=0.012764,0.032659&amp;t=h&amp;z=16 ), 
  nope , thanks to that guy . 
  please punch that guy if you see him . 
  he 's american so you probably know him . 
  so you 're mad because there 's a flier that say 's it 's what you got ta do ? 
  where i live , ** i actually got to do it ** . 
  we need the ending . 
  we need it !, 
  i just played through sr1 and sr2 ( again ) and this shit just looks horrible . 
  i used the cheapest 9mm throughout 90 % of the games because it had a real gangsta feel and the games were super easy otherwise . 
  airstrikes and massive boxing gloves ? 
  too far man . 
  too far . 
  nah man , i wish i was gay . 
  i fucking hate women . 
  life 's a bitch sometimes . 
  504 gateway time-out, 
  you changed my world, 
  i downvoted . 
  what you gon na do about it, 
  ... and it 's not worth it, 
  when you have missions designed for harriers and air strikes it kinda takes away the `` from the hood '' option of gameplay, 
  why does the country of origin matter as long as the music is good ? 
  i wonder how many of these upvotes are just for the tits . 
  that being said i upvoted, 
  it 's not like you have either . 
  i 'm not saying it 's definitely going to be crap . 
  i 'm probably going to buy it or at least download it . 
  it just sounds like it could be a lot better . 
  * tried * ? 
  [ for finland it 's 80-89 . no wait 90-99 . 
  i mean 00-10 . oh it 's 2011 too . 
  and all-time . 
  when i was a kid i saw this really sexy image set from 21sextury . com that ended in fisting . 
  it was the first `` kinky '' thing i ever saw . 
  i think of that fap as the moment i lost my soul to the internet . 
  [ some sort of sauce ] ( http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-9826734-sensual-secretary.php ), 
  e. [ hi-res ] ( http://www.zeusbox.com/wallpapers/secretary_in_office_2_3_zeusbox_com-1920x1080.jpg ), 
  apparently the set is called `` secretary_in_office_2 . rar '' but i could n't find a working download, 
  well all this fucking circlejerking that 's been going on lately is a pretty good reason to go anywhere else, 
  well then do n't read it . 
  problem solved . 
  well technically 1/2 is more accurate than 0.5, 
  airport bar ? 
  buy a bottle of vodka from tax free and open it as soon as you leave the store . 
  that 's what i do if i have a long flight, 
  you mute your speakers every night . . and you have n't bought earphones ? 
  wtf, 
  it 's definitely undercooked , why would you take it out when the crust has n't even brown . . eded ( ? ), 
  other than that looks good, 
  i prefer `` bitches make shit up '' as a starting point nowadays . 
  innocent until proven guilty etc, 
  i 'll probably try it for a month or so , if it 's amazing i 'll keep it . 
  otherwise not . 
   women tend to troll in a way that 's hard to put into a rage comic, 
  and men tend to respond in a way that finds giving a fuck difficult, 
  `` mac community '', 
  downvote, 
  definitely . 
  especially if it 's bad writing . 
  and i consider 95 % + of games to be shitty writing when comparted to movies , books etc. 
  almost no story you play through would ever be published as any other sort of entertainment . 
  good stories are good . 
  too bad they 're so fucking rare . 
  it 's too long for internet, 
  modern warfare 1 & 2 had a good story ? 
  i 've played mw1 twice and mw2 five times ( + mp ) so i 'm not a hater . 
  but the story lines are the last reason i 'd play through them again .
