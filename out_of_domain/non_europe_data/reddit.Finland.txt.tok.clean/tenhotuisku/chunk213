  i would n't try to publish a book with this little source material but i thought it was enough for a small remark in the comments of a youtube video . 
  it 's not justification for sure . 
  but it did help me understand why some people would think that way . 
  honestly the subject does n't really interest me enough to look up studies regarding it , i was n't really even expecting my inbox to fill up when making that original comment . 
  sounds like your school sucks . 
  well actually it sounds more like you do n't even study cs but we can keep pretending for the sake of argument . 
  when i first started i was honestly surprised how `` normal '' the student base was . 
  of course there are more socially awkward people than in a lot of other fields but it 's not all just ugly nerds . 
  majority of the students look like regular students who could be studying anything . 
  besides , the amount of socially awkward girls is equally proportionate . 
  no , no , no , yes , no , no, 
  the nude photo is after her first surgery . 
  the second pic is after her second surgery . 
  they were some time apart and she really lost tons of weight ( which only made her look worse so idk why ) around the time of the second surgery . 
  i have n't really looked at the blog after the second surgery which was about 2 years ago so someone else is going to have to fill you in on recent developments . 
  look at the `` before surgeries '' photo . 
  i do n't think she got made fun of for her looks . 
  yeah that 's the excuse the left wing media often tries to pitch, 
  yeah . 
  she 's had work done elsewhere too but i think those were separate . 
  i never really read the text when i browsed through her blog . 
  honestly i care more about my dog than a person i 've never met . 
  still i think people are taking this out of perspective . 
  yes it 's silly but i bet it 's more healthy for the dog than having an owner who only takes it out to poop twice a day and never properly runs with it or anything . 
  and those are pretty common . 
  i 'm not american . 
  i like the idea but a separate forum sounds a little old fashioned . 
  maybe just implement a `` discussion '' section to each build . 
  that way it 's easily and instantly accessible for anyone interested in or liking/disliking a build . 
  of course if you find a forum much easier to implement you could just take the middle road and have a thread automatically generated when a build gets submitted end then have a direct link to the thread in each build . 
  i 'm not american . 
  also i was just making a point that you probably see the latter types of dog owners every day but you would n't bother taking a picture and it to reddit . 
  so you 're telling me i have to go back and replay all mgs games ? 
  to be absolutely honest i never really enjoyed them . 
  mgs2 or tts was the last one i played . 
  i watched bel air all the time as a kid but this is actually the first time i 've even seen a clip from the show with the new mom . 
  was she really that bad ( or did the show get that bad ) that i 've never seen her even in a youtube clip ? 
  or is it just coincidence ? 
   some women think going to the most crowded place they can find and breastfeeding are productively protesting and raising awareness , but they are hurting their cause . 
  this is probably very true . 
  where i live nobody would think breastfeeding in public is `` inappropriate '' or `` wrong '' so i ca n't really empathize with you but you 're right , american 's tend to be good at getting offended . 
  to be honest if i was a mother feeding my baby i would n't give a shit if someone did n't happen to like it , it 's only their problem anyway . 
   no racist ever thinks they are, 
  what ? 
  i know tons of people who openly admit to being racist . 
   they make a lot of good points, 
  so reddit should change to be less appealing to it 's biggest potential consumer base ? 
  i do n't understand what you want . 
  and none of those internet communites were actually interesting in any way because they were moderated too strictly . 
  reddit , like 4chan , is popular because it 's not heavily moderated . 
  users make up the content . 
  for better and worse . 
  if the users are slightly racist then the comments will probably be slightly racist . 
  and i think that 's okay . 
  i do n't understand why we would try to stop being ourselves and try to create a better `` product '' off the site to appeal to . . who ? 
  i 'm just here to entertain myself . 
  wow so you 're seriously thinking that `` op is a faggot '' is the problem we should be focused on here ? 
  there is actual racism and homophobia on reddit . 
  it 's usually downvoted under the treshold to be visible . 
  though i agree `` op is a faggot '' is a shitty joke it 's not racism or homophobia and to see you people getting so worked up about the joke just makes me laugh . 
  4chan does n't actually hate this site . 
  most of the users of 4chan also enjoy reddit , though they 're tech savvy enough to unsubscribe from the default subreddits . 
  4chan hating reddit is a stupid meme started by the users of reddit . 
  oh my god what a cesspool that comment section was . 
  so many elitist special snowflakes , besserwissers and apparently some sort of srs war in the middle of all that . 
  born in 90 as well , i do n't think there 's a single video of myself growing up . 
  and after that it 's just a few blurry drunken cell phone videos or something that i doubt i 've even saved . 
  video cameras were n't really a thing where i lived like it seems to have been in the us ( i base this completely on television and afv ) . 
  with the invention of digital cameras everyone has some sort of video camera now at least in the form of a phone but before that they were really rare . 
  meh when i saw this pic i knew there was going to be racism on the bottom off the comments . 
  you know why ? 
  because reddit loves to make a huge deal off them . 
  there are tons of people who want attention . 
  that 's why places like gonewild exists . 
  some are even so desperate for it they do n't care if it 's positive or negative . 
  so they 'll make a racist comment that gets a huge response and even though their post might get hidden by the comment treshold crimsonhunter 's comment is still the 3rd highest in the entire thread . 
  mission accomplished , they got their attention . 
  that 's why you should just ignore and move on . 
  not make a huge fuss like all you people have managed to once again . 
  yeah because their children will never interact with anyone else than their siblings ? 
  [ mfw you just keep feeding the troll ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bfhzy.jpg ), 
  now come on butt hurt people downvoting everyone because racism on reddit is the hot topic of the day . 
  this was actually a pretty good shop . 
  i chuckled . 
  maybe people assumed you were some sort of a novelty account attempt ? 
  that 's the joke . 
  it 's still too much for some people . 
  that author of that article was so butt hurt and needlesly defensive . 
  this has nothing to do with anti-intellectualism . 
  it 's just a funny little thing that works surprisingly well . 
  no one 's trying to disprove the importance of spelling with it . 
   i used to just shoot at the tv stand 's glass door and get perfect scores allll daayyyy, 
  but why ? 
  why does that article mention ** iphone 5 ** over and over again ? 
  processors : curiosity 's is 132mhz ; the ** iphone 5 ** 's is 1.3 ghz . 
  memory : curiosity 's has 128 mb ; the ** iphone 5 ** has 1 gb . 
  i 'm pretty sure any iphone is faster than that so why not just say iphone instead of ** iphone 5 ** . 
  or any smartphone that 's come out in the last 5 years . 
  we can all se who 's butt it was that got fucked, 
  i 'm actually interested if they like `` shoved it in his ass '' as in put it between buttcheecks near the hole for a second or two or if it actually penetrated the sphincter .
