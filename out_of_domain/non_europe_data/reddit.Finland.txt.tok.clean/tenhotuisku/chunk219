  they do n't need to `` justify '' their prices . 
  but i would n't buy the steak if it had a sticker like that on it . 
  would you ? 
  whether or not this error actually happened this month or day or year they would still account for the possibility of it in their prices . 
  having it actually happen does n't raise the prices . 
  it 's already in the budget . 
  edit . 
   keep playing the victim and the `` everybody is out to get me '' thing . 
  i do n't see how realizing that it 's a competetive world where a lot of people want to make money and thus `` are out to get you ( r money ) '' is playing the victim . 
  that 's just reality . 
  you 're the only one mixing pride into this . 
  if i saw a pricing error and got free steak i 'd be ** happy ** like i imagine the op . 
  ** happy ** , not proud . 
  why would getting cheap food make him proud ? 
  i have never heard of any `` shitstorm '' outside of reddit . 
  i do n't even think i 've heard people talk about chris brown and rihanna outside of reddit . 
  u mad bro, 
  i 'd take advantage of it . 
  and what 's up with you and rights and wrongs ? 
  did op post this picture with the title `` i was in the right and got cheap steak '' ? 
  no he did n't . 
  not everyone makes all their decisions based on some arbitrary moral code . 
  cs as in cs , cs : s and cs : go . 
  i 've played thousand of hours . 
  mostly beta-1 .6 though . 
  probably a few dozen of both source and go . 
  i did n't say never but i 'd estimate less one in hundred games i hear someone use the public voice chat . 
  do you play on us servers ? 
  having so many languages in europe maybe affects the situation , you ca n't assume everyone on your team speaks the same language . 
  i said one small thing ( taking screenshots ) is much better implemented in os x than it is in windows or linux . 
  i was n't talking about the size of the company . 
  til not watching e !, 
  or other hollywood gossip shows is ignorance . 
  well did n't i say i heard about it from reddit ? 
  i think it 's a pretty cool sweater even if you do n't know what tl is . 
  i especially like the sleeves . 
  i 'd definitely wear it . 
  i did n't even contemplate the possibility that he was n't being sarcastic . 
  honestly i did n't really find this cringeworthy . 
  just a conversation with an apparently not-so-smart woman that did n't go so well . 
  nothing too special . 
  honestly i did n't even find this cringeworthy . 
  it was a pretty average `` trying to talk to a girl who is n't interested '' conversation with the added twist that she seemed a bit retarded . 
  you did n't really say anything that bad , except for that last line in case it was n't sarcasm ( whish is how i interpreted it ) . 
  i know seeing your old conversations can easily make one cringe but it 's not really internet bad . 
  not pissing on your submission , just saying that you should n't really feel embarassed or anything by this . 
  i agree he 's in great shape but that does n't make this any less cringeworthy . 
  ok it 'd be even worse if he was fat but it 's still cringe . 
  and he still gets royalties for at least some of the vitamin water flavors . 
  50 's a businessman . 
  got ta respect him even though i 'm not really a fan of his music . 
  i could see it right away but i wanted to believe man . 
  i wanted to believe !, 
  i do n't really get this argument . 
  i know the girls are paid . 
  of course they get paid , that 's the reason they stay and listen to the insults . 
  one could even call them actors . 
  but i do n't see how that 's supposed to change anything . 
  it 's not like they 're wearing an ugly costume . 
  they make fun of what the girl looks like every day . 
  their bodies do n't magically transform when they 're no longer `` in character '' . 
  yeah you could argue they knew what they signed up for but that does n't make this guy any less of an asshole . 
  i mean paying chicks to sit there and listen while you make fun of their bodies is a pretty dick move . 
  yes , even though he pays them . 
  it 's acted , but i mean it 's not like the girls will suddenly transform out of the body that just got made fun of when they yell `` cut ! '', 
  so i do n't really see what difference it makes . 
  i 'm not an expert on the subject but i have a hunch that most people that sign up for humiliation porn do n't exactly possess the education or work history or clean criminal record that would enable them to do anything else . 
  `` acting '' . 
  if you sit on a couch without saying a word and your appearance gets made fun off i do n't really see the difference whether it was `` acted '' or not . 
  basically what you mean by acting is `` they got paid to be humiliated '' . 
  like suddenly everything is perfectly okay when you sprinkle some money on it . 
   people have a different sense of humor , better get used to it, 
  yeah finding people so desperately in need of money that they 're willing to endure any sort of humiliation for a paycheck totally falls under the `` different sense of humor , get used to it '' category . 
  i mean every morning i like to kick the blind homeless guy who lives in the alley next to my building . 
  what 's the gon na do , punch the air ? 
  but that 's just my sense of humor , get used to it . 
  so just because they are n't pure innocent maidens but ugly and even fat and most likely homeless and so desperate for any money they 're willing to endure humiliation for a few dollars you ca n't have a problem with it ? 
  only pretty girls deserve basic human dignity ? 
  am i right ? 
  yeah making fun of ugly people because they 're ugly is my favourite past time during every high school lunch break . 
  you do n't really need big tits for it to feel good . 
  sure it 's a different experience from a `` proper '' titfuck but rubbing your dick in the space between even size a tits can feel amazing if the girl does it right . 
  actually that 's bullshit . 
  it 's a very natural phenomenon that exists in most animals . 
  but hitting someone is n't ? 
  i agree with onxwat , pistol whipping only makes sense if you 're already pointing a weapon at someone and want to use physical force . 
  if you 're planning something like this pistol whipping sounds like a dumb option when you could hit them with , you know , something that 's designed for hitting and not for shooting bullets . 
  feeling shy ? 
  let 's fix that up with some pills . 
  come the fuck on . 
  i know you 're american and this is the 21st century but curing `` social anxiety '' with goddamn medication ? 
  ridiculous . 
  i feel the exact same . 
  sure he 's very good looking but he 's a movie star . 
  in movie star standards he 's just kinda `` meh '' . 
  i could name like 20 other actors who are better looking than him . 
  i do n't get it either . 
  yeah iirc 10 guy was actually even against legalization and overall from what i gathered from people who met him he was kind of a dick . 
  he was drunk everytime people ran into him though but still . 
  eating horse meat is not rare .
