  dash berlin :, 
  jeffrey sutorius, 
  2 out of 3 . 
  i know the = sign is n't technically correct though . 
  i agree with what you 're saying but that has absolutely zero to do with hipsters . 
  hipster does n't mean any sort of behaviour you disagree with . 
  no , they 're on the same level as you . 
  does n't mean op is a dumbfuck like you . 
  i would n't say i 'd kill my mom to bang * insert any hot chick *, 
  yet they are the best subreddits reddit has to offer, 
  dxm is awesome . 
  itt neck beards with no experience and too much trust in school drug `` education '' . 
  i remember when we hit 42,000, 
  get off my lawn, 
  also mild brain damage is not that uncommon for anyone who leaves their computer once in a while . 
  having `` brain damage '' does n't automatically make you retarded . 
  ever had a concussion ? 
  you have brain damage . 
  `` avoid this player '' does n't do shit . 
  in hut sometimes you meet an opponent you do n't want to play against or they do n't want to play against you . 
  i 've tried the `` avoid this player '' feature to avoid having to quit/having them quit but it does nothing . 
  i 've `` avoided '' and then gotten the same player for the next 5 tries . 
  i do n't get all the hate on shootouts . 
  ties suck . 
  everything about them sucks . 
  the best thing hockey has done in the past years was eliminate ties . 
  i hate seeing ties when watching soccer . 
  yes the shootout is n't perfect but you ca n't realistically have a continuous ot in regular season games . 
  i have n't seen any better suggestions . 
  besides i do n't see anything wrong with `` deciding nhl points on stuff like this '' . 
  that was a skillful deke attempt and a great save . 
  just because it 's something these 50 or 60 year old sports commentators are n't used to seeing does n't make it automatically bad . 
  i was entertained , and it certainly took a lot of skill and effort from the goalie to save that one , what 's the problem ? 
  i personally love the shootout . 
  whenever a game goes to ot i hope they wo n't score in the 5 mins . 
  thay guy was super beta, 
  it 's not just diving . 
  it 's the way they stop playing and take time to get up every time even take the slightest bump . 
  compared to sports like hockey . 
  i know they wear pads and have line changes but they never give up . 
  inb4 sidney crosby and mike smith gifs, 
  wow that 's cool, 
  finally i have a reason to ever press the search button, 
  on a serious note though i 'd take the 3 minutes to unfriend and add 10 friends for a burger even if that means their advertisement works . 
  all i have is `` internet search '' . 
  and i rather use the browser and google since it 's just as fast and , well , google . 
  $ 170 value for $ 19.95 . 
  sounds legit !, 
   they should really take it back to the store for a refund . 
  yeah let me just go all the way to the store to get a $ 2 refund on a carton of juice . 
  i 'd definitely be in contact with the manufacturer but returning it to the store ? 
  i 'm a broke ass student and even i 'm not that desperate for change . 
  i 'm trying to figure out if majority of europe is 1-19 % or 20-39 %, 
  that 's actually a cool idea . 
  while on the subject why is the worker status / 24 ? 
  having only watched beta i thought it included the gasses and would therefore be 18 on minerals but apparently not . 
  are we supposed to have 24 svc 's on minerals for maximum efficency ? 
  i thought it was around 16-18 . 
  ( 8 mineral patches * 2 workers = 16 ) . 
  e. http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/images2/thumb/c/c6/starcraft_ii_zerg_harvesting_chart.jpg/800px-starcraft_ii_zerg_harvesting_chart.jpg ok this explains it, 
  thanks for the quick answer everybody, 
  icarus has rich gasses and is used in many tournaments . 
  yeah i do n't like `` always online '' just like anybody else but that 's not even the biggest issue . 
  do you think simcity 's drm choice had been the top headline everywhere had the game actually worked ? 
  always online is n't the reason they 're getting all this hate for , it 's always online that does n't fucking work . 
  if the servers and the software had functioned properly it 'd be a small sidenote in reviews , not the title . 
  i know it sucks and when they announced always online i made the decision not to preorder . 
  no need to convince me . 
  but there 's a long way from reddit comments or forum posts to the headlines of every gaming website . 
  i agree it 's bullshit either way but there 's a big difference between bullshit that 's only a minor inconvenience and bullshit that makes you unable to play the game . 
  i 'm clearly not doing alcohol right, 
  i agree and i disagree . 
  fighting definitely is n't a gimmick , always . 
  there are many times it is though . 
  this one was pretty gimmicky . 
  what happened to finland ? 
  it 's not in the `` not mentioned '' category so it must 've been mentioned ? 
  i know it 's gross but [ here 's a picture ] ( http://harmfuldruginfocenter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mcdonalds.jpg ) of the burn wounds . 
  it was a serious injury , the coffee was around 90c or something like that . 
  way too hot to be served . 
  sounds about right . 
  i live in finland and the big mac is 4.10 $ ( $ 5.35 ) or 6.50 $ ( $ 8.50 ) for the meal . 
  norway is known to be an even more expensive country so 6 bucks would n't surprise me at all . 
  my ping ( on speedtest.net ) is 3ms . 
  over wifi . 
  i do n't think wifi makes much of a difference these days . 
  i do n't think wireless connections make a big difference . 
  i just tested my connection on speedtest.net over wifi and got a ping of [ 3ms ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/2577891694.png ) . 
  131 is really fucking high though , i wonder what sort of a connection op has . 
  131ms sounds more like a mobile connection than a broadband . 
  distance definitely does matter as the data ca n't go faster than light speed even if everything else was set up perfectly but distance is not the only thing that can affect ping . 
  well i said there were gross wounds [ what did you expect ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1qdbthiwb1qgiqxmo1_500.png ), 
  that 's all cool but if you look at the pic i already posted i got 3ms ping ony my laptop connected via wifi . 
  xbox is in the same internet and no lag . 
  i really do n't think wireless connections make a big difference in ping these days . 
  also i do n't have a modem . 
  my desktop computer is directly connected to the wall and shares the internet wirelessly to my laptop and xbox . 
  there is a rj 45 plug in the wall . 
  this is common in modern buildings , mine was built in 2012 . 
  if fact there are 6 rj 45 plugs in the wall all sharing a 100mbit connection .
