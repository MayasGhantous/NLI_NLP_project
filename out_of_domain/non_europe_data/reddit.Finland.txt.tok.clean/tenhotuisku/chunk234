  the possibility of one of the other doors being correct is 66 % . 
  an incorrect one of the two will always be eliminated so the remaining one has a 66 % of being right . 
  so basically you 're picking between one door ( 33 % ) or two doors with one incorrect eliminated ( 66 % ) . 
  it 's really simple if you go through the possible scenarios in your head . 
  if you pick 1 and 2 is correct 3 will be eliminated . 
  if you pick 1 and 3 is correct 2 will be eliminated . 
  if you pick 1 and 1 is correct either one can be eliminated . 
  in 2/3 of those scenarios changing doors would result in guessing the correct door . 
   basically it has to do with the fact that the person opening the doors knows what 's behind them . 
  i do n't think this really matters as long as the door opened by the host is incorrect . 
  probabilities ca n't read people 's minds so i do n't think intentions matter . 
  but like i said this is only as long as the door the host picks is incorrect . 
  yeah but that 's only if there 's a possibility that the host opens a correct door . 
  what i said above is that ** if ** the host opens an incorrect door it does n't matter whether he did it intentionally or accidentally . 
  i realize that but i do n't think you understand what i 'm saying . 
  let 's assume the host does n't know which door the prize is behind and can choose the `` correct '' one . 
  in this case the 33v66 does n't hold as a general rule like it does when the host can not pick the correct door ** but ** for a single participant who is in a situation where he picked a door and then the host picked an incorrect door it would be 33v66 instead of 50v50 regardless of the fact that the host picked the door randomly . 
  you were married before you moved out of your parents ' house ? 
  let me guess , american ? 
  i prefer paying online beforehand so i do n't have to do the whole change or pin code thing . 
  i do n't know about the moving with no money but americans get married like crazy . 
  i have around 200 facebook friends from the u.s and 200 from finland ( only including people roughly my age , 22 ) . 
  around 30 + of the americans are married , 0 of my finnish friends are married . 
  maybe living in rural u.s versus a city in finland also plays a role but my american high school had ten times as many pregnant chicks compared to finland . 
  many of those girls are now married . 
  power bottom ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're mistaken since this was a gonewild post about 2 months back . 
  e. i was able to find one of the posts but the account has been deleted :(, 
  i 'm trying to google the original source and have to admit it 's possible the gw post was a fake , then again a lot of pics spread from gw to other sites so you never know where it was originally from, 
  [ this album ] ( http://xhamster.com/photos/gallery/391145/felicia_baker.html ) claims it 's `` felicia baker '' and there are some more similiar pics, 
  0:22 is that a tooth flying in the air ? 
  at least in minnesota broadcasts they remember to mention every game that wild actually has the most miles traveled this season . 
  e. [ yeah it 's minnesota ] ( http://www.ontheforecheck.com/2013/1/13/3872026/nhl-travel-miles-super-schedule-2013-back-to-back-games ), 
  dallas stars 29,482, 
  los angeles kings 28,132, 
  satanist satan is not the same as christian satan . 
  how 's that even leg . . oh yeah america . 
  do n't take this the wrong way because you 're really hot naked but i found the left picture to be way sexier than the right one . 
  this was my immidiate thought too after seeing the title . 
  some sort of charity event or something . 
  `` senior hockey player '' sounded like someone in a 50yr + beer league or something . 
  could n't find it on youtube . 
  video ? 
  the game was captured . 
  the hit was n't . 
  it was really weird watching him skate off the ice in that video knowing he died a few hours later . 
  i wish someone paid me six figures to reddit . 
  then again getting enough money to live an enjoyable life doing nothing is nice too . 
  so is it a joke or not ? 
  ** i need to know **, 
  well that 's a sick hold . 
  noob question but i was never able to figure this one out . 
  how do you make the medivac drop units one by one while on the move without looking at it like you did at 4.25 ? 
  \\  in the military, 
  \\  proud of him, 
  i do n't know for a fact about france but criticizing the government 's immigration policies is a crime in many european countries . 
  i 'm not so sure about wikipedia 's translation of `` demagogue '' but that 's a crime in finland and sweden at least . 
  oh so you did infact touch it while that was going on ? 
  must have missed that click . 
  e. ooooh i get it now . 
  so it 's not possible to shift-queue ? 
  ( medivac waits for all units to drop before moving ), 
  i 'd like to see this video if anyone has it feel free to pm . 
  no dick pics though please . 
  you can send pm 's on your phone . 
  or i can wait !, 
  does n't the commenter have an anime profile pic as well ? 
  or poop simulator ? 
  there are a lot of things going on in facebook i do n't get, 
  changing the feed does n't really fix it when one stream has announcers biased the other way and one the other . 
  my life has n't been the same since i found out my neighbor is also a googler, 
  unfortunately you ca n't mute the announcers without also muting the ice sounds . 
  that takes a lot away from the experience . 
  next you 're gon na tell me it did n't actually happen, 
  so you 're not really in the shower then ? 
  why not just take a shower and smoke a joint afterwards feeling fresh and clean in snuggly clean clothes ? 
  hot chocolate, 
  whenever i 'm high i do n't was dishes , brush my teeth or bath . 
  pretty much anything that does n't involve lying on a couch i do n't do . 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe it has to do with having been a referee myself . 
  i find it infuriating when the announcers call a clear call questionable just because of the team that got called on and especially vice versa when it 's a bad call but profiting the home team so they try to exxagerate what happened like it was a dirty play . 
  the worst of all is when there 's a scrum and the other team is cowardly and dirty while the home team 's actions are justified and `` the right thing to do '' when in reality it 's all the same . 
  i just feel like it 's underestimating the intelligence of the viewer and extremely condesending . 
  i actually was n't aware the teams were in charge of the broadcasts . 
  i do n't follow other american sports except for nfl and where i 'm from teams do n't have their own announcers nor channels so the announcers are always ( trying to be ) as unbiased as possible . 
  international tournaments are of course an exception but even there it can get a bit annoying . 
   and yes , it is condescending to the viewers . 
  but sadly a lot of tv today is about pandering to the lowest common denominator, 
  which is why i do n't even have tv  well i own one but it 's not hooked up to receive any broadcasts and just serves as an xbox/nhl/movie screen . 
  i 'm the opposite . 
  i do all my chores , school work etc , eat dinner , maybe take a shower , pick a movie and pause it at 00:00 or start up a video game , even pour a glass of soda and ** then ** i smoke weed . 
  i do n't like having to do anything after i 'm high . 
  the typical downvoted to oblivion comments in a post featuring an attractive woman are rarely any more explicit than `` you 're hot '' . 
  i do n't have an ashtray indoors because i 'm not a savage . 
  well it 's a pretty fucking valid point, 
  weed is way too expensive around here for that, 
  420 blaze it faggot, 
  i hate it . 
  i absolutely hate it .
