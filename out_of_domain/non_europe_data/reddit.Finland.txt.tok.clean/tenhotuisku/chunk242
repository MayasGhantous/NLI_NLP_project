  half the ads on american tv are credit score checks or at least mention credit score in some way . 
  reddit constantly has posts about buying shit on a credit card even when you do n't need to to `` improve your credit score '' or tips and tricks on how to boost your score ( mainly buy shuffling money around excess bank accounts ) . 
  i have never in my life even heard of my credit score . 
  i 'm pretty certain there is no such thing . 
  sure banks have their own records but where i live you basically either have credit or do n't have credit , nobody gives a shit about any `` credit score '' . 
  if you have never missed a payment or had other issues , you have credit . 
  if you 've missed enough payments for a debt collector to step in you do n't have credit . 
  that 's it . 
  if it makes more sense to you you can think that everyone starts with a credit score of 1 unless it 's reduced to 0 . 
  it 's not a game where you try to score points by tricking the system . 
  then again americans seem to like to turn everything into games of tricking the system . 
  just look at their laws . 
  joke 's on you , i do n't remember the last time i purchased something with physical money . 
  yeah and i do n't leave the house because i do n't want to get struck by lightning . 
  i 'd rather not have to take the few minutes to do something unnecessary ** and ** always have the feeling that it 's possible i might 've forgotten to pay something . 
  i get you 're just trying to make a pun here but never ever have i seen the dean enter a scene and thought `` that 's delightful '' . 
  i know there is such a thing where you live . 
  i do n't think i ever said otherwise . 
  i understand it can be hard to apprehend but things are n't exactly the same around the world . 
  stoned out of my mind crushing on annie like a 15 year old ? 
  because that 's how i watch every episode . 
  verb, 
  arrest ( someone ) for a crime . 
  understand or perceive . 
  but yeah you 're right comprehend does sound better, 
   the amount of politicians that get elected with 50 % of the vote is very small . 
  eh , not ? 
  [ most countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:electoral_systems_for_heads_of_state_map.svg ) use a two-round system which requires you to get more than 50 % to win . 
  essentially any good or service somebody consumes works by margaret thatcher asking not to have a state funeral ? 
  what ? 
  it 's like you 're trying to outwit rhymoid , but really you 're just making his point for him . 
  are you religious or from a religious family or region by any chance ? 
  not trying to dis either but `` answering to a higher power '' is a very key element in almost any religion and growing up around that mentality could explain why you * quote * ca n't understand how someone does n't feel the need to explain their actions . 
  same thing but i do have to wonder what this is doing on this sub . 
  sport officials making the correct call now qualifies as justiceporn ? 
  do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the video but justiceporn ? 
  either skillz or reddit 's crowd has turned into even more ass burger when human interaction 101 gets thousands of upvotes . 
  i do n't remember thinking they were especially long . 
  wow i was procrastinating on vinepeek a couple days ago and i think i randomly saw a video of this very exact thing . 
  i 'll see if i can find it . 
  e. here it is https://vine.co/v/bfalb2tmvov i think the picture is of the one on the right in the video, 
  i think the biggest issue ss would have is fs using ** a lot ** of finnish words and structure . 
  if the fs knew he was talking to ss there would probably be no problems but if the ss was eavesdropping a conversation between two fs he 'd maybe understand 2/3 or even just half of what 's said . 
  oh definitely . 
  i 'm pretty sure i grabbed my laptop and just let it play on the background . 
  i usually do this at least if it was a decent game , most games have good songs during the credits . 
   each breath you take is about half a liter, 
  i remember in middle school we measured our lung capacity and i think around 5l was the average . 
  while i realize we do n't breathe in our entire lung capacity while just lying down relaxing i would still think it 's more than half a liter . 
  what ? 
  since when is it not the norm ? 
  everyone i know feels a little `` off '' the next day after blazing . 
  it 's not a hangover but kinda `` cloudy '' idk how to describe it in english . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's normal , especially with low tolerances . 
  in this context they 're very much the same and even if not i 'd call it both normal and the norm . 
   lung capacity is different to tidal volume . 
  i think i made it clear i understood this difference . 
  however i was doubting whether the difference was really that big . 
  having smoked weed for a long time and in plentiful quantities i can assure you it is most definitely not placebo . 
  no it 's different from being tired . 
  besides i sleep just fine `` on weed '' . 
  it was me !, 
  i was the 20.000 th !, 
  besides , survival of the fittest etc. 
  you have to undertand that on reddit split second decisions made in a conversation 10 years ago have to be able to pass every possible hypothetical question out of the 8000 comments you 'll get . 
  you 're welcome ? 
  you 're downvoted but it 's a good point . 
  for example in finland you must give 50 % to your children in your will . 
  actually i did as well and knew that the only comment admitting this would be buried like it was . 
  why would i wan na stream with a shit quality when i can watch hdtv for free as well ? 
  / r/news is n't a default sub ? 
  wow i never realized that . 
  i did n't mean to imply that . 
  more like a `` if you liked this you might enjoy ... '', 
  why would n't you disable the auto-correcting immediately after buying the phone ? 
  how is it any less selfish to watch the news report at home and do nothing than to watch ellen and do nothing ? 
  i do n't think that was implied . 
  i can see you do n't recognize the reference so i 'll just explain it to you . 
  call of duty 4 had two missions in chernobyl . 
  both of them ( especially the second one ) we 're really difficult . 
  when you die in call of duty you see a random `` war quote '' . 
  the one above was one of the quotes in cod4 . 
  like i said the chernobyl level was difficult so people saw that quote a lot while playing the chernobyl level which also included an amusement park . 
   consoles are like lighting your money on fire . 
  so a $ 300 system which 's exact hardware games are designed for for 10 years is lighting your money on fire , but a $ 1500 pc that needs to be updated every 2-3 years to be able to play new games is a solid investment ? 
  so he avoided having his account misused ** and ** a girl thinks he 's cute but some random people on the internet who ca n't remember his nickname for 15 seconds think he 's lying ? 
  yeah that 's definitely bad luck . 
  it 's called sarcasm . 
   support the troops, 
  you mean people stupid enough to give away their freedom and become mercenaries because a recruiter gave them a t-shirt and said they were gon na get so much poontang . 
  yeah definitely respect those guys . 
  are you certain ? 
  there 's a chick on mfc who often wears an outfit exactly like this and the body looks the same as well . 
  e. found it . 
  `` crimson_rosee '' . 
  here 's [ her twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/crimson_rosee ) and [ here 's ] ( https://twitter.com/crimson_rosee/status/314774738872451073 ) this exact picture originally posted by her . 
  i have a 9 year old console . 
  it still plays new games released this month . 
  so i do n't see how that can be a myth . 
  how about you , have you spent any money in your computer in the last 9 years ?
