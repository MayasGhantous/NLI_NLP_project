  how can one not take `` your brain does n't seem to be fully functional '' as an insult ? 
  nobody cares about this particular dude or his actual backstory . 
  it 's a good pic to illustrate the point . 
  there are plenty of people who look like this and have n't been injured in the military . 
  internet, 
  she 's not * that * fat, 
  so 167cm and 90kg ? 
  unless you 're a weight lifter you 're fat and look fat . 
  not that there 's anything wrong with that , but do n't try to bullshit anyone that you do n't . 
  no matter how `` put together '' you dress . 
  probably . 
  but i would n't consider everyone who 's technically overweight to automatically be fat . 
  at least if you go by bmi which i believe is what 's used to determine whether or not someone is overweight . 
  because few people are dicks enough to take pictures at a gym . 
  [ this one ] ( http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/61/13/c4e82767b52dd467c0af414c34318d39-leg-day-1.jpg ) is used pretty often though . 
  does this sound like a college final to you ? 
  indeed it is , yet it 's used all the time . 
  whether it 's physical exams or headlines about obesity they always use bmi . 
  because nuketown sucked dick in bo1 and it sucks dick in bo2 . 
  then again op plays tdm so it is surprising he does n't like nuketown . 
  i was so glad when they announced nuketown would be preorder/dlc only so i knew i would n't have to play it as i never preorder game . 
  then they went and gave it to everyone . 
  shit sucks . 
  i do n't know whether op was joking but i literally had tons of nightmares from this episode . 
  probably more than about any other subject and they were the worst too . 
  i remembered that cave episode as some sort of an epic adventure . 
  then i rewatched it from youtube about a year ago and it 's 5 minutes . 
  i could 've sworn it was closer to 60 minutes . 
   unranked also matches against ranked . 
  what ? 
  is this true ? 
  source ? 
  i assume by single player you mean 1v1 ? 
  you can block the player if you do n't like bm . 
  nobody should be banned for bm . 
  `` you look like someone who 's brain is n't fully functional '', 
  it 's the stomach, 
  i bet a few euros on bruins taking the series 4-0 , so i have [ actual proof ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m1mssg5.png ) i saw it coming :p, 
  and why ? 
  skyrim is only good for the beautiful world . 
  everything else about it is shit . 
  if i did n't have a pc that could run it properly i 'd just play something better . 
  i said it 's a beautiful game ( especially with the correct mods ) . 
  without the visuals , it 's not even worth starting up . 
  i 'd make sure to wash my dick somewhere between jerking off and going to the movies with a girl . 
  that unnecessary fedora notion ruined the immersion for me . 
  i did n't notice anything `` ironic '' about it . 
  still funny though . 
  ( user was banned for this post ), 
   for the hardware, 
  the most important piece of hardware has been released though . 
  the controller . 
  i do n't know how these playstation 4 announcements are making me feel . 
  everything sounds so good but it 's making me mad because the controller 's still horrible . 
  and they even found a way to make it worse !, 
  that 's a deal breaker if i ever saw one . 
  i do n't have bo2 on ps3 so i have zero factual insight to give but i have owned cod 's on both consoles in the past and the x360 seems to have a much higher level of play even on public servers . 
  i get way more killstreaks and a better k/d every time i play on ps3 , even though i 'm more used to the 360 controller . 
  if you look [ here ] ( http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/?name=call+of+duty ) you 'll see the 360 version has outsold the ps3 with every cod , which might have something to do with it . 
  or maybe the type of people who buy the consoles ( i know ** tons ** of casual gamers who buy the ps3 mostly as a bluray player and to play a little bit of vidya once a month or so ) dragging down the average . 
  i 'm pretty sure op is the only person in the history of the universe to have this problem . 
  it 's better than tonight show was . 
  late night is still the best conan show by far . 
  yeah . 
  the controller is still terrible . 
  it 's like the dualshock which was fine in 1995 but definitely not ok in 2013 . 
  then they added that touch screen thingy . 
  the literally found the only way to make the dualshock worse . 
  seeing those hockey jerseys made me happy . 
  ca n't explain it , they just did . 
  yeah well i do . 
  that 's why i do n't play skyrim anymore . 
  we have mamma and pappa but those are swedish influences . 
  i call my mom mamma but my family has swedish background even though i do n't speak swedish ( my cousins do speak swedish as their first language for example ) . 
  coastal finland is more influenced by swedish than the inland parts , i can imagine somewhere out in the country they 'd never say `` mamma '' . 
  still i think it 's a little stupid they wo n't even let you try getting a full lobby for gun game . 
  i think it should be the player 's responsibility whether he wants to wait a long time to find a full game , they should n't just take away the option `` for your own good '' . 
  not brown enough to be india . 
  why would you not have the flashlight app in the easiest possible location ? 
  clearly having it tucked away in a folder somewhere is a bad idea , you 've noticed that yourself . 
  depends on which one you have . 
  he 's not really `` vanishing '' . 
  just leaving the country . 
  it 's not like the fbi is after him . 
  they wo n't deport you back to the states for unpaid alimony . 
  yea me too but i also factor how important it is to get the app open quickly/easily when needed . 
  my home screen is 60/40 apps i use all the time and apps i want to be able to open quickly even if they 're not in everyday use . 
  because hockey fans of the rest of the world are n't interested in the the # 1 hockey league there is ? 
  yeah i checked his/her post history and it does seem he/she is american . 
  maybe he just adopted the superior standards :p, 
  by the way i 'm constantly reading game threads and watch about a game a night , not all of us go to bed at eleven and wake up at sunrise . 
  wait a second . 
  what is that played on ? 
  because it definitely looks like pc , but the way the player moves definitely makes me think he 's playing with a gamepad instead of a mouse . 
  the title of the video is, 
   battlefield 4 -- e3 multiplayer gameplay -- ** best moments **, 
  you should n't be that suprised there are cuts . 
  maybe it 's 2 commanders as in one per team ? 
  that makes sense . 
  i noticed it did say [ e ] when facing the elevator button .
