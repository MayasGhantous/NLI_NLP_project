  at first i thought it was multiplayer because of the [ tablet ] . 
  then i realized it was campaign because of the voices . 
  then i realized it was multiplayer . 
  xbox one and ps4, 
  this is not a game you play in a lobby full of random players . 
  this is a game you play with friends . 
  so unless you 're friends with a lot of obscenity yelling kids it should n't be like that . 
  i do agree thought that people would be just running checking every corner for loot instead of walking around calmly like in the video . 
  nooooooooooooooo . 
  rsv2 is not the highlight of anything . 
  the vegas games we 're decent run of the mill shooters . 
  have you even played the original rainbow six games ? 
  they were the highlight of the franchise . 
  or the first 3 splinter cell games if you 're more into that . 
  but raven shield will forever be my favourite game . 
  the last true rainbow six before the series got raped . 
  raped hard . 
  i remember that annoying uplay crap playing assassin 's creed on xbox . 
  before the release of xbox one for years every comment i had read about the design of the consoles was `` why ca n't they just be like standard hifi/home theater equipment instead of looking like toys '' . 
  and now they 're exactly that . 
  [ when i play a game i look at the tv screen and not the console ] ( http://gifwall.net/gif/gw-u8t6h.gif ), 
  \\  separate cable box, 
  what kind of a backwards ass country do you live in ? 
  what i hate is that they have n't done anything about the controller . 
  it still looks terrible . 
  and i do n't mean aesthetics . 
  yeah i too play pretty much anything that has tom clancy 's name on it ( hawx and endwar were terrible though ) but nothing the original rainbow sixes . 
  i still have n't forgiven them for making the series `` more appealing to the masses '' aka a gears of war clone . 
  oh of course there 's nothing wrong with it and it does n't `` bother '' me either , i do it all the time . 
  but i think it falls in the same `` breaking immersion '' category . 
  nobody walks in ( multiplayer ) games , you run from point a to point b as quickly as possible . 
  actually i 've noticed that especially if i 'm stoned i enjoy walking in single player games , especially ones that are immersive . 
  gta4 feels so much better when you move `` naturally '' instead of sprinting all the time when you 're not doing combat rolls . 
  i had a nes , a playstation , a playstation 2 , a gamecube , an xbox360 and now i 'm thinking about buying a ps4 . 
  not everyone 's a fanboy . 
  the irony of this pic is that what is depicted is the # 1 reason i 'm worried ps4 is already fucked up . 
  just look at that controller . 
  it looks terrible . 
  everything else about ps4 sounds great though , so i 'll probably just have to hope for a 3rd party controller that is n't complete garbage . 
  no they do n't , they sprint until the meter is empty , then walk while it 's refilling and then sprint again as soon as possible trying to optimize it so that they can sprint the most time possible :p, 
  stealth games are a different thing , but there are n't many online stealth games . 
  well the new xbox seems like a fuckup and nintendo has n't been a real option for almost a decade so i too am worried about the only remaining hope for the next generation of console gaming . 
  they did ? 
  that 's good news . 
  xbox live was always so much better than psn . 
  i do n't think it 's because japanese ca n't write code so it probably has to do with the whole being free thing . 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  i use twitch daily ( i watch a lot of starcraft ) but i fucking hate their servers . 
  while i am a lot more familiar with twitch i 'd gladly use another service that functioned better . 
  it depends on subs and likes and your individual contract and total channel views and adblock users etc. 
  that 's why it 's so secretive . 
  the bigger your channel is the bigger your cut is . 
  i had to check what pewdiepie was because of this comment thread . 
  i have nothing against immature humour but using a retarded `` baby voice '' and screaming is not immature humour . 
  it 's just . . retarded . 
  how one can play starcraft almost every day and be in gold league ( and na gold nontheless ) is something i can not comprehend . 
  i 'm not excited for the ability to record videos to get the most liked video on youtube . 
  i just want to be able to show my friends and maybe if it 's really good i 'll post it on the subreddit of that particular game and get like 80 upvotes . 
  poopfeast420 kappa, 
  rip day9, 
  or if you watch starcraft it 's, 
  zerg 1a race killing esports kappa, 
  all these bronze leaguers talking about balance ... failfish, 
  if u think zerg op thats why ur bronz lol, 
  stop feeding trolls failfish, 
  well it 's a lot closer to gears than it is to rainbow six, 
  well let 's just hope they made enough money off the deal with sony ( and microsoft ) to improve their services . 
  only an idiot pays $ 60 a year . 
  you can get 12 months off the internet for 30 $ and have the code in your email inbox within 15 minutes . 
  24 % in finland but i think that 's included in the 499 . 
  ** if ** the price in finland actually was 499 . 
  this is something countries like finland and ireland and sweden have to keep in mind , we paid more than the `` eurozone '' price in 360 launch . 
  i think it 's a big ** positive ** . 
  i 've always vastly preferred the xbox live online experience . 
  i 've played online with a ps3 less than 1/10 the time i 've played on xbox360 but i 've encountered more problems in that time . 
  not to even mention the functioning party chat and files and updates downloading on full speed ( i get maybe 1-2 mb/s on my 100mbit connection with the ps3 ) . 
  i 'll gladly pay for a superior service . 
  and i have enough faith in sony 's developers ' ability to code to suspect that being free was the main reason psn sucked so much dick compared to xbl . 
  as someone who 's going to buy a when ps4 next generation comes around i 'm glad about this announcement . 
  eh ... they took out teamwork , most of gear , patience and especially planning when they made the vegas games . 
  after playing that map 3 times it 's probably closer to `` yeah they collapsed c already '', 
  same thing here . 
  i was thinking about getting a ps4 later down the line or just a new pc but now i want it as soon as possible . 
  the division seemed by far the most interesting game this year and it 's only coming to the consoles . 
  i posted this on the other thread but i 'll copy-paste it here,

   as someone who 's going to buy a when ps4 next generation comes around i 'm glad about this announcement . 
  especially when it comes to a game that just came out or games that are more than a year old the xbox live simply outperforms the psn in every way imaginable . 
  a lot of time on ps3 i 'm not even able to connect to multiplayer servers in an old game . 
  i 'm switching over from 360 to ps4 next gen and i 'm glad to see this . 
  especially the games like the division or destiny or even possibly watch dogs ( i 'm still a bit unclear on the multiplayer side of the game ) require an internet service that fuctions well . 
  getting such a service is much more likely if you actually pay for it . 
  $ 5 a month is 16c a day . 
  i spend far more money on far less important things to whine about 16 cents . 
  it 's not trying to be geographically accurate . 
  it 's the map of the game area which is designed to be balanced out , varied and above all fun to play .
