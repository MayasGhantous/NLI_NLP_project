  also the op is right . 
  but then again it is also a fact that some things just are more awesome ( and therefore upvotable ) high . 
  i 've never seen any ads on reddit . 
  why would someone not use abp ? 
  e. if you mean the links to vaporisers i have no problem with those , it 's like a faq thing, 
  i do n't believe you 've ever actually been a [ 10 ], 
  `` smoking '' brand papers have those . 
  actually every king-size package i 've ever bought has had a `` running low '' warning paper in it . 
  well actually in every study i 've ever read tobacco has been ranked higher in addictiveness than opiates . 
  also , that quote was n't a part of this study . 
  it was from some old random study from the year 1999, 
  after the human subjects in the study stopped using marijuana ( they were continuously monitored in a secure research unit ) the cb1 receptors increased to normal levels in about ** 4 weeks ** . 
  this proves that the reduction in receptors is reversible . 
  4 weeks ? 
  challenge accepted, 
  i understand and totally agree that a doctor should know what medication you are already taking before prescribing anything new . 
  i just do n't think that this is impossible without a `` family doctor '' . 
  great job elaborating your view with logical explanations, 
  is stealing from a woman somehow less acceptable than stealing from a man ? 
  yeah because the man who created minecraft would n't be able to alter how the blocks spawn . 
  come on , it 's getting sad . 
  how is it possible to typo ** friend ** 4 times in just 7 panels, 
  you just ate dinner for the first time this year wut ? 
  do you have any idea why ? 
  have you tried continuing ? 
  it gets really amazing around the halfway point and has more boss-like enemies per level than most modern games have total , 
  it was an example of a harsh message . 
  but seriously though , fuck hippies . 
  you did n't already do this ? 
  i thought this was common knowledge/logic . 
  no one ever told me to do it , it just makes sense . 
  no fucking way, 
  i live in finland ( one of the 4 dark blue countries ) and it is n't as glamorous as people try to make it out to be . 
  everyone here just thinks there is no corruption but the scandals in government during the last few years speak for themselves . 
  still though , if you ask almost any finn there is no corruption because we are an honest people and you should trust the government blindly . 
  i do now !, 
  is it worth watching ? 
  it 's one of the best action movies of the 21st century, 
  no one 's forcing you to be here, 
  ten minutes ? 
  kids these days ... 
  i only played for about 60 seconds . 
  after that the urge to reinstall max payne got too high, 
  i already upvoted this post for the title , so after reading it i had to log in with a novelty account just to upvote it again . 
  cool story but, 
   the guy knifes threw a part of a screen in window probably a box cutter, 
  awwww, 
  if you can fit both legs into one side you might want to try a smaller size, 
  what ? 
  there were no guns ? 
  i have to watch this again tonight . 
  yeah i know what a box cutter is , i just did n't realize what you meant by screen . 
  also the grammar was a bit . . odd . 
  based on the 1/10 of a second of boob visible i 'd much rather see a gif about them titties & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  name ? 
  sauce ? 
  i remember watching this as a kid when i barely understood anything they said . 
  downloaded it again last year . 
  definitely worth it . 
  yeah if you want to pay to get lower quality then sure, 
  well he was n't `` so good '' . 
  he was still the worst character and a bit annoying . 
  just not nearly as annoying as he was in everything since then . 
  i remember throwing one of those bottle rocket type firecrackers like this and having it swoosh by my head . 
  probably 2 inches or so . 
  i was 9 at the time , have n't fucked with fireworks since . 
  i had totally forgotten about this . 
  oh the memories , rushing back to my head . 
  eating some finnish salmiakki as i type . 
  shit is good son . 
  yeah no problem man , i actually just thought you were really really high, 
  last year my favourite milk company had a bad batch of milk cartons ( i guess ) . 
  for like 6 months none of them would open properly . 
  luckily after a few weeks i realized they opened just fine from the `` wrong '' side . 
  because who does n't want to be the villain ? 
  only in america is a picture of a topless woman standing on a field considered some sort of porn, 
  yeah because all men should automatically fall to their knees in praise if any woman shows anything . 
  fuck off white knight . 
  in 3rd grade french classed my pencil rolled of my desk and fell on the floor . 
  we had a new substitute that only spoke french ( i 'm finnish ) and she started yelling le principal !, 
  le principal !, 
  so i went to the principal office ( alone ) and told him what happened . 
  luckily he sided with me and told me to fuck around for 5 minutes and then return to class like i had been punished , 
  not only does weed make you hungry it also supresses the feeling of being full so yes , it does enhance your performance . 
  military hater reporting in, 
  all games sealed ? 
  downvote, 
  fake . 
  why ? 
  because dad would n't see what he browsed in incognito mode . 
  that 's the point of incognito mode . 
  yup , she is ridiculously hot though, 
  i 've played minecraft for about 60 hours and this is the first time i learned that there is actually music in the game . 
  i guess i must 've disabled it the first time i started up the game . 
  because i did n't even get this comic , i thought it was like his own special mc soundtrack or something . 
  well i 've been paranoid but not like a horrible trip , more like futurama fry `` do they all know i 'm high '', 
  what else ? 
  thongs ? 
  i enjoy girls with panties 10 times more than thongs . 
  i 've been underwear shopping with girls/women plenty of times , never has anyone looked at me strangely ( or that i 've noticed ) .
