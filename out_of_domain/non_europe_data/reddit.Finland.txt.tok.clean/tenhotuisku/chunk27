  i think you 're doing it wrong . 
  i am a bf and i admit to doing all of this, 
  you work 90 hours a week ? 
  or was that for the two weeks ( 45h per week ), 
  haha i came here to post that my extensive knowledge in frozen pizza leads me to believe this is casa di mama :d, 
  nice to see i was right, 
  e. and yes it truly is the best crust ( of frozen pizzas ), 
  more precious than lapis ? 
  i do n't even mine lapis anymore when i see it , i have fucktons of it everywhere . 
  i 've never tried one on but i believe you . 
  and i do n't think they look sexy at all either . 
  i would steal everything and rape so many fucking women . 
  i have absolutely no problem with it as long as i 'm guaranteed not to get caught . 
  also i 'd wipe out the population of africa and india ( for starters ) saving the human race from overpopulation . 
  i know i 'll get downvoted , luckily i do n't give a fuck about karma . 
  deal with it . 
  in behalf of f7u12 i thank you for ( appropriately ) prioritizing reddit over job interviews, 
  i 'm 20 and i loooove living at home, 
  your life sounds pretty crappy, 
  would you wash a video of a guy washing dishes for 8 hours ? 
  no you would n't because he 's just doing his job and it 's boring . 
  now would you watch a video of a dish washer boy going nuts and thworing all the plates at customers ? 
  i know i would . 
  why would they ? 
  if a cop acting calm is interesting or rare enough for it to be newsworthy and `` front page - worthy '' i think there 's something seriously wrong with your local police force . 
  of all the cops i 've encountered none have been this nice, 
  i do n't love you, 
  it 's also a choice to stop breathing . 
  i recommend it . 
  most problems in america would be solved if you could somehow get rid of the religious people . 
  just saying, 
  well genocide does have a bad ring to it, 
  what comments ? 
  you mean this ? 
   of all the cops i 've encountered none have been this nice, 
  emphasis on ** this ** nice . 
  most of my encounters have been pretty neutral, 
  reminded me of [ this ] ( http://www.voodootattoo.fi/images/big/isot63.jpg ), 
  soo . . what stopped them from shooting to the legs ? 
  why is it that american cops always shoot to kill ? 
   you run at cops with a knife , you 're going to die . 
  protect and serve ftw, 
  the article never stated that he was running, 
   police said that olivas was `` waving '' a knife as he walked toward officers . 
  if you ca n't hit a person standing/walking towards you in the thigh you are a lousy shot . 
  and it 's not like olivas had a weapon he could fire from the ground , one shot to the legs would had made a knife attack impossible . 
  i would really like to know how many shots the officers fired at his `` center mass '' . 
  do n't get me wrong i think it was justified to use a lethal weapon at that point , but there are varying degrees of shooting someone . 
  e . according to the arcticle there were ** 14 gunshots ** after the bean bags . 
  are you seriously saying those last 12-13 were necessary ? 
  also nice downvoting , douche . 
  i thought we were having a civil conversation . 
  yes , i 'd take a real gun and shoot him once or twice in the thighs , whatever is necessary to stop him and end the threat . 
  i would not shoot him ** 14 times ** in the stomach . 
  that 's not eliminating a threat , that 's making sure he 's dead . 
  what do you mean i 've watched too many action movies ? 
  real police ca n't shoot someone in the legs ? 
  then why is it that anywhere outside the u.s they always , always shoot for the legs ? 
  ( except if the situation absolutely demands a kill , like an explosive threat ), 
  also i used to shoot targets as a hobby and if it was my profession to carry a gun i believe i could hit someone in the legs . 
  i watched the first video and he was nowhere near 21 feet when the attacker started his attack , more like 7-8 feet . 
  also it 's a forest , not a paved road . 
   aiming for the legs is never ever ever a viable option . 
  it 's funny how outside u.s cops always shoot for the legs . 
  for example in finland there are multiple police involved shooting each year , however in the last 15 years there 's been two ( 2 ) shootings where the suspect died . 
  because finnish police does n't shoot to kill . 
  yes there is . 
  maybe in the american police manual there is n't but that speaks more about the quality of your policing than what is reasonable . 
  less than a second to react ? 
  they fired bean bags and tried to talk to him before they shot him . 
  do you think they just kept their guns holstered that entire time just so that they could have a wild west type of fast draw and less than a second to react ? 
  it 's not shooting to the limbs rather than center mass but shooting to stop the threat rather than shoot to kill . 
  even shots to the legs are often ruled excessive force over here , a shot to the chest has to be extremely justified not to create an uproar . 
  the finnish police did just shoot a man in the chest last fall which is why this was discussed a lot in the media and why i remember the last fatal gunshot by a police was from the 90 's even though officer involved shootings happen multiple times a year . 
  that shot was clean btw , the one last fall . 
  how is this based on movies ? 
  if something is n't it more movie-like to just kill everyone without even thinking about alternative options that would end the situation without killing a taxpayer and a citizen ? 
  and fyi outside the states shooting to the legs is considered to be the default option , cops do n't aim to kill people . 
  yes there is . 
  why in the world would there not be ? 
  he shoots to disable the threat , his primary goal should never be to kill anyone . 
  i guess my parents are n't annoying ? 
  idk i 'm always in my room anyway and they do n't come upstairs . 
  i get free food and my laundry done . 
  i do n't pay rent and have all the newest technology because i have no expenses . 
  what 's not to love ? 
  so if a police thinks his nightstick is n't enough to stop the threat he automatically has no other options but to kill ? 
  what . 
  the . 
  what if the suspect survives ? 
  do the police have to confirm their kills with a shot in the back of the head ? 
  i know there is n't a safe place to shoot , but some places are safer than others . 
  also shots to the legs work great towards stopping someone from moving . . with his legs . 
  yes you do . 
  it is common practice around the world when it comes to police . 
  in most countries police ** never ** shoot to kill but always to the legs . 
  especially when the suspect does n't have a firearm . 
  `` you never shoot to wound '' just makes absolutely no sense because there 's a large gap between people you can defend from with your nightstick and situations where killing is the only possible option . 
  police should never shoot to kill , they shoot to stop the threat and if the suspect dies that is unfortunate , but it should never be the primary goal of a police officer to kill another citizen . 
  of course any shot can be lethal , but some areas are still more dangerous than others,
