  if i 'm vaping i 'll easily burn through ( e. pun not intended ) 0.3-0 .5 in an hour . 
  i am aware of the use of abv . 
  i used to do it a lot when i used to use shittier , cheaper vapes like the iolite or mflb and it actually worked . 
  with the volcano , arizer or silver surfer you can squeeze so much more out of the bud , what remains is completely worthless . 
  i 've tried baking it and smoking it several times but i 'd just rather not . 
  it tastes bad and there 's maybe 1 % of the effect of fresh bud left . 
   all i can think of is that maybe you 're not fully cashing your herb , since you 're supposed to take hit after hit until it 's well-depleted . 
  which unit do you have yourself ? 
  i have the arizer solo which is great ( 9/10 ) but this `` friend '' i talked of who owns all the other ones is my next door neighbour . 
  so i go over there a lot and the one i use most is probably either the silver surfer or the extreme q ( both 10/10 when it comes to hit quality , 5/10 when it comes to ease of use ) . 
  i know how to take a hit , i do get really high off vapourizers ( though they seem to be more affected by tolerances than smoking ) , but i just simply do n't agree it 's cost-efficient . 
  it 's not terrible or use considerably more , but it 's definitely not better . 
  i used to watch them way back in moontv . 
  i think it was 99 or 2000 . 
  the reason knoxville is so nice to them and pretty much got them on american tv is that knoxville has called them an inspiration . 
  they 're also good friends of course . 
  there can be more than one inspiration for a show . 
  i remember seeing a johnny knoxville interview long before anyone had heard of the dudesons in the us and he said he considered them to be an inspiration . 
  this is the last season of the finnish dudesons iirc . 
  the first season to be filmed in english though . 
   weird that you do n't get high enough off it, 
  what what whaaat ? 
  did n't i just say in the post you 're replying to :, 
   i do get really high off vapourizers, 
  those exact words . 
  i simply said it is n't cost-effective . 
  does n't mean i do n't get high . 
  i would n't say i can get * as * high as by smoking , but it 's like [ 9.5 ] compared to [ 9.75 ] . 
  does n't really matter , you ca n't really compare the different highs anyway . 
  i do n't know about hiking but i live where we have 24hr sunlight . 
  basically it means you never have to move inside when drinking . 
  it 's great . 
  sun blocking curtains . 
  pretty much a necessity if you live this close to the arctic circle . 
  there 's light . 
  the sun 's just not as bright , goes from dawn to dusk without really ever going `` full power '' . 
  though you 'll probably spend that time of day at school/in work ... 
  having snow does help a lot though . 
  it reflects and magnifies ( probably not really , but gives the illusion of magnifying ) even the tiniest amount of light . 
  there probably is n't much grass if you were at this same latitude but in canada . 
  some trees probably but not much green . 
  thanks to the gulf stream though , that 's not the case in northern europe . 
  [ it 's quite colorful in the summer ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=finland+summer&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=2wevus3tdebx4qt8tygiag&amp;biw=2117&amp;bih=1315&amp;sei=4qevuttaguqc4atdvihwdg ) . 
  even more so in the fall . 
  most people living this close to the pole have sun blocking curtains . 
  i can get my bedroom pitch black even if the sun is shining right into my windows . 
  we also have really bright lights to stare at during winter . 
  fall out ? 
  i 've never had any kind of plug fall out from a socket . 
  the eu sockets are tight as fuck . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about , do you ? 
  it 's not a problem if i do n't have one . 
  if i 'm visiting someplace without a curtain i can still sleep , but i 've always had one in my own bedroom since i was a kid . 
  afaik my friends have them set up too in their homes , do n't know about their childhood homes though . 
  oh definitely . 
  having this `` zero tolerance '' and no regard to the fact that this `` pornography '' is a picture of yourself is totally retarded . 
  c'mon , let 's be honest here . 
  you do n't see anything wrong with this example ? 
  a 17 year old girl and her 17yo boyfriend have sex . 
  completely naked penis in the vagina sex . 
  it 's totally legal . 
  the boy leaves her house and later in the evening she willingly takes a pic of herself naked and sends it to her boyfriend she just had sex with . 
  they 're both now criminals . 
  guilty of a felony no less . 
  you really think this is the kind of law that makes for a functioning society and a nice place to live ? 
  or the kind of law that kinda makes sense in theory but is retarded in practice ruining people 's lives ? 
  why are all these links purple ? 
  it 's almost as if reddit was more than one person . 
  no i 'm not . 
  the age of consent is already 16 or 17 in most states . 
  that 's why it 's so ridiculous that it can be legal for you to have sex , but not share a naked picture of yourself with the person you 're having sex with . 
  it 's not the chemistry i 'm worried about . 
  after all it 's the same active ingredients . 
  it 's the appearance and comments from people doing it , [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/2i464hzm4km?t=1m58s ) being a typical example ( for a comment , not appearance :d ), 
  that 's not really justice porn . 
  nothing happened to the hamplanet , she got to keep her scooter . 
  well to be fair i 've traveled in about 25 countries in my life time and usa is the only country i 've seen these in . 
  so it 's not the proverbial `` only in america ! '' . 
  it 's simply `` only in america '' . 
  though i have heard they have these in the uk now , i 've just never seen one . 
  nice troll actually got some responses 6/10, 
  some white people steal more than most black people i know, 
  is this your first time playing an nhl game ? 
  they recycle the same lines since nhl07 and add a dozen new ones each year . 
  not that it matters though as i always turn the commentary off the first thing after turning the music off . 
  while you 're technically right this pretty much serves as the `` let 's discuss nhl 14 demo '' thread . 
  it 's not about the picture . 
  only betas pay desperate attention to every girl they see in public, 
  it 's not an insult . 
  it 's an observation . 
  and you 're doing a good job confirming it . 
  so you have n't played the game in 6 years and you expect to make perfect passes the first time you try ? 
  would n't that make it a pretty shitty game ? 
  there has to be a learning curve . 
  it 's not impossible , not even close . 
  it 's not about opinions . 
  we both agree image macros are banned . 
  however as i am not autistic i can get around this and see that while it is an image macro it serves a broader service , which is to be `` the nhl 14 demo thread '' , an annual event . 
  you however can not understand this because your brain treats these `` rules '' like a computer would . 
  the starting posts technically breaks some rules , so we should delete it , regardless of the discussion going on in the comments .
