  am i the only one who thinks that 's definitely a sex doll ? 
  i googled a bunch of these names and found messages referring to the places with these names from old 2011 threads . 
  i 've only played prepare to die myself but i remember seeing gameplay vids from an earlier version ( still release ) and it seemed to have much crappier english . 
  for example instead of `` recovery '' it 'd say `` you recovered '' and other minor differences like that . 
  i wonder if this is from a really early version , either before or after release . 
  e. i checked , and even that version from october 2011 with the `` less than smooth '' english did have the current location names . 
  however [ this post ] ( http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/51620/t1687034-bonfire-system-no-nexus/ ) is also from october ( albeit one day earlier than the video i watched ) . 
  `` the bonfire of the flame maiden in the festival grounds at the undead city '' . 
  [ this page ] ( http://darksouls.wikidot.com/game-patches ) says :, 
  version 1.04, 
  release date 2nd november 2011 ( japan only ), 
  fixed various english translation errors in the overseas version of the game . 
  so maybe there 's a difference in the pal/us version and the japanese version played on english ? 
  i actually went and looked at footage from the early jap release before eu version , the early eu version , possible betas , everything . 
  could n't find them called those weird names anywhere . 
  so who knows . 
  ok i think i finally got it . 
  they released a japanese map during this [ event ] ( http://darksoulswiki.wikispaces.com/dark+souls+event+june+11th+2011 ) and the 3rd party [ translations ] ( http://image02.w.livedoor.jp/p/k/project_dark/5f4adf64bd45143baa0b.png ) for that event spread on the internet before the game . 
  thus the references to the names , but no gameplay anywhere . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  things like this famously work reliably . 
  just like pretty much anything knifing related in any fps ever . 
  also dice said they specifically worked on making the knifing look like fluid and not like it 's `` snapping into animation '' . 
  inb4 `` oh bullshit that was totally from the front '', 
  now it is n't . 
  they are completely different games . 
  i like both , i vastly prefer battlefield , but cod is n't ripping off battlefield in any sense . 
  i 'm sure plenty of black people watch it , but despite the cast being black it really felt like ** everyone ** behind the scenes from writers to producers to wardrobe ... was white . 
  the show feels like white humor with black actors , unlike a lot of other `` black cast '' shows . 
  cod ghost doesnt have destructible environments . 
  it has `` dynamic map elements '' meaning one or two `` traps '' per map that you can activate by shooting at them . 
  hardly a new idea in the fps genre and i have n't heard anyone claim it to be . 
  well then that 's not the same at all :(, 
  i thought this was just a photoshopped pic and was like `` heh . . '' but this is a mod ?!, 
  awesome !, 
  they 're still great . 
  i just replayed both less than a year ago . 
  though i do get added nostalgia value but i 'm sure anyone who 's a fan of alan wake would have a similiar experience . 
  i 've donated multiple times but i do n't really get why ads on wikipedia would be that bad . 
  i 'd adblock them anyway so they only affect non-tech savvy folk and provide stable income . 
  i get the `` freedom of journalism '' argument , but if the ads were ads by google for example then none of the individual companies who 's advertisements are displayed would be directly paying wikipedia . 
  i think it 's fine . 
  it 's like the 6 billion people on this earth had differing views on world politics . 
  my first thought when seeing this pic was `` i 've never though about it , but how come this does n't happen more often ? '', 
  that 's the price of `` awesome free internet service '' . 
  i have a 100mbit connection , ps3 downloads like we 're in the 90s , xbox uses almost the full connection . 
  i truly do n't mind paying for it . 
  tbh i consider the paywall an advantage . 
  there 's double stuffs and i 've even seen triple stuffed oreos . 
  i want half-stuffed !, 
  i agree with this guy . 
  you ca n't always tell how well sound carries through the building until one of the neighbours tells you . 
  besides it 's often quicker than calling the cops . 
  does n't work ? 
  call the cops . 
  it 's probably easier to make a shitty post and get it on / r/cringepics than to make something `` actually good '' . 
  same amount of views anyway . 
  it 's old enough to be retro, 
  victim blaming !, 
  is the demo out in eu yet ? 
  i 've been following all this talk online yet yesterday when i tried to download it it was n't there ( xbox ) . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  it 's not a budget thing or a manpower thing . 
  they could easily outsource it for really cheap . 
  i mean a couple hundred bucks kinda cheap . 
  people do way cooler jerseys on their past time for fun on sites like this . 
  they would n't have to redesign them completely each year , but the price and effort to make those shitty jerseys we 've had for 7 years or so is probably equal to having not as shitty international jerseys . 
  it 's not easy living in the nordic countries . 
  i have to buy games off the monthly allowance the government grants me for studying in a free university . 
  i 've never seen this much love for scout_knivez !, 
  that map was the best . 
  yeah but to be fair i was talking about a school ranked in the world top 100 . 
  not community college . 
  i think most people agreed it was real . 
  what the video does n't show was the car circling around the block a few times before this was shot . 
  thus the `` perfect timing '' with the video camera . 
  also in the us . 
  there 's about a 10 sec delay in `` live broadcasts '' . 
  to be honest not a terrible idea . 
  a lot of people are switching over from 360 to ps4 . 
  i would n't mind paying full price for the last of us on ps4 . 
  as with the uncharted series . 
   why play the same game . . in a higher quality ? 
  . . it 's like watching a film on vhs then buying the same film on dvd then blu-ray . 
  just wait for the new film . . = /, 
  because it would n't be `` the same '', 
   a lot of xbox people are jumping ship to ps4 , so this might be the only version they play . 
  last of us is the only ps3 exclusive i 'm interested in and i 'm not gon na get ps3 just for it . 
  ps4 has no backwards compability . 
  i 'd pay full price for a ps4 remake of the original last of us . 
  it 's either that or watching it on youtube . 
  a streamable last of us on ps4 falls under the description of `` remake '' in this context . 
  higher steadier framerate is nice , but no one except you is talking about `` slight improvements '' . 
  we 're talking about people ** who never played the original because they did n't own ps3 but will ps4 ** . 
  yea but i already have a 360 that can play all the games ps3 can , except for those few exclusives . 
  i 'm not gon na buy a console approximately as powerful as the one i already own , especially when new ones are months away from release . 
  release date ( s ) march 14 , 2014, 
  well it is the world 's first 4d action game, 
  yeah but if you need to recommend it to someone we can assume they have n't seen it .
