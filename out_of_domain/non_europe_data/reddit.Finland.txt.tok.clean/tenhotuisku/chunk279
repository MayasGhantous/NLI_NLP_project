  imagine timmy from south park saying `` doggy '' . 
  xbox has their unique avatars . 
  one i have n't even touched since i set it up in 2007 . 
  and i play my xbox if not daily at least weekly . 
  i know it does n't really hurt anyone which is why i 'm not mad , but all this avatar bullshit is totally useless . 
  for 10 $ it 's ok and old cod games usually have some multiplayer alive as well , at least on 360 . 
   pop in a movie that uses thx and run thx optimizer . 
  \\  owning physical copies of movies, 
  it sounds awesome . 
  aaaaaand it 's f2p . 
  too bad , i would 've paid 60 $ for planetside 2 . 
  it 's nice and it works but i do n't know what 's 2.0 about this . 
  i learnt this as a kid the second thing after dry soda bottle bongs . 
  before even rolling joints or glass bongs . 
   the votes take place 3-4 a year , consisting of i 'd say 1-6 topics to vote on, 
   so the image of the swiss voting on every detail is misleading . 
  that 's quite a lot, 
  \\  but its still an accomplishment, 
  \\  video game rankings, 
  even if reddit was 100 % male it would n't `` explain the disgusting amount of misogyny '', 
  or today 's paper, 
  fuck scandinavia , am i right ? 
  i also think it 's pretty reasonable not to go apeshit over a teenager trying to buy beer either . 
  i do n't get this comic , it has this weird `` well he broke ** the law ** , all ** laws ** are equal '' vibe . 
  well you 're just gon na have to wait because it is n't gon na happen . 
  ctrl + f context original reference link, 
  you are stupid . 
  8 controllers is great for sports games etc. 
  it 's not enough to buy xbone instead o ps4 , but it 's a definite advantage . 
  you are n't the only one the console is manufactured for , and the support wo n't affect you in any way if you do n't use it . 
  thus making your `` opinion '' stupid . 
  in a literal way . 
  if i had to estimate i 'd say i 've played my 360 for about 4000 hours . 
  1500 hours alone , 500 hours with 2 players , 2000 hours with 4 players . 
  not everyone plays like you . 
  it 's manufactured for all of us , and having ** support ** does n't mean a customer is required to use the feature . 
   i am entitled to express my opinion . 
  you are . 
  does n't mean those opinions could n't be stupid . 
  there is no downside to having ** support ** . 
  you wo n't have to buy 8 controllers . 
  there is only positives that come from having support . 
  i hope this explains to you why your opinion is idiotic . 
  just because we 're entitled to our opinions does n't mean we ca n't say stupid shit . 
  80 % nhl/fifa, 
  i have played ** every ** 360 game that has local coop or 4p multiplayer . 
  some greeks are going to be mad but tomato tomahto . 
  with french fries ? 
  try barbequeing a steak , have some onions wrapped in tin foil in the bbq to go with it and tzatziki to cover it all . 
  or pretty much on anything to be honest . 
  yeah well i 'm sure it goes great with plenty of vegetable dishes as well . 
  i know . 
  i 've been to greece and i 'm not sure where doner is from but i 've had plenty of `` authentic doner '' . 
  i still stand by my argument of `` tomato tomahto '' though . 
  it should n't be taken as an insult , they 're just similiar dishes ( or ingredients ) . 
  idk you 're greek so obviously you know better but from what i remember gyros we 're served in restaurantas too . 
  not gourmet places but regular restaurants . 
  i remember some of them windows from the street to the kitchen meaning they also served `` fast food '' but it was far from any fast food i 've experienced . 
  meaning it actually tasted like quality meat . 
  pretty high , as the dealers often register a lot of the same cars at once thus giving them sequential license plates and cars bought from the same dealership often stay near the same area . 
  at least in the us wire transfering money from one account to another costs a shit ton of money ( depending on your bank ofc but generally ) . 
  in finland and many other eu countries it 's usually always free . 
  so if you have business to take care of in europe , it 's smarter to do it from a european bank . 
  i suck at * newest cod * so sometimes i play * any other cod * and i feel like a call of duty god . 
  ftfy, 
  all the kids and other enthusiasts that play the game every day usually play the newest ones . 
  majority of the people online in older cod games are people who really do n't care enough to buy the newest one on release day . 
  or you need to get your pussy ass out of r/wtf . 
  just a suggestion . 
  it 's one click on the settings to disable the `` approved ads '' . 
  it 's really no big deal . 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe if they staged some sort of a test ? 
  thanks for repeating the punch line i did n't get it the first time . 
   everyone used the same things . 
  it was only down to player skill that made the difference . 
  then how about playing games which are like that instead of playing the games exactly known to be the opposite ? 
  modern cod 's are all about perks and killstreaks and shit . 
  either play barebones or play older cods or counter-strike or any of the other dozens of good games that are n't all about perks class making . 
  it 's like you bought a ferrari and then complain that you do n't like sports cars that go fast . 
  it 's clear the whoever posted this know them to be right , otherwise they would n't get so butt hurt . 
  get a real job instead of passive aggressively venting about it online . 
  implying this `` friend '' actually exists . 
  there 's enough tomato paste in pizza to consider it a vegetable . 
  i 'm pretty sure the hamburger is much healthier than white bread . 
  it 's not available to all . 
  the lines here are so long that unless you want to suffer for months you got ta go to a private hospital . 
  which means you pay once for your treatment and then a second time in the taxes for treatment you never receive . 
  it 's a shitty system . 
  no it 's simply a crappy system . 
  i 'm definitely all for universal healthcare , but the finnish implementation needs to be completely rebuilt from scratch . 
  no there are a lot of differences within the nordic countries . 
  the worst thing about the entire thing is you ca n't criticize public healthcare . 
  99 % of the time you get one of the two comebacks :, 
  so it would be better if we had a system like usa and the poor would just die , huh !? 
  you get it for free and you still have guts to complain !? 
  is nothing enough ? 
  how about i wish my taxes were spent more efficiently so we 'd all get better universal health care ? 
  that 's not an option . 
  it 's either shut up or be a traitor .
