  i live in finland . 
  norwegians have an excellent system thanks to all that oil money . 
  sweden has a different system that 's not as bad but it 's facing some of the same issues . 
  basically their system is closer to state funded health insurance . 
  you can receive `` public service '' from a private doctor , unlike finland . 
  the situation is by far the worst in finland . 
  we have two infrastructures that overlap and the one we 're forced to pay for is shite . 
  true , but i think that 's also a valid point . 
  all that exercise does suck . 
  while i fully agree with you i also do n't think `` you 're a workaholic '' `` yes well my life is 3 hours of sleep , work , work , work . '', 
  is a very good comeback . 
  implying someone has actually played the gm mode against cpu since the year 2006, 
  this is exactly the sort of `` men 's rights activism '' i hate to see . 
  it 's not working to remove or ease gender issues . 
  this is the `` some feminists use ridiculous faulty logic to make fun of us so i want to make fun of them in return ! '', 
  kind . 
  the kind that gets nothing done . 
  the kind that makes me cringe and embarassed to be a part of this community . 
  i 've been to both public and private hospitals in europe plenty of times . 
  compared to the service you get in a private one the public hospitals are atrocious . 
  do n't get me wrong , i support the idea of a state run health care system that 's equal for everyone . 
  it 's just not as easy to implement in reality as it is to say `` free healthcare is good '' on an internet site . 
  looks like somebody 's got a case of the mondays, 
  yeah all this talk in this thread about how people are tired of the franchise etc. 
  maybe i just do n't think the next individual cod game is worth ? 
  i might still buy the next . 
  you need a peebib, 
  the part about the cost and lasting longer is true but, 
   they do n't taste as good, 
  you 'd want other people to stick their nose into your business ? 
  why ? 
  and how is this supposed to surprise anyone since if what you 're saying is true we spend just as little time thinking about others . 
  no it does n't . 
  if anything it makes it worse since now retards do n't even stop to think about whether or not it was sarcasm , they just check if there 's a '' / s '' . 
  besides , is n't the `` illusion '' what makes sarcasm fun ? 
  theoretically i like this idea ( as a gadget , not a business idea ) but as soon as he said the words `` block that affects the speed '' i cringed and realized this was made by some sort of design/art student instead of an engineer/computer scientist or some other professional who 'd actually have a clue how to design electric devices . 
  but is it really sarcasm if you go out of your way to make sure everyone understands that you 're being sarcastic ? 
  imagine if someone in real life said a sarcastic comment and followed it up with `` that was sarcasm '' . 
  you do n't think that 'd kinda kill the joke ? 
  i 've also made my own milkshakes . 
  they taste 10 times as good as ones that use flavouring . 
  are you people crazy or have you simply not tasted actual berries ? 
  i understand the point about convenience etc. 
  but i 've never heard anyone claim artificial flavouring tasted better than fresh fruit . 
  you do n't have to look that close . 
  did this guy even try looking at the picture before asking the question ? 
  i 'm not against artificial flavours or processed foods . 
  i know the type of people you 're thinking about , not it . 
  and actually i believe you when you say it 'd be possible to extract flavours and synthesize them into smething that tastes more `` authentic '' than the real stuff . 
  only problems is that 'd probably not be cheaper than using real fruit , and you do n't get the good pr of `` organic material '' . 
  so since the only real advantage artificial flavours do have are the price and convenience i do n't see really see companies investing into these super complex improved artificial flavours . 
  well of course it can be sweeter . 
  you can get a cup full of sugar or artificial sweetners if you like , but that would n't be a very good milkshake . 
  what 's this `` processing '' that removes taste ? 
  i take a bunch of fresh strawberries , put them in a blander , blend them , and it tastes great . 
  i 've never had a commercial smoothie that tasted better than simple fruit in a blender . 
  well that 's simply because they are different tastes . 
  i like bananas , i absolutely hate banana flavouring . 
  not because it 's artificial , but because i do n't happen to like this completely other taste that does n't resemble bananas at all . 
  that was never really the discussion . 
  we all agreed it was easier and cheaper . 
   the fact is , there are a number of reasons something that works in your kitchen does n't scale to an entire industry , or even a single restaurant, 
  well that is of course true . 
  but i consider that more of a limitation of the fast food industry . 
  they ca n't use real strawberries efficiently , so when they try the result is ** even worse ** than artificial flavouring . 
  not that aritificial flavouring ** tastes better ** than real fruit . 
  i know it 's basically the same thing and a matter of wording , but i feel it 's an important difference . 
  yeah well bob marley also believed people should n't use marijuana for recreational purposes so the `` bob marley '' idea of today has little to do with the original man . 
  yea you 're using safari, 
   for example , there 's a reason why ram on motherboards is n't on the opposite site of the board from the cpu any longer . 
  what is it ? 
  simply to minimize delays ? 
  something heat related ? 
  there does n't have to be a contract or monthly service fees just because it 's a phone . 
  besides having internet even while out of wifi reach is probably the main reason people would want the `` phone '' components . 
  a single tear rolled down my face the first time i saw jayden jaymes called a `` milf '' . 
  i think she was born in '87, 
  it 's definitely not cost effective , but it is enjoyable . 
  like getting drunk on an expensive wine . 
  i do n't think you understand that we 're actually agreeing . 
   the bank receiving it has your money . 
  they benefit from that money . 
  this is the same as, 
   the point of banks is to take people 's money and invest it . 
  and when it comes to, 
   banks are there for their benefit, 
  of course they are , but if you did n't benefit anything , why would you give the bank your money in the first place ? 
  the reason they offer those services is so that you would give them your money , so that they could invest it and profit . 
  it would n't work if you got nothing out of the deal , would it ? 
  to be honest something like 80 % of my peers already knew how to code on multiple languages etc. 
  when they started studying comp . 
  sci . 
  i had no clue or hobby background , so especially the first year felt like `` here 's an assigment , complete it and after you turn it in we 'll tell you how to do it . '', 
  to be fair my school does put a lot of effort into these voluntary `` group learning '' sessions where you can work on problems together and get help from some of the older students . 
  but honestly how often are you gon na go when there 's the possibility of just turning it in online ? 
  i understand that situation and i 'm sorry you ( as a country ) let it go that far . 
  what i 'm saying is somewhere else with different competing banks the competition actually got so fierce that banks tried to ** please their customers ** to attract more of them . 
  i know , sounds eerie . 
  one of these services would be negotiating a deal with `` chase '' so that what you mentioned would be possible . 
  it would n't be done out of the goodness of their hearts , but because having a service like this will attract customers to your bank .
