  the bank will probably have to pay the `` competitor '' as a part of the deal , but they 've deemed that fee is worth it to attract customers . 
  well that 's not really so mind blowing , though one office does sound more progressive than most banks . 
  more mind blowing is the fact that you have extra cash you 're trying to deposit . 
  i do n't think i 've deposited cash ** to ** a bank account in a decade , nor have i been in a bank office . 
  i sometimes withdraw money from an atm to buy drugs but other than that i spend everything `` digitally '' . 
  and all of my income be it salary , betting winnings or welfare are deposited directly to my bank account , so a situation where i have extra cash probably only happen if i accidentally pressed the wrong button on an atm . 
  except 9/11 actually was an inside job, 
  largely because they are the same people . 
  there are people who do n't have passports ? 
  oversensitivity is an american stereotype , not canadian . 
  \\  internet, 
  \\  sensitivity, 
  would n't that be one of the greatest countries and a shithole money laundering machine ? 
  well of course there are homeless people etc. 
  but this guy obviously has access to the internet and time to waste on reddit . 
  i never knew people did n't get their passports , i got my first one when i was 1 or 2 ( too young to remember ) and ever since then i 've been renewing it when the old one expired . 
  it 's not like i talk about passports a lot with my friends but this seems to be the common practice . 
  why would someone not own a passport ? 
   getting and maintaining a passport can be an expensive hassle, 
  is n't it like $ 50 bucks every five years ? 
  you go to an office , they take your pic , you leave a form with the pic . 
  15 minutes in and out and pick it up a week or two later . 
  does n't sound that expensive of a `` hassle '' . 
  \\  not knowing how to le meme arrow on reddit, 
  you 're not willing to take a 6 hour drive every 5 years ? 
  how can you even call yourself free if you ca n't leave the country ? 
  i ca n't imagine what it 's like not owning your own passport . 
  to me that sounds a lot like living in [ serfdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom ) . 
  well to be honest i ca n't really even pretend to be surprised anymore by the strange ways some americans seem to have . 
   what would they need it for ? 
  what would it hurt to have one ? 
  why would you not own the document that allows you to leave the country ? 
  how can you call yourself free without having that document to yourself ? 
  besides , what if something surprising happens ? 
  you or someone close to you gets into trouble . 
  or you meet a friend of a friend who has a ski cabin or something and invites you to go , all expenses paid . 
  `` no i ca n't i do n't own my own passport '' . 
  why would you ever want to be in that situation ? 
  even if it is unlikely that you 'll need to have it on a short notice , it never hurts to have the option . 
  to me it 's just common sense a person has his own passport . 
  hell , i could travel to 28 countries without my passport , yet i would never even think about letting mine expire . 
  it 's the most important official document you have , why would you not invest few hours of your time every 5 or so years to have it available ? 
  so $ 80 for 5 years . 
  that 's $ 0.0438 dollars or 4.4 cents per day . 
  to have the possibility to leave the country any time you want in case you need to . 
  you can spend $ 5 on a coffee or a pint but ca n't be bothered to spend 4c a day on the most important document you could own just in case you need it ? 
  even if you do n't end up using it that does n't sound like a waste of money to me . 
  that sounds like playing it safe . 
  so why bother even having the possibility ? 
  your logic baffles me . 
  that 's like not having a driver 's license because you 're not planning on buying a car . 
  if you just told your name nobody would care . 
  there are probably thousands of people with the same first name so it would have absolutely zero to do with `` privacy '' too . 
  instead you made this a game for them . 
  you really do n't understand how people respond to being teased , do you ? 
  if you sold your car would you throw your lisence in the trash ? 
  no , because at some point in the future you might still need it . 
  same with passport , never hurts to have one . 
  in fact i consider it one of the foundations of freedom . 
  if you are n't even allowed to leave the country , how can you call yourself free ? 
  that 's how people in north korea live . 
  or the former soviet union . 
   nobody would care . 
   i would . 
  yea but you already remember your name , so that does n't make any difference . 
  see if you 'd just said your name and the story people would 've maybe upvoted and moved on to the next , forgetting you in 3 seconds . 
  now you 're making it like a treasure hunt . 
  even i 'm inclined to try and look through your comments to see if i get anywhere , and i do n't even creep for a hobby . 
  there are plenty of people on this site who do . 
  you 're making this extremely tempting for them . 
   traveling outside of america ( not counting a cruise , canada or mexico ), 
  this entire discussion was started by a comment about how you need a passport to go to canada these days, 
  because life does n't always follow your plan , and it never hurts to have your options open . 
  there is literally no downside to having a passport . 
  people have credit cards even if they 're not planning on spending more than they can afford . 
  it would just be very inconvenient if you happened to need one and not have it . 
  let 's say all global catastrophes or surprising work offers/business trips or dying relatives you did n't know about or the russian mob or whatever most bizarre reason included your chance of traveling overseas in the next five years would be 0,15 %, 
  if you do n't have a passport , you 're fine in 99,85 % of the possible outcomes . 
  if you do have a passport , you 're fine in 100 % of the possible outcomes . 
  i ca n't understand the logic one must teach himself to come to the conclusion that not having a passport beats having one in any possible situation . 
  yeah because it 's impossible to come up with a scenario in which you 'd need to leave the country in less than 6 weeks . 
  seriously , what planet are you living on ? 
  so you would get a passport ** after ** you get a reason to leave the country ? 
  someone else said it takes 6 weeks to renew a passport in the u.s. . what if you needed or wanted to get abroad in less than 1.5 months ? 
  what if something happened and you suddenly wanted to go there tomorrow ? 
  you 'd start filing paperwork and wait a month ? 
  that 's such a backwards way of looking at things , like buying a cpr for dummies book when you 're already choking . 
  i 'm honestly shocked by this entire comment thread . 
  i always considered having a valid passport to be one of the if not the most important thing a person makes sure is in order . 
  i 'd rather not pay my electric bill or file my tax report than forget about renewing my passport in time . 
  no , but what if you did ? 
  what if you witnessed someone else commit a murder ? 
  what if someone threatened you ? 
  what if you won a raffle for a free vacation ? 
  what if your new rich friend invites you to his summer house in spain all expenses paid ? 
  what if it 's christmas vacation and your friends all get an idea to go see a concert in canada ? 
  what if you save up some money and get a long weekend off from work with vouchers to a mexican spa ? 
  what if you were invited to the world championships of * your hobby * in czech republic in 3 weeks . 
  what if your talented cousin was invited and he offered to take you with her ? 
  what if anything surprising that you did n't plan for happened ?
