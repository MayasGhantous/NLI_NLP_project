  `` no , i do n't have a passport '' . 
  a grown man that does n't have a valid passport . 
  for what ? 
  because he 's too lazy to fill out some form ? 
  i 'd maybe understand if there was a downside to having a passport but there is n't . 
  it 's the most important of all legal documents , and you 're too busy to renew it every 5 years ? 
  then you would lose nothing by being prepared in case it did, 
  it 's because he 's famous , and people who lead boring miserable lives feel better about themselves by criticizing celebrities . 
  he 's not exposing himself to a minor . 
  he rented the place out , hung out on stage in his comfortable clothes . 
  maybe some dick came out , maybe it did n't . 
  it 's not his fault if you wan na stare into his crotch while he 's relaxing . 
  i have n't played fifa online since 12 . 
  you ca n't see the team your opponent is choosing before you accept the match ? 
  how is getting two points a punishment ? 
  the winning team is not losing one point . 
  it 's getting a point for the tie after regulation and a point for winning the ot . 
  it 's not getting punished . 
  at least hockey shootouts are better than penalty shootouts in soccer . 
  that shit is like flipping a coin . 
  oh no a game breaking bug . 
  well that seems like a valid reason to me, 
   all my family is in the states ( and not one has traveled outside us jurisdiction for my lifespan ), 
  wow that is so sad, 
  well the clothes are there to be purchased and possibly tried on before that . 
  i 'm sorry if piling clothes is your hobby but as long as it takes place inside a ** clothes store ** i really do n't give a fuck if i mess up your pile . 
  i know . 
  that 's even worse . 
  but what can you expect from a sport that does n't even have playoffs at the end of the season ? 
  i would n't see it because people would n't take a pic of it and upvote it to the front page of my reddit, 
   piling clothes is n't our hobby , it 's our fucking job . 
  exactly why i do n't feel bad making you do it again . 
  besides , is n't it a sign the pile was well stacked if i picked an item from it ? 
  is n't that like a compliment ? 
  also , i tend not to worry what the lower class thinks of me . 
  so when you go to the supermarket do you pick the jar of peanut butter that 's right in front of you on the shelf , or ask for an assistant in case there are more in the back ? 
  besides people in the clothes store are paid to rearrange those piles . 
  it 's not like they do anything else than use the register and arrange clothes . 
  what 's so bad about people doing what they signed a contract to do ? 
  the attitude in this thread is that those piles are to entertain the staff , not attract customers . 
  guess which one the store owner sides with . 
  that 's just as sad . 
  and when you eventually get the courage to leave your country you go to ... another country that 's almost identical and speaks the same language ? 
  you truly must be fun at parties . 
  if you did n't want a shitty job with asshole customers maybe you should n't work in retail . 
  if i were op i 'd stop working as a waitress, 
   you should care that he is only doing that because it is in his interests and he is protecting a strategic ally from someone who is a political opponent, 
  so you 're saying he 's doing exactly what every politician does all of the time ? 
   russia has a lovely history and a fairly lovely present too . 
  to be fair every current or former `` superpower '' has a pretty gloomy past . 
  while you 're right i hate the mindset of `` well what he says makes sense , but he 's said a stupid stuff about other completely unrelated subjects in the past , so let 's ignore him '' . 
  i despise putin . 
  i live in one of the few countries in the world that hates russia more than america does . 
  i still agree with what he 's saying here . 
  i ordered a new sim from saunalahti about 6 months ago . 
  it worked straight away . 
  there was a code in the envelope i had to put in before it activated itself though , did you get one ? 
  took me less than a minute after i entered the code . 
  i did n't switch providers though , just sim cards . 
  i know there used to be some issues with the former provider being able to slow down the process , kinda like how transfering from one bank to another takes longer than within the bank , even though it 's all electronic . 
  how is it `` shiiiiit '' ? 
  it took me about 2-3 minutes to do and i got it in the mail a day later . 
  how 's that shiiiiit ? 
  ok . hopefully you get it sorted out . 
  overall saunalahti is by far the best provider in finland . 
  in the 6 or so years i 've never had to go anywhere physically or even make a single call . 
  everything is doable online and actually i simply have n't had any issues . 
  i used to have sonera before that and none of those things i mentioned applied . 
  i use a modified [ darkgrid ] ( http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=257590 ) . 
  basically my groups are : 1,2,3,4,5 , r , t , g , v , b, 
  camera hotkey : f1-f5, 
  lift/land is the  < key on my keyboard , it 's the one between z and shift . 
  everything else i 've managed to cram into qweasdzxc . 
  1 is scout , 2 is entire army , 3 , 4 and 5 depend on the state of game and composition ( drops , ghosts , tanks , flanks ) . 
  v is cc/ebay/armory, 
  f is factory, 
  t is starport, 
  r is a free key when i need a temporary hotkey for something unplanned . 
  that sounds like a pretty awesome place to wake up if you 're baked, 
   kid 'll end up being a programmer or something, 
  why ? 
  i study computer science , starcraft is one of the main reasons i ** do n't ** learn to be a programmer and make sick bank . 
  yeah ... no . 
  i simply use `` hey i have n't jerked off all day '' . 
  works for me . 
   i 'm not good with titles . 
  how about `` this is a proud day for me . '', 
  that could work . 
  ** that 's ** the design flaw ? 
  i was staring at the picture trying to figure out the problem . 
  black ops 1 had this as well , probably mw3 as well . 
  the only down side is you can only upload clips of 30 seconds or so . 
  still better than nothing . 
  on pc . 
  not that easy on consoles with the hdmi protection etc. 
  a flashed xbox360 is great . 
  you get almost every game a week or so earlier and unlike jtag you can still go online and get the latest updates . 
  it 's the best of both worlds . 
  better not to go online while playing an unreleased game though . 
  i played through gta iv before it even hit the stores , then bought it when it did .
