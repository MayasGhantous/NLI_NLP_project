  14,5 megabyte gifs suck ass from any host if you 're on ( non-4g ) mobile . 
  i paid 140 $ and even at that price it 's the best game for it 's price . 
  ok maybe counter-strike wins with me buying hl for like 10 $ ( actually was n't even euro yet ) and playing cs for over a decade but it 's a close call . 
  have you ever played a gta game ? 
  the cars have never respawned at a garage unless you leave them in the garage . 
  the impound is a great addition . 
  and it 's $ 150 or something meaning practically free . 
  i think you 've played too much saints row and get the two mixed up in your head . 
  in all previous gta games if you left a nice car on the side of the road to do a mission or any other reason it 'd disappear completely . 
  how is being able to pick it up from the impound worse ? 
  http://500px.com/mavrin requires login unless you want to click `` yes i 'm 18 '' with every picture separately but it 's free, 
  which mission was that ? 
  i 'm just completed the second to last mission so it should n't be a spoiler . 
   i feel really guilty about blocking ads, 
  what ? 
  that 's actually a thing ? 
  people feel guilty for blocking ads ? 
  wow , the brainwashing has really worked on you . 
  oh yeah that makes sense, 
  i just bought a 320gb ** unused ** xbox hdd for 45 $, 
  the drive inside is actually of higher quality than the ones microsoft uses even though it 's not an `` official product '' . 
   you can add music from any computer . 
  you can do this with the default ios as well if you 're tech savvy enough to uncheck one ( 1 ) box in the settings . 
  the snapmatic has actually worked flawless for the past few days . 
  you should try taking a pic with that and viewing it on your pc . 
  no more taking pictures of the screen . 
  yeah it was the collector 's . 
  yes you can . 
  at least you can walk into a garage with your phone open . 
  that 's how i took [ these ] ( http://prod.cloud.rockstargames.com/ugc/gta5photo/0157/b8szsur5gewyrurq9h2gkw/0_0.jpg ) [ pictures ] ( http://prod.cloud.rockstargames.com/ugc/gta5photo/1042/q6nndzqrqu2x9kagszrjsq/0_0.jpg ) . 
  i 've used ipods since 2004 and it 's always been an option . 
  if you do n't uncheck `` manage ipod manually '' it 'll force you to sync it with one machine . 
  uncheck it and you can just drag and drop from any computer you want . 
  i have tons of music on my ipod i do n't have on my computer . 
  oh yeah it definitely requires you to be connected to rockstar `` social club '' . 
  oh yeah that might be true . 
  i did n't realize where op 's pic was taken . 
  those cars are really amazing btw . 
  and so quiet :3, 
  yeah it 's not a worse case scenario , but it 's still bullshit . 
  pay 2 win does n't mean if you pay a cent you 'll automatically win everything . 
  pay 2 win means putting real money into the game helps you win . 
  having additional in-game money helps you win . 
  having in-game colorful hats for example would n't help you win . 
  so if you have a legitimate business you ca n't be greedy ? 
  i really do n't understand that logic . 
  of course you can be doing good business and be greedy at the same time . 
  i only had that happen the first 2-3 days after launch . 
  most youtube channels ( at least anyone semi-pro ) have links where you can donate via paypal or other methods that give 0c to youtube and wo n't force you to view ads . 
  i 've donated money to web comics or video content creators etc. 
  but i 'd never whitelist a youtube page . 
  itunes or any of the following : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_ipod_managers, 
  if you ca n't find 1 out of 15 that you 're okay using then yeah , i guess the ios is n't for you . 
  it 's greedy if it effects others detrimentally . 
  that 's not the definition of greed . 
  besides it 's already upsetting people . 
  yeah or any european country aside from the uk . 
  we can have dicks and boobs on national television and nobody bats an eye . 
  you can find more even in the related videos of that link, 
  no they are n't . 
  i completed the missions in 50 hours and half of that was free roam fucking around . 
  \\  buying weed without a scale, 
  i never understood why people think a file manager is the best way to handle music on a portable player . 
  i understand why people would want the support for it , just not why anyone would use it . 
  what about playlists ? 
  smart playlists ? 
  all that crap aside from moving file a to drive b. 
  you must 've failed the missions a lot because rockstar social club clocks me at 54 hours 27 minutes and i went out of my way to avoid missions . 
  some days i 've played 8-12 hours and only completed one mission because i wanted to space them out . 
  it was n't in 1998, 
  yes, 
  how would that be more effective or less expensive than some clear plastic ? 
  that stuff is pretty cheap . 
   i would say pay 2 win is more like those games where the best loot is only available to people who pay . 
  no that would be called a game nobody plays . 
  pay 2 win is giving you an advantage , not necessarily making you undefeatable . 
  you can still pay money and lose in p2w models . 
  it 's just makes it easier to win . 
  i do n't really understand what it is that `` makes sense '' about me3 costing the equivalent of minimum wage . 
  i get the math but i do n't understand what you 're trying to solve . 
  being able to calculate a price per hour does n't make p2w any more `` reasonable '' . 
  i think you 're just seeing two unrelated numbers that happen to be close to each other and somehow figure out there 's a `` connection '' where there is n't one . 
  you need to be signed up to the social club . 
  even then it wo n't always show up depending which barber you go to . 
  of course it 's technically possible but that does n't mean it should be done . 
  not all game dev decisions are about whether or not something is possible . 
  the garages in gta series have always been a place to ** store ** cars , not respawn cars endlessly . 
  it would n't have been impossible to respawn cars in gta 3 with the technology of the time . 
  they did n't do it . 
  it would n't have been impossible in gta 4 , yet they did n't do it . 
  it 's not impossible in 5 , but they still do n't do it . 
  see the pattern ? 
  just because something is possible does n't mean it 'd make it a better game . 
  personally i like how the garages do n't respawn cars . 
  it makes them feel more valuable . 
  and the impound is a great solution for situations where you lose the car due to circumstances out of your control ( start a certain mission for example ) . 
  also you do n't `` own '' cars you steal . 
  you own cars you buy . 
  the cars you buy do respawn . 
  you 're just arguing because you let out a brain fart and now you feel like it 's your duty to defend it .
