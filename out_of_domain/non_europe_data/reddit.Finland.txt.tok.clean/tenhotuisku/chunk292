  no schedules and all the weed you can smoke . 
  i have n't worked 50 hours in the last 3 years combined . 
  i 've smoked every night though so we have that in common . 
   definitely just you, 
   my other roommates sit watching movies smoking hookah, 
  what ? 
  also your problems sound like you 're too stupid to become an engineer , especially if this is your first year when everything 's still extremely basic . 
  i 've never used a pax but does it have a temperature setting ? 
  what you 're describing sounds like someone using a vaporizer at a too high temperature . 
  i 've transcended past the need for material posessions . 
  a.k.a i get enough money from the government for food and internet, 
  i like how high he must 've been to be actually concerned people did n't understand what they were seeing . 
  that looks so shopped, 
  e. [ it 's hard to tell anything because the quality is so terrible but it does seem suspicious ] ( http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=803605e356a79916aabdeef0c39d387813ed4c54.23045 ), 
  download it . 
  or use [ gimp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gimp ) though i 'm not sure how good the gif functions are as i have n't used it in about 6 years . 
  it did have the basic features back then . 
  it 's usually recommended as a free photoshop alternative or if you use linux . 
  so . . b ? 
  basic video game logic dictates as long as the body of water is not too shallow you take zero damage jumping into it . 
  gtav is simply too cool to follow rules . 
  i like it though . 
   allows, 
  bitch i 'm not asking for permission, 
  ctr is better than any of the mario karts . 
  i do n't care about nostalgia or which came first . 
  it executed the genre to perfection . 
  we still play it surprisingly often . 
  it was n't . 
  not like the first three . 
  it was * okay * . 
  i played it for about a 100 hrs and had some fun so i got my money 's worth , but it was n't the masterpiece we had waited for for over a decade . 
  it was n't `` even '' as good as d2 . 
  it is definitely a sequel , but it was n't in the making for 10 years . 
  hl is n't about hl . 
  it 's the mods . 
  hl1 & 2 are good . 
  i do n't think they 're 10.0 masterpieces either but the mods are what make them the most important games in semi recent video game history imo . 
  they did a pretty good effort trying to imitate the originals but that 's all it was . 
  it ran on a different engine made by a different company and you could feel it . 
  also the writing and humour were n't the same . 
  if you were 12 like me it probably did n't stick out that much but looking back and after replaying them a few years ago they have that feel to them that they 're made by a new company that 's been given a succesful franchise . 
  it 's just a bunch of `` hey i 'm crash i do this remember you 've seen me do this before '' . 
  it 's not as witty as the dialog and cutscenes that naughty dog is famous for and what made jak , uncharted etc. 
  the successes they are . 
  along with the original crashes . 
   maybe i 'm just slightly biased because an ex and i used to play ctr all the time, 
  haha me too . 
  i still enjoy ctr though . 
  it had a place in my heart long before her . 
  i played mario kart too . 
  the snes version and the gc one mostly . 
  of course some n64 too but i never owned a n64 . 
  they were both always popular . 
  i still have 10 + friends who will always agree to ctr , most of us have either an old ps1 or a ps2 or the psn version for ps3 . 
  it 's the same game on each which is great . 
  it 's probably also why it stayed so popular , people did n't switch to the new one every 3-5 years . 
  the always was and will be one ctr . 
  yeah well if it took them 7 years to buy the license it 's entirely possible they had the engine and the world already in place whether or not they got the permission for the name . 
  all it takes is some sound acting and inserting the vault boy image into practically everything since the characters are all new anyway . 
  though i 'd argue if they did n't get the license it probably would n't been called either a `` fallout copy '' or `` the spiritual successor '' anyway so i think it 's fair to call it a `` real '' fallout . 
  it 's emmental . 
  i recommend you buy some fancy [ sold in blocks or from a wheel emmental cheese ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/emmental_015.jpg ) and not the cheap [ `` emmental '' cheese ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--ujhktd6f5e/us0asi936ki/aaaaaaaatxu/nlzkvqixcoe/s1600/sam_0183.jpg ) you find almost anywhere at least where i live . 
  of course this applies to any cheese or pretty much any ingredient of any food but especially emmental tastes like nothing if you buy the `` massproduced '' made in a factory on a conveyer belt kind . 
  the ones from switzerland ( obviously ) or netherlands , france etc. 
  other good cheese countries taste excellent . 
  a stick of butter is around 100g or a little more so half a stick should be 50g . 
  but in reality with a recipe like this you should n't be measuring butter with instruments , for best results just have a rough idea and depending on the size of the onions and the bread you use etc. 
  use as much as you as a chef feel is right . 
  you can tell if it gets too dry . 
  for me it was a lego cannon ball . 
  like the ones you see [ here ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/nzm0wdewmjq=/z/hkqaaoxybqpriaoh/$ ( kgrhqf , ! quff60bgnbgbri!ohi26w ~ ~ 60_35 . jpg?set _ id = 880000500f ) . 
  i definitely remember the kettle sound , only my nose was n't running ketchup but blood because i paniced and tried to dig it out :(, 
  that game was great and free which was n't common those days for such a high production value . 
  only i always wanted the ak47 ... 
  why would you play with the auto aim ? 
  that 's like hiring someone else to play as you watch . 
  sounds like you 're using the assisted aim . 
  of course it 's easy as fuck to get headshots that way . 
  it takes all the challenge out of the game and especially the special requirements . 
  it 's like saying spawning a jet with a cheat code is much easier than stealing one from the military base . 
  might as well watch youtube playthoughs if you do n't enjoy playing yourself . 
  or better yet have someone else complete the game on your profile . 
  that way not only do n't you have to aim you wo n't have to drive either . 
  you can even sleep through the dialog !, 
  settings, 
  only if you use auto-aim ( which is n't on by default ) . 
   but not everyone has played it enough to recognize from a screenshot . 
  this is from the prologue 10 minutes after you start the game . 
  also there 's 5 stars and the ammo in gta font . 
  that and it 's the most hyped and advertised game of the decade . 
  if anyone tried to figure out what game this was it 'd take them less than 5 seconds . 
  you just wanted to whine because you saw an opportunity , am i right ? 
  it certainly was n't on mine ( 360 ) and even if it was on your console why would you keep it ? 
  yeah and if you hired a buddy it 'd be like he 's * assisting * you . 
  only games i 've played for the last 24 months are starcraft and cs : go . 
  does n't mean i ca n't use a controller . 
  i 'd rather not play than ruin the experience with auto aim . 
  i never realized people actually use it , i hope this does n't mean it 'll be in gtao . 
  i know all of my `` crew '' use manual but i 'm worried about random people now .
