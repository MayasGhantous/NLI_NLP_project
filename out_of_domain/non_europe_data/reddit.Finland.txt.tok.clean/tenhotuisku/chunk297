  i have a bunch of times . 
  usually if i pour gasoline from a jerry can it 'll burn off and the car will extinguish . 
  at least much more often that explode . 
  shooting or crashing a car until it lits on fire is a different thing , then it will always explode . 
  skyrim is a mile wide but an inch deep . 
  it 's casual shit for people who only care about nice scenery and do n't really want an rpg . 
  the character building is boring and there is absolutely no variety to weapons . 
  i 'm not exaggerating or speaking symbolically , there is ** literally ** ( and this time it means literally ) zero variety to weapons . 
  they are in a completely straight line . 
  you never have to think `` which one is better suited for me '' or anything like that as there are no trade-offs . 
  each new `` version '' of the weapon will always be better in every aspect . 
  same way as the wood tools vs. iron tools vs diamond tools in minecraft . 
  it 's ridiculous and a disgrace that the game got all the publicity it did . 
  i actually got it only 2 or 3 days after buying the game . 
  i was surprised myself . 
  it was an infernus , a tuned one but not fully tuned as i had n't unlocked everything yet . 
  how the fuck does that reek of pc elitism ? 
  if anything would n't admitting that be the complete opposite ? 
  would n't pc elitism be saying it 's hopeless trying to do anything with such old hardware ? 
  not praising the developers for constantly pushing the limits on 10 year old hardware ? 
  besides the trick to gtav is n't using the hdd . 
  every game since the release has been possible to install to hdd . 
  it 's the semi new trick of reading the game from both the disc and the hdd simultaneously allowing for almost double the read speeds . 
  yeah that would 've been really cool 10 years ago . 
  now i get those speeds for 14,90 $ a month so hardly worth bragging . 
  why would you use snapchat for something like this ? 
  is n't the point of snapchat to send stuff you do n't want saved ( which of course goes against all logic ) . 
  why would someone want to be sure this picture of a bird is deleted in 15 seconds ? 
  is n't that old ? 
  the release 360 's were manufactured in 2004 . 
  designed in 03 or 02 . 
  that 's ancient when it comes to computers . 
  are you familiar with [ moore 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moore%27s_law ) at all ? 
  yeah but if they only had access to basic channels and it was either mls or nba or nfl it 's quite likely they 'd more likely choose mls than non-immigrants . 
  i do n't think you see premier league or la liga etc. 
  on free channels . 
  yeah but canadian voters are n't included in this graph . 
  i do n't know the exact moment it happened . 
  i was just driving around the island while it was still new to me and afterwards noticed that stat . 
  in all likelihood it was the freeway . 
  before that my top speed was 234 in a cheetah , that was in the freeway on the west side . 
  but there are tons of apps for this without the automatic deletion gimmick . 
  for example i 'd use whatsapp , everyone with a smartphone has it anyway . 
  and no hassle with the deletion . 
  besides i like having a backlog of everything from stupid drunken ideas to breakfast pictures and even some massive shits . 
  but i do n't see the point of using an app that ** makes sure ** it gets deleted unless it 's something sensitive . 
  if it 's just mundane why not send a pic and let them worry whether or not to save it ? 
  i really do n't see the appeal of snapchat to anyone else than people who want to send nudes and ( mistakenly ) think the app makes it `` safe '' . 
  i agree . 
  it does n't need to be like a latte , just a little drop to take the edge off . 
  90 % coffee 10 % milk tastes like an entirely different drink . 
  as for sugar i do n't think it 's a taste that goes well with the other ingredients . 
  it just makes the coffee worse . 
  but if it 's point is to induce vomiting does it matter how much salt there is ? 
  you 're the first person i 've met who thinks the point of not using as much sugar is to save money . 
  but everyone goes on a vacation sooner or later so it 's only a matter of time . 
  and nobody thinks it 's suspicious to postpone one . 
  just a bit sad . 
  i would n't say trolled . 
  more like befriended . 
  overused jokes ? 
  on reddit ? 
  in / r/4chan ? 
  surely you must be kidding . 
  next you 'll tell me these stories did n't actually take place . 
  omg a fake story !, 
  i do n't find this disturbing at all . 
  because the baby is dead before he started fucking around with it . 
  it probably got proper medical care for long as there was a chance of saving it . 
  personally ( alive ) child abuse is the only thing that gets me . 
  how is harming a living being ** less ** bad than fucking around with a dead body that probably got all the proper care it could receive to save it while there still was a chance ? 
  would n't throwing an alive baby against the wall be much worse than a dead baby ? 
  the only gif that has made my website host temporarily shut it down and contact me to delete it . 
  luckily they were nice enough to bring the site back up after i did . 
  you mean the post that ended with the guy from the morgue arriving to pick up the baby ( presumably from a hospital ) ? 
  i 'm not bent out of shape about this , i just ca n't understand why people would choose this app that 's obviously all about the gimmick of automatically deleting photos when there are tons of other apps for sending photos or videos etc. 
  to a group of people without the automatic deletion . 
  is it just that it 's already popular wherever you live and therefore people use it for things it was n't specifically designed for nor the best available choice ? 
  because that i could understand . 
  that 's not the same as `` it can snow in sa '' . 
  7am et ? 
  that means i have to go to bed before gtao fun time begins :(, 
  i 'm guessing it has more to do with when microsoft/sony roll out new content/title updates , it 'd also make sense in this context . 
  i would n't be surprised to see this come live in europe before the u.s. 
  from the sounds of it rockstar does n't have complete control ( nor do they care ) about the exact moment the update goes live . 
  i 'm not saying the 2 week wait etc. 
  is n't rockstar 's idea to ease the first day load , but i 'd still guess the 7am timing is because of the time console manufacturers add new updates etc. 
  and not rockstar 's decision . 
  what you said about it being the lowest population time makes sense in both contexts . 
  that 's what i 've always done . 
  i did n't say i could n't get cars to explode , just that pouring gas on them does n't always guarantee they do . 
  these are n't new pics . 
  they do in finland too , it 's just not in the law so people would n't get the idea that `` a little bit of speeding is ok '' . 
  gta v is better . 
  that was pretty clear after the trip to north yankton , was n't it ? 
  yeah that 's how i see it as well . 
  gtav 's plot is n't about `` good vs evil '' or fighting some bad guys . 
  it 's about a bunch of thieves who want to do the `` big one '' and pull it off . 
  if anything the union depository security guards or the lspd were the antagonists . 
  just because those guys were killed last did n't make them the `` boss fight '' .
