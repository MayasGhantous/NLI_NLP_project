  he 's not an antagonist and he 's not a `` villain '' . 
  he 's an asshole you have to deal with while trying to earn money by stealing . 
  besides what the fuck are you doing here if you have n't completed the game ? 
  the game is n't about fighting some evil mastermind bond villain . 
  it 's about pulling off heists . 
  the grand accomplishment or the climax is n't that last mission , it 's the one before that . 
  if you go hang out with the other characters after you 've completed the story they all congratulate each other on the big one , not tying up some loose ends . 
  killing those people was just taking care of business . 
  it says you can view it on the social club , but i have n't actually looked for it so i 'm not 100 %, 
  what about if you replay the mission ? 
  does the game consider the first playthrough the only one that 's `` canon '' or do you still lose those characters ? 
  well he is definitely an enemy of michael , but you 're playing a lying thief and a murderer yourself . 
  villains are typically seen as `` evil '' so that killing them is justified in itself . 
  in gtav it 's more like you 're killing competition . 
  tying up loose ends . 
  and that 's exactly what the characters called it . 
  it 's not a story about how 3 guys together managed to beat the evil drug lord despite the odds etc. 
  it 's about three guys who want to steal gold and after managing to do that they kill anyone who knows about it or can otherwise cause them harm . 
  i consider the depository heist to be the climax , not the final mission . 
  they can change to random outfits you buy/use as well , not just the default outfit . 
  i do n't really mind , they keep the clothes you put on them for multiple days anyway . 
  it does n't really bother me that they change clothes after almost a week unless you play them . 
  it 's not like they change instantly after you select another character . 
  you realize street races are only available between 10pm and 5am or so ? 
  yes and no . 
  gta is a rockstar north ( based in uk ) franchise but if you look at the wikipedia page for example :, 
  developer ( s ) rockstar north, 
  additional work by :, 
  rockstar nyc, 
  rockstar toronto, 
  rockstar new england, 
  rockstar london, 
  rockstar lincoln, 
  publisher ( s ) rockstar games, 
  it 's really made by the entirety of rockstar , which has it 's hq in new york . 
  you realize you can just create one yourself ? 
  i like the idea of a european crew as well . 
  it sucks to play with the latency to america and reddit is even less known among kids over here so it would effectively filter out all the 12 year olds you get when you play with randoms . 
  it 's 6 hours until it 's supposed to go live . 
  i do hope it happens before that in europe though , usually they do n't roll out new updates during the afternoon . 
  / r/circlejerk, 
  it 's kinda hard to find crews here on reddit that are n't all full of american players . 
  i filled the application on your site . 
  that 's what i was supposed to do , right ? 
  e. i now have a fully tuned comet with 4 engine , 4 transmission , 4 brakes , turbo , bulletproof tires etc. 
  which is a nice asset while doing missions . 
  i 'd love to have more people to do co-op with . 
  was it the mission where you have to steal the drill ? 
  in the story mode the owned car is determined by the story line , they will always be the same . 
  in gtao you can choose ( buy ) your owned car . 
  if you 'd like to `` save '' a different car in story mode just park it in any garage and it wo n't ( should n't ) disappear . 
  it wo n't respawn every time you go there though , this is not saints row . 
  if you take the car out of the garage you risk losing it . 
  however they did add the impound feature with gta5 so not all hope is lost if you manage to lose or have to leave your precious car on the side of the road . 
  if you 've customized it or ever parked it in any garage it 'll go to the impound once you abandon it . 
  keep in mind the impound only saves the 2 most recent cars so check it often . 
  if it meant so much to you why did you give it away ? 
  also you can buy it for $ 1 on ebay : http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&amp;_from=r40&amp;_nkw=gta+blimp&amp;_sop=15, 
  it 's a spoiler but here you go if you want to know :, 
  [ once you complete the game 100 % there will be a strangers and freaks mission that is a bigfoot . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's just some guy in a big foot costume as i have n't completed it myself and backed out of the thread as soon as i realized it was spoilers . 
  i did see some convincing photos before that though and a strangers mission that resembles what was described is listed on social club . 
  working just fine for me at the moment but i have had similiar issues like you described during the last 2 weeks so in all likelihood nothing to worry about . 
  you do n't have to buy * everything * . 
  just one of each . 
  meaning you buy ** a spoiler ** , not all 3 options for a spoiler . 
  did you remember custom tires ? 
  or pearlescent coating over the main paintjob ? 
  the video output has absolutely ** nothing ** to do with the actual game code or processes . 
  what you 're suggesting is like saying your ipod shuffle plays better music when you connect it to a speaker . 
  did i play skyrim ? 
  about a hundred hours . 
  i kept giving it a second and a third chance because i wanted so badly for it to not be shit . 
  after 100 hours i just gave up on trying make it seem fun or well designed . 
  that paragraph is just one in a looong list of complaints . 
  and they 're not minor things i did n't particularly like . 
  most of them could be considered game breaking . 
  if it was n't for the millions in marketing and hype that game would 've never scored more than 6/10 on most reviews . 
  once you buy a metallic color a new option for pearlescent shows up . 
  also depending on the car model there are different options , some cars wo n't let you change the windows or the bumpers for example . 
  maybe franklin 's car just does n't have enough modifiable things to qualify ? 
  i really do n't know , i got mine customizing some sports car . 
  those are different categories . 
  what i mean was within the categories they are literally the same weapon in different colours . 
  there is 1 axe in the game , 1 one-handed sword , one two handed sword , 1 bow etc. 
  and because of how the point allocation works you have to choose one category that you 'll be playing with for the rest of the game . 
  so if you choose to put your points into battleaxe skills for example then you 'll have to play with different coloured identical battle axes the entire game . 
  you 'll never have a choice of `` which of these axes would be best for my playstyle/my build/this mission/that enemy '' etc. 
  the progression is purely linear . 
  oblivion and morrowind were both much better games than skyrim . 
  not just `` in their time '' but even if played now . 
  just because it is n't paid hype does n't make the hype any better justification give a game exaggerated scores . 
  i like how the text messages have typos in this game . 
  normally it 'd consider typos in a game lack of attention to detail , in gta it seems like extra attention to details . 
  much better quests . 
  basically every single quest in skyrim was '' [ some backstory that does n't make any difference to the mission ] . 
  go to a cave and fight draugr for an item to bring back . '', 
  every single time . 
  the npcs kept telling exciting stories and describing all kinds of interesting things yet the end result was always you fighting draugr in a cave . 
  maybe if you got lucky there 'd be some necromancers in the cave as well .
