  it 's not `` throttled '' . 
  you can get tons of money by racing and doing the missions . 
  i do n't get the attitude here , it 's like people want the game to have no difficulty and everything unlocked as soon as they get in the game and the game over as soon as possible . 
  i simply ca n't understand that . 
  i 'm enjoying playing so of course i want it to last as long as possible . 
  you 've never shot people with a fighter jet in gta ? 
  that 's what it feels like to be on the other end of the missile . 
  if you do n't want other players in your game , play single player . 
  what you 're complaining about is what an online gta is all about . 
  except the spawn camping , but that 's why they implemented the passive mode . 
  i do agree the spawns could be further away but at least to me it feels like a tiny detail , not `` complete bullshit '' or `` holding back '' anything . 
  after completing the campaign definitely , but until the last heist i was pretty much broke the entire time in single player . 
  besides i do n't get why `` easy '' is regarded the same as `` good '' in this thread . 
  i love the fact that money actually has value and you do n't drop $ 200k into any car you pick up on the street and let explode 10 minutes later . 
  i like having to make decisions and actually feeling like i 've worked for stuff when i finally get it . 
  i have n't grinded and i 've already made $ 1m . 
  you can get a lot of money by racing and simply doing different missions like advancing in a story . 
  most i 've done is one mission three times and that was simply because i was doing it with different friends . 
  i do n't understand why people here complain that money finally has some value . 
  is n't that a good thing ? 
  i love how now it feels like money actually is worth something . 
  it makes buying stuff feel so much more rewarding when you ca n't just empty every store you walk into or customize every car to the max and then abandon it 5 minutes later . 
  i do n't think this is a bad thing . 
  i do n't get the attitude that you should n't be able to fail . 
  i like how it 's possible to play and lose money if you play too badly , especially in a multiplayer game . 
  not everything should be constantly rewarding you despite how well you play . 
  that 's what makes managing to earn money feel good . 
  are you one of those people who think participation awards for everyone are better than prizes for winners ? 
  yeah i do n't understand people here complaining how their ** gta online ** has other players killing them or stealing their money . 
  is n't that what and online gta is about ? 
  it seems the general attitude here is you should n't be able to a. kill other players b. be able to lose money because everyone 's a winner and participation is all that matters c. have any items that you ca n't buy after 1 hour of gameplay . 
  i feel like these whiners should just go back to single player . 
  there are some proper complaints like the spawns in some instances but 98 % of these posts are complaining about what gtao is ** supposed to be ** . 
  finally some sense in this thread . 
  everyone here is complaining how hard it is to make money when that 's exactly what i love about this game . 
  now i actually have to think if i need a silencer for a certain gun or a new jacket instead of just mashing a and down to buy every single item . 
  it also makes my tuned out comet feel so much better when it really is rare to see fully customized cars . 
  i also like the fact that you can play and lose money if you constantly die and ca n't get any jobs or other sources of income done . 
  i do n't agree with the idea that every time you play you should progress regardless of what you do . 
  failing should be possible in video games , that 's what makes success feel good . 
  it 's not like it 's hard to earn money , i 've earned $ 1m already and $ 120k of that has gone into hospital bills and i feel like i 've died ** a lot ** . 
  that 's not too big of a cut in my opinion . 
  i 've never seen levels that scale up as little as in gtao . 
  i 'm level 38 right now and i think to get 39 i need about as much as i needed to go from 1 to 3 . 
  you ca n't even feel the `` curve '' , i have n't written them down but my estimate is that the xp needed per level goes up much less than 10 % per level . 
  maybe 5 % . 
  in some games like cod you can get the first 5-10 levels in ** one match ** and then nearing the end it might take you nearly ten hours for one level . 
  while in bf you never get 5 levels per game you can sometimes grind single levels for dozens of hours when you 're a higher rank . 
  one level can easily be as much xp as the first 20 or 30 levels were combined . 
  here it 's nothing like that ( and i 'm not sure i like it ) . 
  when i played with a friend who was level 5 we leveled up almost at the same intervals when doing co-op missions . 
  e. i checked , to get from 38 to 39 you need 9866 rp . 
  if i remember correctly 1 -  2 was 4000 rp . 
  that gives you some idea how little it ramps up . 
  if it makes you feel any better i only have $ 3,615 cash + bank right now . 
  i 've put $ 505,267 into my comet ( $ 100,000 + 400k in mods ) :p, 
  but i do n't want to `` force myself '' to do social shit i do n't enjoy on my free time . 
  i already dedicate a bunch time of my life to school work . 
  i 'm not going to take what little i have left and put it into something i enjoy even less than studying . 
  but he wo n't be the only one competent . 
  if two people are as qualified but one also gets along with people and has connections he definitely has an advantage . 
  but he wo n't be the only one with skills . 
  someone else with the same degree but with a more `` people person '' could `` prove their skills '' just as well and they would n't have the downside of being antisocial . 
  i 'm not saying this to be an asshole , i 'm saying this because i 'm also one of those people who do n't really care about socializing in school . 
  i already have more than enough friends from before university and i do n't feel like `` befriending '' people simply because i know it can be beneficial to me in the long run . 
  it just feels wrong and awkward , even though i know it 's what everyone does and it would help me . 
  what if his school is n't `` respected '' ? 
  it 's just average ? 
   but after many days i still ca n't even buy the cheapest garage and i 'm disappointed by that . 
  that is simply bullshit . 
  the cheapest garage is $ 25k . 
  you can make 25k in two races . 
  that 's about 8 minutes . 
  if you are n't that good of a driver it takes like 5-6 races but that still takes about half an hour . 
  you can do them consecutively without leaving the lobby and that way there is zero risk of losing the money by dying or other ways . 
  bugs suck . 
  i have n't encountered any myself but understand if they get people frustrated . 
  however you ca n't blame the game mechanics for something that 's clearly a temporary bug . 
   money can still be easier to obtain than it currently is and be valuable . 
  not really . 
  it 's already on that fine line . 
  it 's 5 days after launch and i have a fully tuned sports car and all the guns i could want with every attachment . 
  i admit i 've played a lot but for me the rewards feel totally in line with the effort . 
  but should games be designed so that everyone gets to see everything no matter how much time they put into the game ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  just because you do n't have time or patience to play a video game does n't mean it should be designed so that anyone can complete it within a week . 
  the game 's not going anywhere . 
  even if you can only get in 2 hours a week at max you could still keep playing it for years if you truly want to see every little thing . 
  i personally love the game , and would never want to see `` all the way through '' . 
  it 's about the journey , not the destination . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  `` the progress is too slow '' = serious opinion that must be taken seriously and is also automatically the right opinion . 
  `` the speed of progress is just fine '' = smug disingenuous bullshit that should n't even be taken into consideration because it 's not even seriously . 
  nice . 
  seems like grounds for intelligent debate . 
   too much locking on, 
  you play with autoaim on and then complain about autoaim ? 
  just disable it from the settings , you ca n't play with autoaim against freeaim players . 
  i personally do n't understand why anyone would use autoaim in multiplayer or singleplayer . 
  if i wanted someone else to aim instead of me i 'd watch a movie .
