  i get the same penalty i would if all of it was in a bank . 
  i 've never gotten more than a $ 100 from a corpse neither and i bet i 've killed people richer than that . 
  btw . 
  pro tip : the atms have no purpose now either , use online banking from your phone . 
  i imagine they originally had planned something like this :, 
   someone kills you and takes your recent convenience store robbery money , you can hunt them down and get it back before they deposit it, 
  but it just turned into people camping atm 's in beta . 
  at least that 's my theory . 
  the cap is $ 5k in single player only , it 's $ 2k in online which makes your point even more valid . 
  i think 8 % for 500k is kinda harsh . 
  losing almost $ 50k per death ? 
  what about 1 or 2 % for everyone and no cap ? 
  that way it does n't really hit low level players as hard but 2 % out of 500k is still a considerable amount of money . 
  depends on the team . 
  i had to pay 230 $ for mine a few years back . 
  i do n't mind as the proceeds went to the team but i still would n't call that `` affordable '' . 
  well that 's still better than just a punch , right ? 
  why zombies ? 
  every other game has zombies these days . 
  they 're boring as fuck by this point . 
  there 's already a game mode ** exactly like ** cod zombies and it 's called survival . 
  why do you need them to be zombies ? 
  i prefer having different kind of enemies for each mission acting differently and yelling different things , not generic zombies everywhere . 
  i think he 's just guessing but it has been confirmed to be found on the game files ( at least references to the name ) so it should come at some point . 
  indeed , if you lost a character after 2 days of playing it should take you 2 days to get it back . 
  i understand it 's kinda frustrating but it 's not the end of the world . 
  especially now that you know it wo n't happen again . 
  it 's not like corrupt save files are a new thing , i 've had issues like this in all sorts of games since the 90s . 
  dayz is the zombie game i 've been waiting for ever since i was a kid . 
  it was really buggy though as it was a mod , i hope the standalone full release will be more stable . 
  your argument of `` racing takes no skill if you 're allowed to touch each other '' is just as bullshit . 
  of course it takes skill to ram other out the road ** and not crash yourself ** . 
  it 's easy to drive the wrong way or just smash into everyone else , but using physical contact to help yourself win the race is just as hard as a `` clean '' race . 
  exactly . 
  every game has problems at launch even if they do n't specifically mention it , and rockstar did . 
  that means these `` game breaking '' bugs are to be expected the first week or so and i do n't think you can really complain when they do . 
  of course feedback is important but i think rockstar already understood it 's an issue . 
  all the flaming is unnecessary . 
  just wait 2 weeks if it 's that big a deal for you . 
  you can pretend that 's when the game was released and it 'll be great . 
  i 've only seen aa in movies but is n't there always that one guy who opens and closes the meetings and leads the discussion & activities etc. 
  kinda like a therapist ? 
  it also made me feel really bad to be a part of this sub if the people who are subscribed/vote here really think this is a valid proposition . 
  yeah and a good pistol . 
  there 's nothing like a desert eagle or a .44 magnum in the game like every other gta has had . 
  i have the ce so i have the deagle but there should be something for everyone . 
  that 's not actually even glitching . 
  it 's a feature working as intended . 
  yeah i agree with you . 
  when i was 18 it was pretty devastating to see kids my age in olympics or the nhl while i was finishing up high school and had no clue what i wanted to do in life . 
  now it just feels obvious like a part of life . 
  of course some of these athletes are younger than me . 
  i just want to see the full url, 
  is anyone really surprised any drug is `` ymmv '' ? 
   a high school student in possession of illegal drugs should be enough to raise the alarm, 
  what ? 
  i bet you did n't know many people in your high school , did you ? 
  i 'd estimate 60-70 % of the people in my high school were in possession of illegal drugs at one point or another . 
  i 've been trying to locate the fuel tank for a long time in both single player and online with no results . 
  i have gotten the occasional surprise explosion while shooting randomly though so i guess it is possible . 
  i 'd love to know where to aim . 
  on boats it 's much easier . 
  why do you people browse / r/wtf if you do n't want to see anything that 's even mildly upsetting ? 
  yeah and how is this `` second language '' specific ? 
  i speak three languages fluently with advanced basics of two more and if i tried to learn a new language i 'd do pretty much this . 
  my personal recommendation for the most effective method : learn the absolute basics from books/wherever you can and move there . 
  find an exchange student programme , work internship , a real job , simply an extended vacation . 
  anything . 
  if you 're an eu citizen you can just show up without letting anyone know and rent an apartment and get a job just like anyone local . 
  if not , then you have to deal with visas but they are n't that hard to get for 6-12 months to most countries . 
  i realize not everyone can do this , but i want to point it out because 6 months of living in a country will be more effective than a decade of studying it from books/classes . 
  if you really want to be fluent in a language `` no matter what '' immersing yourself in it is the absolute best way . 
  also it 's tons of fun . 
  for anyone interested you should be able to find the video by searching for `` 3 guys 1 screwdriver '', 
  i 've had the same thing happen , except after getting back in the car he jumped back out . 
  i did punch him to teach a lesson . 
  came here to say vanquish . 
  it 's absolutely amazing . 
  hands down the best 3rd person shooter for 360 . 
  the plot is absolute crap but it does n't really get in the way , the gameplay is more than enough to make it a 10/10 game . 
  every review i 've seen has praised it as well , so i do n't quite understand why it 's so little known . 
  i 've played through it 3 times and always recommend it to my friends , they 've all loved it as well . 
  i believe i 've loaned it to 4 people so far . 
  yeah but when you 're higher level $ 2k is nothing . 
  even 20k would be nothing to me right now . 
  honestly it should be redone , a smaller percentage and no cap or something like that . 
  puma swede is actually finnish , not swedish http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/2/23/nbc%27s_the_more_you_know.jpg, 
  actually she 's technically finnish though raised in sweden . 
  also probably because of the stereotype of swedish women . 
    if there 's a hockey game , sweden vs finland , i do support finland , 
  i 'd say that 's the decisive fact :p, 
  a flat fee ? 
  that 's retarded . 
  something like $ 5k a few times would be devastating for a low level player but i could lose that ten times and not even notice . 
  a flat fee would be the worst of all options . 
  and like i said , it does n't matter how many atms there is since online banking will always be faster and more convenient . 
  i tried ordering abroad ( i did n't complete the order though ) and it did n't give me any errors . 
  your guess is as good as mine . 
  forever to load ? 
  i agree a video is better but this did n't take any time to load .
