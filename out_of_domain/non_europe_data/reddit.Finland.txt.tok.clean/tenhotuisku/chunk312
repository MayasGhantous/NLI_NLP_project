  i talk about these issues a lot with many people and if they have n't used the word `` depressed '' every one i 've talked to has at least described going through what we call `` dark waters '' or simply `` feeling down '' from time to time . 
  almost always their go-to fix has been to quit weed for a while . 
  2 weeks or a month or whatever . 
  it pretty much always works . 
  i 'm not trying to say smoking every day makes you depressed . 
  it does n't . 
  what i 'm saying is if you 're smoking every day there 's a high chance you will or have been depressed at some point . 
  same thing goes with any intoxicant . 
  doing more drugs rarely solves the problems that have arisen from using drugs . 
  while i agree that marijuana is relatively harmless , it is a psychoactive drug after all . 
  there are n't facts . 
  you wo n't find facts about this issue . 
  this is just personal experience i 'm sharing with op . 
  what ? 
  since when ca n't you be a part of the society ** and ** a drain ? 
  i 'm a drain . 
  i consume more tax money than i pay . 
  most people would say i 'm part of the society as well . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  if i was a dictator i would do it . 
  besides , i still have potential to become a productive member of the society . 
  a person with down 's syndrome does n't . 
  and no , i do n't need to see a motivational video where a retarded person won a bike race or whatever . 
  implying anything in life has intrinsic value , especially human life in a world of 6 billion people . 
  and not even any human , but a subhuman . 
   if this was a pill the doctor gave you , would you still feel guilty ? 
  yes i would actually feel even worse , because instead of simply using a psychoactive intoxicant i would be using a drug that is specifically designed to fool me into thinking i 'm not sad . 
  but i realize not everyone is like me . 
  what if it was the boyfriend who did n't want his face shown on the internet ? 
  what if it was the bf who was a huge fan and a role player or whatever weeabos call themselves and also the one who demanded to be shopped ? 
  everything ? 
  there 's a difference between publicly showing affection and taking a picture of it to share online . 
  publicly showing affection is kissing your so at the mall . 
  perfectly fine . 
  taking a pic for fb or whatever would be like kissing your so at the mall , then announcing it to everyone nearby and sending postcards to each and every one of your friends letting them know that you have in fact kissed your boyfriend . 
  it 's unnecessary and childish . 
  i 'm not talking about a pic from an event/party/wedding / public park where two people happen to kiss . 
  i 'm talking about specifically taking a picture of you kissing and nothing else . 
  ok the screaming in the last 10 seconds was terrible , but what was so bad about the first 40 seconds ? 
  sounded like any other amateur playing drums i 've ever heard . 
  the high school i went to even had 2 specialized classes for musicians , and nothing they ever came up with sounded much better than that . 
  so you 're the 16 year old who 's so much more mature than his peers and thus can give accurate analysis like this one ? 
  because we all know there 's no middle ground between not leaving your house and taking awkward selfies with your bae . 
  to be honest i think this kinda makes `` mario '' look like a dick and nothing else . 
  if i came across an athlete or someone i 'm a big fan of and took an obvious `` fan pic '' i 'd probably caption it with something like `` partying with _____ '' or similar . 
  even if it was completely obvious we just ran into each other . 
  it 's more of a joke . 
  i do n't really understand why this mario fellow even cares enough to `` correct '' them . 
  apparently he 's a millionaire superstar , let those girls have their fun . 
  honestly i have no clue what you 're trying to say here but i just want to make it clear i personally have no problem with `` pdas '' . 
  in fact i think it 's silly that in america it 's such an issue that not only do you have a word for it , it has a generally recognized abbreviation . 
  but yeah i think the difference maker here is whether your showing affection towards your so , or if you 're whoring for attention/trying to show off . 
  giving them a kiss is one of the above while taking facebook selfies of your kissing is the other . 
  yeah an overly jealous girlfriend is the only reason i could come up with . 
  or maybe his pr agent saw the tweet and did n't like it . 
  [ was this how you felt while entering the theater ] ( http://gifwall.net/gif/gw-707305original.gif ) ? 
  i on the other hand pirated it and watched it home alone like a true thinker . 
  view all images + endless reddit . 
  scroll scroll away , no reading required . 
  i admit i am the cancer . 
  you do realize a lot of people actually live in apartment buildings ? 
  this looks like it was taken from his window = that is his `` front yard '' . 
  this guy sounds like an awkward teenager trying too hard to be funny , but i do n't see anything out of the ordinary or cringeworthy about that pic . 
  oh yeah you 're probably pretty much correct . 
  i actually read that last message before the edit and it was even more difficult trying to understand what you were getting at . 
  to me he looks like [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bfhzy.jpg ) . 
  yeah i do n't think this is really cringeworthy . 
  it 's more just sad because these people seem like they 're between 15 and 17 . 
  unless my understanding of technology is incorrect you ( op ) actually decided to use that font and not whoever posted this , right ? 
  because that font ( and the fact that it is n't default and thus it actually took effort to select it ) is way more cringeworthy than that posts , which is a pretty tall order . 
  yeah and honestly even if they had been friends at some point it 'd be even more awkward removing him because he 's now dating his ex . 
  so . . the fact that this dude got that girl gives all us reddit nerds some hope ? 
  sounds about right . 
  so you 're saying this is n't an ad ** against ** obamacare ? 
  so the national average would be around 40 in that graph then ? 
  that means 4 % of the population . 
  that is pretty high . 
  well what if his last semester was 1.5 or something ? 
  that would be something to be proud about . 
  maybe he has a reading disorder or something ? 
  maybe he 's just stupid and worked really hard ? 
  maybe his mom smoked crack while pregnant and he was born addicted . 
  we do n't know . 
  honestly there 's not enough info here to cringe . 
  that is true . 
  at least with res the title is displayed right there on top of the pic . 
  i remember years ago when i had tabs full of reddit pics and i had to go back and try to figure out which one was which because of the jokes in the titles . 
  is n't that the same pic flipped ? 
  you 're clearly on a computer . 
  there is no excuse of taking a picture of the screen . 
  i could understand if you saw something on television and lacked the proper hardware but this is obviously a computer monitor . 
  well technically that would be sexist . 
  i do n't really care either way as it 's a character in a video game but i believe technically that could be classified as sexism . 
  it 's the exact same class performing exactly as well but because someone told you it 's a female ( you ca n't actually see any reproductive organs let alone your own body or your face at any point in the game ) you 're not enjoying it as much as if someone told you the identical character you 're playing as was male . 
  i would n't get in an argument over it though . 
  to be fair i did laugh at `` surprise motherfucker '' . 
  wait are you saying that the usb ports are less useful than the cd drive you never noticed was missing ? 
  i think we found the one person in the world who does n't use usb ports . 
  i do n't know about the ti nspire cx but the ti-83 / 84 we still use and which still costs about 100 $ has hardware from like the 80s . 
  and that thing runs at least mario .
