  e. yeah the ti-84 + released in 2004 which i have apparently boasts an impressive 15mhz cpu with 128kb 's of ram . 
  only 24kb of that is `` user accessible '' though . 
  well worth the 130 euros . 
  not to mention the impressive 96x64 monochrome display . 
  at 5 ' 8 '' you still might get shit for being short though . 
  i think 6 feet is the perfect mix of practicality and manliness . 
   after endocrinologist dr. gad kletter 's treatment with high dose testosterone , his growth was arrested . 
  that doctor totally ruined his one shot at the guinness record book, 
   since he was so tall he did n't have feeling in his feet, 
  source ? 
  honestly if someone found the pic it 'd make the front page of reddit . 
  not spacedicks or picsofdeadjailbait but something like / r/wtf . 
  running into a famous person in a party and saying `` i was partying with a famous person '' does n't really constitute as lying in my book . 
  when will there be an os x release ? 
  i bought the game after wikipedia listed it as `` platform ( s ) : microsoft windows , mac os x '' only to find out it was windows-only . 
  i 'm not blaming you as steam clearly did say it was windows only and it was my personal screw up but i 'd really like a port . 
  i could n't even get it to run on a virtual machine running win7 which usually has no problems with source games . 
  to be honest if i had a decently attractive girl to play vidya and have sex with i would n't really care if she had a dick . 
  the gunner was inside the car while an rpg round exploded also inside of the car ? 
  how can you survive that ? 
  does he still have legs ? 
  also i 'm guessing there are much more `` terrorist '' fighters who 've actually seen these vehicles get hit in real life than there are in a moderately sized non-default subreddit . 
  while i agree i think this argument is better at showing why the 2nd amendment is retarded , and not really that good at justifying rpg sales to civilians . 
  well i think `` in jest '' is implied when talking about busting your balls . 
  i do n't see how that matters . 
  apm is only useful when compared with other people 's apm , and as long as how that 's calculated is standard it does n't really matter how it works in real life . 
  we could multiply everyone 's apm by 10 , and it 'd still be exactly as useful info as it is now . 
  i remember reading that announcement too . 
  it was one of those official blizzard posts . 
  i have no clue why they backed out of it . 
  i like the theoretical thinking behind swarm hosts . 
  i could imagine myself in a table discussing ideas for hots and get excited about this `` swarm host '' . 
  i feel it really captures the idea/atmosphere/tone of the zerg race . 
  it 's an unrelenting force and if you try to fight it straight up you will only lose . 
  humans/protoss must outsmart it instead of relying on brute force . 
  just like zerg always were in the lore . 
  however i agree the actual implementation and what it does to the game balance/metagame is terrible . 
   we zerg players hate it just as much as everyone else does . 
  no one 's really arguing that . 
  i think people are complaining about the developers who came up with it and not people who use it . 
  everyone realizes there are sometimes units `` too good not to use '' even if you dislike them . 
  while i agree , i 've seen plenty of games that were way too long and boring because of this even if they were n't three hours . 
  not really because no one uses `` real time '' when referring to starcraft match lengths . 
  yeah but you can do that at someone else 's house just as well . 
  nobody 's saying parties are a bad idea , just that there 's really no reason to have them at your place . 
  that being said i did have parties at my house while growing up , i just made sure there was no one there i did n't know because that 's when shit hits the fan . 
  i never had anything broken or stolen either . 
  except for a shower head and other minor things . 
  while it 's true you can not generalize one american to represent the entire nation are you seriously suggesting american 's do n't have a differing view on both alcohol and the use of police/government agencies in domestic issues when compared to the rest of the western civilization ? 
  also it 'd probably leave some sort of record with the police/social services which are never good for your child . 
  it 's much more likely to hurt them more than that `` lesson '' helped . 
  really some sort-sighted parenting here . 
  no but they broke ** the law ** and thus must be punished by the proper authorities . 
  it 's not about helping people . 
  it 's ** justice ** . 
  what ? 
  your kids would n't be allowed to bring home a friend from school without getting permission from you first ? 
  you sound like tons of fun and that kid is going to be popular . 
  let 's have a moment of silence for r/picsofdeadjailbait, 
  i never got people smoking incense to hide weed smoke . 
  if there 's anything more suspicious than marijuana smell it 'd be incense . 
  my sister was into that stuff when i was younger and i hated whenever she smoked it while i was high . 
  there was never any weed smell in the house but that fucking incense was everywhere and got me super paranoid because it is colloquially known as the `` covering up weed '' smell . 
  are you trying to use common logic to battle paranoid stoner logic ? 
  and now we 're both probably on some sort of a watch list, 
  yeah but if the rpg hit the windscreen from the front , would n't that original direction that the energy goes to be right where the gunner 's midsection is located ? 
  i switched from sl to ml as well and it was a mess . 
  until i completely formatted my hard drive and did a clean install of ml . 
  this way it is better than sl was . 
  honestly it 's staggering how shitty the `` upgrade '' feature is . 
  i remember having a similiar issue with tiger and whatever came after tiger as well . 
  of course a clean install is always faster than a year or two old but just to give you some idea/benchmarks i used to play cs : go at 720p with everything turned to `` low '' and it would play at a pretty solid 60fps at the old sl -  ml install . 
  after the reformatting i get either 60fps with 1440p and everything at max , or what i actually did was turn the settings into a mix of high/low and it 'll play at 160-200fps at 1440p . 
  it 's amazing how big the difference is . 
  i expected some performance boost but definitely not this . 
  so what i 'm wondering is , can i do a clean install of mavericks ? 
  if there 's anything i 've learnt from previous os x versions is that upgrades only slow you down . 
  if you want to fix `` general slowness '' a clean install is your only option . 
  there 's a separate app for that ? 
  i always just used the disk utility . 
  do i need that app for some reason or can i still download an image that the disk utility will understand ? 
  no , but yes . 
  you do n't * have to * for sure . 
  but at least from my personal experiences upgraded os x 's are a mess . 
  they usually work slower than either the old one did or the new one is supposed to and the updated software sometimes bug out and do n't work in unison . 
  i 've had this happen every time i 've upgraded , and it 's always been fixed by a clean install . 
  just this week i did a clean install of ml after using an upgraded one for about 3 months , and it feels like a completely different computer . 
  even the os feels like it was updated , even though i was technically using the exact same version in the updated install . 
  / r/cheeseburgers does n't get that many posts these days but every time it does i 'm reminded why i 'm subscribed . 
  that 's actually a good point . 
  iirc rpg-7 rounds ( i 'm assuming this is what was used though it 's likely a knock-off so who knows what kind of technology was used ) detonate purely based on acceleration , or g-forces . 
  would penetrating a windshield provide enough g-forces for it to detonate ? 
  i for one do n't know . 
  once both sides run out of gas they realize the marine was always the best unit anyway . 
  and why the speed 99,9 % of the matches are played on is n't called `` normal '' is still a mystery to us all . 
  with those knees ? 
  i doubt it . 
  # 1 already has a fix . 
  disable auto-aim . 
  also comes with the side-effect of a much more enjoyable game .
