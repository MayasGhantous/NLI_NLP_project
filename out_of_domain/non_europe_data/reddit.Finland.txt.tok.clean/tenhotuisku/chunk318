  when combined with water the toilet seat becomes clean . 
  amazing , i know . 
  i do n't even do aiming . 
  i just stand above the toilet . 
  where else is it going to go ? 
  i do n't use my hands to pee , and i do n't have a tendency to miss the toilet . 
  the seller demands another currency be used ? 
  like the euro or pounds ? 
  or whatever the country you 're importing from uses . 
  you think us companies have their money in physical us dollar bills locked in a safe somewhere ? 
  the breaking bad wiki says 99.1 % , though it does n't mention which episode that number is from . 
  yeah but they 're fake tits so there 's nothing miraculous about them being nice . 
  do n't get me wrong , i like fake tits just as much as anyone else on this sub , but having big fake tits is n't really that astonishing when it 's something anyone with the money can do . 
  yeah i know but huge natural tits sometimes make you wonder how is that even physically possible . 
  fake tits lack that aspect since they 're man made . 
  yeah but i 'm not really astounded that human beings we 're able to manufacture an implant that size . 
  the question that one brings up is `` why ? '', 
  not `` how ? '', 
  good point , but neither `` why '' nor `` why not '' leave me bewildered . 
  yeah southern finland as well . 
  i do n't see hedgehogs that often anymore because i live in an apartment but growing up in the suburb i 'd see multiple hedgehogs every week during the summer . 
  i did n't know they were rare in the us . 
  something wrong with it ? 
  why ? 
  i live in the city and most of the squirrels i see are n't scared of people at all . 
  we used to hand feed them all the time as kids . 
  how did not knowing that affect your life ? 
  what would you had done differently had you knew ? 
  owning a lambo takes boldness ? 
  and besides , i think your lambo comparison is accurate . 
  if i saw a lambo driving down the street i 'd think `` nice car '' . 
  not `` how is that possible ? '' . 
  just as when i see rikki six i think `` nice tits '' . 
  in scandinavia it 's even worse because wealthy people are evil . 
  at least you guys can buy mb 's and bmw 's without getting dirty looks . 
   also why would that `` please '' you, 
  because southeners are known for being racist assholes and jose is a mexican name . 
  there . 
  i gave you the real reason it pleased him and why it pleases me without tippy toeing around and talking bullshit about `` increased diversity '' . 
  i know jayden james ... 
  there is no such thing as fundamentally `` good '' . 
  and if there was , pleasing a person or two on the internet would n't be the definition of it . 
  there are none . 
  i 'm dead serious . 
  i own a 360 ( technically i 've owned three ) and no ps3 and the only thing i 'm jelly about are the ps3 exlusives . 
  honestly i think `` even '' halo and gears of war are total crap . 
  there are way better fps and 3rd person shooters on both consoles . 
  i ca n't for the life of me think of a single good 360 exclusive . 
  there are some decent ones but even those came out on pc . 
  e. i read through this [ entire thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_video_game_exclusives_%28seventh_generation%29#xbox_360 ) and i did forget about saints row 1 being 360 exclusive . 
  so ok , there 's one good exclusive . 
  there are better games is a valid reasoning . 
  there are games with more fluid controls , more interesting plot , more variety in missions/maps etc. 
  the list goes on . 
  there are too many better games to call gow good . 
   millions of fans and dollars prove you wrong . 
  billions of flies ca n't be wrong . 
  horse shit is delicious . 
  \\  heavy rain, 
  \\  game, 
  but yeah i 'm the same as your brother . 
  really the only reason i have a 360 is that the ps3 controller is atrocious . 
  that and xbl is better than psn . 
  thanks for the effort but the actor i 'm thinking about looks a lot more like him than that . 
  those are `` kinda a little in the same direction '' . 
  the guy i 'm thinking about could be his identical twin . 
  yeah i know but damian lewis is too handsome . 
  i actually did try to search google for actors that look like damian lewis before this post :d, 
  i 'm 98 % sure that 's him !, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  e. and the role i was thinking of was probably reno 911 in case anyone cares . 
  a good 3rd person shooter game ? 
  vanquish is one of my all-time favourites if you want one that is n't commonly known . 
  it has an even worse plot than gow though , but the gameplay is 11/10 so it more than makes up for it . 
  max payne 3 was great . 
  just cause 2 . 
  i even liked army of twos a lot though they 're often considered gow clones . 
  you ca n't not mention mass effect 2 either when talking about 3rd person shooters . 
  the thing that always bothered me about halo was that the guns lacked `` oomph '' or balls or whatever you call it . 
  shooting them was n't satisfying . 
  that and shooting little space critters is n't my cup of tea either . 
  it just does n't feel `` good '' . 
  it 's really hard to explain . 
  i have n't played the series enough to really commentate on the story and aside from the curving bullets in multiplayer i guess the controls/technical aspects of the gameplay are fine . 
  it 's just that in a shooter game not enjoying shooting the weapons can easily be a dealbreaker . 
  yeah i was talking about the online service and not the arcade games . 
  in my experience the psn friends/party chat/seamless integration to games was very lacking compared to xbl . 
  that and download speeds . 
  there was the biggest difference . 
  i do n't really mind paying 3 $ a month for a service that has worked nearly with zero issues for many years after trying to get my friends ' / girlfriend 's ps3 's to work ( apparently i 'm the guy you call over when you 're having network issues ) . 
  i had a ps1 and a ps2 . 
  then a gamecube and a 360 . 
  i 'm no stranger to dualshock . 
  it was fine in the 90s and early 2000s but it stopped evolving . 
  the nes controller was great when it was new , now it hurts my hands and has 1/5 of the buttons required for modern games . 
  i especially dislike the convex sticks . 
  i do n't understand why you would design sticks that way , there is no advantage to it in my mind . 
  that and the trigger buttons which are terribly bad . 
  even shooters on ps3 do n't use the buttons called `` triggers '' . 
  that 's a sign of bad triggers .
