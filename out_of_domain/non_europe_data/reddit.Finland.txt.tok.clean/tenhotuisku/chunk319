  not to mention trying to fine control something like acceleration in a racing game , the way the triggers are i 'm not comfortable holding them anywhere else than 0 % or 100 % because they feel like they 're constantly slipping . 
  on xbox there is a fluid range of motion . 
  it 's a personal preference as everyone 's hand are different but the dualshock is simply too small for me . 
  there is no place for my pinkies to go . 
  i 'm never not acknowledging that i 'm holding a piece of hardware in my hands . 
  the xbox 360 controller feels like an extension of my hands much like the gc wavebird did . 
  i do n't think about pressing buttons or pulling triggers , i think about actions in the game and my hands transmits them to the console . 
  i prefer the non-symmetrical setup as well as i rarely play d-pad games , but again that 's just personal preference . 
  indeed, 
  for me the 360 one upped gamecube . 
  however i still think the 360 controller was modeled after the gc controller . 
  gc was amazing at it 's time . 
  i like how that was the police officer 's first sentence after stepping out of police car . 
  no `` mam could you please step aside '' just `` get away from the fucking car '' . 
  gets the point across a lot better .

  yeah now it does . 
  it did n't when i commented 26 minutes ago . 
  you 've never held a 360 controller ? 
  damn . 
  it 's like the wavebird 2.0 . 
  it feels like an extension to your hand . 
  the gc got close , but the 360 perfected the design . 
  no you can disagree . 
  it just does n't make anyone `` wrong '' or `` bad '' . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i have n't gotten any keychain popups since my last reinstall . 
  i do remember getting them when i installed snow leopard after tiger though . 
  my guess is the are a `` first-time thing '' as in you do it once and it learns what you want . 
  indeed . 
  yea but that 's what confuses me about this photo . 
  if he has his finger off the trigger ( like he should ) then why point the gun at his face ? 
  if he felt intimidated enough to shove the barrel down his face should n't he also feel intimidated enough to place his finger on the trigger ? 
  also the game is running on nearly 10 year old hardware . 
   the horrible object rendering distance was disappointing . 
  really ? 
  if there 's one thing that constantly surprises me about this game even after 200 hours is the draw distance . 
  i ca n't think of a game ( especially on consoles ) that can even hold a candle to gta v. maybe just cause 2 but that world is mostly forest and mountains anyway . 
  i ca n't be the only one who thinks hour-long missions sound amazing ? 
  i get why people would compared 5 to sa since the cities are named the same , but the gta3 generation games did n't really try to imitate their real life counterparts . 
  they tried to be in the same theme , not really videogame representations of the real city . 
  gta3 's liberty city has barely anything to do with new york except that for the atmosphere . 
  i went to florence for a vacation after playing ac2 . 
  it was pretty amazing . 
  it 's what you would expect from an american/italian vodka . 
  if you want quality vodka russia or ex-soviet countries is the way to go . 
  that 's just inexperience . 
  growing up in finland ( the only other country than canada where hockey is the most popular sport ) i of course wacthed hockey all the time . 
  i never ever realized `` not seeing the puck '' was actually an issue to some people , i only learnt of it after coming to reddit . 
  and i 'm talking about sd , in hd it 's even more baffling to me how someone can not see the puck . 
  what i 'm trying to say is keep at it . 
  soon it wo n't bother you . 
  i know you 're joking but in places like finland you actually get a [ free box of baby stuff ] ( http://www.kela.fi/aitiyspakkaus ) like clothes and basic toys when you have a kid . 
  i think sweden has a similiar thing . 
  and the cardboard box doubles as an emergency crib . 
  i actually remember reading somewhere that nearly 3/4 of finnish kids spent their first night in that box . 
   ex-soviet countries, 
  i call in merryweather choppers all the time but i 've never actually not shot the pilot as soon as he lands . 
  you ca n't drive the train ?? 
  i automatically assumed you can because of that mission . 
  now all those times i tried climbing onto the locomotive only to get crushed under the cars feel even more stupid . 
  or neither when it comes to things like conscription, 
  you 're rolling them wrong if that 's even possible . 
  unless you want it to happen . 
  i know it was a joke but jokes are often an exaggeration of truth . 
  it 's impossible to find anything on vine even if they do give credit . 
  i do n't know if i 'd need the app to search by username or something , the website is pure crap . 
  [ skyrim ] ( http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/m/image/1353/46/1353462673006.png ), 
  itt people who ca n't play for shit . 
  i have n't `` traded wins '' or boosted or anything . 
  i always try to get a maxed out lobby and my win % is something like 40 %, 
  i 'm not even a forza/gran turismo `` veteran '' or anything . 
  the last racing game i really played was burnout 3 . 
  i think it 's very plausible someone who was into racing games could easily get over 50 % without `` cheating '' . 
  there 's ways of avoiding the ramming . 
  that 's what i love about down the drain . 
  i joined a random session with 3 people from the same `` cew '' day 1 or 2 of online . 
  they were obviously in it to get quick wins so i stayed with them for a while . 
  soon it turned into the three of them trying to ram me out of the track . 
  nothing more satisfying than braking ahead of time myself or going `` off track '' for a second while they all tried to hit me full speed , then taking a slow turn and winning the race because they tried too hard to ram me . 
  not all racing is just `` perfect lines '' like in a formula 1 time trial . 
  39 % says right there . 
  and like i said i 'm not a driving game expert . 
  i 'm thinking you just suck at driving and/or are in deep state of denial if you 're that convinced 50 % is `` impossible '' . 
  it 's not easy . 
  it 's not something everyone can have of course . 
  but it 's entirely possible if you 're good at gta driving . 
  that 's a pretty standard price for beer in finland ( 6 $ for 0.4 l ) and all finnish beer is absolute crap . 
  well there are some good microbrews but anything manufactured on a large scale . 
  i do n't know where you live but in helsinki ** all ** places have 0.4 l beers , not 0.5 l, 
  i 'm not talking about special beer places like kaisla that of course have all shapes and sizes but regular bars and pubs . 
  a lot of people do n't know how to pick components let alone put them together . 
  yes i know . 
  r/buildapc . 
  a lot of people do n't know . 
  it 's not like they 're overpaying because they enjoy it . 
  i 'm surprised cringepics and cringe were about as big as darksouls .
