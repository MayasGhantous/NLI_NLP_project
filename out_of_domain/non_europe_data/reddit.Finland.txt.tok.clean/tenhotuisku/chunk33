  the rest of the world does n't give a fuck . 
  we download torrents on our wired , wireless and cell phone internet connections and yet a single isp in my country has n't enforced caps . 
  you 're just used to shitty service . 
   the united states is founded on the idea that there is right and wrong , and some things that you can not stand for . 
  nope . 
  it was founded on freedom and as a republic . 
  big difference . 
  the civilized world not including north america, 
  e. i heard there are some caps in the uk as well , but they 've always had crappy internet technology, 
  good point . 
  but are they all south korean super humans ? 
  yeah it made me laugh too about a million years ago when i first saw this, 
  then why is it ok to bitch about women 's magazines ? 
  all they show are skinny girls . 
  you do n't have to do anything to be skinny , just do n't eat too much . 
  like you said , it takes men years of hard work and knowledge to get in the shape that magazines , movies etc depict as standard . 
  i 'd much rather just control my eating than be on a diet and work hard . 
  that 's not the sort of thing you rage over , that 's just a bad round . 
  having a killstreak of 10 when some fucktard kills you with an rc-xd is a reason to rage . 
  do n't get me wrong the u.s has horrible internet connections ( especially for private people ) . 
  the u.k is just bad for northern european . 
   well , men are certainly funnier, 
  ftfy, 
  no , she really is n't . 
  acknowledging differences between nations ( not races or people ) is racism ? 
  this . 
  you should place the carb somewhere else though, 
  how did you not know this stuff ? 
  my mom taught them to me when i was a kid and then we learnt it again at school . 
  hivemind will hate on me but fuck creepers . 
  they 're not challenging or fun or innovative , just god damn annoying . 
  especially when they spawn inside your motherfucking house when loading a world . 
  i know you 're a karmawhore and not just genuinely nice but i upvoted anyway, 
  enjoying video games on a friday night has nothing to do with social anxiety . 
  video games are fucking awesome . 
  i bet she loves any attention, 
  finland has these taxes too but on cds , dvds , hdds etc as well yet it 's still illegal to pirate & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  luckily stores like verkkokauppa.com get around that by shipping them from a warehouse in estonia or \u00c5land, 
  we do n't mind hearing stories about your masturbation either , just not the clotty blood stuff mmkay ? 
  ac1 is pretty shitty yeah . 
  ac2 and acb is what i recommend . 
  i love being high with friends, 
  i love being high alone, 
  get out of r/trees, 
  stop being a beetch, 
  for those who do n't know livonia is pretty much what 's now the `` baltic '' aka lithuania , latvia , estonia, 
  yes . 
  yes we are . 
  i do n't mind kid poop but motherfucking grandma poop . 
  old , runny poop that just slips into the pool with no control what so ever . 
  this is why i 'll never go to a spa and much less high . 
  well i do n't love kids ' urine either, 
  `` did i just shit someone '', 
  i ca n't be the only one, 
   too bad this is n't 4chan, 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm a `` gamer '' with a mac . 
  pc gaming is n't the only form of gaming . 
  finally a clever sbm that does n't just stop mid sentence for an easy joke ( shoot . . e-mail etc ), 
  so why not just put the cookies on sale and have a big sign that says cookies -50 % ? 
  i do n't see the benefits of a in-store coupon machine . 
  or have they just proven to be more effective than simple discounts ? 
  stupid people like bright colours and pieces of paper etc. 
  you do n't use all your paid vacation days !? 
  but . . but you already get like 1/4 of european vacation days to start with, 
  real-life karma ? 
  for being a dick and then drawing a hat to the other guy thus trying to make him look like the bad guy ? 
  i do n't see how you slowing him down helped anybody . 
  you do n't get karma for `` if i ca n't then you ca n't either ! '', 
  i had actually never heard the term `` full stop '', 
  also , i always read your name as `` nsfw_non_stop '' idk why, 
  oh so the company refunds the store for the discount ? 
  censored tits ** and ** nsfw wtf man ? 
  damn, 
  i reab about this ( american ) company that eliminated vacation days all together and `` let their employees take as much vacation as they wanted '' . 
  sounded pretty iffy . 
  i think a simple `` narwhal ? '', 
  answered with either bacon or midnight is fine . 
  after all it 's just one word , not a saying that sounds like the lamest joke ever . 
  i upvoted for changing `` what 's hot '' , not specifically to op 's suggestion, 
  ignore everything else in this thread . 
  so it 's like the 1950 's version of taking a picture of the screen to post on myspace or facebook instead of a screenshot ? 
  but why would you want something that `` feels just like tighty whities '' ? 
  the best thing about boxers is that they ** do n't ** feel like tighty whities but spacious and comfortable . 
  exactly this . 
  you should easily be able to get free airfare , hotels etc. 
  and they 'd probably greet you as a hero after some proper media hype . 
  but violence is wrong when it 's towards women !, 
  i 'm guessing you 're european . 
  just a [ reminder ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1aysh3o4kmo/te3llscp6pi/aaaaaaaaakm/gkmbbfwoxnu/s640/texas+europe+size+comparison+map.jpg ) , america is fucking huge . 
  and in most places you must use a car . 
  i 'm european myself so you do n't need to try and troll me but like the map shows the u.s is a huge fucking country . 
  yes there are rural areas in europe but the distances are on a whole other level . 
  no one said anything about perfect but at least most places i 've visited have something . 
  in the u.s i 've never seen any busses or trains outside the major cities . 
  your xbox is on with no controllers turned on . 
  stop wasting electricity & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  what a douche, 
   a bra for your testicles, 
  do not want & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;,
