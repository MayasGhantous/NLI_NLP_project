  would n't he be 4 * same * people ? 
  this has nothing to do with racism , it 's a fact . 
  white people are n't superior , but being white has it 's advantages . 
  i know . 
  but you see 40km is jack shit in the united states . 
  you remember the pic of texas from above ? 
  the single u.s state ? 
  size of a 696,241 km2 compared to austria 's 83,855 km2 . 
  yes the gas is cheaper , but when you but it in perspective with the distances to the nearest wal-mart or schools or a hospital you 'll see that the $ / km is not that much off . 
  well of course the u.s is a cheaper nation to begin with but that 's a whole other story . 
   we need to waste gas, 
  i 'm european . 
  i do n't own a car . 
  but i have spent time in the u.s and believe it or not it 's ten times easier to not waste gas in europe . 
  yes , yes i am . 
  it 's not racism if it 's towards us westeners . 
  1 reader, 
  it 's just boring, 
  actually there 's about 370 kcal in 32oz of coke ( [ sauce ] ( http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/generic/coca-cola-2/ ) ) and less than 10 in diet, 
  same pic was posted to this same subreddit yesterday . 
  without the friend 's face though . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/phsli.jpg ) the uncropped in case someone wants it, 
   saying stuff like that is insensitive, 
  you should probably get off the internet while you still can, 
  now all you need to do is go on the xbox live or psn and lose 12-0 to some kid, 
   to be as skinny as the girls on the magazine , you have to abuse your body and inflict long-lasting damage on it . 
  what . 
  no you do n't . 
  of course there are always some women who take it over the top and look like skeletor but you can be skinny and healthy . 
  i must know !, 
  my cousin lives right `` under '' that building too . 
  been there once but they did n't let us off the floor level & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  yeah this internet thing is just a fad . 
  soon people will buy cd 's again . 
  accidently a, 
  i do n't see what belt of hand have to do with this . 
  yes i agree kids are over-diagnosed with add and no i do n't think asperger is even a real disorder but that does n't mean i 'd hit a kid . 
  my children will be raised drug free ( the mental kind , i do n't see anything wrong with cold medicine , shots etc. ), 
  but also without violence . 
  100 % birghtess on a led display 24/7, 
  feels good man, 
  well idk , i was watching this show about english police too about a month ago and they arrested a ( white ) man for wearing gloves and having a screwdriver in his back pocket . 
  they were n't looking for a suspect in a particular crime or anything . 
  the cops just flagged him as suspicious `` because he was wearing gloves '' ( they said this about 5 times ) and the screwdriver could be used to break into houses . 
  i was there for two days and based on those two days i 'm never going back . 
  even for sweden it was a shitty place . 
  well ok the place was ok but the people & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i 'm not epileptic or anything but are people supposed to enjoy this ? 
  [ `` gamegirl '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2la_u4pjpb4&amp;t=15 ), 
  go home jerry, 
   he knew there was no real risk involved, 
  yeah because a stun-gun that does n't work at all is a lot more probable than a stupid crook mixing volts and amps, 
  americans do n't protest . 
  they accept things . 
  probably this :, 
  because why should we always be the big spoon ? 
  lol u mad, 
   if this is real , i kinda feel bad for her now . 
  should n't it be the opposite ? 
  if this is n't real , but the chick in the pic exists i feel bad for her . 
  otherwise hell no . 
   of course , for the average redditor this is n't the cause , so let 's guestimate that maybe 5 times a week you spank your monkey using memories, 
  i can only speak for myself but 5 times sounds like a lot . 
  i bet i 'm not the only one who turns to imagination only when internet , saved porn , smart phone , ipod , old stashed porno mag , television , that 20sec sex scene in that on movie you have on dvd , mail order lingerie catalog and donald duck 's `` magica de spell '' special comic book are all unavailable . 
  well it 's not like the developers intentionally let their content to be shared on the internet for free . 
  are you seriously suggesting that there will be an end to internet piracy ? 
  just out of curiosity , do you also believe that the u.s will win the war on drugs some day ?

  fell this is n't r/feminism either so get back in the kitchen, 
   the women on magazines are n't real . 
  they are photoshopped cartoon characters . 
  do n't think for a second that men 's fitness magazines do n't photoshop their pictures . 
  it 's funny because it 's true, 
  i know right . 
  reposting old shit even when it has a timestamp in the picture . 
  makes me sick . 
  front row is really , really shitty compared to xbmc or plex ( well plex was ruined in the latest updates but still ) . 
  i highly recommend you try either one . 
  i 'd be glad to have front row removed just so it would n't randomly start up when i use the remote . 
  people still use plex after the latest update that completely raped the library and no longer let you just browse files ? 
  do they know xbmc exists ? 
  the scrolling is upside down in lion ? 
  i bet this is a genius new feature that will revolutionize web browsing . 
  lion removed spaces !? 
  well i knew there was no reason to update but ... what the fucking shit :d i could never use my mac without spaces . 
  oh i forgot , i should probably post this to r/offbeat or r/spacedicks so the glorious circlejerk is n't affected, 
  because most alive americans have lived in the cold war era when they were brainwashed from children to believe that socialism is the ultimate evil . 
  you really need to browse the internet some more and toughen up . 
  this was a legitimate epic of a doctor and a tumour . 
  there was n't even any blood or tentacle rape . 
  i do n't have a job , a car , a college education or my own place so no , i 'm not that picky . 
  my gf does have all of those though lol, 
  well that sounds . . horrible . 
  `` get over it '' . 
  best explanation for unnecessarily changing shit up . 
  yeah but from what the apple webpage tells me it seems you have to create a new `` space '' each time your desktop gets crowded . 
  i personally have 6 spaces always running , 4 of which are in use 100 % of the time and applications start up in specific spaces . 
  i do n't see a reason to change this . 
  i own a mbp with a trackpad . 
  i know how the scrolling works .
