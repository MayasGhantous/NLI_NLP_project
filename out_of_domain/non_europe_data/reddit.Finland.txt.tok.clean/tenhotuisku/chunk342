  i did it . 
  my sensitivity is probably 1/8 of what it was 6 months ago . 
  definitely worth it , took about a month to really get used to it . 
  to do a 180 i 'd have to move the mouse about 30 cm . 
  i do have a 60cm wide mousepad so that helps . 
  while it 's true that finland lost a big piece of territory in the peace agreement you have to remember that finland was a relatively new country ( 22 years since the declaration of independence ) and the border with russia was still a bit hazy . 
  the finnish government nor the finnish people really cared that much about the sparsely populated karelian territory and mainly just wanted to keep their independence . 
  viipuri was a big loss , but it had always stayed culturally a very russian city compared to other major finnish cities which were much more influenced by sweden . 
  as someone else pointed out the finnish army was fighting on their last fumes so they probably would had accepted an even worse deal . 
  helsinki , turku , tampere and oulu ( the other culturally and economically important cities ) are all located much further away from the russian border . 
  these days those areas are not really seen as `` old finnish territory lost to russians '' but as `` russian territory finland controlled for a while '' . 
   were they really allied with nazi germany, 
  enemy of my enemy and so forth . 
  the nazi ideology never gained mainstream popularity in finland , though finland did hand over a total of 8 jews to nazi germany as well as some russian pows that in all likelihood included some jewish people . 
  this was mainly due to germany refusing to send food aid unless finland agreed to extradite the jews . 
  none of the extradited jews were finnish citizens and though judaism was never common in finland the finnish army did in fact have some jewish soldiers . 
  my grandfather and his brother are both jewish veterans and when i was younger i did ask him about it for a school assignment . 
  he said they were purely fighting for finnish independence with no regard for world politics . 
  he did tell me some stories about younger officers who tried to get ahead by endorsing the nazi ideals especially during the semi-frequent visits from german higher ranking officers but from what i understood these were isolated incidents and he never encountered any discrimination from his commanding officers or fellow soldiers . 
  actually there is one story he still likes to tell after a few schnapps that involves him knocking out a former comrade with a single punch in a night club in the late 40s but it 's more of an anecdote than a history lesson . 
  it 's a shame [ this article ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_juutalaisluovutukset ) is n't available in english , since the finnish-to-english google translate is pretty shitty . 
   how was viipuri very russian, 
  my grandfather is from viipuri and his family was relatively wealthy so he still has many books full of photographs from his childhood . 
  i loved to stare at those pictures every time i visited them as a kid and of course this is just a personal opinion as you ca n't measure `` russian '' but everything from the architechture to the clothing , the food and the pastimes looks distinctively russian compared to pictures from my mother 's side for example ( they 're from helsinki ) . 
  the orthodox church is the biggest religion in viipuri and there were a lot of jews as well , neither of which are common in western finland . 
  as to your other point . 
  i did n't say nobody cared about karelia . 
  it was just of less importance than the independence of the rest of finland when it came time for difficult decisions . 
  i 'm just sitting here stunned that there are enough people who change pants ** every day ** for this to make the front page . 
  you people are the weird ones !, 
  do you people make little notes in your calendar whenever you wash your jeans or how do you know when it 's been a month or two ? 
  i personally wash mine when they get ( visibly ) dirty . 
  if i had to guess i 'd estimate about once every month or two . 
  i never considered that foul , seems pretty reasonable to me . 
  well yeah but you said it yourself your pants get filthy . 
  being dirty is a proper reason to wash pants . 
  having worn them for a day is n't in itself . 
   essentially , i 'm asking what the fuck it is that you do all day that allows you to wear jeans for months at a time ? 
  nothing much , clearly . 
  not work in a bar ? 
  and why do you sound mad ? 
  besides like i said i wash my jeans when they get visibly dirty . 
  meaning i do n't wear dirty garments . 
  my jeans do n't get dirty in a day or a week . 
  well my other clothes do n't really get dirty that often either . 
  they just absorb sweat . 
  legs do n't sweat much . 
  at least if you 're not running , which i do n't do in jeans . 
  shitty american internet connections for the past 20 years has n't been great for the scene either . 
  foxy di, 
  they have their own production company . 
  i doubt he really asked for anyone 's permission . 
  they probably got the demolition site `` to blow it up on tv '' or something similiar without a mention of a guy hanging in the middle of it . 
  i remember seeing the original video and i think these guys were sports fishermen . 
  they do n't really care about eating the fish , they 've already probably weighed them and got a pic of them = all they could get out of a fish . 
  then this happens and on camera . 
  i would n't be mad either . 
   did you notice the woman standing on the left ? 
  i almost did n't see her . 
  i 'm still not entirely sure what this is about , though . 
  lol . 
  a girl who is educated can be anything she wants , like a teacher for the next generation . 
  a girl who is n't offered an education will probably end up a prostitute or something similiar , and that 's the example she 'll give to her kids . 
  meaning education or the lack of it affects more than one generation . 
  the lack of push to talk makes this useless . 
  r/trees is n't a pr event for legalization . 
  not every post here should be about sending an unrealistically positive image of people who smoke weed . 
  there are assholes who do it as well . 
  i for one enjoyed this photo , even though it portrayed one . 
  it 's a fucking joke . 
  you people are just as bad as the radical `` feminists '' you all hate so much . 
  i thought it was mildly clever and i 'm a man . 
  do n't forget there 's a second one coming out . 
  the first one was around $ 10 even as new so you do n't need to wait too long . 
  i read the first two sentences, 
   i hate these posts , they look great but set unrealistic expectations for gamers . 
  have you seen a game other than dayz in the last 5 years ? 
  you 're just as bad in regard of not being able to take a joke . 
  let 's not get carried away . 
  it 's an okay game . 
  it has a pretty good plot , though the entire `` this is your fault '' thing kinda suffers from the player having no choice . 
  ** spoilers **, 
  for example you ca n't not kill the civilians with the phosphorus . 
  i noticed them on my first playthrough so i tried to shoot the last apc with splash damage without hitting the civilians . 
  it 's not possible . 
  you have to shoot it in a way that kills the civilians to proceed . 
  also it 's impossible to try and clear that section without the phosphorus , some of the enemies wo n't actually take damage from bullets . 
  there 's videos testing this on youtube . 
  so you 're forced to do the things the game blames on you later . 
  ** spoilers over **, 
  also the shooting mechanics and the squad commands are below average . 
  i only played it for the plot , the gameplay was pretty damn terrible . 
  overall i would recommend it if you get it for cheap , but it is n't an `` amazing game '' . 
  the italian grap prix was 5 days after 9/11 . 
  it 's like a moment of silence . 
  they do n't directly help anyone either , but people find it nice to dedicate a moment to those lost . 
  this is the same idea , except they kept reminding people the entire race . 
  it 's a show of respect . 
  have you never played a shooter game that is n't on rails ? 
  like deus ex or something ?
