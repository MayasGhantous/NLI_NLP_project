  a fetus is not a human . 
  just like eating an egg is not the same as killing a bird . 
   try and imagine a person who has had more than 10 abortions . 
  think about it for a whole minute , miscarriages and other disasters aside those could have been 10 people . 
  she probably had a good reason for it . 
  if even the mother did n't want to raise that child , i 'm sure the world is better off without them . 
  we do n't need more people on earth . 
  we do n't need to use every opportunity possible to reproduce . 
  we 're already doing it too much . 
  the focus should be on quality , not quantity . 
  i 'd much rather see a woman raise her 11th pregnancy properly than have 10 shitty kids . 
  being fertilized does n't make it self-conscious or have feelings or senses . 
  the fetus never even realized it was alive . 
  that 's why it 's not murder . 
   a fetus is a human life because it becomes one most of the time, 
  so most of the time it becomes one ? 
  because it is n't one yet ? 
  is n't that the meaning of the word `` become '' ? 
  a transformation of sorts ? 
  i do n't really give a shit about the complexies of animal eggs or fetuses , but thanks for clearing that up . 
  implying the average person is that much better than this . 
  it 's not like these people had the opportunities you or me did . 
  i 'm not defending them , but people do sickening things to survive . 
   anthropocentrism / \u02cc\u00e6n\u03b8r\u0275p\u0275\u02c8s\u025bntr\u026az\u0259m / ( from greek : \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 , \u00e1nthr\u014dpos , `` human being '' ; and \u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd , k\u00e9ntron , `` center '' ) is the belief that human beings are the central or most significant species on the planet ( in the sense that they are considered to have a moral status or value higher than that of other animals ) , or the assessment of reality through an exclusively human perspective, 
  why would i give a shit about what people who declare themselves anthropocentrics think ? 
  i 'd much rather hear from a scientist or a vet or something . 
   you were once a fetus and so was i, 
  yea i was , and had i been aborted i would n't had suffered nor cared since i never knew what i `` missed '' . 
  your ideas about the sanctity of human life etc. 
  are all really nice ... in theory . 
  i like to take a more practical approach to things . 
  every time we avoid child * its own mother did n't want to raise * is a victory for the human race , even if that does conflict with your fairy tale ideals . 
  i do n't see a moral problem with abortions , it 's that simple . 
  if a mother does n't want to raise a child , she should n't have to . 
  not because `` it 's what 's right '' or any nonsense like that but because it 's what 's better for society as a whole . 
  nobody should be pressured or forced into parenthood . 
  that 's not a good starting point to raising a child , and nothing 's more important than our upbringing . 
  as for the fetus , a lot of people seem to have this `` what it could have been '' view . 
  i do n't see it that way . 
  it never came out of a vagina , it never experienced life , it did n't have any sort of self-consciousness ( is n't that why there 's a time limit to abortions ? 
  ) , it 's not a real human . 
  it does n't feel sad , it does n't know what it 's missing , it 's not murder . 
  i do n't consider a 2-3 month fetus any more a human beign than a tumor . 
  i know it could grow into a human unlike a tumor , but in it 's current state it 's not any more human than one . 
  had one of your friends been aborted , you probably would had found another friend around the same time in your life and you would 've never known about the one fetus that was aborted . 
  you would had had great times with your new friend just as you did with the aborted one . 
  that 's how live works . 
  also you know there 's no point to continue an abortion debate when it starts to resemble a time travel movie debate . 
  i do n't live in na so it is pretty easy for me to remove myself from american media 's binary system . 
  well i personally think a father should have the opportunity to waive all rights ( as well as responsibilities ) to the child as obviously you ca n't really give them the choice of abortion . 
  one parent is n't ideal , but i feel it 's enough . 
  better than neither one of them wanting to raise it . 
  a baby , while lacking fully developed intelligence can still feel pain , happiness etc. 
  it 's not a fertilized egg in a womb about to become a living creature , it already is one . 
  someone pointed that out . 
  however in my mind that detail does n't make any difference . 
  a fertilized egg is ** going to ** become a living human . 
  it is n't already one . 
  an abortion is done in the first trimester when i do n't consider the fertilized human egg to be a living creature yet . 
  if anything it makes the analogy bad , but it 's not like i stayed up all night coming up with it . 
  to a lot of people ( including me ) it does n't make any sort of difference whether the egg is fertilized or not . 
  it 's still not a human . 
  a fertilized egg ** will become one ** , but that 's why there 's a time limit to abortions . 
  before it becomes one . 
  while it 's still ( a fertilized ) egg . 
   killing a foetus immediately before birth is the same as killing a baby outside its mother 's body which means there must be a cut of point somewhere in the baby 's development, 
  who said anything about killing the baby immediately before birth ? 
  is n't the standard limitation to abortions around the end of first trimester ? 
  a 3 month old fetus is very different from a 9 month one . 
  birth is n't the cut off point to me . 
  because i did n't know the details of the development of a chicken egg i have no clue of the human reproductive process ? 
  if anything my analogy was bad . 
  i have my inbox full of people putting words in my mouth . 
  you are not the first one to refer to `` one day prior to birth '' while i never said that birth is the cut-off point . 
  in many of my posts i 've referred to the time limit of abortions that is usually around the end of the first trimester . 
  i think it 's a good limit . 
  of course a 9 month old baby is a baby whether it 's born or not . 
  you 're right that even three months is an arbitrary limit as well , but it 's a balance between the fetus being as little developed as possible and giving the parents some time to think about it . 
  yeah and plenty of people who have no other games than the nhl 's, 
  of course it should n't , but it 's much better than nothing . 
  because police officers deal with dangerous situations for a living ? 
  they actually go out to find trouble as their job . 
  you 're just looking to protect yourself in case something bad happens . 
  you do n't need the same equipment they do . 
  i said you do n't need the same equipment they do , i did n't say you do n't need anything . 
  i support gun ownership , i just do n't think it 's a good idea to give civilians access to ** everything ** . 
  i do n't like that the police has military gear , but i understand why they would need it . 
  a civilian is much less likely to need it , to the point where i think it 's better they ca n't have it at all . 
  in a perfect world neither would the police , but unfortunately we do n't live in one . 
  you do n't need to jump on the hut . 
  you take 0 dmg falling from silo to the ground . 
   incapable of filling the same role the mp5 did in 1.6 / source ? 
  mp5 had a role in 1.6 ? 
  you can tell it 's silver since he has a bizon on 5th round, 
  you 're also on csgoreddit . 
  most silvers do n't really follow the scene outside the game itself . 
  started mg1 or nova 4 . 
  eagle now . 
  380 wins or so . 
  i did play a lot of 1.6 but i did n't play any fps 's since battlefield 2 so my aim is shit .
