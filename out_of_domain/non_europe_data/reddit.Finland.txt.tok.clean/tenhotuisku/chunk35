  i know i do n't want it upside down . 
  can you at least change it or does apple know better once again ? 
  does this also affect magic mouses ? 
  no , but change for the sake of change is just as bad if not worse . 
  i welcome new features that actually make sense . 
  i do n't really care if it 's natural to you or not , as that 's just an opinion . 
  what i 'd really like to know is this :, 
   can you at least change it to your preference ? 
   does this also affect magic mouses ? 
  i like my privacy . 
  it 's the same as `` if you 're not doing anything illegal , why not just let the cops raid your house . 
  what do you have to hide ? '', 
  also i would n't want my gf reading everything i talk with my friends . 
  there 's way too much room for misunderstanding and it does n't let me control the information at all , which i like to do . 
  well if you can change it then i have no problem with it . 
  i could imagine using this on a trackpad but on a mouse ? 
  wtf, 
  i purchased an imac from apple and received a mouse . 
  would n't that be apple selling mouse input devices . 
  i do n't see any difference between a physical wheel and a touch based one . 
  also , i 'm fine with reverse scroll with devices that actually have a touch screen . 
  it makes sense in an ipad or iphone . 
  it does n't on a computer . 
  i ordered xbox controllers from dealextreme for $ 20 a couple years back . 
  seemed legit and worked just fine . 
   once you upgrade, 
  based on everything i 've seen/heard ( this scrolling thing is the least of my worries ) i 'll be skipping lion, 
  old news is old, 
  most people that know how to use a computer do, 
  circlejerk, 
  it looks pretty crappy to be honest, 
  saved, 
  i recommend you cross-post to [ r/stonerengineering ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/stonerengineering/submit ), 
  i do n't give a shit if they get karma or not , i just want quality content on r/trees, 
  this actually pisses me off without the sarcasm, 
  why did you buy colored duct tape, 
  how is this comment so low, 
  first pic on r/aww today that made me lol, 
  this is the first thing i smoked trees out of except reversed . 
  you keep the bottle horizontal , make a hole for the base and inhale from the regular drinking hole . 
  also a carb on the other side, 
  yes, 
  nah , i do n't mind going against it . 
  i 'd rather say how i feel and lose a few imaginary points that are n't worth anything than conform to the hivemind . 
  i was watching nature documents during my epiphany, 
  i 'm fine with internal or facial as long as it 's a female completion . 
  why the fuck would i want to watch some guy jerk off on a lady . 
  especially when it takes like minutes in some vids . 
  mee too except i jump around a bit more . 
  if something seems `` too good '' ( = best part of the video ) i skip it , watch the rest of the positions and come back to it in the end . 
  words are just words . 
  get over it . 
  should n't this be the other way ? 
  volume does n't break the pipe as long as it 's flowing smoothly and no pressure builds ? 
  i searched with both the url and the group name with no results . 
  whoops . 
  i searched for both the url and `` iluminate '' with no results . 
  obligatory finnfag reporting in . 
  i think i actually know where this was filmed . 
  the camera does n't adjust to light as well as the human eye , it does n't get dark at all for ~ month in the summer ( even longer in lapland ), 
  ama, 
  carthago must be destroyed, 
  either one would be fine, 
  no it does n't . 
  this pic is like a year old . 
   very clear headed, 
  definitely not what i remember . 
  every time i smoke a whole base of resin i 'm fucked up . 
  i agree with the first part but, 
   you do n't like following traffic laws and dislike being made to follow the same rules everyone else does ? 
  hell no i do n't like following `` the same rules every one else does '' , who the fuck does ? 
  one of the best japanese games for xbox360 as well as one of the best 3rd person shooters . 
  i love how there are more boss or boss-like enemies per level than most modern games have total . 
  i 've borrowed my copy to two friends now and they both loved it . 
  i recommend hard , makes it more interesting . 
  this comic makes no sense . 
  what did she lie about ? 
  no , they ** follow ** the rules . 
  liking is a whole other thing . 
  beat me to it, 
   next time you wonder why there are n't many women on reddit , i direct you to this story . 
  next time someone wonders why we do n't want women on reddit , i direct them to this comment, 
  yes it does . 
  i 've never seen an ad on youtube on my computer . 
  also everything up to 1080p starts playing right away smoothly, 
  shit was cash, 
  in my old ipods this was no issue , but my 5th generation nano ( last with scroll , thank god i got it in time ) does n't turn off when on pause and locked . 
  it 's really fucking annoying making sure it 's really off each time . 
  i do n't even understand what drains all the battery if it is n't playing a song and the light is off . 
  yeah !, 
  he should have expected to die for having weed in his pocket !, 
  he was on probation for gods ' sake !,
