  you see these kind of paths everywhere , it 's usually done by bikers . 
  i feel 4.5 '' is a big screen . 
  6 '' is tablet territory . 
  but you are right , it depends a lot on how you use it . 
  though mine ( 4.5 '' ) lies on the desk most of the time and i use it to watch streams and videos etc. 
  and despite that i 'd rather trade to a smaller one than a bigger one . 
  then why is it that every phone site including nokia 's own website says otherwise ? 
  also my phone has an lcd screen and it supports glance . 
  no , they say that the 930 uses amoled while the 1520 uses lcd . 
  while i agree with you that it 's stupid to rate an app based on it working on an unfinished dev os i have to say i 've asked this sub about a dozen of times `` is there a possible downside to 8.1 like some apps not working properly ? '', 
  and ** every single time ** i 've gotten the answer `` no , everything works just fine '' from multiple people . 
  good thing i was sceptic . 
  you do n't need to sugarcoat your answers to make wp seem better , i already own it !, 
  it was n't that bad . 
  the angle made it a bit more difficult but i did get both guesses right . 
  this is far from those street hustlers who do it at 300 % the speed . 
  i was actually more surprised that mt. 
  everest is almost as high as the deepest oceans are deep . 
  oceans can span half around the globe , there 's much more space to work up that decline . 
  i was imagining more of a chant like in a sporting event, 
  it has nothing to do with the panel . 
  glossy screens use the exact same panels but they have an additional panel of glass on top of it . 
  you can actually take it off and make a glossy screen matte . 
  macbook pros used to have matte display as default and you could pay extra for a glossy one ( pre 2006ish ) . 
  then they would make it optional free of charge ( 2006-2009ish ) . 
  now i think they charge you extra for matte :(, 
  glossy monitors do make colors look better but it 's a pretty shitty tradeoff . 
  the reflection, 
  yes it is , especially if you 're in a bright room/the sun is shining . 
  you might be right , i have n't looked at the store in some time . 
  i get if someone chose the mom for hips etc. 
  but the daughter definitely has the better boobs . 
  also she probably has n't given birth so i 'll go with the daughter . 
  you can definitely live to be 115, 
  yeah about 12 months after release was when the first somewhat decent versions came out , so fall of 2013 . 
  cs is n't beating sc2 's numbers . 
  when there is a big tournament in sc2 it 's higher , when there is a big tournament in cs it gets higher . 
  sc2 gets a lot more consistent viewers though with leagues like gsl getting easily 25-35k viewers every time they stream ( which is like every other day ) . 
  there are also a lot more popular sc2 player streams than in cs where summit is really the only big player stream . 
  yeah well i 'm pretty sure you 're either blind or retarded but screen glare definitely does bother 99 % of people with functioning eyes . 
  manual labor , eating habits , war etc. 
  i think there are also more diseases/illnesses that only affect males . 
  depends on the bread . 
  if it 's good quality bakery bread or something like that they 're definitely the best . 
  if it 's some cheap ass white bread like generic toast or something they 're pretty bad . 
  i still like them though but i understand why some people would n't . 
  yeah me too . 
  i played about 20 hours when it was new , decided it was shit , then gave it another go when my friends said it has improved . 
  i 've had my phone for 1,5 years . 
  it has 32gb and no sd slot . 
  i install all kinds of shit , get about 100 + watsapp messages a day with lots of pictures and video with autosave on , take pictures and video video myself etc. 
  i 've never even gone above 50 % usage . 
  i definitely do n't see what the big deal about an sd card is . 
  that 's because they do, 
  so a person with 1.6 experience who buys cs : go for the first time is a smurf ? 
  because i 'd rather warm up at 64 ticks when i know i 'm gon na be playing a match at 64 ticks, 
  you see missile turrets all the time in pro games . 
  1 turret is seeing a missile turret . 
  just because they do n't spam them like noobies does n't mean they do n't use them . 
  i 'd say it 's pretty damn rare to see a tvx match that did go past 10 minutes and missile turrets were n't built . 
   10-15 mutas is n't enough to one shot turrets . 
  and for 100 minerals and an scv repair on your turret , it 's more than enough to take out several mutas . 
  this is the key thing . 
  pros always make turrets against mutas , they just do n't have to make more than 1 or 2 because they have those lightning fast repair reflexes . 
  op is seeing only 1 turret and thinking `` is that because turrets are bad ? '', 
  but in reality it 's because even 1 turret is so good ( with proper control ) . 
  you probably do n't have gm-like reflexes though so building one or two extra is n't going to hurt , at least in later stages in the game . 
   apartment esittely, 
  yeah this is what i expected the joke to be, 
  yeah this sub is for shitty jokes / r/hockey does n't allow . 
  i know , that 's why i 'm on this sub . 
  but i do n't mind their decision to keep the / r/hockey sub reserverd for more `` serious '' discussion . 
  in all honesty it 's still mostly shit talking and joking around , they just do n't allow stuff like memes or posts without actual hockey content . 
  so it 's not like it 's super serious . 
  no , but losing by being too greedy is a pretty common way to die in pro games . 
  or winning by being greedier than your opponent , but not too much . 
  it 's a very thin line . 
  pros try to gain little advantages everywhere they can , that 's why professional starcraft is so interesting to watch because they 're both so good it comes down to tiny decisions . 
  i do n't scan that often either , except in lategame when we 're dancing around looking for engagements . 
  i harass quite a lot with drops and drops give a lot of information . 
  most pro terrans use drop play too for this exact reason . 
  there are n't that many things that need scouting between the time your reaper dies and the first medivac pops . 
  you should be able to see detect early shenanigans with the first reaper scout , quick oracles , 1 base blink , proxies etc. 
  if you drop with your first medivac it 'll tell whether he is going robo or twilight into storm or heavy stargate . 
  of course you can scan , i 'm not saying it 's a bad idea if you want to play extra safe . 
  it 's just possible to skip it and get those mules without that big of a sacrifice . 
  the only thing that he can start after your first reaper scout that hits before the first medivac drop is blink , and i do n't know about you but in hots i play all my tvp 's mentally ( and buildwise ) prepared for blink . 
  i think most people use a pipe or a bong with a little [ plate thingy ] ( http://i888.photobucket.com/albums/ac84/vapemaster/img_2035.jpg ) instead of bowl . 
  you place the dab on the plate and heat it with one of those blowtorch lighters or heat a piece of metal and then touch the dab with that . 
  suck the bong like a regular one and the smoke goes up that inverted bowl looking thing . 
  i 'm sure there are more ways than one , but i think this is the most common . 
  are you the guy who repeatedly called me an asshole for an unknown reason ? 
  e. oh never mind , it seems to be a dbz joke . 
  i have n't watched that show , i liked oz as a kid :p, 
  frankly this is the reason i do n't play dayz . 
  i love the idea , when i first tried the mod in it 's very early stages i realized it was ** the ** zombie game i 've been waiting for all my life . 
  i still like where they went with it designwise , but the gameplay is just inexcusable . 
  playing something like cs : go on 64 tick servers and having inconsistency in the hitboxes is one thing , in dayz what happens on the screen and `` what really happens '' are rarely even remotely close to the same thing . 
  in the modern game industry you 're used to complaining something like `` that 's bullshit , the shot did n't go between his legs , it totally hit his right shin '' and then you have dayz where it 's closer to `` that 's bullshit , i thought i was 5 metres to the right behind a wall and he was 10 metres that way looking the other direction and i shot at him 5 seconds before he turned around yet somehow i got killed first '' . 
  in its current state dayz would probably work better as a tabletop game , that 's the amount of imagination you have to use anyway for it to make any sense .
