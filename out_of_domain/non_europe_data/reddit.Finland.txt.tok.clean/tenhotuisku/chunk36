  moves to reverse cowgirl , then sex against a wall , more cock sucking and then zeina is banged against the other wall followed by a cumshot on her butt whilst she 's standing . 
  the whole thing is filmed in an elevated apartment looking out of a ceiling/floor window with tree 's in the background . 
  [ stream ] ( http://www.pornstarclub.com/galleries/0469/16211/zeina-heart-and-james-deen-fucked.php ), 
  that 's the point . 
  it 's enough to stop even the richest from speeding . 
  i do n't know if this helps but i remember you must be online the first time you try to play it . 
  back then i did n't have a long enough cable so i downloaded the game in one room and tried to play it in another . 
  did n't work . 
  why not ? 
  i rarely have it open , but i do n't see a reason to log out, 
  i always watch my porn on mute . 
  the girls sound like pigs getting slaughtered and i do n't enjoy the men 's moaning either . 
  i have n't seen my gf for 6 days now and no problems . 
  i fucking love san andreas . 
  exactly . 
  the point was n't how much they exactly drove before the battery ran out , i ca n't even remember that . 
  it was about how difficult it is to recharge them ** once ** they run out . 
  is nissan claiming they ca n't possibly run out of battery in the countryside ? 
  yeah but see the point was they drove past dozens of petrol stations during the `` low fuel '' alert but found nowhere to charge the cars and eventually had to push it into a university to recharge for 12 hours . 
  we seriously need more though, 
   but my personal preference is for my heroes to heroically overcome the odds . 
  instead , he loses, 
  not me . 
  i enjoy surprises . 
  i did but did you watch the episode ? 
  the nearest charge point was seventy-something miles away when they had less than ten miles left in the battery . 
  they probably drove in circles just to get a `` dead battery '' reading before charging in the university which was the only place they could find . 
  i agree it 's a bit shifty to intentionally empty the battery but it does n't really change anything but the name of the small town in which they are in trouble . 
   you can similarly let a gas fueled vehicle run low and then run out of fuel in the middle of nowhere and say `` this technology is n't meant to be used in the desert or countryside '' . 
  same thing . 
  no , it is n't . 
  when they got the warning message at ~ 15 miles the nearest recommended charge station was ~ 70 miles away but they kept passing petrol stations all the time . 
  i agree emptying the battery was n't the most subtle way to prove a point but really the only thing that was affected was the name of the small town in which they ran out of battery . 
  the problem that charge points are rare and it takes 12 hours with a regular socket still exists . 
  i do this about once a month . 
  the lights are ridiculous where i live . 
  i have waited minutes in an empty intersection . 
  the reposts are a lot more annoying . 
  you have to open the comments to see the complaints . 
  can you talk on a cell phone yourself , or is the static too loud/obnoxious ? 
   because of the way the world works today, 
  yeah because before the horrible 21st century people used to be so nice if you had a facial disfigurement . 
  they even gave you a job at the circus and you could eat with the pigs for free . 
  or possibly even protect a chest in a dungeon . 
  why are modern people so mean and insensitive ? 
  you can select text but i ca n't seem to find a way to copy text without changing focus . 
  i though it was funny and i 'm not racist , i just know when not to take things too seriously . 
  also gtfo, 
  this is not racism . 
  have you ever watched a comedy show by a black comedian ? 
  the shit most of them say is ten times more `` racist '' than this and i doubt they really hate black people or consider them an inferior race . 
  it 's just a laugh on cultural differences . 
  get over it . 
  nope . 
  dragging either does nothing or starts selecting all the text depending on the application . 
  contextual menu does n't pop up without changing focus . 
  ** edit ** apparently in some applications it does pop up, 
  also adblock plus disables it automatically, 
  but the hivemind wants to get upset !, 
  what 's crackin ' , partner ? 
  i 'm just gon na lay down here and hijack this comment since this link was a bit far down . 
  ** [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jbo5b/most_underrated_novelty_account_on_reddit/c2avdnu?context=3 ) **, 
  blah blah blah, 
  i was n't saying it 's all roses and unicorns now , just that the typical `` how the world works today '' was extremely unnecessary since we 've only progressed in accepting differences . 
  in fact if she/he had just dropped the word `` today '' there would have been nothing wrong with the post, 
  no way jos\u00e9 . 
  i just tried this and two ( 2 ) unnecessary ads popped up . 
  to a man who has n't seen this many ads on a non-porn site for maybe a year it was horrible . 
  also i could n't care less about someone else 's ad revenue . 
  it 's not like the funny pictures will seize to exist if one site goes down and besides reddit is run by a billion dollar company . 
  this is actually very well explained . 
  oh look the local news station just announced that the anonymous hacker group has struck again / facepalm, 
  hah , it 's not like my quarter of a cent revenue will make a difference on a site with millions of viewers and even if it would i 'd rather enjoy my adless reddit for a few years and then switch to a new better site ( which would happen if they started charging for this shit ) . 
  reddit is a website . 
  i enjoy websites without ads . 
  if reddit goes down , there are always other sites . 
  it 's as simple as that , i did n't even bother reading your elaborate example . 
  besides i already pirate all of my entertainment anyway so a few lost cents in ad revenue does n't really mess with my conscience, 
  haha this . 
  i do n't even know why since it 's only one of the dozens of fps shooters i 've played but whenever someone mentions sticky keys i get a rage flashback trying to crouch and getting thrown to the desktop . 
  it was unnecessarily tricky to disable too if i remember correctly . 
  or maybe it was just that i could n't really speak english . 
  soo . . how exactly do you down those pints ? 
  just say europe, 
  well i read it now but it makes no sense . 
  i do n't give a shit if someone else makes 80k or 85k why would i ? 
   you 're a really immoral person if you expect the world to service you without doing ( even a small part ) to give back . 
  yes i am and i 'm loving it . 
  i realize the world would n't work if everyone was like me but gladly they are n't and i can keep exploiting them . 
  have a good day . 
  holy fuck they 're long, 
  my immidiate reaction is also always `` fuck the police '' but i keep my motherfucking mouth shut . 
  and i mean shut , not like `` i wo n't tell you anything about the murder on 5th and 5th street 5/4/2011 '' but like '' -- '' . 
  i have gotten away with a lot of shit too . 
  people should just realize not to incriminate themselves . 
  the detectives are trained to notice irregularities etc in your stories so it 's not difficult . 
  just keep your mouth shut !, 
   there are no articles regarding the negatives of weed , it 's just meme 's and karmawhoring . 
  well see r/trees is n't r/marijuanainformation . 
  in fact we already have r/marijuana , r/cannabis , r/mmj , r/drugs etc where there 's tons of interesting information regarding cannabis .
