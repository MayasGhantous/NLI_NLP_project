  having the recipes page open is a good idea but what else would you need tutorials for ? 
  maybe once you get to redstone etc. 
  but i mean beginner tutorials . 
  step 2 . hide in the hole when you hear scary sounds, 
  you really need a tutorial for that ? 
  yes . 
  but mika and the other guy are n't trying for esea . 
  they did set him up but that 's no excuse . 
  it 's like if your friend told you a house is empty and you break in to find police already inside , it 's still breaking & entering no matter what your friend told you . 
  in the video they made it very clear how with a rifle mouse5 only follows the opponent , you need to press mouse1 to shoot . 
  that 's aimbot , not triggerbot . 
  well yeah but if you 're building this for yourself as a hobby you 're not paying yourself salary . 
  i doubt the materials cost that much .

  not totally new, 
  half and whole hour blocks are a lot more common than everything else though . 
  and when it is n't half-hour it 's still usually 15 minutes or at least always ends with a zero or a 5 . 
  i 've never heard of a show starting at xx :12, 
  because he 's totally pulling that out of his ass . 
  european tv is n't faster or slower . 
  yeah but european tv often has a set of ads between two programs , where as u.s tv starts the next show as soon as the credits start rolling for the last one . 
  it 's actually pretty clever because there is no downtime when `` nothing is on '' so it 's harder to stop watching . 
  they launched fox over here ( finland ) a few years ago and they 're doing the same thing , other channels are still following the old format . 
  only an american would pull the `` freedom of speech '' card when talking about the amount of ads on tv . 
  you people take everything to the principle instead of focusing on the practical aspects . 
  just like this is an issue of `` government ca n't say what is ok to show on tv and ads are just as much speech as anything else !! '', 
  vs `` nobody wants to spend 1/3 of their time watching ads because ads suck '' . 
  you mean no ads at all because important sports events such as the world cup or the olympics are aired on tax-paid networks , right ? 
  finland , i know they do the same in sweden as well . 
  there 's lots of good points there but this line i disagree with . 
   because you have players demanding that games are long , but then you look at the data and see that not even half of those people see even half of the game . 
  there 's clearly something wrong there , right ? 
  70 or 80 per cent of people never finish the game . 
  that 's insanity , right ? 
  i might not finish every game i buy , but i finish the ones i really like . 
  if i buy 3 games and find one of them absolutely great , i 'm hoping it wo n't be too short . 
  someone else might 've bought the same three games and liked another one of them the best so he was glad that one also had a long story . 
  we both only finished 33 % of the games we bought , but we were glad that the one we did finish had a lot of content . 
  i 'd rather get 20 + hours out of the game i really liked and < 5 hours out of the two i did n't care for enough to finish than get 10 hours from each and finish them all . 
  that 's a pretty shitty adblock you 're running then . 
  as you can see from the picture i 'm also using adblock . 
  the shows starting at 18:58 and 20:57 are 2 minutes and 3 minutes long . 
  they are n't real shows . 
  they 're fillers so that the real shows/movies can start at the full hour . 
  urheiluruutu ( sports news ) is just a part of the news , i do n't even understand why they separate then in the scheduling . 
  just like in the morning yle tv2 shows a pikku kakkonen ( kids show with many segments ( imported short cartoons ) ) . 
  it 's listed as 10 different 3-4 minute shows that can start at the oddest times , however the first one starts 6:50 and the last one ends at 8:50 and there are no ads or anything in between so despite looking like crazy in the schedule it 's actually one 2 hour show . 
  so the only legit shows from all of the networks all day that start at a time other xx : x5 or xx : x0 are mcleod which starts 18:02 since there is a quick news segment at six o'clock sharp which is a tradition and boardwalk empire which starts at 00:51 because it 's the second episode in a row and yle likes to show consecutive episodes with no bullshit inbetween like you 're watching a bluray . 
  all the other couple hundred shows today end in a five or a zero . 
  yeah but is n't the `` introduction '' about the first 3-4 minutes of the show ? 
  around that time is when you often see a fade to black/a brief black screen in europe , meaning there was supposed to be ads there . 
  another one is near the 30 minute mark if you 're watching the standard 42ish minute `` hour long '' show . 
  if you check the url it 's google.fi , i 'm not from the states either . 
  actually i tried it on my laptop and it did n't show it either despite having the same os and browser . 
  i checked the most obvious possibility ( screen resolution/browser width ) but that had no effect . 
  so i have no clue . 
  i do n't know , when i lived in the states a few years back i did n't really have much else to do than watch tv and they definitely started the show right after the other , not just an intro . 
  probably depends on the channel too , i mainly watched comedy central , discovery and history channel ( when there were n't any sports on ) . 
  well that was ... awkward, 
  did you even open the site ? 
  no you did n't , because this was on the front page ** current version is 0.55 for windows or for mac . 
  how to play is here . 
  yea same thing in finland . 
  if both are under it 's obviously not a crime ( well , obvious to some ) . 
  here age of consent being 16 technically means a 18 year old ca n't have sex with anyone under 16 , if you 're under 18 you can do whatever the fuck you want as long as it 's consensual . 
  even if one is say 15 and one just turned 18 there 's a case-by-case evaluation if the age / `` maturity '' difference really is that big . 
  so a 40 year old having sex with a 15 year old is n't the same as a 18y old doing it even though they 're both legally adults . 
  i know some people ( especially americans ) do n't like laws like this , but i think it 's like it should be . 
  so you 're obviously the high schooler who hates how everybody around you is so immature !!!, 
  it 's a joke , lighten up . 
  yeah , the high school kids gasping how immature everyone is . 
  yes the screaming added to the humor value and lasted about 3 seconds , what of it ? 
  do you people browse reddit from an old people home during naptime or something , every video that is n't completely silent or monotone in volume gets these `` warnings '' . 
  i was n't talking about that , i was talking about laws/justice system, 
  where things are evaluated `` case by case '' instead of the law being the exact same thing word for word for everybody . 
  actually i thought the whole segment in rikoslaki started with `` an adult who ... '' but on closer inspection it 's not there . 
  i 'm not an expert , i was just talking based on what they taught us at school . 
  but yeah , in practice it 's impossible to get sentenced if you 're 17 . 
  i know a case where a 19 year old had sex with a 15 year old and he did n't get sentenced despite it going to court thanks to her mother . 
  but it is evaluated individually each time ( no precedent system like in the u.s ) so i would n't take my chances . 
  it 's not glass . 
  it 's just a figure of speech .
