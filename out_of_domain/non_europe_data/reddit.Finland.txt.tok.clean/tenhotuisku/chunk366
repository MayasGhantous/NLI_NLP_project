  actually ea has been pretty lenient with the keys to older battlefield games . 
  it 's not a 100 % guarantee but i bet you could get a key if you send a pic of the cover/cd and tell them you 're not able to register it to origin . 
  if they ask just say you 've had it for a long time . 
  i disagree strongly . 
  if i take the time to play a game to max mp lvl , i 'd like to get an achievement/trophy . 
  i do n't really care that much about them , but acknowledging is the least the game could do . 
  i played bfbc2 for like 300 hours before i got to max level and nothing . 
  there 's no unlock or anything ( which is to be expected as unlocks stopped at 25ish and max level was 50 ) but at least they should give you an achievement . 
  i understand that if you 're an `` achievement hunter '' mp achievements might annoy you but achievement hunters should n't be the ones games are primarily designed for . 
  getting to max lvl is `` an achievement '' . 
  you should earn ** an achievement ** for it . 
  i think having an achievement for every significant game action/goal should be the priority , not whether or not it 's easy to get them all quickly . 
  in fact i think people like seriously impaired the idea of achievements as you 've made it so that nothing that takes more effort than a single playthrough can be an achievement , because some people will bitch and whine online how it 's too hard to get . 
  `` kill 10 enemies '' or `` win 5 games '' ? 
  how are those achievements or trophy worthy ? 
  you do n't actually have to work for either one of those as they do n't require any skill or effort from your part . 
  why is it that you prioritize being able to get all the trophies quickly over having trophies for every significant goal you can reach in the game ? 
  the whole idea that `` everyone should be able to get all the trophies '' is beyond ridiculous . 
  an achievement/trophy should be a reward or an aknowledgement that you did something that required either skill or effort . 
  it should be a nice little extra for playing a game , not something you play the game for . 
  if anything trophies should be more difficult across the board so they actually meant something . 
  `` make trophies easier so i can get them all quickly '' ruins the whole point of having achievements . 
  i can make that rule even simpler . 
  do not go after trophies . 
  play the game , enjoy the game , if you did something achievement/trophy worthy you 'll probably get one . 
  they should n't be your motivation , the fun and interesting gameplay should be your motivation . 
  if anything these people whining to make trophies more easier to get/only include the most basic playthrough experience ruin the whole point of achievements , which is to aknowledge that you did something worth mentioning in a game . 
  getting to max mp level is worth mentioning in my mind , so there should be a trophy for that . 
  maybe op is used to special olympics where everyone who attends gets a trophy ? 
  yea but if i play some game 's mp so much that i actually reach max level i 'd like a trophy for that . 
  i think having trophies for every major goal in the game ( max lvl is definitely a goal in any game where there 's any sort of lvls ) is much more important than all the trophies being easy to get . 
  this whole idea that every trophy should be available to everyone even if they do n't play all the content there is to the game is just beyond my comprehension . 
  if you do n't have mp , you can still get all the sp trophies . 
  you know you got them all , be happy . 
  people who do have mp should n't make do without them just because some other guy does n't have internet/doesn ' t like mp . 
  all trophies are already optional . 
  it 's just in your head . 
  if you do n't have mp , earn all the sp trophies . 
  you know you got them , objective reached , congratulations . 
  i really do n't care at all what you do in the privacy of your own home . 
  if you wan na trophy hunt go ahead , i was just giving friendly advice that solves this `` problem '' . 
  but i do have a little problem with people who think trophy/game design should be aimed towards trophy hunters , not the people who play the game for fun and just like having these little reminders for something significant they achieved within the game . 
  for example max mp lvl . 
  there should definitely be a little trophy for doing that in every game that has ranks in mp no matter how trivial or crappy the mp is . 
  if someone took the time to do it , they should be aknowledged for it . 
  especially when the console already has a built-in system for aknowledging reaching different goals within games . 
  the rule of thumb that i used was `` if it 's in my inventory , i can check the wiki what it is '' . 
  i can say that did n't really ruin my first playthrough at all . 
  aside from boss fights the biggest feelings of success were finding where i was supposed to go . 
  i 'd hate to have that taken away from me . 
  not to mention the genuine fear when you encounter an enemy for the first time and have no clue what to do or being on your last estus flask and having no idea whether the bonfire is around the corner or if there 's a dozen more enemies before that . 
  i also recommend trying out all weapons yourself before you find one you like . 
  there 's no scaling so having `` wasted '' points in str or dex does n't really matter . 
  your first character is going to be terrible at pvp anyway . 
  it 's not . 
  that rundown is not `` basic '' in any meaning of the word . 
  basic rundown of scaling :, 
  all weapons have base dmg which always stays the same . 
  in addition to base dmg the weapon dmg output may be affected by one or more of your stats . 
  this is called scaling . 
  the stats that can affect damage are strenght , dexterity , intelligence or faith . 
  a weapon can scale with one or more stats , or it might not scale with any stat . 
  you can check each weapon 's info screen in-game for more details . 
  not only do different weapons scale with different stats , the amount ** how much they scale ** can also vary . 
  these are ranked by the `` japanese alphabet '' of s , a , b , c , d , e where s is the best and e the worst . 
  for example a sword with `` a '' scaling for strenght and `` d '' scaling for faith will strongly rely on your strenght points , while faith only makes a little difference . 
  with this particular sword your dexterity and intelligence wo n't make any difference to the damage . 
   thats what the game wants you to do , get mad . 
  i do n't get mad while playing dark souls . 
  if i get mad at anything it 's myself for being greedy when it was stupid to do so . 
  laggy pvp opponents are the only thing i can think of that could make me mad , but luckily i rarely pvp . 
  the only thing you should look up is the humanity mechanic . 
  other than that i would recommend going in completely blind . 
  sometimes it might be wise to check the wiki when you find an item though , it often tells a lot more than the item descriptions in the game . 
  your starting class only affects your starting stats and equipment . 
  everything in the game is available to all players , provided you have the necessary stats to use it . 
  you might start up as a warrior but end up leveling intelligence , finding a magic wand and becoming a sorcerer . 
  all the starting items for each class can be found within the game as well . 
  no it is n't , master key is great for new players . 
  especially since all the other gifts are crap . 
  i picked master key on my first playthrough , did n't use you-know-what skip and it was very handy . 
  used it to get pine resin , free logan , find depths bonfire easier , get scared by havel etc. 
  there 's even a chance some nice sunbro will come by and kill havel for you , but not without master key . 
  yes but you do n't pick `` multiplayer mode '' from the menu . 
  as long as you 're online ( and have gold ) the single player and the multiplayer are intertwined . 
   have to force yourself, 
  why would you have to ? 
  that 's also often the coldest part of the fridge and many vegetables actually store better in temperatures around 6-8 than the 2-3 . 
  pulling out the whole vegetable rack thing and filling the section with beer is definitely a good idea . 
  i made a low lvl character to help out the influx of newbies . 
  i should be able to connect to anyone anywhere levels 1-23 . 
  if you 're having any trouble send me a msg ( gt : nappalive ) or reply to this one , i 'll see what i can do . 
  despite being such a low lvl this character is plenty strong enough to clear the entire game . 
  i wo n't do your work for you though , i like to make you newbies sweat for those kills :p, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ admit ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ made ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ twink , but after 3 invasions i realized it was actually nowhere as much fun as co-op is , so i just rejoined sunbros . 
  78 sunlight medals and counting !, 
  i spent the last week designing and grinding the perfect sl11 twink , but 4 invasions and 4 one-shots later i realized i lack that certain thing in my brain that makes some people actually get enjoyment out of killing helpless casuls . 
  i guess i do n't like punching babies either . 
  so i rejoined the sunbros , sworn to protect the newbies from people like you . 
  come at me , motherfucker .
