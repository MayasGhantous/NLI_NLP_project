  r/trees is just for fucking around without worries while high . 
  that should n't be so wrong . 
  wait . 
  that sounds like the perfect website . 
  your argument makes no sense . 
  your quality of life increases drastically after you stop caring about shit like `` socially acceptable '' . 
  i recommend you try it . 
  well , it 's funny to me . 
  you can downvote and move on . 
  luckily most of reddit disagrees with you . 
  he is pretty funny though, 
  exactly . 
  fuck all this `` we can never go back from this '' bullshit . 
  op should realize the only thing this comic demonstrates is how her mom is cooler than she is . 
  at least she can joke about sexuality without fear of taboos . 
  i was an exchange student in the u.s and there was a sex ed class . 
  we had this elaborate game with tons of envelopes and lists of people etc. 
  anyway the point was in the end everyone who had had unprotected ** or protected ** sex ** died ** . 
  i pointed this out and got an hour of detention for disrespecting the teacher ( i though i was being polite and correct at least in my wording ) . 
  compare this to the sex ed we had had back in finland four years prior ( american class was for hs sophomores . 
  this was 7th grade ) where we were told that if and when we were to have sex we should do it sober , with a person we cherished ( kinda lost in translation , did n't want to use the word `` love '' as she did n't ) , protected and with the lights on ( :d ) . 
  funny thing is i 've been following these people on fb and a ton of my american friends are pregnant compared to one ( 1 ) girl i know in finland . 
  and she 's 20 . 
  no , there is n't . 
  by saying that there is you are being racist . 
  exactly . 
  it almost ruined the comic for me . 
  nooo . 
  i said a joke was funny because i though it was a funny joke . 
  you said this joke can only be funny if told by a member of a certain race so you are making a distinction based on skin color . 
  you are not treating people equally and without prejudice . 
  i just enjoy the joke no matter what the comedian looks like . 
  yeah i know but . . why not color them the right way !? 
  it 's just as easy !, 
  i mean he 's already using only red and blue already and the comic is clearly strictly a tf2 reference so why 'd he fuck something like that up . 
  i just use a picture of a fake sentry and then have the real sentry around the corner right after my enemies gain a false sense of security . 
   destroying rocks by writing on them, 
  not sure if serious, 
  well maybe it 's just me but i could totally enjoy this view no matter if there was text on that one rock or not . 
  at least for me it 's the landscape that 's beautiful , not an average motherfucking rock . 
  how is the natural beauty of this landscape ruined by some text on one of the dozens of average looking regular rocks that you stand on . 
  the rocks are not the fucking point . 
  yeah well if you ca n't enjoy a nice view just because there is some writing on one rock that really is n't even part of the landscape then maybe it 's you who 's the problem . 
  woah . 
  dude . 
  saved . 
  repost of a repost but upvoting to keep this subreddit alive, 
  nah man , you need to relax and realize that not every single person has the exact needs and wants that you do and the world does n't revolve around you . 
  i for example would laugh if i saw this and it would make me happier than just an `` un-vandalized '' landscape . 
  i realize however that not everyone feels this way , but that 's why i think writing on an ugly rock is ok since it does n't really ruin the scenery for someone else . 
  you know , moderation 'n shit . 
  unless they 're just looking to get offended . 
  and if that 's the case then fuck them . 
  yeah and a downvote for not being funny, 
  and i was n't going to barbeque today . 
  you should try jerking off while high . 
  just a friendly suggestion . 
  the guy took about 3cm x 10cm of space on one rock that was in no way special on the top of a mountain ( or a hill ) that overlooks miles and miles of nature and you are making a problem out of it because he `` ruined everything '' . 
  do you need a hug ? 
  true . 
  it 's pretty much the same as showers ( at least for me ) . 
  i realize this . 
  however i care more about the pleasantness of my browsing experience than someone else 's money . 
  yes , i 'm a dick , i know . 
  well they were n't pop-ups , that was a bad choice of wording . 
  i disabled adblock , refreshed , and two ads * popped up * you know . 
  appeared . 
  i do have seperate pop-up blockers as well though so idk if there truly are some pop-ups in reddit . 
  u.s or finland ? 
  none in the states . 
  in finland we were taught and told we could go ask for one from the nurse but i do n't think anyone ever did . 
  oh my god what a racist, 
  was n't this when the estonian government/city of tallinn/someone wanted to remove a statue that had been erected under russian rule and the russians in estonia went apeshit ? 
  when i go to cnn or bbc i get ** zero ** ads . 
  the same in reddit . 
  this is why i have been using abp ( or originally ab ) for about 6-7 years now and why i find it appalling to browse the internet on anyone else 's computers ( or without abp ) . 
  for me , two banners is n't nothing . 
  but , but he mentioned black people and crime in the same sentence in national television !, 
  and it was live !, 
  truth is no excuse !, 
  like a boss one might say, 
  holy shit . 
  that 's just ... awful . 
  and i heard they even have ads in youtube videos now ( i 've never seen one ) . 
  i really ca n't understand how some people can browse the web without abp . 
  by comparison to what ? 
  how some other site that i do n't go to would look like on someone else 's computer ? 
  why would i compare reddit to that ? 
  yeah this pic became a bit of a meme on finnish sites too , especially after helsingin sanomat published it . 
  u mad nigga ? 
  this full set was actually posted here a while ago and they did n't look as fake in the others . 
  i agree that they do in this pic though but then again i 'm not a big fan of fake tits and even i love those . 
  the one in the middle is definitely lexi belle . 
  do n't know about the sauce or the others . 
   switch seamlessly from playing games to watching tv -- without switching video inputs on your tv . 
  so ... you wait for a checkpoint , save the game , quit the game , go to dashboard , find the tv icon or whatever , check what 's on tv , quit the tv application because nothing 's ever on , go back to dashboard , start the game up again , wait , wait , load , wait , wait and then you can continue playing !, 
  sounds a lot simpler than pausing and pressing the input button on your remote two times . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.myholysmoke.com/home_page.html ) the site he 's talking about, 
  no i 'm not bitching about the option to do this . 
  just pointing out that this does n't sound as * seamless * as they try to advertise it as .
