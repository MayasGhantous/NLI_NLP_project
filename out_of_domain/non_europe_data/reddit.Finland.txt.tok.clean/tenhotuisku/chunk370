  here it 's the one that is/was in every game store and supermarket . 
  i 've only seen pictures of the non-ptd version . 
  if they 're going for realistic arenas i hope they add a picture or a shot of the arena ( from the outside , possibly city on the background ) to the loading screen like nhl2000 had . 
  i learnt florida has palmtrees from playing nhl2000 . 
  yea i 've gotten invaded , though less and less since not many of my bosses are alive . 
  i invade people all the time though . 
  so software in this day and age has to be primarily designed for grandmas using a computer for the first time ? 
  \\  seeing ads on the internet, 
  i do n't know about assumed knowledge but this is like the 10th time i 've seen this on reddit . 
  i do n't think you can expect people to recognize it 's a geoid , but common sense should tell them it 's not planet earth without water . 
  accurate at showing something else, 
  every time i use chrome it shows the message every time i enable fullscreen on youtube . 
  i do n't have alzheimers . 
  yea i 'm talking about the past few days . 
  i just started my character like a week ago . 
  while only losing your job for killing a man seems like a light punishment i do n't think it 's that `` wrong '' . 
  it 's not like you can treat a cop as you would a civilian . 
  a civilian would have no reason to drive after criminals off-road in the dark . 
  as a cop his job demands him to . 
  mistakes do happen and when you ask people to do dangerous stuff ( chase other people ) human errors can have dire consequenses . 
  that being sad i 'm glad he lost his job . 
  he was driving way too fast too close . 
  true , but it 's a rather rare situation for an individual civilian . 
  not something that happens every day like if you 're a policeman . 
  you ca n't say he was killed for driving without a seatbelt . 
  he ran from the police , getting killed in the process . 
  the killing does n't look intentional . 
  if you want to blame someone blame the idiot who decided to run after such a minor crime . 
  so you 're seriously suggesting an average civilian has as many car chases as a police officer ? 
  i do n't doubt every day somewhere in the world there is a civilian that has to chase after someone , but it 's not the same guy every day . 
  having to chase someone even once a year means you probably live in an extremely bad neighbourhood or are just very unlucky . 
  even chasiers etc. 
  that work in high crime areas do n't usually chase people since it 's not worth the risk . 
  most people live their whole lives without having to chase someone . 
  a police officer can face these situations if not daily then at least weekly . 
  and it 's not like they make a choice `` should i run after that guy '' like any civilian could . 
  it 's their job to chase . 
  that 's why it 's so sad . 
  it 's like when a younger brother is cooler than the older brother . 
  they even do their best to be as close to the u.s as possible , without all the good parts . 
  well even better . 
  i 'd say that 's a pretty rare situation for a civilian . 
  i 'm 24 years old and i 've never had to deal with a dangerous situations involving criminals , nor have i been present in a situation where a dangerous criminal had to be dealt with by another civilian . 
  handling dangerous criminals day to day is what police are paid to do . 
  yea . 
  ** a civilian ** . 
  like i said i do n't doubt somewhere out there ** a civilian ** deals with a criminal every day , but it 's not like it happens to ** the same civilian ** all the time like it would happen to a cop . 
  cops are paid to look for such situations and they intentionally go deal with situations like this because it 's their job where as a civilian would do everything they can to avoid dealing with a dangerous criminal . 
  even in a theoretical situation where every civilian would have to deal with a dangerous criminal before reporting it to the police the police would still have to deal with vastly more dangerous criminals as there are always fewer police officers than their are civilians . 
  if we average it out and say every civilian has to deal with a certain number of dangerous people per year , the number would still be [ about 200-500 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_police_officers ) times higher for every police officer . 
  just like with anything the more you do something the more likely you are to fuck it up once . 
  the chances of a police officer accidentally killing a suspect during his career is much higher than that of a civilian who is only put into a similiar situation once or twice in his life . 
  yea this is a very important point when talking about skin colours/appearances . 
  my whole family considers ourselves `` brown-haired '' or even dark brown , but if we go to the mediterranean we 're all categorized as `` scandinavian blondes '' . 
  my sisters get hit on all the time with lines about their beautiful blonde hair which irritates the hell out of them . 
  yea standardized tests does n't mean multiple choice . 
  in fact i was shocked when i moved to the u.s and found out they actually use multiple choice tests in high school . 
  i had heard about them but i always thought the stories were exaggerated for comedic effect . 
  i still laugh at the idea of a multiple choice calculus exam . 
   in august 2005 , while swimming in four feet of water in helm bay , near ketchikan , alaska , a 12-year-old boy named ellis miller was `` bumped '' in the shoulder by a 25-foot transient killer whale . 
  [ 10 ] [ 12 ] the boy was not bitten or injured in any way . 
  the bay is frequented by harbor seals , and it is possible that the whale misidentified him as prey . 
  damn, 
  get good, 
  you must 've not seen many great youtube comments then, 
  you go to jail for driving without a seatbelt ? 
  it is totally possible to knock over jenga pieces like this regardless if this video 's fake or not . 
  we used to practice this all the time as kids , could hit a soccer ball sized target from 20 meters away with decent consistency . 
  and hitting someone accidentally would often cut a wound instead of just bouncing off so they do fly/spin fast . 
  i have no doubt someone who kept practicing it into his adult life could easily knock over jenga pieces . 
  if you 're going the route of `` fuck them lol '' then why the fuck would it matter whether it 's a manager or not ? 
  `` fuck you dude i ai n't giving you my info ... what ? 
  you 've worked here for 4 years and recently got promoted to a manager position ? 
  well i better give my info then , sorry for the inconveniance . '', 
  yeah i 'm playing new vegas for the first time right now . 
  seems like a pretty good game . 
  i have no idea why some people feel it 's necessary to play something the moment it comes out to enjoy it . 
  it 's not like games have had noticeable technological advancements in the last 5 years anyway . 
  i was thinking of buying the first and second game yesterday but my friend told me `` it 's an amazing game , but after getting used to games like dark souls etc. 
  you 're gon na find the combat terrible '' . 
  he said it 's just `` press a button and watch your character do a predetermined combo in an unstoppable animation '' almost like qte 's . 
  other opinions on the matter ? 
  is it worth playing if i actually want quality gameplay to go with the story ? 
  finland has been ranked # 3 behind the u.s and yemen in guns per capita in a lot of studies . 
  old hunting traditions and russia . 
  sadly our media and government is run by the extreme left-wing who are constantly making it more difficult to own a gun . 
  inb4 kokoomus is the biggest party , even kokoomus would be considered left-wing in most of the world . 
  the fact that it represents right-wing in finland only shows how left we truly are . 
   gun politics in switzerland are unique in europe . 
  the vast majority of men between the ages of 20 and 30 are conscripted into the militia and undergo military training , including weapons training . 
  that 's hardly unique . 
  we have conscription in many european countries . 
  i definitely realized a long time ago that as a non-native english speaker dark souls takes me back to my childhood . 
  playing games where i had no clue where to go or what to do but trying to figure it out and advance further . 
  dark souls blind felt exactly the same . 
  that 's probably the biggest reason i fell in love with it . 
  did n't see the game but, 
   it really bothered me that they did n't review and call it back . 
  clearly interference . 
  interference is not a reviewable call .
