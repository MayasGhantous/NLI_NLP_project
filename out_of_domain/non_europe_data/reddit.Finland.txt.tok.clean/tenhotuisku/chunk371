  e. ** 38.4 situations subject to video review - the following situations are subject to review by the video goal judge : **, 
  ( i ) puck crossing the goal line . 
  ( ii ) puck in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged . 
  ( iii ) puck in the net prior to , or after expiration of time at the end of the period . 
  ( iv ) puck directed or batted into the net by a hand or foot . 
  with the use of a foot/skate , was a distinct kicking motion evident ? 
  if so , the apparent goal must be disallowed . 
  a distinct kicking motion is one which , with a pendulum motion , the player propels the puck with his skate into the net . 
  if the video goal judge determines that it was put into the net by an attacking player using a distinct kicking motion , it must be ruled no goal . 
  this would also be true even if the puck , after being kicked , deflects off any other player of either team and then into the net . 
  this is still no goal . 
  see also 49.2 . 
  ( v ) puck deflected directly into the net off an official . 
  ( vi ) puck struck with a high-stick , above the height of the crossbar , by an attacking player prior to entering the goal . 
  the determining factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick . 
  if the puck makes contact with the stick below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal , this goal shall be allowed . 
  ( vii ) to establish the correct time on the official game clock , provided the game time is visible on the video goal judge 's monitors . 
  ( viii ) the video review process shall be permitted to assist the referees in determining the legitimacy of all potential goals ( e.g. 
  to ensure they are `` good hockey goals '' ) . 
  for example ( but not limited to ) , pucks that enter the net by going through the net meshing , pucks that enter the net from underneath the net frame , pucks that enter the net undetected by the referee , etc. 
  peruss appeared out of nowhere . 
  people voted them because they were frustrated with old parties and wanted a way to protest . 
  peruss was caught by surprise and did n't know what to do now that they actually had power so they just stayed in opposition because it 's easier to stay popular when you 're the one complaining about decisions and not actually making them . 
  they are conservative and nationalist but i would n't call them right-wing . 
  more of a populist party for the working class . 
  what the fuck is a check-in pic ? 
   i used to like hockey . 
  then the lockout happened and the rules changed . 
  now all those records set by the greats ( wayne , mario ) are essentially meaningless . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  also it does n't seem your `` love '' for hockey was that deep if something like the records set by players who 've been retired for decades is enough to stop you . 
  yeah the wikipedia article of `` government in finland '' is probably an excellent source for detailed insight on finnish government . 
  especially seeing as how it has about 10 rows of text in total . 
  the finnish government is extremely left-wing . 
  we have left-wing parties like sdp and vasemmistoliitto , and then we have left-wing parties like kokoomus , rkp and vihre\u00e4t . 
  some are more left than others . 
  every country 's parties are only compared to each other , so someone might call a party like kokoomus ** more right-wing than ** sdp for example , and they would be right , but on a global scale they 're all left wing . 
  finnish government is pretty damn close to communist . 
  as close as you can get and still claim to be a western capitalist country . 
  well that 's what i was asking him as well because i do n't get it . 
  the rule changes were made to increase offense and goal scoring . 
  nobody 's still even close to breaking the records of gretzky or sel\u00e4nne etc. 
  because despite the rule changes the game is much more defensive these days and especially goalies have seen the biggest development . 
  i think he 's just grumpy and trying to come up with stupid excuses without much knowledge of the sport . 
  have you ever played jenga ? 
  those pieces slide pretty easily , especially the middle ones . 
  you need about the same amount of force you would need to move a single piece on a table which can easily be achieved with a bottle cap . 
  you do realize finland has the most mass shootings in europe in the last decade despite only having 5 million inhabitants ? 
  breivik single-handedly got norway to take the first spot , but we 've been steadily shooting each other at schools and malls almost yearly . 
  no you ca n't . 
  well so do feet and inches . 
  beats me . 
  only the u.k uses stones . 
  the rest of the world bitches to them just like we do about inches . 
  actually ps/2 is better than usb in this regard . 
  that 's not really what matters though http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keyboard_technology#types, 
  i 've been able to summon/get summoned just fine , just not with gwg people . 
  still the game seems a bit more active than the last few months , probably to regular people coming back to play with gwg people . 
  if i idle with a summon sign i can get like 20-30 summons a day , usually within a minute or two . 
   comedy talk shows are the best way to start a day . 
  nothing personal but after reading this i immidiately knew i would not like you . 
  and i actually listen to radio myself . 
  internet radio with no ads and very specialized genres/playlists but still radio . 
  given the theories ** spoiler spoiler spoiler ** i 've read about the `` chosen undead '' story being just a scam to weed out the strongest of the undead souls to `` fuel '' the flame it does kinda make sense . 
  really when i read that post about the `` conspiracy '' the whole thing started to make much more sense . 
  even little lines of dialogue like andre saying `` neither one of us wants to see you go hollow '' etc. 
  a lot of the characters do seem to care a little too much for your well-being . 
  in an ulterior motive kinda way . 
  or any kind of sorcery . 
  bfbc2 best bf, 
  what 's the point of having a cs : go community like this if not to post gameplay `` achievements '' you 're proud of ? 
  whenever i look at this sub there 's like 10 aces out of 50 posts per page , and all of them have shit tons of downvotes . 
  i do n't get it . 
  what else are you expecting to see here ? 
  update notes maybe but the game does n't update every day . 
  no but everyone is talking about a prophecy of ** the ** chosen undead while the theory is that it or * you * are a common occurence . 
  the entirety of lodran is just an obstacle course to test the candidates . 
  for all you know the guy you fight at the end , `` gwyn '' is just the chosen undead from last month . 
  yeah lore told to you by the people of lodran, 
  so if you do n't care about other people playing the game why are you here ? 
  yeah i have the complete collection with all the dlc though i still have n't entered any of them . 
  actually right now i 'm wondering whether i should just start the game from beginning with hc mode . 
  right off the beginning caesar 's people hated me because i accidentally aggroed a few people and kept killing the assassins they sent after me . 
  a while later i was invited to caesar 's camp for the first time and he kept being a dick to me before returning my weapons for some reason so i just killed him and all his followers . 
  the game feels kinda silly now that caesar 's dead but most of the quests are still about defending against his attack . 
  i wanted to try hc anyway ( maybe as a 2nd playthrough originally ) but this makes me kinda not even want to finish the game before restarting . 
   the lesson is to never be on social media sites . 
  ftfy * tips fedora *, 
   an un-bannable 360 that can play backups online might be worth more than $ 500 . 
  lol . 
  not . 
  it costs about 50 $ including shipping to get your xbox to play `` backups '' . 
  source : had a 360 that was able to play burned games . 
  played hundreds of hours online with it ( both legitimate and burned games ) . 
  still not banned . 
  jtag is the one that gets you banned . 
  the people who work for sony are no different from the `` hackers '' except they 're paid to a monthly wage for what they do . 
  some probably do both , one being a hobby for free-time . 
  so yes , they probably would 've got there . 
  it 's just a question of man-hours .
