  yea i have n't purchased a single cd published by sony bmg since 2007 . 
  to be fair i have n't purchased a cd published by anyone since ~ 2002 . 
  yea i gave mine to a neighbour after i would 've had to redo the flashing thanks to some changes in copy protection . 
  it can still play burnt games that came out before the summer of 2012ish but if i wanted to play newer ( burnt ) games i 'd have to hook it up to my pc again and redo it with a newer patch . 
  so i just gave it away since i have another ( non-modded ) 360 anyway . 
  it was amazing when i was 18-20 to be able to try out ** everything ** that came out . 
  these days i can easily afford everything i have time to play anyway . 
  i 'm actually so much behind in games i only buy the `` goty complete edition '' versions with all the dlc for less than 20 $ . 
  yeah i 'm kind of a newbie to fallout games so i just started without it , but i keep thinking i 'd enjoy the game much more with it . 
  i often play a lot of games on hardcore mode/hard difficulty and enjoy challenging games overall . 
  i think i will restart right now . 
  usually everything up to o&s . i just play the game and go after stuff i want or need and keep a sign down wherever i go . 
  it sucks with time too , there just is n't a better well known alternative . 
  have you ever done math with time ? 
  it 's fucking terrible . 
  you ca n't make statements like that off a single preference ? 
  also one thing i did n't even realize during my first playthrough was that i was given all this dlc bullshit right off the start . 
  i love dlc that adds weapons and items to games , but it should n't be donated to you at the start of the game . 
  so this time i dropped [ everything ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/courier%27s_stash ) i was given right at doc 's house . 
  too bad from what i understand they 're unique and ca n't be purchased elsewhere . 
  but it does feel a lot better starting an adventure with a 9mm and a jumpsuit instead of a metal armor suit , a grenade launcher etc. 
  yeah . 
  [ the metric system is a lot of work for little added value . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ohjfvgq.gif ) just tell that to any engineer , scientist , doctor or simply any sane person . 
   i dont understand why any country gives two fucks about the measurements used in another . 
  eh , have you heard about globalization ? 
  the internet ? 
  international business ? 
  we probably do n't live in the same country yet i still have to listen to your brainfarts . 
   and the worst part is everyone thinks their version is superior . 
  nobody thinks imperial is superior . 
  even americans just say `` metric is not worth learning '' , they do n't try to argue inches and feet actually make more sense . 
  yeah that canteen message kept popping up in softcore and mainly kept reminding me that there is a hc mode where you have to keep yourself hydrated . 
  i figured you 'd have to keep refilling it in hc mode which would make sense but turns out it 's bottomless so i just dropped it . 
  the only item i kept from the dlcs are the binoculars . 
  i think they 're cool and they do n't really give you an unfair advantage . 
  that mirror thing also has to do with moving image vs. a still picture . 
  if you think you look ugly in a photograph chances are mirroring it wo n't make a difference . 
  who cares ? 
  i 'm sure it provides a service for somebody . 
  typical hive mind, 
  yeah or just turn both off http://gifwall.net/gif/kanyedoucheformation.gif, 
  i opened it in res and was like `` you ca n't fool my night mode filthy peasant '', 
  to be fair she probably did do this for attention . 
  not hating though , pretty shitty pic but looks like a well done costume . 
  she deserves the attention she got . 
  calm down kiddo, 
  maybe it 's just my subreddits but i 've been here nearly 4 years and i 've always seen more dog pictures than cat pictures . 
  in fact i think i 've seen more pictures making fun of reddit for liking cats than i 've seen actual cat pictures . 
   pretty damn close to communist, 
   you think finland is communist, 
   and you think the gun causes mass shootings, 
  i did n't say that . 
  you were just saying how scandinavia does n't have problems despite guns . 
  we do have problems . 
  in finland the age to drink at bars is 18 but almost every bar in helsinki is 20 , 22 or even 24 at weekends . 
  if you 're a hot chick or it 's simply quiet they still let in 18 year olds though as that 's the only legal limit . 
  and you know what ? 
  fallout new vegas is amazing, 
  it 's not about money . 
  it 's about old people in power thinking we do n't want to upset russia because we export a shit ton of stuff there . 
  and import . 
  so it is about money , but not the nato fees . 
  no , but i do n't blame you if it 's some 9 minute long edit that actually starts at 3 or 4 minutes in . 
  especially once your opponents get planes . 
  fuck bomber animations . 
  yeah except you end up turning the setting to `` continents '' and never change it because all the other 9000 alternatives suck dick . 
  it 's kinda sad that as an adult you still base your life philosophies on motivational posters from elementary school . 
  yeah you assumed they were a complete dickshit ... and then you picked it up . 
   if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear . 
  i have never heard or seen this used other than sarcastically . 
  in exactly the way kafka intended it to be used . 
  read the comment section of any article in any newspaper . 
  you 're more likely than not to find a `` as a mother '' comment . 
  yeah because talking about marijuana on a subreddit dedicated to marijuana is * bragging * . 
  there 's a reason reddit is divided to subreddits . 
  if you 're not interested on a subject you do n't have to subscribe to it . 
  the only reason i ever listened to that song was because it 's lil jon saying it . 
  you underestimate lil jon 's power . 
  yeah location and media habits probably do have an affect . 
  this saying ( in finnish , the quote from the translated book ) is actually quite often used here in finland , but i 've only heard it used as a sarcastic remark or a reminder of the origin of the quote . 
  if you look up any article about police powers or wire tapping etc. 
  from finnish newspapers you 're likely to find this up in the comment section . 
  often with a '' ... , right ? '', 
  or something at the end . 
  i ca n't even imagine someone using this `` seriously '' to defend their case since it is such a well known quote . 
  the newspapers would tear them apart . 
  it 's like quoting hitler or something . 
  whats wrong with posting a pic of your bong or bud ? 
  yea but you 're the one automatically calling it `` bragging '' because it 's illegal . 
  it 's wrong to have a civil discussion about a subject on an internet forum dedicated to that subject ... because it 's illegal ? 
  fucking incredible ? 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , just that i do n't get what you 're talking about . 
  i did n't watch it live and i 'm trying to go through all the information and so far there has been ** absolutely nothing ** noteworthy . 
  gta5 is the biggest news , and most of us played gta5 a year ago already . 
  well yeah i did n't say all the games looked bad but i was just as excited for fc4 after playing fc3 and hearing there 's a sequel than i was after seeing that video in e3 . 
  it did n't really bring anything new to the table . 
  was today the day you realized for the first time that `` silent films '' were n't actually silent ? 
  did you imagine a room full of people in total silence watching a movie for 90 minutes ? 
  maybe you should find better people to start a relationship with .
