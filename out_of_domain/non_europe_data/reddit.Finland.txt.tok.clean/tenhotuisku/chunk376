  i did n't know it was the doll that made the painting suck you in , but it worked . 
  the vote counts should be your last tool for deciding what is interesting and what is banter . 
  have n't you noticed yet that the highest upvoted threads are almost always puns and jokes while the intellectual content is much lower ? 
  there 's a difference between the `` suspension of disbelief '' required to include things like magic in a game , and the total loss of immersion caused by a world that is n't believable . 
  dark souls 1 has a painting that sucks you into a magic snow world . 
  does it fit the game world ? 
  yes . 
  dark souls 2 has an elevator that breaks the seamlessness between areas and transports you to an area that you saw with your own eyes ca n't be there . 
  does it fit the game world ? 
   did i get the copy of das2 that was n't directed by someone competent ? 
  yes , as did anyone else who bought the game ^ 3 ^ edgy ^ 5 ^ me, 
  yeah having spent my childhood and part of teens with dogs around i can totally see how they could help with depression . 
  too bad i 'm too fucking broke to afford one . 
  well actually according to my mother she put the box inside a crib . 
  but that was just because apparently i liked the box more than i liked the crib . 
  i 'd assume if you do n't have a crib you put it on the floor . 
  you 're supposed to stuff some cloth or towels etc. 
  ( edit . 
  the box also comes with a [ small mattress ] ( http://www.kela.fi/web/en/maternitypackage ) ) in it anyway to make it soft so that should keep the cold away . 
  it 's not like the baby sleeps in an empty cardboard box . 
  yeah this is only about the tenth time i 've seen finnish baby boxes on the front page . 
  oh yeah i 'm definitely not an expert so do n't go stuffing your boxes following my advice . 
  i know you 're not supposed to give babies pillows since they might suffocate on them but i assume soft towels under the flat mattress would be fine . 
  zoos in the western world actually do a lot more good than bad . 
  almost every animal you see at a zoo is either born in a zoo or found hurt and patched up . 
  they serve as rehabilitation clinics as well as help breed baby animals for many endangered species . 
  i did n't know homeless existed until i was like 14 :(, 
  there 's no politics here . 
  the point of that sentence is this box was introduced around the time in the history of our nation when we got our shit together and stopped living like savages . 
  outside the upper class it was n't that common to see a doctor up until then . 
  to get this box you had to see a doctor , so the box helped with infant mortality rates even more than what the box itself does . 
  the box is what made it a standard procedure for expecting mothers to get checked at a doctor . 
  also calling finland a welfare state is n't a political statement . 
  it 's a [ fact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model ) . 
  that 's actually very interesting . 
  thanks, 
  you can see some historical statistics [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate ) but you ca n't really compare mortality rates of say finland and its neighbours . 
  finland 's situation was very different from that in sweden or denmark for example as it was still a relatively young nation in 1938 . 
  most importantly finland fought heavily in ww2 ** and ** had to pay russia war reparations . 
  so as finland 's situation was rather unique in europe you ca n't compare the rates with another nation and say `` this is because of the box '' . 
  there were a lot of other factors . 
  the box did wonders for finland 's ** own ** mortality rate . 
  the article is n't comparing it with anyone else as infant mortality rate is no longer an issue in any developed nation . 
  it 's only mentioned because the drop in infant mortality rate was extremely fast once the box was introduced in 1938 . 
  as the article states this program has been in effect since 1938, 
  it 's not a new thing implemented to fight population decline . 
   inhaling paper/cardboard/glue mixture all day, 
  i 'm not sure if you 're trolling or just genuinely crazy . 
  def jam fight for ny counts as mma and that game was way better than any ea ufc title . 
  actually the term gets used quite a lot outside u.s. not even translated , just the english term thrown into speech . 
  but i 've never heard it used in this context , only as a response to invitations to a party/a movie/a restaurant etc. 
  it 's not like there 's any need for distinction in most european countries either . 
  it 's just the correct puncuation to use when showing a price . 
   in europe where you may see 5 currencies ina morning, 
  no you would n't . 
  you 'd only see one currency per country and these days with the euro you could travel to 20 different countries and still only use one currency . 
  the reason americans leave it out is purely psychological and has to do with how people see money etc. 
  their likelihood to spend money . 
  it 's got nothing to do with the `` need for distinction '' in other countries or the lack of it in u.s. 
  no , they did n't . 
  oh yeah i 've definitely seen restaurant menus like that too ( in both europe and us ) but that 's a bit different as they do n't show cents either so it 's like `` 32 '' or `` 32 , - '' instead of `` 31.95 '' with no currency sign . 
  also restaurant menus tend to be highly stylized compared to a toy store catalog . 
  because it 's much more entertaining than a boring season to find out `` who 's really the best '' ? 
  it 's a lot more boring than a season and playoffs, 
  well i had jumped off the elevator many times since there was obviously a ledge there and there was treasure under the elevator so i expected to find some loot there . 
  the next jump was just trial and error after spotting a drop on the roof next to it and the stairs leading to it which made it pretty obvious there is a way to get up there . 
  the crow had transported you before , so chances are if there 's an option to `` curl like a ball '' in its nest it was going to teleport you somewhere . 
  i did n't know it was going to be the asylum . 
  e. i had played the game almost 100 hours at this point , and once you 've learned to deal with no objective markers etc. 
  you understand that studying your surroundings is key . 
  you can see the drop ( undead asylum f2 west key ) from the ledge next to the elevator . 
  after running around for a while it became clear that the only way to get on that roof was to find a way to get on the structure next to it . 
  so finding the nest was just a bonus . 
  just because it was n't necessarily planned does n't mean google pr department is n't loving it . 
   google 's public image people probably have higher priorities than something like this . 
  higher priorities than getting a post showing google 's hr policies in a good light to the top of the front page of one of the biggest sites on the internet ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's only a few hours old and already has over a quarter million views , all completely free advertising/pr . 
  am i the only one who can see the vegetation in the original pic ? 
  there are no trees that look like that , it 's obviously some sort of grass . 
  the scale is about the same as i 'd guess . 
  i do n't knock anything until i try it . 
  which is why i will never watch a second on mlg.tv again . 
  twitch has really good mobile apps for every platform . 
  so it 's both `` uuggh not twitch '' as well as `` uughh mlg '' . 
  twitch is great . 
  3.01 am right now in finland . 
  looks pretty much just like the pic . 
  it 's not . 
  in posts . 
  you can see the percentage and the percentage actually means something . 
  in comments it sucks because you ca n't see the difference between +1 | -0 , +5 | -4 and +2568 | -2567, 
  he really does . 
  i remember seeing the original gameheart `` release '' / `` pre-release '' post on this sub . 
  i thought it looked great but figured it was just one of those things that the community gets excited about for a week and never sees any actual use . 
  i was very surprised ( positively ) when they actually started using it in korea . 
  this is almost as big of a surprise . 
  i can see this is a new thread ( comments only 1-2 hours old ) because you have n't been hit by the rainbows and sunshine downvote brigade yet . 
  yeah because everyone with a job history has worked retail . 
  but it was a pretty good burn nevertheless .
