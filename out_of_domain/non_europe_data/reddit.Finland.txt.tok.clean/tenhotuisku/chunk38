  and i 'd never pay for a dvr ( or any sort of tv ) service myself so i do n't really care if it exists or not . 
  i could n't do a blank search , but searching for `` diamond '' and arranging them by price i found a ring priced $ 6,998.00, 
  a real man does n't need anybody, 
  i ca n't say i have but i remember it was on one of those `` real girlfriends '' or `` pics of ex 's '' or some shit like that . 
  i do n't even know if that was the sauce but there were more pics . 
  tineyeing it just turned out a ton of useless porn blogs . 
  this is pretty much the only thing i cared about when opening the comments and then when you actually give an honest answer you get ... downvoted ? 
  i do n't know what that is but seeing my nationality mentioned on the interwebs i have no other option but to upvote . 
  and healthy looking too, 
  it 's kinda weird how up here in the nordic countires ( finland particularly ) the last two summers have been hotter and sunnier than ever when to my understanding the rest of europe has had rainy and especially cold weather . 
  well it 's been way , way too hot if you ask me so i 'd gladly trade places . 
  [ another map ] ( http://www.popvssoda.com/images/bigdrawn.gif ), 
  hey everybody !, 
  this man is a manly men 's men !, 
  he does n't take any shit from nobody !, 
  you have much to learn , my young padawan, 
  i have no idea what happened here, 
  whoops sorry . 
  other subreddits often encourage people to post from the original source so i did n't bother reuploading it . 
  the resolution was just a mistake . 
  but no , i do n't care enough to resubmit , you can blame yourselves for lack of content . 
  lol it took me so long trying to figure out what this comic was about . 
  see where i live if you have a real bad case of ( tree-related ) red eyes we call them `` raptors '' . 
  idk why or if raptors had scary red eyes but yeah , mind fucked [ 6 ], 
  not sure if just a shark joke, 
  or a pun about op being finnish, 
  i do n't care enough to discuss either . 
  i was trying to post something i though might interest some other map enthusiasts but hey , i can live without it too . 
  well that pretty much summed it up . 
  i wo n't argue about weed 's cancerousness either way , but the paper and possible tobacco you smoke it with does . 
  also there are carsinogens in everything that burns . 
  you mind sharing where you got this from ? 
  only on r/trees is an internet bot a `` robot '' :d, 
  that being said i upvoted, 
   there has never been a recorded case of death by marijuana overdose . 
  i 'm sure plenty of people have died while stoned . 
  yeah but when talking about substances and their lethality ( especially a passivating one like cannabis ) overdoses/directly related causes are what matter , not if a piano fell on you while high . 
  you could argue sobriety is the worst because tons of people die sober every day . 
  exactly . 
  and even then i think 6 is more likely an underestimation than exaggeration . 
  sure in six flags you wo n't die , but there are all sorts of unregulated , low-maintenance amusement parks all around the world . 
  do n't know about you but i would n't get on an old soviet roller coaster or that north korean one that someone posted pics of some time ago . 
  no offense towards anybody . 
  there was this motivational speaker or something that came to our school and we all had to listen to him in the gym . 
  first he spoke about dui 's and the victims etc which was all cool but then the topic changed to safe sex . 
  he told the whole school with a straight face that condoms have a ** proven rate of failure of over 75 % **, 
  now i 'm no expert but everywhere else i 've heard 1-5 % and even then failures are usually caused by incorrect use . 
  want to guess what happened when i raised my arm for a question and said this ? 
  yes , detention . 
  and what most of the kids probably got out of the presentation was `` do n't bother using a condom '' . 
  well you should be pretty safe then . 
  i personally do n't like vaporizers and prefer mixing tobacco in when smoking so i guess i 'm fucked . 
  no there are n't . 
  well you could argue that it 's easier to clean but it takes like 2 seconds to clean an uncut one and we do n't live in the desert anymore so it 's not really a good trade for having your dick desensitized . 
  the only reason it 's practiced is ( religious ) tradition . 
  personally i think it 's mutilation and should be outlawed but hey , we 're men . 
  it 's not like anybody cares about our rights . 
  for the record i think you should be able to do anything to your own dick . 
  your 2-month old son 's penis is a whole other ball game . 
  no but see it 's not about how long you can last , that 's the least of my worries . 
  it drastically dercreases the sensitivity of the somatosensory ( touch ) sensors that are located in your penis . 
  meaning you feel less . 
  meaning you wo n't gain as much pleasure as you would with an uncircumsiced penis . 
  instead of being protected for special occasions the tip of your dick is always out , rubbing constantly against underwear , pants etc material that overtime causes desentization . 
  that 's the point . 
  i consider myself lucky not having been upbrought in the united states . 
  no offense . 
  seriously . 
  are you trolling or just did n't get the point ? 
  i think i was pretty clear that if you got to a freak accident while high , it does n't mean it was the durg 's fault whatsoever . 
  it 's herpes . 
  not `` most std 's '' . 
  also it was ** one study ** that found this after which it was reported everywhere . 
  mostly because people are desperate to find defences for genital mutilation . 
  i would have wanted to upvote for the funny comic but the ridiculous title forced me to downvote . 
  i would n't call it dangerous but yes , one of the main reasons if not the main reason religions based on the old testament practice circumsition is because those people lived on the desert and apparently had problems with their genital hygiene . 
  same thing with pork . 
  it was difficult to store and cook without getting spoiled/parasites/maggots etc. 
  so they banned it and said it was god 's will . 
  you know to protect people . 
  [ ] ( / perfect ), 
  actually it has been proven . 
  also it follows the same logic every single part of your body 's somatosensory sensors do , so why would your dick suddenly be different ? 
  besides even if hypothetically they proved that circumsized penises are as sensitive as a regular one that would be no justification for mutilation . 
  you could brand your kid in the face with a hot iron and i do n't believe it would affect any of his bodily functions . 
  child mutilation without clear advantages should be considered wrong by default . 
  a 50-50 `` it wo n't hurt him too much '' is n't enough . 
  the desentization wo n't happen overnight and will surely keep on happening . 
  the `` aesthetic '' reasons only exist in countries where circumsision is thought of as normal . 
  where i live girls would be weirded out by a cut dick so it goes both ways . 
  | even though the cleaning is n't that difficult , it is still just one more step in your day . 
  so you do n't wash your dick at all ? 
  it really is n't a cleaning progress on an uncut either , it 's like applying soap in your underarms . 
  i agree that the downsides to circumsizion are n't huge , but like i stated in another comment a simple `` it does n't do more harm than good '' is n't a good enough reason for child mutilation in my mind . 
  no arguments here . 
  it 's just sad that they had to use the one excuse or tool that apparently works on people long after the original context was forgotten . 
  damn it 's long, 
  it should be common knowledge though , i must read it, 
  but it 's sooooo looooong, 
  yeah , and you have to remember scientists are people ( and men ) too .
