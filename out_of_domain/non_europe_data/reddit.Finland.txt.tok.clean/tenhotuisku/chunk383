  grabbed it , thanks / u/pinhead28, 
  1.6 was the update that introduced steam . 
  shortly after that they just dropped the `` 1.6 '' and started calling it simply counter-strike . 
  because of steam they could push updates to users so they no longer bothered labeling them either . 
  before that we had cs 1.5 , 1.4 , 1.3 , 1.0 , beta 7 , beta 6 , beta 4 etc. 
  and the user would have to download the latest update themselves and make sure to keep the game up to date which is why it was important to have a clear numbering system . 
  it 's not . 
  punching and shoving is . 
  but headbutting is still in that range of acceptable , that 's why i said `` somewhat normal '' . 
  if you were to draw a line headbutting lands on the same side as punching , where as biting does not . 
  i do n't know . 
  hockey will always be my # 1 sport and football 2nd so throwing punches seems a lot more reasonable to me too . 
  i guess when you spend your entire life trying to avoid using your hands it translates over to fights as well . 
  probably subconscious . 
  i played sims 1 and sims 2 like crazy and never tried any of the cheats . 
  i never intentionally killed my sims either . 
  i feel kinda awkward when i see the monthly `` dae drowning their sims in puddles of their own piss inside a maze with a pool they ca n't exit '' post . 
  but it does make me feel mentally stable for once . 
  `` poke , poke , poke , is that all you do ? '', 
  was one of the first longer sentences after `` my name is . . '' etc. 
  that i learnt . 
  for anyone else wondering [ he 's not a sketch comedy character ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jorge_jos%c3%a9_emiliano_dos_santos ), 
  for a whole year ? 
  do you have a source , i googled a few resulsts and none of them mention lenght of the suspension . 
  yeah but bf2 had n't sold 11 million copies before it was released . 
  bf2 is what made the franchise big . 
  we were talking about sequels released after the series already got immensely popular . 
  1942 and vietnam had n't sold enough that you could just slap on the name `` battlefield '' and half-ass the development . 
  for all we know he said that to boost the sales of his controversial book . 
  words said a year later should n't affect the punishment . 
  like you said , it 's ** a reckless tackle ** . 
  the reckless part is what warrants the suspension , tackling is fine . 
  there is no way to bite a player clean . 
  it has no place in the game . 
  keane 's tackle could 've landed cleanly but because it was reckless it did n't . 
  that 's the difference . 
  no , i 'm not irish and do n't have feelings towards or against manu . 
  do n't really care about pl but if i had to choose i 'd say liverpool . 
  like i said , something said a year later in a book should n't factor into the punishment . 
  it 's a publicity stunt if anything . 
  and why are you so fixated on injuries ? 
  suarez has n't injured anyone so that does n't really factor into here . 
  the idea and principle of tackling is fine , it 's the execution of this particular tackle that went wrong . 
  the idea and principle of biting a player is unacceptable regardless of the execution . 
  do n't you see the difference ? 
  because in the sport of football biting someone is much , much worse than breaking a leg . 
  clean tackles can break legs . 
  legs can break on accident . 
  you can break your own leg or your teammates leg if you 're not careful . 
  you do n't bite anyone on accident . 
  using your mouth is n't a part of football , using your legs is . 
  according to a book written a year later . 
  that 's not something that should factor into the decision . 
  do you realize how much free advertisement the `` in his latest book keane admits his tackle was intentional '' got ? 
  in fact it 's better than anything money can buy . 
  it 's shown as news , not during commercial breaks . 
  i 'm not saying that with 100 % absolute certainty it is . 
  but it very well could be . 
  that 's why you let what happens off the field stay off the field and make decisions based on what happens on the field . 
  it 's a reckless tackle worthy of a suspension , nothing more , nothing less . 
  the sprites do n't look too off either, 
  i do n't know what you want me to say . 
  from my very first comment i always said it was a dirty tackle and worthy of suspension . 
  i simply said it 's not ** comparable ** to this because they 're totally different situations . 
   the idea and principle of tackling is fine , it 's the execution of this particular tackle that went wrong . 
   the idea and principle of biting a player is unacceptable regardless of the execution . 
  in suarez 's situation were not debating whether there was intent to injure or if it was intentional . 
  those were the two biggest questions in keane 's case , here neither one of them is relevant . 
  they 're two totally different types of fouls , not comparable . 
  so you did n't even bother reading the article ? 
  because i did , both before i asked my question and after you linked it . 
  no mention of the lenght . 
  looking at it multiple it times it looks more likely to be intentional than not . 
  but this is what we were talking about http://www.reddit.com/r/worldcup/comments/28zdjg/suarez_bites_again/cigaiz8?context=4, 
   of course the keane incident is comparable . 
  it 's a totally different type of foul and a different situation . 
  it 's not comparable . 
  haha well it did look pretty sarcastic . 
  i 'll change my vote if that makes you feel any better . 
  no lag for me , maybe the problem 's on your end ( it is ) . 
  i 'm sure i 'm not the only hockey fan who thought `` what the fuck is a football power play ? '', 
  better internet, 
  better hardware, 
  better software, 
  the article has been updated and now uses the word `` photo '' . 
  but pre-sliced bread sucks dick compared to real bread . 
  what am i missing here ? 
  what 's the point of rainbow road if it does n't make you angry ? 
  if you just use your hands or use chalk each shot varies a little bit because how sweaty your hand is ( everyone 's hand is a little bit sweaty even if you do n't notice it ) and the friction irritating the skin and the chalk wearing off etc. 
  the glove helps provide a consistent feel . 
  i did it myself about 15 minutes after the update . 
  could n't stand the ? 
  yeah in finland it 's a tip, 
  or `` tipsi '', 
  he ca n't attend a stadium for 4 months , but after the 4 months he can play in a friendly even if his 9 game ban is n't over . 
   again , still ridiculously little for a third offense . 
  what a tosser . 
  i think 4 months is fine . 
  i was hoping for a year but this is at least a stand by the fifa , they could 've just banned him for the remainder of the world cup without any sort of an outrage . 
  seems about right,
