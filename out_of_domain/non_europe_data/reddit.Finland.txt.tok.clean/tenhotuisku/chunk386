  i feel like the generic title and box art are part of the `` thing '' but really they should n't have done it because in reality it 's gon na put off a lot of potential buyers . 
  also the gunplay was shit , and i did n't really like how they ( ** spoiler ** ^ ^ ^ ish ) forced the bad `` decisions '' on you . 
  it 's actually physically impossible to not do that thing . 
  then the game spends 5 hours blaming you for doing it when the game did n't give you a choice in the first place ( the game wo n't advance until you , you know ) . 
  i know some people say `` you can turn it off '' but that 's a shitty excuse in my mind . 
  still i liked the plot , overall 3,5 / 5 would recommend for less than $ 20 . 
  except it 's kinda ruined by the fact that you 're forced to do it, 
  ** spoiler **, 
  i remember spotting the group of people before the apc , though i thought they were soldiers first . 
  tried aiming there but i could n't . 
  during my time trying to aim i realized they did n't look anything like soldiers so i tried to blow up the apc by hitting the front of it where the civilians would n't get hit . 
  does n't work . 
  i tried everything ( like 10 different shots ) and the game basically stopped until i gave up and fired into the middle of them . 
  later i checked it online , there 's no way to avoid it . 
  you have to kill them . 
  you also have to use the phosphorus , if you try to clear that section with guns the enemies take infinite bullets . 
  so it 's kinda shit that the game makes you do it , then blames you for it . 
  still a good plot overall , there 's a lot more to it than white phosphorus . 
  not a game i 'd play a second time . 
  good plot , but the gunplay was pretty terrible and the controls even worse . 
  i only endured the gameplay to advance in the plot . 
   books are easier and cheaper than technology . 
  not really . 
  a netbook can be around 200 $ and you gain access to all the information of the internet . 
  you 'd have to buy a shit ton of books to match that amount of knowledge . 
  not to mention the storage and carrying around thousands of books . 
  does n't sound easy or cheap . 
   so what if they were the only option ? 
  it still works does n't it ? 
  you 're saying books are better than the internet because they were used for 500 years . 
  i 'm not saying books do n't work , in fact nobody in this thread is . 
  we 're saying they both work . 
  fifa is one of the most corrupted organizations in the world . 
  however it 's got absolutely nothing to do with that one minute . 
  extra times rarely get more that one minute . 
  after two hours the players are extremely tired and injuries occur more frequently . 
  think of it like this : 2 minutes of extra time for a 15 minute period is the equivalent of 6 minutes of overtime for a regular half . 
  it 's ** extremely ** rare to see 6 minutes added . 
  if anything fifa wanted u.s. to win . 
  it 's a huge market and fifa cares about nothing but money . 
  1 minute of extra time is the norm for overtime . 
  the `` 4 '' announcement was something espn made up by themselves . 
  it was never visible on the international broadcast with the original graphics straight from brazil . 
  i checked the vod myself . 
  it was always 5 . 
  fifa is corrupt as hell but that 's got nothing to do with anything . 
  if fifa actually had any influence on the score usa would advance to the finals . 
  it 's a huge market with lots of money that 's going to waste . 
  there 's nothing fifa loves more than money . 
  the rest of the world will watch the cup anyway , a stereotypical american only watches usa play . 
  that was 5 minutes , which is long but standard . 
  there 's been many games with 5 added minutes in this tournament and only one game with 6 . 
  i do n't even remember when was the last time i saw a game with 6 minutes before that . 
  also that was after 90 minutes , not 120 . 
  big difference . 
  english major ? 
  corruption is everywhere . 
  third world countries just have really bad infrastructure for preventing it . 
  of course there 's going to be more corruption the more unlikely it is to get caught . 
  yeah but the rest of the world watches the world cup anyway . 
  my team 's not even in it and i 'm not a huge football fan yet i 've watched every game except for 2 this year . 
  all my friends , my parents , my sisters each watch at least one game a day . 
  general consesus is it 's the best television entertainment there is . 
  the u.s. only watches when they play . 
  i do n't mean ** every ** american . 
  i mean the masses . 
  yeah that 's also an important note . 
  the point of added time is n't compensating for each second the ball is out of play . 
  it 's for substitutions and injuries . 
  if they tried to make up for each free kick/corner/goal kick the average added time would be closer to 15 minutes per period . 
  the added time is not supposed to accurately replace each lost second . 
  if it did we 'd have added times of 15-20 minutes on average where as now it 's 2-5 minutes . 
   why they do n't just stop the clock in the first place instead of messing around with this extra time stuff, 
  why mess around with a clock when you can just let it run ? 
  first of all it 's not a problem to anyone else than you american 's because we 're used to it . 
  secondly and more importantly it 's a fully consceous decision . 
  you do n't need an arena with an expensive scoreboard . 
  you do n't even need a stopwatch or officials . 
  all you need is some type of clock somewhere . 
  football is a sport of the people , not a sport of rich american white kids . 
  only equipment you need is a ball ( i played hockey myself , i know all about expensive sporting equipment ) . 
  it 's played on tiny alleys in brazil and the savannahs in africa and the rules are the same everywhere . 
  that 's the beauty of it . 
  the extra time announced by the referee is nothing but an estimate for fans in the audience/tv . 
  in practice they can say 3 minutes but let the game run 3 minutes 45 seconds or even over 4 minutes if there is no good time to blow the whistle or because the ref felt like the other team was purposfully wasting excessive amounts of time . 
  it 's all up to the ref . 
  except it was n't . 
  that same thing was brought up in the original thread after the game . 
  if the espn broadcast showed something like that it 's fully their own mistake because [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r7vbssr.png ) was the first time the extra time was announced in the international broadcast with the original graphics straight from brazil ( note no number next to 90min meaning there was never a `` 4 '' . 
  a `` 5 '' popped up there a few seconds after the official displayed it . ), 
  yeah i could solve most of those off the top of my head . 
  the big question is how much did they know ahead of time . 
  if they were told what `` kind '' of math was going to be involved and knew to prepare for it those questions were relatively simple . 
  time consuming does n't equal difficult . 
  are you being serious ? 
  they added 6 maps straight from the workshop , none of which the ones the community has been waiting for for almost a year now and some weapon paints . 
  oh and those 6 ( shitty looking ) maps cost 5 euros . 
  that 's all it takes to keep you happy ? 
  did they remove cz yet and admit it was a bad idea to begin with ? 
  if not i 'm not interested .
