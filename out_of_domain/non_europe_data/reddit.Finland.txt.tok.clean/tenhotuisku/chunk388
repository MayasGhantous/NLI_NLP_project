  than the us . 
  what ? 
  you do realize finland is located next to russia ? 
  almost half of our [ border ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish%e2%80%93russian_border ) ( 1340km ) is with russia . 
  that 's almost half the lenght of the u.s - mexico border in a country with 1/50 the population of the u.s. 
  and it 's russia . 
  we still have conscription ( mandatory military service for everyone ) because of russia . 
  we actually need a military , it 's not just for showing off and bullying countries across the world . 
   second , the finns are in a much smaller area , and there are fewer of them . 
  this makes logistical issues much , much easier to solve . 
  the u.s has double the [ population density ] ( http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_density ) compared to finland so if anything the logistics are more difficult here . 
  i also do n't see the how the number of people has any effect on anything . 
  more people means more tax income and more people working on the logistics . 
  there 's nothing about this program that would n't scale . 
  it 's not a personalized box , they are mass-produced . 
  maybe you should n't take out loans to feed your father 's gambling problem . 
  college fund ( parents ' savings ) is one thing . 
  you taking loan in your own name is completely another . 
  i know about the u.s military spending . 
  you talked about the * need * for a military or border patrol . 
  finland actually needs it , you guys just like to have it . 
  nobody forced the u.s to make deals to protect half the countries in asia or act as world police , your leaders chose to do so . 
  we did n't choose to be located next to russia . 
   population density is just people/area . 
  finland looks sparsely populated , when in reality the people are just concentrated in one area , leaving much of the country uninhabited . 
  the same applies just as much to the u.s. 
  there 's cities and then there is more sparsely populated countryside . 
  finnish countryside is n't `` uninhabited '' . 
  sure lots of places especially in the north are , but the u.s has it 's own deserts and mountain ranges and forests as well . 
  [ 80.7 % of americans live in urban areas ] ( https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqid=5971 ) ( 2010 ) compared to [ 84,4 ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/taajama#taajamien_kasvu ) in finland ( 2011 ) . 
  the difference is not big enough to make the logistics an issue in only one country . 
   more people \u2260 more tax income unless they are gainfully employed , which many people are not . 
  we have a lot of poor people , and our taxes are much lower than other nations ' . 
  the [ employment-to-population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/employment-to-population_ratio ) ratio of the u.s is 67.1 ( 2012 ) compared to 69.5 in finland ( 2012 ) again , relatively same . 
  the average ( both [ mean ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) and [ median ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) ) household income is higher in the u.s , and significantly higher if you adjust it to [ purchasing power ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) as the u.s. is a much cheaper country to live in . 
  it 's true the u.s taxes are low but that 's not really an argument against tax funded programs . 
  of course more tax funded benefits means raising taxes . 
  oh i get it now . 
  so really you 're just in the same situation as anyone whose parents did n't have enough income to save extra money . 
  i live in a country with free college education so hardly . 
  i know . 
  he was implying the logistical issues in finland would be lower because the finns live in such a small area . 
  this could n't be further from the truth , finland is about the size of germany with less than tenth of the population . 
  oh i totally understand that . 
  in fact that 's my point . 
  the reason this would n't happen in the u.s. is due to the opposition of all welfare programs and not because of the logistics or the size of the country etc. 
  i do n't understand how size and population would even affect this program . 
  all it is is a government entity ordering baby items , putting them in a box and shipping them to anyone who 's had a baby checkup/registered for the box . 
  if anything it would be cheaper in a bigger country since the quantities of items ordered would be larger . 
  the cost to put together 10.000 baby boxes or 100.000 baby boxes including shipping should be approximately the same . 
  the infrastructure for distribution already exists in the form of the post office . 
   we have a lot of people . 
  our population is growing at 0.7 percent , which means there are around 2 million births per year . 
  it 'd cost hundreds of millions of dollars just buying the goods, 
  that does n't effect the cost ** per citizen ** . 
  the [ birth rates ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.cbrt.in ) and [ fertility rate ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in ) of both u.s and finland are almost the same . 
  it does n't matter if they used usps or fedex , the point was they would outsource the distribution like they do here . 
   plus you 'd have to hire a bunch of people in each state to oversee the operations , which would cost money . 
  you have to hire a bunch of people to oversee the operation in finland . 
  again , not a cost that would be larger per capita due to a larger country . 
   again , i 'm not saying that it could n't work in theory ; i 'm saying that sponsoring a bill that would publicly fund a maternity box for all pregnant women would be political suicide . 
  well i never argued against that . 
  the post i was responding to and your last reply made it seem like this program would be more costly in a larger country which is a point often made on any social security related posts on reddit . 
  there 's simply no logic to support that idea . 
  i agree it would never pass and that your social security program has bigger problems to deal with , but that 's a whole other issue . 
  the relative amount of manpower and resources needed should stay the same regardless of the country 's size . 
  it 's true that your country 's social security programs are often inefficent but that 's also a problem with your system , not something that `` automatically '' happens in a larger country . 
  germany for example has a population of over 80 million and one of the best social security programs in the world . 
  80 million is n't as much as 300 million but it 's still in the same range with the country divided into local governments etc. 
  also seeing as how ** everyone ** starts out as babies it does n't only benefit a small number of people . 
  it benefits everyone . 
  a bit is an understatement, 
  because a lot of people are selfish and shortsighted . 
  it 's funny because the record for reaching a temperature as close to zero as possible was actually held by a finnish university for a long time ( if not still ) . 
  my mother did it and i hate summer . 
  works both ways i guess . 
  there 's the actual christening and then there 's a `` coffee party '' after it . 
  meaning you eat cake and give gifts etc. 
  but it does n't last until the evening since parents of a new baby are often tired . 
  kinda like a kid 's 0 year birthday . 
  it 's mainly because they 're aimed at kids . 
  cartoons like family guy or south park or simpsons etc. 
  are n't dubbed . 
  it 's because we do n't mix politics and religion nearly as much as in the u.s. 
  at least in northern europe , the mediterranean is a mess . 
  it 's very common . 
  i 'm not an expert on the subject but i 'd estimate a vast majority of parents do it . 
  it 's supposed to help with your immune system but i 'm not sure if that 's just folklore . 
  fresh air ca n't hurt though . 
  [ yes . 
  basically what it says is you get to choose individually for each kid . 
  either get 2 boxes or one box and the other box as cash ( worth much less than the items ) . 
  just like england invented football . 
  it 's almost as if fifa had some sort of ulterior motives for having a world cup in a country that 's never even qualified to the games , lacks the infrastructure and is located in terrible climate for the sport . 
  in what sport would you combine the records of men and women ? 
  even chess has separate tournaments for men and women . 
   so then what use was art school if you did n't learn anything ? 
  if she never gave it a shot she would n't know that . 
  well the germans only killed 6 million jews that one time , yet every thread about germany is full of hitler jokes . 
  powerful people rarely were,
