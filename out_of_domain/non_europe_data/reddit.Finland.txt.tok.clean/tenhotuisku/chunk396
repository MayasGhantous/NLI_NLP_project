  knowing the risks and accepting them would be ( could be ) stupidity . 
  i guess that 's one way to look at it , though i do n't really agree with how you `` justified '' the `` need '' to free climb by simply saying `` he wanted to free climb '' . 
  because again you could use that same logic with the stupidest things imaginable . 
  `` i wanted to play russian roulette '' is it therefore not stupid to play russian roulette ? 
  `` i wanted to see what cyanide tastes like '' still pretty stupid to eat it do n't you think ? 
  because you made it sound like the people who do n't agree with his decision making process `` just do n't get it '' or are n't enlightened enough or are simply close minded . 
   they do n't even attempt to understand, 
  i could take all day attempting to understand and i still would n't understand it . 
  disagreeing is not the same as being close minded . 
  it 's true that the examples i provided were much more `` stupid '' than free solo climbing as the reward was smaller and the risks were bigger . 
  but that was my point . 
  if the logic `` he knew the risks , therefore taking them is n't stupid '' stated above were to hold then even the most extremely stupid decisions could be defended by it . 
  thus i do n't think it 's a very solid argument for risks of any size . 
  who said anything about `` deserving '' ? 
  people who partake in extremely dangerous activities without safety equipment are more likely to die . 
  that does n't mean they `` deserve '' it . 
  they 've clearly never lived here, 
  it was mazy enough for me to always play the game until duke 's before i start farming humanity, 
  i have a few hundred hours into the game and never knew that existed . 
  i do n't usually skip depths either . 
  did you make it across without changing your mind ? 
  all you need to counter curse is humanity . 
  i never bother with curse items . 
  and his handwriting looks much better than mine, 
  i think he mistakes he makes are more common for people who learnt english as their first language . 
  a foreign person or an expat would learn words like `` since '' or `` effect '' as text first and would be less likely to confuse them with `` sense '' or `` infect '' than someone who speaks the language natively ( and learnt by speech with limited education ) . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  there is no right order to clearing the game . 
  exploration is always a good idea , you might find some items . 
  the forest has lots of purple moss that 'll be useful in blight town ( after depths ) . 
  well ... depends where you live . 
  if you only see snow for a month or on vacation then yes snow = slippery . 
  if you 're used to 6 months of snow or more then you start making distinctions . 
  a light fresh layer of snow does n't necessarily mean slippery . 
  the road can be relatively `` dry '' and grippy ( with winter tires ) for many kilometers and then suddenly ice under the snow in one turn . 
  e . that being said the conditions in the gif do look pretty slippery . 
  people who live in areas with lots of snow ( the gif looks like northern europe/russia ) tend to be prepared for snow . 
  winter tires are mandatory and cars that perform well in the winter are preferred . 
  i do n't think `` not expecting to be # 1 '' is especially negative . 
  i still love this game , i do n't bother my mind with `` dead game '' comments but i 'm extremely surprised hots sold that well . 
  i imagined something like cs : go with $ 1.79 sales price to sell much more ( it 's by units sold ) . 
  or one of the other generic big names that sell on every platform . 
  yeah there 's a non-mandatory boss near those stone guys . 
  you do know about humanity boosting your item find until 10 humanity , right ? 
  very useful if you 're gon na farm . 
  yeah browns make more noise than a rubber dome but it 's not invasive, 
  if you have more than 50 subreddits ( or 100 with gold ) subscribed it wo n't show all the newest posts on the front page at once, 
   the finns like russian weapons, 
  not sure about `` liking '' , i think the ak was simply the most advanced/reliable/common assault rifle the finnish designers at the time were familiar with . 
  the rk-62 ( predecessor of the rk 95 in the pic and still widely used by the finnish army ) entered service in 1962 with earlier prototypes dating around 1960 . 
  iirc that 's before weapons like the m16 had been revealed to public . 
  copying/basing your designs on the ak-47 was the obvious choice for an army looking to arm itself with more modern weaponry . 
  of course the ability to use ammo from dead russian soldiers must 've been considered an added bonus . 
  if you 're referring to winter war/continuation war then yes , the finnish troops used a lot of russian ammunition and weaponry . 
  it 's my understanding the troops often carried a pretty colorful combination of weaponry because a lot of it was either looted from dead russian soldiers or stolen from ( russian ) farmhouses along the way . 
  at the start of war the finns had more soldiers than guns so they took anything they could get manufactured in time . 
  a lot of the weaponry came from private donators . 
  some soldiers brought their own rifle . 
  there was no single `` standard issue '' rifle . 
  although scarce ammunition was n't the biggest russian logistics problem , they had a lot of reasons and ways to die before running out of ammo . 
  that 's not how arguments work, 
   apparently the pictures were of the girl being sexually assaulted . 
  they were n't selfies at all , and allegedly were n't taken with her consent . 
  so woops . 
  so it 's actually not relevant at all to what we 're talking about here, 
  what you 're describing is the equivelant of raping someone and taking polaroids . 
  even if they did use modern technology ( phones ) to share them . 
  the topic was the trend of teenagers willingly taking pictures of themselves and sending them out , which has been a phenomenon growing in popularity for the past few years . 
  when you think of `` can opener '' you think of those big machines ? 
  i 've always used more or less [ one ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yf00urr_bzy/tcgng_zbugi/aaaaaaaaag0/8sk-qqvfyju/s1600/canopener+p51+2010-06-20.jpg ) of [ these ] ( http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0212/1922/products/can-opener-peacock_1024x1024.jpg?v=1365620191 ) . 
  i 've only seen those complicated mechanisms with wheels and blades in tv infomercials . 
  the local variants are very good as well . 
  i 've always gotten much better service than any `` proper '' internet store or seller on `` legal '' sites . 
  shipping in a matter of hours and delivered the next day . 
  there are sites in `` normal web '' that link the most useful sites like https://ahmia.fi/ . 
  you 'll find the urls to sites like silkroad etc. 
  as well as discussion boards inside `` deep web '' that have links to even more sites . 
  it 's not all that `` secret '' . 
  installing tor browser takes like 5 minutes and you use it just as you would use regular websites , just a bit slower because the traffic gets rerouted through many different computers . 
  e . once you log into silk road or a similiar service it 's just like a simplified ebay . 
  a list of categories that contain a list of products with a nice preview picture , the price and the sellers name and + / - reviews . 
  it 's just like any other second hand market except they mostly deal with drugs . 
  you can view a sellers profile and their latest reviews , total reviews , all available items etc. 
  choose the items you want and check out . 
  i guess i could take some screenshots if you want , it 's not like there 's any sensitive material visible anyway as anyone can register for an account . 
  really ? 
  the finnish silkroad ( `` silkkitie '' ) is very active . 
  last i checked there were about 50 ads for weed ( albeit most sellers have more than 1 ad per person ) . 
  all your mdma and other synthetic needs as well . 
  of course the selection is smaller than on international sites , but there 's at least one seller for everything and you do n't have to worry about customs . 
  oh getting to deep web is as simple as installing google chrome or any web browser these days . 
  it used to be more difficult , and there 's still some extra precautions to take if you 're going to sell stuff for example , but just for browsing the regular tor browser is just fine https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en, 
  i only have a working account for finnish silk road at the moment as i no longer use the international sites ( i want to avoid customs ) but you should get the general idea even with the language barrier . 
  it 's just like any website . 
  categories on the left , products on the right . 
  i also included an example product page and a seller page . 
  here 's a `` deep web '' image board . 
  as you see it looks pretty much like any other chan . 
  the only difference is the anonymity is `` real '' so people discuss a lot of stuff openly . 
  great place to find urls to new deep web sites .
