  it 's not 12 pm everywhere . 
  i 'm so glad to hear about the l2 . 
  it always baffled me how they fucked up the perfectly good l2 from nhl11/nhl12 and called it a `` new feature '' . 
  even the description of the `` new feature '' sounded more like the old nhl12 l2 than the new one from nhl 13 and 14 . 
   i assume most people on / b / are american, 
  that 's a pretty wild assumption . 
  if i had to guess i 'd say it 's around that 50 % mark , more likely under than over . 
  if you trust alexa ( you should n't ) they estimate u.s + canada to total at 51 % of visitors . 
  i 'm so glad to see these kind of posts upvoted on reddit . 
  only a year or so ago you would 've been buried in downvotes for your `` victim blaming '' ( aka . 
  promoting precautions against all sorts of illegal activities ) . 
  you 're the first one to use the word `` all '' . 
  a lot of consumers are stupid as fuck/ignorant on the subject whichever wording you like . 
  that does n't mean `` everyone but me '' is stupid . 
  but the issue with simcity performance was n't graphical , it was the cpu intensiveness of bigger cities . 
  something that affects gameplay , not graphics . 
   games have provided graphics settings only available to the top 10 % of typical pc specs, 
  yeah , graphics settings . 
  the `` issue '' with simcity was n't about graphics . 
  it was gameplay . 
  i 'm not defending ea , just saying that this is totally different from crysis having ultra graphics that nobody can run . 
  is n't an olympic swimming pool 25x50 metres and a few metres deep ? 
  4 pools would be 100 meters by 50 meters which is more or less a football field . 
  i 'm not saying that 's a `` small '' amount of gold but it 's still very easily comprehensible . 
  with gold ( or golding ) being so prevalent even in electronics and furtinure etc and all the jewelry the 6 billion people of planet earth have in their posession i 'd expect the total amount of gold to be something not easily comprehensible . 
  4 olympic swimming pools is about the size of an apartment building . 
  a relatively small amount in my opinion . 
  you 'd think wedding rings alone would make a much bigger block if melted together . 
   the pools are absolutely massive . 
  about 1/4th of a football field and 2-3 meters deep . 
  not that `` massive '' . 
  much bigger than your average backyard pool though . 
  yeah i 've played football . 
  i still would n't use the adjective `` massive '' . 
  an average apartment building ( and i 'm not talking about skyscrapers ) is about the same size . 
  i do n't consider apartment buildings to be `` massive '' . 
  it 's a large amount of metal for sure , but people have been digging for gold for thousands of years . 
  i 'd expect there to be much more than `` a large amount '' . 
  well maybe as far as pools go , i do n't know . 
  i live by the ocean , i 'm not a pool expert . 
  but gold is n't usually measured in `` pools '' so wether or not they 're massive compared to other pools seems hardly relevant . 
  50x25x3m is still not that `` massive '' chunk of metal . 
  yea i mentioned the ocean because who owns a pool next to an ocean ? 
  the only pool i ever go to is an olympic sized pool during winter time . 
  that 's why i said i 'm not an expert on `` backyard pools '' . 
  i was just commenting how 25 meters by 50 meters is hardly `` massive '' in any other context and we were talking about a volume of metal , not the size of an average pool wherever you live . 
   after seeing how little gold we have today, 
  what makes you think that ? 
  most wedding rings in the ( western ) world are made of gold . 
  there should be at least hundreds of millions if not a billion wedding rings out there , especially if you account for the dead . 
  a * lot * of people own some sort of gold jewelry even if they do n't wear it . 
  rings , necklaces , earrings/other piercings , lockets , pendants , watches , picture frames all sorts of stuff . 
  old people might have golden cutlery or candlesticks stashed away . 
  that 's why these `` cash to gold '' merchants make so much money , gold is everywhere . 
  not to mention all the gold of deceased kings and other leaders you find in museums . 
  even much of the better quality electronics have gold coating in their wires which is not gold paint but a very thin layer of actual gold . 
  it 's a little bit there , a tiny amount here but with the seven billion people in the world i would think the total would amount to more than 3 olympic pools . 
  a block of gold the size of 75x50x3 meters is still easily comprehensible . 
  about the size of an apartment building . 
  usually when you deal with these `` in the whole world '' things they are n't easily comprehensible . 
  for example : if you took all those 7 billion people alive today and made them stand on each other 's shoulders ( or heads to make it simpler ) they would make it to the moon and back 15 times . 
  that 's an incomprehensible amount for me . 
  and that amount of people having digged for gold for thousands of years only finding 3 pools worth does n't sound like much . 
  thanks for doing the math haha . 
  yeah it is a lot . 
  it 's just that it 's very hard to imagine these things like `` melting all the gold rings in the world '' and what these huge numbers would look like in real life . 
  here 's another intersting figure i found : [ this article by bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21969100 ) hints all the gold in the world melted to a cube would only be the size of 20 meters . 
  they also make a good point :, 
   so who 's right ? 
  well , we do n't know . 
  in the end , all these numbers are made up of estimates added to estimates added to yet more estimates . 
  maybe they 're all way off . 
  i can only spot one obnoxious person on this comment thread, 
  i would give it a chance , but not much more . 
  i did the same thing you 're describing before the gtav console release and gtaiii felt by far the most aged , unfair and infuriating . 
  you can definitely tell it was their first attempt at a 3d world where as vice city had the groundwork all laid out and just focused on ironing out the details and perfecting the gameplay . 
  so give it a shot , but if you grow tired of it do n't abandon the entire project , just jump to the next game . 
  some people felt it took itself too seriously compared to vc/sa , and did n't like the relationship/friend mini games . 
  i do n't understand all the complaints though , all you have to do is ignore a call every hour or so ( real time , not game hour ) if you do n't wan na go bowling . 
  you can even turn your phone to silent mode . 
  i think it 's a very solid game and the expansions are great . 
   watch_dogs gets laughed at for doing it like people have n't been seeing this for years , which really shows just how well it normally works , huh ? 
  that ca n't have anything to do with the fact that we 've been used to playing on decade old consoles and watch_dogs was the first big title on the new fancy consoles that cost 500 $ and were supposed to do everything better ? 
  it 's not that watch_dogs was worse at this than all other games . 
  it 's that it was supposed to be better . 
  well might as well , you already suffered the pain . 
  so you actually think the problem here is showing the holocaust memorial , not standing on it ? 
  why not ? 
  most people do n't answer their phones doing work/school hours and you 'd probably want to know right away if your best friend died . 
  south korea or japan is way ahead of u.s. in science . 
  culture is your best bet . 
  yeah and you never want them . 
  have fun suffering from the unhappiness penalty whatever you choose to do with it . 
  why ca n't i just reject their offer to join my kingdom ? 
  no , and i fully understand why they do n't give the suspect of an armed robbery the benefit of the doubt if he 's pointing a gun around . 
  ** however ** the cops ' story states that they responded with gunfire ** after the suspect had fired two rounds at them ** . 
  now i 'm not an expert on airsoft guns but i do know a little bit . 
  first of all they say `` bloop '' not `` boom '' . 
  there is no muzzle flash and their projectiles are little plastic pellets . 
  they may look authentic a few feet away , but that 's it .
