  they do n't mimic how a real gun operates . 
  i think firing at a robber with an airsoft gun is an understandable decision . 
  that story about the two shots before police started firing really sets off my bullshit detectors though . 
  had it not been an airsoft gun nobody would question that he fired two shots . 
  now we know he possibly could n't have fired two shots so what happened ? 
  did the police make it up ? 
  is this standard procedure whenever they open fire ? 
  `` oh yeah he fired two shots at us first '' . 
  he was a campus cop trying to help, 
  it 's as if there was more than one person with more than one opinion on reddit . 
  you do realize all her videos are available on any porn torrent tracker out there ? 
  this whole cat and mouse game this sub plays with filesharing sites is cute and all , but it 's totally unnecessary . 
   you really think they had time to think about all that in the heat of the moment ? 
  think about what ? 
  gunshots implies hearing gunshots , should n't be too hard to determine whether you heard gunshots or not if you 're a few dozen yards away . 
   they also probably could n't hear very well with themselves firing, 
  the whole point was the suspect allegedly fired two shots ** before ** the officers returned fire . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  couple of pops ? 
  have you ever heard the sound an airsoft gun makes ? 
  it sounds more like dropping a ping pong ball on the ground than a gunshot . 
  again , i 'm not criticizing these officers for shooting a guy with an airsoft gun . 
  they ca n't possibly expect/prepare for armed suspects to carry toy guns . 
  it was totally a justified decision to shoot . 
  but that 's not what i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm talking about the fact that before realizing it was an airsoft gun these officers said they `` were fired at '' to further justify their decision to shoot . 
  but it was n't a real gun and thus they could n't have been fired at . 
  ** that 's ** my problem . 
  the fact that they lied about getting shot at . 
  had it been a real gun nobody would question their story of `` two gunshots '' . 
  but it was n't , so obviously they were lying . 
  is it standard practice for these police officers to always tell `` they were fired at '' when they decided to shoot regardless of what actually happened ? 
  that 's what i have a problem with , not that they shot the guy . 
  i 'm saying they lied about the circumstances around the shooting , and it probably was n't the first time in a similiar situation that they did so . 
   you are saying that their wording made it seem more threatening than it was in reality, 
  that 's not what i 'm saying at all . 
  it 's very clear they only realized it was an airsoft gun after shooting him . 
  why would they even shoot him if they realized the guy was shooting an airsoft gun ? 
  i 'm saying they shot the guy because they saw a gun which looked real and that 's fine . 
  but when giving their statement they ( one or more of the officers ) decided to add the part about `` two fired shots '' because obviously he could n't have `` fired shots '' with an airsoft gun while keeping the illusion that it 's a real gun . 
  that means they exaggerated and falsified the events to make sure nobody would question their decision to shoot . 
  for all we know the robber did n't even notice the police before they started shooting at him . 
  the problem is police officers lying to the press , not that they shot a guy with a plastic toy gun . 
   i doubt they would lie about it, 
  what ? 
  there 's nothing to doubt . 
  an airsoft gun can not `` fire shots '' , thus no shots were fired prior to the police opening fire . 
  there was no one else capable of firing shots than the police officers . 
  what they said happened is an impossibility . 
  and it 's not even that difficult to comprehend so i ca n't understand how you 're struggling with it . 
  you ca n't mistake an airsoft firing to a real gun firing . 
  that 's like mistaking a popped balloon for a nuclear warhead . 
  but i 'd much rather go outside once it 's dark . 
  it 's not like the world disappears when the sun sets . 
  in fact a lot of the more interesting stuff does n't happen before the sun sets . 
  that 's not how time works . 
  but that 's two different things . 
  i think the above comment was not about `` having income '' but people who value work in itself , not just the salary . 
  you know , the type of people who win the lottery and still keep their old job . 
  or the people who complain how they have `` nothing to do '' on vacations ( this might be more prevalent in countries where you get a minimum of 4 + weeks off per year ) . 
  i 'm unemployed and people keep asking me `` what do you do all day '' or `` how do you spend all your time if you do n't work '' . 
  even now i never have enough time to do everything i want or ever have trouble coming up with stuff to do . 
  the only reason i 'd get a job is the money . 
  because nicotine feels nice ? 
  did you really have to ask that or are you just trying to make yourself look good ? 
  i do n't even smoke and you come off as a huge douche . 
  asking why people smoke is like asking why people put fat or sugar in their food when it would be healthier not to . 
  to satisfy an urge . 
  it 's a vice . 
   as soon as someone tells me they drank until they passed out , as if it 's an accomplishment i should be half as proud of, 
  sounds like you 're the one with the problem in comprehension . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone over the age of 15 being `` proud '' of passing out . 
  you sound like one of those people who think everything other people say out loud is `` bragging '' . 
  i do n't know about you but forests are open 24/7 365 where i live . 
  because with 99.9 % probability it was someone else using footage of snoop that they input as a `` webcam '' . 
  people have been doing this for as long as omegle and chat roulette have existed . 
  no it would n't . 
  it was way too op . 
  implying anything can be worse than cs : s, 
  but awp is the most fun weapon in the game . 
  it 's totally a nerf, 
  because it 's a nerf , and having an option `` if you 'd like the nerf or not '' is retarded . 
  the change is n't to make awp ` ing more fun or effective , it 's the opposite . 
  the people who most like this change are the ones who never pick up an awp . 
  skins did n't affect gameplay so that 's hardly a valid comparison . 
  you 're complaining about unwanted realism and then go on to list a number of things that are n't realistic at all . 
  in contrast to camping a single corner for an entire round for example . 
  it encourages more static ( and boring ) play . 
  or just remove cz . 
  p250 and five-seven are great pistols and even the current deagle is plenty good . 
  cs : s deagle was retarded because nobody ever bought any other pistol . 
  it was better than anything not ak/awp . 
  i live on one , it 's not an american college though . 
  peeking with the awp is a very common and effective strategy in lower leagues . 
  do n't forget valve does n't optimize the game for people like kennys . 
  it 's designed with casuals in mind first and foremost with a rare aknowledgement nod towards the competetive scene . 
  this should be abundantly clear to you by now if you 've followed the development/post-release development at all . 
  did you even read the post you were replying to before you started complaining how reddit always complains about police ? 
  let 's look at some quotes :, 
   i fully understand why they do n't give the suspect of an armed robbery the benefit of the doubt,
