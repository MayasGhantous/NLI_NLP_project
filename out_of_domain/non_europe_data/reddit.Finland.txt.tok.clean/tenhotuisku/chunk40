  i , too , remember the first time i saw gw2 high . 
  i do n't thing i 've ever seen anything so beautiful on a tv screen . 
  well i did this too for about a month when i was a sapling . 
  then someone introduced me to crutches . 
  no turning back . 
  the shape still varies on quantity though . 
  i like straight joints . 
  the dow drop was on my front page today , and apparently that post was made before this one . 
  well to be honest gradual_nigger was actually funny , and knowing the dow score of the day has no effect on my life whatsoever . 
  yes , the stock market does and i have a portfolio , but knowing about dow really does n't change anything . 
  that 's why we have seperate upvote and downvote buttons for both of us, 
  well if your sex was pained embararasment then obviously your dick was n't ok to start with . 
  i 'm all for medical circumsision . 
  we 're talking about traditional here . 
  i must admit this is the first time i 've seen anyone getting totally owned by a tray, 
  [ by far the best pingu episode ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywwbw-dzmjk ), 
  i actually have some . gifs of that somewhere, 
  the cancer that 's killing gaming,

  i do n't see why that answer is either douchey or `` golden '' . 
  to me it just seemed nicely short , to the point and correct . 
  i was waiting for a punchline the entire time . 
  holy shit saved, 
  me too , and these days the replays can actually look sweet . 
  i rarely watch the second replay though . 
  nope . 
  because poor working class people ca n't steal ? 
  `` it 's a prank some would say went too far '', 
  yeah i 'll try telling that to the judge next time i 'm ripping clothes of women and posting pictures on the interbutt, 
  yeah and when you live together you can google bdsm without it being a big deal . 
  what the fuck , seriously . 
  eh ... prostitution is legal in nevada ( outside lv ) so why the fuck could n't they write receipts if the owner felt like it ? 
  what would they incriminate themselves to by admitting they gave a `` happy ending '' where prostitution is legal ? 
  there 's no address on the receipt and you know people have carried pieces of paper in their pockets for longer distances before . 
  you 're doing it wrong . 
  my gf actually spends more money `` on me '' ( or mutual interestes ) than i on her . 
  and i get happy endings for free . 
  suck it . 
  yeah and the goal replays are way too short . 
  especially the `` highlight '' ones . 
  sometimes it starts less than a second before the goal . 
  did you actually have a hard time reading these or just whining for the sake of whining ? 
  to me it sounds more like the new bangbros special . 
  a paintbrush with extra sausage and so forth . 
  did you know that they can actually not accept you , and you wo n't even get a refund & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  it sounds like the truth . 
  i do n't know what you are all so offended by . 
  is it the word `` socialist '' ? 
  you know it is n't a curse word or anything . 
  the american way of not doing anything and accepting any sort of buttrape from corporations while the government keeps you pinned down is a much better solution . 
  very interesting but this must be one of the worst rating systems in the world . 
  every country was b , bb , bbb , bbb , a , aa , aaa with plusses and minuses . 
  how about 0-10 or f-a or something . 
  this shit 's confusing . 
  especially if you try to talk about it irl instead of typing `` so the u.s was ay-ay-ay but now it 's ay-ay-plus where as in africa bee-bee-bee and bee-bee-plus-bee-minus '', 
  yeah it 's pretty scary when the government uses so much money to research forcefully controlling unarmed civilians . 
  if i had ever seen a science fiction movie i might be a bit afraid . 
  i 've heard/read about most of those , but i need to read that entire article with better time . 
  i do n't know but i need that sauce, 
  i used to be a nintendo fan . 
  i switched over to xbox in this generation . 
  now the same shit is infecting 360 games too . 
  real publishers focusing their attention and money on this garbage . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  i was there in '10 and everything looked fine so idk, 
  well the thing is that the tip of your penis would n't be rubbing against shit all the time because it 's protected when not in use . 
  from what i understand random erections are pretty regular with a circumsized penis ( i have n't actually read that much about it but american tv , movies , reddit , jokes , comics , stories etc. ) . 
  they really are n't a problem with uncut . 
  sure i got a few as a teenager but they were n't common or anything . 
  except for the first sentence everything i base everything in this post in nothing more than personal experience/discussions about it with friends ( who are uncut but i also studied in the u.s for a year ) . 
  all my uncut friends agree that they do n't really get the `` random boners '' joke like they would be everyday stuff or relatable . 
  `` face sex trial '' has the outcome been decided yet ? 
  sorry but it does n't . 
  i have a modded xbox so i try out about 1-2 games a week , sometimes more if they 're shit and play through about 30 games a year + lots of multiplayer . 
  there has definitely been a decrease in quality games after they announced all this kiddie shit . 
  more and more publishers and developers are either focusing on doing something else or rushing `` real '' games because they also have to push out this shit . 
  that 's just my guess though , i do n't know the cause , i 've just witnessed the effects . 
  i also play a lot with friends on the same couch and my girlfriend has a wii . 
  it has maybe like 4 minigames that i ever come back to it , all the `` full '' games are crap . 
  we much rather play sports games or shooters or `` party '' games on 360 . 
  e. oh and before you accuse me of ruining the industry myself by pirating or something along those lines i just wan na let you know that i still buy a considerable amount of games and dlc . 
  but you never know which games are good and i ca n't afford to buy to every single one that looks interesting . 
  if i did n't pirate i 'd just play more of the same games . 
  am i the only one who only has this problem right after lighting a joint/cigarette ? 
  if i take one puff , pick it back in my fingers and then continue this never happens no matter how much i smoke . 
  but if i do n't , that second puff is lethal to eyes .

  my biggest complaint would be that no part of it was funny, 
  i know nothing about you and already hate you . 
  and everyone else who ca n't focus while high . 
  personally i get drawn into the movie and i 'm completely immersed . 
  i always know what 's going on and even some more on top of that that i 've imagined . 
  then some fucker breaks my illusion with `` duuuh , who 's that guy . 
  i want some fritos . '', 
  you . 
  stoners . 
  edit . 
  also , you linked the fucking picture wrong . 
  figure that shit out .
