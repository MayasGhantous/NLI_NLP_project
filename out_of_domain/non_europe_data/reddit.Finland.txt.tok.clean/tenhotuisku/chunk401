  the racing was pretty lackluster . 
  burnout 3 's crash mode was probably the best minigame i 've ever played but as a racing game burnout 2 was way better . 
   from the top i thought that thing down there was a 2d texture, 
  where exactly did you look down on it ? 
  i do n't recall seeing the darkroot basin before i entered past the titanite demon . 
  hbo is n't `` america only '' . 
   i hope this helps reinforce to silvers how important headshots, 
  seeing as how the top 3 hs % players are all in teams that finished 9-16 and the # 1 hs % player just got kicked out of his team i 'm not sure how this pic reinforces that idea . 
  i do n't think you understand how sarcasm works . 
  now that 's better, 
  yeah it would but in all honesty who the fuck cares ? 
  it was n't even oc to begin with , it 's from a nature documentary . 
  sounds like you suck at cs if you can do `` fine '' compared to your usual level without headphones . 
  you $ 2k 7.1 sound system sucks dick compared to $ 20 headphones when using it to hear footsteps in videogames . 
  it was *, 
  they keep saying the same thing in finland yet every summer we collectively bitch and moan for months because it 's so hot you feel nauseous . 
  all the businesses , offices and cars have a/c so i do n't understand why 95 % of houses are still not air conditioned . 
  demos are always unfinished . 
  as is usually the game on release , it takes a month or few of patches to get the game to its full glory . 
  the last dozen posts i 've seen from this sub on my front page were all ar-15 's, 
  he was n't yelling at him angrily , it was a light hearted joke . 
  besides the guy was totally being an idiot . 
  nothing unprofessional in saying it like it is , especially when you 're an event host and not some business manager or politician who has to stay totally pc 100 % of the time . 
  maybe because you work in it help desk and redeye is an event host . 
  not exactly the same profession , not the same standards for `` professionality '' . 
  nothing unprofessional in calling someone who acts like an idiot an idiot . 
  seems like there 's an obvious answer : your level is low . 
  you sound like a fanboy, 
  also you sound like you 're stuck in 2005 . 
  because of my job i have to work with mostly linux computers but some macs and windows pc 's as well . 
  macs these days have close to zero compability problems ( outside video games ) and any software you want is available . 
  it 's not like it was a decade ago or how linux still is . 
  if you 're not into gaming you 'll have zero trouble switching from windows to mac . 
  of course i am but that 's because i 'm about to lay my hands on the product i 've been waiting for . 
  if i could save 1 $ by it not being in the packaging but still a brand new product i 'd choose that without any hesitation . 
  well cool for you , not everyone is . 
  if you want to game with your computer then it 's an obvious choice of course . 
   its a cheap 100 dollar version of the standard wii, 
  but the standard wii is much less than 100 dollars, 
  the way you 're referring to texan laws makes me think you 're american but what kind of an american or native english speaker does n't know the meaning of the word `` federal '' ? 
  yeah and i should n't have to lock my bike when i leave it alone on the street but it 's not a perfect world and we take precautions because of it . 
   and having it on a phone is exactly like locking it up, 
  no it is n't . 
  having naked pictures on your phone is like owning a bike in this example , not locking it up . 
  these pictures were n't aquired by physically stealing the phones . 
  the data clearly was n't protected well enough , it was probably even in `` the cloud '' . 
  maybe the looks explain how op 's family was able to fit in an additional generation . 
  my grandad ( not great ) was about the same age during ww2 and i 'm just barely of age myself . 
   the pictures were on a phone that is her personal property , and some fucking asshole hacked the device and stole them . 
  point is , the pictures were n't in public for someone to take, 
  yeah and my unlocked bike is my personal property , not for someone to take . 
  sounds more like common sense than definitely interesting . 
  those microstates have the highest gdp per capita in europe . 
  first of all , you do realize that a `` hacked phone '' means a hacked account affiliated with that phone ? 
  it 's not like they 're some movie villain bad guys hiding in bushes with an antenna and a laptop hacking into your phone in real time . 
  in all likelihood all these pictures were either a. downloaded from apple 's / google 's cloud service or b. leaked by someone who received these pictures , or their friend , or their friend of a friend c. aqcuired from the cloud service of one of the recipients . 
  the physical phone device of the celebrity in question has nothing or close to nothing to do with it . 
  secondly you should n't think your phone is secure . 
  in fact that 's a very stupid assumption to make . 
  if i lock my bike with silly string it probably is n't going to keep the thieves away . 
  the average cell phone you buy from walmart or apple store is n't designed to thwart a hacker 's dedicated attack , much less if you use any of the online services or even public wifi . 
  i 'm not justifying the hacker 's actions as i 'm not justifying the actions of a bike thief , but there 's a reason people take precautions even if those actions are morally wrong and/or illegal . 
  if you 're a celebrity and as such a target of public interest ** do n't keep naked pics of yourself in your phone ** . 
  should be common sense . 
  you hear news stories about high school teenagers ' naked pics spreading online daily , do you really expect yourself ** as a celebrity ** to generate less interest than a random teenager ? 
  if you absolutely must keep taking naked pics of yourself then either keep it analog , do n't become a celebrity or expect them to leak . 
  it 's that simple . 
  look daddy , that guy expects 99 % of people to be non-creeps when in the privacy of their own home and anonimity of the internet . 
  how cute . 
  so how exactly a hacked selfie different from a paparazzi taking pictures of people nude in their own home/backyard ? 
  at least with hacked selfies the subject knew she was being photographed . 
  how is that more `` creepy '' than all these tabloids that sell millions of copies or `` celebrity news '' and all that shit ? 
  also the line between being a racist and saying things that are deemed racist by modern society . 
  black people are stupid because of their stupid black people genes = racist . 
  black people are statistically more likely to be convicted of rape = not racist . 
  99 % of the time `` hacked phone '' means `` hacked account affiliated with a phone '' . 
  all these images are probably from the cloud . 
  it seems like people have an image in their mind of these elite hackers cracking the phone in less than 60 seconds like in mission impossible or swordfish or some shit . 
  in reality they probably set up a free wifi hot spot behind a starbucks in hollywood and let the celebs give their info willingly . 
  log into your email from free wifi -  account & password saved -  used to reset icloud/google password -  access to anything ever uploaded to the cloud . 
  to be fair `` actively '' means clicking `` yes '' on one of the dozens of screens you click `` yes '' on just to get it over with and use your new phone . 
  you do n't have to go into the settings to look for it or anything . 
   but the real news here is that icloud was hacked . 
  in the same meaning of the word as people who left their facebook open on a public computer were `` hacked '' . 
  yeah but there 's a difference between `` jennifer lawrence 's icloud account was hacked '' and `` icloud was hacked '' . 
  icloud was `` hacked '' in the same meaning as people who leave their facebook open on a school computer are `` hacked '' . 
  maybe their interpretation of the statistic does n't suggest a systemic bias against black people . 
  the judge is not the only one who plays a part in who goes to jail and who does n't . 
   i assume you mean `` a black person who is accused of rape is x % more likely to be convicted than a white person accused of rape . '', 
  oh i meant `` an average black person has a higher chance of being convicted of rape in his lifetime than white person '' . 
  see , there you go assuming stuff and generalizing . 
  a statistic is a statistic , it can not be racist or have prejudices . 
  unless you 're accusing the source of the statistics for manipulating the results . 
  majority of people in general when not bound by the limits of social acceptance and their `` reputation '' . 
  oh i realized that , but you affiliated racism with something that is not racist . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong in your assumption that most people who would quote a statistic like that are racist . 
  however assuming someone to be racist for saying non-racist statement like that `` because most people who would say so are racist '' is prejudice in itself . 
   because an educated person understands that there are other factors at play -- education , culture , socioeconomic status -- which largely stem from a history of deep racism in the first place . 
  could n't the person quoting the statistic be an educated person aware of the effects of education , culture and socioeconomic status ? 
  you 're the one expecting him to blame it on genes or skin colour .
