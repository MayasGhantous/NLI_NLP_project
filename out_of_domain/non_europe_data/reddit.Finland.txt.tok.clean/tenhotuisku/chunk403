  it was always shit . 
  just like anything else you think `` used to be good '' until x ruined it . 
  depends if you 're a member of isis, 
  if you know of a better news aggregator i 'm all ears . 
  visiting news sites themselves is nearly impossible because 95 % of the content is pure shit . 
  / r/worldnews might be biased but at least it wo n't try telling me about celebrities . 
  maybe you should n't live in such a backwards ass town that there 's not even a college nearby . 
  let 's just do a random sample test of the featured articles ( big title and picture on the top of front page ) . 
  at this moment of fri sep 5th 8:36 am gmt +2 :, 
  \\ # 1 news story is a celebrity, 
  \\ # 1 news story is a commentary on the events of ukraine with no new info . 
  \\ # 1 news story is spors . 
  i like sports but come on . 
  \\ # 1 news story is not a news story but a personal piece on the wife of someone important in some intra-u . s political shenanigans . 
  we were talking about a replacement to r/worldnes . 
  \\ # 1 news story is an editorial piece about obama and the middle-east . 
  could classify as news . 
  compare that to the top 5 posts on r/worldnews right now . 
  lego is now world 's largest toy maker, 
  yao ming saving endangered animals in china, 
  three top isis lieutenants killed by u.s. 
  bp found guilty of negligence in 2010 oil spill, 
  internet vs isis, 
  neither option is perfect , but i have a pretty clear winner in my mind . 
  only state colleges have college students ? 
  well seeing as how i live on college campus in the middle of the suburbs i 'm gon na have to call bullshit on that one . 
  did n't i say neither one is perfect ? 
  where did i applaud reddit for news about a sports celebrity ? 
  if anything that story is the reason i included the `` neither is perfect '' line . 
  i was asking for an alternative media aggregator , so why would n't i compare them like a media aggregator ? 
  that would require me to read through pretty much every headline that comes out , there is no sorting . 
  true . 
  i did n't originally plan on including the / r/worldnews comparison , it was just a random sample of what these sites have to offer . 
  i decided to add it later when i realized all the news sites were full of shit . 
   you understand that / r/worldnews [ 1 ] does n't actually write those articles , right ? 
  that they come from external sources ? 
  because 2 of those 5 links you 're praising in / r/worldnews [ 2 ] come from washingtonpost.com and bbc.com, 
  that 's the entire point ? 
  same sources and same articles but sorted differently in a way that is more appealing to me . 
  maybe they were just cheap ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  this is actually major . 
  i came here to tell that the stuff op listed is n't `` 3/4 of the content '' as those are all shitty niche game modes only a few played anyway but online vs is the second most important mode in the whole game . 
  play offline/online vs games which you should already be doing . 
  playing against the cpu kills all the fun , might as well not play . 
  other than shootout mode everything listed in op 's post was one of those `` tried it , meh '' game modes . 
  would n't had made any difference in my decision to get the game . 
  but online vs being limited to 1v1 's is a deal breaker . 
  that boat is orange so i 'm thinking it 's one of the police/military boats that spawn semi near you wherever you go . 
   and that was enough to get us stoned ( we thought we were stoned , now i know we were only kinda buzzed ), 
  totally opposite . 
  i used to get so fucking high when i was younger . 
  it 's totally unimaginable now , like a different drug . 
  everything was an adventure and the laws of science were twisted , almost like lsd . 
  now it 's such a familiar feeling you can easily control it . 
  yeah i 've never heard of this problem of `` nobody selling 1g '' . 
  it 's usually the total opposite , people want to find a `` proper '' dealer instead of buying 1 gram bags . 
  because of dead bodies ? 
  i agree the `` cute corpses '' subreddit thing is disturbing because of the whole idea of `` cute corpses '' but it 's not actually that bad to browse . 
  it 's just dead bodies . 
  not even mutilated or anything but well preserved ( hence `` cute '' ) . 
  it 's like going to an open casket funeral or watching csi . 
  ca n't sort when it hits my front page . 
  i rarely ever browse this sub alone . 
  also this video was shit like 99 % of vines i 've seen . 
   ever wonder why your girlfriend makes you press down on her tummy ? 
  what ? 
  yeah that 's what i 've always thought but i still do n't get the `` press down on her tummy '' part . 
  i 've never heard of that being a `` thing '' . 
  no but this is still probably in my top 5 favourite subs . 
  default subs and the like have been lost for years , this sub was still great up until the influx of shitty vines . 
  all you need to do is change the `` de '' to `` en '' . 
  not that complicated . 
  i use windows phone and i totally can . 
  in fact i was on windows phone when i edited the url and then posted the comment . 
  what is the source for no guests in online vs ? 
  i see it posted everywhere on this sub but have n't seen an `` official '' post on ea sites or anything like that . 
  http://www.easports.com/nhl/news/2014/nhl-15-game-modes this one does n't mention guests . 
  and you had the option not to do so . 
  better than not letting anyone play with a guest . 
  what 's the confirmation ? 
  i ca n't find sources outside this sub . 
  implying college education/diploma depends on one day of classes . 
  it 's totally ok to skip a day every now and then . 
  get off your high horse . 
  i do n't know a single college student who 's never skipped classes . 
  it 's perfectly normal and does n't make you a skipper who suddenly skips classes every day . 
  people on reddit talk about skipping college like it 's a mortal sin or a gateway drug . 
  it 's not . 
  first of all attendance is not the most important thing . 
  a person who studies the material carefully at home can learn a lot more than a person who attends classes without paying full attention . 
  secondly all college degrees include a bunch of unnecessary shit that just happens to be mandatory . 
  as long as you pass the classes nobody cares if you skipped one lecture that one time . 
  everything in moderation . 
  are you one of those people who eat themselves uncomfortably full at a buffet because not doing so would be `` wasting money '' ? 
  it was n't supposed to be an analogy . 
  life is full of `` free '' or already paid for stuff that you pass on . 
  if you buy a gym membership you could go twice a day every day . 
  why do n't you ? 
  because you 're an utter failure who never goes to the gym ?
