  not a selection of three best investments from a larger group of investments . 
  even if microsoft was n't unknown in 1994 it was still a good investment . 
  most of my classes just have lectures and assignments to turn in . 
  nobody 's going to start taking attendance in a lecture hall that can hold hundreds of students . 
  yeah people always give shit to the `` cameraman '' in live events . 
  the cameraman does n't make any of the decisions , the director does . 
  i have n't read up on this exact incident but i can confirm that, 
  a. she is a celebrity , some chinese actress or a model or something called irena liu who was supposedly dating one of the players in the event . 
  she can often be seen in the audience of these events . 
  b. the english commentary is just added on to the same footage and they do n't really communicate between the korean broadcast and the english one . 
  so when the content is not starcraft they 're mostly just cracking jokes . 
  so what he said would seem entirely logical . 
  if there was really a communciations issue the director would just switch to another camera would n't he ? 
  no because i can actually choose my friends . 
  you must live in a sad world if those are the only two options, 
  that 's . . just bullshit . 
  i doubt you worked with software or if you did you were mainly brewing coffee . 
  when you 're programming a video game you do n't hard code the key bindings into features . 
  the game logic of `` action x results in reaction y '' is completely separate from the layer that contains the information `` pressing space key on the keyboard means action x '' . 
  there are `` key bindings '' in the game . 
  there just is n't an option to customize them . 
  the ability to customize key bindings is an ui issue , it would n't make updating or testing the game any more complicated . 
   and you can get literally everything from just playing the game one day . 
  for one day you get an item that 's priced $ 115 ? 
  why would they make it so easy to unlock ? 
  who would buy it then other than people just looking to donate ? 
  i had to pause the video for a second to prepare myself after hearing `` i 'm sure africa is a beautiful place '', 
  of course they are . 
  i still cringed though . 
  it was n't the comment in itself and it was n't that i thought it was racist . 
  it 's that i could clearly see the other 2 news anchors thought so . 
  their reaction is what made the video for me . 
  it 's not . 
  that goes against every fundamental rule of software design . 
  i 'm not exaggerating when i say they first teach this to you during the first two weeks of studying computer science and they keep reminding you until you graduate . 
  it 's like `` do n't point the gun at anything you 're not prepared to shoot '' or one of those rules . 
  no matter how good you get you keep following it . 
  oooooh i get it . 
  but college is full of amazing classes . 
  we 've had classes like a robot building competition and a class where we design and implement a bot for dota 2 etc. 
  it 's the one place where classes are actually interesting since you got to pick the subject . 
  if you do n't think building a functioning robot sounds like fun then you just pick another major . 
  it 's not like middle school where everyone has to go though the same classes . 
  no they do n't . 
  in three years i remember having one `` general class '' that was basically `` how to study in college 101 '' . 
  everything else has been stricly related to my major/field . 
  i 'm not . 
  i major in cs with a minor in math and other than that week 1 `` welcome to college '' class i have n't had a single class that was n't either cs or math . 
  i seriously doubt someone who does n't study one of the two would have to attend any of them . 
  no you should n't . 
  you would n't be allowed to do that to any other person , i do n't get why assaulting a child would become ** less ** serious because you happen to be its parent . 
  there 's no other laws that would follow this logic . 
  raping your wife is rape , stealing from your brother is stealing . 
  assaulting your child is an assault . 
  i 'm pretty sure civ v actually allows stacking ships in cities despite not allowing stacking military units normally . 
  i play civ5 on my computer and civ rev on my phone so i sometimes get the features mixed up . 
  especially when ships suck in both . 
  it 's not just that they see online multiplayer as the alternative , split-screen co-op is very difficult to do . 
  you 're essentially running two games on one system and the games are already optimized to use almost full specs of the system . 
  so you have to strip it down and go through the entire game making sure it 's totally optimized for two players at every moment . 
  it 's a lot of work and depending on how your game architechture is designed it can even be impossible to pull of succesfully . 
  i do n't have english/history/etc . 
  classes . 
  i 've only had cs classes and math classes . 
  cs is my major and math is my minor . 
  is it really normal to have high school style `` general classes '' in college where you live ? 
  i could get my bachelors doing only classes you see in this [ list ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cs.helsinki.fi%2fcourses&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  do you see many `` general '' classes there ? 
  voice mail ? 
  that 's still a thing ? 
  i remember having one of those cassette deck voice mail devices in the 90s but i did n't know they ported the technology over to cell phones . 
  i do n't know about politeness , i think it 's likely just a habit . 
  she was once conditioned to doing so . 
  just yesterday i noticed my dad looking at the phone , seeing the caller id ( he even has his facebook profile set up so that the entire screen was filled by the profile picture of my sister ) , saying `` oh it 's [ sister 's name ] '' and still answering the phone by using his full name in a firm and proper tone . 
  after my sister said something he completely changed his tone to a more relaxed manner like how he usually speaks to us . 
  i do n't think he was being `` polite '' . 
  that 's just the way he answered the phone for decades . 
  i do n't think incest has different levels of `` acceptableness '' . 
  would n't it seem pretty common sense to put a protective cover on the camera that 's right behind the plate ? 
  ca n't be the first time this has happened . 
  except that it 's not just another case of `` people overhyping a game unrealistically '' . 
  there were definitely some questionable decisions made in the development , most importantly [ making compromises to get the game to run on last-gen ] ( http://www.cinemablend.com/games/destiny-isn-t-60fps-ps4-xbox-one-due-being-cross-gen-64733.html ) . 
  a lot of people were expecting the first good true next-gen game . 
  instead they got this `` transition period '' bullshit . 
   movie could be background noise, 
  i already dislike you, 
  same except without sarcasm . 
  outside an emergency there is no situation in which it 's acceptable to talk during a movie . 
  if you plan on talking , do n't put on a movie . 
  personally i like movies too much to waste a movie on a date . 
  i 'd find something else to do . 
  if i ever got a date that is . 
  sure , but later in a relationship you can sit quietly for 90 minutes and watch a movie without small-talking or having sex . 
  one of my favourites ? 
  that would only make it worse . 
  not to mention someone talking ( and not paying attention to ) a movie i know i love would annoy the shit out of me , even if i 'm not missing anything i have n't already seen . 
  you youngsters need to learn to respect movies . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  as opposed to what ? 
  my fridge is full of glass jars .
