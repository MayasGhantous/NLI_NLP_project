  i agree that there are a lot more disposable packaging solutions these days but i feel like those are primarily for items that did n't even exist back then or would n't be stored in a glass jar anyway . 
  i do n't purposfully go out to buy product in glass jars or pay extra money for them and i have 8 glass jars in my fridge ( just checked ) and 6 more in the spice rack . 
  i 'm a single male so it 's not like my fridge is especially stocked either . 
  i do n't think it makes a huge difference but i 've definitely been in situations where i 've noticed the long barrel of a bright blue m4a1-s or a white awp sticking out around a corner and thought to myself that i probably would n't have noticed that as easily if it was black . 
  do n't want to deal with pins ? 
  how is pressing 4 buttons on the device you have to have anyway more difficult than carrying around a pen and a board to write signatures with ? 
  neither one is difficult but i ca n't fathom how pins would be ** more ** difficult . 
  i do n't know about the american machines but the functionality of credit and debit cards are identical over here in europe . 
  you put the card into a little reader thingy , punch 4 buttons and press ok . credit and debit have an identical amount of key presses and take just as long to process ( about 1 second ) . 
  the device is usually sitting on the counter so you handle the paying while the bartender prepares your drink . 
  yeah but if you 're only friends with them on facebook to laugh at their stupidity , then why do you get offended and comment to complain when they do exactly what you want them to do ? 
  i do n't remember eating in a restaurant in the 21st century that did n't have portable card machines , for either credit or debit . 
  where i live ( finland ) there is no separate symbol for accepting credit or debit . 
  if the place has a `` visa '' sticker on the door it means they take credit and debit . 
  this whole idea of separating the two seems very foreign . 
  i 'm not a 100 % but i do n't think those are even legal here anymore . 
  or they are legal , but not accepted by visa or mastercard etc. 
  so practically useless . 
  i know grocery stores are required to have the type of device that you use pins on for all cards , a signature is n't a valid form of identification anymore . 
  there was a transitioning period that ended a few years ago . 
  i 'm not `` arguing '' about an american restaurant . 
  i 'm not questioning whether it 's true that us restaurants do n't take debit . 
  i 'm just surprised . 
  it 's pointless anyway because they 're never new videos , they 're the same videos anyone can download from any tracker . 
  but for some reason these people keep playing this weird cat and mouse game where one of them uploads a video to a stream site and they all try to grab it before the mods delete it . 
  it 's pretty ridiculous . 
  oh i know the mods do n't delete the submissions . 
  i was referring to how one or more of the mods contacts the proper authorities etc. 
  like you said . 
  it was just quicker to say `` delete '' since the details were n't that relevant in the context of my post . 
  yeah but meanwhile op talks like he 's also married so how old is op ? 
  there are of course exceptions but usually i 'd estimate siblings are 2-3 years apart . 
  that would make op married at 18-19 . 
  and laughing at someone proposing at 17 . 
  i cringed so badly when i heard that . 
  i can even imagine the delivery . 
  internet keyboard warrior who read a `` sassy '' comeback on tumblr trying it out on real life for the first time while everyone 's starting awkwardly at each other in silence . 
  better let the internet know how good of a burn it was . 
  the longest day of the year is a holiday in most northern countries . 
  there 's actually a surprisingly large number of countries listed in that article . 
  i do n't know about the central european countries but in sweden and finland midsummer ( midsommar , juhannus ) is the biggest holiday of the year after christmas . 
  definitely bigger than the `` national holidays '' . 
  i do n't know about the details where you live but juhannus is definitely a day off . 
  like i said it 's # 2 after christmas . 
  saying you have to work on midsommar is like saying you have to work on christmas eve . 
  emergency services only . 
  i 'd rather give those keys to a smart 16 year old than a stupid 18 year old . 
  i 've been doing something similiar since i got the shield right after getting lvl70 and the sword shortly after . 
  the big difference is i simply find akarat/akkhan too damn boring . 
  i collected the full set and used it for a while but it takes 6 ( or 5 with the ring ) pieces of armor just to buff a skill that does nothing but increase your dmg and armor . 
  it is very effective but not very interesting gameplay/build wise . 
  i replaced it with 3 pieces of blackthorne for immunities , hellrift amulet , leoric and ice climbers along with some other legendaries for useful effects . 
  codemn spamming with vacuum is still very effective even without akarat , especially since i never play alone ( usually with glass cannon dhs or wizards ) . 
  the skills i use are, 
  punish, 
  shield glare, 
  law of valor, 
  and i 'm trying to find a good one for slot # 4 to replace akarat . 
  suggestions for the last slot are welcome , i 've been trying all sorts of things for the last 3 days . 
  i might even end up using akarat without akkhan as i do n't have a problem with the skill itself , just dedicating my entire item build to it . 
  e. gems are taegok , wreath of lightning and bane of the trapped , last 2 are lvl 30 + but i have n't yet decided if i want to up taegok . 
  ` murica, 
  finns say `` kokis '' which is a bastardization of `` coke '' . 
  calling coke `` cola '' has that same feeling as your mom calling an xbox a `` nintendo '' . 
  but which portland is it ? 
  haha your parents are alcoholics . 
  enjoy your shitty genes . 
  the problem is this picture is the size of a stamp, 
  his fps while watching a demo and recording with fraps or a similiar software is n't representative of his fps in-game when this happened . 
  i liked that money actually held value . 
  you would n't just go and buy every single thing you see . 
  actually had to make choices and they felt like they mattered . 
  you commited to that first sports car you bought . 
  i 've always thought jayden has the nicest fake tits in the industry . 
  the kind that you can still believe if you want it hard enough . 
  top quality work . 
  no it was n't . 
  you can have legit parkinsons ** and ** be drunk . 
  because he 's implying that the other guy was implying her `` disability '' was indeed alcohol and not parkinson 's . 
  serious business . 
  yeah but i do n't have a chance to bang these women . 
  i 'm looking at them on the internet . 
  where i have a lot more options than to look at any woman i 'd probably bang if i had the chance . 
  because the parking space has no traffic unlike if you were backing out . 
  seems pretty simple to me . 
  when you 're pulling out of a spot the right of way is on the other drivers . 
  when you 're pulling in you 're not at fault if someone drives into you . 
  might as well do the harder maneuver ( reversing ) while you 're not at fault for possible accidents . 
  because daily mail makes up half of their stories so instead of being limited by reality they 're limited by their writers ' imagination . 
  makes for good headlines and reddit is all about that . 
  most people just read the title and upvote . 
  would be interesting if it was n't daily mail . 
  when i moved to the u.s. one of my biggest struggles was learning `` i 'm okay '' is a negative statement . 
  i was used to `` ok '' meaning `` nothing to complain about '' but suddenly i had to be doing `` great '' every fucking morning or people would keep asking `` what 's wrong ? '' . 
  is it not normal just to feel `` neutral '' on most days ? 
  in finland it definitely is . 
  maybe it 's a regional thing . 
  in the midwest `` i 'm okay '' or `` i 'm allright '' definitely seems to be understood as `` barely hanging on '' . 
  if you ca n't get over what other people think could n't you wear a basecall cap or something ? 
  those are pretty universally accepted .
