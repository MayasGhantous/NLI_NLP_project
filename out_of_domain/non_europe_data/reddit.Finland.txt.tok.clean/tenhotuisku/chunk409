  i 'm against tuning the game balance specifically with leaderboards as a priority because, 
  a. the changes will affect people ( who i believe to be a majority ) who do n't care about leaderboards and, 
  b. due to legendary gems being so incredibly good and unique to grifst every player must play them even if they do n't care about leaderboards, 
   this is the same as blizzard saying `` you have a 10 % chance to get a legendary for every five rolls , '' yesterday . 
  are you sure ? 
  because [ this blue post ] ( http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/14579177912?page=2#34 ) makes it sound like blood shards drop 5x more as well . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , in fact i 'm probably wrong but could someone explain the wording to me ? 
  i get the 33 % legendary buff , just not the 5x prices 5x drop rate thing . 
  e. nevermind , it seems you get just as many shards as you used to, 
   that does n't even begin to address the issues with new legendaries coming out and people having 100,000 shards saved up to get them instantly . 
  seeing as how there is no pvp i do n't really see how this is an `` issue '' . 
  i would n't do it myself but i do n't consider saving up a bad thing . 
  you 're giving up loot in the present to get loot in the future . 
  5 rifts takes quite a chunk of time ? 
  a rift takes about 10 minutes even if you do n't have a minmaxed character with optimal farming gear . 
  you 've never played for more than an hour at a time ? 
  how so ? 
  it would still serve everyone in the form of higher `` legendaries per inventory filled '' ratio . 
  only those who ** choose ** to save up much more than 500 would have the old issue of filling up their inventory more than once but they should be given that choice . 
  no it would n't . 
  it would still increase legendaries ( what people want ) per inventory filled by 5x, 
  even if you were still able to fill your inventory with maxed out kadala shards it 'd be five times less of an issue than it was before the patch . 
  personally i do n't understand why people play hc when bnet is acting up . 
  you can see in the chat window this was n't a `` sudden '' disconnect . 
  it was one of those days when bnet was shitting itself all day long . 
  that 's how it is most of the time , i 've never had bnet work and suddenly fail . 
  it either works perfectly or it does n't . 
  it totally has to do with everything . 
  blizzard adjusted the blood shards because it was an ** inconvenience ** to run back and forth , not because it was somehow wrong or abuse to do so . 
  the fix would work perfectly hand in hand with raised cap as the average player would still get 5x less items per bloodshard gained thus not forcing them to run back and forth like before . 
  raising/removing the cap would only give the players who ** wish to do so ** an option to do so . 
  it 's not an ** inconvenience ** if you choose to do it . 
  if anything the 500 shard cap is an ** inconvenience ** . 
  also reposting your previous statement with bolding does n't make you seem any more intelligent . 
   players could already choose to do it before this change . 
  there was nothing forcing players to save up their shards and run back and forth . 
  yes but you would have to empty your blood shards between every rift to avoid it . 
  it required effort and attention on the player 's part to empty their shards every time they visited town between rifts . 
  blizzard made it five times less of an effort to avoid having to run back and forth . 
   despite this fact , blizzard still made the change . 
  blizzard is obviously not okay with players choosing to do it . 
  if they were , they would n't have implemented this change . 
  now this is your own logic , not blizzard speaking . 
  and i simply disagree with it . 
  blizzard made everyone 's life 5 times easier with the change and i like the change , but i do n't see it as a message that running back and forth was somehow wrong . 
  it was simply ** not fun ** and this change made it five times easier to avoid having to do it if you do n't want to . 
   i 'm not sure what your point is . 
  why will increasing the cap all of a sudden remove the effort involved in not capping your shards ? 
  what 's stopping people from playing exactly as they are now ? 
  playing and saving up all their shards because apparently its sooooo much effort to remember to spend your shards every now and then . 
  every now and then ? 
  you mean every 10 minutes ? 
  i simply do n't see how you think raising the interval of shard dumps from 10 minutes to 50 minutes is less of a wanted impact than not having multiple inventories from maxed shards . 
  or maybe you do but you already started arguing so you ca n't admit it . 
  making players use their shards 5 times less often affects everyone , even people who max out before spending shards . 
  how many inventories full of items you get from maxed shards only affects those who choose to wait until max before gambling . 
   no , this is logic speaking . 
  they would have increased the bloodshard cap if they did n't agree with the logic i 'm purposing . 
  it would n't have been hard at all . 
  they clearly did n't . 
  why did n't they ? 
  it 's like you 're in the future writing this . 
  how do you know the cap wo n't be changed in the next patch or the one after it ? 
  is this the first game in which you read patch notes ? 
  it 's extremely common for things to be adjusted one at a time . 
  what is your point ? 
  trying to make it seem like buying stuff from kadala without capping is some kind of monumental task that requires so much effort and concentration is an absolute joke . 
  it 's not . 
  it was a minor inconvenience . 
  not it 's an even smaller inconvenience thanks to the patch . 
  to me making an inconvenience even smaller seems like perfectly good patching of a game . 
  not every update is about ** preventing abuse ** or ** wrong-playing ** . 
   your entire argument rests on the fact that it 's a choice with the increased bloodshard cap but not a choice now, 
  i never said it was n't a choice now . 
  it is a choice , and i usually dumped my blood shards between each rift because it was less annoying than having to run back and forth . 
  now i do n't have to and i appreciate it . 
  that does n't mean i would n't enjoy having the option to save up if at some point i wished to do so . 
  well clearly your standards for `` geared for t6 '' and mine are different . 
  geared for t6 does n't just mean you can survive t6 . 
  it seems shrines affect everyone in the party as long as they 're in the same map no matter how far away they are . 
  is this a new thing ? 
  i think the people complaining about the cap are mostly those who collect the shards on a different character than they spend them on . 
  they 're not fickle . 
  they 're 13 . 
  since when are n't biological reasons accepted explanations ? 
  pretty much everything in life has a biological reason . 
   she knew i needing cheering up a bit . 
  the doctor you mean ? 
  den glider in !, 
  i 'm not saying it is n't the fault of blizzard 's bad netcode . 
  i 'm saying bnet either seems to work perfectly all day or lag out periodically for an entire day or at least for many many hours at a time . 
  if i logged into my hc character and realized it was `` one of those days '' like the guy in the picture obviously did i would log out or switch to a sc character . 
  play hc only when i have the least reason to expect lagspikes . 
   to me every day is one of those ( laggy ) days . 
  maybe you should get a better internet connection instead of blaming bnet . 
  bnet is far from perfect , but i have any sort of connection problems ** at all ** once or twice a month at most . 
  and i play almost daily . 
  do you have a recipe for the dough ? 
  it looks delicious . 
  start by moving to finland and the rest will come naturally .
