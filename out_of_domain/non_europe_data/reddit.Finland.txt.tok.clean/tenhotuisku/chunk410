  in northern europe donald duck is the # 1 disney character . 
  the disney magazine that features stories from all the characters is called `` donald duck magazine '' or `` donald duck & co '' ( kalle anka , anders and , aku ankka ) since donald duck is the main character and others like mickey mouse are seen as minor side characters mostly used as filler . 
  in fact it seems most people hate mickey mouse for being an annoying know-it-all while donald duck is seen as the relatable one . 
  yeah but dark souls 2 is fan fiction so it should n't really be considered in the context of a dark souls 1 discussion in a dark souls 1 sub . 
  it 's gta . 
  i think dirty racing should be expected . 
  if you want to race like in a simulator , play a simulator . 
  i agree the idiots who purposfully drive the circuit backwards or something just to crash into others are idiots , but crashing into your opponents with the goal of taking them out and winning the race is ** a part of the game ** . 
  think of it like burnout . 
  yeah but it 's pretty and free to try out . 
  if you like semi-casual racing games like i do it 's probably going to be loads of fun even if it is n't reinventing the genre . 
  different meaning something that no game has ever done before ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  the free dlc tracks is a nice touch though , not too common in racing games . 
  well i have n't played the game myself but i 've watched a bunch of video footage and read/listened to what people who have played the game have said and to me it seems like they took ideas from all these other racing games and then combined them under true next gen graphics running on a new engine built from scratch . 
  so basically it 's like a `` foundation '' type of game for ps4 racers . 
  i 'd be surprised if this engine wo n't get used in the future . 
  for me personally a `` functional '' and fun racing game designed purely for ps4 is enough to get excited about as the ps4 does n't yet have that wide of an array of games that appeal to me . 
  but i understand if some people wo n't be too thrilled about a game that does n't offer much innovation outside the graphics engine . 
  our ancestor hunted to stay alive , not because it was a fun activity on the weekends . 
  that being said i have gone hunting and it is indeed fun so i 'm not judging anyone , just saying there 's a difference . 
  i do n't think you even read what i posted . 
  it 's free to try out so i 'm trying it out as a tech demo . 
  if i like what i see i 'm buying it as a game i tried and liked . 
  besides what 's so inherently bad about a tech demo ? 
  it 's a new console , i 'd love to see some proper tech demos to see what they can do with the hardware . 
  we 're going to be stuck with it for about a decade so it 's not like they wo n't have time to make deeper games on the foundation laid by ( theoretically , too soon to tell ) games like driveclub . 
   i actually understands why he want to call you instead of texting . 
  i have n't been able to call with my phone ( or i can * call * , but the microphone 's broke ) for about 9 months now and i have n't bothered to take it to a repair shop even though it 's under warranty because in those 9 months i have n't needed the calling function . 
  texting is easier , faster and free . 
  it leaves a permanent log and i can do it despite my surroundings . 
  it 's also more convenient as the recipient does n't have to answer on that exact second but 5 minutes later if that suits him better without the hassle of `` call you back '' etc. 
  the entire video is good ( though the footage is from an older build ) if you 're interested in comments from someone who 's played the game himself but the part i specifically linked to talks about the questions you made . 
  yes they do . 
  that 's one of the reasons i linked it to you , you 're not the only one with this question . 
  i 'm not a marketing guy hired by sony to only post you positive feedback about the game . 
  btw i looked into this `` project cars '' you talked about and it seems to be a hardcore simulator , at least that 's what they 're marketing it as . 
  so clearly not a direct competitor for driveclub . 
  the creation of the united states is the most impactful event in the history of humanity ? 
  what the fuck do they teach you guys over there ? 
  i 'm watching the gamescom footage from a month ago right now and it 's hardly even on the same level graphically as driveclub . 
  steam engine, 
  not really . 
  it looks better than the year old footage from driveclub but i have to say i prefer the look of the new driveclub videos . 
  project cars seems to have very high quality textures and that sort of `` moddy '' plain look where as driveclub has much better lighting effects and overall looks more polished . 
  not to mention you 're comparing pc footage to a console game . 
  i do n't mean `` new '' as in the newest footage out there . 
  i mean new as in the last 3-4 months nearing release . 
  one egg , protein and cheese sandwich please . 
  i do n't because it sounds like fucking shit . 
  i 'd rather play blind than use in-game voice . 
  actually i would rather not play if i was forced to use in-game voice . 
  it 's better to give him a chance to go 3-12 than to guarantee he 'll go 2-13 . 
  oh no a comic forced you to stop and think for 2 seconds ? 
  how about some more `` ow my balls !, 
  no one said anything about an anti-eco, 
  i doubt it would work . 
  the whole point of the movie is the video game-y approach . 
  that 's what makes it special as far as movies go . 
  if you made it into a video game it 'd be just another video game . 
  a video game that resembles a video game is n't a very good of a gimmick , is it ? 
  you 'd be left with guys in exo-skeleton suits shooting aliens . 
  again , a theme already very common in video games . 
  cool to see in a movie , boring in a video game . 
  are these sound effects really necessary ? 
  i expected a scientific podcast and got a weird lsd trip . 
  if you 're going to use wikipedia as the source for your til at least link to the relevant part of the article . 
  the whole article is 7000 words long not including the references . 
  i would n't say it `` bombed '' . 
  it did [ double it 's budget ] ( http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=allyouneediskill.htm ) already so while it 's not a huge hit that 's usually considered the treshold for a `` success '' or at least `` not a flop '' . 
  if you play this game solo you 're already punishing yourself . 
  besides the way it works with my friends is they all save up machines/materials until we got at least 3 people in a party . 
  nobody goes to hellrifts alone because it 's like sacrificing potential loot for nothing . 
  so it has the positive effect of getting people together . 
  higher level gems and the feeling of progression ? 
  why do you even keep playing if you do n't want the game to get harder and challenge yourself ? 
  might as well do something else . 
  sounds like you play public games . 
  that 's your problem . 
  it 's not that good . 
  the visuals are great and i appreciate trying something new ( inb4 groundhog day , new within the genre ) but in the end it 's just kinda falls flat . 
  i saw it knowing nothing but the name and that tom cruise is in it so it was better than i expected . 
  having googled the movie afterwards i 'm shocked how much they give away in advertising . 
  basically 60 % of the plot . 
   yeah good , there nothing more annoying then seeing someone stand in front of these things for hours on end . 
  why ? 
  i understand if there 's people waiting in line but if there is n't what 's wrong with playing these for hours ? 
  when i was a kid ** without my own playstation ** me and my friend played through all of spyro 1 & 2 at the local electronics store . 
  good memories . 
  i later got a playstation for christmas from that same store . 
  another local department store had a 4 n64 setup in a half-circle all running goldeneye in lan . 
  90s were awesome . 
  it 's not good form for a football tackle , because it is n't one . 
  looks pretty good for a judo-type takedown . 
  or bjj or whatever i 'm not an expert on the specifics , but you know good form when you see it . 
  well if you think about the japanese flag and take out the red part , what 's left ? 
  you must be pretty fucking retarded to not be able to do this 2 seconds worth of reasoning . 
  idk maybe i 'm just not autistic enough for this site but i clearly remember asking people `` can i have a try '' or them asking me if they can try it out etc. 
  and we never had an issue or an argument . 
  true but i do n't think it 's my responsibility ( as a 10-13 year old ) to back away from the console every 15 minutes in case someone else would fancy a try but ca n't be bothered to open his mouth .
