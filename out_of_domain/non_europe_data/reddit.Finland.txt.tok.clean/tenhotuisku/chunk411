  i never disagreed with someone if they came up and asked if they could play , i just took up all the time whenever there was no one else playing them . 
  having the latest game releases and consoles that i could n't afford even if i saved all my allowances for years is too good to pass on just because `` someone might want to play but is n't going to bother '' . 
  what about a small dick nobody wants to suck ? 
  so many fucking people thought `` gamecube is less powerful than ps2 '' it drove me mad . 
  it had almost double the processing power !, 
  i sold my ps2 to afford a gc and did n't regret it for a second . 
  best exclusives of that generation . 
  made me twice as pissed when nintendo did what they did . 
  i think most people agree that 360 controller was the best controller of all time and took a lot of influences from the gc controller . 
  it was like the perfected adult version of wavebird . 
  that being said it did n't exist back when gc did , so wavebird was absolutely superior to ds2 or the original xbox controller whatever it was called . 
  at that point in history it was the best controller ever made . 
  yeah but i do n't think the general public has had enough experience with the next gen consoles to declare a universally agreed opinion yet . 
  for one i think the ps4 controller seems like a huge improvement to ps3 . 
  interesting if it 'll challenge the 360/bone . 
   security was not less than normal ( at least 30 meters distance ) , they think that either the brakes did not work or the gas pedal was stuck . 
  it 's not like you should prepare for the worst case scenario when designing your security systems . 
  yeah and who the fuck cares about the `` idea '' when the reality is they 'll always be filled with people aged 10-15 ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  ususally there 's a non-intuitive way of reading it that makes sense . 
  you thc amp ? 
  i 'm trying to read it up to down , right to left , everything and the only thing i can make up is electric guitars and weed . 
  what 's it supposed to say ? 
  itt people who 've never lived near an oean . 
  holy shit . 
  thanks . 
  genuinely, 
  yeah because everything weed-related should be compared to alcohol , right ? 
  alcohol is one of the most potent drugs out there . 
  being not as bad as alcohol does n't mean the drug ca n't have negative side effects . 
  but he 's doing it professionally with ads etc , so your second sentence does n't hold up . 
  the cannabinoid , dronabinol , which is found in marijuana , is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately as a prescription medication .

  til some people consider coming inside a luxury, 
   well ok then , looks like jack will be dying within a week . 
  yeah because everything is either toxic to the point of lethality or perfectly harmless . 
  i did copy webmd . 
  because only a fucking idiot needs to be told the negative effects of cannabis . 
  if he really wants to know more details let him google it himself . 
  come back when you graduate high school . 
  it 'd be pretty sad to be a ~ 50 year old with the nickname `` xxxx420xxxxx '' and the mindset of a 13 year old stoner . 
  inside always seemed like the most natural and `` default '' place to finish . 
  everything else is a bonus you have to negotiate . 
  good comeback dude . 
  who 's patronizing anyone ? 
  all i meant was i 've always considered coming inside the most basic way of finishing sex . 
  i never thought some people consider it was a rare treat or a special thing ( any more than having sex in general is ) . 
  i think i finished inside dozens of times before i first got the courage to ask a girl if i could finish elsewhere . 
  you know what `` one of the '' means , right ? 
  all religions have people who `` spread the word '' and try to give their religion a nice reputation , usually trained professionals . 
  since atheism is n't a religion that same `` responsibility '' often falls to people who are n't really ideal for representing anything . 
  that and a lot of people stuggle understanding that there is no `` organized atheism '' like with most religions . 
  when they see someone do something `` in the name of atheism '' they actually expect that to be the `` teachings '' of atheism . 
  when really such a concept does n't exist . 
  well as far as i myself am conserned it 's the same thing . 
  patrionizing is n't something you can do without intent to patrionize . 
  you 're just misinterpreting because apparently you 're a bit too sensitive or something . 
  i do n't really care as it does n't change the fact that my original motive was not to patrionize anyone . 
  oh my god for as long as i 've played i 've been complaining to my friends how we need a `` effective dps '' counter or something like that . 
  this seems to do exactly that . 
  if i theoretically got banned for this , would it only affect diablo or other bnet games as well ? 
  \\  good pair of headphones, 
  stay pleb, 
  look at the guy . 
  his hair has grown into one solid block of mold . 
  do you really think he 's in a state of mind where `` telling him it was a prank later '' totally makes up for it ? 
   come on , look at this poor guy , dirty clothes , trolley full of stuff that is most likely all he owns in the world . 
  not only that in the full video you can see his hair has grown into a weird block of mold that probably also functions as a pillow . 
  that 's not makeup done for the scene and there is no person with a sane mind who would n't cut that off no matter how homeless they were . 
  that moment when midway through a panic lie you realize you actually had no reason to lie but you already started talking so it 's too late to turn back now . 
  yeah and you 'd have to pull it out in a perfect angle . 
  op is going to get angry at his peppershaker in less than a week . 
   and if the `` entire t team '' would sit in spawn and spam , just take your time going to b ? 
  because you 'll always know exactly what your opponent is doing , right ? 
  yeah but the update reworked how the game handles penetration . 
  they did n't actually change the doors in that update , they just fiddled with how materials such as a wooden door ** like ** the ones in d2 are penetrated . 
  then they later added a duct tape and glue type of solution by switching the d2 doors to metal . 
  there is no simple way to `` bring back pre-update doors '' because in the current game those doors do n't exist . 
  but you 're right , people would want it to resemble the pre-update doors more . 
  cs : go devs should probably make a new type of door into the game , does n't seem like ** too much ** work given that it 's a defining characteristic of the most played map in the game . 
  those old `` pre-update doors '' and the `` post-update doors '' are the exact same doors . 
  they just act differently because they changed how to game handles penetration . 
  there is no way to `` bring back pre-update doors '' .
