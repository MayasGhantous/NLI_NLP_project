  it does n't happen when there 's a guy in the middle of your screen defusing and two dead bodies lying out in the open . 
  it 's probably just psn, 
  moving my cursor 50px further to the right to reach `` maps '' when i search for a place is much less of an effort than reading all the options every time because i ca n't rely on muscle memory . 
  if you feel that strongly about the term it 's clearly working . 
  love it, 
  it 's so old it 's retro, 
  op is europe-poor . 
  i do n't think the problem was he said u.s has nice places . 
  there are definitely nice places in the u.s. 
  he said the u.s. has places nicer than anywhere else in the world which is not really something you can say of any country . 
  it 's a stupid and ignorant thing to say . 
  that 's why he got downvotes . 
  you do n't smoke enough weed . 
  it 's a steam game . 
  worst case scenario you verify local files or redownload . 
  i do n't agree with the first yellow card but i totally agree with the second one . 
  refs should be untouchable . 
  that 's how it is in every other sport . 
  seeing players grab the ref or yell right to their face disgusts me . 
  my least favourite part of football . 
  that 's not a tap , that 's a grab . 
  totally worth a yellow card . 
  i do n't think the celebration should 've gotten one though . 
  yes they are in every other sport . 
  there is no justificable amount of touching a ref in hockey or american football for example . 
  those are supposed to be barbaric grunt sports and even they have more respect for refs than gentlemen football players . 
  because it 's a zero tolerance thing . 
  you do n't touch the ref , end of discussion . 
  then there is no issue of differentiating between what is `` too much '' or `` aggressive '' etc. 
  i agree it was n't agressive but it should n't need to be in order to get carded . 
  untouchable means there is no acceptable amount of touching . 
  once you start allowing `` light taps '' or `` little grabs '' it 's a slippery slope that leads to the constant grabbing and touching that you see now in southern american leagues and some european leagues as well . 
  much better for everyone involved to have clear cut line `` no touching '' so there 's no dispute on whether or not someone deserved a card and someone else did n't etc. 
  besides the ref does n't give a shit if you `` want to talk to him '' about the card you were given . 
  players always complain and it 's not gon na change a thing . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was intended as a second yellow and just sloppy execution by the ref . 
  you do n't need to get the attention of a ref that turns away from you . 
  how is that such a hard concept to understand ? 
  ref does n't care what you think about the card . 
  it 's not a part of the game that should be `` accomodated '' . 
  oh i agree completely . 
  i blame poor reffing for most of the physical contact they get . 
  if you let something go unpunished even though it 's in the rule book you should n't be surprised when players start doing it . 
  i do n't think that 's a reason to bitch about the one ref that trys to do it right though . 
   just watch a regular match this weekend and look how often the ref is touched, 
  i know . 
  that 's why i said, 
   my least favourite part of football . 
  watch a regular match of rugby or hockey or american football or basketball or any sport and see how many times a ref is touched . 
  even slightly . 
  if it 's not zero i 'm very surprised . 
  it does n't make you permanently that forgetful if that 's what you 're asking . 
  it can make you forget simple things while under the effect though . 
  like opening a can of coke and then grabbing a new one after one sip etc. 
  i 've noticed a huge difference when i 've soaked it overnight . 
  using some alcohol and salts just gets it `` clean '' . 
  soaking it in isopropyl alcohol for a few hours or more before adding the salt gets it looking like brand new . 
  you can also use rice if you do n't want to waste expensive coarse salt . 
  it 's not like that 's the only effect . 
   i do n't even like the feeling of being buzzed when drinking alcohol because i know i 'll feel like shit later, 
  well that 's a completely different issue . 
  there is no hangover or an unpleasant `` coming down '' with weed . 
  even if he did make an error that 's something he reviews with his supervisors after the game . 
  not something he discusses with the players during the game . 
  how many fonts can you fit in one bag of cough drops ? 
   not the ones available in walmart, 
  that 's not really true . 
  they 're not available in supermarkets in finland but in the u.s. there 's much less of a difference between what you 're allowed to sell in pharmacies and in supermarkets . 
  they even have pharmacies inside walmarts so you can get perscription medication from walmart . 
  they also sell basic medication like aspirin or ibuprofein at gas stations . 
  that would be extremely illegal in finland . 
  i 'm kinda the opposite because i 'm really glad i did n't play it last gen because i 'm sure it could n't have been as immersive and i 'm totally loving it . 
  i doubt i would 've paid for it again had i played it . 
  kinda like ruining a good movie by watching a camrip but you 're not gon na watch it again once it comes on on bluray . 
  yeah did n't this game `` go gold '' 3 months ago ? 
  is sony really so cheap they ca n't buy more servers for a game they 've been hyping for the last year ? 
  do n't they realize how terrible pr this is ? 
  ps + users not buying one game does n't sound like much of a backlash for sony . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't . 
  i do n't know , i can definitely tell it 's 1080p and not 600p or whatever most last-gen games were . 
  i guess it now looks more like the pc version did 2 years ago . 
  that 's good enough for me . 
  yeah but this article is n't about whether or not this guy acted like a perfect saint and did everything right . 
  it 's about the fact that this :, 
   `` i thought he 'd do a perfectly fine job , but it just felt inappropriate to have a white man there , '' the student behind the so-called `` campaign to abstain '' said . 
   `` it 's not just about that position either , '' the student added . 
  `` having men in elected leadership positions undermines the idea of this being a place where women are the leaders . '', 
  seems to be a socially acceptable and reasonable thing to say . 
  i 'm not saying the guy is n't a douche but i could totally see `` what 's up babe '' just being friendly banter . 
  you can execute that type of hairstyle well or poorly . 
  this one is executed well . 
  seems like a cultural difference . 
  i do n't see `` babe '' as being a creepy word at all . 
  i know it can be used to refer to a significant other but i 've seen it used a lot as simply a replacement for `` girl '' . 
  last time i saw him he was just as big as he was in superbad if not bigger, 
  but they are double v 's !, 
  why would you call it a `` double u '' when it 's obviously two v 's next to each other . 
  just look at it : ** w ** does that look round like a ** u ** to you ? 
  damn i was hoping that was a real sub,
