  sure there 's no way to be absolutely sure there is not a single homeless within the city limits 100 % of the time but you can do a hell of a lot more than in a free country . 
  while i agree with the idea your promoting, 
   how about this : buy retail , smoke less, 
  that 's about the shittiest advice you can give to anyone . 
  `` why do n't you just smoke/drink/eat / take less of it ? '', 
  nhl gamecenter works like that as long as you 're not in the us . 
  every game , every `` market '' ( i do n't even know what that means ) , both broadcasts ( away and home team announcers ) for every single game during the season and playoffs . 
  it 's strange for me to think that some people in the u.s pay money for a service to watch sports ** and ** have blackouts . 
  it 's one or the other for me . 
  watch free and suffer the network bullshit or pay and enjoy without worrying . 
  it 's weird to see this sub full of `` i 'd cut the cord '' or `` if x happened then i would n't pay for cable '' etc. 
  is tv still really that common in some places ? 
  i know old people watch it but among my 20-25 year old friends i can name maybe two or three who are able to receive tv . 
  some have * a tv * as an xbox/playstation screen but it 's rarely hooked up to any kind of tv network . 
  and that 's just free tv . 
  i do n't know a single person who 'd have pay channels . 
  if we get together to watch a game it 's either a. at an establishment like a sports bar b. an internet stream . 
  oh it 's a default now ? 
  well that explains a lot . 
   like that in the us as well, 
   you get each broadcast of every game ** except ** ... 
  clearly it 's not like that in the us as well . 
  not being able to see your local sports team ( usually the sports team one cares about the most ) seems like a big drawback . 
  i think he was talking about medical insurance . 
  if someone runs into you he should have to cover all your expenses , whether you have medical insurance or not . 
  great movie , though i was kinda hoping ** spoilers **, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ wouldve ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ killed ^ ^ ^ ^ off ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ girl ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ end . 
  ** spoilers **, 
  yeah i did n't want it to happen because i enjoy that kind of thing , but because they kinda went there already and the backpedaling ruined the atmosphere a bit . 
  a big factor why i like korean/hk movies is that they often do things hollywood movies are afraid to . 
  it tastes like sugar and water, 
  how about you just buy winter tires if you 're going to be driving in an area where you need winter tires . 
   the sad thing is , i think g4 if it came out now could be something if they showed streams of lol , dota 2 , star craft , and other games like that . 
  or not , esports has existed for a long time . 
  when i was a kid we had a tv station ( moon tv ) that started out as a video game station . 
  they expanded to other entertainment programming but still regularly showed casted counter-strike matches . 
  this was over 10 years ago . 
  g4 did n't even exist back then . 
  g4 could 've done it too were they interested . 
  and that was just one channel i grew up with , i 'm sure the world is full of similiar stories . 
  65m in the u.s. is probably a big chunk of the worldwide cable audience and then the figure does n't sound so large . 
  tv is already largely forgotten in the rest of the world . 
  developing countries are just skipping the whoel thing . 
  yes it is . 
  except if you live in some shitty ass house like most americans on this site seem to . 
  do you also feel the difference in the shower if someone flushes the toilet ? 
  that 's a sign of shitty plumbing . 
  this is the stupidest idea i 've read in a while, 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's talking about the current situation in the fast food industry etc. 
  just because they had some questionable beliefs does n't make nazi technology at the time any less impressive . 
  slowed it down and looks like between the knees to me . 
  hate of the `` system '' or their own place in it projected onto wealthy looking individuals ? 
  i do n't know . 
  has she even done a video with the third pair ? 
  they 're like two years old and all i can find is old material . 
  actually i think those 2 pics are old enough that she was just using crazy push up techniques . 
  her current boobs are fake as fuck though . 
  seems like a mediocre lenght url to me . 
  i 'm not saying the guy acted wrong when he decided to use deadly force but, 
   the officer , christopher manney , did not use excessive force when he shot hamilton 14 times , flynn said, 
  seriously ? 
  14 times ? 
  and that 's just the shots that connected . 
  if you truly need 14 shots to stop an unarmoured civilian then maybe it 's time to invest in heavier weaponry . 
   aaaaand i can confidently say you 've never shot a gun in your life, 
  actually i 've served in the military for 9 months and visited the local gun range as a hobby for years . 
  i mostly shoot skeet and trap though . 
  i 've also shot a deer if you 'd like a picture of it ? 
  i 'm also for gun rights but i guess that would n't fit your straw man would it . 
  it 's not dumb because it 's extremely difficult . 
  it 's dumb because if you do fail there 's serious consequenses for very little payoff if you succeed . 
   it still saddens me how much disrespect he is getting from practically everyone seeing as he was the best goalkeeper for almost 10 years , and one of the best to ever play for real madrid . 
  while i do n't think he was `` the best '' but do agree that he was `` one of the best '' i have to question : if you were really one of the best goalkeepers in the world for a decade , do you really care what people say about you ? 
  i 'm pretty sure he has a healthy self image and does n't read the tabloids or sports magazines to find out what people think of him . 
   you would be wrong to choose someone else out of those two while they both are still playing like this . 
  but it would n't . 
  i know this might be hard for you to comprehend but some people genuinely feel like neuer is playing better in his position than ronaldo or messi in their respective positions . 
  if i were a manager , i 'd rather have neuer than messi or ronaldo . 
  i 'm not saying my opinion is the only correct one and anyone who thinks messi has a bigger impact on the field is simply wrong , but it is an opinion nevertheless . 
  in my mind when neuer plays he has a bigger influence on that game than any other player out there in the world . 
  that 's why i think he 's the best player in the world . 
  that 's not hating on messi or ronaldo or `` giving the award to someone else for the sake of giving it to someone else '' . 
  it 's simply awarding the best player in the world , in any position . 
   he was not the best player at the world cup either , and once again he was also not the best player on his national team . 
  i disagree . 
  you 're stating your opinions like they are facts . 
  marines also require/benefit from micro more than any other `` tier 1 unit '' . 
  maybe even more than any unit in the game . 
  i think it 's great blizzard made this very simple basic unit so powerful in the right hands . 
  it 's fun to both watch and play with marines . 
  not really . 
  the military i served in uses 7.62 x39mm rounds in their standard issue rifle and was n't involved in iraq . 
  that banter was so awkward and forced, 
  do you often smoke a bong if you do have plans in the next few hours ? 
  i 've been smoking weed for about a decade now and i must say i 've never thought `` i have responsibilities to fill in the next few hours , i 'm only taking one hit off this bong '' . 
  vaporizing does n't get you higher than smoking . 
  it 's just more efficient . 
  source : own 4 different vaporizers . 
  you have the same standards with people in the real world and online ? 
  that 's pretty strange considering you can nitpick on the internet with an endless selection of naked ladies .
