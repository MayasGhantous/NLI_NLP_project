  there 's plenty of carriages that you did n't see in the movie . 
  because it 's a pretty decent movie . 
  why are people `` feeling bad for him '' ? 
  it was a race , he lost by dying . 
  if it was a technical issue or something i 'd understand but losing is a natural part of a race . 
  i 'm sure he did n't mind too much either . 
  someone always loses in a race . 
  only an american would be stupid enough not to know about landscape mode . 
  you should post this to / r/sexytummies, 
  / r/shittyreactiongifs, 
  so instead of hiring/assigning ( valve is a big company with many projects ) all these graphic design guys to work on cs : go maybe they should organize so that some guys with actual coding knowledge could take a look at it prioritizing the gameplay over aesthetics in the next couple of updates ? 
  this whole `` people who do x ca n't do y '' is the biggest cop-out in the video gaming industry . 
  i hope you 're not talking about the ds version . 
  so you do n't have to bother putting them on every time there 's sound involved ? 
  do you turn off the lights whenever you 're not looking for something ? 
  i do n't know about you but i 'm rarely on a computer without any music . 
  he also said he uses his computer to listen to music . 
  i 'm not saying that is n't true but i do n't know a single person who did laundry while living at home nor have i ever heard of it being a `` thing '' . 
  i have however heard dozens of stories about `` the first few times i did the laundry '' after moving out . 
  i know the rules say `` no scripted movie/tv '' but this is at least supposed to be from a documentary http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3439314/, 
  i was wondering how this comment still existed but then i realized this is n't / r/creepypms . 
  that sub has the worst mods and rules of any sub in existence . 
  so if i mute obs from windows mixer i wo n't hear it but it 'll still play for the stream ? 
  thanks !, 
  e. does n't work like that . 
  you clearly stopped reading at the word `` volume '' . 
  good idea !, 
  there was also a guy who drank a glass of his own piss because of a bet on reddit but i ca n't remember the thread or video url . 
  finland and 9.95 $ / mo for 100mbit and it 's not even a student internet or anything like that . 
  10 years ago swedish internets were way ahead of ours but i guess the progress kinda halted over there ? 
  at least neither of us have to deal with data caps like i 've heard they do in the uk . 
  this whole `` everybody 's equally master race '' thing this sub has recently been circlejerking feels awfully like something they teach in kindergarten . 
  if you 're pc runs games worse than a console you 're just as peasant as a ps4 gamer . 
   he 's aware he does n't know shit . 
  but he 's still sitting there making this video about his new pc he knows nothing about . 
  he 's showing off how little he knows . 
  it 's like he 's proud of not having a clue . 
  he 's showing off his new pc which he knows will be pleasant to use even if he does n't know what the individual parts do . 
  and he 's right . 
  you just sound butthurt because this obnoxious kid has a better pc than you do . 
  yeah but who cares what it 's called . 
  it looks about the same . 
  / r/creepypms has a rule that you ca n't comment saying a pm is n't creepy . 
  it apparently discourages posting if anything but comments that agree with op are allowed . 
  it 's extremely easy to get banned from / r/morbidreality, 
  for example posting any sort of reaction gif will get you banned . 
  i seriously do n't understand this post or how it got upvotes . 
  this pic is years old, 
  this picture looks the same as my desktop when i crank up the digital vibrance to 100 % #justcsgothings, 
  i did play a few games but i guess everyone 's already shouting in mumble at that point so i missed it . 
  e. weird . 
  i just started a solo queue match and there was definitely nothing before `` 10 seconds remaining '' ( ranked all pick ) . 
  just started a second game with a different announcer . 
  no `` welcome to dota '' this time either : ? 
  season 6 ? 
  holy shit . 
  i thought the show was starting to run out of steam by the end of second season . 
  does n't seem to work too well then, 
  i actually ran an antivirus check and an anti adware/malware check and both came back clean . 
  the windows ( 8.1 ) install is only about a month old . 
  no it 's wired . 
  yea i 'm not surprised if there 's lag since it 's valve 's own crappy servers . 
  i 'm just wondering if its lag at all . 
  yeah heros `` rubber banding '' sounds like a typical way occurance caused by lag . 
  that or `` i swear to god i activated _____ before _____ '' and commands not going thru . 
  i 've never had this `` game freezing for half a sec '' thing with network related issues . 
  to be fair the title does n't say he 's contradicting himself . 
  it 's just pointing out the irony in the situation . 
  i do n't watch his stream myself but i browse the `` top channels '' section on twitch quite often and it 's usually between 10k and 20k viewers . 
  he does n't make money from winning games . 
  he makes money from being entertaining to his viewers . 
  not to say he is n't good at the game , but there 's really no reason for him to `` rage quit '' . 
  or starcraft . 
  it 's even called blink . 
  hardly a new concept . 
  yeah fuck skill and practice giving an advantage, 
  960 except if youre within 960-1200 range of a certain spot near fountain . 
  double clicking works as if you clicked next to the fountain . 
  the past broadcasts tab is not available on the mobile app . 
  hold down alt while hovering and it shows more detailed stats such as the 960/1200 blink distance . 
  10 % of the 100 % you just took away from russia two decades earlier . 
  just because you smoke in a car does n't mean you drive stoned . 
  when i was younger we often smoked and `` hung out '' in a parked car because it 's cold out where i live and none of us had our own apartments yet . 
  play cards for an hour or two or just talk shit . 
  i had an old school volvo with seats like a sofa so it was n't bad at all . 
  [ nokia 5510 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_5510 ) had the same feature back in 2001 . 
  and if you wanted to copy songs from a cd you did n't have to bother with computer or software or anything , just plug in a 3,5 mm cable like any normal headphones and you could record off of a cd player or anything else that has a standard headphone jack . 
  you could even plug it into a tv and record mtv . 
  shit was cash . 
  and that 's why you drink even more, 
  yeah and the russian soldiers feared execution ( with good reason ) if they were to retreat so they did n't really have a choice but to fight despite realizing a situation was heavily unfavourable for them . 
  even if the officers on the battlefield were adept they were hindered by not having the option to not take a fight or fall back and regroup . 
  the finnish recognized this and adapted their tactics accordingly emphasizing `` trapping '' the enemy forces http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salients,_re-entrants_and_pockets#motti, 
  just because it 's a lambo does n't mean you have to drive it at full speed . 
  you can hurt someone else just as badly driving your mom 's minivan . 
  you could also plug it into a computer and copy the audio files that way . 
  this was just an additional method . 
  / r/shittytumblrgifs is that way, 
   if anyone could point me to a place where i can watch football without the bullshit that would be great, 
  torrentleech has ( almost ) every nfl game with all the ads cut out .
