  what are you talking about , they 're borderline perfect, 
  two side buttons but they 're used for zoom in/zoom out . 
  it 's a really good mouse for gaming ( zowie ec2 evo ) so i 'm not about to change it . 
  rmb also holds your breath . 
  if you use rmb every time you want to zoom in you waste a `` breathe in cycle '' . 
  this comment was so euphoric i grew a fedora on my head just by reading it . 
  that yulsaria 's glacier with the arcana looks [ amazing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vaf6deb.jpg ) . 
  now i really want to get the set . 
  til someone other than swedes and canucks fans finds sedins likable . 
  rivals of sweden as well . 
  well it 's the end of the round . 
  you could have 10 + k in the bank and no nades left . 
  yeah the quest design is really lazy and there 's basically ~ 10 different weapons in the game . 
  say you want to make a character who uses `` two handed axes '' . 
  you 'll use the same fucking axe from start to finish except it changes color and `` material '' along the way . 
  `` bronze two-handed axe '' to `` steel two-handed axe '' to `` ebony two-handed axe '' . 
  they did n't even bother to change the model , just the colours . 
  it 's all the same . 
  the environments look beautiful but other than that it 's not a very good rpg . 
  other than the eye i ca n't tell the difference between `` before '' and `` after '' other than the lighting and him smiling . 
  and he seems to have gone through a lot of surgery before the `` before '' picture . 
  yeah but the kid in the gif is n't actually terio, 
  shooting someone usually damages all their items as well . 
  getting off a living person is more beneficial . 
  also killing everyone you see gets boring really really quickly . 
  so ... facebook allows uploading this , but pictures of breastfeeding are removed ? 
  sjw mods happened . 
  the video was uploaded 3 years ago with the title `` man-dismembered-in-a-bathroom '' to a group specializing in posting gore . 
  you 're an idiot if you think facebook does n't have automated scripts that flag this kind of posts . 
  try posting porn or even non-sexual nudity and see if it takes them 3 years to take it down . 
  if their system was that shitty do n't you think the entire site would 've been run over by bots spamming porn and `` date ads '' etc. 
  i 'm saying they 're not putting much effort into actively removing this sort of content from the site . 
   i love everything about this new patch , except for this event, 
  yeah i love the arcana and the new map looks cool . 
  i was n't really even interested in trying the new game mode but thanks to the genius queueing system i ca n't play normal dota because the server 's been down for the past hour and a half . 
  on a friday night . 
  that 's a pretty shit event if you ask me . 
  yeah i just gave up and picked a different game to play , which is a shame because cm arcana is the first arcana i 've bought and overall the first time i bought an item on dota for more than a few pennies . 
  i think it 'd be pretty easy to have a word filter for `` dismembering '' . 
  i 'm sure there are actual people who look through these flagged submissions instead of it being completely automated . 
  how am i not surprised the cod `` scene '' is like this . 
  i follow the csgo scene . 
  while it 's more amateurish than the sc2 scene for example it 's nothing like this . 
  i follow the sc2 scene , csgo scene and dota2 scene pretty actively and none of them have had `` shit like this '' . 
  that 's not how the scene 's i 've followed have worked . 
  do n't skip 2 , it 's great . 
  1 was a bit of a rough diamond , it 's ok to skip that one . 
  unless they 've changed it recently that 's not true . 
  torill * e *, 
   have fun , good luck finding material . 
  empornium and every similiar site has pretty much everything she 's ever done conveniently in one package . 
  this whole cat and mouse game her subreddit likes to play is totally an illusion . 
  if you wanted to find all her videos it takes like a minute . 
  e. just to prove my point first result on empo :, 
  http://www.empornium.me/torrents.php?id=88098 `` kateelife.com - mega collection ( 60 videos ) '' uploaded by anon 1 year , 6 months ago, 
  that 's odd . 
  you should n't need an invite . 
  maybe it 's because of the valentine 's day freeleech event that 's going on . 
  anyway empo was just one example . 
  there are tons of other sites that host the same videos . 
  even [ piratebay ] ( http://www.themalaysiabay.org/search?q=kateelife ) seems to have the same 60 video pack available with no registration required . 
  that 's a stupid thing to say . 
  people constantly put money on their wallets to buy stuff from the marketplace . 
  the marketplace gives you an incentive to put money into your steam wallet . 
  yeah and our eyes adapt much better than a camera that seems to be focused on the extremely bright rink . 
  try to take a picture of your computer screen . 
  either it burns through or the camera adapts to the screen and everything around it is pitch black . 
  your eyes can probably still see just fine around the room . 
  raising suspicions about a player cheating when there 's ** a lot ** of circumstantial evidence is not spewing bullshit . 
  this whole new `` innocent until vac banned '' that came along csgo is totally ridiculous . 
  we all know from matchmaking how well vac actually works . 
  players outing other players cheating has always been part of esports and it should be . 
  in the 1.6 scene flusha would have already been banned from all major tournaments based on the evidence we 've seen . 
  the vac is just an anonymous scapegoat so nobody has to take any actual responsibility . 
  `` goal '', 
   download all the videos just in case they get taken down . 
  if you 're gon na bother downloading why not just go to piratebay or empornium any other site that always has the `` complete collection '' with no risk of it being taken down ? 
  took me 10 seconds , you 're welcome . 
  who wants to hear a good story about a bridge, 
  we all know exactly what you mean, 
  yeah they 're both people with faces, 
  but that 's mounted on the ground . 
  a bullbar is mounted on the truck . 
  also he said `` moose just pushes that thing into the hood '' . 
  the bar itself could be 100 % intact and still pushed into the truck and destroy the hood . 
  well it 's posted to r/wtf . 
  i do n't see how `` protecting your truck '' could be wtf so it would naturally bee the `` killing the deer '' part . 
   no he was pointing to the fact that the product works and how cool it is . 
  on r/wtf ? 
  a product working as intended is now `` what the fuck '' worthy ? 
  having this in their tos does n't mean they 'll actually enforce it . 
  it just means that if there ever is a situation in which they 'd like to do so they can . 
  or they claim they can , probably depends on local laws . 
  vac is n't the only form of `` proof '' . 
  in fact it 's a really , really ineffective system and this should n't be news to anyone who 's played matchmaking in the past 2 years . 
  video/demo evidence has always been considered `` proof '' , i honestly have no clue where this `` if it 's not detected by vac he must be clean '' thing started with csgo . 
  i 'm not saying the sub should decide if he 's guilty . 
  i 'm saying the community ( which largely means this sub ) has been advocating this idea that `` if vac does n't catch him he 's innocent/can ' t be banned from events '' and valve and the organizers will gladly take this break as it means less responsibility for them . 
  use the mysterious vac as a scapegoat and ultimate authority when it comes to cheating . 
  valve and the organizers are not some demigods that we bow down to .
