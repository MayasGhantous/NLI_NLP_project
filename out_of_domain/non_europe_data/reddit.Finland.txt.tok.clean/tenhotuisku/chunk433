  `` it 's a good part of the game because it 's in the game '' . 
   it 's hard to tell any difference , in fact you can gain more speed on those kz servers . 
  but they have modded their movement ; it 's impossible to really move like this in go on default settings . 
  source ? 
  i 've never noticed a difference granted i have n't played with the debug speed value box thingy open . 
  p90 is not an unusual 2nd round buy . 
  it 's moderately effective even if the other team get helmets but it 's not easy to steal a round with a dropped p90 like it would be with a rifle . 
  yeah that 's why i mentioned it separately . 
  n64 came out in fall of 1996 and the dual analog controller in april 1997 so like i said roughly the same time . 
  even the original ps1 controller was very refined and easy to use despite being inferior to the final dualshock version . 
   no , people are often to stupid to realize brilliance . 
  we 're talking about a consumer product . 
  if the people you 're selling your product to find it confusing then it is confusing . 
  no matter how `` wrong '' or `` stupid '' they are for not understanding the design . 
  yeah granted the ps3 -  ps4 was a big chance even if it does n't look visually very different . 
  the only thing you notice is the touch screen but i barely ever use that for anything and it 's still like a completely new controller . 
  the ps3 controller ( and it 's lack of improvement in 10 + years ) was the biggest single reason i prefered the 360 over it as a console . 
  this gen the controller is almost a non-issue because they 're both so good . 
  i know , i had two of them . 
  i personally think even that was a pretty decent controller and with a very refined and sleek feel unlike the n64 's which always reminded me of a wild prototype or something . 
  obviously without the sticks it was n't suited for shooters and the like but for platforming ( which was a big genre in 1996 ) they were very enjoyable to use . 
  a snes controller with better feel , added triggers and most importantly tons of ergonomics . 
  i get the feeling you 're throwing that word out almost with contempt but i 'd argue it 's the single most important thing when it comes to gaming controllers . 
  there was a lot more to the n64 than the controller and selling a lot of units does n't mean your device is perfect nor that you could n't sell more were they better . 
  an analog stick was hardly a new idea . 
  you could argue the `` two sticks , one for each thumb '' execution of sony was just as big of an innovation as the `` one stick and buttons '' approach of n64 tried and tested in arcades . 
  even the atari controller had an analog stick along with some buttons so it 's not like n64 was the first home console to use an analog stick . 
  i 'm also a big fan of the wavebird though i wished it had an additional bumper and i was never really sold on the idea of different sizes buttons as both games tended to use all the buttons pretty evenly . 
  at the time it was the most comfortable controller i had ever tried . 
  i do however feel it has been surpassed by both the 360 and ps4 . 
  that seems a bit counter-intuitive , is n't one of the main reasons to play kz improving your movement in `` real '' games ? 
  there has always been a lot of people who dislike the n64 controller . 
  you 're right people were n't outright complaining when they got to play on a brand new console right when it came out but i remember the constant hassle and discussions about `` how is this actually supposed to be used ? '', 
  even back then . 
  i never owned one but had many friends and family who did and to this day i still have n't grown comfortable with it . 
  we 're talking hundreds of hours of use and there was never a moment where i felt like it was a natural extension to my hand like the gc controller or the 360 controller . 
  hell even with the snes controller i `` forget '' i 'm holding it and just focus on the game . 
  to me playing n64 feels like walking on stilts , i 'm not just thinking what i want to do in the game but find myself regularly distracted by the physical input of the commands . 
  to me that 's a fundamental sign of a bad controller , whether it 's 1980 or 2015 . 
  i know i was n't arguing with you, 
  who said anything about me ? 
  we were talking about people in general . 
  a lot of teams buy awps/autosnipers on d2 just for the start of the round if they have extra cash on the last round of the half, 
   `` no dissent '' . 
  seriously , that 's a rule . 
  on a site that exists for discussion , their rule is `` no dissent '', 
  r/creepypms has a rule that you can not call the person not creepy nor defend their actions any way . 
  they say it would `` discourage posting '' . 
   an analog stick was hardly a new idea . 
  you could argue the `` two sticks , one for each thumb '' execution of sony was just as big of an innovation as the `` one stick and buttons '' approach of n64 tried and tested in arcades . 
  even the atari controller had an analog stick along with some buttons so it 's not like n64 was the first home console to use an analog stick . 
  well like you admit it 's a fact neither company invented the analog stick in gaming controllers nor were the first to use such technology . 
  with that in mind i think a 6 month difference is absolutely `` around the same time '' . 
  that 's less of a difference than between the ps3 and 360 releases and people generally consider those to represent the same era of gaming . 
  hell i 'm sure many do n't even remember which came first . 
   every mission is basically the same routine of ... mediocore shooting, 
  this is n't defending the game but some advice . 
  i personally played the game pretty much not shooting at all outside the boss battles . 
  i did n't plan it , it just felt right and i do feel like that was way more enjoyable compared to the few times i went `` fuck it '' guns blazing after failing a section too many times . 
  you could try playing it that way and see if it gets better , as a stealth story game it was pretty solid , despite the [ ] ( #s `` shit ending '' ) . 
  oh darn not ** actually illegal ** !, 
  that 's where i draw the line, 
  downloading movies is illegal and i do n't think that 's more trouble than it 's worth . 
  you rarely need to actually see the puck to understand where it 's at, 
  but what if they come after me with lawyers and scary letters !, 
  i better turn myself in . 
  any specific reason why ? 
  simply because that 's the one chance you get to reliably check if your spouse is cheating on you ? 
  does n't sound like a very good relationship to start with if you need a test to believe it 's your own kid . 
  i 'm not saying it 's ever a bad idea to do a paternity test , i 'm just curious why you seem so adamant on the matter regardless of the cirumstances around the birth . 
   or perhaps killing them has only furthered their hollowing , to the point they no longer resemble themselves , no longer show an identity . 
  they just deteriorate into another faceless hollow . 
  yeah this is how i viewed it too . 
  they would just become one more `` zombie '' indistinguishable from the others . 
  also we do n't know where their bonfire was . 
  i do n't think we ever see another undead really resting at a bonfire . 
  sweet meme bashing memes you got, 
  kayla kayden is not the same as kayden kross, 
  she looks about her age in this picture . 
  nintendo just does n't understand internet . 
  they have n't come far from gamecube `` broadband connector '' times . 
  maybe she wanted to see a body up close . 
  you know , kinda like everyone on this sub ? 
  well they do make for some excellent gif material, 
  it 's really good . 
  i 'm a big fan of city building games ( simcity and tropico mostly ) and i 'm loving this one . 
  especially with the extensive mod support and paradox backing them up with their previous history of excellent ( free ) dlc policies . 
  yea but policies like this make me buy them zero times . 
   much better with sound, 
  not really, 
  i get what you 're saying but i really do n't think this would work in a game like battlefield . 
  just imagine how long the ends of rounds would be if every single soldier on the losing team had to be hunt down . 
  and i can not think of any effective ways to fix that . 
  they 've probably estimated they make more money from jerseys sold to fans without ads than they would from ads . 
  it 's always about money . 
   just look at , oh i do n't know ... 
  the fucking nhl ? 
  that 's a retarded argument . 
  you 're comparing the biggest and highest valued league in the world that has the ** privilege ** to choose where they accept ads to some small `` channel one cup '' that 's probably struggling to even get funding together for the event . 
  it 's like comparing a local family business and wal-mart and bitching why they ca n't offer the same services for the same price .
