   `` and by this being sponsored by the city of austin absolutely disgust me . '', 
  how stupid do you have to be to believe it without question since it 's printed on a sticker . 
  actually if everyone was able to laugh at jokes like these then these stickers would n't had made the news . 
  well he was a contestant on big brother, 
  that would make sense seeing as how she looks about 20 . 
  well it 's pretty much the closest thing to `` awesome '' i 've seen from bfhl so far . 
  no you 're just a socially retarded loser who ca n't get an obvious joke, 
  there is no discussion outside the joke to contribute to before you forced a discussion out of the joke . 
  just say `` only a noob does n't believe in comebacks '' and they 'll start trying again . 
  how about `` you 're getting an abortion '', 
  creepypm 's is a terrible subreddit . 
  one of the rules is actually that you ca n't `` defend the creep '' . 
  this means any comments like `` i do n't see how this is creepy '' or `` maybe he was genuinely asking '' etc. 
  immidiately get deleted . 
  having more than one opinion `` discourages posting '' . 
  is that the average of players who 've set their data public to be viewed on dotabuff ? 
  because i would think the average mmr of people who know to do that much is higher than the average mmr overall . 
  you are the only one, 
  they did n't entirely put in back in . 
  i 'm running the latest 8.1 and this still had that stupid fucking start screen . 
  you have to install a 3rd party software like classic shell to get the start menu back . 
  vista was n't better than xp, 
  maybe the problem is you 're playing a shitty cod-mode in bf . 
  albeit it 's the worst mode even in cod and this new bf is basically cod but still . 
  maybe you should just play a better game like bf2 . 
  what are you talking about , bfbc2 had great spawns ? 
  unless you 're referring to the tdm mode but did anyone seriously even try that ? 
   but obviously if i 'm watching netflix or youtube or something i 'm not interested in playing anything, 
  not really . 
  you could just be passing time because you have no one to play with . 
  i have a lot of games that i would n't play alone but like playing with friends . 
  kinda like how i 'm online in steam 24/7 even though i 'm just browsing internet ( = watching youtube & netflix ) and if someone sends me a message saying `` hey we need a 5th guy for cs '' ill join the game . 
  but steak is one of the simplest foods to prepare, 
  noooo it 's pretty much `` we 'll see '' . 
  `` well , let 's watch '' to be perfectly accurate . 
  yeah why would anyone have autocorrect on ? 
  i undestand recommendations but this shit in the gif is exactly what you 're asking for if you enable this feature . 
  could be , i 've never used any of the preinstalled apps aside from textedit . 
  damn those really were some dank maymays, 
  yeah it 's in my top 5 xbox 360 games and i played ** a lot ** of games on the 360 . 
  for me the search bar text stays there in the next game but the shop view is back to basic unless i select the search bar again . 
  is it different for someone else ? 
  it 's just a keybind . 
  i never understood why not . 
  are you really stupid enough that you do n't trust yourself to not get scammed ? 
  or do you just fear human interaction ? 
  that 's like refusing to talk to people in real life because you 're afraid of pyramid schemes . 
  if you 're not a complete retard you should n't have to fear people in general not to get scammed . 
  i got calibrated at 1.3 k at level 13 and am 1.7 k now after 200 wins ( total ) playing 95 % support . 
  i have 60 % + winrate on venge , skywrath , shaman and cm . 
  it 's definitely possible to win consistently and raise in mmr playing nothing but support even in shit tier games . 
  i 'm not saying it is or it is n't but ** could n't ** that be a shift-click ? 
  you screen your calls before answering ? 
  i thought that was a joke/an urban legend . 
   leave a message, 
  is it the 1990s ? 
  i have n't even had an answering machine service set up this side of the millenium . 
  i was never talking about physical tape, 
  more like 98, 
  why not ? 
  is this like how americans think it 's irresponsible to let your kid out unsupervised but in europe you see 6 year olds playing alone outside all the time ? 
  i do n't think there 's anything odd about letting a dog run outside . 
   do n't ask him why his family immigrated here . 
  probably not because of the food, 
   sure it 's not super authentic but neither is mcdonalds . 
  i do n't think this is a very good argument . 
  since when did mcdonald 's become a point of reference whether or not something is authentic ? 
  is being better than mcdonalds really all it takes in your mind for a restaurant to be good or authentic ? 
  mcdonalds is probably the most known manufacturer of overly processed low quality mass produced fast food . 
  it 's the epitome of fast food their competitors are trying to avoid and distinguish themselves from . 
  and you 're talking like `` better than mcd '' is an accomplishment . 
  i do n't give a shit about your ancestry etc. 
  but if your favourite pizza is made by any chain you simply have n't had good pizza . 
  best food is made in small restaurants by an excellent chef who has full reign over the menu . 
  ** not ** in a chain . 
  why not go ouside and pee in the bushes or something ? 
  i 'd rather do that than in a hallway indoors . 
  vise expiring does n't mean you get instantly deported . 
  if you stay out of trouble there 's a good chance nobody will ever even know you do n't have a valid visa . 
   working, 
  also i feel like that 's the kind of thing you 'd want to see the numbers for . 
  i can only find transcripts . 
  is there audio on this site/any other site ? 
  why not just say `` when he 's older '' . 
  does n't sound stupid and conveys the same message . 
  to be fair the last time i weighed myself was a medical inspection when i was 18 so 7 years ago . 
  i do n't think it 's that uncommon not to weigh yourself regularly . 
  it says `` created 8 hours ago \u00b7 150 images \u00b7 9,796 views \u00b7 stats '' right at the top even on a computer . 
  the ejection seat pushes him upwards negating ( or lessening ) the downwards momentum and the chute is designed to deploy instantly . 
  the word average has many meanings . 
  if you have a phone for 6 months and download 50 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 apps it would n't be wrong to say that on an average month you download 0 apps . 
  i have no clue but you can see in the video that this was far from free fall or `` terminal velocity '' . 
  the plane seemed to have traveled pretty horizontally right before the seconds leading to the crash . 
  yeah you do , i 'm not questioning that . 
  i 'm just saying you have uneducated shit taste never mind your ancestry . 
  how is that a redeeming quality ? 
  if you 're going to get something tattood on your body ** especially ** if it 's the first time i 'd definitely do my research . 
  i also would n't let a shitty tattoo artist work on me simply because he 's a relative . 
  no offense to her but i was pretty sure she was gon na have a dick when i scrolled down . 
  i do n't know .
