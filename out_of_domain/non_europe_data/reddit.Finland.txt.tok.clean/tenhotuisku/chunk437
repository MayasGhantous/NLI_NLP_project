  it 's how boring it 's to watch protoss dominate . 
   i really do not get it , if you do n't like guetta then do n't watch . 
  except asot is n't allowed to stream their own video because `` it would compete with the main stream '' and guetta 's mediocre set cut armin 's amazing set off so `` if you do n't like it do n't watch '' is n't in any way a valid comeback . 
  much better quality http://a.pomf.se/lepuut.webm, 
  also http://a.pomf.se/xgzrwy.webm, 
  i absolutely loved that song when it came out , regocnized it instantly . 
  still love it . 
  he lost his mic for like 30 seconds ... 
  that felt like a pretty anticlimactic end, 
  day 3 could n't really live up to day 2 in my opinion but i did n't expect it to . 
  skrillex set ( pre-guest stars ) was much better than i anticipated . 
  shame it did n't end with the same energy . 
  dj snake , robin schulz and kygo were great as was everything from the asot tent . 
  i really have to go back and listen to that entire asot show tomorrow . 
  the visuals this year were ** mind-blowing ** . 
  sounded like a high school girl trying to act, 
  have fun with your crappy 300p resolution and purposfully incorrectly or vaguely named clips so they would n't get taken down . 
  yeah and it 's also the most bizzarre thing because it 's not like it 's secret apple technology . 
  they buy it from foxconn or whoever supplies them and probably pay like 2cents a piece . 
  i simply can not understand how come a single pc manufacturer has n't picked up on this since like you said most people agree the trackpad is the single biggest advantage of a macbook . 
  i thought there was a live audio stream from the asot tent all day . 
  somebody must have recorded it ? 
  actually this same thing has happened to me too . 
  in like a spooning position . 
  i had had sex with the same girl many times , both vaginal and anal but that time i spent a few minutes trying to get it further in than an inch without her hurting and finally it started to work and she was enjoying it . 
  like a few minutes later i started questioning whether it was actually in her ass and tried to reach around with my arm to feel where i 'm going lol . 
  i wonder if she realized what i was doing . 
  i did eventually figure out i had switched to her vagina but it did fool me for like 2 minutes . 
  it happens http://metro.co.uk/2015/03/21/convict-killed-entire-family-when-they-visited-him-in-prison-5115091/, 
  vice city is best story/world wise but it shows its age a bit . 
  sa is probably best overall . 
  1 is the worst . 
  3 if you only include the 3d games . 
  because it was shit when it came out . 
  it slowly got better and now it 's already pretty decent . 
   yes . 
  i blast through t6 like it 's nothing . 
  agreed but i do n't think we need a t7 . 
  i think 6 levels is enough , it 's just that they 're way too close to each other . 
  i remember when i started playing again after the difficulty update with a brand new character i went from like t1 to t2 to t4 to t6 in a few days . 
  nobody really seems to spend a lot of time in any other level than t6 unless they 're doing it for some farming optimization reasons so i think they should buff all the difficulty levels , make them more sparse and have all be valid options . 
  you mean countries like sweden , finland , germany , czech republic , slovakia , austria , slovenia , switzerland , belarus , denmark , russia ... ? 
  his mouth does n't look like there 's a stop between every and thing . 
  you need to know the song to be able to dance to it ? 
  source ? 
  name ? 
  e. it 's donald sterling 's daughter, 
  why not 45 ? 
  i do n't think the highest difficulty should be something everyone achieves with no problem . 
  i play the game very casually and even i can solo clear 35 grifts in time . 
  i simply disagree . 
  t6 does n't bring anything new gameplaywise , it 's just the same thing with bigger multipliers . 
  why should everyone reach it ? 
  reaching t1 could be the `` end game '' treshold and t6 for dedicated players . 
  kinda how many japanese games have a ridiculous amount of difficulty levels yet casual players still enjoy the experience on normal . 
  it does n't hurt their experience knowing there 's hard , extreme , impossible , european mega hyper extreme etc. 
  i do n't know whether it 's true or not but there are dozens and dozens of google results saying it is . 
  it could be a joke gone viral and fooling the clickbait sites though , idk . 
  e. joanna was born joanna tiffany sterling in 1971, 
  damn she 's looking good in this one . 
  is there more ? 
  except those things had a nasty track record of corrupting saves . 
  it 's on both but they traditionally identify as an european nation . 
  well there is no official defination but if you look at these wikipedia articles for example, 
  russia is listed among european countries but not asian . 
  [ this population density map ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/russia/thematic-maps/population-density-map.html ) kinda explains it . 
  although russia has tons of land in asia most people and the culture has traditionally been focused near the european border . 
  i do n't agree with you but i recognize it 's impossible to compare 1 which was agruably a totally original idea to 2 which was a sequel . 
  im my mind it just was n't anything special . 
  and i did play it when it was new . 
  well it 's not like you do it because it 's fun . 
   i do n't think low population density is the key variable . 
  the key variable is lack of local team . 
  lack of local team due to low population density . 
  do you happen to be colorblind because that is not even close to the same shade as angels . 
  it 's clearly pirates . 
  because it 's a beast time in fifa . 
  at their star level it 's like cheating . 
  not taking a stance on the price thing because it varies from place to place but i can kinda sympathize with the dealer . 
  first of all when you 're doing these $ 20 deals they 're more of a social call . 
  you do n't make money doing $ 20 deals , you do it to keep up relations with friends . 
  then you 're busy trying to weigh it up and get it ready to go and some fucker you 're already not making much money out of ca n't decide over $ 5 . 
  i mean let 's be honest here if $ 5 is a big amount of money in your current situation then you probably should n't be spending any money on drugs . 
  yes, 
  going to the bathroom in the middle of movies #justamericathings, 
  yeah i found it kinda ironic that a video advertising the movie will ** not ** be censored and watered down to reach a wider audience censored the only curse word in it . 
  you totally misunderstood what he was saying . 
  the movies are n't cut for canada , canadians just have a more lenient rating system . 
  just like a lot of stuff rated r in the u.s gets rated 15 or 13 in europe . 
   jesus fucking christmas , it 's weighing a product and putting it in a bag . 
  yeah which she probably did do after `` thanks '' `` okay '' . 
  only to put away the weed and glance at her phone and notice that the guy switched the order for a measly $ 5 so now she has to go back and get the weed and weigh it again . 
   not making money on small deals ? 
  dealers always jack up the margin on smaller weight . 
  there is n't much to jack up unless you 're growing it yourself ( which most dealers are n't ) . 
  she 's probably making $ 3-5 a gram even if she 's charging as much as she thinks she can get away with . 
  on a $ 20 deal that 's nothing . 
  it 's not worth the time and effort simply from a business standpoint . 
  you do these miniature deals as favors so that the next time the guy 's looking to buy more he 's gon na come to you . 
   while this pos dealer just has to open a fucking bag and take out .2 g in like 2 minutes time .
