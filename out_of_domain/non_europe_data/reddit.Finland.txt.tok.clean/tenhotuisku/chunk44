  for an average man it 's easier to become a lumberjack or a docker simply because that 's how our genetics are , men have more muscle . 
  and in exchange for these low-education , relatively high paying jobs their overall health ( and therefore lifespan ) very often suffers . 
  but yeah , on paper they make more money than a waiter or something . 
  my granddad is jewish and he fought in ww2 against russia so technically with the nazis . 
  that 's pretty fucked up too . 
  this argument is really stupid since we both agree it 's a shop and we ca n't really take into account the direction of the light and other important things that 'd affect the lighting because of that . 
  i 'm suggesting we stop . 
  looks amazing . 
  what 's in it ? 
  well that pic on the right is clearly photoshopped wider , looks like the aspect ratio is fucked up, 
  i actually do n't know which one i 'd rather have . 
  a burger 's a burger but that pasta looks delicious too . 
  so ... do you actually use these shoes or are they framed over the fireplace or something ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've never used a smoking device where the bowl would n't be facing upwards . 
  towards morning cunnilingus or in general ? 
  well it 's not * that * nice when it 's fresh either, 
  wait . 
  since when have these been on r/trees as well ? 
  [ ] ( / whoa ), 
  that sounds unnecessarily difficult though . 
  are you able to . . scramble ( best would i could come up with ) the trees mid-bowl at all or would that hurt the delicate harmony ? 
  did you accidentally ? 
   many fewer women play chess competitively , so the talent pool is smaller . 
  well this would explain why there are * fewer * women on the highest level but not `` the fact that women are not competetive at the highest level '' . 
  i mean even with a smaller pool there should be one or two every now and then , like men from small countries . 
  actually men from small countries have it even worse , at least women can practice with all the local men and thus if they were possibly capable of the same level of required thinking , we should see some women in the competetive circles regularly . 
  but we do n't . 
  this is often the case in sports too . 
  women are allowed to participate in men 's sports ( well not in the olympics ) but not the other way around because it would be unfair . 
   it 's not a saying of superiority or inferiority either , but men and women are just different . 
  yeah it 's not but can you name a sport or a competetive game were women were dominant ? 
  i do . 
  if you do n't like it , you can geeeeeet out . 
  i usually like to mix it up after about 2/3 is gone . 
  you often get a lot more out of the bowl than just hitting it over and over with a lighter . 
  stuff comes off the walls and is n't as dense i guess . 
  i agree there is probably tons of domestic violence towards women that goes unreported . 
  but i also claim that there 's even more public violence towards men that is n't reported either . 
  i 've been in about 6-7 serious fights in my life ( none of which i started ) and all of them ended up with blood pouring out and even some broken bones etc yet i 've never dealt with the police about any of them . 
  dude !, 
  what the hell , man ? 
  that was the joke, 
  well once you 've confessed via twitter then it pretty much becomes `` prove your innocence '' . 
  living halfway across the world is a pretty good proof though . 
  because there is no way someone used a fake name on the internet, 
  download the webpage ( file , save as ), 
  save as many screenshots as necessary to capture every detail, 
  instead of this i suggest you download an add-on for firefox that saves the entire page ( not just what you see at once ) as an image file . 
  one should be easy to find from [ here ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/ ), 
  but it was n't an american cop though, 
  the thing is `` violence against women '' makes it to the front page few times a day . 
  there have been three submission that i 've seen today only . 
  and nothing even happened , some old pics were posted and skyrocketed to the top . 
  no one cares about violence against men because it 's not fashionable and sexy . 
  i think it 's great and she has lots of talent . 
  i also think it 's a dumb idea for a career . 
  420th upvote your welcome, 
  also yay !, 
  no actually i wish all of africa would just die and stop breeding like rabbits and polluting our air while doing nothing worthwhile so that comparison did n't really work out . 
  i have submitted news stories , but you see a non-informative `` here 's a picture of some dude who 's against violence '' does n't work if it is n't about women . 
  7 proxies, 
  i hate commenting and not adding anything new to the conversation but i also came here to tell that this is probably the best comic i 've seen on r/vertical, 
  ** [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vertical/comments/jf6kg/diesel_engine/ ) **, 
  why not ? 
  i think you just need to concentrate harder, 
  well wikipedia says she 's the undoubtetly the best female player ever and she 's ranked 41 . and the only female ever in the top 100 so that sounds more like a freak accident or a mutation than women sticking it to the men, 
  yeah because it 's not like the american people would have anything to do with selecting the politicans in charge, 
  same thing here except it 's not even that fun anymore . 
  i mean of course it would be but i ca n't even really get high which is the problem . 
  if i go crazy with the bong i may reach like [ 5-6 ] for 20 minutes , but i ca n't afford that . 
  so t-break it is , or another try at least . 
  i 'm guessing it 's [ this one ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267804/ ) you 're talking about ? 
  it 's funny how this is now the 3rd highest comment . . surrounded by `` herp derp the angles '' on both sides, 
  i wish i had the photo i took from the sears tower but my external hdd broke . 
  the picture is 98 % gray fog , with some extremely vague outlines in the bottom, 
  or just [ reddit faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#howisasubmissionsscoredetermined ), 
  how is a submission 's score determined ? 
  a submission 's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes . 
  if five users like the submission and three users do n't it will have a score of 2 . 
  please note that the vote numbers are not `` real '' numbers , they have been `` fuzzed '' to prevent spam bots etc. 
  so taking the above example , if five users upvoted the submission , and three users downvote it , the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes , or 12 upvotes , and 10 downvotes . 
  the points score is correct , but the vote totals are `` fuzzed '' . 
  actually submissions get a lot more if they get popular . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/c16omup ) for example . 
  it says ~ 7,5 k to 5k but in reality it was 2,5 k to 120, 
  sometimes when you say something really smart you might get up to around 30 | 0 in comments . 
  it does twitch around like 31 | 1 etc but if you keep hitting the f5 you 'll see the `` 0 downvotes '' score, 
  the only person who 's ever left me messages is my grandma . 
  i 've never left an answering message either after the introduction of cell phones . 
  when someone talks about `` leaving messages '' i think about the old casette machines and american movies . 
  you play call of duty to relax !? 
  holy shit you must have the nerves of steel, 
  i hate people who fear bees ( without a reason like allergy ) . 
  my room is next to some cherry trees and i keep a windows open 24/7 so in the spring one or two bees get in every now and then . 
  my reaction is to put them in a cup and release them outside . 
  my gf 's reaction is to start screaming and run away . 
  seriously annoys the shit out of me . 
  well you 're using sickbeard and newsgroups , that 's the problem . 
  it is complete bullshit .
