  yeah and old picture of someone being cool . 
  not random childhood photographs of celebrities . 
  so living a comfortable enjoyable life is n't an achievement in its own ? 
  haha enjoy the grind normie, 
  post pics, 
  again , they 're cheap and useful anywhere in the world . 
  why would they be so prevalent in russia compared to the rest of the world if there was n't a specific reason ? 
  like trying to counter insurance fraud for example . 
   battlefield is battlefield and cod is cod, 
  if you look at battlefield 2 and then at hardline , do you not see bf catering more and more to the cod audience ? 
  bf4 could 've been sold as a bf3 expansion . 
  and it probably would 've had it come a decade earlier ( just think about bf2 : special forces ) . 
  bfh was like a mod to bf4 , again could 've been sold as an expansion . 
  bf3 was the real successor to bf2 and bfbc did their own thing with more compact maps and focus on rush mode instead of vast open areas and conquest which has traditionally been the most popular mode in bf games other than bc . 
  except in nhl and nfl you 're lucky to find a few examples if you purposfully search for them online . 
  watch ** any ** football game that 's on tv and you 'll see at least a few dives in every single game . 
  it 's not a rare occurance that gets ridiculed by the fans and the community like in nfl/nhl . 
  it 's a fundamental part of the sport . 
   you can get a red card for diving, 
  if you 've ever watched football you know this is very much theoretical . 
  diving happens constantly in every game and almost always goes unpunished . 
  no , i 've watched football my entire life . 
  more than any other sport . 
  i see you like to fight strawmen . 
  well that 's just not true . 
  you 're right there are many more football games played than any other sport , but that does n't change the fact that if you watch any high level game ( each country 's # 1 league , champions league , wc/uefa ec ) you 're likely to see at least a couple of dives in every game . 
  the fact that there are much more games does n't have an effect on the frequency it happens ** per game ** . 
  yeah but the thing is i do n't have to go to youtube to see football dives . 
  i watch the sport on tv regularly and see them in every game i watch . 
  granted i have n't watched nearly as much nfl but i 've never seen a dive in an nfl game outside of gif 's on the internet . 
  you 're lying to yourself if you try to say that diving ( or at least embelishment ) is n't more prevalent in football than any other sport . 
  i also like that he 's encouraging the thought process of `` i died , therefore i must ping at least 10 times on my dead body '' . 
  ca n't really see that after the fact though . 
  deagle has been buffed ** a lot ** . 
  i do n't know when you tried csgo but it really should n't be buffed any more . 
  i do n't understand why people feel like deagle should be so much better than all the other pistols , it 's not in real life and it 's not good for game balance to only have one viable pistol . 
  are those sound lines from wc3 too ? 
  because i 'm getting so much nostalgia even though i never played original dota more than a few matches , but i did play a shit ton of wc3 vanilla . 
  looks more like the back of the neck/back to me . 
  i 've think seen enough liveleak videos to know what a direct hit to the head does , that seemed like a torso shot . 
   enoch graver , 21 , was shot to death and his 18-year-old brother david graver was shot in the abdomen . 
  i 'm guessing that was the 21 year old but did anyone spot when in the video the other guy got shot ? 
  i did n't see a second shot anywhere . 
  e. i see the shot that wounded the officer , was that the same bullet that hit someone in the stomach or was there another one ? 
  yeah what 's your point ? 
  us is the most backwards ass place in the world after middle east and africa ? 
  we already know that . 
  well it 's a good start . 
  with base turn rate of 0.7 it takes pudge 0.12 secs to turn 180 degrees . 
  that 's probably as quick as it takes you to move your eyes from the map to the middle of the screen . 
   i 'd have more problems figuring out if an approaching hero is friend or foe, 
  weird , i 've never had this happen . 
  i think the hero icons of friendly and foes are very easily distinguishable by their color . 
   using the icons takes much more mental processing : what hero it represents, 
  is n't this a two-step process with dots , thus more `` thought demanding '' ? 
   visually untangling overlapping icons, 
  do n't dots overlap as well ? 
  that probably has more to do with the console size setting than icons vs dots . 
   and remembering what team each hero is on . 
  i 've never had to memorize the teams when using icons as they are clearly coloured green if friendly and red if enemy which allows you to quickly check the numbers just like crosses against dots . 
  if anything i found the dots to require much more memorization when i tried them out as remembering what color was which hero was the only way to quickly determine who was where . 
  i get your arguements and the whole attention resource thing , i just do n't understand how they 're supposed to favor the dots/crosses . 
   if you do n't think it 's useful , then do n't use it . 
  well that 's why i made this thread , because i was wondering if i was missing something since all the differences i could think of could n't explain why the dots were so popular . 
  other than tradition of course . 
  so this keeps the dots at a minimum distance from each other ? 
  do you know if it also works with icons , i 'll have to try this out . 
  ok i googled and it apparently makes them smaller when close to each other . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  also :, 
  dota_minimap_hero_spread 1, 
  dota_minimap_hero_spread_distance 2, 
  yeah but i was n't talking about memorization . 
  at least on my settings ( no console tricks but some x 's in settings ) enemy/ally heroes are clearly colored so . 
  maybe something to do with mild color blindness ? 
  they are green and red after all . 
  do you know if these require restart because i 'm trying to play around with them in a bot game and see no change ? 
  i put spread on and the heroes still completely overlap and i ca n't see any size changes either . 
  e. apparently it did require the dots instead of hero icons :(, 
  well that 's the first proper reason to use dots yet so thanks for that . 
  haha you 're so delusional it 's funny . 
  people dive in every single game . 
  maybe you 're just so desensitized to it you do n't consider it a dive unless it 's extremely blatant ? 
  people flopping down from the tiniest of contact ( and i do n't mean contact to the feet ) is diving . 
  you see it everywhere if you 've ever seen a professional football match . 
  oh yeah she 's clearly the victim here . 
  because * emotional issues * . 
   you only see the few things they do bad because it 's better television . 
  or maybe because doing `` good things '' is what 's expected of them and their job ( ever heard of `` protect and serve '' ? ), 
  and doing bad things is n't ? 
  just maybe it has something to do with that minute detail , not simply which is better tv . 
  is n't that kind of the point of having a government ? 
  so that there 's a big enough entity governing things that a group of `` powerful '' individuals ca n't scare them off . 
  you 're right , not everything does . 
  this video however clearly did . 
  so how 's your quest to feel better than all the other commenters going ? 
   would n't have been a problem if they had a normal competent driver, 
  i 'm pretty sure even a competent driver could have issues driving with 13 fucking people on top of their van . 
  haha my city is already named `` tropico '' since i picked a map with sunny beaches . 
  this 'll go great with it,
