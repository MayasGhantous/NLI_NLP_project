  you do n't see male posters starting a message with `` so i 'm a man , and ... '' unless it 's absolutely crucial to the story . 
  also this age old wisdom from the front page of reddit [ 4 years ago ] ( http://i.imgur.com/plnpw.jpg ) . 
  not taking a stance on the whole rights thing but why are these police officers doing a traffic stop with a fucking apc ? 
  e. also `` i 'm a navy veteran by the way '' ... 
  i 'm pretty sure a veteran of any military branch could tell the difference between a tank and a personnel carrier . 
  i 'm not sure if this is some inter-branch circlejerk or if you really do n't know what those words mean . 
  the video is of course not a 100 % reliable source but it says they were in the apc because of a football match . 
  i fail to see why a football match requires full camo . 
  reddit autism surprises once again . 
  i guess it 's all the adderall you guys take but you people ca n't notice a joke even when it 's laid out right in front of you . 
  nobody sends a funny birthday card to an ex they actually despise , they clearly broke up in good terms and this card is saying happy birthday while also making fun of the crazy ex stereotype . 
  autists can take adderall just fine . 
  it 's not to treat autism but you do realize people can take more than one medication , right ? 
   adderall is used to treat adhd, 
  i know . 
  the average redditor is a ~ 20 year old white male from the u.s so likely overdiagnosed with every possible `` disorder '' and taking all the school performance increasing drugs like adderall . 
  it 's a word in my own language and online english dictionaries seem to define it too . 
  got the message across anyway so is n't that the point of words ? 
  ps3 was the easiest to `` hack '' . 
  all you needed was a different dns or something in the internet settings and you could access these 999999xp missions . 
  i did n't do it so i do n't know the specifics but it was really like a 60 second thing for the enduser . 
  yeah circles . 
  not rts style transparent version of the spell . 
  that 's not the dumb american stereotype . 
  that 's the overdiagnosed/overmedicated american stereotype . 
  two extremely different things . 
  people have been posting this shit on 4chan for over 10 years and i 'm sure on other sites before that . 
  i do n't know about baseball but for other sports i think it 's the time the ball is `` in play '' or `` alive '' . 
  but playing from an advantage is much more fun . 
  you get to do creative shit and have it work . 
  playing from behind ( because you do n't have a real build order ) is often just trying to survive , it 's not nearly as much fun . 
  learning a build order takes like 30-60 minutes and you only have to do it once . 
  yeah but we 're not talking about masters . 
  we 're talking about plat . 
  you should reach plat even with basic macro and a-move in under 1000 games . 
  i really do n't feel bad for him . 
  if you 're not plat after 30.000 games the problem is not in blizzard 's ranking system . 
  it has always worked perfectly for me on every browser and device . 
  also it allows sound in webms unlike gfycat . 
   not playing random, 
  why not both ? 
  sounds like this question gets asked a lot , huh . 
  maybe it should be in the faq then ? 
  permanently as opposed to the renting system mentioned on the faq so until i break it or it gets stolen . 
  i 'm not talking about the insurance . 
  well to be fair that 's a 2 point comment among 684 other comments so not exactly ** in ** the faq but thanks either way . 
  i wonder if there 's any `` official '' source for this claim as it is kind of a deal breaker . 
  if it was `` very known '' you 'd think it was easy to find . 
  i know i could n't find a reliable source on google , just some old forum posts with no sources and the like . 
  yeah i found a similiar text on the bottom of some `` new ships released '' page but that was only 3 ships and there was n't a similiar text on the bottom of the page listing all the ships which is why i was unsure . 
  also i did n't know if they 'd count the renting model as `` attainable in-game '' . 
  thanks . 
  while we 're on the subject of ship sales quick question ( so i wo n't have to make another thread ) . 
  what ships are actually in the game right now ? 
  all the ones with a price listed on the site or, 
   arena commander currently includes the rsi aurora , the origin 300i , the anvil f7c hornet , the origin jumpworks m50 interceptor , and the origin jumpworks 350r . 
  just these ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  one more quick question if you do n't mind . 
  if i buy the 315p and then the `` upgrade to 325a '' package , will i be able to `` downgrade '' the ship back to 315p ? 
  ( and for no charge ? ), 
  oh , that 's too bad . 
  i was thinking it 'd be like a loadout sort of thing . 
  makes the decision all the more difficult . 
  thanks for the help though, 
  yeah i think i 'll do that . 
  i 'm more interested in the 315 because exploration sounds more interesting than dogfighting ( in the final game ) but i do n't want to be a total punching bag if i get into a fight . 
  also i 'm not sure how much exploration there is to do just now so if i can only play a dogfighting minigame the 325 would make more sense . 
  yeah for like 4 years with everything that 's called `` milf porn '' nowadays . 
  people come and go , they do n't continually play the game from 2010 to today . 
  i know some do but the vast majority do n't and that 's why the people in the top 20 % change constantly too . 
  even though plat is top 20 % more than 20 % of people who 've played the game have been plat , a lot more . 
  it says right there on the message you replied to what it does . 
  it 's not cgi . 
  it 's fake as in planned and acted . 
  thanks !, 
  i think i 'll just go with es and try the other ships with rec before i make any decisions . 
  starting with the worst ship possible once the game launches does also sounds compelling . 
  i actually just bought the ln because i realize the ln + pass cost only 5 $ more than the mr + pass even though the mr to ln upgrade is 10 $ . 
  i figured those extra gun mounts were just too good to pass up on . 
  also i was afraid the es would just get abandoned once i buy any other ship but the ln could still have some use . 
  yeah i noticed . 
  but i 'm not really buying the game for `` right now '' any way so it 's no big deal . 
  kinda wish i had them for collecting rec though . 
  get the aurora es + pass ( cheapest option ) , try out the ships in ac and then upgrade your aurora to 325a/cutlass/whatever or return it for 100 % store credit and buy the one you like . 
  there is no `` it 's only mls '' with that spin as the ball control is very impressive but that defense did immidiately remind me that this is mls . 
  yeah nobody is saying it 's a big risk . 
  but it 's more than 0 %, 
  i ca n't understand why i get a ping of 140-150 every time i play . 
  i live in europe and always get 2ms ping from speedtest . 
  i should n't get over 100 to anywhere in europe . 
  it other games i 'm usually between 5 and 40 . 
  but [ this skin ] ( https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/add-ons/operation-pitchfork-skin ) for example does work at the moment ? 
  i feel like i need to buy a skin because the ln is so hideous haha . 
  she 's 42 years old in this pic btw, 
  they did http://www.reddit.com/r/tightdresses/comments/31h9mf/susanna_penttil%c3%a4/, 
  yeah but that 's why i compared it to other games . 
  csgo has servers in sweden/netherlands/germany / uk/france and i get between 10-50 always . 
  even if i play dota in us east servers i get a ping of ~ 150ish . 
  either sc has no servers in eu or their systems are really fucked up if other games can match the ping half around the world .
