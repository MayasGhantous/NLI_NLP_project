  nice assumptions you got there , especially seeing as i live in one of the most socialist countries on earth . 
   look after your kids until they are ready to go , regardless of age . 
  did you even read my post ? 
   none of them were `` kicked out '', 
  does this imply they were n't looked after until they were ready to go , or the exact opposite ? 
   no offence , mine was too, 
  oh i see you were just projecting . 
   will i really need to swap out for keys + mouse ? 
  i just ordered my first hotas and it has n't arrived yet but based on the dimensions it should be just fine like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xglw4g9.png ), 
  so that i wo n't have to move any of the gear when i change between the two . 
  i doubt you really go back and forth that often that the 1 second it takes you to move your hands really ever becomes an issue . 
   i 'm sorry , which post are you referring to, 
  the actual post, 
  that comment was a reply to a guy saying moving out as a young adult means your parents do n't `` give a fuck about their own children '' . 
  to be fair it does n't really cost them more ( maybe the price of a few extra snacks ) to place them in first class if those seats are empty . 
  seeing as how my method of flying is `` fall asleep after takeoff , wake up during landing '' i fail to see the appeal of an empty 737 . 
   you wo n't have to order anything from amazon anymore . 
  just go to the 3d store to pick it up . 
  worst sales pitch ever . 
  linux is actually huge . 
  not many people unfamiliar with the technology realize it but almost every website you visit runs on a server using linux . 
  just because it 's not hugely popular for home use does n't mean it is n't a `` big thing '' . 
  yeah i 'd also like to see some videos . 
  my gta5 is locked away in the attic with my xbox360 ( rip faithful friend ), 
  nice generalization you got there , too bad it 's also extremely wrong . 
  in fact most indie games i 've played have required much less effort to get into than the mainstream games i 've played . 
  dota 2 is the most played game on steam and after 500 hours i barely know the basics . 
  i could pick up hotline miami and in 2 minutes i 'd have a good handle on the mechanics . 
  well , it was n't . 
   an infinitely superior game yet has a fraction of the sales, 
  by fraction you mean over half of total simcity sales already ? 
  if you put that into scale with the game budget then skylines has been a much better investment for the publisher than simcity was despite skylines having zero marketing . 
  complaining about feature cuts and day 1 dlc is n't `` hating games '' . 
  criticizing publishers when they get greedy is a good thing . 
  people like you are the cancer of the industry . 
  i 'm just pointing out how his generalization of `` indie games are boring and require more dedication to get in to than big publisher games '' is n't the least bit accurate . 
  sure you could compare dwarf fortress and cod and it 'd be the opposite but my entire point was that complexity or approachability of the game is n't tied to the budget . 
  take a deep breath and just think about your comment . 
  gaming industry was alive just fine in the 90s when it was a fraction of its current size and developed the kind of games r/gaming loves to circlejerk over . 
  the way you 're saying it sounds like the industry is struggling and desperately needs more money thrown at it . 
  and i 'm saying a lot of people would rather have studios still publishing games like they did 10-20 years ago . 
  it 's not a coincidence all these retro kickstarters lately have been huge successes . 
  i understand the casual cod/gow/fifa crowd is a huge market audience which is the reason they 're targeted , but you seem to be hinting that if people did n't support this whole `` day 1 dlc/preorder bonus/yearly iteration/early access/separately bought chapter '' trend that 's been happening for the past 5 years then gaming would be `` dead '' . 
  it would n't . 
  who says desktop has to be gui ? 
  to be fair you could play ps2 level graphics on a psp the size of a graphic calculator 10 years ago . 
  the only reason is it took this long for actual calculators to do this is because they have no reason to up their hardware when the old ones still sell so well and perform the task they 're meant for . 
  the ti84 + is still like 150 $ and it has a 15 mhz cpu . 
  that cost is not based on the price of manufacturing it . 
  i think it 's to avoid calling women girls or girls women . 
  but i agree it sounds like a medical definition . 
  or like you 're speaking of a dog . 
  if gender is n't relevant to the topic it 's just easier to pick one pronoun than constantly repeat `` his/hers '' etc. 
  this never occured to you ? 
  are you new to the internet ? 
  how are your internal reproductive organs feeling today ma'am, 
  what if it 's a she doing the tagging ? 
  either you did n't watch cartoon network in the 90s or you did n't smoke weed in the 90s . 
  maybe spend some time in your day not being `` distracted '' and you grow used to it ? 
  i never get these posts , time alone in bed is the best time of the day . 
  except of course if you have an early morning and must fall asleep now but if you can just relax it 's very enjoyable . 
  you 're saying that like you expect me to know how to splice a wire . 
  i never read usernames on reddit because this site is too big to recognize anybody anyway and a lot of flairs do n't work on mobile/night mode . 
  do n't click yourself into such comment thread then ? 
  / r/starcraft has filters though, 
   i come to / r/games [ 5 ] for gaming news , major announcements , and the politics behind games . 
  this . 
  i do n't subscribe to this sub to talk about game mechanics . 
  this is my gaming news website , i do n't really go to ign or kotaku or whatever sites post gaming news these days , i use this sub . 
  if i want to have a game specific discussion i 'll go to that game 's own sub . 
  exactly . 
  i 'm the type of guy who can easily spend an hour in character creator but i absolutely hate excessive sliders . 
  if you want to include an `` advanced '' option for each setting then that 's fine but you should have a wide array of presets one can easily browse through and change the look instantly . 
  having to adjust 6 different sliders to see what the character would look like with a different type of nose is simply not fun and ironically this threoretical increase in detail often makes me not put as much effort into the character . 
  second thing is more basic but you should never reset the user 's choices without a clear warning that this will reset your character . 
  and always allow undoing/going back to previous phase . 
   i just started wasteland 2 and the character creation there was kind of lackluster, 
  whaaaaat ? 
  wl2 had great character creation . 
  on top of the 7 usual attributes you had like 20 different skills to choose from and only a few points so you really did have to choose . 
  you could create your own backstory from scratch and even import any photo you 'd like for the portrait which is the main way the characters are represented . 
  it was great fun recreating some known squads like the strike team from the shield or teenage mutant ninja turtles or whatever you 're into . 
  but that post does n't show that it 's `` definitely not a gender politics issue '' . 
  it explains why people do n't like the character , but blizz specifically talked about `` offending '' . 
  a reference to a character not liked by the community is not `` offending '' . 
  but the title does n't say sjw 's outraged at blizzard . 
  it says blizz to rename ship due to perceived offensiveness . 
  this tweet pretty much confirms the title word to word . 
  the most misleading part about this post is the `` misleading '' tag . 
   but it gives you no idea how useful these skills are beyond their names . 
  eh , to know how useful the skills are going to be beforehand would pretty much require them to give you a rundown of all the missions in the game . 
  there 's really no useless skills and what will be useful and what wo n't depends on your other squad members , the missions you choose , which of the multiple different ways to complete those missions you pick , your interactions with npc etc etc. 
  i think it would be pretty bad game design if some skills were intentionally better than others and the character creation screen would say like `` pick this , this is better than that other one '' . 
  also i disagree with the default portraits being terrible but if you find that to be an issue it 's really simple to [ get more in convenient packs ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/wasteland2/mods/searchresults/?src_order=3&amp;src_sort=0&amp;src_view=1&amp;src_tab=1&amp;src_language=0&amp;src_cat=4&amp;page=1&amp;pup=1 ) . 
   1 ) unzip the file . 
  2 ) place the images you want in \\ my documents \\ my games \\ wasteland2 \\ custom portraits, 
  \\  watching trailers, 
  op how do you feel like ground black pepper ? 
  i 've been adding some recently to my gruyere grilled cheese sandwhiches and i 'm really liking it . 
  is it heresy ?
