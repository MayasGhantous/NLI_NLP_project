  hey great post , only that you picked the wrong guy to respond to . 
  i was n't even taking a stand on whether or not the shooting was justifiable , i just thought it was funny that `` he tried to run '' was used as as a defence . 
  and no , yelling `` do n't move '' before does n't change it . 
  why is that an issue ? 
  are you trying to fit it into a tight space or something ? 
  yeah i know . 
  i 'm just curious if increasing the intake while not increasing the output would have much of an effect on the cooling . 
  ideally i 'd increase the output and increase the intake even more . 
  i 've eaten mcdonalds all my life ( like probably a thousand orders ) and i 've maybe gotten the wrong thing three times total at most . 
  is it because i rarely use the drive thru ? 
  have you looked for them or do you just keep the inventory of your local walmart memorized ? 
  yeah because only default keybinds use number keys , right ? 
  honestly i do n't understand why anyone would use a keyboard like this . 
  i like to customize my keybinds in any game that i play and in many games i 've noticed i 'm struggling to find keys for everything even with number keys and f-keys . 
  every button left of h is usually filled with important buttons and right of that the less important ones and i still struggle to find keys for everything now that i do n't have a numpad . 
  i 'd rather have anything than led . 
  if i had led i 'd turn them off . 
  i just do n't get the appeal . 
  my old laptop had a backlit keyboard and after the first 2 days of `` wow amazing '' i never turned it on because it was just annoying . 
  not that i care if someone else has them or likes them . 
  oh my god those f-keys . 
  why are they so far away ? 
  nah i live in the city and i do n't have one mcdonalds i go to nor do i have a regular order, 
  there is a big difference between breaking `` game laws '' and `` game rules '' . 
  piracy is n't griefing . 
  yeah but i also think that especially in the beginning of pu a lot of pirates will want to try and take down a hull e even it it is n't a profitable idea when thoroughly analyzed on paper . 
  it still looks like a nice target and i 'm sure a lot of pirates will want to attack it just to try it or to say they have done it . 
  what about blowing your own ship as soon as you see pirates approaching because you have lifetime insurance ? 
  a lot of people would consider that abusing the game mechanics and simply not fun for gameplay . 
  i know but i do n't want that . 
  i 'd hate having to turn it up every time i start a game and then back down when i stop etc. 
  i just want them to be automatically controlled . 
  yeah i have a 970 and a i7-4790k with a custom cooler . 
  i have n't really played around with the fan settings but i 've noticed that even now they do sometimes run pretty quick and loud and the components do reach over 70c if playing a really demanding game . 
  i do n't think it 's very edgy to admit that you do n't really care about the death of someone you 've never met , never heard about and do n't even know any of their relatives . 
  people who claim the opposite just lie because it 's polite . 
  the worst thing is when somebody clearly hits their head and people feel the need to drag them to a sitting position and try to hold their head up ( and of course just end up shaking it around ), 
  it 's from an episode of quantum leap . 
  nobody is saying `` the one-way mirror is okay because this woman 's obsession to point out her profession is annoying '' . 
  they 're two separate things . 
  having a mirror like that in any bathroom is unnacceptable , and that woman is kinda annoying . 
  they do n't cancel each other out . 
  they 're always called `` one-way mirrors '' in cop shows and movies etc. 
  mirror on one side , window on the other . 
  one-way mirror . 
   you 're making it about her with your comment . 
  no , she made it about her with her comment . 
  how is being a female comedian in any way related to the creepy mirror , unless that 's a `` female comedians only '' toilet , which i highly doubt . 
  primarily because in this thread it was mentioned that it 's a known thing in the women 's bathroom and an `` attraction '' . 
  you would n't put an `` attraction '' to where only professionals working can reach . 
  what does it tell about you that you were still preparing to get offended about her looks even when nobody actually commented on them . 
  i think that makes you the one who put more emphasis on them than the `` hivemind of reddit '' that you love to hate did . 
  but ... ability of cooldown , must use . 
  i do n't think that word means what you think it means, 
   looks mentioned and upvoted, 
  ok let 's click on a link, 
   why is she acting like that , thats annoying . 
   the very mention, 
  nobody 's bitching about the `` i 'm a comedian '' in the intro . 
  it 's the second and third time she mentioned it and comments like `` oh here 's to being a lady in comedy '' which make no sense and try to make this all about her and her profession . 
  the mirror is creepy because it 's looking straight at a toilet . 
  not because it 's looking straight at a toilet where a woman in comedy happens to be sitting . 
  it 's completely irrelevant and she keeps trying to force it . 
  i do n't know . 
  to be honest all these streakers usually want is attention . 
  getting tackled by a professional player you were ready to pay to just watch might be a win in his book . 
  hell even i think it 'd be pretty cool if you could say `` remember the time [ local superstar ] tackled the shit out of me ? '', 
  who ignored the main point ? 
  nobody here is saying the mirror is acceptable because the way she keeps bringing up her profession is annoying . 
  you 're the one trying to force a connection between these two unrelated observations . 
   it 's her video, 
  every video on youtube is `` their video '' . 
  does this mean no video can be criticized in any way because it 's `` theirs '' ? 
  so only topics you approve of are acceptable subjects of conversation ? 
  did they laugh at this ? 
  because i 'd laugh at this , but if i was a famous politician i do n't know if i 'd laugh at a joke like this . 
  then again peer pressure . 
  i 'm not trying to downplay how bad this was for collins but his family sounds like a bunch of money-grubbing vultures . 
  this happened in 1983 and in 1986 resto and his trainer were put on trial and sentenced to jail . 
  ** in 2007 ** they tried to sue ** the state of new york ** for `` not protecting collins '' . 
  like wtf , three decades later and still trying to milk the death of their son/husband and from a completely unrelated third party . 
  it took her 34 years to get her toughts together after the incident and file a lawsuit ? 
  it was advertised incorrectly . 
  the card itself is great value and the `` revelation '' does n't change it 's performance in benchmarks and actual use . 
  yes i own one, 
  yea i did n't buy mine because it was 4gb . 
  i bought mine because it got great results from benchmarks and only cost 300 . 
  at the time of purchase it was ranked # 3 at http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html and the other cards in top 5 were 600-1200 $, 
  looks like a totally average dude dressed in a normal manner, 
  if you think she seems `` very intelligent '' you have n't seen much of her stuff . 
  she is a moron . 
  i mostly watched her when she was trying to become a `` figure '' in the sc2 scene so those were live streams and not videos but here is one example of her reporting that i remember https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbkniucfjtq, 
   moreover , while every person/body is different , usually small boobs have small nipples , big boobs have bigger ones . 
  having boobs that big with those teeny tiny nips is a pretty good give away . 
  eh , i do n't think anyone is claiming her boobs are `` regular '' . 
  the entire point is they 're very `` unusual '' . 
  she 's not a moron because she has blonde hair and fake tits . 
  she 's a moron because she constantly says stupid shit and when teamed up with others she can hardly follow any conversation or contribute anything that is n't `` hey look at me i 'm a stupid blonde hahaha is n't that cute '' . 
  i get that it 's partly an act , but acting dumb does n't make you smart . 
  neither does acknowledging that people only watch your stuff because of your boobs .
