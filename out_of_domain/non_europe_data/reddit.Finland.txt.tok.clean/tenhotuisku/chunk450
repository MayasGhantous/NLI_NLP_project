  if realizing that you can profit off your sexy looks made someone smart every stripper , model and prostitute in the world would be `` very intelligent '' for doing what they do . 
  me neither , but that does n't make me very intelligent . 
  because of people like me who do n't look at the subreddit when upvoting things . 
  it was the cool thing to do already in 2007-2008 when i was an exchange student in mi . 
  not only did the kids make a bonfire every weekend adults had also caught up on it and activities like our football team etc. 
  had `` organized bonfires '' . 
  those ones included no alcohol though . 
  i 'm not complaining because bonfires were awesome . 
  secretly drinking whisky stolen from parents and snuggling girls under a blanket . 
  10/10 would bonfire again . 
  it was a beach town and a lot of the bonfires were on beaches so i do n't know if that makes a difference in their popularity . 
  zero k = `` o k '' = `` okay '', 
  / r/nhl is for circlejerk and memes that are n't allowed on / r/hockey, 
  no she is n't, 
  wait this is the bible told with minecraft `` characters '' ? 
  i thought it was like `` the bible of minecraft '' teaching you everything you need to know about minecraft . 
  she recently got her lips done , they do n't look nice anymore :(, 
   my mom actually bought this for my little cousin who is really into minecraft , i do n't see how it 's blasphemous at all . 
  does n't anyone else think it 's kinda weird to give someone religious gifts ? 
  religion is fine and all but gifting a religious book to a young person just sounds wrong . 
  i 'm sure if someone gave a kid a `` 10 reasons god does n't exist '' book it would get the `` oh my good fucking euphoric atheist always forcing their shit on others omg cringe cringe '' reaction . 
  i have n't seen him since dac . 
  he does have a day job unrelated to dota though , does n't he ? 
  that 's exactly what he was saying . 
   having to create 3d models for every single item . 
  it 's not like that 's a huge amount of work . 
  valve is not a one man indie studio . 
  you 're saying that like it would take the whole dev team to create some simple 3d models for the items . 
  valve could just have one additional guy create them in a week or two and the rest of the development would be unaffected . 
  itt people seriously overestimating the time it takes to make a simple 3d model that 's viewed from a far distance . 
  itt people seriously overestimating the time it takes to make a simple 3d model that 's viewed from a far distance . 
  probably anything that is n't \u00e4\u00e4nekoski or tervakoski is a step up . 
  because people have higher expectations for a teacher who 's supposed to be a professional at dealing with children than they do for a 15 year old ? 
  the game has sound ques though . 
  i could never play muted . 
  he was n't saying it as justification but explanation . 
  two different things . 
  we know pinging does n't help anything but if you 're constantly `` getting pinged '' by teammates there might be something you 're doing that 's provoking this behaviour . 
  while i do n't ping spam there are legit uses for more than 1 ping . 
  if an enemy is visible on the minimap just for half a second in our jungle or something then 1 ping is usually enough . 
  but if you notice a pudge hiding in trees or a space cow charging and your teammate does n't then 2 or 3 quick pings usually better convey the immidiate threat than 1 ping would 've . 
  1 ping = pay attention here, 
  3 pings = holy crap look out, 
  if you do n't think rubick gets picked a lot then you definitely do n't watch pro dota . 
  since when does every hero need to be played as a core ? 
  `` touch screen suck for gaming '' is enough . 
  yeah i know there are a few casual games like fruit ninja where they work but anything you 're supposed to play for more than 10 minutes fucking sucks on a touch screen , even if it was designed that way . 
   the woman 's name was christine miller , and she was a strong willed woman, 
  i think calling anyone who 's a part of a cult and especially this cult a `` strong willed individual '' is a bit of a stretch . 
   these people did n't perceive themselves as a cult . 
  a lot of cults if not most do n't consider themselves a cult . 
  wait why does korean dota have korean names ? 
  russian dota has english names even though russian uses different letters as well . 
  i personally like welcome jouster or that shaman, 
  true , but even without ags he 's a very popular pick already . 
  they do n't even get karma for self posts . 
  i think it 's more the same phenomenon as people commenting `` first '' on articles or videos etc. 
  i get that a lot of people use reddit on their phone but do you ** always ** browse on mobile ? 
  that would really suck to be honest . 
  whenever i 'm away from home and browsing reddit it 's better than nothing to do but if i have to do anything more complex than flicking pictures to the left i get annoyed and wish i was on a computer . 
  i 'm pretty sure back when slavery was legal a lot of people would take pride in being a slave owner . 
  i thought this sub was for photoshopped pictures of church billboards . 
  to be fair i 'm pretty sure you 're not the only one who 's come up with that idea . 
  probably because your artstyle looks like a 14 year old weeaboo doodling in her notebook and the jokes are n't funny . 
  also have you seen [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t4xs2pqffa ) ? 
  granted your comic was n't really related to gaming but the main message of the video applies to any webcomic . 
  to be fair i did only read 5 comics but that 's four and a half more than i would 've if i randomly came across your site . 
  like trying to search anything or post a comment or do anything else except looking at the front page . 
  yeah but they could 've been on the brink of divorce for a long time already and the $ 650k was a big enough motivator to finally file those papers she 'd been thinking about for years . 
  i 'm not assuming they were forced to be there . 
  if anything the opposite . 
  i believe they were easily fooled into thinking they actually wanted to be there . 
  for example from what i 've read vast majority of the cult members were n't suicidal , they were peer pressured into it . 
  the opposite of strong willed . 
  damn nice move, 
  good for you, 
  hey we found the guy who actually watches tv from tv, 
  dogs do this a lot too . 
  i think all pack animals do . 
  22 years, 
  fake as fuck, 
  nobody was saying a woman ca n't be a firefighter, 
  940 master race, 
  what if she lost her phone and deleted it from a computer or something and soon as she noticed/was told ? 
  something like that could happen . 
  yeah is n't she the one in that pic stuffed between boulders or something like that, 
  e. https://nationellyttrandefrihet.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/elin-krantz-iiii.jpg, 
  yeah this is the biggest reason . 
  it 's incredibly hard to fail at placing a quest marker and takes like 15 seconds for the devs to do . 
  designing an interesting quest where the player does not feel completely lost but still gets the satisfaction of `` figuring it out on his own '' takes tons of resources and can easily result in failure . 
  what i personally hate is n't the abundance of quest markers in modern games , it 's the fact that in a lot of games the quests are unsolvable if you do n't stare at the marker . 
  they do n't go through the effort of designing good quests since most people just want to follow a marker anyway . 
  yeah the thing was a broken mess 2 years ago . 
  people laughed at last gen console players for `` beta testing the game '' but if that version was beta this thing is hardly more than beta rc2 . 
  in two years with two re-relases they added extremely minor changes ** most of which during the first two months of last-gen gtao ** . 
  i did n't buy it for pc because i doubted i 'd be interested in playing it again but i 've watched some streams and the online interface is identical to how it was in the end of 2013 . 
  it needed a complete overhaul , not a few extra options to the lobby menus . 
  you do n't get banned for single player mods if you do n't go online . 
  you get banned for having single player only mods installed when you go online . 
  people are n't complaining there is no workaround , of course you can disconnect your entire computer from the internet for example .
