  ** or ** or or life is just bland and like shit, 
   just know that you are n't getting better, 
  true , but then again weed is pretty fucking great when you 're depressed, 
  life is n't always about `` getting better '' . 
  sometimes you just have to enjoy or you 'll go crazy . 
   secondly , a goalie scoring is rarer than a hat trick in hockey . 
  if you have a hat trick on the line , you do n't not shoot . 
  i do n't think you watch much hockey if you think this is true . 
  but, 
   six goal game and how this is a jerk move . 
  it 's not . 
  six goals at the start of the fourth quarter is not a game in hand, 
  even if it was a 20 goal game i do n't think it 'd be a `` jerk move '' . 
  the teams were pitted against each other so clearly it 's a fair enough contest . 
  whatever you do in the game , even if it 's `` showing off '' is n't a jerk move . 
  you earned that showing off if you 're leading by so much you can take risks . 
  coming from a video game background and not card collecting background i find it disgusting that the consensus in this thread is `` not optimal way to aqcuire cards = not worth playing '' . 
  am i the only one who thinks `` not fun = not worth playing , fun = worth playing '' ? 
  cards will come eventually . 
  you clearly have n't been on reddit for too long because this gif ( the original ) made the front page with a different title like every single day for weeks when it first hit reddit . 
  it does n't have to be purposfully edited . 
  a lot of sites ( facebook , twitter , instagram , imgur ) compress jpeg files when you upload them . 
  some more than others but when a picture has been posted and reposted and reposted over and over again it loses quality each time and becomes an ugly mess . 
  eh ... that 's not what you were saying . 
  in fact you 're advocating the opposite . 
  you said a hockey player with 2 goals will do anything to try to score a hat trick which is far from the truth . 
  it 's much more common to see 2 goals and x assists than a hat trick . 
  yes . 
  in fact i bought 24, 
   you ca n't use mental/other issues to excuse shit like this , though . 
  the dude is 24 - he should know cheating is wrong . 
  you 're using the mental progression of a healthy individual as a reasoning why a disturbed individual should act a certain way . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  or just buy better quality sausages ? 
   but if they have an open shot they 're obviously going to take it , no matter the score, 
  exactly . 
  the goal amount little to no difference . 
  which is the opposite of what you were insinuating . 
  op seems like a bit of a douche, 
  different girl and different scene but the position reminded me of this http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1529465353, 
  or you could just pay a few extra bucks and not worry about it + have someone else to blame in case it fucks up, 
   24/7 rush on metro, 
  literally disgusting, 
  i could pay you to do it, 
  at least in my country the police 's stand on breathalyzers is `` if you have to use one to check whether you 're able to drive you should n't be driving '' . 
  also the company does n't want responsibility if you use one and it says you 're just under the limit but you get pulled over and blow above the limit . 
  i 've mostly seen breathalyzers used the morning after when it 's much more difficult to judge your blood alcohol level and you 're not as prone to stupid stunts either . 
  bruno is the don cherry of esports, 
   sir, 
  6.84 is amazing tho, 
  i was so used to csgo i had forgotten patches can actually make the game better, 
  undying already got nerfed in 6.84 b, 
  seeing as how she 's done 1 anal scene in her career i 'm pretty sure `` madison ivy anal '' would be a decent search term to start with, 
  first time means first scene . 
  it was actually in her exclusive contract with brazzers that she had to do an anal scene within 3 years or something and the contract was expiring . 
  that guy with dreadlocks is in all these videos and looks so fucking punchable . 
  posting 10 year old pasta is the definition of edgy, 
  if you get your feelings hurt by mean comments online then maybe you should stay off the internet, 
  you seem angry, 
  sounds to me like they want to play with lower level teams and then quit the lobby when it becomes clear you wo n't pick an equally bad team, 
  see , nothing !, 
  lol turn rates and cast points = input latency, 
  go play league if you want to spam abilities with no regards to strategy, 
  oh my god the comment section, 
  except 6.84 just made farm 10 % less benefitial and kills 20 % more benefitial resulting in passive farming being effectively punished, 
  you clearly know nothing about dota if you think this is n't true in dota2, 
   its more fun when you require team-synergy , skills that make sense together , and teamfights that reward skill , not farm . 
  also the game is full of skillshots so i have no clue where you got that from, 
  it 's really strange that my experience in real life is 100 %, 
  `` oh for fuck 's sake we 're too early they 're only serving breakfast menu '', 
  where as on the internet it 's, 
  `` oh shit we 're too late we ca n't get breakfast '', 
  it does but the breakfast menu sucks even more imo . 
  a mcdouble might be simple and overly processed but it 's still an ok burger in a hurry . 
  the muffins or whatever they 're called are just disgusting . 
  you must 've been reading some dank fanboy propaganda to ever think otherwise, 
  it 's just people who are new to the game not understanding the mechanics . 
  especially those who come from lol typically ca n't understand ( or just have n't been told ) that in dota2 you have to face the direction of the spell or item you 're casting . 
  the acceptable radius is about 30 degrees depending on the item or spell . 
  so , you face 90 degrees off your target and click on it . 
  with the average turn rate of 0.5 it takes about 0.1 seconds to turn before you 're able to cast and on top of that you add the cast point which means it can take anywhere between 0 to 0.5 seconds of animation before the spell takes effect, 
  it 's easy to understand why a newer player would think this is `` input delay '' if they 're used to games with no turn rate and instacast abilities . 
  it 's not a definite source but wiki says sets have a chance of arcana , items do n't . 
  no fucking way, 
  in every example i 've seen before software versioning ** does ** work the same way as decimal fractions . 
  after 1.9 comes 1.91 or 1.9.1 or 1.9 a but not 1.10, 
  they do n't have a chance in an all out war . 
  they 'd just go out with a bang . 
  and north korea acknowledging it in their state media would n't make it any more likely to be true . 
  you ca n't expect certainty when it comes to news from nk . 
  to be fair this is exactly the kind of post that belongs on / r/shittyreactiongifs, 
  it 's not an insult, 
  you can set it in console, 
  i like the homestorycup kind of feel, 
  well congratulations that 's the worst title i 've ever seen on reddit, 
  redditor for 1 month, 
  yeah i agree with this guy . 
  the way / u/dota2portaltv is trying to force ags into being `` situational '' is just describing a situation where lc is n't played to her full potential but in a crappy way in which even the ags makes her less useless . 
  you 're better off just not doing that build in the first place . 
  find a better job,
