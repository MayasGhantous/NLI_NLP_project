  even if you have safesearch off ( they changed this in like 2013 iirc . ), 
  '' [ nude ] ( http://i.imgur.com/joehvhf.jpg ) '' works , as does naked or boobs etc. 
  it overrides the safesearch, 
  is it dota2 ? 
  congratulations you found the one other good f2p game i was referencing, 
  i think her fake boobs are reasonably sized . 
  they 're not round balloons or anything . 
  so it 's supposed to just pop up ? 
  i 'm not missing anything ? 
  i feel like that 's the most boring possible title you could come up with for a picture like this . 
  i paid full money for tf2 when it was released so i refuse to acknowledge it as f2p :\\ ^ ), 
  ok 3 then, 
  yeah but you ca n't reverse a `` dead puck '' call on replay so it does n't matter if it was too early . 
  professional 4channer, 
  glad to see i 'm not the only one, 
  russian old money is n't that nice either, 
  while ai might be the hardest thing to program it is not one of the things that takes a lot of resources . 
  mundane things like reflections , lighting and particle effects do . 
  yeah arma is all about that cpu and op 's computer 's cpu looks like the weak link to me, 
  i see you 've played tropico, 
  too grindy and repetetive imo though the armor system is cool, 
  it 's up to the ref and the call is reviewable so if it shows intent to play the puck into the net it 's no goal . 
  often just `` forward '' is seen as intent enough but like i said it 's up to the ref . 
  i do n't think the glass automatically clears you of `` responsibility '' the same way as a bounce off another player does . 
  there is no `` unintentional '' high sticking . 
  a player is responsible for his stick at all times . 
  intent to injury can up the penalty if it hits someone in the face but when reviewing a goal only thing that matters is the height, 
  yea i thought it was really cool 10 hours in too, 
  bored after less than 50, 
  hot tub time machine 2, 
  lol you do realize that russia or whatever that piece of land has called itself over the last few millenia is an old superpower with great families over centuries old ? 
  a little over 50 years of communism did n't empty the pockets of the real old money . 
   it gets frustrating when you have multiple friends who get bored with their seasonal characters and just outright quit playing the season . 
  this leaves you with a seasonal character that you 've invested your limited time in while your friends go back to their ns characters . 
  what do you do ? 
  leave too ? 
  i 'm not doubting this has happened to you but i have about 20 friends on my diablo list who 've played since the seasons were introduced and none of them have switched back to non-seasonal characters . 
  in fact i 've only seen 1 or 2 ever play on their non-seasonals mostly i think because like you said it 's soon the same thing anyway . 
  yeah i just upvote funny shit on my front page . 
  i rarely look at the sub . 
  close enough, 
  yeah and the other way around if dropped items were tradeable the drop rates would be so low op would 've just never got the skin in the first place . 
  when i was a kid with ps1 i played ** a lot ** of demos . 
  i was n't even poor , but all the magazines came with a demo disc and when you 're 10ish beating the first level is often time consuming enough . 
  there are plenty of demos i remember fondly just like i played the whole game . 
  thps1 for example had a 2 minute demo of the most iconic map in the game you could reset infinite times . 
  i played that for years . 
  more than a lot of the games i got my parents to buy for christmas etc. 
  your courier has 2 thousand kills ? 
  i like him as a caster but he does have a porn star name . 
  this was the first time i heard an actual icp song, 
  wait this video was n't a single segment run ? 
  that 's the one, 
   i remember that , i was more horny for her than for the 2 girls . 
  not because they were not pretty just because i knew that i would fuck them anyway.in a set , you 're not suppose to fuck the make up artist , if she 's pretty that make you want a fuck her even more . 
  like you guys you see a lot of other pretty girls getting fuck in the movie but the only one you really want to see is the one you 're not suppose to . 
  gold, 
  but cm is a gurll, 
  i have more items for cm , lc , lina , luna and wr than the rest of the heroes together, 
  or `` teamspeak '', 
  nobody wants to know details of your ts problem, 
  but viewers love it . 
  stuck up admins do n't for some strange reason . 
  i know kespa had it 's ridiculously strict typing rules in brood war but this is not starcraft and not korea . 
  no he is n't . 
  read it again . 
  if you 're using it unoficially could n't you just start calling yourself a knight without asking anyone 's permission ? 
  really ? 
  yeah micing hockey players is pretty common but it 's mostly shown on canadian/european tv stations where athletes swearing is n't an issue . 
  the punchline of the guy grabbing shit from a plate was funny to me, 
  the `` why the hell am i still subscribed to / r/funny ? '', 
  post, 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma /, 
  more like [ 6 ] [ 6 ] [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 9 ], 
  it 's a round cup with a `` spike '' in the middle, 
  haha i was n't reading carefully, 
  gambling is only really seen as the big devil in the united states and a few other countries . 
  where i live every kiosk has slot machines and a table to fill in sports bets/lottery/whatever . 
  it 's a very recent change that some of those are even 18 + . 
  i 'm a 90s kid and used to spend my childhood filling out football bets for the equivalent of 0.50-1 $ a piece and it was normal behaviour for children . 
  the governments own betting agency has it 's site open 24h and is trying to keep up with the times with features such as live betting on matches that are underway ( on the internet or phone ) and introducing esports bets . 
  betting is just another way of entertainment . 
  violence is definitely seen as a worse thing than sports betting in most european countries . 
  yeah but it fucking sucks you ca n't broadcast a game bought in europe to a european viewerbase from your european home to a european twitch server if the game is rated something else somewhere else . 
  first off iw made it very clear you do n't have to shoot a single civilian to complete the mission . 
  also the game asks you if you want to complete that mission and that completing the campaign is totally independent from it and that the mission offers no achievements . 
  secondly it 's a double agent . 
  secret agents and operationally are traditionally deemed okay content for movies/games even if they kill civilians . 
  it 's different from a civilian killing civilians because he 's cranky . 
  i 'm not defending one or attacking the other , i 'm explaining how one company treaded the fine line of pr and came out ahead with tons of publicity while the other is just a `` shocker '' that 'll be forgotten in two weeks . 
  and they got rid of it because it was tacky and frankly not fun gameplay . 
  times change . 
  because those are sponsors of the streamers and not the site and are n't handled by the site itself . 
  they could of course start contacting the streamers on their sponsor choices but people like kaceytron bring them big money and companies do n't usually like messing with sponsors/investors . 
  deciding you want nothing to do with one game is a much smaller decision to make and no ( big ) streamer is going to protest it . 
  maybe for twitch , but subs and donations are a much larger source of income for the streamers and keeping the steamers happy and active is what gets twitch viewers for their ads . 
  not to mention almost ** none ** ( i can think of 2 exceptions and have been watching twitch religiously for years ) of the bigger streamers who have `` unlocked '' the sub button play ads . 
  ever . 
  events have ads but they play them as simply a video feed and sell the slots to advertisers directly , they do n't use the twitch ad function . 
  all the smaller/medium sized streams combined spamming ads certainly makes money for twitch but without a source for numbers i would n't say subs are `` marginal '' .
