  in the unranked ap people wait until 0:00 and suddenly everyone picks what they want . 
  it 's almost like all-random in that teams rarely counter each other or pick reasonable lineups . 
  in ranked ap you pick one at a time which forces you to react to your enemies team and form synergies that actually make some sense . 
  i mainly play cm because i enjoy the picking phase but if i were to play ap i 'd never play the unranked version because it 's just a mess . 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  if that 's an off ramp and the kids are going down in the wrong direction then sure but if that 's actually a two-way road and the truck is overtaking the other truck on the opposing lane in such a place with an on ramp then that 's an incredibly risky and stupid move regardless if there 's kids on a bike or not . 
  this is not the first time it 's happened . 
  usually waiting a day or two and reinstalling res fixes it . 
   with that being said , i 'm almost certain that this road was probably for `` motor vehicles only '' . 
  that 's why i said regardless of kids on a bike . 
  if that 's a two way road with a ramp like that even a person driving a car could face difficulty if a truck passes like that with such short 3rd lane . 
  which is why i started my original comment with, 
   if that 's an off ramp and the kids are going down in the wrong direction then sure ** but **, 
  not mutually exclusive are they ? 
  but the business model actually affects the gameplay . 
  that 's the problem . 
  the business model is a lot more than the price you end up paying . 
  two players who have equal amount of hours in the game but one has paid real life money has an advantage, 
  yeah game workshop backed out with their license at the last moment so blizzard just kinda renamed the characters and went with it . 
  that was wc1 though , wc2 had it 's own story and lore only somewhat tied to the original ( warhammer ) universe . 
  yeah but one good quality basic skin takes less space than 40 custom skins per hero . 
  and besides the max poly count for custom skins is way higher than what the defaut skins have . 
  but the game already runs on toasters . 
  i used to play dota on my 5 year old mac that definitely was n't designed for gaming . 
  he said the main menu feels like from a game that is in beta , not that it feels like the way it was in dota 2 beta . 
  and i agree , it lacks polish . 
  to be honest i do n't think we need to sacrifice everyone 's enjoyment for those on a 7 year old laptop . 
  i 'm all for keeping the minimal settings available but having hi-res textures ** available ** for those on a less than 7 year old pc would be nice . 
  yes they do . 
  picking is half the game in mobas . 
  one has access to every character and can pick the perfect counter to the situation while one has to make compromises with what free characters he happens to have available . 
  if you watch the scene of the gif in the video the whole music and atmosphere etc. 
  is really surreal . 
  that 's how it 's always been for me . 
  and it 's just irc so there 's no reason it would n't be like that . 
  have you recently upgraded your pc or reinstalled browser or something ? 
  it 's almost like there are people who do n't watch tv or listen to top 40 pop hits daily on radio . 
   you 'll have enough gold ( in-game currency ) to get who you want, 
  you do n't `` buy '' heroes while in the lobby though , do you ? 
  so you can buy a hero `` you want '' as an all around nice hero to have , but you wo n't have every single hero available all the time like someone who 's bought them all with real money would . 
  unless you 've played for a lot longer than lvl 30 . 
   continue to pirate software that could have viruses or malware, 
  lol, 
  you do realize this is as close to the truth as high school drug education ? 
  in fact i 'd wager a person with a pirated windows is less likely to get viruses than someone with a legit windows because having a pirated windows implies at least some level of tech savviness . 
  yeah but downloading a scene release of windows is a thousand times safer than installing random legal software on your official windows . 
  you do realize that youtube video is not the original one either ? 
  it 's an old twilight zone episode based on a book . 
  yeah there 's a devon anal pack on empornium , i recommend downloading it . 
   unless you 're literally a moba god that knows all perfect counter picks, 
  eh ... you mean a person who knows the basics of a video game he 's playing ? 
  did you not go to driving school before getting a license ? 
  if you 're driving close enough to the person in front of you that you would n't have time to come to a complete stop then it 's completely your own fault . 
  well it 's not really a rumor since the co-founder of blizzard is the man behind the `` rumors '' but yeah , one of the main reasons the deal fell through is that blizzard wanted full control of the universe and games workshop wanted to have a `` veto '' on anything blizzard wanted to introduce to the games . 
  everyone 's talking like the idiot amateur was forced into the ring . 
   he gets mad at a car for riding up on him as he passes another bike without checking behind him ? 
  and then he rages ? 
  more like he passes another bike while not paying attention until the horn startles him and his immidiate reaction is to tell the car to fuck off since it 's too late to correct his mistake anyway . 
   this look too real to be a set up, 
  daily reminder that people really are this oblivious . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't , but the whole game was designed with the possibility of calling it warhammer : the game or whatever if they were able to finalize their agreement with games workshop . 
  the deal fell through but the game was almost finished so they just renamed the whole thing . 
  in wc2 they could do whatever they wanted with the universe they started , hence the 2 new factions and a bunch of other stuff . 
  you need to stop saying stupid shit on the internet and then backtracking with `` i was n't being literal '' . 
  eh either i 'm missing out on something or you 're hyper sensitive to anything related to homosexuality because there 's nothing especially bad about the comments . 
  you see worse hate speech and inappropriateness in an average cat video that reaches reddit front page . 
  this game was amazing in my childhood and it was also what brought me and my first `` real '' girlfriend together 10 years later . 
  so many nights spent taking turns playing crash 3 . 
  she 'd clear the levels and i 'd get the time challenges . 
  it really had n't aged in a decade . 
  i do n't have an ipad but the twitch player on my phone has never showed an ad . 
  maybe try alternatives in the app store ? 
  that 's not even dota, 
  i do n't get it, 
  why do the camera guys have those bacteria masks on ? 
  well i think it 's a bit odd starting the `` game '' this early . 
  it would make more sense to start the show once she 's already been up for a long time , otherwise it 's some damn boring tv . 
  watch this person who 's been up for a regular amount of time complete various non-challenging tasks . 
  they used to back in windows xp times but i know what you mean , there 's no reason to not update your windows . 
  i 'm not op though and still having a pirated windows most likely means you installed it yourself . 
  i know it 's a 15 minute process but it 's still more than most people can do . 
  i find it strange how quickly the game went from `` old time goofy hockey '' to modern hockey around 1985 ( ~ 7 minutes in ) . 
  the change is really apparent when watching footage from different years in a row like this . 
  goalies especially got their shit together . 
  you do know that even professional athletes do n't look like male models from underwear commercials ? 
  and athletes do n't even have to withstand harsh weather with minimal cover like soldiers do . 
  the optimal `` fitness '' in terms of performance and efficiency is not the `` shredded '' look you see in movies or bodybuilding contests . 
  in fact the people who compete in those contests lose a significant amount of their raw power when they cut their weight for the shows , they practice at a much higher weight than they compete in . 
  i know what a dad joke is , but i do n't get the joke . 
  what do church benches have to do with finger guns ? 
  e. ok they 're also called `` pews '' . 
  til, 
   usually because they 're not wearing a suit with it, 
  that 's not why . 
  i have n't noticed any blurriness in my minimap after putting - novid in my launch options . 
  the only thing they changed with oracle was they removed the invis from his ulti . 
  everything else is the same, 
  yeah who cares what the viewers want , we have to convince old people that esports is serious business !, 
   but for the entirety of a professional sports ' balance and direction to be tied to one man is a dangerous affair, 
  sounds a lot like what north american sport leagues are doing with their commissioners or presidents who often enjoy long periods in office .
