  how is having your nickname in this pic any different from having it on everyone 's screen when you 're playing the game ? 
  what is this then ? 
   welcome to tuscaloosa county alabama , u.s.a , and the production location of the mercedes-benz m-class , r-class , gl-class , the c-class for the north american market and the brand new 2016 gle coupe suv . 
   we build the m-class , r-class , gl-class , c-class and now the gle coupe here in alabama using mbusi 's original production system which is a combination of american , japanese , and german automotive best practices . 
   jumped on as evidence of jackson being racist , when it was literally an answer about pb & j, 
  how fucking delusional do you have to be to think that ryder10 or anyone that upvoted his comment actually thought jackson 's answer was `` evidence of being a racist '' ? 
  it 's a joke . 
  it 's a mean spirited joke because the person is seen as a con artist by many users of this site but it 's still a joke . 
  everyone knows he was talking about pb & j and that his views on pb & j probably do n't reflect his views on racial segregation . 
  i ca n't understand what he 's saying . 
  i get the overall message but what the fuck does `` my responbility not appear 2 retract '' mean ? 
  damn son will they ever stop getting bigger ? 
  can you imagine how infuriating it 'd be if the mm bots could actually do anything ? 
  no they should n't . 
  bots should n't even be able to fire a weapon . 
  they should sit in spawn and wait for the first person to die and take over . 
  having actually functional bots in a `` competetive '' match would be incredibly annoying . 
  i 'm not defending frankie as a whole but there 's something really strange about that tweet . 
  it 's unlike any other tweets in his channel . 
  he does n't use language like that in his video descriptions either . 
  yes he does use the '' :d '' smilie occasionally but that 's a far from `` u shud b aware claim by mod tho '' . 
  if we look at all his latest tweets before this one :, 
  @sadaplays hey sada , when you 're back come on skype , need to fix some stuff :d, 
  @joinsquad hey , would very much like to try out the squad , if there is any way i can get in to record a bit !, 
  @miniladdd yes , that would be awesome , have sent you a dm , thanks, 
  @johnbscv hey , i heard you had a whitelisted rok server that people can play in ? 
  @dirtydeathdog hey , i wondered if you could confirm if universal soldier aim and ads sensitivity slider were going to be in hardline release, 
  @armawasteland hey , could you sort out my profile thing , it did n't save data in koth, 
  @dirtydeathdog would it be possible to put mouse sensitivity into the config file on release so people on pc can change it precisely, 
  they 're totally legible english . 
  then suddenly, 
  @totalbiscuit u shud b aware claim by mod tho my responbility not appear 2 retract 0_o ... emaild yt 3 day ago hav faith !, 
  it 's very peculiar . 
  i would n't even be that surprised if next we hear the `` hacked account '' defense . 
  i guessed correctly because the title said `` in a higher difficulty '' . 
  i know about the character limit . 
  i 'm just saying he has n't let the character limit affect his use of language too much before .

  gold actually does do anything . 
  it doubles the amount of subreddits you can have on your front page and adds a number of useful features like highlighting all the new comments since your last visit to a comment thread and allowing you to filter out subreddits from r/all . 
  i used to buy it for myself just for the features . 
  i would still like to have gold but i 'm not giving pao another cent . 
  did you read the post ? 
  i know where the vod is , i 've even watched the vod . 
  i want the replay file since i 'd like to know how puppey jungled and the first time they even show puppy in the vod is when he 's already completed tranquils and a midas . 
  new to downloading pro replays ? 
  yes . 
  tinker immortal, 
  huskar immortal, 
  luna immortal, 
  leshrac immortal, 
  that 's probably the reason for his guess, 
  i do n't get why voat.co advertises that they never ask for your e-mail . 
  i want them to ask for my email . 
  i have an account and i ca n't remember the password or the username . 
  i remember my email . 
  you ca n't realistically expect people to remember their usernames and passwords to every single site on the internet , there 's a reason password recovery is a standard feature on every other site except apparently voat.co, 
  who downvoted this ? 
  it is the source . 
  though she 's apparently had even more surgeries on her face since the last time i saw her blog . 
  if only the content was, 
  the shutter speed probably depends on the lighting, 
  yeah but `` shutter speed '' still affects each individual column in a rolling shutter . 
  yeah but i do n't understand how firing these people is about making profits . 
  surely their salaries ca n't have that noticable of an impact on a site of this scale ? 
  it 's not about firing a single person . 
  read the threads about it before posting . 
  no i 'm not . 
  i said i do n't think it would 've been a justified shooting even if the gun was real . 
  how is that defending the cop ? 
  he will . 
  his audience was never from csgo . 
  they 're from dayz , arma life mods , battlefield and survival games like rust etc. 
  he only recently started playing csgo and his core audience does n't even understand what he 's accused of . 
  if you never played cs yourself and do n't read this sub his whole `` i set up my own bunnyhop server '' seems like a perfectly believable story and comparing it to using mods in a singleplayer game sounds reasonable as well . 
  no shit ? 
  the guy calling it flaming must 've been dead serious as well . 
  wow i did n't even think about it but i actually did go for a walk outside today . 
  it 's not like me to leave the house . 
   look what 's happened to him, 
   dude could 've just fallen on hard times, 
  i think `` falling on hard times '' fits the definition of `` look what 's happened to him '', 
  yeah but most women wear makeup . 
  saying someone looks young for 50 takes that into account . 
  you do n't even know which machine it is . 
  while i love getting high in the morning i 'd hate smoking my last weed in the morning . 
  i would vote 7pm and watch movies etc. 
  until going to bed and waking up to a sober day . 
   i would n't say that most women wear makeup, 
   initially i thought riki 's invis but after thinking about it i realised no one would notice you unless you were physically assaulting them . 
  yeah what 's the point of being invisible if you cant even assault people during it kappa, 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  bb has one of the most annoying voices in the game . 
  i never even tried the announcer pack because playing bristle is punishment enough ( also because l i n a b o i s ), 
  it wo n't . 
  it 'll be fun for a game or two and once you know all the lines you 'll turn it off, 
  i really like lina 's rampage, 
  well too bad for you then, 
  people really play differently in ranked/unranked ?
