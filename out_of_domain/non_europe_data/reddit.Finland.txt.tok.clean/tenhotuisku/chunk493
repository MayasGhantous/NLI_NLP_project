  the next day he could join in right where i was in the game and it even balanced the xp so that me playing alone would n't cause him to be too underleveled . 
  and i could drop him some loot i had gotten while playing alone . 
  it really blew my mind as a kid . 
  charmander was by far the most popular pick and squirtle was second . 
  nobody picked bulbasaur . 
  my favourite was already posted but i ca n't believe nobody mentioned [ 1080 snowboarding ] ( http://emu.kulichki.net/screens/51/63/2.jpg ) for n64 . 
  it 's kinda hard to understand from the pic so here 's a video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu8wbsom6e&amp;t=20s, 
  yeah i did n't complete the riddler challenges but this shit was by far the most difficult part of the game . 
  that fucking crosshair tho, 
  why is she so unreasonably angry, 
  i pay 9.90 $ for 100/100, 
  it 's not so much an aimhack he 's accuses of using . 
  think of it as a wallhack that functions by focusing your crosshair on the nearest enemy instead of having full x-ray vision . 
  in a situation where you already have a hunch so you wo n't be turning sudden 180s it could be very effective and difficult to spot even if a judge can see your screen ( as the enemy being there wo n't be visible on your screen ) and the likelihood of observers following your screen is less than 1/10 and even then it 's a very quick motion if you are n't looking for it . 
  but when you do it enough times over enough tournaments people start to notice patterns, 
  because the scene is flooded with never players who believe without a vac ban you 're innocent . 
  no one has been found guilty of cheating in the csgo scene without an automatic flag from either vac or esea anti-cheat systems . 
  it 's like people forgot replay analysis is a legit method . 
  now flusha does n't play esea and everyone over dmg knows just how effective vac is ( it 's complete garbage ) so valve nor any of the other organizers have had the balls to step in . 
  it does n't help that fnatic is one of if not the best pro team and csgos popularity has been climbing like crazy largely thanks to the pro scene . 
  finding a member of the # 1 team guilty of cheating is n't in valve 's financial interest . 
  nether swap is one of the strongest skills in the game . 
  i hate to say this but your attitude sounds like the infamous `` it does no dps therefore it 's useless '' mindset . 
  it should n't be too difficult to understand why an instant bkb-piercing swap that works on both enemies and allies can be immensly powerful in a game largely about positioning . 
  e. also it breaks channeling . 
  through bkb, 
  yeah and do n't forget the effect of the positive aura . 
  especially when it 's physical damage which is the kind also affected by wave, 
   if she was going to f \\* ck some n \\* gger , i 'd rather have her marry an 8-foot-tall n \\* gger, 
  good thing they censored out those letters so i did n't have to read such naughty words, 
  is n't that like 3/4 of what people use snapchat for ? 
  every cam `` model '' and c-list celebrity has a snap chat for titty pics, 
   it 's only `` decent '' because the 3.5 / 0.5 gb thing makes it hard to call the 970 good, 
  that 's retarded . 
  even with 3.5 gb it 's still a very powerful card . 
  the 3.5 / 0.5 became a big thing because nvidia lied and did n't come clean about it before the evidence was dug up by some hobbyists and the media . 
  nvidia being untrutful with its customers is the issue , not the fact that it 's a 3.5 gb card . 
  had they advertised it as such with the exact same performance and test results people would have nothing bad to say . 
  why does she hate it ? 
  i love my desktop pc but i 've never used a laptop that felt better than a macbook pro . 
  everything from build quality to the touchpad and the responsiveness and ease-of-use of the os for the kind of things you usually do with a laptop it 's unparalleled and i 've used a lot of ( mostly dell and lenovo ) laptops . 
  i usually ended up with a successful sim who 's completed her career path and lives in a beautiful house until got bored around the time i had to start micromanaging multiple generations . 
  i played that game for hundreds of hours and never killed any of my sims . 
  the internet has since taught me that i was probably the only one . 
  it 's a new one, 
  `` i do n't know if brooke was fucking the black guy 's son , '', 
  `` i mean , i do n't have double standards . 
  i mean , i am a racist , to a point , fucking niggers . 
  but then when it comes to nice people and shit , and whatever . '', 
  `` i mean , i 'd rather if she was going to fuck some nigger , i 'd rather have her marry an 8-foot-tall nigger worth a hundred million dollars !, 
  like a basketball player !, 
  `` i guess we 're all a little racist . 
  yeah but nobody would be surprised if he lost his job if he had any at this point . 
  removing him from wall of fame just sounds silly , the thought would 've never crossed my mind . 
  it sounds like a total panic move that 's causing more damage than it 's supposed to clean up . 
  yeah but the funny thing is this sounds like it hurts their image a lot more than anything hulk hogan said . 
  i mean i 'm a liberal european and even i think it 's completely ridiculous . 
  what 's the average wrestling fan going to think ? 
  the only type of social justice warriors who i can imagine supporting this decision are definitely not the kind of people i imagine watching wwe anyway . 
  yeah it 's a racist rant about a guy he suspects is sleeping with his daughter . 
  it 's more than reasonable to assume he 's speaking out of anger and not just casually hating a race . 
  and even if he was , that still does n't mean he did n't do all the wrestling he did . 
  i understand firing him or not using him in promotional material anymore etc. 
  but wiping away history and removing any mention of him from the hall of fame ? 
  there 's no way to defend that . 
   bad things have always happened to good economies, 
  blaming katainen for the financial crisis is like blaming obama for mass shootings or w. bush for 9/11 . 
  just because a person or people were in power during a time of crisis does n't mean said crisis was the fault of those people .

  yeah and if his mom had n't fucked his dad this would n't be happening either so maybe we should blame them ? 
  or maybe adam and eve ? 
  blaming anyone but wwe for wwe 's stupid reaction is ridiculous . 
  if he was an analyst it would n't matter . 
  it 's not like all the current caster personalities we have speak perfect english . 
  i get why but at the same time it 's kinda sad . 
  the ti4 practice area sounds like the highest level of play lan ever . 
  i actually just realized i 've never played a single game of dota with in-game music . 
  first thing i did after installing was disable music and screen shake , the rest came with time . 
  i have never wanted another announcer pack after lina but this one i 'd actually buy with real money, 
  seven dollars is more than the combined value of my bank account and wallet, 
  yeah which is why i almost always play cm, 
  start by getting said decent pc, 
  do n't even need 100 $, 
  something like a 40 $ gpu is on a totally different level than any integrated one , especially if you do n't mind buying used, 
  so in your mind the only possible motivation one could have to better their life would be to make a good impression to others ? 
  except i think op is missing the point a little . 
  self posts do n't give karma . 
  requiring self posts is a way to counter repost bots and the like who for some incomprehensible reason want to raise their karma points . 
  but op himself mentioned that the problem is self-promotion . 
  these people who are the problem do n't care about karma points . 
  a self post could be used as advertisement just like a regular post . 
  i do n't get how requiring self posts combats the issues in any way . 
  it 's like 3 clicks with any camera or phone manufactured in the 21st century . 
  she 's the problem , not the computer . 
  4chan has discussion ten times smarter than that sub .
