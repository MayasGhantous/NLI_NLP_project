  bread with cold cuts , cheese , lettuce , vegetables ( mostly cucumber , bell pepper or tomato ), 
  m\u00fcsli ( the non-sweet kind with nuts and dried fruit etc. 
  but no sugar frosting ), 
  porrige, 
  eggs ( & bacon ), 
  leftovers from yesterday 's dinner, 
  all of these are pretty common here afaik . 
  i think some type of sandwhich is the most popular choice , typically on dark rye bread . 
  sweet foods are n't usually even served as an option for breakfast at hotels or workplaces etc. 
  maybe a piece of chocolate with coffee but it 's like a dessert . 
  e. finland, 
  i 've had my filco for years and since purchasing it have n't had any urge to buy another one with the only exception being this identical keyboard with blue switches . 
  i 'm not saying it 's better than everyone else 's . 
  i 'm saying it fulfills all my needs as well as i can imagine . 
  it feels great to use and it 's the ideal compromise between size and number of keys . 
  if i was god and had infinite power to change whatever i want with it i would n't change a thing . 
  in my eyes it 's the closest thing to perfection any consumer product i 've seen in my life has been . 
  it 's very easy to say i will stick with this keyboard till i die or it breaks because unlike any other electronic i 've purchased in my life this keyboard has killed all interest i have in getting a new one . 
  i 'm subrscribed here and see other keyboards and recognize their merits or cool looks but the thought `` i want that '' simply has n't crossed my mind . 
  i have never had this feeling with any other product . 
  there 's always a new one that 's marginally better and you secretly desire despite being content with your purchase and sticking with the old one . 
  just not this time . 
   italy is great for lunch , dinner , drink , and dessert , but i never really liked the breakfast . 
  yeah i agree . 
  i 'm a huge fan of italian and french cuisine but their idea of breakfast is just off putting to me . 
  not in a `` not my favourite '' type of way but genuinely physically repulsive way . 
  it makes me nauseous to eat something this sweet right after waking up . 
  obviously everthing i 've said is a personal opinion and is not even trying to present any universal truth . 
  i 'm guessing the hotel recognizes they serve international guests . 
  croissants are common but none of the other things you mentioned are finnish breakfast foods . 
  what type of cake ? 
  like birthday cake ? 
  if you search google for the finnish word for breakfast [ these ] ( http://www.ruokatieto.fi/sites/default/files/styles/content-max-image/public/ruokakasvatuksen%20kuvat/hyv%c3%a4%20tavaton%20-materiaalin%20kuvat/aamiainen-320x211_1.jpg ) [ top ] ( http://anna.fi/wp-content/uploads/images/ellitfi/liikunta-ja-terveys/ravinto-ja-laihdutus/aamn590.jpg ) [ results ] ( http://www.helmisimpukka.fi/teille-parempaa-ruokaa/fi_fi/aamiainen/_files/88850113599112983/default/helmisimpukka_aamiainen_plate ) are a pretty good indication of what the locals eat . 
  i do n't bother with incognito since i 'm the only one that uses this computer but i got `` nothing found . '', 
  as well . 
  it seems ublock and/or disconnect alone are enough . 
  well even if it is a character it 's not like he can just get home and take off all those [ wonderful tattoos ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d2/16/9c/d2169c23d239a1431996816e9729cb80.jpg ), 
  yeah one of the main selling points of reborn when it was initially announced ( before even the beta release ) was increased performance especially on lower end machines, 
  i get solid 100 + fps but really with this hardware and how dota looks it should never fall under what my fps_max is . 
  to be fair homework in finland is practically never graded unless it 's like a presentation or a big project . 
  i honestly ca n't say i did much of any homework after elementary school and it did n't hurt my grades . 
  most teachers had a `` do this if you feel like you need additional practice '' attitude . 
  even the classes with mandatory homework just required you to try , not actually get it right . 
  late starting times could be referring to high school and how everyone makes their own schedules instead of starting 8am every day . 
  there were times i would n't have any classes before 10 for an entire semester and often go in at lunch . 
  did you not go to school yourself ? 
  were you homeschooled ? 
  not only is masturbation a part of sex ed a casual joke or a remark would n't cause any reaction from people . 
  the / s always ruins the joke, 
  it can take a few hours to peak, 
  honestly i 'm more surprised than anything that 180k people live that high up north, 
  any idea how old that building is ? 
  yay 5 year old games, 
  yet they still manage to fuck it up every time, 
  it 's not that uncommon on shitposting forums . 
  if you post mainly reaction images and one word answers 30k in a year is pretty easy . 
  as close to the coast as possible too, 
  i do n't understand the need to divide a country up into smaller pieces , especially in euro countries where everyone lives within good ping of each other . 
  we 're on the internet , as long as we speak the same language why the fuck would i care whether you live 2km or 200km from me ? 
  it does happen . 
  there are both twitch streamers that people have dug up nude webcam recordings of and people on sites like chaturbate that play videogames . 
   you ca n't top kaceytron , she 's a fucking genius . 
  i would n't know because i do n't watch that shit, 
  lp is a much worse punishment than a ban . 
  a ban you can just wait out . 
  it requires zero effort . 
  dota is a f2p game so you can just make another account and play unranked if you want to play that badly . 
  low prio requires you to sit on your computer for up to an hour playing a game where nobody even pretends they 're trying . 
  you ca n't afk or abandon because it wo n't count . 
  i 've been to one lp game because of a party member and it was absolute suffering . 
  it felt like work . 
  and you have to sit through it up to 16 times . 
  no matter how long you wait it wo n't go away , you have to endure it . 
  if i ever got enough reports or abandons to get punished i 'd take a 2 week ban over 5 games of lp with no hesitation . 
  for two days ? 
  i 've had two or three blackouts in my life but they all lasted around 5 minutes . 
   isp 's inability to keep service up even in clear weather, 
  in the last 10 years i 've had less than 6 hours of internet downtime tbh . 
  and those were on two instances so it 's not like constant little outages . 
  the upside of living in a city . 
  nice bald spot, 
  so you do n't have to listen to their shit, 
  yea yea yea whatever just get under the table, 
   how has apple surpassed microsoft ? 
  in the value of the company, 
  i would n't try to make it a pc versus mac thing or try to argue which one we would be `` in dire shit without '' but apple did surpass microsoft in estimated company value a long time ago few years after the launch of iphone and [ apparently ] ( http://bgr.com/2015/02/11/apple-vs-google-microsoft-market-cap/ ) is now worth more than microsoft and google combined, 
  as of now the [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/companies/apple/ ) [ estimates ] ( http://www.forbes.com/companies/microsoft/ ) have apple more than doubling the worth of microsoft, 
  i have avira antivirus and run ccleaner and malwarebytes regularly, 
  the torrent software i currently use is qbittorrent . 
  before that i had an old version of utorrent ( 2.2.1 i think ) and tried transmission in between . 
  no other torrent programs have been installed on this computer and the issue was identical on all, 
  i do n't have any programs installed that i do n't know what they are ( basically just photoshop and a bunch of video games ), 
  what exactly is a nic ? 
  i have a network card that 's integrated into my motherboard that 's plugged directly into the rj45 hole in the wall, 
  everything about your comment screams fanboy . 
  i have a windows pc too , i can just accept facts . 
  my motherboard is the z97 sniper g1 by gigabyte and the network card is something by killer networks that came with it, 
  i like how all the pictures have these sassy captions up until the 16th pic which is just boobs no explanation necessary, 
  also throw them at people and have the teacher wonder why none of the mice in the computer class work, 
   my biggest peeve though is people still buy the 970 . get a 960 / or 980 or go amd .
