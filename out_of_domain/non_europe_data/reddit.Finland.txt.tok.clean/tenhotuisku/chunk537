  but you should n't be . 
  a consumer should n't feel the need to be `` loyal '' to the company they purchased goods from . 
  they should aim to remain neutral and actively encourage feedback and communication even if it is in the form of extremely negative criticism or asking tough questions cig would n't want raised . 
  it is not your job as a customer to act as the pr department of the company . 
   i would have slept with him, 
  well from what i gathered op did already sleep with him . 
  why is `` squadron 42 package '' even a thing ? 
  is it possible to buy star citizen and not get sq42 or vice versa ? 
  i actually play quite a bit of dota and while the flaming in the game is rampant the online communities like the subreddit or d2g are n't bad at all . 
  nowhere near as bad as the sc forums . 
   the dota community legit made my friends and i quit mobas . 
  sounds like a bitch move tbh, 
  yeah but people who bother to click into the comments are usually the ones who object strongly enough to voice their opinion . 
  the comments being against op does n't undo the fact that it was voted to the top of the subreddit and even after all the comments remains at a positive value . 
  like exchangeable engines , additional weapon mounts , shield generators , storage space and warp drive upgrades etc. 
  that affect performance but not fully customizable like some games that literally let you build a ship out of `` legos '' . 
  but it 's not accessing the game . 
  it 's a tiny tech demo . 
  `` early access '' typically means they release the full game in the state it 's currently in but with the label that it 's not finished and new content will be added before `` final release '' . 
  the arena commander module you can access now in sc is a vr training simulator akin to little more than a tutorial . 
  what the fuck are you even on about ? 
  i never said i asked for them to release anything . 
   the community is not some rabid , culty fanbase . 
  at this point i knew you were in complete denial and did n't bother reading the rest of your comment . 
   you have to mute 90 % of the people you meet because they 're almost always some toxic asshole who ca n't take any sort of criticisms or some braindead idiot, 
  are you familiar with the saying `` if you run into an asshole in the morning , you ran into an asshole . 
  if you run into assholes all day , you 're the asshole . '' ? 
  i 've never had to mute 90 % of players . 
  hell i 've probably muted less than 1 % of the players i 've played with . 
  all these retards advocating piracy . 
  you ca n't pirate pc games anymore since they need about 40 different patches to work properly and nobody bothers uploading and recracking them after the first few . 
  enjoy bug ridden press release copies, 
  only thing shittier than this post was the title, 
  torrentleech mostly, 
  i do n't even know what site you 're referring to . 
  i used to get games off of sct but ever since that was taken down i 've been using tl . 
  does n't have to be that obscure . 
  most indie games just get their release date gog version uploaded and nobody bothers with the updates . 
  and who does n't play indie games in 2015 ? 
   it 's the trolls who get downvoted ... sooo what are you saying about yourself ? 
  nice circle logic . 
  trolls get downvoted so questioning the circlejerk makes you a troll . 
  i am a backer myself . 
  star citizen is still a cult . 
  it 's not a scam because chris roberts believes it himself . 
  you were n't kidding, 
   his five sons are george jr. , george iii ( `` monk '' ) , george iv ( `` big wheel '' ) , george v ( `` red '' ) , and george vi ( `` little joey '' ) . 
  she 's in a porno . 
  she never was an innocent/shy girl . 
  what 's a protest without some fire ? 
  the women showing their boobs are protesting women 's rights in russia . 
  putin giving a thumbs up is pretty much saying `` nice tits '' while totally ignoring the message . 
  you can see how that 's possibly bad pr especially abroad . 
   he 's a fucking supervillian, 
  implying putin is noticeably worse than american politicians . 
  oh no he 's protecting his own country 's interests . 
  that means he 's ** evil ** since we are ** good ** . 
  just the fact that you compare chris roberts to mlk says more than enough about the sc community . 
   on 1 dota post, 
  i 've been a subscriber of both subreddits for years . 
  i just linked that one post since the comment i was replying to mentioned mobas specifically and when i went to see what 's up on / r/dota2 today that was the top post . 
  yes . 
  the journalist and the editor of escapist are to blame for poor journalism . 
  however all newegg did was link an article that linked to another article . 
  they said `` hey this sounds interesting , you should take a look '' . 
  serious allegations such as the ones made by escapist fully warrant looking into even if they and there is nothing wrong with sharing the story on facebook , especially when it contained the response by cgi as well . 
  not only did the sc subreddit want to kill the topic instead of talking about the possible issues brought up and demanding a response by cgi they did it before the sources were even discredited . 
  the post still ended with over 250 more upvotes than downvotes even after all the negative comments and at the time had a much bigger percentage of upvotes than it does now . 
   what 's your point ? 
  my point is that just because i did n't analyze every single post ever made in the message it does n't mean i 'm basing my judgement on those two posts alone . 
  i 've been a subscriber and avid reader of both dota2 and starcitizen subreddits because i own/play both games . 
  yes you did . 
  my comment explicitly stated his name and you copied my sentence and switched the name . 
  that is a textbook example of a comparison no matter how you try to twist it . 
  yes but have n't you seen the reddit blog posts that less than 10 % of people ever even go to the comment section ? 
  it 's an everyday occurance to have a til post for example voted to the top of the front page while the top comment states how the post is complete bullshit . 
  comments do n't reflect the community nearly as well as the votes do and the overall sum of votes is largely positive . 
  it was even more positive on the day when it happened when all the rabid fans were upvoting it and has since received downvotes from other threads that link to it ( such as this ) as more level headed users have arrived in the thread . 
  i also included d2g and the cig official forums into the comparison . 
  the official forums are much , much worse than the subreddit . 
  it 's also like this for hockey in [ finland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zduxfye.png ) . 
  good luck finding a place without a tv if olympic/wc playoffs are on . 
  i think i remember seeing during the last olympics there was actually a bar that advertised `` come to the only place that does n't show hockey '' . 
  did you mean to type everyone ? 
  sexual harrasment panda is still pretty funny, 
  the original bikini commercial part is real . 
  it 's just the animals humping that is n't if you could n't figure that out yourself by the audio clearly looping . 
  i do n't even know where to go for pc indie games after wtf is ... ends, 
  tb lives in the us as well, 
  no one cares how you feel about his videos no matter what language you speak, 
  there was nothing passive agressive about my comment but you 're welcome nevertheless . 
  top banter, 
  the quote is from the scene where jared leto gets beaten to pulp . 
  the picture i think is just promotional material . 
  i do n't know but his vote count suddenly went from -20 ish to +100 while my response went from +5 ish to -50 all within a few minutes so i 'm guessing someone takes internet points seriously and asked srs or similiar to help . 
  giant bomb can be pretty fucking biased at times . 
  they did n't even mention the shitstorm that was arkham knight pc release in any of their arkham knight videos because ( allegedly ) they 're buddies with rocksteady . 
  `` european country '', 
  i 've never eaten it but i 've seen it both on reddit and on tv/youtube many times . 
  man vs food has had them for sure .
