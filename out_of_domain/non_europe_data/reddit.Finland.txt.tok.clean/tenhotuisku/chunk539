  to get people to know about it , talk about it and ultimately watch it ? 
  this is like that but even better because it 's not a blatant ad . 
  it 's a genuinely funny moment that happened in the show now seen by millions of people who probably did n't even see it originally when it happened . 
  the clip portrays the show in a favourable light . 
  the main goal of a commercial tv station is to get as many viewers as possible so they can ask as much money as possible for the commercial breaks . 
  more exposure and advertising means more viewers . 
  more viewers means more ad revenue . 
  it 's not that funny . 
  it 's chocolate dicks . 
  if you do n't have kids it 's just lame . 
  if you have kids and they 're your facebook friends it becomes awkward . 
  i live in europe and twitch has n't lagged or buffered or anything even once since they upped their server capacity in 2012, 
  also fuck mlg for using their own site . 
  the best part about twitch is the instant vods . 
  the latest fod on mlg 's website is from july . 
  yeah but you ca n't blame the customer for not actively seeking out this information . 
  the dota2 viewer demographic is used to going on twitch and seeing if anything is happening . 
  only when i was about to queue and noticed an interesting sounding game in the in-game main menu did i realize mlg was even happening . 
  the strangest part is it 's mlg who suffer from it the most . 
  both twitch and mlg chat update instantly for me, 
  you did n't answer the question . 
  on which one ? 
   but unless it effects viewership in the future ( and it wo n't ), 
  why would it not ? 
  it 's not a coincidence fox pays real money to have ads for their shows on billboards and websites etc. 
  why would the attention gathered by those work to increase viewership but not the attention gathered by a viral video ? 
  if i did n't want to cook myself why would i be looking at recipes ? 
   lots of classic recipes use specific branded products as ingredients . 
  sounds like an american thing . 
  you people even use brand names as generic terms for things . 
  pretty disgusting tbh . 
  americans consider heating precooked food `` cooking '' . 
  if you ca n't make cake better than cake mix you 're just shit at what you 're trying to do . 
  i have been here for a while and i did watch mlg when starcraft 2 was still a new game . 
  even then it was `` why do we have to use this shit site '' and that was 4 years ago . 
  having had that shit site for a long time does n't make it more acceptable . 
  also 5 years ago it was different because it was still pretty common to have your own player . 
  gomtv had their own site and blizzard did as well . 
  twitch only became the center of the esports world a year or two later . 
  that does n't mean they should try to stick with what marginally worked 5 years ago . 
  times change . 
  another thing is absolutely no one streams on mlg so the only reason to go to their website is the mlg events which are like twice a year . 
  i 'm not going to check a website every day to see if today is the date of one of those biannual events . 
  people regularly check twitch because there 's something happening every day . 
  i do n't use this site or any other site to check for dota2 events because ** literally every other event except for mlg ** is on twitch . 
  i do n't need a 3rd party site when twitch already works perfectly for every single tournament all year round ** except for one ** . 
  you ca n't expect me as a viewer to change all my ways to accommodate one single mid-tier tournament and in the end mlg is only hurting itself by thinking it 's the viewers responsibility to go the extra mile to find out about them . 
  actually the last time i baked anything was about 8 hours ago . 
  i 'm also good enough at it that i do n't need to use prepackaged shit in fear of messing up the proportions so i can use much , much higher quality ingredients than anything found in cake mix . 
  to me it 's honestly a sad thought someone would think cake mix is `` simply better '' than doing it yourself . 
  it 's like saying mcdonalds is better than barbecuing your own hamburger . 
  today ? 
  cookies, 
  i 'm not saying i do n't `` get it '' . 
  i 'm saying the guy 's an absolute idiot if he thinks cake mix is `` simply better '' than what can be made from scratch . 
  i understand the convenience , but if it tastes better than what someone can make themself that 's fully on them . 
  pretty regular chocolate chip, 
   the regular customer just goes either to joindota , gosugamers , dota2lounge , reddit etc to find the streams . 
  no they do n't . 
  the average customer goes to twitch when they want to watch streams . 
  joindota , gosugamers etc. 
  are extremely niche and frankly there is hardly any reason to use them in 2015 . 
   again , if you have issues finding information that is right in your face , that is more of a personal issue, 
  but it 's not . 
  a business ca n't blame their potential or lost customers because they did n't find the service . 
  that 's 100 % on the business every time no matter whose `` fault '' you 'd like to think it is . 
  i 'm not complaining because i feel like i was mistreated . 
  i 'm saying it 's a terrible way to run a business . 
  i watched all of ti5 . 
  i watch every series of esl new york . 
  i watched most of the group stages and all of the playoffs of dac . 
  i watched the entirety of the last esl before new york . 
  i did n't see any of mlg . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  the website . 
  i do n't have anything against mlg or the teams or the tournament itself . 
  they just lost a potential customer because of their poor way of managing the event and not even because i was protesting but because i simply did n't even know it was happening . 
  that 's their loss as a business , that 's not my loss . 
   not a mass problem . 
  yes it is . 
  mlg 's viewer counts are abysmal compared to events like esl or dac that were on twitch front page . 
  this `` the information is out there if you look for it '' idea that you have is simply put a horrible way to run a business reliant on pageviews . 
  think 10 years ago when people still watched tv . 
  mlg would be like a channel that 's not visible in any listing but if you press a certain combination of buttons it shows up . 
  if you read through the tv guide magazine you 'd know the buttons to press so why did n't you ? 
  because most people just sit down on the couch and watch whatever 's on . 
  twitch is that couch . 
  normies get out, 
  companies already spend ridiculous amounts on viral marketing . 
  it 's not about le ebin karma points . 
   you are a twitch fan/lover and that you miss the ability to spam kappa, 
  hell no i do n't even own a tv . 
  that does n't mean there 's not somebody out there who thinks `` hey that looks like a fun show '' or `` oh i forgot about whatever this is on fox i should tune in again next week '' . 
  do you think ads need to work on everyone to be successful ? 
  do you watch every show you see a billboard for ? 
  probably not but they still keep putting them up , strange huh ? 
  what are cultural differences ? 
  i support gay rights as well in my own country but just because you and i were brought up believe that 's the right thing does n't make it some divine truth or universally applicable . 
  25 % typical female retardedness, 
  but i have less of an issue with leaked pics someone knowingly and willingly took than i do with harassing people with cameras all day every day ?
