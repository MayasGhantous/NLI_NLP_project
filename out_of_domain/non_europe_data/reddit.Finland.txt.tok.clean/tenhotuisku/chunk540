  tells a lot about you that the first thing you think of when you hear the word twitch is n't a easy to use site that handily follows and collects together all the streams and events in the world but a kappa emote . 
  oh i glimpsed at your post history . 
  apparently on your shitty south american connection twitch does n't even work . 
  that explains the sourness . 
  enjoy living in 3rd world, 
  pretty salty post you got there mate, 
  well was n't that exactly what it was ? 
  if not nazi culture then what else was it ? 
   my center of gravity would be behind me, 
  true, 
   i would n't be able to launch myself up to save myself from going down with the car . 
  not true, 
  you can react if the car is starting to move . 
  you do n't have to wait until the last tenth of an inch to jump off, 
  because a vast majority of commenters do n't read more than the title, 
  damn i was n't going to subscribe at first but you caught my interest . 
  do you say that same thing to the doctor every time you go for a check up ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  it 's your own deluded idea that just because something is a `` cultural thing '' it 's automatically `` acceptable '' . 
  i do n't make such distinctions . 
  unsubscribe, 
  when i was a kid the local electronics store had a playstation display but they made the mistake of putting a memory card in . 
  me and my friend played the entirety of spyro 1 & 2 in that store . 
  luckily it was n't too crowded so we did n't have to fight for possession of the controller and the workers did n't mind . 
  we 'd spend hours after school every day playing and always triple saved to minimize the chances of someone overwriting our progress . 
  sorry for blog post . 
  yeah the rules they use in the `` official '' championships are what are commonly known as `` pussy rules '' on the playground . 
  where did i say it 's ok ? 
  could you quote that part of any message i sent ? 
   as someone who have never experienced snow, 
  i know there are millions of people struggling to get a meal every day but hearing sentences like this is what really makes me feel bad for other people . 
  snow is wonderful . 
  when you say `` as someone who has never experienced snow '' to me it sounds the same as `` as someone who has never experienced the sun '' . 
  also this thread is full of finnish people thinking `` how is this not common knowledge ? '', 
   after fresh powder is almost an outer-worldly experience, 
  til my daily commute is an outer wordly experience for some, 
  i do n't even own a car, 
  people give the us shit for having so many fucking cops on payroll but that 's pretty impressive response time . 
   you will never have a gf who cares this much about hockey, 
   i think it 's very difficult to watch nhl in finland, 
  if you do n't care about the time difference it 's extremely easy to watch nhl in finland . 
  viaplay has every single game of the whole season and playoffs in hd with both home and away announcers and it works as a dvr/vod . 
  afaik americans actually have it much worse with local blackouts and whatnot . 
  if you ever decide to follow the domestic league a lot of people prefer to mute the tv broadcast and listen to radio . 
  the radio play by play is not only better but also designed for people who ca n't see the game ( duh ) . 
  if you go to your country 's embassy they will fix you up with a plane ticket . 
  you might get a bill in the mail afterwards but they wo n't leave you hanging in a foreign country if you have a passport . 
   do you think they just give a plane ticket to anyone that asks ? 
  yes . 
  then send you a bill in the mail later . 
  at least that 's how it is if you visit a finnish embassy abroad with a finnish passport . 
  you will never be left alone in a foreign country . 
  is this google translate as well ? 
  because it 's terrible finnish, 
   i 'd love to visit rovaniemi one day . 
  you 'll change your mind after spending 5 minutes in rovaniemi, 
  wow that [ reddit gold theme ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/goldbenefits/comments/33ei8y/introducing_reddit_themes_change_the_appearance/ ) literally looks just like the night mode in res, 
  yeah what assholes giving you money for rent immediately and covering your other expenses a week later when the application went through . 
  surviving two weeks on 30 $ is no feat . 
  but lihapiirakka and ketchup and you have enough left over for some beers . 
   but the situation was , and stll is , completely different, 
   pretty much everyone that meets us makes a comment about, 
  tbh if you 're able to take care of a child none of the comments matter . 
  of course same applies if you are n't . 
  no amount of online comments should convince you that you are/aren ' t capable of raising a child, 
  upvoted for truth . 
  i 'm happy the church helped you out in a tough situation but they 're rolling in money . 
  do n't sacrifice your financial integrity to `` give back '' asap . 
  it 's the fucking church , they 'll be fine if you take a year or two to pay back . 
  tbh that 's just op fucking up . 
  there are no predicament for qualifying for government aid in finland . 
  the only thing you have to prove is that you 're poor enough , no questions asked . 
  your parents have a nice living room wall, 
  i would n't, 
  yes it does but laadukkaampia is, 
  i 'm pretty sure he stopped working months ago , now they 've managed to finalize the papers . 
  you learn to buy with number keys or set keybinds to the f-keys ( if you have those either ) . 
  you have to sacrifice some of the crisp feel to get a totally quiet keyboard . 
  rubber domes can have leds too, 
  people pressed the arrow button next to it, 
   people just wo n't back down from their `` bleliefs '' , no matter what the facts . 
  i 'm not saying 9/11 was an inside job but it 's pretty clear you have this same attitude as well . 
  what about the clip from bbc news where they report wtc7 has collapsed while the building is still clearly visible behind the reporter ? 
  this sub has always had a wide range of content . 
  to be perfectly honest i do n't think most people look at the subreddit it 's posted to when deciding to up/downvote . 
  i upvoted this from my front page because it was a funny observation . 
  even though i agree it should n't be posted on this sub . 
  it 's been a 4chan meme for years but in 2014 [ this comic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ohfelin.jpg ) ( made in 4chan ) was [ posted on reddit ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2lpnot/things_a_pony_would_say/ ) where it was hugely successful and started a trend of jet fuel jokes like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ry05hge.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q31usog.jpg ), 
  before 2014 it was pretty much just used by conspiracy theorists in a serious manner or on / pol / as a semi-joke . 
  in 2014 it became a widespread meme, 
  i honestly thought the whole `` na'vi disbanding ^ ^ ^ announcing ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ new ^ ^ ^ team ^ ^ ^ next ^ ^ ^ week '' thing was just a polite way of finally kicking dendi off the team . 
  oh there 's plenty of lc futa as well do n't you worry child, 
   so far i 've figured out that kappa spawns a little face emote which i do n't know what it means, 
  well it was still fully legible and understandable so you should n't feel too bad . 
   why did you use tuottaa ? 
  that has more of nonphysical feel to me . 
  is that just more common when speaking of something generally like this ? 
  valmistaa is `` manufacture '' and used exclusively when talking about inanimate objects . 
  tuottaa is a much less specific term . 
  it 's like `` finland puts out great goalies '' or `` produces great goalies '' .
