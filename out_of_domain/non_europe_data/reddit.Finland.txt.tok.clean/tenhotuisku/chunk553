  people do n't go to dating sites for the algorithms , they go there to browse the listings . 
  how would you prove that 's the stick from the game though ? 
  stealth archer is the only way to play that feels like doing something . 
  everything else is just running up to enemy and punching until it dies . 
  there 's no strategy or thought involved , just keep hitting and if your health drops pause the game and use one of the million potions in your bag to heal instantly . 
  the fact that you 're trying to think of a fancy car and the best you can come up with is a blinged out toyota is pretty sad . 
  i do n't know if `` sandbox '' qualifies as a genre though . 
  it 's more like a mode . 
  you can have a sandbox mode in anything from city builders and rts 's to spectacle fighters . 
  well yeah but the guy could sell a dozen of the same looking sticks and claim they were all the one, 
  i do n't know i really could n't care less about all that other shit , it 's the dying part that i dislike . 
  wtf winter is n't there ? 
  why would you not invite the best analyst and ultimate draft wizard to any major tournament ? 
  `` code '' is for little kids who try to act cool . 
  if the police is reading your text messages they 'll see straight through it anyway, 
  haha americans are stupid and uneducated, 
  i 'm quite certain even a 9 year old would rather cry a few tears over mean words than have her head sawn off . 
  see how he puts his stick around the opponents leg/knee and presses with like a lever-like bending motion ? 
  that 's arguably hooking . 
  people say `` new toy '' all the time regardless of their age . 
  kids get new toys , middle aged men get new toys , grandmas get new toys . 
  is your hoodie tucked into your underwear ? 
  cool story, 
  it was more like russia annexing territory and rebranding themselves . 
  the kind of people who care enough about balance and pro scene etc. 
  to even visit reddit are probably less cancerous than average, 
  not that reddit is n't shit, 
  i do n't know what it is but huge lips like that always make a person look so stupid . 
  i do n't mean bad , i mean dumb . 
  ca n't you put a switch like that in the drop down menu thing ? 
  was n't that same song in fo3 or nv ? 
  e. [ it was ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/easy_living ), 
   they do n't have ones designed like pens, 
  that you know of, 
  thank god, 
  yeah that was the most cringeworthy part of the video, 
  what cards you get is purely luck but betting is the skill part . 
  no i have n't but even reading the name `` three dog '' brought chills down my spine, 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/njsja58.jpg ) sunny lane is the only sunny lane listed at iafd and she 's 35, 
  2 wins = upper bracket, 
  2 losses = lower bracket, 
  after the first 2 sets of matches one team is 2-0 , one is 0-2 and two are 1-1 . 
  decider decides which one goes 2-1 and 1-2 . 
  i thought this compendium would 've been fine ** if ** it included predictions . 
  the challenges were better than before , the merging of shitty loot for better loot was nice for someone who does n't like buying levels and i especially enjoyed the betting feature . 
  but not having the predictions etc. 
  that actually tie the thing into the event is completely unacceptable . 
  yeah but it 's not like including the ti-like predictions would cost valve huge amounts of money . 
  i 'm not complaining about the amount of skins i got in return for 4 $ but right now it has nothing to do with the frankfurt major . 
   if this product is not for you , do not fucking buy it . 
  the lack of predictions and other tournament relevant content was n't advertised . 
  everyone naturally assumed it to be there since every other compendium has had it . 
  it 's not like including the prediction feature costs valve a lot of money or affects the market in any way . 
  it 's just a nice little thing to tie the whole compendium into the actual event instead of being just another random hat bundle . 
   but in the end , guessing teams , filling out favorites is meaningless and has no return on purchase . 
   getting hats and playing with coins = immediate tangible reward on compendium . 
  i bought the compendium because previous compendiums were fun . 
  i like doing the predictions , i like doing the challenges , i like betting on my games . 
  i value having fun while playing a lot more than my `` return of hat investment '' . 
  ti5 compendium did n't have the predictions etc. 
  either when it was released because the qualifiers were n't finished yet . 
  similarily the fall major qualifiers were still underway when the compendium got released . 
  because only / r/pcmasterrace subs use widescreen displays in 2015, 
  i 'm fine with all the features and the rewards and the balance etc. 
  i just wish it had something to do with the event . 
  it did n't increase the pool , there 's no predictions , there 's no in-game representation of the tournament of any kind . 
  it 's literally just a random hat bundle with frankfurt major logos on it . 
  i also got some tidehunter hoods !, 
  i did n't pay a single cent on top of buying the lvl1 compendium and have opened over 10 coin treasures . 
  also my favourite items were silver and i got both . 
  the rarity tiers do n't really mean shit anymore outside arcanas . 
  you can buy immortals for 30 cents and a lot of them are uglier than rares . 
  that was the worst huskar i 've ever seen . 
  might as well have afk 'd at the fountain while qop , clock and es won the game 3v5, 
  but what exactly is `` adult '' about this ? 
  it 's not even fine cheeses it 's some regular american '' '' `` cheese '' '' '', 
   negative publicity, 
  lol, 
  using delusions to feel better about injustices in the world . 
  great outlook on life and sure to get things done . 
  that 's not cowardly . 
  what they did takes a lot of guts . 
  i do n't agree with it and i do n't promote such acts but you ca n't call it cowardly just because you do n't like it . 
  mothers sacrificing their ( unborn ) babies in the face of fight or flight live or die situations is a very common thing in nature . 
  it 's in our dna too . 
  the unconscious primitive instincts tell you that surviving and being able to reproduce again is more important to the survival of the species than one baby . 
  and it 's true . 
   successfully avoided getting killed through amazing instincts, 
  backing yourself into a corner with no escape route is n't exactly amazing instincts . 
  i did n't say i would do better . 
  i said you 're giving her praise for failing . 
  but i do n't use my beliefs to feel better about this . 
  i do n't believe they got any sort of karmic justice . 
  i believe they got what they wanted . 
  that does n't make me feel good . 
  if you read through this comment section it 's almost certain she did not live . 
  the attackers were seen firing from that same window only minutes later . 
  i do n't know why you would downvote me for telling you the truth . 
  eh . . they were fully aware it would provoke a response from people who ** are ** able to fight back and that is what happened . 
  the gign retaliated and killed them .
