  you 're saying this like `` broken '' is an unacceptable result and `` different '' is the only correct way to approach the issue . 
  you 're just as guilty . 
  mein kampf is n't a great read and i like hitler . 
   moving to another country is not cozy, 
  it 's pretty cozy, 
  you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  well one argument is that when you 're in a monitored voting booth there is literally no way for anyone to influence your vote or even see what you vote . 
  you ca n't be pressured into voting for someone because there is no way to know if you went through with it . 
  if you could do it from your home that security disappears . 
  especially elderly could be coerced into voting for someone they do n't want to and no amount of computer security can fix that . 
  you can tell it 's the 60s because everyone is white, 
  sounds like a nice place to live, 
  and not long before that children 's clothing was basically just smaller adult clothing . 
  none of those three are blondes . 
  yes, 
  yes, 
  american '' '' `` sports '' '' '' . 
  better bring a book in case there 's a break between the marching band and the concert by a pop-rock band that was popular a decade ago . 
  that largely depends on how much stuff you feel like you absolutely have to bring with you . 
  over here lottery pays for junior sports and facilities for sports and arts so i really have no problem if someone voluntarily wants to give their money away for that . 
  besides i get it . 
  nobody thinks it 's a wise investment statistically , that 's not the point . 
  you 're paying for the priviledge to fantasize about winning and for like a dollar that 's not a bad deal . 
  only a redditor would call some light hearted bantz being ignorant tbqh with you senpai, 
  you think if a legal government controlled method of gambling did n't exist those people would just not gamble ? 
  they 'd find a poker game or a raffle or whatever indian casino where the money goes to even worse use or worst case scenario they get robbed . 
   the lottery does n't pay for school stuff , they pay for whatever the government accountants want to say it does . 
  it 's pure slush . 
  stop assuming every place works like where you live . 
  i can go online right now and see a list of programs and how much each one was given from the funds collected via lottery . 
  how on earth is taking ( actually not even taking but accepting ) money from degenerates addicted to gambling and giving it forward to youth sports , arts and science a bad thing ? 
  should n't be that difficult then . 
  find a job , get a job , file some papers , rent a flat . 
  or if you have a eu passport moving to another country is as easy as moving to another part of the city . 
  why is he trying to convince people to not give him anything ? 
  you could 've just installed bluestacks if you were that curious, 
  what everyone learns the first time they smoke weed,

  there 's another game called frozen synapse which is kinda similiar except multiplayer pvp and it 's tons of fun . 
  no clue why it 's gone up to 27 $ on steam since i got it for a few euros like 4 years ago . 
  g2a has it for 1.40 $, 
  how many times does he say `` oh come on '' or `` it 's [ current year ] '' ? 
  so in other words you 'd get a divorce, 
  that 's exactly his point retard . 
  the only mode ea puts any effort into is the microtransaction shitfest . 
  i remembered this was the source , turns out it was n't but i think close enough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elccweket6u&amp;t=1m23s, 
  well if you disabled it and the page still did n't work then obviously the issue is elsewhere, 
  yeah she got them `` filled '' after pregnancy . 
  they actually look better now than they did before . 
  does it really matter though if it 's clearly doable ? 
  well starcraft 2 has never had any issues like this at beta stage , launch or 4 years later . 
  i know it 's a completely different engine and company but there 's a level of competence i think is reasonable to expect from a company that 's basically printing money with this game . 
  you ca n't even use the `` well it 's an old engine not meant for this '' excuse since source 2 was literally built with dota 2 in mind . 
  this sub is shit, 
   it could happen , but it really does n't . 
  rat poison , antifreeze etc. 
  in dog treats does happen though . 
  i 'm not saying it 's common enough to lose sleep over but it happens . 
  i do n't understand how what you said in any way makes anything i said `` not entirely true '', 
  but there is no caption with the image so is the message really `` this is common '' or `` this can be done '' ? 
  you 're easily impressed, 
  or just let it stay there to establish yourself as an alpha male of the pack . 
  but the picture itself does n't state that . 
  the reddit post did n't state that . 
  i do n't really give a fuck where the pic came from and whether it was used in an actual crime or not , that does n't make any difference in `` can it be done ? '', 
  which is the only thing i and a lot of others who see this pic care about . 
  i do n't know anyone who did n't start in bronze and everyone i know is masters . 
  true , but the source 1 engine is n't exactly limiting either and it 's an original product by valve that they can modify as much as they want . 
  they really do n't have any excuses why it ca n't be done when other games with similiar mechanics do n't struggle with them . 
  can you show me 2 pictures that demonstrate how anyone can build an atomic bomb ? 
  hitler did [ plenty of things ] ( https://i.imgur.com/drukt1b.jpg ) wrong . 
  do you have a higher resolution version of that full picture ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the manufacturer 's brand can be seen in the zipper and in the lining . 
  something triangle-like . 
  halti is probably the most well known finnish outdoor clothing manufacturer ( and makes great stuff ) but they 're often a little too expensive to be given as business gifts . 
  if you really want the jacket it should n't be too hard to track down the company and just ask them . 
  purchases like business gifts with the company logo are usually pretty well documented . 
  not a guaranteed success but you got nothing to lose either . 
  i have a 970 and it 's never dipped below 60 fps with all maxed out 1080p in 30 + hours . 
  i liked http://cdn0.wideopenspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/single.jpg, 
  then why did you say, 
  i 've never had any memory leak problems with 16gb and i played it over 12 hrs straight in launch without restarting . 
  i know , i saw the comment . 
  what i 'm asking is why did you start with,
