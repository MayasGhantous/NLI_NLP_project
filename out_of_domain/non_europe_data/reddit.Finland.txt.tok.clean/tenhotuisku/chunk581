  or does it just sit in your inventory ? 
  i want one, 
  it did n't start right when reborn started or otherwise it would 've shown zero for all . 
  maybe a year or so ahead of time . 
  i started playing a little over a year and a half ago and have all these friends who 've been playing since 2011/2012 with thousands of hours more than me and when reborn launched my stats were better than any of them , probably because they had already started playing less and less after the initial hype back when they were n't kept track of . 
  yeah by a guy on a starcraft message board, 
   this could destroy his legacy . 
  as it should ? 
  if he 's guilty of course , but ca n't really see it destroying his `` legacy '' if he 's acquitted . 
  if he 's guilty of match fixing then what the fuck do you care about his `` legacy '' or `` goat status '' ? 
  more awsome gifs at somegif.com, 
  do you people suffer from brain damage or something ? 
  how hard is it to remember builds yourself ? 
  this is not starcraft where you need to memorize exact supply counts and even in starcraft people managed just fine . 
  i 'm not just addressing this message to you but everyone in this comment chain who seem more shocked about `` what will happen to his legacy '' than the actual claims of his involvement with match fixing . 
  if he 's found guilty then there is nothing lost if his `` reputation '' is tarnished . 
  if not then his legacy is not at risk . 
  so why even pay it any attention ? 
  with halfway decent encoding you can easily shrink an hour of 1080p footage to 1 gigabyte . 
  not bluray-quality but equivalent to or better than youtube 1080p ( which is also about 1gb per hour ) . 
  3tb wd red hard drive ( good quality for consumer brand ) costs 100 $ . 
  that means enough space for 4 months of 1080p cameras running 24/7 . 
  frankly i 'd be surprised if an average convenience store did n't have 100 $ in their budget to use on security . 
   4 cameras going and storing data for a month is an insane amount of memory, 
  enough hdd space for 4 cameras to store a month 's worth of 24/7 footage the same quality as youtube 1080p is about $ 110 in total . 
  original ctr is way superior to any mario kart created before or after it, 
  you do realize this is like finding out there 's a `` shoot '' button in fifa ? 
  yeah double dash is my favourite mario kart too but unlike you pretty much everyone i knew either had ctr or played it extensively at friends ' houses . 
  we still play it from time to time . 
  that 's just really shitty encoding . 
  sure you can make it a thousand terabytes if you wish , there 's no limit how big a video file can get . 
  but with modern encoders available for anyone with open source of freeware softwares you can easily reach 1gb per hour with decent quality . 
  just look at any hour long youtube video uploaded in 1080p and try to download it . 
  it 'll be about 1gb and look close to what hdtv looks like . 
  that 's why he has facial hair . 
  flusha has been outed as a cheater a long time ago . 
  at this point it 's simply valve protecting the brand name of csgo by hiding behind the `` if he 's not vac ` ed he 's clean '' excuse . 
  anyone who 's ever played matchmaking knows just how foolproof vac is . 
  it 's absolutely inexcusable that the csgo pro scene pretends it 's this infallible system and the only possible way to `` prove '' a hack when spotting cheaters in competetive games goes back way longer than any of these automated systems . 
  10 years ago in 1.6 nobody would 've taken `` yeah but vac has n't caught him '' seriously and frankly the system has n't improved that drastically compared to how much cheats have improved . 
  they do n't . 
  / r/dota2 does n't censor discussion about scripts though ( dota equivalent of cheats ) or other non-professional acts by pros such as leaking scrim information etc. 
  if anything they encourage it . 
  i take memes and open honesty over this shit any day . 
  but the original post is very sensible with new information . 
  also there 's [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/43agsy/glitchy_wall_on_de_cache_outing_cheaters/czgtub5 ) post which explains a lot about how games are designed and why this is important . 
  how is this less important than shit memes or twitch stream screenshots the front page is full of ? 
  you ca n't be `` neutral '' when the whole concept is very intangible and vaguely defined . 
  they 're not actual witches and nobody 's actually hunting them , right ? 
  so every decision made by a mod is a judgement call and never fully `` neutral '' . 
  maybe they should be . 
  i for one praise the korean authorities for taking esports match fixing very seriously . 
  i see literally nothing wrong with his reaction, 
  well the guy did say `` when i need surgery , i do it myself '' like it 's an ongoing thing that happens from time to time, 
  sebaceous cysts are also completely normal and harmless . 
  as long as they look like [ this ] ( http://0.tqn.com/w/experts/venereal-diseases-2106/2013/08/first_bump.jpg ) not like [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t1ypo6qioh8/vendq0vkdoi/aaaaaaaaare/6pt2450oknq/s1600/photo7518777771111111.png ) . 
  all i can think of is ingrown hair follicles but i 'm really not an expert, 
  / r/blackpeopletwitter, 
  only people who do n't remember ctr are the ones who were n't alive yet . 
  it 's definitely up there as one of the biggest classics of ps1 . 
  sounds like your finance department does n't know dick about technology which is n't that surprising . 
  why is there a goalie in a shooting competition ? 
  yeah maybe if the same movement was used for the actual shot . 
  but it is n't . 
  yeah but edibles are trickier . 
  smoke weed , wait 2 hours , feel sober ? 
  you 're ok to drive . 
  eat an edible , feel sober , you do n't know how you 'll feel 15 minutes from now . 
  i definitely would never drive if there 's even a faint possibility of becoming more intoxicated while doing it . 
  whenever i fly i fall asleep on the runway or at the latest when we reach cruising altitude and wake up when the wheels touch down . 
  feels like a waste of good weed . 
  in the actual scene the ava part alone is 21:32, 
  `` out of your system '' is a pretty vague term as is `` any drugs '' . 
  does n't thc stay in your body for up to weeks ? 
  i would n't put off driving for weeks just because i smoked a joint or because i took ibuprofein . 
  your advice seems more suited for a fantasy world than real life . 
  where in the world do 25 year olds look like that ? 
  he fell over and hit his head on a window frame . 
  the tape literally did nothing to his eye . 
  i was gon na get the ti compendium again but was done with major compendiums after the first one . 
  the single thing that made me change my mind was removal of paying for levels . 
  suddenly the thing is balanced so that rewards are reachable by playing . 
  i have just the dank meme for this occasion http://i.imgur.com/mwguxxk.jpg, 
  just the fact that apparently in america it 's normal for adults to eat breakfast cereal is crazy enough for me . 
  not judging , but it 's strange . 
  no they do n't . 
  the good ones are a part of your plumbing . 
  also known as standard ones installed everywhere if you live in a civilized country like sweden or finland . 
  yeah mainly because there 's one every few years . 
  i ca n't really pinpoint one specific mario kart that would be considered more of a classic than ctr . 
  maybe the n64 one . 
  eggs , bacon , porridge , a simple sandwhich with some cold cuts or cheese or veggies , yoghurt , coffee that kind of stuff . 
  i personally do n't really feel like eating anything sweet in the morning be it cereal or pastry or jam or whatever . 
  well the first thing i think of is the classic kellogs corn flakes but after that shit like frosties or coco puffs etc. 
  that looks really painful, 
  if there was a way to possibly hate indians even more that smile would be it, 
  i 'm not epileptic and i think it looks cool . 
  i also think if you are epileptic this is probably not the best career choice . 
  not that i approve of ignoring her seizure . 
  no one who 's a fan of k-pop values `` heart '' in their performers .
