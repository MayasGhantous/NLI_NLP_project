  wait are you telling me that reddit 's sympathies are on hulk hogan 's side ? 
  who the fuck likes hulk hogan ? 
  now who the fuck does n't like spaghetti ? 
  `` stalking '' is n't a criminal offense . 
  there is no such thing as `` stalking charges '' . 
  that deadmau5 set was fucking sick . 
  i 've been somewhat enjoying ultra so far this year but this set was on a whole other level . 
  probably not a coincidence it was also the only set not to include 15 minutes of `` put your hands up you 're beautiful miami '' .

  that 's exactly why people downvote him, 
  why would deadmau5 , a progressive house artist , show armin who is a legend of trance what `` real trance is '' ? 
  asot has always had stuff other than vanilla trance . 
  lots of progressive house and some dnb etc. 
  playing on asot stage does n't mean only trance allowed . 
  just leaving this here in case anyone else noticed the girl with the california flag, 
  another similiar thing i feel is going through the settings . 
  ever since i was a kid whenever i get my hands on a new phone/tv/car / electronic device whatever the first thing i do is go through all the menus and settings to see what 's available . 
  and of course press all the buttons to see what they do . 
  for some people it 's just not something they do . 
  they simply turn the thing on , start using it and then they 're amazed 2 years later when they `` did n't even know it could do that '' . 
  well then you must be really fucking bad with a mouse . 
  does anyone have the full thing ? 
  i was able to find individual pieces like deadmau5 and pryda but i 'd like the whole thing as one . 
  it really depends on context . 
  sometimes it is exactly the same as `` truly '' or `` indeed '' . 
  sometimes not . 
  there is really no word in english that it directly translates to or that encompasses all the possible uses but i 'd say more often than not `` truly '' is the closest equivalent . 
  it 's typically used to add emphasis to a statement . 
  `` en usko h\u00e4nt\u00e4 '' = i do n't believe him, 
  but it can also be for almost the opposite , kinda `` soften the blow '' even, 
  i 'll buy it on pc once all the dlc and expansions and shit are out . 
  no point in buying games at launch these days when half the content is still missing . 
  especially since she has like 100 videos online where she fucks a real dick . 
  the only thing i can think off is they wanted a cumshot that is n't achievable with a real one . 
  but this video was shot after she already uploaded close to a hundred videos with a real one . 
  nah i 'm not exactly sure when this was but her latest videos are normal too . 
  she does a fair amount of `` custom '' videos so my guess is someone wanted a cumshot the guy could n't produce . 
  the guy who said that was n't pro-immigration or in charge of the decision of bringing them in . 
  did n't read a word, 
  you can see an alternate angle of where he 's standing in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjcxidhdtnk&amp;t=57s ) . 
  is n't r/toosoon supposed to be jokes that are made `` too soon '' ? 
  not just current events in image form . 
  well to be fair it is about as simple . 
  probably because most of us stopped looking at the keyboard at age 10 even without blanks . 
  how to spot someone who just turned fifteen, 
  you think in a site with millions and millions of users somebody will remember your `` persona or reputation '' unless you delete your post ? 
  i 've been posting actively for 5 years with 100k karma and thousands of posts . 
  what do you think about my reputation ? 
  exactly . 
   if you get in an argument with someone they will go through your comments, 
  no they do n't . 
  going to north korea when you were n't born there seems like a `` play stupid games win stupid prizes '' type of situation to me . 
  does anyone born in the west not know how nk is ? 
  should n't really come as a surprise at this point . 
  it does n't make any sense but 4k is a cool word to use in marketing and that 's what matters . 
  except an 8 year old pc runs games just as `` well '' as a 8 year old console . 
  there is no `` need '' to upgrade . 
  it 's just an option . 
  is the open beta on pc too ? 
  the description under the video says `` then play free during the open beta may 5-9 : xbox.com/overwatch '', 
  dota 2 does n't have `` heroes of opposing factions '' or faction loyalties or anything like that . 
  certain characters have personal quibbles that are reflected in the in-game voice lines but characters are n't associated with either `` side '' so it 's not the same . 
  wc3 dota did but ap was n't the default mode in wc3 dota . 
  and you just killed all excitement for the game i got from watching the video . 
  yeah but i do n't know if i want to play a game where my opponents have auto-aim . 
  i know . 
  that does n't mean it needs to be auto-aimed though does it ? 
  besides i watched a bunch of the character ability videos and it seems all of them have such huge amounts of spread on their weapons that accuracy hardly matters at all . 
  he 's not celebrating that exactly what he said would happen did happen and that it 's a vital part of the appeal of his campaign ? 
  he 's celebrating . 
  how does that make it not `` missing '' ? 
  i 'm not saying they 're witholding finished content like day 1 dlc , but games these days have planned out their dlc content long before launch and taken it into account in the entire development process . 
  they can even sell season passes because they know how much dlc they 'll make . 
  in other words the whole game is n't done yet when they decide to `` release '' it and the `` base game '' is just another name for an unfinished version lacking content that will be in the final version 6-12 months later . 
  how am i an idiot ? 
  this was a significant boost for his campaign . 
   no one is celebrating by any means right now, 
  a lot of people are . 
  have you even glimpsed at what / pol / has to say ? 
  it 's been a wild celebration all day . 
  eu immigration crisis wo n't solve itself and every terrorist attack by a muslim slowly but surely means more support for anti-immigration politicians across the entire continent . 
  it 's a big price to pay but nothing else works as effectively . 
  many trump voters feel the same . 
  of course it 's unfortunate what happened to those people but having live tv coverage of yet another terrorist attacks in a western country can do wonders for his campaign . 
  i think she looks in her early 20s, 
  not to mention someone who had to have serious open heart surgery despite dropping 50 pounds to avoid the procedure and who doctors told should stop weight lifting or he 's in serious danger of blowing his artificial heart valve which would mean certain death yet is still in amazing shape despite being almost 60 years old . 
  how 's that for some ableism . 
  e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yefrive_8ry&amp;t=5m25s, 
  no and no . 
  she posted the photo ( and the 2 others ) on her own account to a message board she 's been visiting for a long time and there is no hc . 
  probably because they did n't agree, 
  it does n't matter when it was taken or what was `` in '' . 
  all tattoos look like shit always . 
  also what 's wrong with ipad pros ? 
  i was recently thinking of getting a tablet and the ipad pro seemed like the best option . 
  it was so fucking expensive that i decided i 'd rather just live without one but that 's not the fault of the device . 
  and do n't give me any of that `` microsoft was first '' bullshit . 
  that 's just marketing .
