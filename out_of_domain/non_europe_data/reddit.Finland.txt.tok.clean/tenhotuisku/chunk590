   if those tits were fake you 'd see a scar under them . 
  there are still people who believe this ? 
  what does the censored version look like ? 
  is that part just cut out ? 
  name ? 
  yeah this is what i thought . 
  my browser , my phone , my computer all give the same `` this is an unknown 3rd party software '' pop up i have to approve when i install something not from the official store . 
  how is this anything to get riled up over ? 
  i 'd understand the reaction if it actually did n't allow you to play those games or something but it 's just checking a box that 's standard in everything these days . 
  except it does n't disallow anything . 
  it just makes you check a box that says allow games from outside the official store . 
  totally standard procedure these days . 
  did anyone even read the link ? 
  i recommend you read [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2cpyy7/why_was_wwi_considered_inevitable/cjiazrp ) whenever you have the time . 
  but your browser , operating system and phone probably do . 
  it 's not about the pose . 
  i do n't even play the game nor am i planning on ever playing it and even i 'm alarmed if blizzard , a company that makes other games as well , is willing to alter their game because literally one person on a message board got triggered by `` sexualized content '' . 
  itt manchildren, 
  is n't perfection by definition always `` at its finest '' ? 
  these are the options listed at https://auth.giantbomb.com/billing/ ( [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/djlfvev.png ) ) which is where the site takes you directly when you click `` upgrade me '' on a premium video . 
  but thanks . 
  also i do n't think that reddit deal is still active , at least http://reddit.com/gold/partners where it [ used to ] ( https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:91ba5evkioaj:https://www.reddit.com/gold/partners/+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fi ) be listed does n't exist anymore . 
  i remembered it and tried to look for it . 
  e. https://www.reddit.com/r/goldbenefits/comments/4a02z6/update_closing_the_gold_partners_program/, 
   calls other people bad with computers, 
   does n't know how to use adblock, 
   gets triggered by video sites that are n't youtube, 
  i 'm sure there 's been cumboxes even before the internet but i remember the classic one on 4chan from like 06-08ish long before i started using reddit . 
  that shit was crazy in high school too, 
  well it 's not like playing mm is n't also about practicing mechanics, 
  solo que is not supposed to be purely solo players and no one has ever implied it would, 
  parties and solos get queued together in ranked too, 
  nice work, 
  well it kinda is since you specified it being unranked which makes literally zero difference, 
  well the main reason for the over usage fee was a fucking 25mb gif in the year 2016 when a webm with the same content could 've probably fit under 1mb . 
  yeah but the guy he was responding to was n't talking about parties of 4 . that 's something he totally came up with himself . 
   queued solo and got matched with a party , sounds like a working system, 
  where in this do you see parties of 4 mentioned or anything that works differently in ranked or unranked ? 
  because i do n't . 
  why even bring up unranked or parties of 4 when neither of those things has anything to do with the comment he was replying to ? 
  reminder that / b / was always shit, 
  why is this a top of front page post ? 
  literally everything in this story was already in the articles about fbi managing to crack it like two days ago . 
  50k $ does not get you a luxury car in sweden . 
  you get like a nice mid range audi sedan with that . 
  yeah but dota has had those for many years yet still not a single one for csgo . 
  just because valve does something with dota does n't mean they do it with their other games . 
  no it wo n't . 
  here in finland a mercedes-benz e class for example starts at 49 416 $ . 
  that 's the bare minimum version with the smallest engine and no accessories whatsoever . 
  it 's not a bad car but it 's not `` luxury '' . 
  similiarly a volvo v70 with a petrol engine starts at 48 170 $ for the cheapest option, 
  that is not luxury . 
  a porsche is luxury . 
  the starting at model of a mercedes is a good reliable taking your kids to soccer practice car . 
  how is a six year old bmw 3 series a `` luxury car '' ? 
   strength and mass has improved at a quicker pace than ever before . 
  but i 'm also most active at night , smell horrible , destructive and never leave the house so they would n't have to be alone . 
  i do n't come to / r/dota2 for some amateur psychologist giving me a wall of text about how to handle emotions . 
  rtz flaming reddit is better content than that pretentious shit was or especially what this post is . 
  and on top of that 568 points is far from `` no attention '' . 
  i had upvoted it . 
  yeah back in '99 when me and basically everyone else in my 3rd grade class was playing counter-strike the community sure was mature . 
  you can always leave . 
  i love how this 2 hour old post has a bunch of 1 hour old comments about how people are n't subbed here anymore or how they do n't read this sub anymore . 
  i have n't seen this one but have n't people been doing stuff like lvl1 ng +7 for years ? 
  does n't that naturally become `` no hits '' just by everything in the game one shotting you ? 
  oh yeah you 're right so it 'd be like a no deaths ng +7 run, 
   did you hear the part in the video where bam said he wanted to commit suicide and had n't gone longer than a week without a drink for 10 years ? 
  that sounds like most people i know tbh and none of them seem `` too deep '' . 
  in fact they 're average 20 to 30 year olds . 
  i ca n't tell if this is shit posting or actually serious, 
  `` subdivision '' that makes up 80 % of the whole gated community, 
  i have been to disneyworld and it 's a fucking theme park . 
  it 's decent at what it is but it 's not like it 's something everyone should experience . 
  if you happen to be nearby with nothing to do i guess it 's an okay way to spend a day once in your life . 
  i have no clue why anyone would get an `` annual disney pass '' or get that enthusiastic and defensive over a damn theme park . 
  the way she 's talking about it makes it seem like it 's the same as never leaving the country you were born in or something . 
  having a drink once a week is very much the norm, 
  yeah but i do n't know why you 're saying people who have a drink every week are alcoholics when the vast majority of people especially his age do . 
  nice video . 
  i 'm just triggered that games i remember playing when they were brand new are now considered `` retro '' . 
  my experience with / r/worldnews is it 's one of the few subs left on reddit where people are n't afraid to say it like it is instead of politically correct trigger friendly happy thoughts . 
  this post reminded me that / r/lolgod used to exist, 
   he does n't browse reddit with night mode and styles off, 
  but if most people are 2-3k players would n't they be mostly interested in builds that work in 2-3k games and other 2-3k players ' experiences with said builds rather than shit that works in 5k ? 
  but the post this post is referencing to was also complaining about the top comment which was actually oc and a decent joke . 
  just because you do n't find something funny does n't make it `` twitch spam '' . 
  no i skip the ones with advice or any dota related content for that matter and just go for the ones where the poster has taken one introductory class in psychology and writes three pages about my emotions while playing . 
  this part, 
   it would be nice to see [ ... ] interesting content . 
  but i also acknowledge that it is easier , generally more popular and quicker to consume memes/stream highlights, 
  makes it sound like people are opting for `` easy '' over `` interesting '' when in fact people could just find that stuff more interesting . 
  i come here for patch notes , pro scene announcements and stream highlights . 
  i 'm not * interested * in some random nobody theorycrafting . 
  i was n't talking about myself and i do n't use that sub but exactly . 
  if most people are 2-3k then would n't they care most about what works in 2-3k ? 
  then why are you people reading / r/politics ? 
  the reason i made an account was to unsub from / r/politics ( and / r/atheism ) 5 years ago and i doubt it 's gotten any better . 
  instead of making elaborate screenshots you could just not go there .
