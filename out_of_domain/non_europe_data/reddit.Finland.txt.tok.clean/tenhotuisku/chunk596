  go look up job openings . 
  it 's a thing people openly do . 
  having one set of drivers that do n't work well under very specific rules is quite different from having an entire game ( or more accurately game ** s ** ) not work at all regardless of which drivers are used . 
   if you have at all been paying attention you 'd know about the huge issues nvidia has been having, 
  as a pc gamer with an nvidia card that 's exactly what i 've been doing . 
  paying attention as it would affect me directly . 
  so far there has n't been such news in the 18 months i 've owned this card . 
  meanwhile i do n't even have an amd gpu so i have no interest looking for the information yet i constantly hear about the issues ( some of which i specifically sourced above ) . 
  i did n't say this post is definitely a marketing ploy . 
  i said existence and possibility of viral marketing on reddit is not a conspiracy . 
  i think she has an issue with understanding clothing sizes in general . 
  no one said anything about who 's `` fault '' it is until that comment . 
  as a gamer and the end user it does n't really make any difference whose `` fault '' it is if one brand of cards can run a game and another ca n't , does it ? 
  i could n't stop thinking about [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x1viyze3ws ) as soon as the video started . 
  setting aside that it was one set of drivers you had to manually upgrade to and only under very specific conditions you can roll back to previous drivers in about 2 minutes if you have an issue with the new ones . 
  problem solved . 
  if amd cards have issues running a game ** regardless of drivers ** there 's nothing the user can do himself other than wait and hope a fix is made available some time in the future . 
  the two issues are nowhere near comparable . 
  but every single one of those news stories was about issues that ** are unique ** to amd . 
  that was the entire point . 
  of course there are bad pc ports and games that run badly on all machines but those are reported as such . 
  what reason would a gaming news site have to include `` with amd cards '' in the headline if it runs badly on all cards ? 
  you 're the ones who 's biased and in a fantasy world if you 're having this much trouble accepting it ** after i 've presented you with sources ** . 
  i 'm still waiting on the `` just as easy to find '' news stories about games that have issues specifically with nvidia cards you mentioned . 
  i 'd assume during the hour you 've spent shitposting you would 've been able to find one . 
  so all 4 different news sites i linked to every single one of them is biased ? 
  and google is biased for having those as first results ? 
  and reddit is biased for having them show up on the front page ? 
  basically the entire internet is biased except the one guy making claims without sources ? 
   already did find one btw . 
  you hand wave it away tho . 
  no you did n't . 
  you found one example of nvidia drivers being unstable that 's fixable by rolling back to previous version which is something nvidia offers on their own easy-to-use website . 
  that 's not the same as a game having issues with nvidia cards . 
  yeah and that layout is from the apartment, 
  how to spot someone who 's never lived in a city apartment . 
  you do n't need to have a twitch account to watch twitch, 
  true and these are n't official but they are probably pretty close to how the studio was set up . 
  obviously i understand why they would do that for the sake of filming the show as spaces often look smaller in tv than real life so a bigger room is required to match the `` feel '' of a normal apartment . 
  btw i edited my comment above if you want to see some high quality oc hot off the press, 
  true , but most of the shows in this post that take place in apartments are located in major cities . 
   by the pound/kilo kind of shop, 
  it looks more like a full animal of some sort so it 's probably just a really big and nice one that she switches to a crappier one, 
  what 's up with the letter x 's on that site ? 
  they look xtreme, 
  if this were a render he 's got some serious people in on the hoax like this museum that claims to have this exhibit for 3 months http://www.freiburg.de/pb/,lde/920469.html, 
  plenty of pictures here http://www.designboom.com/art/peter-zimmermann-school-of-freiburg-stadtische-museen-germany-04-20-2016/, 
  i see no way you 'll end up regretting this in a few years, 
  if having tattoos alone was n't enough of a warning sign of a retard degenerate it also looks like shit . 
  nice two in one package deal of `` rad '' . 
  you do know what curtains are , right ? 
  i do n't think jpeg would cause the whole thing to look wavy like that . 
  it 's definitely the work of someone who just discovered the clone tool . 
  this sub has never been exclusively for people who think fake tits ca n't look bad . 
  tons of good quality fake tits like ava addams or jayden james etc. 
  act almost exactly like the real deal . 
  fake tits is n't synonymous to these goofy balloon looking things . 
   why would the cia fund terrorists ? 
  to get even more funding themselves ? 
  to make personal profit by selling them the weapons they buy with the funding ? 
  not saying that 's what 's happening but that 's the theory . 
  i do n't want to disturb the circlejerk but are n't all those csgo gambling sponsor sites ones where you bet skins ? 
  the ones that technically are n't for adults only since they technically do n't involve gambling for real money ? 
  not that there is such a thing as an international law for what are `` adult themes '' . 
  drinking water in excess can kill you . 
  if you do n't like gambling do n't gamble . 
  sex in video games is not the argument though . 
  porn sites are 18 + . 
  the game is 18 + . 
  anyone playing or watching the game should be old enough to look at porn . 
  that 's the argument , not sex in videogames . 
  it 's got literally nothing to do with `` what 's wrong with porn '' or everyone doing it because the sole reason for this is sponsors not wanting their brand associated with an event that in their eyes includes mentions of porn . 
  samsung or whoever does n't want their logo on the stage next to the logo of youporn and money talks . 
  going as far as banning a team sponsored by youporn even without the term youporn on their gear is simply to avoid having to draw lines in the sand . 
  make the rule zero tolerance and let teams deal with it . 
  no , they do n't . 
  have you ever watched ( european ) football ? 
  both the arenas and the jerseys are full of ads by betting agencies . 
  betting is not something frowned upon or something companies would want to avoid being associated with . 
  the u.s. is an exception to the rule in the western world in how gambling is viewed and handled and the u.s. audience is n't a majority in the csgo scene . 
  why would you not keep money you found on the ground ? 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  burn it ? 
  is this like a reference or something ? 
  that is not at all the same logic . 
  you think steam is cheap ? 
  is this the year 2009 ? 
  almost all steam 's competitors are cheaper , even fucking gog that offers a superior product and allegedly a bigger cut to the devs . 
  i 've also had good experience with amazon so i 'm not talking shit about them but what exactly do people expect to happen in op 's case if they 're so surprised about this ? 
  literally any electronic 's store would do the same thing if they fucked up this badly . 
  i 've heard it feels a lot like wearing a racing helmet or ski goggles or something . 
  the fov even on ovulus/vive where it 's bigger than the psvr is n't big enough to fill your entire peripheral vision and you definitely do see the edges , but you very quickly get used to them and do n't think about it just like with goggles . 
  the resolution on that thing is absolute garbage . 
  the display in its entirety is 1080p and you 're breaking that into pieces and only showing the material ( that 's originally most likely 1080p ) on a fraction of it . 
  it 's a neat idea in theory but the technology is just not here yet ( at a decent price ) . 
   i wonder if maybe nintendo was never able to manufacture the system at a lower cost or something . 
  the ps2 , 360 and ps3 were sold at a deficit for years after launch and i would n't be surprised if ps4/xo were/are too . 
  that 's always been a part of the business model of consoles . 
  make them appear cheap so the `` price of admission '' is low and hopefully make the money back many times over by having the customers buy games and official accessories for the system . 
  with nintendo the cut they get from games should be even higher than usual since so many of their big hits were developed in-house .
