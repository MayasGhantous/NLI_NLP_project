  are these taboos ? 
  banned topics of conversation ? 
  because they 're not factually incorrect . 
   all nordic countries are expensive, 
  yeah and finland is one of the nordic countries . 
  therefore finland is expensive . 
  nordic countries make up 5 of the 196 countries in the world so not being the most expensive nordic country does n't exactly disprove her . 
   lipe\u00e4kala aka lutefisk is a typical norwegian dish, 
  it 's also a traditional finnish dish . 
  it 's been eaten here for centuries even if the dish does n't originate from the area of finland ( the dish is much older than the nation ) . 
  the article even goes out of its way to explain that it 's a traditional dish in nordic countries , not just finland . 
   same sun in the rest of the north . 
  again , an absurd point of reference . 
  helsinki is the 2nd northernmost capital in the world . 
  the latitude is obviously what causes the dark winters , of course it 's the same elsewhere as north . 
  the point is very few things are as far north . 
   people who `` live '' on the unemployment payments exist everywhere, 
  does that mean that she 's incorrect in that the unemployment rate is going up ? 
  because [ helsingin sanomat ] ( http://www.hs.fi/talous/a1435109369833 ) seems to think it 's at its highest in 15 years . 
  finland is a self proclaimed welfare state so she 's right about that too . 
   `` health has really gone downhill in recent years '' - based on what ? 
  she does particularily mention fast food and lean physique and according to the [ oecd ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/briefing-note-finland-2014.pdf ) the obesity rate has gone up by almost 50 % in the 21st century . 
   still better than the other nordic countries, 
  source ? 
  according to [ these ] ( http://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/incarceration_and_recidivism.pdf ) two [ statistics ] ( https://data.unodc.org/ ) finland has a smaller prison population ( adjusted for total population ) than norway , sweden or denmark despite having more violent crime and almost double the homicide rate of any of them . 
  if she calls herself expert on these countries , she makes herself look like a fool to single out finland for things that are exactly the same in the rest of the nordic countries that she seems to love . 
  no it does n't . 
  she does n't even say finland is more expensive than the other nordic countries . 
  she says finland is an expensive country . 
  that is true and relevant information to someone who 's planning on traveling to finland and as such a smart thing to point out as `` an expert '' . 
  same applies to all the other points . 
  the article is not `` finland compared to the rest of the nordic countries '' . 
   not her point . 
  so when she says, 
   unemployment is increasing, 
  her point is n't that the unemployment is increasing ? 
  that sounds like it makes a lot of sense . 
  she does go on to add, 
   they have seen that for them it pays to sit at home and do nothing, 
  but this is also a well documented phenomenon . 
  have a news article . 
  starting to believe it 's a real thing yet ? 
   does n't really say anything about the severity of punishment that she was complaining about . 
  yes it does . 
  if there are more reported incidents of violent crime yet fewer people incarcerated that means either people are n't sentenced to prison as much or that the sentences are much shorter . 
  with equal or longer punishments and a higher crime rate finland should have more inmates than the other nordic countries . 
  maybe if you had more friends you would n't have to make such sacrifices, 
  this is like next level beta, 
   no , her point is that finland 's unemployment situation is caused by finns being lazy, 
  no , her point is that finland 's unemployment situation is made even worse by a poorly managed welfare system which is obviously true given a. the example links i provided above and you dodged b. the fact that the nation 's entire welfare system is about to face a complete overhaul since the government agencies themselves agree it 's not working . 
   assuming each crime is committed by a different person . 
  assuming that on average in the scale of entire nations such miniscule differences even out . 
   no , but the category is scandinavia travel and is nordic exclusive . 
  does n't mean it 's only comparing nordic countries . 
  even the autoplay video embedded in the article compares countries to the u.s. 
  it 's an article ** about ** travel to nordic countries for people ** around the world ** considering travel options ** around the world ** . 
  even the opening sentence reads `` many wonderful places ** the world ** has to offer '' . 
  not the nordics . 
  the world . 
  the entire article is about finland as a country , not differences between finland and its neighbours . 
  nes , snes , ps1 and ps2 games were designed to run on sd monitors . 
  it 's an entirely different deal than downscaling ps4 content to a resolution lower than intended . 
  unless i 'm misunderstanding something the guy also sleeps in this room and is 30 + years old . 
  being able to have two computers in the same room you sleep in as a nearly middle aged male is not exactly huge sums of money especially when one has 3-4 year old hardware . 
  like he says himself in the album these are clearly builds that evolved one piece at a time not just someone who went out and bought 2 pc 's . 
  blockers totally fuck up your natural development and there is nothing `` normal '' about taking them . 
  a person taking blockers will ** not ** experience puberty `` regularly just fine '' . 
  they are taking medication altering their hormonal balance and natural growth . 
   i tell you from experience , it is not fun having to just let your default puberty change you all over your body in ways that you hate , without your permission or desire . 
  that 's life . 
  puberty sucks . 
  it 's embarassing . 
  it 's strange . 
  that 's a part of life . 
  humans are n't omnipotent creatures meant to never experience discomfort . 
  that ' t not a justification for taking medication with permanent life altering effects at a time when you 're not even considered old enough to buy an energy drink in some countries . 
  if you look at his youtube channel the room looked pretty much identical ( with older components in the computers naturally ) 6 years ago . 
  i 'm very much doubting that 's a guest bed . 
   blockers put you in a form of stasis . 
  they do n't alter your natural growth, 
  `` a form of stasis '' is not natural . 
  therefore they ** do ** alter your natural growth . 
  your entire post is just a bunch of nonsense written by someone who almost religiously wants to believe something that simply is n't so so i 'm not even going to bother going through all the other ridiculous notions you made . 
  i hope some day you get the medical and psychological help you need for your disorder . 
  emhpasis on the word few https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_suomen_ruotsin-_ja_kaksikielisist%c3%a4_kunnista#/media/file:languages_of_finnish_municipalities_ ( 2009 ) . svg, 
  that 's a compromise because modern medical technology simply has n't come up with a better solution yet . 
  it 's the same as telling people with multiple personality disorder that they really are multiple people and they should embrace their split personality instead of conforming to traditional roles in society such as being a single person like their physical body would hint them to be . 
  except that would be consider abuse of the mentally ill since people suffering from mpd/did do n't have the gay/lesbian train to piggyback which automatically makes anything related to sexuality sacred and untouchable . 
  there does n't exist an effective cure for dissociative identity disorder yet either , but that does n't mean we just quit trying . 
  that is not a cure . 
  also just because homosexuality was called a mental illness once upon a time does n't mean everything else that used to be considered one is n't . 
  schizophrenia was considered a mental illness 50 years ago back when homosexuality was too . 
  is it not one now ? 
   also being transgender is not an issue or disorder according to the medical community . 
  then what is gender dysphoria also known as gender identity ** disorder ** ? 
  it was still the medically correct term 3 years ago . 
  which one do you really think has seen more significant developments in those 3 years , the actual medical science or the political pressure to avoid controversy over a name activists were n't happy with ? 
  you can call it whatever you wish , the name you give it does n't affect the mental illness itself in the slightest . 
  because a guy who has enough expendable income to have an entire room dedicated to pc 's would unlikely have to also use it as a bedroom , unless it is literally the only room he has available such as in the scenario of living in his parents ' basement . 
  if it was a studio apartment he 'd probably at least have a fridge and a sink etc.
