  team damage and self damage are treated seperately in all instances . 
  self damage is the same as enemy damage , 100 % while team damage is closer to 50 % . 
   i 'd look away too in his situation . 
  anyone would . 
  no i would n't . 
  i would n't look away before i 've started defusing even if it was a shitty mm game not to mention a serious lan event . 
  have you actually tried using a 970 ? 
  there 's nothing `` wrong '' when a card that 's not even top of the line struggles to max out modern games from a time after the card 's release . 
  that 's how it 's always been . 
  yeah at that point i was already sold on never going there . 
   the 970 is more than capable at running any recent game at 60fps @ 1080p with zero problems, 
  not if you max out everything . 
  drop a few things from ultra to very high and go from 16x filtering to 4x and then maybe . 
  60fps meaning `` never dropping below 60 '' . 
   you literally have the gtx 980 , gtx 980 ti , titan x and the amd r9 390x , the 970 is literally one step below 600 + dollar cards, 
  it 's a pretty big step . 
  besides there 's nothing new about games being designed so that systems at the time of release ca n't even full out max the graphical settings . 
   no s. 
   how is a child supposed to learn how to interact with animals if she 's never allowed to ? 
  is interacting with animals a fundamental skill people need to learn at that age ? 
  multiple monitos has been pretty standard at least since tft monitors became a thing, 
  it 's almost like there are people who do n't closely follow rumors of upcoming computer hardware announcements . 
   i would have surely thought it would have been close to 1k . 
  it 's their new main product line . 
  something like titan x or 980ti are only manufactured in small batches and marketed to a very specific audience who are ready to pay that huge sum for a relatively small upgrade just to have `` the best '' . 
  a new product line using a new arcitechture is totally different from those cards that were trying to squeeze out as much power as possible from older techologies . 
  just because they 're faster does n't mean they 're more expensive to manufacture . 
  why would waiting for amd 's answer make me less hyped ? 
  arma 3 , shadow of mordor , star citizen , just cause 3 for example ca n't sustain a solid 60 + fps with everything fully maxed out on a 970 . 
  and these are just games i 've played myself . 
  why would the possibility of amd announcing an even better product make me ** less ** hyped ? 
   we 're merely at a lucky time in history, 
   at the moment some women are able to give birth naturally , while others need c-sections because the baby 's head is too large . 
  and if we did n't have the technology to do c-sections and those babies with large heads would n't survive their birth or did n't have a mother to look after them due to dying in labor then the people carrying the overly large headed gene would be serverely handicapped and less likely to reproduce . 
  evolution . 
  they also have a history of selling superior products that do n't crap out every time a new game gets released . 
  but they had money and it 's the same money that can be used to buy yatchs . 
  8 million is not that much . 
  i got like 1.5 m in the first 2 weeks after release and this was the initial console release way back before there were tons of easier ways to grind . 
   the highest potential payout is 1.25 mil split four ways . 
  equally distributed that 's only like $ 300k . 
  so you 're complaining that the absolute highest tier item . 
  the single most expensive item in the game requires you to play a mission 27 times ? 
  that does n't sound like an insane amount of grind especially when the multiplayer missions in gta5 are actually fun to play , they 're not something like an mmo grind of killing mobs with one hit . 
  and again it 's the most expensive item that does n't even offer any gameplay advantage and is just for showing off . 
  if everyone just got it in a day then what 's the point ? 
   now go ahead and get five different properties , 50 cars of your choice , full mods for all of those cars , full mods for whatever insanely expensive lowriders you have , and any pegasus or warstock vehicles you want . 
  yeah , i think it is definitely doable . 
  you 're literally complaining that a game has a lot of achieve for those who 've chosen to play it for a long time so they do n't run out of stuff to attain . 
  you 're making it out like that 's a bad thing because you have this weird idea that a game needs to be easily and quickly completed . 
  that 's where the hackers are . 
  on consoles it 's abandoned . 
  i do n't think it will actually have a separate case or anything . 
  that 's just for marketing . 
  either two discs or it 's a download . 
  i had black ops 2 and the mp was pretty terrible in that one . 
   reddit are just fucking hipsters who hate anything popular . 
  he says in a thread full of people excited for the new battlefield game . 
   almost, 
  while it probably wo n't change that fact it 's important to remember those `` official '' statistics are always physical sales . 
  witcher 3 was n't even in the top 10 because nobody buys physical games for pc anymore . 
  they 're both video games . 
  they 're products used to amuse yourself and spend some time . 
  if you 're in a situation where you have the possibility to spend some time playing cod then you automatically have the possibility to spend that time playing bf . 
  of course there is a comparison . 
  games do n't need to be identical for there to be a comparison . 
  i 'm upset that it looks exactly like the last 4 cod games . 
  were n't they all near future shooters as well ? 
  you have 3 separate studios making the games , why not have some variety ? 
  as opposed to all the game franchises not marketed towards kids and teenagers . 
  did you even play cod 2 ? 
  bo2 was a shitfest of op killstreaks and way too simple maps . 
  that 1.5 m was made purely legit , this was before the custom mission creator was even released . 
  these days i 'm sure it 's only gotten easier . 
  the game has been out for 2.5 years . 
  how do you expect them to keep it interesting for players if everything is easy to get ? 
  i simply do n't understand your view how having cool shit that takes a long time to get is a bad thing . 
  if we were talking about the price of a regular sports car or something you need for basic gameplay i 'd understand but these are vanity items that only serve as money sinks and a way to show others how invested in the game you are . 
  it did n't seem that obvious to you . 
  it 's 1/6th of the way there and only in 2 weeks of casual play without the goal of grinding cash as quickly as possible . 
   ill literally go take a screenshot of the game on my 780 maxed 1080p @ 60 perfectly smooth, 
  please do . 
  here 's what i got from the benchmark with everything on ultra http://i.imgur.com/q3pfqy5.jpg, 
  i would n't throw around statements like `` out of any cods '' if i did n't play the best cods . 
  that 's really fucking cool but that water looks nasty, 
   something is wrong with your setup . 
  my benchmark scores are exactly what they should be and this is a fresh install with barely any software . 
  also my performance is perfectly in line with what others with a 970 have reported if not better . 
  i think you 're just a little delusional thinking any high end card from 2 years ago should be able to max out modern games . 
  e. i was running the game at 1920x1200 though , forgot to mention . 
  well for starters min fps of 51 or 54 is not `` buttery smooth that never drops below 60 '', 
  it is an opinion but the vast majority considers either 1,2 or 4 to be the best ones . 
  3 was garbage . 
  bf is the second or third biggest fps franchise in sales . 
  it 's about as hipster as taylor swift or mcdonald 's . 
  insurgency or arma could be considered hipster fps games if you absolutely must use that term . 
  the same way any premature celebration is cocky . 
  except i explicitly mentioned ** even in mm ** making it clear for everyone ( expect you apparently ) that they are not the same thing . 
  and since when has it been acceptable to put even less effort into a lan event than some absolutely meaningless mm game ? 
  he even waited for the guy to turn his head .
