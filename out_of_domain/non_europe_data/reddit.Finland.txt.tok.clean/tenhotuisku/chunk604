  deserved or not that 's 100 % a sucker punch . 
  who cares what the fans do ? 
  they 're not the ones still alive in the game with a task to accomplish . 
  who is this ? 
  who is this ? 
  yes ? 
  you have a task to perform that requires looking at the screen and you look away before you 're finished to celebrate with your teammates . 
  how is that not premature celebration ? 
  they remade day of the jackal ? 
  exactly . 
  for the most expensive vanity item in the game . 
  that is far from unreasonable . 
  that does n't mean it 's a good idea . 
   i ca n't imagine there are a large number of people who would drop large amounts of money on a graphics card without research . 
  l o l, 
  also a 970 is n't that expensive and something like going to google and searching for `` good value for price video card '' and clicking on the first link or two counts as research . 
  you do n't have to search through every pc hardware discussion site trying to find rumors about upcoming announcements that ** have n't been made yet ** before you 're allowed to purchase components . 
  yes . 
  yes they do if they were old enough to play them which i understand is a rarity in the modern cod crowd . 
  yeah good point seeing as how looking at the screen is the sole defining factor in counter-strike proficiency . 
  so you really do n't understand what premature celebration means ? 
  no one has ever in the history of anything commented on the premature celebration of fans . 
  who the fuck cares ? 
  they 're fans . 
  their celebration has no effect on the game . 
   i love all dota heroes , and i think it 's really unfair to keep techies super dumpster tier simply because people dislike him . 
  but all people do n't agree . 
  just because dota is a great game with a wide variety of heroes does n't mean they 're all equal or equally well designed . 
  the problem with techies was never that he was so good you could n't win against it . 
  it was that he was played in a unique style most people did n't like playing with or against . 
  he made games less fun regardless of winning or losing or which team he was on . 
  much of his impact was reliant on either luck or gimmicks and in a pub environment rarely contributed anything to teamwork . 
  if you ask me there should n't be any shame in icefrog/valve admitting it was a mistake and removing the hero . 
  just because something was once introduced to dota does n't mean it has to stay there forever and even good game devs make mistakes , that 's why we have patches . 
  he 's not surprised . 
  he just knows how to play around iihf refs . 
  it 's not just class , holzer was smart enough to recognize he 's in the wc and throwing a punch there would 've hurt his team badly . 
   this is based purely on fantasy and that i want a second coming of teemu . 
  we all do, 
  yeah but `` recency bias '' is a pretty questionable word to throw around when we 're talking about 17-18 year old kids . 
  a year makes a ** huge ** difference in these players . 
  matthews was the undoubtable 1st pick a year ago but he has n't really achieved much this year . 
  decent regular season but getting swept 4-0 in the first round of playoffs while laine won the championship for his team and was chosen ( faily ) the mvp of the playoffs . 
  winning the wjc as a dominant scorer while matthews failed to show up in the games that counted the most . 
  laine is a much better player than he was a year ago and there is no recency bias in that statement . 
  i think because matthews was so dominant at age ~ 16 a lot of people just accepted the fact that he 's going to be 1st pick and the best of his year and anything after that is just a minor coincidence and bad luck when the fact is things change a lot in a year at that age . 
  take off the toronto goggles . 
   the recency bias people are talking about is not a year . 
  it 's the last two months where laine was ripping the playoffs up and matthews was in arizona watching from his bedroom . 
  those two months happen to be the months when the results for a season 's worth of work come in . 
  you do n't win a league title by playing bad for all but the last few weeks . 
  and their wjc performances are still very much relevant in the discussion . 
   til 2nd in ppg in a men 's league is a decent regular season . 
  that is an extremely cherry picked statistic and guess what ? 
  laine was the 3rd in ppg in a men 's league this regular season . 
  and 1st in ppg in the playoffs in a men 's league . 
  no one said matthew 's had a bad season . 
  but he was n't the driving force of his team in the same way laine proved to be . 
  in a men 's league . 
   3 assists in a 0-4 sweep . 
  not to mention it 's a team game . 
  that 's like blaming karlsson for the sens not winning the cup , hilarious . 
  3 assits is not bad by any means . 
  but it 's not 10 goals and 5 assists in 18 playoff games many of which were game winning goals . 
  no one blamed the sweep on matthews alone , but that does n't mean it did n't happen . 
  he only played one round in the playoffs . 
  everyone who follows hockey knows that playoff hockey is where the game really gets going and matthews did n't get much positive playoff experience . 
   matthews did n't achieve much this year !, 
  well he did n't ? 
  what makes you say otherwise ? 
  he did n't win the wjc like laine . 
  he did n't win the national title like laine . 
  that 's what achieving things means . 
  matthews played good hockey , but he did n't achieve much . 
   the fact that matthews is still far and away the consensus number one , despite laine having a sick playoffs while matthews was at home , just speaks volumes to how highly regarded matthews is . 
  it speaks volumes to how biased nhl scouts are towards na players because of the audience and jersey sales they bring . 
   one sick playoffs does n't make or break a player . 
  again , i 'm not calling matthews a bad player by any means . 
  i 'm saying he 's in the top 2 of his year 's draft which is huge in itself . 
  but you ca n't just brush away the most recent year as `` recency bias '' . 
  these players are barely 18 . 
  recent events are biased for a reason . 
  no one cares who was the better player a year ago and neither player had this amount of responsibility or possibilities to showcase their skills a year ago . 
  recent events are held in greater importance because they most accurately portray the player 's skill at the time of the draft . 
  not just because people forget stuff quickly . 
  kids this age are still constantly improving . 
   and team success does n't make a player somehow better . 
  except it does . 
  after the success at wjc laine 's play at his club improved dramatically overnight . 
  confidence does wonders especially at that age . 
  that case . 
  those figurines . 
  the mouse . 
  this is some premium cringe material . 
  i hope you hide that thing under a blanket when you have people coming over . 
  by having drawers full of shit . 
   you could be the best player in the world but be on the worst team , does n't make you not the best player in the world . 
  hockey is a team sport , you do n't win because you have one good player . 
  except that 's not how it works in the real world . 
  finnish league or the swiss league do n't have drafts so you do n't get stuck with the worst team as the best player .
