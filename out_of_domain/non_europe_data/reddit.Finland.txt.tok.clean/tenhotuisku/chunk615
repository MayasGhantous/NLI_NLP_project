  i stubled upon a new subreddit today called r/racism that promotes itself as a place for anti-racism discussion . 
  i found it kind of strange that the sidebar mentions r/feminism , r/feminisms , r/radicalfeminism , r/twoxchromosomes and r/women but no r/mensrights or any other men 's subreddits . 
  i posted [ about this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/i3kth/why_does_rracism_mention_feminism_feminisms/ ) on r/racism but could n't really get any intelligent conversation going on . 
  was hoping my r/mensrights brothers would understand the irony of the situation and/or contribute to the discussion somehow . 
  inb4 not your personal army , but thanks anyway, 
  ** e. ** apparently a moderator removed my post ( go free speech ) . 
  for those reading this just now i was in no way offensive or even attacking , just genuinely curious . 
  i do n't know if this is totally normal , something i ate or a medical condition but every now and then my armpits smell exactly like the chalkboard eraser sponges at school . 
  it 's a dirty and disgusting smell . 
  this happens a few times per year on average so it 's not my usual body odor . 
  as long as it does n't hurt me/others of course . 
  reading reddit 's reactions to that girl ( [ you know which one i 'm talking about ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x3kar.png ) ) got me thinking . 
  for example homework . 
  if someone asks to see the problems i solved last night of course i 'll show them . 
  i wo n't gain anything by being a dick . 
  i wo n't get those hours back anyhow either so why would i want to make someone else suffer ? 
  inb4 `` but they wo n't learn '' . 
  well that 's not really my call to make . 
  if someone wants to just copy my answers they 've obviously made their choice and who am i to question it . 
  anyway i doubt he 'd start regretting his ways and make a change in life like in pg13 tv movies . 
  oh and `` it 's not fair '' well life 's not fair . 
  besides i 'm the only `` victim '' here and i do n't even feel like i 'm being victimized so why do some people get it in their head that it 's their place to start tattling . 
  ** tl ; dr ** stop being an asshole , one day someone might return the favor, 
  for over a month now i 've greatly enjoyed ** [ r/stonerengineering ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/stonerengineering/ ) ** . 
  it 's a subreddit for your home made pipes , bongs , bowls , vaporizers , bubblers ... pretty much anything you can smoke out of . 
  there are plenty of pictures , blueprints , experiences , info , tips etc. 
  r/trees is now over 100,000 ents strong . 
  i know more than 779 of us must have built or tried to build your own smoking apparatuses , or would at least be interested in the subject . 
  so please join us at [ r/stonerengineering ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/stonerengineering/ ) , there 's already tons of quality content but more could n't hurt . 
  i 'm not even a mod or anything so this is n't self-promotion . 
  i just love the idea and atmosphere of this subreddit . 
  first of all i 'm not hating on vaporizers or bashing them but genuinely interested . 
  on r/trees there seems to be unconditional love for vaporizers . 
  however a lot of my irl friends never `` waste their weed '' on vaporizing anymore after trying it a few times . 
  personally i 've tried the volcano a couple of times , 2-3 of those pocket sized ones and vaporstar . 
  if i was drunk i could feel a slight sensation of highness but sober i just kept waiting for the high that never came . 
  everytime i 've tried the vaporizer has been operated by an owner who actively uses his so i assume i did n't do it wrong . 
  i have to say i 'm leaning towards never vaping again either . 
  anyone else having similiar experiences ? 
  please do n't downvote if you love vaping , i 'd rather see you comment and share your views . 
  thanks . 
  i tried going through all [ these ] ( http://disneycomics.free.fr/index_barks_date.php ) ( titles mostly ) but could n't find it . 
  donald duck gets fed up with his neighbor and moves to a new house that has the `` quietest neighbors ever '' . 
  however he hears someone walking `` loudly '' during the night and starts retaliating , leading to a full out war with fire sirens and drum kits etc and eventually ending with a 10-foot warhorn from upstairs . 
  thank you . 
  i got an email today telling me to verify my beta membership or something . 
  i did it and got another message 10 minutes later giving me access to cod elite beta . 
  everything was fine , i looked through my stats and competitions etc. 
  that was a few hours ago and i closed my browser since then . 
  now when i try to access it just gives me the `` join the beta . 
  invitations are being sent . 
  we will let you know '' bullshit page everybody gets even though i 'm logged in in the upper right corner . 
  anyone else experiencing this ? 
  what to do ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure how to join a team so here we go but i did read all the rules etc. 
  so there should n't be any problems . 
  i 'd like to join a team . 
  any team . 
  i 'd be fine with being a substitute/alternative ( at least at first  ) and i understand if you require a try-out . 
  k/d is only 1.14 but i 've played cod since the first one and i think i 'm pretty good ( lots of drunk split-screen if that explains some ), 
  i 'm available pretty much always . 
  the title pretty much sums it up . 
  can you recommend a headset for the 360 ? 
  wired or wireless . 
  price range is up to $ 150 - $ 200 but i do n't mind spending a lot less . 
  mostly for fps use ( footsteps etc. ), 
  i noticed they 've added new playlists `` dlc moshpit '' and `` dlc hardcore '' sometime during the last 10 hours . 
  this is great for people like me who 've been whishing for this since the 2nd map pack came out . 
  besides i love moshpit and hate how there 's no regular moshpit anymore . 
  cancelling all my plans . 
  e. also i noticed under core there is an `` express '' . 
  `` 30 second lobby times . 
  fast paced game modes . 
  no second chance or ghost '' . 
  just out of curiosity , how popular is the auto-aim ? 
  i 've never used it but i tried it for a few rounds and it also appears to be a nice wallhack ( sometimes locking into enemies behind light cover ) . 
  why do they implement shit like this to multiplayer ? 
  i know all console cod 's have had one but ca n't they just accept that people know how to play on a pad nowadays ? 
  i 've had this problem since i got my new mac ( january ) . 
  the cmd + / - zoom does absolutely nothing . 
  not even when i select it from the view menu . 
  i had no such problem with my old mac . 
  google did n't offer any help . 
  is it just me or has anyone else experienced this ? 
  also , what files and where do i have to delete to have a complete reinstall of firefox ? 
  ( i 'm posting this to r/firefox as well ), 
  i just reinstalled rtw on windows 7 and have terrible mouse lag . 
  i exceed the recommended specs by about 10x and the game runs smoothly so it 's not that . 
  also the sensitivity is way too low and i ca n't find how to change it ( windows mouse settings did n't affect it ) . 
  i googled around and got many results of people complaining about mouse lag but no advice whatsoever except for `` need more mhz '' but most of those posts were over 5 years old and it really is n't the issue here as the game runs perfectly otherwise . 
  anyone else have any experience with this ? 
  a working fix ? 
  when i spill my drink on my clothes it often times dries from the center first leaving a circular stain along the edges . 
  plain common sense would say the center where the drop was spilled should be wetter than the surroundings where the liquid spread , however that 's not how stains tend to dry . 
  why is this ? 
  so , i 'm getting the numark mixtrack pro any day now . 
  i 'm a complete newbie and just trying out which is why i 'm going with a cheap controller ( if you know a better one for the price do tell , the sale is not final yet ) . 
  anyway that 's not my question , i read the sidebar and while it offered good advice otherwise there was no discussion about the best software for a beginner . 
  my friend uses virtual dj pro 7 with his numark and is apparently happy with it . 
  that 's what i 'm going with unless the internet points me elsewhere .
