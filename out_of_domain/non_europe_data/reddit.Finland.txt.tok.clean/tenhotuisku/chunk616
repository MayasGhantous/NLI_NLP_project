  i 'm mostly interested in trance , dance , house , vocal trance and progressive but also 90 's hip-hop , g-funk etc in case that matters in this decision . 
  at this point i 'm just looking to mix , scratch , screw , chop ... point is i 'm not looking to make my own music . 
  price is not an issue so please do n't even consider it . 
  i do use a mac however . 
  thanks in advance, 
  during night i use the night mode on reddit and browse mainly other dark pages so getting a screenfull of bright white light is n't exactly the nicest feeling on the eyes . 
  is it possible to adjust firefox so that new empty tabs would be dark grey for example ? 
  i 'm running os x if that matters . 
  i do n't know if it had something to do with the update , but my pro club is gone . 
  when i go to pro clubs i get the welcome screen . 
  it ca n't be found in the search either , none of the players can see it . 
  has the same happened to anyone else ? 
  so , my problem is the following : i have about 20 empty grand and greater soul gems . 
  i used to hunt mammoths and giants a lot but i have n't seen any in a looong time so i 'm guessing they 're becoming extinct due to my hunting . 
  i always try to soul trap enemies during quests but few have souls bigger than common . 
  what 's the best way to get large souls besides mammoths ? 
  lvl42 if that matters . 
  i noticed the search could n't find anything about this game on this subreddit . 
  developer monolith productions, 
  publisher warner bros. . interactive entertainment, 
  platforms games for windows , playstation network , xbox live arcade, 
  release date february 7 , 2012, 
  genre first-person shooter, 
  mode ( s ) multiplayer, 
  [ trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtbgzybslgg ), 
  [ gameplay ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2pxt_os1s ), 
  it 's pretty great and the free trial version is the full game for 60 minutes not including menus . 
  3 game modes : tdm , fumigation ( basically domination or conquest ) and psychological warfare which is like sabotage from cod , one bomb ( battery ) in the middle . 
  character customization is nice and actually affects gameplay . 
  the bigger you are the more health you have but you 're also slower and a bigger target . 
  i recommend you try it . 
  well worth the 1200 points . 
  the nhl.com match previews are nice when betting on games but i 'd like to see a listing of all the games ( or even last 10 or 20 ) for any team . 
  i ca n't seem to find one like this anywhere on the site . 
  i can list all the scores of every game but it can get tedious when trying to check on a dozen of teams . 
  the schedule only shows upcoming games . 
  is there a way on nhl.com or any other site to view a single team 's results so far in the season ? 
  so the title pretty much says it all . 
  honestly i have no problem with the timezones since i 'm pretty much nocturnal but the lag can be an issue . 
  i 'm talking about the small laugh at the end . 
  like laughing , but only letting out one `` hah '' and maybe a small smile . 
  when something is slightly amusing . 
  the gif might be slightly sarcastic and not exactly what i 'm looking for but it 's the best i could find . 
  we have a word for it . 
  however wiktionary ( and traditional dictionaries ) translate it to `` sneer '' which according to themselves is a negative response where as hym\u00e4hdys is a positive one . 
  1 . sneer, 
  sneer, 
  a facial expression where one slightly raises one corner of the upper lip , generally indicating scorn . 
  a display of contempt ; scorn, 
  verb, 
  to feel or display contempt or disdain for something or somebody ; to despise . 
  to scoff , express contempt, 
  to reject , turn down, 
  if you have n't tried it it 's tons of fun . 
  i use pistols a lot in core mp as well as in the campaign but in hc you can seriously dominate using only a pistol . 
  most kill with 2 shots , mp-412 , magnum and deagle kill with one shot . 
  they have extremely quick ads even without quickdraw and are fairly accurate . 
  i was playing hc domination yesterday and kept getting ac-130s with five-seven and scavenger . 
  mp-412 is great as well since it kicks less than the magnum and deagle while still maintaining one shot kills . 
  if any ( preferably european because lag ) enjoy hc with pistols or just like pistols and would like to try it feel free to add me . 
  gamings always more fun together . 
  i do n't know if this is good or bad in your book but you can seriously piss some people off . 
  i do n't know what it is but people simply do n't like getting killed by a pistol :d, 
  so ... there 's a huge glitch with the final stand which is especially useful in hc as it can effectively double the damage a person can take . 
  i do n't know if this applies to core as well because it 's not as noticeable but enemies ** do not take damage when falling to final stand ** . 
  yesterday i was playing with a p90 that should kill with two shots on close range . 
  i got ** four ** ( 4 ) hit markers ( confirmed in theatre ) , two of them to put him down and two more while he was falling , and after that the enemy still shot me from final stand and survived . 
  how is it possible they let such a huge bug into the final game , this issue was fixed in black ops at least . 
  anyone else experienced similiar occurances ? 
  i know these were announced a while back but now it 's may and they 're expected to start appearing in stores ( for $ 54.99 ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://bulk2.destructoid.com/ul/224974-xbox%20chrome%20controllers%20header.jpg ) a pic in case you had n't seen them . 
  i just pre-ordered the [ blue ] ( http://images.eurogamer.net/2012/articles//a/1/4/7/2/0/8/6/6892906812_f535b08f86_o.jpg.jpg/eg11/resize/600x-1 ) one for 43 $ . 
  needed a new controller anyway and it was as expensive as a regular `` new school '' controller with the hard sticks and improved d-pad . 
  anyone else planning to get these ? 
  i think they look sweet . 
  i kept getting an error message reading `` this file is damaged or incomplete '' and there was no real advice on google so i 'm posting this for anyone in the future experiencing the same . 
  after redownloading the file about 4 times i figured out what was the problem . 
  you have to ** move the downloader file to / applications ** before starting it up . 
  even though it seems to work just fine in the / downloads and asks you were you want to download the files it somehow corrupts them . 
  so make sure everything happens within the / applications folder . 
  i understand blizzard wants to discourage death zerging with the increased repair costs , which is good , but if they 'll go ahead with it they should also make items more durable when you do n't die . 
  i just played act1 quests 7 til butcher . 
  i did n't die a single time yet still all my items were close to being destroyed . 
  i did n't mind paying a little over 5k to get them fixed , but 30k out of the ~ 200k i earned would had been a lot of money for `` nothing '' . 
  it 's basically just a tax for playing , you ca n't avoid durability loss with a melee character . 
  opinions ? 
  the national rosters are in serious need of an update . 
  i 'm mainly going to talk about team finland because i 'm most familiar with their roster but i 'm sure the situation is no different for other teams . 
  i know finland is not a huge country but the team has won a medal 4 out of last 5 olympics and the world championship in 2011 and it 's ranked 2nd in the world by [ iihf ] ( http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking/mens-world-ranking/2012-ranking.html ) for it 's steady performance so i 'd consider it a pretty relevant team in international hockey . 
  not to mention a big market for the nhl game . 
  the team has n't changed at all in years . 
  there has been ** one change ** to the roster since nhl ** 09 ** . 
  jere lehtinen retired in 2010 and was removed in a roster update of nhl 11 . 
  mikael granlund is probably the most noticable player missing . 
  he scored 9 points in wc 2011 including the [ iconic goal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jazghydwp-s ) against russia in the semi-finals and was a huge factor in winning the championship . 
  he also participated in wc 2012 and even most of the less important national team tournaments during the season . 
  yet he 's still missing from the team , even with the newest online roster update . 
  do you think ea should pay better attention to their national team rosters ? 
  after all they 're probably the most used teams after nhl . 
  this is my personal opinion and should n't be considered as facts even though they 're based on facts .
