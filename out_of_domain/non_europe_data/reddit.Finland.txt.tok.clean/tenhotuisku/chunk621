  do you people normally backspace every other word or why is there so many errors everywhere ? 
  it 's not like i 'm doing anything different from usual and i 'm yet to backspace once, 
  really i got my message across a long time ago but i 'm just typing more so i could typo to prove that im not backspacing, 
  its not working fuck, 
  yesterday i played for about 2-3 hours . 
  i got over ** 50 ** succesful invades in a row , not a single `` failed to invade '' and almost every time ( all except ~ 2 ) it was faster than the `` searching for a world '' message flashing three times . 
  it was absolutely amazing . 
  i do n't know if they adjusted the matchmaking or if there 's just more players than before and the servers have been fixed after gwg but i 'm loving it . 
  this is the un-edited version : http://gifwall.net/gif/gw-niiloperkeleaerrahaa.gif,

  i have no clue how i would go about looping this perfectly but i could n't help notice the potential . 
  that `` bear '' on the bottom looks exactly like a drawn dog character from somewhere . 
  i remember the caramel/beige coloured fur and i think it had a blue collar but i 'm not sure . 
  it might be a comic strip or a kids cartoon or even just a single drawing on the internet but it feels extremely familiar to me . 
  that pose with its head down in particular . 
  so i got into the prison past the turrets with speech skill . 
  once inside the prison things got pretty heated and i had to kill everyone . 
  now i ca n't exit the prison because the turrets one shot me . 
  how do i disable them/exit the prison ? 
  ca n't find a back door out . 
  i have n't played since the summer of 2012 . 
  i was disappointed , but now with the expansion and loot 2.0 i 'm thinking of giving the game another shot since it seems more like what i was expecting originally . 
  problem is , i have n't followed the development at all . 
  is there a site or something that would list all the additions post-launch ? 
  the ros main features are easier as you can find them even on wikipedia . 
  the problem i have are features between launch and the release of ros . 
  paragon levels and monster powers for example . 
  everything that was n't in the game during the first few weeks . 
  so anyone who 's used the vaccuum rune knows the enemies wo n't be sucked in constantly but in `` pulses '' of about a second . 
  with the fryderh 's wrath ( condemn no longer has a cooldown but costs 40 mana ) item you can have multiple condemn 's active at one time as the `` cooldown '' for the skill is about a second while the effect lasts for 3 seconds . 
  what i 'm wondering is : does having multiple condemn 's active have a effect on the vaccuum ? 
  does it `` pulse '' for both of the condemn 's or just one ? 
  has anyone done the math ? 
  i 've been using this build for a few days and ca n't be certain . 
  this wo n't affect my decision on using any of the items , i 'm just curious if anyone decided to investigate it . 
  i enjoy leveling up `` legitimately '' without having someone lvl70 boost me in an hour , for me lvling up is part of the experience . 
  would anyone be interested in leveling up with me ? 
  d3 is so boring alone and most of my friends play softcore . 
  i 'm planning on starting from lvl1 as soon as i find someone to play with but i do n't mind if you have a small head start . 
  i do n't use res 's own filter , i use the gold feature `` filtered r/all '' . 
  the link is n't in the form of reddit.com/r/*** but http://www.reddit.com/me/f/all, 
  is there a way to get this link up top in the subreddit bar with the other links ? 
  some players just wo n't show up on my bench . 
  i can switch them to the starting 11 but i can never use them for substitutes . 
  it 's always the same players , for example b\u0142aszczykowski of bor . 
  dortmund will never show up as a substitute . 
  i googled this and found an origin forum post with people complaining about this and `` 16 people have this problem '' . 
  who knows how many really since i was n't able to click that `` me too '' button but anyway . 
  it 's apparently a thing . 
  does anyknow know of a working fix ? 
  i 've tried moving the players around and reset my rosters with no luck . 
  i was planning on trying out the free psn + version before ( likely ) buying the full version upgrade . 
  can i still buy the season from psn store or is it something they only sell with the retail special/collectors/deluxe / whatever edition ? 
  are they gon na treat it as a `` one off '' special event that only lasts one season and then revert back to where we were before season 4 or are they gon na start building on the `` dream pool '' foundation ? 
  has there been an announcement/blue post about it or is it all speculation at this point ? 
  also , what would you like to see ? 
  i personally think sc2 is now at the point where `` the greatest maps of all time '' is not only a fun thing , it 's a proper valid map pool . 
  some people on here seem to think that the dream pool is a `` gimmick '' while the current maps are more `` serious '' . 
  i do n't think the current pool is bad per se , but there 's honestly not a single map i 'd miss if it was gone . 
  the expected dream pool ( cloud kingdom , daybreak , ohana , antiga etc. ), 
  are all maps i hated to see go even though at the time i understood the need for a change . 
  i hope that after season 4 they keep the foundation from the dream pool , maybe combine it with some of the maps we have now and then start building on that just like they normally do with a few new maps per season . 
  the dream pool season could act as a testing period where these older maps could be tweaked to the new unit changes since wol . 
  there 's a reason these maps were so popular at the time . 
  they 're good maps . 
  we 've seen dozens of ladder/tournament maps come and go and most of them have n't attained this `` nostalgia '' status . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence . 
  about 2 weeks ago i decided i needed a headset for my ps4 . 
  i searched through the entire sub and read all the relevant posts and their comment sections . 
  not a single one mentioned the hyperx cloud . 
  most of the discussions seemed to suggest either sony 's own headsets which i was sceptical of or the astro a40/a50 which cost 250/300 $ new . 
  i broadened my search outside the ps4 sub into general `` gaming headset '' discussions and found a lot of recommendations for the kingston hyperx cloud , also known as the qpad qh-90 . 
  it even got positive reviews from `` hi-fi '' heaphone reviewers who usually hate everything with the name `` gaming '' on it . 
  for example :, 
  it 's not supposed to be the ultimate best headphones ones out there , but all the sources i found defined it as `` the best value for its price '' . 
  most places online asked 100 $ / $ for it but i was able to find mine for 79 $ . 
  after using it for a week i agree with everything on the video . 
  i do n't usually care about the `` unboxing experience '' but right out the box it just oozed the feeling of quality . 
  it was like opening an apple product except everything was black instead of white . 
  it had all the accesories one could wish for and ** real leather ** on the headphones , not something you usually get for 79 $ . 
  not to mention all the accesories one could wish for . 
  it plugs right into the ps4 controller with no additional cords going into the console nor the tv and in my opinion the sound quality is great . 
  i 'm not a hi-fi hobbyist but i do value good quality and these sound like 100-300 $ sennheiser/akg/bose headphones . 
  the mic is n't half bad either , you can hear it in the video linked above and in my opinion the sound is very clear . 
  i apologize if my post reads like an ad but i 'm just overwhelmingly impressed by these headphones . 
  if you 're looking to get a ps4 compatible headset for under 100 $ i would definitely recommend the hyperx cloud . 
  for a 100 $ you get a product that feels like 250 $ . 
  i googled a bunch and found some articles from 2013 saying it `` will '' be cross-platform and some old forum posts saying it is n't yet , but nothing definitive either way . 
  i tried the game today for the first time on ps4 ( and enjoyed it ) and i noticed a lot of the people spamming long messages in chat which would definitely indicate a keyboard being used . 
  i know war thunder is ps4-pc cross platform so i know it 's possible to do . 
  i also noticed in the party mission loading screen that different people had different loading times . 
  has anyone tried playing with a friend and knows for sure whether it 's cross-platform ? 
  does it predate written history ? 
  are there noticable differences between cultures ? 
  these new tv/movie adaptations ( obviously impacted by hollywood and modern beauty standards ) as well as older written accounts ( obviously impacted by possibly being retold hundreds of times before written down ) often describe powerful generals and skilled warriors having the `` most beautiful '' female companions in the land . 
  in the age of physical hand-to-hand combat would n't it have been more beneficial for them to marry a so called `` butcher 's daughter '' type ; a strong , tall , physically almost male-like woman ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken people have been breeding horses and cows and other work animals for thousands of years but would the scientists or intellectuals of the time realize the same also applied to humans ? 
  was n't the general consensus in many ways that humans were different from animals and `` above '' them ? 
  how about the laymen ? 
  in the ( obviously fictional ) show game of thrones there is this big storyline around a dark-haired king having a blonde-haired son .
