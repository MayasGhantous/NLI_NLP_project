  would something like this have caused controversy among the common folk in the medieval times ? 
  how about ancient cultures around 500bc-500ad or even older ones around the world ? 
  i 'm new to the game and still tweaking my settings . 
  i do n't have media keys so i bound a button as a `` global hotkey '' in foobar to pause/play . 
  unfortunately it does n't work while i 'm playing arma , even if i 'm in `` borderless window '' . 
  the other games i tried did n't have any problems with it whish is why i figured it 's an issue with arma and not the player/windows . 
  the buttons are tried are not used by the game . 
  i know starcraft 2 has an option called `` disable os hotkeys '' . 
  could arma have something similiar ? 
  i checked the settings and the launcher and google and did n't find anything . 
  e. just a minor update . 
  i found out i 'm able to use the hotkeys while in arma but with the steam overlay open . 
  it is a semi-acceptable workaround but if anyone has suggestions i 'd love to hear them as i often have to do it in a hurry . 
  i 'm using the nightdev follower alert with obs and while it 's easy and simple to use i could n't find a way to mute or set the volume for the sound in my own end . 
  it 's only a 4 second clip and i do n't mind it playing for the viewers whenever but as a player it 's sometimes very distracting as i ca n't hear anything for 4 second which can make a big difference with the ( in ) correct timing . 
  is there any way to make it so that i could n't hear it myself or it would only be barely audible for me ? 
  google did n't help . 
  i 've found some obs countdown plugins from google and a lot of people advising to just use a website and crop it out but i 'd really like to have decimals in the seconds like 00:05:23.698 or something like that . 
  mainly because it looks cool but also because it makes it seem like the time is going by a whole lot faster than if it 's just slow seconds . 
  anyone know a way to implement this ? 
  i 've seen similiar in some professional streams . 
  i purchased a custom announcer pack and in the wiki page it lists a number of `` welcome to dota '' announcements . 
  when are these supposed to play ? 
  i do n't hear anything when i start up the game . 
  i 've been getting this weird stutter a few times per game for the last week or so . 
  it 's not typical lag like i 'm used to in games , more like trying to run a game on a shitty computer . 
  it 's as if the game froze for less than half a second and skipped frames . 
  i have an i7-4790k , 970gtx , 16gb ram and the game 's installed on an ssd so hardware definitely should n't be a problem . 
  other games ( csgo and arma3 are the only ones i have installed ) work totally fine . 
  can it just be lag ? 
  i verified steam files but nothing is supposed to be wrong . 
  is there any other difference except for the lack of 3rd person ? 
  i 'm yet to notice anything else between these two . 
  additionally : why do people prefer the `` regular '' version ? 
  unless it 's the middle of the day all the hc servers are deserted . 
  is it just the name `` hardcore '' that scares people off ? 
  i find it hard to believe people would actually prefer the 3rd person view as it just turns the game mode into a huge campfest . 
  i do n't mean zombies . 
  i 'm just wondering if there are any mods that focus on scavenging loot and survival like dayz or battle royale but without the time limit ? 
  in wasteland people seem to be fully geared 2 minutes after spawning which kinda hurts the `` survival '' idea . 
  some life servers have `` rdm allowed '' zones which is the closest thing i 've found to what i 'm looking for but they 're often basically empty . 
  i really would not want to pay for dayz early access with everything that 's going on with the development and the fact that i really prefer the arma iii engine . 
  i 've been playing this game for 150 hours now and i still have n't found a good binding for changing chat channels . 
  i need it to be something easily usable while running/in combat so comma and period simply do n't work . 
  i tried tab and i tried tilde and while they were fine a lot of servers seem to have custom functions for those buttons that overlapped with my bindings . 
  anyone got a good suggestion ? 
  ctrl + a lot of buttons are available but they end up messing my stance in the heat of battle . 
  i tried middle mouse button but i 'm not a fan of ever taking my `` finger off the trigger '' and like to do as little as possible with the mouse . 
  shift/ctrl/alt + mouse wheel would be nice but i have n't found a way to bind these , anyone know how ? 
  right now it 's looking like i should just pick a good button i rarely use and unbind that since there 's not a lot of free keys in this game . 
  i just ca n't pick one . 
  maybe b since binoculars are rarely taken out in haste and can have a `` lower priority button '' ? 
  basically i chose the nicest looking picture for my first city without much research . 
  10 hours later i found out i can not have a harbor because harbors only work on seas and my map does n't have any ocean , just rivers and lakes . 
  i understand not allowing them on lakes but rivers should have trade routes in my opinion , at least in maps where there are only rivers . 
  i 've been using the fractal r5 with the gigabyte g1 sniper z97 motherboard and integrated sound card now for about 2 months . 
  i 've had loads of trouble with the audio and the drivers with the latest being the audio going `` crazy '' with sudden 100 % volume no matter where i put the mixer volume and only fixable by booting . 
  i uninstalled every driver i could find and redownloaded the audio driver ( once again ) from the gigabyte site . 
  this time i did not include the creative software which they incidentally seem to have also removed from the download page ( coincidence ? ) . 
  now the audio is working better than ever . 
  there has n't been a single `` outburst '' and also the mysterious `` pops '' at startup are gone . 
  however the front mic plug is n't recognized by windows ( 8.1 ) anymore . 
  the front audio jack is and i remember that originally the front mic was only recognized by the windows audio control panel ** after ** i used the creative software to select it and it `` installed '' it . 
  it did work after that so there should be no issue with the wiring . 
  so the question is : how to enable the front mic without installing the creative software ? 
  i do n't think my cables are long enough for me to use the back slots . 
  allright we all know the game has extensive mod support , that 's hardly a surprise anymore . 
  however i was extremely surprised when i started up the game today . 
  previously i had installed a `` no film grain '' mod . 
  today the game told me `` no film grain mod has been removed as redundant , your setting of film grain has been set to minimum '' and believe it or not they had introduced a new slider to the graphics settings which was already set to zero so that former mod users ( like me ) did n't need to touch a thing . 
  i 've seen games with good mod support but this is taking it to the next level . 
  i 'm trying to look for the clip where this [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qsriihn.jpg ) is from . 
  i remember seeing it sometime around when dannic was on stage but looking at the [ vod ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqpgq4hguvs ) i simply can not find it . 
  i think this video is identical to the twitch broadcast as far as i can tell . 
  there is no vod on twitch . 
  u/josh _ lyman posted the screenshot on 22:19 and harwell 's set was scheduled to begin around 21:55 so that should mean it 's somewhere around the 25 minute mark which matches my own memory but i 've watched it over and over and can not find it . 
  i 'd really appreciate if someone could help finding the aerial video footage . 
  does n't really even have to be this one , just some aearial footage of the event . 
  i 've been able to find some of the individual sets but does anyone have a link to the entire thing from start to finish ? 
  i 'm trying to get an alias to work so i could have a button that when held down would change keybinds . 
  i tried, 
  alias '' + example '' `` bind `` k '' `` new_command '' '', 
  alias '' - example '' `` bind `` k '' `` old_command '' '', 
  like i saw on some tutorials but it does n't work . 
  i can see the alias if i type just `` alias '' in the console but binding the key to alias does nothing . 
  it just says `` bind <key [ command ] '' whenever i press the key . 
  i tried all the possible combinations of quatation marks too so it 's not about that . 
  it 's weird because i have a different alias for a camera thing and that one works just fine . 
  does anyone know if there 's something specific to keybind aliases i have to do ? 
  i 'm a semi new player , i 've only played for about 6 months ( 500 games ) and i 've always used the hero icons , i 've just found it to be more convenient . 
  i occasionally play with some friends who 've played the game for a long time and they all seem to use the dots . 
  in voip i constantly hear stuff like `` one bot ... that 's . . sniper '' or `` yellow in the trees ... invoker '' etc. 
  it just seems to make them do unnecessary checking of which hero is which . 
  are they just used to it and do n't like change or is there actually any upside to using the dots ? 
  i know the dots show direction but that seems like a very minor thing seeing as how heros have 360 vision and can turn pretty quick . 
  so , newbie here . 
  i read the reddit faq and the official site faq and i was unable to find an answer to this question . 
  some post said that every ship and item is unlockable via in-game credits you earn by playing but in the official faq the only thing about unlocking ships via in-game currency i can find is about some 7 day rental system . 
  has it been confirmed that every ship is unlockable ** permanently ** if you buy the cheapest package and do n't put any more real world money into the game ? 
  i tried to google but only found posts about upgrading from mr to ln .
