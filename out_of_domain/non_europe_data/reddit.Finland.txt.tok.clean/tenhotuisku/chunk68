  did you read anything i said ? 
  skilled workers and intellectuals tend to head for countries where they can use said skills and become rich , the u.s being a prime example . 
  the way the finnish system is you 'll be lucky to make any money and even then you 'll pay half in taxes . 
  which of course attracts those who do n't have skills or a plan and scares anyone with a vision away . 
  for future, 
  a quote from a member of the green party before the last elections . 
  no i am not and if you were n't so scared of the truth you 'd realize it . 
  i never ever once stated that foreign people were inferior . 
  what i said was that the educated or skilled immigrants do n't come to finland as we have nothing to offer and our country attracts the less educated and skilled immigrants . 
  are you saying that every single foreigner is exactly as smart ? 
  because it appears so and that 's a pretty stupid statement . 
  even if i said that an average immigrant is less educated than an average finnish person it still would have nothing to do with racism . 
  i 'm not saying their brains are inferior because of their country of origin . 
  finland has one of the best educational systems in the world while many of the countries from which immigrants come do not . 
  it 's not racism . 
  mexicans jumping over the border to the u.s is in no way comparable to our situation . 
  there are very few if any immigrants for which finland is the closest or only country they can run to . 
  they choose to come here over countries where they 'd be better rewarded for their hard work even though we are further away in worse climate . 
  do you really think there is n't a reason they choose finland ? 
  we already have plenty of less fortunate to help . 
  did they take blood samples or mri 's etc ? 
  testing like that can be expensive . 
  not $ 30k expensive unless they made huge profits ( which they undoubtedly did ) but still . 
  it 's already happening and has been for some time . 
  why is it stupid , please elaborate ? 
  if i was to leave my home country and were skilled or educated there is no way i 'd choose finland . 
  i 'd go somewhere where i could actually succeed and make money . 
  now if i was to leave my home country and knew i 'd have nothing there but to rely on social security then of course i would choose a country like finland or sweden . 
  it 's just common logic . 
  ac2 came out in 09 and i visited firenze about 2 months later . 
  ac3 came out in 10 and i visited rome about 2 months later . 
  yeah it was pretty awesome, 
  as long as you 're alive your finger will never be too dry . 
  well if you have some rare skin condition then idk, 
   if he 'd beat up someone else he 'd deserve the scorn just as much, 
  true , but the point was he would get it . 
  you have to pick which people to beat up . 
  beating up men is always a solid choice and if you can pick one that 's the same color as you . 
  guaranteed not to get in trouble . 
  i wonder who downvotes comments like yours . 
  i also wonder if they 're covering their eyes and ears and yelling no no no ca n't hear you while redditing . 
  you need gold for that ? 
  ^ ^ ( this & nbsp ; is & nbsp ; going & nbsp ; to & nbsp ; suck ... ), 
  e. apparently not, 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  i only played 1 & 2 and was just wondering if i should try out 3 after seeing this post . 
  i have a mac too but i run windows 7 in a windowed virtual machine . 
  games older than a ~ 2-3 years work just fine . 
  learn your mac . 
  those `` cover up scents '' e.g. 
  glade tend to smell horrible though . 
  it 's like a mixture of chemicals and headache . 
  well at least the creators were considerate enough to name it so that you could convert it into a doomsday device and keep the old signs . 
  the z machine . 
  you must have a `` yahoo !, 
  fuck that, 
  i 've tried different perks but in the end i always notice there 's nothing nearly as good as this combo ( flak , sleight , ninja ), 
  well that 's one of the reasons i have n't bought a single legit movie for about 5 years, 
  yeah . 
  too bad this one is n't big enough for a desktop background either :(, 
  works just fine after lion came out . 
  as long as you did n't upgrade to that piece of crap lololololol, 
  it takes me about 2 minutes to download a 720p rip . 
  in that time i could have put my shoes on and walked to the car . 
  of course then i 'd have to drive to the store , find if they have the movie , possibly go to another one , buy it , drive back and rip it :p, 
  yeah and i bet a presidential candidate does n't mind if he gets more publicity . 
  newfag here . 
  wow i ca n't even imagine reddit without subreddits . 
  shit would probably suck . 
  the finnish mcdonalds has been unprofitable every year since they started . 
  still we have tons of mcdonalds 's all across the country . 
  i think it 's to maintain the image they 're everywhere . 
  the world 's northernmost mcd is in finland as well . 
  e. i 'm not sure about this but i 've heard it 's the only country where mcd never makes profit . 
  what do you mean `` back '' to windows ? 
  a ** true mac user ** must praise every single update apple puts out ? 
  i find it funny that listening to footsteps is nowadays called `` soundwhoring '' . 
  back in the days of counter-strike i 'd say 9 out of 10 used headphones and it was an essential part of the game . 
  as it still is in cod imho . 
  now that i think about it i did n't know anyone who did n't use a headset . 
  and if for some reason someone had to do it they 'd be sure to mention in in their nickname :p, 
   what classes/gamemodes should i use it on ? 
  all . 
  the difference is huge . 
  but especially s & d, 
  i still do n't know a situation where garlic powder would taste better than legit garlic though . 
  it 's easier to use i 'll give you that but then again groud beef and ketchup is easier than chili . 
  yeah i have , they 're useful in some situations but horrible in others , ar 's are reliable all around . 
  i must point out though that i pick up a lot of weapons , i almost always get most guerilla kills . 
  elte is lagging behind , that spas-12 class has been another galil for some time :p, 
  butt hurt . . ism ? 
  you sound like a true newfag, 
  i do n't see how someone can have a problem with me calling ** myself ** one as i am a newfag but whatever . 
  he 's looking for sr2 but i highly recommend tryng out jc2 as well . 
  there are roads . 
  you can see a few in the middle but the angle and tall buildings block out most . 
  like they do in any aerial photo of a big city e.g. 
  [ nyc ] ( http://www.tropicalisland.de/nyc_new_york_central_manhattan_from_helicopter_b.jpg ) or [ hong kong ] ( http://www.globalphotos.org/hongkong/20070929/img_2242.jpg ), 
  e. i think i might 've just whoosh 'd, 
  please please reupload the full size , this is just under my native resolution and a forced resampling like this is never good .
