  it 's still a shitty post cluttering up the front page . 
  i do n't care if the submitter got imaginary points for it or not , i simply do n't want to see `` upvote if you like weed hurr durr '' posts . 
   deeply misogynistic, 
  you do know that misogyny means hatred of women , right ? 
  how is a picture of a beautiful woman and `` i 'd like to have sex with this women '' in any way hateful towards women ? 
  it 's the opposite for god 's sake . 
  we do n't hate her , we * adore * her . 
  well to be honest i expected to find someone in the comments who was just looking to be offended . 
  i do n't know but if someone did i sure as hell would n't post a comment claiming it 's misandrist . 
  that would just be retarded . 
  right here we can see a typical `` i 've smoked twice so i know everything about weed '' person . 
  smoke looks like there 's still a lot of thc in it . 
  lol, 
  i hate to be the one to break this to you but it 's been possible to pause live tv for years now , dude . 
  i 've had a dvr that can do that for 4-5 years now . 
  yeah i checked at the time but it would had had to be shipped from the u.s also and the shipping costs were outrageous . 
  i 'll have to see if i could find it in amazon uk or somewhere . 
  winter beats summer any day . 
  deal with it, 
   but yes dvr can pause , just like tivo, 
  tivo is a dvr , it 's just a brand name . 
  like the iphone is a phone . 
   he just waits for the go and goes, 
  no he does n't . 
  in fact he almost drives over the guy telling him not to go . 
  i see this pic once a week on reddit, 
  finnish ingenuity at work, 
  no it does n't, 
  only an idiot buys ram from apple though . 
  when i got my mbp ( ' 07 ) it would had cost me around $ 800 to add 4gb ram from apple store . 
  so i got it with the default 2gb , sold them for $ 70 and bought 4gb of better ram for $ 150 . 
  stupidity is cross-platform . 
   with a pen and paper i always use the apostrophe like : 1218 '75, 
  spring and autumn fucking suck though . 
  both winter and summer have their ups and downs but there 's nothing good about spring or fall . 
  it 's just wet everywhere and you ca n't play winter or summer sports/activities . 
  the modern typewriter , aka pc , is nice for surfing porn and all but video games ? 
  pfft . . 
  i 'll rather use a machine and an input device designed for that . 
  ps3 has no games though, 
  if you like error messages and installing drivers that is, 
  i primarily do n't play point 'n click adventures or [ typing of the dead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_typing_of_the_dead ), 
  also , whoosh . 
  how about the time he opened the `` sound activated '' safe using wine glasses with the help of a parrot, 
  macgyver works as a problem solver for the fictional phoenix foundation in los angeles . 
  educated as a scientist and with a background from a fictional united states government agency , the department of external services ( dxs ) , he is used as a resourceful secret agent able to solve a range of problems .

  s1 e12, 
  there 's no reason to roll a joint without a crutch, 
  it does n't make you less of a man if you smoke comfortably, 
  even more wtf, 
  unless i 'm playing s & d i always select blackbird , chopper , dogs, 
  if i try something like you described i just get pissed when i reach 11 anyway, 
  i think the point was che was n't too big on capitalism which malls are almost a symbol of . 
  mw3 looks really stale too though, 
  i do n't know about suggestive but [ here 's ] ( http://rule34.paheal.net/post/list/glados/1 ) some glados related porn in case you 're interested . 
  might 504 , just refresh . 
  what does this have to do with pc ? 
  i have more pirated games for my 360 than my pc . 
  well at least more new games . 
  shit dude . 
  i was wondering why i 've been having amazing dreams for the past few weeks but now i realize it 's probably related to my `` almost t-break '' ( once or twice a week does n't hurt , right ? ), 
  i started playing cod again and prestiged twice inside a week because i did n't have anything else to do ( t-break ), 
  i prefer zero and other `` fruity '' sodas but i agree about hfcs . 
  i can barely drink a small bottle of `` regular '' soda nowadays let alone enjoy it . 
  there 's a button that forces a refresh, 
  why would you use either one of those . 
  both are complete crap . 
  the `` re-calculate '' button next to the time until next prestige . 
  i do n't know exactly what it 's supposed to do but i clicked it once when the stats were lagging and it updated all of them . 
  i do n't think this would work . 
  i do n't know about the majority but i for example do n't give a shit about my karma total . 
  and i have enough to spare for downvotes . 
  i think it can be called a sort of hypocrisy . 
  pretending not to swear yet every reader still knows exactly what swear word you mean . 
  i think sh!t is just the same as shit as both create an identical reaction in the reader . 
  did you even look at the video ? 
  it clearly is n't, 
   and we 're not going to keep populating a planet that we know is n't going to survive , are we ?!, 
  not sure if sarcasm, 
  holy fuck i had only seen old stuff from amia before . 
  too bad . 
  of course they do but a huge amount of hot `` natural '' women in porn come from czech or hungary or germany . 
  especially in proportion to population or amount of porn produced . 
  i do n't know why , but i 'm glad they realize not to ruin themselves . 
  i liked the comic but this is more f7u12 material than classicrage . 
  especially with all the text . 
  the two subreddits are n't competing nor interchangeable . 
  po 'd ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=po%27d ), 
  when a woman is upset by a new found sensation during sex where one is conflicted by the feeling of having to `` p `` ee or the possibility of the best `` o `` rgasm ever !, 
  yeah raging about your hands only being `` 95 % dry '' seems a bit douchy, 
  some of the missions are seriously like 20 seconds . 
  granted you arrive with an assault chopper but in jc2 is that really so unlikely ? 
  the reason i have never done a single smoke trick with weed, 
   99.9 % of all ak-47s are semi-automatic . 
  you clearly have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . 
  99 % of all ak-47s ** registered in the u.s ** might be semi-automatic , but you do realize that the ak is the most illegally sold rifle in the world ? 
  and most if not all of those are fully automatic . 
  poop butt, 
  is n't it fight pokemon item run ?
