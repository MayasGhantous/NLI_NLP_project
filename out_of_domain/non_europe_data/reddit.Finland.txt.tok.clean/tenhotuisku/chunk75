  of course there are fancy chocolate stores in every country but i 'm talking about the shit 90 + % of americans consume, 
  well tbh i do n't really feel bad for women who get `` raped '' and do n't do a single thing trying to fight back . 
  if you just lay there and maybe say `` no '' once you 're an idiot . 
  scratch his face with your nails and you 're a victim , or even more likely free to go . 
  just yesterday i read about a rapist who had been arrested and 4 out of his 3 victims just basically walked away . 
  two screamed and fought until he let go and 1 `` fooled '' him by saying let 's get out of these bushes and into my apartment , then ran . 
  not surprisingly the only one that did get raped admitted she did n't actually try fighting back . 
   nsfw is for pussies no matter where you work, 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't even work actually, 
  this is one of the many downvoting romans i 've downvoted . 
  we play ~ 20 games a week together . 
  it 's not just casual . 
   the point is this , you should not have to physically fight to defend your rights , otherwise the strong will always dominate the weak . 
  i 'm not saying these guys are innocent . 
  just that it 's hard for me to sympathize sometimes . 
  of course , but stick lifting is also very effective while turning or changing directions, 
  play now , what do you think ? 
  we all have eauhl teams as well but just because the `` friendly '' matches are n't ranked on some leaderboard does n't mean they 're any less competitive . 
  in fact it 's personal every time . 
  in civilized countries this would be illegal as fuck . 
  you need to pay your employees properly . 
  tips are extra for good work . 
  or if you attached the rock-it to another rock-it, 
   [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ki7zu/ents_we_need_to_talk/ ) is dead-on , too , and deserves your upvotes . 
  not `` look guys , my birthday is 4/20 , give me karma for it '' . 
  fuck that guy . 
   i 'm very dissapointed in all of you right now , just over 2 weeks ago we talked about making / r/trees a better place by uptoking self.posts, 
  we did n't talk . 
  there was a single submission that got some upvotes . 
  who are you to say i dissapoint you when this 110.000 people community is n't exactly what you would want it to be . 
  also most of the self.posts are shitty . 
  image submissions are what i come to r/trees for . 
  not blatant karma whoring , but image posts . 
  self posts are n't automatically good . 
  a lot of them are worse than image submissions . 
  this is a 115.000 people community . 
  if it is n't exactly what you would like you do n't have the right to be `` dissapointed in us '' . 
  they 're just horrible in every way, 
  just like those [ ergonomic chairs ] ( http://www.office-furnitures.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ergonomic-stool.jpg ), 
  some finns claim they are scandinavian as well ( wtf , right ? ), 
   a dish draining closet is designed to hold all your dishes, 
  i see you live alone, 
  in some sort of utopia that could work but in the real world you , sir , are full of shit . 
  you 're playing against computer . 
  that 's your problem . 
  in 10 , 11 and 12 i 've played maybe 3 total games against cpu, 
  itt butt hurt neckbeards, 
  chanel preston - anal all the way !,

  [ screens ] ( http://imagetwist.com/mbfnmxgfpvul/oil_overload_4_-_chanel_preston_scr.jpg.html ), 
  thank you google image search, 
  i have both the xbox360 and ps3 . 
  not only does the ps3 want to update the system every fucking time i turn it on , it 's game updates take about 15 minutes on average . 
  with my xbox they 're 5-20 seconds on the same internet connection . 
  yes i 've configured the settings and my router . 
  all my friends with ps3 have similiar experiences . 
  idk if it varies by location ( northern europe ), 
  you might as well just burn your money if you 're into that sort of thing, 
  do you play cod or other multiplayer games that use p2p instead of servers ? 
  on ps3 i get a `` unable to connect host '' or `` could n't migrate hosts '' etc. 
  maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the games i play . 
  on xbox that happens maybe once in 20 to 40 games . 
  the main problem i have with psn are reliability problems like this . 
  not to mention games that can never connect to multiplayer ( i 've tried to play uncharted 2 online dozens of times with no luck ), 
  rarely works that well though, 
  demonoid lolooolol, 
  it is though, 
  golden virginia is the best . 
  uptoked for that alone . 
  just because you hate women does n't mean you 're scared of them . 
  because you 're the only one who actually cares about karma, 
   seems rather unlikely that a college kid would actually be doing that . 
  looks like something right out of bond . 
  i sort of assume he was referencing a movie or game or novel . 
  and it 's posted to r/gaming, 
  i 'm right handed and left-eye dominant but when i learnt to shoot i also learned to switch the `` dominance '' quickly and easily . 
  i just tested again and apparently i 'm still left eye dominant but if i just though about it for a fraction of a second before placing my hands i could constantly `` be '' right eyed as well . 
  in the end movie theaters are about making money . 
  they would n't not show something that would attract tons of moviegoers just because it 's not tradition . 
  or would they ? 
  it also got tons of free advertisement . 
  i still think the potential complaints would had been worth the additional sales . 
  cleveage and lesbians are not a bad marketing strategy for a movie like this . 
   thus , after over 2 + years of redditing , i 'm quitting . 
   enjoy your playground , children . 
  anyone else find this hilarious ? 
  first of all you 'll be back and secondly it 's not like anyone would miss you anyway . 
  i come to reddit for entertainment . 
  sure the informative posts are nice . . as longs as they 're entertaining as well . 
  you were able to find one troll on the internet . 
  that subreddit must be completely ruined . 
  who gives a shit about the impression we give to some stranger across the globe who 's looking for cat pictures and porn . 
   i think you mean reddit is becoming / b /, 
  lol i wish, 
  why not ? 
  also get some friends . 
  i primarily play nhl as a multiplayer game and it 's the most fun that way . 
   at the bottom, 
  so the system works , right ?
