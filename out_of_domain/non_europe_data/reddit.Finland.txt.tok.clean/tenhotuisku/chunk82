  well it did work perfectly, 
  it 's really not that fun for anyone, 
  especially when they stop playing, 
  it 's 2011 . 
  we have abortion and the morning after pill . 
  the reason i did n't play the 10 minutes was the 50 minute cut scene, 
   bongs dont have carbs, 
  carb 314 up , 40 down, 
  the hole found on pipes and bongs, 
  i just said i have used dozens of bongs with carbs on them . 
  i have made bongs with carbs on them . 
  i own bongs with carbs on them . 
  in fact where i live bongs without carbs are a rarity . 
  why the fuck would bongs not have carbs ? 
  a bubbler has a bowl that you ca n't remove, 
  tons of bongs have both a removable bowl and a carb . 
  here is just a random [ bong ] ( http://www.head-nature.com/images/product/00389/00389.jpg ) to illustrate . 
  first result made of glass for `` bong '' on google . 
  i just wonder what she looks like naked . 
  or maybe the clothes are glued on so you ca n't find out . 
  bf3 for xbox ? 
  that 's a retarded idea . 
  did you even try the beta ? 
  and know that the game has 64 players in the proper version and 24 on 360 ? 
  i love battlefield but . . that 's just stupid . 
  that sounds like it would be better without the alcohol, 
  i still ca n't understand what kind of a grown up person misspells simple words . 
  especially with a pen . 
  you 're saying that like i 'd ever leave the house, 
  i wear sweat pants and a hoodie when i smoke outside . 
  so far cops have n't bothered me . 
  i have a mac that wo n't run bf3 . 
  i 've owned every battlefield except for heroes , bc1 and 2142 . 
  i love battlefield , i have over 450 hours in bc2 alone . 
  but i 'm simply not getting bf3 . 
  the xbox version is just not worth it . 
  and the beta was fucking horrible . 
  not the bugs but the graphics , the map , the gameplay . 
  just horrible . 
  when i know i 'm going to be in a crowded public area i take a cigarette , empty it , fill with weed and replace the filter with a crutch . 
  works every time . 
  yeah me too . 
  when i was a beginner i did it more though . 
  and still occasonally if i 'm going to see a movie or something and have to smoke in the middle of downtown with tons of people around . 
  of course rape is traumatic . 
  it 's usually so traumatic that taking a pill the next day should n't be a big deal compared to that . 
  also raising a kid you did n't want can pose quite a problem as well . 
  i think he meant a situation where a man is raped and he ejaculates inside the rapist therefore impregnating her, 
  i make fun of all the religions . 
  has worked out just fine . 
  i have 3 gmails and 1 youtube account . 
  you can log in to all of them at once and select which one to use from the top . 
  works fine for me . 
  i do n't want to discuss gaming with people who do n't recognize these games, 
  i would mind if you linked some of those new movies that make old ones look mediocre . 
  when looking through a toilet paper roll both the surrounds and the view inside the tube are the same . 
  if your eyes are focused in a far away object using a scope you wo n't be able to look at the surroundings accurately . 
  sure you 'll see some blur but it 's nothing like in that pic . 
  you 're gon na hate that song in about a week, 
  these games came out in the late 90s and are still popular and active . 
  it 's more like a picture of bill clinton . 
  the party in the party store was one of the best . 
  lighten up . 
  the mcdonalds one in the end was just being a dick . 
  especially the way he drove away . 
  i would had laughed had he just stayed there and continued with his order as though everything was normal . 
  because europe, 
  this is on the top of reddit . 
  those imgur stats are way behind . 
  i 'm unemployed and love it . 
  i live in a country where unemployment benefits are noticable . 
  also i rarely drink and never in bars which saves me a lot . 
  i spend a lot of time playing pirated games and watching pirated shows and movies which i enjoy a lot . 
  i cook my own food . 
  i live near a `` sport park '' with many facilities and soccer fields that i can use for free . 
  i know . 
  most bongs i 've used have a similiar bowl and a stem but also include a carb . 
  i 've only seen carbless bongs in the u.s or imported from the u.s. 
  i do n't know why . 
  context ? 
  did you look like that though ?

  i agree with most but living in a country with free college education after living in the u.s. 
  i do think that higher education should be a right , not a privilidge . 
  not technically without clothes but i 'll allow it & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  taxpayers pay for it . 
  like they do for infrastructure and medical car ... oh wait, 
  having education available for everyone will ultimately benefit the society as a whole . 
  we believe it 's a right everyone should have , not just the ones blessed with good fortune . 
  i hate taxes just as much as the next guy but in my mind education is the best possible use of that money . 
  much better than military spending for example . 
  why is there 3 colors on the legend yet only 1 in the picture ? 
  why agree to a second reception ?
