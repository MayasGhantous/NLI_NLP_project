  it 's your wedding after all . 
  mother in laws tend to be a bit crazy and you do n't have to obey them . 
  well either way , when you are old enough to get married you are old enough to decide about your reception and to occasionally say no to your parents . 
  also the wife whose mother-in-law she in fact is should have some say . 
  what i mean is just because it 's his mom does n't mean she 's not a crazyish mother-in-law . 
  my guess is some inbred ( religious ) community, 
  my guess would be some inbred ( religious ? ), 
  community, 
  wtf i even specifically deleted the duplicate post after i had gotten a 507 error befote :(, 
  i do n't think there 's a `` best part '' to forcing 15 year olds into battle . 
  i find it less heroic and patriotic and more just ... plain wrong . 
  downvoted for giving attention whores attention . 
  then i noticed you did n't censor the names and was forced to change it to an upvote . 
  i wonder if the kind of people that are persuaded to give her money with `` spacecraft '' are often turned away by the god part . 
  talking about america ! = talking about every single individual who lives in america, 
   not to mention the fact that a person dies , you insensitive clod . 
  we need people to die . 
  and control their urge to reproduce . 
  the planet wo n't sustain humans if we keep going on like this . 
  i know it 's harsh and maybe not what you want to hear in your cotton candy filled unicorn mind but we must lower the population and every time i hear of africans or indians dying it makes me a little happy inside . 
  with the selection of nutcases available i might as well choose the one who wants to legalize cannabis . 
  all that shows is that people in poor countries with poor healthcare have lots of babies . 
  correlation is not causation . 
  yes . 
  well define `` doing shit '' . 
  when i was employed i used to do exactly the same . 
  it makes me happy which is enough for me . 
  oh i thought you meant activity-wise . 
  you are correct , i contribute nothing . 
  how do you spawn items with numbers like 97:1 ? 
  i only get the whole numbers to work . 
  yeah totally . 
  computers/the internet can somehow simulate sex but you ca n't get directions , great prices or cat pictures by having sex . 
  unless i 'm doing it wrong . 
  in this case i did n't mean `` support '' as in have enough food but support as in sustain breathable air and drinkable water with human pollution . 
  sure if we switched over to renewable energy and reconsidered manufacturing etc. 
  processes there would be room for many more but that 's not very likely to happen . 
  yeah i mean i would n't turn in the new ggg, 
  oh why did i instinctively click the `` view images '' button, 
  yes . 
  even in finland with 10.000 out of ~ 5,5 million they 're a huge problem . 
  referring to gypsys as human beings . 
  not sure if serious . 
  the legend + color depicts the percentages somewhat, 
  i think the reason you 're getting downvoted is how handy they are with their feet . 
  the legend + color depicts the percentages somewhat, 
  i do n't think they 've had any funding to `` set aside '' for years now, 
  and if they do they should n't . 
  there are better uses for that money right now . 
  it 's not like anyone would want to invade a country in that state . 
  the u.s stopped producing them in 1992 . 
  i read somewhere that it 's estimated to cost over a million dollars each to refurbish . 
  you 're welcome, 
  - eu countries actually paying for these tanks, 
  i marked it as nsfw about 2 seconds after submitting and that was 8 hours ago . 
  holy fuck 8 hours ? 
  and i 'm still on the internet . 
  what the fuck is wrong with the single black guys face, 
  so what 's the advantage of having a bottle within a bottle ? 
  how high do you fill the upper one ? 
  crime . 
  beggers . 
  we do n't have homeless like you do in the states so ogranized roma beggers in every corner has become a big issue since they opened the borders to some of these eastern european countries couple years ago . 
  they have like a begging pimp and turfs and everything . 
  then there 's just the regular stealing and hustling . 
  i 'd estimate about 50 % of the news stories or police `` warnings '' about hustling describe '' `` dark '' individuals in a old mercedes with lit/lat/rom etc. 
  license plates '' . 
  i 've personally seen more roma women shoplift stuff than kids do . 
  they use those huge skirts to hide stuff . 
  also a lot of violent crime . 
  just last year there was a story about a gypsy who got mad in mcdonalds drive through and shot three people . 
  now this may be just another weekend in some states but shit like this never happens here . 
  if there 's been a stabbing it 's about 50/50 it was a gypsy . 
  the rate of crime per people is just outrageous . 
  most do n't consider themself finnish . 
  they 're roma first , nationality comes second . 
  therefore they rarely obey any rules , exploit the social services ( which is way too easy here ) act violently and just fuck around all the time . 
  it 's a cultural thing . 
  but it does n't mean we should tolerate it . 
  e. oh and if there 's a car in the handicap space it 's more likely than not to be a gypsy . 
  actually screw that , it 's always gypsys . 
  and an old mercedes . 
  oh that 's cool but does n't that leave very little space for the smoke if you fill it up to the cap ? 
  you should n't have posted that, 
  now they know, 
  eu countries are financed by currency swaps of the federal reserve ? 
  i care far more about my personal preferences than the policies of reddit, 
  it 's incredible how it took me like 2 seconds to identify her from the op 's pic .

  they claim the original source to be [ this ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hellenicdefence.gr%2feidiseis%2fe2011%2f110929c.html ) website/magazine called `` hellenic defence & technology '' . 
  * the monthly magazine '' [ greek defence & technology ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hellenicdefence.gr%2fperiodika%2famyna%2famyna.html ) '' has established itself as the most reliable , authoritative and accurate edition of the sector in the greek language . 
  it is written by professional journalists with decades of experience in the presentation of defense policy and technology , and academic specialists on international relations and strategic studies , providing an excellent , independent , open-minded and balanced analysis of developments in greece and the world , which is unique in the greek media . 
  note that even the news article did n't have specific numbers as to the price so the deal may not be 100 % official yet . 
  or complete bullshit , who knows . 
  oh i did n't realize there was so much space for smoke in the bottom one as well . 
  that makes sense . 
  but there is no way that upper part is .75 l, 
  it 's less than half lenght-wise and most of it 's the shape of cone , not straight . 
  when you are given over 100 billion to pay out your debt it 's not like the greeks have paid for anything themself for years . 
  i do n't have it but her name was posted here somewhere .
