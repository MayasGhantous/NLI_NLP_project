  i think it was lola from fuckingmachines.com or something . 
  too lazy to ctrl + f, 
  boohoo it 's the internet go cry, 
  please post instructions plox, 
  oh they 're human beings ? 
  well then if that 's the case then i do n't see any problem with this . 
  please carry on . 
  maybe you hate jews also ? 
  or blacks ? 
  that 's the stupidest fucking justification i 've ever heard . 
  of course they 're humans . 
  and idiots . 
  idiots who deserve all the flaming they might get for this . 
  i do n't think you understand how the internet works , son . 
  of course greece can pay . 
  they just agreed to give them 100 + billion euros . 
   they 're humans who are allowed to believe what ever they well please, 
  sure i 'll allow them . 
  but i 'll also laugh at them and shame them in public for stupid shit like this . 
  and they deserve every last bit of it . 
  freedom of speech does n't mean you could n't mock others for their moronic statements . 
  first of all adblock . 
  how does one not use abp in the year 2011 . 
  secondly i did n't even go to cnn to check out this article because i knew it to be crap and sensationalist . 
  i 'd be so happy to be a stay at home dad while my wife worked . 
  i love cooking and shit plus you get to wear sweat pants, 
  while i do n't think marriage is pointless i really can not understand the mentality that marriage is something everything should aim for as early as possible . 
  marriage is great if you meet the right person . 
  but marriage should n't be your primary goal when trying to find that said person . 
  that 's just fucked up . 
  like it 's a civic duty you need to fill . 
   `` too many men are not going to work , not getting married and not raising families . 
  women are beginning to take the place of men in many ways . 
  this has led some to ask : do we even need men ? '', 
  so if women are taking men 's place does that mean that we have n't needed women `` since the dawn of mankind '' ? 
  of course they always have it worse !, 
  it 's not like we live in a culture that 's basically built around one sex worshipping the other . 
  i honestly thought it was a typo . 
  had to google . 
  but yeah i laughed, 
  so what 's the health concern with au jus ? 
  many of us are not american and we were told not to sign it so that they would n't throw the entire thing out for `` tampering '' or some shit, 
  mcdonalds ' burgers are what political correctness would taste like,

  why did you censor the boobs ? 
   dvd, 
  or highlight the image with your mouse and `` view selection source '', 
  works at least in firefox, 
  that scale has been used long before reddit and r/trees to decipit [ 1 ] - [ 10 ] on boards like 420chan etc. 
  that 's where trees got the whole [ * ] - system from . 
   physical media, 
  installed . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  i tried this but that way i wo n't be able to click the `` share '' button or comment at all . 
  with priv3 it enables 3rd party cookies when i actually want to use the fb features . 
  please do n't :, 
  `` complain about a story being old . 
  reddit is about interesting stuff , not new stuff only .

  you can only do it so far, 
  do n't inhale and snap it out with your tongue instead of exhaling, 
  and the original pic looks better if you [ remove the _ thumb from it ] ( http://fitnesshealthandfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/whole-foods-tenleytown-market-grind-your-own-nut-butter-bar-chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg ), 
  at least the text is much clearer, 
  where is that ? 
  it looks so familiar yet i ca n't place it anywhere . 
   so deep they 've yet not healed, 
  not sure if serious , or if you 're over 80 years old, 
  what 's the struggle ? 
  either go to a head shop and buy one for $ 3-15 dollars or build one using any short tube and something like a [ wrench ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o8ymq.jpg ) [ socket ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xkxmm.jpg ), 
  paypal fucked me over about ~ $ 700 dollars . 
  have n't used them since . 
  maybe once or twice for $ 5 purchases . 
  i 'm just amazed someone 's pissed off about gore 's prize . 
  at least he did something , unlike obama . 
  this is a prime example of a law that 's ignored in 99 % of the cases but when you neighbour is a cop or he just does n't like your face or something you can be punished for nothing . 
  laws like this can suck my dick . 
   amsterdam are no better than the streetwhores you find anywhere else, 
  at this point i knew you were a troll, 
  it is pretty expensive but then again compared to other european cities it 's not that expensive . 
  it was pretty cheap where i came from , even though other dutch cities were much cheaper . 
  the weed is nothing special thc-wise , it 's just nice to have so many options and freedom . 
  and to all you kids out there : never buy the `` mega-super-420-extravaganza '' etc. 
  named weed . 
  that shit 's for tourists , overpriced and nothing special . 
  the best ones have usually simple names ( and probably recognizable if you know anything about that sorta stuff ), 
  you , sir , are simply not correct . 
  of course there might be some ultra-rightwing-nazi-parties in europe but none that ever actually gain any influence whatsoever . 
  the `` nationalist right winged '' parties that have been gaining popularity in europe are , like he said , something akin to far left in the u.s. 
  and the u.s democrats would be an extremely right winged party in most european countries . 
  no country has more to offer than weed . 
  trust me , i 've traveled the world . 
  i thought you were referring to the `` european conservatives '' or `` rise of conservatism '' as `` them '' . 
  yeah well i do n't know where to get a sandwich for under 5 euros either : /, 
  that 's why i pretty much always cook my own food . 
  `` online '' yet i ca n't find a link to open video, 
  4.40-5 .90 $ for 15cm and 7.30-8 .80 $ for footlong : /,
