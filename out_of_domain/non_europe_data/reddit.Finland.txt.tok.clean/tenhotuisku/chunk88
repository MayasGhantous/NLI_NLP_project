  right now they appear to have 14 months for 41 $ . 
  i just checked the price from xbox live ( for eu ) and it 's 59,99 $ for 12 months + 13,98 $ for the two additional so 73,97 $ for 14 months . 
  [bee.com ] ( http://www.bee.com/games/xbox-360/other/xbox-live-gold-12-month-membership-card/ ) has 12 months for # 31.24 which is 35.85 $, 
  you can find them for even cheaper on google,

  yeah i do n't know what kind of meat you people eat but this has never happened to me or anyone i 've heard of . 
  i do remember though that american mcdonalds beef tasted like absolute garbage compared to any other mcd i 've eaten at . 
  all stringy and chevy and shit . 
  some serious butt hurt going on over here, 
  that 's because women are crazy . 
  sarah 's craziness wo n't disprove it . 
  besides one of the few advantages being a man in the modern society is that you do n't have to worry yourself with shit like `` did i remember to apply moisturizer '', 
  how is it comfortable ? 
  i 'm seriously asking because i just find it bizarre and weird . 
  i know it 's an american custom and i see it in movies etc. 
  but i just do n't get it and extremely rarely have i seen anyone ( male ) do it in real life . 
  except for when feet are on the table etc but that 's another thing completely . 
  i 've never had a problem with my leg falling asleep while sitting so i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  the only time that happens is if i lift my feet up on the table and cross my ankles . 
  it was even worse in 11 because it was a fool-proof way to score . 
  one time this dickhead scored 7 goals in one match , every single one just skating towards the goalie holding the puck on the backhand and shooting it through the armpit . 
  oh well that makes sense but when i was talking about `` not crossing legs '' i meant not crossing legs as in having your left foot on the ground and right foor on the right side of it also on the ground . 
  i did n't even imagine someone would place a foot on their knee . 
  are you people seriously implying that most of you have * never * seen their parents do it ? 
  i mean maybe it 's just because i 'm european but i remember getting up to go to the bathroom or something at the middle of the night and peaking into my parent 's bedroom . 
  and i know tons of my friends have similiar stories ( with their parents , not mine ok ? ) . 
  i did n't really think that much of it then and do n't now . 
  i know they 've had sex , that 's why i exist . 
  i was n't sneaking a peek . 
  it was more like `` can i come sleep with you guys . . or not '' . 
  i did n't say anything though and remained undetected . 
  it 's not a dinner conversation but we 've talked about it with friends after a few beers etc. 
  and most people i know have seen their parents have sex one time or another . 
  has n't scarred anyone . 
  i just tried both of those positions and holy fuck are they awkward . 
  i get the whole crossing legs because of skirt thing but what exactly is the point of this for men ? 
  is n't it tiring to constantly keep your leg up ? 
  yeah i have like 75lbs on you with the same height and i have tree trunks for legs so that definitely has something to do with this . 
  so he 'd rather play against bots than random people ? 
  that 's just ... stupid . 
  we all do better in teams , but caring about your stats so much you rather play against cheating bots than go online solo is , like i said , stupid . 
  yay i got to give the [ 420th vote ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9jbey.png ) !, 
  i 'm 95 % sure it 's [ kayden ] ( http://profiles.myfreecams.com/kayden# ), 
  nope , [ x-art . com ] little caprice - backdoor lover 2011.09.19 hd 720p is when she was on her finest, 
  and friendship for everyone, 
  well she 's offline but i can see the profile just fine without logging in, 
  they do look a lot alike though , do n't they ? 
  but never ending reddit is the best thing about res . 
  that and the `` view images '' button . 
  she 's been doing some videos ( and anal !!! ), 
  for x-art . 
  i got them from cheggit . 
  do n't know if they 've been filmed months ago and just released now though . 
  well i never open a link in the same tab so that solves that . 
  addison o'riley - monsters of jizz, 
  e. confirmed . 
  pw is crazyguy, 
  i want to see the rest of the conversations, 
  water, 
  an entire bottle of alcohol ? 
  there 's no icon next to his name . 
  it took me a while to notice . 
  it burns better and more evenly with tobacco and makes you cough less ( even though i do n't smoke cigarettes ) . 
  there 's simply no reason for me to smoke weed without tobacco and luckily i do n't know any people who do that either . 
  when i was a kid lidl sold those exact matches for like 10cnts for 10 boxes or something , it was ridiculously cheap anyway . 
  i used to buy a ton of them and scrape off all the flammable powder to make little ied 's for lego men 'n shit . 
  cool stuff . 
  vicks vaporub, 
  these make me so mad, 
  you can make up room by deleting / system32, 
  yeah well i do n't really care what some french guy thinks and you know what ? 
  red wine is better when mixed with coke . 
  there , i said it . 
  i just did n't show up . 
  they mailed the papers next week anyway . 
  [ animated gif of quinn smoking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r7fkq.gif ), 
  it is . 
  you ca n't get the console limited edition for that cheap, 
  the water does n't actually filter the smoke in a waterfall , it 's just there to provide a vaccuum . 
  i would n't drink it but i have spilled it and it definitely does n't smell anything like bong water . 
  who 's talking about letting the smoke sit ? 
  but condom is like fucking a rubber duck . 
  that 's the whole point of birth control . 
  feels good man . 
  i 've been doing just great for years having sex with 0 problems because i have n't been with women who ca n't handle the task of eating one pill a day . 
  besides putting a condom on ruins the mood . 
  i do n't want that . 
  she wore it out to public where hundreds of people were going to see her anyway . 
  i do n't think posting a picture of it online is that much different . 
  someone 's seriously buying mw3 ? 
  i ca n't believe how some of you people can remember the details of that movie . 
  i 've never seen it sober .

  it is a true classic, 
  at least on most subreddits there 's an option to `` un-nsfw '' a post . 
  not sure if it works when there 's nsfw on the title though . 
  call ? 
  a bank ?
