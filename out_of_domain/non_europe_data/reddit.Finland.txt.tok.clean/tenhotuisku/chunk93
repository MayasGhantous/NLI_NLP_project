  i wan na make my own glasses now, 
  some isp 's are fighting it, 
  this happens every time outside the us, 
  not bashing america but it is a cultural thing . 
  rock paper scissors was invented for situations like this, 
  if considering quitting is enough to qualify a job as `` lousy '' i 'm pretty sure almost everyone has a shitty job . 
  when my grandma died my mom would n't let me play gran turismo for a day which pissed me off, 
  nice, 
  you got mad on the internet . 
  that 's the problem . 
  and planted the pistol on godzilla after killing it, 
  to be honest i do n't really see how that would be nice towards anyone :(, 
  looks like most joints, 
  seriously dude , it 's not that difficult . 
  not hating on op , it is a nice joint , but so are most . 
  i do n't even know how to do a cone with a machine, 
  obviously everything worked well for your dad but if i was woken up by a rebel attack in the middle of the night i 'd still run away as fast as i could even if i was completely naked and possibly looked silly . 
  you are actually full of shit . 
  closing down or turning on a computer uses almost exactly the same amount of power as having a computer run regularly . 
  sleep mode does n't use up much electricity but certainly more than the `` extra consumtion '' during those few seconds is . 
  also cite your studies . 
  worked smoothly . 
  4core 2.93 ghz i7 ( os x ), 
   leaving the computer on all the time will definitely consume more power than booting it up only when needed . 
  i have a ups which shows my real-time power consumption , in watts , at all times . 
  by far , the most power consumption occurs when i am actively using the computer , playing games . 
  booting it up does n't even come close to using the amount of power that i use while playing . 
  idle , i use between around 200 watts . 
  booting up , closer to 250 , so slightly more than idle . 
  actively using the computer i use over 350 watts . 
  first result from google . 
  you can search more by yourself if you want . 
  yes . 
  i 've killed animals to eat before . 
  i did n't especially enjoy it but it 'd be worth it if there was no other way to get meat . 
  depends . 
  i believe i can drive even if i 've smoked but there definitely is such a thing as `` too high to drive '', 
  eye drops . 
  i find that eyedrops for `` red and itchy eyes '' also make eyes look more matte white . 
  yes they do . 
  with alcohol the limit is around 2-3 beers . 
  are they paying for your school or something ? 
  because if not then that 's one dumb choice . 
   i do n't think it ever existed :(, 
  well the article does start with `` polybius is a ** supposed ** arcade game featured in an internet ** urban legend ** . '', 
  i do n't think you can actually name a specific amount of thc what with the tolerances and smoking experience and strains etc. 
  having a much bigger influence in my opinion . 
  post naked pictures of yourself on the internet with your own name, 
  be surprised when you get creepy messages, 
  you are right it could , but i do think the variety is bigger with weed . 
  if i drink 4 beers i 'll always be around the same buzz . 
  maybe a bit more if it 's some exotic beer and i have n't drank in ages but no change really . 
  with weed i can either be totally blazed or just kinda little high from the same amount depending on the quality of the weed , the smoking method , my tolerances at the moment , whether or not i 've smoked the same weed a lot in the previous days etc etc. 
  now i do n't really care who norm is and what he has to say but i would like to point out that it 's also a lot easier to `` sober up '' before driving if you 're smoking vs. drinking . 
  you can smoke weed , watch a movie , play some video games , be totally ok to drive , drive , then toke again and not drive for a few hours again . 
  does n't really work if you 're out drinking . 
  i know right . 
  born in ' 91 . 
  those silly youngsters . 
  everyone knows '90 is the shit . 
   okay . 
  so let 's say marijuana was legalized . 
  how would you decide the legal limits on driving under the influence ? 
  i have no idea . 
  that really is a problem with legalization . 
  now the cops carry around those `` quick drug tests '' but they show positive if you 've even touched weed in the last 2 weeks so that does n't work . 
   and norml is the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws . 
  they 're kind of a big deal . 
  kind of a big deal in america probably yeah . 
  they 're still just an organization . 
  i do n't base all my life decisions on what some organization thinks . 
  yes . 
  i admit i 'm not a scientist that has invented a new revolutionary way to measure highness . 
   all that you can say is that it 's okay when you do it . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  what i 'm saying is i do n't feel guilty driving if i 'm a little high or feel unsafe at all if i 'm in a car with a high driver ( that i personally know ) . 
  now if it was some totally random guy i 'd feel a bit iffy about it . 
  i honestly feel that most drivers are even more cautious if they 've smoked some . 
  i 've never seen anyone speed or gotten into an accident high ( neither of which applies to driving sober ) . 
  lack of knowledge ? 
  nigga please . 
  i did n't say anyone deserved anything . 
  i just said it was bound to happen and she should 've known that . 
  the two are n't mutually exclusive, 
  but would n't your life be even better with 10lbs of weed ? 
  i do n't think anyone argued fame whoring is what makes her a musician, 
  ps2 is just shit nowadays . 
  ca n't make out anything that 's happening on the screen . 
  sure those games were nostalgic but the technology for smooth 3d ( console ) games just was n't there at the time . 
  and the textures . 
  oh god . 
  i enjoy the even older 2d games with smooth gameplay a lot more than the ps1/ps2 era . 
  if i want 3d i 'll buy a new game . 
  you can see my house in this pic !, 
  well not really but you can see the tall buildings and trees next to it so it counts . 
  espoo has a population of 248,355 so hardly a village , 
  white thumbnail gave it away, 
  i do this . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  i live in `` the world '' ( outside us ) so i did n't think twice when i just posted this in the general news section .
