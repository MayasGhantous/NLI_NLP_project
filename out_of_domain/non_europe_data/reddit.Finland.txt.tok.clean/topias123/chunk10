  one day ... 
  i have an fx-8320 clocked to fx-8350 speeds ( 4.0 ghz ) , runs anything you throw at it, 
  the music made me deaf, 
  never happened to me : /, 
  gaben is love . 
  it 's a real thing , a swedish electronics store sells it, 
  now we need dx support in proprietary drivers, 
  kinda, 
  last one i bought was a medal of honor 3-game box i got for 2 $ from a flea market, 
  yeah , physx is crap . 
  i 'd like to see an opencl-based physics eyecandy thingymading in games . 
  there exists one already but noone uses it, 
  damn dude ... get a gtx 750 or something and you got yourself a great gaming pc . 
  if you do n't need it , sell/donate/borrow it to someone who would like to try pc gaming, 
  meanwhile i get like 30ms on french servers : i ( i live in finland ), 
  needz dust filter, 
  i still remember floppies, 
  i have an old 19 '' lcd lying around but i have no dvi cable for it , i 'd really like to set it up but have n't had time to buy a new cable, 
  all i have is a 30 $ ikea office chair ; ~ ;, 
  and office machines, 
  this reminds me of a weird bug i had on msi afterburner osd . 
  it showed false fps values over 1000 times larger in some games that use unreal engine . 
  you could say my pc is ... unreal, 
  i had a wireless $ 20 logitech and i had absolutely no issues with latency or battery life . 
  wireless is the 2nd biggest joke ever , the first one should be obvious, 
  i have an ssd for os and a hdd for games and other stuff so i do n't have that problem, 
  should run any game , from what i heard the 870m is pretty beefy . 
  also the cooling in asus laptops is a lot better than most gaming laptops so throttling should n't be an issue, 
  i know . 
  fuck you , fanboy . 
  i have the same card as him , but from a different manufacturer , and it works perfectly . 
  could you specify which games ? 
  i would try updating gpu drivers and directx, 
  get a samsung 840 or a kingston hyperx 3k, 
  it should work on that motherboard , just make sure your case has enough room, 
  save money . 
  it 's worth the wait , trust me . 
  i 've been thinking of getting a 800 $ asus vivobook with an i5-4200u for just browsing the internet , should i get that ? 
  what i need is a laptop with acceptable performance for even light gaming ( tf2 ) and great battery life , the laptop i was looking at is asus vivobook s301la . 
  my current laptop is a complete piece of shit , it ca n't even handle 5 chrome tabs , despite having 8gb ram . 
  ai n't modern technology wonderful ? 
  not running crossfire atm , but probably will if i need the extra fps, 
  i started in 2011 with ubuntu 10.04 , since then moved to arch, 
  11 pm here, 
  0 a.d , an open source aoe clone . 
  just discovered it , it 's pretty good, 
  is n't titan also a lot better in sli when compared to 780ti sli ? 
  i remember reading something like that, 
  [ c  ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3658375464.png ), 
  [ i use 2 ] ( http://blogs.umass.edu/techbytes/files/2014/03/2dfkk.png ), 
  sv_gravity 9001, 
  `` jumping is op , so we banned it '', 
  what does that do ? 
  tried googling but no results : i, 
  i have mine bound to '' \u00f6 '' ( '' : '' in american keyboard layout ), 
  i got a [ 8800gt ] ( http://www.overclockers.co.uk/pimg/gx-002-pn_400.jpg ) , 70c at idle , perfectly dusted and repasted , with good case airflow ( 4 140mm fans ) . 
  load temp about 90c . 
  had to use msi afterburner to ramp up the fan, 
  i have used ubuntu for 2 years now , and i have good eyes  currently i have win8 .1 / ubuntu 14.04 dual boot on my main rig , and arch linux on my shitty laptop, 
  the cpu on your laptop a [ celeron ] ( http://ark.intel.com/products/41498/intel-celeron-processor-900-1m-cache-2_20-ghz-800-mhz-fsb ) , right ? 
  you should try arch linux with linux-ck kernel . 
  i installed it on my laptop and it 's so much faster now . 
  i have seen worse . 
  my friend 's laptop ran at 180c before we dusted it . 
  after that 70c, 
  i love [ guake , ] ( https://imgur.com/0fig0cv ) i can just press shift + f12 ( or whatever button you have set it to , personal preference ) and i get a dropdown console :3, 
  [ lol ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5a/46/5c/5a465cbc3d0cf55d2606d69bc37a4c14.jpg ), 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-1955429/270x-crossfire-dominates-280x-290x.html ), 
  what ... 
  cost four hundred thousand dollars to use a gtx 880 for twelve seconds, 
  according to alienware , a i7-4770k and a gt610, 
  i 'd change the i3 to an amd fx-6300, 
  it 's always the damn drivers ... 
  i myself got just 1 270x , might upgrade to a 280x if i need to, 
  well , yeah , that 's what i had in mind but i only noticed after ordering my parts that my psu only has 2 6 +2 pcie connectors , even though it has enough wattage to handle 2 gpus, 
  we had this on a modded tf2 server once , and it actually went better than expected , we just had to watch out for drops higher than 0,5 m because of the goddamn falling damage . 
  i do n't think anyone died because of falling dmg though, 
  well , i forgot to take a screenshot so i have no way to prove it ... also i ca n't remember which games had the bug, 
  ahh , i never said that op 's unusually high fps was caused by a bug , i believe you can do it with a console command, 
  a friend of mine did this too , accidentally . 
  for some reason it broke his laptop 's integrated mic, 
  i went from radeon 7500  nvidia geforce fx5200  radeon 9550se  radeon hd 3000  radeon hd 5570  geforce 8800gt  my current one , r9 270x in 2 years . 
  do n't ask . 
  add me if you want , i play mostly tf2 nowadays, 
  ubis\u00f6ft and their drm ... 
  they 're just digging their own grave, 
  i have a similar apu , minecraft went from 15 fps to 45 by overclocking it to 3,3 ghz ( stock 1,65 ), 
  did n't the prices go up because sk hynix 's factory burned down ? 
  the most important part for me is freedom . 
  freedom to choose any part of your pc . 
  freedom to use any game service/store you want . 
  freedom to choose your os . 
  freedom to mod your games until they no longer start . 
  i 've seen hairier ... my uncle is a fucking gorilla, 
  do it m8, 
  mine ran perfectly fine for 6 hours gaming sessions ... 
  did n't even heat up any more than on stock, 
  longest i have played is like 30 hours . 
  not on my laptop though, 
  sometimes leaving a man behind is the only option ...
