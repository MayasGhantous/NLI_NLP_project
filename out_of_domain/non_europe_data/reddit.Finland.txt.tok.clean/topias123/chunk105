  i hope it 's just downscaled from whatever the guy was running . 
  what app ? 
  works fine on sync . 
  never got it working on arch linux myself : i, 
  i always max out anisotropic filtering . 
  does n't have a big impact on performance in my experience , and makes distant stuff look much better . 
  why not heaven instead ? 
  more demanding . 
  managed to get temps a bit down with repasting and applying less . 
  oh well , selling it to a friend , it 'll be his problem then . 
  mine is named `` sudo apt-get rekt '', 
  not a brony , or a hater of them , but i expected more hate in the comments lol, 
  runs fine , but ca n't use gnome 3 with catalyst for some reason ( works on desktop ), 
  spex :, 
  * amd a8-3520m + hd 6740g2, 
  * 8gb 1333mhz, 
  * 120gb kingston v300, 
  i think amd cards can do that with opencl , but no game has implemented it iirc . 
  i guess it 's only with new chipsets ? 
  r9 nano working fine here , on a h97 motherboard , also flashed the card 's bios to the new pure uefi one . 
  found some fluid simulation demo , i do n't know how good it is . 
  the original v300 's were good , i have one and it 's still alive with 99 % life left . 
  what was the typo ? 
  i 've had a lot of issues with games running on my 1440p monitor that 's on the left , instead of my main 4k monitor . 
  thanks for being awesome :p, 
  hey , at least we have the game ... 
  i have yet to try it on my r9 nano . 
  should work well on mesa drivers ? 
  i 'm fine with 320kb/s mp3 : i, 
  i tried to port it for my phone , failed :(, 
  how does one enable, 
  shame there are no demos nowadays . 
  biggest difference is made with getting proper headphones . 
  i went from tritton 720 + ( gift from dumbass brother ) to dt770 pro , they 're fucking amazing . 
  just let people do whatever they want with their body , and let natural selection do it 's thing . 
  not for big games : /, 
  went from a 290 to a nano . 
  not a huge jump , but an improvement nonetheless . 
  almost went for a 980 , but i decided it was n't worth it considering their bullshit . 
  better linux drivers would be nice though :(, 
  energy is quite cheap in finland . 
  i pay 5c/kwh . 
  just beyerdynamic dt770 pro and onboard audio , but it 's way better than what i had before lol, 
  yeah . 
  100w tdp reduction , and runs 20 \u00b0 c cooler . 
  and much better framerates at 4k . 
  thanks , got it working . 
  just had to go to dev settings :p, 
  oh well , these headphones sound really good to me even without a proper dac/amp . 
  i did plug it into the back panel though , to reduce noise . 
  ( and my front panel is busted lol ), 
  4k , 60hz crt would be a dream ... 
  xeons support more . 
  why such an old version ? 
  welp . 
  my experience with minecraft lately has been just stress testing shaderpacks . 
  maybe i 'll try 1.7.3 beta again . 
  3 times more fans as my r9 nano , so you get 3 times faster framerates ? 
  my 290 was otherwise good , but the cooler held it back : /, 
  damn you , msi . 
  i 'm afraid one has to pirate it . 
  my nh-d15 's fan idles at 200rpm , and goes up to 1000rpm ( can do 1500 though ), 
  it 's dead silent . 
  does n't have an unlocked bootloader iirc , but you can flash custom roms on it . 
  the infrared port is for controlling tv 's and shit , if you 're wondering ( not irda or whatever ), 
  another phone you could look at is oneplus 2 , has an 8-core cpu and 4gb of ram , and 64gb of storage . 
  also an unlocked bootloader . 
  mine still throttles with +50 % power and 100 % fan target : /, 
  i could buy one to use as a cuda card or as a dedicated card for a vm . 
  do a stress test and see if they ramp up . 
  i just use cm13 on my lg g2 + a custom kernel . 
  works alright , but i 'm gon na upgrade to a op2 at some point . 
  2400 hours in tf2 , keyboard still fine . 
  i still suck though . 
  card was usually running at 79 \u00b0 c or so ( below temp target of 85 \u00b0 c ) , throttling to 911mhz usually . 
  mine did n't . 
  90 \u00b0 c on full load , and fan was loud as balls :(, 
  still using the card . 
  might get a second one and just use them at stock settings . 
  define r4 with 4 140mm fans . 
  oh damn , i only have 24gb . 
  that 's why my chrome runs so slow . 
  you ca n't play r&c well in pcsx2 : /, 
  the hardware renderer is missing mipmapping , and the textures will look like poop . 
  i just bump up the internal resolution . 
  have to use 6x though , 8x lags . 
  if you keep waiting for new cards , you 're never gon na get a pc built . 
  just build a pc now . 
  8350 is a fine cpu . 
  qemu/kvm can . 
  yeah , and it just made it worse . 
  with factory paste it was 86 \u00b0 c. 
  yeah , it 's only supported on linux , but you can use any os in the vm itself . 
  hyper-v on windows can do it too though , i heard . 
  i do n't use catalyst . 
  everything i personally need is in crimson .
