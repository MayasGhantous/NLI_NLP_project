  2 ) upgraded that a bit , to 1gb and a pentium 4, 
  3 ) bought a used fx 5200, 
  4 ) my first modern hardware : phenom ii x3 710 , asus m5a78l-m lx ( secondhand from a schoolmate ), 
  5 ) ff 1 year , got stable income , upgraded to an fx-8320 , new 990x mobo , r9 270x, 
  6 ) upgraded more along the way , including an r9 290 , new monitor . 
  made a pc for my brother from the old parts, 
  7 ) `` upgraded '' to a xeon e3 last xmas , made no difference in framerates for me ( gpu bottleneck ) , r9 nano 3 months ago, 
  2x modern flagship cards for such a low resolution , talk about overkill . 
  use displayport then . 
  what difference does the bridge even make ? 
  thought the good ol' 2-way bridge works fine . 
  what the fuck, 
  i pay 25 $ / month for 150mb/s uncapped ... 
  i recommend moving to europe . 
  i disable automatic sleep mode . 
  i also never turn my pc off unless i go away for a day or more . 
  my life is as useless as the last 512mb of gtx 970 's memory pool . 
  xfx r9 390x is 430 $ in finland : /, 
  hitman at 1440p 60fps, 
  too weak eh ? 
  it 's amd , therefore shit / s, 
  amd is more forgiving , allows you to cf eith 4x pcie clit . 
  g602 only has 6 side buttons :(, 
  i see the problem . 
  fx-8350 on a motherboard that was not designed to handle it . 
  probably just too sensitive detection . 
  for the hard uninstall , that 's good because a virus ca n't remove it as easy . 
  yes , does work on dx10 cards . 
  the cables that came with my samsung and dell monitors work fine : /, 
  edit : sammy is uhd , dell is 1440p if it matters . 
  as a 4k monitor owner , i 've wanted hidpi support for a long time ... 
  oh ... only for samsung :(, 
  oh , prices dropped again . 
  why the downgrade ? 
  i3 is better , but the fx is cheaper and should play any game . 
  basically me , but with tf2 and minecraft, 
  this is pcmr , we can have silent mechs if we want to . 
  o-rings . 
  computers are weird . 
  i never got remixos installed , ca n't say anything about it . 
  android-x86 , used that on my old laptop for some time . 
  worked , but did n't have a pae kernel and it was slow ( installed on a usb stick ), 
  imo no . 
  i 've owned my 4k monitor for a year now , i can never go back to smaller resolutions ... not even 1440p , which is my secondary monitor 's res . 
  my gpu is n't really up to the task alone though , need to save for a second one :(, 
  humans are stubborn , and will use the service they 're used to unless there 's very good reasons to change . 
  you 're only the 718293471230th to post this . 
  my dad has been using ubuntu for almost 2 years now , not much problems . 
  there was one problem with upgrading from 14.04 to 15.10 , but i was there and fixed it . 
  apart from that , smooth sailing . 
  even his 3g internet stick works fine . 
  rx or gtx ? 
  was a joke . 
  saying `` 480 '' is gon na confuse a lot of people :p, 
  i went from a 270x to a 290 when the 390 was n't released yet . 
  used it for a bit over a year , was alright except the cooler sucked . 
  how does one see his subreddit-specific karma ? 
  i 've had this too sometimes . 
  i only have an older acer aspire ; - ;, 
  it 's decent though . 
  amd a8-3520m , 8gb ram , radeon hd 6740g2 which i ca n't use on linux , 120gb ssd . 
  no driver issues with anything . 
  then there 's me , only using fxaa, 
  afterburner works fine for me . 
  lol not what i meant, 
  the cooler was loud as fuck , and inadequate for a 290 . 
  msi twinfrozr iv btw . 
  there is one popular game made with torque 3d ; beamng.drive . 
  shame it 's not on linux yet : /, 
  thanks . 
  used reddit for 3 years , never knew about this :d, 
  msi 290 has a shit cooler and shit paste . 
  so loud and hot ; - ;, 
  are there linux laptops with fin/swe keyboard layout ? 
  says the guy with no amd hardware c :, 
  yes , fglrx is fucking terrible . 
  radeonsi and amdgpu ( - pro ) work much better , although the performance is n't there yet . 
  xset m 1 1, 
  some people hate mouse acceleration because the movement is n't 1:1 . 
  but how do we let fresh air and sunlight in our rooms then ? 
  shows that they do n't discriminate . 
  maybe they 'll take an autist like me too ? 
  the one on the left looks like it should easily fit inside a 15 '' laptop ... 
  killing floor 2 vr hype, 
  could n't care less , trying to migrate to linux . 
  forza might slow me down though ... :(, 
  yeah ... 
  i mean , they already have your cc info . 
  / r/linuxmasterrace, 
  keylogger inside windows . 
  it 's closed source , what do you think ? 
  dunno about win7 . 
  but it 's ms. . . who knows . 
  i really wan na play that killing floor vr game tho ... ; - ;, 
  what specs will it have ? 
  if it 's the same 36 cu polaris card as in ps4k , i do n't see why it would n't play games at 4k low-medium at least . 
  forza might slow down my already sluggish migration to linux ... ; - ;, 
  like what downsides ? 
  what else is there ? 
  dirt rally legend edition ( or whatever it 's called ) physical copy is 30 $ for pc , 48 $ for consoles in finland ...
