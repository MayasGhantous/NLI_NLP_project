  my friend played war thunder at 15 fps for a long time , although i thought a gtx 650 could do better lol, 
  20-35 fps on ultra *, 
  not everyone needs ultra settings , remember . 
  can confirm msaa is useless at 4k, 
  imo fxaa looks fine at 1440p and over, 
  why os x , if i may ask ? 
  i say go 4k . 
  on 6-man hoe ? 
  m99 is also a 17 year old gun , horzine railgun is probably brand new made from modern materials . 
  i go with rllll, 
  meh i guess it can come handy sometimes, 
  no u, 
  firebug or commando i think, 
  although i 've had the most kills in a match with demolitions , medic , and gunslinger too lol, 
  what ? 
  at least in gta v it looks as good as 2x msaa with no fps drop, 
  i think it 's the opposite . 
  looks like shit at 1080p , but alright at 1440p or 4k, 
  i 'd personally go for linux instead . 
  yes, 
  it does set it to 60hz by default , but all major des support 144hz . 
  i did have issues in plasma 5 though , the ui ran at 60hz unless i turned off effects with alt + shift + f12, 
  well fxaa vs no aa , fxaa is better in my opinion . 
  and of course this is subject to personal opinion . 
  fury x for 1440p or 4k, 
  his pc is custom watercooled . 
  aio would make zero sense . 
  update drivers to 16.12.2 , open up wattman , bump up the clockspeed of state 7 until it crashes , then voltage until it 's somewhat stable , continue until temps get too high . 
  or if you 're running older drivers ( some refuse to update ) , install msi afterburner . 
  freesync is n't a resolution , it 's a new-ish technology that allows your monitor refresh rate to sync with your gpu framerate . 
  basically reverse vsync ( ? ), 
  without the input lag lol, 
  and it can work on any monitor of any resolution , as long as the controller supports it . 
  well sli is kinda needed , a single 970 probably ca n't play this at 1440p ... 
  both need to support it . 
  you need an amd gpu , gcn 1.1 or newer ( r9 290x is fine ), 
  just look for a monitor that says freesync or adaptive-sync, 
  someone with sli gtx 970 is probably used to ultra settings though . 
  uninstall that crap and use relive instead, 
  does shadowplay even support hevc ? 
  that 's the name for their encoder , but which formats does it save as ? 
  only h264 ( avc ) ? 
  rip , relive supports hevc on polaris, 
  * tips your distro *, 
  64gb ram and still using quadcore trash ? 
  i had a scrollbar when i had a 4k monitor . 
  shine 5 ? 
  i have an older shine 3 , with mx blues, 
  sometimes slow internet causes it . 
  i think better ergonomics for fps players ? 
  it 's running on linux , and there 's no background bloatware, 
  they store everything in the cloud , does n't matter much . 
  real mice have balls, 
  the only bad part about 144hz is that you can never use 60hz again, 
  anyone know where to get an affordable laptop with 120hz screen ? 
  dude the 2500k is still good . 
  overclock it and it can easily keep up with a 6600k, 
  m99 , but without the expensive ammo, 
  me and friends carried my brother on suicidal , he was lvl 1 commando when he started lol, 
   it also works on linux now . 
  i could n't get it to work : /, 
  i tried the proprietary driver , and also an open source driver version that supposedly supports it ( linux-amd-staging 4.7 ) , neither worked . 
  4.8 , could n't find a 4.4 kernel to install, 
  some people told me it works on that staging kernel with open drivers . 
  wow , lying cucks . 
  same, 
  1440p 144hz ips with freesync is awesome, 
  if they dump their dosh and guns , fine by me . 
  well there exists a precompiled version of the kernel ... 
  this is what bothers me ... people tell me i ca n't run 1440p 144hz with a nano , but i 'm personally fine with 60 fps in singleplayer games ... 
  2500k overclocks really well because the ihs is soldered + 32nm, 
  i think 70c max ? 
  if you need a good silent cooler , get a noctua nh-d15, 
  somewhere in between 1080p and 4k . 
  i had both . 
  nh-d15 best cooler, 
  most games still run very well on amd, 
  have n't had it break in any game . 
  only games where freesync does n't work are ones where it did n't work on older drivers either . 
  i wish someone made a racing simulator in unreal engine 4 . 
  huh ? 
  runs on ultra 1440p for me, 
  the capabilities of ue4 are fucking amazing . 
  sometimes i just love to look at tech demos and people making maps in it lol, 
  one could always have an old turd of a pc to test every usb stick on, 
  why does the audio sound so bad, 
  in the current beta , i 've had zeds spaghettify when i shoot them with the nailgun lol, 
  particularly bloats and gorefiends, 
  mouse and headphones/headset yes , keyboard i would recommend you still get wired . 
  g403 wireless can easily last a day of use , just remember to plug it in every night . 
  why not ? 
  moar graphics, 
  a mod that should be built-in, 
  my brother has a similar one , could n't fit a hdd to the spot where it 's supposed to go . 
  well i sold mine off for 250 $ : i, 
  well mine 's not a 1070 and can do 1440p ultra : i, 
  getting 45-60fps in witcher 3, 
  uhh ... do n't know : i, 
  i 'm guessing that only the hub breaks if you 're lucky . 
  low end 1060 's are cheaper than low end 480 's,
