  but gives almost no performance increase , because nvidia 's opengl driver is well optimized . 
  why not buy them all from the same manufacturer so you do n't have to have 20 million different applications running ? 
  logitech masterrace, 
  in sound quality yes , but i 've been thinking of getting a g933 just because i like the freedom of wireless . 
  i have beyerdynamic dt770 pro atm , with an smsl m3, 
  shame steamos never took off . 
  get x99 , no fear of plugging in video to the motherboard . 
  i did the opposite . 
  i used a 4k monitor with an r9 290 lmao, 
  my friend with an nvme ssd said that the difference is huge on linux but not on windows . 
  i have a gpu that 's equivalent to yours , it can handle 1440p fine , even at 144hz . 
  and please do n't call it 2k . 
  2k is 2048x1080, 
  i 'm not paying extra for a cpu that has only 5-10 % more ipc and half the cores, 
  i sold my only 4k monitor : /, 
  i need a hecking wheelstand tho, 
  g27 bang for buck masterrace, 
  pga478 , nothing of value will be lost . 
  no good cpus existed in this socket . 
  he is using a desktop oriented distro , for mainly gaming and browsing . 
  moms always throw away your stuff without telling about it . 
  mine threw away my old logitech racing wheel that still worked fine ... my brother did n't use it much tho . 
  nah fam , overclocking headroom, 
  i recommend highend aircoolers , like nh-d15 or dark rock pro 3 . 
  more quiet , reliable , and can handle overclocking just as well as 240mm aios, 
  is vr worth it yet ? 
  i want a rift but it 's like 700 $, 
  well i do n't have an nvme drive myself , and i do n't know anyone else 's experience , so i 'm just gon na believe him . 
  personally i think medic gl would be extremely useful in servers with raised player cap ( like 12 or 32 players ), 
  might be recorder settings . 
  what software are you using ? 
  i managed to save a player in a situation like this on suicidal . 
  like opengl but better . 
  holy shit i 'd love if assetto corsa ran on linux someday, 
  i think equivalent but cheaper hardware would be a good reason ? 
  do you have an amd graphics card ? 
  if you do , i recommend you uninstall that crap and update your drivers to 16.12.2 , it has a feature that 's kinda like shadowplay . 
  the driver sucks . 
  i 've been in lobbies with hackers tons of times , never banned . 
  same case here , only have to clean the filters on mine like every 3 months or whenever i can be arsed . 
  inside has a tiny bit of dust but not enough for me to bother cleaning it . 
  punctuation takes skill, 
  g900 best mouse, 
  i think my g900 is fine for browsing, 
  8.1 is good dude, 
  it 's useful in games where you do n't really need high fps , like the witcher 3 . 
  mine runs at 45-60 fps and it 's fine for me . 
  more pcie lanes, 
  i really wan na get a 6800k , but i 'm gon na wait and see if amd ryzen will be good . 
  well i do n't edit video or anything . 
  i just game and browse , but i 've played around with some game engines , might try and make some simple games . 
  mic wo n't help if one has an extreme case of anxiety . 
  red devil has shitty vrms , do n't overclock it much or at all . 
  well yeah . 
  i 'm pretty much the same . 
  as you gain xp , you get to choose what to get . 
  damage bonus , hp , armor , you name it . 
  it 's loud . 
  how well does the mg279q work at 57-144hz ? 
  i only tried mine at 60-144 . 
  not that much . 
  i recommend getting a 1440p monitor if you get a fury . 
  one thing i loved about my fx-8320 was that i could compile something and watch 1080p youtube in chrome at the same time . 
  all cores maxed and it did n't even break a sweat . 
  it 's not dead . 
  they resurrected it and called it vulkan . 
  did it work ? 
  rip, 
  i did like 5 levels and got stuck, 
  am disgrace to famiry, 
  beats my laptop with 168 cb, 
  i 've had mine for over a year . 
  it 's great , i can sit for hours without asspain . 
  imo it 's loud . 
  thanks, 
  what was the previous gpu ? 
  some amd ? 
  killing floor 2 is n't that demanding . 
  i 'm running it at 100-150 fps with a less powerful gpu, 
  ca n't you host yourself ? 
  tell them you save money in the long run with free online and cheaper games . 
  the 120hz . 
  you do n't need a 1070 in a laptop . 
  60hz is not enjoyable, 
  still , from these options 120hz gsync with a 1060 is the better option imo . 
  me too . 
  one of my most played games . 
  i tried getting it working too , but it just errors . 
  command is ` xrandr -- output displayport-x -- set `` freesync '' 1 `, 
  no , it 's a decent cpu still . 
  if you 're worried , overclock it and/or get a used i7-2600k, 
  he is running the amdgpu-pro driver . 
  you can tell from the ` opengl renderer string ` , on pro it 's the actual name , on open source it 's something like ` gallium 0.4 on amd fiji ( drm 3.9.0 / 4.9.0-1-amd-staging , llvm 3.9.1 ) ` ( my pc ), 
  i understand your confusion , because they share the same kernel module . 
  for some reason i 've had it on my spare phone for a while , but not my main .
