  me waiting for ryzen, 
  sell them all and buy a g900, 
  2k exists . 
  rx 460 can run it at 1080p high , 30fps, 
  i got a voodoo ii beat that, 
  might wan na use a usb stick to install it . 
  might be useful on my potato laptop, 
  fuck , need to find my invoice ... 
  i 've seen some people get downgraded to 16.6 when they 're on 16.11, 
  how is opengapps legal then, 
  if aesthetics and case size is n't an issue , i highly recommend you go for an aircooler instead . 
  noctua nh-u14s or u12 would be about equivalent to a 120mm aio , nh-d14 or d15 equivalent to a 240mm, 
  nothing near me ... : /, 
  oh well , i 'm probably not competent anyway . 
  you do n't need comparisons . 
  it 's fucking worth it . 
  take my word for it . 
  i just hope we can get that drm on linux too ... 
  official arch package when ? 
  at least take out the cpu cooler and gpu when you ship it . 
  i would n't be surprised if the rx 480 claim became true . 
  glorious gcn with finewine \u2122 technology, 
  stop cpu abuse :'(, 
  asus version of raspi ? 
  never heard of this until now lol, 
  meh , processor bitness should n't matter much , as all arm oss still support 32-bit . 
  you can run 4-way on pascal . 
  one guy in a facebook pc group had 4x gtx 1080 , games ran fine . 
  when nvidia still requires these useless bridges when competition has better scaling without them, 
  i could go for some turkish peppers rn . 
  god i love that candy . 
  lol , i 've ordered 2.2 kg boxes from a local candy shop sometimes . 
  pls send help , i 'm addicted, 
  maybe apus ? 
  shame the windmill demo does n't support lfc ... 
  my range is 60-144 , it only lets me put framerate to 60 . 
  it 's been buggy since 16.12.1 . 
  starting from that driver , fs has randomly broken for me , reboot fixed it always tho . 
  i 've had that , solution was to reboot when it happened . 
  just 2x works , 2.5 x is official recommendation . 
  i think most gpus have as much l2 cache as this game needs ... 
  better safe than sorry, 
  never had to watch ads . _ . 
  only seen some banner ads after a game . 
  aaaaaaaaa thank you < 3, 
  never heard of a glorious finewine \u2122 gpu exploding, 
  does it taste like lies and gimping ? 
  nope . 
  probably someone using your connection . 
  so do n't use badly coded software ? 
  fire axe was even in the original mod ... ( did n't play it , but heard ), 
  why is it not in kf2 officially ? 
  you only get more fps if the game actually requires more vram . 
  if it 's using 4gb , there will be no difference between a 4 gig and an 8 gig card . 
  lot of games can scale dynamically tho , using more when available , but still perform fine with low vram cards . 
  vram amount is n't the only thing that determines how fast a gpu is . 
  type , speed , bus width and the core itself have an effect too . 
  4gb r9 fury spanks a 8gb rx 480 easily . 
  i 'm gay , but what the fuck is this, 
  shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit , awesome that it works . 
  do n't have to reboot to windows when my friend wants to play it with me lmao, 
  gon na see how well it runs when i can be arsed to install it . 
  with latest drivers , the rx 480 is a tiny bit faster than gtx 1060 . 
  if amd continues with improving drivers , it should be 10-20 % faster than 1060 by 2 years . 
  audio is weird on linux ... 
  for some reason , some games set my usb dac to 48k sample rate when i set it to 96k by default , and i have no idea how to fix it ... 
  amd drivers are the only thing that 's keeping me on windows : /, 
  both . 
  afaik the 380 comes close to the 970 now . 
  we should just ditch everything and use pure alsa . 
  that 's a waste of money lmao, 
  you coulda refunded or hidden it from library, 
  i 'm just wondering why there are official nightlies for lg g2 mini , but not the normal g2 ... 
  oh well , built it myself and seems to work fine . 
  wifi bug is gone too . 
  yup , i 've seen them for like a month in some videos . 
  i had a similar msi r9 290 , changing thermal paste made it worse ... 
  maybe i fucked up though . 
  never got it to run under 80c . 
  because everyone 's gay today . 
  nvidia codeworks installer somehow selected the root of my d drive as the install dir , i went and ran the uninstall script to reinstall it to a proper folder . 
  did n't check the generated script properly , almost wiped my d drive with almost all of my stuff . 
  communist propaganda ? 
  but think about this :, 
  if you refunded them , you could have gotten extra money to buy more linux games . 
  i snorted cocaine, 
  wait what, 
  tfw i know the admin of the page, 
  tbh they should include it in all monitors, 
  like rotr ? 
  there was a benchmark result that a fury gpu can swap to system ram without any fps loss, 
  does it monitor ass ? 
  i went the other route , bought wireless, 
  never had issues like that tho, 
  plays anything just fine . 
  even witcher 3 on high at 30fps, 
  well , amd zen might cause intel to release something ... 
  hope we 'll get cheap low-end 4c/4t sr3 cpus . 
  still impressive for such a low-end card .
