  may i have a moment to talk about our lord and savior , linus torvalds ? 
  wait , only incursion will have a story mode ? 
  it depends on the person though . 
  teleportation is the safest option , but something like touchpad control might be fine for others . 
  linux has gained a lot of games though , i 'm hoping we can ditch windows completely soon . 
  if people blame you for their death , tell them this :, 
  no difference anyway . 
  but you ca n't notice a difference between a high quality mp3 and flac anyway . 
  i have decent equipment , but i still ca n't notice any difference between 320kb/s mp3 and flac . 
  ( although 16-bit flac ), 
  is it the genre then ? 
  i only tried metal . 
  rift [ seems to work ] ( https://appdb.winehq.org/objectmanager.php?sclass=version&amp;iid=22884 ), 
  i know for a fact that skyrim works , but mods might be an issue . 
  not sure about special edition . 
  warframe [ kinda works ] ( https://appdb.winehq.org/objectmanager.php?sclass=version&amp;iid=29230 ), 
  wine can be finicky at times though . 
  there 's also a game launcher called lutris that can make this easier . 
  not a genre i care about , so not really relevant to me . 
  gon na believe you tho . 
  you like ads then ? 
  yup , but we did n't bother repairing it back then : /, 
  i knew about the battery trick but did n't know how to do it and did n't have a sacrificial one . 
  meh , i might just get a gpd win . 
  or that other handheld pc that was on kickstarter , forgot the name . 
  i could n't . 
  wine has advanced a lot since version 2.0 , jeez . 
  hope i can run killing floor 2 soon , as it 's really the only game i like right now lol, 
  funny how people who do n't own ryzen claim they 're shitty , but people who actually started using them daily say they play games much smoother . 
  why ca n't my ddr4 ram just arrive already ... 
  i have decent headphones and a fine dac , ca n't tell a difference . 
  caseking in germany and some uk store do it too . 
  i love how the only way to fix windows is to reinstall it . 
  i have never had to reinstall linux to fix it . 
  not even when the root partition is corrupted . 
  fsck always fixed it . 
  i have good equipment , not sure about my ears . 
  guess i 'll have to buy a vr headset ... hope it works with revive because i 'm not buying an oculus . 
  beyerdynamic dt770 pro and smsl m3, 
  i recently tried the vulkan renderer and it was much smoother than opengl . 
  i still prefer fullscreen , as latency is slightly lower and i have a single monitor anyway lol, 
  if kf2 supported sprays like source games did , this is what i 'd use . 
  firebug with the mwg can be good though . 
  can easily finish off a failed takedown on a big zed . 
  but they ca n't make working blinkers gg, 
  it 's grease leaking from vrm thermal pads most likely . 
  should be harmless . 
  i doubt a brand new mobo has capacitor leaks . 
  one upgraded from a 4790k, 
  it 's still subpar in performance . 
  980ti runs it at 60 fps on lowest settings at 1080p, 
  i thought the stock soc voltage is 1v, 
  i do n't think any game lets you put anisotropy over 16x, 
  facebook tech groups are the worst right now . 
  everyone 's an intel fanboy . 
  2 1080ti 's ca n't run crysis 3 maxed out at 4k 60 fps . 
  it 's crazy . 
  you can , but :, 
  it 's difficult , and not worth it . 
  g900 best mouse, 
  at what settings ? 
  low-medium , an r9 390 is enough . 
  smsl m3 is a great dac . 
  so i should be fine with my 144hz monitor . 
  i 'd love 1440p hdr 144hz with a 40-144hz freesync range : <, 
  afaik that 's against ms eula . 
  it does both very well . 
  only works on wifi, 
  msaa in gta hates amd cards , anisotropy has no impact on performance . 
  still better than ps3, 
  because it 's the best browser for youtube, 
  `` ultra settings at 2k '', 
  so you own a 2048x1080 monitor then ? 
  because that 's 2k . 
  but how, 
  just saying . 
  i personally do n't care lol, 
  freesync too, 
  the fps overlay once crashed a game and it glitched so it used 100 % gpu even when it was closed, 
  time to upgrade to a g900 then, 
  why would it have vulkan drivers, 
  all amd chips look like that , idk why, 
  what prevents linux users from playing aaa titles ? 
  tbh vm is still running it on windows . 
  it 's more convenient to use , less convenient to set up . 
  linux masterrace, 
  i think scores should be higher if you test on a newer kernel like 4.10 or 4.11 . 
  i 'll test once i get my goddamn ram . 
  i 'm hoping we get more linux native games . 
  that 's why good people like feral interactive exist , to do the job for them . 
  and they 've done a damn good job . 
  my windows score : https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/146964, 
  my linux score : https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/2132486, 
  windows score is kinda old though . 
  they recently ported dirt rally . 
  it runs almost as well on linux as on windows . 
  [ bench on windows ] ( http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/91600296833952916/126ba0d6a6f9741e2093ec38d6bedcba6d0586eb/ ), 
  [ bench on linux ] ( http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/91601432632882259/880ca19a6fbef56c8c51a7d96b466f83baed5bee/ ), 
  edit : this is on an amd card btw, 
  another edit : linux drivers are fucking great , recent update halved my fps .
