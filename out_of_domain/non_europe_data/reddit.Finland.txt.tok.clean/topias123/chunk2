  just remember : never defrag an ssd , it puts unnecessary wear on it , even though modern ones last a lot longer than older ones, 
  vlc master race, 
  ethernet ftw, 
  i bought one of those bundles , did n't really like 'em, 
  arr , set sails to pirate bay . 
  jk , to the linux sea . 
  happened to me a lotta times , mostly when i update my drivers and forget to reboot, 
  i can see enthusiasts getting those , but my mom really just needs a replacement for her core2duo , 2gb ram , integrated sis gpu pos laptop, 
  you can hack on consoles you know , my dad 's new wife 's kids hacked on mw3 , hope those little brats got banned, 
  the pics load really slow for me for some reason, 
  i have already made a list , but she has no money atm . 
  what do you think ? 
  http://pcpartpicker.com/p/3jxfbv ( left the operating system out , because i will most likely install ubuntu on it . 
  if not , `` legit '' windows 7 , like i did on her laptop ), 
  it 's the ultimate peasant experience, 
  should play on ultra , but i 'd build one myself, 
  [ my humble pc ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/user/topias123/saved/n7rgxl ), 
  ok , thanks . 
  i might also add a video card from my spares . 
  surely a 9600gt beats intel integrated graphics . 
  she 's not going to play games , i thought of adding the card for video decoding performance, 
  if you 're going to use windows 8.1 , it 's going to do most stuff for you ( blocking defrag , enabling trim ) . 
  also before you install the os , make sure ahci is on from the bios/uefi . 
  also turn off file indexing ( meant to speed up file search on mechanical hard drives , not useful on ssds ) . 
  if you can , move the [ `` paging '' ] ( https://superuser.com/questions/237813/how-can-i-move-the-page-file-to-another-physical-disk-location ) file to a mechanical storage drive . 
  that cooler can be a bit hard to install for a first-time builder , and the stock is enough, 
  vending machine drinks here cost like 3 $ ( 4 usd ), 
  maybe , but i hope amd keeps making desktop cpus too, 
  how dare you compare such a wonderful substance like shit to something like mcafee, 
  you can get an on-screen temperature reading with msi afterburner, 
  you might need to modify the video bios , but i do n't recommend it because there 's a risk of bricking the card, 
  2x msaa is enough at 1080p imo , so at 4k i do n't think anyone needs any kind of aa, 
  but i still hope that they atleast do n't go bankrupt . 
  the last thing we need is intel monopoly, 
  i myself have one of the early zacate apus ( e-450 , hd 6320 ) , and it 's absolute shit . 
  even on arch linux with all kinds of optimizations i can possibly apply it still lags . 
  have you tried checking the default save location ? 
  by default it 's c : \\ users \\ < yourusername  \\ videos \\ raptr, 
  you can easily play source games ( css , tf2 , gmod ) , idk about others . 
  tf2 is plenty fun tho, 
  i thought about watercooling too , but i do n't know if i should go with an aio or a custom loop . 
  never done any watercooling . 
  my case has a spot for a 240mm radiator ( or a slim 280mm ), 
  which apu would you suggest ? 
  it needs to be a laptop that can handle 30 + chrome tabs without lagging ( my current can barely handle 3 despite having 8gb ram ), 
  my local pc hardware stores do n't have that model , would an h100i do the job ? 
  ok , thanks . 
  i wo n't be able to get it right now because i 'm going on vacation , but i 'll get it at some point . 
  should , but not on best graphics, 
  agp ftw, 
  i 'm in a kind of a budget , and i do n't play on laptops anyway , so is [ a4-4300m ] ( http://www.notebookcheck.net/review-hp-probook-455-g1-h6p57ea-notebook.109437.0.html ) any good ? 
  if you count [ an amd hackintosh ] ( http://www.niresh.co/files/file/75-niresh-mavericks-for-intel-and-amd/ ) , then yes ( do n't judge me , mavericks is cool ), 
  on android 4.2.2 and later you can force 4x msaa on . 
  looks glorious , but does n't work with all games unfortunately, 
  i have [ this ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/fractal-design-power-supply-fdpsuts2b650w ) psu , works perfectly with the same cpu and a 270x . 
  also , get a better motherboard , maybe [ this one ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-m5a99xevor20 ) , i have one and it 's very good, 
  i 'm ok with anything that 's better than the shit e-series, 
  safe temperatures depend on your hardware , check manufacturer website or google it for more info . 
  it does n't require coding knowledge , there are ready [ tools ] ( http://www.techpowerup.com/rbe/ ) . 
  just do n't go crazy , ok ? 
  edit : your card is not mentioned on the official compatibility list , but they mention it 's worth a shot even if it is n't, 
  as long as it handles web browsing and 1080p video decoding , it 's ok . that 's all i use my laptop for . 
  desktops are for gaming, 
  do n't try to be desperately funny ( like pewdiepie ), 
  is n't af120 meant to be a case fan , not a cpu fan ? 
  well yeah , laptops have a lot better mobility comparing to huge desktops . 
  clean your graphics card cooler , update drivers and verify game cache integrity, 
  start streaming and hope people like watching it, 
  you do if you wan na play ubisoft games, 
  graphics card is the most important piece of hardware when it comes to gaming . 
  4gb ram and an i3 are enough if you have decent graphics, 
  go for an 8320 , it 's the same chip but .5 ghz lower clock . 
  it can be easily overclocked to same speeds, 
  macbook pro = 1000 $ farmville machine, 
  go for a similarly priced gaming laptop, 
  oh god ... 
  i pay 30 $ for 100/10 mbit/s . 
  but i live in helsinki , finland so it 's normal, 
  you can save a couple of bucks by changing the motherboard to an asus m5a99x evo , which is the same as that one but second pcie slot is 8x . 
  also get an fx 8320 , it 's the same as 8350 but slightly lower clock speed, 
  i have a 120gb ssd for windows and a 2tb hdd for games and stuff . 
  [ i love living in helsinki ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3608641010.png ), 
  tf2 - 258hrs, 
  gmod - 131hrs, 
  i got :, 
  440fps on lowest, 
  130fps on maxed, 
  choose one, 
  i have heard of people just scrapping the heatspreader , do n't know how it affects temps, 
  you think the psu can handle that ? 
  i did n't put it on the specs , it has a cooler master b500 , which is a budget 500w psu . 
  yes it has 2 6 +2 pin pcie power but i 'm afraid it gives up if i try to install anything more power-hungry . _ . 
  also because the case is old , it has crappy airflow ( i have only 1 80mm fan installed on the back , and i used a l.n.a to limit it 's noise ) , which is also a limiting factor . 
  i might have to get some budget case for him, 
  i found a club3d hd 7750 for quite cheap nearby , should i get that one for him ? 
  i do n't think he needs more power, 
  ah , also hdmi is a must . 
  i checked on ebay and found a [ powercolor model ] ( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/powercolor-amd-ati-radeon-hd-6950-ax6950-1gbd5-2dh-1-gb-gddr5-video-card-gpu-/151347090689?pt=pcc_video_tv_cards&amp;hash=item233cfd5501 ) that has it , should i get that ? 
  i myself have an r9 270x , did n't know you can get a slower model so cheap : /, 
  they 're on my flair,
