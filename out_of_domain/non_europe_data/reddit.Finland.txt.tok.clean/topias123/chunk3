  fx-8320@4ghz, 8gb 1600mhz cl9 ram , r9 270x from asus, 
  i do n't have optifine installed even . _ . 
  the level of bloom is over nine thousaaaand, 
  i thought about this and i 'll just get a hd 7750 from a nearby store , the hd 6950 's shipment cost is just too high . 
  plus i rarely buy stuff from ebay , so i do n't really trust them, 
  i think it 's because of amd 's shitty per-core performance , and minecraft is quite cpu heavy , but still not very well optimized for multicore, 
  but the sp120 is similarly priced , so should n't i just get one of those ? 
  well i do n't think he 's going to play anything too intensive ... 
  he has the counter strike pack , minecraft and tf2 . 
  also , as i said , his tv is only 1366x768, 
  yeah , i have 4 120mm fans . 
  1 on the front , 1 on the bottom , 1 rear , 1 top . 
  my cpu is clocked at 4ghz on stock voltage , amd turbo core is off, 
  amd really needs to get their shit together and stop fucking around with apus, 
  `` pc holding back next-gen potential '', 
  i cool mine with ln2, 
  i went with non-modular , since i use all of the cables, 
  11,5 megabytes/s max , upload about 1 megabyte/s, 
  no , only similar or identical cards can be xfired ( example : 7970 +7950 ), 
  i really hope polyphony decides to scrap the ps4 and make the next one for pc . 
  imagine the possibilities o_o even if the next one is for potatostation , i hope they do n't fuck it up, 
  try overvolting or underclocking it slightly . 
  you can send it to me , i 'm building a pc for my brother and he would appreciate it , 
  as the other guy said , always in the bios/uefi . 
  graphics cards have to be overclocked via software though, 
  there 's an option in portal 2 to enable v-sync with 30 fps limit , but it 's meant for laptops to save power, 
  [ bullshit ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=minecraft+shaders&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gia6u7-rbcxjywoowohgcw&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979 ), 
  gtx 780 maybe ? 
  i have [ these ] ( http://www.amazon.com/turtle-beach-force-gaming-headset/dp/b006w41w7s/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top ) , they 're fine, 
  i use my desktop for everything when i 'm at home , and phone on the go ( i do n't wan na use my laggy laptop that has a shittier screen and battery than my phone ), 
  just shaders for now . 
  ultra edition , of course, 
  i have never used crossfire or sli , so do n't know for sure . 
  i think there was a compatibility chart from amd somewhere, 
  i 'm running on 1.7.2 , because i could n't get newer versions working, 
  crafters be trippin ', 
  agreed . 
  i myself ca n't stand framerates lower than 45, 
  i started my ascend about 2 years ago , i wish i knew about the glory of pc before : c, 
  specs say it has 1 16x pcie , but only a 300w psu . 
  without changing the psu , i 'd recommend a 750ti . 
  i like to play tf2 on an [ uberupgrades ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/uberupgradesmod ) server when i 'm bored , it takes the skill-based combat and replaces it with an unholy spamfest . 
  then the mod breaks and we need to change map , which resets upgrades, 
  i do n't think the next-gen consoles run it ... 
  [ these ] ( http://3minecraft.com/sonic-ethers-unbelievable-shaders-mod/ ), 
  to me , 60hz is plenty . 
  i have another monitor capable of 75hz tho , but it has shit resolution, 
  i also use the shaders mod , and it can really eat my fps on long render distances ( i get about 25 on far ), 
  it depends on the game , one heavily cpu-bound games ( assuming they know how to use 8 threads ) , [ amd beats intel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4et7kdgsrfc ), 
  i liked the page 4 teh gigglez, 
  remember to remove manufacturer bloatware, 
  the only thing the potato versions have better than mobile is controls . 
  i ca n't use the damn touchscreen for minecraft , and i have no idea how to get my x360 controller working on my g2, 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/george-w-bush.jpeg ) bush ? 
  half an hour ? 
  took me 1 minute, 
  single r9 270x here , i still play source games, 
  [ hmm ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qkcjf4fops&amp;feature=kp ), 
  nice choice , i got the asus model of the same gpu, 
  i had the same power supply . 
  i bought a new one because it made a weird noise , like the fan was outta balance . 
  the noise was n't bad tho , but the rest of my system is completely silent and it bothered me during nights, 
  i have a question about sweetfx : can it trigger vac on secured games ? 
  like if i use it on tf2 , will i get banned in 2 weeks ? 
  i 've heard of people getting banned because of it . 
  are you going to code your own engine or use an existing one ? 
  hyper 212 is quite hard to install , but it 's a very good budget cooler and totally worth the effort, 
  to me , 24.64167890275604506835965764358765897 fps is perfect, 
  get a better graphics card first, 
  i always put my pc to sleep mode, 
  nothing is perfect , even ~ ~ god 's ~ ~ ** gaben 's ** creations, 
  glorious minecraft shaders . 
  how 's your framerate btw ? 
  and what render distance ? 
  i get 24fps on far, 
  ah , that 'll make multiplatform porting a lot easier then . 
  also development . 
  i ca n't really help you with it , except be a beta tester, 
  why does it remind me of [ paasikivi ] ( http://www.urhoklubi.net/images/historia/presidentit/paasikivi.jpg ) , one of the previous presidents of finland, 
  yes you do , keyboards and gamepads are terrible, 
  solution : teach them how to use ubuntu, 
  macrohard disabled the f8 method on windows 8 , because `` modern pcs boot so fast , there 's no time to press a key '' . 
  the only way to get to safe mode is through some weird menus . 
  why is this bullshit ? 
  once my graphics card drivers broke , and i could n't boot to windows . 
  i had to fiddle around for 6 hours to get my pc working again . 
  on windows 7 it would have been over in 10 minutes, 
  i did , but none of the games and emulators recognized it . 
  the otg cable works , tried it with a flash drive , a mouse , a keyboard , and even all of those simultaneously via a hub , every case worked . 
  could it be that my controller is wireless ? 
  i have the adapter , and it works on my pc . 
  also : i 'm using cyanogenmod on my phone , and the phone recognizes the adapter ( lsusb on terminal emulator ), 
  edit : lsusb recognizes 2 device id 's , `` 1d6b :0002 '' and `` 1d6b :0003 '', 
  [ have this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2a2n0v/skyrim_17408x4750_screenshot/ ), 
  cyanogenmod 11 m7 ( 4.4.2 ) , the controller is the one that came with my potatobox 360 ( got it for free ) . 
  not sure about the wireless adapter , but it works with official windows drivers on my pc , and with the included drivers on ubuntu, 
  i figured it out myself without videos, 
  i connected the adapter via a powered 7-port usb hub , and it recognized it ... do n't know why , still does n't work in games or emulators tho, 
  no , it 's a wireless controller , and i 'm using a [ supported adapter ] ( http://www.amazon.com/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows/dp/b000hzfct2 ) . 
  it does work on both windows and linux , and my phone recognises it , but android games do n't,
