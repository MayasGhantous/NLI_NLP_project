  i already told you , 4.4.2, 
  did n't work for me, 
  well you already have one on your desk/racing chair/whatever so no need to show a second one on screen, 
  i 'm already using msi afterburner osd on games , which uses similar methods as sweetfx , so idk, 
  it 's like the fan blade is scraping on something , but it 's a very silent sound so not that annoying, 
  how does a goddamn graphics card need as much ram as my cpu ? 
  whoa , never knew the nether looks so pretty with bloom effect o_o, 
  why do you need it ? 
  i 'm fine with dvi lol ... 
  i still have one of those , they 're pretty good , even though all my friend say they 're shit . 
  the cable insulation is broken tho, 
  the detachable mic was the best part . 
  what is this `` objest '' you 're talking about ? 
  i ca n't even remember the specs of the pc ... 
  it has been 10 years since i have last seen it . 
  since then i have been a peasant , until 2 years ago when i got an old desktop as a donation . 
  it was quite slow , but i got some other desktops , and salvaged parts here and there and got myself a little retro gaming pc . 
  about half a year ago i got a bit more modern parts , secondhand from a friend . 
  that 's what really got me into pc again, 
  i got 5,370 on fire strike, 
  [ thanks dad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/midtown_madness_2_coverart.png ), 
  it has been slow as fuck opening for me , sometimes i have to wait minutes for it to open , but never failed to open, 
  shittier kernel/cli is a good thing ? 
  why ? 
  dat anti-aliasing ... oh wait, 
  got ta love dat [ double d ] ( http://forums.crackberry.com/attachments/general-blackberry-discussion-f2/265633d1398430443t-i-smell-conspiracy-300_2270082.png ), 
  imagine if ubisoft and ea did it together , and put it on uplay, 
  i 'll donate you 3k ... 
  graphics , mods , freedom of choice, 
  i still have 500gb free on my 2tb, 
  * looks in closet *, 
  oh , it 's just the 20 optical drives i have salvaged from old computers, 
  get windows 8.1 , it 's a lot faster and better optimized for modern computers . 
  peasants need to pay for minecraft skins ... 
  i can just fire up gimp and make my own for free ( if i had the skills , that is ), 
  amd tested this , pcie 4x gen2 was enough to run 2-way xfire without significant framerate drops . 
  i do n't think 8x will bottleneck your gpu, 
  western digital or hitachi if mechanical , samsung , intel or kingston if ssd, 
  which graphics card do you have ? 
  it was n't in your flair, 
  there 's your problem , not enough graphics horsepower . 
  just run the vanilla or the least demanding version of glsl shaders till you get the 770, 
  metro : last light has physx turned on by default , disable it and you should get a massive performance boost, 
  i have way more graphics processing power than you ( r9 270x ) and the game lagged for me too . 
  after disabling physx the game ran on ultra, 
  i 'm using it on vmware , but i would never use it on a physical machine, 
  no problem , i had to look this info up myself when i bought the game , so thought i would save your time, 
  get out , peasant, 
  i read the manual, 
  same happens in tf2 mvm : /, 
  titan has better cuda performance, 
  friend of mine had a ping of 90000ms ( yes , 90 seconds ) , good thing he was only using irc xd, 
  ah , how i love opengl shaders, 
  well it does have an accelerometer , which counts as input ... kinda ... 
  if you want to keep your pc on carpet , make sure your psu still has sufficient airflow ( i presume your case has the psu on the bottom ) . 
  install gentoo, 
  ubuntu and os x already have this built-in, 
  are n't the amd temp readings inaccurate when under 40c ? 
  i get 31c on coretemp and 48c on speedfan : / i have no idea which is correct, 
  it 's the best budget cooler . 
  i have one chilling my fx-8320, 
  24fps was originally a compromise between film cost and movie smoothness . 
  nowadays with enormous hard drives and advanced video compression ( and powerful graphics cards , of course ) 24fps is just retarded, 
  is n't the potatostation 4 's cpu 1,6 ghz ? 
  my phone 's cpu is clocked higher :d, 
  i like potatoes too , but now when i live alone i 've only had potatoes as chips : /, 
  [ i should clean my desktop ] ( https://imgur.com/vngvq8m ), 
  how to play pc games on ps3 : find an unupdated ps3 that supports linux install , install linux on it , install qemu on linux , install windows on qemu , done, 
  i have an athlon xp machine with a radeon 9550se that runs windows aero smoothly, 
  [ stoopid pc hardware store was out of black models ] ( https://imgur.com/j9atwgo ), 
  it 's a battery saver , graphics cards use a lotta power ya know, 
  just backup his data and reinstall windows ... 
  it 's gon na speed up his laptop a lot, 
  i have an lg g2 ( international model , d802 ) . 
  if you have the money to buy one , please do so . 
  the battery life is just amazing . 
  i can go through 2 days without recharging if i do n't use my phone much , and 1 day with random facebooking . 
  also the performance is incredible and the 1080p ips screen looks awesome . 
  currently i 'm running cyanogenmod 11 m7 and it 's stable as rock , but even the stock rom is stable and fast despite lg bloatware . 
  before you put your pc back together , get a better case . 
  the cable management on that one is horrible : /, 
  do n't ask me , i do n't use nvidia cards . 
  we do n't need the power of the cloud , we already have the power we need in our rigs . 
  [ this good graphics on ps4 ? 
  ] ( http://emotibot.net/pix/8539.jpg ), 
  [ i have no games : c ( feel free to add me ) ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/solakkasilakka/ ), 
  you can always add an hdd later . 
  i 'm lazy at deleting old stuff and my 2tb hard drive is almost full :p, 
  i recommend trying linux on vmware or a separate computer . 
  cuda is for plebs , pros use opencl, 
  [ oh please ] ( http://www.frozencpu.com/products/15688/ex-blc-1093/aquacomputer_aquadrive_x4_hdd_liquid_cooling_block_bay_adapter_-_copper_edition_25124.html?tl=g30c203 ), 
  you are not going to need a soundcard for gaming , trust me . 
  the only situation where i needed a soundcard for gaming was on my retrorig with shitty onboard audio that used the cpu, 
  most laptops have the driver installers on a separate partition, 
  did n't the ps3 have a 9-core cpu ? 
  i ca n't even remember , such a long time since i have touched one, 
  i 'm aware of that, 
  so kinda like hyper-threading ? 
  to everyone who downvoted : yes , i am aware of the fact that higher clockspeeds do n't necessarily make a processor faster , i have personal experience on this subject ( remember the athlon xp vs pentium 4 war ? ) . 
  i just thought it was funny that my phone 's processor , a passively cooled device has higher clockspeed than a properly cooled x86 cpu,
