  yep . 
  got my 16gb g2 almost a year ago and it 's been great with cm . 
  i did pay 400 $ for it though :(, 
  reddit sync crashes on my phone sometimes . 
  apart from that , it 's best reddit app . 
  because everyone else has one . 
  classmate of mine has an s3 . 
  he was complaining that it was really slow , so i installed cm11 for him . 
  have n't heard him complaining since , except for the `` camera not connected '' bug , which seems to be very common . 
  now i regret buying an lg . 
  what about lg ? 
  just curious . 
  [ cyanogenmod ] ( http://www.cyanogenmod.org/ ) , the most popular custom rom . 
  i recommend trying it out . 
  \\  not available in your country, 
  their [ wiki ] ( http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/about ) explains quite well . 
  finnish brother detected, 
  yay , drm . 
  apple knows best . 
  the steam skin is called air btw, 
  i have one of these , works great . 
  the fastest internet speed on the list is the slowest my isp provides , lmao, 
  i got the r9 290 for a fully usable 4gb, 
  they should make a game pc-only once . 
  i remember one game that my brother installed on our mom 's laptop . 
  it came with some shitty adware , and refused to start if you uninstalled the adware . 
  yeah , it was the card of my first `` real '' build . 
  ( real as in : not secondhand parts ), 
  we have random computers , ranging from am2 athlon ii 's to lga1150 i5 's, 
  finland here , i get nothing when i type it into google . 
  not impressed . 
  i 've had way more tabs open . 
  my max has been 379 . 
  when i 'm on chrome , it uses 6gb with 50 tabs . 
  it does n't work in chromium on ubuntu o_o, 
  i bought avg like 2 years ago from a sale when i did n't know shit about android phones . 
  have n't had it installed for a loooong time . 
  this is why i do n't buy carrier variants . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ country ^ ^ ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ them . 
  i 'm using an app called linux deploy , works great . 
  you ca n't believe how big of a pain amd catalyst is on arch . 
  i 'm not the original owner though , salvaged it from a donated pc . 
  get blues then ? 
  is n't there a hotkey to turn off the fps counter ? 
  you should install adaway , brother . 
  i have n't missed the ability to remove the battery after i got my lg g2, 
  realtek is crap . 
  i use ubuntu atm , but my favorite is arch . 
  i 'm jealous of your monitors, 
  after 9 months in development , hopefully it has been worth the weight . 
  only 20 ? 
  maximum for me is 68 . 
  i 'm running unofficial cm12 on a galaxy ace 3 ( gt-s7275r ) . 
  would n't call it fast , but it 's way better than with stock touchwiz rom . 
  i know a guy who has almost 6k hours on tf2, 
  lg g2 , bought from a store about a year ago . 
  i was supposed to buy a nexus 5 originally but they were all out of stock , and did n't wan na go home empty-handed . 
  i play a tf2 mod , and occasionally it can bring my rig to it 's knees . 
  drops down to 10 fps are n't uncommon . 
  am i welcome with my g2 ? 
  not available in my country \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  it 's free in finland too . 
  edit : link for finnish version https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/hurjap%c3%a4%c3%a4t?id=jxk0lcexcok, 
  i just installed cyanogenmod on it . 
  cm12 runs really smoothly , and have n't really missed any lg rom 's features , other than the remote control which did work on cm11 . 
  forza port or gtfo, 
  hard drive died ? 
  damn . 
  losing files ai n't fun :(, 
  tried [ this ? 
  ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/att-galaxy-s5/general/how-to-root-g900aucu2aoa1-4-4-4-2-3-2015-t3021120 ), 
  i 've had it for a year but have n't played it much . 
  snoipin 's a good job m8, 
  you ca n't believe how op it is in uberupgrades mod . 
  deluge masterrace, 
  i think it can . 
  it 's been a long time since i used it last time . 
  muh unusual, 
  me too . 
  ducky shine 3 masterrace, 
  ff 36 should support 60fps . 
  there was some config thing i had to do though . 
  i had some problems with it . 
  i recommend deluge instead . 
  if i navigate to a folder with a lot of files , it freezes . 
  well , the first word i learned to write was `` koff '' , which is a local beer brand here in finland, 
  i uninstalled it a long time ago , so do n't even care about fixing it anymore . 
  i have the thing turned off . 
  i do n't really use it . 
  my msi 290 does . 
  i have the same problem : / should change to slower internet . 
  whatever . 
  and they taste bad . 
  atleast to me . 
  tfw no intel cooler to use as a coaster, 
  i 'd appreciate if you uploaded it to gfycat . 
  or just add more dust filters . 
  i would have politely asked them to use earplugs . 
  ca n't without a pcie slot . 
  you do n't have the tux ?
