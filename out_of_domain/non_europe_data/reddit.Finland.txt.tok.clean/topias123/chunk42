  \\  physics, 
  my school has no sites blocked , so no need to use tor :3, 
  so that 's why i see so many screenshotted memes ... 
  the linux version is crap , unfortunately :( i 've had very bad experiences with it . 
  i recommend playing it on windows . 
  l4d2 works great on linux though . 
  edit : killing floor on linux works slightly better if you play it on a single monitor . 
  what a coincedence , i ordered one for myself yesterday , and it 's arriving today , 
  it 's quite a light game . 
  the gt 610 i have at school runs the linux version at 45fps in 1080p . 
  i have a contraption with 68 cannons , all firing in the same direction . 
  i managed to crack the northbridge on an old socket 775 motherboard last year . 
  i wanted to change the paste on it , but it was very well stuck : /, 
  kwin is better . 
  nope . 
  is it in official nightlies ? 
  i ca n't seem to pair one to my lg g2, 
  i have one in my server ; _ ;, 
  it 's not that bad though , runs teamspeak server on debian 7 just fine . 
  i got my single 4k monitor yesterday :3, 
  i joined the 4k masterrace, 
  i do n't wan na melt my server, 
  there was a similar infobox running on ubuntu in a cinema , in lahti , finland, 
  you can have your opinion . 
  i have mine , and i think arch is the best . 
  it was 10.04 . 
  remember when ubuntu was actually light ? 
  tfw my server does n't even have xorg ( or wayland ) installed, 
  they worked perfectly on my r9 270x ( rebranded 7870 ) . 
  what distro you on ? 
  rpm files are for red hat and it 's derivatives . 
  installers , like . deb files in * buntu . 
   just make sure you 're chipset and bios supports them first . 
  that 's why i 'm still using it . 
  i got a c2d e4300 that does n't work with the motherboard : /, 
  edit : i also have a phenom x3 with no motherboard , and have n't had time or interest to get one . 
  my 270x worked perfectly in both . 
  have you tried enabling mantle ? 
  i do n't think there is any other option than reinstall : /, 
  seems like overkill : /, 
  create a secondary partition for steam and other games . 
  that way you do n't have to redownload them . 
  i have 8gb of ram and 4gb swap has been enough . 
  best bot ever, 
  i ca n't even get catalyst working on arch :(, 
  heimdall is a lot better . 
  i completely hard-bricked a galaxy xcover . 
  tried to flash a custom rom with the stock recovery , and it wiped everything from the phone . 
  worst part is that my friend did the same exact thing to his phone :p, 
  this is why i pirate my movies . 
  ( although i do n't watch a lot of them ), 
  i 'm ok with drm , but excessive drm makes me absolutely mad . 
  a finnish tv station 's android app does the same thing , it does n't work on rooted phones/custom rom 'd phones at all . 
  i have a cheap ikea table too . 
  it could n't handle an angry young adult with a screwdriver . 
  steam does n't scale well on 4k monitors :(, 
  \\  looking at the image on my new 4k monitor, 
  \\  realizes how small 1080p actually is, 
  anyway , good to have a new member , 
  i bought my win8 .1 from there . 
  when they still sold at / r/softwareswap, 
  try starting steam from the terminal and paste the output somewhere ? 
  me too . 
  i 'm getting close to 300 games, 
  what if a mouse bites the cord ? 
  once i got 5 during a 2 hour gaming session, 
  i bought assetto corsa on early access and pre-ordered the dlc . 
  was not disappointed . 
  inb4 geforce gt 710 2gb, 
  i have an r9 290 and a single 4k monitor . 
  thanks . 
  i have n't used ubuntu for a while so i forget :p, 
  i prefer the [ infinite cannons mod ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409444525 ), 
  i 'm fine with 16:9 , since my monitor 's resolution is so high . 
  it 's locked to a single platform . 
  vulkan will work on every os ( if hardware allows ), 
  \\  calls package manager `` app store '', 
  torvalds is disappointed in you, 
  if someone buys the domain , i 'll replay half life 2 in 4k, 
  install a cheap ssd and linux on it , and see of they complain anymore . 
  i can barely play it at 2xmsaa . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ 4k ^ ^ ^ ^ monitor, 
  email asus and ask for one ? 
  i once got 4 million fps in chivalry . 
  thanks amd, 
  mine is only 120gb : c got it from my brother the christmas before kingston did ye olde switcheroo . 
  my server has been on since september , until last month when i rebooted it . 
  edit : also my windows pc has been on for 2 days and 7 hours, 
  yeah . 
  i ca n't notice any aliasing when i play games with no aa, 
  install an ie theme on firefox, 
  unix systems are mostly case-sensitive . 
  ubuntu or any of it 's derivatives, 
  amd drivers are pretty bad on linux , but i think you should be fine . 
  i had an r9 270x ( now upgraded to a r9 290 ) and it handled source games very well , with either driver , so hd 7970 should have no problem . 
  open drivers tend to be more stable , but proprietary drivers have better 3d performance . 
  use open drivers first , and try catalyst if you experience bad performance . 
  looks like my old setup before i got my 4k monitor .
