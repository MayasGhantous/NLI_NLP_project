  same here in finland . 
  cancer, 
  why do american carriers put their ugly logos on every damn phone ? 
  we do n't have any carrier-specific models in finland , only international models . 
  gnome is pretty wonky . 
  kde seems to work pretty well . 
  ca n't seem to get displayport audio to work under kde though : /, 
  i installed i3 on my laptop . 
  [ how i feel ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/234/765/b7e.jpg ), 
  i 've heard a lot of good about t-mobile, 
  i 'm probably gon na go back to chrome . 
  4k videos do n't work in ffox for me . 
  i have a same size tube of mx-4, 
  did you use ddu to remove old drivers first ? 
  friend of mine had the same issue with his new r9 285 ( he had a gtx 650 before ) , and cleaning up old drivers helped . 
  ducky shine 3 < 3, 
  ddu would have been easier . 
  it does work , but the audio is distorted . 
  fuck that . 
  all i want is an unlockable bootloader ; _ ;, 
  google now launcher, 
  i get 4 day battery life on my galaxy ace 3 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 20 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ minute ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sot, 
  my windows 8.1 failed to boot because i installed an icon pack . 
  i ca n't get gnome to work well on my 4k monitor . 
  it looks weird . 
  kde works best imo, 
  i never create a separate / home . 
  if i fuck up or change distro , i 'll just use a live cd/usb to copy my stuff . 
  on cm12 it 's not really an issue . 
  it has the same internals as their upcoming freesync monitor , so theoretically yes ( [ source ] ( http://www.legitreviews.com/samsung-amd-freesync-supporting-displays-coming-2015_154351 ) ) . 
  and hopefully , because i bought one :p, 
  i turned it off on my 8320 and oc 'd to 4.4 ghz . 
  idk if my mobo is bugged or limited , but i can only have a baseclock of 3.7 ghz if turbo is enabled . 
  i use that too . 
  i do n't have it on . 
  unlimited 50/50 megabit . 
  well , my samsung monitor does n't have touchwiz . 
  dangers : you may break your phone if you 're stupid and do n't read the instructions . 
  in most cases voids warranty . 
  benefits : you can do anything you f * cking want, 
  \\  posts link to a cracked version, 
  if you seriously ca n't pay 7 $ for a damn game , get a job . 
  not really that far fetched . 
  how do i know if you have a flashable samsung stock rom downloaded on it ? 
  that 's why i always buy international models . 
  i do n't get my phones from the carrier ... 
  mine too . 
  why ? 
  is n't 965 series quite old ? 
  g2020 was released 2 years ago . 
  i only get 8k in normal fire strike :(, 
  does n't work in windows 8/8 .1, 
  i just crank it up all the way . 
  in op 's picture : place where windows belongs, 
  i practiced by taking apart and reassembling old desktops before i even found linus . 
  cities : skylines is made in unity . 
  i like the game and it 's reasonably well optimized . 
  no , because ` murica, 
  it sometimes dips to mid 30 's for me , but it 's acceptable in this type of game imo . 
  i got a single r9 290 , planning to get another . 
  friend of mine had a hp where the backlight turned off when you booted linux . 
  had to connect it to a tv and make an init script to enable it . 
  my own hp laptop however supported linux absolutely perfectly . 
  the hotkeys did n't do anything on his laptop . 
  yes . 
  kde masterrace, 
  finland here , my download is 10 times faster than my upload ( 100/10 megabit ), 
  i got ubuntu booting just fine with secure boot turned on . 
  honestly i have n't seen it either , even though i use mostly windows 8.1 ( pls no kill , i like games ; _ ; ) . 
  most bsods for me were caused by my shitty oc skills . 
  cancer is a bitch . 
  cod blops has a separate mac version instead of using steamplay . 
  i had a nokia bluetooth headset , it was the best headset i 've ever had . 
  it blocked out all background noise and had good sound quality ( model is bh-505 ), 
  i got mine before the switch . 
  in finland we have a great store named verkkokauppa, 
  if one is going to use linux , nvidia is the way to go . 
  amd drivers on linux are garbage . 
  i have that monitor . 
  yep , but i happened to have one of those ssds . 
  yeah , it 's still my primary boot drive . 
  because ps2 was ( and still is ) awesome . 
  it is possible to overclock a monitor btw, 
  my rig got 400000 draw calls per frame in mantle : /, 
  that reminds me , i got ta test how much fps can i get in crysis 3 at 4k, 
  i 'm going back to reading good ol' newspapers !, 
  i got a 4k monitor too , but only a single 290 . 
  it handles games better than i expected , but i have n't tried the most demanding games i own ( crysis 3 ), 
  depends on the game . 
  on assetto corsa i had to lower graphics a bit , and it runs at 45-60 fps when i play on 24-player servers . 
  have n't tried other games yet . 
  a friend of mine does . 
  finnish internet is great too . 
  i 'm on dna and i get 50/50 mb/s for 30 $ / month , 
  i have a g2 , it has been fine . 
  only problem i 've had with it is sometimes ( although rarely ) the screen scrambles , like the vram was corrupt . 
  that problem goes away by turning the phone off for a while . 
  just throw the case away when your parents are n't looking . 
  my brother is using my mom 's old , broken iphone 4 because it 's slightly faster than his galaxy ace 3 . 
  2 things to change immediately :,
