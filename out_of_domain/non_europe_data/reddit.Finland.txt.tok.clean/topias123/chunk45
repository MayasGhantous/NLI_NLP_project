  instead of, 
  cd . . & & cd . . & & cd . . 
  downsampling ? 
  native 4k is better . 
  i 'd say `` torilla tavataan '' , but the joke is getting old . 
  i 'd use it , but 1080p looks like crap on a 4k monitor :(, 
  inb4 banned . 
  i 'd rather not . 
  mine is only 1/4th of your speed :(, 
  3840x2160 please ? 
  not in my home though , bad signal :(, 
  does n't work with my home city . 
  b-but muh upgradability, 
  link to a benchmark please ? 
  i 'm planning to get a server with that cpu, 
  install the proprietary drivers . 
  ever heard of mouse acceleration ? 
  mse and malwarebytes have been enough for me . 
  \\  $ 100 for a windows license, 
  intel hd graphics have the best drivers . 
  as for gaming , nvidia , or wait for r9 3xx cards . 
  my twin frozr is loud as shit . 
  it 's an r9 290 though . 
  if microsoftsoftwareswap did n't exist , i 'd probably still use pirated windows . 
  i 'm against piracy , but i do n't want to use $ 100 for a piece of software . 
  installed it on arch , segfaults : /, 
  i 'd really like a `` real '' linux phone . 
  i hope some manufacturer would do such a thing again . 
  i know a girl who uses debian and lfs but she 's not particularly interested in me : /, 
  when it 's on , your cursor movement speed scales by how fast you move the mouse . 
  when it 's off , movement will be 1-to-1, 
  edit : i 'm not very good at explaining stuff , but hope you understood what i meant, 
  i 'm quite good with linux . 
  had some problems with the amd drivers on arch , but in the end i got it working . 
  tip : read log files like / var/log/xorg .0 . log, 
  adblock does n't give shit to your favorite youtubers or any other site that uses ads . 
  still , i use ublock because ads in my country are annoying as hell . 
  there 's a really simple and shitty way to detect adblockers in one hackintoshing site . 
  it just redirects your browser to a page that tells you to turn off adblock , was rather easy to bypass . 
  google will probably implement something more sophisticated . 
  7-zip is best, 
  off . 
  if it 's on , it 'll fuck up your aim . 
  i 'd like jolla to release a phone with a real keyboard . 
  / r/pcmasterrace + / r/linuxmasterrace + / r/androidmasterrace, 
  praised be gaben , torvalds , and duarte, 
  my mom is a dumbass . 
  yep . 
  i have my clock in the center , but i do n't have a weird font . 
  tbh i have a good mother but her phone taste sucks . 
  maybe it 's the best , considering her laptop was full of adware when i checked it the last time . 
  that would be the only use for a console . 
  i ca n't get pci passthrough to work with my hd 5570 :(, 
  people always go apeshit over nothing . 
  remember [ ebola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kjg4rcgr3c ) ? 
  i think it failed because i 'm using amd catalyst . 
  gave up . 
  as a u28d590d owner , i can confirm that ign is full of shit . 
  the monitors in my school only work with vista . 
  stickers do n't lie . 
  i read from archwiki that catalyst fucks up something and gpu passthrough wo n't work if one uses it . 
  r9 290 for the host , hd 5570 for the vm, 
  i think you missed the / s. 
  and yes , they do actually work on any os we 've tried from xp to win10 tp and any linux distro . 
  my chrome uses 200mb per tab . 
  i already gave up on it . 
  i 'll be fine with dualboot for now . 
  i forgot what extensions i have . 
  atleast ublock , res , and flashcontrol . 
  * betterttv, 
  * browsing protection by f-secure, 
  * enhanced steam, 
  * flashcontrol, 
  * google play music, 
  * hintahaku ( price search tool for finnish online stores , quite handy ), 
  * https everywhere, 
  * reddit enhancement suite, 
  * search by f-secure, 
  * stop autoplay for youtube, 
  * twitch live, 
  i bought some `` linux-powered '' stickers from there . 
  i would honestly just pirate the hwid-locked programs after that . 
  i 'm using just ext4 . 
  not on linux atm ( about to play gta v ) , but i 'm running 3.19.3-ck on my arch . 
  debian does n't support uefi out of the box iirc . 
  why ? 
  my first was ubuntu 10.04, 
  last time my amd driver crashed was yesterday . 
  before that like a year ago . 
  we in finland have bread so hard , the chainsaw would break . 
  glorious finn masterrace, 
  lg g2 here and i ca n't tell what it says . 
  i tried playing a game in a 720p window . 
  could n't , because it 's too small on my 4k monitor . 
  is yours loud when you go over 50 % fanspeed ? 
  mine is . 
  my school has c++ classes instead of c # . 
  the teacher makes us use some historically old compiler ( borland or something ) , so i just grabbed an unused pc and installed arch on it . 
  this is the first time i regret buying a ducky keyboard . 
  i want muh lighting effects d :,
