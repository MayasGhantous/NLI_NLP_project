  2013 : radeon hd 5570 ( still a poorfag , got it for free ), 
  2014 : radeon r9 270x, 
  later in 2014 : radeon r9 290, 
  yes . 
  i 've heard that sapphire makes really good cards . 
  maybe you just had extremely bad luck ? 
  i have an msi r9 290 atm , dear god it 's loud . 
  i read them for entertainment . 
  i 'm a weirdo . 
  i restart it immediately . 
  my pc boots in 5 secs anyway . 
  \\* combines my 100mb/s cable and 100mb/s lte \\*, 
  what ? 
  or hgst, 
  amd thermal sensors are inaccurate below 40 \u00b0 c. 
  it 's more like 20-25 \u00b0 c, 
  my suggestion to your suggestion : have the game separate graphical mods from gameplay-changing ones ( maybe 2 subfolders to the mods folder ) . 
  gtx 970 and r9 290 are actually rather close in performance ( and price ) . 
  amd tends to win in high resolutions . 
  nvidia 's linux drivers are a million times better than amd 's fglrx :(, 
  i 'd like one as a physx card . 
  my room gets cold in winters , even though i have an r9 290 . 
  my power costs 0,06 $ per kwh . 
  like i care about power consumption . 
  amd 's turbocore is crap . 
  it does n't work properly ( atleast for me ) . 
  it limits my base clock to 3.7 ghz , so i 'll rather have all cores at 4.4 ghz, 
  includes 3 new jobs , ability to watch your sim do it 's job , and also has a dishwasher . 
  and judging from one youtuber 's video , they forgot to add the damn dishwasher . 
  oc 'd 8320 and r9 290 , have n't had much issues . 
  game did crash earlier but not anymore after patches . 
  i meant megabits ( about 11.5 mb/s ) . 
  i wish i had 100 megabytes per sec :(, 
  i never got into civ , dunno why . 
   it never fails to become your most played game, 
  uh , that 's gon na take a while . 
  pretty much same specs as my pc, 
  it gigahertz, 
  same, 
  some things do n't work at all when selinux is on . 
  for example : lg g2 's ir blaster on aosp 5.0 roms, 
  i use the one that was recommended in cm wiki, 
  i do n't have a laptop , only a desktop : /, 
  i 'm planning to get the 1000w model . 
  i sold my old laptop with ubuntu to my dad . 
  spam, 
  you dropped this \\ \\, 
  my fx-8320 needs only 1.3 v for that c :, 
  linux does n't need registry edits for changes like this . 
  i spent only about $ 1000, 
  because most dumbasses do n't have unlimited data , so i guess it 's better for them to just block it . 
  hope it works that way with vulkan too . 
  we can never have enough hats, 
  8320 at 4.4 ghz with only 1.3 v, 
  it 's intentionally buggy . 
  and hilarious . 
  fractal design define r4, 
  limit framerate to 24 . 
  playing the game is gon na be terrible then though . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i had a data usage cap . 
  i think it was in 2006, 
  i have a 4k display too . 
  absolutely glorious . 
  i 'm ok with paid mods if they are good quality . 
  if the modder just wants a quick cash-in for a crappy mod , fuck that . 
  i want a stock r32 skyline gtr , 
  gt has like 1000 cars . 
  why does your motherboard take so long to post ? 
  performance is meh , stability is crap ( on catalyst ), 
  still , i do n't want to support an evil company, 
  i still have my hd5570 . 
  used it about a year ago , it played tf2 at 1080p just fine . 
  my electricity company offers completely wind-generated electricity for 0.068 $ / kwh, 
  these puns make me cry ; _ ;, 
  manual transmission ?!, 
  gimmie pls, 
  amd gpu 's are pretty crappy on linux . 
  get an nvidia , unless you 're against their business practices . 
  meanwhile my rig lags when i use firefox . 
  why does the front remind me of mitsu lancer . _ . 
  i think it 's related to my screen resolution ( 3840x2160 ) , and lack of 2d acceleration on amd, 
  i do n't even have an ac . 
  thankfully i live in a cold-ass country . 
  mass surveillance is n't going to stop terrorism , just like drm wo n't stop piracy . 
  drop the windows disc and put a better quality psu in it . 
  i use them too , but i noticed they do n't have a server in my country until it was too late : /, 
  they shoulda implemented this into the ifruit app, 
  well i 've thought of removing my dvd drive and getting a usb bluray drive . 
  he also crammed it into an itx build with a titan x, 
  my steam acc is worth 3x more than my pc, 
  gtx 560ti is 4 years old already ? 
  it feels like yesterday when i was with my uncle to get him one ( his prebuilt 's gpu died ), 
  i saw a friend upload it on facebook ( ripped from vessel ) . 
  it 'll come to youtube in a while, 
  as someone who 's using a gt610 at school , probably not . 
  ca n't even run a 10 year old game at 1080p ( flatout 2 to be specific ), 
  yesterday i was raging at linux 's stupid sound system . 
  \\  desktop sounds and almost all games work when `` pulseaudio-alsa '' is installed , but wine audio does n't, 
  \\  nothing else works when it 's not installed, 
  edit : this is on kde,
