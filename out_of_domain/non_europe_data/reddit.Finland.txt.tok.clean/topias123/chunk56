  \\* flicks psu power switch *, 
  could work with amd gpus . 
  what about my butterfly knife ? 
  best would be to use intel or wait for amd zen imo . 
  and this is coming from an amd user .

  an old guy i know found 2x hd 7870 in the garbage . 
  everyone should do that . 
  people are afraid of doing it for some reason . 
  i have encountered only one , and i can live without it . 
  surprisingly my bank does n't block root , but blocks screenshotting .

  we have a minecraft server ? 
  only thing holding me back is amd graphics drivers : /, 
  decided to buy a gtx 980 . 
  `` trying to get java working for a minecraft server can be a nightmare '', 
  u w0t m8, 
  it took me 10 minutes to install oracle jre 8 from aur and another 5 to get a tekkit lite server running . 
  inb4 separate lobbies for m + kb users, 
  get a cheap 500 gig hard drive for linux like i did . 
  i 'm gon na hop in too when i get my gtx 980, 
  that 's why i 'm getting the 980, 
  open source drivers are better than amd proprietary . 
  when i used catalyst , i got huge stutters . 
  rekt, 
  yep . 
  i do n't play cs , but in tf2 the open source drivers are infinitely better . 
  my cpu ai n't . 
  my amd is only 60 \u00b0 c on full load . 
  m ` buntu, 
  \\* tips kernel *, 
  worse than on windows , but acceptable . 
  open source driver is getting better all the time . 
  i 'm using a single ssd with uefi , never had problems . 
  but i have 2 bootloaders , so if grub shits the bed , i can still use windows bootloader to get into it ... uefi allows you to have multiple bootloaders on the same drive . 
  i do n't think it 's restrictive , but it just might be my motherboard that 's not made by a shitty oem , 
  so did mine , but sold it due to being a slow piece of shit . 
  battery life was about 4 hours on both windows and linux . 
  i 've heard that hp work/enterprise laptops are good , do n't know about their uefi implementation though, 
  i 'd buy it . 
  i love my 4k monitor . 
  so sharp \\* drools *, 
  amd and intel have the best open source support . 
  i play on a console sometimes . 
  \\* prepares for downvotes *, 
  that 's majority of / r/pcmasterrace in a nutshell . 
  if i play with a mouse & kb , 30fps just feels terrible for me , and i have to lower graphics settings . 
  that 's just my experience . 
  seems like most people do n't read that part then . 
  i ca n't hear anything wrong with cm12 's audio . 
  but then again , i ai n't no audiophile . 
  why the fuck is archive.is blocked in finland ? 
  if you 're seriously concerned of your privacy :, 
  get a thinkpad, 
  install coreboot on it , followed by linux, 
  use a vpn/proxy, 
  rip data cap, 
  excuse me sir , do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior linus torvalds ? 
  are n't rackmounted servers louder ? 
  if it makes updating faster , i 'm fine with it . 
  cortana is just named `` hae '' ( meaning `` search '' ) in the finnish version : /, 
  edit : no wait , cortana is n't available at all, 
  my friend 's 2500k idled at 96c when i asked his specs . 
  i 'll start using it when it works on windows 10 , linux , and android , and has bookmark sync between all of them . 
  he 's a noob when it comes to pc 's, 
  thankfully his stepdad was able to clean the heatsink and apply new paste , now 70c when gaming . 
  what adapter is it ? 
  i had problems with mine , installing the proprietary driver fixed it . 
  yup , mine is the same chip . 
  you might want to install the proprietary driver . 
  do n't know if there 's one for mint , but there 's an [ aur package ] ( https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/8192cu-dkms/ ), 
  edit : maybe [ this ? 
  overclocked ? 
  my fx-8320 gets to only 60c , despite the overclock . 
  is n't it only accessible with a hack ? 
  why ca n't valve implement it to the pc version ? 
  amd raptr app records just fine . 
  i 'll start caring about it when i get forza on pc . 
  got downvoted to oblivion on car throttle for wanting an mkii supra . 
  he 's using the stock cooler , and the pc has never been cleaned after it was built 3 ( ? ), 
  years ago . 
  i did n't ; _ ;, 
  a word \u2122 ? 
  i did . 
  only issue i had was with amd drivers , and a fix was released within a day . 
  ` murica does, 
  finland here . 
  no data caps in mobile internet , unless you get a phonecall oriented or cheap plan . 
  looks like a gpu driver bug to me . 
  edit : read rest of thread , install nvidia drivers . 
  super-key sounds so much cooler than windows-key . 
  gmail , but self-hosted would be best . 
  i 've had great experience with debian on servers . 
  my tekkit lite server is running on arch :p, 
  arch because easier to install oracle jre from aur . 
  originally i was n't going to use it as a server , and i was too lazy to change os, 
  i get better framerates with oracle jre ( on clientside ) , so i assume it 's better . 
  playonlinux and catalyst opencl drivers ca n't be installed at the same time .
