  i have unlimited data so i just set the limit to some absurdly high number . 
  i ca n't understand why i ca n't just turn it off : /, 
  reinstall drivers ? 
  my experience is completely different . 
  i 've had zero issues with amd on windows , but on linux the drivers are completely unusable : /, 
  i have an msi r9 290 , and it 's almost as loud as the reference model : /, 
  block those too . 
  dna finland , paying 25 $ / month . 
  unlimited 100 megabit . 
  just use the open source radeon driver . 
  it performs just as good on older cards . 
  your pr team is great , but your linux drivers ai n't :p, 
  could you make a 3840x2160 version too ? 
  i can never find any good wallpapers in uhd :(, 
  20 , but birthday in a month so i put 21 . 
  m ` vidia, 
  now i feel like buying fish sticks . 
  my r9 270x worked really well . 
  i think you can find one used for 150 $, 
  nope . 
  never saw a need for it . 
  you 're trying to use legacy boot on a laptop that uses uefi ... find out what your efi partition is , and mount it to / boot/efi ( or / mnt/boot/efi ), 
  use command line then ? 
  i do n't see a problem here :p, 
  r9 290 , getting 40-60 fps . 
  ca n't remember my video settings , but they 're cranked pretty high . 
  not really . 
  you can easily run ac at 4k with a 300 $ graphics card . 
  i 've tried other games too , gta v runs at high settings , bf4 at mostly high . 
  nah , i like to launch all my games from the terminal . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ? 
  / r/pcmasterrace is leaking . 
  i 'm using oxygen-mono . 
  too lazy to find a better font , and i can read it just fine . 
  install os-prober , and re-run grub-mkconfig . 
  i found one great youtuber named whybeare . 
  he 's one of the most polite people i 've seen , and makes quite a lot of content about beamng.drive mods . 
  and now we have actual football . 
  my rig runs bf4 at high-medium settings , getting 50-60 fps  _ , 
  my country is spending all funds on 4g lte ... 
  pros : cheap as fuck , unlimited , works practically everywhere, 
  cons : unreliable , muh ping, 
  my current plan : `` up to '' 150mb/s for 30 $ / month , getting 100mb, 
  iirc ac2 was pirated a lot because the legit version did n't work . 
  damn finland and it 's expensive beer . 
  not in my country . 
  it 's like 5c/kwh in finland . 
  for some reason i ca n't type premade text fast ( such as in typing tests ) , but i 'm really fast when i can think myself what to type . 
  noice telling him to not noice his noice . 
  i love when tf2 autobalances me when i 'm playing with friends . 
  glorious finland masterrace . 
  we also have really good internet . 
  eh , it 's quite good . 
  i just hate that i ca n't forward ports  _ , 
  wpm in tests : 69, 
  wpm in chat : 420, 
  i actually live about 30km from helsinki , in tuusula . 
  4g working just fine . 
  what carrier you on ? 
  i 've always had dna . 
  never had a single problem with them . 
  even called their supposedly bad customer service , got an answer in 5 minutes . 
  really ? 
  only place i 've had connectivity issues was in lapland : /, 
  i have 100gb too , and did n't even realize it :p, 
  amd 's open source drivers are better than their proprietary crap ... 
  random assortment of different distros , including * buntus . 
  also some winblows isos . 
  it 's possible to have an android without google apps at all . 
  it just depends if the user can live without them . 
  friend of mine is actually using his phone without any gapps . 
  downloads apps from f-droid , and sometimes google play with a downloader . 
  hidpi brother :3, 
  i 'm getting 150mbps for 30 $, 
  ping is horrible though :(, 
  that 's my hometown 's track , currently living about 30km from it :p, 
  because most consumers do n't need high upload speed . 
  msi 's r9 290 has a cooler clearly not meant for it . 
  loud as hell , and gets hot . 
  almost as bad as amd reference . 
  my secondary pc has a 9400gt . 
  runs half life 2 on almost max settings at 1280x1024 . 
  had to put lighting to medium to get 60fps . 
  i know a gay dude who likes tits . 
  would n't it be possible to block all of microsoft 's ip addresses with a firewall ? 
  i suppose a hardware firewall would work . 
  i remember it saying `` buy '' when i last used ubuntu . 
  ( which was a long time ago ), 
  en oo viel , ac ei toimi kunnol windows 10 : l :p, 
  you 'll get them when everyone stops preordering . 
  soooo never again . 
  $ 3000 for 5 years of internet ? 
  i calculated that mine costs around $ 2000 . 
  150mb , 30 $ ( $ 34 ) per month . 
  30 $ ( $ 34 ) per month for 150mb unlimited lte . 
  rather glorious . 
  my first `` real '' rig :, 
  amd phenom ii x3 710 + asus m5a78 something = 75 $, 
  4gb stick i bought accidentally = 30 $, 
  case , psu , etc = free,
