  i saw it happening with my own eyes dude . 
  1080p is fine with me , since it 's my phone 's native resolution . 
  #lgg 2masterrace, 
  i think it 's a lie . 
  not sure , i only have a shitty 17 '' tv, 
  i have unlimited data , but currently i 'm on vacation using shitty hotel wifi . 
  the pain ; _ ;, 
   500 per year on upgrades, 
   most gamers upgrade every 5 years, 
  honestly the g2 's 1080p screen is enough , it 's already an unholy battery hog, 
  so much vodka it spoke in russian next morning, 
  but still my g2 's battery last longer than my mom 's ipotato and my brother 's low-end sammy, 
  i like tf2, 
  my x360 is a dust collector . 
  got ta protect my shrine ya know, 
  steelseries kinzu v2 . 
  best budget mouse imo, 
  automod never sleeps, 
  change to arch linux and you too can enjoy updating hourly !, 
  i like trains, 
  my cable modem can easily handle 4k , i just need a monitor that can handle the resolution, 
  probably when i was poor , and only could afford a secondhand mobo + cpu . 
  playing garry 's mod on integrated radeon hd 3000 is n't exactly fun ( 40 fps on 800x600 ), 
  minesweeper at 1,3585929473848 fps, 
  my brother 's sammys battery dies faster than a peasantbox player can say `` doritos '', 
  i got peasant framerate on ultra at 1080p ( specs on flair ), 
  we have quadboot pc 's in school, 
  freebsd, 
  120gb ssd for windows, 
  2tb 5400rpm drive for games and stuff, 
  500gb 7200rpm drive for ubuntu, 
  might be because it 's mostly played by 12-year old peasants . 
  not saying every cod player is a 12-year old brat , i have some adult friends who like it . 
  xeon ? 
  minecraft, 
  no pets and pc has dust filters on every intake . 
  * feelsgoodman *, 
  i once disassembled my friend 's pc . 
  his family has 3 cats , the pc was 7 years old , never cleaned . 
  i 'll just leave you with the mental image . 
  also i have asthma and cat allergy . 
  * seconds, 
  i have it , and i 'm ordering a g27 when i get from vacation :3, 
   macrohard game on linux, 
  we can only dream , just like peasants dream of 1080p, 
  i can confirm this , i used to play p2 with my german friend, 
  * mac and linux, 
  my phone 's cpu runs at 2,3 ghz , but it does n't mean it 's faster . 
  it does n't recognize cpu frequency on my laptop, 
  probably vram, 
  rust in a nutshell : just like dayz but with nudity , and less guns, 
  i had a 3 core too , phenom ii x3 710 to be exact . 
  now it 's on the pc that will convert my peasant brother, 
  i 'm waiting for freesync monitors, 
  cpu is fine but that gpu is absolute crap . 
  build a pc , it 's more fun, 
  i want mine black so they match my mind, 
  heat dissipation, 
  msi afterburner osd reports 40000fps on unreal engine games for me, 
  it 's a neat little arcade racing game , and works on all operating systems . 
  team fortress 2 , it 's a really fun free2play team-based first-person-shooter, 
  i 'm trying to convert my peasant brother . 
  you think i can do it ? 
  i built him a pc from my old parts , bought him cs bundle , and even set up steam family sharing so atleast he has games to play . 
  have n't yet given him the pc , because i live 60km away , i have no car , and neither has our mother . 
  i prefer turning on supersampling from amd catalyst . 
  it 's intensive as hell but looks way better than msaa ( i get 150fps with 8x msaa , 20fps with 8x supersampling ), 
  30 + fps is enough for me in racing games , but i ca n't stand anything less than 60 on other games, 
  i dunno about you but my computer is private, 
  conduit managed to slip in to my pc once through some ad-funded installer , but removing it was easy . 
  nah , my glorious 1080p monitor is enough . 
  also i 'd like to wait for the technology to mature a bit, 
  freesync was shorter to type, 
  that 's actually a great idea . 
  imagine ek making watercooled cupholders :d, 
  i just realized what i wrote and i 'm an idiot . 
  ignore me and carry on, 
  windows vista , 7 and 8 ( used to be xp , vista , 7 ) and ubuntu, 
  a friend of mine said he plays wot at 15 fps . 
  he said he 's used to it ( he has a gtx 650 btw ), 
  go watch tutorials on youtube , it 's quite hard to mess anything up if you have even a little bit if common sense . 
  [ link4u ] ( http://youtu.be/w4js2a1qdb8 ), 
  i have a spare core2duo e4300 , i remember that it ran minecraft at 50 fps on far render distance ( gpu : amd radeon x1600 512mb ), 
  clean install pliz, 
  more like 3-5 years, 
  i have actually 2 of those processors , i could send you one . 
  i just do n't know if they even work, 
  his download speed is 250kbit/s , ping around 100ms , cpu is a phenom x3 i gave him as a gift ( he had an athlon 64 x2 ), 
  you can emulate ppc processors, 
  there are server motherboards that can handle 512gb of ram, 
  it looks a bit like the old sharp radio i got from my dad few years back o_o it 's old and cheap but it still beats any modern stereo system, 
  there are plenty of tutorials online . 
  same motherboard as mine :3, 
  bad automoderator, 
  now you can c :, 
  i think they should keep tf2 the same and make tf2 : ep1, 
  only 60 % ? 
  mine takes like 80 % of my 2tb hdd, 
  razz0r65 's comment has 3 points . 
  euro truck simulator 3 confirmed,
