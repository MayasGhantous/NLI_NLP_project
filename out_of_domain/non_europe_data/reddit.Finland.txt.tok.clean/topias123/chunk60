  yeah , that was kinda annoying to see some software removed . 
  however it 's not that big of a pain to reinstall it . 
  i 'm probably the only one who does n't have anything from corsair . 
  tek syndicate is awesome . 
  i have a burning earth t-shirt and coffee mug from them :p, 
  what if one plays games with gf/wife ? 
  i 'm running it maxed at 4k on a single r9 290, 
  the old farts in charge think it 's a good idea . 
  and my mom does n't give a damn about pc 's or gaming : /, 
  you can buy it from / r/microsoftsoftwareswap, 
  tfw received 23m for free from hackers , never got banned or funds removed . 
  power in my country is cheap as fuck , so like i care . 
  buy it from a trusted seller and you know it will be valid . 
  did n't enable ssaa , but i think everything else is max . 
  i bought mine there , like thousands of other people . 
  have n't heard anyone complain . 
  i salvaged a 1tb wd from a friend 's 7 year old pc , still works fine . 
  that feel when ssd, 
  i 've had 2 kernel panics . 
  1 ) was on ubuntu 12.04 , trying out the newest kernel at the time , which was 3.11 i thinks . 
  my first ( kinda ) successful kernel build too . 
  2 ) was on debian sid, 
  i 've had plenty of panics on os x. 
  ran hackintosh on multiple computers . 
  are probooks good ? 
  i 've heard that hp 's are crappy . 
  it was changed recently . 
  r7 260x , r9 290 , and every card from now on will use pcie bus for crossfire . 
  only with aussie internet . 
  i think one guy has 26000 hours in cs : s, 
  there exists a 3d printer for food . 
  the funny thing is , i do n't take care of my face . 
  it 's not a quadcore . 
  it 's an octacore with 4 fpus . 
  or you could be like me and not give a shit about people around you . 
  mx blue ftw, 
  my grandpa just plays tetris on his gbc, 
  yes ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i get that in tf2 , but only on rd_asteroid, 
  maybe it 's a rare miracle overclocker that can hit 10ghz at 1v ? 
  ps3 and xbox 360 emulators ca n't play anything as of now . 
  [ 1337 ] ( http://www.kapanen-production-store.de/webroot/store13/shops/63925820/53f4/b2af/a7b7/5fdd/fe61/c0a8/2bb8/dcc9/foto_4.jpg ), 
  much cleaner imo , and i heard it solved the microstutters in multi-gpu configs . 
  \\  using an ipod, 
  i take better care of my pc though , i clean the dust filters regularly , and sometimes check if there 's any dust inside . 
  got some old computers and played around with them . 
  sleep mode for night . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i had a capped internet connection . 
  hope it gets hats from tf2 too, 
  i used one in school . 
  it was so shitty i ended up getting a hd 5570 from home and using it for rest of the year . 
  i can tell 1440p from 4k on my 27 '' monitor . 
  i play on an unofficial tf2 server group that most of the time uses stock maps . 
  i should be fine , right ? 
  i 'm 21 and forgot how to laugh . 
  my 8gb kit was 80 $ , and it was n't even laptop ram . 
  i just bought 16gb for 150 $, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ europe-tax, 
  go to youtube.com/html5 , and enable that . 
  there was some stuff you need to enable in about : config as well , forgot what . 
  prices are fucked here in finland . 
  my current 8gb kit cost 80 $, 
  actually i did n't , because my mom bought it for my birthday, 
  never ordered from germany . 
  i should though . 
  ubuntu touch yourself ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  gon na steal that training wheels analogy . 
  dx9 works natively on amd cards . 
  amd cards still are shit on linux when compared to nvidia . 
  people buy windows ? 
  i have an msi twinfrozr 290 . 
  loud as shit m8, 
  new cooler op, 
  the 300 series uses a new cooler . 
  my 290 has the older twinfrozr iv , and it 's loud . 
  to top it all off , i fucked up repasting and it gets to 93 \u00b0 c now , maxing out the fanspeed . 
  before it was 86 \u00b0 c at about 70 % fan . 
  too lazy , and in the 2 games i play currently , it only gets to 70-80 \u00b0 c due to fps caps . 
  ( aion f2p capped to 60 , tf2 capped to 132 myself ), 
  b-but muh aur, 
  t'was a joke . 
  tbh i bought my copy of windows , but most people i know just pirate it . 
  same , but i do n't have a car at all . 
  shame it does n't support amd cards . 
  but i think linux gamers would benefit a lot from it . 
  right now radeon drivers on linux are crap . 
  i enjoy looking at a massive golden minigun when i play ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yes it is ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  try mesa 10.6 or 11 . 
  i get quite a stable framerate in tf2 with mesa 10.6, 
  i 'm not getting any tearing on open source drivers . 
  what card ? 
  mine is r9 290, 
  yes , newest plasma 5 . 
  maybe that would keep my r9 290 under 90 \u00b0 c, 
  have n't touched my xorg.conf at all . 
  only kwin settings . 
  just install it . 
  works fine on windows 10 . 
  double brother \\ m /,
