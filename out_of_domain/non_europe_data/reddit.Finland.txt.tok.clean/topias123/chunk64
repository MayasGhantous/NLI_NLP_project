  yeah 4k is only for enthusiasts atm . 
  1080/1440p for mainstream . 
  i have an fx cpu , it 's not as terrible as people think it is . 
  my 290 plays 4k surprisingly well . 
  dirt showdown on linux runs at 40-50fps on ultra and 2x msaa, 
  linux is better anyway . 
  edit : yay , getting downvoted for telling the truth . 
   useless phone cover, 
  that cpu seems fine to me . 
  maybe slow hard drive ? 
  these jokes are getting old , like your mom . 
  \\  be me, 
  \\  bought an r9 290, 
  \\  mainly plays tf2, 
  steamos is just a linux os running steam big picture . 
  google play music, 
  it 's convenient to have all music in the cloud instead of wasting local storage . 
  although storage is n't a problem on my desktop , i use it a lot on my phone with only 16gb of storage . 
  ( 10 of which is user-available ), 
  yes . 
  it says `` install gentoo '' in finnish :p, 
  my laptop has 3gb of ram and a 1280x800 screen . 
  amd drivers are n't that bad anymore . 
  i can play dirt showdown at 4k with my single r9 290, 
  my fan runs at 625000rpm sometimes . 
  1080p looks like crap to me . 
  gotten used to 4k . 
  i have a 2007 lg laptop with a 1.7 ghz pentium and 3gb ram . 
  installed debian on it , works fine for browsing the internet . 
  i have an fx-8320 and an r9 290 , and i still feel cold . 
  must be defective parts then . 
  people buy windows ? 
  you can play 4k just fine , but not at max settings . 
  i 'm fine with a single r9 290 . 
  next masterrace to join : / r/androidmasterrace, 
  [ my phone 's speed ] ( http://openspeedtest.com/results/426258 ) , download speed jumps between 50-110mb / s , mostly staying around 70mb/s . 
  all kinds of metal . 
  lately lots of industrial . 
  i think you meant double data rate . 
  if you use an amd card , disable catalyst ai . 
  tried dirt showdown , with catalyst ai on i got 20 fps at 720p and medium settings . 
  with catalyst ai off , getting 40-50 fps at 4k ultra settings . 
  it 's an iphone . 
  it 's battery dies in about 30 minutes . 
  for 4k , the bare minimum i 'd recommend is an r9 290 or gtx 970 . 
  i personally play 4k with a single 290 , and i get 40-50 fps in gta v , although have to play at quite low settings . 
  psu and gpu, 
  a 290x can play 4k , but you 're gon na need to crank settings way down in most demanding games . 
  amd-optimized games seem to work very well though , my 290 runs bf4 at high settings with some on medium at 60-70 fps . 
  dirt showdown runs at 40-50 fps on linux . 
  one tech-related thing actually did change . 
  there was a petition to broadcom to open-source one soc 's drivers . 
  they actually did , now the community ported android 4.4 on the phones that use that chip . 
  i do n't play cs : go , but i 'll sign it even though i do n't think it 'll help , 
  that 's not that bad . 
  install linux on it and it 'll be a lot faster . 
  i have a t2500 and it runs arch linux with kde 5 just fine . 
  happens with my amd card too . 
  well we humans like shiny things . 
  the only thing that nvidia has over amd is superior linux drivers at this point . 
  i found one , 
  i thought it installs itself . 
  was n't there a news article about the update installing itself ? 
  my pc does n't push out enough heat to heat up my room :(, 
  that feel when i 've had a modern linux system use about 50mb . 
  xddddddddddddd, 
  you can make them work with some effort . 
  enable desktop mode , install wine ( or wine-staging if it 's available ) , then you should be able to play some windows games . 
  playonlinux can configure a lot of games for you . 
  they still are crap . 
  better than 3 years ago , but still crap . 
  i believe fglrx does n't work with linux 4.2 yet . 
  he goes for quantity over quality . 
  cpu ? 
  we need 8k 60fps porn, 
  run sensors-detect as root and answer yes to all questions . 
  should do it . 
  mines beside my desk , not under :p, 
  msi twinfrozr is n't any better than reference : /, 
  lol no, 
  most recent drivers cause insane slowdowns when using chromium . 
  ( related to video acceleration ), 
  and generally they 're just crap . 
  but gamers are n't gon na use open-source drivers ... 
  atleast not until they perform faster than prop, 
  chrome is faster for me than firefox, 
  most of us eurofags do still drive stick . 
  man , i should play space autists again ... have they fixed the stutters yet ? 
  can you send me the laptop ? 
  my current one sucks : c, 
  mine 's at 4.4 ghz as well , but did n't disable any power saving stuff . 
  on my laptop , i ca n't use windows 10 home at all , as it does n't let me force install the igp driver ( ati x1250 ), 
  probably gon na scrap the laptop anyway at some point , way too slow for me , and the battery barely lasts 1 hour . 
  i have n't used cd 's or dvd 's in a long time . 
  i buy my games online , and use streaming for music . 
  i 'm in that group . _ . 
  most people there are pc gamers , but they just lurk . 
  most vocal ones are console gamers . 
  mine is tier 3, 
  i need to get a job finally .
