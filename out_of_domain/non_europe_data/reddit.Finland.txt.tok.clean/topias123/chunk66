  27 '' is n't that small . 
  i also noticed that stutters in games are now gone after i upgraded to 24gb, 
  ehh , i 'd rather only kill the game process . 
  i could bind a key for `` killall -09 hl2_linux '' for those tf2 ragequits . 
  * tips kernel *, 
  why the fuck are you running gnome 3 then ? 
  why not ? 
  amd 's open source drivers are good . 
  proprietary driver has a bug that causes gpu usage to be locked at 100 % in desktop use : /, 
  i have no idea if anyone else has this problem , but it makes fglrx unusable for me . 
  why not uefi ? 
  too hard for you ? 
  most of the web is going for html5 now , so i do n't think it should be a high priority . 
  i tried it for about 10 minutes , did n't crash in that time . 
  framerate is quite good though . 
  ( using mesa 11 as well ), 
  my dad has used ubuntu for a year now , should be fine for your dad too . 
  3gb per month ? 
  wow , i use like 20gb per month . 
  how the hell ... 
  i have 150/50mb , unlimited , for 20 $ / month . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ shitty ^ ^ ^ ^ tf2 ^ ^ ^ ^ jokes ^ ^ ^ ^ ftw, 
  i sold my dad a laptop with ubuntu , and just left him with it . 
  has n't had any problems , until lately when he asked how to update flash :d, 
  i had issues for like 2 months , until last month 's amd driver update . 
  could n't play at all because of a graphics glitch : /, 
  i think you meant the best carrier in the us ? 
  the whole world does n't have the same carriers . 
  i personally am on dna finland . 
  steam guard . 
  i pay less for my internet . 
  that has happened to me on pc as well : /, 
  at 69 fps ? 
  my 8320 works fine at 4k . _ . 
  all decent emails have 2-factor auth too . 
  i 've heard that minecraft runs better on linux if you have an intel or nvidia gpu . 
  i did use a similar mouse on a linux pc , worked fine . 
  it used an old serial port . 
  12 hours later , still up . 
  catalyst is garbage otherwise though : /, 
  why does everyone use this smiley ? 
  tfw g27 working perfectly, 
  try the kde version ? 
  i 'm running 4k with a 290 . 
  games run ... acceptably , but i need to drop the quality quite a bit . 
  well i had 100/10 cable for the same price ... 
  i can never focus when i play ets2 . 
  today i lost 15k into truck repairs and fines :(, 
  did a quick search , and apparently yes . 
  ( up to 128 petabytes ), 
  still , one should use ntfs on windows . 
  your problem is dayz . 
  you can actually just extract them if you use efi . 
  shadowplay and amd raptr use gpu instead of cpu . 
  sometimes i encourage people to try linux , but never force it . 
  from those 4 , google is the only one i trust . 
  it 's not updated to 4.2 yet : /, 
  it has went downhill since version 11.10 : /, 
  that resolution though ; _ ;, 
  mine can , but not very well . 
  you do n't have a linux app ? 
  shame , but i understand . 
  then there 's me , not giving a shit about the fallout franchise . 
  wifi adapter is n't necessary for everyone . 
  other than that , nice pic :p, 
  could be ram . 
  run memtest . 
  they have enthusiast cards , but no cpus . 
  i 'm actually using one . 
  got mine before the flash swap . 
  ahh , well ... 
  i 'm using pia myself , but thought it would be great for friends who need a free vpn on linux . 
  damn that 's small . 
  gcc masterrace, 
  wan na hear a joke ? 
  never caused my pc to slow down , but the software itself is sluggish . 
  i have an issue with mesa 11 . 
  tf2 stutters like hell :(, 
  i just ignore the retardation and do something else . 
  which is why i bought an nh-d15 instead of an aio . 
  catalyst does work with 4.2 if you build it with gcc 4.9 . 
  dear god that download speed is slow ... 
  people who 's friends are too dumb and stubborn to change , like me . 
  nobody ever calls me anyway ; w ;, 
  chromium , because it 's the fastest in my experience . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ tfw ^ ^ ^ ^ 24gb, 
  well what else would you need then ? 
  i know one woman who smashes the keys as hard as she can . 
  earbuds or headset , maybe a controller and usb stick with ps1 roms . 
  and charger ofc . 
  well yeah , they are . iso 's , but i still call them roms :p, 
  it 's built-in to cm . 
  tbh stock gnome 3 looks a bit ugly . 
  i like to use a theme called paper , it makes it look like google 's material design . 
  trying to port sailfish os for it , but i feel i 'm too dumb . 
  well , i did build cm12 for it last year , but idk if i can port a whole new os : s, 
  why no gapps ? 
  i could n't live without them : /, 
  i wish they released a phone with better specs . 
  aussies do n't have sex .
