  they mate , m8 . 
  could a card with a backplate survive that ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ gon na ^ ^ ^ ^ try ... 
  every time i install hackintosh , it says 20 minutes remaining . 
  always takes over an hour though . 
  never tried to crouchjump , still lost my appendix . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ rekt, 
  old farts . 
  voltage ? 
  mine needs 1.368 v at same speed . 
  using a lg g2 , still does fine . 
  tfw amd cards do n't need a bridge, 
  is there any benefit from ram oc ? 
  what about non-gaming applications ? 
  for example , if i do something that caches a shit ton of stuff in ram ? 
  linux support doe, 
  my 8320 at 4.7 ghz rarely goes over 60 \u00b0 c. 
  but , well , i have an nh-d15 strapped on it . 
  maybe got deleted by nvidia ? 
  define r4 ? 
  quite a crappy place to live in . 
  389ms average , but i 'm on my phone and have n't had coffee yet . 
  g27 masterrace, 
  nahh ... isps should just stop being greedy fucks . 
  i really hope it does n't trigger a ban . 
  i forgot to close it when playing tf2 today . 
  so much contradicting info on the internet about it , but my friend said he has done the same and never got vac banned . 
  would buy , but they only have us keyboard layout . 
  friend saw my old profile picture , said i looked like a russian druggie . 
  nothing , because i do n't use zsh . 
  `` who would use it '', 
  apple isheep ? 
  i ca n't use catalyst at all , there 's a bug that causes 100 % gpu usage in random situations , like watching a video : /, 
  causes stutter , sometimes even freezing . 
  no use if it makes my desktop unusable . 
  i 've now had my 290 for a year . 
  it runs hot as fuck , and the cooler is loud , but nothing else wrong with it . 
  amd 's windows drivers have been excellent since catalyst 14.12 . 
  marketing with the most fanboyed car of modern times ? 
  reference cooler ; w ;, 
  i got that same keyboard . 
  amd . 
  i can say that catalyst on linux is crap . 
  well it 's fun to try a new os , even if it 's not useful to you . 
  every time i see i3 , i 'm wondering if they 're talking about the wm or cpu . 
  \\ #justlinuxproblems, 
  i have the paid version . 
  so handy . 
  what if you do n't have one yet ? 
  i have an lg g2 with cyanogenmod 12.1 , but i 'd recommend a nexus 5 with cm12 .1 because it 's easier to install on it . 
  last time i had a blue screen was when overclocking . 
  never had a driver caused or random bsod . 
  it 's on steam too . 
  but what if ... 
  example : someone built his new pc , has nothing else to install os with except phone . 
  oh god i have the same card ... 
  it 's so loud and hot , barely better than a reference ... 
  my twinfrozr has gotten to 94 \u00b0 c, 
  i did solve it by repasting and installing another fan . 
  now gets to 88 \u00b0 c at significantly lower fan speeds . 
  \\  not / r/linuxmasterrace, 
  8320 @ 4.7 ghz with an nh-d15 here , cpu rarely goes over 50c when gaming , max temp i 've seen is 70c when both cpu and gpu on full load . 
  if it fixes my linux issues , i may not buy a 980ti after all ... 
  since 15.7.1 , there has been a bug that causes 100 % gpu usage randomly in desktop usage , but only at 4k . 
  i dont mind the power light , since i sleep with ceiling lamp on anyway . 
  dont judge me , i 'm still scared of dark ; w ;, 
  engineers ca n't even design proper cans , gj, 
  they can turbo up to 2ghz iirc, 
  gon na get a supernova 850w myself soon . 
  my fractal 650w is screaming in agony . 
  mad . 
  i actually got it without ever activating the auth thingy . 
  do n't need to install with legacy boot , linux should work with uefi just fine . 
  i have windows 10 pro and arch linux dualbooting just fine . 
  even had secure boot working but fucked it after cmos reset . 
  only reason i can think of is android development , but that requires installing a jdk , not jre . 
  automod probably, 
  i have a x1250 working on win10, 
  used one year and a half ago before my r9 270x . 
  still have it , unused since it refuses to work on my secondary pc . 
  ( and yes , i 'm sure it 's not dead , since it worked on a school pc ), 
  only thing the 970 has is better linux perfomance and drivers . 
  hopefully that changes soon . 
  my little brother has given me stuff for free :p, 
  \\  american prices, 
  most i got is like 10 days on windows, 
  mst ? 
  my 290 handles 1100mhz with +5 power limit lol, 
  it ca n't even play flatout 2 , a 11 year old game at 1080p 60fps . 
  not related , but why does your cpu need that much voltage ? 
  mine is at 4.7 ghz , needing only 1.368 v. 
  games . 
  i thought hard drives have an ntfs partition from factory ? 
  nvidia has superior opengl performance . 
  tried alpha versions , got about 2000 fps, 
  wii u ? 
  i dunno , iirc every hard drive i 've bought had an ntfs partition . 
  xf86-video-amdgpu ? 
  it does n't support my card . 
  guess i won the silicon lottery then ?
