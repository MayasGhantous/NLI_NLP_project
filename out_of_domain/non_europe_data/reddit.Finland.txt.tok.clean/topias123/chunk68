  it 's kind of like a usb hub , but displayport . 
  edit : gon na buy a new psu and go for 5ghz, 
  you have the same gpu as me . 
  have you had issues with temps and noise ? 
  tn looks fine to me . 
  i think you can run up to 3 from 1 . 
  hope they fixed their shit linux drivers finally . 
  edit : why am i getting downvoted ? 
  i know from experience their linux drivers are shit . 
  apparently they have released crimson for linux too . 
  got ta test when it hits aur . 
  also , the one in 4.5 probably wo n't support my card . 
  it has n't yet arrived in aur or the unofficial catalyst reposotory . 
  wait until then :p, 
  my tn monitor claims it 's 10 bit . 
  is n't that better ? 
  sorry i do n't know much about monitors : i, 
  i 'd go for an arch based distro , much less hassle since it 's in the repo . 
  antergos, 
  mine sounds like a jet with no oc . 
  over 40 % fanspeed and i can hear it . 
  i 'm probably gon na buy a 980 ( ti ) if they do n't fix their drivers for hawaii : /, 
  do n't wait . 
  [ crimson is out ] ( http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=linux+x86_64 ), 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm afraid i have to go for nvidia , even though i hate their business practices ... 
  i dunno if i wan na wait for amd to fix their drivers though : /, 
  i have no idea how is it on arch , as it 's not in aur or unofficial repo yet . 
  on windows it 's excellent though . 
  how did you manage to kill your gpu ? 
  i get horrible stutter in source games when i use the open driver : /, 
  still have n't fixed the bug i 've been having . 
  all i 'm doing is using chromium , and gpu load locks at 100 % . 
  why ? 
  does n't do that on windows . 
  has caused annoying mouse stutter , and even freezes sometimes . 
  also makes gpu fan scream ( thx msi ), 
  no , but i 'm sure somebody else has the same issue as i have . 
  maybe i 'll have to report it then ... 
  well i did send a bug report just now . 
  i just was kind of afraid to send one because never done it : i, 
  then i ca n't play tf2, 
  framerate drops on mesa 11 : /, 
  where do i send a bug report ? 
  3 years , 300 games . 
  i had a gf who was born the same exact day as me . 
  msi 's crappy cooler probably . 
  i 'm swapping my 290 for a 970 soon . 
  my 8320 handled 4.4 ghz at 1.3 v, 
  i play beamng just fine with mine . 
  4.7 ghz at 1.368 v , lel, 
  terraria is fun . 
  all keyboards use a generic driver . 
  i 'm sure it works fine on windows 10 and linux too . 
  my gpu thankfully does n't have coil whine , but i could n't hear it anyway under the fucking fan noise . 
  and my tv has coil whine when it powers on . 
  my 8320 gets 4.4 ghz at 1.3 v , but now i have it at 4.7 ghz at 1.368 v. 
  compiling anything with 6 cores at 4.7 ghz should n't take much time . 
  i do n't have it either . 
  crappy for this gpu . 
  oh god no pls, 
  my 290 idles at 50 \u00b0 c, 
  i use mine as a secondary monitor . 
  2-5 \u00b0 c in southern finland , 
  290 , 50 \u00b0 c idle . 
  45c is lower tho . 
  now op can overclock it to fucking hell . 
  my 290 gets to 88 \u00b0 c , idles at 50 \u00b0 c, 
  mine is n't inside any cabinet , the tower is just sitting on the floor : /, 
  even has very good airflow . 
  aaaaand you 're banned from 9gag, 
  msi loudfrozr, 
  memecenter ? 
  fucks per second ? 
  accord ? 
  what a nice family you have . 
  a fury ca n't handle 1440p ? 
  it 's made for 4k, 
  * amd, 
  and meh ... 
  still crap . 
  core temp and msi afterburner . 
  i think all amd chipsets allow overclocking . 
  especially with amd 's linux drivers . 
  i 'm going to replace my 290 with a 970 : s, 
  yes , but still crap when compared to their windows drivers . 
  they are literally unusable at 4k for me . 
  i 'm not kidding , using chrome or firefox at 4k causes 100 % gpu load . 
  when it comes to gaming , they are ... 
  acceptable , i guess ... 
  i can play dirt showdown ( native ) at 4k , runs at 40-50fps with my single 290 . 
  and yes , i have reported that bug . 
  yeah that 's an old chipset , not really meant for oc : /, 
  yes . 
  amd is a good company in that regard . 
  the bug i described is only on fglrx . 
  with radeonsi i get otherwise bad performance , but browsing is fine . 
  but the card is n't performing as well as it could . 
  that 's why i 'm getting an nvidia . 
  ( 970 or 980ti , not entirely sure ),
