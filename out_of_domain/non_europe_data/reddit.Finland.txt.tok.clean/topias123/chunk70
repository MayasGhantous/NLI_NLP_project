  he burnt that with the heat from an overclocked 9590 . 
  arctic mx-4 is supposed to last 8 years without significantly losing performance . 
  i change it every year . 
  you still seem to have shitty internet . 
  i can compile linux kernel and watch 1080p video at the same time with all cores at 100 % , no frame drops .

  if you lived near me , i 'd give you a free hd5570 . 
  best chair i 've ever had , but i 'm used to sitting low and it does n't go as low as my previous one . 
  why the fuck did microsoft rename mouse acceleration . 
  totally different continent : /, 
  their drivers are n't that bad anymore . 
  worse than nvidia , but usable .

  needs an ikea markus for dat ass ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i got it for free from the amd gaming thing . 
  just play to get enough points , and you get it for essentially free :p, 
  it loads instantly for me : /, 
  that should be a mod . 
  it spawns a specific amount of crabs ( or whatever those things are ) and measures framerate . 
  $ 250 and 1800 hours lost into that game ... 
  still love it .

  212 evo is amazing . 
  got my fx-8320 to 4.4 ghz with it . 
  most pc users do n't like linux because it 's not familiar . 
  they try it , expecting it to work like windows , get frustrated , start hating it and downvote everyone who mentions it . 
  oh , my current card in my future card 's box . 
  nah , do n't really have overheating issues . 
  i just like to see the temps :p, 
  thought you saw it from my flair . 
  yeah , it 's because swedish is finland 's secondary language . 
  with that attitude it will always be . 
  i think it 'd run it at minimum settings . 
  my r9 290 gets hotter : c, 
  not even a reference cooler . 
  eyyyy , motherboard bros, 
  overclockers ? 
  i did n't buy one , since mine came with one .

  og xbox did use an x86 cpu . 
  all i want is working mipmapping into gsdx ... 
  d :d, 
  mine does , and only paid 150 $ for it . 
  \\  most efficient, 
  \\  with server gpus based on r9 290x, 
  kek, 
  depends on game . 
  but generally yes . 
  my non-reference 290 runs hot . 
  i 'm not going to use it .
