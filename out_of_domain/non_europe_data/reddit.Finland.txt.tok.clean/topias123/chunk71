  they need to get to my email first , which already has 2-factor auth and a different password . 
  mine gets to 90 \u00b0 c. 
  fuck you msi . 
  i check my emails on my phone anyway . 
  1 ) yes, 
  2 ) no , but i have a profile i sometimes use, 
  3 ) default , and the thing sounds like a jet, 
  \\  implying android needs antivirus, 
  it gets it 's air from a 140mm fan installed to the bottom of the case . 
  that enough ? 
  it can if the user is a retard . 
  their kernel is open-source doe, 
  no , but i 've met retards . 
  on the floor , and not on a carpet . 
  i 'm sure it gets enough air . 
  i did have a 120mm fan installed on the side panel for some time , but that was n't a good solution because the fan is a loud piece of crap , and a pain to deal with when i open the case . 
  did lower temps by 10 \u00b0 c though . 
  are those turbo coolers loud ? 
  thinking of getting a 970 with one . 
  not really , if the games he plays work on it , it 's fine ... 
  grid autosport is getting a linux release soon , 
  my dad . 
  chrome , because it works the best . 
  yes . 
  wish i could fit an nh-d15 into a mitx pc . 
  i 'm going from r9 290 to 970 . 
  why ? 
  crappy cooler on this thing , and linux drivers . 
  apple = magic, 
  confirmed, 
  self-built desktop with dust filters :3, 
  [ same story ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/6102/fractal-design-define-r4-case-review-evolution-not-revolution ), 
  the song is annoying as hell to me . 
  why so many gpu 's ? 
  would n't any new single-gpu card beat all of those ? 
  so you are fine with a kernel that 's older than my phone 's kernel from 2013 ? 
  linux version of source engine has that . 
  it 's a shame jewvidia limits us like that : /, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ unless ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ use ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ linux, 
  i hope that changes with steamos : /, 
  mine 's at 4.7 ghz , using a noctua nh-d15 . 
  mine only needs 1.368 v , stays rather cool . 
   amd gpu drivers, 
   on linux, 
  oh god . 
  a ps4 ? 
  well , my dad does n't seem to have a problem with it . 
  all i want from amd is working linux drivers . 
  nah , modders will fix it . 
  amd 's server chips are already lga , dunno why their desktop stuff is still pga . 
  well i ai n't waiting . 
  buying a xeon e3 1231v3 soon . 
  my msi r9 290 gets to 90 \u00b0 c. . . 
  sounds like a jet too ; ~ ;, 
  i unfortunately have personal experience of amd 's linux drivers . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ got ^ ^ ^ ^ ptsd, 
  rockstar support is about as useful as steam support . 
  and you get free money from hackers anyway ... 
  i bought one once when hackers were n't very widespread . 
  it was the 200k card and only got it because was broke : /, 
  gotten 23m hacked money , not banned . 
  3 garages full of cars , 1 still in progress . 
  \\  not using android yet, 
  8320 at 4.7 ghz + an r9 290 . 
  still feel cold . 
  overclock dat bitch, 
  how 's that motherboard ? 
  i 'm going to get a similar one ( h97 gaming 3 ), 
  custom loop or aio ? 
  hope that massive cooler wo n't damage your cpu . 
  i got a ducky shine 3 . 
  i prefer a full keyboard :p, 
  trying to decide between this and asus h97-plus . 
  only 8 $ price difference , but does the msi have better features ? 
  i 've had very good luck with asus personally , and my current msi gpu is way too loud for my taste : /, 
  most useless bot , i see links just fine on mobile . 
  i got a shine 3 too :3, 
  yep ... amd 's drivers are crap : /, 
  50 $ in finland too . 
  not a bad price . 
  but it wo n't support my card ... 
  i 've never had issues with asus : /, 
  mine gets to 90c . 
  telenor probably . 
  telenor is an isp , operates in norway and sweden iirc . 
  heard it 's pretty shit , and kinda confirmed since friend has it and his ping sucks . 
  i 'm upgrading to haswell soon , going for an asus mobo again . 
  specifically the h97-plus . 
  what ? 
  ca n't hear you . 
  useless bot . 
  i bricked my bro 's psp accidentally . 
  wish i could access archive.is . 
  very interested seeing it . 
  tfw no cat, 
  allergic ... : c, 
  my mom has a cat , ca n't visit her because of it . 
  cyka, 
  hope they wo n't start blazing . 
  i 'm going to upgrade my r9 290 to a 980ti later .
