  or the next nvidia , if it comes out by then . 
  i have that same card . 
  how are your temps and noise levels ? 
  mine runs fucking hot , 88-90 \u00b0 c when gaming , reaching 70 % fanspeed : s, 
  and it 's loud . 
  that msi cooler is a loud piece of shit . 
  source : i have one, 
  mine 's not as hot as op 's , only 88-90 \u00b0 c at load . 
  is it worth swapping all my case fans for those ? 
  install a fan to the side of your case . 
  helps a ton , even if it 's a crappy fan . 
  i 'm thinking of getting a reference card myself , even though my case has fine airflow : /, 
  check his flair . 
  25 $ / month for 150/50 . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shame ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ lte, 
  i have fractal design fans all around right now . 
  silent as fuck m88, 
  it 's the closetstation \u2122, 
  i 'm considering an asus r9 fury strix, 
  twinfrozr iv is a piece of shit . 
  how well does tap water work ? 
   no swap, 
  wisely done . 
  well , more about how useless swap is nowadays , especially with large amounts of ram ( over 16gb ), 
  i 'm just asking d :, 
  never watercooled . 
  \\  origin, 
  oh god no, 
  so needs distilled water ? 
  i wish mine had a good cooler . 
  as an owner of one , they do have great ssds . 
  happened to me once . 
  is n't exactly painless . 
  `` keep updateing xbox 360 please '', 
  \\ - someone in comments, 
  sigh ... 
  getting 500mb/s read speeds . 
  i have a crystaldiskmark [ screenie ] ( http://puu.sh/lwdnh/c6201424a6.png ) for proof . 
  not exactly 500mb/s , but close enough . 
  at least on amd cards it is . 
  i have an r9 290 with one , it 's loud and runs hot . 
  yep , it 's an earlier model . 
  [ this ? 
  ] ( https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/r8168/ ), 
  my m5a99x works fine with the normal arch iso . 
  what are the benefits of the new abi ? 
  performance ? 
  why do you want an older kernel ? 
  then what do windows and xbox users use ? 
  i7-4790k 's are 400 $ ( $ 440 ) in finland : /, 
  motherboard bros :p, 
  not for long though , as my intel cpu and mobo are arriving soon ... 
  i have one installed , but rarely use it . 
  mostly for the 2 cd games i still play ... 
  my 2tb is almost full, 
  probly not . 
  i just changed the icon from properties and it worked ... . _ . 
  windirstat, 
  you know how to install it ? 
  fo4 is cpu-racist . 
  upgrade to intel if you wan na play it . 
  glad i could help :p, 
  i use a 19 '' tv as second monitor . 
  vrms on my msi 290 run constantly at 90 \u00b0 c , whatever i do . 
  fx-6300 is a good chip . 
  just do n't try to cool it with a passive hyper 212 . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ tried ^ ^ ^ ^ it, 
  nope , at idle ... 
  my amd runs at lower voltage , lel, 
  their app is fucking garbage though ... 
  yep ... had this for a year soon , and i 'm thinking of upgrading to an asus r9 fury . 
  tbh there are dumb adults too . 
  some of them fanboy over different things though , like nvidia ... 
  whatwhat, 
  i said it earlier , msi . 
  and no , not a reference card , it has their twinfrozr iv . 
  that gpu is so hot ... * unzips *, 
  nh-d15 ... 
  so huge ... 
  \\  quiet computers, 
  \\  loud-ass keyboards, 
  pcmr is weird sometimes . 
  my ass hurt because of my previous chair . 
  bought a new one , no more pain . 
  if you have an aftermarket cooler , do n't screw it in too hard . 
  no living thing could be inside my pc for any period of time . 
  it 's like a furnace . 
  my dad does n't game , and does n't have enough money for a rig anyway : <, 
  he could barely afford my old laptop with ubuntu . 
  what, 
  yup . 
  the 6300 throttled to hell , fps in csgo was 60 xd, 
  yeah ... 
  i installed a beefier stock cooler from my 8320 on it , now it gets 200-250 fps . 
  the 6300 is on my brother 's rig , that 's mostly my old parts ( only the cpu and case are bought new ) . 
  he has an r9 270x , the cpu upgrade helped a lot xp, 
  they bend easily , since they are much thinner . 
  did n't have one , and i was 20 miles away from home . 
  it 's a 95w chip , so i thought it 'd work ... 
  4k gaming is amazing , even with my relatively low-end rig .
