  i 've seen a ton of nokia lumias here in finland . 
  goddamn patriots . 
  damn . 
  i should leave idle master running probably , i 'm only lvl 21, 
  friend paid that much for one 2 years ago . 
  still have these , they run fucking hot . 
  oh god i know that troll ... 
  tfw i 'm in that g + group, 
  i get 10200 with my r9 290, 
  slap him . 
  porting a game to another platform is n't easy , i assume : s, 
  dat overclock doe, 
  i have a shine 3 as well , but with white leds and mx blues . 
  is it worth upgrading from a shine 3 ? 
  ehhhh ... reds ... 
  muh games, 
  it 's still windows though . 
  why not ? 
  my msi r9 290 came with one . 
  shame that the cooler itself is crap ... 
  should i get this or the g602 ? 
  the latter is just a wireless variant , and i 'm getting tired of wires . 
  if one prefers unity , why should he/she not be able to use it on his/her distro of choice ? 
  maybe because all your damn fans are stopped . 
  why a hackintosh though ? 
  i do n't have rocket league . 
  my msi card is loud as shit ... : /, 
  spilled coke on my logitech k120 . 
  unplugged , took apart , rinsed with water , dried . 
  put it back together , works like new . 
  oh , they changed it ? 
  last time i checked it was portal 2 and rocket league . 
  and their newer coolers are much more silent ... 
  why do people even use legacy mode anymore ... 
  because majority of pcmr is retarded . 
  i would n't . 
  fuck those cunts . 
  only tf2 , with 1920 hours ... 
  i only got 4 hours in that lol, 
  probably gon na change , since 2 of my friends want me to play it . 
  so far not going well ... 
  only 600 ? 
  friend of mine has 7k hours in tf2 lmao, 
  my monitor starts really slow ... : /, 
  has been on linux de 's for ages . 
  his math is correct . 
  no games that i really want , so just not gon na participate and give someone else a chance . 
  i use my ps3 on my 4k monitor . 
  hdmi for ps3 , dp for pc, 
  i think they are both elises , but different year . 
  tfw lte with no cap, 
  my dad is n't exactly stupid , so he can use ubuntu just fine . 
  did n't take him much time to learn , like 20 minutes , and has n't had issues since . 
  used ubuntu 14.04 for a year , only called once asking how to update flash :d, 
  does n't seem to be . 
  my card is very loud and hot . 
  seen temps of 93 \u00b0 c, 
  g27 is very nice , but also very expensive . 
  dfgt is good enough for most . 
  what ? 
  the one from logitech 's site works fine . 
  finnish 4g : unlimited , no throttling , 150mb/s download , cheap ( i pay 25 $ / month ), 
  only downside is ping , and in my carrier 's case inability to forward ports ... 
  that 's an eu power cable . 
  put it to storage as a spare , 
  picked mine just fine ... 
  same install file worked on 8.1 and 10, 
  it lags on the laptop i sold him : /, 
  feels like he 's the only one who cares . 
  especially a laptop drive ... 
  you need to buy an app to write ntfs on macs iirc, 
  wtf is that list price ? 
  it 's like 6000 usd, 
  my 290 is 90 \u00b0 c under load . 
  i had an oc 'd 8320 and an r9 290 . 
  worked fine with 650w, 
  tdp = / = power consumption, 
  did you download newest , or did you get one from g27 support site ? 
  it does need a specific version , which is what i used . 
  browns with o-rings are pretty quiet , and still have a good feel . 
  if i were you , i would have went for a cheaper cpu ( such as an i5-4460 ) and a better gpu . 
  tfw mismatched hyperx and corsair vengeance lpx ram, 
  they work just fine though . 
  you rebel . 
  my username is different from my steamcommunity page . 
  tfw my dad does n't game, 
  i did overpay for the kit ... 16gb kit , 1600mhz , cl10 , paid 150 $, 
  you can choose what to put as your name . 
  no surprise . 
  the mouse is exclusively designed for right handed . 
   too much, 
  for a normal gamer , yes . 
  but for an enthusiast , there can never be enough . 
  there have been times when i 've had like 150mb free of that 24gb xd, 
  yup ... 
  even my old 8320 and 290 used 500w on load . 
  ( if you can trust pcpartpicker that is ), 
  lol i got an asus mobo and a phenom ii x3 710 for 75 $ like 3 years ago . 
  the mobo is still in use in my brother 's rig . 
  i would have bought one if my mobo supported nvme ...
