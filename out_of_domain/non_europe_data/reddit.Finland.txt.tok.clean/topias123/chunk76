  rekt, 
  never tried it on linux , but on windows it runs fine . 
  i get 40-60 fps at 1440p with my r9 290, 
  on linux ? 
  probably 10 fps on low . 
  ikea markus masterrace, 
  i 'm just too lazy to take a pic of mine, 
  ikea markus is godly . 
  i sit on it in a bad posture , yet my back does n't hurt . 
  yet amd cards are terrible on linux . 
  the only thing nvidia has over amd ( for the regular gamer ) is linux drivers . 
  hope that changes with amd 's new driver model . 
  regular gamer as in someone who just games , and does n't care about streaming or recording ( which nvidia is better at ), 
  they still are . 
  i use like 250gb monthly on my lte . 
  i have a 290 as well , both browsers work flawless . 
  try updating drivers maybe ? 
  amd card , i presume ? 
  my 290 idles at 50 \u00b0 c when 2 monitors are connected , but only 25-30 when only 1 monitor . 
  oh no ... is that a 9590 ? 
  is the cooler properly seated ? 
  worked fine with my 8320 . 
  6 months ago ? 
  damn dude . 
  and yeah , there 's been a lot of updates , latest 15.12, 
  that 's quite small , lol, 
  better cooler ? 
  single xeon peasant here :(, 
  i had a lot of crashes when i last tried it . 
  and it was n't even worth it , as my cards were n't fast enough . 
  wish i had an nvidia so i could play games other than valve titles on linux . 
   30 fps, 
  oh god pls no, 
  i ca n't stand under 60, 
  you run uhd as well ? 
  have you ever had weird issues with gpu accelerated browsers ( chrome , firefox ) lagging to hell ? 
  r9 290 , runs at 20 fps, 
  i get the same framerate in dota2 on windows and on linux with fglrx , although i 'm using the reborn beta . 
  no support from game devs really , and opengl is a mess of an api . 
  opengl is n't * bad * , it 's just hard to code for unless you use a premade engine . 
  they want to make you fat so you ca n't run . 
  when you ca n't run , you ca n't survive . 
  drunk natives are called bears now ? 
  that 'd still be kinda useful as a web browsing machine . 
  2gb is plenty for linux . 
  tfw only 150mbps, 
  you could if nvidia was n't a bitch company . 
  tfw only 60hz, 
   amd 's drivers are better on win10 than nvidia 's, 
  kek, 
  it 's 3840x2160 though , so no complaints :p, 
   be me, 
   owned mostly amd cards, 
   never had issues with any of them, 
  my non-ref gets to 93 \u00b0 c, 
  580 is a thermi , just like the 480, 
  i have it but do n't use it . 
  tfw only 3 years, 
  mine 's the gamecount one . 
  i have my ps3 hooked up to my 4k monitor , but it 's because i do n't have a good tv . 
  how good is a dfgt ? 
  i own a g27 , never tried a gt . 
  why not the r9 390 ? 
  it has 8gb of memory for future games . 
  i tried moving games to another hard drive , it just redownloads them and ignores all existing files : /, 
  i just want to copy them from my windows disk to linux without rebooting : i, 
  most of the content is the same , except for executables which are n't very large anyway . 
  yes , but checking file integrity should redownload only the executables . 
  other game data should be identical . 
  7.1 sound in most headsets is just a gimmick . 
  more distracting than helpful . 
  all i have in . bashrc ( that i 've added myself ) is :, 
  alias ls = ` ls -- color = auto ', 
  it was n't for me for some reason . 
  maybe because i installed arch over kubuntu and did n't wipe my / home . 
  7970 can still play any game at 1080p , or even 1440p . 
  i 'd say yes , it 's worth it . 
  get 2 of them and enjoy dem framerates, 
  my dad is decent at tech considering his age . 
  he has been using ubuntu for 1.5 years now without issues . 
  went from 21 '' 1080p to 27 '' uhd, 
  now i just need a better gpu ... 
  tfw 27 '' starts feeling small after almost a year, 
  tfw only single 4k, 
  already ogl 4.1 ? 
  i 'm guessing he just adapted the driver from an existing , similar apu ? 
  why ca n't sony just let us run whatever we want ... 
  a ps4 would make a great lan pc . 
  it 's small and portable , just throw it in a backpack . 
  quick edit : oh yeah , pirates ... 
  my guess is that the gpu is at idle clocks . 
  just checked , 1759 games on steam . 
  i never finished half life 1, 
  i got an fx-8320 to 4.7 ghz at 1.368 v. 
  good ? 
  only 3 years : c, 
  wish i got into oc sooner . 
  i never oiled mine , and had it for over a year now : i, 
  no wonder it 's so loud ... 
  some server boards have hotswap everything .
