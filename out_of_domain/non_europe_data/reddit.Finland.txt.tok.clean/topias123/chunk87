  4k monitor with no scaling ? 
  looks weirdly small , i 'm used to 125 % scaling . 
  i paid 300 $ for mine . _ . 
  on some amd cpus you could enable disabled cores . 
  if you were lucky , you could have gotten a dualcore with 4 working cores . 
  fx-8320 -  xeon e3-1231v3 . 
  not a huge upgrade , but still an upgrade . 
  i did play 4k quite enjoyably with a single r9 290 . 
  had to turn off aa and some settings , but it was worth it for all dem pixels . 
  is there anything wrong with 5.25 '' bay res ' ? 
  i thought i would use one if i watercool in the future . 
  amd supports custom resolutions now too , right from radeon settings . 
  got my ud590 to 80hz at 1440p easily . 
  twin amd play together well though . 
  is a bit slower , but makes almost no noise . 
  even the most silent fans are noisy if you run them at full speed . 
  yeah , green should be fine for you . 
  hopefully soon . 
  probably will only work on amdgpu driver though : /, 
  no idea . 
  i got the same framerates on both windows and linux with my r9 290 though . 
  ( maxed at 4k with no msaa ), 
  i do n't use a controller in racing games . 
  only keyboard or logitech wheel . 
  $ 100 dfgt ? 
  dfgt is a good budget wheel . 
  another option is to get a used g25 . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with fxaa . 
  well , i play at 4k so the blur is n't noticeable , 
  maybe at 1080p it is , have n't tested . 
  e3-1231v3 masterrace, 
  i was going to buy that card , was on sale for 430 $ . 
  got an r9 nano instead for 570 $ . 
  install a custom rom like i did ? 
  g602 masterrace, 
  cyanogenmod is quite easy to install https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/d802_info ( assuming you have the international variant ), 
  on the g2 , it 's not very easy to restore the stock rom i heard . 
  never had problems with cm though . 
  nvidia : everything works, 
  amd closed : properly ported games run well , others like crap (  mfw dead island at 30fps ) , sometimes unstable , horrible tearing, 
  amd open ( radeonsi specifically ) : stable as fuck , most games run, 
  even my ass runs debian . 
  4k masterrace, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ tfw ^ ^ ^ ^ scaling ^ ^ ^ ^ issues, 
  people who say 4k needs an insane rig also think that you need msaa at 4k . 
  fxaa looks just fine at 4k ( opinion , plsdunthate ), 
  i 'm supposed to get that speed , but i only get 2mb/s : c, 
  3-4 if i 'm lucky . 
  what about my 24gb ? 
  i just press win + l. 
  too lazy to turn off monitor . 
  you do n't run linux anymore ? 
  you could have bought an adapter . - . 
  gpu . 
  r9 380 possibly . 
  it 's all about the cooler . 
  an nvidia card with a shit cooler will run hot , just like amd . 
  hope that day actually comes . 
  no idea ... 
  if anyone knows how to , tell me too . 
  i had a sapphire model at school , it was fine for schoolwork and light gaming on linux . 
  even ran flatout 2 ( gog copy ), 
  my dad uses ubuntu , do n't have this problem really . 
  8.1 is still really good . 
  i like it more than 7 , feels much faster . 
  win + l works in gnome 3 just like on windows . 
  also , linux is n't really my main os yet , but i would like it to be ... games hold me back still . 
  locks your pc . 
  some igps have a small amount of dedicated ram , like my ati x1250 . 
  all it does is cause driver issues on linux . 
  it was not . 
  iphone 4 was the first . 
  you should hear my msi r9 290 . 
  it 's barely better than a reference amd cooler . 
  i 'm just wondering about your flair . 
  what are you running in qemu ? 
  ubuntu as host , windowses in qemu with gpu passthru ? 
  me too . 
  r9 nano here . 
  went from 1920x1080 to 3840x2160 . 
  took some time to get used to , but it 's fucking glorious . 
  everything 's so sharp and clear :'), 
  what voltage ? 
  got my 8320 to 4.7 ghz with 1.368 v , never went over 60 \u00b0 c with an aircooler . 
  there was a technical preview . 
  980ti is made for 4k tho :d, 
  atleast they are quiet :p, 
  fat32 because everything supports it . 
  yo mama 's so fat , she can only handle 4gb files, 
  i know a guy who had an fx-8350 and 16gb of ecc ram . 
  28gb total for me . 
  i wish i could see it . 
  eyyy keyboard bros, 
  anti-adblock killer ? 
  / r/linuxmasterrace, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ prepares ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ butthole ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ downvotes, 
  it does . 
  i have it but i 'm too dumb to play it . 
  never played simcity as a kid : /, 
  friends ?
