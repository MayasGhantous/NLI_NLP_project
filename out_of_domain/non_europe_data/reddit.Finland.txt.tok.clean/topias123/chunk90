  hope it 's cooler is better than my msi r9 290 . 
  shine 3 here . 
  white bl and mx blues . 
  really need to clean it though ... 
  my corsair kit did n't . 
  yep , fx-6300 is a very strong budget cpu . 
  catalyst should perform much better , but it has ugly tearing and is buggy . 
  i upgraded from an fx-8320 to a 1231v3 . 
  i say it 's not worth it . 
  just overclock that chip as high as you can . 
  the xeon gets only 20 points more in cb than my 8320 at 4.7 ghz . 
  yup . 
  running one with an asus h97-plus . 
  i just wish i got a z97 ... h97 has no xfire support :(, 
  i 've never had to contact their customer support . 
  how bad is it ? 
  i wish there were 4k ultrawides . 
  not swapping my u28d590d until then . 
  i do n't think it 's worth it to upgrade from a decent apu . 
  just overclock it , maybe disable igp . 
  i upgraded from an fx-8320 to an e3-1231v3 , very few games saw a framerate boost . 
  i5-4440 , $ 150 or so . 
  i 'm still gon na say , do n't upgrade the cpu . 
  just overclock it and it 'll be fine . 
  not that many games see a huge benefit from upgrading to intel . 
  the apu also has better ipc than piledriver ... 
  i still think it 's not worth it to upgrade . 
  in the games i play , only some got a framerate boost . 
  mainly ets2 and minecraft , which i do n't play very often anyway ... 
  most games wo n't use 8 cores anyway , 4 max ... 
  yeah but i play at 4k ... 
  single gpu can play , but not that well . 
  fx-6300 is a really good cpu tho . 
  uhh ... lpx or something . 
  i always thought ddg is confusing . 
  try 120gb lol . 
  that 's real pain . 
  ca n't you force vsync off via driver control center ? 
  would n't bottom be best ? 
  it 'd get it 's own fresh air . 
  well i do n't have one so i dunno . 
  i got an r9 nano , was cheap :p maybe watercool it at some point . 
  saying chipset is kinda wrong , because am4 chips will be socs . 
  you should watercool . 
  only time i tried antergos it did n't even boot . 
  i just go with legit arch always . 
  i have it . 
  best 6 $ ( ? ), 
  i ever spent . 
  i had an 8320 at 4.7 ghz . 
  was n't watercooled :d, 
  hope vulkan will become popular ... with valve supporting it , it 's possible . 
  why is having upnp activated a bad idea ? 
  i dunno , too used to google i guess . 
  i actually do have a massive noctua :d, 
  considering you 're running arch , very possible . 
  i personally ca n't see some characters in tf2 . 
  lennyfaces are missing their mouths and eyebrows . 
  maybe it has unique info , like mac address or serial number . 
  150/50 mbps for 25 $ / month . 
  it 's lte though , ping sucks . 
  and signal in my room , unfortunately ... 
  yeah it 's fine . 
  i have one too , in my laptop . 
  usb-otg + 1tb hdd, 
  i got one too . 
  they look so funny inside a huge case :d, 
  yep , cpu holding back . 
  i got about 8000 points in 3dmark with my old r9 290 and fx-8320 , swapping to a xeon brought it up to 11000 or so . 
  i can see them fine in browser though :p, 
  my reason was the same . 
  nano was 570 $ , cheapest fury 630 $ . 
  i do n't know ... 
  it just looks and feels weird to me . 
  the fx is a tiny bit faster , atleast according to cpuboss ... 
  i have 24gb of ram just so my os can cache everything into ram . 
  now overclock . 
  i think tv is a bit too big for desk use . 
  that 's why i got a 28 '' model . 
  yeah my v300 is about the same . 
  they are decent if you do n't need insane write speeds . 
  i got one in my laptop atm , works just fine , and linux boots really fast . 
  man ... 250gb drives are 100 $ where i live . 
  decent drives , i should add ( 850 evo ), 
  wtf is curse voice, 
  i only have 1 :'(, 
  nothing wrong with amd cards doe . 
  depends on fan . 
  my noctua is quiet until 1100rpm . 
  it performs very well though . 
  reaches 75 \u00b0 c with stock settings , 82 \u00b0 c with +30 % power target . 
  [ yeah ] ( http://www.3dmark.com/fs/7310715 ) , i think it hovered around 900-950mhz during that . 
  not in europe , atleast northern . 
  they are all over 400 $ here . 
  year ago they were about 300 $ though : /, 
  390x does n't have hbm . 
  only driver you need from disc is ethernet , get everything else online . 
  download it on smartphone and transfer it to pc ? 
  no it does not ... only top end cards atm . 
  i wonder the same too ...
