  studied ict at school , saw some pretty stupid stuff . 
  friend fried a motherboard by hotgluing a cmos battery holder back in , which he accidentally ripped off . 
  not all their models . 
  my butt used to hurt all the time before buying one , never after buying it . 
  comment totally not paid by ikea ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ srsly ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not, 
  403 forbidden, 
  f10 + enter in tf2, 
  how badly does it throttle ? 
  just like people who play on 8th gen consoles . 
  eyy i got a ducky, 
  do n't the latest nvidia tegras already outperform consoles ? 
  or atleast come very close . 
  i sit about 12 hours a day at my pc . 
  a good chair does a lot . 
  amd performance is probably crap , like usually ? 
  uhh , freon already has this : /, 
  i wish i knew how to play xcom . 
  hope the new driver model changes that . 
  grid autosport is unplayable , does n't even load : /, 
  running catalyst with kernel 4.4 here . 
  you can try to update your drivers . 
  [ link ] ( https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/2014/intelr-graphics-installer-1.0.5-linux ) for intel 's own updater tool . 
  just do n't be a retard and you 'll be fine . 
  i bought an r9 nano like ... 2 weeks ago . 
  can i get a free game from this ? 
  their verification thingy says `` your manufacturer is not valid '' . _ . 
  i 've had better luck with amd hackintoshing than intel . 
  i even got os x to run on an e-450 ... 
  but it refuses to even install on my xeon e3-1231v3 . 
  should have bought a 390x , as it 's about as fast as the gtx 980 . 
  r9 nano 's cooler is amazing for it 's size . 
  hope they learned something from that . 
  i just have 75 % :(, 
  elpida is owned by samsung i believe . 
  crap for overclocking . 
  mine got smaller . 
  r9 290 -  r9 nano, 
  390x is worth it if you can get one from sale . 
  xfx model was 430 $ here , whereas 390 's are 400 $ . 
  even the base game is a challenge for me . 
  actually no , it 's in an atx build ... reason for buying it was that it was on sale , 60 $ cheaper than an r9 fury . 
  not in my experience . 
  850-900mhz and 75 \u00b0 c on full load . 
  throttles at 85 \u00b0 c by default . 
  does n't thomann deliver to all of europe ? 
  they deliver to finland at least . 
  if you can get one for cheap . 
  it performs around the same as a normal fury or gtx 980 , get one if you do n't plan to overclock and if it 's cheaper than a normal fury . 
  [ mprime ] ( http://www.mersenne.org/download/ ) for stress test , [ lm_sensors ] ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/sensorinstallhowto ) for temp monitoring . 
  you can run ` watch sensors ` in a second terminal to monitor temps . 
  i prefer to not have a bridge at all . 
  amd masterrace, 
  i once saw a sniper 's kukri in tf2 named `` press g to pay respects '', 
  spilled coke on my logitech couple of times . 
  every time i just took it apart and rinsed it , let it dry . 
  still works and my brother uses it at school because laptop keyboards are junk . 
  what does it say ? 
  it 's alright for 20 $ . 
  never had issues with amd drivers lol, 
  kick them off the network . 
  buy a new one . 
  the one that comes with it is kinda crap anyway . 
  how did you manage that ? 
  r9 290 onwards do not . 
  install libcurl then ? 
  sucks that your dad does n't wan na learn . 
  mine learned how to use ubuntu in about 20 minutes :p, 
  yes . 
  you can choose which you want to install , or not install one altogether . 
  pretty much . 
  amd masterrace, 
  on my laptop , it 's unplayable on linux , but runs just fine on windows . 
  on my desktop it runs just fine on both . 
  valve games work just fine on amd in my experience , on both windows and linux . 
  i do n't think the bug affects fglrx . 
  put this into launch options : ` - windowed - noborder `, 
  both my laptop and desktop have amd graphics . 
  laptop has an apu+gpu , desktop has an intel cpu . 
  force it to be always on top ? 
  i always play in fullscreen mode anyway . 
  what 's hearthstone ? 
  my r9 290 was 94 \u00b0 c at 100 % fanspeed . 
  the truth is that windows is shit . 
  i always lock my pc when i do n't use it . 
  even at home when i 'm alone . 
  my laptop 's a8 only gets to 60 \u00b0 c , but it ai n't a hp :p, 
  oh god i had a similar laptop ... apu constantly at 70 \u00b0 c , fan made a fuckton of noise ... 
  and it was slower than my pentium 4 . 
  then again my current r9 nano sits at 75 \u00b0 c with 40 % fanspeed ... 
  * truth, 
  is [ this ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/backlight ) any help ? 
  or use cron on linux . 
  or you could join android masterrace . 
  finnish here , i pay for 150mb/s , getting 20-40 . 
  i do n't use edge because it only works on 1 os . 
  i want a browser that works on windows , linux , and android . 
  chrome has been the best for me . 
  i have n't had any issues with 4k though . 
  games work just fine , except sometimes they start on my second monitor , which is annoying . 
  my monitor is a single panel though , instead of the old mst hack .
