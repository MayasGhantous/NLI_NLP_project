  which radeon r9 card is it ? 
  it sounds like saying `` geforce gtx '' and expecting good answers :d, 
  ex-fx owner here . 
  i upgraded to intel a couple of months ago , and most games i tried saw no or minimal framerate improvement . 
  biggest boost was in minecraft , getting like 3x fps now . 
  gta v saw no difference . 
  my fx-8320 was overclocked to 4.7 ghz though ... 
  390 has a dedicated encoder too , ya know . 
  390 is better for northern people because it can heat up your room while gaming . 
  meanwhile i have n't had a driver issue on amd for 2-3 years . 
  8350 is a fine cpu . 
  people make it sound way worse than it is . 
  reading any user reviews almost makes me have an aneurysm . 
  especially fucking google play ... 
  kids complaining how a game lags on their 3 years old 50 $ samsung turd ... 
  to it 's defense , fury is made for 4k really . 
  have you cleaned it and repasted ? 
  fuck that . 
  ssd for life . 
  jimm 's is the best pc store . 
  it 's really fucking fast for a test chip . 
  b-but muh 4k, 
  my system ca n't handle higher than fxaa :(, 
  default amd drivers are really good now though . 
  it just worked out of the box for me . 
  my r9 nano throttles to 911mhz . 
  it did n't even run hot enough to melt steel memes . 
  it looks alright at 4k , at least in gta v. 
  rekd, 
  atleast amd has working open source drivers . 
  it 's true though . 
  radeonsi driver beats fglrx in many games nowadays . 
  it 's also way more stable . 
  strange . 
  my 4k and 1440p monitors work just fine . 
  lol no, 
  i changed to intel , ca n't see a big difference . 
  only minecraft got a performance boost , other games run just the same . 
  then again i run 4k so cpu bottlenecks are n't that bad . 
  i run that exact setup . 
  use some other connector ? 
  neither does linux . 
  now 's a good time to join / r/linuxmasterrace, 
  you do n't need to spend that much on a 4k rig . 
  an i5 or fx-8350 and an r9 fury can give you a good experience on high settings with no aa . 
  cpu ? 
  clean install on ssd . 
  dual monitor probly . 
  driver can overheat the card , or flash a faulty bios . 
  friend of mine runs it with a gt 640 , so yes . 
  or people could use working aircoolers instead of this junk . 
  good . 
  that shit is unstable as hell . 
  i traded mine for a laptop :(, 
  it was such a good binned chip too . 
  displayport masterrace, 
  i ca n't even set mine that low . 
  i usually use my mouse at 1500 dpi . 
  nvidia shuts it down in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  but nobody uses amd anyway . 
  edit : yay , downvoted for making a shitty joke, 
  probably feels the same as me with my 28 '' 2160p monitor . 
  my shine 3 is getting a bit old :(, 
  nh-d15 is dead silent too . 
  my cpu is multi locked so i can run the fan crazy slow , down to 200 rpm :p, 
  function over form . 
  idc if it looks bad , my case has no window c :, 
  shine 3 , blues , white bl . 
  amazing . 
  finnish/swedish ? 
  and i ca n't even run over 1600mhz memory . 
  there are lots of different gpus with different prices . 
  gaming gpus go from $ 100 all the way to $ 1000 . 
  i 'd recommend a gtx 750ti , it 's cheap and can play a lot of games at 1080p medium-high settings . 
  gt 210 is faster than my cpus integrated graphics . 
  was n't terrible when it was new tho . 
  i ca n't see it either . 
  could be because i 'm on mobile . 
  tfw no gf to get drunk with, 
  nope , u28d590d, 
  exactly : ^ ), 
  so just play in offline mode ? 
  it 's not an acceptable practice , but if you have already bought the game or gotten it with a gpu , play in offline . 
  and all of my stupid friends praise it for being a good os . 
  and my friends say `` windows 10 does n't drive anyone to using linux '', 
  i 'm still mainly a windows user . 
  games and amd graphics keep me away from linux :(, 
  not a 390 , but i got my old msi r9 290 to 1100/1450 mhz with no voltage or power limit increase . 
  quite a miracle , considering how bad the cooler is . 
  gpu core peaked at 94c , idled at 50c , vrms ran at 90c no matter of load . 
  not at work , but i used arch linux at school . 
  my study pc was n't bad :, 
  * amd phenom x2 unlocked to x4, 
  * 8gb ddr3, 
  * geforce gt610 ( but i swapped it for a hd 5570 for the couple last months ), 
  * 2x 7200rpm 500gb drives, 
  * 2x benq 1080p monitors , 24 '' and 27 '', 
  i never installed windows on it , as it was n't required and i found myself doing better on linux . 
  friend wants a new card , and he will upgrade to 1440p 144hz . 
  390x or fury ?
