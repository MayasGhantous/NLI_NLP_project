  so you 're saying everyone should be forced to update , like consoles already do ? 
  sucks that it 's cooler was so bad . 
  could have pushed it further probably if the cooler was n't garbage . 
  i play at 4k myself , it 's absolutely amazing . 
  it is ? 
  4820k maybe ? 
  then it should be an optional update . 
  not a recommended one . 
  i call them stupid because they are stupid . 
  i ca n't even oc my ram on a non-k cpu . 
  motherboard refuses to post if i set it higher than 1600mhz , no matter what timings or voltage . 
  but they still use shitty paste between ihs and chip . 
  indie games tend to actually work though . 
  tfw i use grub-efi because too retard to learn refind, 
  i was going to buy a u2515h , went for p2416d instead . 
  it 's alright , i use it as a secondary monitor . 
  ascended to 4k a year ago , stayed even though i was lacking in gpu power . 
  recently upgraded gpu , and i love it . 
  my r9 nano plays gta v on very high settings at 60fps . 
  i wish i could use it as my daily . 
  mainly games are keeping me on windows : /, 
  and amd drivers . 
  i 'm afraid there 's no solution for that ... fglrx is simply a piece of junk . 
  ducky shine 5 . 
  rest in peace fglrx , you wo n't be missed . 
  how big is the screen ? 
  that scaling looks hilariously huge on my 28 '' 4k monitor :p, 
  fiji chips are amazing for 4k though . 
  i have an r9 nano and it plays gta v on very high settings at 4k , 60-70 fps . 
  only downside is linux drivers ... amdgpu is still a wip , and catalyst is a piece of junk like always . 
  i 'm just hoping amd fixes their damn drivers , i 'd hate to change to green team . 
  i bought a dell p2416d . 
  bit pricey at 300 $ but makes a great secondary monitor . 
  inb4 fired for hacking, 
  you think i have the money for a titan x ? 
  i could barely afford this nano ... would have bought a 980ti if i had 150 $ extra though . 
  and the nano does n't thermal throttle , just tries to keep power consumption down . 
  you can max out power limit and it 'll run happily at 1ghz all day \\ ^ ^, 
  in my case :, 
  stock settings = 75 \u00b0 c , 40 % fanspeed, 
  +50 % power limit = 85 \u00b0 c at 60 % , or 75 \u00b0 c at 100 % fanspeed, 
  finnish people voluntarily stay in a hot room at up to 120 \u00b0 c. 
  i chicken out at over 80 \u00b0 c though : c, 
  do you own an r9 nano , sir ? 
  i 've had mine for about a month , and it does not throttle , even with raised power limit . 
  it does depend on the case and ventilation though , mine is in a full atx case . 
  i use radeon settings ( the new catalyst replacement ) , but afterburner should work . 
  it will increase heat output a ton , so prepare for more fan noise . 
  is that a surprise ? 
  because it 's one of the first links that comes up , and a lot of noobs will think it 's reliable ... 
  where ? 
  every 980ti in finland is 700 $ or more ... 
  shoulda kept my crt ... 
  i had one that could do only 75hz : /, 
  i get that with my intel too . 
  iirc bulldozer has 1 fpu per core , but it 's only capable of 128-bit precision . 
  i remember compiling java with an option that tells it to prefer 128-bit instead of 256 , sped up minecraft a lot . 
  or you could upgrade to 4k . 
  cpu bottleneck does n't matter as much at higher resolution . 
  not even e-atx , sucks . 
  no , get an ikea markus instead . 
  i ca n't be bothered to buy a dp -  vga adapter for it . 
  had an msi r9 290 . 
  loud and hot piece of junk . 
  what 's wrong with xfx ? 
  are there thinkpads with dedicated graphics ? 
  most i 've seen come with just intel igp . 
  mobile app notifies me usually about sales on my wishlisted games . 
  i heard xfx coolers are alright . 
  overall this cooler is better than aios . 
  more silent , more reliable , lower temps usually , cheaper . 
  only downside is that it 's fugly . 
  i did n't get yt red :(, 
  i think my country just gives money . 
  most people are smart enough to use it on actual food , but some just buy booze : /, 
  how well does that hd 6950 work on linux ? 
  my r9 290 worked quite well . 
  elitists ruin every community . 
  it 's not available in my country yet . 
  forgot about that :d, 
  have n't fully switched yet :(, 
  some of my games do n't work yet . 
  tf2 does n't work with open source drivers , and killing floor 2 is supposed to be ported when it comes out of early access . 
  being a dick just drives people back to using winderp or os x. 
  fglrx is still a buggy mess . 
  amdgpu works kinda well , at least on kernel 4.5 even with fiji cards . 
  after update , the driver seems to ignore my fan target completely and just shoots straight to 100 % : /, 
  i do have power target maxed though . 
  cheap chip , so maybe . 
  nope , with 16.3 my clockspeed seems fairly stable . 
  what about fiji ? 
  k m8, 
  right now only gen 3 ( gcn 1.2 ) , with experimental support for gcn 1.1 ( r9 290 and 390 ) . 
  planned to add support for gcn 1.0 too i heard . 
  the 290 worked fine , and amd was a bit low on funds , so they just refreshed it for a new line of cards . 
  285 is a kind of a proof that amd can do efficient cards too . 
  ( same speed as a 280x , but lower tdp and power usage ), 
  hmm ... got ta test my nano . 
  my 290 was 86 \u00b0 c with stock paste , 90 \u00b0 c when i repasted . 
  i do n't use afterburner to control it , i just set the target from control panel .
