  msi r9 290 ? 
  i had one for a year , overheating piece of junk . 
  you can achieve that with a single flagship card if you lower settings . 
  i think it 's like $ 1000 ( converted ) in finland , including shipping . 
  4-way crossfire time ? 
  so shit performance on amd again ? 
  it 's 1 generation too old to get support for amdgpu driver : /, 
  stop using a stock cooler . 
  it runs fine on my second desktop , which has :, 
  * intel core duo t2500, 
  * 2gb of ddr1, 
  * nvidia geforce 9400gt, 
  quite a supercomputer , right ? 
  overclocked ? 
  what memory leak ? 
  never noticed any , although i have 24gb of ddr3 so that might be why . 
  but you still ca n't disable mouse acceleration from the gui . 
  why ? 
  thought a 212 evo could handle more at lower temps . 
  i dunno why it 's slow on your pc , but it works just fine on mine . 
  even on my laptop with a crappy amd apu . 
  guess i 'll give it a go in vmware . 
  some people buy shiny new toys for fun . 
  i bought a 4k monitor even though i was fine with my crappy 1080p panel . 
  i 'd lower my overclock if i were you , at least until you can afford better fans :p, 
  so someone will make them work properly on amd now ? 
  \\  buying amd, 
  pls, 
  i had that same gpu . 
  overheated , even after repasting : /, 
  it was a fine overclocker though , 1100/1400mhz with no ov . 
  only some new cards have that fan-turn-off thing . 
  evga and msi at least do , but my xfx does n't ( probably because it 's amd reference ), 
  i do n't mind not having it , cooler idle temps and it 's still dead silent . 
  kentucky way is the only way . 
  they make only amd cards , and tend to have the best coolers . 
  kinda like evga for nvidia . 
  \\  msi, 
  you should have heard my last msi card . 
  t'was an r9 290 , overheated even after a repaste , and the fans were fucking noisy . 
  my r9 nano 's fan spins at 19 % at idle . 
  the fan is good , inaudible under 30 % , very quiet under 40 % . 
  usually spins at 40-50 % when gaming , quite pleasant considering how fucking tiny the card is . 
  90c vrm temp at idle is very healthy lol, 
  assburner worked fine with my 290 . 
  got mine to 1100/1400 mhz, 
  mine is in a midtower chassis though ... 
  it looks hilariously tiny inside a big case like define r4 :p, 
  with good airflow you can max out the power limit and it 'll run happily at 1ghz all day . 
  and that 's good , because linux is all about choice . 
  should n't limit users , even though some people have ... strong opinions about certain pieces of software . 
  and that 's why i use aircooling . 
  nh-d15 masterrace, 
  why not a polaris ? 
  but if one wants to use cancer , he/she should n't be blocked from doing so . 
  i dunno how current gen msi cards are , but their tf iv failed to cool my r9 290 adequately . 
  how do you use nvidia software with an amd card ? 
  i would be . 
  you can play at 4k with a single gpu . 
  an r9 fury ( x ) or gtx 980ti can easily handle high settings with no aa . 
  whoa , bigger than my gpu, 
  my v300 gets 450mb/s reads . _ . 
  390x is a fury now ? 
  i should clean my ducky :(, 
  i take resolution over ultra settings any day . 
  besides , fxaa has extremely little performance impact and looks fine at 4k imo . 
  go with an nh-d15 if you want a silent cooler . 
  what 's wrong with yaourt or gnome ? 
  i do n't understand hate towards yaourt . 
  i 've always used it , and it works fine . 
  mkay . 
  it always worked fine so i saw no reason to change . 
  i do n't mind using any of those . 
  nice username btw ( means `` dick in my eyesocket '' ), 
  i do n't mind having a cooler that 's difficult to ( un ) install , if it 's silent as balls and reliable . 
  yaourt -- noconfirm ( - s ) package, 
  i like using gnome , feels polished and runs fast . 
  i 'd like an n900 but the specs are low for modern standards . 
  and the damn resistive touchscreen ... 
  nokia pls make a modern model, 
  it 's because your gpu only has 3.5 gb vram ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i dunno , i 'm just feeling like trolling . 
  possibly it 's using vdpau on linux , but cpu decoding on windows ? 
  never had a need . 
  does op have an nvidia card ? 
  * xeon e3-1231v3, 
  * 24gb ddr3 1600mhz, 
  * asus h97-plus, 
  * xfx r9 nano, 
  * samsung u28d590d + dell p2416d, 
  * ducky shine 3 + logitech g602, 
  * 250gb ssd + 2tb hdd 5900rpm + 500gb hdd 7200rpm, 
  * shitty gaming headset , saving for beyerdynamic dt770 or dt990, 
  * arch linux + windows nsa edition, 
  i know , fiji cards perform poorly atm . 
  i 'm counting on amd on actually fixing their drivers this time . 
  currently i spend most of my time on windows though . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ dont ^ ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ ^ me, 
  it 'll run aaa games at 4k 60fps ... 
  i never noticed it . - .
