  it 's a trend to be an nvidia fanboy . 
  never had a need to modify a pkgbuild . 
  come back with better arguments . 
  yaourt works fine , and i 'm used to it . 
  i do n't even suspend , i just leave my pc running . 
  silent fans and cheap power ftw, 
  i have a 290 but not in use and planning to sell : /, 
  nano is quite loud though , but bearable . 
  max out the power limit , and it 'll run at 1ghz happily . 
  not available on arch yet , so no . 
  because most people just put their game on ultra without looking at settings . 
  one thing you definetely do not need at 4k is msaa . 
  disabling just that gives you 50-100 % more fps . 
  r9 390 if you can get one . 
  i 'm saving to buy dt770 pro . 
  fx-8320 at 1.368 v 4.7 ghz , never got over 60 \u00b0 c on air . 
  nahh it 's fine man . 
  huh . 
  i limited tf2 to 130 fps and it feels just as responsive as uncapped . 
  besides , fans do n't ramp up now . 
  60-65 \u00b0 c core , idling fan . 
  what ? 
  it works fine for me . 
  now get a high-end aircooler for that cpu . 
  hmm ... 
  it works fine with my apu + dgpu combo , not sure why not yours . 
  mine is older though , llano era ( a8-3520m + hd 6740g2 ), 
  tfw no onboard graphics, 
  why do people play at 4:3 still . _ . 
  use nvenc or amd vce in obs . 
  if you can afford a single flagship gpu ( r9 fury x or 980ti ) , you can play 4k easily . 
  2x r9 390 should play 4k fine too . 
  windows itself scales well , software not really . 
  one badly scaling software is steam . 
  no , because i was a cringey dumbass back then . 
  i may have too many 8 ), 
  `` corsair mx browns '', 
  you may have mixed the names a bit . 
  i use fxaa at 4k 8 ), 
  it 's not terrible but you should build one yourself : /, 
  if he wo n't play games on it , why such a highend system ? 
  i do n't mind paying for it . 
  opendns masterrace, 
  pacman - s xf86-video-amdgpu, 
  i think they are also for low noise . 
  even though they are a bit slow , i use mine for games and it 's fine lol, 
  i upgraded voluntarily on launch day : i, 
  right now only fiji and tonga fully , experimental for hawaii , will get support for all gcn cards eventually . 
  maybe i should get into csgo . 
  tf2 is getting kinda meh . 
  it 's closed source . 
  who knows that they 're doing . 
  and i 'm ( almost ) voluntarily using this shit . 
  i played dota 2 with an r9 290 . 
  60 fps at 2160p and maxed settings . 
  i never seed :(, 
  i 'm afraid that isp comes for my ass . 
   rendering in a vm is a pain in the ass, 
  kvm + pcie passthrough . 
  found an nvidia fanboy today , only arguments he had to defend the gtx 970 were shadowplay and lower heat output . 
  everyone uses obs with nvenc/vce anyway , and temps are n't that big of an issue unless you live in a hot place . 
  tfw finnish winter, 
  animations can be disabled m88, 
  i used a dvd drive to rip some ps2 games . 
  not entirely useless . 
  put an r9 290 in it and it 'll play 4k medium settings . 
  8800gt still plays crysis 2 at 720p . 
  old cards are n't that bad , especially for budget gamers . 
  would dt770 be good for a gamer who listens to metal ? 
  i 'm just wondering : <, 
  my current headset is a piece of shit , and falling apart despite being less than a year old . 
  and gets insanely uncomfortable after 4 hours of use . 
   philips fidelio x2, 
  300 $ , way outta my price range . 
  dt770 pro 80ohm is 140 $ . 
  sound is n't an issue . 
  that 's why i use mx blues :p, 
  mine does that too . 
  how 's that steam app ? 
  why no ram overclock ? 
  : o do n't see many people doing uhd wallpapers, 
  friend 's gtx 780 died a while ago , he bought a sapphire r9 fury to replace it and been very happy with it so far . 
  i recommend :p, 
  now xfx or sapphire should make a laptop with an i7 and an r9 nano :p, 
  only 1080p , not impressed . 
  tfw saw this a week ago, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ vessel ^ ^ ^ ^ ftw, 
   is n't using an intel processor sort of cheating, 
  well , amd cpus are kinda junk right now ... maybe when zen comes out . 
  seems like you hit the 3.5 gb limit : ^ ), 
  asrock 970m pro3 , if you need matx . 
  for atx , asus m5a99x r2, 
  got the same card , was cheaper than sapphire r9 fury at the time . 
  ultrawides are a scam if you ask me . 
  fucking 500 $ for a 2560x1080 monitor , you can get a 1440p monitor for cheaper lol, 
  cheapest i can find here is 530 $ ( 600 usd ), 
  mine 's 0.95 v with only chrome on . 
  could also be thermal pad ? 
  they have some oily stuff in them iirc, 
  edit : showed the pic to a friend , he said it could be just stuff leaking from the thermal pad .
