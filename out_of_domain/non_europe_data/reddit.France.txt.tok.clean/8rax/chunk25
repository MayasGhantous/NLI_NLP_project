  especially during summer hollidays for kids . 
  cool stuff bro !, 
  but i prefer that : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l-utl_cy2y, 
  i saw blindside last year , they are from belgium nah ? 
  ohh shit i am sorry , i was n't sure . 
  to not care, 
  that stephano usually does n't care about anything . 
  `` necro is a great crowd control hero '' , what ? 
  the only cc he has is his ulti who mini stuns . . 
  anyhow , you do n't call a hero `` crowd control hero '' when all he has is a ulti stun of 1,5 sec . 
  yes , we had secret meetings with our government to plan this out . 
  we were eating croissant , drinking wine and speaking about war , the usual friday night evening . 
  i was joking around  at first we were suposed to provide assistance and lead the african armies , then it escalated to actual strikes , and it 's getting more and more serious right now . 
  to be fair it all happened quite fast . 
  `` the french are not known for their greatness in battle i suppose , but perhaps they are looking to change that . '', 
  wtf dude , the french have terrorized europe for centuries ... 
  question is : who cares ? 
  answer : only those who try to dissrespect the french army and try to prove that we do n't know how to fight . 
  actually a chunk of the population in america believe that . 
  thanks to fox news and a bunch of politicians/journalists who thought it was smart to spit on the french . 
  same when i change the name of the dsfix dll . . 
  hello !, 
  thank you !, 
  when i do this :, 
  `` still not working ? 
  set everything as it normally should be via dsfix , then disable the dsfix completely ( put it in a folder somewhere -- dont delete it ) . 
  this includes getting rid of the d3d9.dll ( move it out of the folder or rename it to something else usch as d3d9.dllkaka ) . 
  for most people , this will have now helped you fixed your game '', 
  the game actually works , but i would like to use the dfix , so i guess there is somethiong wrong with my dsfix.ini ? 
  hello !, 
  thank you !, 
  i had already unlockfps 0 , the game works well when i disable the dsfix , so i guess there might be something wrong with my dsfix.ini ?
