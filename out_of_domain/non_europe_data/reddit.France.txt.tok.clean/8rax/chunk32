  thanks for the info !, 
  where can you get them by the way ? 
  burn, 
  how do you get this mount ? 
  i m also looking for nice hiking trails to do from now on to the end of winter , 
  what 's the point ? 
  real question here, 
  an extreme amount of american haters ? 
  that s surprising , i lived for 5 years in paris and didn t feel this at all . 
  care to explain why paris was a complete disappointment ? 
  be a douche , get angry when people are not nice to him, 
  perfect answer thanks a lot !, 
  i m doing as much skirmishes as i can we run a feral druid/priest disc, 
  thank you !, 
  i will make sure to get it !, 
  thanks , but i know that , i was just wondering if there were any tips on how to get those items . 
  like specific mobs that have a higher drop rate etc. . . 
  i didn t drop a single one from mobs in shadowmoon , talador , nagrand , frostfire , gorgrond ans spires of arak , 
  i am sad about the silence nerf on disc priests ... 2 second instead of 5 is kind of big : /, 
  can t fear and tendrils , it s one or the other ^ ^, 
  yeah well , it s only for shadow priests . 
  i think op was talking about discs . 
  but w/e to be honest . 
  the only thing i miss about this guy is seeing him lose . 
  for real , worst attitude in the whole scene , average player , calling every one shit . 
  i do n't know how he is in real life , but what he showed me during his active years of starcraft really makes me think he 's better gone . 
  really sorry if some of you like him , i m just saying my thoughts . 
  even then , france didn t get rekt in wwi , they won, 
  sadly enough , i happen to have a lot of north african/african contacts on my facebook ( played for a while in a sport team in the suburbs of paris ) and i did see this kind of thoughts poping around . 
  let 's be clear , not everyone , but some did blame it on the jews and supported this act . 
  this is ridiculous and as a frenchman i am not sure how to react to this . 
  the same contacts are posting all the time things about how western civilization and france destroyed their home countries because of slavery , how oppressed they feel in our society ... 
  in the same time i am working with two arab guys at work , in banking , i am sure they are not feeling left on the side of the road or `` stopped from success '', 
  thank you !, 
  it was a pleasure to do this video this week end , now that it is dark and cold where i live , 
  you mean , like , if it was expensive ? 
  if yes if was really cheap , the hostels where we stayed , the food , the drinks , the transports every thing was cheap compared to what we have in europe . 
  thanks a lot man , i was really happy to read your comment this morning !, 
  french women team is impressing, 
  yeah well , organizing a world cup is not about getting paid from fifa but rather :, 
  promotion of the country ,, 
  additional revenues from tourism linked to the world cup and, 
  developing infrastructures, 
  thank you very much , in fact i have a friend who have just started lask week the very same mba i want to do , so he will have the time to give me a honest feedback about it when he s done . . 
  in the mean time i will just save the cash . . 
  ca n't find it on my netflix , same as it s always sunny in philadelphia ... 
  does netflix has different programs in different countries ? 
  i am living in switzerland at the moment . 
  damn it . 
  is it due to licensing issues ? 
  polan lot of speaks no means to do it . 
  but someday maybe into space and maybe relevant . 
  this guy was not invited in paris after this month terrorist attacks , he still came last minute like he was on the list or something . 
  then he makes a speech at the paris town hall saying that `` he welcomes any jew that wants to leave france which is not safe to come to israel '' , now this . 
  what the fuck is wrong with him, 
  aaaaah finally some good ol' footwork . 
  lol rotns is a funny grp . 
  it 's a bit like a parody, 
  just a bunch of dudes who like japanese culture from the 80s and 90s and made a band around that `` furyo style street culture '' , 
  yeah no , just compare the numbers with france and uk , and compare the ability of deployment , it 's day and night . 
  france spent 2.2 in 2013, 
  just check wikipedia , sorry , maybe your studies did not include the gendarmerie spendings, 
  yeah i have no problem with that , but , especially today , war is not so much about the amount of tanks you can deploy . 
  i m not trying to denigrate the polish army , i was just saying that you can absolutely not consider it on par with the uk and french army . 
  about tanks , france and uk don t need them so much considering their geo political position , thus they are not spending so much in that area, 
  exactly , nowadays i have the impression that all over europe people are like `` fuck yeah come and get some '' while not having any means of defence . 
  if there were not uk and france i wonder how europe would be able to defend itself, 
  hey sorry for the time to answer , week end and all . 
  i will try to be explicit and fast . 
  ** budget ** :, 
  france : 39.1 billion, 
  poland : 9.65, 
  ** personnel ** :, 
  france : 215 000 + 98 000 gendarmerie, 
  poland : 120 000, 
  ** navy ** :, 
  france : has an aircraft carrier , nuclear submarines , 10 destroyers , 11 frigates ... 
  poland : 5 non nuclear submarines , 2 frigates . . 
  ** air force **, 
  as you said 216 to 112 aircrafts . 
  the rafale being one of the best aircrafts there is , beating grippen and typhonns in dog fighting etc. 
  i wo n't do a debate over this but trust me it 's a top of the art aircraft . 
  ** others **, 
  we compared some numbers , ok . 
  but here are some more factors :, 
  * technology : france produces herself most of it 's gear , no need to rely on foreign technology and perfect grip over the industry + research and development capabilities . 
  * special forces : well . 
  france has more , and i trust better trained and better supported commandos/special forces, 
  * nukes : france developed it 's own nuclear power . 
  * worldwide presence : france has military bases in multiple part of the world , presence in the pacific , in africa , in the indian ocean ... and can ( more or less ) deploy troops everywhere . 
  * experience : i am sorry to bring that up , but poland has no real experience in war with modern gear . 
  apart for it 's help in the war on terror in afghanistan and irak . 
  quick answer i gave to somebody else in this thread :, 
  hey sorry for the time to answer , week end and all . 
  i will try to be explicit and fast . 
  budget :, 
  france : 39.1 billion,
