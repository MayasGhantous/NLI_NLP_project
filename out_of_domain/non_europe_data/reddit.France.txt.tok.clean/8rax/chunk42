  hello everybody !, 
  i am currently organising my world tour on bicycle ( solo , sleeping in a tent ) . 
  i come from a martial arts/football background and i do n't have any knowledge about bikes , i know how a bike works but i do n't know the specifics . . 
  i am trying to chose a bike for my tour . 
  it needs to be solid , well built , reliable . 
  i read all the stuff that i can find online , i watch youtube videos and i narrowed my choice to two models :, 
  ** the koga worldtraveller 26 **, 
  ** the surly long haul trucker **, 
  and to a certain extent , i love the big tires of the pugsley , but i m not sure if this one is really suited to my project ... 
  what do you guys think ? 
  i planned my departure for 2015 so i have a lot of time to think about it , but the sooner i get the bike , the sooner i can start having fun with it !, 
  i would really appreciate any help i can get ,

  hello !, 
  i am training right now for a world tour on bike and i would like to post an article about it on my blog , and update it each time i end a training session ( ie : today i did 26km in 1 hour ) . 
  i was thinking about embeding an excel file , but maybe there are better options ? 
  more user friendly plugins that will display in a good way statistics about my training ? 
  thanks a lot !,

  i am currently riding a fixie to work and for country side rides and i was looking for a more complete bike to be faster and to be able to cover more distance for my long rides . 
  today i stumbled upon this used bike displayed in a second hand shop :, 
  the price is 1600 swiss franks which is around 1330 euros . 
  is it a good deal ? 
  i do n't know much about bike parts , but i heard that even only the wheels are worth around 900 euros ... somebody knows the brand/parts ? 
  thanks for any feedback , 
  hello ,, 
  i am not really a real beginner in lifting and exercizing as a whole , i train a lot for a few years now but i never really tried to optimize my sessions or train different body parts . 
  i am curious about how to maybe `` get the maximum '' of my training session . 
  this year i will have time to go regularly to the gym , 3 times a week , so i m just looking for raw advices on my training routine and how to improve it . 
  all my gym sessions are pretty mucht the same :, 
  * 5 * 10 benchpress, 
  * 5 * 10 inclined benchpress, 
  * 5 * 10 squats, 
  * 5 * 10 curls with each arm, 
  * 10-15mins abs, 
  * 5 * 10 cable machine with both arms ( 2 handle in both hands ), 
  * 5 * 10 cable machine ( rope that you pull down ), 
  what can i change ? 
  i m doing lot of cardio on the side i am just looking for advice for the lifting sessions . 
  hey , 2 of my friends talked me into trying wow with them for the new expension and to do 33 arena afterwards , i played a lot of healers on other mmo so i naturally decided to go for a healer type character here as well . 
  i got a 90 priest , i like it a lot so far , but i was just thinking about making a pally as well . 
  which is the best suited for arena ? 
  priest or pally ? 
  ( we will run a feral druid , hunter or dk and me as a healer ) . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  hello ,, 
  i just started wow to play arena as a priest with a buddy of mine , do you guys have any websites or videos with tips for arena ( general gameplay , addons , priest guides . . ) ? 
  i m trying to catch up as fast i can on how to play properly my priest . . 
  i think i will play disc , but i didn t tried holy yet . . 
  hey ,, 
  i ve been stuck for several days with the quest to restore the auctioneer in your garrison . 
  what is the best way to loot the items to restore him ? 
  i m running the dailys , doing some dungeons , trying to up my craft etc but i managed only to get one single piece during all of that ... 
  hello ,, 
  since august i m working in banking in switzerland on a luxembourguish contract and i finally make enough money to consider investing it . 
  i make something like 90000 euros after taxes . 
  since august last year i ve saved something like 20k , which can be considered as my emergency fund . 
  the thing is , i m currently thinking what to do with that money . 
  at the begining i was thinking about buying a first flat cash in a few months and renting it . 
  but considering the fact that i move a lot it 's kind of hard to deal with the flat hunt + there are risks that people do n't pay your rent or deteroriate your good . 
  now i am considering applying for an mba which will cost me 70k euros admission fees + cost of life for 1 year , so around 90k . 
  it is one of the top 5 mba 's in the world so i do hope that this investment will be worth it .
