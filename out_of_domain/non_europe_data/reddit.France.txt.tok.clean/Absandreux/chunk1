the ar in ar-15 does not refer to assault rifle , but to its brand , armalite . 
  assault rifle is not a real `` type of weapon '' , it 's at best an invented term to describe a machine gun or a selective fire arm with a military design . 
  oh my bad .

  i would n't call a lonely man , full of habits and , incidentally one of the greatest philosopher of western history , whose influence continues to permeate modern philosophy a `` pretentious cunt '' . 
  ( and btw , he was n't ) . 
  yeah but he was n't a pretentious cunt , he was kind of liked in his town . 
  but he was , like somebody say more of a namby-pamby .

  people say to me that a person being a helicopter is impossible and i 'm fucking retarded but i do n't care , i 'm beautiful . 
  i 'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades , 30mm cannons and amg-114 hellfire missiles on my body .

  c'est triste \u00e0 dire mais en france , si on demande constamment l'avis de la population , on ne construit plus rien . 
  they used to be the 7th , 8th , 9th and 10th months of the two first roman calendars , this is why they were called this way . 
  then came the third roman calendar , also known as julian calendar , which added january ( from the roman god janus ) and february ( from the latin : to purify ) as the 11th and 12th months . 
  and then , european country around the xvith started using gregorian calendar , which added leap years , and put january and february as the first two months . 
  anywhere can be `` nulle part '' ( if you mean anywhere as nowhere : `` i wo n't go anywhere until i 'm satisfied '' ) or `` n'importe o\u00f9 '' ( if you mean anywhere like you do n't mind where you 're going : `` where do you want to eat tonight ? '', 
  `` anywhere '' ), 
  what could he have done ? 
  it should be france having the scar role honestly . 
  even germany considered trying to make brexit soft or even not happening , but because french politicians are scared of the french nationalist party ( national front ) and of the possibility of a frexit , they want brexit to be as painful and chaotic as possible to say to their electors : `` see , this what happen if we leave the eu '' . 
  in wow . 
  when you go black , you never go back .

  actually it 's not the french system that screwed up , it 's the whole `` judiciary system '' and `` medical system '' . 
  what happened is that he was declared `` irresponsible '' for his crime , because he was mentally ill according to medical experts , so basically he was interned in a psychiatric hopsital and was n't condemned . 
  he was hospitalized in france and then his family wanted him to be in japan , which is understandable . 
  he 's a dangerous madman , but still a sick person . 
  but in japan , medical experts ordered a second expert assessment and was n't declared `` mentally irresponsible '' ( but still recognized as sick , but not sick enough to be irresponsible ) . 
  still , there 's a basic law rule , which is the `` non bis in idem '' rule , saying that you ca n't be judged twice for the same facts and because he was n't condemned by the french court , he could n't be judged by a japanese court . 
  source : french law student here , hope my english is understandable . 
  no `` double jeopardy '' is a basic law concept that exist in most national criminal laws and international laws treaties . 
  actually it depends on the criminal law of the different states . 
  french criminal law admit that a frenchman can be judged in france for crimes he committed abroad , and sometimes even if the crime is n't classified as one abroad ( ex : sexual tourism ) . 
  in fact , every country has its criminal law with their procedural rights , by in case of an `` abroad crime '' , the choice of the country judging the culprit mostly depends on international treaties and relationships between countries . 
  most common rule is : if the guy committed a crime abroad and the two countries have the same rules and the same guarantees of `` good justice '' , the country which `` hosted '' the crime is where the judgement will be conduct . 
  but for example france would never let one of its citizen be judged for a crime committed in a state of the us where the culprit could risk death penalty . 
  thanks !, 
  actually it is the country in which the culprit is imprisonned that have the power to transfer a prisoner to an abroad state . 
  but there are a lot of treaties and even without , just to keep good relationships , most countries trade prisoners except if they have a special policy about it ( i 'll give again the french example which is well known for the polanski case , france will never transfer a prisoner if he/she risk death penalty or torture in the country asking for the transfer ) . 
  wow , bravo . 
  nope .
