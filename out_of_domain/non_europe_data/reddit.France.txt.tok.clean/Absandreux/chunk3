  i was already surrendering of laugh to the comments . 
  so , me is wizard ? 
  me is wizard ? 
  most , if not all , smart people know that all middle-easterners are not arabs , muslims and have learn about the tension between all the communities in this part of the world . 
  people who hates you because you 're iranian are definitely dumbasses , but ... what can we do about it ? 
  idiots are everywhere and they 're in a permanent contest about who 's going to say the dumbest thing . 
  my cousins are iranians ( my uncle married an iranian woman when he was working there ) and they do n't give a shit about what people say . 
  both or my cousins are girls , obviously , because they still look like middle-easterners , they have had their share of racist and sexist insults . 
  they 're not believers , one is a lawyer and the other one a pharmacist , some people think they 're muslims , even if they do n't wear the veil ( except when they go to iran to see their `` iranic '' part of the family ) . 
  they just `` got over it '' , you know ? 
  obviously , they hate it and it annoys them and like everybody with a brain they would prefer that stupid people would learn to shut up , but they do n't really give a shit about it now that they have their own lives in their hands , etc. . .

  well any kind of racist and sexist insults a dumbass can say to a middle-easterner looking woman : either that she 's a slut or to go back home . 
  i 'm not a native speaker , but it was really good , your prompt is awesome . 
  nice one , i actually liked how war speak in capitals because war is definitely a brutal badass . 
  however , the only critical that comes instantly to my mind is that you were wrong about the name of the 4 horsemen : they are conquest , famine , war and death . 
  pestilence was created to remplace conquest in pop culture , because ... well because i do n't know ? 
  maybe conquest was n't edgy enough , but the antichrist riding a pale horse and using a bow seems pretty apocalyptic to me . 
  hey !, 
  i would like to say that i regret not buying this game before . 
  i had n't enough money and i had to chose between overwatch and battleborn , and people were already trashing the latter . 
  i bought the humble bundle , and i was wrong . 
  this game is really awesome and the community is very nice . 
  attention , on va t ` accuser de relayer la propagande capitaliste , technocrate et anti-d\u00e9mocratique pro-ue . 
  yeah , the two are really , really different and now that i tried both i do n't understand why people say that they look alike . 
  i think gearbox should n't had marketed battleborn in front of overwatch in a `` come at me bro ! '', 
  way , but had , instead , underlined the differences between the two games like `` overwatch ? 
  you mean , the game with no solo , no minions , no gear and absolutely no badasses ? 
  nothing to do with the empire , it 's because gallic counted from 20 to 20 and not from 10 to 10 like romans .

  do you really want us to go full empire mode again ? 
  do you really want that to happen ?

  it 's * libert\u00e9 * which means liberty/freedom and not * l\u00e9galit\u00e9 * which stands for legality . 
  but do n't worry , what we call liberal in europe is n't what you would call liberal in the us , it 's even the opposite ( do n't ask why or how , i do n't know but for example liberals are pro-weapons , pro-freedom of trade and industry and pro-capitalism and are usually more in favor of federated states than federal states , so from a european point of view , republicans are liberals , presidents like reagan were liberals ) .
