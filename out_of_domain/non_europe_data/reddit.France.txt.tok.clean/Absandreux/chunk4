  france has n't banned circumcision of male minors , even though it has banned excision . 
  however , circumcision of infants , without medical reasons , is frowned upon by most people . 
  except religious people . 
  if you want to be anti-semite , you can spread hate elsewhere . 
  i may be wrong , but i think farming the [ strange set ] ( http://mhgen.kiranico.com/armor/617-strange ) is a good idea to start with . 
  you forgot the case 10 which is the fucking special-snowflake-weeabo naming is character naruto , sasuke or natsu or whatever shit he/her is watching right now , who screams japanese shit or edgy-as-a-emo-teenager shit when he/she uses a weapons art and just fucking fling his/her greatsword around when the boss is dead thinking to be a badass , but making you unable to fucking carve it in the process . 
  farewell . 
  see you tomorrow though , do n't forget your daily dose of salt . 
  hey , i would like some help with my `` watch and learn '' quest , 
  `` that 's just a prank bro '', 
  lesliecheung switched to genji ( was mercy ) . 
  true , i 'm outright scared when i see an ally has picked widow . 
  oh , i forgot the passive effect of this map : give your team at least 1 widowmaker and 1 hanzo . 
  do n't worry they `` main '' them . 
  i do n't agree with your `` pubstomp picks '' . 
  winston is really squishy and reinhardt really relies to much on his team , even a great reinhardt will suffer a lot if his team is doing shit . 
  i would consider as tank roadhog if you can aim hook correctly as you can easily pick and kill a dps/healer and heal yourself if needed . 
  lucio seems to me the best all around healer to get some ranks . 
  it 's going to be painful , but just grit your teeth and play healer/tank if you need . 
  when you 'll be with people playing balanced comps , you 'll have time when you can play dps , but to climb stick to having a nice comp . 
  if you want to play dps , just get out of ranked , play a bit of unranked and then go back to tank in ranked . 
  attention .

  literally unplayable . 
  with games like empire earth , it 's going to be really difficult to find one . 
  i instantly thought about another jay . 
  at least his honest . 
  nope , no editing . 
  i just had a great laugh going on twitter , even if i knew that `` clem '' was n't really our ( but i did n't know it was a tv show ) . 
  please , i know my flair is loki , but deep inside i 'm a honest guy . 
  and we love our clem-entines too , 
  because we , french people , love the number ten . 
  we put it wherever and whenever we can .
