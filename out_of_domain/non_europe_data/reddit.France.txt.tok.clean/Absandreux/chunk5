  hey guys , i 'm new to the game and i have a few questions to get started !, 
  * i see there are already three sets of cards , so i was wondering if i should focus on one set when buying packs or if they were all equally good . 
  * are prebuild decks great to start with ? 
  are some of them utter crap that you would n't advise me to buy ? 
  * i really do n't know where to start when it comes to deck building , is there any good budget deck list or do you have any advice for deck building in shadowverse ? 
  * got sahaquiel , zirnitra and ( animated ) nephthys in my 30 packs , are they good ? 
  thanks for the answers , the game looks great and the community looks nice , 
  thanks for the answer , 
  fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric mitterand was suspected of engaging in sex tourism with young boys , talking in his `` fictionalized '' autobiography about prostitutes that were `` boys '' , `` lads '' , `` kids '' , and then later precisizing that they were all consenting adults .

  however , you should really pay attention to the position of your hands , especially the angle of your wrist . 
  your arms are really too close to the keyboard , which makes you bend your wrists in a wrong way . 
  if you do n't want to get tendinitis or damage your wrist , try to play further away from the keyboard , also your chair may be a bit too low .

  for non-french speaker ( hon hon hon ) , the catchphrase of the advertisment is : `` bananas and shells , on site or to take away '' . 
  i think it 's a really clever way to underline the fact that the nintendo switch is both a home console ( on site ) and a portable one ( to take away ) .

   no shit sherlock !!, 
  there is your translation . 
  because we do n't need to . 
  i need it to talk to you in english because nobody speaks swedish . 
  hell , swedish was n't even sweden official language until 2009 . 
  do you know how many people speak swedish on earth ? 
  apparently , according to wolframalpha , around 9 millions . 
  there 's more people in sweden than people that speak swedish . 
  this is how common your language is . 
  you know why ? 
  because even in your own country people do n't speak swedish . 
  not , let 's compare it to french , would you ? 
  there 's 274 million people speaking french . 
  people speak french in europe , in north america , in africa , in asia , in oceania . 
  we do n't need english because everything comes to us translated in our language . 
  movies are correctly dubbed , reviews and news sites are in english , people have places like reddit or other forums to speak french , we have great french singers , french writers and , most of the time , we even have french servers on video games . 
  when did you see a swede server for the last time on a multiplayer game ? 
  never . 
  because nobody speak swedish . 
  we use french for everything we do and this is why the culture of our contry has stayed strong . 
  if you only speak swedish in sweden , good luck for you having the last episode of your tv show dubbed on release , good luck for you having the last video game translated in your language . 
  we use french when we talk , we use french when we write and sign treaties , we use french when we buy stuff and when we sell stuff , we use french when we go at the cinema and we use french when we go abroad . 
  and it works .
