  was looking for the ama this morning . 
  it 's worrying to see it disapearded, 
  i was wondering if i 'd buy the game , because hey , it 's total war afterall !, 
  but nope , nope nope nope , i 'm just fucking download it , you fucked up again ca , you really fucked up . 
  never underestimate a user, 
  i bought every game they made until rome2 , that fucking game disapointed me on so many levels that i decided to wait next time they make one . 
  i waited , just to see that even before some patch , even before they corrected some bugs , they decided to sell a fucking dlc . 
  it 's not a important one , 3 faction , afterall , is quite nothing compared to the work they did on the game , but i wo n't be fooled again . 
  so i just download the game , play it for fucking free because rome2 was broken on many points , and wait for a -50 / -70 / -90 % . 
  then i 'll pay . 
  if you 're good with they behavior , good for you , i 'm not . 
  edit : faults because non native + edit : 3 factions , 3 greats factions that a whole new gameplay for sure, 
  here is a little map of the disctricts in lyon , i 'm actually living in the south of the 7th , the farthest you are from the center , the cheaper it will be ( with exceptions ), 
  [ here is the map of public transports in lyon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ynktlng.jpg ) ( without buses , they 're almost everywhere ) . 
  [ a link ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20150605/seven-ways-lyon-is-better-than-paris ) i found few days from here . 
  another one : [ only lyon ] ( http://www.onlylyon.com/en_gb/ ), 
  [ cost of living in lyon , france ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=france&amp;city=lyon ), 
  concerning prices , rent will be around 300 $ ( very very small - 1 person ) and 600/700 $ for a decent place with one bedroom , a living room and some space for closet & cie. fortunately it 's dynamic so you can find really good place at really good prices . 
  check around [ 600 ; 1100 ] $ for a nice place for two ore more , with space and shopping/transports just down the place . 
  i personnaly pay 580 $ for 35m \u00b2 with heating & hot water , transports and shops are just around ( 1 or 2 mins ), 
  the neighbourhood are old style when you gravitate around the center of the city , and tend to be more recent when you go further . 
  i suggest you to check the `` old lyon '' ( 5th district ) , i lived here , it 's just the most beautifull place of the city with `` croix-rousse '' . 
  do n't hesitate to navigate with street view , there 's for sure awseome places to be if you plan to be somewhere around . 
  edit : correction : old lyon is the 5th district , not the 3rd, 
  to my knowledge there 's no law against pets except for dangerous pets , like attack dogs,

  if you do n't want any troubles , just ask , but i never heard that a tenant could n't have or keep his pets ( except for protected/dangerous animals ), 
  edits : faults everywhere !, 
  as far as i know , we have a great grid of bicycles lanes , many people mix [ velo'v ] ( http://www.velov.grandlyon.com/?l=1 ) ( [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a9lo%27v ) ) and public transports , or their bike and public transport . 
  all the major axes have bicycles lanes , many streets too , so you wo n't be too annoyed if you plan to bike only . 
  it 's not as developed as amsterdam with bicycle highways but i can go everywhere with my bike . 
  unfortunately , there will always be some sreets with no bicycles lanes and some stupid drivers that wo n't pay attention , but it 's quite safe !, 
  edit : [ a link of the bicycles lanes in lyon ] ( http://carte.lavilleavelo.org/ ) , do n't know if it 's up to date, 
  edits : faults everywhere !, 
  note that you have ( as in the us ) a security deposit the landlord can keep if there 's any damages . 
  [ security deposit ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvosdroits.service-public.fr%2fparticuliers%2ff31269.xhtml&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  yeah , * se loger * is mainly used by agencies , it 's a central plateform for renting . 
  honoraire is a payment fee you 'll pay to the agency for providing you the service . 
  it 's the middleman between you and the owner . 
  every interactions will be with the agency , it provide you a better legal security . 
  they have the same legal obligations , but you 're usually safer with agencies than with owners . 
  it 's a one time payment , you 'll add the security deposit , and you 'll be good . 
  be aware about the * condominium fees * . 
  you have to ask if there 's condominium fees , and if they 're integrated to the rent ( displayed price ) or if you add them to the total ( they 're often hidden ) . 
  you 'll have to provide some documents : copy of your id card , copy of your work contract ( if you have one ) , copy of your last 3 pay slips , a document saying that you have a warrant if your pay is not enough for the agency ( usually , your rent must be equal or under of 1/3 of your total salary , that depend on the agency ; it 's not a problem if you have a cashable warrant ) . 
  [ here is a better explanation ] ( https://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.paruvendu.fr%2fimmobilier%2fi%2fles-justificatifs-a-fournir-pour-le-contrat-de-bail-i45&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  [ tenant candidate ] ( https://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvosdroits.service-public.fr%2fparticuliers%2fn292.xhtml&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  legal text , unpleasant to read , but worth it if you want to be safe . 
  hope it will help you , i invite you to ask someone who traveled , i do n't know how agencies react/work with foreign tenants !, 
  definitely this . 
  the way they treated you , during 18 years , and now that the little princess has left , they 're feeling alone and wonder about how the `` other one '' is doing . 
  because they ca n't pamper their favorite , they 're now feeling emptiness and solitude , and start to understand what you have experienced . 
  i would n't even call this man `` dad '' , he 's just an evil man and your mother too . 
  you therapist is going to suggest you to give a try , to check the alternatives in order to have a proper closure and eventually a happy ending ( for who ? 
  ) , i guess it 's his job , but all i see is that they did n't wanted you during 18years , and all of a sudden , they now want you in their life . 
  thank him for the truth , and tell him that they now have what they always wanted , ** only one girl **, 
  sorry for my poor english , but their behavior just enrage me, 
  ( thank you ), 
  nope , i 'm french and never seen this shit , only 30yo but same , this must be rare . 
  edit : even if it 's humor !, 
  i finished the game yesterday , i was looking for the books in order to forget about this beautifull game , i should wait a little before reading them i guess . 
  i 'm not ready for thoses feels, 
  when i 'm sick/not feeling well i do n't receive people at my house to `` watch tv and crash for the night '' . 
  dude come on , it 's fishy as hell . 
  one of the best metaphore i ever seen, 
  op keep us up to date please !, 
  this is the most effective , but not the cheapest , because [ automated mines ] ( http://aurorawiki.pentarch.org/index.php?title=mine ) cost the double of a traditional mine . 
  but they 're usefull because you ca n't create a manned colony on every planet for cheap . 
  how do you guys actually create space stations ? 
  i 'm slowly leaving sol and i 'm wondering how you `` do the thing '' to have a fonctionnal station ? 
  i found some info but thoses are quite old and i 'm not sure if the infos are up to date . 
  sorry for hijacking, 
  awesome , thank you !, 
  [ at first he died , now he dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni5j_yxuwlk ), 
  i started on with the same game ( alfapiomega ) , and alternate with [ quill18 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pls3acgygi1-srfrb4bpb-fbmvuvwikh92 ) . 
  for me : alfapiomega 's videos are interesting because he 's basically discovering the game with you , so you rapidly see what mistakes he made and what are the consequences . 
  quill18 is more `` pro '' et already knows a minimum , and what i `` dislike '' is that sometimes he goes a bit too fast and you could miss some ( little ) details . 
  i invite you to check both of them , if you have time . 
  will check yours too !, 
  basically you need a big , fuel efficient , engine :, 
  [ here is how to proceed ] ( http://imgur.com/uxczek0 ) :, 
  * reduce the power / efficiency modifier to the minimum, 
  * increase the engine size until it become a commercial engine, 
  edit : think about big cargo planes , they 're big , designed for heavy mass , and are fuel efficient . 
  to the contrary , a fighter jet will have small but extremly powerfull engines , where speed/stealth are generally the first concern . 
  edit2 : not english , so errors !, 
  i hope !, 
  after 5 edits :d, 
  have something better to offer ? 
  do you want to know more ? 
  - i was thinkin ' we could do it the old-fashioned way . 
  - you mean ... * fluid transfer * ? 
  it would n't be a surprise , daesh is really good on social medias, 
  noob hijacking :, 
  how does enemy fleet usually engage you ? 
  the `` noisiest '' ship is the always the first target ? 
  awesome !,
