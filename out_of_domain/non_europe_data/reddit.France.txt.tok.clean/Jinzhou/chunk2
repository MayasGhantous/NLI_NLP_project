  late but :, 
  the french legion was not always a part of the main military army , at first they were an `` independant '' unit ( not directly under the command of the french army ) . 
  it changed when the legion + some of the main army tried to make a coup d'\u00e9tat in algeria in 1961 , following heavy casualties during algeria war . 
  they were ( still are ) disposable units because they 're not french until they leave the army , after at least 5 years in the legion , so they could die without many troubles in the public opinion . 
  after the pustch , they were integrated under the main command of the french army , in order to prevent this kind of events .

  i miss neocron, 
  so does the game is worth it ? 
  i loved the 3rd despite his so many bugs . 
  unfortunately i played on a pirated version for the 3rd , too much bugs to be acceptable for me . 
  will check my bank account and buy it as soon as possible ( waiting for stellaris atm ), 
  i 'm sad that they do n't have more fans , probably because of the bugs , too bad because i really enjoy this type of games, 
  hijacking the first question ( started the game yesterday ) :, 
  do you usually cook all you have then put it outiside or let the meat raw and cook it when you need it ? 
  sorry too hijack your comment , but does wood repop ? 
  i 'm not talking about stick , that seems to repop after a storm , but cedar woord or others ? 
  ( i just started the game yesterday , sorry if it has been ask before ), 
  great , i was planning to set in mystery lake for few days but was wondering if you were able to setle . 
  thank you , 
  thank you for the info , will do that tonight !, 
  please do n't imply the french in this , we have enough to do with our own fuckers !, 
  edit : implicate, 
  thank you for correcting me !, 
  i have one for 2 years now , it 's just ... beautifull , the morning after the first night i felt so god . 
  op , you should definitely buy one , it may not correct everything but i swear you 'll sleep so well, 
  thank you , but it was about the skin , not the water , sorry i was n't clear at all ... 
  thank you , but it was about the skin , not the water , sorry i was n't clear at all ... 
  thank you !, 
  it was about staying in a liquid , not about oxygenation , i was n't clear at all, 
  man chinese is a really fast spoken language, 
  first check for dust , i do n't know if it 's summer where you live , but i had this few years ago , it was the graphic card that was full of dust . 
  then , as you built it , i invite you to check if you have any components that could be a bit unplug and could make a contact failure ( sorry non native english here ) , higly improbable , but while you 're in , why not check, 
  try booting on safe mode , a virus could fuck you processor or something else ; if it does n't blue screen , then check for virus with differents softwares . 
  same , save a maximum data while you still can , you never know how bad it is until it 's too late . 
  if you have time , install a software to check the temperatures, 
  keep us updated !, 
  i started playing civ when i was really young , i actually learned a lot thanks to it , so it 's a good thing . 
  maybe try contacting our irish pubs in lyon , they may be a good help for you ( i guess the best option is to go and have a pint ) , you can also try the city hall too but i ca n't say if someone will be able to help you directly . 
  maybe ask the same question in r/france , you may have less info about lyon but more `` legal advice '' . 
  now you say it , it 's logical , thanks you u/serae & u/magnesus, 
  i could n't finish the game because of this feeling to be honest , and i played all the previous opus :(, 
  stupid is everywhere sadly, 
  we have many in my city too ( lyon , france ) , those are really awesome :, 
  [ many more ] ( http://dvalot.free.fr/pictures/fresques.htm ), 
  try posting in r/food and r/chicago maybe ( if it 's not done already ), 
  thought the same , maybe a mod ? 
  do cooking and then puting outside help about it ? 
  sorry noob taking the train late !, 
  i do n't know if the sun is realistic or not , but that could be awesome ( if not already implemented ) :, 
  so you can know where the north is during day and night, 
  if [ this website ] ( http://www.military-today.com/artillery/caesar.htm ) is right , caesar max range is 42km down to 34 when using anti-tank ammo . 
  it 's the west who never accepted the differences with russia , yes it 's a dictator like , yes there 's many things wrong , but it 's not our role to define what others nations think & do, 
  yes president hollande made a beautifull mistake , and now it 's backfiring , i hope trump will treat him the same way holland did , justiceporn style, 
  me neither to be honest , they 're shooting artillery shell with the [ caesar ] ( http://www.military-today.com/artillery/caesar.htm ) . 
  i do n't know about the shell itself . 
  honeslty i do n't know , but it 's one of the officals channels of the french army , so i suppose it 's true , the caesar has a good rate of fire , and can load anti tank munitions , plus the thechnoligie is close , it could be french . 
  if you can check the truth i 'm here , 
  yes they are :,

  as i said to u/relax _ its_fine , i honestly do n't know , but official channel , and the caesar has a good rate of fire , so i do n't know, 
  nowhere in the videos , but there was some news about it :,

  because they 're only providing support ( intel/training/artillery ) , and they only put 4 caesars . 
  they 're working with the us , which has anti-air weapons ( at 1:28 ) :,

  france already closed a lot of coals power plants , the problem is that they did not replace them by other sources of power . 
  there is still a lot of nuclear plants , but there 's a problem with a piece used in the reactor , that means a lot of plants will be close this winter and every body is panicking now,

  insta edit : link is for 2015 , ca n't find numbers for 2016, 
  probably add the fact that some people bought the game and never played it again, 
  it 's a 150 days character , seems pretty normal to me ? 
  could n't say , maybe he did n't find one ?
