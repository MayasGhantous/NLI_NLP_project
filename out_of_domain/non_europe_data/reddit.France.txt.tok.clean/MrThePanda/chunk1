hi , the same [ uncensored video on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkcvq1ltrim ) for those who want it . 
  same video from paris with no cut : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkcvq1ltrim nsfw, 
  your comment should be at the top since reddit do n't bother to understand that european 's laws and culture are totally different than in us . 
  what about hungary and balkan countries ? 
  actually , many media use past photos to illustrate this news . 
  it could still works , the company could check with air traffic control if the plane has changed his flight path or make further investigation before opening . 
  and in the case of this germanwings crash , air traffic control was aware of something wrong and even a jet fighter had scrambled , so this idea would have worked . 
  [ or a barret .50 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0abgijwigbc&amp;start=15 ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wax875jatoc i recommend to watch the whole video . 
  wow . 
  how a swiss association , with a papua new guinean , a bahraini , a paraguayan and another one from cayman islands as vice-presidents can be link to any kind of corruption scandal ? 
  frankly , it really surprises me . 
  itt : random reddit users defending the well-known honest company monsanto with reliable and unbiased works founded or made by the company itself . 
  may i 'm wrong , but you forgot china ? 
  since sharehollders receive dividend from profits , who will receive those billions and how ? 
  so basically they are just fleeing from an imminent attack prepared by ypg and fsa against isis ? 
  and i do n't think they are ok to be forced by isis to come back in tal abyad . 
  so we do n't have to worry . 
  let 's spend millions to monitor all of those mosque and hope that their number will decrease by themselves ... 
  the overlord is awesome !, 
  and i really like those protoss 's buildings . 
  it 's a really good work !, 
  maybe one day they will understand that they really need land registry ( cadastre ) ... 
  and in 2016 , you will have the original choice between jeb bush and hillary clinton ... 
  because redditors prefer circlejerking than making arguments and make a proper discussion ... 
  also , it looks like the punishement is not `` incompressible '' so she will have 3 months first year + 2 months for each year = 19 months removed thanks to `` good behavior during jail time '' . 
  but their also another lenient system that remove 3 months of prison each year so 27 months in this case . 
  finally she will probably spend 5 year and 2 months in prison ( 108-3-2x8-3x9 = 62 months ) . 
  but because she has already spent 2 years in prison she will be free in 3 years . 
  that how justice is served in france ...

  unfortunately it 's still too long , so she can also apply to `` conditional release '' after half of the jailtime ( ofc not the 9 years but the 5 years ) . 
  finally ** she can be realeased in months ** . 
  that 's how justice is served in france ...

  there is only one way to be sure / r/rateme, 
  they give a special 3ds which can not play games and they register your id ( [ source ] ( http://www.numerama.com/magazine/20972-le-louvre-choisit-des-nintendo-3ds-pour-remplacer-les-audioguides.html ) ) . 
  if i remember correctly usa fires hundred of tomahawk missiles at libya soil . 
  even if it was the will of sarkozy and bernard-henry levil to get rid of kadhafi , usa has participated in this mess . 
  it reminds me the memento park in hungary where they keep statues of the communist period . 
  imo , it 's important to keep proof of the past even if it was bad , so people can realised how it was and do n't deny it . 
  from what i understand , as always , no one here read the article and go crazy . 
  actually she just gave her personnal opinion in an interview about marriage where she also says `` and wherever we still find discrimination , we will continue to dismantle it '' . 
  but better read only one quote out of contex ( gj op ) . 
  [ compilations of her are the best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zornt7pgvgg ) ( \u25d5 \u203f \u25d5 \u273f ), 
  i guess it means unreported when it occured , but when you have send money and cartel do n't send back your daughter after 2 months ( porbably dead ) , you report it ... 
  you 're right . 
  they have to pay for the other soldier 's action and they are brown so their live does n't count / s, 
  damn !, 
  this lip biting from seolhyun at the start !, 
  it looks like most of them speak english so that 's another reason for them to leave france for uk . 
  i just get a similar issue this week . 
  i have cleared cache , temp files , etc but the chat keep loading in firefox and ie . 
  finnally it was avast who was blocking the chat ( why ?? ) . 
  so i fully updated it ( both software and virus database ) and now it works . 
  in this [ video of afp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nnzp1kf5xa ) you can see at 0:15 the same building from the other side ( it 's the same road at the bottom ) . 
  and it seems that he does n't have major damages but the shockwave + heat may have kill people inside . 
  by the way , the current death toll is strangely very low . 
  for those who wonder , the car is a mitsuoka dore ( \ubbf8\ucbd4\uc624\uce74 \ub3c4\uc624\ub77c ) which was exposed during the 2015 seoul motor show ( [ link ] ( http://www.dailycar.co.kr/content/news.html?type=view&amp;autoid=20134 ) ) . 
  actually taxis , delivery vehicles , buses , cars of parisians living in concerned areas will be allowed ( not all paris will be ` car-free ' ) . 
  so it seems that other drivers will just have to avoid the center of paris . 
  i pretty much like [ the thieves ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2330866/ ) , a korean movie with some fun and suspense . 
  i have a question . 
  at the beginning , when ` zaardon ' drinks the blue chemical substance , the guy in front of him is theo galavan and he seems to be the/a joker ( purple suit , pale face , geen hair ) or am i mistaken and daltonist ? 
  but one of them is still idetified as a refugee ... 
  just to avoid any misunderstanding , whate you see on the picture is one of them holding a flare , there is no fire . 
  and no one has thrown a molotov . 
  it depends , some western media mention the king of saudia and ian cameron , while [ others like usatoday just list them and put putin everywhere ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/04/secret-panamapapers-files-who-did-what/82599656/ ) while mentioning :, 
   russian president vladimir putin 's name does not appear on any of the records published sunday, 
  a swiss institution with an executive committee composed of members from panama , turks and caicos islands , bahrain and cyprus . 
  well that 's was unexpected . 
  just for information , in 1968 ( 15 year after the armistice ) , 31 north korean commandos attempted to raid the blue house . 
  they managed to cross the border , but were stopped at a checkpoint near the presidential residence after a firefight broke out . 
  some tried to flee but they were all killed . 
  also they killed 26 south korean and 4 americans during the raid . 
  i doubt they can do this again . 
  they would need to build another tunnel without gegtting cauht . 
  recently , the [ spacex falcon 9 landing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=symqqn_zsys ) . 
  you are reversing the situation . 
  in october 2015 , an anti-terrorist judge said something like this and look what happened a month later . 
  then the government push ` restrictive laws ' because they are the only response that looks strong and does n't hurt minorities or religion . 
  ( they renounce in stripping citizenship from terrorists ),

   several have been accused of using legal methods to minimise their tax bills . 
  who the fuck wrote this ? 
  french here , an investigation has been opened after a complaint was made by the french tax administration . 
  google is accused of `` aggravated fiscal fraud and aggravated money laundering in organized gang '' . 
  also `` the inquiry aims to check if google ireland ltd owns a stable facility in france and if , with not reporting a part of his activity on the french territory , it defaults on its bonds , in the name of corporation tax and value added tax '' .

  i remember a footage of spetsnaz ( i guess ) advancing in a devastated school and throwing grenades to clear rooms . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was during this war but could n't find it ( i tried this sub , liveleak and yt ) , does anyone have a link to this video ? 
  thanks , it is this one .
