  that video is creepy as fuck . 
  fair point , but the guy i was talking to was calling to a partition of the country , and i 've had one other russian personn telling me the same thing . 
  hence my reaction . 
  ah yes , the stupid people who would n't know what to do with freedom . 
  thank god putin is here !, 
  ( just out of curiosity : do you count yourself in those people who do n't need freedom ? ), 
  not mixing this into current politics and despite the fact that , fortunaly , the soviet troops did n't get to france , i 'll raise my glass to the greatest army of world war 2 and the huge sacrifices of the common soviet soldier . 
  well , as long as you never complain about the direction your country is taking , or about the people leading it , then your position is fine . 
  good guy russia : knows that political tensions are the best motivations to fund space technologies , accepts the role of the bad guy to make science progress . 
  yeah , i knew this was going to come , 
  there is n't a single good source to understand a country . 
  and anyway , personnally , i do n't even have the language level to understand any political bias . 
  apart from a few things , watching \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c or \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f 24 is pretty much the same thing for me . 
  \u0414\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c is just better because it has the transcript . 
  yes , i know that . 
  however , i do n't think that most russian learners ( most of them being american because this is reddit ) also have the political views of most russians . 
  if you wish for more accuracy , here 's the results from the 2010 poll :, 
  - russians : 80,9 %, 
  - tatars : 3,87 %, 
  all the other minorities ( 16 of them on the table i have under my eyes ) are under 1 % . 
  i am absolutely amazed by russia 's actions . 
  from a cold point of view , it 's amazing . 
  it 's going to be taught in intelligence schools for the years to come . 
  the propaganda war is especially amazing . 
  that russia can keep pushing the `` peaceful protesters '' rethoric even though separatism is actually a crime in russia , and even though russian authorities have used their army to crush down separatists before and even though those `` peaceful protesters '' shot down 2 ukrainian helicopters using fucking manpads ... incredible . 
  russia managed to play on the fear of the people from eastern ukrain in a magistral way . 
  result being that currently , eastern ukrain is n't russian territory , but it 's definitely not ukrainian territory either . 
  it 's like watching a car crash in slow motion : you know exactly what 's going to happen but there is n't anything that can be done against it .

   of course it 's also throwing an interesting contrast on how utterly rejected and outdated these tactics are now . 
  absolutely nobody in any nation is buying russia 's story . 
  but * it does n't matter * . 
  that 's what 's amazing . 
  it 's like with the little green men in crimea . 
  yes , everybody knew there were russian soldiers , but it still worked . 
  in the case of eastern ukraine , the propaganda is working on the only important people , the one who are actually being targeted by this propaganda : russians , and people in eastern ukraine . 
  who gives a fuck if the westerners do n't believe it ? 
  they are n't the one the kremlin is trying to convince . 
  almost every report i 've seen on the french public and private tv channels were mentionning that the majority of the locals supported separatists . 
  welll ... 
  i 'd say it 's more complicated than that . 
  yes , every poll shows that the majority of people do n't want to join russia , but also that the majority of them are really afraid/really hate the people currently in power in kiev . 
  what an awesome collection . 
  just out of curiosity , how old are you ? 
  to be honest , russian colonization was much , much less violent that american colonization . 
  i was mostly thinking of the colonization of siberia and forgot about the caucasus . 
  but even that event seems less violent than american colonization : they basically expelled them , and many died in the process . 
  nothing to be proud of , but very far from the massacres commited by americans . 
  god i would love to see a badhistory review of this game . 
  russian military as a whole as not yet modernized . 
  what we saw in crimea were special forces and marines , and what we see here are elite interventions units . 
  but most of the army still has obsolete equipment , and their navy is in a terrible shape . 
  of course , this is bound to change in the next few years given the will of the political power . 
  except for the navy , that 's going to take decades to modernize . 
  [ violent accrochage en centrafrique ( actualis\u00e9 ) ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/blog/secret-defense/violent-accrochage-en-centrafrique-actualise-12007 ), 
   the sangaris force was involved this monday in a violent skirmish in the north-western part of car . 
  the fighting lasted 3 hours , with no casualties on the french side . 
  according to the ema , the ennemies were `` predators '' , `` very agressive '' , who were probably more warlords trying to defend their territory rather than political forces like the seleka . 
  the ennemy was equiped with kalashnikovs , rpg-7 and 14,5 mm machineguns . 
  the french used their heavy weapons , eryx anti-tank missiles and 81mm mortars . 
  ultimately , the french called for a mirage 2000 who dropped a gbu-12 bomb . 
  the fighting ended with the night , and did n't start again in the morning . 
  the troops engaged came from the gtia dragon , which comprises of units from the [ 12e cuir ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_cuirassier_regiment_ ( france ) , the [ rmt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9giment_de_marche_du_tchad ) and the [ 3\u00e8me rpima ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_marine_infantry_parachute_regiment ) . 
  ( rough translation ), 
  yes , i already watched that . 
  but the guy is so obviously pro-russian ( duh ) that it becomes badhistory , only on the other side .

  the nuclear option is pretty useful when you want to stay fully concentrated for an hour or two . 
  that 's really a great way to remember people who died . 
  really great . 
  and damn i miss piter . 
  ah ah , that 's a pretty awesome answer . 
  this is amazing . 
  thanks a lot . 
  the intro of that video was the most soviet thing i 've ever heard . 
  i have no idea what that is , but it looks awesome . 
  i find it fascinating that all those people are basically repeating the propaganda of german generals after the war , the `` the germany army was amazing , but hitler was an idiot and without him we would have won !! '', 
  that was meant to help the creation of a new german army by making it not so bad . 
  we can even see the other side of this propaganda , right in the same topic :, 
   i agree with the first half , but disagree with the second . 
  near the end of the war , the soviets were pumping out t-82s faster than the germans could destroy them . 
  they were also , for lack of a better word , completely insane . 
  it was n't uncommon for a russian soldier to strap a bomb on himself and dive under a tank . 
  in stalingrad they were fighting not only for every street , but even every floor . 
  there were literally buildings that had germans in the first three floors , and russians in the top two . 
  that , coupled with stalin 's willingness to throw men into the meat grinder till he got results would 've made german victory very unlikely even without hitler 's `` military brilliance . '', 
  oh yes , the good old `` the soviets were barbarians , wild animals and though our army was so much superior there were just too numerous and too crazy '' . 
  i find it fascinating that 20 years after the cold war , this propaganda is still so alive and well . 
  but well , at least i have n't seen on this topic the third point of this propaganda , which is `` the wermacht did nothing wrong , only the ss commited atrocities ! '' . 
  i guess it 's better than nothing . 
  yep , the germans were much better tacticians , had better equipment , their troops were much better trained and their nco much better too . 
  unfortunaly , they were n't better strategists , and they did n't have the industrial capacity needed . 
  the two most important thing in this war . 
  and as you said , it 's important to distinguish the soviets at the beginning and at the end of the war . 
  and that 's actually an incredible achievement that the ussr did , to manage to reform their army and end up with a very effective military while under the pressure of what was the greatest military force of the time . 
  the soviets were extremly , extremly resilient , that 's what their level of casualty show . 
  saying that they won only because they had more men to kill than the germans show a bad understanding of the conflict ( and , as i said , show the effectiveness of the post-war german and american propaganda ), 
  edit : for the record , i 'm not russian nor am i keen to glorify the ussr or the red army . 
  the fact that russia keeps denying the mass rapes that the soviets caused in germany is scandalous , for example .
