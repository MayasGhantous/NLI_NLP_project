  granted , in november you may start getting snow , which make the city liveable and even downright beautiful when the sky clears up . 
  but if it 's snow you want , i 'd rather go for the new year and party there . 
  you do realize moscow has one of the biggest muslim communities in europe , right ? 
  i mean , given your comments and your pseudonyme , that kind of seems to be your problem . 
  also , moscow is not safer than london . 
  it 's probably not less safe , though , they are both on the same scale . 
  forget my ignorance but : who is this guy ? 
  he seems to be everywhere on the runet . 
  edit : okay nevermind , googled the guy . 
  ukrainian investigative journalist who got asylum in europe and does n't support maidan revolution . 
  well you know , you mention paris , london et berlin ( three capitals ) , so i naturally concluded that you were planning on going to a big city and/or capital city . 
  in russia , that would be moscow ( or saint-petersburg ) . 
  so out of curiosity , where do you plan to travel in russia ? 
  this is terrible propaganda . 
  it 's so heavy-handed , you can basically only like it if you already agree with it . 
  this is not going to convince anyone . 
  the ussr made some great propaganda . 
  this is just something for russian teenagers to masturbate about . 
  there is still a very big difference between russia and western democracies :, 
  if tomorrow putin misses a step at the kremlin and break his neck , there will be a huge chaos in russia because putin has personnalized the power in russia , making every institution tied to him . 
  on the other hand , if the same thing happens to obama , well the vice-president will take the lead and then new elections will be organized . 
  end of story . 
  western democracies are far from perfect , but putin has made the russian state very weak . 
  as long as he is there , that 's not a problem . 
  but it 's still very dangerous . 
  i am very tall as well , but i have a different point of view . 
  i feel like , when you meet someone for the first time , you look for the easiest topic of conversation because you do n't know which topics you can talk about with this personn . 
  and when someone is tall , well it becomes the most obvious thing to talk about and , in the mind of the personn in front , it 's just the easiest way to start a conversation . 
  i mean ... if you consider all those who mention your height first in a conversation to be boring and stupid ... you must be really bitter and not like many people . 
  i just told you : it 's a conversation starter because it 's easy . 
  just like if you have a dog , it 's an easy conversation starter to mention the dog . 
  it 's used by some people but overall yeah , it 's pretty old-fashioned . 
  i 'm pretty sure even russian conservatives can read a chart and perfectly know that russia 's economic model relies mostly on export of raw materials . 
  the second is actually pretty funny imho , and i 'm not particularly fond of charlie hebdo . 
  grave . 
  even the rebels fighting isis are buying oil from isis . 
  because to fight , they need oil . 
  and isis has a monopoly on oil in the region . 
  it 's a crazy situation . 
  source : financial times just wrote a terrific article on the topic : http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/isis-oil/, 
  russia has some great `` minimalistic '' types flag , but i really enjoy moscow 's flag . 
  it 's just so badass . 
  also , an article by me on the topic : [ the stories behind some of russia 's greatest flags ] ( https://medium.com/@fabrice_deprez/the-stories-behind-some-of-russia-s-greatest-flags-a0c557ea6e6f#.it6tbvyhc ), 
  the idea that `` people are going to do it regardless '' actually is n't ( entirely ) true . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't have sources right now , but the fact is that having a gun in your house actually increase the risk of suicide . 
  and when you think about it , it makes sense . 
  a gun is so `` effective '' and so easy to use that you do n't have time to think it over . 
  you want to hang yourself , or overdose on pills ? 
  that 's something you have to prepare , to get ready for , it takes time and during that time you could very well decide that you do n't actually want to die . 
  it does n't work like that with a gun . 
  you feel like you want to die , maybe because you are depressed and this time you have drank too much , you take your gun , you are dead . 
  no preparation , no time to think it over and maybe change your decision . 
  there are statistics out there to corrobate this point , though i 'm afraid i do n't know where i last saw them . 
  yeah , i agree this is an interesting point on his part , and i could sort of agree with him for the instagram photos . 
  but the argument does n't work with the rastafarians ' photos . 
  so it seems the operation was in ingushetia , not dagestan . 
  you can find many other photos of the same operation and even a video here : https://vk.com/wall167026764_5868, 
  i do n't think the idea of de gaulle being the `` sword '' and p\u00e9tain the `` shield '' existed during the war , however . 
  rather , it was introduced as a line of defense by p\u00e9tain during his trial . 
  i also have never heard of a `` common idea '' among french people during the war about p\u00e9tain `` helping france libre '' . 
  so , i watched a video review because the principle of the thing seemed kinda cool , and i was left pretty disappointed . 
  please note : i 'm not american nor british , and the idea of an egg sandwhich for breakfast is weird to me . 
  i just do n't see how you could regularly eat this , it seems so ... blank ? 
  and it also seem that with this thing , you have no other choice , you ca n't really add anything ( or you have to cook it elsewhere ) , and i feel like this egg-sandwhich without anything must get old really quick . 
  does n't it ? 
  i admit i really like the idea , but it just seems really , really limited . 
  how long do japanese prisonners wait on average before being executed ? 
  i mean , i 've heard that american prisonners sometimes can stay years or even decades in death row before being executed , but it just seems insane that japanese prisonners would have to live in the conditions you describe that long . 
  ( do n't get me wrong : it 's insane no matter how long you endure it . 
  but it 's different if they endure it one week or ten years ), 
  the whole article is amazingly dumb , but i should point that his part about kerry as an example of silly americans who do n't bother to learn foreign languages is especially stupid : here is john kerry [ making a speech in fluent french ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcdxt31veyi ) . 
   the treaty of versailles truly fucked germany , and that 's why hitler rose to power . 
  this is a myth . 
  here are some explanations from the great people at r/askhistorians :, 
  - [ was it known or suspected that the treaty of versailles would lead to the economic collapse of post wwi germany ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2ethjc/was_it_known_or_suspected_that_the_treaty_of/ ), 
  - [ how harsh was the treaty of versailles to germany ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1kqp2b/how_harsh_was_the_treaty_of_versailles_to_germany/ ), 
  sure :,

  out of curiosity because i very often hear this from russians : what do you think should have been done about this `` illegal breakup of the ussr '' ? 
  but that would not have prevented the fall of the ussr , once every republic starts declaring its independance . 
  or do you think it would have had ? 
  of course it 's a matter of opinion , but most people will think that a camp system aiming at killing as many people as possible as quickly as possible is worse than a camp system that lead to the death of hundreds of thousands through forced labor . 
  that does n't mean the second is n't horrible . 
  well , to be honest the idea that most old russians are full of soviet nostalgia is very exaggerated as well . 
  it definitly exists , but you 'll also find plenty of people telling you stories of waiting hours for a single piece of bread . 
  well you do n't get it , but many people who lived throuh it ( it 's was n't just bread by the way but pretty much every item you needed to live ; not mentionning waiting years for a flat or just a car ) get it very well . 
   but it improved people 's living conditions far more than the monarchy or bourgeoise would 've, 
  you have no idea of this . 
  nobody knows . 
  i understood something about holding hands ... my russian sucks :(, 
  i did n't know that expression ( well , i heard it tons of times , i just did n't know that 's what it meant ) , thanks !, 
  ah ah yeah , i experienced this in odessa ( ukraine , but everybody speaks russian ) and it 's really surprising to hear a black guy speaking absolutely perfect russian . 
  found it !, 
  it seems the cube is supposed to show that the district is russia 's largest deposit of white marble . 
  so yeah , it 's a piece of marble . 
  [ here 's the complete explanation of the flag ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a4%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b3_%d0%95%d1%82%d0%ba%d1%83%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b9%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0 ) . 
  it 's in russian , but google translate works pretty well .
