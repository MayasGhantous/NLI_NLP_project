  i 'm so sick of people thinking being nuanced means justifying nazi atrocities ( `` nothing is black and white !!!!, 
  french guy living in saint petersburg here . 
  russia is safe , especially the big cities . 
  of course there are exceptions , the north caucasus is very dangerous for example , but saint petersburg there 's really nothing to worry about , it 's as safe as any european city . 
  yeah no , if this was in order to test ship detections capacities , they would not need to get so close to them . 
  to be fair they did call it `` inhuman and degrading treatment '' . 
  not sure why not torture though . 
  yeah , forget the geopolitical tensions , this is a godamn badass photo . 
  most likely answer is that this is a propaganda shot . 
  thank you for this fantastic answer , it answers basically every question i had . 
   russian foreign policy in this period was erratic and often inconsistent, 
  if it 's possible for you , can you give an example of this `` inconsistent '' foreign policy ? 
  julian assange said himself that he had told snowden to go to russia . 
  is there any indication that he was planning to `` continue onward '' ? 
  you , i believe you 're right . 
  but i also believe that , the second snowden got the authorization to live long-term in russia , you can consider he 's been working for the russian intelligence . 
  for russia to let snowden live there without throughly debrief him ( which mean make him spit out every bit of information he got , which mean collaborate with them ) would mean russia has the worst intelligence services in the world . 
  and well , they do n't . 
  i mean did he said himself where he was planning to go after moscow ? 
  okay my bad , i did n't understand that . 
  but why the hell would assange say that he told snowden to go to russia then ? 
  this is bullshit , by the way . 
  without even thinking about the moral question , the hypothermia experiments done by the nazis were absolutely terribly done , to the point that none of the data that came from this can be reliably used . 
  here is an article providing a review of the dachau hypothermia experiment from a purely scientific point of view : [ nazi science -- the dachau hypothermia experiments ] ( http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199005173222006 ), 
   this review of the dachau hypothermia experiments reveals critical shortcomings in scientific content and credibility . 
  the project was conducted without an orderly experimental protocol , with inadequate methods and an erratic execution . 
  the report is riddled with inconsistencies . 
  there is also evidence of data falsification and suggestions of fabrication . 
  many conclusions are not supported by the facts presented . 
  the flawed science is compounded by evidence that the director of the project showed a consistent pattern of dishonesty and deception in his professional as well as his personal life , thereby stripping the study of the last vestige of credibility . 
  on analysis , the dachau hypothermia study has all the ingredients of a scientific fraud , and rejection of the data on purely scientific grounds is inevitable . 
  they can not advance science or save human lives . 
  ( by the way , when the article say `` director of the project showed a consistent pattern of dishonesty and deception in his professional as well as his personal life '' , they mean that he was fucking nuts . 
  read the article , it 's insane . ), 
  ... ridiculous . 
  50 years ago maybe , but saying that nowadays the french high command sends foreign legion units on `` suicide mission '' is utter bullshit . 
  that they are used for more risky missions , sure . 
  but let 's not exaggerate . 
  are you joking ? 
  trump literally made a video saying that clinton would never be able to deal with `` the ennemies of america '' while showing a picture of putin at the same time .

  it 's kind of a dumb question , but would you know a link to a good explanation of why craniometry is bullshit ? 
  i know it is , and i can sort of see why , but i 'd be interested in reading more about its history , how it went from being considered real science to utter crap , and why is that the case .

  comment ? 
  bonne question ... 
  are you serious ? 
  the comment they are making fun here is wehraboo 101 : saying that on the day of victory against nazi germany we should remember soldiers of the german army ... really , what ? 
  also , that thing about `` making their families proud '' is the dumbest justification ever ... invading europe to make their family proud ? 
  really guys ? 
  yeah , at his heart this subreddit ( as hilarious as i find it ) is a circlejerk , so it does what all circlejerks do . 
  do you have an actual source saying it 's an ad for the economist ? 
  because i 've seen tons of people saying it was , but no actual proof , it seems the only thing that made people think that is the color scheme and the font . 
  was n't a cop but a soldier . 
  if someone has a link i 'd love to rewatch it , it was one of the most hilarious russia-related video i 've seen . 
  to be fair , women who know how to walk with heels absolutely do n't look like `` penguins '' . 
  the equivalent in french would be `` doc '' . 
  i do n't think the blame can be placed on him * at all * . 
  looking at this - insane - footage , he stayed calmed and followed the orders the soldiers gave him ( except the order to take a weapon , which was a good decision ) , which is how a good war reporter should act . 
  sure , his presence may have made the situation worse , but that does n't mean he did anything wrong himself . 
  and it 's not his fault the colombian army lacked proper intelligence about the presence of farc commander ( which seemed to be the major reason of the fuck-up ) .

  that 's pretty interesting ( in a `` that 's really dumb '' way ) .

  ridiculous stunts have been there since bf1942 , and it 's always been awesome and hilarious . 
  i think a guru is someone who says that , if you do exactly like he says , you will always succeed . 
  and if you did n't succeed , it 's because you did n't do exactly like he said . 
  there are people like this in the self-publishing scene , and they should definitely be avoided . 
  but there are also lots of people that give excellent advice while aknowledging that , at the very least , you need a good book to make it work and even then , it may not be enough . 
  caucasus * cough *, 
  no it does n't . 
  reddit absolutely loves saying that only the ss was bad and the wermacht were just `` normal soldiers '' but the fact is the wermacht was involved in a huge numbers of war crimes and yes , `` normal soldiers '' were definitely involved in this . 
  the clean wermacht myth is just that : a myth . 
  [ war crimes of the wehrmacht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht ), 
   i made a clear effort to distance any interpretation that indicated a `` clean wehrmacht '' myth, 
  well , when you say that kind of thing :, 
   any large military that participated in the war could , and would be , just as brutal as the ss in some instances, 
  that 's textook `` clean wermacht '' narrative . 
  especially since it 's objectively wrong : please , tell when the american army in europe burned entire villages , killing and raping the entire civilian population . 
  this ... is a slow clap with a cry on top .
