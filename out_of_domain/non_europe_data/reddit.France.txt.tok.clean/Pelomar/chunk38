  the problem is : media fuck up all the time . 
  contrary to what the article says , euractiv is n't an `` obscure website '' ; sure it 's not the new york times but it 's actually a pretty usual source when it comes to european affairs . 
  they do good work , from what i 've seen , and it 's definitely not your usual `` alternative media wake up sheeple '' that you see when it comes to russian propaganda . 
  see , media can and do fuck up , and that may be the case here . 
  because there is nothing to support the `` russian disinformation operation '' stance of the author of this piece . 
  it may be , but nothing in this article indicates so , which makes me thing the author does n't have any more information than you or me on this topic . 
  i find this growing habit of seeing moscow behind everything really worrying , firstly because it mirrors the paranoia that you see in russia , second because it makes russia look more powerful than it actually is . 
  of course , that 's the difficult part : russia definitely is very active . 
  but that does n't mean it 's behind everything and i would argue that claiming so plays into moscow 's hand . 
  the us presidential elections are a good example . 
  is russia meddling with them ? 
  most likely , yes . 
  is trump a kremlin agent as so many us outlets have seriously said ? 
  err , no . 
  side question : how reliable is anne applebaum ? 
  she 's a very prolific commentator in current politics related to russia and she 's obviously very strongly opposed to russia now and communism before , which makes me question her reliability as a historian . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  thank you for your opinion , i 'll definitely check her historical work then . 
  no way groland has the same budget as the onion . 
  `` our services are n't available right now, 
  we 're working to restore all services as soon as possible . 
  please check back soon . '', 
  bon . 
  fascinating ( especially the bit about `` marxist montage '' , never even thought of that !, 
  ) , thank you for this answer . 
  out of curiosity : if you buy the game now , will you get the full content without paying extra , or just the game as it was when it came out ? 
  because if you still have to pay $ 100 + to get the full experience , the argument of lack of content definitely still holds true . 
  awesome finds !, 
  i wrote an article about russian regional flags i particularly enjoy , you can check it out if the topic interests you : [ the stories behind some of russia 's greatest flags ] ( https://medium.com/@fabrice_deprez/the-stories-behind-some-of-russia-s-greatest-flags-a0c557ea6e6f#.ehukwdyrj ), 
  fun fact : we french pronounce `` fbi '' as english letters , but `` cia '' as french letters . 
  no idea why . 
  my guess is that `` cia '' feels kind of weird to say the `` english '' way for a french speaker , but `` fbi '' can be said with ease . 
  as if it was french letters . 
  it 's really only `` fbi '' that 's pronounced the english way , i think . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  do you know if those prepaid sim cards also have internet plans ? 
  thank for the website too !, 
  seems like a good place to start . 
  in that case , it 's an obviously posed photo-shoot , so the guy 's stare does n't mean much . 
  also : `` fils de pute '' in french is much more vulgar and insulting that `` son of a bitch '' in english ( which is kind of mild ) . 
  bof . 
  interesting , i would think of the ukrainian orthodox church as quite traditionnalist , but marriage `` classes '' seems very progressive . 
  did this happen in ukraine ? 
  that would explain it then . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  yeah basically . 
  if the guy is good , he can get incredible shots of people having just survived a huge explosion ( and escaped death ) . 
  much more interesting than a bunch of smoke . 
  reputation can be made from a single photo . 
  making a career is much more than that ( especially how difficult it is to actually make a living doing this ) . 
  i 'd love to read about lithuania in the holocaust . 
  i visited vilinius ' `` museum of victims of genocide '' a few weeks ago , and i was pretty shocked to discover that it did not mention the killing of lithuanian jews at all ( except for one , tiny room that seems to have been put there only to check a box ) . 
  i mean ... wow . 
  ( granted , there is also an holocaust museum which i unfortunaly did not visit ), 
  i do n't know if i should or should not have been shocked . 
  i was just having a walk in vilnius , saw the sign , and thought it would be interesting , so i came in based on the name of the museum . 
  my mistake for not doing the research beforehand i guess , but ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i still find it weird , to say the least . 
  why not just call it `` museum of soviet occupation '' ? 
  d'accccord . 
  fun . 
  yes , i realize the baltic countries have a specific perception of wwii and the ussr that a westerner ( like me ) does n't necessarily share . 
  i did n't know however that the holocaust was not reffered as a genocide , that explains it . 
  okay so that explains how i managed to ruin the pair i bought in six months ( as an office worker ... ) . 
  given the price i paid , i was pretty pissed off . 
  because the concept of `` super moon '' is bullshit , and it 's ridiculous that nasa is promoting it . 
  `` super moons '' are only very slightly bigger than the usual one , barely noticeable with naked eye . 
  it 's only photos that make it look `` super '' ( thanks to specific lenses ) , if you go out and look at the actual moon you 'll see it 's nothing ` super ' . 
  '' , je vais essayer de l'employer autant que possible maintenant . 
  you 're very probably right , but this is an opinion poll , i very highly doubt normal french people think in such geopolitical terms . 
  i would say it 's more a mix of a desire for a stronger europe and being less dependent from the us . 
  he 's either not french , or a french speaking english so well that he can write in french like an english guy with a poor understanding of french . 
  anyway . 
  is n't it already the case ? 
  ana and lucio are nearly must pick , mercy is still pretty solid , and zenyata can be good too ( not as the only healer of course ) . 
  ... because it was shot a few hours ago ? 
  there are many people in france who believe that the uk has never really wanted to be in the eu , has always stalled efforts to developp the eu , and that therefore them leaving the union is a good thing for the other countries . 
  not saying it 's true ( i do feel uk has never really been on board with the eu thing , but i 'm not sure at all it will be better with them out ) , but it 's definitely a common feeling . 
  frog legs does n't have any kind of particular taste ( really , `` like chicken '' ) and is really fucking hard to eat ( what with the small bone and all ) . 
  i have no idea why it 's such a famous french meal . 
  any interesting specificties of german law ? 
  how does the partition into federal entities play out in the legislation ? 
  america did not `` beat them '' . 
  germany never really got any close to actually having an atomic bomb . 
  it 's bad for him , but he 's not necessarily `` fucked '' . 
  this is one of the most uncertain elections we 've had in a long time , it 's really hard to predict what 's gon na happen . 
  it 's not , it was a sketch . 
  in russian it 's usually called podmoskove , which is something like `` outer moscow '' . 
  t'as le lien de la source originale ? 
  hyper improbable , mais ... 
  huh ? 
  i 've never seen any ads on pocket . 
  in `` the mask '' , there 's also a scene where he acts french in the us version and italian in the french one ( with quotes such as `` i 'll show you my big tower of pisa and shove my fork into your raviolis '' ahaha ), 
  spam-line wise , `` how embarassing '' is also pretty damn popular . 
  maquisards was the name of a specific `` branch '' of resistance fighters who were hiding and fighting in the `` maquis '' , that is in hard-to-access moutain regions or forests . 
  so i would say those who were mostly active in the cities ca n't be reffered as `` maquisards '' . 
  the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maquis_ ( world_war_ii ) ) gives a pretty good explanation . 
  huh ? 
  i 've been watching some esport recently and you see tons of tracers .
