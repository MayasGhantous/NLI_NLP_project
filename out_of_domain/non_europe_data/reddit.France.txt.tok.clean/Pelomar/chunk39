  i know esport is n't everything but if another character was just better for her role , they would probably use that character . 
  good vodka is really easy to drink . 
  it still has no real taste , but you can down it almost like water , which can be pretty sweet . 
  oh god yes this scene definitely stuck with me too . 
  i should read it again , i 'm really curious now as to what made this scene so memorable . 
  do they ? 
  he 's popular because people find him funny/entairtaining , not because they think he 's good . 
  to be fair , even in his time , swat was quite unique in this regard . 
  there were no such requirements in raven shield ( except avoid killing the hostages ) or other tactical shooters , as far as i remember . 
   cultural distinction of aquitaine, 
  i 'm curious what you mean by that . 
  i 'm from aquitaine and , huh , let 's say we do n't feel much of the british influence nowadays  ( well , except for old british people buying houses in dordogne ), 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  bordeaux became rich thanks to slave trade , not selling wine to england . 
  after doing some research ( i.e , wikipedia ) , bordeaux was the second biggest port for slave trade after nantes , but it also did a shitton of trade for various goods from the colonies . 
  so slave trade was n't the only reason the city became rich , though it still had a big role . 
  and bordeaux was important before , sure , but the modern bordeaux , the one you see today , most of it comes from that time as a slave trade hub . 
  c'est chiant \u00e0 expliquer , [ allez voir sur wikipedia ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_currency_unit ) . 
  the substitution is paying someone else to do it , of course , but most people ca n't afford that . 
  [ otranscribe ] ( http://otranscribe.com/ ) is a great free tool to facilitate transcription . 
  you can pause , come back a few seconds ( or more ) , slow down the speech and place timestamps very easily . 
   lafayette is a largely forgotten figure in modern france , remembered as an important , yet problematic figure for the shaping of france during the revolution . 
  do you have any sources on that ? 
  as a french dude , that does n't seem right at all . 
  lafayette is very well known for its role in the american revolution . 
  it 's his role in the french revolution that has been completely forgotten , but i would think an average french person know the name and that he took part in the american revolution . 
  was especially exciting since aktm ( it was him , right ? ), 
  was absolutely insane with that mccree , i was in awe . 
  yeah but no , not really . 
  russia may be massive , but they are n't really any accents in the russian language . 
  some variation maybe , and foreigners will speak russian very differently of course ( stalin 's russian was notoriously heavily accented ) but nothing similar to what you could see in the uk for xample . 
  okay , yes i did miss your point actually !, 
  and you might very well be right , if that 's the case it 's a really interesting creative device . 
  i dream of a tv show based on this book . 
  house of cards is child game compared to 90 's russia . 
  goodman already said the gun was too strong . 
  there 's ( almost ) no doubt current ptr mercy is going to be nerf before going live . 
  20s ult seems a bit ridiculous too . 
  and he has n't been getting those subscribers over a decade , however . 
  he 's been extremly niche for basically 90 % of his time on youtube , and exploded very recently . 
  firstly , sorry if i make a few mistakes , english is n't my native language . 
  i 'm about to start writing a detective fiction that would be set in new-york , just before the first world war . 
  and well , i would need a little background about how the police ( and especially the criminal/homicide divisions ) was working back then . 
  what their offices looked like , what was their standard procedures , what methods they used , what kind of technology they had , what kind of stuff they primarly dealt with ... anything really . 
  anything that could help to give a sense of authenticity ( so yeah , anything that is true ) . 
  except a wikipedia page i did n't find anything relevant so far , so i would be glad if some of you could show me good links or books about the subject . 
  thanks !, 
  i mean , the soviets were n't exactly the biggest fans of the tsar 's regim , so why would they called their biggest instrument of destruction after them ? 
  is there some kind of irony ? 
  or is it just the fact that `` tsar '' means something like `` chief '' in russian ? 
  a few weeks ago , a friend send me [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nczbusjk2q&list=fl_quc_zmnyuxlod5l9nfxma&index=5&feature=plpp_video ) , which i thought is great . 
  russian actually sounds really good in hip-hop and well , i 'd like to know more about russian hip-hop . 
  for instance : how the russian hip-hop scene ? 
  is it dynamic , with a lot of bands , or more underground ? 
  what are the most famous bands ? 
  and finally , what are bands/songs you really like ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  edit : in exchange , have some great [ french hip-hop ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tkdxc0gcto&feature=bfa&list=fl_quc_zmnyuxlod5l9nfxma ) . 
  yeah , right . 
  i 'm currently in st petersburg for a few months ( i 'm a student ) , and i 'd like to bring back a few books of classical russian litterature as a souvenir ( and maybe , in a few years , to actually read them ) . 
  so , i was wondering if you knew the adress of a bookshop in petersburg that sells nice editions of books from tolstoi , gogol , dostoievski , pouchkin ... 
  does n't matter if it 's a bit expensive . 
  thanks ,, 
  hey , r/russia !, 
  in order to keep learning russian , i 'd like to do more than the standard grammar exercises i do during my language lessons . 
  something i often do is watch gaming videos on youtube , where a guy basically comments a gameplay video of himself playing video games . 
  most famous examples include [ totalbiscuit ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/totalhalibut?feature=g-high-u ) , or [ lvlcap ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/levelcapgaming ) for bf3 . 
  my simple question is : does the same thing exist in russian ? 
  by `` the same thing '' , i mean guys talking in an interesting way over gameplay videos of various videogames , preferably fps or mainstream videogames ( bf3 , world of tanks , str in general ... ), 
  jules verne 's novels had ( and still have ) tremendous sucess and influence on literature and on the people 's perception of science . 
  but how other writers and critics of his time saw his work ? 
  did they recognized him as a great writer , or was he getting the same kind of treatment most science-fiction and fantasy writers get today ( that is , not being considered `` real '' literature and being generally looked down upon ) ? 
  hey , people from r/askhistorians, 
  so , i 've stumbled upon [ this article ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/05/29/the_bomb_didnt_beat_japan_nuclear_world_war_ii ) , and found it really interesting . 
  but i 'm not sure what to think about it , mostly because it contradicts the `` mainstream theory '' without a lot of facts or sources to back it up , and also because it forgets one of the biggest arguments about the bomb , which is that japan thought that the usa had a lot of more atomic bombs at their disposal , which would explain their surrender . 
  basically , i found the argument of the article convincing , but i 'd like to have the opinion of experts . 
  i 'm currently reading `` the art of war '' and i was wondering why , among the hundreds of thousands of military textbooks written in human history , it 's precisely this one who achieved such a large sucess . 
  i was also wondering since when it 's known in the west , if it was already well-know in asia before , and how did it come to be so famous in our contries . 
  [ tvrain.ru ] ( http://tvrain.ru/ ), 
  why , you ask ? 
  well , on their website , most of their articles are actually transcripts from what they broadcast . 
  they put first the video , and then the transcript of that video . 
  so you can watch the news and read them at the same time , which is pretty awesome . 
  i 've been trying to figure it out for a long time already , but i just ca n't . 
  when you talk about the duration of some thing , in which case do you '' \u0437\u0430 '' and when do you use '' \u043d\u0430 '' ? 
  the ukrainian conflict has kind of been fucking up the atmosphere of this sub , as i 'm sure everyone noticed . 
  so why not take a bit of fresh air and declare a week ( maybe just once , maybe every month until things settle down ) where all topics related to ukraine would be deleted ? 
  who knows , maybe that would allow to go back to less agressive discussions about other things . 
  though wikipedia mentions shell corporations as being sometimes used for legal purposes , i am thinkig of the shell corporations done for illegal purposes , such as laundering money or hiding in tax heavens . 
  what would be the oldest example of someone creating a fake companies for those purposes ? 
  and when did it became widespread ? 
  finally , i would be very interesting in literature regarding that topic . 
  was it any different than in western countries ? 
  were there any way the socialist ideology was influencing the way those investigations were done ? 
  for a time-frame , i was thinking of the time between the 70 's towards the end of the soviet union . 
  i 'm doing some work on russian newspapers and i 'm having real trouble translating this title , even when using translators :, 
  so i get that the second part is the source ( members of parliament ) and the topic ( `` about the threat of genocide in ukraine '' ) , but i 'm having trouble with the first part . 
  does something like `` russia will not be `` sentimental '' and will protect russians '' work ? 
  i 'm especially unsure about the translation for '' \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c '' , the translation google gives me seems very weird in that context . 
  an alternate question would be : `` do historians agree on whether the holodomor was done on purpose or was a result of bad management ? '',
