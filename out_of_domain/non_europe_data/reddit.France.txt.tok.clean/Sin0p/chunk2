  [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wciapi5.jpg ) is a picture of a stele in the memory of the moroccan division soldiers who fought in vimy ( northen france ) during wwi, 
  it reads : `` to the dead of the moroccan division , without fear , without mercy '', 
  `` in the memory of colonel pein , commander of the 1st brigade , colonel cros commander of the 2nd brigade , the officers , nco 's and soldiers of the morrocan division who fell , here , gloriously the 9 , 10 and 11 of may 1915 . 
  the 9th of may 1915 , the regiments of the moroccan division assaulted at 10 am , from the berthonval trench , breaking valiantly the german resistance and reached in one leap their objective , the hill 140 , piercing for the first time the enemy front line . '',

  hey you should try [ the online version !, 
  ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/ ), 
  as bad as the paper but i usually just read the titles . 
  i like movies , i 'm not a expert in any way , i like watching movies old/new but i 'll be honest , i 'm much more familiar with movies ranging from the 80 's to today . 
  now in [ this list ] ( http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films.htm ) that you linked above , the majority of `` top tier '' film range from the 20 's to the 70 's . 
  so why older movies are considered better than the `` new generation '' ( 1980 + ) ? 
  i 'm not trying to create a debate or anything , i 'm genuinely curious . 
  actually no . 
  `` qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons '' litterally translate `` may the impure blood flow down our furrows '', 
  now you would think that it 's a racist statement and whatnot but you have to remember the original context of the song . 
  it was written during the french revolution . 
  back then , to have `` impur blood '' would mean `` to get angry '' or `` mad '' . 
  `` furrows '' , in the song is a metaphore for `` vein '', 
  so really what this sentence mean is somthing like `` may all our anger flow through our veins '' . 
  and i piss in the ass of all the french so called `` intelectual '' and politician that would change our beautiful national anthem for being too bloody and warmonger-esque . 
  so what is the language spoken during these haka ? 
  is it still taught in school in nz ? 
  is that a french flag hanging to the left ?
