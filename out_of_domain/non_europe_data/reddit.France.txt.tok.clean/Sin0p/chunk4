  wait . 
  if i were to get one of these car , would it be considered theft ? 
   considering i 've fired 2 rockets at a tank before and it just kept on rolling toward me and ended up killing me, 
  depends on the tank really . 
  tusk and t90 are heavily armored tanks . 
  if you want to engage those , try disabling the turret or the tracks first . 
  ( .50 cal wo n't do the job for those , ifaik . ), 
  and of course , never engage armoured vehicle if you do n't have sufficient cover or a good retreat path . 
  i do n't know , does it have decent internet there ?
