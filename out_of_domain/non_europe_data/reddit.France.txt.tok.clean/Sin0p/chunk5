  if `` x '' keeps telling me blatant lies i will eventually not give a single shit about what `` x '' is talking about . 
   x - `` and i also did that this week-end with y and z. . . '', 
  that music from the video , i heard it somewhere . 
  i know it . 
  you know , i love honda 's but in this case ... 
  i ca n't compute ** ice ** catching ** fire ** . 
  glaciers melting in the dead of night and the superstar sucked into the super massive . 
  that 's where you can get a mcbook . 
  so you have a honda shop just across an acura one ? 
  wtf, 
  the mass effect universe . 
  even if you do n't like the games , the ending and such , this is a brilliantly constructed background universe with so much things going on . 
  in the first me game , i problably spent 30 % of my in game time in the encyclopedia . 
  watched ** apollo 13 ** of ron howard with tom hanks for the first time this week . 
  pretty good movie . 
  tom hanks is a fantastic actor . 
  not to mention kevin bacon . 
  i might go on a ron howard streak ( i 'm thinking ** rush ** ) or continue my `` survival '' type movie with ** captain philips ** or ** castaway **, 
  i have not seen it and after some research it seems very promissing !, 
  thank you for the suggestion !, 
  all is lost is on my watch list for a while now , i 'll check it out for sure . 
  forgive my ignorance but ** why ** you would do such a thing on your car ? 
  i see plenty of exhaust modification of this type on / r/shitty _ car_mods and it had always left me wonder . 
  * blood has been spilled this night ... *, 
  damn !, 
  this read kept me up until almost 5am !, 
  very intersting read with maps/coordinates . 
  a fascinating story !, 
  three mons to get abs ? 
  yeah , good luck with that . 
   i really do love you babe, 
  i like having sex with you , babe, 
   but i love her too, 
  but i 'd like to fuck her too !, 
  is your boyfriend 's name chad ? 
  did i see `` lsd church '' ? 
  cause if i did , i 'm in !, 
  praise our lord and saviour, 
  probably still in developement . . inferno promod was the shit though . 
   bequiet 's silent wings, 
  can confirm , got two of them on my rig , 120/140 . 
  fantastic products and cheap too ( ~ 15 $ ), 
  oh man i remember the first time i listened to planet caravan . 
  i was blown away . 
  the alternate version with the first draft of the lyrics might be less well written , but the outro solo is like 3 minutes . 
  well worth it !, 
  okay . 
  looks more like banana to me . 
  so straight to b ? 
  well yeah , because i thought that the `` italy '' in op 's title was refering to the country , not the map cs_italy . 
  same here , this movie was just `` raw '' . 
  upper dupper cinema quality sound system ? 
   just that they abuse game mechanics in a way that no team currently does as well imo, 
  such as ? 
  i am really curious . 
   cheeky pushes and holding off angles with no support . 
  oh , now you just sound butthurt . 
  [ yeah , nnnnnoooooooooooo . 
  now get back to work stacey . 
  this is absolutely stunning . 
  someone , give this man gold !, 
  where do i sign please ? 
  now do n't fuck this up op . 
  i would n't be the guy who realise she 's thinking `` god , i wish i went with that other dude '' at some point during the date . 
  no pressure . 
  wait , what ? 
  you got ta love that white . 
  it even eclipsed the double rainbow for me !, 
  san andrea had the low rider hydraulics too . 
  and nitro . 
  eight years old , dude . 
  the full monty, 
  edit : tu devras obigatoirement te log . 
  as-tu un compte facebook ? 
   3 summers ago, 
  god damn . 
  i did n't see it in a long time but i quiet enjoyed it when i was a bit younger . 
  that fucking soundtrack though , timeless . 
  just for the music i would recommend this movie . 
  good list , i 'm not really a fan of l. de fun\u00e8s tho . 
  i might add [ la haine ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113247/ ) , [ les rivi\u00e8res pourpres ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228786/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) , [ le pacte des loups ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237534/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  brilliant gestures and camera work !, 
  you are absolutely right . 
  right now i 'm heavily enjoying the live studio sessions from the deluxe version of acmots . 
  god i wish there were more of those jams released . 
  there is also the hidden shades ep from last year . 
  back in the days , when they choped down trees and shit , they wore this kind of leather apron for protection . 
  not laughably ridiculous , let 's say that it reflects the author 's tastes , that 's all . 
  really diverse choices , i may not be okay with the order but it 's a list of solid / `` iconic '' films . 
  god damn , such a let down . 
  i thought this was a movie about that [ rpg that came out a few years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/risen_%28video_game%29 ) . 
  a jesus movie ? 
  really ? 
  that fucking movie . 
  saw it last november . 
  never again . 
  brendan gleeson is brilliant tho . 
  that one time i got 3k + karma on a comment i made . 
  the french may have a smaller boat but the [ charles de gaulle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_aircraft_carrier_charles_de_gaulle_%28r91%29 ) is catobar and can pretty much launch whatever the fuck they want .
