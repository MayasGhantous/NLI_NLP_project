  i laughed out loud . 
  action scenes + willem dafoe who 's carrying single handedly this movie . 
  he 's just brilliant . 
  also , rocco and the cat . 
  [ lucky them ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1885299/ ), 
  i just rewatched this movie just to be sure , and yeah it fits the description of the thread . 
  i 'm talking about the ellie and charlie characters if this is n't clear enough . 
  the final scene may be a bit `` romancy '' but i 'd argue it remains open to interpretation . 
  anyway good flick , check it out . 
  much obliged op, 
  nice builds man . 
  how did you do such nice fireplaces ? 
  is it a craftable item ? 
  legit question here : how these pilotes take this sort of pictures whilst flying ? 
  do they take their phone in their flight suit ? 
  well , i would have thought that casually taking your phone with you to take selfies when you pilot a 130m $ jet was prohibited . 
  all cool man . 
  maybe it 's a recrutement pr thing : `` hey kids !, 
  look how cool this is ! '', 
  or maybe i 'm overthinking this . 
  excellent documentaire . 
  merci . 
  diplomacy . 
  i am amazed that a blatant add for a product they sell has 30k + views .

  yes . 
  i played on this server for while last year or so . 
  hands down the best aii wasteland server . 
  there was a great community and skilled players on all sides .

  wow mickey rourke 's is pretty impressive in that scene . 
  i 'll watch the movie to have some context . 
  i did not expect this kind of shit in `` the expandables '' .

  ( relatively sfw ), 
  yeah , i cringed when i saw that . 
  maybe he meant in the 19th century or something . 
   plenty of the ffl in the fifties was made up of ex-german soldiers, 
  and plenty of the german soldiers were not blood-thristy nazi . 
  just guys with military exp . 
  willing to start a new life . 
  dat godam loch ness monster !, 
  so , when he 's `` jerking '' the shifter , is he really getting back in neutral when breaking ? 
  that 's a big no-no for pretty much all driving instructors where i 'm from .

  god fucking damnit anon . 
  thanks for the links , that documentary was entertaining . 
  straight dude here , amen to that . 
  try to explain that to your buddies tho . 
  and you 'll be queerer than elton john . 
  salty milk and coin . 
  i totally get what you mean . 
  as a noob reader myself ( currently mid-adwd ) i watched all the season of the show before starting reading but i `` spoiled '' myself way prior that . 
  this sub and all the `` spoil '' i read actually helped me through some plot points . 
  as for the show , it helped me visualise some of the characters . 
  so i did n't really mind all that . 
  the story is so rich and dense in the first read-through that i think i would have missed a lot if not for this sub/wiki . 
  and you 've got to admit the tinfoiling is the cherry on top of the cake . 
  that 's what i was thinking about , the eventual resurection of jon by mel . 
  lem me get my foil roll . 
  ** if ** ghost wargs into jon . 
  does he get to have a second life as other wargs do ? 
  that would open an interresting thing to think about . 
  if we consider jon warging into ghost at his death , his spirit would still be alive in the wolf . 
  now if mel decide to resurect jon ** by sacrificing ghost ** ( `` worthy of a king '' / king 's blood yada yada . . ) then jon resurected would be jon + ghost , as the wolf lives his second life . 
  so jon would likely experience a change of personality ( like beric/lsh ) with a pinch of * direwolfiness * in him . 
  as the op of this thread has demonstrated ghost have a remarkable ability to understand the language and behavior of humans around him . 
  and we know that mel spent quite a lot of time at the wall . 
  maybe ghost would be willing to sacrifice himself to save jon ? 
  hmm . . 
  it must be way more practical to play arma with a pad . 
  i do n't speak english . 
  i will not speak english !, 
  which i think would be more apropriate . 
  you are absolutely right .
