  it is `` fixed '' : this `` bug '' happens every time the servers go down but the real time appears normally after some time . 
  for those who say this is not fixed , please check the '' i 've wrote between the words fixed and bug . 
  it will cost $ 0.99, 
  k i downvote u, 
  g2a is illegal . 
  g2a should n't support that kind of things . 
  however , it does . 
  when an item is sold on ebay and that item has been obtained illegally , it is removed . 
  g2a does n't do any kind of verification , and do you know why ? 
  because they do their business with these stolen keys . 
  rank ? 
  it 's horrible in any case, 
  edit : oh come on reddit , it was at 9 and now it 's at -3 lmao . 
  you can use or do whatever you want , i was just giving my opinion, 
  this [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lsyzzkb.png ) says it all . 
  thanks man , i love this playlist . 
  the fishy thing is that they all start their review with the game name and a dash and that the majority of the reviews are russian , that must mean something . 
  not every employee though, 
  yup , got the same problem . 
  there 's a thread about it here : http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/357287935565278619/, 
  except that steam does n't manage bundle prices . 
  the devs have to change the bundle price when one of their products are on sale . 
  however , most of them do n't because they 're lazy or they forget about it . 
  can / = / have to/must, 
  maybe , but that 's not steam 's fault . 
  finally !, 
  do you have an extension like steam enhanced installed ? 
  i do n't have this . 
  check r/steamcontroller , i 'm sure they can help ya . 
  oh , did n't know they had a discord channel , neat !, 
  some months later ... 
   pgl are asses , and we wo n't be working with them again . 
  step 1 : provide helpful answers without any spelling mistake . 
  even some are getting scammed with the authenticator ... 
  during these last months , there has been some leaks about hl3 and l4d3 , plus they are developing games ( the lab , destinations ... ) . 
  maybe they do n't want to announce it officially ? 
  there is some other way . 
  both are pretty good imho . 
  drowning or everything related to asphyxiation . 
  yeah , maybe gabe is on vacation, 
  who is this, 
  because some devs were creating other accounts and were giving this badge to these accounts so they could post reviews , that kind of stuff . 
   oh , are you only able to post a review if you have a certain profile level ? 
  i 'm not exactly sure for that point , but as / u/coinwin said :, 
   boosting the bots level made them seem less suspicious and gave them the ability to do more things on steam . 
  250 friends slots is already waaay enough , at least for me . 
  if you only keep people you talk with at least once per month , that 's enough . 
  70 and only got 137 friends , so ... 
  thanks for you reply , but how could we do that ? 
  there could be millions of possibilities . 
   exclusively, 
  lmao, 
  i do n't think so . 
  you have to use [ virtualhere ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/440520/ ) to play with your xbox one controller . 
  thanks a lot for the reply !, 
  i agree !, 
  ( a new section for vr is added for games which support vr , but the first one does n't need to be deleted ), 
  yup , i have a shitty connection so i rarely take part of free weekends offer . 
  the last offer i took part in was for duck game . 
  haha . 
  well , here 's a proof if someone needs one ( i doubt someone will ever read this comment except you , but yeah , whatever ), 
  do you have any eta for this ? 
  i 'd loooove to play it . 
  great job man !, 
  1 year, 
  you can ( partially ) do this with betterdiscord : you have to modify the emotes file and add the name and the image of your emote . 
  but you have to use bd , of course . . 
  i definitely prefer the new ui, 
  we broke it too on our server . 
  whenever we type ! airhorn or any other command related to him , he does n't come in the voice channel . 
  we tried to kick him and add him again , check his permissions et cetera but it does n't work . 
  there 's also an issue on github about this but there 's no replies from any dev : https://github.com/hammerandchisel/airhornbot/issues/14, 
  what the fuck man ?!, 
  you 're trying to compare two very different things . 
  when you 're in jail , you can not do anything except stay in a cell or , if you 're lucky , maybe going out and talking a bit with people you do n't know . 
  this guy is just banned on one game . 
  one . 
  if he really wanted to move on , he could have done it since long time ago . 
  it 's just that it looks like he 's obsessed about this thing . 
  well , they are a community now , so why it should stop ? 
  i do n't even really take part into their community but i just sometimes talk with them and they are very cool people . 
  just wanted to tell the source because ... well , this info has n't been `` created '' by him , just shared by another way ( since it was already shared on their discord ) . 
  / tts message , but you must have the permission to send tts messages . 
  owners could always edit channels and recover their permissions . 
  thank you con man, 
  ** update : ** found how to activate the pdf viewer . 
  * go into about : config, 
  * click on `` yes , i 'll be careful , blah blah blah '', 
  * search `` plugin.disable _ full_page_plugin_for_types '', 
  * do a right click on the sole string and click on `` reset '', 
  * then , open the context menu  options  applications and choose `` preview in nightly/aurora/firefox '' for pdf . 
  files, 
  ok , good . 
  now i need to know how can i do the same with sound files !, 
  no , screenshot easier with [ sharex ] ( https://getsharex.com/ ) . 
  wow , thanks !, 
  it worked perfectly !, 
  all prices will be the same till the end . 
  man , this does n't mean anything . 
  really .
