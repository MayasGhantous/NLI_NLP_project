  this `` hover game_hover '' thing is just this : http://i.imgur.com/vz1acvb.png, 
  and the left and right key thing was already there since some time . 
  take a look at here : https://github.com/igaocorradi/seleniumigorcorradi/blob/509a37f44b89ebe836c3518e419d6dba16719eb1/bin/datadriven/comunidade%20steam%20%20%20%20erro.html#l197, 
  there are multiples pics . 
  the constellation one does n't look at all like the steam logo . 
  the bar code was removed on december 25th , so i think it started on this date . 
  tf2 is in the orange box and the orange box is discounted at -75 % . 
  that 's not a bug . 
  the sales will end .

  do n't launch it via steam and use the desktop version instead . 
  * 7 days, 
  arg confirmed, 
  you can try to buy it on amazon , maybe it 'll be available in your country ? 
  i do n't understand why you 're saying `` the controller does n't even look worth it for me '' as you said `` id totally buy a steam controller if it were available in my country . '', 
  in your last post . 
  it 's $ 35 on amazon right now . 
  it 's clearly worth the price . 
  i bought it at 55 $ and i do n't even regret it . 
  but anyways , that 's your money after all . 
  he 's a moderator but can contact valve employees pretty easily and fast . 
  not everyone can buy three different monitors . 
  it maybe was intentional , but that does not mean the folder was empty or anything . 
  more probably because it 's unoptimized and it runs on java, 
  it was a ~ ~ sunday ~ ~ saturday . 
  edit : sry, 
  here 's a hd version of this icon : https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/shared/images/community/bigpicture/levels_crystals_bp.png, 
   i think, 
  all the themes ? 
  do you mean the headers ? 
  oh shit sorry i 'm blind, 
  i 'm sorry for breaking your little heart sweety, 
  there are a yeti , an ufo , aliens in the last headers . 
  i do n't have them all unfortunately :( but here are some :, 
  do n't take it that seriously please . 
  i think it 's plausible , that 's why i posted my theory here . 
  but i do n't think it will necessary happen . 
  i do n't want you to be mad because of me :(, 
  i do n't see why . 
  l4d3 could serve as an experiment of source 2 and that kind of stuff so they could know what is well-received or not , and so adjust half-life 3 for a release . 
  hi its me ur compatibility update, 
  rip, 
  lol , k, 
  well , in any case , i only posted this on reddit, 
  there will be no header for the 4th since the sales end on this same date, 
  no , i do n't say something will happen . 
  yup, 
  we dota 2 now bois, 
  ( from http://store.steampowered.com/controller/update/dec15 ), 
  the devs/publisher deactivated it so these games could n't be resold on g2a or other reseller websites at a more expensive price . 
  the banner did n't change : c, 
  and nope , there 's no 11th card . 
  there 's none at all . 
  these were placeholders . 
  actually , you could craft that badge one week before the sales started so the cards , before their reveal , were called `` mysterious cards '' and the placeholder badge `` mysterious badge '' . 
  so why are you here ? 
  there was the comic and the arg for the winter sale . 
  at what time did the mym update got announced ? 
  like , at what time did the blogpost was posted and the website got live ? 
  do you really think that a tf2 update is more important than spending some time with your mom ? 
  you 'll regret it when your mom 's not gon na be here anymore, 
  yeah , it 's in the alternative game modes menu in the casual mode, 
  make towairatu great again, 
  hey , sorry man , but that 's all we can do . 
  there is a large number of variables and it is pretty difficult to deal with . 
  we also know that a lot of items have a lot of caps which should n't be here in the first place , but however there 's too many to fix them . 
  however , the new items will not have these caps anymore . 
  yeah , i know , i was just principally replying to your first complaining :p i 'm sorry that there are still some mistakes ( such as the space ) but i doubt we can fix that , i 'll look into that . 
  thanks for your feedback !, 
  here you go !,

  ^ ^ ^ ^ plsgivemegoldthx, 
  if you need some other sounds , go ahead and tell me , 
  here you can find everything related to tf2 's dlc : https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/user:kreafan/dlc, 
  i agree . 
  i still do n't understand why there 's a ptr client for dota 2 but not for cs : go and tf2 . 
  that 's weird ... 
  i searched for matchmaking matches today and found them in 2-3 minutes . 
  remember there are still problems with matchmaking search so that 's probably why you had to wait that much time . 
  yeah , you should wait . 
  i bought it two years ago and ca n't wait for july 22nd so i can discover the whole game again . 
  basically , when you use steam idle master , it opens your games that got trading cards and farm them so you can then resell them on the community market or use them to craft badges . 
  that 's a bug : there are 4 subscriptions plans plus the free one so it shows them all in the popular new releases section . 
  did he try to change his download region ? 
  steam  settings  download  download region,

  yeah , there 's a wipe coming with 1.0 , and you ca n't play with the same character in unstable and normal version . 
   characters will be wiped for 1.0 but wo n't be wiped again after that . 
  salty, 
  well , he 's just pathetic . 
  raging just because he did n't had his dear reddit karma .
