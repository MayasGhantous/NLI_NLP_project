  before , it was a `` oh !, 
  '' , but now it 's simply `` suspense ... '' . 
  i do n't know if changes have been made for other languages too . 
   google searches for ` pokemon gp ', 
  yeaaah , i loove to play pokemon gp . 
  nope . 
  you 're wrong . 
  there are plenty of undiscovered and mystic creatures , and some have been discovered in the last 10 years . 
  just search on google `` newly discovered sea creatures '' , and you 'll find a bunch of articles dated between 2010 and 2016 . 
  a lot more ways should be invested to explore the sea , even if it 's difficult , i 'm quite sure it 's possible to discover a lot of new things . 
  that 's a shame , but space is quite cool too ( even if in space i do n't think we can discover new beings ) . 
  is poop harmful to us ? 
  * updated localization files, 
  i do n't have any . 
  feelsbadman, 
  people who make use of their kids to create videos and gain a shit load of money . 
  did n't know that , thanks op . 
  that 's a really cool feature . 
  for me , it 's not the case . 
  i was born in the 90 ' - 00 ' and i love to listen to 50 ' , 60 ' or 70 ' tracks , and according to the youtube comments , some people have the same feeling . 
  but i guess it depends on the person , what does he like , his personality , etc. 
  japanese has a word for every single onomatopia haha, 
  you should rename you `` nomansfanboy '', 
  why 21st ? 
  it 's a sunday, 
  there has been nothing during the 3 past years , why would there be something this year ? 
  if they really did n't care about anything except money , they would n't fix bugs , remake maps ( nuke , inferno ) , add new sounds ... 
  your arguments are bullshit . 
  exactly . 
  that 's like when you buy booster packs irl , that 's not gambling . 
  actually , you 're a bit wrong for this one . 
  ads are translated by valve employees because we can not translate images : it has to be done at valve ( because they know exactly which font to use , that kind o ' stuff ) . 
  otherwise , yeah , most of the texts are translated by the community . 
  you have n't seen what the next major looks like , so you ca n't judge the performances till you have n't seen them . 
  welcome to reddit, 
  what are the lab and destinations ? 
   people complain the steam controller is cheap plastic , and breaks pretty easy . 
  do they make any changes to the design ??? 
  fuck no !!, 
  they are going to sell the same piece of junk , and make more junk in the future . 
  also , it 's not a piece of junk . 
  you 're quoting some people who did n't like it , never used it , but you 're saying it 's shit . 
  maybe you should test it before you can judge it ? 
  i have mine since day one and love it . 
  i guess it depends on people 's likes but you can not saying it 's cheap plastic and breaks pretty easy because that 's not true . 
  i never used steamos to be honest , but from the feedback and the steamos forum , it looks like it 's updated quite frequently . 
  the last update was pushed 2 days ago ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/discussions/1/361798516939144943/ ) . 
  i do n't see what you think is `` bad '' with it . 
  also , i do n't know why you 're talking about money here since steamos is completely free , the updates are too , and they are n't gaining money for creating steamos ( except for steam machines sales , which are not much , by the way ) . 
  i patiently wait the day there will be a major enhancement of the steam ui . 
  for what company ? 
  also , why are there 7 days and not more or less ? 
  please tell me all my grammar mistakes and i 'll be happy to fix them all , 
  show me your priotits, 
  i 'm pretty sure it will be discounted on winter sales since it has been discounted more and more often since last year , so i do n't see why it would n't in 5-4 months . 
  however , i really doubt it will be over 30 % . 
  maybe the price will drop when the next version of the steam controller comes out ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steamcontroller/comments/4m9w3u/steam_controller_and_link_on_sale_till_66_30/d3u1bpx ) , or in one or two years , when sales will go down . 
  good shit go\u0c66\u0501 shit thats \u2714 some good shit right there right \u2714 there \u2714 \u2714 if i do \u01bda\u04af so my self i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49 ) mmmmm\u13b7\u041c \u041do0\u041e\u0b20ooooo\u041e\u0b20\u0b20oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52 good shit, 
  that 's an anesthesia for computers : `` sleep , computer ... '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ funny, 
  lmao, 
  dota is on source 2 . 
  i agree . 
  it saved me a lot of hours and frustration . 
  also , that music , wow, 
  and alongside time fcuk 2, 
  do you play tabletop simulator ? 
  github pages is pretty cool , but you ca n't use any server-sided programming langage . 
  that 's because of the community . 
  the recommendation system works along with steam tags . 
  most of the time , some people thinks it 's funny to add some tags which have no link with the actual game . 
  for example , they add the `` family '' tag for fnaf , or the `` psychological horror '' for kids games like putt-putt . 
  so if you play a game which has the `` psychological horror '' tag , putt-putt will eventually pop up in this list . 
  no , there are n't ads . 
  first , there 's no ads system or stuff in steamworks , and second , if these were ads , we would have known since long ago ( some developers would have told the community and that would have become a scandal like the paid mods have been ) .

  god , how many threads will be created each day to post a screenshot related to recommendations ? 
   fun fact for those of you that saw the ab + stream at pax , 80 % of the new items and enemies were just mods the guys made for the steam , 
  that 's not funny . 
  hey !, 
  congrats , your game looks very promising , 
  have you already thought of a price for it ? 
  you can upload your screenshot on steam and use the `` share '' button . 
  you can create a discord bot and do something like this :, 
  bot.on ( `` servernewmember '' , function ( server , user ) {, 
  mybot.addmembertorole ( user , server.roles.get ( `` name '' , `` rolename '' ) , function ( err ) { if ( err ) console.log ( err ) } ), 
  the discounts are in the products , not the bundle . 
  the -20 % and -30 % do n't apply unless buying them together . 
  the steam link is actually more if you do n't buy it with john wick currently .
