  why ? 
  steam link can also be used for videos and movies , not only for games . 
  it 's a streaming machine , like a chromecast . 
  i do n't even know what xfire is lol . 
  i could ask you the same question :, 
  why has rocket league , mad max , doom , f1 2016 , xcom 2 , darks souls iii or civilization vi have already been bundled with the steam controller or the steam link ? 
  why these particular games ? 
  var bot = new discord.client ( ) ;, 
  var commands = {, 
  '' ! commandname '' : {, 
  process : function ( bot , msg , suffix ) {, 
  bot.joinvoicechannel ( msg.sender.voicechannel , function ( error , conn ) {, 
  if ( error ) console.log ( error ) ;, 
  conn.playfile ( `` file.mp3 '' , { volume : 0.5 } , function ( error , intent ) {, 
  if ( error ) console.error ( error ) ;, 
  else console.log ( intent ) ;, 
  bot.on ( `` message '' , function ( msg ) {, 
  if ( msg.author = = bot.user ) {, 
  return ;, 
  if ( msg.author.id ! = bot.user.id & & ( msg.content [ 0 ] = = = cmdprefix ) ) {, 
  if ( msg.author.equals ( bot.user ) ) {, 
  return ;, 
  bot.loginwithtoken ( entertokenhere ) ;, 
  here 's the code of a bot i created . 
  i do n't know if it will works because i just posted some parts of my code but you can always try and ask me for help if it does n't work . 
  do n't forget to save this piece of code as `` bot.js '' ( or another name but modify the bat code ) . 
  to launch it , create a . txt file and copy/paste this :, 
  @echo off, 
  goto 0, 
  rename it , delete the . txt extension and add . bat instead . 
  then , launch it and you should be good . 
  please note you need to create a bot account , i 'll let your search on the web to know how to do this . 
  steam is a platform , that 's all . 
  it 's not only a gaming platform now , it 's a content platform . 
  you can find softwares and movies on steam now , and that 's not that new . 
  softwares are on steam since years and movies are here since one year or so . 
  civilization is n't . 
  that 's weird . 
  when the bundle got released , a lot of people were saying `` omg !, 
  but who wants to play dark souls with a controller , lmao ? 
  dark souls must be played with a keyboard and a mouse !, 
  there 's nothing that indicates the game has a full controller support , not even in its steam features . 
  plus , no civilization game has ever had a full controller support . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/4u636o/a_preview_of_my_third_party_discord_app_coming/ ) could be worth a look . 
  if what you 're saying, 
   most , if not all bundles are games from the same publisher , same developer , or a game with some or all of its dlc included . 
  is correct , then that means steam controller bundles never existed , right ? 
  i do n't see anything weird in this bundle just because that 's a movie and that the steam link can streams movie , what 's the `` weird '' part in that ? 
  steam controller and steam link have always been bundled with a new product : that 's a new product . 
  as u/mrbrightside2003 says , john wick is maybe bundled with the steam link to show that the steam link is not only a gaming streaming hardware , but also a content streaming hardware , which people forget too much because there 's `` steam '' in it , and steam must be associated with games . 
  like i said in another post , steam is a content platform now , and not only a games one . 
  and i do n't see why there 's so much debate about this , steam and john wick creators can do whatever they want , they do need people to criticize what they do just because of a bundle . 
  if steam wan na bundle their steam link with . . 
  i do n't know , a candle , well they can do it . 
  i do n't know why there 's so much drama about this imo . 
  yeah , so that 's why these games have been bundled with the steam controller . 
  that 's valve 's goal to have exclusive compatibility :p, 
  you 're a literature teacher , are you ? 
  edit : that was a joke calm down lmao, 
  r/steam circlejerk, 
  one of my friends did an uno , so everything 's possible . 
  yes . 
  the discounts are in the products , not the bundle . 
  the -20 % and -30 % do n't apply unless buying them together . 
  the steam link is actually more if you do n't buy it with john wick currently . 
  close your browser and change your password immediately . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  i know you can customize the achievement popup 's `` css '' , but i do n't really think you can create a whole new thing . 
  go home - rage incoming . 
  it 's a nice little game , even if it has mixed reviews . 
  got it in a bundle so that 's pretty cool for the price , however i would n't buy it at its full price ( $ 4.99 ) . 
  the lab , destinations and steamworks , too . 
  arma 2 ? 
  it depends on what server you 're playing on , but usually that 's not that resource-consuming . 
  you can always try . 
  here 's a [ virustotal ] ( https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/07157a58438b75f36c0eac83a26f02cd0ec0f1c20552768c616bb0ef291f6259/analysis/1473026426/ ) scan if anyone 's interested . 
  it seems like there 's no malware or anything ( qihoo-360 detects it as a malware but this antivirus is n't really reliable ) , plus it 's open-source , so i guess someone who 's c # experienced could tell if there 's no harm . 
  good initiative , op !, 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  are n't tickets automatically closed after one month ? 
  well , congrats !, 
  you should be careful about these keys . 
  scammers who created this website can potentially recover your steam account by creating a ticket and giving these keys to the steam support if they have other infos about you . 
  lol , at first i thought he opened a ticket 3 years ago , that 's all . 
  i do n't know why you say it 's not relevant ... 
  i already recovered my account by sending cd keys from digital-only games to steam support . 
  not a lot of people buy pc digital games these days . 
  wow , rude, 
   crate drops do not count against your normal uncommon/rare/very rare online item drop limit . 
  they are a completely separate system . 
  i know it does n't fully respond to your question , but that 's always a thing to know . 
  it 's now fixed . 
  steam did n't create this `` logo '' . 
  you get it because of enhanced steam . 
  why are you here so ? 
  at your service, 
  thanks mate, 
  nintendo come on, 
  after some search , it seems like it is n't as suspicious as it looks like .
