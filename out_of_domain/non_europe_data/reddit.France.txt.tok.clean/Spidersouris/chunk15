  like it is said in the email , it 's open source . 
  proof : https://github.com/dbalz3/supersteam_firefox and https://github.com/dbalz3/supersteam_chrome, 
  if someone wan na check the code and tell if there 's nothing malicious , well , it will not mean it 's 100 % safe but at least we 'll have a lead . 
  yeah , obviously . 
  the new nuke map , yes . 
  the old one was located in germany . 
  the new nuke map is located in the us . 
  the old one was set in germany . 
  it 's just not implemented yet . 
  that 's not because there 's an image that it is hard coded . 
  solid dome, 
  performances, 
  choose one, 
   people, 
  is there a lot of levels ? 
  how big is the community ? 
  thanks for creating this game . 
  it 's awesome . 
  i never think a mobile game could ever impress me like that or even play with my feelings ... since now . 
  i do n't see why . 
  the cartoon has n't been created by nintendo . 
  ** and buy all our games on ** ~ ~ steam ~ ~ ** amazon !!!!!!!!!, 
  what ? 
  i see no one suggested human : fall flat yet . 
  that 's a really cool game and you can play it in coop with geforce experience share . 
  lolno . 
  it 's sean murray the crook . 
  link 's voice is a bit too involved imo . 
  i think you should create his own steam account and gift him the games he wants . 
  if you wan na play with him , maybe take a look at geforce experience share . 
  steam has a family mode ( which is different from the family sharing feature ) . 
  you can use family view to limit an account 's access to a subset of its content and features . 
  with family view , access to the steam store , library , community , and friends content and features may be gated by the entry of an additional pin ( if he lives far away from your , then he 'll need to ask their parents to enter the pin code ) . 
  more information about family view can be found [ here ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5149-eopc-9918&amp;l=english ) . 
  have you contacted bethesda ? 
  that 's one of the first things to do . 
  yeah . 
  well , in game that 's not that annoying , but i do n't see why they added his voice in the inventory menu . 
  too .

  yeah , that kind of thing is cool !, 
  thanks , i managed to sleep , 
  your game is pretty good , but i 've run into two issues :, 
  first , the sound sometimes `` cracks up '' , there are like interferences . 
  i use my phone loudspeaker ( my phone is an asus zenfone 2 ze551ml ) . 
  i do n't know if it does the same thing with earphones . 
  second , on level 6 iirc , the wood plank disappears a bit too soon . 
  see : http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img924/1645/w41dz5.jpg ( it should be near the trunk ), 
  as far as i know , you ca n't . 
  for now ( on their website , it says sound packs are one of the planned paths for long-term monetization ) . 
  you can only deactivate them . 
  i doubt there 'll be fall sales . 
  more like halloween sales on october , 31st, 
  haha yes :d, 
  and better gameplay . 
  maybe . 
  it depends , actually . 
  if they switch for source 2 , physics will probably be modified , that kind of thing . 
  also , i found another bug :, 
  if you click on the `` next level '' button too fast , the `` victory '' sound will still continues on the start of the next level ( like one or two seconds ), 
  no , `` mixed '' reviews were red , as mostly negative reviews .

  shit, 
  thanks a lot , i did n't think it was that easy :d, 
  how do you know that ? 
  yeah , but maybe it has been designed so we can use it with the tv , like the wii u gamepad , and outside , like the ds .

  i see what you did there : https://puu.sh/rptsb/9b717f0c7c.png, 
  yeah . 
  oh okay , did n't know that . 
  so , if , for example , i create a `` wake up '' action and then let the touchtask actions run through , it will work , right ? 
   do you want to scan and repair now ? 
   yes, 
   scan, 
  hahahaha,

  one more thing : [ a screenshot of the bestiary ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cvq0u09ukaazkyl.png ) was posted on december 8 , 2015 . 
  it seems like `` class '' and `` win % '' have been removed , but `` hits '' has been added . 
  yes . 
  sorry , i thought he said `` i made a mod '' .
