  my bad, 
  there 's no arg . 
  that always been like that . 
  that 's not a big sale like a christmas or weekend one , just a midweek sale . 
  so they made a new engine and scrapped it ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/55uy1r/something_interesting_in_the_new_steam_sale/d8dxdlk?context=3 lol, 
  what ? 
  i do n't understand your comment . 
  what 's a shadow ban ? 
  and why are they banned ? 
  yes . 
  multiple times . 
  i already verified the integrity of game cache . 
  it really annoys me to do a fresh reinstall since i have a shitty connection but if i do n't find any solution that 's what i 'll do .

  source ? 
  we ca n't on browsers , so why could we be able to on mobile app ? 
  well , that means nothing . 
  publishers can do their own halloween sales , ~ ~ bethesda ~ ~ bohemia probably just messed up and published this art a bit too soon . 
  argh . 
  i always get those mixed up haha . 
  yeah , never said there was n't going to be an halloween sale , just that screenshot did n't mean anything . 
  [ mutant mudds deluxe ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/247370/ ) , which was on 3ds . 
  / u/frankmonza , please ? 
  just reinstalled the game completely and it works now !, 
  thanks ,

  thanks , 
  you can add no-steam games to your library too .

  https://www.reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/56w2tl/please_open_the_skyboxes_above_apps_on_inferno/ - ~ 1300 upvotes, 
  `` most helpful reviews '', 
  respectively 27 % , 11 % and 10 % of users found these reviews helpful . 
  why do they appear here ? 
  reviews with less than 40 % should n't be able to appear here . 
  [ thanks steam users ] ( https://puu.sh/rggns/32fa899b92.png ), 
  yeah that 's true . 
  it 's a really big problem valve has to face here . 
  iirc you can submit movies on greenlight , yes , but just since some weeks , so i doubt a movie has been greenlit and published already . 
  they clearly said in their blogpost that they wanted feedback . 
  everybody knows that cs : go devs watch reddit and steam forums for feedback . 
  and on the steam forums , no one complained about the skybox . 
  on a saturday ? 
  i highly doubt it . 
  i think it will be either the 27th ( thursday ) or on the 31st ( monday ), 
  43/50 now, 
  they already opened up skybox between alt-mid and a site , but they 'll not open the b bombsite skybox because cts can basically smoke at whatever spot they want when they 're on b. 
  that already exists . 
  if the guy you trade with is n't clean , a message will appear saying `` other members of the steam community have reported [ user ] for attempting trade scams . 
  proceed with caution , and remember you will only receive the items shown in the trade window . 
  steam wallet funds and cd keys can not be traded . '' . 
  otherwise , no message will appear . 
  obviously , someone can scam you even if you do n't get this message , but people needs to know they must report an user if they get scammed , or if the user tries to scam . 
  it 's just a puush, 
  knife sounds were already changed one year or so ago . 
  when you get invited by a group , you can not decline the invitation directly on the group page . 
  to do so , you must go in the `` invitations '' section and decline it from there . 
  well , you can say the same thing about friends invitations , but you can accept/decline a friend invitation on the profile of the person who invited you , so that could ( should ? ), 
  be like that for groups too . 
  like irl booster packs . 
  and you do n't have to be +18 / +21 to buy booster packs .

  it 's not localizable rn, 
  at least everyone can understand what it means, 
  we 're on reddit mate, 
  it shows in english because this string has n't been uploaded on the steam translation server yet . 
  i thought you said `` it 's too bad the message is in english as opposed to your default french '' because i did n't change the language to english to take the screenshot ( and so there was french and english , which created an `` inconsistency '' ) . 
  edit : pls guys do n't downvote vensmith we just have been misunderstood, 
  i understand , however , when i upload images on imgur , they are compressed as hell . 
  does the same thing happen to you ? 
  however , if you got any good image upload website i 'd be glad to use it instead of puush . 
  they said that in the next store update ( which should come out soon ) , you 'd be able to exclude games by adding related tags . 
  for example , if i add the `` mmo '' tag , mmos games and all the games which one of the most popular tags is `` mmo '' will appear less frequently on the steam store page . 
  however , if your relatives do n't have a steam account , they 'll have to create one to use this feature . 
  [ 93 % of steam userbase born 1st of january ] ( https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/83148-93-of-steam-userbase-born-1st-of-january/ ), 
  thanks bundles, 
  thanks mate . 
   it still wo n't be able to effectively filter age-gated games though since things get rated m for a variety of reasons . 
  they do n't have to get rated `` m '' , you can just filter them by tag ( sexual content , gore ... ) or by product type directly . 
  it 's in 2 languages because my steam language was set to `` french '' . 
  however , since this functionality is new , translations have n't been applied yet . 
  steam is more than a gaming app now . 
  yes , it sells games , but it also sells apps and videos/movies/series now . 
  if you 're interested , [ here 's the movie ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/537580/ ), 
  the grey one reminds me of the nes, 
  [ yes ] ( https://puu.sh/rqpdc/ffff7ce25c.png ), 
  if it 's on sale right now , it 'll never be during halloween sale ( especially it 's not an horror game of any kind ) . 
  if you do n't buy it right now , you 'll have to wait till winter sale . 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  the amount field is in the `` animation tab '' ( https://kustom.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/454871-animations-explained-rule-speed-amount ) . 
  actually i 'm doing something a bit special : a 8 pages klwp theme ( for my own use ) . 
  i used [ shiftinghome ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=klwp.jobe1785.shiftinghklwp ) as a start and i added 4 other navbar icons that appear at page 5 . 
  and it works perfectly . 
  the thing is , and i do n't know why , they also appear in the navbar of the 4 first pages ( [ here 's an example with only one icon ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193050976725237760/239106648600215552/screenshot_20161021-212400.jpg ) ) . 
  so what i wanted to do was to set the amount option to 0 for pages 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ( so the icon is hided ) , set the amount option to 100 for page 5 ( because the page is related to that icon ) and set the amount option to 50 for page 6 , 7 and 8 ( because it should appear a bit but not much because we 're seeing the last 4 pages ) . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm really bad at explaining stuff like this , plus english is n't my native language . 
  but if you need more info , please feel free to tell me .
