  that 's already very kind of you to try to help me out !, 
  that 's not an issue . 
  you can only upload emotes for servers , not channels . 
  first , you must have the `` manage emojis '' permission . 
  then , just follow these steps :, 
  you can create your own emotes thanks to software like photofiltre , paint.net or photoshop , or you can browse google images and resize the images you want to upload if the quality is bad . 
  maybe because you 're trying to gift a `` complete the set '' bundle , which price changes depending on what products of this bundle you own . 
  i 'm sorry but i 'm not a formula pro . 
  however , maybe you can take a look at [ graphs komponent ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arun.wgraph.komponent ) .

  hey , thanks !, 
  i tried to use this formula :, 
  $ if ( si ( screen ) = 5 , `` 100 '' , `` 0 '' ) $, 
  $ if ( si ( screen ) = 6 | 7 | 8 , `` 50 '' , `` 0 '' ) $, 
  so for example , on screen 5 , the amount will be at 100 , and on screens 6 , 7 and 8 the amount will be at 50 . 
  finally , it will be at 0 for other screens ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . 
  the problem is i ca n't hide it : it will always stay . 
  so maybe i 'm using the `` amount '' option wrongly , maybe there 's a way to hide it completely ? 
  for now , i `` fixed '' the problem : the icon appears at the correct place but always got 100 for amount . 
  otherwise , if i decrease this value , it 'll appear on screens 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .

  okay , thanks . 
  nice theme by the way . 
  well , humble bundle also have their share of responsibility here . 
  they just could change the `` 100 % positive reviews '' to `` 100 % positive reviews from steam purchasers '' , or something like that . 
  they perfectly knew that this rate was going to change with this bundle . 
  halloween sales are principally focused on horror games even if no-horror games are discounted too . 
  the biggest steam sales are summer and winter ones because they occur during holidays ( most of the time ) , and because discounts last longer . 
  in my opinion , winter sales will have either better discounts , either same discounts as the halloween sales . 
  i understand your point , but i meant that they last longer than halloween sales . 
  i guess that 's positive for developers and publishers because they can hope to sell more copies if their product is discounted during a longer time . 
  i do n't know if you can make them quieter , but i know you can disable them with the ` bot_chatter ` command . 
  you can set it to `` minimal '' ( bot_chatter minimal ) , `` radio '' ( bot_chatter radio ( to only hear radio commands ) ) or turn it off ( bot_chatter off ) . 
  however , it mutes player actions too ( so , for example , if a teammate launches a grenade , you 'll not hear the `` fire in the hole ! '', 
  sound ) .

   old man keeper is an unused character that was going to be added to the afterbirth dlc for the binding of isaac : rebirth . 
  it is assumed that he was replaced by the keeper . 
   using the cheat engine , old man keeper was playable since the initial release of afterbirth . 
  however , he was invisible as he had no sprites and he started with zero health . 
  these graphics were added in later patches and remained in the game until they were replaced by the real keeper sprites after the arg had ended . 
  if the player played as the keeper on april fool 's day 2016 , the sprite was changed to this sprite , but only for a day . 
  [ tomorrow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/597g0u/tyrone_thinks_hes_soooo_cool/d96bhcg/ ) / s,

   steam has a rule that games must be listed using the official name they originally have registered the game with . 
  because they originally used all lower case letters ( look at the games title screen ) steam policy forces them to list in on here as `` resident evil 4/biohazard 4 '' without capitals .

  i love kongregate , played many games during too many hours on this website some years ago . 
  so as long these games are free ( or paid but with far more content ) , that 's cool .
