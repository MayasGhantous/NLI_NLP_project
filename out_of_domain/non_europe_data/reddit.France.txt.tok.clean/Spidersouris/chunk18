  what if you set up [ these permissions ] ( https://puu.sh/sllju/dd90fa3990.png ) ? 
  unfortunately , i doubt it 'd work without the `` send message '' permission . 
  i guess the best thing you can do is setupping a bot that will automatically delete non-images/links messages . 
  you ca n't get a mm cooldown on an account that has shared games since you ca n't play cs : go online matches when shared . 
  [ source ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9732-ryui-2823&amp;l=english ), 
  matchmaking cooldown . 
  it 's a ban from matchmaking cs : go servers . 
  you ca n't . 
  i 'm a s1mple man , i see source 2 , i upvote . 
  what if i do n't have a 3d printer ? 
  which *, 
  actually , i think it 's on sale now because the steam autumn sales start in some hours and they probably messed up with the start time of the sale . 
  is there some kind of tutorial ? 
  i remember of seeing a reddit post about creating a br paypal account but i ca n't find it anymore . 
  yeah your post i replied to has already been downvoted by some people ... could you explain me via pm ? 
  yeah , great idea . 
  then op 's account 's gon na get restricted . 
  from steam subscriber agreement :, 
   you and valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration . 
  that includes , but is not limited to , any claims arising out of or relating to : ( i ) any aspect of the relationship between us ; ( ii ) ** this agreement ** ; or ( iii ) ** your use of steam , your account or the content and services ** . 
  it applies regardless of whether such claims are based in contract , tort , statute , ** fraud ** , unfair competition , misrepresentation or any other legal theory . 
  thanks < 3, 
  it is enforceable everywhere . 
  you accepted an agreement , you have to respect it . 
  how so ? 
  we , translators , did n't understand that part either . 
  actually you can ... but on third-party websites . 
  they created a new page for the steam controller ( http://store.steampowered.com/controller ) , like they did some days ago with [ macos ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/macos ) , [ linux ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/linux] , [ videos ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/videos/ ) , [ software ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/software ) , etc. 
  [ steam is illuminati ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbkl3n4xeh4 ), 
  they never did a black friday sale , there was only a '' [ steam exploration sale ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/news/19452/ ) '' , which is the equivalent of the steam autumn sale . 
  valve 's goal when launching the steam controller has never been to launch a controller that was `` plug & play '' , but allow users to create their own configuration , share them with the community and permit to users to play games that are normally not playable with a controller from their crouch . 
  also , 1/3 of employees ( ~ 115 ) are actively working on vr right now , so that 's a huge part of the company . 
  this promotion was good , but like practically everything on the internet , some users abused of this ( bought a lot of humble bundles so they could create `` valid '' accounts and get ton of free games ) . 
  humble bundle and other bundle sellers can create new bundles at any moment . 
  valve ca n't seek bundle sites to see if such or such game is bundled on such or such website for such or such price . 
  actually , i know some indie developers who gave keys to bundle sellers , but their game was only bundled like 3 months later , or more , so they 'd have to negotiate with every game dev/publisher , and potential game devs/publishers who gave keys to these bundle sellers would have to contact them , etc. 
  and that 's not a solution either , that 's way too complicated , and users will always find ways to `` fraud '' . 
  a lot of users already got one or two more accounts with multiple games , so they could participate anyway because they would be considered as active users . 
  i think it 's better to wait . 
  some developers wait winter to discount their product a bit more because it 's the time of the year where people potentially receive money or steam wallet codes , that kind of stuff . 
  this one has three yellow achievements : http://store.steampowered.com/app/431860, 
  stardew valley , ori , nubs ' adventure , pony island , tabletop simulator , mutant mudds deluxe, 
  actually , all mac users who used a steam controller or a steam link received the valve friends and family complimentary pack which give them access to all ** future ** and current games of valve . 
  they already know about it . 
  i see tons and tons of scammers every day , so apparently that does n't bother them that much to spend $ 5 usd every time . 
  great website , thanks a lot !, 
  you can find a list of all supported controllers [ here ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9772-whjm-4676&amp;l=english ) . 
  the lab . 
  mac users who used a steam controller or a steam link before huge bugs were fixed , of course . 
  if you did n't use one of these in november , that 's normal you did n't get it . 
  got cancer by browsing on this webpage, 
  i think op 's talking about badges featured on the right , below current status : [ example ] ( https://puu.sh/sw6mq/90a2a1cf33.png ), 
  between 24 hrs and 48 hrs, 
  best discounts usually happen during winter and summer sales , which are the two major sales of the year . 
  however , that does n't mean current discounts will be better during winter sales , however , a greater number of products may be discounted . 
  hmm ... ok . maybe you should post this on r/gamedeals, 
  it seems like your steam webpage is partially in dutch . 
  it sometimes happens . 
  try to reload the page ( ctrl+f 5 ) or modifying your store language preferences . 
  i think you did n't understand what op meant . 
  it appears that ( s ) he 's browsing steam in english but game tags are shown in dutch instead of english . 
  probably one of my nephews , i do n't want to have kids . 
  you can restore them at any time though , the game license is n't deleted from your account, 
  what cardboard do you recommend guys ? 
  i 've seen this one which seems to be pretty good : https://briztechvr.myshopify.com/products/briztechvr-google-cardboard-v2-black but i 'd like to know your impressions since i never took any interest in phone vr . 
  like what ? 
  like i said , i really do n't know what are the `` best and cheaper '' vr headset for smartphones . 
  thanks !, 
  the average userscore of steam games released in 2016 is 77 % . 
  in 2015 , the avg . 
  userscore was 75 % . 
  so , statistically , games are n't as `` terrible '' as excepted . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes, 
  edit2 : thanks for the upvotes, 
  you know steam do n't set game prices , right ? 
  steam has a rule that games must be listed using the official name they originally have registered the game with . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://astats.astats.nl/astats/toplist.php?displaytype=totalsteamgamesbought ) . 
  steam is n't a gaming platform since 2012 . 
  they started to add non-gaming apps at this moment . 
  however , people still tend to see steam as a gaming platform because most of the products which are released on that platform are games . 
  according to the steam dev days ' video content panel , +1800 videos have been released on steam and 4.36 million users have at least one video in their steam library . 
  they 're also trying to add more features regarding videos : 360 vr videos or mobile playback for example . 
  yes, 
  why ? 
  there is n't any kind of concept art on the tf2 's store page . 
  all screenshots featured on that page are in-game screenshots . 
  if there is extremely high traffic on the steam network or if the network is temporarily off-line , you may not be able to upload or change your steam avatar immediately .
