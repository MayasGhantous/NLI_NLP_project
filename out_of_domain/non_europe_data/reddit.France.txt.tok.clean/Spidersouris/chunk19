  try to get help here : https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/helpwithgame/?appid=353380, 
  maybe try to create a new thread then . 
  you 'll maybe get a solution there . 
  i 'm the only french moderator ( but not the only translator ! ), 
  on the steam translation server ( https://translation.steampowered.com/ ) . 
  i 'm sorry `` browsing the french version of steam breaks your heart '' . 
  please feel free to add me on steam so we can discuss about steam 's french translation and potential changes that could be made . 
  also , please note that original cs : go translations ( basic weapons descriptions , for example ) have n't been made by volunteer translators but by professional ones ( hidden path entertainment translators ) . 
  to be honest , we did n't check every single original translation because that takes way too much time . 
  however , we can modify them at any moment , so we could discuss of this too . 
  here 's my steam profile : http://steamcommunity.com/id/spidersouris/, 
  i hope to hear from you soon . 
  i 'm talking about the french translation here , so that may or may not apply to all languages . 
  if your suggestion is accepted and you join the steam translation server , you can do whatever you want : that 's not a problem if you do n't log in for x months/years , you 'll always be able to come and translate what you want to translate , without the need to do an application again . 
  one or multiple games in this pack are space games , not all of them . 
  subreddit rule n \u00b0 13 : no advertising steam groups . 
  because you selected the `` top sellers '' category and that the valve complete pack is a top seller . 
  they are n't gon na feature portal or portal 2 in the top sellers category if they 're not top sellers `` directly '' ( what i mean is that if they 're not purchased alone ) . 
  they 're gon na feature the bundle instead . 
  there are no categories for bundles , only for games , and that 's pretty logic ( a majority of bundles contains different-themed games ) . 
  because this bundle features one or multiple space-themed games and it is a top seller . 
  that 's all . 
  great . 
  actually , this timer appears on the application page : applicants only have 2 hours to translate the assigned store description . 
  in answer to your question , u/lightx _ , if i remember correctly , when the timer expires , you 'll have to translate the same description again or , most likely , you 'll have to translate another store description . 
  i do n't know why it has been designed like that , but there are probably reasons for it . 
  in answer to your last question , all games make your brain work , but games that can especially make you `` smarter '' ( even if that is n't the kind of term i would employ ) are puzzle/logic games . 
  the ones i recommend you are hocus , the witness , portal , portal 2 , the talos principle , the room , mini metro and much more ... browse the `` puzzle '' tag on steam if you want some more . 
  `` under $ 10 '' category already exists : http://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut1&amp;category1=998&amp;os=, 
  like new new ? 
  minor text fixes, 
  it appears as a suggestion because these two products got one user tag in common : `` gore '' ... 
  thanks steam users !, 
  steam is n't a gaming-only platform anymore . 
  factorio is pretty popular though . 
  why would n't they be allowed to ? 
  valve games benefit from the same exact system . 
  why would n't third-party games be allowed to benefit from that system too ? 
  cd keys websites should simply be deleted . 
  refunds exist, 
  that does this on every single subreddit , not only on r/steam . 
  when you install an addon like this or an userstyle which modifies reddit 's appearance , you ** must ** disable subreddit custom themes ( https://www.reddit.com/prefs/  display options  uncheck `` allow subreddits to show me custom themes '' ) . 
  at least , you must for a great experience browsing reddit . 
  you may want to check out [ this curator page ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857883-touch-friendly-games/ ) to find touch-friendly games . 
  gabe does n't tell employees what to do . 
  here 's a part of the answer : https://github.com/steamdatabase/gametracking-dota2/commit/61ebc046bc28ea0415f8f33cbe18b9287005b089, 
  i saw, 
  the average userscore of steam games released in 2016 is 77 % . 
  in 2015 , the avg . 
  userscore was 75 % . 
  so , statistically , games are n't as `` terrible '' as excepted . 
  normal . 
  4 good reviews will only give the `` positive '' review to the game , not `` very positive '' nor `` overwhelmingly positive '', 
  does n't seem so . 
  aw , sorry , i should have tested this before posting here :(, 
  is there any other subreddit where i can report this ? 
  that 's a really weird issue . 
  that 's all i got : [ 1 ] ( https://puu.sh/sxsgc/5581de1fc9.png ) , [ 2 ] ( https://puu.sh/sxshf/12372f0f4a.png ), 
  yeah ... like it is on illegal cd keys resellers ? 
  the first screenshot comes from the console tab . 
  that 's everything which is printed in it , css errors excluded . 
  hey !, 
  sorry , i 'm a bit new on dota , but i appreciate your work . 
  i used your guides on multiple heroes and they 're pretty useful . 
  just wanted to know : what does `` skill builds '' mean ? 
  contacted steam support 6 times iirc , got no problem at all . 
  they always replied in 24h ( except during weekends , obviously ) . 
  yes . 
  it seems like the problem only occurs on firefox nightly . 
  i know it is n't a stable software , but that 's weird it only happens on reddit . 
  oh yeah , right !, 
  thanks . 
  jerk . 
  how can you prove this picture has n't been taken in paris and that they are n't op 's grandparents ? 
  just explain why you think this picture is fake . 
  for now , you 're just giving shitty arguments like `` op posted that to gain karma '' . 
  what makes you think it is not real ? 
  `` i have seen paris , that does n't look like it '' is n't a valuable argument . 
  behind op 's grandmother , there 's an `` alimentation '' ( alias a grocery store ) , so that looks like it 's in france . 
  but you can recover games you deleted . 
  before , there was daily steam deals with exclusive prices but it is n't the case since they introduced refunds . 
  so you can buy them right now . 
  just bad luck . 
  lol , when i saw `` tfm '' , thought you were talking of transformice . 
  do you want his account to be banned ? ... 
  the publisher probably forgot to check the bundle price . 
  they do crack on people who refund too much games in little time . 
  you may not be able to refund games anymore when refunding too many games . 
  sorry , i 'm on mobile rn so i ca n't screenshot you this properly , but here you go : http://i.imgur.com/vqmxeqp.jpg, 
  i think they wanted to do it , but canceled it because of many ways you could `` cheat '' and unlock achievements ( with steam achievement manager , for example ) . 
  he does n't even write french correctly .
