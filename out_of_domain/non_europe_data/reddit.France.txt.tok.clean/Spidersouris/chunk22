  i do n't think you can do anything more than going in offline mode . 
  it seems like the marathon achievement is broken for now . 
  sharex . 
  edmund wants to add support for bluetooth controllers . 
  [ source ] ( https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/819196025877327872 ), 
  the same thing happened to me . 
  i sent my steam controller to the hardware department because it was broken . 
  waited two weeks , three weeks , one month , and have n't heard anything . 
  it seems like the package i sent was somehow lost . 
  i explained what happened to steam support and provided them the track id of my package , and they sent me a new steam controller in the following hours . 
  steam have n't updated the profile section since many years . 
  that 's maybe why some games are doing this ( for more customization ), 
  not for now , price 's too expensive for me, 
  why is this guy downvoted ? 
  he 's totally right . 
  apple store is filled with a whole lot of shitty apps , especially zombies and emojis apps . 
  apple quality control is nearly non-existant . 
  i 'm not trying to defend steam here . 
  yes , there are shitty games on the steam store too that are paid , but op , your example is just bad . 
  apple is not doing anything better than steam on quality control . 
  what 's the point of having a rule but not respecting it ? 
  you do n't have to pay 5 $ to play games though , only to access community features . 
  well , you can play free multiplayer games on steam without having to pay 5 $ . 
  consoles subscriptions are way more `` harsh '' because you have to pay to play multiplayer games .

  i 'm on nightly 53.0 a1 ( 2017-01-14 ) ( 64-bit ) and it does n't work . 
  nothing appears in the context menu and i ca n't even search in lazarus database . 
  thanks . 
  how does it work though ? 
  installed it but nothing is appearing in the context menu . 
  oh , alright ... like i said , it 'd be great if some addon/script could have a context menu like lazarus . 
  i do n't even know what i 'm replacing . 
  like the weeknd who used cs : go glock-18 sounds in [ false alarm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw5ogrx9clm&amp;t=2m28s ) .

  lol , not all apps that are awful are free , trust me . 
  and you know you can filter the store , right ? 
  they balanced them a few days ago . 
  now , portals spawn between 1 and 5 enemies and then disappear . 
  you were just lucky , i guess . 
  did you just assume striker was n't a regular person ? 
  check this : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/astats#announcements/detail/687197541732549159, 
  if steam established a system like microsoft and sony did , people would n't be able to get achievements without going online so some users could n't cheat . 
  start from [ page 158 ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=price_asc&amp;os=win&amp;page=158 ) . 
  even on https://help.steampowered.com/ , `` old '' steam support articles are still referenced . 
  [ the same exact thread has been posted a month ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/5iu4ke/coming_soon/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  stop pointing him out , he 's just schizophrenic, 
  sorry , i 'm always confusing these two . 
  thanks for your feedback !, 
  the best short translation i can think of is '' \u00d8 rachat '' or `` rachat : \u00d8 '' . 
  \u00d8 is often used as an abbreviation in french for `` aucun '' . 
  what do you think ? 
  i tried it ingame by modifying localization text files and it seems to work . 
  which one do you prefer , though ? 
  '' \u00d8 rachat '' or `` rachat : \u00d8 '' ? 
  personally , i feel like the second one is better but it 'd be great if you could tell me which one you 'd like to see ingame . 
  actually , i started to work on dota 2 french translation about 2 years ago . 
  before that , translations were made by other people and members from the community ( and they still are ) . 
  i 'm actually trying to reach out a lot of french players , experimented or not , so the translation can be enhanced . 
  it 's a bit difficult since league of legends is way more popular than dota in france , but i hope that , one day , dota will emerge in france too !, 
  yeah , got the same exact bug . 
  that 's really annoying . 
  cs : go is now ahead of dota 2 because there 's a big major going on . 
  a new update will probably ship out soon , since valve asked the community to create `` spring 2017 '' content . 
  '' - matchmaking now considers geographical distance when finding players for your team . '', 
  it 's automatic , can confirm . 
  add a dot after `` r '' and before `` c '' . 
  got a treasure i. unlocked it and got witch doctor set . 
  from what i 'm seeing , it 's not ( at least when it is unpacked ) . 
  it maybe says `` across multiple victories '' but applies only on one ? 
  idk, 
  not all sales have a side thing though . 
  also , i do n't see why they would start at the same date as the year before , since in 2017 , the first day of the chinese new year occurs on the 28th . 
  lol , valve ca n't make a whole series about professional environment every 3 months . 
  there would be nothing new to say .

  fixing a bug is much quicker and easier than fixing a whole game mode . 
  yup, 
  well , that 's just customization . 
  more personalized you profile can get , the better it is . 
  it 's important . 
  people who discover dota 2 and look at the screenshots may get repelled . 
  but the game has evolved since these screenshots . 
  yup . 
  arg confirmed pogchamp, 
  because valve does n't ask anyone to do it . 
  valve is a flat company : there 's no boss , just people who work . 
  some guy probably decided to work on it while he 's not that great in that domain , or maybe these were rushed out because some players already obtained the 1500 lvl . 
  this icon appears when the user is connected to steam chat through his browser ( https://steamcommunity.com/chat ), 
  it defeats the whole purpose of mobile authenticator . 
  but that 's a great solution for people who ca n't afford a smartphone . 
  i guess they 're being put in the same basket because they allow publishers to create restrictions . 
  is it fair or not ? 
  that 's another question . 
  uplay , origin and gog are still `` competitors '' , even if they 're less popular than steam . 
  edit : but yeah , from what i know , steam has no european competitor . 
  i 've got the same problem .
