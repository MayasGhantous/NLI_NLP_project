  however , they already said that they were not going to add any rewards for obtaining achievements ( [ source ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/astats#announcements/detail/687197541732549159 ) ) . 
  cyprus is a member of the european union for sure . 
  but is it really considered as european ? 
  publishers must use the trademarked name on steam . 
  they are n't allowed to use another name . 
  it 's the opposite . 
  10 % goes to the devs and 5 % goes to valve .

  i 've edited my post . 
  you should click on the `` steam '' button in the top bar ( [ example ] ( https://puu.sh/ts0ph/764025c8c5.png ) ), 
  new bloom is an event celebrating new chinese year . 
  this year , it happened on january 28th . 
  and dark moon started on january 26th . 
  i really doubt there 'll be a new bloom this year . 
  dark moon basically replaced this year 's new bloom . 
  probably because they 're all sleeping . 
  i doubt they would create a thing no one can get . 
  new bloom 2014 started on january 29th ( new chinese year happened on january 31st ) , new bloom 2015 started on february 12th ( new chinese year happened on february 19th ) and new bloom 2016 ( path of the blossom ) started on february 5th , while new chinese year happened on february 8th . 
  just check the content of these files . 
  they contain dark moon strings . 
  if you would have read the article , you would have known that they are n't creating vr experiences ( the lab is an experience ) but vr games . 
  `` newell and team did later confirm that these were not smaller experiments , but intended to be new `` full games '' , as opposed to the vignette-style demonstrations shown in valve 's the lab . 
  valve expect to sell these new games , and is using both unity and its own source 2 engine to develop them . '', 
  regarding the `` vr is a dead-born gimmick '' , that 's your opinion . 
  personally , i do n't think it is . 
  vr can revolutionize the video game industry . 
  vr is just starting right now . 
  we 'll have to wait a few more years to discover its true potential . 
  valve is an horizontal-structured company . 
  if no one wanted to work on cs : go , well , no one would . 
  cs : go team want to bring some things from source 2 this year , such as the panorama ui , already used for dota 2 . 
  check [ this reddit post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/5olz97/gaben_ama_summary/ ) for more info . 
  finally , one of the biggest updates is coming for tf2 , with contracts , competitive placement matches , a tf2 short film , a new campaign , a revamped pyro and much more . 
  i do n't even know why you 're saying that valve does n't care about their other games because that 's not true at all . 
  sure , 1/3 of the employees are working on vr , but their other games are n't neglected . 
  imagine if a tv manufacturer would have spent all his resources on 4k tv ... oh wait . 
  it worked !, 
  4k tvs are a success !, 
  i clearly know these are different things . 
  it was well known that 3d tvs were going to fail , especially because of the glasses . 
  however , some people said that 4k tvs were going to fail too . 
  and there are tons of articles like that . 
  however , from what i actually know , i can say that 4k tvs are a success . 
  why could n't vr be a success too ? 
  that 's what i 'd like to understand . 
  yes , for now , vr headsets are expensive : like every new major product . 
  the more companies will create vr headsets , the more there will be competitivity and the cheaper vr headsets will be . 
  dvd players were also expensive when they come out , and a lot of other products which can be , nowadays , found for practically nothing . 
  like i said in another comment , i clearly know 3d tvs = / = 4k tvs , but not every new innovation should be a disaster , right ? 
  that 's what i wanted to say . 
  why could 4k tvs success but not vr ? 
  just because you have to wear an headset ? 
   google glasses, 
  in my opinion , google glasses are a different thing . 
  technologically speaking , it 's great , but you have to use them nearly 24h a day , and everywhere you go . 
  you only use a vr headset when you want to play and you 're at home . 
  for me , it 's not that a problem to wear a headset : it allows users to immerse in another world , which is great , because you 're in the game and you can interact with it as if you were in real life . 
  if vr does n't work out , i do n't think it would be because of the headset , but more probably because of too few content ( it 's a vicious circle : there is so few content that no one wants to create new content ) . 
  oh also , vr has porn . 
  did you know the porn industry plays an important role in new products development and success ? 
  free levels for everyone !, 
  it has already been reported several times . 
  what if fees would get reduced if older published games received positive reviews on steam ? 
  the only con would be about fake reviews : they could be present more than ever . 
  publishers/developers will have to pay each time they want to release a new product on steam . 
  on greenlight , they had to pay $ 100 to get access to it and could publish as many products as they wanted . 
  with steam direct , they 're gon na pay for every new product released . 
  at least that 's what i understood . 
  totally missed the `` recoupable '' here . 
  how many copies should developers sell , then ? 
  not all developers can manage to sell 100 000 copies of their game . 
  gabe newell about steam 's quality control :, 
   what is your view on steam 's quality control ? 
  what is valve 's take on this ? 
  does it feel the current state of affairs is good ? 
  even if the flood of games is not stemmed , will the curator and tag system become more robust ? 
   there 's really not a singular definition of quality , and what we 've seen is that many different games appeal to different people . 
  so we 're trying to support the variety of games that people are interested in playing . 
  we know we still have more work to do in filtering those games so the right games show up to the right customers . 
  they never said they wanted to bring back paid mods . 
  they said they wanted modders to be paid ( receive money ) . 
  how many more threads are going to be posted about `` thoughts on steam direct '' ? 
  not every single employee is listed on this page though . 
  no thanks, 
  stop that, 
  upvote and one of your teachers will be absent tomorrow, 
  take a look at [ this curator ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/curator/2710-widescreen-gaming-forum/ ) ( it has n't been updated since late 2015 though ) . 
  also , let us scroll through the chat with the mouse scroll . 
  [ they 're hiring ] ( http://www.valvesoftware.com/jobs/job_postings.html ) . 
  that 's not photoshop . 
  it seems like there 's a new exploit or something like that . 
  i recommend you to not visit any profile for now until it 's fixed or until a valve employee explains what 's happening . 
  example here : https://steamcommunity.com/id/d3lite ( warning : it may not be safe to visit this profile ) . 
  this new `` trick '' may be harmful , like the guide trick was . 
  it 's maybe safe on your profile , but ca n't you do anything harmful with this trick ? 
  if you 're kind enough , you should send an email about this at security@valvesoftware.com, 
  no one,
