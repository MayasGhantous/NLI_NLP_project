  i know chet faliszek is still there , but it seems like he 's more focused on vr than ever right now . 
  they were writers . 
  just do n't cheat, 
  he 's always writing like that . 
  look at his posts/comments history . 
  you 're shit, 
  you mean destinations type of treatment , right ? 
  the lab has n't been updated that much . 
  they could , at least , rename them lmao, 
   the steam customer is so docile for standing for this . 
  i 'm not against this measure , but even if i was , what would you want us to do ? 
  that 's their platform , they do whatever they want on it . 
  why would they lock it ? 
  you do n't win anything by unlocking achievements . 
  why not, 
  stardew valley was published by chucklefish , so even with steam direct , it 'd be on steam . 
  that 's where developers and publishers can query cd keys for their games so they can give them for giveaways , to streamers/ytbers , etc. 
  they only can do this via steamworks , steam 's publishing platform . 
  well , he scammed you , like basically all cd keys resellers . 
  you ca n't do much , unfortunately , except maybe creating a dispute if you paid via paypal or another service where you can create disputes . 
  this screenshot just shows the steamworks website , except if kinguin have access to the steamworks page of the game you purchased ( which i highly doubt so ) , this proves absolutely nothing . 
  you know it 's just a copypasta , right ? 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little cutie ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the huggers n cuddles , and i 've been involved in numerous secret spanks on your cute butt , and i have over 300 confirmed cuddles . 
  i am trained in gorilla hugging and i 'm the top kisser in the entire frosty moe land adorable forces . 
  you are everything to me but just another cutie . 
  i will kiss you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with being that adorable to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across poland and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the love , honey . 
  the loves that wipes out the adorable little thing you call yourself . 
  you 're fucking cuddled , sweetie . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can love you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed love , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the frosty moe land sex shops and i will use it to its full extent to please your adorable ass off the face of the continent , you little cutie . 
  if only you could have known what holy retribution your romantic `` clever '' comment was about to bring up upon you , maybe you would n't have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you loveable cutie . 
  i will love you all over you and you will drown in it . 
  sure come cutie, 
  demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2vqk6pdya0, 
  but no one 's probably gon na pay for them . 
  dotabuff chat ? 
  choose any section to contact them . 
  example : https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/helpwithsteamissue/?issueid=805, 
  2020 and still making shitposts, 
  lmao, 
  merci !, 
  we 're still in winter mate, 
  lol is already the number one moba ... 
  splay that booty out, 
  also , check out the [ ultimate profiles group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ultimate-profiles ) . 
  there are a lot of steam members with `` cool '' profiles in this group , even if , lately , many users have joined it ( so i ca n't really promise you you 'll find what you 're looking for ) . 
  do you prefer a google translate translation ? 
  wii u 's code name . 
  there 's even an article on wikipedia about nintendo codenames ( which was removed some time ago , probably because there were n't enough sources ( mostly for handheld consoles ) ) . 
  here 's a link : https://web.archive.org/web/20170224213607/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nintendo_codenames, 
  edit : that 's also why citra is called like that ( apparently , 3ds 's code name was `` citrus '' ) . 
  i think you can save chat logs thanks to the api . 
  for example , [ mee6 ] ( https://mee6.xyz/ ) can do it for you . 
  i do n't really know how it works though . 
  i never used this bot . 
  recycle them, 
  yeah , please !, 
  alright , i understood the joke , but where does this come from ? 
  i have n't found anything on knowyourmeme . 
  thanks !, 
   in the chinese version there is no gore . 
  it is simpler to not having any blood , gore ore human skulls from the beginning than to make two versions of every item . 
  ^ ( ( thanks loke98 ) ), 
  the hero of the kingdom series, 
  vac bans older than 7 years do n't show up on steam profiles anymore , probably because 7 years is a lot and you probably realised cheating was a mistake . 
  valve did n't officially communicate regarding this change , though . 
  edit : there 's a reddit thread about it , [ click here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/5ub0jo/vac_bans_older_than_2600_days_stopped_showing_up/ ) . 
  just link them the reddit thread about it . 
  or block them if you find them too annoying . 
  from what i 've seen , you can play steam games with a wii u gamecube adapter thanks to x360ce ( you can bind keys to the controller buttons ), 
  maybe check r/thesims ? 
  are you opt in the steam beta ? 
  they removed it and are now selling gamemaker studio 2 instead . 
  maybe try to install it via steam : / / install/214850 ( paste it in your browser url bar ) ? 
  these are probably bots which find your profile randomly or via steam community hubs/forums or market . 
  well , i think they added the informational rating especially for groups like the framerate police . 
  sales are unauthorised on this subreddit . 
  there are only 1247 early access titles vs. ~ 13000 other products . 
  source : steamspy . 
  exactly . 
  you have to contact ubisoft about this , not valve ; they do not regulate game prices . 
  i guess that 's why he linked the steamdb page . 
  a lot of movies/series are only available for us users . 
  also , henryg , a valve employee , posted a comment :, 
   the voice chat feature has a lot of room for improvement . 
  it was first implemented a decade ago and it has n't really kept up with the times . 
  this update has improved the codec parameters and increased the sampling rate of the microphone audio , but has n't addressed all of the networking issues that cause disconnects or crackling/popping due to delayed packets . 
  they 're probably reworking a lot of steam client features for the future steam client which should be out this summer . 
  hm , i 'm not sure the recent twitch announcement pushed valve to do this kind of improvement . 
  however , if it really did , i really hope many more large companies will reveal their game client soon lol . 
  did they already reveal the games they 're creating ? 
  was n't aware of this . 
  edit : typo, 
  how could he removed it if valve ended their business agreement with him ? 
  they said it 's coming this summer .
