  ross, 
  he probably knew because strings were uploaded a bit before the update release on the steam translation server . 
  he probably knew because strings were uploaded a bit before the update release on the steam translation server . 
  you know there would be a new case if a new operation released , right ? 
  plus you 'd have to pay for the pass lol . 
  there 's a new map in this update . 
  and you do n't have to pay anything . 
  i do n't see how you can be against this change , it 's great . 
  just do n't use it if you do n't like it . 
  i think it 's just picked much because of the remodel . 
  you can play on sunday if i remember correctly . 
  i think you can do this since 7.00 ( or at least 7.01 ) . 
  no , but you 'll be able to get it for cheaper on the community market . 
  just wait some days/weeks . 
  red jugg confirmed, 
  that laugh tho, 
  and multiple posts of the famous yawning hippo . 
  that maybe was a coincidence though . 
  a `` medium '' patch on sunday ? 
  i would n't count on it . 
  that must be awesome !, 
  actually , i was about to post here ; the issue has been fixed in the last update ( or maybe it fixed itself ? 
  no idea ), 
  ~ ~ i do n't think there are more than that . ~ ~, 
  edit : my bad, 
  he meant `` anti-idiot '', 
  it 's not .

  best post of this thread, 
   when it gets popular and severely damages game quality valve usually does something about it . 
  not for cs : go, 
  interesting . 
  thanks op !, 
  you should also be able to buy items through guides during strategy phase . 
  i did n't understand, 
  commends are useless anyway, 
   the alternate style on the staff of the foreteller 's oath ( wd staff from dac chest ) added last patch has been removed . 
  why ? 
  i still see the style in my inventory but ca n't select it tho , so either they broke it or removed it but forget to remove the style thing . 
  they 're planning to release a new client for summer . 
  indie game : the movie is considered as a game , though , since when it was released , movies and even software could n't be published on steam . 
  but since some software feature steam achievements , i do n't see why movies could n't ( even if i find it a bit useless to have achievements for a movie , but anyway ) . 
  are you talking about the steam client or about the steam website itself ? 
  anyhow , you can try to check your [ language preferences ] ( https://store.steampowered.com/account/languagepreferences ) and set english as your primary language . 
  it was a mockup , so we ca n't know if the steam client will look like this in the future or not , but it 'll probably be very different from the actual one , yeah . 
  `` promoting steam groups , etc. 
  is not allowed . 
  '' , please check the rules .

  i think you must launch the game to delete them . 
  however , some items can not be deleted ( and they are marked as so in your steam inventory ), 
  castle crashers foil badge ( [ preview ] ( http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/items/204360/bc075c4784e546affeed0426d344e65b71891afa.png ) ), 
  did you try to verify the integrity of game files ? 
  ( right click on your game  properties  local files  verify integrity of game files ... ), 
  i did n't find any more , but maybe you can create a thread on the [ steam trading cards group forum ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tradingcards/discussions/1/ ) ? 
  are you sure you sent an email to vacreview@valvesoftware.com? 
  from the [ vac faq ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-radz-6869&amp;l=english ) , all emails are read and reviewed by the vac development team . 
  however , try to provide the links or the actual binaries of the cheat to help them to detect it . 
  you ca n't ( yet ) . 
  midweek tickets : $ 100, 
  finals tickets : $ 200, 
  yup , main event . 
  i think they 're arranged cost-wise . 
  according to the new steam client mockups , this will be a thing in the future . 
  exactly . 
  everything has a price . 
  what do you mean by `` banned '' ? 
  community banned ? 
  actually , developers have a limited number of update cycle that they can use for their products . 
  every time they use one , they have to create an announcement explaining what 's new in the update . 
  however , some developers use this thing to promote sales instead of updates ... 
   it was revealed in the court case against valve in australia that they had 50 support staff , with a further 200 staff at an outsourced company called blueprint . 
  this showcase only shows achievements you unlocked . 
  i think op wants to see his rarest locked achievements . 
  we wish we cared, 
  awesome channel !, 
  i love your spanish snacks videos !!, 
  sigue asi , 
  he is n't , he wan na renegotiate europeans treaties first , then disobey to these if he fails to renegotiate them . 
  hollande did n't renegociate anything . 
  in the most recent polls , m\u00e9lenchon is above fillon ( https://twitter.com/lesnews/status/851105311972839424 ) . 
  i also think macron is overestimated . 
  i highly doubt he can be over 20 % . 
  source 2 or panorama ? 
  but they said in a recent ama that they were going to include parts of source 2 ( such as panorama ) to cs : go . 
  however , this article says source 2 is going to be added to cs : go ? 
  so is cs : go gon na be ported over source 2 or only some parts of source 2 will be included to cs : go ? 
  universal tax . 
  friends can add you if they spent $ 5 . 
  they do n't , actually . 
  publishers have a limited amount of updates they can feature like this . 
  not everyone wan na break the europe , you know . 
  we can ... renegociate ? 
  ca n't we ? 
  yeah , you need to install the steam app on your device . 
  however , you 'll need a phone that can receive sms ( because you need to input a phone number to use the authenticator ), 
  hm , there seems to be no believable source here . 
  anyway , if it is true , let 's hope we 'll get some kind of minigame/activity ( and not a comic , please ) . 
  did you try to clear your browser cache ? 
  there have n't been that much minigames during the last sales .
