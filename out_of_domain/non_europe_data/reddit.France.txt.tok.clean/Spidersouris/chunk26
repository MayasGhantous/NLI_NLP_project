  glad i 'm not alone .

  they pushed this change on may 3rd , but it only affects gifts , not packs . 
  nothing . 
  you can keep them as long as you want . 
  did you try to contact the developers or the publisher to get some help ? 
  where did you see this ? 
  can not find anything on the store page . 
  a user posted on the steam forums asking if he will receive an extra copy , though , but another user replied negatively .

  they 're planning to release a new steam client this summer , you 'll probably be able to do what you request ( or , at least , you 'll be able to give feedback and they may add it since they 'll no longer be `` blocked '' by that old client ) .

  steam 's search algorithm is based on location . 
  that means users that live nearer the person who searches will appear first . 
  that 's maybe why your friends ca n't easily find you or you ca n't easily find them . 
  you/they can always share your/their profile link , or directly view your/their profile from your/their friend list . 
  i guess you received little racers street after activating ziggurat , right ? 
  that 's because they are sold by the same publisher , so that 's probably a gift from the publisher : every user that activates ziggurat gets a copy of little racers street . 
  yeah , you can use these gifts without worries or send these to a friend . 
  oh , alright , thanks for the clarification . 
  from what i 've seen , it has n't been added for now , but strings related to this have already been uploaded , so it probably will be added today .

  tl ; dr : steamvr home is like destinations , but enhanced . 
  destinations will soon disappear from the store , but items won from quests will be transferred to steamvr home . 
  wow op , you 've managed to summarize all of my thoughts about this profile thing . 
  well played . 
  you know you still have till september 1st to gain battle pass points , right ? 
  one thing i do n't understand in your post though is that you 're saying you `` would buy myself whatever cosmetic was released for io if it ever was '' , and you do n't want to buy levels ? 
  it 's the same thing : you 're paying to get an item . 
  alright , so you 're just jealous because you 'll not be part of the only players who bought the arcana , am i right ? 
  settings  options  advanced options  strict solo ranked matchmaking, 
  there 's also a hud . 
  i think the campaign is going to be released next week . 
  they already released io arcana yesterday and now true sight , i guess they want to keep some kind of update for next week . 
  it 'll be released with the first act of the campaign , next week . 
  it 's probably bugged since the arcana does n't have any icon ( even the default one ) for other events . 
  because they said the first act was going to be released this month . 
  does previous games count ? 
  i got the same problem here . 
  try to do the `` repair steam service '' step shown here : https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2117-ilzv-2837 - it worked for me, 
  that does n't force users to modify their review or reply to the developer . 
  that does n't force users to modify their review or reply to the developer . 
  well , maybe not force them , but i mean , most of the time , when a developer replies to a review , users do n't care at all and just ignore it . 
  the error you 're getting is the following : `` failed to contact key server '' . 
  try to check this steam support article : https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2204-opgc-4862, 
  if i remember correctly , the update you paused is going to download , and then the new update will download once the first one finished . 
  this has been suggested multiple times . 
  the last post suggesting this is from four days ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/6bwebm/im_sure_this_has_been_suggested_many_times_before/, 
  i have 300k points lol . 
  that 's probably the total of the points you won during the dark moon event . 
  they added the immortal treasure ii to the code : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/214066393480560641/316621948568338433/unknown.png, 
  it 's probably coming along with slitbreaker later tonight . 
  they may have pushed the release button a bit too soon . 
  oh yeah , right . 
  lol calm down that 's probably just a bug, 
  immortal treasure ii will probably be released first . 
  it 's not . 
  we 're not in june yet . 
  agreed , i really do n't understand why this character is named anti-mage but uses magic ... 
  valve should either do that or change his name ... 
  items in his inventory should n't have any mana cost ... that 's logical man ... 
  sunday , not monday . 
  yeah , it will probably come out later . 
  treasure ii should probably come along with the campaign though . 
  please no , do n't do like other mobas, 
  that 's because you 've been reported in matches for communication abuse . 
  there is no such thing as `` leaked on steam '' . 
  only publishers and developers who get an access to steamworks can publish the game store page and make it so everyone can see it .
