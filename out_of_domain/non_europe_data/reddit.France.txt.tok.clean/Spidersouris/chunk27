  i contacted a valve employee about that some months ago because i wanted to use valve assets for a project . 
  basically , you can use any valve asset/logo you want as long as there is no commercial purpose . 
  you should also add valve to the credits of your app . 
  proof ? 
  from what i 've understood , he 's talking about steamvr home ( at least i think so ? 
  most of vr games work with a steam controller , but steamvr home does n't , while it worked for destinations ) . 
  only players who did n't play . 
  you can gift sets of this treasure , but not the treasure itself . 
  there are escalating odds . 
  just check the last dota blog post . 
  there is a thing called `` visibility cycles '' on steamworks which allows you to promote your product in this section . 
  these cycles are limited ( they are between 5 and 10 iirc ) , so valve already thought of potential abuses it could lead . 
  one thing they could do , however , is verifying each description written for visibility cycles or just stop making business with developers and publishers who use this for marketing their product thanks to this way while no update was shipped ( they could simply block that feature if the last depot was n't updated in the last x days/weeks ) , but yeah , i doubt they 'll . 
  edit : typo, 
  faceddit, 
  you know we 're on the 28th and june starts in 4 days , right ? 
  edited . 
  this week . 
  tomorrow or wednesday . 
  siltbreaker will probably come out tomorrow or wednesday . 
  an awesome user did it : https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6dzvt0/dota_706c/di6l2fx/, 
  i do n't have any link for fanfictions , but you can read or reread official dota comics if you have n't already . 
  it will probably come out tomorrow or wednesday . 
  aliases are kept to make it harder for scammers to impersonate someone . 
  and please do n't use hacks for anything , or your account may get banned from the steam community . 
  aliases are stored , so i think that you can search for someone even if he changed his alias 10 , 20 or even 30 times . 
  only the 10 most recent aliases are shown on a user profile page because otherwise , the list would be way too long . 
  removing past aliases is more serious than removing past purchases because it affects the entire community and its users ( because , like i said before , scammers would remove their aliases so we ca n't search for them again ) . 
  try to paste this in your browser url bar : steam : / / install/218, 
  [ siltbreaker has been delayed until next week ] ( https://twitter.com/dota2/status/869339117770821633 ) . 
  no , that does n't necessarily mean that greenlight will go away tomorrow . 
  and valve time . 
  ~ ~ it is . 
  battle pass owners only get bonus event xp . ~ ~, 
  my bad, 
  my crybaby detector just exploded, 
  the gods decided otherwise . 
  you 're not providing advises at all , you 're just whining because `` valve did n't release any new ip '' ( while they released the lab and destinations , now called steamvr home , and they update 3 different games , are gon na release a new client this summer , and , finally , are developing 3 new ips ) . 
  if people do n't like valve 's business methods , they 'll stop buying on their platform by themselves . 
  there is no need to create a reddit topic to cry about that ( plus the reasons you listed are really pathetic ) . 
  https://store.steampowered.com/account/preferences  filter tag  anime, 
  why ca n't you remove them ? 
  does it say that these files are being used right now ? 
  that 's probably because an instance of steam is still running ( if such , that means you did n't uninstall it properly ) . 
  open the task manager ( ctrl+shift+esc ) , go to `` process '' and right-click on every steam process and select `` end task '' . 
  what error comes up when you try to delete these files though ? 
  maybe try to follow the `` manually remove steam '' instructions found here : https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9609-obmp-2526, 
  because this tag is not used enough . 
  no , because there is a 15 % tax when you sell an item on the market ( 10 % for the dev and 5 % for valve ), 
  you ca n't refund items bought on the community market . 
  it says so when you buy an item . 
  alright so i do n't understand what you 're trying to do but if you buy a $ 7 skin and sell it , you 'll get $ 6,09 back . 
   alright so i do n't understand what you 're trying to do but if you buy a $ 7 skin and sell it , you 'll get $ 6,09 back . 
  btw : thing is this only works for one skin . 
  if you buy multiple skins , you 'll get less money because of taxes . 
  yes . 
  they never announce it , except for developers . 
  but this year summer sales will start on june 22nd and finish on july 5th .

  both will come out at the same time . 
  steam does n't upload any trailer . 
  store page content is managed by publishers and/or developers of the game . 
  no , cs : go will not be ported over source 2 . 
  valve said it many times already : only parts of source 2 will be added to cs : go ( and particularly the panorama ui , already used in dota 2 , which will probably come out this summer ) . 
  ~ 1 week before the sales start , so in two weeks probably . 
  he did n't say that . 
  [ on march 8 ] ( https://github.com/steamdatabase/gametracking-csgo/commit/fa31c2b76c93fda2057da1c057efdbd9e0de03b8 ) , so that 's not really relevant . 
  do n't really like it . 
  plus , imo , the `` selected '' background color ( # 42464d ) is too light for dark mode . 
  because you 're using a skin . 
  the skin you 're using needs to be updated . 
  you know that 's just an experiment that will be ended by the end of the week , right ? 
  experiments like this last only one week . 
  should be a bit higher imo , like 150-200 $, 
  they 'll do . 
  they 're talking about this feature in the blogpost . 
  lol , abandoning something they 're using right now with steamvr home and their 3 future games ? 
  their twitter bots are just broken recently , posting news from years and years ago . 
  ( however , you now have to check your wishlist to see all titles which are on sale right now . 
  [ here 's what it looked like before ] ( https://puu.sh/wanqa/34179e2386.png ) . ), 
  you can only do it if you have the bp and achieved level 225 . 
  [ you know drop percentage from rylai 's battle blessing are disclosed , right ? 
  ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/rylai%27s_battle_blessing ), 
  stop buying battle passes to win things , that 's useless . 
  just buy it if you wan na have fun doing quests , the siltbreaker campaign , or if you want to recalibrate your mmr . 
  also , please note you 'll be able to turn the siltbreaker rewards wheel . 
  do you know what 's the difference between textarea cache and textarea cache lite ? 
  what do you have against communism ? 
  more like spam volvo 's facebook page, 
  wtf ? 
  what happened ? 
  summary pls, 
  he is . 
  no update has been pushed in the last 3 days . 
  i 'm totally chilled , man , but stop saying an update has been pushed while it is n't true . 
  you probably just did n't play dota for some time and need to download last updates or maybe some files need to be downloaded again because they 're broken . 
  no , only the base game . 
  modders already had to pay $ 100 to publish their mod on the steam store .
