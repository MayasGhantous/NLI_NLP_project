  so they and their mods are already dead if we follow your logic . 
  it would have been there since you already had to pay $ 100 to publish a mod on steam via steam greenlight . 
  please tell me how many modders published *** multiple *** mods via steam greenlight . 
  i 've seen plenty of modders on steam greenlight only publishing one of their products , not multiple . 
  maybe the steam direct fee for free games will go to charity . 
  they did n't talk of this yet , but will probably on june 13th . 
  do n't say it 'll not be the case for steam direct while we have literally * no * information about that . 
  i understand your point . 
  thing is that restriction has probably been put in place to avoid broken or low-cost mods to overwhelm steam . 
  the steam store is n't a place to publish your mods freely or experiment things . 
  it 's a place for professional mods creators who want to share their creations for game fans and casual players . 
  other websites exist for this kind of thing , like moddb , for example . 
  steam client 's ui is crap . 
  from june 22nd to july 5th . 
  that does n't change anything for valve since the greenlight fees are given to child 's play . 
  [ you can filter them by their price though , and check which game has been labeled as `` free '' or `` free-to-play '' ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=price_asc&amp;os=win&amp;filter=comingsoon ), 
  my game only updated once . 
  plus , [ only one update was tracked by steamdb ] ( https://github.com/steamdatabase/gametracking-dota2/commit/76545cd4dce74a7ac78454da59f25d8aa2cd15f9 ) . 
  if you say so . 
  weird . 
  yes . 
  what does it have to do with steam ? 
  they 're just creating their own service like other companies did . 
  these mods will not be available on steam ( and mods already uploaded on the workshop will still exist ) . 
  you ca n't . 
  it will be tradable and marketable after september 1st , 2018 . 
  i do n't know if it 's giftable or not though . 
  why would there be no badge/cards this year though ? 
  it 's free and easy money for valve . 
  lol, 
  it 's so badly made, 
  it does , indeed . 
  let 's report this game via its store page . 
  they already did that before , with greenlight . 
   we 're in the progress of completing some major updates to the ** steam curator system as detailed in our previous post here ** . 
  we 're also quite a ways into rewriting the core of our recommendation engine to better predict which games any given user might find most exciting . 
  and we 're also in the process of updating various sections of the steam store that have n't received as much recent attention as the home page . 
  ** future blog posts in this space will detail our progress or announcements on these upcoming features and improvements ** , and we look forward to sharing more news soon . 
   they are not there to judge the gameplay-value of the product . 
  they are not reviewers , not the quality gatekeepers . 
  and they will never be , they already made it clear multiple times . 
  they want all types of products to be available on steam because some people may like to play products that are considered as low-quality . 
  however , they 're adding more and more options to filter the store and make it so only products we may like are shown to us . 
  plus , like they said in the blog post , they 're gon na continue to improve curators , with them gaining more power and more control on the store . 
  i do n't really understand your comment . 
  every developer must pay the $ 100 fee to submit their game . 
  it only gets refunded if the game makes $ 1000 . 
  you know valve does n't set prices , right ? 
  what do you mean by `` advises '' ? 
  they do not tell publishers and/or developers what price to set , no . 
  however , they have an automatic system for setting prices for other currencies ( for example , $ 10 becomes # 12 ) , but developers and publishers can follow or not these recommendations and they can set whatever price they want for their product ( if they want to sell their game for $ 5 or $ 50 whether it is a aaa or an indie game , valve will not do anything against it ) . 
  they do give them recommendations regarding prices for other ** currencies ** ( based on the price they first set , which is n't set by valve ) . 
  please reread my post . 
  do you have an access to steamworks to say such a thing ? 
  there are two major sales each year on steam : the summer sale and the winter sale , where you 'll be able to buy games for cheaper . 
  the steam summer sale will start on june 22nd and will end on july 5th . 
  what activity bug ? 
  i still can see what my friends are buying . 
  also , steam summer sale trading cards have been out on thursday , and they are usually coming out one week before the sales , so that 's one more proof the leaked date is right . 
  that 's weird , it does n't happen to me . 
  but from the thread you linked , it seems like the steam team is aware of this issue and will probably fix it as soon as possible . 
  also , i do n't even understand why items not listed on the community market ( quantity : 0 ) are shown when sorting by price . 
  according to [ this article ] ( https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sought-to-buy-valve-for-1-billion-report/1100-6394880/ ) , `` valve would prefer to `` disintegrate '' than ever sell out '' . 
  so i guess that applies to steam too . 
  confused ? 
  how so ? 
  this will not change the store front at all . 
  plus , like they said , it 'll only be available on a beta channel at first . 
  yeah , we understood . 
  thing is greenlight is ** gone ** . 
  so you ca n't do this anymore . 
  but he does n't seem to understand it . 
  if greenlight is gone , the voting system is too , so concepts do n't have any usefulness . 
  that 's not a steam direct game . 
  it 's a [ greenlight one ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=888592504&amp;searchtext=zen+vs+zombie ) . 
  steam direct games will only start to be published as of july 13th since steam direct was launched on june 13th , and developers now must wait at least one month to publish their game on steam . 
  this would be against the law . 
  you ca n't . 
  you get a mystery card each time you craft a badge , instead of getting a coupon . 
  you can craft badges with these cards once the sale begins , or sell them for a few cents .
