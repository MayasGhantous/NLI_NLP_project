  you can try to create a thread on the [ spanish official steam forum ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/29/ ) . 
  there are no more new deals since autumn 2015 sales , even if some publishers like ubisoft may still apply some on their games ( so watch out ) . 
  thanks !, 
  added it to the list . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  updated and reorganized . 
  regarding the top middle character from rollercoaster , i think it could be jimmy hopkins from [ bully : scholarship edition ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/12200/bully_scholarship_edition/ ) , what do you think ?

  it 's r/gamedetectives . 
  if , like you said , discounts are n't that enticing , that 's not because of valve , but publishers and developers . 
  if they want to make higher discounts , they can , nothing prevent them to do so . 
  valve keeps 30 % like all other stores do for years and years , just like humble . 
  humble keeps 5 % only if a sale is made via the widget ( so basically , when someone purchases the game from the developer website ) . 
  actually , they take 30 % : 25 % for them and 5 % for the charity . 
  even if giving to charities is a good deed , it 's still 30 % for the developer/publisher . 
   they probably wo n't ever make games anymore, 
  i 'm waiting for your `` but vr games are n't real games , that 's not what we want '' comment . 
  badly , just look at the like/dislike bar, 
  there probably is no mini-game this summer sale because the steam team is working on a new steam client . 
  probably a one-time password . 
  it 's just when it asks you to enter your password or a code when doing a specific action . 
  windranger, 
  event cards will disappear from your steam inventory on august 5th . 
  there 's already a discussion about that here : https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/6k5rba/329970_copies_of_rust_have_been_refunded_on_steam/, 
  gg , your steam account will now be blocked and you 'll not be able to do any purchase . 
  they changed the expiration date . 
  basically , instead of expiring on september 1st , the battle pass will expire on august 20th . 
  you will keep your rewards , of course , but because of this change , people got less time to finish quests and stuff . 
  so if you buy levels now , you can claim your io arcana , yes . 
   even with them cutting off 10 days , the battle pass is still active for a larger period of time than last years by 2 days . 
  that 's not the problem here . 
  it 's still lying and it does n't respect consumer rights in any way . 
  that 's like if you were renting a car and instead of renting it for 10 days , its owner calls you to tell you that you 'll have to bring it back to him tomorrow , while you only used it for 5 days .
