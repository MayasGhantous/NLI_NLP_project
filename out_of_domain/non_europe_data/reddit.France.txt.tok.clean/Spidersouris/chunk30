  the last update changed `` september 1st , 2017 '' to `` augu ** e ** st 20 , 2017 '' . 
  just check your battle pass ' compendium if you bought it . 
   if the expiration date had originally been august 20th instead of the 30th . 
  that 's the problem . 
  it was changed many weeks after a lot of customers bought it . 
  that 's called false advertising . 
  what do you mean by `` breaking a technicality '' ? 
  they 're ripping off their buyers , yes , because they thought the battle pass was going to expire on the 1st , while it now expires ten days before . 
   alright , so you 're saying that some of their buyers would not have bought what they bought if it was going to expire on august 20th then ? 
  i never said that . 
  but valve `` promised '' them , by selling this battle pass , that they 'll be able to use it till september 1st . 
  that 's not the case anymore , so they lied to customers and ripped them off . 
  do you get my point ? 
  because cs : go only gets a campaign per year or so . 
  you do n't lose anything when doing a chargeback . 
  you just ca n't activate cd keys , send gifts , buy games for your own account or do trades . 
  was n't aware of this one . 
  let 's hope a valve employee sees this thread and fix both . 
  i have no idea , honestly . 
  maybe you should figure out how many points you can get with quests , siltbreaker and tokens lol . 
  he 's talking about daily hero challenges , but since there is one new every day , you 're missing 9 . 
  they posted an announcement regarding this : https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6kgvcv/fix_for_battle_pass_expiration_date/,

  why should op be happy ? 
  ( s ) he just reported something that is against consumer rights . 
  he 's within his rights and , personally , i 'm happy ( s ) he did this , whether valve did a mistake or not . 
  it was september 1st , now is september 10th . 
  valve probably extended the expiration date as an apology . 
   the ui is just ugly and clunky . 
  they could make it so much better . 
  a new steam client is going to be released this summer . 
  oh , you were talking about bp ui . 
  i have no idea if they 're going to rework bp ui . 
  it 's correct . 
  yes . 
  the currency will automatically be converted at the conversion rate dictated by market value . 
  they usually disappear a few minutes after you 've closed them . 
  the last time he recorded with that voice was 6 years ago . 
  that 's not necessarily devs who tag their games , but users , too . 
  yup , you 'll get it tomorrow if you got your 3 packs every day . 
  put your tin foil hats on bois, 
  i 'll tell you my sinss and you can sharrpen yourr knife ... 
  we know unlocked and completed pages will remain . 
  yes , that 's the only thing we do n't know . 
  but op was specifically asking if sticker showcases were ** remaining ** on our profile pages . 
  i have no idea why you did n't get the badge , but there is no such thing as `` bumps '' on reddit, 
  are you talking about the city sticker ? 
  it seems like it 's unlocked , it just looks like that . 
  that steam events thing seems very interesting . 
  i wonder how developers will use this feature . 
  i 'm looking forward to seeing the new steam client , too . 
  because it 's part of the [ valve complete pack ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/valve_complete_pack/ ) , which is on sale . 
  if anyone is wondering , it 's got darker once again :, 
  yesterday : http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/clusters/sale_summer2017_daily/92efe28ae1dd8cb0984134c6/top_english.png?t=1498250692, 
  today : http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/clusters/sale_summer2017_daily/9f441d857f5240f1ba60d976/top_english.png?t=1498839771, 
  no , there was only one . 
  you ca n't remove the sticker showcase from there . 
  u/hershboi : remove every sticker applied to the page you 're showcasing and , once the page is empty , click on `` show on my profile '' . 
  you ca n't remove the sticker showcase from there . 
  ( plus your link does n't work . ), 
  he probably edited his comment . 
  the first link was n't working . 
  op 's just trolling . 
  no need to be rude man . 
  and yeah , it 's still there so we can still edit the showcase . 
  daed gam, 
  dota had steam achievements at first , but valve removed them because players were tryharding to get achievements instead of tryharding to win . 
  [ source ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/achievements ), 
   hero ** picking ** screen, 
  well , i think that when people talk about drm and steam , they 're considering steam as a drm itself , because it is needed to install and play the game . 
  the definition of `` drm '' has been very controversial lately . 
  you must wait 15 days . 
  you gain +5 friends slots per level . 
  you can also feature a new showcase on your profile every 10 levels ( for example , if you 're level 40 , you can feature 4 different showcases ) . 
  it is permanent . 
  i do n't see why they 'd remove it . 
  yes , we remember . 
  that 's the 15th time in the week i see a post about this . 
  because users would try to get achievements instead of trying to win the game . 
  actually , [ they made a demo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeajkbnq4xi ) , but unfortunately , they 're using the old controller prototype . 
  that 's such a shame they did n't make one with the final product . 
  ( no idea why you 're getting downvoted btw ), 
   we all have great expectations ( but usually different ) from upcoming changes . 
  so it would be better for them to use steam beta as a testbed ( as its intended purpose ) to push some or all those changes to see reactions before making them final at once which can conflict if most of community disagree what steam thought `` would be '' awesome . 
  did n't see the video yet , but they already said in an interview that [ the new steam client would be released in beta ] ( https://youtu.be/atwe-k8y-ws?t=31m16s ) . 
  no idea regarding other improvements though , even if it 's unlikely changes to the store would ever be in some kind of beta where you can opt in . 
  [ in an interview they gave some months ago ] ( https://youtu.be/atwe-k8y-ws?t=31m6s ) , they said they also would change the overlay , the chat , how steam works in vr , and probably some other things . 
  go here : http://steamcommunity.com/my/stickers, 
  remove all stickers from your showcased page, 
  save the page with no stickers, 
  it should be removed, 
  well , they 're making it so we can create builds ingame , so they will * probably * be never broken again once it releases . 
  i have no idea how you can take a photo of your computer instead of screenshotting in 2017 , but i 'm impressed, 
  we know . 
  yes , [ one user ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/id/st4ck/ ) is actually level 2000 . 
  they released t2 on a friday . 
  june 16 is a friday . 
  i live in europe . 
  when i woke up and saw t2 was released , it was on a saturday .
