  and it 's open source . 
  this is a bit useless , you could just take a look at the minimap . 
  what would be useful , though , is being able to see some kind of panel where all your towers ' health are shown ( cause this requires to move to each tower and click on them each time to check their exact hp ) . 
  oh , alright , sorry !, 
  yeah , that 's a great idea . 
  thought it was shown ingame lol . 
  you did n't have to spend any money to get sticker packs . 
  well , that 's the same developers who decided to remove showcases . 
  sticker showcases . 
  they plan to update the steam client this summer though . 
  terrorists, 
  it was added as part of the immortal iii update . 
  the longer an item has been out , the more it can be obtained because people level up and get new treasures . 
  also , no all players open their treasures right when they get released . 
  finally , treasures iii are less common than treasures i and ii . 
  same thing for this [ summer sale adventure 2014 badge ] ( http://steamtradingcards.wikia.com/wiki/steam_summer_adventure_2014_teams?file=steam_summer_adventure_2014_badge_red_team.png ) . 
  in steam inventory and on the steam market . 
  it 's just a bug . 
  he 's using the red lifestealer immortal . 
  it 'll probably be remade with the new steam client coming this summer . 
   are you male or female ? 
  ( optional ! ), 
  other : i 'm an attack helicopter, 
  14.3 mb w / tools, 
  it 's related to the [ dota 2 workshop tools ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/dota_2_workshop_tools ) . 
  not at all . 
  it 's a mistake . 
  `` paid '' is used to refer to money , while `` payed '' is used to refer to sailing . 
  because we 're not robots ( yet ) . 
  hoho haha, 
  rigged,

  however , these are not new heroes but radiant creeps ( plus it would make sense as heroes are sorted alphabetically and they 're just behind razor ) . 
  yup . 
  [ dire creeps ] ( https://puu.sh/x2axz/deabad70a7.png ) are also there , between death prophet and disruptor . 
  or the day after . 
  trove carafe 2015 was released on june 31st while ti5 group stage ended on june 30th . 
  also , note that we 're on saturday , so it may be released on monday as well . 
  i do n't think votekick should be added , but valve could just make it so that in matchs where there is party with 3 players or more , no votekick can be launched . 
  that 's untrue . 
  firstly , you could n't purchase the greenlight fees way before steam direct was launched , so that would mean no developer can get refunded . 
  secondly , op knows that greenlight is no longer a thing , and that 's why he wants a refund . 
  to reply to u/s0501402 , i have no idea why your refund was refused though . 
  maybe try once again and if the refund request gets refused once again , try to contact steam support via another way ( select that you got a problem with the steam community , for example ) . 
  that 's untrue . 
  firstly , you could n't purchase the greenlight fees way before steam direct was launched , so that would mean no developer can get refunded . 
  secondly , op knows that greenlight is no longer a thing , and that 's why he wants a refund . 
  what 's untrue is saying you ca n't get a refund for greenlight fees . 
  like i said in another post , i have no idea . 
  most of the refunds requests are checked automatically though . 
  even when steam direct was n't launched yet , some developers asked for a refund and their request got refused . 
  they had to contact steam support through another way or post on the steamworks developers forums so it could get refunded . 
  that treant protector immortal is so creepy . 
  i love it . 
  if i remember correctly , they can recover recycled items as it does n't impact any user except the one that recycled his items . 
  i remember some weeks ago someone recycled an ultra rare item on dota 2 by mistake , made a post on reddit , and a valve employee recovered his item . 
  op : try to send a new message to steam support , explaining what happened . 
  restrictions have been put in place for selling items because it does n't only impact your account , but it also impacts the buyer account ( that 's why steam support can not recover sold items ) . 
   ** can region-restricted content be shared across regions ? 
   no , any region restrictions will remain in place when lending or borrowing content . 
  [ source ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing?l=english ), 
  probably because pubg has no territorial restriction applied for turkey . 
  but op 's talking about cosmetics , immortals or not . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/nd/list.htm ), 
  are kaci and slacks riding it ? 
  cheaper games do n't mean regional restriction . 
  your phone number is shown to no one . 
  a similar system exists for cs : go , called [ prime account matchmaking ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2235-qycn-3295 ) . 
  this has been put in place to limit smurfing/account buyers . 
  a faq regarding this is available by clicking [ here ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5434-qeyo-9636 ) . 
  this has been added months after 7.00 . 
  on april 20th to be more exact . 
  i sometimes have trouble understanding the gaming community . 
  they keep saying to companies like ubisoft or nintendo that they 're resting on their laurels and are always releasing sequels , but when it comes to valve , they ** have to ** make a sequel , else it 's bad . 
  seriously , disliking the [ game teaser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da5my8xqrhu ) just because the game announced was n't hl3 , l4d3 or p3 ( just check the comments ) ? 
  how old are you ? 
  to be honest , card games are n't my cup of tea , but maybe we can let them create and experience new things ? 
  from what it has been said at the international , the game seems to be quite different from traditional card games , with 3 lanes in which you 're playing cards , etc. 
  if you do n't like that kind of game , just shut up , and stop crying because valve did n't release a sequel to one of their products ( and they have no obligation to do so ) . 
  maybe they 'll be able to make you love that game genre , like they did for me with dota 2 and moba , and , if not , do n't worry : there are a ton of other games you can play . 
  like i said in my post , the game seems to be different from traditional card games , with 3 lanes , creeps cards spawning automatically , etc. 
  it seems to be a mix between moba and a card game . 
  we have n't seen any gameplay video yet , so saying it is a hearthstone-like game does n't make much sense right now . 
  you ca n't compare an unreleased game with no footage with an already released game . 
  the steam arg was n't planned at first . 
  steam devs created it because they saw some users were interested in it . 
  i do n't even know what half-life 3 has to do with it . 
  [ source ] ( https://youtu.be/atwe-k8y-ws?t=2m3s ), 
  it 'll probably be f2p anyway . 
  oh , because artifact is n't a game ? 
  what is it then ? 
  thanks a lot for your reply . 
  very constructive . 
  they never said they were the first to do a card game . 
  however , the mechanics seem to be quite different from the other games . 
  shown discount is for the daedalic armageddon bundle , in which the night of the rabbit , the dark eye , edna & harvey , chaos on deponia and memoria are included . 
  regular prices for these titles are n't shown because they 're not on sale , while a bundle in which they 're included in is . 
   because steam blocked a few links ? 
  he 's probably talking about using another chat platform ( i assume he uses steam to chat with his friends ) . 
  they 're working on making guide creating available directly in-game .
