  no one is `` famous '' on steam . 
  after ti7 , for sure , but i do n't know exactly when . 
  logged in to one of my friends pc some days ago . 
  when i came back home , my library categories got rolled back ( steam seems to have detected my categories from 2 years ago and replaced the ones i had before logging in to another pc ) . 
  restarted my computer and reinstalled steam multiple times . 
  steam support does n't seem to know how to help me . 
  maybe someone here could help me ? 
  thanks for your reply , but it did n't help me . 
  i 've remade my categories . 
  i hope valve will fix this issue soon . 
  if the player who receives money want to give the money to charity , he can do it himself . 
  added ou ` op ' peng , abed ` azel ' yusop and lin ` xxs ' jing autographs . 
  got no popup on my end . 
  in 50 minutes . 
  release date was announced for monkey king though , which is not the case here , so they 'll probably be released earlier . 
  we also may know more today . 
  every new hero is overpowered , that 's normal . 
  they need time to balance him based on how players play him . 
  a `` water '' update was n't ever planned . 
  that 's what they did for monkey king . 
  the thing is a lot of players complain because they do n't necessarily have the necessary time or internet connection to download dota 2 test . 
  new heroes are usually added to the test client during one day and are then ported over the classic client with a few modifications . 
  xboct : `` i wanted to say something , but i forgot , nevermind , i now know what i want to say . 
  in the new patch , i dont know if everyone knows this information '' hosts interrupts `` okay , tell us '', 
  `` there will be 5 talent rows , starting from lvl 9 , and i 'm not joking '', 
  ns jokingly : `` you are already fired , no one even knew this information '' laughs,

  you ca n't force steam to use https over http . 
  steam must support https themselves , on the server side . 
  a client can not force a website to use https over http . 
  download an emulator and play fire emblem ? 
  here are some recommendations :, 
  [ the banner saga ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/the_banner_saga/ ), 
  [ the xcom series ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=xcom ), 
  [ telepath tactics ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/357940/telepath_tactics/ ), 
  [ invisible , inc. ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/243970/invisible_inc/ ), 
  [ valkyria chronicles \u2122 ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/294860/valkyria_chronicles/ ), 
  [ disgaea ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/405900/disgaea_pc/ ), 
  nothing will happen ( you 'll only get redirected to the game store page ) . 
  i guess they 're going to release it along with the duelling fates update . 
  siltbreaker act ii is n't really a major update , it 's just the continuation of the first act which was promised . 
  they released him 4 months later . 
  the thing is that they announced a release date along with the trailer , which is n't the case here . 
  that probably means they 're going to release it pretty soon . 
  they announced 7.00 to the boston major . 
  only monkey king was revealed at ti6 . 
  it should work , yes . 
  download the game on your external hard drive , copy the game folder ( probably named `` mount and blade '' ) , paste it on your computer and launch steam . 
  no idea if it will work if you do n't have any access to internet though , but you can still try . 
  [ 10 years old kid crying and spamming reddit because his favorite caster is n't casting ] ( https://puu.sh/x8nwp/8bb1798954.png ), 
  edit : [ and it continues ] ( https://puu.sh/x8pes/00c0d7bf54.png ), 
  i mean , i can understand you dislike the way someones cast , but there is no need to spam the subreddit about that . 
  keep your opinions to yourself , spamming them like that will not change anything . 
  reddit is about constructive discussions , not people with a vulgar vocabulary spamming `` luminous is illiterate , he should n't be casting '' and `` fuck valve '' . 
  reddit has rules though . 
   content is prohibited if it :, 
  threatens , harasses , or bullies or encourages others to do so, 
  well , good thing they did . 
  [ now he 's calling the mods `` sjws '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6ta8gh/why_mods_keep_deleting_lumi_cast_complaints/dlj2m2f/ ) , lol . 
  do you have a source , please ? 
  edit : typo, 
  alright , thanks !, 
  you must use the mobile authenticator for at least 7 days before putting an item on the market or trading it without any hold . 
  the escapists 2 is `` coming to both windows , mac and steamos/linux '' [ according to one of the devs ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/641990/discussions/0/2217311444325272158/#c2217311444327559629 ) . 
  so it 'll be available on august 22nd , such as the windows and linux versions . 
  there 's also [ lawbreakers ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/350280/lawbreakers/ ) which is quite similar . 
  here are some going through my mind :, 
  [ the binding of isaac ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/the_binding_of_isaac/ ), 
  [ the binding of isaac : rebirth ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/the_binding_of_isaac_rebirth/ ), 
  ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/214770/guacamelee_gold_edition/ ), 
  [ surgeon simulator ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/233720/surgeon_simulator_2013/ ), 
  [ deadcore ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/284460/deadcore/ ), 
  [ dmc : devil may cry ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/220440/dmc_devil_may_cry/ ), 
  [ ducktales remastered ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/237630/ducktales_remastered/ ), 
  that seems exciting . 
  websites rarely make a distinction between `` pc '' and `` mac and linux '' , unfortunately . 
  but do n't be worried , according to one of the developers , it should be available on mac when it 's out . 
  [ axiom verge ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/332200/axiom_verge/ ) is very similar to metroid , even in its graphic style . 
  there 's also [ hollow knight ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/hollow_knight/ ) , [ the swapper ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/231160/the_swapper/ ) ( with no enemies , only puzzles ) , [ ori and the blind forest ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/387290/ori_and_the_blind_forest_definitive_edition/ ) , [ seasons after fall ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/366320/seasons_after_fall/ ) , [ apotheon ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/208750/apotheon/ ) , [ rogue legacy ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/241600/rogue_legacy/ ) and [ valdis story : abyssal city ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/252030/valdis_story_abyssal_city/ ) . 
  [ the same thing happened to a user some hours ago ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/5/1470841715969876974/ ) ( i do n't know if this is you ) . 
  that 's probably a bug that needs to be fixed on the developer-side . 
  edit : [ another user ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/5/1470841715964797177/ ) got the same bug . 
  you should wait for a developer to fix it . 
  major patch but right now, 
  talents at levels 9 , 13 , 17 , 21 and 25, 
  why would they add it right now ? 
  the new steam client is going to be out in only some weeks . 
  you need to use the [ steam mobile authenticator ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4440-rtui-9218 ) for at least 7 days . 
  most of your game saves are saved in the cloud . 
  check your documents and `` my games '' folder to find saves that are n't in the cloud . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  [ here 's the `` announcement '' ] ( https://youtu.be/atwe-k8y-ws?t=31m16s ) . 
  i know you 're joking , but just a clarification for some people : steam team = / = artifact team . 
  they said `` sometime this summer '' . 
  i wrote `` some weeks '' because of valve time . 
  and it 's sunday . 
   in a few ~ ~ years ~ ~ weeks when steam gets a new ui revamp, 
  ftfy, 
  they 'll be listed on the community market 15 days after you 've requested to do so . 
  it is .
