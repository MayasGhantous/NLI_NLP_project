  he never used his twitter account till december . 
  metro will probably not work with the new steam client . 
  we do n't even know if we 'll be able to create skins . 
  most employees are focused on one project though - for example , alden kroll has practically only worked on steam . 
  we do n't even know if we 'll be able to create decks and stuff . 
  probably , yeah . 
  they could add tips to the strategy screen . 
  if they did n't release anything , that means the percentages are the same . 
  same than other treasures . 
  [ hanjie star ] ( http://www.hanjie-star.com/ ) ? 
  that 's not the real one . 
  that 's a suggestion for the future ui . 
  check the flair . 
  i think some users are downvoting because the title is very misleading . 
  you could think that 's the animation and login window from the ** real ** new ui . 
  it 's j ** e ** ff hill . 
  no idea if he still works on dota 2 by the way . 
  also , decisions like this are n't taken by one member but by the whole dota 2 team . 
  because you bought your game on a shady website . 
  check the '' [ key resellers and what they mean for you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/wiki/dangersofkeyresellers ) '' article on r/steam 's wiki for more information . 
  steam 's search system is based on geolocation . 
  it first shows users that are the nearer . 
  thought it was for a second . 
  they 'll have to deliver act ii before the battle pass expires anyway . 
  if you want to search titles between $ 0,01 and $ 5 : http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=price_asc&amp;price=0,5 ( where 0 is the minimum price , and 5 the max one ) . 
  if you want to switch pages , though , you 'll have to add *** & page = [ nb ] *** to the link ( for example , to access page 50 : http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=price_asc&amp;price=0,5&amp;page=50 ) . 
  else , if you click on a page number below , the settings are gon na reset as they 're not officially supported . 
  if you 've made trades with him while steam guard e-mails were active ( and not the authenticator ) , search for `` steam trade confirmation '' in your emails and try to find a trade with him . 
  the date since you were friends should be indicated at the left . 
  actually , i 'm talking about this folder : c : \\ users \\ [ user ] \\ appdata \\ roaming \\ microsoft \\ windows \\ start menu \\ programs \\ startup, 
  if you add programs to it , they automatically get started at windows startup . 
  if you want to add programs to the start menu , you have to do it from the `` start menu '' folder if i remember correctly . 
  if they 've not been vac banned on cs : go , they still can play on cs : go secured servers . 
  vac bans are , most of the time , applied to one game only ( the game where the user cheated ) . 
  for example , if you cheated on call of duty : mw3 , you still can play to cs : go and dota 2 on secured servers . 
  there are some exceptions though . 
  for example , if a user cheats on a source based game or mod , he will get banned from counter-strike : source , half-life 2 : deathmatch , day of defeat : source and team fortress 2 ( if he cheats on tf2 , he 'll also be banned from cs : s secured servers ) . 
  same thing applies for gold source games ( counter-strike , condition zero , ricochet , day of defeat , team fortress classic , half-life : deathmatch and deathmatch classic ) . 
  more information can be found [ in this faq ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-qdhj-5691&amp;l=english ) . 
  yes . 
  they can also see if you 're playing while offline by going to the game store page and clicking on the `` x friends have played this game '' button . 
  lowering a price always makes the product more accessible , even if it 's still expensive for some . 
  for your refund request to be accepted , you must have played the game less than hours ** and ** create a request within the 14 days after you bought it . 
  use [ steam achievement manager ] ( http://gib.me/sam/ ) to lock these achievements . 
  it disappears after 60 days . 
  they made [ a tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/csgo_dev/status/899785298736852992 ) . 
  the international is a valve tournament , which is n't the case for cs : go tournaments : they 're all handled by third parties . 
  the kaci and slacks courier can be obtained in the trove carafe 2017 .

  that 's what the next store update is about - filtering the content which is n't interesting you thanks to improvements to the recommendation algorithms , curator update and lists . 
  your post history is consistent , at least . 
  it 's been a while now since this has been added . 
  i can recommend you [ rule with an iron fish ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/645750/rule_with_an_iron_fish/ ) , an rpg fishing game i translated some time ago . 
  that 's a really great game if you wan na relax after work or long gaming sessions . 
  plus , their devs are really awesome !, 
  i played it . 
  i translated it into french , actually . 
  the game is really great , full of humor , and it 's perfect if you wan na relax some time , catching fish and talking to the npcs . 
  the devs are adorable too ,

  [ corrected ] ( https://github.com/jackathan/marclaidlaw-epistle3/blob/master/epistle3_corrected.md ) ( names replaced to match what they * actually * mean ), 
  yeah , that 's not like if they announced artifact a few weeks ago and they are developing 3 ( 2 if artifact is a vr game ) vr games . 
  you would have to refund the bundle . 
  saying they do n't make games anymore is n't true - you may like or not like what they 're doing , but they ** still ** create games . 
  i 'm , too , disappointed following what laidlaw wrote as there will probably be no episode 3 or half-life 3 ( or , at least , not in this form ) , but facts are here , they 're still developing games , even if it 's not the ones you want these to be . 
  denialism is never a good thing .

  please note valvetime is only a community around valve and what they do - that 's not an official valve account . 
  these tweets and their deletion remain weird , though . 
  edit : they now posted this : https://twitter.com/valvetime/status/901017090789961729 ( thank you marc laidlaw for everything . ), 
  in case it gets removed : [ here 's a screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l9nbikw.png ) . 
   letting the lead writer go and not giving a fuck if he leaks the entire plot of the game, 
  what do you want them to do if the nda expired ? 
  lol . 
  yeah , cause artifact is n't a game, 
  the last paragraph talks about marc laidlaw and his relation with valve : he does n't `` recognize '' the people at valve anymore but he still hopes that hl3 will be developed again ( at least that 's my interpreting ) . 
  [ remember me ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/228300/remember_me/ ) . 
  please remember valvetime = / = valve . 
  that 's why i preferred to remind you , as it is a bit off-topic . 
   and not making games, 
  really ? 
  i keep seeing that everywhere , but they plan to release 3 vr games ( 2 if artifact is a vr game , which i highly doubt , for a card game ) . 
  that 's still a game , whether you like it or not . 
  from what we 've heard about the game , it seems to be quite different from card games standards though . 
  i know it 's frustrating . 
  i 'm sometimes frustrated about that , too . 
  but if they decided to not work on sequels , that must be for a good reason . 
  the only thing i approve is people wanting a reply regarding whether they 're working on a sequel or not . 
  else , if they do n't want to work on something , that 's their choice ( and honestly , i prefer that they work on what they wan na do instead of working on something a lot of people want just to deliver it ) . 
   regardless if they make any games, 
  if they really did n't care , they would do nothing but continue supporting steam , while they 're hardly working on vr ( 1/3 of employees are working on it ) , developing hardware , maintaining their os , etc. 
  a ** steam ** group to `` ditch '' valve ? 
  what an awesome idea . 
   then why is there new game artifact another card game ? 
  what no one asked for ? 
  because people at valve wanted to work on it . 
  is that so complicated to understand ?
