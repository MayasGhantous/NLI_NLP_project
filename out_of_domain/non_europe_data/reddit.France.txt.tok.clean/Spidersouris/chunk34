   why wont they say anything to the fans of these huge ips they own ? 
  like i said in my precedent post , that 's the only thing i 'm approving :, 
   the only thing i approve is people wanting a reply regarding whether they 're working on a sequel or not . 
  they could have released l4d3 then , to both please the fans and make money . 
  that 's possibly one of the reasons on why hl3 did n't come out , but that 's not the only one . 
   else , if they do n't want to work on something , that 's their choice ( and honestly , i prefer that they work on what they wan na do instead of working on something a lot of people want just to deliver it ) . 
  i do n't think they wan na `` give '' it like that . 
  even if they do n't wan na continue the series , that 's still the game that helped them to get where they are today and they still want to be associated with it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  all valve games must be sequels/fps ? 
  you can return any game you 've bought in the last 14 days ** and ** played less than 2 hours . 
  however , from [ this page ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds?l=english ) :, 
   refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on steam -- not as a way to get free games . 
  if it appears to us that you are abusing refunds , we may stop offering them to you . 
  we do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price . 
  check [ this faq ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2274-iflv-5334 ) and [ this wiki page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/wiki/missingfileprivileges ) . 
  you should never trust anyone selling you some kind of script . 
  stolen items can not be recovered . 
  waiting for the comments related to marc laidlaw 's post . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  but people are still going to post about it . 
  so you 're preferably looking for metroidvania/rogue-like games , right ?

  trust me , they really do n't care if 10 , 100 , 1000 or even 10000 users write a negative review just because hl3 is n't out yet - steam users will just skip these crybaby reviews . 
  that 's not what i see [ here ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/stats ) . 
  edit : also , [ according to steamcharts ] ( http://steamcharts.com/cmp/570,578080#48h ) , the game did n't beat dota 2 's number of current players in the last 48 hours . 
  how so ? 
  it never beats it . 
  refer to [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/6qy4n7/rsteam_monthly_game_suggestion_thread/ ) . 
  this . 
  but people are fucking overreacting because they do n't do a sequel . 
  i prefer to know they 're working on something they like doing instead of working on some sequel just because people want to see that . 
  a lot of indie games can be finished in less than 2 hours .

  nice playlist !, 
  thanks !, 
  or at least let us customize it to make our own news section . 
  project igi was bought by airplant this year . 
  they plan on working on it again and ( probably ) release it on steam . 
  did you try [ this ] ( http://www.thewindowsclub.com/youll-need-provide-administrator-permission-delete-folder ) ? 
  what about [ half-life 2 : downfall ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/587650/halflife_2_downfall/ ) ( requires half-life 2 ) , [ estranged : act i ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/261820/estranged_act_i/ ) , [ red trigger ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/491130/red_trigger/ ) , [ thinking with time machine ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/thinking_with_time_machine/ ) ( requires portal 2 ) , [ portal stories : mel ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/317400/portal_stories_mel/ ) ( requires portal 2 ) , [ only if ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/298260/only_if/ ) , [ 404sight ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/361630/404sight/ ) or [ medusa 's labyrinth ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/436110/medusas_labyrinth/ ) ? 
  i think you can sell it immediately on the [ steam community market ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/market/ ) , except if the [ steam guard authenticator ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4440-rtui-9218 ) has n't been added to your account in the last 7 days . 
  in this case , a 15 days hold will be applied to your market listing ( you 'll have to wait 15 days before a player can buy it ) . 
  it was released in beta 6 years ago . 
  release :, 
  ( software ) the distribution of an ** initial ** or new and upgraded version of a computer software product, 
  hey !, 
  what about [ battleblock theater \u00ae ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/238460/battleblock_theater/ ) , [ the trine series ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/721/trinelogy/ ) , [ human : fall flat ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/477160/human_fall_flat/ ) or [ ibb & obb ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/95400/ibb__obb/ ) ? 
  there is also [ keep talking and nobody explodes ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/keep_talking_and_nobody_explodes/ ) which is an awesome game that works very well even remotely . 
  you should take an hour or two to review the manual with him though , as it may be a bit complicated else ( for his age ) . 
  aw , sorry , just discovered human : fall flat only worked in local . 
  i know you can play any local coop game remotely thanks to [ this trick ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/45bq98/psa_you_can_play_any_game_coop_with_an_nvidia/ ) , but it seems like your nephew 's graphic card is n't powerful enough to handle nvidia experience . 
  here are some more games to replace it : [ shift happens ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/359840/shift_happens/ ) , [ forced ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/249990/forced_slightly_better_edition/ ) and [ castle crashers ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/castle_crashers/ ) ( there are some burp/fart jokes through the game , you should check it out before buying it as i do n't know if his mom would be okay with that ) . 
  you ca n't right now , as it has n't been officially released , but you 'll probably be able to access it via your [ account page ] ( https://store.steampowered.com/account/ ) once released ( probably when the store updates today or tomorrow ) . 
  new client ui . 
  they did n't talk about mobile . 
  [ even google translate knows ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lhhxbvo.png ) . 
  they 're moving in september iirc . 
  the url tag is added by steam . 
  that 's the problem . 
  because steam discovery queue shows you every single game published on steam . 
  because they would rather work on something they like to do - that makes sense , does n't it ? 
  there 'd be no more developer working on steam , steamworks , dota 2 , tf2 or cs : go if working on a new game would bring them more money . 
  seems awesome . 
  do you have any source ? 
  tabs in file explorer are gon na be a big change . 
  bad bot, 
   refunds on in-game purchases, 
   steam will offer refund for in-game purchases within any valve-developed games ** within forty-eight hours of purchase ** , so long as the in-game item has not been consumed , modified or transferred . 
  third-party developers will have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms . 
  steam will tell you at the time of purchase if the game developer has opted to offer refunds on the in-game item you are buying . 
  otherwise , in-game purchases in non-valve games are not refundable through steam . 
  it should work on all games as long as you use a software such as [ joytokey ] ( http://joytokey.net/en/ ) to convert the controller input in a keyboard input . 
  they said it on the refunds page . 
  probably because that 's a general message and there are no such messages for items . 
  no one decides . 
  news are shown automatically when eurogamer , kotaku , rock , paper , shotgun , pc gamer or shacknews mentions the game you 're currently seeing in your library . 
  i personally find puzzle games relaxing , so here are some coop ones :,

   full time jobs are the best depression killers, 
  it really depends on who . 
  some people are gon na get more depressed before they 're working too much or do n't like their job/coworkers , leading to job stress and potentially to a burnout if not treated before . 
  they 're working on 3 vr games . 
  saying vr is a gimmick while you probably never tried it is hilarious . 
  how will this protect them ?
