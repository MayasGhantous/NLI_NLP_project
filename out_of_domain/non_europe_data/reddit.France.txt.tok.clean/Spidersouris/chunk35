  you 'll be able to see ** when ** they got many positive or negative reviews . 
  the actual system will not be changed - you 'll only be able to see more information thanks to these histograms , such as positive and negative reviews per day ( which is already the case with the recent reviews section , by the way , except it is limited to 30 days ) . 
  i do n't see how this is anti-consumerist . 
  please stop reposting this thread . 
   these changes will not be implemented until the new hero build builder is implemented, 
  i really hope to see it soon !, 
  making guide creation easier is a big thing . 
  i keep seeing this kind of post since approximatively two weeks - sorry if this is n't a repost , but seemed to be pretty similar . 
  i do n't understand anything . 
  since a user posted a thread about these articles a week ago , we get another post about these every day while there was none a while back . 
  what happened ? 
  they 've always done articles like that , referencing games so they can appear in the steam articles feed , it 's just that you never noticed it because you were n't looking at this section often . 
  i never said that . 
  but reposting a thread multiple times , even if it contains good suggestions , is n't something that should be done , as it is spam . 
  see you tomorrow . 
   i killed them, 
  if that means killing your allies , that 's the problem .

  if you 're talking about the last steam client update , [ here 's a changelog ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/news/32384/ ) . 
  developers and publishers , but they 're , most of the time , not destined to be sold on these shady sites - `` scammers '' often request keys to developers/publishers for events , stream/video showcase , etc. 
  once the keys are sent , these guys resell them . 
  by the way , to stop these , valve is going to introduce curator connect , a way for curators to get copies of a game directly from steam , so developers and publishers can make sure they 're sending their games to the right person . 
  ~ 6 hours for the main story . 
  you can go up to +14 hours if you wan na finish absolutely everything ( a + rank on every level , collectibles , etc. 
  it only does for games showing this stats page , such as cs : s or l4d2 . 
  - moved the `` play '' button from 6px, 
  - popular items updated, 
  - some changes to axe 's weapon and phantom assassin 's helmet, 
  - some changes to the steam datagram system, 
  yes .

  it 's not . 
  developers and publishers can add reviews from other websites via steamworks . 
  they 're even localizable . 
  oh , my bad - actually , that 's a feature from steam , but es adds it when the game does n't feature any by default . 
  the comment i linked is op 's one . 
  killahinstinct is a steam moderator . 
  there 's a game called [ koala kids ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/381870/koala_kids/ ) which is a coop puzzle-platformer game , maybe it could interest them ? 
  apparently , [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wldajx2.png ) is what the badge looks like . 
  it 's only available on canary for now . 
  your profile is private , mate . 
  you can from this page : https://store.steampowered.com/account/registerkey/, 
  mm ranks = / = levels ranks, 
  they do n't hand it for free . 
  we paid for the battle pass , which includes this functionality . 
  works fine for me . 
  do you encounter this issue on the website , client , or both ? 
  as a workaround , you can try selecting another language by publishing your review and going to http://steamcommunity.com/id/my/recommended/, 
   basically the best thing for valve would be to not say when they 're doing a vac wave and to not say how many they caught . 
  they do n't say it . 
  it 's only tracked by steamdb .

  [ here 's a list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/androidgaming/comments/4aixyw/complete_list_of_good_android_games_and_ports_for/ ) published on r/androidgaming . 
  you should also check out the [ touch-friendly games ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857883-touch-friendly-games/?appid=268200 ) curator . 
  not all games may be port from mobile , but i guess you 'll be able to find some which aere . 
  [ cheap low end games ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7414568/ ) and [ good games for your crappy pc ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6865355/ ) curators could help you out . 
  you could check r/lowendgaming too . 
  this happens when the game is n't out yet or has been removed from the steam store . 
  achievements are n't shown on the game store page , so they probably forgot to make them visible publicly . 
  some people encounter the same issue and [ posted about it on the game forums ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682616370834/ ) . 
  [ starbound ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/starbound/ ) is similar to terraria if you want to give it a try . 
  about ? 
  maybe use [ sharex ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/400040/sharex/ ) ? 
  sniper, 
  depends if you 're talking about singleplayer or multiplayer games . 
  if a singleplayer game has no players , i do n't care as it will not impact my experience in any way , while if a multiplayer game has less than 1000 players , i would n't buy it . 
  battle pass expires on two hours or so . 
  items related to it expire on october 1st . 
  dota wiki messed up these two . 
  because refunds are not a way for trying games . 
  yeah , one game . 
  if you do that for 15 or 20 games , they 're gon na disable the refund functionality for you . 
  you can play any hero , even if you did n't make 25 games yet . 
  these are just recommendations .
