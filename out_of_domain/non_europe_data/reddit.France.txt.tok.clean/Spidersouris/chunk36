  they said that on the blog post , but this is n't actually true . 
  they 're just grayed out but still pickable . 
  firewatch ? 
  only as a custom game . 
  what does it have to do with this patch ? 
  they said it yesterday in their blogpost announcing the frostivus contest . 
  will it be available on firefox , too ? 
  one of the big downsides of sih is it 's only available on chrome . 
  actually , they posted it a day before this particular patch . 
  wow . 
  we arrived at this point . 
  developers and publishers are willing to do everything just to get a click and maybe a sale . 
  this has nothing to do with the drama . 
  the same thing happens for a lot of items every day . 
  kotaku , what do you except ? 
  if steam guard is activated on your account , you must enter the steam guard code shown into the app before changing your email address , and , once changed , an email is also sent to the old email address so you can revert this change . 
  workshop showcases are n't designed to include animated artwork . 
  you have a showcase specifically designed for this kind of thing . 
  it can only open the steam store page of the product ( in this instance , http://store.steampowered.com/app/275030/punch_viacad_2d3d_v9__3d_printing_powerpack_lt/ ) . 
  their goal is making people click on it so they get redirected to the store page , and maybe get a sale or two out of millions of clicks . 
  rust is still an early access game , so you ca n't blame the developers . 
  plus they only have one , which is obviously a placeholder achievement . 
  regarding bdo , though , that 's another matter . 
  no , you ca n't get vac banned because of using sam . 
  some people say you can get vac banned if you 're unlocking achievements from a game featuring vac ** while ** it 's launched . 
  as long as you 're not unlocking achievements while the game is launched , you 're perfectly fine . 
  indeed - only one is shown on its store page and on its preview in the steam library though as they 're not fully initialized ( which mean they 're , for now , placeholders ) . 
  did n't play rust since 2013 so i could n't tell if they were working or not . 
  the swastika is used on the nsdap 's flag . 
  alright , sure . 
  but you ca n't deny the fact that the swastika was used on the nazi party 's flag and is thus , these days , associated with nazism or racial supremacy . 
  when people are going to see a swastika , most of the time , they 're immediately going to think about nazis and not about hinduism or something else . 
  even if it has other uses , some people may be shocked when it is used as for the reasons i listed above . 
   [ it 'll be too close to the nazi sign and it 'll just cause a lot of unwanted hate . 
  just use something else .
