  hello . 
  so i have a problem , i ca n't hear my teammates in mm games . 
  i tested in casual games , and it works well ( after i type voice_enable 1 in the console ) , but otherwise , it does n't work . 
  i tested to type the command in a mm game , but nothing . 
  when i type `` voice_show_mute '' in the console , there is all the players on the servers , but when i type `` voice_unmute all '' , it said '' `` all connected players have been unmuted . 
  '' '' , but i ` ts always the same , everyone is muted . 
  i have tested these commands :, 
  - voice enable 1/0, 
  - voice_system_enable 1/0, 
  - voice_scale 1/0, 
  - voice_unmute, 
  - voice_unmute all, 
  - voice_caster_scale 0.850000, 
  i really do n't know what to do ... 
  i need your help !, 
  thanks !, 
  best regards ,, 
  hello !,

  hello !, 
  i 'd like to know , if i ` ts possible that the logitech software switch profile while ingame on the g910 . 
  i know it might not be clear , so here is an example : i 've created a cs : go profile on the logitech software . 
  is there a way , that , when i launch cs : go , the logitech software switchs automatically to the cs : go profile , so i can have my custom keys for the game ? 
  i 've already tried god-g910 , but there is a loooot of bugs , like switching profile for no reason while in game , and things like that , and i ca n't contact the developer cause there is no email in his app , and i checked his website , no email neither .
