  hello !, 
  i checked the games tab yesterday and found that some games i launched were verified ( mad max , rocket league ... ) and some were n't ( portal , for example ) . 
  i 'd like to know how the verification process works . 
  for example , if a large amount of people use a program , will it eventually gets verified ? 
  also , i remember that some time ago there was a thread where we could post games so they could be verified . 
  it seems like this thread disappeared . 
  could someone please confirm this ? 
  thanks !, 
  hey !, 
  i 'm an `` owner '' of a discord server and we got 5 admins there . 
  an admin created a voice and text channel and configured it so no one can see the text channel and no one can enter in the voice channel . 
  however , i , as an owner , can still enter in these channels . 
  it is a huge issue actually because sometimes i join his voice channel by accident , that kind of stuff . 
  would it be possible to add an option like this , please ? 
  thanks !,
