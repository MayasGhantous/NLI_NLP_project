  i 've also seen this : http://i.imgur.com/dnlxzbr.png - so the preview in nightly option is right here . 
  it would be cool if i could set it for other files too . 
  i use firefox nightly 50.0 a1 ( 2016-06-21 ) . 
  thanks !,

  it appears these screenshots have been taken by [ tristan reidford ] ( http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/tristan_reidford ), 
  call it a shitpost or not , whatever . 
  so after the l4d3 leak , i noticed that a lot of employees that worked on left 4 dead 1 and 2 were actually playing a lot left 4 dead 2 during these last weeks , probably testing l4d3 but steam shows l4d2 instead of l4d3 ( to avoid leaks , of course . . ) . 
  you 've maybe noticed too that the summer sale headers were getting more and more darker and creepy . 
  also , each header correspond with one card : for example , the first card and the first header are basically the same . 
  each header `` follows '' the theme of the card . 
  however , there is only 10 cards for 11 headers . 
  and there could n't be the `` encore sale '' header since there 's no more daily deals and that kind of stuff . 
  you maybe see what i 'm getting at , so let 's go :, 
  since the two left 4 dead episodes were released on november ( precisely , the two episodes released on the same date , november 17th ) , i think left 4 dead 3 will be announced during the last header ( since there 's none matching with the cards since there will all be used since then ) , so on sunday , july 3rd , and will get released in november . 
  i think that it will let enough time to build the hype and stuff ( l4d2 was announced at e3 , so that 's almost the same time period ) . 
  you may think that this post is a shitty one but it 's not , i 'm doing it seriously . 
  i do n't say there will be something , that 's just an hypothesis . 
  believe it or not , that 's your choice !, 
  thanks . 
  ps : pls do n't backstab me if this is n't true , it 's just an hypothesis, 
  ps2 : like , really . 
  pls . 
  ps3 : if , eventually , there 's nothing , you can still watch the sgdq : https://gamesdonequick.com/,

  hey !, 
  since this morning , i ca n't access to the steam community , neither via the steam client or my browser ( firefox nightly 50.0 a1 ( 2016-07-18 ) ) . 
  i can access the steam store but not the community . 
  on my browser , the page keeps trying to load forever . 
  on steam , i got a grey background ( http://puu.sh/q711y/53ff9c2c43.png ) . 
  i do n't know what to do . 
  i did n't install something specific or anything , i 've checked my firewall and my proxy and everything 's fine . 
  thanks !, 
  hello !,

  i 'd like to know , in the event i can not download the application directly via the play store , what apk version of pok\u00e9mon go should i choose to play it without any problem ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  hey !, 
  i 'd like to update to windows 10 anniversary update but i ca n't find how long it takes to update . 
  could someone who updated , or someone that heard something about it , could tell me ? 
  thanks !, 
  yup . 
  edit : the steam community seems to be back up . 
  according to a new faq which is not published yet , steam controller dongles will soon be sold on the steam store . 
  i know a lot of you guys here wanted to be able to buy dongles , so that 's why i decided to post this . 
  well , it 's coming soon !, 
  hello ,, 
  so i have my zenfone 2 since some months now and since the start , my phone has a problem :, 
  when i plug earphones or headphones , there 's a static noise on the left earphone ( or on the left side of the headphone ) . 
  i contacted asus , they told me to update my firmware , which i did ( i even updated to mm today ) , but it did n't fix the issue . 
  so they told me to rma it . 
  i 'm just posting this to know if someone here got the same problem and if he fixed it . 
  i saw a post on a forum which said to deactivate every single sound ( notification , etc ) and only activate multimedia sounds . 
  for some reason , it worked , and i did n't ear the static noise again but some days later . 
  i tried to do this operation again but it does n't seem to work . 
  thanks for your help ,, 
  best regards ,, 
  so , i do n't know if it happens only to me or not , but i noticed that i feel really better while drinking something just after i ate something . 
  does some of you are feeling this too ? 
  and if so , do you know why ? 
  thanks !,

  help me out please . 
  must wake up in 5 hours . 
  i 'm using tasker since one month now but i still need to learn a lot of things . 
  in any case , i 'm really happy to have joined your community , you guys are really cool and always give me new ideas . 
  so i 'd like to know if it 's possible to add a task which activates each week at a certain time . 
  actually , i wan na restart my phone automatically when i sleep each week so it 's `` fresh '' if you know what i mean . 
  my phone is n't rooted but i know i can use autotouch , open the system options , select restart and ok . 
  if someone could help me out , that 'd be great . 
  thanks for reading and stay awesome .

  hello ,, 
  i 'm using touchtask since some time now , but it seems there are some problems occurring while the phone is idled . 
  for example , i made a task so at 8am the display brightness is at 100 % , asus splendid is opened and balance mode is selected . 
  then , once done , go home and kill the app . 
  i noticed that when my phone was idled , the app would n't kill and the balance mode would n't be selected . 
  however , i tried to run the task via tasker multiple times , and it always worked . 
  so did i do something work , or does touchtask is n't able to function properly while the phone is idled ? 
  thanks !, 
  hello guys ,, 
  so i played gta v months ago and now i wanted to play it again . 
  however , when i launch it from steam , the launcher opens , then disappears , but nothing happens . 
  if i check my task manager , i can see gta v is here and is consuming ~ 70mb and 0 % from my processor . 
  i already contacted rockstar support but it did not help me . 
  maybe you guys can help me to resolve the problem . 
  i 'm a bit desperate since i basically searched everywhere on the internet , tried every single thing and it does n't work . 
  thanks for your help ,, 
  i use kwlp since some weeks now and it 's really cool . 
  it increased my productivity by at least 200 % haha . 
  however , there 's a little problem , but which is pretty annoying . 
  i use nova launcher , and i bound some things ( textures , images ) to the `` launch app '' action in klwp . 
  sometimes , when i click on these things , nothing will happens , and i 'll have to touch it a second time so the action can be proceeded . 
  put it that way , that seems to not be that annoying , but when it happens multiple times a day it gets a bit frustrating . 
  it even happens with the nova launcher drawer button .
