  on desura , the game is at 99.99 $, 
  should i delete it ? 
  yes , i 'm french . 
  for usa we say : '' \u00c9tats-unis d'am\u00e9rique '', 
  disturbing , eh ? 
  are you sure ? 
  i thought that the `` number bar '' was at the right and not at the center of the progress bar . 
  july 29th , 2015 `` remove xbox application '', 
  microsoft tech ? 
  i remember that i 've edited a game 's file and got it . 
  edit : yea , that 's that : http://www.themutegamer.com/guide/the-stanley-parable/unachievable-achievement/, 
  the achievement is n't impossible . 
  mine is only 2.73 gb : /, 
  did n't updated since 5 hours from now haha, 
  same, 
  did n't ran setup.exe , i 'm restarting now , tell ya ', 
  i restarted and opened windows update , i had two new updates : one optional , and one important ( 3,4 mb in total ) . 
  i have to restart again . 
  and for the question you 've asked to kirekkusupt :, 
   do you have automatic updates turned on ? 
  i have automatic updates turned on , yes . 
  edit : can not do the optional one now , ( error code 8024402c ) , must restart first, 
  edit 2 : i 'm doing the optional one now ( kb3055343 ), 
  i had the update fail , and i have the $ windows folder , but my install.esd is only 2,7 gb . 
  thoughts ? 
  i have only 2,7 gb : /, 
  yea , it has been 8 hours i 'm stuck with 2,7 gb , i 've made updates , restarted my computer several times , but nothing . 
  now i do n't have anymore updates to do . 
  the update to windows 10 also failed two times ( like written in the op post ), 
  but i 've seen something : the size of the leaked esd files ( https://www.reddit.com/r/windows10/comments/3ee1gx/windows_10_10240_esd_download_here/ ) is 2,6 gb , so i do n't know what microsoft needs to download more ... we 'll see . 
  countdown here : http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=windows+10+release&amp;iso=20150729t00&amp;p1=179 - and yes i think we can update at this moment , but i 'm french and it will be the night in france so yea i will sleep haha, 
  but i thought of something : maybe some guys thinks that the 5gb/6gb size is the size of the $ windows-bt folder , and not only the esd file . 
  in this case , my $ windows-bt folder is 6,2 gb and my esd file is 2,7 gb , like in the thread i 've posted above . 
  you should probably wait . 
  if you do n't get the update at least 20 minutes after the end of the countdown , try this . 
  but i ` ts not recommended : /, 
  click on `` view history update '' in windows update ( do n't know if i ` ts the correct string 'cause i 'm on a french windows , but i ` ts something like that ), 
  same thing, 
  my folder is 6,3 gb , but i have `` preparing for installation '' since a long time ... what can i do ? 
  when this version will be out ? 
  all my macros ( g key ) does n't work anymore :( ( logitech g910 ), 
  yep , me too . 
  omg i think i did n't ... what can i do ? 
  nice , thanks !, 
  i think [ clover ] ( http://ejie.me/ ) is better . 
  no name for now , no string on sts . 
  but i do n't think we 'll see someone with 7000 games soon . 
  the macros of my g910 keyboard does n't work : /, 
  volume_mak channel, 
  windows 10 professional, 
   unfortunately there is no way to activate it by voice like `` ok , google '' works , but microsoft works on it . 
  `` hey , cortana '' ? 
  hey christina , an off-topic question : when does a new update of lgs for windows 10 will be available ? 
  'cause on my g910 , the macro keys does n't work anymore , since i 'm on windows 10 : /,

  it works on windows 10 too , but yea . 
  why does my post has been removed ? 
  hey !, 
  thanks for your reply . 
  how can i switch to html5 , please ? 
  edit : on this page : https://www.youtube.com/html5?hl=fr - i have this : `` the html5 player is currently used when possible . 
  '' , so i do n't think the problem comes from flash . 
  yea , sorry i did n't say that on my first post . 
  nightly 43.0 a1 ( 2015-08-28 ) . 
  thanks !, 
  yep , that works .

  apparently , there is a bug on nightly like / u/evilpies said it, 
  wooo !, 
  it seems like i ` ts working again !, 
  thanks a lot .
