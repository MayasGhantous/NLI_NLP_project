  like i said in my psot , i already tried in safe mode and nothing changed . 
  here 's the crash stats link : https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/4b260f78-feec-4e55-aa48-02a302150926, 
  yay , finally !, 
  thanks op !, 
  `` step 2 / 3 - we 've sent a code to confirm your identity to 13tille13@web.de . '', 
  and if we look in the files found in dota , we can see that hl3 has open world rpg elements . 
  the magazine predicted that hl3 will have open world rpg elements . 
  does the steam controller makes a lot of noise ? 
  cause i 've seen this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qjomzvkzzu and yea , it looks disturbing : /, 
  did you received it ? 
  if yes , when ingame with an headset and music/sound of the game , did you hear these clicky buttons ? 
  thank you . 
  someone should create a website or a subreddit with controller configurations for specific games , like steamgriddb, 
  [ nubs ' adventure ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/401280 ) is a nice and cute platform/metroidvania game , i finished it in 6 hours and that was really great . 
  you should definitely check it out . 
  thanks , got mine, 
  actually that 's not a dlc , but a '' [ free stand-alone game ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/247120/ ) '' ( you do n't need portal 2 to play ), 
  because valve does n't host cs : go tournaments . 
  ti is a valve owned and run tournament whilst cologne , for example , is an esl tournament . 
  cs : go majors are sponsored by valve , but they do n't run them . 
  esl does . 
  horizontal integration offers benefits and disadvantages ... 
  fake, 
  same , i picked up `` bomber ... '' , that was an item with the head of bomberman , and i unlocked platinum god + all the new challenges, 
  i killed him with isaac , with 0.5 heart left :d, 
  i wonder too , i had no money left unfortunately haha, 
  wow !, 
  do you have any screenshots ? 
  have a heart : max heart container , item rooms , start as isaac with `` charm of the vampire '' , red hearts do n't spawn, 
  l4d3 confirmed, 
  same , that 's weird , a lot of people already have the controller and no config for tf2 . 
  i think that 's a bug . 
  valve 's adding specific options for tf2 configs ( like select taunt , show scoreboard , show contracts ) . 
  i 'm french too and received it yesterday \\ o /, 
  instead of removing the old templates , they should just add a red text next to it with `` outdated '' , or something like this . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but that 's not the first time we get a daily with the lost . 
  nope , i ` ts something irl . 
  if it was ig , the dataminers would have know everything already ( + ed said the same thing ) . 
  we have to go at notch 's house, 
  if you had a run in greed mode before the update , you can continue it . 
  maybe there 's something hidden after you beat mega greed ? 
  edit : it crashes as soon as you 're using a trapdoor to go to the next stage, 
  remco space commander, 
  - that 's a walkie talkie . 
  what 's the mod you 're using to show damages ? 
  no sir pls giv me moni, 
  thank you mate < 3, 
  he did , just look at the thread 's title : http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3amao2hppyockj%3awww.jeuxvideo.com%2fforums%2f1-50-171272235-1-0-1-0-attentats-le-13-novembre.htm%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fr, 
  `` respawn '' is just the second version of this french website , this has nothing to do with the thread . 
  the first post is just the lyrics of this french song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpkcaidkqt8, 
  the second one :, 
  `` i was with 4 friends and drank 3 glass of vodka , i 'm plastered and was checked 4 times by the police . 
  i fought against a man without taking one punch from him . 
  i got mad at my cousin and i think i 'll throw up . '', 
  sorry for the translation , it may not be very good . 
  maybe because nothing happened last year and he thought : `` hmm , maybe this year there will be something ? 
  let 's try to bump it . '', 
  why is n't it worth it ? 
  rip, 
  that would be awesome , but i do n't want to disturb you haha , thanks anyway for your replies !, 
  omg mate , you made my day . 
  thank you, 
  it seems the `` just starting out '' ( with the money ) achievement is broken . 
  does anyone find the orange ? 
  ( orange thief achievement ), 
  edit : found this in the output_log . txt file :,

  so that 's probably why some achievements are n't working . 
  edit2 : i sent an email to crows crows crows , the coder knows that and dom will tell me when it 'll be fixed . 
  same . 
  i picked up serpent 's kiss on basement 1 and tech x on caves xl . 
  no black hearts dropped during all my run . 
  after the update ? 
  yes it does , https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/3vp91y/new_update_for_december_6_2015/cxpgvjo, 
  great !, 
  gon na test it when the crash bug is fixed, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/3vpfxu/sacrifice_rooms_were_reworked/ - so that 's not from the daily run, 
  the steam controller isnt bad mate , you do n't even tested it and you 're saying that i ` ts like shit . 
  i have the steam controller and i like to play cs : go with the gyro . 
  it just needs a lot of practice but at a certain point it becomes enjoyable . 
  oh , sorry , when i saw your comment i thought you were criticizing it . 
  my bad, 
  do you know how to reproduce this bug ? 
  if so i can contact a cm from valve . 
  this video is private . 
  when i tried to reproduce it , the `` highlighted '' buttons are a bit moved , but not that much : http://i.imgur.com/vrliuzt.png - did you do something specific ? 
  i 'll keep you updated . 
  i do n't think that 's that easy . 
  i mean , all the publishers would have to agree with steam , and i 'm quite sure a lot would n't . 
  same thing , valve does n't price the games , the publishers does and they 're choosing themselves the discount for their games during sales . 
  plus , for some games , maybe steam would n't get as much money as the game 's price ( what i mean is that valve have to give money to the customer and to the publisher , so maybe valve would get only 3 $ while the game is priced 5 $ during sales ) .
