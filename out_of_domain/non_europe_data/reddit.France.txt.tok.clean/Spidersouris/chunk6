  in 8 hours and 26 minutes, 
  there 's no more sign in the 3rd image for the translated versions . 
  ( french included ), 
  i already said this on the discord channel , but i know the guy who translated this and contacted him . 
  he said that he kept these infos because of the `` los angeles ' 40s ambient '' . 
  i do n't really know what that means but whatever . 
  here 's his original reply if anyone wants it , because why not . 
  edit : fixing typo . 
  http://store.steampowered.com/app/401280/ - that 's really a wonderful indie game . 
  middle click on the `` search on the market '' button ? 
  they do , you receive one coupon when you craft a badge ( aside from the big steam sales ) . 
  `` reaper '' is just this : http://www.reaper.fm/, 
  yup , you can even craft them after the end of the holiday steam sale . 
  this . 
  stop with this , actually that was just a reference to the `` rally '' which took place on sts . 
  if there 's an arg , that 's only on sts , that only concerns sts members and that 's not related to the current arg . 
  you 're just wasting your time . 
   actually that 's just a joke about the #karaoke channel - anyway if you think that this does n't get his place on this subreddit , np :d, 
  screenshot or fake, 
  there 's a ( pretty similar ? ), 
  problem with rocket league . 
  like , sometimes when i launch the game and turn on my steam controller , rl detects it as a 2nd player . 
  keyboard & mouse works fine , but the sc is the 2nd player . 
  ( anyway , maybe i 'm really off-topic here and did n't understand what you meant exactly , sorry ), 
  if you love it why do you want to change it ? 
  because he made a mistake at first , he wrote `` 2 year '' instead of `` 1 year '' . 
  team fortress 2 ?!, 
  why ? 
  that also means that i doubt we 'll get flash/daily deals again, 
  from a limited category ( there 's not any `` campaign '' tag for example ), 
  [ link to the game on steam ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/404700 ), 
  sure , i never said it was n't !, 
  and . . 
  i do n't have access to my account :(, 
  actually i created it some years ago , and i ca n't remember exactly what the replies to my secret questions are , and the mailbox i used to register has been shut down some months ago , so yea . 
  i contacted mojang support yesterday and provided cobalt 's transaction id . 
  this game has always been free : https://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/price?plain=serena, 
  nah , i just think that 's related to this : http://steamcommunity.com/games/353370/announcements/detail/913471708586959741, 
  that 's not a big steam sale , so nope . 
  badges are only for winter and summer sales . 
  hello !, 
  nope , you 'll ca n't gift cs : go to one of your friends . 
  here 's the message that appears on the cart page when you add the pack to your cart :, 
  counter-strike complete : according to our records , you already own one or more of the items included in this package on steam . 
  if purchasing for yourself , you will not receive an extra copy of :, 
  counter-strike : global offensive, 
  counter-strike : global offensive - sdk, 
  if he buys the package , he 'll receive every game included in this package . 
  if he already has a game from the package , nothing will happen : he 'll not receive any additional copy . 
  sales will be the same . 
  if they 're not already in sale , i highly doubt they 'll be solded because now sales are the same , from the start to the end . 
  i can only recommand you pony island . 
  i loved playing it . 
  nope . 
  only big sales does ( summer and winter sales ), 
  that 's not a big steam sale , so nope . 
  badges are only for winter and summer sales . 
  here are two other links :, 
  i think too that his intentions are n't bad , but he really fucked up on this one . 
  plus , not all the employees are listed on this page, 
  that 's called voluntary man . 
  some people do n't speak english at all and they need a localization so they can understand everything . 
  i 'm pretty sure that a lot of people would n't have played some games without a localization . 
  you 're so arrogant and selfish, 
  february 29th, 
  hahaha, 
  2 $ for a car . . srsly ? 
  stop downvoting me pls rocket league fanboys, 
  i can find a baguette for 1 $, 
  yea ... to most people . 
  they 're really improving on that point tho , actually they 're listening to the community and fixing various bugs or issues ( just check r/globaloffensive ), 
  http://i.imgur.com/ve35udz.png for those who can not access to the website, 
  actually that 's a mistake from them , i think that it 'll be available at 799chf since it is listed at this price on digitech : https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/htc-vive-vr-brillen-5679454, 
  `` with tax '', 
  france : 73.20 $, 
  if you are trying to pre-order vive and receive an `` out of stock '' message , please refresh your page . 
  the vive is 6kg, 
  vive is 6kg, 
  please, 
  i do n't understand exactly why / u/jshackles stops his project . 
  i mean , ok you 'll not be able to sell cards after 15 days if you do n't have a mobile authenticator ( steam desktop authenticator exists , by the way ) , but that does n't change anything for cards drops ... it seems like you 're a bit egocentric . 
  so why does n't he say this instead of saying it is because of trade and market holds just because he does n't like these ? 
  can we craft signs ? 
  what happens if you walk too often on crops ? 
  penarium , please ? 
  wow , thx a lot man < 3, 
  switchcars , please !, 
  thanks for this giveaway .

  `` just like humans , rabbits become bored if their environments remain the same , so can benefit from variety and occasional change of scenery . 
  however , too much change can have adverse effects . 
  a wild rabbit 's survival depends on an intimate knowledge of its surroundings in order to escape from predators , so structural changes to the `` warren '' of a rabbit kept as a pet should be kept subtle , such as changing their toys and regularly providing new ones . '', 
  that 's a pretty cool fact :d,
