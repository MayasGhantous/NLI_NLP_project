  this one seems to load correctly , even if it took some seconds to load it completely ( but i 've been able to see it without any freeze or anything ) . 
  toggle the hd button off seems to help on this one , but not on all apparently ( for example , this one : https://gfycat.com/rapidsilkyaustrianpinscher ), 
  yes , i 'm in france . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , i do with cs : go clips or r/gaming clips in general . 
  all these clips are surprisingly smooth , no freeze or anything . 
  so could the freezes be because of a high bitrate ? 
  yeah , i can test on a tablet . 
  what do i have to do ? 
  here 's a steam forum post which resumes well my opinion and i think you should read it :, 
   that 's because `` quality control '' is subjective . 
  valve does n't want to put itself in the position of telling us what products we are and are not allowed to purchase . 
  they want the power of making that decision in the hands of the customers . 
  overall it 's probably a good thing . 
  once you decide on having quality control you have to decide where to set the bar and have a process to evaluate everything . 
  and quite a few good games probably never would have made it on steam because at first glance they look kinda iffy . 
  and people buy games for different reasons . 
  sometimes they want to be challenged by a fast-pased game with intense action , sometimes they want to be challenged on a more intellectual level , sometimes they want to relax and not be challenged at all , sometimes they want a good story , sometimes all they want is a laugh . 
  at takes all kinds of games to satisfy all the reasons people have for playing them . 
  back when i was in college my friends and i would have what we called `` heckle night '' . 
  occasionally on a friday or saturday night we 'd all get together and one of us would have gone and rented the absolute worst movies they could find at the local rental place . 
  and we 'd sit around and drink beer and make fun of the movies all night long . 
  it was a lot of fun . 
  not everything has to be good quality to have entertainment value . 
  and yea , totally not buying this game but i support it 's right to exist on steam . 
  ^ [ source ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/448660/discussions/0/385428458173243716/#c385428458173762427 ), 
  so yeah , just ignore them , mark them as `` not interested '' or whatever . 
  anyways , people will always complain about these games but they 'll always be bought because some people likes play to these or just test them , because whatever , that 's their life after all , they do whatever they want to do . 
  also , from what i 've heard , lord kres have been banned from the greenlight system . 
  a little glitchy but great game fun . 
  literally 4 reviews out of like 12 say that , yeah seems sketchy . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  just tested and it is the same . 
  i guess the answer is pretty clear now , uh ? 
  hey !, 
  first , thank you for this kind initiative and giveaway , and i wish you a really happy birthday . 
  soo , i 'm gon na participate and hope that i 'll win the game that i want - human resource machine . 
  why ? 
  first , because it is on sale ( haha :d ) , and second because i think this game can be pretty interesting . 
  i like to play puzzle games and a combo of puzzle + programming is an awesome thing for me cause i 'm really interested in programming . 
  as requested , here 's my steam profile : http://steamcommunity.com/id/spidersouris/, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  that 's good, 
  well i got downvoted i do n't even know why but yeah . 
  i think that 's good if he can find more vulnerabilities so valve can fix them, 
  ftfy, 
  eh , i should have read it so . 
  only saw the title and thought it was going to be a good thing, 
  well okay , actually i did n't read the article , only the title . 
  thanks for the explanation, 
  all servers are down, 
  did you even read my post ? 
  refund requests are , most of the time , automatic . 
  well , i preferred the last one but yeah, 
  if there 's a way to use the last one , could someone reply , please ? 
  that 'd be awesome, 
  no , that 's unreal engine 3 + a lightning solution developed by illuminate labs and dice, 
  got apocalypse hotel - the post-apocalyptic hotel simulator !, 
  thanks !, 
  how did you do it ? 
  you can maybe try to sell it on a website like spreadshirt or something like that if the devs are okay , that would be awesome, 
  i 'm pretty sure this will not do anything . 
  if they do n't want to do it , they wo n't do it since valve is a flat organization . 
  i think they already know that the steam client could be updated and improved since there 's multiple posts about this on r/steam , other subreddits related to valve , on steam forums too , and i 'm pretty sure some employees often receive e-mails about this . 
  i think we just have to wait unfortunately , and see if something changes one day ( anyhow , they 'll have to update it at some point or another , they ca n't keep that 2010 version forever ) . 
  binding of isaac expansions adds , most of the time , new floors , new items , new enemies , new rooms ( not floors , room !, 
  ) , new bosses and new endings . 
  totally !, 
  how did you access to these files ? 
  there are only unity files in my folder :(, 
  i know it has been late since this post but do you know how to do ? 
  maybe in 2 hours and 30 min , when the store updates . 
  happy birthday !, 
  the official one . 
  the arg started on march 5th , 2010 . 
  what about the red herring badge ? 
  well , the red herring arg lasts 1/2 weeks . 
  i actually participated in this arg since the start and we were on a discord channel . 
  we were searching clues and stuff in the comic , and finally after some audio decryption , we found this link , so i guess it involved actual investment too . 
  yeah , i see your point . 
  will there ever be a hoops competitive mode ? 
  2.5 m x 2m, 
  this string is n't new . 
  it has been established but never added to these pages . 
  this string is n't new . 
  it has been established but never added to these pages . 
  you can use prime as long as you have a phone number linked to your steam account . 
   i 'd do that shit for free it 's really not hard, 
  i think it is low because players prefer to play in competitive . 
  i 'm quite sure that if psyonix add hoops competitive a huge number or players gon na play it . 
  would it be possible to have an option so it could chose whatever game from all steam games ? 
  ( even those we do n't have ),
