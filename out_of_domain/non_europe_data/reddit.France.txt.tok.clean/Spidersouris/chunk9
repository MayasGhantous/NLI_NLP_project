  i wonder why they put this version in this bundle so :( but from what i 've seen in the forum the game is vive compatible even if there 's some bugs, 
  steam trading cards are just cards dropping when you play the game . 
  you can then resell them or craft badges with them to gain some xp and level up ( on steam ) . 
  for more information about this , please visit this [ page ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards ) . 
  there are still steam codes available , do n't worry !, 
   * official date, 
   * no leak, 
  nope . 
  i mean , you 're saying it 's an official date but how can you know if it 's an official one if there 's no link or source ? 
  and please / r/steam , why are you even downvoting milkgames ? 
  it also needs a graphic rework . 
  it has n't been updated since its creation . 
  thanks for this reply , i 'm a bit more reassured now :p, 
  what happens if you choose feb 31st ? 
  downvote incoming for saying that grey market sites were bad, 
  nothing . 
  because ufc-que choisir is useless . 
  overwatch is n't on steam . 
  i only subscribe on a website after reading their sa and if i 'm okay with it . 
  go in steamvr options and check the `` enable screenshots ( beta ) '' box . 
  then press the trigger and system button while ingame .

  the last events were really cool too imho . 
  there are more community-based . 
  for example , the monster summer game was nice because you had to try to be in the best room so you could have the max level badge , and people were creating scripts and stuff so as many players as possible could get it . 
  the steam winter arg was awesome . 
  i was one of the first to join / r/steamsaledetectives and we had so much fun talking on discord , trying to find clues , etc. . and then , after the arg , some events were organized on discord and that was really really cool . 
  it is above $ 3.5 ** on sale ** . 
  it is $ 9.99 right now . 
  [ notgtav ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/369580/?snr=1_7_7_ut2_150_2 ) is quite fun but it 's mostly a parody game , so if you do n't like this kind of game , you should skip it . 
  [ downwell ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/?snr=1_7_7_ut2_150_2 ) is really cool . 
  that 's a rogue-like where you have to go as low as possible . 
  [ refunct ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/406150/?snr=1_7_7_ut2_150_2 ) is a nice game , a calm first-person platformer . 
  [ hexcells ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/?snr=1_7_7_ut2_150_2 ) is a minesweeper-like game . 
  i recommand it ( and the other games of the serie ) .

  guardian is a professional cs : go player and has sponsors so he can get a lot of money and skins . 
  this man does n't even have cs : go or any other game on his account . 
  no friends , nothing , just very rare and expensive skins . 
  why ? 
  i do n't really care about his clips as long as i can know all valve 's major news asap . 
  valve does n't set bundles price . 
  publishers/developers does , however .

  she/he was . 
  actually , there 's more than the transgender discrimination for this case . 
  two communities have been shut down on the steam translation server , so that means italian and spanish players got every new in-game update in english and not in their native language , that 's a pretty huge problem and that only happened because this translator was fired . 
  the thing is this article does n't talk about enough thing . 
  it just says `` a translator has been fired because he/she was a transgender '' . 
  there 's more than that , and unfortunately people will just say `` lmao , i 've been discriminated too , that 's not a valid reason , blah blah blah '' . 
  the translator we are talking about in this article is n't a sts translator , she/he was a valve employee . 
  oh also , do n't you think that the shutdown of two sts communities is n't a proof ? 
  you 're really pathetic . 
  you 're saying `` transgender discrimination . . what the fuck is that ? '', 
  like if this thing did n't exist . 
  it does . 
  nobody needs to give any right to anyone . 
  we 're on a public `` forum '' website . 
  steam client webhelper is the chrome-based embedded browser of steam . 
  that 's what you use to browse the store or the community via the steam client or even to browse the web while in-game , for example . 
  since you 're in offline mode but still have internet , i think that 's why it is opened . 
  i doubt you ca n't deactivate it however . 
   for today, 
  there 's a lot more than 3000 titles on steam . 
  except they ca n't do events like this anymore because there 's too many breaches . 
  ( creating multiple accounts to get more games , etc. . ), 
  how ? 
  they ca n't ban the ip ( dynamic ip addresses ) or anything . 
  what solutions do you got ? 
  so we can not play with our friends who , for example , just bought the game or are not very good at it anymore ? 
  nice ... 
  why they do n't add something like `` if you 're friend with someone since 1 year and that player is in your party , the restriction is canceled '' ? 
  for me , the main interest of the game is the competitive . 
  playing with other players who have the same skills as me and trying to improve myself by playing against better players than me . 
  i rarely play unranked playlists . 
  i meant enemy players , i do n't care about my team 's skills . 
  it depends ( for example , if the other team also has one high ranked player and one new player ) . 
  also , if we play against lower ranked players , we 'll be able to rank up ( and i could help my friend who just bought the game to rank up and improve myself ) and so play against better players . 
  that 's not really a good reason . 
  so that means every time a friend of mine buys rocket league , he 'll have to wait till the next reset so we can play together ?
