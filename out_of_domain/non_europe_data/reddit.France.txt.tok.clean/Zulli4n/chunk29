  `` immersion '' ? 
  fuck your immersion , this is bullshit . 
  you want immersion , make a good story , good characters . 
  something i can be attached to . 
  what do i have here ? 
  a dick with no backstory as main character , a fucking young detective with mafioso hairs with the personality of a breeze block , and a woman who ... well , nothing . 
  absolutely fucking nothing on her , she 's just here to fill up the woman quota of the game . 
  wait . 
  did i say the main character had no backstory ? 
  that 's a lie . 
  he has the most forced and ridiculous backstory ever , shit can be written on 5 fucking lines . 
  no spoil here . 
  but just so you know , do n't expect anything . 
  ho and you know what ? 
  that game have closets . 
  mother . 
  closets . 
  why . 
  why . 
  for fuck 's sake why . 
  i do n't want no closets man . 
  who the fuck wants closets . 
  that game is resident evil 4 . 
  but failed . 
  that game is outlast . 
  but failed . 
  it 's 2014 . 
  god , it 's almost 2015 . 
  and that 's all you can come up with , shinji ? 
  an hybrid bastard without imagination who even failed on the gameplay itself ? 
  ( yeah , i forgot , the general feeling sucks ), 
  god . 
  i guess we have nothing to expect anymore . 
  action survival horror is dead , and will be for the next 10 years until it becomes a trend again and some genius independent studio makes something worth it . 
  ( yeah , i was so disappointed that i 'm actually not confident at all about the next silent hills ), 
  do n't make my mistake , guys . 
  do n't buy this game . 
  please . 
   women crush wednesdays . 
  man crush mondays, 
  dresses for men . 
  this is amazing . 
  that kind of question makes me wonder why steam is missing an awesome feature : on the store page of the game , a little `` x people have this game on steam '' . 
  giving an orgasm to my so . 
  but if he 's on video , the mom already have the camera . 
  let me fix that . 
  '' ** mom get the camera ** ! '', 
  - some ** retarded ** kid in a video . 
  the % is just set according to the bet . 
  more people bet on fnatic , less the ldlc % will be . 
  nobody gave ldlc anything , the bets did . 
  god . 
  thank you . 
  see , i just searched `` pubmasters '' on google , and played the first youtube video it gave me . 
  and the first music ... the first music ... '' [ bond - explosive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiaofompobc ) '' . 
  i had it in head , for years . 
  fucking years , since wow vanilla . 
  i never found it . 
  i had just that melody , at 0:42 , looping in my head . 
  i got used to it , but the frustration was awful , i searched for it again and again , but i never found it . 
  this nightmare is finally over . 
  thank you . 
  this video made me realize i played cs : go wrong this whole time . 
  traduction : why ca n't two players kill themselves simultaneously . 
  are the bullets fired by the player who die first negated when he dies ? 
  i already killed and got killed by this person . 
  we fired at the exact same time our awp , and both died . 
  so , i guess it 's possible . 
  just very unlikely . 
  bullets are instant in cs : go , there is no delay between the firing , and the hit , so for something like that to happen , both player need to fire at the exact same time , with a bullet that will actually kill the other . 
  `` yeah , that sounds cool ! '', 
  `` by invitation only . '', 
  well . 
  i. . hu ... 
  what the fuck did just happened . 
  thanks , i guess ? 
  well , believe me or not , i do n't care . 
  it just happened . 
  if i recall correctly , that was on de_dust2 , b tunnel . 
  on the top-right of my screen , i could clearly see the, 
  now , maybe it was a 1 on 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 shot , but it did happened . 
  yeah , i saw that afterward . 
  but hey , `` eu expansion planned '' on the website . 
  what ? 
  ho yeah the invitation . 
  same . 
  then i realized i was just bad . 
  using the money for some badass martial art lesson to kick any ass bothering you seems to me like a smarter way to get rid of that kind of fear . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out this one . 
  gribble hhsssssnyah !!!!!!!, 
  ** 1 year old grapesandmilk ** : ... great , i 'm retarded . 
  any of these things seems awesome and i would n't mind getting one or another , but damn , the ** pc master race playing cards ** ? 
  i 'm playing cards very often , it would be the new step to convert my friends to the master race !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ho ^ ^ ^ wait , ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ already ^ ^ ^ members ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ master ^ ^ ^ race ... 
  til physicists were finally able to replicate the repelling effect of my sex-appeal . 
  i fucking love this meme . 
  i do n't care what you will write on it . 
  this face is killing me every fucking time . 
  i 'm in . 
  sick job dude !,
