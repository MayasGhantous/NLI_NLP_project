  france : because france . 
  i just remember a thing , from a nightmare i had one day . 
  i do n't even recall when i had it , or what happen before . 
  it was one of these nightmare who seems so real at the time , you know . 
  i was in an elevator , going up . 
  suddenly , it stopped . 
  i could feel the goddamn thing shake , and i was thinking `` just tell me that 's not how i die . '' . 
  of course , you can guess what happened next : the elevator fell , for like 5 seconds , and crash . 
  but i 'm not dead . 
  na , it would be too easy , just fell , die , wake up . 
  at this exact moment , my whole body is broken , i can do anthing . 
  i do n't realize i should be screaming being in so much pain . 
  but i ca n't really feel it . 
  i 'm just here , alone , buried under the elevator 's rubble . 
  i ca n't do anything , but feeling the life slowly leaving me . 
  and that , is the worst thing i have ever felt : for me , like i said , this nightmare was real . 
  and i felt like dying . 
  just , absolutely no others feelings than that . 
  then i woke up , screaming and sweating , and remembering each and every details about the goddamn elevator trip , and of course , about the most frightening feeling i ever had . 
  dude , show someone a unicorn and a job in france , and this person will be like `` where the fuck did you get that job ?! '', 
  the free healthcare is good , but it 's a mess government-side . 
  the economy is falling appart . 
  the free education is ... not totally free for one ( but very cheap , yes . 
  ) , and shitty . 
  i mean , the education system in france is shitty , so imagine the free version of shitty . 
  the food is ... yeah ok , our food is awesome . 
  yes . 
  myself . 
  thanks internet for giving me the virtual hug i needed . 
  no i love it . 
  it gives me the feeling that i 'm actually yelling , or i can use it as a comic relief for some jokes . 
  a dead mouse . 
  i 'm a cat . 
  mcdonalds : you 're already fat so , whatever man . 
  my memory is like the worst one ever . 
  i do n't know why my brain choose to remember that one over and over again . 
  when i was like 11 , another dude that used to bully me in my class took my compass , that thing to make circles and shit . 
  i knew he took it , and i wanted it back . 
  but he made a little scratch on it , and then show me the compass and said `` it 's mine , look , did yours had that scratch ? '' . 
  and i was fucked . 
  if i said no , it would be the `` proof '' that it was his compass , so i went with yes , and he just told me `` you lied , i just made it . 
  you 're lying just to get my compass '' . 
  so i just sat here , thinking `` he 's too smart for me . '', 
  now , i 'm an adult . 
  but i still think about that time when i just got brained by that little sucker , and how weak and stupid i was in that time .

  well , if you get gold for making this post , i vote for you op . 
   or maybe your awful current sos that you 've have n't gotten the courage to dump yet . 
  sssh dude , i 'm pretty sure she can read us right now ... 
  smoking . 
  the fact that nobody gave me gold for that comment . 
  kim . 
  more jar jar binks . 
  seriously , that was the worst character ever , do n't they dare make a movie with his goddamn grandson or anything . 
  if i answer `` the reddit gold system sucks '' for absolutely no reason ( god , i do n't even know how that shit works ) , do i get free gold ? 
  i feel like it 's an achievement here . 
  well , people grow up with the values that the older one teach them . 
  it 's the basic principle of education . 
  if your family tell you that something is wrong for years , you listen to them , and if nothing in your life teach you to be open-minded , well you stick with these values for you whole goddamn life . 
  well , would you like to have someone that come and comment every decision you make in your life just to say it 's shitty and you should n't do that ? 
  i do n't think the idea of `` right '' or `` wrong '' applies ( apply ? ), 
  here . 
  just , take care of your own life before trying to mess with others .
