  wish i had the courage to do things like that . 
  can you talk a bit more about your project , and your organization to work on it ? 
  i am a programmer myself , a bit of informations on how other people do these kind of things and motivate themselves is always interresting . 
  the sad part is that he have to pay 50 $ / year to wear this thing . 
  my real name . 
  they will think it 's just my nickname , search for a riddle , an anagram , or just the slightest clue they can find in it , without ever realizing they were staring at my real time all that time . 
  '' - what is the spoon for ? 
  - ho , you know , just for stuff ... like , hu ... drugs ... fuck !, 
  you got me , you 're smart ! '', 
  they did n't used any lube with the ac : u announce , and now they are trying to fill our assholes with more bullshit will it 's spread open .

  pretty dangerous job for a rose . 
  legend a drew , sir you, 
  even if he do n't change , i wo n't recognize him anyway . 
  `` will op deliver ? '', 
  pretty much everything in my country 's history , until ~ 1960-70 . 
  centuries of pure win . 
  even these few times were things sucked , we managed to stay some angry badass motherfuckers . 
  and yet , the whole world is making fun of us . 
  exaggerated ? 
  maybe . 
  probably . 
  i do n't care .

  i have a question about faceit : is it a good learning plateform for cs : go ? 
  i tried it for the first time yesterday , and people playing here are really good and organized . 
  i feel like it would be better for me to keep playing on faceit to learn more about the game and how it 's meant to be played , but i 'm wondering if it 's really a good idea for someone not that good like me . 
  any suggestion about that ? 
  in an ... `` external '' point of view , yeah , we got rekt hard , and even had to admit publicly that half of the country was n't ours anymore . 
  but in fact , there was still the resistance , who pulled out some major strikes against the nazi occupation and greatly helped our allies . 
  that 's part of the `` angry badass motherfuckers '' thing . 
  you got my country and half of europe ? 
  fuck you i 'm gon na bomb your car anyway .

  if the same exact problem happen with two different rigs , the mouse is most probably your problem . 
  try checking its frequency . 
  can you make a quick video on gfycat or whatever to show what 's happening exactly ? 
  if you think that 's fiction , it 's because he did a very good job at hiding it .

  michael jackson would disagree . 
  no mouse acceleration ? 
  arcades are glorious . 
  we need a female redditor to confirm please . 
  same here , i had to re-read this shit 10 goddamn times , my brain refused to think that was actually what happened . 
  `` my husband died , looking up for random stuff made in human leather '' nope , re-read . 
  my life has a whole new meaning now . 
  i wanted to say `` but we will have a generation of morons until they are 18 '' , before realizing it would n't change a thing anyway . 
  `` pls rez '', 
  i heard that they switched their payment method , they are now providing several baby jews sacrifice each days . 
  the money from gold is actually simply used for hookers and cocaine . 
  op , you should have added `` and do you give them badges if they win ? '',

  i have a particular relation with the `` relaxing '' notion .

  ( sorry for the eventual mistakes , not native english . ), 
  when i was young , i went in a car scrap yard with a friend . 
  we were having fun jumping everywhere and doing stupid shits kids do . 
  we could have injured ourselves pretty bad there . 
  then , we took it to the next step , and began to throw rocks on the cars , especially the windows . 
  we managed to break more than 30 different window , and a lot of other things .
