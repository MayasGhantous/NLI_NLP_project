  so , there are still people who believe that human activity do n't have any influence on our planet . 
  we live in a society of complete fucktards . 
  edit 2 : thanks . 
  the concept of paradise . 
  the second season of my story . 
  reincarnation . 
  ** my ** , with the capital of ** metopia ** , greatest city ever , built in the name of the glorious me . 
  laws would be simple : do retarded shit , get turned into fuel . 
  country wo n't last more than a week . 
  but it 'll be a hell of a week . 
  24 fps is now standard . 
  i make him click on every single gay ads he will encounter on porn sites . 
  i once returned a wallet to an elderly woman who dropped it in front of me . 
  she went like totally mad because `` you could have taken my money , how do i know you did n't took my money ? 
  '' , and shits like that . 
   when someone laughed and said , `` this is so freudian , '', 
  please tell me you burned that person . 
  yup , i agree , elderly men tend to be nice where i live . 
  as long as you are not black . 
  my father was on a bike , tried to pass two guys in front of him . 
  the second guy speed up so my father ca n't do shit . 
  the first guy decide to speed up too , and pass the second guy . 
  yeah , while my father was still just next to him . 
  next thing my father know is that he 's an hospital bed . 
  i think that count as an annoying thing . 
  there 's a sequel ... ? 
  i can already feel the nope in me . 
   the impact of it is grossly exaggerated, 
  well , yeah . 
  i mean , it 's only our planet , nothing important about it , we can fuck it up just a bit . 
   economically unfeasible, 
  the money is a notion created by humanity . 
  not the current state of the earth . 
  saying that it would be insanely expensive and hard to do is absolutely true in the current state of our society , but it 's also ridiculous when you think about it . 
  i do n't even know what it really means , politically speaking , since i 'm not american . 
  in truth , i never talk about ecology , and i do n't really `` care '' . 
  i like how i live and i do n't want to change it , so i 'm far from the point of view you think i have . 
  i just think that people who can actually do something about it ( in a way upper `` level '' in the society than us . 
  i wo n't save the planet by purchasing all those ecologic shits they are trying to sell me . 
  i 'm not the one who can change things . ), 
  should stop deny human influence on the planet and do something about it . 
  stop thinking with extremes , just ... 
  man , that would be cool if things changed . 
  i stared way to long at this thumbnail wondering what the fuck was that . 
  i am and i will always be alpha one . 
  so , i ordered my gtx 970 the september 26th , received it something like the october 1st . 
  does that mean i ca n't have this offer ? 
  i mean , damn , i ordered it pretty early because my 560ti died like 1 week before the 900 serie goes out . 
  feels bad . 
  i called ldlc ( website i used to make my command ) , they have codes since they are in the partnership but it 's limited and so they ca n't give it to me . 
  pretty understandable . 
  do you guys think i can contact nvidia and give them with my invoice to see if i can get the code ? 
  if so , which email am i supposed to contact ? 
  yeah that 's what i did . 
  they told me to contact nvidia . 
  nvidia told me to contact the website . 
  nobody wants to do anything , so i guess i 'll get nothing . 
  feel good to get fucked for purchasing the card 1 week after it comes out . 
  too much love from nvidia . 
  ubisoft or not , the fact that i bought a 970 and ca n't have access to the code because that was before the offer is driving me crazy . 
  well i bought it the first week the card was out . 
  i 'm obviously outside the offer , and i think it 's kind of a dick move from nvidia , fucking everyone who did n't waited a bit more than a month . 
  people should feel rewarded for being loyal to the brand and buy early , not cheated . 
  yes , i 'm mad . 
  i did . 
  called the company , then nvidia , then the company again . 
  nope . 
  ldlc.com , one of the french partner . 
  maybe . 
  but that 's just company policy , the terms of the offer were set by nvidia . 
  i still believe they should have made something for the early buyers . 
  unfortunately . 
  hypnotize , harden , pound , seismic toss . 
  my mom . 
  she knows how to organize shit . 
  that 's why i always use pictures of myself only . 
  unfortunately , people still automatically assume that i 'm the ugly one . 
  some bots can pass captchas . 
  but can they pass six of them ? 
  maximum security . 
  still trying to get to speed with daggerfall . 
  well , op , now we are waiting . 
  what about the conquest points ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  an accurate description of the fire mage . 
  the video was boring , but i could n't stop laughing because of these amazing sound effects . 
  `` meurlon change his tactic and start farting on her nose . '', 
  now i 'm confused . 
  this is actually a real issue here . 
  she cum very easily , then enter dry and sleepy mode . 
  god , i 'm the one you are supposed to blame if that shit last 2 minutes . 
  for those who do n't understand french , he 's basically saying that making a chain with the navdex will not change your chances of getting a shiny , and using the navdex will give you a fixed 1/300 chance ( in theory ) to meet one . 
  nothing is certain for now , but that 's what the initials tests are giving . 
  you can find and interesting chart in the video description . 
  i got it from e-shop . 
  i like the simplicity . 
  `` ho , the new pokemon is here . '', 
  * buy , download , do stuff for one and a half hour , play *, 
  call me a lazy ass , but the simple fact that i do n't have to move from my apartment to enjoy almost instantly a game is enough for me to make the call . 
  sure , you lost that `` collection '' side of getting a physical copy of every pokemon , but for people that do n't care at all about that like me , it 's all good .
