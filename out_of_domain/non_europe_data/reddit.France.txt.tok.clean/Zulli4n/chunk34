  i 've never encountered or traded any shiny . 
  everyone has his own luck =p, 
  i actually like him . 
  was just talking shit until i get a porygon . 
  ( who is n't even rare , could have caught a lot of them on one of my mirage island , but that was fun to wonder trade with a purpose . 
  and i got an epic outcome ), 
  i made a full box of eevees yesterday to wonder trade . 
  i hope people like eevees . 
  you and me , brother , are gon na help this world becoming even more fabulous with more eevees . 
  always more eevees . 
  tons of eevees . 
  i have no idea for your problem , sorry . 
  but ... do n't you think there is enough zubat in this world ? 
  who would want to create even more zubats ? 
  what kind of madman are you ? 
  he 's even worst as a father . 
  mom is pretty awful too . 
  i mean , i 've beaten the pokemon ligue , i 'm the grand master . 
  3 times . 
  i saved the world . 
  2 times . 
  i 'm the trainer who was skilled enough to catch legendary pokemons . 
  they never said anything . 
  not a single care in the world . 
  according to wikipedia , there is 4 diamond and pearl movies . 
  which one is not part of the trilogy ? 
  okay , thanks . 
  thanks !, 
  depend what kind of ** fur ** niture . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ terrible ^ ^ ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry . 
  `` dad do n't talk to me like a kid . 
  you 're just a champion . 
  and not even the last one . 
  i mean , look at your team . 
  you have two slakings , dad . '', 
  that 's very nice of you , thanks !, 
  well , i 'm here tonight , so just let me know if you actually prefer via gts or not . 
  not used to use that , i 'm french . 
  [ gym leader just sound ridiculous in my head . 
  well , we are supposed to be a kid , right ? 
  kids always want to ride in the back of the truck because it sounds cool . 
  they then realize it was clearly a bad idea . 
  they actually gave us a valuable life lesson here . 
  * `` you have terrible ideas , son . 
  i think you can make a lot of people very happy with these . 
  then lead them into a terrible frustration / depression after the pokebank says `` no , fuck you . 
  wondertrade gave me a zigzagoon , or something like that , captured in a master ball . 
  i did n't realized until i wondertraded it back a minute later , and i saw the master ball fly away . 
  for a second , i was like `` did i just sent my groudon into wondertrade ? 
  did he believed the game crashed too at the end when nothing happen for like 20 seconds ? 
  because i did . 
  ho god my sides, 
  yes , that one . 
  french -  english, 
  champion -  gym leader, 
  conseil des 4 ( hu ... the council four , i guess . ), 
  -  elite four, 
  ma\u00eetre pok\u00e9mon ( pokemon master ) -  well ... pokemon master . 
  yes . 
  it 's pretty badass . 
  did n't saved them from a multiple anal rape though . 
  * `` hello , it 's me , i need money again . 
  it was just my way of saying `` meh , non-legit '' . 
  hacked , or cloned , it 's the same , these are not originals . 
  the shiny charm alone will give you 1/1366 chance to get a shiny in the sixth generation . 
  i wo n't back that up with a personal experience or anything because it 's just a fact . 
  that alone makes you really unlucky if you hatched more than two thousands eggs . 
  for the masuda method , on the status page of your pokemon or whatever you call it , you can see the country on the top . 
  this is the only thing that matters for this method : the countries simply need to be different for both pokemon . 
  if you are doing that correctly , combined with the shiny charm , you shoud have something like a 1/400 chance ( maybe more , maybe less , i 'm honestly too lazy to spend 20 seconds of my life doing the maths ) to get a shiny pokemon in an egg . 
  now , if you are doing everything correctly , you ** are ** colossally unlucky . 
  thanks for explaining me the basics of probabilities . 
  yes , it does not means he will have a shiny every 1,300 eggs . 
  it means he could have one at the second egg . 
  that he could have 2 shiny in less that 5 minutes . 
  that he could farm eggs for years and never obtain a single shiny . 
  it works in every possible direction . 
  that 's what random is . 
  and that 's why we are talking about bad luck . 
  why do people who get shiny are like `` hey , what a nice luck !, 
  '' , and when people do n't obtain anything , it 's `` meh , rng , perfectly normal , do n't complain . '' . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  thanks !, 
  sure . 
  ask for a charmander on the gts , put your username and shit so i will recognize you . 
  yes . 
  ask for it in the gts and give me the details . 
  that will happen . 
  just wanted to ask on reddit first . 
  done , # 49 is on his way !, 
  ca n't search him because i do n't have him in my pokedex , sorry x ], 
  what a pompous name for 4 people who got owned by a kid who got his first pokemon the very same morning . 
  people downvote everyone else saying that they do n't like hacked pokemons . 
  apparently , we are supposed to be `` grateful '' for this `` generosity '' and should n't complain . 
  for fuck sake , these are fake . 
  there is no work to obtain them . 
  what 's the point of a shiny if you just say `` a hacked one , perfect . 
  waow i totally worked my ass off to have this one , let 's wondertrade again ! '' . 
  i release all these stupid abomination as soon as i get them . 
  hacked pokemon should be used for a very limited number of things ( mew , to get the pokedex entry , for exemple , since it 's almost impossible to obtain , or some dittos for breeding ) .
