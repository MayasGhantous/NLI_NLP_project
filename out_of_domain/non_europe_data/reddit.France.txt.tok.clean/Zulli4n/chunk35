  and people putting hacked pokemon in the wt are saying `` we are saving the wt from all the useless pokemons ! '' . 
  no , you are killing it with hacks . 
  god . 
  you can hack all you want , i do n't care . 
  but stop putting them on wt . 
  please . 
  you are killing everything . 
  `` there was an equal level of non-work on everyone 's part involved in that trade '', 
  depend of the people . 
  i use wt to give a lot of my 5iv pokemon obtained via breeding , rarely to give zigzagoon or things like that . 
  you say you like having alternate colours , i guess that means you are ok with receiving hacked shiny ? 
  if that so , why do n't you simply use a power save and hack all your pokemon to have a complete shinydex ? 
  does getting them via wt makes you less guilty ? 
  because it 's the same thing . 
  most of the breeders are going for hacked shiny ? 
  well i do n't understand why they are breeding if they do n't accept the fact that it 's very rare . 
  shiny pokemons are made to be rare , wanted , and put a really difficult and long achievement to obtain in the game . 
  sorry , but i still do n't see how having hacked ones is supposed to makes you feel good . 
  like i said , for me , the problem is not that people use hacked pokemon , but that they flood the trade market with them . 
  it 's perfectly fine for you to use hacked shiny if you 're okay with that and simply want a pokemon with a different color . 
  you have a lot of different type of people playing pokemon : the casual ones , who simply want to have a bit a fun , the ones who want a completed pokedex , the ones who are here for competitive gameplay , the ones who breed the equivalent of the earth population each day , the hackers who simply use tools to get shiny , and so on . 
  each type of player should n't bother the others ones , but the hackers do n't simply create pokemon for them or for people who ask for it . 
  they made boxes of them and just give them to everyone . 
  now , what really bother me here is that you have to completely forget about wt and so are forbidden to use a game feature , if you are the kind of people who want to complete the pokedex by yourself and via ( legit ) trades . 
  wondertrade is an amazing tool , but when i receive a legendary , i am not thinking `` woaw , i 'm insanely lucky !, 
  '' , but just `` god , i now have to check if he 's not hacked . 
  aaaand it 's hacked . 
  well , release ... fuck now he 's in my pokedex ... '' . 
  once again , i 'm not against hacking , everyone can enjoy his own way to play the game . 
  i 'm against forcing people ( because yes , that 's what it is ) to get something they hate . 
  because you 've made some people happy does n't makes it right to bother a lot of others people . 
  do n't forget that a hack is cheating . 
  and a game should n't be the slave of a cheaters community . 
  we have a lot of subreddits , websites , and forum where you can trade with people who do n't care about hacked pokemon . 
  just use them . 
   what `` market '' ? 
  pok\u00e9mon are n't supposed to be a commodity, 
  dude , seriously ? 
  it 's a game based on collecting and trading virtual goods . 
  that 's exactly what a market is . 
   so rather than get mad and release the pok\u00e9mon , why not send it on ? 
  you may not want it , but many others probably do n't care . 
  what 's the point of being against something if you do n't act do to something about it ? 
  many others probably do n't care , i agree . 
  and others will be as frustrated as me . 
   if you 're in it for competitive play , the pok\u00e9dex should n't be a huge concern to you . 
  its an extra picture/encounter . 
  it does n't change the stats of the ones you caught/trained legitimately . 
  what if i actually want to do both in a legit way ? 
  should i forget about online ? 
   saying the `` players should ** n't ** bother each other '' is kind of narrow minded . 
  not to mention impossible . 
  unless they made the different versions ( i.e. 
  breeding version , battle version ) you will run into them, 
  it 's not `` narrow minded '' . 
  it 's an utopia . 
  i perfectly know that will never happen . 
  does n't prevent me and others to try and fight against that . 
   `` wonderlocke '' players do n't put in effort ; they literally catch anything and send it off . 
  breeders do n't really put in effort , as they are sending off the ones they find useless . 
  i agree with that . 
  that does n't change the fact that the breeders will usually send good pokemons and make some people happy . 
  hell , i 'm breeding charmanders , the one i used was a 5iv i got on the wt until i hatched a 6iv . 
  well thanks to the trainer who sent me that . 
  and these are legit . 
  most of them are shitty . 
  but legit . 
   at least the hack may have some value to someone , where as you 'll be hard pressed to find many people who are happy to receive their 10th caterpie that likely has a bad nature and 1 decent iv . 
  nobody expect to receive good pokemons all the time from the wt . 
  it 's a lottery , that 's why it 's fun . 
  but again , what value as a pokemon that can be generated 10 , 100 , 1000 times , and will probably do n't make it past your pokebank ? 
  where 's the magic of receiving a shiny , a legendary , or both via wt if there is 99 % chance that it 's hacked ? 
  i really do n't understand you . 
  you 're literally saying that hacked pokemon should be accepted because otherwise you will have boring and useless pokemons . 
  well , that 's exactly the point of the game , having to put actual effort in getting what you want because that 's the true meaning of value . 
  and friendship . 
  i felt like my sentence had to finish by that , sorry . 
  well , flame body should increase the number for the first egg that hatched too , right ? 
  since they both received the passive , they should still both be at one cycle apart , as i understand it . 
  and if not , how come on 100 eggs , this only happened one time ? 
  i never complained . 
  i 'm just curious about something that seemed weird for me . 
  damn , i 'm terrible at that kind of stuff , but that would be cool that someone actually calculate when is the more optimal moment to get the eggs and get these multiple eggs hatching . 
  so many time gained !, 
  well at least i know this is not a bug but more a matter of optimization . 
  thanks !, 
  now i have to figure out how it works and when to get my eggs to get these multiple hacthing . 
  talking about that , i really like the fact that the kid look at us when there is a new egg . 
  not having to talk to him everytime to check is awesome . 
  yeah i 've understood that . 
  let me explain what bugs me . 
  let 's say i have eggs who need 19 cycles to hatch . 
  - i talk to the kid . 
  the kid give me my egg a. 
  - i have now to complete one cycle to get egg b. 
  - i complete one cycle , i have now egg b. 
  egg a needs now ** 17 cycles ** to hatch with the flame body passive , while egg b needs ** 19 cycles ** . 
  i complete another cycle , egg a now needs ** 15 ** , while eggs b needs ** 17 ** . 
  so i guess i have something wrong here , because that way , it 's impossible for two eggs to hatch together , they will always be separated by ** 2 cycles **, 
  so , i 'd like someone to explain me what am i thinking wrong here =d,
