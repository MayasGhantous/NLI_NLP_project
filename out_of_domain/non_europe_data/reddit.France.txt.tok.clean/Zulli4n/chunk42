  it does make sense : it 's a video game . 
  it 's not like they just throw that whole regeneration thing on our face without explanation , we kinda had several other episodes slowly introducing us to this . 
  just think about the regeneradores in re4 , if they can exist in this universe , it actually make sense that years later there is a more `` usable '' application for these new biological discoveries . 
  as for ethan reaction , it 's either he curls into a ball and cry , or goes with it simply based on survival instinct ( talking about the scene where jack gives you the juice to attach your leg back ) . 
  it work , and he says something like `` impossible ... '' . 
  then you turn back , and realize the madman with a shovel wants to go for round 2 and you have to run . 
  it 's not like ethan have a choice or time to process . 
  nor the player , and i 'm pretty sure that 's fully intended . 
  used code 4 ( 8713-144f-5afc-4c86-b691 ),

  also , thanks a lot for the amazing giveaways , as always !,

  fuck the police, 
  [ somewhat close to the chart he 's holding ] ( http://lasvegaspetweightloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cat-weight-chart.png ), 
  970 too , and i5 2500k which is not particularly recent . 
  still get around 65 fps on 1080p and everything on high settings . 
  i also have a 144hz monitor , and i knew damn well when buying an early access game that i would n't be able to use it to its full extend . 
  still happy about my game , it looks super nice , and runs smoothly . 
  `` dude , up for some r6 ? '', 
  died , and got almost instantly that achievement . 
  the name made me laugh =d, 
  ** edit : ** just removed the part about mf buff . 
  after reading your comments , i understand that would probably be a bad idea ( until blizzard change how mf works ) . 
  this shrine needs to be reworked . 
  ** in my opinion , the best idea so far was proposed by rakantae , `` get rid of fortune shrines . 
  give us back gem shrines ! '' . 
  hey everyone !, 
  will doing my bounties , i found a fortune shrine , and something hit me ( aouch . ) . 
  let 's make a quick recap of the shrines you can find :, 
  * frenzied : your attack speed increases by 25 % . 
  yeah , i want to hit monsters faster !, 
  * blessed : you reduce all incoming damage by 25 % . 
  yeah , i want to take less damages !, 
  * empowered : you have 100 % increased resource gain , and 50 % reduced cooldown time . 
  yeah , i want to faceroll my keyboard !, 
  * fleeting : you gain 25 % increased movement speed and increase your pickup radius by 20 yards . 
  yeah , i want to run faster and pick-up shits !, 
  * enlightened : you gain 25 % increased experience from monster kills . 
  yeah , i want to gain more xp !, 
  and ... 
  * fortune : you gain 25 % increased magic and gold find rate . 
  yeah , i. . . wait , what ? 
  are n't shrines supposed to be cool when you find them , like `` ho man , here 's a shrine , everything will be better for the next 2 minutes ! '', 
  ( 10 , if you have the `` gloves of fuck that buff duration '' . ) ? 
  i really feel like this shrine is absolutely useless right now . 
  25 % ( 2.5 % for legendaries ) for 2 minutes is nothing . 
  and i 'm not even talking about the ridiculous +25 % gold . 
  i just do n't feel the effect of that shrine in game right now , and i 'm disapointed everytime i find one because i know i could have another one , with real buffs . 
  so , am i the only one who think this `` fortune shrine '' must be changed ? 
  ( sorry for the eventuals mistakes , i 'm not a native english speaker . ), 
  it 's just , they are not a real item , are they ? 
  just something we stack to open rifts . 
  it 's the exact same thing than blood shards . 
  i do n't think it 's something fundamental for the game , but i 'm just wondering why do i have to keep these things in my stash and not the blood shards ? 
  everything is in the title . 
  thanks in advance guys !, 
  ok , so i just bought the game , but i have a major issue that prevent me to play the game . 
  everytime i launch e :d , i 'm yelling hysterically `` spaaaace , spaaaaaaaace , i 'm in spaaaaace , wooooooooooh '' while spinning and boosting around without any purpose . 
  this is game-breaking , since the game is too awesome to be enjoyed properly . 
  please fix this by removing space . 
  thanks . 
  for those who , like me , are at work and ca n't go on the frontier forum , here is the changelog for the today 's patch .

  hello , brothers , sisters . 
  i 'm actually seeking for some informations : as said in the title , my gpu is actually overheating . 
  like , a lot . 
  when unused , the temperature is about 50 \u00b0 c ( 122 \u00b0 f ) . 
  it 's a bit more that is supposed to be , but i can live with that . 
  but when i launch a game ( recently tested with : diablo iii , elite : dangerous , star citizen , assetto corsa , archeage ) , my computer turn into a fucking volcano : the tower is burning ( i seriously can cook an egg on it ) , and the gpu goes from 50 to 100 fucking degrees celcius ( 212 \u00b0 f ) in 30 goddamn seconds . 
  then the computer shutdown , in a painful agony that almost leaves me in tears everytime . 
  now , i do n't know what kind of black sorcery it is , because i cleaned pretty much everything and changed my gpu thermal paste . 
  the tower is n't in a closed space . 
  so , my question is : what else could cause this ? 
  can i consider my gpu as dead ? 
  i mean , the thermal paste should have at least made things a bit better ... 
  for the record , the computer have almost 3 years . 
  the gpu is a 560ti . 
  it 's not the best , but until now , this faithful companion never let me down . 
  he does n't deserve to finish like that . 
  thanks in advance , brothers , sisters . 
  ** edit : ** how can i add a flair in my post ? 
  ca n't find the goddamn thing !, 
  hello everyone !, 
  let me explain quickly my situation : my computer is 3 years old , and the components are even older .
