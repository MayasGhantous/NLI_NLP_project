  what do you think ? '', 
  simple , straight , i do n't know if it 's the perfect way to say it , but i can assure you the answer will be perfectly honest and you will instantly know if it 's cool with that girl or not . 
  ** edit ** : seeing all of you guys answer , i do n't thing any of you realize we 're in 2014 , and being straightforward on social media is somewhat in the social norm now for that kind of things . 
  when i was growing up , my parents were always saying that the youth was dumb as fuck and people were way smarter back in the day . 
  now , i 'm feeling the same way . 
  i ca n't tell if it 's the youth who is really degenerating , or if as an older man , i 'm just pissed off by the stupidity we all had one day . 
  your mom , because it took the hard working of all men on earth to shape her in her actual state . 
  delete it and stop going into your spam folder . 
  i got more than 2000 points on a post , just because my cat is stupid enough to jump and bang into a closed window . 
  that goddamn bastard, 
  i do n't have any kid , so i ca n't answer you op , sorry , but i just wanted to say that i can relate with your nephew . 
  i too was amazed by the fact that the sun and the moon can be in the sky at the same time . 
  god , the world seemed so wonderful at that time ... 
  * while people are discussing the possible date for the beta 2 , you can see an indistinguishable form , probably someone , floating far away and seeming to say something .

  do n't worry . 
  i have the feeling that beta 2 will be the [ fappening ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/the-fappening-celebgate ) of our community .

  our universe is actually infinite , expanding constantly on himself . 
  when you are able to really think about it , and the concept of infinity existing , the feeling is overwelming . 
  i personally have to watch an episode of sponge bob after that to keep my head right . 
  ever heard of christmas ? 
  it 's pronounced hakuna matata you dumbass . 
  i am the danger . 
  i know better than you i 've seen jurassic park at least 3 times . 
  you mean , edward dick-hands ? 
  you ca n't take a joke , do you ? 
  that 's the kind of questions that wake me up at night . 
  and you will give birth to the smartest sock there ever was . 
  it would be a pleasure !, 
  a brain . 
  i mean , a real one , not the fake shitty one my parents got at wallmart and put into me like `` it 's ok , he 'll never notice . '',

  i want to see that little alien sing when he comes out of the guy 's belly . 
  dude , are you really questioning woman logic ? 
  `` mister president , we need you to ... '', 
  `` shut the fuck up , ca n't you see i 'm playing ? '', 
  i 'd give it a try . 
  who know , nobody can understand whatever the fuck you are saying . 
  `` where is my money ? '', 
  it 'll be our little secret . 
  yeah , so we do n't like you . 
  stop trying to do everything like us !, 
  everything england has , the france does n't , and vice versa . 
  we complete each others in the most beautiful , hateful way we can . 
  our constant rivality will always be the proof that we are nothing without each other .

  what am i supposed to explain here ? 
  more content on e :d = more fap fap for us , that 's all . 
  parisian french , to be specific . 
  it 's like regular french , but with that little acid and condescending tone who say `` how dare you talking to me , peasant ? '', 
  i love it . 
  it 's funny ( for me , anyway ) , and i have sometime hard times trying to not laugh and understand what they are saying , but in fact i just find it warm and welcoming . 
  ** snatch . 
  people , tv , internet talking about it , and i was like `` meh '' . 
  then i tried to watch it . 
  i now ca n't count how many time i 've seen this movie , and i still found it absolutely awesome . 
  ( bonus , it 's also one of my favorite movie to watch baked ), 
  none that i know of . 
  quebec culture is almost inexisting in france ( for the regular joe , i mean ) . 
  myself , i know absolutely nothing about quebec , including the pop culture . 
  ( except [ farador ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoxdrmoh6he ) , that shit is awesome ( i 'm actually at work and ca n't check if my link is ok , so ... let 's hope it is . 
  ( ho my god , triple bracket !! 1 !! 11 ! ) ) ), 
  i 'm fascinated by the idea of the whole society / humanity falling appart . 
  but do n't get me wrong . 
  i do n't want people to die , i do n't want the zombie apocalypse happen and there is billions of ( not-so ) deads . 
  i 'd just like ... to be in that kind of scenario . 
  live it , without all that `` massive humanity genocide '' part , explore an empty , devastated world once built by humans . 
  having some fun blowing zombies brains out , living on the road , and see that deadly but yet peaceful world that surrounds me . 
  probably . 
  i 'll make it up to you by offering you a beer the day i will come to quebec to see how awesome is it . 
  i need to know if it 's worth it to come and live there .
