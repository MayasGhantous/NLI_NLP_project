  final score :, 
  yeah i think they smile at each other and hug . 
  and the fact that gorgodze is supposed to be in toulon next year just make the whole thing more fun . 
  well the guy is asking money from american for a `` french problem '' , i guess it shows what other french people think of this . 
   women who live with violent intimate partners should not introduce a gun into the home , but could leave one with a trusted neighbor or in a safe-deposit box at their bank in case they need it in an emergency . 
  i do n't like that at all . 
  women who live with violent intimate partners should go to their neighbor and ask for help from the police or social services , not leave a gun and go back to their home and just wait for shit to hit the fan . 
  and in case of emergency , go to the police station . 
   because owning a gun is non-violent endeavour in itself , therefore you should have a right to own one . 
  the very fact that i own a gun does n't agress against anybody . 
  you have the right to own a gun , but you are limited in what type of gun you can buy , and where you have the right to have your gun . 
  it 's how the law is , you are limited because the legislator thinks it 's what is the best for the society , maybe it 's not perfect , maybe we could change it . 
  because you can use this argument with everything . 
  owning a nuclear bomb does n't mean i want to use it , but you do n't have the right to own a nuclear bomb . 
   - because most thugs are younger , faster , more violent that most people . 
  guns enable the physically weak to have a chance to defend themselves . 
  guns are the great equalizer . 
  are you sure a physically weak can safely use a gun when under attack/stress ? 
  assess the situation and act in the best way ? 
  does this mean you need to have a permit system , with mandatory practice ? 
  a medical/psychological evaluation ? 
  how do you decide who is fit to carry a gun ? 
  what about other the other self defense weapons that you can legally buy ? 
  is a pepper spray not better for a weak person ? 
   gun are not only useful to defend yourself against an armed attacker . 
  - because all genocides in the 20th century were made on peoples that were disarmed etc etc etc. 
  yes you are right but i think we do n't have to worry about genocides in france right now . 
  because if we have to fear for genocide , we should also fear a nuclear holocaust or something nasty and star building bunkers and stock food . 
  except in his example , it is not a emergency . 
  the woman know she is potentially in danger , she buy a gun , and ask a neighbor to hide the gun in his house . 
  that means ( well at least in my mind ) that she tells the reason why she need to hide a gun in his place . 
  and if she can go to bank , retrieve the gun , go back to her place , and wait for violent husband to strike , that mean she has the time to go the police . 
  i 'm not a lawyer but i think ( i think , i 'm not sure ) that in a situation like that she will be jail for murder , because she was n't in direct danger and prepare for a `` crime '' . 
  ok for the brandish a gun and that 's enough , but in this case , she does not need a gun in the first place . 
   oh god , the nuclear bomb argument . 
  i was expecting it , i 'm surprised it did n't appear earlier . 
  there will be a part about that in my book , please read it . 
  short answer : nuclear bombs do n't have any legitimate self-defense purpose . 
  then you need to define a category of weapon that can be used for `` self defense '' or can be carry around !, 
  shotgun ? 
  revolver ? 
  fully automatic ? 
  sniper rifle ? 
  can you buy a silencer ? 
  a scope ? 
  how many bullets can the clip have ? 
  i used the nuclear bomb argument because you can of used [ it yourself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1tgamk/as_an_american_im_curious_as_to_what_other_french/ce88h3m ) , but it was just to say that you need to define what can be used as self defense , and if you add a profile check and other question it makes the '' ** who ** have the right to have ** what ** '' question a big big thing . 
   `` sure '' ? 
  are you sure that they ca n't ? 
  you ca n't make such a big statement in advance, 
  i 'm not sure either , that 's why i was asking , not making a statement . 
   right now , luckily , no . 
  but you do n't know anything about the future . 
  exactly we know nothing about the future . 
  what if we have a law * port d'armes pour tous * , what can you do if people decide to create armed militia and attack other people ? 
  should we all fight each other with our guns ? 
  should we let the police handle the situation ? 
  then why not let the police handle the situation right now ?
