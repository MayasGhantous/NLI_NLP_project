   when isis militants hold up a single index finger on their right hands , they are alluding to the tawhid , the belief in the oneness of god and a key component of the muslim religion . 
  the tawhid comprises the first half of the shahada , which is an affirmation of faith , one of the five pillars of islam , and a component of daily prayers : `` there is no god but allah , muhammad is the messenger of allah . '',

  the radical new measures to be discussed by the ffr and lnr on april 26 include :, 
  from 2018-19 the top 14 reduced to top 12 & only 1 club relegated from top flight, 
  top six play-offs replaced by semi-finals & final, 
  the creation of a ` protected ' national elite squad of 30 players & one of 20 development players which will play fewer club matches, 
  top 14 match-day squads increased from 23 to 25 provided these additions comprise young french players , allowing 10 subs per match, 
  all clubs to install synthetic pitches, 
  to compensate for absence of players on france duty , the $ 10m salary cap will increase from $ 100k to 200k to recruit extra ` elite ' player, 
  the span of the six nations reduced from seven weeks to five weeks,

  lol why ? 
  lol how ? 
  found a stream :, 
  ex ceo if i 'm not mistaken . 
   ok was gon na keep silent - i am not watching anymore of this over hyped lousy professional rugby . 
  if one is gon na make big deal about being professional , one suffers the truth . 
  this is terrible pro rugby - no more no less than a normal d1 match quality . 
  last years nyac squad , assuming they havent lost some to pro rugby - would have neaten readily either san fran or sacramento . 
  and that 's just the post where he is talking about pro rugby , his last post about `` return on investors assets '' is gold . 
   i am not good enough to do this but this is the only avenue where one day you will see elite professional rugby worthy of - not the american nation or the all blacks or your local club - but worthy of your hard earned dollars you pay to watch the grand entertainment . 
  now thats the true american way .
