  check pole-emploi . fr later , the will have most of `` vendangeurs '' / `` vendange '' jobs before it starts .

  yep , f\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 is the third division . 
  tarbes was also subject to the same treatment earlier this month . 
  edit : biarritz and co ' have 10 days to appeal the decision . 
  f\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 is 4 pools of 10 teams each , so they can take the teams that made the playoffs ( f\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 is also a big financial mess , lille went bust during the season ) . 
  we will have to wait 10 days for the clubs to appeal the decision . 
  must i remind you that the top 14 \u00ae is the * best championship in the woourrlld * \u2122 ? 
  the fact that bollor\u00e9 + \u00ae is willing to spend 97 million $ and that most of the top 14 clubs are not making money is the proof that french rugby \u00ae is doing well and not a inflating bubble ready to burst . 
  well , toulon is one of the two clubs making money , but you know that boudjellal is litteraly hitler and does n't know anything about rugby , look at him !, 
  not spending millions to save his club !, 
  not very valeurs \u00ae,

  / u/skeeter1980 can you add more infos in the op ? 
  thx . 
  edit : danke !, 
   giving it a good thought , i 'm not that neutral . 
  join the dark side . 
   what 's with the pyramid shit going on in the middle of the pitch ? 
  it 's a catalan tradition, 
  a try was scored , by top 14 standard is a good game . 
   the top14 title stays in paris . 
  rip xvalarax , killed by a mob of parisians . 
  so now we are going to have lorenzetti instead of boudjellal talking shit . 
  fuck this .

  a victory celebration without burning the trophy is considered a dull affair . 
  hum ... looks like i missed something ... 
   so the question is , how do you cope with your team losing consistently ? 
  '' * well that was a awful way to lose , it 's impossible to top that , surely we are going to win next season * '', 
  i think it 's the * impatriate * scheme :,
