  well , the drama is going to be interesting . 
  comme le dit le proverbe : [ ecoutez , laisser la police faire son travail ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8je1uhqeyv4 ), 
  * colombia, 
  * japan, 
  * brazil, 
  * spain, 
  * france, 
  * great britain ( bronze ), 
  * new zealand ( silver ), 
  * ** australia ** ( gold ), 
  so much slowmo ' , must be a french cameraman . 
  jesus , fabien galthi\u00e9 is a bloody idiot , do n't know anything about 7 . 
  brazil in world series then ? 
  hope that spain gets the 7th place , for a team that won the repechage it 's not a bad result . 
  well you can buy the * dieu du stade * calendar if you want naked rugby players :d, 
  check on rojadirecta.me, 
  ~ ~ she is going to ref in super rugby if i 'm not mistaken ~ ~, 
  garcia, 
  you are right , wrong person . 
  amy perrett ( australia ), 
  grassinator , ffs . 
  mods !!, 
  mods !!!, 
  it 's called * mode * , you dirty briton !, 
  well a certain team in blue just scored . 
  usa and canada ruining my prediction , damn the north americans !, 
  hey do n't take it away from france !, 
  it 's the only thing we have !, 
  and your kit is shit !, 
  congratulation / u/zverkalt , prediction on point :, 
  i 'm not good at prediction and reading prediction ... 
   why that woman could n't bat the ball away in order for her team to get it ,, 
  you can try to catch it , but you ca n't push it away : it 's a deliberate way to stop an attacking opportunity . 
  france, 
  nice . 
  vamos leones !, 
  and japan does it again !, 
  france television is horrible , but that 's not really a surprise . 
  i was hoping for a drop from imhoff to win the game . 
  vamooos !, 
   rules for classification : 1 ) points ; 2 ) head-to-head result ; 3 ) point difference ; 4 ) points scored . 
   i 've got a feeling kenya will hit their stride against japan, 
  me too !, 
  ** ken ** v jpn, 
  ** fij ** v usa, 
   i hope spain get a win but not in the first game of the day . 
  ftfy . 
  and he is going to toulon , 
  god damnit japan is playing so well , i 'm scared . 
  and france television is not streaming it ... 
  yeah i know about their website , but it 's not a continuous stream , they stop streaming and start a new one for each match ( except when it 's live on tv , it 's on the f4 stream with galthi\u00e9 ), 
  awesome work mate !, 
  you misspelled france . 
  why ar u so mean \u00a7 \u00a7 !, 
  psa would have won it . 
  top 14 best championship in the world , collapsed scrums master race . 
  take you own decisions ffs, 
  of course it hits the post,

  also called luck . 
  not a bad result when you look at our ranking in the world series . 
  ca n't wait to see him in toulon with tuisova :d, 
  i do n't think the wikipedia page is up to date , this one is pretty good : http://www.allrugby.com/dossiers/mutations-top14.html, 
  [ december 2015 ] ( http://www.rugbyrama.fr/rugby/top-14/2015-2016/transfert-top-14-les-crusaders-officialisent-le-depart-de-nemani-nadolo-a-montpellier_sto5010383/story.shtml ), 
  i think it 's finally the year for clermont ( lol ) . 
  not really confident with the fly half / scrum half situation with brock james gone . 
  hope the young guys can manage . 
  [ we ... we do n't talk about that .

  under armor design is so fucking ugly , always the same . 
  have to say the racing 's design are way nicer when you remove the sponsors : https://imgur.com/a/fuf6h, 
  and http://www.allrugby.com/clubs/montpellier/effectif ( check only espoir ), 
  said that pro rugby wants control over the clubs in the league to sell them later on . 
  could be interesting if the old clubs create a new league , with toulon behind miami and racing 92 with austin i 'm sure they could find other clubs and partnerships . 
  yeah but is the pro-rugby guy selling a team or a slot in the league ? 
  and a pro rugby team can only have 5 foreigners , not enough if boudjellal wants to send his players .

   ( do n't watch it 's terrible ), 
  damn missed it :(, 
  resting the a team for the match against toulon at home . 
  ( your typical away game in top 14 ), 
  sure , but racing really threw away the game :d, 
  if you want to see clermont loose wait for the playoffs . 
  . . and that was the last time he called you . 
  from the pro d2 [ bourgoin vs vannes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2raa6zchkai ), 
  yep . 
  sky sport shows 2 games per week , maybe they have highlights somewhere . 
  the official top 14 channel on dailymotion used to have a summary of each round in english : http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2ps433_top14-2014-2015-highlights-round-24_sport, 
  but not anymore !, 
  sending the b team on away game to save dan carter for the home game . 
  that 's correct . 
  good stream for clermont - bordeaux ( in french ) :, 
  check www.rojadirecta.me, 
  the players from the 7s core team are not playing for clubs , they are under contract and paid by the ffr . 
  urgh plisson and huget ... and no dulin , parra or nakaitaci ... 
  the nrfl guy was funnier .
