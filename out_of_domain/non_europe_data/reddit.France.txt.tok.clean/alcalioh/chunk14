  on touche pas au piaf bordel . 
  hamon qui tente la p ` tite incruste, 
  streaker on the pitch ? 
  what a game !, 
  montpellier vs racing 92 was also canceled , so you have 4 teams with an ` extra ' game . 
   tl ; dr exciting end of season . 
  ffr vs lnr will impact the standings drastically . 
  business as usual in france sadly, 
  according to midi olympique and rugbyrama , paul goze ( the lnr 's president ) may be sacked , he is meeting with bernard laporte ( ffr ) today to discuss the cancelled game and with the lnr board tomorrow . 
  wait and see . 
  nice try from northampton,

  ffs wait !, 
  too many silly mistake from la rochelle and james having a shocker, 
   i would n't be too disappointed if they were to win this game seeing as they are the eternal bridesmaids of european rugby .

  why are you doing this to me ? \u00a7 \u00a7 !, 
  perfect . 
  mais wtf l\u00e0\u00e0 !, 
  going well for clermont in the first half, 
  with montpellier it 's not a done deal ...

  * euro macron, 
  france world champions 2019 confirmed , no need to play just give us the trophy, 
  what a complete shitshow that would be . 
  i 'm scared . 
  clermont are going for la remontada , classic . 
  mais ouais la nick ta maman abebdanon !, 
  * from clermont, 
  penalty !, 
  red card !, 
  give 40 points to clermont and stop the game !, 
  oooohhh, 
  nigel is right . 
  no bias . 
  stop complaining . 
  well at least we still have a top 14 to lose . 
  and with vern cotter as the new head coach , scarry team ... 
  welsh is soo weird ... 
  must be so scary to have tuisova , bastareaud and nonu in front of you . . 
  half-time : toulon 13 - 9 castres, 
  i 'm not sure that was deliberate from mitchell ... 
  ft : toulon 26 - 22 castres . 
  castres gave everything in the last 10 minutes , but could n't score . 
  first semi-final will be la rochelle vs toulon . 
  wan na fight ? 
  i hope it can stay that way ... 
  rahh ffs :(, 
  yep , tackle right in the face ( cravate ), 
  well its not the same tempo as yesterday, 
  americanpatriot , irish flair , french time . 
  hum ... 
  lol nagusa, 
  and japan in lille, 
  mais ouaaaaiis !!!, 
  a french game without a brawl is considered a dull affair . 
  pls clermont do n't choke pls pls, 
  one the un should ban . 
  this way . 
  pato in , valarax is happy, 
  omg stay calm ffs, 
  the second half had me so nervous ffs, 
  a bit early no ? 
  rahh . 
  can they stop with the 3d powerpoint ? 
  injured, 
  sofiane guitoune, 
  you are not the only one . 
  ca n't say i am surprised though, 
  first try for france after 12 seconds, 
  good half . 
  the irish are playing like psa-france . 
  do n't worry , the real jerseys will have more of them . 
  i believe in your conspiracy . 
  only because the british are the bad guys . 
  horrible . 
  ffs our lineouts are shiiitt, 
  lack of a good kicker for france ... costs them the game, 
  looks like scott lavalla, 
  i am !, 
  knock-ons everywhere,
