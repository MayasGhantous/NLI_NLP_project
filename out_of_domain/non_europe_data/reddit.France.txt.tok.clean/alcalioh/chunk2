  you said in one of your message that crime has many variables in place , and i think everybody agree with that but they also think ( and i do too ) that adding armed civilian to the mix is just adding an another variable and not solving the problem . 
  i mean do you think it will make the violence stop ? 
  do n't you think we can change other things before ? 
  ( like i said before : police/education/immigration and so on ), 
  but do you really think that if we allow guns in the street bad guys will just say '' * oh he has a gun , well i think my career in crime is over * '' or will he think '' * damn this guy has a pistol , i better have something bigger to protect my back * ? 
   i used to prove a point , to explain the principle : `` by raising dramatically the cost of a potential agression , you make that agression much less likely to happen '', 
   it will make criminals much more reluctant to assault , since the cost of that agression is way too high . 
  did we see a rise in murder when the death penalty was abolished ? 
  how is it different ? 
   that 's a complete fantasy , it 's just not grounded in reality at all . 
  look at the us and tell me if you see such militias . 
  i do n't think we should base public policy of fantasies of crazy martians invading earth . 
  because a risk of genocide in france or an abuse of power is more grounded in reality ? 
  seriously when i read your messages it seems to me like we have millions of people killed or raped in france every day . 
  anyway good luck for your book , i hope you will use what some people have linked in this thread .

  portuguese is just too funny to listen to , shame i do n't understand what is being said . 
   let 's hope we can top 2013 . 
  well for france it ca n't be worst than 2 wins , 1 draw and 8 losses . 
  or maybe it can be , we will see . 
  gl & hf for 2014 !, 
  tizer = [ tiser ] ( http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/tiser ) = to booze . 
  there is nothing sexual , it just say that people do n't know their limit , want to drink and at the end they are black out drunk . 
  nah i know people who use tiser just to say to drink heavily ( but not binge drinking ) , nothing related to sexual harassment for me . 
  there is a limit :, 
  each club must have 40 % of what is called `` jiff '' * joueurs issus de la formation fran\u00e7aise * : players from the french academy . 
  but you do n't need to be french , if you spend 3 years in a club academy , you are a jiff . 
  armitage brothers are jiff for example ( and many others , toulon is not the only one ) . 
  for 2014-2015 clubs will need to have 55 % of jiff on the squad , 12 jiffs per squad for 2015-2016 and ** a minimum ** of 12 for 2017 . 
  ( and of course the money from the tv contract is here , not enough jiff , no money ), 
  and something else but this time between the league and the federation : in may saint-andr\u00e9 will announce an elite group of 30 players . 
  these players wo n't have the right to play more than 30 matches for their clubs , the idea is to preserve them for the french squad . 
  they can play less than 20 minutes during a match , more than that and it is counted as a full match . 
  they can play the knockout games for top 14 and european cups , it will not be counted . 
  so for next year the club will have to have more french players , but they wo n't be able to use them as the wish if they are on the elite group ( of course the clubs will receive some sweet money for their players ) . 
  so yeah , welcome to fr $ nch rugby and sorry if i made some mistakes * anglish very pas easy * . 
  or best timing for an intercept try :d,
