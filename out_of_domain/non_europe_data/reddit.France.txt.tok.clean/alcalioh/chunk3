  it 's like [ thug notes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2veqrpm_hya ) , but in french and with a lot of slang and verlan . 
  for example l'etranger , albert camus :, 
  ** animal farm ** - george orwel, 
  ** the man in the high castle ** - philip k. dick, 
  ** la carte et le territoire ** ( the map and the territory ) - michel houellebecq, 
  ** the minority report ** - philip k. dick, 
  ** 1984 ** - george orwel, 
  orwel was perfect , captivating and easy to read , minority report was short but good , the end of the man in the high castle was frustrating , and la carte was not interesting at all . 
  the winning one would be nice . 
  it 's because we ca n't stop laughing when looking at your sweaters . 
  ** maybe we do n't have a lot of medals , but we have [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_de_coubertin ) , so you 're welcome .
