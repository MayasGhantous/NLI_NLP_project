  good thing for you , you do n't need to work on * the booing the player * part , it 's your trademark :p, 
  good job today , ca n't wait for the v\u00e9lodrome , very sexy stadium now . 
  ga\u00ebtan germain , amazing try . 
  final score : brive 26 - 24 asm clermont, 
  it 's mostly flash stream , sorry . 
   i kind of enjoy misery, 
   i do n't like france, 
  change your mind and allez les bleus , we are what you are looking for . 
  :'( clermont ffs, 
   the incident occurred when armed ex-seleka members surrounded boguila 's hospital grounds where a meeting was being held with forty community leaders invited by msf to discuss medical access and care . 
   while some of the gunmen robbed the msf office at gunpoint and fired shots into the air , other armed men approached the meeting place where msf staff and community members had gathered together on benches . 
  unprovoked , the armed men started firing heavily into the crowd , leaving both dead and critically wounded . 
  dusautoir is back , pap\u00e9 out , and trinh-duc is crying in a corner . 
  8 players from stade toulousain , 6 for asm clermont , 4 stade fran\u00e7ais , 3 rc toulon and castres , 2 from perpignan , racing metro and montpellier and one guy from bordeaux b\u00e8gles . 
  i 'm `` working '' on it , 
  it 's ugly i know , do n't juge me . 
  i used the stadium from [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_14#current_teams ) for the initial location ( chaban-delmas for bordeaux ), 
  for people who do n't know about the pro d2 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rugby_pro_d2#current_teams, 
   ~ ~ biarritz ~ ~ ** toulon ** based in their infamous fortress on a ferry in the mediterranean there . 
  i did n't put a arrow or something to signal where the city is , kind of silly of me , anyway it 's something like this :, 
  ** top14 ** :, 
  union bordeaux b\u00e8gles ( stade chaban-delmas ) ,44.829525 , -0.598282, 
  asm clermont auvergne ( parc des sports marcel michelin ) ,45.789342 , 3.106087,

  biarritz olympique ( parc des sports aguil\u00e9ra ) ,43.483775 , -1.537086, 
  for your csv, 
  with the current top14 , saint-pierre-et-miquelon belong to biarritz , the perfect situation considering their [ coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/coat_of_arms_of_saint-pierre_and_miquelon.svg/405px-coat_of_arms_of_saint-pierre_and_miquelon.svg.png ) . 
  stream :, 
  did n't try all of them , but this one was good :, 
  '' * tis but a scratch * ! '', 
  well , it 's the top14 . 
  if you want to rewatch the knee to the fritz :, 
  bleh , terrible . 
  yep, 
  good first half , but please score more points clermont :p, 
  top14 playoffs :, 
  toulouse vs racing metro [ full match in english ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lvmohnmsgi ) , [ highlights in french ] ( http://youtu.be/d9affva9yvk ) . 
  asm clermont vs castres [ full match in english ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4keqe91gqk8 ), 
  no , but i found the match on youtube , so if people want to watch something because they are bored , it 's the perfect one . 
  too be honest asm castres was not a good match either :p,

  what about a [ submarine ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bnmywhaigaaxyyv.jpg ) ? 
  not enough empty seats , next year they should to to stockholm . 
  oh man the breton flag is everywhere , it does n't prove anything :d, 
  [ they are everywhere them damn ' breton ] ( http://www.legorafi.fr/2013/05/13/toujours-aucune-explication-scientifique-a-la-presence-dun-drapeau-breton-dans-les-festivals/ ) . 
  49 257 apparently for ~ 50 000 seats . 
  not so bad . 
  oh yes please . 
  quick , somebody trow a corsican between this two !, 
  they should move away the microphones from the sideline . 
   it is down to the money . 
  and it always was the case , do you think toulouse is poor ? 
  or clermont ? 
  or castres ? 
  boudjellal is always in the front line to take the hits ( and he likes it ) , but at least he is clear about his money , his club , and what he wants . 
  do you want rubgy to be popular ? 
  you need money , what you can do is ask for more transparency , more control , to know who is paying for what . 
   funding period, 
   jun 2 2014 - jul 2 2014 ( 30 days ), 
  we need that voronoi map with all the clubs . 
  toulon : talent everywhere , they play well and win stuff . 
  and you will make people mad '' * bouhouhou they have money * '', 
  clermont : ~ ~ this year we are going to win ! ~ ~, 
  paris if you like pink . 
  bordeau-b\u00e8gles or montpellier if you want something else . 
  this one is * golden * :, 
  golden the quiiin . 
  it was on the stadium speakers , boudjellal asked for it ( i think the stadium asked the team what they want if they win , but i 'm not sure . ), 
  the funny thing is that some people complained about it but if i remember correctly the marseillaise was not even played at the beginning of the game . 
  fais attention \u00e0 tes pains au chocolat du coup :d, 
  [ la faute \u00e0 facebook .

   surely not rugby related , fans of a rival club for example . 
  those damn hooligans from racing metro !, 
  the football game was in millau , pre season friendly . 
  your link says that the players exchange words with some guys who were apparently bothering a girl and the guys left the club ( or got kicked out ) to get backup and `` weapons '' . 
  nothing about something british , but you never know with them :p, 
  well the top14 ( french championship ) start the 15th of august .
