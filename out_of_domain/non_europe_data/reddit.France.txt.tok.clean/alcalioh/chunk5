  lyon , grenoble and oyonnax are the ` closest ' teams to germany , but they are playing away on the first & second week .

  lyon and paris are playing a friendly in [ geneva on the 8th of august ] (,

  and you have the [ legion rugby challenge ] ( http://www.legionrugbychallenge.com/en/categorie/rugby-challenge-en ) in grenoble ( 9 august ) : montpellier ( fr ) vs. london irish ( en ) and harlequins ( en ) vs. f.c grenoble ( fr ),

   no option for amy perrett but to send pulumu off . 
  the samoan fullback is adjugded to have taken england 's natatsha hunt beyond the horizontal and not brought her safely back to the ground . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://twitter.com/saintmtex ) ), 
  i made the map myself so it must be inaccurate , anyway who cares where brive and oyonnax are , right ? 
  if you are smart , you can see that some shirts do n't have sponsors all over them ( sad i know ) and that some away/third shirts are missing . 
  the pictures are from the twitter/facebook/website of the clubs and the lnr , some clubs are apparently too poor to hire a professional photographer . 
  if you want to see some of 2013/14 :, 
  bayonne , bordeaux , and grenoble ( kappa ) were better last year imo . 
  castres , toulon , toulouse are nicer this year . 
  clermont is still ugly as shit . 
  castres/kipsta are selling them 40 $ , cheapest kit i think .

  * very favorable 3 % ( 27 ), 
  * somewhat favorable 13 % ( 130 ), 
  so you take `` very '' and `` somewhat '' et boom 16 % of french people now support isis !, 
  the isis question is more complex than wedding and garden , it 's more like a political party , you can agree with some of their ideas , but that does n't mean you support them completely . 
  maybe you somewhat agree that they must fight bachar el assad , or that building a caliphate is ok , but that does n't mean you agree with the beheading and destruction of shrines .

  * bein sport bought the package d, 
   package d represents exclusive rights to the two european club rugby tournaments, 
  * canal + was paying 14 million $ last year, 
  * the offer from bein is under the reserve price of 27 million $ ( the bt and sky deal is 28 million $ ), 
  * france television ( public channel ) is trying to buy the package a, 
   package a represents the first choice of a match in the european rugby champions cup , from the pool stage to the final . 
  ( france tv was broadcasting two matches per weekend , with the new deal they will only have one ), 
  well , aside from evil qatari , bein sport is only sports ( duh ) and it 's internet streaming . 
  with canal + you have sports , movies , series and le journal du hard on your tv . 
  the bad thing is that france tv will only show 1 match , so that less rugby for people who want to watch some rugby without `` paying '' .
