  i hope the lnr will get in touch with the spanish federation to try to sell them some tickets to fill the stadium . 
  they really have no other choice really , football is going to destroy them on tv if they play during the weekend . 
  maybe an ama with the head coach or somebody else from the staff , might be interesting to know how they try to grow the team and the sport in romania ?

  hum , well , last week was not very good but , my excuse is :, 
  the team selection page was not working properly , i could n't change some players . 
  so my team had players not playing , making it harder to win points . 
  that 's why i 'm near the bottom of the league . 
  but i do n't care , i will come back and win this bloody thing .

   speaking before the vote , the representative of ukraine said stalinism had killed many people in the gulag , condemning hitler and stalin alike as international criminals . 
  calling on the russian federation to stop glorifying and feeding stalinism , he said he could not support the draft text . 
  any intolerance should be dealt with in an appropriate and balanced manner , he added . 
  the manipulation of history for one 's own political agenda was wrong , he said , noting that the russian federation was supporting neo-nazi groups and terrorist groups in crimea . 
  the proposed draft resolution sent the wrong message , he added , saying he would vote against it .

  some of their players were in f\u00e9d\u00e9rale before joining the club .

  in september 12 clubs were put in a competition ( phase de brassage ) 3 pools of 4 clubs . 
  the 1st and 2nd of each pool are now in s\u00e9rie 3 ( servette won their pool ) , and 3rd et 4th are now in s\u00e9rie 4 . 
  now servette is in s\u00e9rie 3 with 5 other clubs for the rest of the year . 
  but the comit\u00e9 lyonnais ( the regional entity in charge of amateur rugby ) can apparently put a club directly in honneur ( from what i got from [ this article ] ( http://www.servettercgeneve.ch/fr/news-photos/paru-ce-matin-dans-le-parisien-aujourd-hui-en-france.html ) . 
  the pro league has already too many clubs in france , some people want to change the top 14 in top 12 .
