  you are watching tf1 : finish your drink , cry .

  ca n't really ruin international rugby when you ca n't manage to go in the world cup semi finals . 
  going for 3 points . 
  yes . 
  do you know if some germans are playing in france ?

  considering russia was part of the world cup qualification ( lost to uruguay ) , pretty big win for spain . 
  nice jersey too . 
  psa president !, 
  because they are playing scotland . 
  ~ ~ points for / points against . ~ ~ oops , tf not pf . 
  still more playtime than trinh-duc . 
  well 2014-2015 castres is a shadow of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 castres :p, 
   and an american in the first french xv ever .

   was that really their first try in 5 games ? 
  fofana scored vs argentina in november . 
   christ , psa is truly a shit coach . 
  why was n't he sacked 2 years ago again ? 
  because he is going to be sack during the world cup ; total mayhem , france world champions . 
  it 's ok , we are still shit :d, 
  fullscreen is not working on the world cup website , so annoying . 
  7 players instead of 15 players in rugby union , shorter matches . 
  hahaha , merica :d, 
  j'allais le poster , long mais tr\u00e8s bon . 
   an independent military forensics expert warned that the accuracy of crater analysis in determining direction of fire on the basis of satellite photography was scientifically unproven , ** but said that the images of firing positions on the russian side of the border were compelling and raised questions of what they were doing there . 
  if they expand to 8 nations , they should change the format and do a 2 pools tournament and a knockout stage . 
  first step for an european championship .

   it prevents the ** french team ** from developing a strategy to deal with specific players , since nobody has a clue who is going to start on match day . 
  it 's just another aspect of saint-andre 's tactical genius,

   they fear getting send to prison while they openly let themselves being interviewed by vice ? 
  smart move right there, 
  the french guy ( guillaume ) has already talked to media :, 
  the frenchies are from the same group , they have a facebook page with pictures and everything . 
  `` injured '' . 
  psa is going to call giroud for the world cup . 
  ooh nice try :d, 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  embauche des feignants !!!!, 
  the ffr has decided to create a council to select the next coach for france . 
  so the 7 guys , all of them from the top level of the ffr ( with an average age of 65 ) will sit around a table create a short list of 3 lucky winners . 
  camous the big boss will then call the number 1 on the list to ask if he wants the best job in the universe . 
  if he does n't , number 2 gets the chance . 
  a democratic , fair , and transparent process . 
  solid game from georgia , but they need to stop kicking the ball away . 
  come on clermont , put lavillenie on the field !, 
  hahaha racing . 
  france is focusing on the european grand series , so having england in the top 4 is a good thing for us . 
   i can see that for the upcoming leinster game a ticket behind the posts is # 40 . 
  i assume that touch line tickets near the middle cost around double . 
  it 's a champions cup semi final and it 's going to be at the v\u00e9lodrome in marseille . 
  i checked the toulon vs castres game in mayol : 26 $ - 80 $ . 
  i do n't see how developing rugby countries can survive in that environment . 
  what about the georgians playing in france ? 
  can the georgia union pay their wages ? 
  maybe there is too much sh players in the top 14 , but i do n't think closing the borders on players will grow the popularity of rugby . 
  not yet relegated , but close . 
   he left the position to join the ffr , where he has been the driving force behind le grand stade de rugby , the ffr 's new 82,000-seat national stadium that will open in 2020 to the south of paris . 
  aka the worst idea ever . 
   the debenture episode was totally hilarious . 
  ok , that was the worst idea ever . 
  10 000 $ for ... the right to buy tickets . 
  laporte wants to change the top 14 to a top 12 with no playoffs ( final between the # 1 & # 2 ) . 
  i 'm sure they will also talk about the jiffs and quota of foreign players . 
  double edge sword really :, 
  top 12 : only one team is relegated , making it harder for smaller team to gain access and stay in ( not really a selling point for a sponsor , and fans ) . 
  less teams , less players to choose from ( or open the selection to the second division ) . 
   but they quote one french guy who wrote a book about his encounters in syria with french djihadists . 
  d. thomson ? 
  well , if clermont lose they have an excuse now : the british conspiracy . 
  [ we all know who is behind it .

  yeah and the name !, 
  good year ... * made to feel good * ... do you remember the last time clermont had a good year and the supporters felt good ? 
  well , never , because clermont ca n't win anything . 
  if you can read french :, 
  33 kms outside of paris , they need to build new transports infrastructure around it , the budget seems shaky at best ( see the debenture failure ) . 
  how to be sure that traveling supporters would want to stay around the stadium ( hostel , restaurants ) and not go to paris instead . 
  stade fran\u00e7ais has a new stadium in paris , racing m\u00e9tro is building in la d\u00e9fense , why would they want to play in the ffr stadium ( so no `` home '' team ), 
  they want to have concerts and shows in winter ( aka during the autumn tests and the 6 nations ? 
  ) , but you already have a lot of concert halls and stadium in paris for that ( and the racing arena will also have a roof ), 
  it also means the end of test matches and top 14 playoffs around france , everything in the new stadium . 
  lol , what a total joke .
