  none , we only need luck .

  the guy on the far right is laurent fabius , the french minister of foreign affairs .

   the money in french rugby is getting silly . 
  his tweets on the financial situation of french clubs are interesting ( talking about the midi olympique investigation ), 
   2 clubs du groupe 3 totalisant 47 % des fonds, 
  the nrfl is so weird : no news on twitter or facebook , then a big announcement and back to nothing . 
  it 's not official but it seems to be heading in the right direction ( from my spanish skills ) , argentina seems to be a problem as they are also going to be in super rugby . 
  to be played in february-march , like the european one . 
  french article about it :, 
  2016 seems to early , they have a lot of problems to tackle :, 
  * teams are far away from each other , big traveling budget . 
  * only argentina is a top team and with super rugby they ca n't put their a team in the competition . 
  chile and brasil are far behind in world ranking ( not really a big selling points for tv rights ) . 
  * not a lot of professional players, 
  they could start a u20 six nations and switch to senior after a few years . 
  ok i do n't know anything about rugby in america , the way the leagues are run and what us rugby is doing to grow the game . 
  but i think the main problem with the nrfl is that they do n't talk about what they are doing , and what they want to do . 
  look at their [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/nrfl2015 ) and [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/thenrfl ), 
  no update on anything . 
  yeah we are doing a combine , back to nothing , we have a roster , back to nothing , we have a stadium , back to nothing . 
  for fuck sake i 'm not even american and it 's driving me mad , look at the [ stadium twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/lffstadium ) : they were there yesterday with a guy from leicester and they did n't share it . 
  they were on a [ small tv show ] ( https://twitter.com/bobontcn/status/588447179150327808 ) and they did n't share it . 
  they had [ a tv filming ] ( https://twitter.com/bonaguraeagles/status/588351451426066432 ) and they did n't talk about it . 
  one player was interviewed by the [ philadelphia eagles ] ( http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/videos/videos/eagles-fans-get-your-football-fix/3d79d99f-8f28-4122-a36e-543a71cc9b8f ) , guess what ? 
  they did n't share it . 
  they are not building any momentum , do a freaking interview with the guy from leicester or the ceo of nrfl , ask players how they are training , share pictures from your office . 
  show that you are doing something and that people can trust you . 
  i do n't care that they have ex nfl players , i 'm not sure that playing leicester in a big stadium for a first match is a good idea ( good for exposure , but they are not doing anything with it ) , but good luck .

  we are going to clermont 'd it . 
  we need more slow motion !, 
  woooohh yes . 
  well , it 's clermont . 
  he was on the pitch . 
  [ video here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/336gxk/does_anyone_have_a_clip_of_the_kitten_on_the_pitch/ ), 
  toulouse and clermont are like toulon , they have a lot of money and they are using it . 
  like that : http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/woody-harrelson-wiping-tears-money.gif :d, 
  and boudjellal is also the reason why toulon is getting so much hate , he is the only one saying what he really has on his mind and not hiding behind some bullshit values . 
   the easiest solution -- to stage the final in france -- may well come to pass next year , with french club officials having already lodged a bid to host the 2016 final in marseille . 
  i do n't think that 's a really good idea . 
  with france hosting the uefa euro 2016 , the top 14 final will be held in barcelona . 
  i do n't see a lot of people travelling to barcelona if we have a champions cup final in france a month before . 
  amen . 
  top 16 with pool plays or top 12 without playoffs . 
  prepare for drama . 
  i agree with him . 
  can clermont win a final ? 
  i think you can get a free ticket without buying one for the premiership here :, 
  i think it 's over for now , sorry . 
  they should do like qatar and pay people to sit in the stands . 
  et en plus l\u2019\u00eele a aussi connu une tentative de colonisation , mais humaine : [ the tyrant of clipperton island ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/the-tyrant-clipperton-island/ ), 
  french guiana is not french anymore :(, 
  poulidor master race . 
  not really working for us . 
  damn i had the same idea : mourad boudjellal buying a team from ireland and moving it to the us ( a real country with a lot of true irish supporters ) . 
  they should pick overseas players if they can add something to the squad . 
   it can be a lot harder to have access to them to monitor their health etc. 
  or to have them released to training camps, 
  solution : world rugby . 
   the aim is to also preserve the strength of the domestic league . 
  for one thing , it helps to keep up attendances which keeps up money in the union and interest in the sport . 
  counterargument : top 14 . 
   in international rugby , every test is just as important as the one that preceded it . 
  do n't really agree with that , test matches are friendlies , 6 nations and wc games are more important . 
   clubs have already been known to offer players much better contracts if they declare themselves unavailable for national duty . 
  there is no perfect solution , the clubs are the one paying the players for the most part of the year . 
   i 'm not sure what your point is here ? 
  a league can be strong and popular with foreigners , i do n't like the idea that a domestic league should be a `` training league '' for the national team ( a way to keep players busy between test matches ), 
  ( i agree with * those against * http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/rugby-union/32626996 ), 
   anyway , have you got any evidence that the top 14 is partiularly popular with foreigners ? 
  sorry bad english , top 14 is still popular even with all the foreigners playing in the league . 
  i think allowing players to move is the only way to grow rugby , nobody was complaining when georgian and fijian came to play in european clubs . 
  [ the many problems with seymour hersh 's osama bin laden conspiracy theory ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584473/seymour-hersh-osama-bin-laden ), 
  i just heard something :d, 
  woow , big fight . 
  love the portugese guy doing sound test . 
  they had the same problem last time , no sound on stream 1 and stream 2 not working . 
  everybody is leaving , nobody is coming . 
   but what about vincent moscato ? 
  i 'm not sure if you are serious or not . 
  damn , the nrfl is on fire . 
  15 august at twickenham and the week after in france . 
  surprenant !, 
  clermont directly in the semi would be nice , and racing losing would be glorious . 
  yes . 
   abu maryam al firansi was previously featured in an islamic state propaganda film that was released late last year . 
  the film promoted three french fighters of the islamic state who burned their passports and called for french muslims to wage jihad . 
  in another part of the video , abu maryam threatened france by saying islamic state `` fighters will not hesitate to chop off the heads of the enemies of islam if the french government continues bombing iraq and syria . '', 
  they still can qualify for the european rugby champions cup , what they missed was a place in the top 14 playoffs which means direct qualification for the champions cup and also bonus prize for reaching the playoffs ( 160 000 $ for the 5th and 110 000 $ for the 6th and obviously more money if you manage to win ) . 
  now they have to beat gloucester to reach the champions cup ( not really going to make money from that match ) . 
  playing the champions cup means an added bonus of 300 000 $ tv right compare to the challenge cup and also big clubs coming to bordeaux so a chance for them to play in the new * nouveau stade * ( more tickets sale , more money ) .
