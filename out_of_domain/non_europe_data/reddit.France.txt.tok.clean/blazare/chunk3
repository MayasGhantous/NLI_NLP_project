  if you generate your bootstrap css with less you really can cut down the file size . 
  but , yeah , even with that , it 's still a bit bloated ... 
  what i meant by this , is that if you generate your custom css with less ( or with the bootstrap website ) , you can choose which modules to load thus cutting down the resulting css in size .

  true , when you start getting used to it , looping is freaking easy , and the results often are awesome with little talent or effort . 
  i used to jam with my friends high as a kite with a loop , the results are crazy even when you listen to it sober :d, 
  yeah , if you can trigger the burgundy inheritance when you 're emperor you 'll inherit burgundy entirely , and you 'll be set for a wc . 
  i failed a wc last week with france , because i could n't annex portugal ( last nation standing ) and inherit its cns , i was stuck at 99 % ws since i did n't discover hawaii , i did n't take exploration as i thought it was a waste of dip points since i 'll inherit all the cns anyway , huge mistake :(, 
  my group ideas were ( maybe you can squeeze exploration before ) :, 
  - diplomatic ( you need to integrate your vassals asap and an early extra diplomat is great ) ( maybe influence is a better choice i 'm not sure ), 
  - offensive ( godlike generals , and forced march ) , edit : take exploration instead you do n't need mil ideas you 're the bbb, 
  - religious ( for deus vult ) ( maybe humanist is a better choice idk ), 
  - administrative ( maybe before religious , great when you do n't have too much manpower and need mercs , the coring reduction is also most needed ), 
  - expansion ( for the silly expansion cb ), 
  - quantity ( it does n't matter at this point anyway , since you 'll have the greatest army ), 
  - trade ( i 'm not sure at this point if it makes a difference ), 
  - plutocracy ( i needed to dump my mil points somewhere , and it was huge mistake not taking exploration ), 
  my strat was :, 
  - union with bohemia right off the bat during the hyw , you can secure 2-3 electors this way depending on bohemia 's alliances, 
  - get 4 electors if you think you can not keep austria from being reelected or ally the electors and declare war on austria to give austria an opinion malus, 
  - attack burgundy whenever you can , abuse alliances war leader change etc, 
  - keep burgundy at 75 % ws for a long time and pray for for the ineritance to trigger ( if it does n't trigger , start over , sorry ) , but not too long because dutch rebels will break burgundy and you 'll end up inheriting a gimped burgundy, 
  - manage your ae to avoid huge coalitions, 
  - keep powerful allies : denmark , castile , poland , even austria in case you 're in a coalition war ( you 're not strong enough at this point to fend off the entire europe by yourself ), 
  - keep expanding while beating burgundy , eat england bit by bit , vassalize urbino and get a foothold in italy . 
  - make your way to russia and release perm asap . 
  - release byzantium and feed them back their provinces . 
  - keep the ottomans in check and start to clear north africa ( feed algiers/morroco/tunisia , you do n't want to sink your admin points coring these provinces, 
  - watch hungary getting beat up by their neighbors , vassalize , feed back their cores, 
  - release ukraine feed them back their provinces + russians provinces so you do n't have to core everything . 
  - release styria , feed them back their provinces and annex whenever you can , you need to have a land bridge between europe and the other continents . 
  - release mazovia and feed bohemia and mazovia polish provinces ( bohemia accepts polish culture ) . 
  - release novgorod and feed them back their provinces + russian provinces, 
  - pass reforms whenever you can , do n't touch the hre expect for making a land bridge to the other continents . 
  when you pass the one that keep you reelected forever , ditch all the electors except bohemia, 
  - annex the colonizers asap ( i did n't because i was allied with castile for a long time ), 
  - roflstomp all the hordes and muslim nations , do n't be afraid to put 100k siege stacks to speed up the conquest ( you 'll have basically unlimited manpower when you unlock quantity ) , vassal feed whenever it 's possible to mitigate your ae and save up on admin points . 
  - protectorate all the asian nations and american nations . 
  - become rev. 
  france for the awesome events ( -1 war exhaustion every year , lots of stab events ) , the silly government bonuses , napoleon and the op imperialism cb, 
  a wc in ironman is really a nerve-wracking experience , especially in the end game when you start to break truces , sit on overextension ( 200 % in 1819 for me ) , and you have to micro everything . 
  i 'm not ready for another try yet . 
  yeah , thinking about it , offensive is not really needed ,, 
  i did n't take exploration because i thought i could annex the colonizers and inherit all the cns , and especially i thought i did n't have to play the colonization and exploration game which i do n't like very much ... big mistake . 
  fighting all the cns and portugal is a micro management nightmare :, 
  `` oh you got 100 ws ? 
  let me siege this province in alaska while your troops are in south america , now you 're at 99 % ws and 10 war exhaustion , good luck with that '', 
  yeah , bohemia pu is really easy to pull off , also even if austria is not called , bohemia most of the time will be allied with an elector . 
  so you can get 2 electors at once , and bohemia is a really powerful vassal ( in 1444 ) . 
  i think prestige has a lot to do with it . 
  personally , i did restart but it was for a pu over poland at the same time like in 1.6 , but i could n't do it . 
  but , each time i got my dynasty on the bohemian throne . 
  the trick is not to wait to dow for the pu when you have your dynasty on the bohemian throne , bohemia have an event to put a podebrad on the throne , and it fires very easily . 
  i usually set a pop-up for when they have a new ruler , so i can instantly dow when i have my dynasty on bohemia . 
  -60 % diplomatic annexation cost for austria with influence + admin :, 
  * -20 % cost with austrian traditions, 
  * -25 % with integrated elites from influence, 
  * -15 % with vassal integration act, 
  you can subtract another 10 % with the full sovereignty act unlocked by plutocratic , but it can be difficult to switch to a republic with austria . 
  france can benefit also from this as they have a 10 % decreased cost in their national ideas . 
  there 's also an exploit with genoa by stacking ship maintenance reductions but i do n't remember the details . 
  annex the netherlands , the revolts will stop .

  burgundy wo n't dow austria if you guarantee liege and gelre . 
  ** edit : they might dow but the chances seem to be reduced **, 
  i 've been tinkering with the hyw for the last month and found this to be the perfect ( cheesiest ? ), 
  solution , i manage to win the hyw 9 times out of 10 if i follow exactly those steps . 
  if lollards heresy fires , harsh treatment on the revolted provinces , hire mercs to deal with the stacks , if war of the roses fires , restart :, 
  * restart until austria does n't rival castile ( or else austria wo n't join ) and none of them, 
  rival you, 
  * keep 2-3 heavy ships , delete the rest, 
  * send privateers to bordeaux, 
  * hire 3 lvl1 advisors : -3 revolt risk , +5 dip rep , and 10 % discipline, 
  * disband all your generals , and keep plantagenet ( except if you 're papal controller ), 
  * make your king a general, 
  * unset national focus, 
  * save your army in normandy, 
  * kill bearn army in gascogne, 
  * ally austria and castille , proclaim guarantee on liege , gelre , morocco , that way burgundy and castille ( for morocco ) wo n't dow them if you keep a decent army . 
  * fabricate claim on scotland, 
  * keep 50 % of your army to deal with scotland, 
  * send the rest to castile to attach them to your allies ' armies, 
  * dow scotland and call to arms castille and austria , win asap, 
  * remember to consolidate your regiments, 
  * wait in the mountains or forests , pursue and stack wipe asap, 
  * carpet siege france with mercs, 
  * burgundy dow france, 
  * inheritance fires ( if you 're insanely lucky ), 
  * enjoy your pu, 
  * keep france at war all the time, 
  * integrate asap , enjoy you blob . 
  you can win the hyw with half of your manpower and no loans with this strat . 
  if you 're reckless after the pu and dow left and right , you 'll end up in a huge coalition , and even with france , you 'll be crushed . 
  keep strong allies , diplo-annex as much as possible to mitigate ae and if you annex just take one province at a time and dow only your rivals if you can .
