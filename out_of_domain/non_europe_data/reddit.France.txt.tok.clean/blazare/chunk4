  because france is guaranteeing scotland , if you call austria and spain ( manually , clicking `` call to arms '' in the dip view ) to fight scotland they will also join in the hyw , otherwise they wo n't . 
  most of the time burgundy will rival you , making it impossible to make an alliance . 
  you 're welcome . 
  the hyw is a really cool `` mini game '' , you learn a lot of things doing it . 
  i used to scumscave a lot when i first got eu4 to win this damn war , now i play ironman , and i 'm kinda proud to be able to win this honorably :d, 
  the most important thing to remember is : do n't get too greedy . 
  during one of my hyw run i managed 3 forced pu with austria , castile and france , my ae was off the roof and as you can imagine a giant coalition formed , the whole europe was against me ( muscovy included ) . 
  this is the kind of scenario where you can not win . 
  pace yourself during conquests and delay your forced pus if you have too much ae . 
  yeah , i guess the chances of them declaring war are just reduced :(, 
  i was n't very clear about the mountains , i meant france , scotland just have hills . 
  i think it 's because austria has rivaled castile or because austria has not rivaled france , i 'm a bit fuzzy on the details . 
  you can defeat france alone but you have to take a shitload of loans , very risky imo . 
  merde , tu m ` as d\u00e9masqu\u00e9 !, 
  what a load of crap . 
  saying good morning in a huge city in our day and age to someone you does n't know personally is creepy , regardless of genre . 
  moreover , everyone who saw the video know exactly what those men were seeking : sex . 
  and seeking someone attention for sexual intercourse in this kind of setting is atrocious . 
  now imagine being in her shoes every goddamn day , you 'll loose your mind . 
  i 'll not go all over the points in op 's shitpost , because it 's really a waste of time . 
  but the point that strikes me the most is the second one about the girl 's physical appearance . 
  supposedly she 's a model , yeah , why not . 
  and according to the youtube comment , if you 're not beautiful you 'll not experience that same kid of harassment . 
  actually , in my experience , if you 're ugly you 'll have it worse , men wo n't be as prudent in their comments because they will despise you for what you represent . 
  every girl i know , who live in a big city have been followed , harassed , catcalled , regardless of beauty , ethnicity and age . 
  i do n't get how on earth it can be considered innocuous . 
  i was shocked by the initial reaction downplaying the video . 
  but what i really do n't get is why people ca n't seem to let go of the thing , just accept it , and fucking choose your battles r/menrights . 
  inb4 whiteknight , sjw , i 'm just a guy who think menrights is right many times , but , please do n't play dumb and stop bullshitting yourself , you 're part of the goddamn problem by downplaying it . 
  thanks mr cumbox !, 
  yep , starforce was a real pain to crack, 
   when starforce 3.0 was released , it initially provided extremely strong protection - the starforce 3.0-protected game splinter cell : chaos theory was uncracked for 424 days . 
  [ 1 ] it also marked a significant step up in the effort required to reverse engineer it, 
  [ sfw ], 
  yeah , i thought that the point of this sub was to post plot from regular animes ? 
  i do n't see how posting borderline hentai ecchi animes is fair game ... 
  i have 1200 hours on this game and i can tell you that buildings suck , that 's the harsh truth . 
  i almost never build them except for unique buildings . 
  buildings are only there to dump extra monarch points when you 're ahead of time and you have 999 monarch points stockpiled . 
  but there are exceptions imo :, 
  * the temple which reimburse itself after 50 years . 
  * armories ; when you lack manpower in the early game ( in the lowlands for example ), 
  * trade buildings to unlock an extra merchant with your trade company, 
  * production buildings on gold provinces, 
  * trade buildings on important center of trade/estuaries, 
  yes it 's always more efficient to blob , you 'll gain more manpower , base tax and trade power that way . 
  i do n't remember the exact conditions for the peasants ' war disaster to occur , but in my current play-through with poland 1.9 , i bit the bullet as this disaster is quite unavoidable . 
  one advantage of the new disaster system is that those events are now predictable and give you some time to prepare accordingly . 
  so my advice would be to keep your manpower high , to maintain solid alliances , to keep high stab , to hire advisors and to stay away from difficult wars . 
  i try to have an heir with high legitimacy , and if i do n't , i just hang on tight . 
  the strength of poland is that you can pu a lot of nations at the small price of low legitimacy and sometimes low stats . 
  meh it really depends on the context :,

  i use [ media center master ] ( http://www.mediacentermaster.com/ ) ( not free when using the automation ) . 
  on top of its astounding media library metadata management and automation ( the best out-there by far imo ) , you can automate very easily your tv shows downloads with utorrent ( follow the quick tutorial available on youtube ) , you can also periodically fetch new movies ( based on their imdb ratings , quality etc ) . 
  the automation is not very much customizable though , and i 'm not sure if you can use private trackers . 
  i think you can use just the most popular public ones if i remember correctly . 
  also the automation is kind of an hit and miss sometimes , though 95 % of the time it is accurate . 
  anyway , i tried sickbeard and flexget too , but i did n't get past the initial setup , due mostly to the amount of new things to learn and not having really the willingness to . 
  very excited for this next expansion , weird title though : /, 
  it makes more sense than a joke , thanks .
