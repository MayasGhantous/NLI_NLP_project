  * having a decent army, 
  * being nice with your allies , especially the ottomans ( responding to call to arms , selling a province to them if they covet it ), 
  * not wasting too much points or ducats in loans , rebels , we etc, 
  * not engaging in costly wars ( european wars for example , note also that ethiopia is surprisingly a pretty tough nut to crack , so be wary ), 
  * prey on the weak, 
  as soon as you 've westernized and you 're a regional power , it 's really easy . 
  just keep a good pace in your conquests , and refer to the guide from time to time to see if you 're not too much behind schedule in terms of provinces conquered . 
  well done !,

  lucky nations are overrated imo , the bonuses are not so op as everyone claim them to be . 
  ironman will change your gaming experience , and make eu4 twice more interesting and challenging . 
  it 's really worth it , i 'm at 1500 + hours and i still ca n't get enough of this game .

  you do n't really need the inheritance to fire to get the achievement . 
  i tried like 20 times this achievement but could n't get it with the 1.12 patch , with the 1.13 patch it 's way easier ( goodbye giant coalitions ) . 
  here 's a quick and dirty guide :, 
  - restart until you can ally both austria and castile . 
  - set national focus to admin , hire lvl 1 advisors , rival only england and provence for the time being ( rivaling burgundy give them more incentive to declare war ), 
  - fabricate claims on provence and brittany, 
  - ally denmark , castile , austria ( also aragon if they rivalled england and you have a dip rep advisor ) , some of the rivals of england 's allies , and scotland . 
  do n't rm anyone , except austria and castile . 
  - stop guarantying scotland . 
  - declare war on england . 
  now the goal is to get to england and siege a fort near cumbria . 
  if england lost a lot of their armies , scotland should be willing to join your war and give you a hand on the english soil . 
  to get your troops to kent , move your fleet to normandy and wait till the portuguese and english navies are too far away to catch your army disembarking in time ( with a bit of luck english troops are in scandinavia ) . 
  siege england and try to get 100 % warscore , reclaim all of your cores and get cumbria ( very important ), 
  - fabricate claims on scotland , meanwhile dow brittany or provence ( the weakest of the two ) , go nuts on the territories conquered, 
  - dow scotland get a path to fabricate on norway , do n't drag the war too long , you need to conquer fast and you 'll get the rest of scotland later anyway . 
  - fabricate claims on norway, 
  - build some cogs and galleys ( check the ledger for the right amount to match the danish navy ), 
  - dow denmark , get all the norwegian coast plus all the isles, 
  - move your capital to norway ( very important , i failed my previous attempts because of that , it 'll allow you to core contiguous conquered provinces ), 
  - go nuts on novgorod , watch out for rebellions, 
  - if you get claims on naples via the inheritance of anjou event , and castile is n't in a union with aragon , dow and get all provinces except naples ( too much ae ) and fabricate on ragusa . 
  - alternate conquest between the balkans , scandinavia , the baltic region , russia , and england ( take the cheap provinces ) do n't take any admin techs , hire a lvl3 adm advisor when possible . 
  do n't touch most of western europe and the hre ( too costly to core and too much ae ), 
  - enjoy your bbb, 
  wow , i never thought about that , i feel so dumb now  . 
  nice find .

  alternatively from a comment below :, 
  `` far easier to support the independence of sweden right away and separate peace out for a foothold and be done with it by 1480s with so much adm you have to develop provinces . '', 
  it 's difficult to confront the whole english army on english soil . 
  reinforcements are reduced , scotland wo n't help you at first so you 'll have to rely solely on your army and except for your god tier leaders you do n't really have any military advantages at that point . 
  it 's better imo to wait for the english troops to come at you on the continent and stack wipe them with the help of your allies . 
  je comprends pas . 
  fyi , you can savescum on ironman :, 
  alt + f4 before the end of the month and make a copy of the save ( located in [ your_steam_folder ] \\ userdata \\ [ your_user_id ] \\ 236850 \\ remote \\ save games ) . 
  if you want to reload the save , delete the current save game and rename your copy . 
  really handy if you do n't know what will do certain decisions , but still cumbersome to savescum too often . 
  fyi , this feature is a bit wonky and some rendering bugs may remain unnoticed . 
  it 's a great way to see if your website is n't a mess overall , but for in depth testing it 's best to use vms or the actual devices .

  once i get bored from ousting the filthy turkomans from constantinople ( not giving it back to byzantium because \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 orthodoxy pope # 1 forever get rekt bearded priests ) i can turn my furious and just gaze across the atlantic and kill lots of savages ( not my fault those filthy natives were living on burgundian florida ) . 
  soon the whole world will be swathed in burgundian colors , or all thats actually worth ruling ( not ruling africa because africa and lots of zulu rebellions plus mosquitos ) .
