  well , til it 's not only a village name in the witcher 2 . 
  i 'm french but i use this word more than the french one . 
  alceste, 
  in france you are an organ donor except if you tell that you do n't want to ( opt-out ) . 
  so i am , and i do n't mind about it . 
  i will be dead anyway . 
  howdoyouturnthisone,

  is n't pluto a planet again ? 
  depends if you talks about the litteral use of the word disease or if you think that obesity is n't a bad thing . 
  if the second , then , i do n't agree . 
  i do n't know if you 're going to read this , buy anyway i 'll say it :, 
  religion is n't only a set of beliefs . 
  there is also the moral part , the `` philosophy '' of the said religion , and also the community part , like it is a family . 
  you can feel like a part of this family even if you do n't believe in god or whatever , that 's how i see myself . 
  because you agree with the values and try to spread the kindness the world needs and the religion teaches . 
  that said , you do n't have to at all . 
  stagnation of what ? 
  same thing for alcoohol ? 
  dude this grape looks 200 % rotten , let 's drink its juice !,

  industrial stuff can be found everywhere , but artisanal stuff like this , that 's impossible . 
  azyyyyyy, 
  balance . 
  ylva , is pronounced the same way as `` il va '' , which means `` he goes '' .

  from my experience , the older people are the friendlier they seems to be . 
  the teens being the worsts . 
  and if it 's too big for you , a good ide can adapt the length of a tab to make it look better to you . 
  you should not ask this on / r/askreddit , especially without the serious flair , but more on / r/askhistorians . 
  you 'll only get oriented answers from people that do n't know shit here . 
  and btw , [ you can start by reading this .

  * so , of course , france has lost power , vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world . 
  zemmour seems to think that massive global changes -- the tripling of the world population , decolonization , the rise of china and india -- are things that france 's politicians could have and should have resisted . 
  but the sinister conspiracies and suicidal decisions that he identifies at every turn are simply the products of the world changing *, 
  a ce point ?

  / nazi,
