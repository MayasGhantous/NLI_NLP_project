  huge emotion the first days . 
  then after a week back being french . 
  je suis en train d'en manger en plus !, 
   as a breton i think our little country should have a status like scotland in the uk, 
  lol, 
  crtl+f `` nazi '' 0 results . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  now the national/regional identity depends on the number of inhabitants ... 
   that 's what ** only very very few ** bretons are asking for . 
  it 's not like france agrees with that . 
  ftfy, 
  oh yeah i forgot about that . 
  latin or french is n't it ? 
  i had several partners in neuss , dierdorf and d\u00fcsseldorf .

   `` i 've learned my whole life the exact opposite . '', 
  hahahaha, 
  the language is basically the same . 
  the difference consists mostly on expressions and the accent . 
  the `` main '' difference is 70 and 90 which are `` soixante-dix '' and `` quatrevingt-dix '' in france but `` septante '' and `` nonante '' in belgium . 
   for instance , belgians are self-mocking , whereas french people are not . 
  this hahaha, 
  yeah sure . 
  but let 's drink a beer first .

  je plaide coupable . 
  wtf, 
  on s ` en fout non ? 
  we do n't give a damn . 
  mostly . 
  do n't trust people who says that they are persecuted , it is completely false . 
  i do n't mean to be rude , but very very very few french people are interested in learning indian . 
  i never heard of people trying to learn it , let alone making an exchange program . 
  but it 's not because i do n't know them that they does n't exist . 
  there are many `` indian '' looking people in france . 
  way less then in england , but still . 
  i think people generally still have the `` old '' way of thinking about it : no problem , but embrace the french culture and values . 
  otherwise get lost . 
  i did n't see much of a change in the opinion of my entourage during the recent events . 
  immigration is still kinda taboo and a very complicated subject , and has been for decades . 
  the english colonization and the french colonization are very different . 
  the english one is basically `` do as you like , but give us your ressources '' . 
  the french one is `` do as we please , give us your ressources and learn what a good civilization is '' . 
  so what we could assume , is that there would be way more french thing in the indian everyday life . 
  otherwise it 's way to difficult to say . 
  sometimes the old french colonies became very very poor , others it went more smoothly . 
  i do n't know . 
  but this is a really good question you could ask to / r/askhistorians . 
  i 'd love to know the answer . 
   is dupleix known at all ? 
  i 've never heard of him at all . 
   how do you guys view napoleon ? 
  he 's seen as the last `` great conqueror '' behind hitler who ... well ... you know ... nazis ... 
  napoleon is like our caesar . 
  made the country a great power and his memory and legacy are still present in the french culture . 
  he mostly has a positive memory here . 
   how big was the 1968 riots and is it relevant anymore ? 
  i do n't know much about it , but it was a studient riot who basically wanted to do what they wanted . 
  one would say that it is a improvement of the liberties . 
  the others would say that it is the start of the consumer society in our country . 
  but it is mostly positively viewed atm imho . 
   do you guys watch french films more than hollywood , or is it other way around ? 
  france is one of the few countries with a protective attitude towards its culture . 
  `` l'exception culturelle '' as its called . 
  i do n't think you need a translation on this one , 
  basically , the state subsidize the culture . 
  and there are laws like , for the music , the radios must broadcast french musics . 
  so there are many many french films that we watch . 
  i do n't know the proportion with the hollywood ones , but i 'd say it 's nearly 50/50 . 
  according to wikipedia , the most soccessful movies in france are :, 
   avatar, 
  you know the names of the hollywood ones , the others are french . 
  nobody mentionned coktails but most women drink em imho . 
  men are more likely to drink beers . 
  and belgian ones . 
  bitch please !, 
  the others are mostly water . 
  i suggest we stop calling them beers !, 
  sorry about it if it has already been answered . 
  what comes to my mind when i think of india :, 
  - how is gandhi seen in india ? 
  in france he 's basically seen as a 200 % peaceful guy , like the reverse che guevarra . 
  but we do n't know much about him otherwise .
