  - what about the casts in the indian society ? 
  i 've heard it changes , but slowly . 
  what do you think of it ? 
  could you tell in the street which cast someone belongs too ? 
  and is there really no way to change your condition ? 
  - i 'm sorry to say , but when thinking of india , we have in mind the bad indian movies that are mostly copies of hollywood ones , but in a ridiculous way . 
  but i do n't blame india , americains are really good at making bad films too . 
  anyway , i really like this [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tlrut0h2q ) . 
  last question we could ask to every country : since you 're not in the western world , how is it seen in your country ? 
  i 've never heard of a particular hate , but i can only assume . 
  another one : how is china viewed in india ? 
  another one \u00b2 : do you guys have as much difficulty understanding is speaking english as much as you do ? 
  sorry , but geez , in the professionnal world , you guys are known to be very very difficult to comprehend . 
  and lastly , india is a very capitalistic state is n't it ? 
  is there some socialism/communism there ? 
  thank you for your time , indian friends !, 
  edit : i 've recently read siddhartha , by herman hesse . 
  i know it 's not an indian book , but it takes place in india , and i loved it . 
  if by any means someone read it too here , 
  ah mommy is on my hdd but i still have n't watched it :(, 
  culture is a really risky carrer choice . 
  the thing is the state distribute much money , but to a few `` chosen ones '' . 
  that means that stars who are already famous will become more famous and will have easy access to the money , but at the start it 'll be way more difficult . 
  and culture is by essence a very precarious situation . 
  so even if you can live of it thanks to the state , you wo n't have much money and a very unstable situation . 
  but i 'll let people who know more about it speak of it . 
  i 'm not at all in this field . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you , you too !, 
  perso je carbure aux shampoing de pharmacie . 
  concert de moderat \u00e0 l'olympia du 28 mars sold out . 
  i 'd say first you have to visit paris , for the cultural/historical aspect . 
  i do n't even have to convince you it is worth it . 
  it is a region where there are many of the most beautiful and biggest castles in the world ( for instance [ one of my favourite ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/chateau_de_chenonceau_2008e.jpg ) and it 's not even the most famous one ) . 
  this is very clich\u00e9 french renaissance , but it is way worth it too . 
  the 3rd thing i 'd suggest you is : anywhere . 
  just go anywhere in the countryside and try to see the small villages you 'll encounter , and try local specialities . 
  there are way too much to say about them . 
  le `` terroir '' as we call it . 
   also is zlatan popular in france ? 
  he 's one of the most famous yes . 
  we all know him and parisians supporters worship him . 
  so yes , he is . 
   what do you guys think of quebec and quebcois ? 
  they are like cousins . 
  we do not know much about them , except their famous accent , but we still consider them as part of the family . 
  the thing is , many french went to quebec . 
  it 's another culture ( quebec is closer to the usa culturally speaking ) , but the french thing helps many french people to find the courage to go this far from home . 
  sadly , many french people make laugh of their accent . 
  i find this very unrespectful for them . 
  depends on the situation and the guy you encounter . 
  if i 'm in a hurry , i 'd rather you to speak english than try to speak french if i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  [ found it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nhn5w7lrby ), 
  never heard of it though . 
  seems that it is a child song . 
  not something famous nationwide at all . 
  except the pronounciation , it 's quiet easy . 
  english is like a mix between a ( way ) easier version of german with half of french vocabulary . 
  yep !, 
  dota 2 is not as much popular as lol in france though . 
  we can speak about it as long as you 're not russian . 
  heard that pinoys are like them on your server haha . 
  hum , not as much as many other countries . 
  i 'd say 2/3 of the people should be able to help you without much problems ( especially the young ones , the oldest one is more like 1/15  ) . 
  but i do n't know the official number , since i never speak english to my fellow comrades randomly .
