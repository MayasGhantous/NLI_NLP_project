  it is the most common accent we hear . 
  so for me it 's not especially beautiful , but not especially bad . 
  easy or difficult , depends if you articulate or not . 
  the people that do not articulate , it 's impossible haha . 
  the other , like the politicians , no problems at all .

  hello there !, 
  i wonder first , should i speak english or french ? 
  since the sub 's description is in english i 'm going to do it in english . 
  so , about my questions to my fellow lebanese people :, 
  - when i think about lebanon , the first thing that comes to my mind are the gorgeous women there and the plastic surgery . 
  is it as much prevalent as we hear it ? 
  - do you feel threathened about isis ? 
  since for us it 's pretty close !, 
  - what about your relations with israel ? 
  how do you consider them ? 
  the state , and the people ? 
  if more comes to my mind i 'll edit my message . 
   socialopes, 
  merci :d,
