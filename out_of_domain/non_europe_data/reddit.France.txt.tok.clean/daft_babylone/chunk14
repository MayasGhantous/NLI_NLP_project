  well for us , italian cuisine is motly pizza and noodles so ... sounds clich\u00e9 but i do n't think many of us really know much about italian cuisine . 
  except maybe people who have italian ancestors ( and there are much of them here ) . 
   what do you think should be done with the waves of immigrants hitting italian coasts ? 
  do you think it 's an italian or european problem ? 
  european mostly , because they use italy as a waypoint , not a destination iirc . 
  who would like to live there ? 
   what are some unexpected subtle differences between italian and french culture ? 
  as they say , france is the most germanic latin country , or the most latin germanic country . 
  we tend to be more `` cold '' ( if that does makes sense in english ) than you guys . 
  probably has to do with the temperatures haha . 
   when will you give us back the joyeuse ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   how does it feel to live without bidets ? 
  well , i 've never used one of those : /, 
  for a long time i thought it was to wash your feet . 
  for the numbers it was because on older times they counted with a base of 20 . 
  30 would be smth like `` vingt-dix '' , 40 `` deux-vingt '' , and so on . 
  the only remaining ones are `` quatre-vingt '' and `` quatre-vingt-dix '' . 
  i do n't know shit about the `` r '' though . 
  `` sauceur '' used to be a real job haha . 
  and yeah , funny that you point it out . 
  i personally think that the sauce is what makes 90 % of a dish ' thaste . 
  mount & blade : warband . 
  j'ai d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 before it was cool . 
  let 's go make a new brand of restaurants : no `` real '' dish , only sauce and bread . 
  ^ ( sorry google translate ), 
  oh ok , i did n't know at all . 
  haha , well , never heard of it !, 
   not as ** good ** as ours . 
  ftfy, 
  what the fuck is this, 
  [ let 's clean our ears . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvvd-9azd1m ), 
  where are the rabbits ?!, 
  except in very very very isolated rural parts , and only for some of the oldest people , we do speak the same language with just slight pronounciation differences . 
  not top ten , but i 'll stick with a top 3 . 
  1 ) [ porc orloff ] ( http://media.paperblog.fr/i/372/3724489/roti-porc-orloff-l-1.jpeg ) ( sliced pork with cheese and bacon within each slice ) . 
  2 ) snails with garlic butter ( not much to explain here ), 
  3 ) more local one and less fancy : [ p\u00e2t\u00e9 cro\u00fbte ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/p%c3%a2t%c3%a9_cro%c3%bbte_champenois.jpg/216px-p%c3%a2t%c3%a9_cro%c3%bbte_champenois.jpg ), 
   why do you refuse to accept and oficialize the several languages spoken in the french territory ? 
  well it 's too late now , most of the regional languages are now lost , or nearly lost . 
  thanks to champagne ? 
   italy does n't have a reputation of being a industrial, 
  for me it does . 
  see the cars & motorcycles industries . 
  joke aside , i personaly use `` simple '' oil for my salad . 
  well they are ok , but it 's like german beer compared to belgish beer . 
  same name , but not the same league . 
  and * yalalahihouuuuuuuuuu *, 
  no idea, 
  got some family in malzy . 
  i do n't remember hearing anything like in * bienvenue chez les ch ` tis * . 
  not that exagerated at least . 
  except some expressions of course . 
  i do , and they do too , love maroilles though . 
  til . 
  + vinaigre + moutarde of course . 
  idem avant un double point . 
   when it comes to cooking , with our powers combined , we shall show those brits and muricans, 
  lol . 
  we do n't need to cooperate to beat them when it comes to cooking . 
  even a single region of france ( and probably italy ) is enough . 
  bon . 
  [ eddy - lodela ] ( https://soundcloud.com/senlis/eddy-lodela ), 
  ouell okay ich bin french ich bin bad at englishing !, 
  latinized germans rpz, 
  ca m 'em p\u00eache pas de participer au end game . 
  etc etc ... 
  japanese tourists are cute . 
  when you 're on a `` road crosspath '' ( idk about the word ) , there are 2 types of people : the french and the tourists . 
  the french do n't give a damn if it 's green or red . 
  the tourists do care . 
  and among the tourists there are 2 types : the japanese and the rest . 
  if a japanese is in the middle of the path , and the red light shows up , he/she goes like `` waaaaaah '' and go back . 
  waiting for the next green light . 
  i find it cute . 
  this, 
  man , when you speak to an american he 's speaking like you know each other since childhood , which is not the case . 
  he goes like `` oh yeah ?!!!, 
  '' , `` that 's awesome !! '', 
  for everything you say . 
  it 's fun 5 minutes , but yeah it sounds so hypocrite to us . 
  otherwise , parisians are mostly `` ruder '' than the rest of french people , but not that much . 
  mostly depends on the situation : parisians in a bar at night are mostly just as friendly as anyone else . 
  it just takes more time to `` break the glass '' . 
  par contre :, 
  on a un mix d'utopisme et na\u00efvet\u00e9 . 
  de la litt\u00e9rature auditive . 
  ftfy, 
  tiens on est le 1er mars . 
  source ? 
  faut faire un m\u00eame didi en mode `` deal with it '' . 
  hey ,, 
  well , glad you like our food and culture , but those are certainly not enough if you want to move here . 
  first : you have to learn french if you want to live here . 
  except ( maybe ) if you only want to live your retired life here . 
  and sorry to be harsh , but the fact that some of your ancestors are french does n't change anything . 
  you have a nice discussion topic though , talking about ancestry . 
  did you ever come here ? 
  you just tell us about your us life , not about what your real plans are .
