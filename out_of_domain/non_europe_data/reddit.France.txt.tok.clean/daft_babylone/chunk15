  normal, 
  the `` happiness '' thing . 
  all those stupid `` positive '' quotes and the `` believe in your dreams and work hard for it '' mentality . 
  god ... 
  tired of this shit ... 
  and the whole emotion business . 
  in the us ( and in france more and more sadly ) , everything is driven through the emotional scope . 
  i hate it . 
  critize everything . 
  and especially everyone . 
  we mostly do n't give a damn at her since her first album . 
  but that album had a very very huge success . 
  so we all know her . 
   call the french `` surrendering cowards '' ? 
  i do n't think many english people are doing it . 
  it mostly comes from the us afaik . 
  i have a personal preference for peugeot . 
  totally overrated . 
  there are many other paintings that are way more beautiful . 
  and english ones as well on older times . 
  since they are the true lazy gals , they dropped it . 
  as you may know , electronic music is very popular today in france ( we can see it has been for 25 years ) . 
  but what in malaysia ? 
  what are the most popular music styles , and is there an electronic scene there ? 
  did n't even know the english word for that . 
  yes we say only `` plaster '' . 
  what is the difference between the one from paris and the one `` from nowhere '' ? 
   hybrid of electronic music and anime songs, 
  why does n't it surprise me coming from the japs . 
  we do n't . 
  if you think about the reddit count , it is to make fun of that foreigner joke .

  except two things :, 
  nuff said . 
  - seems that your country is a new trending destination to party . 
  what do you think about it ? 
  have you seen any changes in the tourists you get ? 
  had a black friend traveling there a few months ago .
