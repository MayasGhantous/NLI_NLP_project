  fashion for teens : nope . 
  de la casa ? 
  honestly i still believe there 's a delay . 
  teens will not search for things by themselves , things become popular once they get aired on tv & radios . 
  we often see songs that are hugely popular in the uk , then get released in france like 6 months later and only then get the same ovationhere . 
  they still do n't play the music if they ca n't . 
  it 's still the majors that decide when they want to play what music in which country . 
  the proof of this system is that songs are often released way before the official movie clip is recorded , which allows the song to become succesful nearly every time . 
  hahahaha !, 
  si tu t ` appelles fran\u00e7ois ou claude , tu es fichu !, 
  til, 
   this is a custom reddit css theme to make subreddits look attractive and easy to use . 
  getting drunk has always been popular nearly everywhere haha . 
  excellent !, 
  mais probablement . 
  ps : `` yougov says that france 's general lack of christmas spirit could be because of discontent with government , weak economic growth , and anxiety over immigration '' =  total bullshit . 
  i do n't know much about this particular fields , but there is aldebaran robotics in paris , which seems to be one ( if not the one ) of the leaders about robotics . 
  the other questions : no idea . 
  the last one : every city has the same policy about tobacco , so there wo n't be much difference between them , except if you take the population density in mind . 
  which means the less dense the better for you . 
  je propose la `` incestie '' , t ` en penses quoi ? 
  a destination d'adolescents aussi .

   3/10 would not do again, 
  t ' y as jou\u00e9 ? 
  funny you 're talknig about a cursive . 
  for me ( a french guy ) , it 's the other way around . 
  even though i find english ugly ( but i do n't have a choice i have to speak it ) , french is a `` flat '' language , while english does have a `` melody '' when speaking ( well , more the uk english than the us english , but still ) . 
  i hope you see where i 'm going , it 's difficult to explain :p, 
  edit : grill\u00e9 . 
  haha tu m ` as fait rire salopard !, 
  bienvenue au club . 
  t'es militant socialiste ? 
  [ fyi ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/syndrome_du_voyageur ), 
  je sais pas comment \u00e7a marche le shadowban , mais l\u00e0 on a un candidat . 
  sorry to be that guy , but your sentence does n't make any sense . 
  we can guess where you 're going though in this context . 
  `` les etats-unis se distinguent par la france '' means something like the usa are shining thanks to france . 
  i do n't think that 's what you meant . 
  today 's islam has not a single thing in common with the yesterday 's catholic church , at least from france 's point of view . 
  thet . 
  boom headshot . 
  i could do that . 
  [ tu n'as pas \u00e0 t ` excuser .

  marseille [ is n't even the most dangerous city in france . 
  ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminalit%c3%a9 ) so in europe ... 
  and according to several sources , there are ~ 25 % muslims in marseille . 
  not 40 % . 
  you could work at fox news . 
  lol !, 
  `` four gangland murders in three weeks . 
  but is marseille really the most dangerous city in europe ? '', 
  `` while precise data is not available , research suggests that somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of marseille 's population is muslim '', 
  awesome sources . 
  if i 'm not really lucky , the motorcycle . 
  if i 'm less lucky than that , drugs . 
  same here , got my first accident shortly before christmas ( just a small thing , but it makes you think ) . 
  made me slow down a bit . 
  one month later and i 'm on my way again the same way as before . 
  motorcycle riding has taught me to tolerate the cold . 
  everyday people ask me how i do it . 
  but well , when riding hours long in the cold , you just have to ignore it , because it will not go away . 
  also lived for some time in north england . 
  people are crazy there being in t-shirt at night outside in winter . 
  not even talking about the girls in mini skirts . 
  i guess alcohol helps a lot in this situation . 
  nice try . 
  my steam account . 
  i live there . 
  oh god how much i would give to make parisians friendlier ... 
  except that it 's really nice . 
  just too much people and too expensive . 
  in a country with friendly people , where governments are n't too invading , yet help people in need . 
  where people do n't try to steal others , are gumble , open-minded and respectful . 
  where everything is legal that ca n't harm others . 
  where there is the sun more than 1/3 of the year . 
  utopia ... 
  unless you a zombie . 
  best thing to make someone get bad habit is to give them bad things at first . 
  excel , call people , send mails , and excel again . 
  i do n't believe in god , but i think religion is a good thing . 
  mostly .
