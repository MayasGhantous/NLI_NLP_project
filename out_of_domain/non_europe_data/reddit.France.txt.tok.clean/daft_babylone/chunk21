  nice . 
  hello ,, 
  i have some i highly recommend . 
  however , do you accept non-translated books ? 
  hello there !, 
  as asked by / u/leowr , i will share to you some of my favourite french books . 
  i read them in french , so i do n't know what the quality of a translation ( if any ) is . 
  - my favourite book : * flash * - charles duchaussois . 
  the story of a young frenchman that goes yolo in the 60 's and travels through the world , describing his vagabond life . 
  this book also focused on the drugs in the hippie capital that was katmandou at the time . 
  this book seems to have been translated in italian and spanish , but i ca n't find an english version . 
  - * corsaire de la republique * - louis garneray . 
  the story of a french corsair in the early 19th century . 
  it describes very well the life of a sailor at the time , with the epic battles against the brits and the everyday problems . 
  there are three tomes of his adventure . 
  they seems to be [ translated in english ] . 
  - the one i 'm reading at the moment . 
  and currently a best seller in france . 
  * trois amis en qu\u00eate de sagesse * ( three friends seeking wisdom ) - matthieu ricard , alexandre jolien and christophe andr\u00e9 . 
  this one is a more spiritual one . 
  it 's just three friends that are talking about life , spirituality , etc ... each one from its own point of view . 
  since those three have really different point of views ( one is a bouddhist monk , one a christian philosopher , and the last one a psychologist ) , they all have their own experiences and they share it with each other . 
  a nice thing you can see in this one , is that they mostly agree with each other . 
  science , religion and philosophy are not that much different !, 
  this one does n't seem translated yet , but the previous books of matthieu ricard have been . 
  so it might be done in a close future . 
  otherwise , they are all the classic books , but it 's been some time since i 've read them , so i 'll let other talk about them . 
  and at the moment i love hermann hesse 's books , but he is n't french at all :p i hope the german redditors quote him when their literrature thread comes in . 
  i added amazon links on all my suggestions , but received a bot message . 
  had to remove them all :'(, 
   an enfp who has `` gone wrong '' may be quite manipulative -- and very good it . 
  the gift of gab, 
  which they are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want . 
  fear the manipulative / u/daft _ babylone !,
