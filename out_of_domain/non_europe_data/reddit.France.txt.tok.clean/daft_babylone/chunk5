  lol, 
  poste ta photo et on verra si on arr\u00eate . 
   i would say that western regions are cheaper ( especially brittany ) . 
  overall paris , lyon and the south east of france are the most exepensive areas . 
  again the north-east of france does n't even exist !, 
  rule : the more people the more expensive ( like in every country ? 
  je suppose qu ' \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque on avait pas l'habitude de se prendre en photo en train de se dorer la pillule , en train de sauter des portillons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui ne devaient pas exister et le salon de l'agriculture devait \u00eatre quelque chose de tout \u00e0 fait normal .

  enorme !, 
  merci , 
  - yes , totally . 
  i 'm 1/4 polish but all my other roots come from the land where my parents/great-parents/great-great-parents / etc. ... come from . 
  also never got to experience that polish legacy so it 's like it was non-existent to me . 
  - means that i was born here and received a french education . 
  i truly think that my country is great and that our values are , or should be , universal . 
  however , most people do think the same way about their country . 
  being french means , imho , to be proud . 
  proud of yourself , proud of your country , proud to tell your opinion , even when it means getting into conflict , or should i say , especially when it means getting into conflict . 
  maybe too much proud that some people might think of it as arrogance , and that some other can really be arrogant . 
  - one should be tempted to say when events like charlie hebdo happend or the football world cup , but i will say it 's when you talk about other countries . 
  inside france , everyone is constantly critisizing the country , but when critizes come from outside there is this unity i like where basically every french guy tells the stranger to fuck off , with arguments most of the time . 
  i like to tell myself that french people are more aware of the way their country works that most other people in the world , with its downsides as well . 
  and btw , this is not typically french , but i love the liberty we have . 
  we can do quiet everything we want , as long as it does n't impact someone else . 
  i really cherish this laxism . 
  it 's not like in the usa where you can go to jail for drinking a beer at 18 years old , or in some asian place where you can be beheaded for smoking pot . 
  it seems that its mostly a european thing . 
  maybe we suffered too much in the past that we can now enjoy ourselves peacefully . 
  i do n't know . 
  edit : i 'll add this `` globalization scepticism '' that all the world pisses us with . 
  i really love this independancy thing about france . 
  is that really a good thing to be like england where all the economy comes from the city ? 
  that the gdp is high , but the inequalities too ? 
  all hail globalization , where the human exploitation is at the entire world scale . 
  funny thing to see the difference between the answers here and what we can find on other subs where op asked the same question . 
  the brits do n't seem that be especially proud of their nationality , unlike us your beloved neighbours . 
  i love this band !, 
  it happend to a friend 's wife who is american . 
  she had to pay some caution . 
  maybe badluck though . 
  but when i went there they refused to give me a beer :(,
