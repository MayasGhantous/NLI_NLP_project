  i 'm starting to guess how renting got that crazy in auckland ... ( the rents are somewhat equivalent to paris cheapest neighbourhood , but paris is possibly the densest city of the western world ! ) . 
  can you guys provide me with some info about how auckland got that expensive , since it 's certainly not due to the lack of space ? 
  i really did n't expect that kind of rents coming in here and i 'm curious about the reasons . 
  edit : just to be precise , the `` rent cap '' in france is only active in `` tense areas '' where the market was going out of control a bit too much ( generally the few biggest , densest cities ) . 
  manageable maybe , but i still find it quite outrageous ( i hope my rent would not be increased like that ... ) . 
  maybe there 's some cultural shift here . 
  do n't know what you mean by `` how i found it '' ... 
  it was on the first / r/newzealand reddit page , so i just clicked !, 
  yup . 
  overall you mean ? 
  so it 's not what one would pay , but what one would cost then ? 
  those are two very different things ... 
  the thing that tickles me about health care expenses is that that website is stating that you would spend less in health care living in nz than in france , which seems silly to me given that most expenses are covered by the state in france . 
  et c'est normal que \u00e7a pose question . 
  i 'm not so focused on `` average '' ( well , of course it 's an average , all of these are average statistics ) than `` spend '' . 
  hence my question about it being what people `` pay '' or what they `` cost '' . 
  there is a difference . 
  i appreciate the help , but you do n't seem to get what i want to know : on what statistics in the `` money on health care '' is based . 
  u/kezzanz sentence seems to suggest that it is based on the total ( national ) health care expenses , which might or might not include what the state spent as well . 
  hence my question to him . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , sure . 
  but it changes who pay actually ( i.e. 
  the richest and healthiest people are paying for the poorest and sickiest people when the government is involved ) . 
   opensuse 's implementation of kde ( maybe because i was just too used to kde neon , and i 'm not adept enough to change all the settings to get the look that i want ), 
  but that 's a few clicks to change !, 
  system config  workspace theme  you select breeze . 
  bam , you 're done !, 
  also , i suggest you to have a look at [ geckolinux ] ( http://geckolinux.github.io/ ) . 
  it 's basically opensuse made easy ( it 's not a different distribution , so you get opensuse , just with better defaults ) . 
  happy to be of help !, 
  if by broken , you mean that it does n't display the number of new messages anymore , then it 's the same here . 
  or a bug report ? 
  i did so with a drag and drop bug fix in kmail and the patch was integrated super quickly . 
  the kde guys are very responsive !, 
  and yes , it seems they 'd rather patch one by one rather than do a `` bulk '' update , which is consistent with leap being a conservative distribution imho . 
  edit : stupid me , a link to a bug report was in the opening message ... 
  ce ne sont pas des `` kangourous '' \u00e0 proprement parler qui sont dans les yvelines , mais des [ wallabys de benett ] ( http://www.cerf78.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=215:enquete-sur-le-wallaby-de-bennett-en-foret-dyvelines&amp;catid=13&amp;itemid=151 ) , qui sont franchement plus petits que les kangourous . 
  que faire ? 
  que faire ? 
  comme dirait un certain donald : this is fake news !, 
  et en utilisant du [ reproducible build ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deterministic_compilation ) ? 
  l\u00e0 , on arrive au vrai argument . 
  it seems one thing that baloo does and angrysearch does n't is to search text * within * documents . 
  or did i miss something ? 
  pour une fois , l' [ assembl\u00e9e nationale ] ( http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/documents/notice/14/propositions/pion4421/%28index%29/depots ) \u00e9tait sur le coup . 
  - le papier se recycle bien, 
  a vietnamese once asked me and a friend what `` oh l\u00e0l\u00e0 '' meant ... we never produced an answer making sense for him !, 
  the bowl especially true for children and hot chocolate . 
  one thing we do n't do with hot chocolate , however , is put marshmallow in it !, 
  no , and oh lala , it was hard to explain !, 
  the problem is , every time you think you ran out of the various meanings of `` oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0 '' , you stumble upon another one . 
  it 's a mess to explain to a foreigner ... 
  i said `` especially '' , not `` exclusively '' !, 
  il suffirait de rajouter un param\u00e8tre de dispersion \u00e0 ta multinomiale-dirichlet . 
  it 's not just asian/indian and overpopulated cultures ... we french never queue for the bus , we just wait as we like it and when the bus come , we gather around the front door and hop on the bus , no big deal . 
  seriously , we do n't see any need for queuing . 
  ( it might help that people vary scarcely get off using the front door ) . 
  queuing drove me crazy in brisbane : there was a bench at 20m from my bus stop , but if you wanted not to be the very last person to board the bus , you had to stand and queue . 
  seriously that still makes no sense to me ... 
  that being said i 'm queuing here as soon as a queue is formed , i do n't have to impose my views in people from another country . 
  well , then , if i was the first there , but i 'm sitting on my bench , i 've been waiting the longest . 
  yet , i 'm not `` first in the queue '' . 
  the queue is more of a self-organised system to detect who 's been there first . 
  a system that requires that you stand up at a precise spot while you wait . 
  i 'd rather sit down on my bench and have a fifty-fifty chance to get a seat on the bus . 
  my `` privilege '' on being there first would be the bench ( unless an elderly person arrive of course ) and everything is reset when we get on the bus . 
  would what that make less sense ? 
  as i said , i respect that you require people forming a queue . 
  it 's a system as any other , it 's the one tacitly in place in the country i live in , i ought to respect it . 
  i 'm just stating that this is not an obvious `` best '' system and people not doing it are not `` less civilised '' . 
   have to disagree there , it should n't be a clusterfuck when you get on . 
  everyone should get in a line and orderly move onto the bus . 
  frankly , i have n't noticed an improvement in the speed of getting in the bus between france and australia ( i 'm putting nz aside because i have n't actually seen many bus queues here as op is complaining about ) . 
  i understand that you do n't like it and it 's a bit more `` brutal '' , but it 's not as uncivilised you or op are describing it : people converge to the front door and then enter the bus one by one , it 's really not that big a deal and it 's civilised ( though not `` ordered '' ) to me . 
  edit : by `` brutal '' i mean you can in physical contact with other persons . 
  nothing to do with the `` hairy apes '' of op, 
  to be sure : i 'm not saying one system is better than the other . 
  my point is exactly the opposite of that . 
  a ) yes , but i felt the situation i described above as unfair too , as the fact that thoughtful smokers have to be last as you mentioned, 
  b ) sure they will, 
  c ) i understand you do n't like this , i personally do n't mind , really, 
  d ) my impression is that conflicts occur more often because people `` did n't respect the queue '', 
  e ) no , it does n't , because in the end , everybody gets in the bus , and most people do n't care really, 
  it 's really not that black and white ... 
  seems i ca n't convince you then . 
  queuing in the supermarket , cinema , park is a continuous process : you choose a queue , you wait for your turn , you pay , you go on to your life ( or your movie ) . 
  it 's totally unrelated to what happens for a bus , where everybody wait to enter the bus at one point in time . 
  you do n't queue for the train , for example , at least in australia they did n't . 
  you 've got assholes everywhere . 
  if they do n't want to queue , they wo n't and tell you to f. . k off if you dare to complain about it . 
  but you might think about the fact that in france , we do n't expect `` first arrived , first seated '' so we less inclined to call people arriving late and getting first on the bus `` assholes '' . 
  actually , many people get on the bus first and just do n't sit . 
  it 's not an open war ... 
  it 's just different expectations of behaviour , is all i 'm saying . 
  and we 're far from the `` sheep vs wolves '' scenario you depict . 
  i 'm actually amazed at all this judgement by the mere thing of getting of a bus . 
  british people are just as crazy about queues , and we really ( honestly ! ), 
  do n't understand why all this fuss . 
  anyway , my aim was not to convince you ` our ways are better ' ( i do n't think they are ) , but just to offer a cultural counterpoint to the fact that queuing for the bus is not something obvious in other cultures , and it 's not necessary because we 're barbarians .
