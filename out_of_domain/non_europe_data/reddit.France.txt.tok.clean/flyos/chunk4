  now , you may think that we are , and i honestly could n't blame you , especially given the recent behaviour of french tourists in nz , but i assure you , contrary to what trump says , france is not in state of war about everything ... including getting on the bus !, 
  edit in response your edit : `` retarded '' , `` stupid '' ... whooo , you really are triggered are n't you ? 
  it just work like this in a country of 60 millions people and many others , but sure , we 're all retarded ... -_- never forget that `` personal space '' varies a lot between cultures ( finnish and italians are huge contrasts to that regard ) . 
  so , yeah , this system might not be compatible with kiwi culture and that very fine for me , but please stop considering other ways of doing this are inherently bad based on your own cultural background ... 
  i get that you 're upset , but please read all my messages : i 've never stopped stressing that here , in nz and australia , i respect the queues for getting on the bus !!, 
  and please , stop saying our ways are `` inferior '' , that 's a tad offensive . 
  we do things differently , because our cultures are different . 
  i just wanted to stress that other ways of getting on the bus exists and people even survive it , mind you . 
  you just dismiss everything i said , but , yeah , good talk in the void of space ... : /, 
  i 'm saying our cultures are different . 
  you find it superior ** from your cultural point of view ** . 
  and of course you do !, 
  but it 's ** not ** objectivity . 
  just the illusion of it . 
  feelings have nothing to do with it . 
  personal space -  cultural, 
  first arrived , first seated as a `` fair '' practice -  cultural, 
  `` it 's going to be a mess , it needs order '' -  cultural ( yes , it is , different cultures - and individuals - have different levels of `` messiness '' ), 
  it 's might be rationally optimised for you , in part because you 're you and in part because of the culture you were raised in , but the criteria you 're using ** are ** of arbitrary origins in a large part . 
  this is ** not ** about convincing you to ** change ** you ways . 
  this is about realising the criteria you 're basing your evaluation on are not universal . 
  also , icon-tasks makes more sense vertically . 
  and since the screens are wide nowadays , having my panel vertical feels better to me . 
  but i agree that the docks are not super different from icon-tasks . 
  it 's just icon-tasks that makes coffee !, 
  well , everyone set up his desktop to his/her taste . 
  i find personally that anything containing texts ( web browser , pdfs , code ... ) will require vertical rather than horizontal space to be read correctly , hence my preference for vertical panels . 
  it 's only natural that it 's not everyone 's taste !, 
  i think he meant the omg!ubuntu website . 
  ubuntu does n't use kde , but kubuntu does . 
  i guess that 's why ? 
  i mean , kde is officially packaged for ubuntu . 
  jarred diamond , dans `` collapse '' , montre bien que si on peut trouver des causes proximales au g\u00e9nocide rwandais , la cause distale est tr\u00e8s vraisemblablement la surpopulation et ses cons\u00e9quences sur les conditions de vie de la population . 
  it 's not just you , there is a bug report about that . 
  sorry i do n't have the time to find it now , but it should be easy enough to find on bugs.kde.org . 
  possibly . 
  i remember i 've seen duplicates , so it 's `` one of those '' !, 
  so ... you 're the `` king of the hill '' ? 
  si si . 
  it 's a different solution if i understand correctly . 
  by using priorities , you always favour some vendors and ** all ** of their packages ( which might be what you want ) , while by '' -- no-allow-vendor-change '' , you favour the original vendor of the installed package , not necessarily the one with highest priority ( which might be what you want ) . 
  importantly , `` dup -- no-allow-vendor-change '' ask you whether you want to change vendor , while `` dup '' with some configured priorities does not ( but warn you about it in the update summary ) .

  you ca n't do the `` shuffle my fucking library '' stuff easily with clementine . 
  just select ( translated back from french ) `` smart playlists  all tracks '' and put it in shuffle . 
  that 's what i do anyway , i do n't like to have to select a new album every 40 minutes or so ... 
   you make that sound more straightforward that it actually is . 
  not my intent . 
  i get your point , but it really is just a few clicks . 
  but if juk works for you , then go for it , pal !, 
  si , si , il y a eu un certain effacement de cultures r\u00e9gionales . 
  same problem here . 
  never found a way to fix this though , sorry ...

  greatly appreciated !,

  u/kupiqu is right . 
  kde neon is aimed at staying on ubuntu lts . 
  the `` lts '' for kde neon lts stands for plasma lts ( i.e. 
  plasma 5.8 ) , while the `` normal '' version is on the latest version of plasma ( i.e. 
  if you want your system to stay safe and robust , do not attempt to force its upgrade to 16.10 and above . 
  edit : you 'll find more information on this [ faq ] ( https://neon.kde.org/faq ), 
  since they release new isos regurlarly , it just makes sense that during april , they released an iso ... come back at the end of may , you 'll see there 's no 17.04 release anymore !, 
  a bit of warning : if you have a todo list in your agenda , this might trigger a [ memory leak ] ( https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367541 ) bug which render the feature useless ... 
  unfortunately , no fix seems to be on the way . 
  if you select a calendar which includes todo items to be displayed in the calendar plasmoid , then a bug is triggered fulling your ram in a matter of seconds . 
  if your todos are in a separate calendar than you can uncheck , you should be ok .

  i really do n't understand . 
  the aim of kubuntu is basically the same as ubuntu : to be simple , user-friendly . 
  yet , they still do n't have a package manager and discover is not given enough love ... 
  the review basically states that one has to use cli to install package . 
  this , precisely , is were kubuntu is failing in its role of a newbie-friendly distribution ( a shame , given newbie kde distro are scarce nowadays ... ) . 
  i know they 're lacking manpower , but if they really want to go down the discover road , they really ought to give it some love !, 
  or find a proper package manager ? 
  yes , but it 's not installed by default and was buggy last time i tried ( did n't tried on zesty , but the review is not mentioning muon , meaning it 's still not installed by default ... ), 
  a disclaimer : i did not test 17.04 , i 'm just getting my info from this review and my past personal experience with kubuntu , so i might have an outdated view on this issue . 
  here 's the problem for me : discover is n't super totally thorough yet and many software are lacking from its catalogue . 
  i 'm not talking about the stability of the software ( it was unstable , but i know it 's been working on ) . 
  for a long time ( i hope it 's now fixed , but given i 've seen issues not so long ago in the french ubuntu forum about it , i doubt it ) , muon could n't even be installed from discover . 
  not only that , but many people were frustrated not being able to install package `` xxx '' they 've been told to install to fix their issue . 
  for a long time , this resulted in us helpers in the forum telling them to use apt to install muon/synaptic or their package . 
  this should not be what kubuntu is about . 
  as you said it 's, 
   ment for `` people who should n't use a terminal to install stuff '', 
  i get what discover is about but :, 
  - it should be extremely thorough in how it 's populated in terms of software and some things ( say latex full , or even better , latex packages ) should be available through it . 
  - the state of packaging in gnu/linux is such that a package manager is still required nowadays and should be available directly through discover . 
  if all of these are fixed in 17.04 , then please feel free to correct me , but it 's not what i get from dedoimedo 's review . 
  it 's hard to tell people that kubuntu is user-friendly then say : `` oh , to install this , you need to open a terminal and ... '' . 
  i 'm not saying this to dismiss the hard work of the kubuntu ninjas , but out of love for this much needed user-friendly kde distro . 
  no problem . 
  i love how you 're always positive jens !, 
  well , you 're doing a great job then !, 
  the problem is that the neon team is not committing to support of non-kde software , as far as i know . 
  it 's their choice and consistent with the aim of their project , but not consistent with kde neon being a distro . 
  that being said , i still have n't heard of non-kde software being broken in neon . 
  a nice thing compared to debian for texlive is that there is ( not exactly , but roughly ) one binary package for each latex package . 
  this means you do n't have to `` guess '' in which binary package what you want to be installed is .
