  i wish you the best and hope you wo n't let those ignorant stupid teenagers reach you . 
  like poorscribbler says , you will be fine . 
  you are already awesome at 15 . 
  i know i linked it myself , 
  i think it is more accurate to say `` modern cigarette '' . 
  human have been smoking tobacco and other vegetals for centuries and even if it might cause health problems , i believe this is not comparable to modern cigarette . 
  * warning : i am in china , and thus my internet connexion is very limited . 
  i currently do not have acces to major websites like wikipedia , newspaper/scientific websites and my google searchs results are very often truncated . 
  what follows is the summary of my memories about that topic that i followed closely few years ago . 
  i am sorry if i get some figures wrong and i would be happy if anyone would provide sources . 
  also this is a very controversary topics so my reading might be one reading among other , but it has been supported by many scientific studies nonetheless . 
  in the 60s , philip morris was the smallest of the six cigarette producers in the us and rjr 's winston was selling three time better . 
  in 1978 marlboro took over the first place in sell palmares ( 20 % of global market was owned by marlboro and more than 50 % of 17 year old smoker and younger were opting for marlboro ) . 
  reverse engineering revealed that the presence of ammonia was responsible of such change . 
  philip morris started adding ammonia in 1965 and progressively raised the amount of ammonia added between 1965 and 1974 , which correspond to the period of great sell increase . 
  the other brands realised that and followed the same path . 
  experiments on mice compared two groups : both could trigger whenever they want an income of nicotine in theyr body simply pushing a button , but one group had nicotine mixed with ammonia . 
  mice could not change the amount of nicotine that was delivered , just the frequency of each injection . 
  the addiction was shown to be extremely faster and deeper with the ammonia group , where individuals quickly reached overdose and died while first ammoniac-free group was still at a stage of reasonable consomption ( i only have a very vague memory of what was the number but is was something like : ammoniac + nicotine group augmented its frequency of injection 18 times faster than ammoniac free group . 
  i remember seeing videos of those little guys turning hysterical and injecting non stop while ammoniac-free group was still at a farly low frequency of injection ) . 
  we are treated like fucking mice . 
  even if the first idea with ammonia was to soften the taste ( as for many other components in order to trick the body and reduce the sensation of irritation caused by inhaled smoke ) , the cigarettes producers have now perfectly understood its main role . 
  ammonia increases rate at which nicotine is absorbed and raises the addiction caused by it . 
  the `` sauce '' , ingredients added by producers to tobacco , is one of the only product on earth that crosses borders without being controled by customs , and it is forbiden today to study what cigarettes exactly contain , except for carbon monoxyde and nicotine . 
  the modern cigarette is the result of incredible amount of money invested in research to optimize the sell , and it go trhough increasing addiction and reducing the impression of discomfort when smoking . 
  cigarette has been found to be as addictive as heroin , cocaine or amphetamines , and for most of people more addictive than alcohol . 
  and of course if costs billions because of health treatment cost . 
  to me modern cigarette is one of the most harmfull invention ever . 
  ** 50 % of smokers die because of a disease due to smoking ** . 
  *** tl ; dr *** : modern cigarette is fully optimized to maximize addiction and trick the body to think it is ok to smoke that much . 
  the addictive effect is incredibly higher than it used to be only a few decades ago , it is now comparable to heroin or cocaine and was made on purpose by cigarette producers . 
  i do n't have access to youtube right now so all i can give you is a happy birthday wish , and an upvote !, 
  i still have my old 5110 . 
  i am keeping it because i know that one day , if i have to save the world , it will be thanks to it . 
  i admit my post is long but the tl ; dr looks really like something everyone know : modern cigarette is higly addictive . 
  i tried my best . 
  same producers , same rules i would say . 
  as i mentioned in my long post just [ below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/z7xpo/reddit_what_do_you_believe_to_be_the_worst/c62b45i ) , modern cigarette has little in common with traditional smoking . 
  modern cigarette is to smoking what fast food burgers are to burgers : full of chemicals to maximize addiction and reduce disconfort sensation that would naturally limit the amount people smoke . 
  it is clearly visible when you look at the sell results of different brands in the past . 
  i worked at thales alenia space , one of the biggest producer of satellites . 
  so i had the chance to see [ cleanrooms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cleanroom ) where they were building mirrors and electronic components , and at the end was ... a fully assembled , ready-to-launch satellite . 
  it was incredibly huge and massive . 
  most impressive piece of technology i have ever seen . 
  it is not a scumbag , there is 11 words . 
  wow is this serious ?!, 
  i do n't have access to google maps right now so i 'm gon na assume this is and that i learned something today . 
  also if you do n't have google maps with you when you 're at ikea , follow the signs on the floor !, 
  exactly !, 
  also , ceiling signs often give you information about shortcuts if you want to reach a section faster . 
  nope !, 
  you have shorcuts indicated on the ceiling signs !, 
  you can reach a given section much faster , including exit . 
  even in `` standard '' sexual fetishes , each person has a very personal mental wiring . 
  it is very hard to decrypt why we find sexually exciting the things that turn us on . 
  the mind has very often extremely surprising mechanisms . 
  the best to learn about it would not to ask somebody else - because as i said each person has a very different background - but maybe to talk to a therapist . 
  i am not saying you are sick or anything , just that to me this is the only way to learn about yourself . 
  but learning about other is nice too , 
  i gladly accept the compliment : $, 
  i take even more pride of my english when you see the average skill of french people at learning english . 
  i like english both for its efficiency and its elegance . 
  guys please , some of us are at work . 
  it does n't seem realistic to laugh my ass of at matlab code . 
  haha this is totally possible . 
  still off topic , i read several time that approximately ** 60 % ** of english words had french root . 
  it was actually not that hard to learn , especially when you are curious about the culture . 
  i remember being 8 and having final fantasy 7 help book completely written in english , i felt like an explorer having to describe ancient text to be able to progress in the game :d, 
  being in china , i can tell that they are the real heroes . 
  they language has absolutely nothing in common with ours , it is fascinating . 
  as a consequence of that , very few people speak fluent , or even approximative english !, 
  spanish is very useful too , i wish i had learned it during the year i spent in la , but i was too busy . 
  there is a misunderstanding . 
  i am french , in china just temporarily for my studies :p, 
  the chinese is a lie . 
  having not seen any episode of these shows , i 'm glad i still have things to look forward to . 
  at what moment in your life did you realize what it really consisted in ? 
  it took me a while to figure out the situation . 
  congratulation to you and your family !!, 
  i recently saw a 3 year old boy becoming my adopted brother and he already is 200 % family . 
  i wish you the best of what a family could offer , which is a lot !, 
  it can only end well . 
  upvote for you and woody op . 
  life can be hard , but it can also be beautiful . 
  depression is not easy to handle but everyone can find its way . 
  i recommand you talk to a therapist to try and see how you could improve your enjoyment of life . 
  there is much to enjoy beside those stupid fuck from school . 
  surprise you got 500 karma from nipple comment ? 
  never underestimate nipples . 
  smoking seems completely stupid when you look at how addictive the modern cigarette is . 
  i wrote a little wall of text about it in the topic of worst invention ever . 
  to me smoking is an important part of human culture and had been for an extremely long time . 
  but recent development of `` cigarette technology '' has gone too far . 
  as cigarette producers have the right to `` optimize '' their product , you have to have a way to fight back , with prevention and exhibition of the worst cases of smoker diseases . 
  sorry for copy pasta that follows but i found it very interesting to see how chemistry has allowed smoking to be turned into an extremely efficient market weapon :,
