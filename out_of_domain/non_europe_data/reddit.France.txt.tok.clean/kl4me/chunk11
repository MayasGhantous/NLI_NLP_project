  in the 60s , philip morris was the smallest of the six cigarette producers in the us and rjr 's winston was selling three time better . 
  in 1978 marlboro took over the first place in sell palmares ( 20 % of global market was owned by marlboro and more than 50 % of 17 year old smoker and younger were opting for marlboro ) . 
  reverse engineering revealed that the presence of ammonia was responsible of such change . 
  philip morris started adding ammonia in 1965 and progressively raised the amount of ammonia added between 1965 and 1974 , which correspond to the period of great sell increase . 
  the other brands realised that and followed the same path . 
  experiments on mice compared two groups : both could trigger whenever they want an income of nicotine in theyr body simply pushing a button , but one group had nicotine mixed with ammonia . 
  mice could not change the amount of nicotine that was delivered , just the frequency of each injection . 
  the addiction was shown to be extremely faster and deeper with the ammonia group , where individuals quickly reached overdose and died while first ammoniac-free group was still at a stage of reasonable consomption ( i only have a very vague memory of what was the number but is was something like : ammoniac + nicotine group augmented its frequency of injection 18 times faster than ammoniac free group . 
  i remember seeing videos of those little guys turning hysterical and injecting non stop while ammoniac-free group was still at a farly low frequency of injection ) . 
  we are treated like fucking mice . 
  even if the first idea with ammonia was to soften the taste ( as for many other components in order to trick the body and reduce the sensation of irritation caused by inhaled smoke ) , the cigarettes producers have now perfectly understood its main role . 
  ammonia increases rate at which nicotine is absorbed and raises the addiction caused by it . 
  the `` sauce '' , ingredients added by producers to tobacco , is one of the only product on earth that crosses borders without being controled by customs , and it is forbiden today to study what cigarettes exactly contain , except for carbon monoxyde and nicotine . 
  the modern cigarette is the result of incredible amount of money invested in research to optimize the sell , and it go trhough increasing addiction and reducing the impression of discomfort when smoking . 
  cigarette has been found to be as addictive as heroin , cocaine or amphetamines , and for most of people more addictive than alcohol . 
  and of course if costs billions because of health treatment cost . 
  to me modern cigarette is one of the most harmfull invention ever . 
  ** 50 % of smokers die because of a disease due to smoking ** . 
  *** tl ; dr *** : modern cigarette is fully optimized to maximize addiction and trick the body to think it is ok to smoke that much . 
  the addictive effect is incredibly higher than it used to be only a few decades ago , it is now comparable to heroin or cocaine and was made on purpose by cigarette producers . 
  `` ok , i 'll send you that paper '', 
  it is also very hard for me to listen to music without focusing , but i can manage . 
  also i tend so sing the music i 'm listening even if it is a fast guitar solo or a jazzy contrebasse line . 
  i think that 's one of the reason why i ca n't enjoy most of popular music today . 
  each instrument line is extremely simple and it get boring after few bars . 
  i also * feel * like the masked man from naruto 's birth attack is not obito . 
  to me , it it impossible that he trained and got so good in few years , specially when you see that he manages to put minato in difficulty . 
  my guess would be that the masked man this night is the one that trained tobi after . 
  they have similar techniques for this reason , but still feel like the two characters have a very different depth . 
  edit : also something crucial about tobi 's identity it that at naruto 's birth , the masked man wanted to use 9 tails to crush konoha . 
  there was nothing about putting the world at peace with a massive illusion . 
  to me this means that it ca n't be the same guy at that time and now . 
  thank you unseenpuppet for posting this !, 
  i discovered msg recently and loving to cook myself , i was pretty intrigued by the mystery that is around it . 
  after some research it appears fairly clearly that no case of proper crs have ever been clearly witnessed . 
  msg belongs in the safest category of food additives in western countries . 
  i explain that phobia simply with the fact that glutamate is not part of western gastronomy . 
  80 % of produced msg is used in asia , and asian gastronomy has been naturally using glutamate for ages . 
  the 20 % remaining are used in our western food industry , but industrials do n't brag about it as it is considered as `` cheating '' with the taste of the food . 
  glutamates triggers a fifth savors on the tongue , called * umami * in japanese . 
  in my whole childhood , no one ever mentioned the existence of that fifth type of papillae . 
  i just though there was sweet , salt , bitter and acid . 
  just this fact is to me significant of the trouble we have to include umami in our food culture . 
  you can find this information on one of the many websites focused on chapter release . 
  the standard release ti ; e is wednesday/thursday . 
  yes , to me zetsu has had a very important role in the story and we know very little about him . 
  he looks to me like a `` tool-being '' and i would bet on him actually being the messenger that carries on madara 's will , doing all the dirty work ( he eats corps , produces clones , gather information etc ) . 
  something interesting with zetsu is that he looks also looks like being two characters in one body . 
  the dark zetsu is smart and documented . 
  also , we never see him being destroyed . 
  his bright side is naive , stupid , got killed and replaced many times . 
  maybe he is the one that knows everything , being a priori the only character to have lived from madara 's time to present . 
  it does n't seem like it , you see him landing on the rocks neer tobito . 
  this could be coherent with emo sasuke being manipulated from the beginning . 
  i really hope tobito is being manipulated by his sensei because rin 's death would be an extremely disappointing leitmotiv for fucking up the whole world . 
  also i wonder if ( dark ) zetsu is not the one that knows everything . 
  he might play a role in this battle . 
  you can see the impact of his landing near obito and obito raising the arm to protect himself . 
  you also see bright lines drawn between the impact and the top right corner of this image that look like madara 's trajectory . 
  it seems pretty clear to me !, 
  well smashing a door on it could help ... 
  also , uchiha develop their eyes with great sentimental loss . 
  it means that necessarly , the powerful uchihas that come to play a role in the story all need to have come trhough that . 
  we still do n't know how madara exactly developed his rinnegan and even this event could be a key element in his plan . 
  it would be interesting to see sasuke develop the rinnegan too . 
  i hardly see how they could take out the duo obito/madara ( if they ally ! ), 
  without anyone with rinnegans to oppose them . 
  that could be achieved after sasuke talked to the one that knows everything . 
  it would also be coherent because after all , all rinegans we saw in action until now are actually madara 's eyes that have been passed over ( maybe nagato experienced something that made him able to control rinegan and obito only experienced that later ? ) . 
  that would bring back sasuke on stage with powers that could be comparable to naruto 's and tobi , wich is not the case currently i would say . 
  like orochimaru died ? 
  he would n't die just like that , and we did not see him `` dead '' . 
  we saw him pinched to the ground with a sword slicing him . 
  that is far from being enough to kill him i hope . 
  you 're talking about madaras ` rinnegan ? 
  he said himself he developed them shortly before his death . 
  i think kabuto is far from being able to give someone rinnegans . 
  my guess would be that after madara developed them , and after he died , obito transfered them on nagato . 
  1 ) there is absolutely no way to tell . 
  so yeah why not , but madara could have just left the fight sensing that 10 tails was being resurected, 
  2 ) it is pretty likely that madara used zetsu to help obito survive and trained him to look like him . 
  nope kamui appears to me like a unique power like we have seen a few ( i ca n't remember the name of the uchiha 's name whose eye got plugged on the hawk that itachi made naruto swallow ) . 
  thanks , that 's him . 
  so yeah as i said there are unique powers like shisui 's or obito 's , and also `` rare '' power that were not acquired by all ms owner like susano . 
  something that bothers me is : why did tobi not used the rinnegan directly on him , and waited for nagato to die before using madara 's rinnegan himself . 
  did he need to have yamato first maybe ? 
  and nagato would n't have required yamato 's cell because he would be related to senju or uzumaki ? 
  thanks !, 
  i randomly took a picture of my sister and her cat that loves climbing on her shoulders . 
  the pose happened to be perfect , 
  the thing is that after nagato 's death , tobi took the rinnegan back and put one on himself . 
  maybe he wanted to first sacrifice his right eye before replacing it with a rinnegan but that seems odd . 
  is there major differences between weed and hashish in term of chemical composition and effect ? 
  do you also work on hashish ? 
  yeah seriously , wtf ? 
  male and female bodies are wired completely differently . 
  i think that even simple genital rubbing feels just 100 % different for men and women . 
  and according to darioluigi , every erotic area is similarly active for men and women , and if not then i 'm weird ? 
  yeah ... 
  i hope you do n't have the same kind of generalized approach when it comes to female pleasure , you might be surprised .
