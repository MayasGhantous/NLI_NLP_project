  but you ca n't really expect both species to have the * same * understanding of time and space . 
  because if our cognitive functions differ just a little bit , our perception of nature could be significantly different , which has deep consequences on the way mathematical concepts are formed . 
  but what we call celerity and acceleration is deeply related to how we perceive space and time . 
  what of you had to explain it to intelligent being that would exist at a quantum scale for instance ? 
  i want to see this in big letters on a huge poster please . 
  i tried !, 
  source : http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/1znswd/singsing_first_blood_double_kill_vs_fnatic/, 
  i did . 
  it did n't go well \\ ^ \\ ^ ', 
  i wonder why it 's not discussed an an ethical problem the fact that you make almost all of your customers lie in order to cover you up with what terms and conditions include . 
  there obviously need to be a contract signed between people selling and people buying a product , but i wonder how we have reached the point where you ca n't use a product without accepting terms and conditions , yet it is not reasonable to expect people to read them ( like , some terms and conditions would require so much time and effort to understand that in some case i would consider not buying if it meant i had no choice but to read them ) . 
  in france , it is recognized as cult , which heavily implies people being manipulated for the organizers ' profit . 
  friends winrate , winrate history . 
  thank you so much !, 
  so , with spring coming , do you plan on seeing more friends and being the dragon that makes each barbecue unforgettable , or are you like allergic and will hide so you do n't sneeze fire on people ? 
  game is hard . 
  i just checked the isp i can subscribe to :, 
  the far right price is a promotion for the first year . 
  you can compare 1 $ for 1 $ given the price of life where i leave ( paris ) and the us . 
  all these offers include free land line , and some , tv . 
  i do n't know what the capacity is meant for ( maybe hd tv ) , there is no cap on any internet fiber or adsl service usually . 
  used to think you had to gg out of every pub game . 
  ended up getting a decent amount of abandons before making the connection . 
  i 'm surprised nobody gives any contact of his . 
  here is his facebook if you want to say a word . 
  have you tried chopotlo ? 
  \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 call singsing, 
  best is , it takes 15 min prep + 30 min in the oven ( including the time to make a homemade `` pate sablee '' dough ) and can be made with any kind of mix of cheese , meat and vegetable . 
  the future . 
  why not hide the name of the designer when voting for an item or set ? 
  that is the closest i have from a pony : https://imgur.com/a/hrnvm, 
  done , thanks . 
  well , a cow is closer to a pony than an alligator i guess . 
  i 've heard some snakes can travel through water pipes . 
  dear mr deku stick ,, 
  first , thank you for doing this ama . 
  you have many times proven to be irreplaceable and i consider yourself as a key tool in linc 's equipment . 
  however , and i think an item of such importance like yours would expect such question , i would like you to comment on the infamous deku stick glitch.http : / / zeldawiki.org/glitches_in_ocarina_of_time#infinite_deku_stick_glitch . 
  many people expect from a tool like you to be extremely reliable , however this shows the unpredictable aspect of your personality . 
  what can you say about it ? 
  best is , i 'm sure it 's not the worst it can do . 
  also , we at / r/dota2 are extensively discussing about it . 
  you can find the [ official discussion thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/20thek/free_to_play_the_movie_discussion_thread/ ) as well as a [ guide for the global launch ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/20t2n0/survival_guide_free_to_play_global_launch_in/ ) . 
  more than technically . 
  it is completely balanced , the picking phase being symmetric . 
  but it 's not adapted to smart or refined picks . 
  yep , not giving you credit for such a recent post is not very fair . 
  i 'd rather assume that we all have access to the internet , and thus google . 
  it takes so much more time to type your angry , self-centered comment rather than google what a barcraft is . 
  you do n't even need to click any answer , you can read the wikipedia definition from the search results page . 
  also , the title implies the situation can be compared to china . 
  it just absolutely can not . 
  free public transportation and half cars banned , yes . 
  '' \\ - you hair stinks !, 
  \\ - i have n't showered in two days , sorry . 
  yesterday i farted the whole day , it must have polluted my hair . '', 
  it 's also called hit and run , or stutter step . 
  here 's a good example on why it matters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mouvlhvtv6u, 
  zerglings are significantly faster than marines but the same principle applies between heroes in dota 2 , when you need to move while attacking to stay in position . 
  i 've got to disagree on this . 
  the christian religion is so deeply mixed in the us state and society , it 's really impressive from an european point of view . 
  completely comparable to some other countries with islam . 
  it remains the same for the 40 % that do n't believe in evolution . 
  it 's even more worrying while you know that this is a scientifically proven process and not some more subjective social or philosophical consideration ( like gay right or abortion ) . 
  you do n't have to hit arrow , to hit arrow . 
  but i would not consider a game where you have to be more wary of any spell `` dull '' . 
  yeah , not in a team game . 
  if wd wastes his mekansm because he does n't know it wo n't heal if you are affected by aa 's ult , you have to tell him . 
  keep in mind that you can unpause without waiting if someone from your own team paused . 
  last time , a guy would resume without waiting while one of us was having troubles with steam . 
  all the enemy team agreed to wait but one . 
  after he resumed our 4 pauses , his own teammates would pause but he would n't wait and resume them instantly . 
  the problem is having such unstable servers with the current pause system . 
  it would be fine if we had one person dropping every few game , but in the last weeks it has been more like a few person dropping every game . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 're here to talk about dota , and not fermander 's whole life story . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the same to waste mana for voodoo restoration or the mana + timer on the mek . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure i was only giving an example where you ca n't just expect people to leave you alone when you do mistake and they depend on you , and my initial point remains entirely valid . 
  and i 'm pretty sure there is not even any way to tell if he used his spell or his mek from the screenshot only . 
  so thanks for giving inappropriate advices ? 
  [ relevant xkcd . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/563/ ), 
  also it feels nice to hear genuine positive appreciation for the game . 
  we all know here why we love the game but spend more time talking about problems you encounter with it or teammates . 
  yeah it happens to me with every competitive game i invest myself in . 
  but regularly you have these moment of pure beauty , when both teams throw their combos and fight mercilessly . 
  then , only blood matters , and you feel the same rush of adrenaline that you got when you used to a-move in the teamfight with your drow quadruple wraith-band . 
  the problem is that you can not expect a normal person to read all these terms and conditions . 
  pushing everyone to not read them and lie when declaring they did read and accept them is not a fair system . 
  why is n't valve already communicating about this ? 
  the servers has been so unstable these last weeks , i ca n't count the number of pro games with thousands of viewers that got canceled because of valve servers , not to mention that everyone gets his game/session ruined occasionally when the want to play . 
  i do n't understand how the health of your server is something you can let go so badly for so long , without fixing nor communicating about the solution you are deploying . 
  fucking global server potato . 
  we have server problems every week several times a week , sometimes several times a day in eu too . 
  i just opened a ticket here . 
  https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php it 's just unbearable to have so much of your time wasted , with absolutely no news nor reaction from valve . 
  i secretly hope for heroes of the strom to be used as preparation for w4 . 
  i 've heard that he would make his crew listen to his acapela beatbox/overdub recordings of his songs to make them hear they way he had it in mind . 
  i 'd say no , she is not autonomous , she needs teammates to apply her dps . 
  she is just a glass canon , with a single disable that usually is used more to chase . 
  she wo n't be the unexpected hero that turns a whole fight around by dishing out her combo .
