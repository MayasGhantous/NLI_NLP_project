  you assume this behavior is rational and calculated , but it could very well not be . 
  depressed people can be very interested by the perspective of a plan and when the time comes , symptoms rise up and you forget about your social commitments , eventhough you think you should n't . 
  that being said , i ca n't stand this behavior neither , but i wanted to say it 's not necessarily rational and calculated . 
  i said that being depressed would make you give up about socializing even though you think you should n't , implying that they are perfectly aware that it would annoy/hurt people and regret it . 
  i 'm not sure you realize what depression symptoms are , because you do n't get over it `` just with a phone call '' . 
  i do n't know why you assume they have no remorse , op never implied that . 
  feeding is bad and you should never do it , but what the fuck was this cm thinking ? 
  i ` va had to contest farm as gyro , being in lane with a russian treant that did n't say a world the whole game and rushed radiance . 
  we straight up lose , because i had to go jungle lvl 5 with no prior farm and my team virtually had to play 3v5 , with me being useless and treant ignoring teamplay . 
  feeding ruins the game , but fucking up a carry 's farm as a hard support that can jungle efficiently would infuriate me . 
  it 's a fairly large consensus that sitting all day at a desk fuck up your body . 
  it increases cardiovascular diseases risk , cancer risk , and all sort of pathologies that follow when you just do n't move for like 75 % of your day ( when you include the sleeping time ) . 
  also , copying/paste an article without quotes is pretty bad , especially when you end up saying htat you talked about it with a professor . 
  well you can find 1v1 games as well as all pick at least , so not all game are all picks . 
  as someone with a thin coat of soft fur on the chest , it 's conforting . 
  today you see adds about shower gel that you can also use to shave your chest hair , like it 's something systematic and male models are usually shaved . 
  i ca n't imagine how itchy it would feel when my chest hairs would grow back . 
  agreed , it seems natural and should be fixed soon i guess . 
  no , but after division , you can use an eidolon to create 3 new eidolon . 
  it 's not that badly worded , and it 's not easy to present a statistical study in a clear and well formulated way . 
  i work with scientists , writting papers , and explaining your experiment can be as hard as the experiment itself . 
  yeah your usage of skewness is actually correct . 
  skewness = long tail in a distribution . 
  it is said to be skewd in the direction of the heavy tail . 
  what a shitty comment . 
  come on , give the guy a break , he put some time and effort and produced a very decent paper . 
  clearly , there must be a huge proportion of people in the lower half of mmr that do n't follow pro scene and/or dedicated websites , and do n't follow the meta ( in the most general way , everything outside the game ) . 
  you have to have a decent level of dedication to go online and learn about a game on forums like / r/dota2 . 
  my `` lower half '' was an arbitrary choice , a better way to say it is that the lower the mmr , the smaller the chance is that they follow dedicated websites . 
  it 's already significantly more frequent than last week apparently . 
  he refused the opportunity to cast , but never meant that he would n't go at all . 
  even if he did n't say it explicitely , there is no reason to assume he would n't go at all . 
  to be fair , you can feel and look at 100 % or even at 200 % when you are outside of anxiety attacks , but still remain vulnerable . 
  to be honnest i know nothing about draskyl 's financial situation , but is n't he technically out of work untill other tournaments resume ? 
  is that equivalent to a 5000 $ / month salary ? 
  well , we 're ~ ~ one of ~ ~ the mots touristic country in the world so there must be a few things that make our general grumpyness bearable !, 
  edit : this is smix from 2012 . 
  i liked the picture . 
  it 's a nice picture . 
  i would like to seize op 's post opportunity to make a psa to all the banana lovers on reddit : you were endoctrinated as child , and never learn the proper way to peel bananas . 
  yes the decoloration is due to the swelling . 
  the blood is under pressure inside blood vessels , and there ca n't be a `` bit of blood '' eaten by the mosquito that would leave a blank space . 
  the blood flows inside the vessels , and the swelling appears where the mosquito punctured the vessel . 
  i 'm pretty sure mosquitoes would n't go for the blood inside a bruise , precisely because that blood is not flowing and probably started to coagulate . 
  mosquitoes would want fresh , flowing blood from a vessel . 
  so ... smart ? 
  you knew about [ funn1k 's nyx assassin ] ( http://imgur.com/bxdntoq ) ? 
  well now you know about [ sheever 's tidehunter ] ( http://imgur.com/1edindw ) . 
  woopsie , indeed it is . 
  who would be the one playing it ? 
  yes i could see wex invoker or earthshaker interrupt combos easily . 
  biblethump, 
  i 'd say the second definition applies here : * `` having many girls , being a mansion , swagging to the maximum , and looking like jesus . 
  you bring your sick child to the hospital : `` oh sorry we ca n't cure him , but we 're keeping him with us '' . 
  oh they can have different opinions , just makes them inhuman . 
  well , they are dressed as superman and are jumping over fire . 
  could be worse . 
  do you mean that linux is to be included as a pc-architecture os like windows ? 
  whoopsie , corrected . 
  not a native speaker and those two are easy to mess up on . 
  i know , i was at around +20 -30 points until we hit americans time zone . 
  well , you do spend four times less than germany and three time less than uk per capita for international tourism for instance ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#international_tourism_expenditure_in_2013 ) . 
  i have lived a year in la and am not judging from reddit comments only . 
  but it shows even on reddit that you do n't have the same opening to the international , culturaly speaking , than countries of comparable wealth . 
  well obviously his prediction will magically change depending on the match . 
  notre very fair coming from a wizard if you ask me . 
  bruno 's magic confuses everyone . 
  thanks for the links .

  i was n't around at the time , but the most frustrating aspect of ti4 finals was that none of the team had any backup plan . 
  it looked like four 10 minutes timing all in games where there was absolutely no way to catch up if the one or two first engagements go wrong .

  just pick a hero and you 'll get a huge list of vods with tags describing the type of game . 
  i was randomly going through sing 's past broadcasts and found one starting with a game when he is randomly teamed up with ee !, 
  hex must be skilled at level 1 or 2 , not later . 
  the instant 2.5 sec disable is much better to have to set up ganks and is a must have that is much better than a second point in spike or the first point in mana drain .
