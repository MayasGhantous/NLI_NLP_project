  i am giving highschool lesson to a student and they bluntly introduce sine and cosine as ratio of lengths in a rectangle triangle . 
  it makes no sense and it makes the formula hard to remember , and the circle is n't mention anywhere in the chapter . 
  no , because latency is the same going from your computer to the server than the opposite . 
  so console ping just yields twice the latency that ingame - ping outputs . 
  it is not faster to reach the server from your computer than your computer from the server . 
  we are talking about network latency , not the processing ability , and the speed of information once it is emitted only depends on the path it takes to reach its target , and the time it takes does n't depend on the way it is traveling . 
  it is completely the same things . 
  different framework are more natural to different people , and the historical order in which things are introduced is neither a justification of which explaination is more direct , or more natural . 
  an argument in favor of the unit circle explaination is that it does n't rely on ratio nor on the particular case of a rectangle triangle . 
  the definition of the sine and cosine feels more straightforward becase they can be read simply as coordinates . 
  simple geometry is often prefered by people to algebra formula . 
  but more importantly it shows why these function can be seen as 2pi-periodic and is adapted to the use of trigonometric functions in the complex space ( both not very important at a highshool level ) . 
  you can start with the unit circle , and the sine and cosine as coordinates ( x , y ) of a point of the circle defined with the angle the point makes with the origin . 
  you only need the euclidian distance ( the distance you are used ) to define the circle and have the classic x \u00b2 + y \u00b2 = 1 formula ( which is just writing the fact that your point of coordinates ( x , y ) is on the unit circle ) ; you recognize the relation sin \u00b2 + cos \u00b2 = 1 . 
  for a rectangle triangle with a hypotenuse = / = 1 , you can go back to the unit case by dividing by the length of the hypotenuse , which yields the usual sin = x/hyp and cos = y/hyp . 
  so it does n't have to rely on the ratio inside a triangle . 
  you can shrink the problem to make it fit to the unit case and see sine and cosine as pure coordinates . 
  what i have done to solve this is start the match in dotatv and put the twich stream sound in background . 
  you can now delay the live match in dotatv to make it sync with the twitch stream . 
  it 's fairly easy and pretty efficient . 
  why are you sad , did n't you read the picture ? 
  this is fine . 
  nice work !, 
  what data do you exactly use to compute your stats ? 
  but when she is off tho : <, 
  so , are we on an odd or even day for you ? 
  * you see jimmy , this was the only way to start an engine car in my days . 
  a single note out of beat and you had to start all over . 
  '' ... my old school friend 's girlfriend uncle was one and ... '', 
  madmau5 was just saying thay when you have a group of unit selected , tab only allows you to change the unit of which you can use the spells of and does n't allow individual micro . 
  it 's 100 % true . 
  it 's extremely easy to understand that he was talking about this case : virtually all rts allow tabbing through a selected control group of units . 
  `` i ca n't beleive i have to explain that to you '' , to use your way of saying . 
  people have different understandings online . 
  look at you , strugling to understand what madmau5 said . 
  yeah , and watch out for those nasty viruses . 
  some even download gigabytes of porn without your knowing !, 
  hopefully with some fetishes you enjoy . 
  it 's not : `` potential health risks have been examined and dismissed by numerous scientific research projects . 
  with the exception of the risk to those with phenylketonuria , aspartame is considered to be a safe food additive by governments , worldwide , and major health and food safety organizations . '', 
  `` dude , i just fished paying it . 
  i even took the pure blonde dog fur furnitures option . '',

  i am not lying http://www.reddit.com/user/kl4me/comments/?sort=top, 
  i know it sounds like / u/denelf is being carried by his team , but i think it 's possible to be in his situation without being carried by a stack . 
  i have over [ 75 % with my 5 stack ] ( http://www.dotabuff.com/teams/405106 ) but i hover around 50-55 % winrate in normal games , even in ranked , even in captain 's mode . 
  and in my team , i play mid and usually carry the game as much as our 1 position . 
  our team mmr is similar to my party mmr ( and probably my hidden mmr too ) . 
  now i almost only play unranked when not playing as 5 , and almost do n't play anymore at all if we are not 5 together , which happens a couple hours a week . 
  is n't it related to the same phase movement mechanics that allows someone to exit a chrono if under phase when activated + void standing on the same tile as the phased hero ? 
  get very low hp , blink in , sunder , dagon . 
  this looks foolproof to me . 
  clearly the point is not to know if you have enough mana for it but rather how much many will you have left after using it . 
  or just drop a single bomb in any jungle camp which is n't tomato/potato . 
  there is absolutely no reason russians would be the only one to abuse that . 
  everybody is going to abuse it with a smurf + 4 accounts being boosted . 
  posting this because i freacking love the theme :, 
  definitely , the pronominal form is more something you would see in a text written in old french , or in litterature . 
  une `` connaissance '' can both be an acquaintance ( or something you are familiar with like a city ) , or a piece of your knowledge . 
  `` knowledge '' can actually be translated into both connaissance et savoir . 
  so you can say `` je connais cette th\u00e9orie '' when talking about a scientific theory for instance , as in `` i know [ about ] this theory '' . 
  but it is true that you use savoir when you know a fact , and you use connaitre when you know a thing/person/entity , / u/ozark is [ spot on ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/french/comments/2la9jk/eli5_le_difference_entre_les_mots_savoir_et/cltmduy ) . 
  oh wow , been going there for a while , never thought i 'd meet the one !, 
  i really doubt you will now like it . 
  the targeting and fighting system did n't change . 
  you can now manually change the horizontal direction of your ship but this is a really small part of the piloting . 
  that 's actually what eve succeed to do very well . 
  they attracted a relatively small but very attached population that would be ready to invest a lot in a very original game . 
  you are the fucking dumbass if you beleive everything you read on the web without source . 
  do you mean for already developed cosmectics , or for future cosmetics ? 
  it 's a nice comment , a bit overated in my opinion . 
  but defenitely okay to be in a top comment selection !, 
  to say that it is one of the best comments etc is really exageration , it was posted like 10 times in a high level thread , you need way more to compare him to vargas 's , unidan 's or karmanaut 's . 
  dude this is a great reason to get back in shape . 
  not only the super hero part , but seeing parents put effort toward physical shape is huge for children , i think it 's one of the best example you could give . 
  really has a flavor of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnsdc7ctpuu, 
  can you give any justification for that ? 
  because that is not what happens in any western country . 
  you can get drugs and prostitues relatively easily in many western countries , yet not everybody runs around with illegal weapons . 
  there really is no justification in saying that because people can acquire drugs or prostitutes illegally , then gun control can not be enforced . 
  it 's like saying : `` some crimes can be committed , so any crime can be committed , so all law are useless '' . 
  once again you have to realize that hundreds millions of people from countries with similar wealth and education than the us and live much safer with guns being strictly controlled . 
  it 's impressive how much denial you are showing . 
  you imply that strict control on guns would only lead to less guns in the hands of civilians but that thugs would be comparatively equiped as if there was no control ? 
  it 's not a matter of history or cold war or whatever , it 's a matter of disentangling variables . 
  of course your thugs have access to large quantities of high quality weapons , they are everywhere in the us . 
  how can you not accept the fact that other countries manage to be much safer without having to allow everyone to carry firearms ? 
  do you think the safest everyone could be would be if any citizen on earth had a button to activate a global nuke ? 
  you need to sort your weapon lobby problem , it 's costing you so much it feels like . 
  would n't there be a way to ingest food even faster ? 
  maybe directly eating with our asses ? 
  / u/nepharan is giving the best answer to a question which is not clearly enough stated to begin with . 
  `` calling axes '' is not mathematically precise enough , so / u/nepharan answered for different possibilities , assuming that `` naming an axis x or y '' meant that each axis would represent the real part of a number while the `` axis nammed i '' would have to represent the imaginary part of a complex number . 
  so , / u/nepharan 's answer is correct : there are many ways to represent data with three axes , where two represent real variable , and the third represents an imaginary part . 
  the examples he gave are very valid . 
  you could also understand the question as : `` can you extend the 2d plane to a higher dimensional space the same way you go from r to the complexe space by adding an imaginary axis ? '', 
  adding the imaginary dimension to the space of real numbers yields interesting properties , when defining the operations the way we do with complexe numbers like the multiplication ( x1 , y1 ) * ( x2 , y2 ) = ( x1x2 - y1y2 , x1y2 + y1x2 ) ( which is multiplying x1 + iy1 by x2 + iy2 ) . 
  the definition of these operations are the reason why the complexe plane is so useful . 
  the imaginary axis has been designed as a second dimension , and the meaning of the complexe plane comes from the way alebric operations entangles its two dimensions . 
  the space op wants to extend does n't have the same product as the space of real number does .
