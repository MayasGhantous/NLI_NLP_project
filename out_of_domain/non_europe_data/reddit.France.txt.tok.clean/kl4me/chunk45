  i do n't know if my fresh vegetable seller is a futur islamist warrior that will grab his rpg from bellow his counter and go blow shit up , but so far he 's been nice , sympathetic and offered me a free fresh pineapple . 
  the rest is your imagination filling the blanks . 
  and this , some media or politics can play on . 
  well , i hope you are wrong , not for the sake of my argument of course . 
  what i would suggest is to focus on the strategic aspects of what happens ( who is served by agitating france , who is defending or attacking whos interest etc ) because i find it often more meaningful than the religious explaination when talking about large scale conflicts . 
  if i might ask , how did you personally deal with the teaching of views that felt extreme or just inappropriate to you ? 
  i did n't at all . 
  it must be some people disagreeing with comparing `` vote-whoring extreme political parties '' to `` republicans '' which is arguably a big shortcut that you took . 
  republicans and democrates both did equally show grief for the attack and would n't call for anything else but compassion and unity . 
  for your defense , due to the reduced party diversity in the us , the two main ones are more spread on the political spectrum than european ones . 
  what i mean by that is that dems and reps might have a bit more vote from the extremes than moderate parties in europe where there are stronger extreme parties to vote for . 
  [ am i doing this right ? 
  france could give better education to poorer social classes ( where muslim and other minorities are over-represented ) . 
  this is about national reform of our educative system , but something can definitely be done to improve . 
  it will prevent some tragedies of this sort . 
  roughly put , education allows individual to have critical thinking , which defeats many kinds of fanatism . 
  when you know history , know about the global game of diplomacy and conflicts , have access to reliable information and are free to gather and discuss and vote with the rest of the population , you lose the need to have violent action to necessarily have your voice heard . 
  sebum os also repulsive for lice and is secreted in much larger quantity by adults head skin . 
  well , like the representative of french muslim associations said earlier today on bfmtv , `` we do n't live in the saudi arabia of 700 ad '' . 
  i play unranked regularly so i should have a stable unranked hidden mmr but since end of december wy winrate has plummeted from 55-65 % to 25 % too . 
  last ( and only ) time fn was at second round of presidential elections , the challenger ( chirac at the time ) got the highest score of any president of the current fifth republic . 
  this story where muslims as well as every other french show they do not support these actions precisely shows that it is not about personal beliefs and religion and actually works against her propaganda . 
  prepare for punishment ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  for those having doubts , this guy has been condemned for various things he said . 
  he is being handled as firmly as people having hate-inciting speech against other minorities . 
  he started doing political stuff a little while after falling off as a standup . 
  as huge as releasing a new engine and porting great games like dota 2 on it is , i think it 's a mistake not to have perfected the menues a long time ago . 
  why am i so good , tude ? 
  i prefer the explaination of the power function p defined for any real p and any x in r ^ + * as fp : x -  x ^ p definied as x ^ p = e ^ p * ln ( x ) , that only relies on the exponential function . 
  this directly dictates all the laws for the power functions we are used to . 
  this function coincides with the usual power functions : for p = 2 and n integer , n ^ p = f2 ( n ) = e ^ 2 * ln ( n ) = e ^ ln ( n ) ^ ^ 2 = n ^ 2 . 
  you see immediately that if p = 0 , for any x in r ^ + * , x ^ 0 = e ^ 0 * ln ( x ) = exp ( 0 ) = 1 . 
  however , you ca n't deduce the value of 0 ^ 0 , as ( x , p ) -  p * ln ( x ) does n't admit a limit in ( 0,0 ) . 
  i ca n't really prove it as it is actually in the definition of the exponential function . 
  the notation exp ( x ) = e ^ x is a shortcut that can be extended to integers given these definitions . 
  exp ( 0 ) = 1 is , if i recall properly , a direct consequence of the fact that exp is defined as the solution of f ' = f that verifies f ( 0 ) = 1 . 
  this is why i did not wrtie e ^ 0 = 1 but exp ( 0 ) = 1 . 
  the lyrics are actually much longer , and just the first verse is usually sang . 
  here is the full lyrics with translation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_marseillaise#lyrics . 
  got a g19 maybe 6 or 7 years ago and now i 'm thinking about replacing it with a g910 . 
  the g19 is still working but it 's actually a bit large for my desk now that i have a g13 for custom keys . 
  this is by far the best option if you cant get a perfect result yourself , and actually many people that know a lot about computer do n't know enough to have a clean sound processing . 
  you ca n't say it 's schizophrenia in particular , but hallucinations do happen yeah , and make the best explaination of so many werid things people say they have seen or heard . 
  i really love it . 
  the formalism behind it is so britishly elegant , i wish we had more of that in frogland . 
  people with no mercy . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  is there any chance you add a profile for the m50 ? 
  he told you , experimenting and learning . 
  you could read / u/sleeplessinoslo 's first post , he gives elements he disagrees on .

  i am in the same situation as you : i just switched to hotas after starting playing with a mouse and keyboard . 
  the enhanced stick precision system helps quite a lot , but i feel like it is mostly changing the way you pilot your ship that will help you get back closer to the level of accuracy you had with k+m . 
  indeed , you tend to forget about your trajectories when aiming with a mouse , but once you have adapted to the stick flight it becomes easier and easier to land hits on a target , because your aim is linked more tightly to your movement . 
  i contacted them and let them know that they should n't give credit to people who do n't care about facts and medical studies https://reuters.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new, 
  yes . 
  i find so naive the way many approach this topic . 
  `` islam is a violent religion '' seems such an uneducated statement when you know about history and how you can not discriminate any of the three main monotheist religion by violence purely by their books .

  is the image definitely not enough quality , or can i submit it again with a more descriptive title ? 
  i 've got ta plug [ imgur uploader ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imgur-uploader/hgmpmjpekinnebjgnakcahjikbomnmlb ) that allows you to rehost on imgur via a simple right clic on any image . 
  directly takes you to the uploaded imgur page , really nice . 
  can someone explain why ? 
  i know every infrastructure has a cost , but would n't it be worth it to have a small server in us/eu/asia dedicated to pro tornaments ? 
  i feel like the pause time saved would be worth it . 
  i 'm not sure it 's tour tinnitus . 
  i 've had the same hd497 for maybe 12 years now , have replaced every single part but tue back of the ears , and it sounds better than some new headsets some friends buy today for the price i got it at thetime i bought it .

  although he might not have meant all this , gabe did say something about nice players being rewarded ingame :, 
   `` an example is -- and this is something as an industry we should be doing better -- is charging customers based on how much fun they are to play with . 
  `` so , in practice , a really likable person in our community should get dota 2 for free , because of past behaviour in team fortress 2 . 
  now , a real jerk that annoys everyone , they can still play , but a game is full price and they have to pay an extra hundred dollars if they want voice . '', 
  it appears valve is putting this plan , or a similar initiative , into action . 
  he told seven day cooldown : `` we 're trying to figure out ways so that people who are more valuable to everybody else [ are ] recognized and accommodated . 
  we all know people where if they 're playing we want to play , and there are other people where if they 're playing we would [ rather ] be on the other side of the planet .
