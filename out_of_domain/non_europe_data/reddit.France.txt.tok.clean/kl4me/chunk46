  pretty sure you can poof on a meepo that is under the effect of euls , banishment , being cycloned or torrented or other similar spells .

  i 'm not so lucky . 
  i 'm in france with maybe the fastest internet connexion you can get without being a big institution ( i usually have between 5 and 30 ms ping on european servers on various games ) , and for a couple of months we 've had troubles with euw every sunday evening when we played our league matches with my team . 
  lag spikes , losing connection , packet loss , etc. 
  same , seeding with ~ ~ 1 gbps ~ ~ 200 mbps here !, 
  i 'll probably let the computer upload the whole weekend . 
  that 's my case . 
  it is totally out of the question for me to grind anything in a pre-alpha version of a game i co-fund . 
  i am okay with testing progression path for gear or other equipement , but not if i have to grind it . 
  the system should be generous to push players to test it . 
  i 'm actually from france !, 
  and my upload speed is 200 mbps not 1 gbps like i initialy said . 
  the situation in the states in quite shoking . 
  my provider offers me basic tv ( a few dozain channels including national tv , no hd ) , unlimited text and voice ( including international for maybe 60 countries ) on my cell phone + 3g limited at something like 4 gb per month + 1gpbs/200 mbps fiber internet without cap for a total of 45 $ / month . 
  it 's a good deal because i have a discount for my age ( in my late twenties ) and because i combine cell phone and adsl , but yeah you get the point . 
  the regular price for a fibre box would be [ 30 $ / month ] ( https://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sfr.fr%2fbox-internet%2foffres-box-tv-fibre%2f&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  we have ad better prices than the us for a while , since free arrived on the market . 
  they pushed so much the market around that it allowed many very agressive offers to emmerge . 
  it forced the three big providers ( france telecom/orange , sfr and bouygues ) to aligne their prices and services . 
  free ( iliad ) made the first tv/phone/adsl box and imposed the 30 $ monthly fee as a standard , and they were the one destroying prices when arriving on the mobile market . 
  now we can get 15 $ / month for a full cell phone line when already paying for a box at many providers . 
  the only reason i switched to another provider was that they gave up on spreading fiber . 
  i had 5 different offers for fiber ( from 200-5 to 1000-200mbps ) and they were the only one missing after several years already . 
  but i bless them everytime i think about how little i pay for such essential services . 
  the three big ones since [ have been fined ] ( http://www.cellular-news.com/story/15060.php ) for unfair price fixing , and the market is much healthier than the horror we hear about in the us .

  well for rosh it 's actually even worse , he ** drops ** his aegis when he dies .

  you got to give it to op , the interface is shit . 
  when you clic on the hero , it quietly changes the list of games displayed in the window * behind * the hero list and nothing obviously shows that the data has changed on your active window . 
  it 's odd that you have to rely so much on external websites like http://dotabuff.com and http://yasp.co to access data from your profile . 
  \u30fd ( \uff3e \u25e1 \uff3e ) \uff89 that 's why it helps to be oblivious , you never stop raising !, 
  \u30fd ( ) \uff89 i raise , i raise ... and feel the souls of a thousand of moderinos getting fucked \u30fd ( ) \uff89,

  i think valve has the best tools to make extracting data from game easy and can give much more robust statistics tools than what third parties can offer . 
  while i agree on the fact that valve seems to struggle with ui in dota 2 , it should be very easy to process user stats to display things like average last hits for a given hero in a given mode for instance , or computing your kda for captains mode over a given period of time , etc. 
  it 's not a problem to have to rely on third party websites . 
  even with games where i do n't have anything to say about the ui or the data available ingame , many websites offer a different ergonomy or simply represent the data differently and come as a complementary ressources to the main client . 
  my complain is mostly for all this data left unused , and seemingly easily available . 
  the biggest limitation of third party websites is that they are third party and can only access what valves puts as available through api ( i might be talking out of my ass , but if it 's not only what 's available through api , it still is data valve has to actively put at the disposal of third party websites ) . 
  valve has all the inhouse tools and no problem of data confidentiality and could use anything it could think of , because the tools would be completely integrated in the user 's profile and remain private anyways . 
  i want to know how many times i 've used viper strike in total damnit !, 
  \u0b67 \u0361 \u25c9 \u0644\u035c \u0361 \u25c9 \u0b68 this is the only proper answer to anti-raising \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68, 
  i was playing with a mouse and [ g13 ] ( http://gaming.logitech.com/fr-fr/product/g13-advanced-gameboard ) which has a thumb joystick . 
  i very recently replaced this setup with a warthog flight stick and a ch throttle . 
  as / u/chitect says , aiming weapons with a single thumb on a joystick is very hard if you have to maintain ship direction with your other hand simultaneously . 
  i have tried to aim both with my left thumb on my g13 or the throttle thumbstick and i prefer to use only my left hand to aim . 
  \u1559 \u25d5 \u0644\u035c \u25d5 \u1557 no problem friend , we 've got enough raised dongers for everyone \u1559 \u25d5 \u0644\u035c \u25d5 \u1557, 
  thank you for saving my one clic everytime i start dota , seriously . 
  \u3064 \u21e7 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 \u21e7 you have to channel your upper force to your dongers .

  edit : if people really think vhs quality looks like op 's second video , you should watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ebaysw49uy and realize that it is jpeg video compression that fucked up the quality of the second link . 
  nope , you can clearly see the blocks from the tiling of jpeg compression that has nothing to do with vhs . 
  here is a vhs video looking much better with much less jpeg compression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ebaysw49uy, 
  pleas tell me how the block artifacts we see in the second video are typical fom vhs and not the tiling done on an image before applying a local discrete cosine transform that is central in the jpeg compression . 
  but hey , you can have an opinion that disregards an obvious example of a properly compressed vhs video as well as the science behind what you 're talking about . 
  be wary though , as trying to make other shut up while expressing it make you appear like an immense twat . 
  i completely agree , i find very important information like patch notes or release dates hard to find . 
  i do n't have an obvious but it can take a lot of time to find information that should be easily available . 
  yeah , left me speechless . 
  yup , what the graph shows is that the surge of interest in cm died out at the same pace it rose up . 
  in france , our president has very strong powers since the 5th republic and is a strong symbol of concentration of authority in one person 's hand . 
  granted , people disagree on politics , but we all agree on the rules that tell us to respect how our total votes amount . 
  our democratic system still allows a strong figure leading the state to emerge . 
  a key difference between democratic and non democratic countries is concentration and mode of exploitation of resources . 
  in countries where the power in charge has total control over a huge proportion of the economical resources of the country , it is much more likely to see a biased redistribution . 
  the french revolution mostly happened to allow bourgeois to organise the economy of the country , they got rid of the centralized tax system organized by the monarchy . 
  symbolically , the state was now lead by a citizen chosen by all other citizens that pled allegiance to the land , instead of having a holly figure chosen by god which the people serve . 
  but the main aspect of the french revolution and transition to a democratic state is mostly economic to me . 
  i know some inequalities of wealth exist in democratic countries but they do not have the same explanation . 
  do you always use a passive aggressive tone to passively assess your opinion ? 
  or did you think that this ama was a particularly good occasion ? 
  agreed , this is the first step when you receive something like a home in a country where you feel well , be grateful and humble for what you have . 
  but the next step is to make it better !, 
  or at least , question your environment and try and put in perspective . 
  how could it be modified , what could be ( even ) better , and of course in the end how can * you * make it better in any way . 
  you can question some things without disrespecting them and i do n't think laws should be out of the question .
