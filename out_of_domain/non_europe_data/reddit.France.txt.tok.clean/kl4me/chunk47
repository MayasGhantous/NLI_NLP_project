  in the bag . 
  thank you . 
  i recommend anyone interested by economy in an mmo game to take a very close look at eve online 's market . 
  it 's basically a real market completely left for the players to regulate , excepted a restricted set of items sold by npcs only , as well as a larger set of items sold by players and npc , whith a price changing over time . 
  it was actually the market on which the whole game was based . 
  everything gravited around ressources and production , which immediately lead to pvp , politics and such .

  sorry if i 'm missing sarcasm or a joke , but do you think he really did n't have any chance ? 
  it 's hard to estimate the power of the shock with the camera moving fast too . 
  hey , a couple of typos made your comment rather difficult to read but i found it interesting . 
  op is saying to spam regular spells and wait for a small streak of no refresher prox to guarantee a much higer chance to prox refresher the next try , similarily to crit , entangle and other pseudorandom factors . 
  i 'm sorry i linked such a poor source , i admit i did n't have much time to look into it . 
  thanks for your complementary information .

  and the bag yes , you can keep the bag . 
  nice to meet you sir , salutations to your assassins army . 
  you make it seem like [ asian rice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glutinous_rice ) is a worst version of white ( [ african ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oryza_glaberrima ) , actually ) rice because they ca n't eat white rice with chopstick . 
  that shows that you do n't know how to use choptsticks properly , and do n't understand culinary cultures very well . 
  i mean , you can easily eat african rice with chopsticks , or many other smaller pieces of food . 
  and the difference in asian and african rice lies in genetics , not in how good people were with chopsticks . 
  beside this , i totally respect the fact that you do n't like sticky asian rice , it feels very different than usual african rice . 
  it 's a tautology , so assuming it to be false is a contradiction in itself . 
  however , very often initializing induction for n equals to 0 or 1 or any low value is extremely simple , but must not be forgotten . 
  i fail to remember some good examples of inductions that have no problem to be proven for n +1 if asumed true for n but can not actually be initialized for any n. 
  edit : lets say n  2 and assume n = n + 1 , then n +1 = n +2 using 1 = 1 . 
  there , you have one , not very hard actually . 
  i am pretty sure / u/gausswanker refers to the induction of scientific knowledge , in particular in physics . 
  we started from a collection of subjective observations that we gathered as the formulation of objective laws and hypothesis . 
  our models guide us into finer experiments and observations , which leads to enhancing our models , rinse and repeat . 
  if we stopped to this explaination , then yes the scientific reasoning would appear somewhat closed , encased by the frame imposed by the limit of our hypothesis . 
  the thing is that critical thinking is key to scientific reasoning . 
  thus , it is very possible that some hypothesis would be proven false by an experiment . 
  it happened , and the hypothesis was changed , models adapted , new paradigms emerged and without deniying the value of the previous knowledge , it was rendered incomplete and broadened . 
  to finish , i think that even things like logic or algebra or geometry can not be fully proven in th . 
  a set of elementary concepts and relations has to be chosen before the pure inductive construction of the set of properties and more elaborate concepts could happen . 
  however , we do n't question mathematical axioms much compared to the laws of physics or biology , i think because the object of the mathematical science is very far from the value of truth of it axioms but lies in the articulation of the properties they induce . 
  \u0e88\u0644\u035c \u251c \u252c \u2534 \u252c \u2534 psst , i 'll make it for 18.5 dongs . 
  cash please . 
  dude go easy on him . 
  yeah , because it 's not the cast range like youcantkillmymind said . 
  it is , like op said , a * range indicator * . 
  for some single target spell it is the cast range , but for many no-target aoe spells it is the effective range of the spell ( like slardars 's crush , ravage , axe 's call or naga 's ripe tide ) . 
  for some targeted aoe ( think leshrack stun ) , it often displays cast range + max range with aoe , so that the range shown is the furthest you could reach with your spell in every direction . 
  or , you can cast the spell from where you are standing if the targeted area fits completely inside the range indicator . 
  centaur stun does indeed lack a range indicator . 
  i do n't know , i understand that op thinks skeleton are nsfw but he seems to be the only one on / r/pics http://i.imgur.com/expwxkj.png, 
  i zoomed out to show as many posts as possible . 
  how about some sources ? 
  i really do n't know what you mean by `` leading you to a conclusion of your own '' . 
  how is it a conclusion on your own if lsd leads you to it ? 
  why should ` nt lsd be interpreted as a factor that alters diatery habits if it `` leads to conclusions '' that alter your dietary habits ? 
  i think it actually proves / u/holysweetbabyjesus ' point surprisingly well , i did n't expect such difference . 
  it 's not the case anymore since you can only random a second time and not manually repick a hero . 
  i expected op to have maybe a salve left in his inventory , but with the mek as well he had no chance . 
   russia has its problems , but it is unfair to make it seem like it is evil . 
  they are people , and the same as you, 
   the us are greedy pigs consuming all the world, 
  meh , it does n't take much to make your point of view fall apart . 
  you are right , and same should apply to mek/pipe/crimson / buckler and such . 
  are you telling me that our traditional weapons wo n't work against these water bears alien invaders ? 
  seriously , i am surprised to see nobody raising a voice against this news pathfinding algorithm among the pro players . 
  i expected valve to be forced to roll back their old system given how broken the new is , just for the time to fix it a ~ ~ bit ~ ~ lot , given how active the dota 2 esport scene is . 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't focus on the cash-grabing , mobile app-like economic model of hots when i 'm busy thinking about why ** you ca n't select anything in the game beside your hero ** . 
  you have no idea of the health of the other heroes ( ally or enemy ) , you ca n't check anyone 's mana , you ca n't heck if the hp of the creep evolve along the game . 
  same for structures of course . 
   i immediately regret my deceivion . 
  \u30fd \uff08 \uff09 \u256f hoooom , i thing i have reached dongularity too \u30fd \uff08 \uff09 \u256f in my mind , a set of shapes slowly take form and assemble as letters that spell f-u-c-k-t-h-e-m-o-d-s . \u30fd \u00ba\u0644\u035f\u00ba \u256f, 
  from what op said about his class assignment , my guess is the formula was given as input of the problem , and op wonndered why the formula looks like it did . 
  by the way it 's an extremely healthy way to approach science / u/drag0vien , and many formula are obtained as solution of optimization problem . 
  i 'm going to do this until the day i 'll accidentally hit accept then hate you forever . 
  \u0b67 \u0361 \u25c9 \u76ca \u0361 \u25c9 \u0b68 then what did jew expect ? 
  it could backfire temporarily , but might push tournament organizers to increase their production value to increase ticket sales . 
  if they ca n't compensate low ticket attraction due to average or bad production value with items , they will likely work on the former . 
  i was confused at first before i read what you mentioned about usin g the nightly build . 
  same happened to me : your command would n't work with my installed version of livestreamer , but downloading the standalone nightly build , i was able to load joindota stream with this much simpler argument . 
  this [ build ] ( http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/livestreamer-latest-win32.zip ) can be found at the end of the [ windows installer ] ( http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/install.html#windows-binaries ) section .

  this is what i do when i 'm not having a hard time . 
  direct torrent -  boat combo is fairly easy to do mid lane in a 1v1 setup or even when rotating and the lvl 1 x mark basically only allows you to x yourself for a quick base tp round trip . 
  if you do n't control rune and are having regen problem , get it for this purpose . 
  the answer to your question is quite simple : ( \u00b0 \u035c\u0296\u0361 \u00b0 ) \u256d \u2229 \u256e, 
  ( \u0ca5\u0c6a\u0ca5 ; ) i love your work it 's very poetic . 
  belgian chocolate sure is famous here in france , but i would have to give it to lindt from switzerland for taking the ( chocolate ) cake as far as my taste goes [ for supermarket chocolate ] . 
  i do know the difference between chocolatiers and bigger companies , but it does n't make sense to compare patrick roger or even brands like leonidas or jeff de bruges to brands like lindt . 
  i was talking about chocolate you can buy at the supermarket .
