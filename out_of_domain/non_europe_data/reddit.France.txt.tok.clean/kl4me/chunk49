  i see , thanks a lot . 
  i was n't sure if i should use the xml path and program my filter myself , or use the windows ui . 
  my first google search about xml filtering were specific to windows and the results were a bit messy . 
  in particular , the whole enableing process audit in the security event viewer was missing and made the whole thing confusing to me . 
  are you serious ? 
  this cake looks like shit . 
  do n't even bother tasting it , you can throw it away . 
  or better , just send it to me and i 'll go throw it away for you . 
  ^ i 'll ^ pm ^ you ^ my ^ address, 
  as expected , your code works like a charm !, 
  thank you very much . 
  i could n't find in the ui how to use the information in < evendata  or the rest of the event xml but now it 's clear to me how it 's done . 
  so you know , all this was to automatically change the message.wav file that plays each time you receive an instant message on steam . 
  a few years ago , valve disabled the ability to use custom files , and the file gets reset at every launch . 
  i wrote a tiny batch file that swaps the files , and now thanks to you it 's completely automated !, 
  i though he was saying he did n't like vegetables . 
  i agree with the castration approach much more , because this is what it is . 
  people seek laws and limits that will castrate them ( as in , take away their ability to fuck someone ) , and give them limits to the apparently infinite desire . 
  in western societies , it is more common to have interiorized this limitation of sexuality . 
  this is a way to explain why some more traditional countries see this kind of society as sexually depraved and selfish . 
  on the other hand , you can see the sexual restrictions imposed by religions or dictatorships or even laws in democratic countries as entraving controling tools . 
  in any case , we seek for common ways to limit our desires , so you can protect yourself from others desire and justify yours . 
  i do n't see it as the condition imposed by a higher power to control us , but more like something we seek ourselves and find sometimes in religion or any other social setup . 
  yeah , i might not have been clear about the fact that the castraction is useful . 
  i 'm not saying it 's good or bad , it 's something we use to conciliate our pulsions and reality . 
  so the goal is not to be liberated from all castration , it 's to be in adequation with the one you built yourself around . 
  drunks ( i mean chronic alcoholics ) know they poison themselves . 
  they are strugling with limitation as much as fanatic religious that impose drastic restriction on sexual activities . 
  thanks for the tip , here are the files https://www.dropbox.com/s/vpmab8mpym8lm2h/ee_soundboard.zip?dl=0, 
  edit : i converted the files into wav using hldj which was supposed to put them at the correct format for source but it seems they still are at the wrong bitrate . 
  it 's discriminatory in the most litteral meaning where you are `` perceiving differences in characteristics between elements of one or more groups . '' . 
  and as you said , it makes a lot of sense in many situations . 
  if by my experience , people with bad english lead to bad trades , i 'm going to use this to assess the quality of a trader for instance . 
  if you come from r/circlejerk , i have a very important message for you . 
  oh yeah , i did n't even react about the racism thing because it 's utterly idiotic . 
  you discriminate ( in the neutral way ) things all the time to assess your judgement , it does n't mean you think genetics allows to sort human in categories of various quality based on ethnic criterion . 
  granted , the difference between the two is * slightly * fainter when you are discriminating humans , but still . 
  but i 'm shit at playing fps with a controller . 
  well , the team probably will need 5 carries . 
  \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68 death to the chocolate dong !, 
  the only dong of value is praline dong \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68, 
  the point is not about being surprised , the point is doing something about it . 
  jes you look beautiful \u2740 \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 / / \u258c / \\, 
  thank you very much for this . 
  i knew about the spreadsheet but was n't sure if the karthu was treated specifically . 
  nothing wrong for sure , but really musical talent is a matter of training , just like many talent . 
  there is definitely a personal touch to bring when you play music , but you actually learn what is your personal touch by listening to great musicians , and pleaying really really bad at first . 
  you have to work on the connexion with the instrument , which needs a lot of time and is never fully complete . 
  but i think it 's something worth to start even much later in life , just like sport . 
  and goodbye mister dong . 
  \u30fd \u0ca5\u0644\u035f\u0ca5 \u256f thank god you 're here aws !, 
  quick , the situation is getting out of hand , we need your help against the rising dong .

  well what did jew expect ? 
  it is a fairly recent change , couple of months i 'd say . 
  hon\u00eatly i do n't really care about being the first in europe , as long as we beat the rosbifs . 
  are we posting pictures of mods now ? 
  yeah he can avoid questions by answering superficially enough . 
  like : `` do you want to make this forbiden ? '', 
  well , some things must be forbiden '' . 
  but the guy answering the questions remained much less agressive than the guy leading the discussion . 
  you should n't have to talk more than what your questions require as context to allow the other guy to answer . 
  can i go with you i am scared \u0ca5\u0644\u035f \u252c \u2534 \u252c \u2534 \u2524, 
  i doubt you really need a source when you can try this so easily at home . 
  since 2003 , watch the bad guys in hollywood ( and some british ) movies . 
  you will see a substential portion of usually asian or russian bad guys becoming french , manipulative backstabbing bad guys ( and often mathematician , this i do n't complain about ) . 
  as surprising as it might sound , i think the choice not to ally to the us for the irak war was what had the biggest impact on perception of french in the us in the second part of 20th century . 
  i think it could have lead to the jokes on the cowardness of french , the freedom fries , the ban to import some french products , etc. 
  we basically were stripped from our honor and strength and left with our symbols of romantism and sensuality . 
  \uff3c ( \u00b4 \u25d3 \u0414 \u25d4 ` ) \uff0f no i am dongacus \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68, 
  what is going on over here ? 
  also thanks for the repost , it 's one of the few i always re-read , as well as the warthog stories . 
  same here . 
  the npapi flash plugin that i have been using for months suddenly stopped working . 
  switching back to the built-in ppapi plugin allows to play the video but i 'm afraid the latency it caused on my browser is going to come back with it . 
  ( \u2740 \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) i am fashionable . 
  i have a trouble with your practice of free speech that allows people of influence to lie and manipulate the population in favor of various lobbies ( main topics that come to my mind are religious lobby vs sexuality , military lobby vs war and ownage and representation of guns , food lobby vs obesity epidemic , energy lobby and global warming ) . 
  i see you filthy mod are trying hard to appear as a benefactor for the donger community . 
  you are fooling nobody ( \uff3e \u25e1 \uff3e ) \u3063 \u2702 \u2570 \u22c3 \u256f,

  did an evil moderino steal it from you ? 
  you might want to take a look at [ bulldog 's ti 3 final commentary ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/2r7kru/bulldog_ti3_commentary/ ) , where in the last game , bulldog highlights so many mistakes of 1k level , like not having your stunner in front when roaming smoked , or having the 1 position going entering the enemy jungle with no vision , etc. 
  players like s4 , dendi and others also do huge mistakes , sometimes .
