  it is not very hard . 
  you can try [ fraps ] ( http://www.fraps.com/ ) , more straightforward to get a video from what you see on your screen and easier to setup than obs . 
  damn , i 've been missing that so much . 
  no idea why it 's not possible in the vanilla version .

  the most lacking thing in these situation is ** empathy ** . 
  it 's hard to know the mindset of random teammates , and usually it 's lack of empathy that leads to blaming and flaming . 
  if you show empathy first , you increase tremendously your chances of defusing the flaming war about to - or that has already started . 
  one way to show empathy is , when you make a mistake yourself , tell the other that you are sorry , or at least tell them what lead you to your mistake . 
  something like `` yeah fuck i got too greedy and did n't realize i should n't dive '' , or `` so sorry team i play like garbage right now but i 'm trying '' . 
  another way to show empathy is to encourage your teammates when they do mistakes , or cheer when they do something you appreciate . 
  upgrading courier before 4-5 minutes , or shortly after you asked for it ? 
  i 'm going to give my support one or two friendly pings , a  well played !, 
  and a short `` ty mate '' in chat . 
  your carry did n't realize the enemy went roaming in your jungle and he got ganked ? 
  tell him what you 're going to do to help him , or to turn the enemy move in your advantage by pushing or ganking elsewhere , etc. 
  people become agressive and selfish when no empathy is shown , because allies are assumed to be competiting with them for the fun there is to grab on the map . 
  empathy make people accept you 're on their side of the fun . 
  [ biblethump ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hxcceqprb0 ), 
  nor spell keys . 
  i mean , allies that do n't cast their spells is a problem , but this is on another level i feel like . 
  because even un specialized subreddits , people use sob titles to make their post more interesting . 
  `` we do n't hate you , you are the devil '' . 
  careful with that , the three last times i bought plane tickets , i got higher prices in incognito than in nomal mode . 
  ah , the good ole goku technique https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0flcfoixjq, 
  for those who want to see how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swoian5zx34, 
  what if it is already goggle 's definition ? 
  i mean come on , the tweet to rdjr that starts with `` hello good sir '' . 
  is this steam chat scammers ? 
  having a very efficient ingame voice would indeed be very nice . 
  on eve online , eve voice was introduced too late and it was way too shaky at the start to be convincing . 
  in dota 2 the very good voice chat allows you to swear at your allies very easily and clearly . 
  on a more social game like sc , i could think of amazing things to do if audio comms were to be deeply integrated ingame . 
  think about signal interception , spying and such . 
  you do n't have to complain , you 're pretty buff yourself ... for a girl . 
  except that modeling does n't attract morbidly obese people while it can entice your girls to fast to resemble the most skinny models . 
  when you know that the us trained some [ pilots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planning_of_the_september_11_attacks#hani_hanjour ) responsible of 9/11 , this argument becomes a tad weaker . 
  add her to this [ list ] ( http://thevsangelz.tumblr.com/measurements-and-description ) and i 'm pretty confident that my point holds . 
  thanks a lot . 
  i was surprised such setups were n't more easily available among the community of hotas users attracted by sc . 
  i am a new owner of a hotas setup and this helps a lot . 
  of course not , the same way we wo n't deny welfare to muslim migrants . 
  \u30fd ( \u25e5 \u2323 \u25e4 ) \u256f i was born for this day \u30fd ( \u25e5 \u2323 \u25e4 ) \u256f, 
  well this is what the post i was originally answering to implied . 
  [ biblethump ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kolfehv-kia ), 
  i take this as a yes , i give you two weeks . 
  what is your donger ? 
  you like to enjoy your life and take things as they come . 
  you are a creative person and to a point , you believe in magic and psychic powers . 
  you are ... the mystical donger . 
  i was really surprised to see the ` display highest mmr in each team ' so quickly implemented ingame after it was suggested here . 
  it happens often , but rarely that fast . 
  \u256e ( \u256f \u0644\u035c \u2570 ) \u256d pleb or not, 
  it doesnt matter, 
  if you raise your donger \u256e ( \u256f \u0644\u035c \u2570 ) \u256d, 
  your dave ikea stand is exactly what i was missing . 
  i was delaying the point at which i would completely switch to hotas because i did n't have a proper setup and this might just do it . 
  i literally just did . 
  i already have a joystick and throttle but the way i had to put them on my desk where they would n't be hold by anything but their weight was n't satisfying . 
  i will thanks . 
  i 'll probably post a couple pictures once it 's done , as an axample og a vert simple and flexible hotas setup . 
  i use it to easily switch profiles when playing various game . 
  \u51f8 \u25c9 _ \u25d4 \u51f8 raisin 2 help save prais from uds, 
  join steam group , join lobbies when event are announced , have fun with nice players . 
  yup . 
  it 's the same steam group . 
  it 's a normal subreddit , but managed by scammers and full of phishing links . 
  she is an empathetic , cheerful , modest support player . 
  i do n't think you can say it 's crap if the reason you are impacted by this is that you are saving money . 
  if what you save is n't worth losing your alpha access , use the ccu . 
  your problem is different from op 's . 
  the first google result of `` safety car vs plane '' is [ this ] ( http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/comparing-fatality-risks-united-states-transportation-across-modes-time ) that states that `` excluding acts of suicide and terrorism , commercial aviation was the safest mode of travel in the united states , with 0.07 fatalities per billion passenger miles '' . 
  i ca n't see why a medical school that would allow its students to not ~ ~ train ~ ~ be trained on the body of opposite sex could be qualified as `` better '' . 
  people trained to be doctor should be able to comfortably opperate with any human , not just the half of their sex . 
  again , nobody is forcing anyone . 
  there are rules that have to be accepted before entering the school . 
  so litteraly nobody here thinks `` forcing a girl to drop her clothing and be touched is ok if she does not want it '' . 
  you are the only one picturing girl forced to expose their body to boys . 
  if you ca n't realize that letting persons of one sex deny examination from persons from the other sex on them leads to an incomplete training that does not allow to understand and cure persons of both gender adequately , there is nothing more i can say . 
  i know for sure that i would never go see such a doctor , neither would i recommend it to someone from the opposite sex as mine . 
   bullshit , she is checked in a medical way , not in a sexual way, 
  the only thing i understand from / u/nistrel 's point of view is that he * religiously * refuses to consider the female body in a non sexual way . 
  i 'm not blaming or anything , but that 's the only thing that emmerges from his posts . 
  i 'm not saying it should be easy either , but we should train at least our doctors to do so even is he ca n't comprehend it ( because of how it helps to objectively approach a patients condition ) . 
  [ waow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgg0vqp74da ), 
  dude , 100 % winrate on roaming qop dude . 
  i paid for a bulldong donation . 
  definitely dankest quality . 
  we 'll get a disapointed `` we lost '' biblethump, 
  i brought my own , thanks ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u256d \u035c\u0296 \u256e \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you have to follow a low/no residual diet 2-3 days before , and you have to replace one or two meals before the operation with drinking a laxative that 'll make you spend a bit of time on the toilet , to clean your guts . 
  the product does n't taste good , but besides this it 's just spending time on the throne . 
  i bet all the dongerina are after you \u30fd / \u2740 \u14c0 \u0644\u035c \u14c2 \\ \uff89, 
  would n't it work to actively campaign to inform people that this information is available on their demand ? 
  account : klame, 
  thank you so much !, 
  \u1566 ( \u0ca5\u0c6a\u0ca5  \u1557 i will raise no matter the cost . 
  same here , it seems my flash plugins are responsible . 
  i had to switch to the flash plugin built in chrome a few days ago because twitch would n't load anymore . 
  tonight , that plugin stop working too ( streams keeep buffering or do n't load at all ) , but the stream looks fine when using livestreamer + vlc , so it 's got to be the flash plugin .
