  sorry not a native speaker , do you mean this as `` speculate/extrapolate '' ? 
  thanks , could n't make sure of what it meant by myself . 
  i agree with / u/ewokskick then .

  the penis is n't a muscle , do people really think it is muscular contraction that makes a penis rigid ? 
  it is not . 
  it litteraly gives you a buff of mana , that will be removed after the soul ring effect expires if some of it remains remains . 
  it does not change the way spells use mana . 
  you got it wrong i think . 
  the aaron building the large scale machine at the end is aaron 2 and he is the one phoning aaron 1 . 
  lol i guess so , i ca n't fathom how someone would take the time and bother creating a reddit thread before taking 30 seconds to look at their mana pool when using soul ring ... 
  never in the movie is implied that you can go back in time earlier than when a box is started , and there is nothing that could indicate that the aaron we see at the beginning is the number 3 . 
  he is n't using his recording , there would be no explaination of where aaron 1 is ? 
  i find your explaination interesting but i still do not agree . 
  do you mean that it is implied that you can ** actually ** go back before the failsafe . 
  because once again , nothing implies it . 
  everything is clearly explained by showing how they exit boxes when they are being turned on . 
  i do n't even see when it is implied once that you can go back earlier than when the box you enter to go back in time was being turned on . 
  the idea of recursion is here to express the opposite of causality , that is objects being affected by their expected future . 
  i know what you are refering to . 
  but the machine they are talking about is when saying `` the box abe is making wo n't work '' is the first box being built in the storage unit . 
  abe3 will sabotage it and prevent abe 1 and aaron 1 to enter the cycle of time travel he experienced himself , convincing them that the idea wo n't lead anywhere . 
  there is something incoherent in my last comment . 
  the scene at the airport takes place after they prevented the accident with the ex boyfriend monday night , and at this point the boxes already work ( abe 's , which he left on for the nights for the regular one , and continuously on for the failsafe ) . 
  i still think that the way you can go back is only by entering a machine and exiting it when it was being turned on and unless they magically went back in time to before all happened in a split second right after we see them spending the night and before the airport scene begins , abe can not go and do what he says he will and sabotage the machine . 
  however i see what you mean about aaron . 
  the timelines are not parallel , but breach out when someone exit from a machine . 
  so the time line of your original self before exiting a machine is the same as the time line of the version of yourself that will go back in time until the machine is turned on . 
  thus every aaron share the same time line , until the moment where a aaron would eventualy from the first time for a machine ( first time as in the earliest in point in the original , common time line ) , same for abe . 
  i do n't think that the story can change before the first machine is turned on . 
  however , i thing there is a reason why granger is in the plot and what happened at the party . 
  i think bearded granger is from a timeline where the ex boyfriend shot his daughter . 
  i think we never hear about this original time line , that got diffused by granger going back from tuesday morning to monday evening to ask aaron to prevent it . 
  so i think we see all the original characters until the first machine is turned on . 
  but i do n't think we see the first time line where the accident actually happens ( i realize by typing this than rather than the daughter dying , it could have even been aaron that died trying to protect her , and granger sent by abe after he revealed him the existence of the machine to save aaron 's life , and that as aaron is dead in granger 's original time line the two of them do n't interact well ) . 
  / r/f7u12 is what brought me to reddit , i 'm not ashamed of my past . 
  poor moth : c, 
  well , the comic about hot and cold water when taking a shower is almost at the top of the frontpage ... 
  i unsubed long ago , i meant that this comic was back close to the top of the subreddit frontpage because content recycle insanely fast there . 
  i understood something reading this http://theprimeruniverse.blogspot.fr/2009/05/primer-universe.html that i did n't realize yesterday when i watched the movie for the first time . 
  when you go back in time and exit a box , it is possible to simply turn it off and prevent yourself from time traveling ( because your old self would find the machine turned off and hence would not be able to use it like you did it the first time ) . 
  so i think what abe implies at the airport is that he will use the earliest box , go back , turn it off/sabotage it as well as the other , non failsafe boxe abe wanted to use monday and show aaron and prevent further development and watch his old self and old aaron from afar so see that they do n't manage to remake the machine later . 
  he uses the earliest box , exits it sunday evening , and turn it off . 
  when his old self comes back monday morning to check on the failsafe and/or setup the new box to use and show to aaron , he found the machine not working and might have abandoned the idea to make another box if his failsafe was n't functioning , or keep working on it but having also this box turned off by the sabotaging abe . 
  i think this is the way abe expect to prevent the story to happen . 
  i think it is implied that the person who is hearing the recording at the end of the movie is someone who , as the recording says , `` will have [ this only phone call ] as proof '' that the story was prevented , and is being told over the phone by one of the character who escaped from a time line where the story did happen by using a machine , and preventing it from functioning . 
  to be fair , i find rage comics exceptionnaly universal . 
  it is a very unique type of media that allows so many people so talk about their problems and daily life in a humorous fashion that many will get . 
  i guess i use [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zmvsvk7.png ) as replacement today .

  i 've suffered ibs for 20 years and psylium changed my life . 
  what about the fat layer that protects viruses like the flu in dry and cold environments but that basically melts and makes iut much more vulnerable in wet and hot weather ? 
  i take some [ ispaghul ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantago_ovata ) before diner and it has only positive effects : eases transits , and basically eradicates most diarrhea and associated cramps , although i also take an antispasmodic that helps with that . 
  it 's a powder that i dilute in some water and that tastes like an orangeade . 
  it does n't seem to be harmful on the long term either , so you could take it all your life . 
  you have to be careful not to take too much though , as high dosage could worsen an ibs condition . 
  it 's also studied as a cholesterol regulator .
