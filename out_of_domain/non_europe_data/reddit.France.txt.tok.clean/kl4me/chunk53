  first ship after rookie ship , imicus bought by my corp. 
  the game is a couple weeks old , i know barely anything . 
  approaching a station , i see some empty capsules near the exit . 
  i approach in their direction , right click , `` board '' , to see myself transfered into the capsule and my proud imicus keeps going . 
  i try to reach him but it 's faster , too fast . 
  i watch him slowly go away , and receive an insurance notification as it left the grid . 
  `` well , fuck you too . '', 
  hoho !, 
  haha !, 
  maybe it 's a violent nose boop . 
  reading all these stories ... 
  i should watch the office .

  we got veno and his aids , cancer lancer , ebola spirit . 
  what would be next ? 
  i do n't understand why , i 'd keep as a friend anyone that would graciously double my wallet for free . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's perfectly ok to discuss cases if it is done without revealing the identity of the patient , is n't it ? 
  in the precise case of the proposed photon experiment , the author fails to realize that the information first travels with the photons when you are taken afar from each other . 
  it 's like randomly giving one shoe of a pair to someone without looking which one they have and which one you kept , and going awy from them . 
  then , you check which one you have , and instantly deduct the shoe the other person has . 
  but it does n't mean that this information travels at the moment and at the speed you process it .

  lille is one of the most beautiful city of france , i ca n't fathom how you could wonder `` why they brought you there , because it was dirty '' . 
  sorry for my harsh tone . 
  it 's just that it 's an awesome city , i think there is more to see than how clean or dirty it is !, 
  and that 's if you 're not stacking it . 
  i 'm coming back after three years and all the old killboards i used are dead , what would you use to quickly stalk someone 's past activity ?

  your comment made me remember of that old story of a guy abusing reaction in pos and paying for dozains of accounts with it for months , and revealing it when quiting the game . 
  he could basically run reactions without the components . 
  i 'd pill it up during the whole game and never touch it in case i ever need it . 
  you could provide screenshot of your wallet to prove your good faith . 
  \u256d ( \u2022 \u2323 \u2022 ) \u256e do you have one that fires carrots ? 
  same with starcraft 2 where you basically study the opening like blind chess and you get to see how your opponent 's move beat you .

  i 've always had this impression . 
  i think it 's been a while this guy gave up on being like everyone else and started looking for his way . 
  because people assume that `` dlc '' can only be used for dlcs that you have to buy , but op is 100 % correct calling it a dlc ( even steam does it ) . 
  i agree with you on the seeing a therapist part , but not * after * you 've figured out the reasons of your depression . 
  rather , you go there to learn clues about those reasons . 
  you sound at first a little bit like those that just tell people to get over it , while i understand you perfectly know what you are talking about . 
  i totally agree with you , one if not the best way to deal with severe depression is to face yourself on the coach of a shrink . 
  even the best pets or the best introspection ca n't achieve that , not even close . 
  not sure which part of the world you 're from but check your local subreddits , you could find some helpful resources or people willing to help . 
  good luck mate . 
  do not touch me , you 're gon na give me dongbola \uff3c ( \u00b4 \u25d3 \u0414 \u25d4 ` ) \uff0f, 
  more ... ass . 
  yes . 
  but is it real shitpost ? 
  i feel like with the signatures of the pros it becomes something else . 
  something more .
