  he trusted you ... poor soul . 
  maybe he 's one of those techies pickers with very fast fingers and robotic brains . 
  it 's not that smart if it 's obvious that you do n't behave coherently . 
  daddy ? 
  is ... is that you ? 
  already your priorities straight i see . 
  i am game , can you ask the mittani to reset standings pls ? 
  \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68 we will not let this happen !, 
  ( \u0ca5\u0c6a\u0ca5 ) what an unfair world we live in , i wish i could `` part ways '' with the mods \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 _ \u2022 \u0337 \u253b \u033f \u2550 \u2501 \u4e00 \u2580 \u033f\u033f\u0139\u032f\u033f\u033f \u2580 \u033f \u2580 \u033f\u033f\u0139\u032f\u033f\u033f \u2580 \u033f \u2580 \u033f\u033f\u0139\u032f\u033f\u033f \u2580 \u033f, 
  \u2570 ( \u0361 ' \u25df \u25ef \u0361 ' ) \u256f yes let 's unit we will definitely not kill all the mods as soon as we get the occasion \u2570 ( \u0361 ' \u25df \u25ef \u0361 ' ) \u256f, 
  how poetic biblethump, 
  i could see reddit admins suing mods be a decent next chapter to this fairytale . 
  i do n't know , i 'm gon na go with the cannibalistic secret fanstraight , it 's more colourful . 
  it 's made of milk and cows eat grass so i 'm pretty sure it 's classified as vegetable , next to the pizza . 
  some are seriously challenging fossiles and global warming , i fear they do n't need me to come with the silliest ideas . 
  i usually go to zkillboard and look for the most frequently occuring fits on the ship type i am looking into , because i 've never found any reliable fit rating website . 
  can i have your stuff ? 
  i 've done this recipe a couple of times now , and i 'm actually doing it again tomorrow . 
  i stuff the chicken with [ brousin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f6lbymb.jpg ) and it 's marvellous . 
  it takes more time to do when you are n't as experimented as him of course , but it 's 100 % worth a try . 
  it 's not the only thing he was willing to raise ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i get you and i am aware of that , i restrain myself de facto to ships that got destroyed . 
  however you still can grasp the philosophy of how a hull is flown when you see one or two fits coming back very regularly . 
  you could simply mix the two audio because we 're very good at separating frequencies . 
  it 's like having background music and conversation , you can pick each of them easily . 
  if your motd has sections , you could create a chan per section and set the links of a whole section as the motd of the associated chan , and relace each section with a link to the associated chan . 
  i recommend you make your own , it 's very easy . 
  grab a bit of spice ( i use garlic , paprika , laurel , fines herbes ) , salt , pepper , bread crumbs ( and eventually a bit of cornstach ) in a bowl and a beaten egg in another bowl . 
  dip raw chicken breast in egg , dip in spices , eventually do it once more ( double dip makes the taste of your coating stronger ) , and fry something like 6-8 minutes . 
  you do n't even have to deep fry , just put enough oil to have maybe half a centimeter of oil in your pan . 
  when you 're used to this , you get your spice mixed in a couple of minutes , and it takes maybe 15 min total to make some delicious nuggets . 
  you 're * extra * cromulent . 
  just call them out on their bullshit http://edition.cnn.com/feedback, 
  you never know . 
  they could have someone independent from the shows looking at feedback . 
  [ you know what they say ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d1x4qa2.jpg ), 
  i still have a couple of large rigs mounted on medium and even small ships . 
  who wants to buy a crow with a large ancillary current router ? 
  they are sexually stimulating cats in heat so yeah , it 's not like the cat just `` really loves it '' . 
  living in a country where almost nobody on the street is susceptible to carry a weapon . 
  yeah , except that it 's completely legal . 
  you 're confusing tests that can be presented to a judge to establish a fathership and regular tests . 
  labs can only give official results if they are mandated by a judge . 
  but you can ask for a test for your own use anytime you want . 
  and obviously a judge is going to order one if the question is relevant during a divorcem for for child support or similar events . 
  the wikipedia article is just wrong . 
  paternity tests `` at home '' are perfectly legal and you 're free to take one anytime you want . 
  what is restricted by a judge are tests that can be produced to a tribulan with an official value ( for instance to change a birth certificate ) . 
  those have to be ordered by a judge , before following the same procedure as regular tests . 
  obviously if a judge orders a man to pay childsupport , if the paternity is a question , such test will be ordered . 
  i mean , it does n't even make sense from the start . 
  the source it cites is this http://www.ibdna.com/regions/uk/en/?page=paternity-testing-ban-upheld-in-france which is ... empty ? 
  the other source is the whole fucking french civile code , which is n't much better ( the linked file is a document of 220 + pages ) . 
  2003 veteran here . 
  i 'm only still here in the hope that we will reset everyone and a global conflict follows . 
  yeah , we might see one or two on tv when they film official buildings or events but it 's not a common item to display . 
  i 'm loging in just to add a couple millions . 
  i will never become a mod \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68, 
  you 'll know what to do \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 _ \u2022 \u0337 \u253b \u033f \u2550 \u2501 \u4e00 \u0e88\u0139\u032f\u033f\u033f \u2580 \u033f \u033f ), 
  notice the little man next to the cursor ? 
  it appears if your hero needs to walk in order to cast the spell where the cursor is . 
  if the cursor is inside the cast range it wo n't show . 
  edit : in this picture tinker is using his bots , hence the little man . 
  the picture is from a gif where tinker casts boots of travel . 
  so in this case it 's a bit atypical . 
  french here , i feel like the wine and alcohol lobbies are so strong we 're going to be among the last to legalize , even though we are one of the largest consummer in europe . 
  \u03b6 \u019f\u0346\u0644\u035c\u019f\u0346 \u1d98 rumors say hitler is n't dead and made a reddit account in secret . 
  anything to comment about that / u/alphawolfsniper ? 
  i mean , what sense does it make to talk about trolls when your co-ceo sits there in the middle of the shitstorm and brags about how good his popcorn tastes ? 
  [ deleted ], 
  i imagine the same applies to pudge , and does n't apply to slark ? 
  that was my first thought : `` how many catalysts would you need ... '', 
  i do n't know , it seems plenty enough . 
  all i need is just a little bit of capacitor to warp between anomalies with my carrier anyways . 
  i love how , after the whole physics experiment and the great detailed explaination , the father just explains the helium trick with * `` it 's magical !, 
  * booanus * if you 're from nyc . 
  i was thinking about using kerozen . 
  http://agar.io/ is more an mmo than those . 
  i 'd read this blog . 
  same , i happily discovered i have 5.5 k aur, 
  look at her opening her mouth and her lips . 
  she 's definitely trying not to break character . 
  also , they could be in the biggest trouble if they got reported . 
  i would n't expect them to keep chasing you in a main street . 
   i love you , food .

  i feel like since the change of gold per second and offlane equilibrium , the game has been over patched and did n't have time to converge to any real meta . 
  recent changes with comeback mechanics take several months to really see how it influences the structure of the game . 
  and yet it was preceeded and followed by more significant changes . 
  and a couple of pap links . 
  ultimate this ( \u00b0 \u035c\u0296\u0361 \u00b0 ) \u256d \u2229 \u256e, 
  - globby, 
  say hello to my little friend . 
  yeah right , until we develop neuronal aids that infects memories and get passed on to your clones . 
   as much as possible , ensure that the process of fighting over a star system is enjoyable and fascinating for all the players involved . 
  careful , a bit loud http://oddshot.tv/shot/arteezy_8_201506260404529976, 
  eh , it 's pretty fun . 
  i enjoy the way americans dig french culture when it 's not about war conflicts . 
  and this come from a guy who just made himself a pair of nice avocado bacon burgers so as you can see , the love is mutual .
