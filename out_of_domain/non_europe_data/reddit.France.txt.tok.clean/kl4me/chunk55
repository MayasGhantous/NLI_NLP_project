  i rememebr the good old tcf times , suiciding our double dd-proof bs fleets to make opening for goons and other allies . 
  does the missile range indicator take into account the time the missile requires to accelerate to full speed ? 
  i understand this , but in the past the accelerator faction was huge . 
  it might be an inconsistency occuring during this phase of the missile flight . 
  up to three years ago they definitely did .

  i want to try the korean fried chicken as shown in this video , but dude chicken wings are retardedly easy to do . 
  the main worry is to have the handful of spice ready . 
  here is how i do it :, 
  - you do n't even have to cut your wings in two , depends on if you prefer whole wings or when they are cut in two, 
  - mix in a bowl 1 spoon of garlic powder , one spoon of oignon powder , one spoon of salt , one spoon of pepper , one spoon of paprika , and one spoon of herbs ( i mix laurel and fines herb ), 
  - coat your wings with oil . 
  i use any frying oil , but olive oil should do it too . 
  the first time i used a tissue that i would dip in oil and then paint the wings , since then i 've bought a brush but it 's not a big deal . 
  you do that so the spice will stick to the wings, 
  - then , just coat the wings in spice . 
  first time i did it by hand , juste sprinkle your mix on the wings , then rub it a little in . 
  with a little brush it 's once again a bit easier, 
  - 20 min at 350f in the oven, 
  - after 20 min , i get them out of the oven , coat them in barbecue sauce ( once again , the brush comes handy but for a first timer just use the bask of a small spoon to coarsely coat the wings ) and put them a couple minutes under the grill , basically take them out when it starts to burn . 
  i know it wo n't be of any help right now , i 'm sorry . 
  but next time , just by buying a handful of wings before the weekend , you can be 25min away from delicious home made wings that only require 5 minutes of preparation , which can be a blessing for those 4:30 am emergencies .

  it 's very likely that the harnest is too tight and pinching him inbetween the shoulders/on the neck , which makes cats go limp . 
  i mean , you 're not supposed to fly something you ca n't afford . 
  i 've only been playing for a bit more than a week , and orbiting kerbin is still very comfortable before burning for the mun or minimus , because i get to position my maneuver node where i want around kerbin to get the least emergy-consumming burn . 
  if you do n't plan on orbiting kerbin first , does it mean you need to wait for your target to be at the correct position regarding to your launch site before taking off ?

  is n't apoptosis used for instance to create fingers during embryo development ?

  hey guys ,, 
  i am trying to merge those two parts with no success thus far . 
  i created the main rocket in one file , and the second , transparent and red part in another . 
  the pictures show what happens after i merge the two , if the second part is rooted at the trop on the armadillo tailpiece ( the big piece at the top ) . 
  when i root it anywhere else , and try to merge it to the main part , it comes broken in two and i ca n't put it back in one piece because one of its components will have lost his attachement point . 
  am i missing something regarding to the way i should root my second part ? 
  thanks for your help . 
  i did n't realize subassemblies were a thing because i picked up the game after they introduced the merge function . 
  it turns out you still can use it to do what i wanted to . 
  after merging my second part in , i just cloned it all except the root part pressing alt + enter , and could attach it on the side of my main rocket and mirror it properly .
