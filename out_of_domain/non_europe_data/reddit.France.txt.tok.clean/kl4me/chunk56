  i actually went with \u00e0 bunch of tcf fellows , sxiii members mostly , and we roamed around all night until we hit patch deployment time . 
  and then , afterward , logging back in my shitty vagabond after it lost something like 30 % of its speed and even more of its speed/signature tank . 
  i use this , no idea about who manages and updates it but it 's been accurate so far https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tzgzbirtblmj9oljlmkypefdo4cl430uqfmhy2hyuju/edit#gid=0, 
  i 've got [ this bad boy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hugcp8y.jpg ) , that was made for radio transmission during ww2 . 
  a good preface to notlikethis, 
  use smaller and thiner fins . 
  also archimed thrust is much more helpful than for hummingbirds . 
  i meant it was useful for lift , you 're right about forward thrust . 
  i was thinking about the helicopter-like flight of the hummingbird , much easier for the box ~ ~ ship ~ ~ fish . 
  you 're cute ( \u25d5 \u203f \u25d5 \u273f ), 
  ah yes , good old sweating to internal hemorrhage mutation . 
  / r/botsrights / might see ground to appeal this decision, 
  fun fact , in french `` les anglais sont arriv\u00e9s '' can be used to refer to when a girl has her period - because of their red coats . 
  what is this `` bug '' you speak of ? 
  ccp only release two things : features , and unannounced features . 
  do you mean original tcf , or tcf reborn ? 
  my time in the first one was awesome and i did n't think it had an inherent reason to fail , just people evolving a bit slower than the game imo . 
  oh i was there when tcf disbanded . 
  indeed , joshua cane took the lead after frederik . 
  joshua was more of a ( great ) military leader than a diplomatic visionary like fred was . 
  it 's true that frederik 's charisma was key in his leadership , but joshua could easily have done good enough before passing the lead to someone more inspired . 
  it 's not that people evolved slower than the game like i wrote earlier , but rather the game changing and offering choices that could n't fit in the current model of the alliance . 
  but i agree that you need a strong leader to keep us in line and give us a sense of unity . 
  you also need a project , a vision people could get behind to . 
  i remember suiciding so many fleets to break openings for goons and allies , we were known to be ferocious and not hesitating to jump in completely outnumbered . 
  we have much more . 
  nobody beats us at endurance running . 
  but we run slower on shorter distances than the ones you mentioned . 
  i understand he 's being funny and casual but i ca n't imagine anyone doing that kind of things in these times especially in paris . 
  that being said the gif is probably months/years old . 
  yes , go spread the word on robin !, 
  link people there , and make the snake cabbage people grow and prosper !, 
  it worked ( \u0361 \u25d5 \u035c \u0296 \u0361 \u25d5 ) \u256d \u2229 \u256e, 
  is n't it usual goon strategy to not engage and let the enemy tire ? 
  i know that mbcs momentum is very strong and wo n't give up easily , but it might just be imperium strategy for now . 
  i think ( and hope ) you still might see goons gather in great number when you 'll get too close from their hive . 
  makes me think of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dytss14sfy0, 
  and with some good shitposting always comes some good reshitposting \u266b \u250c \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 \u2518 \u266a s-h-i-t-p-o-s-t-i-n-g ! \u266b \u250c \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 \u2518 \u266a, 
  it 's even worse . 
  it 's brainwashing op so that he 'll spread cat propaganda . 
  opera has always been my backup browser . 
  this little guy usually is the last to fail when i have trouble with a webpage . 
  i find it pretty fast and straight to the point , i 'm not really surprised that it 's the first with such a feature . 
  i also recommend [ space sniffer ] ( http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/ ) , very useful and very pretty animation . 
  yeah not really , this cat is in heat .

  edit : loud video , warning, 
  * no siblings for me !, 
  i remember eve roulette . 
  it 's when your 500 people blob jumps on the enemy 500 people blob and you get a backstreen while jumping in . 
  you win the roulette if you manage to load before primary calling end . 
  for the hardest times , maybe only 20 % of us would load and play in tremendous lag . 
  we used to play it all the time in the first tcf days . 
  man , that brings so many memories . 
  hearing the few of us who loaded correctly fighitng . 
  staring at the screen , wondering in which parallel dimension of new eden you ended up . 
  the sheer excitement to be taking part in a battle so huge it 's too heavy for the server , and for the universe it feels like . 
  hey man , do n't think like that . 
  as / u/davidr _ v said , you can make this a plus , even if it 's not the plus you hoped it would end up being . 
  you could add that to your resume . 
  you could even contact blizzard and ask them for a job . 
  you say this , but today ~ ~ more ~ ~ virtually as many people use windows xp as windows 10 http://imgur.com/7u139zb, 
  dude you ruined my air quota of the day with that laugh, 
  this was already suggested in another thread . 
  give one to each player with a 5 or 10 minutes cooldown and you get the concise , elegant taunt dota deserves . 
  the road ahead is much less arduous than not dealing with that kind of issue directly . 
  very happy for you , you should be proud . 
  fun fact : dogs like squeaking toys because they mimic a screaming prey . 
  when i came back to the game last year after playing from a fairly young age between 2003 and 2012 , guys on mumble asked me if i was military because i kept announcing my name before speaking when roaming and giving concise intel . 
  nope , i just spent more than a third of my life doing pvp in eve . 
  i learned so much about coordination , teamwork and subordination here . 
  i say , let 's riot whether he gets on stage or not . 
  reminds me of starcraft 2 . 
  the huge majority of my learning was done by watching myself play and realize all i was doing not optimally . 
  man , why even bother ? 
  i heard it 's way too late to get gold now . 
  same here , very often i get a crash when closing virtual desktop and i find myself regularly having to manually restart steam vr . 
  i know, 
  another way to see it is considering god might have chosen initial conditions for our universe , but has since then let things go on their own . 
  well , i heard of the game for the first time two days ago and after a couple of games i love it . 
  there 's a good reason behind the hype for this shooter , it 's lot 's of fun . 
  biblethump [ never forget ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hxcceqprb0 ), 
  inb4 they make a navy fairy arcana from zelda that spams `` hey listen '' the whole game . 
  well of course it 's the same rule as `` the floor is water '', 
  imma give a firendly warning to people about to google what meatspin is . 
  nice , i 've been looking for that kind of server in eu region . 
  i 'll be joining soon !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vyqipo4miw ), 
  send photo, 
  do you plan on upgrading the server toi v245 .95 anytime soon ? 
  i updated my client with steam and i am stuck outside now \u0b67 \u0361 \u25d5 \u0434 \u25d5 \u0361 \u0b68, 
  thanks for the answer . 
  i 'll keep looking around then , but what happened is i dropped from the server right after an update was released , and could n't connect afterward . 
  i 'll check and see if anything else can cause this . 
  you should hear the man talking about [ dota 2 economics ] ( https://youtu.be/t8qeobglbqu?t=2342 ) . 
  he basically explains the concept where players create contents that other player buy and steam is just the platform giving the basic material used for user created content . 
  the rest of the video is worth watching too . 
  i managed to log back in and play a couple of hours since you updated , but just 5 minutes ago while i was connected i got dropped and now i am getting timeout errors when trying to come back in . 
  i was taming a lvl 120 ankylo , if someone sees it with my trike next to it please be nice with them they are not used to strangers .
