  pablito if you read this ... 
  i heard this makes them less tender . 
  c : / windows/bin /,

  i got this, 
  i. . you are following the art class rules are n't you ? 
  really nice to have this . 
  i know this is n't a priority but i find the keybind layout horrendous in the client . 
  funny but / u/siractionslacks 's only post is https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/1456cy/steam_workshop_the_prospector_announcer_pack/ which reeeaaally sounds like slack 's doing a voice announcer before becoming famous three years ago . 
  it really is that simple . 
  the best is to spot items that allow you massive short term roi and buy them in high volume . 
  after getting used to it it 's rather easy and you can make mad isks pretty quickly . 
  for those who do n't know where to begin i can help with placing the orders , just send me your isk and i should be able to double them . 
  mosquitoes have learned to just hold their breath when stinging to avoid repellent , time to change planet . 
  why yes i do , i happen to have it right [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yrhsnkv.png ) !, 
  it 's starting to get boring , having to wait years for basic ui fixes ( thhere is still no proper display of people accepting lobby for custom games with 20 people ) , in-game fixes ( roshan pit showing projectiles , has revealed game breaking repeatedly ) and now performance issues that likely will take months before being taken seriously by valve . 
  meanwhile they are finding enough people to run international tournaments and release still more monetized cosmetics .

  feelsbadman, 
  where 's the poor chemo-cm ? 
  yep , what i 'm going to look for is `` is it several orders of magnitudes better/safer than tor '' . 
  i usually use the name if the ship spelled backward . 
  i like egelircas , sinarat , or dnobagav . 
  although i use to name my vagas `` bond , vagabond '' when nano ship where the shit before the 2008 nanonerf . 
  it 's just moving up in term of level of programming . 
  as in , instead of programming the wanted cost function that often can be very hard , you program how to infer it given a numerical recipe that you deduced from your mathematical model . 
  and again , you can go higher by building a more general model that could be implemented in a programmer that would learn the first model i mentioned then automatically deduce the numerical recipe to automatically learn the desired function in order to obtain , in the end , the desired classification / inference . 
  all according to the plan, 
  an empty capsule ? 
  careful . 
  i have to say , i lost my first ship to an empty capsule . 
  at the time in summer 2003 , i did n't know much about the game . 
  i just had my first frigate financed by my corp and i was floating around in my glorious imicus , between mining , hauling and selling my processed ore . at this period my head was full of dreams to pilote one day a 8 miner apocalypse , as i heard that my corp has just produced its first battleship that was destined to our navy . 
  then , when warping to a station i see a couple of empty capsules laying there , close to the dedock spot . 
  so i start approaching them and , when i am close enough , i see the board option become available and i click it . 
  will i be able to see someone else 's flight data when boarding their pod ? 
  or maybe could i see whom it belong to and discover why it was sitting there abandoned and get it reunited with its owner ? 
  nope . 
  what happened is that in the couple of seconds i took to board and realize i was in a different ship , i saw my imicus keeping going full speed and starting to get away from me . 
  i realize my mistake , and tried to chase it but it was no use : i was already outside the board range and my capsule was n't fast enough . 
  after i let it go , it kept going and i received an insurance mail shortly after it escaped grid ( 250km wide max at the time if i remember correctly ) . 
  and that , is how i lost my first ship to an unmanned capsule . 
  are you calling double mwd torpedo shooting kestrel a mistake ? 
  from my memory of my sound and signal modelization and processing math class , we are used to the [ chromatic scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromatic_scale ) . 
  this scale puts every note a semi tone away from the previous and the next one . 
  before this scale was introduced and spread , you had various scales depending on the tonality of the piece you wanted to play . 
  this is due to the fact that naturally , notes should ** not ** be regularily spaced like in the chromatic scale . 
  for instance , one way to build a natural scale from a note is to take various frequency ratios ( like the [ pythagorean tuning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pythagorean_tuning ) ) which leads to unevenly spaced notes , and a more harmonious scale . 
  the problem with that kind of scale was that it did n't allow to play an instrument tuned for one tonality in another tonality . 
  so if you tuned say your piano for a piece in c major and played a piece in d major , the notes you would play would n't be the one of the d major scale and the piece would sound wrong . 
  what chromatic scale does is make all notes slightly off ( compared to what their frequency should be in a given natural scale ) by spreading them regularly . 
  you got used to it so you do n't notice it , and you can in any tonality you want . 
  my guess is that the guitare we saw reintroduces some notes from some natural scales , which lead to a more naturally harmonic feeling but also leads to a much more complicated fret pattern on the board . 
  this also explain why different people have a different reaction to this depending of their experience with music and sensitivity to tones and frequencies ratios .

  wait for ti7 finals,

  i faced a real challenge when i had to beat the emerald weapon while being allowed only for half an hour a day of playstation with my friend during some vacation at my grandparent 's . 
  maybe this is what the council is made of ? 
  magical godly shemales ? 
  oh i definitely ended up succeeding , but after several tries . 
  a way to estimate this is simply to take the total hp of the weapon , divide by the average damage of kotr invocation and multiply by the duration of the invocation . 
  damage is 13hits that should be in the 9000 , so that 's 120k damage per summoning , and 1m hp total for the weapon . 
  the summoning lasts 140 seconds . 
  so summoning 9 times will take you 21 minutes for the summoning alone . 
  so i guess it can be done in less than 30 minutes , but it must go flawlessly , and you must be high level enough/lucky enough to do enough damage in average , or you 'll need to cast it 10 times . 
  `` why is there so many space ? '', 
  could n't giving vision on enemy hero count as well ? 
  it would add up with bs passive . 
  you are probably getting the usual couple of automated downvotes , do n't worry . 
  i have a false positive with avira installing onward too . 
  i looked around and saw that other had the [ same problem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vive/comments/50c5fu/cant_play_onwards/ ) , i just added it to the exception list .

  this is not in the game yet , it was a demo . 
  i saw on / r/vive a post a post about creating this feature yourself my switching profile files that allow you to switch between several room setup with a single action once everything is set up . 
  probably because it 's already half butter . 
  more like half palm oil rather , but still . 
  i was yelling this as soon as i read the previous comment . 
  for those wondering https://youtu.be/xn0vulljx0i?t=122, 
  i expected an / r/eve post about some sort of app for simulating ingame interaction, 
  the french politics that have been the most vocal against the current terror attacks and islam radicalization are the ones that have nothing or close to propose to tackle the huge unemployment problem and the plethora of other very significant ways our country did n't reform itself ( retirement , education , health system - yes very generous i know but completely dysfunctional regarding some aspects of it , and mostly the job market regulation laws ) . 
  i 've been living solely on memes and twitch emotes for a couple of months now and i have never felt better seemsgood, 
  you can stay in 3d but change norm . 
  if you switch to the l1 norm while remaining in the usual three dimensional space , the unit sphere is the euclidian ~ ~ cube ~ ~ octahedron ( it is the two dimensional space with the l1 norm where the unit circle is an euclidian square ) . 
  yeah , you are n't supposed to be able to reset your kill counter by suiciding to neutrals / ancients / roshan i 'd be too easy to prevent the enemy team to get your streak bounty . 
  that 'd be consistent with my preventive treatment ispaghul , which is basically a concentrated intake of soluble fibers before breakfast and diner . 
  it 's amazing , tastes pretty ok ( basically drinking a glass of mandarine juice with pulp ) and has no side effect at all for me after one year taking it daily . 
  i hope you rushed double midas . 
  to be fair slark will suck with many skills because he tightly revolves around his initial set of spells . 
  essence shift is fundamental , but then pounce and dark pact too , because they are key to get in position and to escape after getting some stats with essence shift . 
  the way he looks towards the camera when he realizes . 
  if it 's fake , it 's well put . 
  i mean , he took them to second place at ti and that 's what he gets in return ? 
  i like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t4q8gpb.jpg ) , it has that good ol' minmatar flying wreck feeling . 
  quel courage, 
  black friday got its name from the fact that it was the day of the year which single handedly brought their account of many businesses from red , which meant they were losing money , to black . 
  does it taste like a butter i did n't know existed ? 
  well , at least it 's free,
