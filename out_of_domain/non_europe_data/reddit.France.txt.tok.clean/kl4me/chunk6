  several * months * later she found out what it means and was really upset . 
  she thought it was basically just a custom `` bang , gotcha ! '', 
  we made up . 
  when she told us she had just recently learned what it meant and that she was pissed about it , you know what we all responded together . . 
  indeed , the foreskin and the skin covering the penis is darker for the same reason . 
  i ca n't imagine the pain of a nice big sunburn in that area d :, 
  no 3 is good because the brain is super flexible . 
  i 'd practice guitar technique like an alien , i 'd be the youngest published author in mathematics in the history of man , but i would also most likely end up being the first ~ ~ 10 years ~ ~ 13 years old being ~ ~ condamned ~ ~ sentenced for sexual harrassement on an adult . 
  i mean could you wait so long ? 
  edit : grammar and puberty, 
  well in that case they could just put a google/reddit function search so the search tool would behave like google restricted to reddit.com , could n't they ? 
  i am well aware of this controversy but to my defense : a big proportion of comics reaching frontpage use it , and also i 'm fucking french so i could n't resist d :, 
  haha sorry mistranslation from my part !, 
  the correct word is condemned but it should actually be `` sentenced '' if i understand it correctly . 
  and btw , best username ever !, 
  i do n't know why you get downvoted for asking questions !, 
  it is very fascinating , especially because of the data deluge caused by massive development of it technology . 
  the only thing that is susceptible to process so much data is the brain : it processes like 10 frame per seconds , each frame being 100 megapixels ( at least in the center of the image ) and the processing is just perfect ( you basically understand everything that you see : textures , structures , object recognition , movement analysis , light ) . 
  the same when you read an article : your brain uses your memory to interpret the text , identify what it is about , classify information , and this completely automatically . 
  trying and teach that to a computer , or mathematically modeling it is a very fascinating and challenging task !, 
  the theory on marcellus ` soul basically says that his soul was exctracted from his neck , thus the band aid ( similar to a biblical fact i think ) . 
  he gave it to the guys for some business ( as payment , guarantee ? 
  i do n't know ) and sent his man take it back after the deal went wrong . 
  it would explain the evil code 666 of the briefcase , and also the fascinated reaction of people looking at it . 
  how in hell is this possible ? 
  getting away from a stage 4 metastasized cancer , whatever the type ( even though lung is one of the most deadly ) ... 
  it is truly amazing , of course for your mom and your family , but also for what it represents as a way to beat what was thought to be unbeatable . 
  congrats to her !, 
  dear americans , i love your politics . 
  it is like reality show , but it is real life , and the whole world will be affected by your choices ( not saying you govern us all , but obviously you play an important role on the international scene ) . 
  it is just amazing , and the most amazing is that it is working . 
  i now of course that everything is not working perfectly , and some things are not woring at all , it is the case for every country . 
  but it is incredible to see on one hand that your nation is mature enough to elect a black president even though the question of integration of black people is a very sensitive social issue , and on the other hand you see a senator suddenly claming `` lol baby rape is not rape '' . 
  i think it is reflecting the deep freedom of speech you are building your nation on . 
  it is fascinating . 
  for the number i am actually talking about the framerate of a single eye cell , the global framerate of the brain is much harder to estimate because what you mention is images related to each others ( like in videogame or movie , the images are very similar one after the other in general ) . 
  i mention the framerate at which you can distinguish two completely different image . 
  the resolution of the eye is also hard to estimate and is absolutely not constant but i am positive that this is what was taught to me in class . 
  i tried to check and what i found tend to confirm a number above 100 mp in the center of the eye . 
  also the eye contains two kind of sensors which makes the calculation even more complicated ^ ^, 
  you are right about the fluid mechanics part , it is incredibly costly in computational time and people have been strugling with navier-stockes equations for so long . 
  that sound reasonable to me as on average , there are approximately 125 million rod cells in the human retina . 
  it would deserve to check with a real biologist though , as this is fare from being my field !, 
  op , i ** know ** i love you . 
  same here . 
  i was 13-14 when i read it and just started falling in love with a girl of the same age . 
  our relationship carried on until 21 ( with 1 big brake up and one year that she spent on another continent and we decided to put a term to our relationship , that incontrolably started again with more passion when she got back ) . 
  my feelings about that book are completely mixed with the one i had for her , which makes his dark materials so special to me . 
  i spent years on a complex mmorpg that required literally months before being able to evolve autonomously in the game . 
  one of the best feeling was being able to help new players to enjoy the game . 
  of course there is less depth when you teach during a cs game because the time you spend with players is much smaller , and the directions to give are much simpler . 
  at most , when i do n't have time or do n't feel like it , i just ignore beginning players . 
  but in general i try to help , and i totally agree with op 's advice . 
  insulting a new player is just like mocking a 4 year-old because he can not be as good as you . 
  it is just very very stupid . 
  not understanding that new players need advices is very stupid . 
  you can refuse to help them but condemning them for looking help is very stupid . 
  if you do n't like new players , you should help them so they become good players . 
  would it be wise to refer them to this subreddit ? 
  or do you think it might complicate things even more because people would n't know how to use reddit ? 
  edit : grammars , tpyo , frgotten leters and other, 
  sw , you make me proud to be a redditor !, 
  yeah as a president , and in addition during campaign , he has in mind few dozens of important political questions and elements of answer related to them . 
  it is like many jobs actually . 
  you often know what a specific audience is going to be interested in when you are good at your job . 
  it does n't mean he copy/pasted , but you could n't expect him to never had thought about the issues raised in the questions of the ama . 
  oh yeah , right , money , i forgot . 
  well this is a pretty solid argument . 
  maybe they could just add a short indication on the search page telling people how to restric google search to reddit . 
  by the way , is it really useful to know whether the search worked or not ? 
  or was it a benchmark feature at the beginning that became useless when they stopped to develop the search tool ? 
  what is the current radius ? 
  is it smaller ? 
  i feel like it is but it has been years since i played 1.6 . 
  a little precision though : the farmer said that chickren ** begin ** to die after 15 minutes . 
  the electricity stayed off during several hours , which explains the number of dead chicken . 
  also , 70k chicken for 20k usd ? 
  it means 28 cents per chicken . 
  holly cow . 
  edit : wrote children instead of chicken : /, 
  yes i had the same feeling , but i think in this situation that it is more important to have your position explained . 
  yes you are slightly too agressive , but it is not so often that media accept this point of view to be expressed . 
  i regularly see media and public opinion diffuse and accept ideas that are completely manipulated , very badly explained , or just sometimes simply wrong or totally inaccurate just in order to be catchy and to spread widely . 
  the topic of influence of videogames on personality and social behavior is one of the most emblematic , especially because a huge majority of people writing about it have simply never gamed and never documented themselves about this question . 
  when you look at the passed , you see indeed that violence was just much more common before . 
  and before videogames , people could ruin themselves with plenty of other things . 
  there is even no statistics that show that violence somehow increased with the spreading of gaming . 
  but what do you want ? 
  people are affraid of the unknown . 
  when i get depressed by this , i remember that lots of people were trying to prevent printing from spreading , arguing that it would allow anyone to print books and thus that any tupi thought would spread without control . 
  hum , maybe they were right about the writer of the original article -_- ', 
  it is a great song . 
  incredible . 
  it is from far the most spread 5/4 timed song , and it took me maybe 15 years before realizing it was indeed 5/4 , just when i learned to play it . 
  it is amazing how the rhythm sounds natural , yet it is using a quite rare signature . 
  i am just a diamond player ( but i am proud about the fact that i got diamond playing random !, 
  it is so much fun ) but i think this is safe to give you this advice . 
  you have to focus on your macro first . 
  learn few build orders , maybe 3 : one to play against each race . 
  there are standard opening that are very basic and strong .
