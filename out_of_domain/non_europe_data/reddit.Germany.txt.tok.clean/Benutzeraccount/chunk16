  take a photo of it, 
  so am i, 
  wow , so the phone would crack the pavement and probably would even left a crater . 
  burn in cornfirmed, 
  yeah well , that 's not how it works . 
  espacially for an bar shaped object . 
  consider winds , flapping and turning . 
  and the small surface of the object . 
  getting hit by the phone would hurt but not kill . 
  have you heard that you can kill people by throwing pennies from the empire state building ? 
  yeah , that wo n't work , too . 
  / r/speedwobbles, 
  yeah . 
  you know , all the able men were at war . 
  yeah !, 
  and they gave poor people work and free food !, 
  it 's kinda cool . 
  but what bugs me is how the people who got literally anything get even more : /, 
  `` yay , sword quest !, 
  i already own a copy , but still ! '', 
  i 'm amazed , you found my comment buried in the downvote abyss . 
  it 's most probably a trojan or something . 
  so it erm ... kinda fits here / s, 
  yeah , i know :(, 
  just buy an old vita bundle from the store . 
  as a german i do n't get why this is called a stein . 
  wo n't watch . 
  what 's the fps ? 
  thanks for the info !, 
  that 's quite decent for the first version . 
  i do n't even know what a stein is :d but it looks fun !, 
  nice hyperlinks, 
  yeah , sorry about that . 
  i tripped on a cable . 
  me too  i 've read dozens of comments until i found yours . 
  gary ? 
  gary . 
  wait , is this for psp games on the vita ? 
  have an upvote for telling the truth . 
  / r/justneckbeardthings, 
  wew , i wonder how often this gets reposted a week, 
  huh ? 
  the treats i 'm buying are n't crumbling . . 
  yes but is the ps3 a vita ? 
  can tell no so please advice, 
  have fun between orgasms, 
  this is weird . 
  search screenteam on youtube, 
  unfortunatly not :(, 
  breaking !, 
  busted !, 
  final blow !, 
  aaaaand it 's my new wallpaper . 
  thanks !, 
  the landmasses of the us and europe are about the same ( 10 million square km ), 
  name it paul . 
  or steve . 
  not this picture again, 
  what about cultures where you do n't tell you helped someone ? 
  this is a trick question . 
  there were n't any games by the year of 200 . 
  / r/de, 
  yeah ? 
  not sure if troll, 
  looks like too many filters, 
  nice . 
  / r/fellowkids, 
  nice , have n't seen that photo this week, 
  wrong subreddit, 
  i do n't remember the snes being widescreen and full hd, 
  i 'd like to know what the colors mean in detail . 
  what does it mean when a vpn got a yellow technical configuration ? 
  also , what about speed or volume limits ? 
  what about blocked ports or services ? 
  i 'm confirming it 's mostly boner, 
  that 's too vague for me, 
  you see , a yellow field at ` blocks p2p ' could either mean that some ports are blocked or the speed is throttled . 
  or there is a data cap . 
  just a yellow field tells about nothing . 
  nope . . maybe it 's because i 'm on mobile . 
  sorry , i did n't know there 's text !, 
  please try to grab the screen instead of filming it . 
  ... hacking ? 
  is n't like most stuff from the 50s and 60s looking like stuff from fallout ? 
  that 's a crazy assumption !, 
  mind = blown, 
  it 's not death it 's firmware, 
  awful, 
  from what year is it ? 
  thank god it 's censored, 
  prove !, 
  thanks !, 
  nope , too messy, 
  yeah , and dealing with high voltage without any protection or so . 
  come to me and say that into my face !, 
  well , ok !, 
  that 's fine to me . 
  where do you live ? 
  i thought it gets reposted every two days . 
  got ta check the schedule .
