  that 's what i think , too . 
  i think the mexicans are onto something, 
  great rehab !, 
  weird enough , you look a lot younger in the right photo . 
  oh , interessant !, 
  oh , interessant !, 
  * raises tits *, 
  bait taken, 
  meh , poor skaling and uneven pixels . 
  does not work . 
  says application error . 
  the grammar of the german text is awful . 
  wrong and awful . 
  top : `` totes judekind '' should be `` totes jude ** n ** kind '', 
  you should avoid saying `` judenkind '' though , since it kinda sounds like a racial slur . 
  use `` j\u00fcdisches kind '' instead . 
  left , under the picture : `` durch seine augen '', 
  i have no idea what this even means . 
  first of all it should be `` durch ** s ** eine augen '' , furthermore well . . since i do n't know what they try to say i have no idea what to make out of this sentence . 
  middle section : '' ... hitlers regierung . . '' - this translates to ` hitler 's government . 
  the english text kinda fits better calling it `` hitler 's reign '' . 
  - kinda hard to understand , too . 
  ( this ash shall you remind you of this ) . 
  `` dieses hier '' makes no sense . 
  greetings !, 
  tja , / r/de halt .

  every account on reddit is a bot except you .

  yup , this . 
  is it rude because many soldiers simply lost count while killing ? 
  that 's normal , the game gear depletes a full set of batteries in seconds . 
  reported, 
  reported, 
  see your text on the top, 
  that 's right . 
  you 're forced to kill people over and over . 
  until you die . 
  i disliked them . 
  they killed the last bit of lore for me . 
  it just felt everything but fallout . 
  hi dad , i 'm gay, 
  you know , grilled cheese sandwich are n't even common in the netherlands, 
  edit : it 's common to some, 
  apparently so . 
  they somehow allow pretty strong artificial coloring . 
  kek, 
  the only thing i like on her is the time stamp,

  nuclear plants are n't alternate energy , lol, 
  i remember killing him , too .

  scrolling around the track even give different patterns !, 
  i think you mean `` i stuffed a raspberry pi into a lynx shell '', 
  i am not theories, 
  i 'm working in the inner city and we have employees just to scare the bums away and power wash their shit , vomit and pee away every morning . 
  spikes are n't allowed here but they would be useful . 
  just curious , do you make the models by yourself or do you download them ? 
  you need to run around even more and wiggle the camera faster, 
  is nasa a country or france an agency ? 
  yeah , me too . 
  rushing to the screen when they 're showing interesting things though :d, 
  you can never watch this . 
  awesome !, 
  i just tore apart a battery pack off my old laptop since it was dead anyway . 
  thinking about replacing the cells , but they 're kinda expensive . 
  i wonder if that crippling trick works in real life , too, 
  yeah , unfortunately . 
  and they 're shaking hands like businessmen, 
  stop reposting this,
