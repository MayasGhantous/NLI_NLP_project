imagine how delicious pharaoh jerky is . 
  like a good wine . 
  the first oil resources chart confused me at first because you used blue for germany and green for russia before that . 
   russian hating , nazi government the west but into power, 
  the crimean referendum ( = russian annexation of crimea ) happened in march 2014 . 
  elections were held in may . 
  to me the text looks exactly as expected at that resolution and distance . 
  i found one of the images in higher resolution : http://i.imgur.com/92vyrpv.jpg, 
  feng 's work ethic is really what inspires and motivates me most . 
  watch the other episodes if you do n't know what i mean . 
  vault-tec trading card game ? 
  do they all use that same pic ? 
  she said there would be a top down view . 
  so we will know if it was fake or not eventually . 
  judging from this image and the first screenshot it 's safe to say that attachments will be a thing . 
  also , the screenshot had a different rifle in that same spot : http://i.imgur.com/p5vqk1e.jpg, 
   there is no war if no one shows up to fight it, 
  the iraqi army tried this approach in the last few months . 
  did n't work out too well for the civilian population . 
  you know , the ones going down a real , moral education/career path . 
  what are you doing to photoshop to make it crash ? 
  have n't had a crash in years . 
  my mother played fallout 3 and new vegas . 
  i do n't think she would have without vats . 
  if you do n't like it do n't use it . 
  i do n't need or like vats but why on earth would it bother me ? 
  i hope bethesda understands that vats makes the game more accessible ( = larger audience = more sales ) and that it 's worth keeping . 
  even worse . 
  a guy who wants to turn an fps rpg into a pure fps . 
  there is no good reason for it . 
  green tint mod will be the first mod . 
  i guarantee it . 
  i 've talked about this with my strongly pro-russian friend more than once . 
  basically the west is just that much better at propaganda and those journalists leaving rt & others are all liars . 
  i was n't serious . 
  the west has more resources , yes . 
  but that does n't prove that the west is using those resources to influence ( or even control ) the media or non-profit organizations . 
  according to you ( and also according to my pro-russian friend ) the west is controlling western media even more than russia is controlling its own media . 
  there are more than just a few cases of russian journalists talking about russia 's propaganda . 
  [ remember the rt journalist who resigned on air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h79v9uirly ) ? 
  what about [ this journalist ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/18/mh17-russia-today-reporter-resigns-sara-firth-kremlin-malaysia ) ? 
  or the [ woman who claimed to have worked as a russian `` internet troll '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11656043/my-life-as-a-pro-putin-propagandist-in-russias-secret-troll-factory.html ) ? 
  where are those cases in the west ? 
  if the us and nato were indeed controlling all of the western media there should be 10 times as many cases . 
  somebody else noticed this before : http://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4/comments/38h27u/in_case_you_didnt_notice_but_really_this_means/, 
  what 's interesting about this ? 
  * they likely made the trailer first and changed the weapon next to the chair later . 
  [ as op already pointed out ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4/comments/39c7ya/different_rifles_between_the_trailer_and_the/cs28wbp ), 
  * [ the weapon the player character holds ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vd3mvvd.png ) in the trailer is the same one that is next to the chair in [ this screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pwlbufg.jpg ) . 
  * both weapons were already done at the time of the trailer . 
  they either wanted to show a different weapon in the 4k screenshot or they changed it because the environment will actually be in the game . 
  the ( possibly modified ) hunting rifle might be a higher level weapon while the rifle shown in the trailer / 4k screenshot is a low level starter weapon . 
  my guess is that they will sell them on consoles while they remain free on pc . 
  valve already did this with the crash course dlc for left 4 dead . 
  as far as i know microsoft also does n't allow just any content on xbox , which means bethesda needs to test and approve mods . 
  my two favorite concept art collections :, 
  we might hear about the events of fallout 3 on fallout 4 's radio . 
  perhaps even from three dog himself ? 
  i also do n't understand why people are so upset . 
  we do n't know yet what the system will be like . 
  the important thing is that there is progression . 
  in fallout 3/nv i was always more excited for the next perk than the next ~ 15 skillpoints . 
  most skills had no immediate benefit anyway and only a small number had `` milestones '' ( science , lockpick , do n't remember if there were any others ) . 
  instead of spending 10 points on barter not knowing what the benefit is , you might actually know exactly what you will get . 
  ( for example : `` all items cost 5 % less '' ), 
  i always had a mod that made stimpaks heal over time . 
  here are two such mods :, 
  if it 's not in the game then mods will add it . 
  if they give him a copy they will have to make it * very * clear that it 's a one time thing . 
  i was on the fence before but now i 'm going to buy the game for sure . 
  the weapon looks like the same one we 've seen in the [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pwlbufg.jpg ) ( on the left ), 
  very relevant , from zhirinovsky 's wikipedia page :, 
   according to reuters , `` although nominally part of the russian opposition , he is widely seen as a servant of kremlin policy , used to float radical opinions to test public reaction . '', 
   suri is reportedly quite close to being labeled a `` suppressive person '' by the church, 
  i just had to look this up . 
  his daughter is apparently 8 years old . 
  i told you i looked it up . 
  looks like you value that moment when you exit the vault and step into the light as much as i do . 
   also , one type of dlc which they use to incentivise pre-orders is an extra playable level , sometimes . 
  it 's ready by release , so what they 're actually doing is just artificially cutting out a portion of the ` complete ' game , and only selling 90 % of their product to non-preorders . 
  which is bad . 
  the company profits from getting the money earlier ( cash flow ) . 
  `` they are only selling 90 % of the game if you do n't preorder '' is one way to look at it . 
  not all companies let you preorder unfinished products . 
  i should have said : not all companies let you preorder games that are going to be a broken mess on the release date . 
  preordering is no excuse for this anyway . 
  they can always delay the release date . 
  and of course nasa is n't interested because conspiracy ? 
  to me it looks like a rock . 
  and this may be the wrong sub for you if you believe in nasa conspiracies . 
  so why did nasa ever start using high-res cameras ? 
  is russia in on the conspiracy ? 
  what about china ? 
  and if they are in on it could n't nasa ( and all the others ) have lied and told everyone `` high-res cameras do n't work because of radiation ! '', 
   current day data transmission methods are much more sophisticated than 1959 . 
  there are complex error correction aspects of data transmission protocols that mathematically recreated missing data packets based on cyclic redundancy checksums , etc. 
  and anyway you are comparing 2 different scales of images here . 
  rover images should be compared to other rover images ( very small distance per pixel ) , not to satellite images ( very large distance per pixel ) . 
  again , if they have so much to hide why use those `` sophisticated data transmission methods '' ? 
  why not lie and say it does n't work and keep the old , blurry imaging methods ?
