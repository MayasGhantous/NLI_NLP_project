  but it 's also ironic that the only quest i played ( twice ) before giving up on the game is apparently the best quest in the game . 
  guess i saw all there is to see . 
  they should have learned how to do x from the witcher, 
  i 'm not sure why bethesda even has to look for people to hire !, 
  all the greatest minds of the industry are in that thread !, 
  yes , it is ai . 
  you should look up the definition of ai, 
  or let its robots run for president of the us ... 
  next version will be bug-free , i promise, 
  i 'm tired of it too . 
  they should replace the post apocalyptic setting with medieval eastern europe and replace the guns with swords and crossbows . 
  perhaps add more boobs and replace the main character with a grumpy , white-haired dude . 
  that would really raise the bar . 
  cool . 
  thanks !, 
  will look for the ebook later, 
  i just saw that too . 
  my theory is that the fallout subs are overflowing with hate so they 're going through all the other subs that start with the letter f, 
  thank you kind sir for actually having a legitimate comment and not acting like im in the wrong . 
  and yeah obsidian needs to make fallout again, 
   all developers put love into their games . 
  it 's the managers and accountants you have to watch out for . 
  yes !, 
  this is where the evil is happening !, 
  real devs do n't try to make money !, 
  they 're a bunch of landlubbers , that 's why, 
   yeah , they were small patches . 
  pretty standard stuff , just marketed really well . 
  not just small patches but full beards !, 
  nv 's metacritic score would be roughly 5 times higher if it was n't for todd, 
   i like how they consider it `` lost '' when other studies have shown that pirates tend to pirate more with things they would not have normally purchased in the first place , meaning that the developer/publisher/seller did n't lose any sales , because they did n't actually have more potential sales in those pirates to begin with . 
  you do n't really consider people who have 0 interest in your product and are not expected to buy it as a loss . 
  but even those people may take the product for free if given the chance ; whether that chance is legitimate or not . 
  people pirate things they are not interested in ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the people who compulsively pirate stuff ( which they have zero interest in ! ), 
  are going to control themselves and not buy something when there is no other option ... 
  yes . 
  if you 've ever even tried to make a mod at the same level of quality as the base game ( like skyrim , fallout 4 , half-life 2 , or any other aaa game ) , you know just how much you do n't know / ca n't do . 
  no , modders ca n't make anything like the automatron dlc in less than 4 months . 
  if they could , why would bethesda even * pay * anyone to work for them ? 
   lies , the game is already translated if you play on a english account they simply cock-blocked the rest of the world so their q2 would look very profitable this practice is not new ,, 
  they literally stopped the jerk, 
  i can see one : allowing a company to produce another game or perhaps additional free content by not letting it go bankrupt . 
  those are probably the worst images you could produce to highlight the difference . 
  they 're super low res and blurry which kind of counters chromatic aberration, 
  witcher 3 has an o b j e c t i v el y bad combat system . 
  after like 3 hours i decided my actual work is a lot more fun and feels less like work than witchfucking 3 's combat . 
  also battlefront for life, 
   hmm ... 
  i created my own geralt look-alike , and i 'm trying to play the game as much like him as possible . 
  which faction do you think he 'd choose ? 
  i 'm thinking borderline-railroad . 
  works with them , but not 100 % dedicated and with them . 
  please no witcher 3 spoilers if you reply , i have yet to play the witcher 3, 
  the only way to play the game, 
  fallout 4 is just black and white ( how de we know what 's right and wrong without karma ? ), 
  luckily , witcher 3 is like 50 shades of grey . 
   `` drop 110 $ if you want everything '', 
  holy shit for 110 $ i can go grocery shopping for like a month [ +3 ], 
  maybe you should do it then . 
  i would n't want to be part of why you starve to death , fool, 
  edit : also :, 
   or ... or ... maybe if the developers did not like money so much , than they would make it one game ... like one single game for once ... 
  i am tired of buying 100 pieces to a 500 piece puzzle and the producers going `` sorry that $ 10 puzzle was just the first 100 pieces and the rest are $ 500 for the entire budge or $ 100 per extra 100 pieces '', 
  the whole `` this should have been part of the game for $ 0 '' idea is so annoying . 
  people really , really do n't get that there is a cost associated with that content . 
  when a newer car than the one you own comes out , you do n't ever hear anyone say `` everything in this car should have been in the car i bought 5 years ago '' . 
  what kind of logic is that ? 
  those people know that there are free games out there , right ? 
  oh i forgot ... they do n't want to play them because they 're not good enough for them . 
  going to start playing again when the new survival beta is available, 
  the new save system is my favorite . 
  it forces you to plan ahead . 
   this is a feature, 
  this sounds to me like it 's going to remain disabled . 
  but one purpose of this beta is to get feedback from players , so it might be coming back . 
  it says in the in-game help menu that strong back lvl 4 ( paraphrasing ) `` disables additional damage you take from carrying too much weight '', 
  it does replace the old mode but you have to opt into the beta first . 
  even if the final survival mode is out you can probably switch to very hard difficulty before loading your save to avoid this, 
  they said the new survival mode is going to be on consoles next month, 
  ah , a pre-war movie prop, 
  thanks . 
  i 've been following this drama too . 
  there 's also this : http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11479/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nexusmods.com%2ffallout4%2fajax%2fmoddescription%2f%3fid%3d11479%26preview%3d&amp;pup=1, 
  `` stop messing with my mods '' . 
  that 's right ... how dare bethesda make a beta test on * their * terms !!, 
  and some more paranoia on bethesda 's own forums : https://community.bethesda.net/thread/2936?start=0&amp;tstart=0, 
  a bethesda employee in that topic said mods are n't disabled on purpose . 
  ( see first post ) - forum users conclude that * they 're going to take away our mods * . 
  one user also points out that the game is sending data to a bethesda server . 
  this is of course proof that bethesda is `` going to lock out the nexus '' . 
  ( post # 63 in that topic ) . 
  because why would a beta test send data to the server of the company that is running the test ?? 
  if you think they 've got a point here ... maybe take a look at the steam subscriber agreement ( the beta is only available on steam after all ) and do ctrl + f `` beta '' . 
  took me two minutes . 
  comment from / r/falloutmods :, 
   bethesda looks to be sticking their dick into the beehive again . 
  only this time , they 're looking to shove their balls in as well . 
  god help them if they actually try to lockout nexus .
