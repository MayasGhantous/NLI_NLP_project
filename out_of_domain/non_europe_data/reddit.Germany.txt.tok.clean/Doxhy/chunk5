  also , bethesda 's material editor can be opened from the ck . 
  it 's html based , so it opens in your browser . 
  it 's the colorful button right under the `` world '' menu at the top of the ck . 
  it might seem expensive at first ... but dirty , land-based consoles wo n't let you save money through piracy like this rig here, 
  i can fix that, 
  i heard this game ships without a thank you note : / dealbreaker, 
  whats the difference between a simulation of intelligences and actual intelligence ? 
  already done that when i upgraded to 10 ( i had to ) , but i 've reinstalled the driver and i 'm going to avoid chrome for now and see if that is the cause, 
  i think i solved it . 
  looks like the bluescreens were caused by malwarebytes, 
  it 's okay because ... well , automod , tell them . . ^ no ^ man 's ^ sky, 
  this is just a little sad . 
  immersion , i.e. 
  forgetting everything around you ( and most of all your own pitiful existence ) , is more important than fun . 
  it explains a lot of the negativity in gaming communities though, 
  also the second pic from the top is straight out of a porno , is n't it ? 
  do n't forget * lackluster *, 
  any hint what it 's about ? 
  thanks !, 
  it 's okay if you buy it for $ 5 in about 10 years, 
   so you admit games nowadays are dumbed down to cater for certain target groups ? 
  i felt like bethesda and developers made the `` right '' choice for all gamers by adding quest markers . 
  at least , that 's the picture i get from entitled gamers who believe games should n't have directions , instead of having both and being able to optionally turn on quest markers ... 
  they decided that the majority of gamers do n't want to follow directions , so they did n't create any . 
  this is simply design , not `` dumbing down '' . 
  you 're not a genius for being able to follow a few directions, 
   developers should n't be too wild about denuvo -- it 's basically a death sentence for your game 's viability as a historical piece of art . 
  i have not met many developers who do n't care about what they do , which is the sort of attitude you 'd have to have to like denuvo . 
  what do you have to say about this ? 
  people who like denuvo are sociopaths . 
  do any of the experiments turn settlers hostile ? 
  yesterday i came back to my settlement and 3 settlers randomly attacked me . 
  nobody cared when i killed them either, 
  download is going to take longer than the actual game xd, 
  that was the first thing i checked for , but no synth components on any of them . 
  it was also hilarious how they ran away the second i attacked them . 
  ( first thing i do with every settler who arrives is take away their guns ... which turned out to be a wise decision ), 
  i dont believe it . 
  pc gaming is supposed to be all about choice ^ to ^ pirate, 
  you mean missed opportunities ? 
  seriously . 
  if you 're going to get on your knees in front of geraldo you can do better than to pray, 
   every single time i talk to some brigader from there , they constantly bitch about how dude bros ruined gaming , how gamers are entitled for asking anything from a corporation , how pc gamers are ruining everything with their fancy rigs , and how gamers are entitled to mods from a modder or else its elitism . 
  pc gamers and their big rigs are ruining gaming guys . 
  there is so much bullshit in that post wow !, 
  amazing !, 
  all those people accusing us !, 
  he 's gcj 's best agent . 
  when he 's not out there shitposting for us , he 's brigading innocent subs like / r/nomansskythegame, 
   next time keep your shit opinion to yourself . 
  you owe it to these wonderful and amazing devs to give them a big ass thumbs up for giving you this masterpiece and all of the dlc for such an amazing price about 20 add ons are free `` cdpr is all about money now '' no friend you 're just a whiny cunt who ca n't wait for a patch to fix something bite the bullet and get down on your knees and pray to cdpr for forgiveness you shit stain, 
  fun is just a buzzword, 
  true , but it might not compare to gtav . 
  rockstar was already well established and well organized . 
  a lot of kickstarter games waste a ton of money just redoing assets ( and whole levels ) for the 5th time , etc. 
  i do n't expect that star citizen is any different here . 
  and i can already hear pcmr crying about optimization . 
  remember what it was like with crysis 1 ? 
  ( seems fitting because star citizen is even using cryengine too ) . 
  i recall crytek 's ceo cevat yerli saying something like `` not everyone can afford a porsche '' . 
  people were incredibly pissed about that comment . 
  imagine the amount of salt if star citizen turns out to be a lamborghini, 
  ** sean `` todd '' molyneaux ** was an actor before he made ** one man 's lie ** : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sean_murray_ ( actor ), 
  is this how he perfected his lies ? 
  get out of my sub normie reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  bees are objectively bad . 
  their bright yellow color is cartoonish and juvenile . 
  it 's the opposite of a morally mature gray . 
  and who cares about the ecosystem ? 
  preordering and dlc will have destroyed the planet long before bees are extinct . 
  sean murray did nothing wrong, 
  real , mature games have to be ridiculously difficult and frustrating to discourage stupid casuals who ca n't git gud . 
  they ca n't have any feature that requires creativity ( dae stupid artists ? ) . 
  they must not look pretty ( only boobs and butts must be high res ) , because that would mean the developer favored graphics and art instead of devoting precious development time to real , morally gray dialogues and stories . 
  / uj i really , really hate this idea that accessible and/or `` artistic '' games are for stupid people only . 
  fuck you . 
  you are not some ubermensch because you enjoy the story more than the gameplay . 
  many of us play * games * for the * game * play . 
  can you imagine how annoying those people would be if they discovered books ? 
  ( no stupid art in books either , just photorealistic 8k paper textures ), 
  edit : i do n't know how to link , sorry, 
  thanks !, 
  video games nowadays are so dumbed down . 
  only idiots need things like graphics . 
  we need to return video games to their true form . 
  we need to go back to text adventures !, 
  dae gamebryo 10 billion years old ? 
  wow . 
  you do n't even have to justify anything . 
  you did n't have to perform at the 2016 mental gymnastics olympics because you personally disqualified the entire jury . 
  you are to piracy what sovereign citizens are to tax evasion . 
  no need to find loopholes !, 
  the government had no right to tax you to begin with !, 
  you are n't in the wrong !, 
  reality is wrong !, 
  when life gives you lemonades dont make lemonade1 !, 
  make life take the lemons back ! 1 get mad !, 
  i dont want your damn lemons !, 
  what am i supposed to do with these ?!, 
  demand to see life 's manager !,
