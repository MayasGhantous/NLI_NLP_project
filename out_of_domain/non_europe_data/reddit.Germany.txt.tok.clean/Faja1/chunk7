  when you 're looking in the mirror after the race you will see somebody very happy , exhausted and maybe ` stupid ' but runners and sportsman are fair people , they wo n't laugh at you . 
  if anything , they will congratulate you for making it . 
  great , 
  well , would you say the same about your friends cousin ? 
  it 's an odd but nice starter and makes for a funny story in a few years , 
  but she does n't walk by and says hi . . 
  well go for it, 
  sounds great , does n't it ? 
  right ? 
  who gives a shit ? 
  is n't like 100-200 real friends and family more than enough ? 
  in comparison to 5000 . . 
  but yes . 
  10 is perfectly fine . 
  i am above 10 , but that 's because of my family . 
  what kind of paint is that ? 
  to be fair , all the article and the linked article are doing is stating the silence in western press and that putin said `` something '' . 
  both articels do not answer the question which g20 members putin was talking about . 
  because she said so !, 
  no you 're physically in the same ` condition ' as before . 
  as well as reading a book does n't make you 2 dimensional . 
  bite off a piece of my skin on my lip . 
  i dont know why . 
  i know that i decided to not do that again years ago . . 
  whats beer bread ? 
  how did you do the 200 pictures without loosing the galaxy ? 
  sorry for that question , i am going to try the same the day after tomorrow and i am new to this . . 
  thanks !, 
  one more question though . 
  did you have to adjust your camera for the 200 exposures ? 
  backstory : my dad has a genetic disorder which highers the risk of blood clotting , he found out about it after a thrombosis about 5 yrs ago . 
  a year ago my aunt , his sister , too had a thrombosis ( without any disorder ) . 
  after my grandma heard about that she sais , that it is weird that both her kids had a thrombosis and my dad even a genetic disorder since her dad was a doctor eugenics during in nazi-germany . 
  it was quite a shock , i did n't know about that . 
  and it is a bit sad that she is drawing a connection there . 
  she is 87 now . 
  last one ( tickle fight ) is basically how i closed the deal with my two gfs in highschool . 
  do you mean the fact or that my grandma said it ? 
  i was shocked that my great-grandfather was that involved . 
  although , apperantly he could have gotten a much higher position but that would have meant to divorce his half jewish wife . 
  so thats a small plus i guess . . 
  i did n't do any research . 
  maybe i should , my grandad got into our family history . 
  i could ask my dad whether he kept his documents . . 
  haha :d its all history now but thanks, 
  warwick castle ? 
  and there will be more room for the rest of us on the road . 
  i 'd call that change . . 
  wake up !, 
  need an update !, 
  also , will they let him board when drunk ? 
  you can have a beer at the airport , but you ca n't be shitfaced when boarding , can you ? 
  i like that the fuck up is the fist-bump and not the fact that you told your gf that you fisted another girl . 
  i thought the boarding-people at the gate might hold you back . 
  apparently they do n't . 
  and still the only one , i am a bit disappointed . 
  well excuse me but i think the same !, 
  she 's beautiful !, 
  damn !, 
  i hate wet socks . 
  its the worst !, 
  when reading it i was singing the alphabet . 
  it worked out great, 
  i keep getting vouchers for the alcoholic drinks . 
  it 's nice , 
  i have given up on that . 
  now it 's just `` i hope i wo n't dring that much again '' . 
  it works out okay i guess . 
  i have this thought only once or twice per year . 
  `` heil '' and `` heal '' are differntly pronounced . 
  `` heil '' just means `` heal '' . 
  in the greeting `` heil hitler '' it probably meant something like wishing he is well , but `` heil '' can also be an imperative meaning `` go and heal him '' . 
  sorry , i do n't realy get your question but i would pronounce `` heal '' with an i as in `` with '' , a little more streched maybe . 
  the `` ei '' in `` heil '' on the other hand is more like the english word `` eye '' , so you would pronounce it `` h-eye-l '', 
  edit : just a copy from wictionary : heil is pronounce [ ha\u026a\u032fl ] and heal is pronounced / hi\u02d0l /, 
  to heal is heilen , pronounced [ \u02c8ha\u026a\u032fl\u0259n ], 
  not sure if troll . 
  but since the tab is still open , here you go https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/datei:de-heilen.ogg, 
  you can eat the pizza because you work out , 
  looks great !, 
  so you have a recipe for me ? 
  brilliant , thanks, 
  i got the joke . 
  i was just explaining how this joke was/is possible in the first place , the two different possible interpretations of heil . 
  and apart from that , i was just answering questions . 
  oh , yes that makes some sense . 
  oh yes , that makes some sense now . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  well i 'll just take that as a compliment for my english as i am german myself . 
  and then , how is the english ea - sound close to the german ei-sound ? 
  also , i posted the phonetic pronunciation . . 
  i believe that 's at the miniature museum in hamburg . 
  they also have a harbour , train stations , mountain scenery and all sorts of stuff . 
  it 's actually quite awesome !, 
  i was there just last friday , 
  oh that 's really cool !, 
  thanks, 
  i 'll just go here with any song . 
  any song is the worst song as a ringtone . 
  just use vibrate or some normal ring sound .
