  i do n't use the vpn much either , but the overlay is awesomly versatile , allowing you to facebook-chat while in-game for example or to use a browser , and the game tracking is a small bonus on top of that !, 
  maybe we wo n't even need a catastrophe . 
  just think about how fast technology is - and then think about the archivars ' complaints .

  as we get newer and more sophisticated storage media , their lifespan also decreases . 
  what that means is that people in 100 , 200 years might now more about the 1950s than they will about us and our near future !, 
  think about it . 
  even wikipedia will one day , too , become irrelevant and the servers shut down , replaced by something faster , newer , even better . 
  as we move forward , more and more data is saved digitally . 
  of course we still have books , printed ones , but ebooks are on the rise . 
  in the next 100 years , libraries will be only places printed books certainly wo n't disappear from , even as more and more old books are digitalized . 
  ever heard of the ` paperless office ' ? 
  that 's another trend toward digital . 
  in the end , our ancestors ' knowledge about our time will depend on the few people in the world who focus on digital preservation - but even they will only be able to save an incredible tiny sliver of us . 
  charles stross really toys with this idea in his novel `` glasshouse '' - that 's how i became aware of the issue .

  i think the crucial part was the `` in '', 
  i do ( now ), 
  til there are statistics for such stuff ingame, 
  not 100 % happy with the gloves yet - i 'm planning on replacing them with the cof ones !, 
  that is looking great !, 
  especially for an asura !, 
  one of the few sylvari who actually * look * sylvari . 
  well done !, 
  that char somehow reminds me of wh40k, 
  that helmet is really strange, 
  google has a very handy function - just type in `` xyz [ currency ] in $ '', 
  great collection - have n't seen any of those before . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  no one is , in the beginning . 
  all it takes is perseverance !, 
  do n't you think that would come across as , well ... * needy * ? 
  i 'm not sure recommending him a lecture in logic is quite what he wanted . 
  it may be useful if you are ar emore advanced , but honestly , it does n't help all too much in your daily life !, 
  reviewing your sources , and , most importantly your own beliefs & biases , is what gets you a long way . 
  just try , for example , always to back up everything you claim with hard data . 
  next , try to find data for stuff * other * people claim . 
  we should meet someday . 
  it would be a perfect , neverending spiral of sarcasm, 
  i guess it would be cool if you had something like a meetup ? 
  ... otoh , that would make the shirt kinda superfluous . 
  how do you want to think critically if you ca n't cite sources ? 
  hmm . 
  i surely see your point , but for me critical thinking has always begun with checking * facts * against * claims * - that 's how i assess other people 's arguments, 
  yeah , i see the lawful the samw way as you do - apparently not everyone does . 
  but it 's your analysis i agree with most . 
  i 'd also argue that daleks are lawful evil , since - as you said - they follow their rules to an almost fanatical extent ( remember the dalek that killed himself ? ), 
  it 's taken from d&d - [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alignment_%28dungeons_%26_dragons%29 ), 
  the only reason i visit okcupid is for the awesome statistics . 
  so i have no clue !, 
  oh ... * please * someone make it happen !,

  i 've been playing on the east coast server with test and i had pretty much 0 lag . 
  european superiority high-five !, 
  we did ? 
  wow . 
  i have more lag in lol than in ps2,

  prosieben is a media group , but they also have a tv channel with the same name . 
  and that tv channel is very ... let 's call it trashy and stupid ( most of german tv is , though ), 
  interesting . 
  i downloaded the launcher from the link that was posted here , and i could play on european and american servers . 
  looks like having been in the beta made my account `` special '' ? 
  it does n't ( iirc ), 
  galileo ? 
  i even appeared in that once , as a bystander ;d, 
  but it has gone downhill for the last 3 years , after they started repeating and massive product placement, 
  oh , so it 's only the commercial stuff ? 
  i 'm from germany , so i know pro sieben . 
  i hate them for their media products though , so it might not be as bad as everyone suggests ? 
  my concern is more that they do n't run any aaa games , so they really do n't have experience with anything like planetside, 
  why should we downvote you ... ? 
  the game itself is awesome . 
  ( i played in beta ), 
  it can be very overwhelming at first , but if you take the time , it will grow on you, 
  i 've been playing on the us servers from europe and even i do n't get much lag, 
  looks like we need the germans to rally too !, 
  anyone ? 
  me , and i 've seen one other guy at least, 
  game options -  general -  toggle sprint, 
  we often run our own platoon , and we can then add squads as we like . 
  just join us in the ts channel and it will be sorted out .

  however they seem to have connections to post-rock , as they played the impericon never say die tour, 
  i searched for `` test '' and found nothing .
