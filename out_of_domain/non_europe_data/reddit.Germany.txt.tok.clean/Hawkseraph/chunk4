  i should use google in the future . 
  thanks for the heads-up though !, 
  you can spam the spawn rooms from in there . 
  it might actually have real value !, 
  sounds awesome !, 
  thanks , i 'll check them out, 
  my mouse is some stock mouse which is actually pretty great , even though it only has 2 buttons and no adjustable dpi , it has lasted me some years . 
  for keyboards , i am absolutely in love with my [ logitech illuminated ] ( http://www.amazon.com/logitech-illuminated-ultrathin-keyboard-backlighting/dp/b001f51g16/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1355160325&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+illuminated+keyboard ) . 
  everything i want from a keyboard , you can use it for everything , it got some function keys at the top you can reprogram if you like or maybe just use to control your music while in-game , it has soft and quiet keys , looks awesome . 
  i 'd like to have a sperate game for the europeans , so that we can have better/friendlier times . 
  what evidence we have of those child sacrifices comes mainly from romans - which , as their arch-nemesis , are n't very reliable . 
  what archelogists did find were places ( i.e. 
  the tophet of salammb\u00f3 ) where a lot of children bodies were found , however this can be interpreted as supporting the child sacrifices , * or * you could interpret this as proof of a different perception of children in carthago than in , say , rome , leading to the creation of cemeteries for children ( which was n't a thing in rome ) . 
  the few carthaginian texts which survived do not contain any information about that topic , sadly . 
  you might want to check out the [ social war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_war_%2891%e2%80%9388_bc%29 ) - basically , rome 's allies delcared war on them because they wanted to be treated better ( and be recognized as equals -  citizenship ) . 
  this was in the earlier days of the imperium , and this was with * allies *, 
  firstly , thank you for this post - a truly great analogy !, 
  for everyone that 's interested , i 'd like add something to the scanner topic . 
  while we have n't yet mapped a [ connectome ] ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connectome ) ( a kind of diagram tha tmaps all neurons and their connections ) for humans , we * do * have that for another organism , namely [ c. elegans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caenorhabditis_elegans ) . 
  here is a [ visualization ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/odreiuqzide/5297811473/ ) . 
  c. elegans has 302 neurons with 5000 synapses and the, 
  `` connectome '' has been known for quite some time now . 
  you 'd think we 'd be able to understand how c. elegans ' brain works , right ? 
  nope . 
  the human brain has 10 ^ 11 neurons each with on the, 
  order of thousands of synapses . 
  to put it in the terms of / u/joy _ indescribable 's analogy , we ca n't even build a fucking toy plane . 
  the last ludum dare had villainy as its theme .

  tom the cruise, 
  one of my class mates back in high school actually had a sticker on her notebook with that cover . 
  i really loved that picture ( even though back then i had no clue what it was about ) . 
  so when i stumbled upon it again i was intrigued by that feeling of recognition , and gave the album a listen , even though it 's out of the scope of what i usually listen too . 
  i 'm glad i did !, 
  my favourite song from that album is [ lyrical lies ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mpwzpefoaas ), 
  thanks for that , always good to see there are still some links that are true to the spirit of this subreddit , and not just `` funny quotes '', 
  looks like he 's a patrician ? 
  yup , it 's a bug . 
  do n't holy war republics , i suppose , until the hotfix is out, 
  concerning the question : i think human relationships are the most important thing there is . 
  you world * begins * with you , it should n't * end * with you . 
  where 's the fun in being the same all the time ? 
  we make our meaning ourselves , we create amazingness for ourselves . 
  if your fun depends on other people , you need them . 
  if it does n't , you do n't, 
  i moved to university ( which would be the equivalent to your college , if you live in the us of a ) last year . 
  i moved quite far away , across half the country , i 've only been back to visit my family and friends twice during that time . 
  now , i 've been described as a loner by teachers , but over the years , i did find some friends , people i could hang around with during school and sometimes after . 
  i am fucking terrible at making friends , i just do n't get it all . 
  i can talk to people , zero problem , but somehow i still miss stuff . 
  mostly those friends i made were quite coincidental , like my tennis partner or the people i was seated next to . 
  i really do n't like things like discos , because i 'd rather talk to people - also i suppose i 'm someone who does n't ` let loose ' easily . 
  so now i 'm at university , knowing literally no one . 
  and like two weeks in everyone has their own clique already , and i 'm like what the fuck ? 
  why was n't i invited ? 
  i really felt lonely during that time , but hey , i still had my old friends ( instantaneous communication ftw ) , and i nthe it does n't matter if the people you game with are next to you or 200km away . 
  still , i thought that having friends here would be rad . 
  i then came to an easy conclusion : ** do stuff you like , and friends will come knocking at the door !, 
  ** if attending social gatherings makes you feel uneasy , do n't . 
  go do something fun instead !, 
  pick up a sport or something , or find a fun guild , join a club , start a club ... 
  ** tl ; dr : a life spent doing stuff you do n't love is the worst . 
  thanks for the post . 
  what happened to the other two out of five people ? 
  did they voluntarily stay in the ~ ~ us ~ ~ uk ? 
  what scene ? 
  i read a book by andreas eschbach , ` the last of his kind ' , about a supersoldier who was augmented etc. 
  but the most awesome piece of technology he had ( i thought ) was such a keyboard . 
  no more fiddling around with smartphone keyboards ... 
  also those banners . 
  looking pretty popelike to me, 
  amazing . 
  do you have proof for this ? 
  nevermind , found it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17e1ap/result_of_my_previous_ea_ahq_ban_post/ ), 
  have you ever heard of [ shores of hazeron ] ( http://www.hazeron.com/ ) ? 
  concise . 
  that 's how often feel , too, 
  so this is the first ama i 've actually stayed up for , it 's 4 am over here . 
  what i want to ask after i discovered the show and watched in all in two weeks :, 
  * what were your main influences both for the show and for you as writers personally ? 
  and, 
  * what is your opinion of the timeshifted viewing that made staying on air so hard for community ? 
  what do you think could be done differently in that regard ? 
  as someone who really has no chance of seeing the show ( or most shows , really ) on american television , i 'm really , really interested in that . 
  and infinite thanks for my favourite comedy show , ever . 
  i want this question answered so hard . 
  you messed up your link . 
  he 's only missing in two episodes . 
  and he is in the finale, 
  yup . 
  also , is square dance basically simon says but complicated ? 
  oh god imagine if they would just answer with an * `` you 'll find out  '' *, 
  personally , i 'd go for peter petrelli-style, 
  there are actually only 13 episodes , are n't there ? 
  i 've only seen seasons 1 and 2 , but what i got was that at the beginning he simply was very bad at controlling his powers . 
  in season 2 you can see a battle-hardened peter who takes on sylar , which is awesome . 
  but yeah , the only thing you need for this power to be useful is for other people to have powers !, 
  they do that ? 
  rerun a show during a new season ? 
  american tv is strange .
