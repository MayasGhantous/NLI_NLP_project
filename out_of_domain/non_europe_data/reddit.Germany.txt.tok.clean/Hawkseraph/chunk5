  thanks , he is a big fan of films , so i just got that for him .

  keep going and dftba, 
  the `` beware of the cults '' card has a typo - it says federarion instead of federation , 
  i always love those worlds where it is magic vs industry or science or w/e . 
  a question : why did the proto-federatio nstates ban magic ? 
  why did n't they coexist with the secular scholars ? 
  could give us a few more details ?

  what in armoks name ? 
   the other person fails to realize that my reaction is also not serious , so they feel the need to tell me they were only joking . 
  my first impulse is to find this condescending , but i 've learned to accept that it 's the nature of the game , and i try to tone it down for people who do n't get what i 'm playing at . 
  haha , exactly !, 
  yeah , the naval combat was n't that great , really .
