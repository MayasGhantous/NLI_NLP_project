  and it looks great for co-op , finally another game to get the friends together again and out of lol !, 
  yes , the developer just said on the q&a that it was an `` online open-world game '' . 
  sounds very interesting but not much information , 
  those were the actual players not npcs :d, 
  yeah , i was actually being really excited about the npc 's dialogue too until i realized those wer esupposed to be players !, 
  it just sounded so natural, 
  where ? 
  oh please be true, 
  finally , a space elevator !, 
  everyone ... we have found cohen the barbarian !, 
  yay !, 
  ^ run, 
  i did n't know you could go up there !, 
  that is so cool . 
  hey , i am happy to say that you are mistaken . 
  most games use steam as drm , yes , but many indies or other developers do n't , and their games can be played without steam running !, 
  you just have to find the executable in the folder it was installed in !, 
   sadly this is a very obscure feature . 
  you also have to log in to gamersgate to buy the game , come on . 
  hey op where are all the other players ' ships in your screenshot ? 
  but yeah , amarr is definitely my favourite market hub . 
  it recently got its own server node too !, 
  i mean no dont go there amarr is shit and a trap, 
  man it just goes on and on and on, 
  american maybe , but we europeans usually do n't have those weird water tanks on top of buildings, 
  you could try [ evolve ] ( https://www.evolvehq.com/ ) , it has pretty good recording features . 
  my name is methos, 
  the ultiamte cheat code in empire earth : insane amount of resources and all units were built immediately . 
  it * also * completely removed the fog of war . 
  what more can you ask ? 
  your link is broken , 
  you can edit your post and fix it !, 
  you still missed the ` e ' at the end of jpg but the link works !, 
  exactly . 
  what are you spending your time of the day with ? 
  surely reading up on quantum physics is n't * all you do * . 
  [ fixed link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_dreadnought_%281875%29 ), 
  my wikilink uses a different ` encoding ' for the article , so no ' ) ' at the end, 
  no , in eve it 's * not * like that . 
  three smaller ships can easily take down a way bigger ship if they catch it alone because the bigger ship 's guns just wont hit them . 
  he checks out ( well , he has ea flair in r/battlefield _ 4 ) . 
  listeeeen to him, 
  [ meanwhile in r/de ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1hd421/w%c3%a4hrend_sich_politiker_und_reddit_%c3%bcber_prism/ ), 
  aaaand at the exact time we enact our * own * spying laws . 
  good smoke-and-mirror operation there !, 
  no , embassies are * not * territory of another state !, 
  it is merely * recognized * by the hosting country as a special zone , but if they wanted to , they could force them to leave . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.aleksandreia.com/2012/10/29/why-american-embassies-are-foreign-territory/ ) , for example . 
  it 's a very common misconception , though . 
  but of course forcing the us embassy to leave would be hugely unreasonable for something like this ( just not worth it ! ) . 
  after all you want to keep talking to the other guys . 
  that is ... an incredibly ignorant viewpoint . 
  what do you mean with `` our tutelage '' ? 
  the cold war in which the us used proxies to fight its war against communism ? 
  the modern era in which the us invades middle eastern countries under false pretense ? 
  what about the war in kongo which has cost millions of lives ? 
  where was the us ? 
  just because the us invades a foreign country every few years does n't mean you are the world 's peacekeeper . 
  that role falls to nuclear weapons and international organizations . 
  please , when saying something like this give a source :d ( i searched but could n't find anything ), 
  this wo n't work as they would be legally forced to extradite him . 
  why do people even bring up military power in something like this ? 
  could n't find a source , please provide one . 
  or did you mean [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil-for-food_programme ) semi-humanitarian effort by the un ? 
  also that is a cheap argument - just because one country sometime did something bad that does n't mean it can never do something right again . 
  do n't feed the troll, 
  i 'm still amazed that people bring up the military in this , lol . 
  guys , the us and uk are closing their bases in germany because they want to save money and you still talk about missile silos ? 
  wake up from the cold war dreams - economic power is what makes the world turn these days, 
  you do realize the bverfg is just for constitutional rulings and overwatching the legislative and executive , not criminal charges , right ? 
  the incompetence par tmight actually be true . 
  there a huge scandal not so long ago where the german inner security agency basically fucked up a lot of times in a lot of ways and allowed a band of racist murderers to roam around the country even though they had lots of hints to their locations . 
  so yeah , i would not rule out incompetence, 
  do n't forget : we ca n't delete data because that additional button would have cost us 50.000 $ !, 
  cool , thanks - i found that article in another context a few comments further down but did n't think of connecting it to that . 
  however , i think those cases are different from what we are facing today , which is the untargeted wiretapping of simply * everything * they can get their hands on . 
  an example : how high is the probability that an average uk citizen has his or her data spied on the germany ? 
  slim to none ( due to incompetence or whatever , i do n't know ) . 
  how high is the probability that an average citizen of germany has been spied on by the us/uk/5 eyes ? 
  well , the numbers are pretty big . 
  scarily big . 
  they actually do n't , germany does not have the capacity to siphon off telecommuncations data on a scale like this in their own country , let alone others . 
  i would love it if something of consequence happened after all these leaks , and i do think there will : people are getting educated , they are understanding more about how the governments and spy agencies etc. 
  are trying to control data . 
  but i do n't have any hope at all for diplomacy to have any effect . 
  to be honest , i 'm pretty surprised by this announcement , but i 'm sure the attorneys will just declare it as not their problem and move on . 
  that might be true , but in this case it 's the scale . 
  germany does n't have the ability ( nor , i would say , the need to - but i would have thought that of the uk and us as well ) to listen to a whole country 's data and save it . 
  that 's just wanton disregard for any personal rights , of anyone . 
  haha , i do too !, 
  i actually learned about that on reddit too . 
  why * should n't * a president be overthrown if the public does n't agree with him ? 
  if the disagreement is strong enough , down with him . 
  a system like this has helped turkey stay democratic in the face of islamism : [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_turkey#military_factor ), 
  they are the two races i play as . 
  seriously , what is up with all those knives ? 
  hm , i can honestly say no to that , but i usually do n't work outside ( except in the garden , but i have tools there , of course ) . 
  i do have a flashlight on my keychain and in my phone though . 
  very useful , i agree . 
  most of these peoples ' edc seems like more stuff than i could tolerate to carry around with me , but de gestibus non disputandis , eh ?
