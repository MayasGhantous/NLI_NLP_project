  of course those guys are the problem . 
  they * work for the organization which does all these things * !, 
  if everyone at the nsa refused to do immoral things , there would be no problem . 
  `` i 'm just following my orders '' can not be an excuse, 
  all hail u/jhiojhiop , the great internetdetektiv !, 
  starbound seems to be a very good fit . 
  it 's very different fro mterraria though , do n't let that fool you . 
  development on 0x10 ^ c was stopped . 
  do we really need more people who like the first part of a series more than the sequels ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ jesus ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ small, 
  the overlay ? 
  the only thing the overlay is good for is chatting with friends, 
  well , perosnally i use [ evolve 's ] ( https://www.evolvehq.com/welcome ) overlay , which has all that steam offers and then some ( their browser is better , too ), 
  star wars ? 
  looks a lot more homeworld-inspired to me, 
  that dude looks really out of place, 
   karate chops, 
  but did the rpg elements in me1 really help the game ? 
  carrying around useless weapons and armor did n't really improve my immersion nor my enjoyment of the game . 
  they did keep skill points etc. 
  i second that . 
  i do n't even know how someone would get the idea . 
  edit : but after reading the link / u/solapada provided , it does seem clearer . 
  ij 's ending appears to have been the inspiration for the book hazel obesses about . 
  so a link is there . 
  did you have lucky nations enabled ? 
  if yes , that would explain those rulers . 
  also confirmation bias, 
  you can force a country you defeated to give back cores to your vassals already . 
  they made more customers by being on steam , and the money they save on specialized tech support more than makes up for the steam haters . 
  well , that 's easy enough , usually , 
  in conditions as these , there is one best way to drive . 
  the programmers can do research , test and so on to determine this for those conditions , and then program the computer accordingly . 
  when the car then encounters these conditions , it will act in that way , every time , without fail . 
  that 's not something you can say about humans . 
  okay , but if a human can detect and/or adapt to those conditions , a computer should be able to do so either . 
  and a human would have to solve for a new driving style too , so we can borrow the algorithm !, 
  we 've gone full circle . 
  hello !, 
  * shivers *, 
  battlestar galactica, 
  i have the same issue , anbd also use res with firefox & w8 . 
  i just turned off the subreddit style . 
  wow , the original link does n't even work any more , you crazy people . 
  it 's the perfect fusion . 
  sjw can into space ( just like all the other garbage ) !, 
  well said !, 
  oh god the burning hate i have for these useless popups . 
  why paradox whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, 
  i guess we know which gender serendipitybot is , now . 
  was n't the blog op linked just someone who reblogged it ? 
  good to hear you 've gotten better !, 
  we germans can be peculiar sometimes , but if you 're insecure do n't hesitate to ask ... 
  better to ask an awkward question than feel awkward all the time , is n't it ? 
  i do n't know , how good is your german ? 
  what about co-workers ? 
  we are relevant !, 
  i envy you - good work !, 
  the dalek being activated by rose 's touch , however , must be the biggest handwave ever . 
  * time traveler dna ? 
  * really ? 
  could we not just have had the dalek convince her to set it free ? 
  but as per the rest , i agree - great episode !, 
  * twitch *, 
  that 's not how biology works . 
  radiation is , depending on the wavelenght , just energy . 
  that energy does stuff to your cells , maybe mutates a few basepairs , but there 's no `` directed '' change , ie there 's no way to tell what kind of radiation you were subject to . 
  also you would think the timelords had radiation shields !, 
  although on the other hand they usually do n't carry non-immune passengers . 
  so that 'd like be like shielding yourself from rain , i guess . 
  have you tried dipping them into honey ? 
  banana chips + honey = tasteeee explosioooon, 
  yeah , that does look kinda random . 
  this really read like a historical text , well done !, 
  but man , that capitalization ... 
  that ... that 's not what incentives are about . 
  incentives are motivations for someone to work harder , because , as the theory goes , people wo n't work * harder * if that wo n't give them benefits . 
  incentives do n't differ between rich and poor , because incentives are supposed to work on people who have * the same amount of stuff * . 
  we want to be taken seriously , guys . 
  what this comic describes is just how the powerful abuse the system , not what incentives are ... 
  i was mainly following the theme set by the other flags i 'd seen [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rruzp#125 ), 
  and wow mine was already added to it < 3, 
  pos bashing , more like :p, 
  this is weird, 
  that 's more annoying than funny though , lol, 
  oh , i thought it awarded all of the rewards , too : /, 
  no , dinosaurbrutus is right , actually . 
  sure , your translation is okay too , but his translation captures the intention behind the words better . 
  the way yours is worded you could interpret it as `` work makes you cost nothing '' . 
  which is definitely not what was intended . 
  i read consider phlebas first , too , and i think it is great as a starting point because for most of the book , you do n't really get told much by the protagonist , who is an enemy of theirs . 
  through his view of the culture , you learn so much about them that 's not actually obvious and goes pretty deep . 
  and of course having the ` good guys ' be the enemy of the protagonist is pretty refreshing from a literary standpoint . 
  the pictured war is also pretty important for the culture itself ( all other books are set long after it , and the impact of that war is noticeable in every one of them . 
  something else i really liked about the book is how you could unlock more and more of its nuances after reading subsequent books . 
  so in conclusion i 'd say yeah , it 's the best book for starting if you are in it for reading them all . 
  if you just want a quick ` peek ' , go for player of games like / u/l0rdenglish suggested, 
  oh , that 's interesting !, 
  i never really thought * much * about why the culture has never sublimed as we do n't really know too much about that , but maybe it is just because they are so different ? 
  we only have the gzilt example , and that was race where the leaders made the decisions ( something the culture does n't have ) and they did n't have ais to speak of .
