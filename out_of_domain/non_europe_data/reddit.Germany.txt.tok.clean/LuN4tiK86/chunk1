  sorry for being offtopic, 
  oh wow , i was serious . 
  have n't seen any screencaps from ios7 and do n't really follow apple products . 
  a young woman gets on the bus with her baby . 
  as she pays the bus driver , he says : `` that 's the ugliest baby that i 've ever seen in my whole life . 
  the shoked woman goes to the rear of the bus and sits down , fuming . 
  she says to an old lady next to her : `` the driver just insulted me ! '', 
  the lady says : `` oh my dear , you go right up there and tell him off -- go ahead , i 'll hold your monkey for you . '', 
  edit : sorry if i offended anybody , this seems to get a lot of downvotes , not really sure why :( . 
  if you think i 'm wrong , just make this test by yourself and let 's discuss the results  . 
  btw i 'm not a native speaker , so please excuse any mistakes . 
  i was really curious if i 'm just not consciously seeing it , because so far almost everybody in this thread agrees that there are `` just pictures of attractive women '' on reddit . 
  so i went to [ / r/pics ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/ ) and counted the pictures of ( somewhat sexualized ) women of the first 500 submissions at the moment . 
  i found 2 pictures , at position 138 and 212 . 
  the amount of `` normal '' pictures of women seems to be the same as the mens , i think even more pictures of men , holding something or standing in front of something etc. , so i see nothing strange here . 
  then i went to the top posts of all time in the [ / r/pics ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/ ) - subreddit . 
  so far i found [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1l77w8/she_only_loves_you_when_shes_drunk_a_watercolor_i/ ) at position 155 , a painting of a naked woman . 
  then [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/19kmia/meanwhile_in_russia_doesnt_even_begin_to_describe/ ) at 299 , woman in a bikini at the edge of the picture . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1002zt/alrighty_then/ ) at 480 , jim carrey with a girl in a bikini . 
  and the same situation here , the amount of pictures of men seems more . 
  i know this is not overly scientific or anything , but sorry i have to disagree with that statement of op , that `` much of reddit 's content is just pictures of attractive women . '', 
  out of 500 submissions 2 or 3 somewhat sexualized ( woman in bikini etc. ), 
  is not a lot . 
  i do agree though with a lot of comments in this thread that there are a lot of people who post somewhat immature/degrading comments about women . 
  you can see some in the three top-posts i linked , but that does n't surprise me , the majority of reddit 's userbase is male ( at least that 's what i think ) and there always will be people ( probably a lot of teenagers ) who like that kind of stuff ( f.e. 
  comments like : `` that ass !, 
  '' , `` fap , fap , fap '' , `` look at the buns on that . '' ) . 
  so i do n't really know where this statement is coming from . 
  can you point me in the right direction where i went wrong or something ? 
  i 'm really curious ... 
   you did n't count sexualized pictures of men and other subs like / r/funny [ 1 ] , / r/aww [ 2 ] , and other image-based ones . 
  i agree that there are way more pictures of sexualized women , than men ( if any at all ) . 
  but my point is , as op and other people in this thread are saying is that the majority of reddits content is just women is not true . 
  but i did the same thing in / r/funny and / r/aww and counted the posts where the content is a picture of a woman in somewhat sexualized way . 
  / r/funny probably has the most so far , with about 4-5 posts every 100 . 
  that is still `` only '' 5 % . 
  in / r/aww are none in the top 500 at the moment , as far as i can tell . 
  in the top 500 is the only one that could be `` sexualized '' is [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1mzydb/holding_a_baby_goat_at_the_fair_yesterday/ ) . 
  then again way more `` normal '' pictures of men than women . 
   but women 's are upvoted for no reason and the comments section are ridded with ` nice tits ' and that sorta bullshit . 
  i totally agree that the comments sections are worse in terms of disrespect against women/typical teenager humor . 
  but my point is , saying that there are so many of those posts that it 's unbearable , seems a little over the top to me . 
  but that is the vibe that i am getting . 
  i can totally understand that you do n't like these posts , but unsubscribing from a subreddit just because there are ( so far / r/funny is highest with 5 % , but let 's be generous ) say 10 % of posts that are annoying , seems strange to me , as long as you enjoy most of the rest of it ( but in reality it 's probably less than 20 % of content that is particularly enjoyable , rest is just meh ) . 
  so as long as you stay away from subreddits that are especially about women in any sexualized form ( / r/gonewild etc. ), 
  and why would you go there in the first place if you do n't enjoy the content that is advertised in this subreddit . 
  so , i 'm sorry but i still do n't really understand how ( sexualized ) women make up a large part of reddits content , as op claims and a lot of people here seem to agree on . 
  i totally agree with you , a woman posts a picture of herself and you know before going into the comments section that there will be comments like you mentioned , not all of them will be disrespectful , but some for sure . 
  i can totally understand that it is annoying to you . 
  and is it surprising that the post with cleavage gets more upvotes ? 
  i think in comparison , if you go to a subreddit where there a lot of women , do n't really know which one , but let 's say / r/aww for example . 
  i post a picture of a beautiful man ( whatever you prefer , fashion model/celebrity lookalike ) cuddling with a cute cat/dog , i am pretty sure that would get more upvotes than just the cute cat/dog or a normallooking guy cuddling with the cute cat/dog . 
  i just got the impression from a lot of comments that those posts are `` everywhere '' on reddit and that you have to unsubscribe from / r/pics because it has so much of it . 
  that 's why i wanted to know for sure and counted the obvious ones . 
  because there are a lot of posts with a picture of a woman that are not disrespectful , f.e. 
  a picture of a woman with a celebrity will get way less of those comments than a picture with a woman where you can see some cleavage . 
  so i did n't count every picture with a woman in it . 
  i certainly think that most of you are not annoyed by a `` normal '' looking woman . 
  so back to the statement of op , that a lot of people seem to agree on :, 
   it does n't seem to matter clothed , unclothed , celebrities , or just normal everyday women seem to make up a large part of reddits content . 
  i was wondering if , as women , this annoys you . 
  sorry but i still have to say that that is not true . 
  there are n't as many posts with women sexualized or not , than a lot of people seem to suggest in this thread . 
  but i totally agree with you about the big issue of sexualization ( is this a word ? 
  i 'm not a native speaker ) of `` normal '' pictures of woman . 
  i can understand if it is a picture in gonewild , and somebody comments about a bodypart he likes or whatever . 
  but i agree that reddit should be a little more mature in `` normal '' subreddits in this regard . 
  i only counted the sexualized ones because those are obviously annoying to most women . 
  i did n't count the `` normal '' ones because i would think those are not annoying to women , they count as `` normal '' or enjoyable content ( disregarding the comments section ) . 
  so if look at the posts in a subreddit f.e. 
  / r/pics , it 's only a small fraction that is annoying . 
  not like a lot of people are suggesting that it seems to be everywhere and you have to unsubscribe from all the standard subreddits . 
  the sexist comments are another issue and i totally agree with what a lot of people have posted about that . 
  you ca n't post a normal picture as a women without some asshole giving some sexist comments and then a lot more of them are going to upvote it . 
  but even then , those comments are not the majority . 
  [ university of toronto league association ] ( https://www.facebook.com/uoftla ), 
  is there a source of some sort ? 
  first time i heard about that ... 
  as unpopular as it might be , but i have to somewhat agree , the last innovative game they made ( completely on their own ) , was half-life 2 . 
  since then they all have been based on some mod ( or prototype ) made by the community . 
  but they are really good at improving the mod-concept and make a full game out of it .
