  europe lost the world war ? 
  ok , for a moment i thought you were serious with your comments . 
  seems like they do a lot of things wrong in europe , what else ? 
  can you tell me more about the usa-vs-europe-war ? 
  i agree with you , but that was a rhetorical question . 
  saying `` europe lost the world war '' is a punch in the face to all the allied nations in europe , they also `` won '' the war . 
  it was allies vs axis , sure the us contributed a lot but saying usa won the world war against europe is wrong on so many levels . 
  it seems that some people think that europe is a country ... 
  your source also says that it 's in fact not horace greasley in that picture . 
  so the soldier in the picture is not british , he is a soviet soldier . 
  thank you , i wish more people would provide a link of the place in google maps , always like to see where the picture was taken . 
  + giving credit to the author . 
  wit 's end , spirit visage , sunfire cape , sorc boots and guardian angel, 
  i noticed the same thing a while ago . 
  thought it was a problem with my phone in particular , also galaxy s3 ( i9300 ) . 
  personally i like proxmate , it unblocks more than just youtube . 
  you can use hulu , grooveshark/pandora and a lot of other sites with it . 
  [ link ] ( http://proxmate.dave.cx/ ), 
  there was a hilarious version of that interview on youtube with all the outtakes where the interviewer and zac are cracking up . 
  i think it was about 10 minutes long , wish i could find it . 
  somebody else has a source of the full version ? 
  thank you !, 
  that 's the video i was looking for , 
  [ link to the location in google maps .

  it still looks very stretched somehow , i think [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/halrrdf.jpg ) is what i should look like ( tried to make it look more realistic ) . 
  very nice picture nonetheless . 
  is there a source for the gif somewhere ? 
  i 'd love to hear the reactions ... 
  looks terrifying . 
  any source available ? 
  or context where this happened etc. 
  same thing happens to me with teamspeak . 
  the volume of teamspeak gets reduced to 10 % every time i join a game . 
  have to alt-tab and fix the settings in windows every time . 
  click on the soundicon in the taskbar and then on ` mixer ' . 
  there should be a separate slider for each running program , there you can adjust the volume of skype , etc. 
  thank you !, 
  strange that it only happens with 7dtd , never noticed a difference with other games ... 
  thank you for doing this !, 
  and a 10/0/5 febiven against skt, 
  instead of credit cards it is very common to use debit cards ( ec-karte ) . 
  basically the same thing as a credit card but there are no fees and it is safer ( usually you have to use your pin , sometimes your signature ) . 
  and you still did n't bother to link it correctly ? 
  [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nail_clubbing] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nail_clubbing ), 
  i use [ missed message flasher ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomatox.missedmessageflasher&amp;hl=en ) , because i often missed messages etc. 
  you can configure it to vibrate every minute for example till you read the message . 
  for the sound problem , you could try [ silent time ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quitehypnotic.silenttime&amp;hl=en ) , i use it to make sure my phone is in silent mode while i work . 
  you could set it so it is in silent mode the whole day . 
  there are probably better apps/solutions out there but that 's what i use , hope it helps . 
  with the current state of the support situation with steam , i do n't see the respect for customers . 
  i am willing to say that ea with origin has `` more respect for customers '' in that regards . 
  nice work , do you have a source ? 
  that video looks badass . 
  sadly i have no idea how to help you with that resource ( not a modder/programmer ) , but the least i can do is thank you for your hard work . 
  i really like the configuration tool !, 
  can somebody eli5 how to find out what these commands do ? 
  got my fallout 4 key from gmg a few days before the release . 
  never had an issue so far . 
  `` die usa '' translates to `` the usa '', 
  `` die usa '' translates to `` the usa '', 
  pretty much a recipe for the frontpage of futurology : ` clickbait title ' mix in some ` tesla/spacex ' and ` elon musk ' to taste, 
  i really do n't understand the sentiment that everybody with a different opinion is automatically a shill/apologist . 
  just my opinion on why you are being downvoted . 
  do you have a video of it ? 
  big malz fan , would love to see it . 
  oh right , i feel dumb now , cheers, 
  at first glance i thought it read star wars , they messed up the o a bit . 
  either way great message . 
  mental illness, 
  same here , but after temporarely disabling adblock it worked for me . 
  it is tradition to shake hands at this point in the for the press . 
  merkel even asked him if he wants to shake hands , so there is really no excuse , he ignored her deliberately . 
  [ just watch this .

  how is that fake news ? 
  you can clearly see in the video that they do n't shake hands . 
  although it is tradition to shake hands at this point for the press ( he did f.e. 
  shake hands with japans pm ) , merkel even asks him if he wants to shake hands .

  [ to me it looks like he deliberately ignored her .
