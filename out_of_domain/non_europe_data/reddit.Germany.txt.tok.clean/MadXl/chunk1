yes , haven seen a post of it yet with pictures . 
  yeah you are right that thingy is in the 3rd trailer but i just could see one of them in the normal gameplay so i wondered if maybe somebody wants to check that monster out while it cant deal damage . 
  that is so awesome and i guess everyone wants to buy and play it so pleaso go to [ here ] ( http://www.makeplayingcards.com/custom-board-games.aspx ) or something like that and finish it ** please **, 
  nice, 
  then not ;(, 
  i think the reason for getting all people more aggressive then in an other game like halo or cod is that in those games you play with randoms and most of the time you dont care what excactly they do . 
  if they die or not who cares most of the time . 
  all you care about is your own kdr ( kill/death ratio ) or to get a killstreak . 
  in lol you dont care about killstreaks mainly or about your death in particular . 
  you care about how your team is doing compared to the other one . 
  if your team dies more then them and it is not your fault ( directly ) you feel like they stop you . 
  maybe you do fine until the 6/0/2 jungler comes on your lane and kills you . 
  you ask yourself is this my fault ? 
  yeah . 
  maybe . 
  but most of the time the first thing you think about is he could kill you that easy cause he has 6 kills !, 
  if your lanes stealing your camps you get aggressive cause you instinctiv think its only yours !, 
  it is like i would steal your money . 
  you get angry . 
  then you write it to them . 
  maybe they have a difficult lane and need the gold so they dont see the reason why you hate them now . 
  they hate you back . 
  then the enemy writes `` outplayed '' even so it might not have happend . 
  your aggression goes to him and gets bigger until you hate everyone !, 
  then next game you are still mad and the first small fault brings you back to hulk-status !, 
  i think one the biggest mistakes with the comunity is that you get flamed for playing bad . 
  yeah sure it can be that you are eating or drunk and play bad . 
  ** but ** sometimes the enemy is just better in his role on your lane so you loose . 
  it happens and you cant change it . 
  still you get flamed and so you get sad or mad . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** you cant compare cod or halo with lol . 
  there are different foci gameplay wise . 
  in those games you care about yourself and if get to mad cause of a noob-tuber you quit . 
  in lol you cant . 
  so you need to get your aggressions out -  ( all ) chat !, 
  pls dont get mad at me for spelling , 
  so you mean something like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2q17jw/minion_war_red_side_minions_vs_blue_side_minions/ ) ? 
  well thanks a lot , as mentioned above it is already my build but then i am going to change the gpu and psu . 
  so after reading most of the comments i can tell that there is a bigger awerness of getting one champ more often then others ... 
  let me tell you how '' ** random ** '' works : every champ has a chance to get picked !, 
  so every champ can get picked but must not . 
  it has just a chance !, 
  there is no list with what you havent played yet where a champ get picked from or anything like that ( i guess ) . 
  so its just `` luck '' based how often u get the same champ like rolling 5 times a 6 on a dice !, 
  please keep this in mind that random is something speciall even if it is never true randomness ... 
   randomness suggests a non-order or non-coherence in a sequence of symbols or steps , such that there is no intelligible pattern or combination . 
  instruction unclear : lost because only items in inventory are wards ... 
  so apperently not everone on reddit is challenger ... 
  he should have smited him for drivebykill, 
  i like that idea . 
  it brings the whole step by step system further . 
  until now i just told them that is not possible how about opening the door first . 
  thanks a lot i think this is something i havent even thought of . 
  stop crying . 
  play janna . 
  win games cause no creep block . 
  very nice plays and editing but for me its like you you always stop the clip directly after the kill . 
  i dont know why but for me a play gets much better when i can see how you survived in the end . 
  but apart from that like / u/shakuswag said nice flash + ult + q plays , 
  i hate these people like yasou who take the gold for pink even tho you cleared 4/5th of it ... makes me so sad as a supp . 
  oh and btw that nida was quiet good but yeah that yasou keeps me awake at night ... 
  then happy cakeday and much of that, 
   crap, 
    we buy everyday . 
  i saw it in the server log somewhere if i recall correctly . 
  so its a server issue and nothing ftbserver has to do with directly if i understand that right . 
  i just thought it might help fix something if that might be a re occuring problem but i guess it is fixed now somehow . 
  the server at least hasnt told me that again . 
  thanks for your help . 
  the fact that they cant change email binded to his account without him accepting the change in his email-account gives him the option to just reset the password and get his account back . 
  i cant see how that would not work . 
  if he let them change the email allready i guess there is no way for riot to determin if you have just gave that account to someone else or really got hacked ... 
  [ this is crazy !, 
  you sir made my day :d congrats xd, 
  well if you look closely you can see they cant even keep up with pulling the line and then i dont think it is possible to pull a normal average human up at that speed . 
  depends on what modpack you choose and what specs the server has . 
  in addition to that i would recommend fastcraft . 
  helped my server a lot but i cant say more cause you havent specified anything . 
  do you want plotworlds , free building , regulation on chunkloaders , magic / technic and so on . 
  it remembered me of [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/h1rzt ), 
  i would guess if it still loads in the logs it just hasnt finished yet . 
  maybe try again , wait 20 min and dont click it !, 
  may you give some more information about your system like ram , cpu and so on ? 
  i can use up to 20 and i would say that is more than enough but it still works . 
  but i place them looking in opposite directions everytime so the 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 and so on northe and the others south maybe that is helping . 
  i guess a blood magic level 6 altar is late game and botania full mana pools / tablet / automation as well as thaumcraft all researches ^ ^, 
  hahahahha was thinking the same as i first have seen the modpack announcement, 
  likes ? 
  to write ? 
  like this ? 
  well i dont have a solution yet but i have the same problem . 
  if i find what is causing it i will tell you . 
  i got it to work now but i am not sure if that would help you ... 
  i have run both batch files on my own pc to get the missing libraries that the server is asking for and uploaded them on the server afterwards . 
  now my server is running again after 4 hours searching and trying . 
  i hope this fixes your problem . 
  but isnt that some kind of soft ocd ( gamebased maybe ) , i mean in minecraft i would tell myself ocd-building too because i cant even leave my caves un-cleaned behind me and i have to allign everything ... 
  maybe you are right and it should be called otherwise . 
  anyway happy cakeday !, 
  nevermind i just wanted to be special ... then i go back in my cave with my stone tools and live like a hobo without an excuse ...
