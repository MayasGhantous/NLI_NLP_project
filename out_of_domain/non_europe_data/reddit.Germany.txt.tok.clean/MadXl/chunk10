  [ something like this if you can afford it ] ( http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20550y1 ) . 
  it has full modular cables = better airflow in the case and better looking . 
  enough power for overclocking and a stronger gpu for the future . 
  80 + gold to be on the safe side . 
  if anything goes wrong with the psu because you bought a cheap one , every other part might get to much power and die too . 
  * i havent checked everything thrue with this build yet , please check compability on your own to be on the safe side *, 
  i hope i could help . 
  if the beeps are the same with ram in and without it then the pc doesnt recognize the ram . 
  if you are not using a antistatic band you might have fright you ram or the pins from the mobo are broken wich might be more likely in regards that you have 2 different ram sticks . 
  if you can , borough some ram from a friend and test again . 
  or if you can get a replacement for the mobo if you still can send it back . 
  psu shouldnt be a problem . 
  the next bad thing could be the cpu if that has broken pins but then the beep wouldnt state a ram problem . 
  i would try to get a replacement mobo additionally thinking in regards to the '' * maybe * broken '' sys_2 fan-pins . 
  i hope your problem gets solved soon . 
  i myself know how bad one could feel in this situations . 
  good luck, 
  i would consider to upgrade the drivers . 
  for one they are not only graphic related ( they are drivers for a part of your cpu ) and then on the other hand , if your gpu would ever go down you could at least trouble shoot with your build in graphics . 
  how ? 
  a normal pcie card uses the backpanel . 
  how do you want to insert 2 of them behind each other ? 
  you might be able to put a x4 in a x8 or x16 slot but not 2 as far as i know . 
  i dont even understand how you want to make that possible because every pcie card has a distinct devider ( in the front/middle/end whatever ) that you can not put it in the wrong way around . 
  but every slot only has one of these so the 2nd card has none and wont fit . 
  i would get a i5 if money isnt a problem at the moment . 
  i5-4690k for overclocking , 4460 if i remember correctly for non overclocking . 
  but its cute that s/he tries to :p, 
  no problem at all . 
  i am happy that i could help . 
  in the end it is your build and you know best what you may want to do in the future . 
  taking a i3 in this consideration is no problem at all if you know you might be able to upgrade it in the future . 
  my build is just for the moment . 
  i wish you good luck building and long time parts ,

  ** remember !!!, 
  if you are using a win 7 or 8 ( .1 ) key to upgrade your windows on 10 you need to upgrade it first and then you can do a fresh install . 
  on the first upgrade windows 10 generates a hardware dependant code that they safe to their database . 
  ** a normal win 7 or 8 key for a fresh install of windows 10 without the update first wont work ** . 
  it needs this hardware code to activate itself . 
  for further information ask the web or me again . 
  good luck, 
   keeping the budget at $ 800, 
  there is space for a [ 250 gb ssd ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-internal-hard-drive-ct250mx200ssd1 ) or not ? 
  on the other hand if you dont buy windows 10 but 8 or even 7 and do the upgrade you get away with the same but most likely for less . 
  personally i dont have a problem with that but it depends on what the person has done with it . 
  the easiest way would be to ask if s/he is a hard core gamer , bitcoin miner or just casual user that wants a hardware swap and sells his/her old . 
  as long as the cable is 5e or higher and has some kind of protection you can lay cables up to 55m without a problem at your end . 
  i dont know how long that is going to be at your end but it might be much cheaper than the powerline adapter wich can be troublesome or not work in every house . 
  i found someone say, 
   cat 5 is 285 feet . 
  cat 6 will go to around 700 feet or something of that length . 
  the longest i 've run of cat 6 is 630 feet . 
  [ here is a cable ] ( http://www.amazon.com/cable-matters%c2%ae-snagless-ethernet-patch/dp/b00b3utrwi/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1441726107&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cat6+150+ft ), 
  you might even think about using the 60 cm , 30 led variation if that fits . 
  it is cheaper than buying 2 but the edges might be a problem . 
  my problem was that the build itself ( even if it hasnt a ssd ) is quite nice and good . 
  i havent found any point where to cut the budget than the ones mentioned above . 
  yes sure you can buy a ssd later but reinstalling the os or pushing it over isnt always as easy as simply having a ssd from the beginning . 
   50cm high and long, 
  the window is around 30 * 45 . 
  ( 30 +30 +45 +45 = 150cm ) if you want to line the led around the window to get an equal glow on all components you need 4 times the small one or 2 times the big one . 
  thats why i said it . 
  but it depends on how you want it to glow . 
  thats right . 
  i just said if do a fresh install directly without the upgrade first you can not activate windows 10 with a 7 or 8 key . 
  and yes keep nothing is quite the same as fresh install but some people still want a really fresh clean install for some reason . 
  anyway . 
  my only concern in regards to windows 10 is [ donotspy10 ] ( http://pxc-coding.com/de/portfolio/donotspy10/ ), 
  stops all the information saving from microsoft . 
  well you could always use [ this ] ( http://youtubetime.com/ ) hahhha, 
  and i dont even have the case \u25f4 _ \u25f6, 
   [ evga 500w review ] ( http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=ndreviews&amp;op=story6&amp;reid=384 ), 
   folks , that is about the lowest you should even consider paying for a power supply this size , so evga is doing pretty well here . 
  so ... yeah . 
  but it still scored quite good and for its price its one of the best . 
  still you are right and in the end its your money . 
  you may buy a better psu to be * more * safe or safe a litle while , buy a ssd and move everything over from your hdd ( os and programms ) . 
  finally i found a reference on reddit that i understood . 
  * happy day *, 
  i dont know about the part with the t but i would only recommend i5 as far as you arent rendering anything or need the additional power . 
  for what i know the 2 best options at the moment for cpus are the 4460 for normal usage and the 4690k for overclocking . 
  edit : just searched it and it seems like the t variations arent that good . 
  if want a small power usage you might take a s version but i still dont know how they work and so on . 
  just what www.cpubenchmark.net told me, 
  as far as i know the ram would just downclock to the max speed the cpu ( or memory controller i dont know excatly ) can handle . 
  if the price difference isnt that big it is no problem . 
  but have in mind that the latency is a big enough factor as the speed . 
  both determine how fast the ram will work . 
  the bonus point of to fast ram is that you might be able to turn down the voltage needs or have faster ram for future cpu upgrades . 
  * i am not quite sure about how this all works 100 % . 
  for example xmp might be able to push the memory speed a bit ( or the usage speed ) or maybe overclocking might give the cpu the possibility to accept higher speeds . 
  only the mobo cant keep up with to fast speeds but i guess that wont be a problem anymore today because the nearly all support speeds up to 2400hz *, 
   creative ssd placement for an 1000 bucks build !, 
  ftfy !, 
   this gigantic gpu does ` nt fit in the first slot, 
  s/he tried ... 
  sitting here and thinking about my build and how it all will work out . 
  all parts are laying here since 2 weeks but i am still not sure if i like it this way or if i should ship them back and change them .
