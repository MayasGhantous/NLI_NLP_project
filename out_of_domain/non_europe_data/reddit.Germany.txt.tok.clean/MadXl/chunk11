  * yes i am german * ( \uff61 \uff65 _ \uff65 \uff61 ), 
  your psu supports 2x 8 pin wich is enough for your graphic card and if you have normal parts in your pc 600w will be enough . 
  i dont think the cpu will bottleneck , because that is one of the best i5 ( lg1150 ) at the moment . 
  a i7 is only a good choice for rendering in comparision . 
  even if you might get the feeling that your cpu does stop your performance you can overclock it if you arent yet . 
  do you have [ this ] ( http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc ) downloaded or looked at [ this ] ( http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-connect-a-ps4-controller-to-pc/ ) ? 
  what are you going to do with it . 
  do you need more than 6 sata ports ? 
  dual gpu slots or is one x16 enough and the others running on 8 and 4 ? 
  what cpu do you have ? 
  do you need anything special ? 
  atx form factor ? 
  4 ram slots with max 64 gb or 32 ? 
  normally , if programms load slowly and the complete performance is low , then the pc is the problem or laptop in this case . 
  if you open up a browser kind of fast but it takes long to load websites its your internet connection . 
  if possible try what / u/majoroutage said but be aware to be able to reinstall your os and backup everything important before . 
  hahahahh 19 thermal compounds are worse than mayonaise . 
  i guess if still have some fresh at home \u25f4 _ \u25f6, 
  sure no problem . 
  my choices would be in descending order :,

  * while i dont really took the complete time to check everything . 
   up to 2 gpus and extension card, 
  then the pcie slots will be running at 8/4/4 wich to me doesnt sound good for sli but you might try it . 
  the other difference are that the asrock ( even if i dont recommend it as the best brand ) has thought of oc and safety parts build in that resist higher temp and power . 
  the other order was dependent on the number of sata slots and what i think might be the best order . 
  you still should check everone of them out . 
  * if you cant decide , choose the one that has a good deal at your place or does look decent enough from the color theme to match your other parts . 
  if i can further help you i will try my best . 
  because it is a k70 you should look over at / r/mechanicalkeyboards, 
   [ keyboard cleaning guides ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards/wiki/keyboardmaintenanceguides ), 
  sorry cant give you a defined answer but i always have the problem while chosing parts . 
  i guess this depends on how much you weight looks and usage . 
  while you keep the same card every brand does some small things a litle bit different . 
  i always did look out for the best card for my money , then for 3 good brands or special deals at that moment and then chose one that is nice to look at and not completely out of my color theme but still not the worst . 
  this is olaf . 
  and this is olaf . 
  and this is olaf . 
  and this is ... ah yes olaf . 
  and this is olaf . 
  and i am ... [ of course  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icc7uumpg7i ), 
  for a litle money safer you could think about [ this ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-z97extreme4 ) or one of [ those ] ( http://www.gigabyte.de/products/comparison/list.aspx?ck=2&amp;pids=4957,4960,4953 ) depending on what you want . 
  i personally only need one gpu and have i5-4690k and have choosen the gaming 5 but as you said you dont want a weird lan controller you might not take that one . 
  edit : probably only the udh3 version of the gigabyte mobos will fit best because of a intel lan controller and 3 pcie lanes ( 2 for your gpu and 1 for the extension card ) . 
  maybe you could tell me your overview of what parts you have or going to buy ( pcpartpicker ) and i could look further what fits your needs best . 
  the powersupply is great as long as you stay with the one gpu . 
  with one more gpu you should get a 800w psu . 
  back to the mobo , what extension card had you in mind before ? 
  because if it fits in a pcie x1 slot than we can take the [ gigabyte ga-z97x-sli ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz97xsli ) or the [ asus z97-e ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-z97e ) . 
  other than that , my best recommendation stays at the [ gigabyte ga-z97x-ud3h ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz97xud3h ) of wich there is actually a black edition if you dislike the bright yellow color :p, 
  i was near buying that one too but the have choosen the gaming 5 because i * wanted * a gaming lan controller . 
  havent used it yet tho but wanted to try it out . 
  i defentely understand your perspective and tolerate it . 
  still i hope the ud3h works out for you wich i would take in your position . 
  * pls still check everypart compability with the mobo you going to choose , i havent done everyone . 
  looks good , but why are you using a amd + gpu ? 
  for the same money you could use a i3-4170 with integrated graphics if they arent really gaming . 
  and wouldnt a win 7/8/8 .1 to windows 10 upgrade be cheaper ? 
  sure you can play with your chosen setup . 
  and yes all 7 and 8 versions except the enterprise version ( as far as i remember ) get the free upgrade or can be upgraded with the [ media creation tool ] ( http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install ) . 
  i dont know if you have understood my point of the integrated graphics and if you still want to go the amd route there is nothing wrong . 
  i just wanted to metion that there are quite much [ games ] ( http://www.intel.com/support/de/graphics/sb/cs-034979.htm ) that can be played with only the integrated graphics of a intel cpu . 
  * the list is considering a i5 not i3 but it has the same integrated graphic unit . 
  just isnt as powerfull *, 
  hope i could help and yes if you dont want to change anything your pcpartpicker list will work for browser games no problem . 
  then i guess the gigabyte ga-z97x-ud3h works best for your money , needs and what you want . 
  * btw i wouldnt recommend any soundcard . 
  if you want better sound get a dac *, 
  hope that works out and i could help . 
  if any problem or question turn up dont hesitate to ask . 
  i will try my best , 
  have you tried this ? 
   for windows 10 users , the xbox one wired headset and the xbox one stereo headset are compatible with a pc when connected through the xbox one controller , as long as the firmware has been updated to the latest version . 
  to ensure you have the latest firmware for your controller and headset , see [ update your xbox one controller ] ( http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter ) . 
  have you tried running the normal programm in kompability mode ? 
  maybe the problem stays because microsoft actually dont want you to be able to use your controller on the pc without their new [ xbox 360 wireless gaming receiver ] ( http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows ) . 
  * that would be annoying *, 
  hey again  most of the time the ram doesnt work fluently if you overclock it . 
  i would not recommend it because most of the time the advancement is very small . 
  if you really want to i would check reviews if it is possible and stable . 
  otherwise check for 2133 ram with good cas latency and take that . 
  like you dont want to be able to use it anymore on your keyboard ? 
  [ then this might help ] ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/216893 ) . 
  why is everybuild using the h100 or h100i ? 
  i just bought a h110 and got the feeling i did something wrong ( havent checked if it fits , waiting for other parts to build ) . 
  oh okay , thanks . 
  i was just confused because the h110 looks more powerfull and fits better in the h440 but most builds use different cooling options . 
  * maybe i am special * \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i guess you have gone with [ this ] ( http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/gbrg7p ) build . 
  sadly your case doesnt have a usb 2.0 port . 
  you can not install windows 10 with a windows 7 key as long as you havent upgraded from windows 7 on that hardware before . 
  but you can install windows 7 as far as i know with just a keyboard . 
  tab for switching space for un/checking hitboxes and enter for aproval . 
  that way you should be able to install windows 7 . 
  from there upgrade to 10 with mouse and keyboard and the media creation tool . 
  the system will know how to start up . 
  if it doesnt find any drivers the mobo takes one that fits best or it goes to integrated graphics on your intel cpu if you have one .
