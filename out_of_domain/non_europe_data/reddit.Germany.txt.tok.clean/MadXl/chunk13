  hapiness will come in 45 days . 
   use your same product key during install, 
  you dont need this . 
  microsoft makes their own key in the first update process . 
  that is related to the mobo and with the new install windows checks with their server , finds the same mobo key and installs without a key needed . 
  * and * a windows 7 or 8 key will never work to my knowledge in a new windows 10 install as long as you havent used the upgrade function but then you dont need the key anyway . 
  what temperature is hitting the 80 \u00b0 mark ? 
  if it is the vrm i have read that it can work up to 125 \u00b0 . 
  if it is the chip , i would at least do the same as with the cpu and never go above 90 \u00b0,

  ~ ~ my google search told me the msi gaming app is used to oc your ** gpu ** not cpu ... this might be the problem . 
  cpu and gpu dont work the same and cant be overclocked the same way . ~ ~, 
  i would highly recommend to stop overclocking your cpu with a app . 
  check your bios if you can for one disable overclocking at the moment and disable the gaming app and check your cpu again . 
  and by the way 0,8 ghz are 800 mhz , 
  well for the same questions over and over again . 
  i know . 
  i am just saying that some like to make a new post . 
  i personally , if i am at a new subreddit , dont watch at the stickies ... so not everybody asks their questions there even if that would be the better place to do, 
  still the problem stays . 
  and i wont recommend any use of a app that overclocks or bios that does it for you . 
  check yourself , do it yourself , be safe . 
  found [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmgwnml.jpg ) today and remembered our conversation .

  i am not sure tho . 
  * i got it on my first kill of steven ... * i am sorry, 
  can we please get a subreddit flair for you sir ? 
  something like this i guess . 
  it doesnt make it better for your pc but as long as your intake fans are accumulating cool air from the other side ( not radiator ) then it will work just like a normal pc in a hot room . 
  if possible simply try not to put your radiator on highest setting and if you overclock let a bigger temperature span as safety . 
   early afterbirthers, 
  not sure what you mean but i bought it allready . 
  well then get at them ( / \u25d4 \u25e1 \u25d4 ) /, 
  i work in it and i must say , helping out on bapc is much more pleasing . 
  you actually feel that you helped and how much they appreciate the time and accompany . 
  while on work they know i get money to do it so i hear rarely a thanks or see that they are happy again . 
  more like they dont hate me anymore that they broke something and i could fix it . 
  cpu cooler and fans by the case are complete different things for different parts . 
  and yes you need a cpu cooler . 
   nami checks out . 
  ftfy, 
   not sure if it 'd hurt , or be shit tons of fun, 
  to loose your arm .

  thanks a lot . 
   msi p67a-c43 ( b3 ) - dual memory architecture, 
  have you installed the ram in the right slots ? 
  like the 2gb in the blue and the 4 gb in the black or the other way around ? 
  does the machine start with just one 4 gb and one 2 gb stick ? 
  2 mins in and s/he says its booting up . 
  takes probably longer . 
  dual memory architecture only trys its best to use the right ram slots together . 
  if you dont have marching ram it still should work . 
  dual memory or quad memory are just a 8 % better performance if i remember correctly . 
  i will take a look at your problem on monday if it hasnt fixed itself if that is okay for you . 
  anymore information like your system specs would help by the way . 
   have a nice weekend, 
  no problem at all , nice to hear that it works now . 
  maybe the dual memory ist not blue and blue or black and black but blue and black . 
  dont know but anyway . 
  it works wich is the best . 
  always happy if i could help . 
  not sure if that might help but what i found was, 
   fix is about head phones , but not the wire it 's jack for phone with mic pin . 
  if you unplug it a little , it makes everything work . 
  i guess it is a problem with the realtek driver or chipset . 
  or something in that directon . 
  not sure . 
  i would say , if there are any update problems install them groupwise . 
  all . net and all windows updates and so on together . 
  what windows are you using ? 
  well you could install them all one by one but that takes a lot of time and is tedious ( or however you write that ) . 
  i meant by that to install not all 96 of them at once but if you can just install the first 20 or so . 
  if i disunderstood you and you only have one update i would say try again . 
  if it fails again you might want to search that updates name on google . 
  i would like to add to the comment of offthtwall that the benefit performance wise might not be the biggest in comparison but you would allready have ddr4 ram and compartible motherboard wich is a thing to think about for the future if you upgrade at the moment . 
  basically what you said . 
  the only difference is that some cases dont have space for a drive . 
  the performance should be the same . 
  you may want to take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/sli/bridges ) . 
  i am not sure performance wise how it will work out if you use more than one bridge but i would not do it . 
  i would guess it will not be as efficient . 
  just wanted to answer before your question gets lost . 
  you are searching for a 3.0 to 2.0 cable intern . 
  probably called something else in your language . 
  [ example ] ( http://www.amazon.com/sienoc-motherboard-female-housing-cable/dp/b00eoi3vc8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1444726943&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=usb+3.0+to+usb+2.0 ), 
  yes that looks good . 
  btw : a covered link is [ what you want to display ] ( link ) , 
  `` but our windows arent even open yet '', 
  thats nice to hear .
