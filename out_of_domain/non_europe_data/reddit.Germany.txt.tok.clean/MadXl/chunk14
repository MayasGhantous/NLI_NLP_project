  thanks for the feedback that i wasnt wrong  no problem at all , happy to know everything works for you again . 
  have fun with it . 
  so clean , so smooth . 
  like it . 
  but wait . 
  you ruined it with that one last survivor of you last work-fight . 
  you missed a paperclip . 
  except that , nice bs . 
  why should it turn itself on in the first place ? 
  or what do you mean with `` before you are ready '' ? 
  i guess you missed the point of :, 
   ** usb ** - hubs, 
  some of this reminded me of [ idiocracy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/ ), 
  ah i get it . 
  the point was i would never work on the insides of the machine without the psu in the offstate nor forgetting to turn it back on . 
  but basically i only work on my own / r/battlestations  at work everyone got notebooks . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  i am sorry ... 
  your link is only working if you buy something after an advertisement and get something else . 
  what / u/christurnbull said is that a contract is not guilty if someone has made a typo . 
  it doesnt cares about user protection . 
  this offer is simply wrong . 
  in addition to that an advertisement is not a direct offer . 
  the shop has to accept it too . 
  and here they probably wont . 
  for one i guess we have different laws here in germany . 
  but my point was that a wrong advertisement is not misleading . 
  it is wrong in its stated form for trying to sell something the wont have . 
  there is a difference between trying to mislead a customer on purpose or making a typo and not knowing about it . 
  not feeling bad about reading :, 
   vampires are human, 
  not until you mentioned it but ^ dont ^ worry ^ i ^ wont ^ tell ^ anyone, 
  i feel sorry for you . 
  i am blessed with 6 ' 4 '' size 9-10 and 7.5 inch ... \u25f4 _ \u25f6, 
  not in any way , have i messed up the metric conversion ? 
  the complicated way to install with 7/8 first and then upgrade with the media creation tool is just needed if you dont have a windows 10 key . 
  a fresh install of windows 10 doesnt register those / accept those . 
  if you have a windows 10 key you are able to use the windows 10 install directly . 
  for the other question answer / u/jamvanderloeff , 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.howtogeek.com/128397/does-hard-drive-orientation-affect-its-lifespan/?pagespeed=noscript ) it doesnt matter . 
  maybe try not to adjust it diagonally but it seems to not affect the hdd much if any . 
   odds, 
  i guess i cant read . 
  not the first time sadly . 
  anyway . 
  optical drives function by setting the disc up on a `` hook '' wich turns them . 
  as long as this `` hook '' it there it can work horizontal or vertical . 
  i would say all modern drives use this functionality . 
  thats about my knowledge . 
  my xbox360 works great in upside state with the drive in vertical axis . 
  as long as you dont try to run it upside down it should work . 
  hope that helps now , 
  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af the internet, 
  yep you are correct . 
  the mct is basically just needed if the windows 7 or 8 isnt giving you the option to upgrade on its own . 
  not sure but i think it is because of how microsoft wants all windows upgraded but dont overflow there update server . 
  the mct just upgrades your windows ( if possible ) . 
  because you allready have a windows 10 iso and a valuable key you dont need the media creation tool . 
  the reason you might have read that so often that it is needed is because windows 7 and 8 ( .1 ) dont get accepted by a fresh windows 10 install . 
  in that instance a win10 key is needed . 
  to get a fresh install of win10 ( if wanted and only having a 7 or 8 key ) you need to install windows 7 or 8 first and activate it . 
  then upgrade it ( maybe with the mct ) . 
  while upgrading to windows 10 the microsoft server looks at your hardware and assigns a key with it . 
  now the microsoft activation server knows your device . 
  then you are able to wipe the disk and make a new install with your win10 iso for example . 
  in the activation process the microsoft server checks your hardware sees an allready existing key and lets you pass . 
  i hope this was not to much information but rather all questions are answered . 
  back in my old appartment i had the same problem but for the tv signal . 
  basically i drilled a hole through the wall disambled the plug and resambled it on the other site . 
  this might be a bit complicated and time consuming tho . 
  you may drill a bigger hole or let the cable run up the wall and go thrue the doorway on the top side . 
  that way ( if the cable is the same as the wall color ) most people wont see it . 
  so basically from left to right in the doorway without noticing . 
  what floor do you have ? 
  could you extend it around the door ? 
  i mean most doors have a frame that sticks a bit out of the wall . 
  sadly it is power . 
  still there exist things like [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/flat-electrical-power-extension-cover/dp/b0013lqdp6 ) . 
  you may need something compared to this if your plug wont fit . 
  it is bad if done to often ? 
  what could happen or better asked , why ? 
  \u25c9 _ \u25c9 what if my arms arent that long . 
  well if you stick the cable nice and tight to the frame and if it is the same color then it doesnt look ugly at all i would say . 
  depends on how you secure it of course . 
  good luck anyway to find something that fit your preferences . 
  so basically [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3pf2bz/you_lost_something_bro/cw61wiv ) but then your x-axis would be wrong too . 
  129.780 if you take [ this ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/sylvanas/ninq/achievement ) ninq ( archievmentscore ), 
  my boss always says then : `` we have bought new tech that is adapting to the user . '', 
  that would confuse me even more \u25d6 | \u25d4 \u25e1 \u25c9 | \u25d7, 
  but still they should let you get back to your account because it is the right answer . 
  security questions doesnt mean it has to be the truth . 
  if it would be it is less secure . 
  its like when our internet was down in the company because something failed it the serverroom ( dont remember ) and they all called in telling us that their internet is down and if they should send us a ticket by mail . 
  well i learned 10 finger writing but because most of the time if i write its in a game i dont want to align my fingers correctly first . 
  so i am much slower at 10 finger than my 6 finger writing i do right now . 
  with the test that is 50 wpm wich is enough for my normal day to day writing . 
  not sure either but under 10 years . 
  my main problem is that my fingers are a bit funny because of something i did because of boredom when i was younger . 
  basically my ring fingers tend to snap in position if they are fully stretched and then i cant directly bend them . 
  strange i know xd .
