  i know by time comes the mempry where to rest the fingers to have the perfect position . 
  at the moment i can write without looking , even without seeing what i write and it is still right . 
  personally i like resting my pinky on shift or strg and be able to use alt with my thumb wich is why i would rather not shift my wasd keys over . 
  i guess i should go back and try to write in touch typing . 
  first of all i should get a better keyboard anyway xd, 
  well if you type in your key you should see the download options . 
  because i dont have a key i cant check for a english version but there should be or at least a global version with different language packets . 
  if that is still not working i used this from an other site :, 
  [ 64 ] ( http://10gbit.winfuture.de/47f111d479984ca6a5a0928f2e5ea18a/562636fe/de_windows_7_professional_with_sp1_x64_dvd_u_676919.iso ), 
  * use at your own risk tho *, 
  thats very strange ... not even german on there . 
  i guess under romanian arent better options . 
  is your key english ? 
  sometimes they get you with that . 
  or use my link . 
  because you are interested in how many ways reddit can confuse you that some things are a thing and known . 
  download the rest of comon stuff from [ ninite ] ( https://ninite.com/ ) . 
  like winrar , notepad + + , an antivirus programm , ( java ), 
  what os are you using ? 
  [ temperature ] ( http://www.hwinfo.com/ ) , [ new backgrounds ] ( https://unsplash.com/ ) and all the drivers for your hardware ( specially gpu if you havent done that allready ), 
  and of course the reason why you wanted a pc in the first place , gaming ? 
  streaming ? 
  all of it ? 
  go for it !, 
  well good luck then . 
  if they cant help you you might search for an iso on google but keep in mind that most of them are not clean . 
  well thats good news . 
  i guess microsoft doesnt care about windows 7 anymore . 
  all they care about is to get more people using windows 10 . 
  `` everytime a text starts with stanley i cant unhear the voice nor resist to play a complete evening ... '' - stanley said to him self, 
  stanley could go out and see the beatiful world around him and all the things life has to offer but he would rather be standing in this complete empty and boring broomcloset . 
  stanley just didnt know what to do anymore . 
  well even if you wouldnt have had that key it makes more sense to buy a windows 7 key and upgrade it then buying a new windows 10 . 
  `` hell - '' '' - desk '', 
  still no !, 
   browser, 
  ftfy i mean we are still techs , 
  well its 16:28 ... 
  at least then all people would have a brain . 
  i still doubt all will use it though . 
  there is a difference between the needs and the gains . 
  for one ssds work faster because of the other memory storage option compared to hdds . 
  likewise they are not as cheap as hdds even for the same amount of storage space . 
  back to topic , gta v needs to load much information , a ssd with higher working speed helps in this manner of fact . 
  in comparison office workers mostly dont need fast loading times . 
  they are working with word or excel or outlook and web . 
  the arent loading as much and even for their needed data a hdds is fast enough . 
  on the other side they need most likely storage space . 
  the higher you go the more you see the cost difference between ssd and hdd . 
  last but not least ssds are on the same level of reliability compared to day to day use hdds but are much quicker why you would see many people suggesting to buy one . 
  even if you buy a small one like 250 gb you get the performance boost as long as you install your programms and os on it . 
  you are still able to store movies and such data on an additional hdd with much bigger volume . 
  not only what / u/killmeplsok said but also you could buy a windows 7 key and upgrade it ( if not enterprise if i remember correctly ) . 
  most of the windows 7 keys are even cheaper . 
  then install , activate , update and use the media creation tool . 
  [ professinal ] ( http://www.chip.de/downloads/c1_downloads_hs_getfile_v1_71028071.html?t=1445500440&amp;v=3600&amp;s=37788b3233208bbfb1d0fb08d07aeb2b ) or here the [ other links but i am not sure if they work ( oh and german xd ) ] ( http://www.technikkram.net/2013/10/microsoft-office-2013-offizielle-direct-download-links ), 
  if you need more help or your version isnt listed let me know and i look what i can do . 
  if you want to go windows 10 still think about getting a windows 7 key and upgrading from there . 
  this is most of the time cheaper . 
  for more information or how to just ask . 
  i would buy the second one just to be sure . 
  i am not quite familiar with how hot the pcb can get but i know the graphic card can go up above 100 celsius and still work fine . 
  i would risk to have burning or melting glue dripping in my graphic card . 
  well i couldnt decide either . 
  because i dont know anything about what brand could be better i just can work it out by the given information . 
  by the way my 6 old minitor is working just fine ( unrelated ) . 
  i can see you want a hdmi 23 '' lcd backlight monitor with build in speakers with 1920 x 1080 . 
  my ordering of the ones you mentioned are :, 
  but the real question is : why you want a 23 '' ? 
  i guess you have a 100 - 200 $ budget and searching on newegg ? 
  [ then why not this ? 
  ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16824014377 ), 
  i guess there wouldnt be a problem as long as the tray can open and close without a problem . 
  because it is an relativly unfunctional part ( the front bezel ) i would give my thumbs up but i havent done any vinyl yet . 
  you might get in a second thought from someone else . 
  good luck . 
  well i guess my weigting of the facts is different then yours . 
  i personally would rather have a bigger screen and shorter response time than a bigger viewing angle or contrast . 
  gaming related . 
  but if you watch more than is resonable to get a higher viewing angle . 
  i get that . 
  by the way i was using a old tv a long time for my main screen that i dont bother personally about a bigger bezel . 
  it was like 3 cm . 
  my ordering was because of :, 
  4 has the most for its money . 
  bigger screen and the typicall . 
  2 has basically the same but a litle smaller screen . 
  1 is better than 3 if you compare the price wich outweights the additional 0.8 '' screen . 
  if you dont care about the money ( you mentioned you would pick 3 the most ) then i would go in a other direction . 
  with the new information i would take something like [ this ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=9sia2f83426016&amp;cm_re=23_inch_monitor_ips-_-24-009-483-_-product ) . 
  by the way i guess you want a build in speaker for the sound but i can recommend to get basic speakers like a 2.0 usb ones for cheap . 
  even these can output most of the time a better sound . 
  its the same with tvs . 
  buy a display for its display and not the sound . 
  in the most reviews i saw a bad performance soundwise . 
  then again if you dont need a speaker is a hdmi the only option ? 
  i guess if you want further help or thoughts i might need a gpu / integrated grapic port you can use . 
  what you plan on doing ( more than just watching shows / films ? ), 
  and probably if there is anything else i should know . 
  hope i can help and remember that i am just someone of the internets and you should still decide on your own what you buy .
