  in my opinion it is the motherboard but it will be better for you to ask again what to do about a non post and no beep in the daily thread . 
  i will go to sleep now but will search for anything helpfull tomorrow as i said and will come back to you then, 
   apple user, 
  said enough, 
  at least the microsoft guy was smart enough to understand the problem and describe the problem solver with an accetable answer for the ( l ) user . 
  well for me the only reason why i dont like oddshot is that it isnt implemented in res as far as i know . 
  so i cant just browse reddit and watch all the vids without clicking on the link . 
  i then go to the comments and watch it there . 
  can you check if your system is running fine ? 
  cmd ( admin ) with, 
  sfc / scannow, 
  then wich driver number do you currently use ? 
  are windows 8 driver working maybe ? 
  do you clean and custom install those ? 
  what is happening if you are using both gpus without the sli-bridge ? 
  how is your resolution ? 
  maybe trying it to start with a resolution under 1920x1080 or that . 
  do you get any error messages ? 
  in the log ? 
  did you reinstalled with a clean install ? 
  have you tried to deinstall your current drivers with [ ddu ] ( http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html ) to get a really clean install ? 
  you might also check if it helps to install a older driver from [ here ] ( http://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx?lang=en-us ) . 
  also i found [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/3p89ys/anyone_found_the_solution_to_no_display_signal/ ) or check under / r/nvidiahelp for a solution . 
  because i havent found it and i am to late to the party :, 
   buy a book and read it . 
  then bring it back . 
  i have done this once waiting 6 hours and i got through the most of the book and gave it back . 
  free reading , 
  ( \u3065 \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) \u3065 here they are, 
  the safe is on the way , i am just blind and cant figure out how to gift it to your username directly . 
  i send you a friend request . 
  i hope the i can send it to you asap . 
   relevant xkcd, 
  of course, 
  hey i just saw your request and currently i am looking to gift the game to someone anyway . 
  i will send you a friend request and you will get not only rebirth but also afterbirth ( wich comes out in about 26 hours ) too :d, 
  the three of us can now play cards together . 
  if a 4th one wants to join ** you ** are allowed to pick the game ( * yes i meant you !, 
  sure that would do the trick too . 
  do as you like and feel free to pm me . 
  actually i got it to work now with your friend invite acception . 
  i wish you good luck , a happy day and a good start tomorrow with afterbirth, 
  maybe it can attract dead cats ? 
  is that then called a lockedlockbox ? 
  is is better to have a lockedlockedlockbox ? 
  ( \u3065 \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) \u3065 let the hype go wild !, 
  normal or blue one ? 
  i feel with you \u2665 \u256d \u256e \u2665, 
  help is on the way my friend . 
  specially if you are hungry and the kitchen is to long of a walk . 
  for me its often the fresh air that gives my brain a full 0 to 100 % and because my blood is full of alcohol it gets bad really fast . 
  inside everything is fine , 1 step out of the door and i have a blackout . 
  instantly . 
  i would love this feeling . 
  i only have the feeling of :, 
  * hey you are drunk *, 
  * and hungry *, 
  lets go home, 
  * wait for it *, 
  for what ? 
  * you drunk to much , here take it back * boarrrrghhhhg, 
  getting fine home and then cant sleep for 3 hours because you know your belly is just waiting till you dont concentrate . 
  he tried to kill me twice . 
  no trust . 
  never again . 
  and guess who can be upgraded easily if something breakes or gets to old ? 
  if you are using you laptop to stay home on the same table everyday just for gaming its not worth it . 
  just catching this comment to get knowledge too if possible . 
  waiting for response . 
  if i get you right , you have an internal and an external odd ? 
  if the cables to the internal odd are connected right and in the boot menu ( f12 or f8 most likely ) it shows you the odd and you ssd you should be able to install it . 
  i dont quite get why you have a nother drive connected for your support disk . 
  that is not needed at the moment . 
  those disks are there to help your os find all needed drivers but are often outdated . 
  if your pc works and has internet connection i would suggest to download the driver you want to get directly from the site of your manufacturer . 
  back to your problem : if you go in the bios settings ( f1 maybe ) then under advanced options ( f7 ) then go to boot and there the option csm . 
  what is the settings there ? 
  have you allready enabled xmp or changed your ram speed in the bios ? 
  maybe turn this back to normal and after the completed install turn it back on / up . 
  for one yes range extenders can work . 
  [ for example ] ( http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/b00q6cc2j8?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00 ) . 
  that beside , how far is the router away ? 
  like is there no way of laying down a cable because even up to 50m they work without a loss of performance . 
  what router do you have at the moment ? 
  because most other people recommend [ these ] ( http://www.cnet.com/topics/networking/best-networking-devices/power-line-adapters/ ) i will mention them too . 
  the fact that the need a good electric wiring and can have problems on their own while not beeing that cheap are my personal nopes . 
  do you have a pc / laptop ? 
  full wireless ? 
  b/g/n / and c ? 
  possible from both router and your end device ? 
  all in all it could be a good idea to buy a new router . 
  just keep in mind to get some more information on your isp because some provider make it quite complicated to use your own device . 
  basically we need to change your gpu and cpu and because of this also the mobo . 
  you can stay with the ram and probably your case ( wich you didnt mention ) . 
  also i am not sure about your power supply but basically it doesnt hurt that much to change it out sometimes . 
  basically its a new build without the storage . 
  [ so your job is now to go through the posts of this subreddit with `` fallout 4 ready '' in their tag and check out the builds . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/search?q=fallout+4&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month ), 
  [ this ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/yybpsy ) and [ this ] ( http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/zvyhhx ) look quite nice . 
  remember that you can safe out on ram and hdd but i suggest getting a 250 ssd if you havent got one yet .
