  if you still unsure or need more help feel free to ask . 
  oh and then a complete list ( preferred pcpartpicker.com ) of your system would be nice , 
  most likely it is written on the side of it . 
  you may have to look throught the manufactures list to get the one you have . 
  if it is not possible to find out or complicated it might be that it is a not so known brand or simply old . 
  most have something written on the back or side of it .

  ftfy, 
  then you might need to change your smile from, 
  never gon na let you down . 
  well you can check it out [ here ] ( http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=5013&amp;game=fallout%204 ) if you might be able to run the game . 
  but because nobody knows the excact needs for the game this could be higher then needed wich then again would say you need a cpu upgrade . 
  because a gpu upgrade isnt bound to any other upgrade and will work in your current system as well as in one if you want to upgrade in the future it is defenetly possible to upgrade only your gpu right now and just test if you are able to play . 
  i have read that the gpu should be at least the gtx 550 ti to be able to run fallout 4 . 
  it depends on how much money you want to spend . 
  just keep in mind that cards with high energy needs might need a better psu . 
  specially since you got a prebuild one i would recommend this upgrade ( most of the prebuild sellers use medium to crap psus ) . 
  so on your list should now be to check for a new gpu that can fit in your case !, 
  and a matching psu . 
  if you have a price in mind i guess the daily thread can help you out better with that . 
  i am not quite sure about psus wich are good and so on . 
  this would be my complete upgrade suggestion :,

  internet is not needed yet . 
  the disk for the drivers or manually install via internet only works after a operatingsystem got installed correctly . 
  i dont know of a fix yet and because it crys for the right drivers i guess it needs those . 
  if you have another installation medium around by any luck , try install windows 7 or 8 for example without a key and after that a clean install of windows 10 should work . 
  you might test out what happens if you put in the driver disc you got and try to boot from that but i doubt that is going to work . 
  you might ask a friend for a usb stick and install windows 10 from there if nothing helps ... 
  [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3lzihz/windows_setup_could_not_install_one_or_more/cvao83j ) had a simular problem . 
  xmp is a memory profile for your ram . 
  because your ram hast 2133 clock speed wich is not normal xmp automatically adjusts its intern clock cycle so that cpu and ram can work together faster . 
  ( / \u25d4 \u25e1 \u25d4 ) / good luck everyone !, 
  well a cat5e cable or cat6 cable can be used up to 160 ft without data loss . 
  if it doesnt bother anyone that there is a cable running around the house this would be a great and relativ simple solution . 
  you might even drill a hole through the wall to cut some distance if that is possible . 
  while 60 ft doesnt sound much but on the other hand you said 4 rooms i guess there are at least 2 walls in between you and the router wich shortens the signal . 
  a range extender sounds good to me considering your pc has allready good connection and some people say on amazon that the range is quite short . 
  that might be the problem . 
  i dont know how your isp is handling it but i guess googling to change the router or calling them would safe you time and money . 
  but if you have big walls in between even that might no help much wich gets us back to range extender wich also makes your smartphone to internet access better or if you have a laptop , 
  i hope i could help . 
  by the way dont buy a cat7 cable . 
  it is more a marketing strategy to sell them . 
  for one , yes the cable can transport data better and faster but on the other hand , the plug is still the same and cant let more data through . 
  just buy a cat5e cable with a good shielding ( s/ftp ) . 
  well for one you might try to see what your pc does if you try to boot from the drivers disc from your motherboard , maybe it works and the problem is then gone . 
  other than that , if you or someone you know doesnt have a install medium at hand , you should get a usb-stick and install the windows 10 installation data on there . 
  * if you keep your receipt from the shop you might even be able to bring it back after you got it to work and you dont need the usb stick anymore . 
  not really , i have the not so fast variation of the one i showed you at home but using it with mixed feelings . 
  havend tried yet if it might be my laptop wich is wonky . 
  [ this might help you ] ( http://wi-fi-booster-review.toptenreviews.com/ ), 
  well as long as the cable for the ssd is still fully connected there should not be a problem with disconnecting the hdd , i think i did the same but also had some problems with windows 10 . 
  i am really not sure what could cause the problem nor how to fix it easily sadly . 
   ~ ~ gf ~ ~ right hand, 
  ftfy, 
  if i am not wrong , you can rotate pictures with imgur ( edit ) . 
  aside from that nice clean look and i want a big enough table for 3 monitors now - . -, 
  did the same when my new 55 '' tv came and my living room couch is only max 2m away . 
  some say far to big , i say playing splitscreen is awesome . 
  had a 1360 x 768 monitor too ... used my old tv for my main monitor with more than 8 ms input lag . 
  wasnt great but big . 
  now they are both just my second and third monitor . 
  you get there !, 
  i promise it is worth it . 
  just step it up slowly . 
  why would you sell yours ? 
  thats even better / s, 
  last time i bought a keyboard ( not sure if it is even a real mech ) i went to the shop and bought 3 different ones , took them all home , unpacked them and tested the clicks and clacks . 
  then i went back to them and gave to back . 
  basically i could test them . 
  just a big time consuming situation . 
  btw : is a logitech g110 a mech ? 
  ( like a real one and not just a marketing one ? ), 
  in my understanding a and 1 operation anulates anything that isnt a 1 to a zero and all ones stay 1 . 
  normally true and true give true / false and false give false as well as false and true . 
  this is because if the left side is the same as the right side it is true or in binary a 1 . 
  but i mixted it up quite big so just dont look at this answer . 
  i am sorry . 
  i guess the problem is that you should have done that before changing the pixels . 
   3 points, 
  headshot should be worth more points imo, 
  did you count from the start or did you start over with counting ? 
  oh well then ... my bad . 
  thanks for the reminding insight . 
  well then , thanks and i know now what to get for christmas , 
  well apparently i cant read . 
  i am sorry .
