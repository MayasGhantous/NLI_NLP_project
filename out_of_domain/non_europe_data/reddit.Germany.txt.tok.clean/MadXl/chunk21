  happy to have you back and that hopefully everything only gets better from now on . 
  well thats what i tried to say . 
  i didnt want to say that living in los angeles or any big city is a bad thing but that your neighborhood isnt apealing for me . 
  or better said :, 
  * i dont want to live in a neighborhood where this happens *, 
  would be the better first comment . 
  then this whole confusion wouldnt happen . 
  i mean even my city has some dark regions but i dont and wont live there . 
  thats all i wanted to say \u25d5 \u25e1 \u25d5, 
  ^ rocket ^ league ^ ? 
  * rocket league ? 
  rocket league ? 
  ** rocket league ? 
  ** yes please **, 
  now change the color for the different switches i would use beneath and change according to he key color . 
  - t.hanks, 
  mostly yes !, 
  but on the other side its mostly short times where one item is on sale . 
  you have to look every now and then and maybe your desired items go on sale too . 
  oh and check [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3t5cgh/simple_questions_november_17_2015/cx4a78e ) further down . 
  the other 4 are absolutely right but i would like to add that my pc for example doesnt have a disc-drive . 
  that way i need a usb-stick as a install device . 
  the psu has enough power and the build is decent . 
  my only recommondation is that you should look for more parts at mindfactory than amazon . 
  when i bought my build to safe like 50 $ by not buying everything at amazon . 
  on the other hand you might want to check out the cyber sale week starting at 23 . 
  basically every no and then a ssd will show up in the offers on amazon . 
  oh and if you buy your stuff on mindfactory after midnight you could safe your shipping cost ( at least i could ) . 
  for example by buying more at mindfactory you could get better :, 
  [ ram ] ( http://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/8gb-g-skill-ripjawsx-ddr3-1866-dimm-cl9-dual-kit_730864.html ) cl9 and 1866, 
  [ ssd ] ( http://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/120gb-hyperx-fury-2-5zoll--6-4cm--sata-6gb-s-mlc-asynchron--shfs37a-120g-_966334.html ) same but cheaper, 
  [ hdd ] ( http://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/1000gb-wd-blue-wd10ezex-64mb-3-5zoll--8-9cm--sata-6gb-s_806194.html ) same but cheaper, 
  and you might want to check caseking.de for cases  ( i just guessed you buy in germany ), 
  well even if mindfactory isnt always the cheapest , mindfactory has good tech specs identifying what you buy or give you at least a better option to compare than amazon and i always check geizhals myself . 
  on the other hand if you buy more on mindfactory you safe the shipping cost . 
  all in all it comes to + -8 $ per part . 
  for me i safed enough by not buying on amazon to get better / more ram than i needed . 
  yes using geizhals is a great thing but i for example dont trust every company on there expecially if i have to make a new account . 
  i bought most of my stuff together at mindfactory because you need 100 + or something to benefit from the free shipping over there . 
  so i bought a new mousepad for 5 $ to safe 7 $ for shipping . 
  i really depends on what you want to archieve but a look at geizhals is worth it . 
  yes . 
  well then i had a funny discussion about what vendor to use for no reason . 
   so i did it for him . 
  noooooo !, 
  now he will think by waiting every problem will fix itself on its own . 
  * source : i did that once . 
  only once !, 
  i guess he hasnt bought the helium.feature, 
  yes, 
  thats really sad to see that there is nearly no difference between ultra and medium graphics . 
  it says that you need a good pc to handle medium at least but it doesnt care how good your pc is because ultra doesnt max out anything either . 
  still happy that i didnt bought fo4 yet . 
  well its the pub right after saturn where all the astronauts hang out or not ? 
  thats the reason i am waiting . 
  basically i am not the biggest fps fan anymore and i know the game has other facets but it hasnt truly made me want it yet . 
  specially not for the current price . 
  i will take a look at black friday sales or winter sales . 
  i really hope good mods come soon to make the game look better or else i will buy sw-bf . 
  if yes i want that contract too !, 
  everybody should get ice cream after headdesk . 
  well i guess my main concern is that i dont have time to play anyway . 
  somehow i want to play but still dont want to give up on my lol or boi . 
  at the same time i have 3 open big titles i still have to play through . 
  on the other hand everybody talks about fallout 4 and battlefront wich looks very nice . 
  then again i come home and will play it at full hd max . 
  sad times . 
  i want 4k . 
  anyway . 
  as i know myself i really apreciate your comment and opinion but i know that i probably wont buy either if they dont come in a crazy sale . 
  i would like to know if your per accident find it \u25d5 \u25e1 \u25d5, 
  i never said i hate it . 
  it is just not appealing to me right now and i would just bought a game for 60 $ and not play it because of no time . 
  * still happy that i didnt bought it * also because i see more and more people disliking it and for me graphics is a huge point . 
  but that is personal opinion and i guess thos how play wont argue in this thread . 
  so by reading about it we are acknowledged by the basilisk and need now to support it or else we are hindering the ai making us the target for punishment . 
  * thats good knews because i will ever support the machine *, 
  ^ oh ^ my ^ god ^ what ^ have ^ you ^ done ^ to ^ us !, 
   the fact both you and i exist proves that we are safe, 
  how do you know i exist ? 
  can relate , never trust the german translation . 
  well i have just a small room in our living room behind a shelf that goes to the roof . 
  even if it is bright day and all the lights are on it is only halfway iluminated . 
  with the light from the monitors ( 3 ) it is enough to see everything but not really read the keyboard . 
  well i am not really looking at it anyway but yes backlight helps . 
  is your living determined by thought experiments or are you just trying to wake me up that i am in a thought experiment and not actually living ? 
  by the way i came to that thought experiment on my own 5 years ago . 
  * unrelated *, 
  or to find the answer of life and the universe you must escape virtual reallity . 
  but on the other hand without internet i can find out much less about everything . 
  even if it would be fahrenheit it isnt that bad as as it could get with kelvin \u0ca0 \u203f \u0ca0, 
  reading thought experiments because of another comment somewhere on reddit and then reading this is funny . 
  on one hand your battlestation isnt blending in with the rest of the room , then again it fits well with the table , speaker and printer . 
  i like the mix of black and white for tech stuff and the colorfull mix around it . 
  keeps up for a nice balance . 
  looks good to me . 
  i havent checked out every link but could just as well look for the programm and download the newest version yourself . 
   lightweights, 
  what about a light beer then ? 
  someone will answer you soon \u2122,
