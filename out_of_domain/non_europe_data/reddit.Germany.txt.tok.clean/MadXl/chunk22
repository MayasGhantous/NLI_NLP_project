  oh man they look awesome . 
  specially the red one i cant get my eyes off . 
  sadly i just got reminded of the way timezones work and that you posted the giveaway when i went home ( stalking reddit mostly at work ) and it stopped when i went to work this morning but i guess thats life . 
  anyway that wont limit my heart from wanting one . 
  marked and remembered to check from time to time . 
  if that red will be avaible and my bank says yes you will get my international order absolutly . 
  they all look great but red will fit my home station best . 
  i dont even have one yet but i am allready thinking about getting 2 . 
  one for work and one for home . 
  even though i need to buy a mech for work then first , 
  great work done !, 
  * could say it another time if you want to *, 
  if you submit a new post you have the option to go for a link ( this post ) or a text post wich is then a self.oneplus-post . 
   rule 8 : screenshots are allowed in self-posts only , accompanied by descriptive text . 
  or do a double spacebar at the end to do, 
  this, 
  because they dont get the point of console ** gamers ** and pc ** users ** . 
  they simply cant see that , while a good gaming rig might not be needed to use a pc , its not hindering the usage in anyway . 
  most of them as you have said will probably have a laptop at least for 200 $ or whatever . 
  but they cant game on it . 
  so in their opinion its not wasted money . 
  they need it for school/uni/work / free time . 
  while a * pcmasterrace * gamer can archieve both in one , you could actually safe money . 
  but then again this mind will never change . 
  there will always be stupid people who cant accept that pcgaming isnt bad or expensive as well as there will always be people buying the new iphone just because it has not even a complete apple on it while android can do the same . 
  its just a matter of research and how much a person wants or is able to learn what is best . 
   over complicate things with their setup, 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  the thing , that without it , my pc wont even start xd, 
  depends if your local delivery service works on weekends . 
  i can get pakets on saturday but not on sunday because they dont work on sundays . 
  it really has nothing to do with your vendor, 
  wanted to comment tfts , happy someone else allready did . 
  thanks . 
  ** hello / u/invisibiliti **, 
  * i hope i did it right *, 
  actually i feel bad now , congratualions !, 
  \u2299 \u2299 i dont understand it but this subreddit gets me more and more confused while at the same time letting me hate illiteracy more and more . 
  or just the way some way some users think sometimes . 
  i know that right now is a good time to order and it would be here before christmas safely but my bank shakes her head everytime i want to buy something at the moment or else i wont have something to eat in a week ... dont worry i have just helped out a friend with my money and now i have to life more thoughtfull about where i spend money . 
  thanks for letting me still in the giveaway ( \u3065 \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) \u3065 and next month i can hopefully order, 
  well i am german but i dont have a german accent while speaking english but i guess the german gramar thinking sinks through sometimes . 
  after reading it again the safe is quite not what i wanted to say if you dont translate it to german first i guess , 
  this guy called 4chan maybe, 
  6247 good luck on beeing random . 
  and then you take a look at the fastest person and either, 
  they finished by bugging at 2 mins laying at the floor and still wining or, 
  they just jump over your complete obstacle like it wasnt there in the first place . 
  i like it . 
  ninja to the fullest . 
  that moment when you start to jump at the wall while upside down because your backtire has more grip then ... 
  what ?!, 
  no relevant xkcd ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://gpuboss.com/gpus/radeon-r9-380-vs-geforce-gtx-960 ) site i would prefer to pick the 380 because of more memory and a better memory bus . 
  i guess it would perform better but you also need to consider that it uses up more watt , check with your powersupply if that is enough . 
  i am really not up to date but my turtle beach wich i bought for xbox mainly and now using it for pc is still in good shape and quality . 
  you might check them out . 
  i think i dont get completly your question . 
  * others might not too , wich is why there is no answer yet *, 
  did you check for any shorts or if it fits in the pcie slot completly ( can not be removed as long as you dont press the release ) . 
  did you identify wich beep code it is ? 
  from what i found out every card till 10 '' or 25,4 cm is viable if you remove the fan there ( if i get this right ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://us.msi.com/product/graphics-card/gtx-960-2gd5.html#hero-overview ) or [ this ] ( http://accessories.dell.com/sna/products/graphic_video_cards/productdetail.aspx?c=ca&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=cadhs1&amp;sku=a8185723 ) card work as far as i know . 
  to troubleshoot a bit more , you might consider providing pictures . 
  had you enabled xmp profile for your old ram ? 
  i would try to change the ram again , go in to the bios and change it back to default values . 
  then shutdown change ram again and try . 
  til, 
  i would ( and what i found searching ) 2 gb would be good to work and play with if you have a 8 gb system . 
  if you go over to gaming ( more ) i would get a gpu, 
  we did it ( \uff9f\u30ee\uff9f ), 
  sounds like :, 
   problem not found , ticket closed . 
  android : give enough time for research and guides and you can get everything and more that windows and apple have too . 
  its just a matter of how much time you want to spend and how tech literated you are . 
  well at least now she should be able to backup on her own and not needing your behind-the-back-up . 
  lesson learned for you both i would say . 
  i guess you have mixed something up there . 
  fire for first loss where the prof had a sample and then the laptop got stolen . 
  happy to see that this tfts-post has 2 relevant xkcds after having one just before without a relevant xkcd . 
  good luck everybody . 
  for me the tom clancys division please ( \uff9f\u30ee\uff9f ), 
   sardine style train,

  shortest key press | estimated scan rate, 
  1ms | 1000hz, 
  i guess i had a short on my k-key, 
  edit : after some more got a 1 ms again . 
  shortest viable is a 15 . 
  i want to play this, 
  but i ca n't do a haiku, 
  i am so sorry, 
  well . . 
  yes its easy as that . 
  only the `` everything '' part gets a bit more complicated when you want all the other features apple and co have too . 
  oh ... just checked what iliterate means and yes thats not what i tried to say :p, 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  i was confused by the continuing d3 's at the end but it makes sense . 
  on the other hand it would make a bell curve like a 1d100 compared to the 3d34-2 . 
  both can archieve a number between 1 and 100 but some are in the second variotion more likely than the rest .
