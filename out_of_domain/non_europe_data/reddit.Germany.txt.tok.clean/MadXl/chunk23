  [ anydice ] ( http://anydice.com/ ) is a nice site to compare probabilitys . 
  if you have only one dice every side has the same probability . 
  but if you take for example 2d6 then you have different options to archieve the same result . 
  a 2 can only be rolled with 2 * 1 but, 
  a 7 can be rolled with : 6 +1,5 +2,4 +3,3 +4,2 +5,1 +6, 
  so more chances to get a 7 than a 2 or 12 . 
  with the 3d34-2 its the same . 
  the 2 is only there to give a possible 1 .

  the dark bite, 
  normally i just check diy out and apreciate what others can build but go on . 
  but with beauty i had to comment to tell you that i am jealous and hope that i can have a garden some time soon . 
  very nice build and great blooming plants . 
  good job . 
  no , he is your dad . 
  so with [ this cable ] ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/audioquest-diamond-3-3-high-speed-hdmi-cable-dark-gray-black/2383276.p?id=1218324437192 ) i can play whatever game i want a 4k ? 
  well it gets bottlenecked by the cpu but there isnt much they can change . 
  even now with the 7th core unlocked the programm can only use 60-70 % of the additional core and only if the programm gets rewritten like a new one or a old software with additional update . 
  for the 8th core i guess they wont ever unlock it because it is there to have some processing power for the system and background shit running . 
  like the `` oh you can save your last nice play even if it was 5 mins ago '' - wich basically tells the system to record and safe everything and then to delete that again if it gets not safed . 
  there isnt really much they can change . 
  are you dead now or are you dad ? 
  nevermind . 
  and replace touch with many other verbs . 
  because the main reason for root for me is more xposed than anything else because i had cm from the beginning ( now sultans mm 13 . ), 
  adblocker , adaway or minminguard for no ads, 
  amplify , greenify for battery, 
  gravitybox or any other toolbox for endless customisation that you never knew you need, 
  backupallapps and titanium to save, 
  no lock home to have my phone avaible whenever i am at home or work that i dont need to unlock it anymore, 
  custom anything because it is your phone and should be how you want it to be . 
  colors , widgets , sounds anything . 
  i know exactly where the hidden / secret room should be . 
   steam controller ? 
  yes please !, 
  all times ? 
  minecraft i guess but actually not playing it anymore ... 
  rocket league rocks, 
  thanks for the chance . 
  sims 3 please, 
  thanks for the chance, 
  you have a problem with your pc ? 
  before you ask your techsupport / friends / family first, 
  google it !!!, 
  if you cant find a answer after 20-30 min then ask someone . 
  they probably will do it for free anyway but they are not your personal search engine . 
  do them the favour and look it up yourself . 
  bonus : you find out how to resolve problems faster and how to scan for the right answer faster . 
  most of the time i google the problem for others anyway . 
  star saviors looks nice . 
  thanks for the chance . 
  i take this as a chance to go back to warhammer . 
  let my old feelings come back op . 
  yes it is possible but mostly if you have out of date software ( browser , java and so on ) and they use a 0-day breach . 
  otherwise if you surfe on safe sites with normal ads from normal destributors its safe . 
  you dont necessery need to use a vm now but just use a updated antivirus program and use ad blocker for your browser . 
  for the more advanced but concerned user you might check out ghostery , noscript and ublock for firefox for example . 
  it takes sometime to get used to but basically no site that i havent allowed yet can perform anything . 
  no java , no flash , no scripts ... on the other hand many new sites have adblocker of some sort and dont always let me pass or show the complete context . 
  but then after some clicks i can see enough . 
  in this instance i am with you . 
  if you see a mail and think it could be a virus , get the aproval that it really might be from an other worker but still click it and then deny it ... 
  i am sorry but to do a mistake happens , but denying afterwards or blaming others is a absolut no go . 
  at least you have link karma ... 
  i dont have anything usefull to participate on reddit ... 
  only 18 . times and it isnt even his final form . 
  i would say one for the couch to tv placement with the wall but on the other site you would see the back of the couch all the time and the space between the table and the couch is to narrow so version 2 fits better . 
  cl9 for ram is quite good , price maybe but it will work with your motherboard as well as a gtx 970 or 960 . 
  just remember to put it in the right x16 pci slot . 
  it should work out with your powersupply too , i have a gtx 970 myself and much more stuff and a 500w unit working fine . 
  check with your powersupply though if you can sustain your gpu no problem ( cable wise ) . 
  looks good to me . 
  just send them a copy of the needed billings and stuff so that you still have the original in case the wont accept it . 
  but i wouldnt know why not . 
  well i dont have a corsair link myself but from what i have understood on the site :, 
  you can use the temperature led mode and then apply different groups for different temperatures with different colors or not ? 
  apperently that is what i found out from [ here ] ( http://www.corsair.com/de-de/landing/corsair-link-dashboard#page=rgb-led-control ), 
  if you allready have tried this :, 
   to access this option , open the control panel by right-clicking the start button and selecting control panel . 
  navigate to system and security  system  advanced system settings . 
  click the hardware tab , click device installation settings , and select the `` no , let me choose what to do option . 
  select `` never install driver software from windows update . '', 
  with not good outcome , take a look at [ this site ] ( http://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/?pagespeed=noscript ) where they tell you that microsoft has a [ `` show or hide updates troubleshooter '' ] ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930?utm_source=twitter ) maybe it helps . 
  well if you have read the guide yourself and didnt want to change it , where exactly is your problem ? 
  it might be that because it didnt do anything in the past they have patched it out to have on useless option less . 
  sorry for not understanding your problem in the first place . 
  when i am at home i will check for the option if i can find it or not . 
  for what exactly did you need ddu ? 
  maybe it has a option to prevent auto download from microsoft . 
  have you tried deinstalling ddu again and see if something changes ? 
  it would say just resist and try to learn as much out of your home as you can or think about how your old parts will rest in peace . 
  other than that , dont open any packages . 
  just check if all parts are there and the packages dont have any bumps . 
  counter random with random.org, 
  have you taken a look at [ this ] ( http://www.corsair.com/~/media/corsair/download-files/manuals/corsair-link-manual_v2docx_.pdf ) document ? 
  at page 6 and 7 it gets explained how to do it . 
  double click your led , group it with a cpu temp for example , click on temperature mode and choose what color you want for 3 different temperatures . 
  of course dont forget to add your cpu to a group in the group tab . 
  edit : because i cant test it this is all i can do for you . 
  if it works great otherwise i am sorry and you should ask your question in the daily thread again .
