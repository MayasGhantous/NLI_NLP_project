  at least my 3 monitor setup handles that problem quite good . 
  i guess its my fault because i have anotations always off . 
  but yeah than its great to have . 
  as i said depends on the game , i cant remember the game but i know there are some where you cant double jump but still jump while falling . 
  those are 2 different things . 
  on the other hand you probably drunk that much alcohol to sterilize it , 
  i have the same problem , cross-posting my thread , if i come up with a solution i will write it here too . 
  edit : you might also check out [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/3vuoxt/post_any_snapchat_root_workarounds_you_know_please/ ) post . 
  i checked on their website but they only have germany currently for the country choice . 
  depends on where you live but because i live in germany i could send it to you without a problem if you cover the shipping . 
  no problem , just wanted to help because you sounded interested . 
  the problem is , that this way isnt working . 
  well i am using an allready rooted rom and before it was working without a problem . 
  i guess that would be the last step but then snapchat isnt worth that much of trouble for me . 
  havent found any restrictions that have something to do with snapchat nor google ( have set all back to allowed from google , still not working ), 
  i thought we were talking about thumbs and not hands ?!, 
  so i tried basically everything and then went back here to read that you also told me to test another account . 
  just did and found out that both my old accounts seem to be banned . 
  basically a short uninstall of xposed , reinstall of snapchat and login is enough or your account is banned . 
  third one now . 
  thanks for your help . 
  well i found out that snapchat must have been banning my account . 
  it works finally with a new one , should have checked that earlier . 
  thanks for your help . 
  thank you very much for the givaway . 
  tropico with the lucky 444 please . 
  crysis please, 
  thank you very much, 
  it gets even better when you know there is a part 2 and both are on amazon prime . 
  the bigger problem comes when you allready have up to 50 dice but still consider buying this bag because of the the completed sets . 
  well i got the bioshock triple pack for 7,5 on steam so there is that ... 
  whoops and thanks - fixed now . 
  i hopy / r/mechanicalkeyboards knows about your shoes . 
  specially if you buy 2 \u25d4 _ \u25d4, 
   fancy dice . 
  i have 2 of [ these ] ( http://www.amazon.com/chessex-001lbchx-pound-o-dice/dp/b008c0kxys ) so enough fancyness but nearly no good sets to chose from for every player . 
  thanks for the giveaway ( / \u25d4 \u25e1 \u25d4 ) /, 
  this might not be the best overview but i hope it helps :, 
  * cloud-based backup *, 
  it is provided by an external company . 
  most of the time , you get a software to install on your pc and in there you choose the folders that get backedup . 
  then after the set period it automatically updates your backups . 
  easy to do but costly over time . 
  * personal backup *, 
  you get an external hdd where you copy every month ( or week , depending on how often you want it ) the data over that you want to safe . 
  there are software possibilities too that can help with this step . 
  you can choose what and when to backup but you should get a reminder to not forget to backup . 
  also in case of a fire or something , if the hdd is in the same room as your pc the data is gone too . 
  personally i use google to safe the most important data , like certificates and so on , and have a local backup hdd at home . 
  this helps if your pc disks might corrupt or fail . 
  there is also a kind of new image on it to install my pc faster if it should break . 
  what i heard and remembered is the [ 3-2-1 backup method ] ( http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/world-backup-day-the-3-2-1-rule/ ) . 
  you should have 3 different copies of your data , in case you have overwritten something . 
  have 2 different formats , in case you cant backup from one and, 
  have 1 backup off-site , that in case of a fire or water damage at least the backup elsewhere is still working . 
  of course this more used in a business than by a home user but for the safety of the data the same principal works . 
  in addition to this you might think about what you put in the web and if you should encrypt your data before it goes on a server in the web . 
  if you have further questions i will kindly try to answer them as best as i can . 
  as far as i know both are the same thing just with different names , at least if it fits from the edges and round shapes in your gpu there is no problem . 
  the cant fit somewhere else i think . 
  if you want the easy way , take a app or programm . 
  for the advanced way with learning and trying to get the best out of your system while keeping the power usage down , use the bios and check out / r/overclocking, 
  does your pc normally start without any problems ? 
  is you mice powered on the same time as the pc ? 
  can you check if this happens too if you put the connector of the keyboard in a front jack or somewhere else ? 
  might be a bios setting that doesnt power on all devices directly to have a faster boot . 
  you might check if there is an option for that and if that changes anything if you disable it . 
  for further help i would like to know your mobo and os . 
  [ at least then turn everything around to please me !, 
  the hard way to never trust the internet . 
  hit their head and scream `` snoooze !!!! '', 
  then go back to bed . 
  well in this situation i would buy an external hdd and make an image of your current ssd . 
  that way you can always recover that an have a working system again . 
  in addition to that you have some space left over for other backups . 
  i wouldnt recommend a cloud based backup solution because you wont be able to access it without a working system . 
  and i would make an up to date image every 2-4 month that way you dont need to update that much if you have to recover . 
  maybe you need an usb-stick too , to boot the image software from . 
  sadly i cant tell you any good free image software but i like the o&o software . 
  till now it is relative easy to use and works great . 
  just make an image of your ssd . 
  you should get at least 250gb of storage but a 1 tb is at the price of 50 $ wich is really not much . 
  good luck and feel free to ask if there are open questions . 
  jep mine has this too but when you double tap the top left corner at least an red led gets turned on singaling that you disabled the touch pad . 
  i guess the best start would be at / r/overclocking wich will help you out and check their sidebar .

  most of them are considered for a z97x gaming 5 mobo with an i5-4690k but i guess you will see something helpfull and new in there anyway . 
  good luck, 
  well most people dont use them because they think they can always look at their phone or that there will be a clock hanging near by . 
  then on the other hand , i think it by far faster to turn your arm than searching for your phone and in my situation , flapping the cover up just to know the time . 
  in addition to that i am happy to have a watch because while sailing i never have my smartphone with me . 
  sounds like you need some of [ these ] ( http://www.amazon.de/dp/b00x45cmo0/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_ttl?_encoding=utf8&amp;colid=pez34y68gaqc&amp;coliid=irtbas0zp3mnf&amp;psc=1 ) xd, 
  was coming here to ask what those files are for ... now i feel stupid as a bot that cant read out those giveaways ... 
  but isnt it annoying to watch through the ground if the ball is up high ? 
  or is it that rare that it isnt bothering ? 
  for me that looks undcomfortable, 
  entering the giveaway 73495 !, 
  i can actually see 10 vs 10 possible , but their needs to be bigger maps , with 2 goals for each team to protect , one at the floor and one up high and everyone should be able to have more boost or unlimited . 
  that way only half of the players keep sitting at the bottom like a 2 v 2 and the others try to defend the goal up high . 
  that is the same thinking / r/talesfromtechsupport has to hear everyday because someone is thinking using a computer every day makes them know everything about it .
