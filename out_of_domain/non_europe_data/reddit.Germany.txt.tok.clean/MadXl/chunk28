  this is awesome . 
  just thinking about it , i feel kind of sad that just us few ftb-people gon na see it . 
  with this much dedication at least you will get best build 2k16 in no time  congrats to this awesome build . 
  dark souls 3 for the next maddening month i want to suffer to go trough that game . 
  thanks . 
  now i am shaking o.o, 
   hey wallet !, 
  ** you ** stay here !, 
  here is a small update on whats going on :, 
  the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never, 
   `` feel, 
   like all good mechanical keyboards we wanted the ability to change how stomp key felt and behaved . 
  the switch used in all stomp keys are plate mount cherry mx ( the same used in most high quality mechanical keyboards ) which can be removed and replaced with any other plate mount cherry mx switch . 
  in addition to allowing a wide range of switch behaviors , switch travel , and pressure can all be adjusted . '', 
  sadly i dont know which switch is used . 
  now i want that for / r/rocketleague, 
  in my opinion it absolutly is but this post was just meaned to be a `` keyboard spotting '' , not saying to get this as specially for my so considered `` rage key '' you might slam it anyway wich makes a mechanical switch kind of pointless i guess . 
  ~ ~ sorry if this kind of post is not liked on / r/mk i guess i go back to lurking then . ~ ~, 
   i was told each monitor needs windows on it so i can see my desktop on both screens . 
  who are those devils . 
  i must have missed your point : s my bad, 
  not everyone knew they existed , while thinking it makes sense but it was kind of new to me and this is a keyboard spotting not something cool and new post, 
  i never said it is good nor did i wanted to sell you one and, 
  yes thats far to much for something that allready exists, 
  kind of angry but i guess you interpret my post wrong . 
  while they are not exactly the same as the one in the link ( usage whise ) you will be better of buying one of those if you have a good use for it . 
  and these existed for a long time , how would you play a racing game with a wheel but no pedal ? 
  that would make no sense . 
  i remember playing formel 1 16 years ago with a wheel and 2 pedals . 
  a bit late but , bought keycaps from / u/cozmosis, 
  does this count ? 
  bough o-rings from / u/o-rings, 
  i guess because there wasnt yet a promising answer i will try . 
  i have flipped my spacebar as like many others because if you rest your left thumb on space the complete day , the edge of the key is kind of annoying and unpleasent . 
  when you flip the spacebar it looks kind of funky but your thumb can rest easily and comfortably again . 
  in the end it comes to your finger layout and where you rest them and own preference . 
  i really apreciate that ,, 
  but how many ~ ~ fps ~ ~ frames per print can ~ ~ it ~ ~ your printer deliver, 
  for one you might check out / r/mechanicalkeyboards . 
  second , the question 3 before yours ( [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4asm4j/simple_questions_march_17_2016/d1397nu ) ) had quite a good answer . 
  in my opinion , it takes away some of the click but removes the bottom out click wich i like . 
  i recently bought some from / u/o-rings over [ here ] ( http://tigri.bigcartel.com/product/125-epdm-rubber-o-rings-for-cherry-mx-switch-keyboards ), 
  no problem , was very nice and easy way to buy and as far as i could see the cheapest buying option for me . 
  i even send some other o-rings back and even with additional paying for shipment i got enough savings to win . 
  and i wont get hurt by some advertising for a service i liked with fast delivery . 
  when my next mech will arrive i will absolutly buy another bag from you . 
  bought keycaps from / u/elnord, 
  even if it says `` demwintion '' for me it is more a damn-win ( - tion ), 
  my provider did something with me from what i am not sure if thats was wanted or not but i guess it will work too . 
  basically the same person that i called , listened to my problem and said she will forward me , connecting music as she was typing the number in and then came a lovely respnse from my cellphone , that the number i am trying to connect to isnt avaible . 
  end of call . 
  just sad for her that she was my tech the next time i called too . 
  at least she could say she didnt know why that happend . 
  or the more simple way : tell them to restart the router and when you here something remarkebly you hang up . 
  now i am even more confused and my brain wants to tell you : congrats . 
  i am a wierd person . 
  now i want a vr system that actually monitors your eyes and if you close them because you dont want to see what happens , it waits and only kills or scares you when you watch it . 
  i am evil, 
  i feel with you . 
  it is not , it would be if you could have a mirror and the the window on one side and a mirror as well as the window on the other side . 
  it depends on what you ask it to be ( kind of ) . 
  because it is a quantum mechanic , there is no real world aplication to make it easy to understand . 
  thats why most people dont get how it works . 
  imagine a box in where you could put in 2 different things . 
  you can not look into the box but you can take things out of the box . 
  there are 2 different shapes in there at the same time but if you messure it ( taking something out ) you only get one result . 
  and now to add to this allready complex situation what makes quantum computing that fast , is that 2 `` boxes '' are linked to each other . 
  they react at the same time with the same result . 
  so if you get a red ball at one end , the other box has a red ball as the result too . 
  that way you can transmit data over `` big '' length without any time loss . 
  my mistake i guess . 
  i should have mentioned that the mirror and window can only be one at a time . 
  like the fridge / furnace example . 
  the state of the `` object '' is always just one . 
  ignoring the way you approach it . 
  the example with the fridge makes it easier to understand while keeping out the real problem which makes quantum superposition that complicated . 
  a good way to start would be to understand the double-slit experiment which is often choosen to explain quantum mechanics . 
  the short version of it is that because photons are a particle and light is a wave , it is both at the same time . 
  if you dont messure it it can be at both spots at the same moment but if you look at it it can only be at one spot . 
  taking this knowledge and applying it to the qbit , it is a 1 and 0 at the same time while you let it be but if you try to messure it it will only be one of them . 
  with the mirror/window example , there is an object that you can feel it is there but if you open your eyes it will only be the one or the other , never both at once . 
  even if you hold it in you hands to be sure nobody changes it out with something else , while briefly closing your eyes and opening them again , the object might be in another state . 
  i hope this clears up a bit now and did not confuse you even more . 
  most infomative 56 seconds i had the last years . 
  thats what i will tell them from now on . 
  at least if they take the time speaking with me . 
  ... go on ... 
  you should have seen my girlfriend when she asked how much i spent on my 60 % mech with custom keycaps and artisans . 
  they will never get it why it is more expensive then buying a full sized normal keyboard . 
  you forgot one thing !, 
  ** steam **, 
  now look back to how much you spend . 
  actually , with the more trys you do and the more fails you come up with , if the starting opinion is `` then what makes it fun ? '', 
  it gets only worse and even if there would be a game that could be cool he will never experience it in that way because he is allready down . 
  i tryed searching for a game my girlfriend might enjoy . 
  it really went this way but with some more complications . 
  the right move would be to start rethinking what he said . 
  start with a game with fancy graphics , local multiplayer that you can play with them but against other people online ( if there will be still server ) and show them why those games are awesome and you spend over 100 hours on them . 
  most introductions are not that interesting if you dont know why you should play it what the outcome will be . 
  till the tl : dr i thought he meant that he got ill from bringing the laptop to the campus which made it much more weird .
