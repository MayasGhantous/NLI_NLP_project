  still most parents would unground you , let you fix it and then ground you again . 
  even with that many people entering , i am curious if even one of those question might get answered . 
  very interesting way for a giveaway . 
  as a german it took me way to long to understand that `` ramp '' in this post isnt a city but the description of the part of the street . 
  or he wanted to say wifi signal strenght but used bars instead . 
  if you look sideways at the wifi signal it kind of looks like bars . 
  was thinking of a keyboard not completly connected , still amused of this story . 
  you mean the world of world of warcraft, 
  exactly the kb i will buy as soon as my purse has recovered . 
  cant wait to get mine . 
  use a / s the next time . 
  more common way to express sarcasm and such on reddit . 
   cat7 : for when you have to much money to just buy the best cable but still use a rj45 port so you only get cat6a speed . 
  ftfy, 
  to get this right , he asked his dad to buy the same model , installed linux on his machine and then took both a part and changed the ssd or hdd out with each other . 
  basically having still the school property but with admin rights and linux or was he not that smart ? 
  that is something to figure out next time , 
  even if your monitor can utilize hdmi 2.0 remember that your gpu needs to be able to send with 2.0 too . 
  ~ ~ if i remember correctly , my gtx 970 is only hdmi 1.4 ~ ~, 
  as for your second question , i would recommend one good monitor to game on and one standard monitor as an internet browsing , music changer or anything besides your normal gaming . 
  what to take ? 
  maybe take an [ 144 hz , 1440p , 27 '' ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-monitor-90lm00u0b01370 ) for gaming and a [ normal one ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/acer-monitor-umfg6aaa01 ) for web and stuff . 
  these both would cost 780 $ together . 
  but that is just my choice after looking at pcpartpicker . 
  there might be better deals at your place . 
  for gaming you should get 1ms and maybe if you like it a 144hz with 1440p or a 60hz with 3840x2160 . 
  mostly preference what you like more ( higher hz or higher resolution ) and what deals you might be able to get . 
  just remember that your gpu needs to be able to render those settings as well as have the right connections ( hdmi , dvi , displayport ) . 
  well then my brain was thinking something else . 
  thanks for correcting, 
  billions ? 
  we have around 7 ' 324 ' 116 ' 853 people living on this world . 
  from them , according to [ this site ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/world/age_structure.html ) we can dismiss around 25 % beeing underage and not our problem ( yet ) . 
  7 ' 324 ' 116 ' 853 * 0,75 = ~ 5.493.087.639 or lets say 5.500 000 000, 
  then we can dismiss [ us ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport ) 309.983 people , 80.763 people from / r/techsupport and some more . 
  or rounded with some lurkers that dont subscribe to a subreddit to 500.000 . 
  so we got 5 499\u00a0500\u00a0000 . 
  lets try another thing . 
  while we got 5 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 people able to use electronics , there could be [ around 20 % of them ] ( https://www.quora.com/how-many-people-work-in-the-tech-industry-worldwide ) working in a techbased job . 
  while we all know , that only a 10th of them might be able to do basic troubleshooting , we might at least be able to subtract those . 
  well that is not really helpfull . 
  but i thought i might do some random thinking combined with math . 
  if anyone got anything to add to this i will be happy to fill that in . 
  thats why i use the same 5 words for every security questions . 
  it kind of fails the way they are supposed to work but on the other hand , you will never find those answers by social engeneering . 
  only problem is to remember those 5 additional passwords . 
  video got online at the 16.04.2013 . 
  watching a 22 minute video over 4 million times takes 88\u00a0000\u00a0000 minutes or 1 466 666 hours or 61 111 days . 
  that would be the 18.12.2014 wich is possible but i still doubt it . 
   because you ca n't build a car and then drive around in it !, 
  or a spaceship . 
  mods ? 
  hey thats me !, 
  finally my tai hao orange arrived . 
  sorry for some bad quality pictures but i was literally shaking as this is my first mech and i am so happy . 
  till i can get a tkl for my desktop , she will stay at home but later she will get my daily driver at work . 
  * note to self : dont forget to buy an orange cable *, 
  thanks to / u/elnord i could finish the set in iso even if i bought it in ansi . 
  the left artisan is from mechanicalkeyboards.com ( armor cap v2 ) and the both on the right i got from / u/cozmosis ( great work ) and i got o-rings from / u/o-rings . 
  can recommend all of them . 
  one month later all tubes have a mark on them \u00ac _ \u00ac, 
  but the pok3r has media controls , fn with ijkl as arrow keys and on the bottom right too . 
  well i guess i like the pok3r more but if you are happy that is great . 
  * ^ hope ^ this ^ doesnt ^ sound ^ like ^ blaming *, 
  til, 
  thanks \\ ^ \u032e ^, 
   why do you make keycaps ?!, 
  ** because they are awesome and a complete community loves them !, 
  while i definitely like the both versions answered on your comment , i just wanted to tell you , that there is actually the option to buy the inlet and case of the pyra for only 20 $ . 
  that way you might be able to use a rpi but still have an premade case thats looks sharp and clean . 
  edit : [ link ] ( https://www.dragonbox.de/en/234-replacement-case-platinum-replacement-parts.html ) to [ both ] ( https://www.dragonbox.de/en/235-case-set-inside-replacement-parts.html ), 
  the 250 $ spend on a keyboard that doesnt have a numpad nor arrowkeys . 
  with artisans , spending money on other colored keycaps and profile and them asking if it has at least backlighting wich i have decline . 
  basically everything but i am happy with my board and this community . 
  actually having the switch still stuck on the key while punching it into the lions eye would be more helpfull than the key itself . 
  i guess , thanks a lot \u25d5 \u203f \u25d5, 
  ^ * ( mobile , ^ dont ^ click ^ this !, 
  no problem , everyone to there own liking . 
  on one hand i can perfectly understand that one artisan on the esc-key is looking great and is adding to the look of a keyboard . 
  the problem is that i like all 3 of these artisans and because i messed up , i dont have the iso 0 and \u00b4 key . 
  basically i could use the ansi ones but then there would be 2 ] in the upper row and a weird one next to it . 
  i just thought , taking my artisans for that fits better . 
  as you can see in the before picture , i have some more but they dont feel that nice wich is why i left them out . 
  in the future i will probably take the artisans over to my shine when i get one . 
  thanks for you opinion though , really apreciate the open minded/speaking community as this is my first real communication with this sub after lurking for over half a year . 
  fun fact : i understood that you left the spaces out to make it look like it got spoken really fast . 
  my reaction : reading only, 
  ~ ~ heyguyswha ~ ~ t ~ ~ ` suphere ~ ~ is ~ ~ v ~ ~ i ~ ~ olettandtodaywe ` relookingatguy ~ ~ s ~ ~ and ~ ~ ~ ~ howwillingtheya ~ ~ re ~ ~ tohelpout ~ ~ a ~ ~ gir ~ ~ l ~ ~ whogetsanno ~ ~ y ~ ~ edbya ~ ~ creepy ~ ~ guy ~ ~, 
  probably will do that . 
  fits perfectly . 
  faceless void looks more like meta knight for me but that might be because i dont know anything about dota except is the same principal as lol wich i can play . 
  good on you , i got into computers because mine broke twice and i had to pay for reparing the first time . 
  the second time i didnt want to waste my money for something i might be able to do too . 
  now i am working in it . 
  great reactions ,, 
  great coworkers ,, 
  nice boss ,, 
  well written . 
  +1 for you, 
  never seen this one referenced .
