  definitely would give you a cookie for that !, 
  or just dont let them spawn in the end . 
  we had to do this because was literally no enderman in the end !, 
  none . 
  just add the dimension to the config and all gone , 
  never ever have a nuke in your hotbar if you have build with redstone blocks in your base ... never ever again !, 
  you only know riot doesnt like you if you play a ranked ( promotion game )  disconnect  client close  reconnect  doesnt work  kill client in taskmanager  open up again  patching !!!!!!!!!, 
   20 min later  come in game  loading screen  connect  defeat  and getting reported, 
  i didnt play 1 month after that . 
  never thought that this is even possible, 
  read [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/34qusf/when_5_second_disconnects_turn_into_5_minutes_of/ ) and rethink your point . 
  even tho i can understand that 5 min can be enough to reconnect on the otherhand it can be enough to have lost the game allready . 
  a saver should be there directly in my opinion . 
  still a designer cant programm ... 
  [ bronze 2 ] ( http://oce.op.gg/summoner/username=chhopsky ) if his username is the same as in reddit . 
  - the internet is full of stuff just search yourself next time . 
  oh and i got bored so yes it is his [ summoner ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/33zir9/spoiler_calculated_jinx_ult_tdk_vs_wfx/cqq7v8k?context=3 ), 
  championsuggest : euw neonize, 
  but the sentence is may the force be with you = may first then 4 =  54 %, 
  no problem ... after i wrote my comment i saw that like 20 people wrote the same further down so i feelt i might even delete it , 
  its not because of the enemy frontline but because of the fact that he cant kill the adc because of the lack of isolation damage . 
  if he would go in he would probably just die . 
  i hope you can understand what i am trying to tell , 
  well he allready gets his passive proc after stealth iirc, 
  i know it applies to everything but the problem is i dont want to live from eating only chicken wings the rest of my life so if you dont love one then it is okay to play both i would say . 
  why do you use 2 channel ? 
  i even jsut use one for one interface that gives all the needed items in a chest -  inscriber -  back to chest and interface gets them back . 
  well you can always [ check ] ( http://wastedonlol.com/ ) your playtime, 
  i never thought i would find it here but yeah i live in hamburg i can tell 1 day is not enough to see everything in there . 
  it may be small but the amount of work and detail that got put in their is amazing . 
  if you get the chance to watch it - do it !, 
  i think you can use mutandis extremis from witchery to change dirt under water to clay but i guess that is a hell of a grind and manually work ... 
  and for optimisation : place a comparator next to the mana pool and a wireless sender on the same frequenz to stop the output of coal / charcoal if the mana pool is full . 
  then do it s/he speacially wrote f 7 f y so you can ftfy him/her, 
  0.015 per kwh ... what !, 
  where do you live ?!!!, 
  i pay 26 cent per kwh !!, 
  well i do too ... because i smell like weed, 
  stupid people !, 
  i have no problem with non smart people but people believing shit and loving to do the stupiest things and telling me its healthy and great while everyfuckingothergooleentryshowsitisnot, 
  i s j u s t k i l l i n g m e !, 
  portalmod installed ? 
  - the cake is a lie :d, 
  pretty rare you say ? 
  well than i had to have been very lucky with a world where every 100 blocks a new volcano started to evolve ... 
  i had to build a new dimension . 
  ah okay than i feel lucky beeing that my first dimension build with volcanos :p, 
  well ... yes i didnt think of that ... 
  my bad i guess . 
  but mostly i was still thinking about [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/18b8r1/end_of_an_era/c8dh6gc ) why i added technic to the search terms, 
  in an other post someone said ( sorry cant remember post nor the person ) you need like 16 36hp boiler for one max turbine ( if i remember correctly ) . 
  it might be possible with mfr planter/harvester but i think big reactor is much easier and smaller and with 1 mfr laser you have it nearly self sustaining . 
  amulett ( haste ) , ring of magnetization , angel ring and arrow belt just for fun :p belts are kinda useless i think . 
  oh and while you ask : knapsack and 20 heart containers as everyone else + glove with full haste, 
  sounds nice even though you didnt share that much in depth but lore is always nice , 
  i am definitly looking into it and in my opinion i find it completly fine if you think you dont want the config wall . 
  i mean ae2 was not easy to understand but now i like it and that is just because their wasnt a config option to disable channels . 
  i would like to see what has changed and then on the other hand it would be a better choice to enable the config wall for modpacks to adapt more to the feel of the modpack itself ( maybe ) . 
  but this is just my opinion and maybe other hate that they must adapt to changes . 
  i dont . 
  everything changes . 
  as long it is interesting and functions in a right way in the mod itself i would always prefer something new if the modcreator thinks it is the next step . 
  for me that is completely fine and i think that it will fire up the expectations wich is nice , 
  what about ... love !, 
  i would say it is kinda bad expressed or viewed from the wrong perspective . 
  and now we can calculate how much marihuana and cocaine we need to intake together to stay at a normal time rate xd, 
  have you ever tried or seen ants eating backing powder ? 
  first its like nothing and then its a small firework xd, 
  i am a bad person . 
  thank you sir , you sent me on an epic trip through the internet seaching if that is possible and purchasable ( for me ) . 
  and if someone is interested : ** yes it is possible **, 
  [ take a look at this ] ( http://ionlystartedthistopostsomedice.tumblr.com/post/49477249580/heres-some-dice-a-fluorite-octet-made-out-of ), 
  at least the [ webdocumentation ] ( http://www.tolkiencraft.com/draconic-evolution/energy-core-multi-block/ ) is right i guess . 
  because for me i like to switch ages but when i do they are all empty and i have to load them up completly : maybe a super conducter - filling a dimension in no time at all but needs a long time to get charged with rf and may loose some if not powered all the time ( infusing might help ) or even make it so it can only be filled with a endergenic generator , 
  try adding rice then, 
  am i the only one who had read :, 
  `` this is 96 % upsetting me ... '' ? 
  after making different dimensions and switching i now made the op-world for all my needs . 
  draconium ore flat world with mushroom island biome , uranium and yellorium oregen , shiny tendrils , gold / emerald / ardite block orbs , blazing pyrotheum lakes , some liquid orbs that i forgot what i put in and normal weather , time and so on, 
  basically with 5 efficiency dimlets a price of 20 rf/t iirc is ... ok, 
  so where is the problem directly ? 
  can you see the items in that subnetwork ? 
  do you see them all ? 
  none ? 
  have you a storage device in the subnetwork ? 
  we need more information or even better pictures to understand where the problem is . 
  have you got some power in the subnetwork either over quarzcable or in addition ? 
  dont know what to say , send a pm but still want to get more attention on this thread so :, 
  ** bump **, 
  i know but didnt know what else to do then upvote and comment . 
  and if i comment i can even try to bring some people to bump with me and upvote for clarity, 
  [ you may apply here if you want ] ( http://www.resonant-rise.com/topic/6218-craftorlyno-resonant-rise-3-new-mainline-and-some-whitelist-brand-new-fresh-map-6115/ ), 
  from the real pre-post-post ( or something like that ), 
  the water is turning in specific ways depending on the hemisphere , even if that isnt always translating to the toilet . 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.smartereveryday.com/toiletswirl ), 
  even if you watch they video like me it is quite interesting to see them drifting in a straight line from right to left across the screen . 
   bitches love cyanide and happiness . 
  ftfy, 
  that sudden change of direction from gaming to filming ... like it, 
  i am not sure about the endstone comment but it is definitely the fact that you used awakend draconium blocks and not charged draconium blocks .
