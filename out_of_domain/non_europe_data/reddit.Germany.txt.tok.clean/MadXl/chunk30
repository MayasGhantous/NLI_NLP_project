  nice one though . 
  can definitely relate to it . 
  i have only played 2 and now playing 3 but i didnt really care on the story before . 
  because i wanted to know it though , before i started playing 3 i took a look at a mark up / plot description and as far as i can tell , you are able to play the complete game without the need of any plot information , as they are difuse and not really defined . 
  btw : 3 is much easier than 2 and i heared 1 is even harder . 
  the hype is kind of because of the difficulty but also about how the game is made up . 
  it really punishes you if you make a mistake or start running around without looking first . 
  on the other hand if you play it yourself and you are able to beat a boss that you died to over 5 times , you feel completly relieved . 
  well at least until you get to the next enemy that suddenly kills you . 
  even with leveling up all the time , if you dont pay attention , the easiest enemys are still able to kill you without a problem . 
  while all newer games get easier all the time with more checkpoints , many people appreciate a game that makes it harder again , giving you more playtime because you need more , not because the game is bigger or the story is longer . 
  plot wise , it is really vague what to think about . 
  for one , they only tell the basics directly , of what you need . 
  in example , you need to get the soul from -- to gain -- . 
  on the other hand with all the items , from which many are hidden , the game is able to give you much more information . 
  if you are really interested , i found [ this ] ( http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1184624 ) great mark up of the story . 
  in addition to this i must say the artwork and level design is kind of unique and even if you think you know the drill of the game it is still able to surprise you again and again . 
  as i said some post above this , yes it is absolutly possible . 
  i only have played 2 before but didnt care on the story as i played it . 
  you are perfectly fine playing the game without knowing the story of the other games , as the game is giving you all the information to understand what you need to do and why . 
  on the other hand , if you got some time , [ here ] ( http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1184624 ) is a great summary i found and have read myself too . 
  it gives you enough inside to understand that dark souls isnt as easy to understand plotwise , as it isnt as easy to play . 
  edit : in addition to that , ds3 seems to be easier ( at least in the begining ) than 2 so that it is a great introduction to the souls games . 
  i can really recommend to play 3 even if you might not have played 2 . 
  from the artwork and game design it is definitely worth it and even if you die a lot , just think about what you did wrong and adept to it . 
  dark souls helps you understand that mistake might be made but to progress you should find a way to either work around them or simply stop doing them in the future . 
  spoiler : you can kill that hollow before he transformed and you can just progress without fighting him ( in that huge form ) . 
  whoa there ... carefull with that . 
  then good luck and dont forget to upgrade you flask when you get a shard for it . ^ ^ ^ ^ youwillundestanditwhenthetimecomes, 
  no problem . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1184624 ) is the summary i have read to catch up with the plot for 3 . 
  as a beginner i can still not parry those stupid hollows :(, 
  haahahaha , that is even better than us , learning to safe everything you did every 2 minutes because our it-room had a big red power off switch for every pc in the room , that got pressed nearly everytime someone thought it would be good to accidently hit it while going on the toilet or getting something to eat . 
  if i would have the money , i would have given you gold for this . 
  sadly i can just upvote you and wish you a nice weekend , as you made my day . 
  me too , that would be the right dark souls experience . 
  if i am not mistaken it flys away before you kill it but it drops a titanite shard . 
   assuming they 're business related meetings, 
  my first guess was that she missed a meeting getting more xanax : s, 
  enable wakeonlan on every station , let your users shutdown normally and then install updates via script overnight with powercycling the computers . 
  because you dont update everyday you are able to save power . 
  you are even able to update them in batches , that if there is a mistake or problem , not all users affected . 
  that seems phine to me . 
  an image is a complete system packed into one file . 
  everything you have on your pc ( at least on the part from which you made the image ) . 
  windows , settings , programms and files . 
  an backup is most of the time just a save of your files and maybe configurations . 
  if you want to recover from a bad disk , you take an image because after you have restored it you can work again and everything will be running . 
  if you are caring for your files , that they might corrupt or get lost then a backup is the better choice as it will be smaller and faster . 
  remember that you wont have a licenced windows if your pc breaks with an backup , just your files that you can then import into another system . 
  on the other hand you arent able to pick some missing files out of an image . 
  i hope this helps , if there is anything you still want to know feel free to ask . 
  manglement : `` but it is allready running as i can see so we dont need to spend money now . 
  actually there is no budget anyway . 
  case closed '', 
  sadly this is a perfect example for an ad from marketing which know nothing about the parts they sell . 
  and i always thought that would be the cpu , til ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i know that i killed my sd card because i pulled the power off the rpi . 
  sadly all the superblocks got corrupted so i need to set it up completly new . 
  i guess in your situation , the pi wasnt completly powered down the time you pulled the power cable . 
  the hdmi cable shouldnt make a difference though . 
  while i understand that a start up from an usb-stick might bbe easier , could you just make a small partition on the hdd/ssd and put freenas on there ? 
  that would circumvent the problem with the usb-stick and still wouldnt you cost `` any '' disk space . 
  or am i missing out on something there ? 
  ah okay , thanks for the insights, 
  [ that the boost is n't in the same spot on both sides ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketleague/comments/4gjxxo/hoops_unplayable/d2j0cll ), 
  surprisingly i remember them far to early and basically getting these is my go to step by step advancement for what i need to build . 
  on the sad part , i read that as backups first and that are those , wich i always forget until it is to late . 
  i am sorry but for me , that just lost it . 
  you are now `` dr. boner alias that imgur guy '', 
  well i said sorry , not because i felt bad but because i wanted to tag you as dr. boner but then you wanted to be that imgur guy . 
  no problem at all . 
  yes it is redditenhancementsuite and you are now * dr. boner alias that imgur guy that wants to be tagged as the `` whatever man '' men *, 
  just for your knowledge , i got tagged as `` confusing dude who messed up tagging another dude mighty dude who tagged dude who tagged dude dank cool '' some time back . 
  edit : [ here is the link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3fy4jm/not_to_beat_a_dead_horse_but_a_sandbox_mode_would/cttgzc7 ), 
  thats because they dont spend thousends of money in a `` gaming pc '' ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  that is because those are 2 different thoughts . 
  still i am on your side while i know that there can only be rich people by having someone else be poor . 
  ** you drowned a fish ? 
  besides all the good things that have been said , i just wanted to say shortly that you might consider a citchen sink pack so they can experience and find what they like while on the other hand , you yourself could or maybe even should challenge yourself in just picking some specific mods or leave out some well known features . 
  i had the same situation some time back and sadly i just played normal with my buds in a pack i allready played alone . 
  that way i had nothing new and lost interest pretty quick . 
  on a side node the best times were when i could help them setting things up for them or showing them stuff that might be helpfull for them . 
  good luck finiding a pack that fits all 3 of you . 
  i never said or meand to say that the situation as it is know is right or good in anyway . 
  i am amazed by how often i click on that damn link . 
  gets me everytime just because res isnt purpling out youtube links . 
  the right answer would have been :, 
   `` can you please fix problems before they arise . '', 
   `` we do that all the time , but sometimes a small one gets through . 
  technically you should pay us more . '', 
  everytime i get amazed by tales like this where every normally thinking brain should see the answer and still those people are able to cross the street . 
  but what if you want to retire . 
  is that than counting into the `` whatever i want '' part or towards retireing from the `` whatever i want to do '' job ? 
   ^ ( not sure exactly what you are referencing to but , 
  thankfully my health is pretty good , thanks to beeing just a young trainee in it but in the future those people will probably kill me . 
  right now i would just turn around , shake my head and hope for better days . 
  well you still can fuck them over with an shitty i7 compared to a high end i5,
