  edit : reading is hard but i saw , he isnt hearing on his pcmr-brother . 
  now i am sad that there are people wasting 400 $ ( $ ) ( cad ) ( usd ) ( whatever ) just because they dont listen to people that inform themselves . 
  i know it . 
  i see it . 
  i feel it . 
  i will lose to it . 
  but not yet . 
   jesus dude ... what did this kid do to you to deserve a ** ~ ~ shit ~ ~ ** human shit filled condom being thrown at him ? 
  ftfy, 
  referencing to the mentioned stroke by / u/acemcbean, 
  well ... okay . 
  i hope it is fixed now to your liking, 
  nevermind , found the problem . 
  fixed it to tales . 
  never had that many spelling mistakes in one day . 
  are there any left ? 
  enough for today i guess . 
  well yes , they works great but if you are referencing on the one person that said something before you and you want to be friendly you need to address she and he as there is no great single person pronoun . 
  i , for one , write s/he as that is short and is referencing to both genders . 
  may i ask why you have so much splitted storage ? 
  i understand an ssd for programs and a 8 x 3tb raid setup but the left overs ? 
  are they for additional backup if the raid breaks ? 
  wasnt 1 ssd enough and you kept on buying additional ones ? 
  thanks in advance . 
  very nice build . 
  so wow . 
  much money . 
  awesome . 
  originall idea to get an answer , problem is you can not repeat the steps once you need to input your answer again because all those steps were random . 
  [ happy hardcore you say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtktpkp3quk ), 
  problem :, 
  what is your favourite colour ? 
  - wiyfc, 
  what is your favourite child ? 
  hunter2 ? 
  at first i thought `` router bridging '' ? 
  ouh that is going to be an interesting nightmare . 
  in the end it was a joy to read a positive story from time to time again , that shows that not everyone of us suffers that much everyday . 
  stay kind to all that respect you and keep on with the good work and stay away of those that we all dont want . 
  just keep in mind , that specially if your isp is collecting those metrics that beeing a nice person could backfire . 
  i just hope that that wont happen to you . 
  only 7/7 - wont do since not 8/8, 
  because that would only work if you have a wireless keyboard . 
  otherwise you would need to rip out a piece where the cable is shown and slam that into the ethernet port ( probably the biggest you can find ) . 
  i guess the normal procedure would be :, 
  step 1 - help her out, 
  step 2 - turn around with a big grin, 
  step 3 - get to your co-worker as fast as you can and then laugh with them after you told what you just witnessed, 
  why ? 
  because we all work in hell and every happy part needs to be shared to those that may not be that lucky that day . 
  at least that is the way we survive where i work . 
  dont feel bad , i thought the same but simply because i didnt even know what the insert key could do and by now i couldnt replicate what is stated in this thread . 
  dont know why . 
  i always thought i would be an easier strg+v, 
  not sure about that ... star wars needed 6 tries to count right and to 3 ... 
  not sure what adventure you mean if you ** only ** find testicles between your legs suddenly, 
  well yes , but most of my laughs are just one liner because of some silly user not worthy to post here but still funny enough to tell my co-worker . 
  other than that you are absolutly right . 
  better ? 
  good luck everyone and thanks for the giveaway op , when will you decide who won something ? 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/v6xzfpq ) was my 3x3 hardest pattern a long time as you need to cross between 2 other dots . 
  now i have a 15 digit number code - . -, 
  at first i thought :, 
  `` oh username checks out '', 
  then i saw that it actually was you , who told the story . 
  i am impressed . 
  it seems like there is a spinning `` web '' - thingy with the right form on a turn table and then many lights pointed at it from below . 
  that way only a small part gets light , but because the whole thing is turning it looks like the light is dancing . 
  not op but you can use [ big picture mode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efrl6-ohn94 ) ( think the button is in the top right corner ) , which gives you another interface that you can actually use with a controller . 
  that took me sadly far to long ... 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ * know, 
  because it was not colorfull enough and most of those people dont even look . 
  i heard of a story where and hdmi cable got stuck in an usb port and the other way around too . 
  or a usb plugged in the ethernetport . 
  the just press und push and turn until it stops falling out . 
  while i totally understand your problem , i am not happy either to with my code which would look like :, 
   n1 -  f1 ( v1.p1 , v2.p2 ) ;, 
  while then again later i need to explain to everybody which part is doing what why all my code looks in the finished state like this :, 
   n1 -  f1 ( v1.p1 , v2.p2 ) ; / / n1 = name1 , f1 = function , v1 = variable referencing on p1 which is parameter ... while v2 is referencing to the power of the dog fighting wiht p2 which is not anymore a parameter but now person2 as i had to change something at line 43, 
   / / additional notes , line 43 got rewritten why p2 is now the number of fists the variable user 2 has . 
  see line 55 coment 3b, 
  why that ? 
  v and w sounds the same in english but not nearly in german . 
  how should that work . 
  its more like a [ fau-lan ] vs. [ weh-lan ] in german while [ ve ] vs [ wi ] in english . 
  then i think we might got a problem here because i work in it in germany and i never heard anybody use the english pronounciation for vlan . 
  maybe the swiss / german part is mixing that up but then again i wouldnt have thought about an other country speaking german in the first place . 
   recalbox   retropie, 
  do you mean recalbox is better or recalbox will get your money or how should i understand that and what is you reasoning behind picking recalbox and not retropie if i may ask . 
  ~ ~ if i may ask , what was the main factor for you considering osmc over kodi ? ~ ~ i should do my research before asking ... 
  just ignore this comment . 
  i dont think any english speaking person is saying w ( ho ) lan but that might be just me . 
  on the other hand i completly understand you reasoning and i dont have enough people speaking english around me to get an example of different w/wh/who 's . 
  my thinking was based on wlan is wireless lan making it wi-lan on some sort . 
  [ basically this ] ( https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/10209746/cultural-question-how-say-wlan ) but pronounciation is different everywhere so i will stop arguing on point of this topic even if this is the internet, 
  thank you for your opinion . 
  i use my raspi for other things as well so i had the distro pretty set from the start . 
  thanks a lot, 
  i get that from time to time at different gyms while on others i can battle normally and take over the gym .
