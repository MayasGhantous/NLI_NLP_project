  it is quite frustrating when you travel a complete street by feet just to realize that you cant get the gym . 
  so far i can only close the app to get back out . 
  havent tried cleaning the cache or anything that might help . 
  next time i will try to disable internet or gps shortly , maybe that will reset it . 
  will report back . 
  stardust is the same for every pokemon you own , while the candys are bound to the same pokemon / evolution . 
  like say a charmander candy can still be used on an charmeleon because it is in the same evolution ladder but it cant be used on a bulbasaur . 
  assign a pokemon to a gym , go into your menu -  shop -  top right shield icon . 
  click it and get a reward for all the gyms you own at that time . 
  it has a time limitation so use wisely, 
  thats weird , normally you should get them without a time difference . 
  do you have a stable gps / internet connection ? 
  i only had this once when it didnt load right , but then again i got a error message . 
  it is quite hard to see that you get them because it is showing in the top right corner right below the message . 
  and as far as i can tell it is always just one . 
  there is a google map but it isnt nearly as complete as it could be . 
  you may contribute . 
  that way you can help others in your situation .

  adding to what / u/raweggroll said , you need to collect the bonus yourself in the shop screen by clicking on the shield in the top right . 
  i thought it would be gnome anns key ? 
  depends on which phone you are referencing to . 
  but yes for the one at least i was happy until i changed to a custom rom for faster updates . 
  [ good enough ? 
  because i hate that myself , i trained to throw only curve balls . 
  because you are able to spin the pokeball in a direction you want by holding and circling you never get a random throw . 
  it might be harder at the start but the minimum of 10 ep for the curve ball and no random trow really helps . 
  and that was only my paint skills because i dont have access to photoshop where i am at right now :p, 
  i am happy that i could help . 
  did you level it up even more or did you found it with that cp . 
  pretty high considering you caught it with level 10 . 
  are you sure ? 
  didnt you get a candy for evolving ? 
  while your thinking might be right on one hand , by not having enough servers the hype is dieing on its own . 
  basically you loose people because the game isnt as good as they thought it would be or because they are unable to play . 
  that means less player = less micro transactions = less money . 
  so by trying to safe some money you loose money . 
  well the key to pokemon is still what type is good against which . 
  keep this in mind and 6 200 -300 cp pokemon can easily win against a 900 cp one . 
  i have only 600 cp ones and have to fight against 1100 cp 's in my area but still i am able to win . 
  just try to dodge mostly and i for myself dont use the power attacks because then you are standing for to long . 
  i would die most of the time . 
  wish you good luck . 
  if i am not mistaken , the cp level of the hatching egg is determind by the level when you got your egg , not the level you are while hatching . 
  that way you have to firstly clear all your `` low '' level eggs out before you can utilize higher level ones . 
  i am not sure if the eggs are sorted by date gotten . 
  then you could only hatch the one furthest down . 
  while i understand you point , which is right , there is no need to say that because everybody understands that this is meant as satire or a caricature . 
  even if not , every person can choose themselfs which team to pick . 
  that way even if you would be disabled you could just pick red or blue . 
  [ this ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dalaqnxtk96grpj23epuiz_dkqc8wnupa_ujfkjwxxo/edit?usp=sharing ) good enough ? 
  had to change some colors . 
  what / u/elitepoogie said is right , but you cant heal mid fight . 
  only after the fight . 
  while fighting you can :, 
  * use a normal attack by tapping on the enemy, 
  * use a special attack by holding ( if at least 1 blue bar is full ), 
  * dodge by swiping left or right ( to dodge perfectly wait untill the screen flashes yellow , then swipe left or right ), 
  * escaping, 
  * changing your pok\u00e9mon ( not worth it because you get damage while choosing the new one ), 
  better ? 
  edit : even sorted by a-z from left to right and top down, 
  hey , would you mind letting me know if you find a way to get the .2 update from somewhere ? 
  i heard the same but reinstalling only brought be 0.29.0 again . 
  it is also the highest version that is shown for me in the app store . 
  i just wanted to let you know that the playstore has updated pogo for me , i could download the update to 0.29.2 . 
  damage wise i would say that any special attack is good when you attack like an ai . 
  if you can tap your screen faster than just every second i would say normal attacking is more damage . 
  with the bars , it depends on the animationlength . 
  if you use one bar that is short but still has the same animationlength as an full bar attack , and the short one deals less damage , i would say the long bar hits harder . 
  but then again i never thought about that all because i mainly use normal attacks and a dodge from time to time . 
  [ that could also help you out ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4sc7ns/the_secret_to_gym_battles_pretty_much_every_guide/ ), 
   boss, 
   he needs to be fired immediately, 
  i dont think that that will work out . 
  `` the more you get to know , the worth it gets . '', 
  while ~ ~ every ~ ~ nearly every company looks decent from the outside , most of them have big tech problems on the inside . 
  i am not sure about that . 
  even while writing he forgot that desktop should be something else than using your head on the desk top . 
  i would change your tl ; dr to :, 
   tl ; dr : buy a luxury 2 seats car , they 're the best for traveling long distances between cities ** with the complete family **, 
  while i can understand your thinking , there is an other part to why so many have a wd hdd or samsung ssd or asus board . 
  because they are just good . 
  if not even the best in some regards . 
  on the other hand they are not super expensiv like apple products . 
  yes apple does a great job but still you pay 200 -500 more just because you want an half eaten apple on it . 
  not even a new one . 
  show me where a q7 has no comfort ? 
  still you can drive with 4 + people all happy , chilled , fast and enough space for everyone while a luxury 2 seats car is , at least for me ( around 2 m in height ) not as comfortable . 
  i dont think you know enough about proxys and how the isp determine what service you are using . 
  i mostly use [ this ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dalaqnxtk96grpj23epuiz_dkqc8wnupa_ujfkjwxxo/edit?usp=sharing ) after i made it for another post .
