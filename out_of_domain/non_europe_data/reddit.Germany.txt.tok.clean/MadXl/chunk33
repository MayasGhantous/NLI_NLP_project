  percantage that have an credit card ~ 70 % . 
  324 * 0,7 = 226,8 million americans older than 18, 
  226,8 * 0,7 = 158,76 million americans with credit cards, 
  even if this isnt equally distributed , it is enough for this purpose to say , that around 1/7th of people living on this planet have an android device or around 14 %, 
  158,76 * 0,14 = 22,2264 million android americans with credit cards . 
  now with this information we know that around 2,22264 % ( 100 / 1.000.000.000 * 22.226.400 ) of all android users not only live in the usa but also are in cahrge of an credit card . 
  i am sorry to say that but your answer is not quite fitting . 
  problem is that i tagged / u/batquux as mrs. buttface now too ... 
  are they at least at happy families now ? 
  * you cant just make a sad story even worth and than dont give me a okay feeling thinking about a story someone wrote on the internet . 
  if you dont know how to tech ( how to use your email over your phone ) or your phone is to old , the mms option is faster than copying the file over to your dead pc ... wait a second , that might be why . 
  i dont know why , but while reading the title i directly thought about an mouse over text of some other field that blocks the vision to the safe button . 
  but then again , this sounds quite misterious . 
  nice story to explain the singel point of failure . 
  i hope the luser will understand it one day . 
  i dont think i can drink enough coffee per day to be this relaxed .

  for the blueray player , anything special i have to keep in mind ? 
  thanks for reminding me that, 
  ** trading, 
  teamplay, 
  tracking, 
  special events **, 
  all were shown in the trailer and now we sit here with 300 pidgey candys . 
  now i want to know the real name of your $ doorbell, 
  i have the feeling , everyone else playing epic story lines , while i sit here and have the complete story line written in a book in front of me and still have problems coming up with enough content and action besides the normal story because my players go everywhere but not where they should . 
  note : i dm a pathfinder rise of the runelords but have problems with all the content , maps , dialogs , background of people , history , small additions , anything . 
  maybe i should stop playing once per week . 
  i needed 9 parent comments to realize with your comment , that this isnt / r/pokemongo . 
  thank you , downvoted this post . 
  thank you for your insight , while i understand what you said , i have more a problem with planing ahead . 
  because i play a prescripted storyline i dont have to plan out that much events but rather how they will play out , who will be there , what do the persons involved may say , what do they have to sell and so on . 
  as i mentioned before i should get more time into planing out my sessions . 
  oh and btw . 
  thanks for the link even though i will loose probably the complete day to tvtropes again . 
  i heard of the story before but til that they had to remove the marked plate and replace 16 coilwindings . 
  while i can understand his thinking , even if i try to move my mouse perfectly aligned to the right or left it moves a litle up and down . 
  how can someone not notice it and understand why . 
  not as bad , but i was in our marketing some time ago and they had moved and one was just setting everything up . 
  they wanted to see each other and because the was sitting diagonally , logically the displays where set to the left of the table . 
  i was helping with an other problem when i heard , that the display had to go to the right , because she couldnt accept to move the mouse to the right of the right display to get to the left display . 
  turn around , shake head , right click desktop , settings , drag one display on the other side . 
  3 people watching and saying nothing . 
  good day .

  because i sometimes have stupid users too , with some of them my solution would be to do what they should do . 
  i wouldnt tell them to go on that side and press that button and enter their email but rather go there myself and then enter the email . 
  is a bit funky but works with the worst . 
  just remember to not do this with automatically send password reset links . 
  they need to learn themselfs where that button is . 
  i never new you could redirect a specific redirect . 
  til, 
  edit : how would the browser know to reload the cache of that side ? 
  in my mind , that would just keep redirecting back and forth . 
  well yes your option works but only because is not much near it . 
  do that with a cable right next to other 30 cables coming from a switch and there you got a reason for isolated wires . 
  if you dont mind telling me , why did you only connect 4 and not for the purpose of why not , all of them while you was at it . 
  thank you very much for your answer , your thinking is defenetly something i will look for in the future how i can implement it . 
  i should speak to my party on how they think will advance and where they want to be in a year or something while at the same time explaining that the module i am working with is halfway set in stone . 
  do you have any hints , tricks and tips for getting along with all the rules i have to remember myself ( pathfinder ) and how to have something ready like a shop inventory . 
  should i do that before we start to play or is it to much to have 20 shops made ready if they might as well leave the city without looking at one of them . 
  because this is the third time i am dming i am still not quite sure how to balance things out the best . 
  i dont want to give them weapons that are to good but at the same time i dont want them running from shop to shop seeing it is all not in their reach and get mad .

  last time i tried you could still upgrade for free with [ this ] ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade ) or download the media creation tool and update with the date set back and without internet connection . 
  i still belive that it is still accepting win 7 / 8 / 8.1 keys for the windows 10 installation .

  [ steam ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/vm6 ), 
  not sure if i should be happy to have seen that video in 2 different languages while in training . 
   sorry to do this to you, 
  * do what ? 
  it was more of a `` that video is kind of stupid but i watched it anyway twice before from start to end '' not a `` this is extremely old '', 
  i guess i didnt get my point out right . 
  i tried to say that i watched that last year and i am not sure if i should be happy to know it or that there is not really a better equivalent of it . 
  i mean we watched it in school training for understanding , while everyone of us could install a network without a problem and knew all the osi-layer / ip , could configer server , clients , router and switches ^ ^ is ^ ^ that ^ ^ the ^ ^ plural ? 
  i am late i guess , but i couldnt write this without a mech under my hands . 
  that wouldnt be fitting .

  actually , the poker ii has the fn+wasd , the pok3r has fn+ijkl because sound settings are on the left . 
  then again , you can switch dip3 and use caps as fn which makes working really easy .
