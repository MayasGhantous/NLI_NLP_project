  * ( this would be my home keyboard , as for games i would like the arrow keys back ) *, 
  anybody with an opinion regarding something like the minivan or similar smaller than 60 % keyboards ? 
  i allready use a pok3r and can use all of the fn keys without thinking but going one row less seems critical . 
  is it just a rethinking or are there any problems in normal day to day usage ? 
  * ( this would then go to work with me ) *, 
  edit : would like to stay with cherry mx , as i got some artisan 's and am happy with clears but would like to check out browns . 
  any similar switches might work though . 
  budget is open . 
  yes i know that and use it quite often but i often would like to have the dedicated feeling . 
  dont know quite why . 
  edit : the bigger key feeling is somehow disturbing . 
  that is why i more often use ijkl if possible . 
  edit answer ; just looked at the 65 % keyboard guide . 
  guess i missed that one . 
  that answered quite a few questions . 
  thank you very much . 
  mind sharing the puzzle or if you dont have it anymore , the theme / complexity of it ? 
  that sounds awesome . 
  my local `` winter x-mas '' market sells those each year . 
  i guess i have to work out how it would come up in the story i am playing right now . 
  my player probably wont like this \u0ca0 \u2323 \u0ca0, 
  edit : dont worry , they know my love for complicated puzzles and most of the time they finish it and get something overpowered . 
  and it is never critical for the story or quests they are doing . 
  the best was taking 3 sessions with 2 weeks in between each . 
  so 6 weeks to finish a mix of translating , completing an riddle to know what to search for , combining all of the pieces in a special way to know where to go and what to say , translated back into the first language . 
  it is possible to play a rpg with just one pc and one gm ? 
  is that any fun at all ? 
  my last one broke after i rolled a critical 1 while powering it on . 
  at what system should i look or would pathfinder as an example work out too ? 
  that is a nice idea and touch to it , then again , my players wander around with barely nothing . 
  just selling everything they get and wearing their armor all day long because there could happen something any time ... 
  sounds like you have to talk with him personally and if he wont change , you have to let him go from the game . 
  it might not be the best story wise but if it is bothering you and stopping the game / hindering the fun for everyone else , then there is no way i would see that person fitting in that game . 
  i tried pathfinder with some good friends of mine but while i can have a really good time with them in normal situations , i had to say to 2 of my players , that the way they are playing / not playing because they dont pay attention is not good for anyone and if they wont change that in the next session i will seek out for others to fill in their role and suspending them from the game . 
  that is what happend , of my starting 4 only 1 is still playing in my group . 
  1 didnt pay enough interest , 1 was just messing and wasnt interested in rules just playing how he wanted and 1 hadnt enough time . 
  in revision i would say that this is somewhat hard ( with good friends ) but the best to keep the fun for everyone else . 
  i use [ this ] ( http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=common;common=human%20male ) which works out great for me . 
  i am quite new to roll20 but i found the other pathfinder character sheets . 
  they have nearly everything inserted , calculated and ready for you . 
  my sorcerer pc has all spells written in , filled out with information and just needs to press a roll button . 
  ** laughing touch **, 
  * spell level : * hexer , 1, 
  * school : * fey, 
  * cast time : * 1, 
  * duration : * 1 round, 
  * rolls *, 
  * caster level check = * 9, 
  at 1st level , you can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1 round as a melee touch attack . 
  a laughing creature can only take a move action but can defend itself normally . 
  once a creature has been affected by laughing touch , it is immune to its effects for 24 hours . 
  you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 8 . 
  this is a mind-affecting effect . 
  everything is written out in the description in case someone else wants to know it and even if we mostlikely only need 2 informations , one button press is not that complicated . 
  as someone late to the question , running up to a group and suddenly answering a question from hours before . 
  or even better , someone says / thread after a joke / sentence and everyone just stops talking . 
  i guess , he was thinking bluetooth is just a nother name for his thinking `` blueteeth hole '' which might be an usb 3.0 port which often are blue to indicate the 3.0 advantage . 
  then again , i cant understand how he wants his mouse plugged in there as there is no wire . 
  half related note : our mice are working over bluetooth too but they have a small dongle inside , which goes into the fancy `` blueteeth hole '' ( or 2.0 ) . 
  ~ ~ you should put a link to the app or at least name it , so people can see what is in there and might be missing for them . ~ ~, 
  edit : derping is not good without coffee . 
   a * n * idiot, 
  [ there are quite a few adventure paths ] ( http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurepath ) that could help you get started if you dont want to make up a complete story on your own . 
  [ there are even free rpg ] ( http://paizo.com/pathfinder/modules/freerpgday ) a day pdf 's but i havent use any of those yet . 
  i can recommend to start with something easy , for example [ we be goblins ] ( http://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5w ) and [ we be goblins too ] ( http://paizo.com/products/btpy8xc3?pathfinder-module-we-be-goblins-too ) . 
  i myself didnt know how to advance after the beginners box too . 
  i thought about what could happen to my pc 's after they have slaigned the dragon ( was it one ? ) . 
  if you dont want to start out with a complete story or an adventure path , you could pre create some characters , let your players choose one and put them in a dungeon . 
  that way they have limited possibilites where to go or what to do and you can still learn encounters , atmosphere , maybe put some traps or puzzles in and think about loot . 
  it really helps to get a hang onto the complete rules as those are a bit more challenging for beginner dms to understand and remember but then again are much better to play with . 
  i wish you the best of luck and a good time . 
  becuase i had nearly no information or ressources when i started , here are some of what i still use :, 
  [ random item generator ] ( http://mcmustard.com/pf_items/index.html ) or [ everything random ] ( http://donjon.bin.sh/ ) ,, 
  [ dungeon mapper ] ( http://pyromancers.com/dungeon-painter-online/ ) or [ city map ] ( http://inkwellideas.com/free-tools/random-city-map-generator/ ) ,, 
  [ sheets that may come in handy ] ( http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/build/pathfinder ), 
  and of course the / r/pathfinder _ rpg [ ressources !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pathfinder_rpg/wiki/resources ), 
  i guess you should calm down some . 
  you are able to script everything you want with 10 bugs per month . 
  that way use something like [ this ] ( https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/1669505/script-creaturegen-pathfinder-monster-statblock-%3e-combat-ready-token-slash-journal/ ) and be happy to have your monster easy . 
  roll20 is just a platform . 
  you dont need to use it . 
  if you want to share free content or community content than share it for example here at reddit . 
  but if roll20 want to make money , which they need to , to keep the server up , they better not put everything for free on their own side . 
  in addition to that some creators just want money for what they did and that , at least for me , is completly fine . 
  and just saying , there is free content . 
  open a game and click on the picture item to get tokens , maps and so on , search for what you need and ... 
  look at that , there is a part called `` from the web '' which is free . 
  it might not be the best but i did a complete campaign just with that without any problems . 
  it is not that roll20 is forbidding custom content . 
  and if you want to share it , where did you get it ? 
  if you uploaded it yourself , why not just send that to the person you want to share it too directly ? 
  and under premium assets are even free ones now . 
  from your example the stores would need to prevent people from selling in their own shop , which is just how life is . 
  well written and even though i knew from the `` invalid username or password '' that it will be with 90 % chance the wronge user name i read through it all . 
  if i get a similar problem i always check the `` bad password '' entry in the ad first to see if they actually can write their own username . 
  because user think they are smarter that i am , i say to `` delete the complete name because sometimes a space or something else gets stuck there and type in $ realusername '' at least by then they mostly understand that there was a wrong username in the loginfield . 
  that is quite a nice sunset , i hope they did a sunrise soon though . 
  that is an awesomely thought out plan and as a gm that would scare and impress me at the same time . 
  finding something for them to get the story going would be interesting .
