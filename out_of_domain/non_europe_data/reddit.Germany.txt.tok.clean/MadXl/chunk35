  1 ) masterkey with clears ? 
  absolutely !, 
  that would be awesome and pulling me further into buying the master key pro s, 
  2 ) full key is okay but i would prefer the tkl variation . 
  3 ) i wouldnt mind no led 's but if i could choose , a `` clear '' keyboard with even clear caps without led 's ? 
  i would like to see at least one color . 
  doesnt need to be rgb lighting ~ ~ , everyone could go to razer for that :p ~ ~ . 
  sorry , but it is further, 
   \u0191\u01b1\u01a6\u0166\u0126\u0190\u0158, 
  actually it is further . 
  not sure if you are a bot now or not . 
  i 'll happily take those from picture 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 . 
  thanks in advance . 
   the bowling guy, 
  amusingly , that hint helped . 
  well done . 
  well my firefox blocks every kind of java and javascript from sites i havent allowed . 
  that way it showed me maybe from the first second untill i allowed it to show me yes, 
   multiplying damage : sometimes you multiply damage by some factor , such as on a critical hit . 
  * roll * the damage ( with all modifiers ) * multiple times * and total the results . 
   note : when you multiply damage more than once , each multiplier works off the original , unmultiplied damage . 
  so if you are asked to double the damage twice , the end result is three times the normal damage . 
   exception : extra damage dice over and above a weapon 's normal damage are never multiplied . 
  yes you are right . 
  might sound wierd at first but mainly the first paragraph is key . 
  ** roll [ ... ] multiple times **,

  `` wait dont kill him yet ! '',

  it looks like , that would enable 2 speakers anywhere in my apartment but at the same time , i dont see how my receiver would be able to send music to them . 
  or am i simply missing something ? 
  all i could find is streaming music from your smartphone or from your browser to the chromecast . 
  thanks for the information , i saw the connect can be connected to my speakers but thought it would just work one way ( giving music to the receiver ) . 
  i guess i have to look into spending some more money . 
  i find i wierd , that everybody tells another key combination to get the right shift , ctrl , pn and fn work as arrow keys . 
  for me it is right-alt + space but in the manual it says left-win + right-alt + space . 
  and then from time to time someone says its fn + space . 
  yeah the fn on the caps lock button is a real helper . 
  now i use nearly all fn functions on a daily basis just because i can press fn and my prefered button at the same time . 
  well if you want arrow keys all the time without pressing fn + ijkl then that might be something for you . 
  the only change i had to accept was that you have to stop using the right shift key if you want to write something big . 
  have you tried the bottom right keys as arrow keys ( right-shift , pn , fn and right ctrl ) ? 
  that helped me a lot changing to a 60 % keyboard . 
  now my pok3r does everything i need on a keyboard . 
  how much for the chakram and do you have a dominus snakeskin, 
  decal ? 
  is that an and | or an or | ? 
  ( you want 1 cc3 or 3 cc2 or 2 cc1 , or you want only 2 cc1 ), 
  edit : would like the dominus snakeskin, 
  how many cc1 and cc2 for chakram and trinity ?

  * ftfy *, 
  you dont want the reincarnated god of reincarnation ( 32 ) beeing mad you , or do you ? 
  or of beer which is 4.0, 
  in my opinion , there was a time for party for that group . 
  but adventures dont have a complete ending and then a new start after some time . 
  if they happen to loot and find the dead guard , that itself is a new story hook . 
  they dont need to go after it immediately . 
  personally i like that kind of story more . 
  i myself give my players time to do personal or stupid stuff in taverns / citys / after fights . 
  but if they dont get every hint i drop or just spend to much time without going after the story plots , when they will get to it , it might be allready to late . 
  sure , they need some rest and happy ending but to be an hero , you need to be always ready for what ever the gm / world throws at you . 
  while mistakes are part of the process and i still do them ( over a year of dming now ) the important part is to tell your gm . 
  i ask my players reguarly what i could improve or what was wrong with an encounter , even what they have in mind in the future and so on . 
  i would suggest talking with your gm before the next session but without blaming anyone . 
  ask him what his reasoning was for that attack or how he thought it would play out . 
  tell him that players gon na take a route you cant prepare for 80 % of the time and that he might wan na take a look at this thread . 
  importance for new gm 's is not only playing much to get into the feeling but also thinking about would could be done better . 
  i still reguarly read every `` new gm here '' post i can find and what not to do . 
  that combined with something like the http://theangrygm.com/ is really helpfull . 
  what i just recently learned or understood completly is , that npc or enemys dont just work how you want them but they need to be played as a thinking individual . 
  they have goals and reasons for what they do . 
  why are the monks attacking , do they need to comunicate with each other , have they other ways to get around that situation and maybe they are not sure if they could even win that fight . 
  they dont know that they are themselfs cr10 and you are not . 
  that combined with the fact that an cr10 encounter for your group should not be there in the first place without any indication that this might end badly . 
  sure you can flee but there is a problem with fleeing from a drake with lvl 3 and fighting only 3 monks that look exactly like some i allready killed some level before . 
  i wish you and your group good luck and you all have learned out of that encounter . 
  edit : [ just saw that he isnt improving ... see notes there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pathfinder_rpg/comments/588spj/are_we_in_the_wrong_here/d8yfs3k ), 
  i wouldnt directly go as far as finding a new table but maybe start by switching some roles . 
  see if he is recognizing what he might be doing wrong or where he needs to improve as a player can open his eyes . 
  then on the other hand if he is still not advancing and learning , just kicking him from the table would be more reasonable . 
  getting all your things from the,

  [ i used this guide as a recommendation .

  other than that , it really depends on other things that are standing in the room . 
  as a h [ amburger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburg ) i am not sure how to feel . 
  i play like a hamburger all the time ... 
  awesome , could we get this stickied to the top of the the sub as an announcment , so more people may see this and participate ? 
  while i look forward to try out zealios , at the moment i like my clears very much .
