  these are the times , i wish i could be as creative on a sheet of paper or online as i am in my mind . 
  having a full fleshed out view in your head and then breaking it down , how the clifside would look like is mostly depressing . 
  at least my players get a good laugh . 
  really like your idea though . 
  might open photoshop next time too . 
  at the moment i write everything down on a seperate piece of paper and loose overview sometimes or missing an aspect which i then need to introduce later somehow . 
  for the start to complete aerials not bad , but you need to try and learn how to land correctly . 
  this will help you improve in half the time or at least make the game more enjoyable . 
  even if you miss the aerial , and you will mostlikely , it is always good to have a good landing to follow the ball or even get back to your own side as quick as possible . 
  just as a small help for the future . 
  it helped me a lot and i didnt loose as much games just because of trying to aerial and missing because i could actually be saving the enemys goal faster . 
  good luck in the future , it is a long but nice way . 
  those ears !!!, 
  want !!, 
  even if lime ones arent my prefered color they would probably look dope . 
  sad thing , that i dont have any keys . 
  but no problem . 
  just hoping for my random first painted item every week is okay \u2022 _ \u2022 you should get those keys , i would do the same , 
   edit : wow this really caught traction . 
  at least , when you copy paste something , have the effort to delete things like this ... 
  well , the problem lies at the start when we want to input `` one '' as the password and it is to short and we then go over to `` zerozeroone '' because it needs at least 8 digits . 
  i am so excited , second raffle this month i actually see before it is over . 
  awesome . 
  i am so sanguine i could `` sang-u-in - [ e '' - major ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_major ) . 
  reading the title ... 
  interesting, 
  reading the comments ... 
  i dont get what should be wrong about it ... 
  reading the article and realising , that gm isnt a game master for some pen and paper but acutually generalmotors with a stupid idea . 
  and i was hoping my players could shop while i drive to them ... 
  on the other hand , my wisdom is high enough to sense your motive and the bluff will not work . 
  well i saw it sometime ago . 
  but basically as the others said , he made a flip , landed on his head / neck and is now paralysed . 
  thats the reason why you should just jump over the car without a flip . 
  flip gets you broken . 
  if you are interested , i can translate it later . 
  nice !,

  ~ ~ says the one with a `` specs/imgur here '' flair ... ~ ~, 
  edit : now they are back, 
  never said you are not allowed to find his flair funny . 
  btw your flair is back to normal now i guess ... my bad, 
  well i dont have that much knowledge about different systems but seeing pathfinder as my main at the moment , i have seen some funny things . 
  if i would like to get a sheet with everything i need or could need for than i would use the [ minotaur ] ( http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/build/pathfinder ) sheet . 
  otherwise , i really like simplicity but i cant find the sheet i printed some time back . 
  i then laminated it and you could write on it with an wet eraser . 
  specially in long games it gets hard to understand what is standing there with 50 times writen nearly the same with a normal pen . 
  right now i really like the custom pathfinder sheet from roll20 that we are using , which calculates everything it can and can roll every attack or skill and so on . 
  no pictures of every single one ? 
  \u0298 \u0298, 
  nice caps as always , good luck everyone . 
  nice one , have the same . 
  where did you get the tai-hao from ? 
  but shadow run 5th edition only has 489 pages ... 
  well depends on the drive i guess . 
  my old one just fell apart while trying to use it normaly, 
  wow , now i feel completly stupid . 
  bought mine from mechanicalkeyboards.com with shipping and tax cost . 
  and then it was just ansi and i happily got some iso keys from / r/mechmarket . 
  still i am missing 2 keys and am fighting with myself to buy the complete iso set . 
  i guess i should just put the tai-hao set on my ansi keyboard . 
  but then again , i need a new de-iso keycap set for my pok3r,

  [ what about this 10 tipps ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pathfinder_rpg/comments/1qmk4y/top_10_tips_for_new_gms/ ), 
  well i just typed this text in under a minute with an on screen keyboard and mouse ... 
  have the players evidence , that the face-changing npc is indeed on the run ? 
  maybe he is not what he is telling the party and actually tries to get revenge on someone completly else ? 
  then at the time he tries to setup the evidence from an other fight , the baddies , which actually watched him the totall time , get into action and before the players can do anything , the npc is gone and 10 people in the lab are dead . 
  they then have to find out why and where the npc is , so he isnt telling anyone their story . 
  at least tell them that their own evidence is gone . 
  maybe a fire or something ? 
  well with 25 you can have a son / daughter about 7-8 years old , able to write and post on reddit about his / hers fathers account .

  never thought about that it should and is possible, 
  only if you write the message on your hand in the first place, 
   fascinating ^ ly ^ sad, 
  a ticketsystem is not only there to help you remember thinks , but in addition to that make a better overview what you should do next , who maybe should do it if more than one person working in it , how you solved the problem the last time and documentation . 
  most ticketsystems can be all this stuff and to get priorities right , she isnt number one all the time , if she wants something , email is there to see it when you got time and then think about when you got time to do it . 
  i know , this is probably how it should be and not quite how it is in your situation , but wanted to contribute by giving you some more keywords for your next discussion .
