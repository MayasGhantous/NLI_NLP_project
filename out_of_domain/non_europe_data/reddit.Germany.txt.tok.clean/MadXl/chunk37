  even easier and cooler , take a straw push it in some liquid , put your finger on top , pull the straw out of the liquid and the liquid in the straw will stay there until you lift your finger . 
  well if you melt an icecube and freeze it again , the structure wont be cubic if you havent helped in some way . 
  same will probably go for the paper . 
  just that the paper is made out of different elements that go everywhere and dont get pushed back together in their `` cubic '' form,

  but only the first time . 
  if they want to sleep near the enemys base after defeating 20 or so and dont bother with putting a night watch up nor putting the fire out in plains , then they may do it but i tell them , the odds to survive that was pretty low and they all had a nighmare , how they got kidnapped and murdered because they had no one watching at night . 
  usually they only do their mistakes once,

  what if that is my fetish ? 
  normally rule 0 is , everybody should have fun . 
  it circumvents all other rules in a way but that is the only reason why you play in the first place so it is okay . 
  what the dm says only overwrites every rulebook rule . 
  but should still look out for rule 0 that everyone is having fun .
