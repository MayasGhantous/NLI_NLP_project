  someone safe his ~ ~ soul ~ ~ wallet, 
  if everybody is happy about it there is no problem , even if played wrong , when all do it it isnt that bad . 
  i missed out on the fact , that your str bonus is added to every melee hit ( i know sometimes not but would have to re read it now :p ) but because i forget about it on my pc 's as well as my npc 's and monsters there was no problem . 
  after 10 sessions someone went to wield a weapon with 2 hands and got the bonus where i thought why wouldnt he get it normaly . 
  i think i might be a ranger then because i dont get it ... \u25d4 \u032f \u25d4, 
   mimic in a chest, 
  absolutly laughing in tears , that will leave my group mad for weeks, 
  oh wow ... even with the comic strip in the other comment it didnt come to my mind that a seal could mean both . 
  damn . 
  some things are just to small to look over , as you are not speaking english as the first language . 
  thanks for the response, 
   it will be coming via mail, 
  as nothing has made it to my door by now , i just wanted to ask , from where you are shipping the things and/or if there is any tracking . 
  on one hand i find it quite daunting to hear that so many havent received something yet , on the other hand that got me thinking that i will probably write myself in this year as a backup santa . 
  happily waiting for a reply . 
   do people really stare perfectly straight down a the keyboard when typing, 
  touch typing ? 
  i dont look at my keyboard while typing . 
  [ video link for the lazy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du7iknmqbis ), 
   `` you spent how much on a keyboard ??? '', 
  everytime i hear that , i start to speak with lower volume more and more till i say : maybe 10 maybe 100 maybe 50 just for that one key maybe 600 in complete , maybe not . 
  who knows , right ... 
  i got 6 abs but if you want to see them , you need to come with me ... 
  i have practice with lubing \u0ca0 \u2323 \u0ca0, 
  i like to switch things up from time to time, 
  du ... so cool . 
  wishing good luck to everyone . 
  i thought i was in / r/childrenfallingover not in / r/rocketleague for some reason, 
  that moment , where you think about getting jarvis , glados or if you want johnny depp speaking with you like in transcend, 
  [ i guess you will like to read this one then ... ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/roko's_basilisk ), 
  at least x-post it or give credit somehow ... 
  still i guess / u/birthday _ boy_blam isnt the first to post this , as to how jpg this is . 
  pmed, 
  i guess , when the world has gotten that dark und ugly , that you want to escape it , vr is the best chance to get away from it . 
  so i guess it will be there for many people in the future , well at least those who can afford it ... 
  wait those wont live in ugly places . 
  couldnt have said it any better . 
  you are not allowed to use that yet , you need to build an endgame chair out of endgame keyboards first , from which you might hang yourself ... 
  but please dont ... 
   `` do not touch !!!,

  that is far to much text , lets go back to something their brain might be able to understand :, 
  nice combination of / r/hometheater / r/battlestations / r/homelab and some more i might not know . 
  love the clean and tidied up office room . 
  what projector is that and for what are you using the hdmi switch if it has 4 in and 4 out ? 
  thanks for the reply . 
  but my tesla ... 
  i dont want to imagine what i would drive then instead, 
  * nooooooo ... . *, 
  that one looks sweet , but over my budget i guess ... then again , it is a `` what if there was no tesla situation '' in the first place, 
  they look awesome , gon na look out for the sale . 
  and i guess this qualifies , so mx pls . 
  confirmed, 
  nobody got a clue but still here i am commenting for the chance , wooh giveaway !, 
   glorious webmaster, 
  `` fix my search senpai '' might explain the asian males ... 
   precordial clutch syndrome, 
  while it is called precordial catch syndrome i still thank you very much . 
  getting to know what bothered youself for some years without any explanation from any doc and getting a random answer in the thread without searching is awesome . 
  but a patch ai n't one, 
  sweet keys  hope you get well soon . 
  i guess that really depends on your own opinion . 
  while i like the keycapssets with colors more on tkl keyboards more , i like the compact and artistic / minimalistic style of < 60 % keyboards more . 
  personally i really would like to have a 40 % on the go , a 60 % at home and a 70 % at work . 
  then again , my girlfriend would like to have a full keyboard , so i get to buy / use / love / type on every kind . 
  absolutely what i was thinking . 
  beeing gming rotrl myself , i can just keep up with 4 hour sessions every week . 
  i dont want to think about how much time i would need to prepare for my group . 
  we are playing over a half year now but they just got to the first part of the `` skinning '' murders ( if that is the english translation ), 
   fx-8350 - back in the day, 
  end of 2012 : /, 
  well maybe not as big as a mistake as the others here but basically i thought `` free check '' would be free with an data recovery firm . 
  it was only free if you paid for the complete recovery but that would have cost me 2000 and it wasnt even my own hdd , just the pc from a friend i wanted to help out . 
  so yeah , i paid the 170 something just for shipping back and forth with them taking a look at the hdd . 
  still havent told my friend , because i think it was my fault and not in anyway has he any part in that . 
  oh and the one year i paid for online subscription for something i didnt use ( 240 in total ) or the 1 and a half year online service at my old place . 
  luckily the new people renting it have gone with it and paid it back to me basically ... 
   sell as lake front property, 
  and i thought that died out allready, 
  the last time i saw that gif , the comments agreed on it beeing a 8 core cpu but 3 are in idle and dont care . 
  just 16 minutes before your post , as an answer to the same comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/63oiqn/til_ravens_can_speak_better_than_parrots_enjoy/dfwe3g3/, 
  just change the skin o.o, 
  a darker grape with green skin on . 
  an orange with an apple skin , think about the food drama you can create . 
  \u0298 \u203f \u0298, 
  i would reduce the health but keep a small amount of damage reduction and spell resistance . 
  maybe it lost its battleaxe which would make it significantly weaker . 
  let it cast darkness and in addition to what the others said , it is quite heavy with 1500 pounds . 
  i would say that when the first one charges or gets near the demon , they feel the floor getting a bit lower . 
  when all of them stand nearby let the floor drop down where the battleaxe could be ? 
  that would change the fight dramatically . 
  edit : somehow i thought they are much lower level ... so ignore the first part of the damage reduction if they are advanced enough to fight it . 
   i believe tkl is still pretty popular , if not the most used around the world . 
  i guess that might be the truth , as everyone buying a tkl or full mk isnt always a part of the hobby or on reddit , while on the other side , to build your own 40 % or getting the best 60 % or ... you would take some research and land here and admire what you see . 
  what happend with the updated variant v1 .14.5 ? 
  the link only goes to [ deleted ] ... 
  and the mediafire link is the same as the sync link . 
  i guess to get to a normal rack size ?
