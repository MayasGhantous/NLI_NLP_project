  now i feel like having `` stupid '' players while beeing not the best gm still can bring some kind of fun . 
  i wonder what would happen if i could fix all of that ... 
  thanks for the list , guess i have to try again and again to involve my players more with non standard attacks as well as bringing the world more alive . 
  the beginner box breaks everything down to the point where you can choose between 5 ( if i am not mistaken ) different chars and then just play . 
  the provided rules give a feeling of the system but at the same time got changed to stay on the easy side of the beginners box . 
  while yes , i had fun with the beginners box and it really is just reading half an hour and than you can play for around 4 , you dont have much freedom and most of what pathfinder is about is still hidden . 
  the next step after the beginnersbox is the crb and then you need to take you character and advance it ... but you need to basically understand the complete system to find everything you need to know . 
  i myself created every char by now with the help of an online generator . 
  sure it isnt as great and you dont get 100 % freedom but at the same time , you are finished with in minutes . 
  i am not sure if that ties in with your system , but for everything i would let them do `` perception '' checks to see how far their vision is off from the reality . 
  let them face normal creatures or even a cr lower but with the problem , that they might see twice the amount , in different colours , different sizes and with things absurdly wrong . 
  make some random tables in before , so that they can roll for them selfes and you just tell them what might be wrong with that . 
  have some of them see the same thing while one might identify one ally as an enemy . 
  in addition to what might be the direct effects , maybe they get lost and have to find their way back home . 
  could be an interesting start for the next session as well , when they discover things that arent as they thought before .

   or better yet , it 's my own damn question, 
  that reminds me of the one so post of someone answering their own question and then a year later thanking that person ( self ) for it and only realising its their own post because they cant upvote the answer ... 
  enabling the fighter weapon training for everyone . 
  basically if you are good enough to get a boni on a dagger , you should also get a bonus on fighting with a shortsword or kukri . 
  every weapon gets assigned a group and if you are trained in that group , you get a + x to every weapon from that group . 
  makes it easier to switch weapons or use a newly found one even if it isnt one swordbreaker dagger, 
  actually my group never had a fighter ... 
  i guess i would give the fighter a higher bonus but not sure if that is balance whise a good thing . 
  in my opinion that is just a small change for everyone to use . 
  all in all i dont think that this is one of the strongest things of a fighter , so i dont think that it would hurt its build , still you got a good point . 
  but with that in mind , cheating in benchmarks is the worst they could do . 
  if you think , they cheat to be at the top to see for their technically advanced users , the same users will see the cheating benchmark posts and absolutly shit on the company and the phone . 
  this is even worse because not only did they not get a new buyer but also this person is negative affected by the company and probably wont tell someone to buy the phone if there is another one with the same specs fitting the wanted criteria . 
  maybe it shows some love in one field but overall it is a negative feedback gained for gaining some points in a table that not that many people look at as you might think . 
  i for myself , know what a snapdragon 835 is capable of and dont need a benchmark for that . 
  but when i see they cheat for no reason at all again , that is negative affecting my opinion on the device even if it changed nothing of the end perfomance i would get anyway . 
   it might sound incredibly strange , but exactly 8 characters is a hell of a lot better than at most 8 . 
  why do you think that ? 
  with regulating the password length on 8 chars , you are not advancing the security by having passwords longer than 1-7 but reducing the security of 8 digit passwords because a cracking script does not have to go through all 1-7 digit iterations and the 8 digit password possibilitys but just those . 
  while yes , those passwords are easier to crack because they are shorter , the time spend to check those is lost by not letting anybody have those in the first place . 
  the algorithm / dictonary attack / so on will just start with 8 digit passwords . 
  with that said , i really dont want to recommend passwort shorter than 6 in anyway but never set the number of chars you are allowed to input ever . 
  just make it a required length of 6 or 8 depending on what system you got and how long a password is secure . 
   passwords are not case sensitive, 
  ... that just killed your argumentation ~ ~ but yeah ... ~ ~, 
  still you are right, 
  well the biggest problem are not brute forcing the password but using dictonary attacks . 
  with requiering at least one symbol and one number , the dictonary attack has to atleast check all symbols and numbers with each word they got . 
  that makes the check longer overall , even if you just put the number and symbol at the end . 
  and this way , the password can be more secure without requiring your stuff to remember something like \\ 8n258my ) nkbz9s as an password but more like summer2017 !, 
  which in itself is still bad but check it at https://howsecureismypassword.net/ and see how it compares to summerpassw, 
  both got the same length but the second needs 394 * years * more time to crack, 
  woooh , new drawing . 
  good luck everyone, 
  do n't have a good film but good luck everyone and good on you op, 
  well , only if one has 3500 to invest freely at the start and betting on the right horse * s * . 
   it 's a living dungeon that shifts when the pcs do things it does n't like . 
  i guess that says enough, 
  the answer is basically what / u/wasiia said , but in addition , you cant filter out every reflection because then you 've got 0 light . 
  there are some sunglasses that have polarized lenses and those mostly filter reflections from bellow you and some from left and right but rarelly from above ( to my knowledge ) . 
  that way you can be on a boat for example and dont get the reflection from the water below you . 
  still you shouldnt look into the light source directly specially if it is the sun ,

  old thread but did you found a workaround ? 
  got the same problem and can only fix it by running the system in secure mode and open ie than going back . 
  otherwise ie wouldnt open at all . 
  my god !, 
  i never thought about that , but from now on , every website that is shitty gets a bad search term . 
  or maybe like 20 to cover every possibility, 
  not wanting to correct you but only add , that for example my receiver has an multi seat eq where i can add up to 9 listening positions . 
  still your point stands that multi sub + eq = bass nirvana, 
  my bad then , kind of . 
  i remembered the setting to say `` 2nd listening position '' and that i can but not must add up to 9 places . 
  i just checked and in german at least it says exactly that in the manual ( denon avrx1200w ) . 
  might be a translation mistake or there might not be a good reason, 
  good luck everyone , may the rng and community make your day, 
  1 mil and news were saying that pcs die out . 
  so yeah . 
  thank you corsair , gigabyte and the complete pcmr community, 
  not sure if anyone in my family would understand the benefits of that though, 
  well she did ... around the waist and on the other side though, 
   i am still running android m/7 , just because i want to have xposed, 
  if i may ask , what is holding you on xposed ? 
  which additions cant you get by other means ? 
  i myself really holded on the m and xposed and even now after the switch i sometimes miss it .
