  well only unlockhome mainly , thats why i ask . 
  on the other hand , with lineageos and opo i got very many functions out of the box anyway . 
  well , its not voodoo magic and i know that setting . 
  all of them are under smart lock . 
  like unlocked on person by move sensor , unlocked by trusted bluetooth , unlocked by face recognition , unlocked by gps . 
  my problem is , that anyone with the same wifi name could unlock my smartphone then . 
  while unlikely , unlockhome got a setting to check after the mac and not the ssid which was great . 
  on the other hand , the trusted wlan or bluetooth settings can be found under system profiles . 
  this works just not everytime sadly in the past few days . 
  in my opinion most of the xposed things can by circumvented by now with other options allready avaible by the system if you got a nice custom rom . 
  thats why i asked / u/ikeepmynameprivate . 
  as an addition to that , i dont like to depend that much on google and their system and would like to keep as much security as i can , even if for some that goes against something like unlockhome ... 
  thanks for the reply . 
  yeah , youtube background playback is a big one . 
  on the other hand i hear mostly music from spotify or prime music . 
  and for snapprefs , the best xposed feature in my opinion  ... i allready got that and kicked myself out of 4 accounts . 
  now nobody wants to send me snaps anymore . 
  i dont use snapchat anymore . 
  i had gravitybox installed too , but as i said , got most functions now over the rom itself, 
   `` hello this is ifixtheinternet with isp , calling about the internet being down . '', 
  i was like `` damn thats a clever name to say as someone fixing things for an isp '' ... then i saw you username . 
  well done . 
  and for the story , even if one small thing could be taken out of perspective , some users will do it every time . 
  even if i write excatly what they have to do , they still fuck it up . 
  or get a raspberrypi , install pihole and enable you pi as primary dns in your router . 
  same thing done but for every device on your network . 
  even smart tvs and such wont get ads . 
  i trusted op that this might be awesome and within 30 minutes i went from trust untill the other one destroys my trust to never trust anyone to trust even if they make a mistake . 
  go play it , have fun , learn something and trust more people for good . 
  use it as a wireless trackpad and controller for your computer, 
  turn it into a remote computer terminal, 
  use it as a universal smart remote, 
  let it power scientific research, 
  transform it into a free-standing security camera, 
  reframe it as a full-time video conferencing station, 
  turn it into a kitchen command center, 
  make it a data-based extension of your current phone service, 
  make it your live window into the world, 
  convert it into a digital photo frame, 
  use it as a dedicated e-reader, 
  transform it into a dedicated desk calendar, 
  make it a mounted command center for your car, 
  turn it into a kid-friendly learning tool, 
  let it serve as a high-tech e-clock, 
  convert it into a gaming device for your downtime, 
  keep it handy for emergencies, 
  turn it into your personal testing ground, 
  sell it, 
  donate it, 
  but you can get 2 factor authentication for paypal ...

  adding to what the others said , check out / r/zeos and start with a 2.0 or 2.1 system ( depending on preference and budget / availability ), 
  reminded me of lego island , dont know if this is what you was searching for , but its look quite similar . 
  i am not sure but reading the other comments , it should be like a r710 so a rack mountable server definitely, 
  add a . com and you got a nice business idea there ... 
  its always nice to help others but first priority should always be on yourself . 
  you did the right thing , even if it might not look like it today . 
  on the other hand , if something could have happend , maybe you would sit there too from then on because you lost everything for a person you didnt even know . 
   now do the same for ~ ~ chess ~ ~ go !, 
  for everyone finding that funny and want more , watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuok2xe6zsg&amp;list=pltsdv2_hng54ugzzdlbiqnpqpq5d90tjt ), 
  or just search people of boiler room on youtube . 
  the question is , is it labled nsfw because it so greazy and dirty or is it labled nsfw because of rubber dome ? 
  i 'm one with the blobs , and the blobs with me . 
  not sure if you still need the help but was going through older posts and thought why not answer , maybe it will help someone in the future ... 
  i had the same problem and came to the conclusion to delete those files and after some trying i got to the point to add a task sequence at the end of the deployment script right before the last reboot . 
  there i would run a short bash script from my % scriptroot % folder . 
  ( cmd.exe / c '' % scriptroot % \\ 1703_fix . bat '' ), 
  cd c : \\ users \\ default \\ appdata \\ local \\ microsoft \\ windows, 
  del / f / q / a : sh . \\ webcache . \\ inetcache . \\ webcachelock.dat, 
  rmdir / s / q . \\ webcache, 
  interesting to see that you somehow still find time to be on reddit . 
  may i ask what you use or would recomend to automate linux builds ? 
  well , thats a good thing . 
  my thought was more like his / hers work let him/her free to go home and not care about work even if you are the only person . 
  hey guys , as far as i can tell nobody found this out by now . 
  i found a interesting cave with a creepy monster inside . 
  to find the cave you have to go to the beach with the sailboat and look on the land , then go right still on the beach and now to your left in the rocks there is an entrance . 
  it might be hard to get into but with some sprinting jumping and crouching it can be passed . 
  inside is a monster that looks like its combined out of 3 persons ( mostly women as i can tell ) and its fighting you with its first 2 legs . 
  the heads are combined too and like in one bag . 
  skin-bag !, 
  as far as i can tell it deals no damage and cant receive any , while it still makes the damage indicator sound if you hit it . 
  if anyone of you have seen this too tell what you think . 
  ps : pictures will follow as soon as possible -  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yev8n ), 
  pss : the cave has some hanging down persons like the cave after you die too, 
  so i just was in london in my holidays and i saw the warwick house street . 
  now that i am interested share your findings of all occasions that you have found of the same name as something league related and lets make a list just for interestes . 
  thanks for your time and help . 
  so i decided to upgrade my computer and in my opinion i would upgrade the cpu but here i am to ask / r/buildapc . 
  my budget is around 500 $ and i am from germany . 
  my displays are going to change from an asus ( vga ) and a tv ( hdmi ) to at least 1 benq i think and the asus probably . 
  recommodations are welcome .
