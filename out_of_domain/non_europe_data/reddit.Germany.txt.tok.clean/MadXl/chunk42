  forgot to mention : all this is already my provided build and i am mostly gaming on it . 
  i know everyone says combat is one stuff and you should get more interactive traps in but for me ( as the gm ) i have more fun making interesting and challenging traps for my pc than making combat encounters . 
  it is so boring . 
  i say the description of the room =  encounter =  fight =  round per round everyone rolls boring as f *** ( sorry but it really feels like that for me ) . 
  i allready searched for variety but my pc 's just stand there and fight . 
  i told them they can grapple throw dirt and sand or even run around them to get extra points for rolling or negative points for the enemy but they rarelly do that . 
  they just stand there at there max range and do the same stuff over and over . 
  they also lack the roleplaying part . 
  i mean they forget to eat and drink that is okay but they dont even say they try to open the door they say i go to the next room what do i see ? 
  how should i counter that ? 
  i am fairelly new to gm just played the beginner box and 2 self made adventures that was fun but with i think 3 encounters total and 2 tpk in that manner ... 
  i think i dont get the rules or play to to much binded to the rules . 
  my pc dont know the rulework by far by the way . 
  i really dont know what to do and i got the feeling my creativity is just burned out by now with just 3 sessions . 
  need help pls !, 
  edit : thanks everyone for your help i think i got a really wrong perspective on how to play or let them play i should say . 
  the stuff is really helpfull and i can allready imagine how that will work better in the next session . 
  and i will try to make stuff more obvius like traped doors or hallways . 
  thanks again this helped me very well . 
  i got this error in ftb infinity :,

  please , report this problem to the mono team, 
  so where should i report this ? 
  or what does it mean ? 
  or is it maybe a problem with the server provider ? 
  so me and some friends played infinity and i played monster and such before . 
  but now we came to a point were they are loosing interest and i on my part cant get myself into thaumcraft or bees because of not enough interest for the boring early game stuff ... 
  so i thought about playing a quest based modpack on the server together . 
  here i am now and would like to get some suggestions from you guys . 
  personally i want to do more magic stuff but i guess some tech stuff in there should be good to go . 
  i dont know yet what kind of different packs are out there and the possible new flair showed me how much there are at a minimum . 
  thanks for your help in advance and have a great weekend , 
  i found [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/18b8r1/end_of_an_era/ ) after searching the top of this subreddit from the last year and thought what happend till now . 
  because i didnt found any other simple search/compare site i took google and got [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/9ghsdvv ) as a result .

  and funfact : norway and sweden have the most insterest ,
