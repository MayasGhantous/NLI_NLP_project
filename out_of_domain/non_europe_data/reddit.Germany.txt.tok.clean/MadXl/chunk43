  the mobo , cpu with cooler and memory as well as the 250 gb and the 500 gb hdd are going away to my buddy, 
  hey / r/ftb ,, 
  because i had some off-time i am not really up to date at the moment and need your help to choose a pack to get started again . 
  i would like to play a pack basically alone , without a questing system , in 1.7 + and i like to explore and use tech mostly . 
  i need some different options to build and dont have a problem with unconventional mods or new things i have to learn . 
  if you need any more information from me to offer me a better choice , i am here . 
  in the past i played infinity with a own server , pathfinder , unleashed and monster but never got the drill of the magic mods . 
  i simply couldnt get into botania or thaumcraft but really like to automate as much as possible . 
  oh and storage . 
  i need options . 
  thank you very much in advance . 
  so basically i have around 400 $ to spare for a new audio setup in my livingroom . 
  i have a 55 '' tv currently outputting the sound out of the headset port to an old 40-50 $ 2.1 system . 
  the sub is powerfull enough to get the complete apartment shaking but that isnt wanted most of the time . 
  my living room is not really big , as i am sitting like 2 m away from the screen and for a good setup the speaker cant get much farther away then besides the tv or next to the couch ( left and right ) . 
  all in all it might be , with a split room usage , a 3m * 5m space . 
  i am currently deciding if an av-receiver with 5.2 and 4k passthrough ( even though my tv cant support it right now -  maybe in the future ) like [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.de/dp/b00x4faqse/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_ttl?_encoding=utf8&colid=11nber3vqvysr&coliid=i8a3srchcfzn1 ) one matched with 2 good bookshelf speaker for now ( upgradable in the future ) or [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.de/dp/b003oq4i1o/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_ttl?_encoding=utf8&colid=11nber3vqvysr&coliid=i1g0e7wmme5ydh ) 5.1 system wich , while mostly plastic and that way not giving a good sound , should be far better than my current 2 small plastic speaker setup . 
  on the other hand i could step away from a av-receiver if you say that it is not quite needed right now for me as i may not benefit enough from it ( specially if i dont necessery need a powerfull sub ) and should then better take a dac like [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.de/dp/b006iph5h2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_s_ttl?_encoding=utf8&colid=11nber3vqvysr&coliid=i3b26kyxfy7o4t ) for example . 
  i really apreciate your help . 
  if i forgot to give any required information that might be needed , i try to answer as fast and good as i can . 
  by the way , the option to wait and safe some money till i have a bigger apartment and get a better audio setup then is considered as well . 
  my device , oneplus one is rooted and normally i could use snapchat along with xposed . 
  because i would like to use snapprefs i had to log out , downgrade and then log back in . 
  i followed the guide from [ here ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=56908686&postcount=2 ) but even with uninstalling i couldnt get it to work . 
  then i tried to update my rom because a new version was out anyway ( [ sultans cm13 unofficial ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/orig-development/rom-kernel-unofficial-cyanogenmod-13-0-t3242700 ) ) and because of the update xposed gets uninstalled automatically so before i reinstalled it i tried to login in again to no avail . 
  then i tried different xposed modules like `` no device check '' or `` rootcloak '' but both couldnt hide xposed / root from snapchat . 
  then i searched for other ways and found a user with the same problem like me wich got the answer from someone else :, 
   then something else in your device flags as a threat/modification in safetynet . 
  so i downloaded safetynet helper from the appstore wich should theoretically show what is stopping safetynet from giving me the go . 
  it shows now `` fail '' because : google play services connection failed . 
  i am using the app disableservices on my phone but it wont let me reactivate some of the settings ( with root ) . 
  i hoped by deinstalling it should get all services back running ( after a softreboot ) but it did nothing . 
  basically i dont know what to do now . 
  i tried different settings , followed every guide i could find and tried different snapchat versions ( even those that wont work with snapprefs ) . 
  i hope there is a way to get it working . 
  if you think it might help i will try to do a clean install ( wiping system and data ) next . 
  untill now i have always dirty flashed . 
  i just found that nice set and while i can find some sites where i might buy it , the iso enter-key is always missing . 
  i want to use it on my pok3r so i need theoretically only those ( 62 if i remember correctly ) keys . 
  maybe someone dont need these beautys anymore . 
  will buy international . 
  i have a mid sized living room with a 55 '' tv and currently a beginner 2.1 setup ( an all in one system kind of , no receiver and just a 3.5 mm jack to connect ) . 
  with a budget of around 500-700 $ i thought about buying a denon avrx520btbke2 av-receiver ( 5.2 with 140 watt ( 6 ohm ) , 3d-4k , bluetooth and 5 hdmi in ) as well as the teufel consono 35 mk3 set ( 5 small boxes and a 150 watt downfire subwoofer ) . 
  because my living room isnt that big , i am against big/pillar speakers , even if i know they sound much better . 
  i would like to hear your thoughts on that or recommendations . 
  thank you very much in advance . 
  so i just got an denon 1200w 7.2 receiver and a 5.1 system . 
  with the denon avr app i can see that most of my sources only play over the fr and fl speaker . 
  now i understand that not all sources deliver the best they can . 
  what i got is :, 
  windows 10 over hdmi, 
  raspberrypi over hdmi, 
  xbox 360 over hdmi, 
  gamecube over video ( while this is not important ), 
  and tv over arc, 
  if i play amazon video over the tv for example it only gets to play in fl/fr setup . 
  i told the receiver to play it over dd+ds that all 5.1 speaker / subwoofer are used but usually the rears dont output much .
