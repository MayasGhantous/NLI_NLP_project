  dont push anything in there . 
  check why it couldnt work . 
  and remember where you put your screws . 
  except this there is pretty much nothing you can fuck up hard . 
  a small scratch or anything wont make something stop working . 
  oh and : take your time . 
  it may take longer than you think . 
  my last was 6 hours from building messing one part up and deconstructing and rebuilding . 
   because you posted 4 seconds earlier than / u/iamfreakshow, 
  tenthed, 
   contacts or bare eyes ? 
  sorry have to ask , what is the difference ? 
  like watching just in a direction or without blinking ? 
  well at least you can do it now . 
  i remember that video ( or at least something near ) . 
  watched it for 50 min but still cant beatbox ... 
  the next question is :, 
  can you ride your bike, 
  * handsfree, 
  * at night, 
  * without a light, 
  * drunk, 
  * and with sunglasses on, 
  * well i can *, 
  sorry but have to test this now :, 
  equals ? 
   almost, 
  yeah i will mount it at top at outtake then too . 
  thanks, 
  sorry that i have to ask on your litle problem but what happend with your motherboard that you couldnt use it further ? 
  cant tell from the picture or i just dont know what part that is that got broken . 
  thanks in advance . 
  2 times 6 +2 is the same as 2 times 8 pin - yes, 
  if it is using a y-cable or continuing on one cable then it runs of the same rail . 
  if it is the same gpu there is no problem with running both 6 +2 pins from the same cord to the 8 pin slots . 
  if there are 2 different graphic cards you might want to check how many rails your psu has and if they are different for the 2 ( if yours has 2 ) gpu cables . 
  if it has 2 different rails chose 2 different cables just to be on the safer side with your psu and damage prevention . 
  if not , chose how you like it . 
  ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ 100 % ^ ^ ^ sure, 
  for a more in depth information , what psu are you using ? 
  it is a decend psu absolutly do-able for your needs . 
  because it has physically only one rail it doesnt matter if you power your gpu with 1 or 2 cables . 
  just for the looks or if you use the ocp software you might use one virtuall rail for one cable to power both 8 pins . 
  that way you may install another one with another virtuall rail on the other cable but i am not sure what a benefit a virtual rail has . 
  tl ; dr : use like you want because it has only 1 12v rail . 
  smaller harddrives are designed for transport , often switching places or laptops and such . 
  3,5 '' are made for desktop computer . 
  the smaller ones ~ ~ need no additional power line but ~ ~ mostly dont have as much storage space as the 3,5 '' or are more expensive . 
  lastly i read that the 3,5 '' are faster but i would not buy that . 
  just check the informations about your choosen disk and compare . 
  because of the smaller build , with the same storage and speed they probably will be costlier then the 3,5 '' disks . 
  but i can safe $ 1,537.26 ( 67 % ) if i buy it now for only $ 772.74 :d, 
  well ... i fucked up , you are absolutely right . 
  i was thinking about something else because of this line i read :, 
  wich basically says what i wrote above . 
  dont trust the internet . 
  or at least think what you write . 
  fixed my earlier comment . 
  upvote for psych !, 
  what 's up ? 
  because i couldnt find any motherboard related to giga 3 motherboard , i must ask this way . 
  can you dismount both gpus and then run the system over the video port of the motherboard to test if it runs better ? 
  where do you get your drivers for your videocards ? 
  from nvidia ? 
  [ you may look here for shutting down the pc faster ] ( http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-taking-forever-shut-try/ ) but i am not sure how good that all will work . 
  what updates is it trying to do ? 
  if this all doesnt help may try to deinstall all drivers and reinstall . 
  * carefully *, 
  first of all like / u/dommy73 and / u/ck _ wd said , backup . 
  are you hearing any noises from the plate from time to time ? 
  have you changed anything in the last time ? 
  yes - check cable, 
  just interested , what productkey are you using ? 
  win 10 or 7/8 ? 
  is there a possibility to install from another usb ? 
  is csm / legacy boot enabled in the bios ? 
  [ maybe unrelated but you might try this solution ] ( http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-2227942/build-installation-create-system-partition-ssd.html ), 
  a picture of the port would be helpfull to see if it is still able to work or not . 
  you might always open the monitor and switch out that port but i guess that is mork work and can break more than it might fix . 
  well if the problem is not disk related and you are sure it is nothing with the temps then it is indeed a problem with your bios i would say, 
  i would say the 360 controller is quite a good choice . 
  the steam controller isnt out yes but it looks quite big too . 
  depends on where you bought it . 
  i just googled it and most say they deliver it ** without ** a power cord . 
  just there choice . 
  if your seller doesnt state that , maybe they have forgotten that . 
  they probably dont give one with it to safe some money on something most people have at home anyway . 
  my shop says 18.9 but it depends on where you wan na buy it , 
  why do you think he will get 18 ? 
  why are you wishing him happy birthday in advance * thats cruel *, 
  i guess you dont have a massive fan array in your pc build in and endless of usb devices . 
  i would say 500 watt sounds nice for your needs , i have nearly the same setup and 500 watt is working nicely . 
  for buying i am not the best help sadly but chose some big labels as they have ( most of the time ) high quality and good efficiency . 
  [ something like this might be good . 
  ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/power-supply/#x=0,10912&amp;r=5&amp;w=475,550&amp;sort=a4&amp;page=1&amp;e=4 ), 
  * defenitely check reviews of what you want to buy *, 
  i guess for that we would need a description of the parts you are going to build into it . 
  for one , check what motherboard is build in there and what type it is ( atx , micro atx ... ) then check the diameters with yours . 
  i guess the [ compaq tower looks like this ] ( http://www6.pcmag.com/media/images/103049-hp-compaq-presario-sr1550nx-tower.jpg?width=630 ) ? 
  then again it depends on what parts you are going to use in that case .
