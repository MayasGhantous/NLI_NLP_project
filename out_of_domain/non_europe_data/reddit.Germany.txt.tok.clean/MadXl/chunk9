  just remember that your case only supports gpu up to a length of 290mm . 
  if you dont want to overclock now , that is no problem but still with a `` k '' cpu and that cooler you will be defenetly able to in the future . 
  just remember to test , go small steps and read as much as possible about it . 
  about the fans , thats absolutly right  your case has allready one 140mm in the front and a 120mm on the side . 
  your choice with 2 80mm exhaust fans in the bag is good . 
  then again we take a look on your cooler and we see it is a radiator cooling ... 
  so you need to deinstall the side fan and mount your cooler there or put it in the front . 
  the power supply should be enough for now and even the future if you put in some more parts or start to overclock . 
  as far as i could see , the only difference is the amount of sata ports and / or ethernet ports . 
  msi : 4xsata , 2xethernet, 
  asrock : 6xsata , 1xpcie/msata , 1x mini pcie , 1xethernet, 
  might be that for some the msi might have been cheaper or only that avaible at that time . 
  it doesnt look like a big difference considering most dont use more that 3 sata anyway . 
  satae or pcie might be a thing to look at if you have use for it . 
  if not look at the price and the looks what you want to buy , 
  edit : if you dont need msata or pcie pick the msi one if it is cheaper at your place ( it is at mine ), 
  have you tested the different ram slots ? 
  just using one stick in the first ( most left ) ? 
  what speed is your ram , is your mobo compatible ? 
  all cables secured ? 
  especially the one for the fan . 
  i have read something about someone that needed much pressure to get the ram sticks in , are they really connected ? 
  btw : funny smell out of the mobo is never good . 
  edit : is the pc working without the new fan ? 
  second what / u/avatice said and if you can try to use a connection from your monitor to the motherboard without the gpu installed . 
  can your keyboard light up on your laptop while that is booting ? 
  my bad sorry just checked if the mobo has a port : s, 
  except some boards even have that one still preinstalled, 
  depends on what is in your `` gaming build '' . 
  this can go from a 500 watt psu to a 1200 one . 
  you may use a online calculator like [ this one ] ( http://powersupplycalculator.net/ ) . 
  it is really a matter of how many fans are in your case , additional lighting / energy consumtion parts , number of gpus and if you overclock or not . 
  awesome !, 
  whoops my bad , sry but then i cant help ... 
  i would suggest because you can test nor need the cpu right away , to send it back for a replacement . 
  it is safer for you and it shouldnt bother you . 
  if the cpu might have hit or something and it wont work later you have to do this step anyway , but then they might not always take it back . 
  just be safe if you have the option and time is what i would do . 
  self sleeving a 24 pin cable one by one or buying a 24 pin extension presleeved with the right colors ? 
  anything bad with extension cables ? 
  thanks , then i will i go that way once i have the money , 
  good idea and often mentioned but care to think about that it will not always work and mostly cost more but still better network connection than usb wlan . 
  if this :, 
   includes cpu cooler, 
  yes, 
  is stated then it has one . 
  still depends on where you buy it but as long as it isnt a wof ( without a fan ) it will probably have one . 
  edit : wof and tray come without cooler . 
  mostly they are with and the without cost more . 
   is there a way to tell if the motherboard i order will come with updated bios ? 
  not as far as i know but this is not the biggest problem . 
  it will probably have a relative new version and you can ( not must tho ) upgrade it later at any given time . 
  everything should work most of the time anyway . 
   build thoughts, 
  looks decent , depends on what you wanting to do with it . 
  your budget is around 430 ? 
  with the use of cat 5e or upwards any distance under 50m is no problem at all . 
  just look at the shielding if it is running near electronics and stuff . 
  * if you dont mind using cable of course *, 
  depends on what you want . 
  ssd ? 
  nvidia or better amd because of future proofing the dx12 ? 
  that case probably has not the best airflow / cooling, 
  we dont that psu . 
  maybe it will break soon . 
  the part of why building something yourself is , that you can build it how you want it . 
  you know about every part . 
  dont use cheap parts that might kill everything else . 
  do you need 2 tb space ? 
  you can even upgrade later . 
  is that case looking like you want ? 
  12 gb ram or better 8 with lower cas that we dont know too . 
  just things to think about . 
  well it showed not a big difference but still the difference is there because nvidia cards are built so they cant do the same . 
  same money same power but just another company . 
  depends on what you like more and even if it is not true an amd is still not bad in that way . 
  this is awesome . 
  love the complete white looks , sadly i had to put some red in that case and now it doesnt looks as good but yours is beatiful .

  i would consider this . 
  the fx-6300 is faster then the i3 you choose or the pentium mentioned above . 
  atx is most of the time if you dont need a small pc better for airflow and you could build in some additional fans later . 
  for memory i would take only 1 8gb stick so you can upgrade later easily and 1600 with 9 cas is nearly the same speed as your 10 cas 1866 . 
  that high speed only matters if you overclock in the future , what , btw , is possible with this cpu . 
  storage and gpu are great , i have put in a additional cpu cooler just because . 
  atx case with atx board . 
  power supply should always be at least 80 + bronze . 
  it is the most important part of the complete build and if you have some more spare money , invest it now in the psu .
