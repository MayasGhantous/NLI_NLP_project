  seems like our german sense of humor has rubbed off on you . 
  jiggly puff sounds more like a black american football defense player . 
  no it 's fucking not . 
  alaba is n't really product of their youth program though . 
  he played in their u19 squad for a year before he made his first team debut . 
  yeah , but it was implied that he had this great youth coaching at bayern , when actually he came very late in his progress . 
  it 's like saying that a hamburger is a salad because it has lettuce on it . 
  maybe germans are just less emotionally disturbed by death because we view it differently , and the family ties are a bit weaker here . 
  korean is basically three/two separate shapes/letters combined into one syllable . 
  much easier to distuingish than japanese and chinese because of that . 
  if you get m\u00fcller you 're so german you can play in the bundesliga . 
  it 's not like you did n't have it coming with your weird pronunciation of names . 
  / u/blubbey banging in 20k goals a season . 
  always rated him . 
  holy shit i 'm already bored by cricket three comments in . 
  mostly centerback . 
  okay , here 's how that works . 
  since noone around you cares about soccer and noone on the internet takes your opinion as an american seriously anyway , you might as well be completely shameless and go for broke . 
  here 's a list of teams with reasons to support them that your friends can nod their heads at and say `` yeah , i 've heard of them '' while actually getting to see decent soccer at the same time . 
  ** real madrid ** : you drive a koenigsegg , you only flush your toilet with a bottle of pellegrino and your girlfriend has a phd in hotness , because only the best is ever good enough for you . 
  ** fc barcelona ** : you drive a koenigsegg , you only flush your toilet with a bottle of pellegrino and your girlfriend has a phd in hotness , but you also donate to unicef so you 're actually one of the good guys . 
  ** manchester united ** : you have a gmail adress , you eat at mcdonalds and during election you wait to see who the winning party will be before you vote , because you think the masses ca n't be wrong . 
  ** bayern munich ** : you liked han solo in star wars , because even though he is a scoundrel and a smuggler , you know that deep down he gets the job done and is quite charming doing so . 
  ** mansour financial group ** : you like money and justify the huge allowance your dad pays you with the two times you mowed the lawn when you were 6 and twelve respectively . 
  * added bonus * : other than manchester city fc you can also support new york manchester city fc , which has the same colors , same sugar daddy and same lack of claim to anything significant . 
  ** chelsea fc ** : same as the above , except your dad drinks a lot more vodka . 
  ** arsenal fc ** : you 're happy your team is fourth , it was supposed to be a lot worse this year . 
  ** liverpool fc ** : you 're sad your team is fourth , it was supposed to be a lot better this year . 
  ** juventus ** : you 're the kind of person that edits the opposing teams to shit before you start your career in fifa , only so you can tell your friends you beat the serie a with legendary difficulty . 
  ** ac milan ** : you 're the person that 's surprised that gets shat on in fifa even though you used to beat your friend all the time until you realize that for some reason your team has a 2,5 star rating . 
  there are special rules for hipsters though . 
  * if you want to support a lesser known club , the easiest way to pick one is to choose the * local * ( not realistic , very important ! ), 
  rival of the least appealing team of the above list , eg : 1860 m\u00fcnchen for bayern munich , espanyol barcelona for fc barcelona , everton for liverpool , etc. 
  * many european clubs have copies in south american leagues . 
  instead of fc barcelona , why not support [ barcelona sporting club from ecuador ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barcelona_sporting_club ) ? 
  * if you want to prove how tough you and your sport are , why not go for some of the better teams from lesser known but rougher leagues ? 
  good old constantinople has been a hotbed for soccer violence in times of gentrification , spurred by the rivalries between besiktas , fenerbahce and galatasary . 
  if you have no interest in explaining to your friends that your latest interest in turkey has nothing to do with birds , you can always look to eastern european leagues . 
  with their amount of unknown brazilian players , lack of political correctness and general shadyness , ukraine etc. 
  are what turkish soccer was in the early ' 00s . 
  if you 're really hardcore , you 're going to support dnipro dnipropetrovsk and make every conversation about your hobbies and interests a real pain in the ass . 
  and noone would know the difference because everyone knows equally little while pretending to know equally much . 
  what is this, 
  i loved the work you did for every bild headline ever . 
  let 's wait for the results from the wind tunnel to decide that . 
  cf is just the spanish equivalent of fc . 
  counterstrike 's c9.n0thing on joe rogan 's podcast was a pretty good insight in twitch streamer revenues , albeit understandably basic . 
  it 's just basic marketing , and the same for every public person . 
  i would n't go so far to say `` it 's not right , '' since it 's well known that america is where the money is and , well , america speaks english . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gppfhl_g5mo ) it 's pretty long and i 'm at work so i ca n't check for the relevant parts . 
  e : they mention halfway through that this episode had the most concurrent viewers on ustream ever ( for his show ) . 
  do n't you dare ask us germans to start another war just because of your silly feud . 
  just like hitler : first he tried to take reign with force , and when it failed he did it the legal way . 
  i think if you put the eiffel tower anywhere other than the place it 's at right now people would realize that it 's really not much of a looker in broad daylight . 
  the fuck is a kiss man, 
  and if she keeps looking the way she does she wo n't hit 50 until she 's in her 70s . 
  instant english player value inflation , [ or ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/itrxkpy.gif ), 
   i suppose many germans think that the clubs in england are called in the same manner, 
  that 's the exact factoid he pointed out . 
  because aston villa sounds like a town in the first place . 
  and secondly , because europe has forgotten about aston villa for quite a while . 
  no , but aston does . 
  it could be something inverted like manchester united , or a latin version of something like luton town . 
  what happened to the kid, 
  that 's why i support morecambe . 
  might look like that for someone outside of germany . 
  but m\u00fcller is as bayern as it gets . 
  as long as it 's up to him , he 'll never move ( unless bayern decides to completely fuck him over for some reason ) . 
   barcelona can afford to pay higher wages, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2892/transfer-zone/2015/05/14/11740402/messi-neymar-or-suarez-could-leave-barcelona-over-wages-faus ) makes it sound like messi has a price while at the moment , m\u00fcller does n't . 
  a bid that would have been the biggest by a large margin that the bundesliga has ever seen , and got refused apparently instantly . 
  e : had you asked me the same question a year ago i would 've agreed that messi ca n't be bought , but i feel like there is so much going on at barcelona that makes it increasingly less comfortable for him stay . 
  in the end both will transfer to chelsea in a week and we 'll both look like total idiots . 
  he did n't say which route . 
  and there 's like three teams in the world who 'd pay his wages , nearly all of them direct rivals . 
  why do they have to be amateur ? 
  what would that fix ? 
  that building looks like the starship enterprise has crashed . 
  i was thinking of psg as the third . 
  i think real and barcelona are too smart to pay this much for someone his age without city 's and chelsea 's incentive of him being a homegrown player , even though both could pay him . 
  e : `` three teams '' was a hyperbole anyway . 
  that 's not at all the point you made . 
  i do n't know what reputation iranians have somewhere else , but most everyone i know with half a brain knows not to confuse the post-islamic revolution iranian government with its people that made persia the most advanced middle eastern country of its time . 
  the last being his rap career as chief o'keefe . 
  you did n't mention anything going amateur would fix . 
  all you mention are the ways amateur tournaments were crooked , and the clearly exploited ncaa players . 
  whose side are you on ? 
  the problem people have with qatar 's naturalizations is that they dish out passports and money just have foreign players play on their national team . 
  they scout other countries and continents for future qatari national players . 
  who said that only german cities are allowed du sauprei\u00df verdammter . 
  he still has n't cured cancer . 
  to be fair , there 's always that one mad tekkers dude on every sunday league club that has seen one too many joga bonito ads and thinks he 's hot shit because he can rabona into the ball bag from like 20 feet away . 
  it 's roughly a dozen 1990 linekers in terms of shit . 
  defender is confused !, 
  defender injured himself !, 
  looks like humphrey blowhard here finally learned some photoshop . 
  who the fuck is aly, 
  what 's she doing in this one then, 
  i have nothing else to look forward to since the accident,
