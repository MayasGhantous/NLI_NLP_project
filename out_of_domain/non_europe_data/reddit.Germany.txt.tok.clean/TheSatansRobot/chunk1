the test range is good to learn the controls . 
  but it does not replace experience in real games with enemys locking on to you . 
  sometimes i drop crates on camping snipers who do n't ptfo and sit on the map edges . 
  especially in rush when we should clearly do something to get the m-coms . 
  that ca n't be right . 
  you are supposed to get a `` premium paint '' today . 
  i opened my battlepack a few seconds ago and it had the `` havoc '' paint inside . 
  go here http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1z7719/official_reddit_platoons/ and get one of the extensions to see which of your platoon members are playing on what server . 
  here is proof that you get the level cap raise without premium or any of the dlcs :, 
  it 's just a random guy i found , who has n't premium or any of the dlcs but is level 110 . 
  when i looked at the requirements for phantom prospect i thouth maybe we have to do 200 jet kills for trainee . 
  thank god it 's only 20 !, 
  i 'm not the worst in jets , but i never would have manged to get 200 . 
  and we have russian server admins who kick you for not beeing from russia , despite having a ping of < 40 . 
   joining a high ticket tdm/sqdm sound after 100 kills should not trigger eor sound on clients . 
  this is missing in the official battlelog post : https://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2955064775933042305/, 
  this is happening to me after the patch , too . 
  and i think once i had it also with the v40 minis . 
  you can get the hats also from yacht club and `` make seamus sing shanties '' . 
  so there is no need for clams . 
  you always have a non clam option to get the items . 
  but it may take very long because of the drop rates . 
  i got only one item from clearing them . 
  it 's the code name of the game . 
  apperently this trailer was not supposed to be shown to the public . 
  it looks like a pitch video for ea . 
  i think this has something to do with the rating . 
  bayonetta is rated pegi 18 and bayonetta 2 is rated pegi 16 . 
  hence the special edition is also rated 18 . 
  unfortunately , to sell bayonetta as pegi 16 they have to exclude the first part . 
  so , i think we should be glad to get a special edition at all . 
  it will be triggered by peter once you are on part 4 of the enfant terrible questline . 
  you have to complete the enfant terrible pt . 
  6 quest . 
  this must be the logic of digital downloads these days : the hyrule warriors download with 10 % discount is 36 # and the retail version without discount on amazon is 32 # . 
  direct infos from tinoco are on facebook https://www.facebook.com/playfamilyguy or twitter https://twitter.com/playfamilyguy . 
  this is also a really good website : http://familyguyaddicts.com/, 
  thank you !, 
  i got the first one ( zelda ) . 
  tested the second one first , but it 's already been used . 
  the quest starts after you unlock peter 's ghostbusters costume . 
  i think they only spawn at streets now , like the stewies during comiccon event . 
  which should make it easy to build a maze . 
  actually you can use the upgraded versions . 
  the skulltula requirment is only for the weapon type and not the version . 
  to brew the three things in the cauldron you need in total :, 
  terror dog bones : 30 ;, 
  latcher talons : 15 ;, 
  candy corn : 50 ;, 
  spirit vials : 3000 ;, 
  you need to unlock him in three days to get the ghosbusters challenge prize ( nyc skyline ) . 
  added everyone so far . 
  my nnid : satansrobot, 
  south park already did it, 
  this sounds like mafia methods . 
  they will make him an offer he ca n't refuse ... 
  not available in germany : maybe your brother should n't use copyrighted music in his videos . 
  to your first question : yes , the promotion is available in europe . 
  yes , it ends on 31 . 
  december 2014 . 
  you will get 10 % back on the purchase price of your digital downloads ( games , dlc , ... ) . 
  you wo n't get anything for physical copies though !, 
  here is the link : https://p.nintendo.net/deluxe/, 
  hold on !, 
  this shit is fucking meta !, 
  i am watching this movie right now , casually browsing / r/funny on my phone , when this thread comes up at the exact same scene . 
  i 'm not pleased , if i have to be online to play the single player part . 
  my shitty connection does n't work from time to time . 
  btw the noob in these videos is the voice of simon and colonel 100, 
  you are correct , but that is not what i wrote . 
  i referred to the `` noob '' in the link posted by bigdawgwtf : bryan mahoney aka simon aka the colonel aka ammo guy aka game idiot aka drak . 
  of course , neebs ( the noob in bffs ) and simon are not the same person . 
  edit : spelling, 
  to become e.g. 
  an atlas author every member has to do a qualification year with technical work . 
  this work includes e.g. 
  detector construction , running and maintenance , writing technical software , taking shifts , some managerial tasks , but not physics analysis . 
  after finishing the qualification your are an atlas author until you leave atlas or spend less than 50 % of your research time on atlas . 
  your institute also has to do technical work in proportion to the number of authors . 
  you are not !, 
  if it 's under 700 $ the simplified calculation of charges is applied : flat rate of 17.5 % import tax on the product value ( including shiping costs ) . 
  only if the value is less than 22 $ you do n't have to pay import tax . 
  same for me, 
  read this : http://club2.nintendo.com/program-notice/, 
  `` 1/20/2015 products released after this date are not eligible for registration with club nintendo '', 
  i know smash bros was released before that date . 
  but maybe nintendo already stopped printing the codes , since today is the last day to register products . 
  yes , the trick still works . 
  but the room needs 10 hours to be built , instead of two before . 
   a few days later a guy on a hotwire server asked if anyone wanted to blowtorch his shield, 
  if you know what i mean , 
  the website says : `` signs marked as `` obsolete '' are being phased-out by 2019 . '', 
  which means you will still see some of these `` obsolete '' signs until 2019 . 
  i recently got my phd in atlas . 
  my original contribution was a large and important part in a certain analysis , that got published ( i also wrote parts of the publication myself ) . 
  in my thesis i basically wrote about the complete analysis ( also the parts i did not do by myself ) with emphasis on my original contribution . 
  furthermore , it is only possible to apply for away tickets until 17:00 cest today ( 24 . 
  april ) . 
  see ( in german ) : http://www.fcbayern.de/de/tickets/news/2015/vorverkauf-champions-league-ticket-info-aktuell.php, 
  this is not correct .
