there really was n't much devastation in germany during wwi . 
  i 'm sure it 's true that reddit is mostly white ( and male ) , but there 's another reason :, 
  it 's just not that easy to accidentally insult white people . 
  and i do n't mean this because `` whites are n't as easily offended '' ; there just are no words or expressions that are insulting to white people that you might use accidentally . 
  i 'm white , too - could anyone give me an example of something a black/asian/non-white person might say to me that i might mistake as an insult to white people even though they did n't mean it that way ? 
  there 's always love and support on the internet . 
  ( there 's also always hate and mockery , you just have to look in the right places ... ), 
  anyway : without knowing more about the background , i find it hard to give you any advice . 
  i do n't quite understand why most people here seem to think you should simply forget about her or treat her bad . 
  it 's a shame if she want 's to cut off an old friend for ridiculous reasons - but the best result would still be if you could fix it and hold on to that old friendship . 
  so , my advice : be nice to her , send her an answer to tell her you are sorry she feels that way , and try to contact her again in a few days when she might have realized her mistake . 
  ( caveat : i 've never met either of you , nor have i been in a similar situation , so you 'll have to judge for yourself if this advice is worth anything . ), 
  if all fails - well , you 'll make new friends quick enough . 
  but before that , it 's nice trying to keep the old ones . 
  another chemist here . 
  despite the mistakes , i think you know all you really need to know about this stuff . 
  as long as you do n't believe yourself ( or claim ) to be an expert about this , it 's fine . 
  i 'm sure i have some ideas about political science that would sound ridiculous to you , and posci is n't really less important than physics , it 's just different . 
  on the internet , i think it 's easy to get the impression that somehow all atheists have to be at least part-time physicists . 
  in the real world , you can also be an atheist if you 're a lawyer , a dancer , a construction worker or even a political science major without detailed knowledge about astronomy . 
  well , in this case , the criticism does n't apply , because the original post was explicitly directed at him . 
  [ sorry if you wanted to read this and ca n't . 
  but i 'm pretty certain down here in this thread it 's only germans talking to each other . ], 
  i trust everyone knows the bible in catspeak already ?

  on the contrary . 
  using your numbers , we can be absolutely sure that there has n't ever been a `` duplicated deck '' . 
  you are talking about ~ 700 billion ( 7 x 10 ^ 11 ) different deck orders . 
  there are ( if you 'd look at fry 's number again ) roughly 8 x 10 ^ 68 possible orders . 
  that means that less than one in 10 ^ 57 of all possible orders has been used so far . 
  try this at some party to find out if people aggree with you :, 
  - `` i know the exact order in which this 52 cards are by heart . '', 
  - `` ok , so which one comes first ? '', 
  i do n't know ... '', 
  since it has n't been proven yet that this really was an argument from ignorance , we can be absolutely certain that it was actually an argument from authority . 
  not exactly a loophole , but i guess a cool feature of the german law that does n't exist in other countries :, 
  in germany , if you order anything on the internet , you can simply send it back within two weeks and get your money back . 
  you do n't need to state any reasons , you do n't even need to pay for postal charges - it 's much better than shopping offline . 
  and i 'm not talking about one companies goodwill - you can do this anywhere . 
  [ or is that the same elsewhere ? ], 
  as one of the poor redditors having been lead into watching dozens of fight-related youtube videos by this thread , this is the one i like best :, 
  kickbox world champion ( working as a bouncer ) teaches loudmouth a leason . 
  it 's definetely worth watching , even if you do n't like violent videos or think you 've seen them all . 
  very surprising and inspiring ... 
  just say `` alles gute '' . 
  ( anything with `` herzlich '' or `` gl\u00fcckwunsch '' just adds difficulty unneccessarily . ), 
  i just tried google translate ( gt ) english -  german with a few examples . 
  the pronounciation is good , the only problem is that gt assumes you 're talking to adults . 
  so e.g. 
  [ fun side note : gt does n't translate `` happy birthday '' at all . 
  that 's ok , because we do for instance often sing the song in english ; but it then pronounces `` happy birthday '' the way a german only would if they had never seen an english word before . ], 
  i think you should n't worry about it too much . 
  it 's a fascinating experience for children to meet adults who do n't speak their language . 
  if you talk to them in english , they will probably listen carefully ( without understanding anything ) and also watch carefully what you are doing - that should often help you most in arts & crafts . 
  just as `` the great '' is `` die gro\u00dfe '' when talking , for instance , about catherine the great . 
  `` romney had the popular vote '' - no , he did n't . 
  this is the internet . 
  popular vote, 
  barack obama 61,170,405, 
  btw , some states already have laws in effect that they will award all their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote * if * enough other states will do the same . 
  enough = majority of electors, 
  sadly , this will never happen . 
  [ weird sentence , either way . ], 
  ~ ~ ich stehe am haltestelle . ~ ~ ( i am at the bus stop . ), 
  it 's certainly more polite than `` ich will ... ! '', 
  personally , i do n't feel like `` ich m\u00f6chte ... '' would be impolite when ordering in a restaurant , at all . 
  although i would at least more commonly use `` ich h\u00e4tte gern ... '', 
  in most cases , though , i think i 'd actually just say `` f\u00fcr mich bitte ... '' . 
  it 's not even a complete sentence , but i still never felt impolite for ordering like that . 
  my mother loves telling the story how a friend of hers from the us yelled `` frollein , ketchup ! '', 
  through a german restaurant - he still got away with that . 
  depending on the pronounciation , that can easily sound a little silly to me . 
  ( `` some day i want to have a pony just for me ! '' ), 
  when ordering in a restaurant , it 's usually clear that you want whatever you ordered only once , so there 's no need for the `` einmal '' . 
  i 'd only use it when e.g. 
  once again , political correctness to the rescue !, 
  that 's how you 'd write it . 
  in restaurants , i 'd more or less pronounce it as `` frollein '' . 
  ( i 'm not sure if i 'd ever really use it , though . 
  maybe when i 'm a little tipsy . ), 
  i think you 're off ; but not by that much . 
  `` sein '' is used for verbs describing motion . 
  when you use those verbs transitively , they are not really describing motion anymore , and that 's the point . 
  `` ich habe im urlaub einen porsche gefahren '' , `` ich habe die neuen schuhe eingelaufen '' , maybe even `` ich habe mal einen marathon gelaufen '' ( borderline case in my ears ) - in those cases , what you were doing was n't really getting from a to b. 
  when `` fahren '' is used to describe a means of transportation , use it with `` sein '' , when it 's used to describe an activity , use it with `` haben '' . 
  edit : i 'm still trying to find a good example to show that this does n't always mean that the verb will also be transitive . 
  ( not transitive , but an activity rather than a means of travel ) versus `` ich bin mal 200 meter weit getaucht . '', 
  edit2 : maybe it works the other way round - `` ich bin im sommer motorrad gefahren '' is transitive , but still uses `` sein '' , because riding the motorcycle was n't really your way of getting anywhere , it 's just your hobby . 
  ( although it does n't really `` feel '' transitive , it 's more like the intransitive verb `` motorrad fahren '' . 
  also : `` ich bin von london nach hamburg gerudert . '', 
  edit3 : one nice aspect of this motion criterion is that it even works in some rather absurd cases . 
  dancing for instance is usually an activity and not a way of moving around . 
  but when you 're a little drunk and silly , this dialogue might work : `` es ist mitten in der nacht !, 
  if i may ask , do you believe in asuras , devas , and pretas ? 
  [ yep , i just learned about these from wikipedia . 
  i 'm mostly asking to check if you 're buddhist only in the same way in which i 'm protestant - i just sometimes like calling myself that and feel somewhat more connected to protestants than to catholics ( or jews , muslims , ... ) , but i do n't really believe any of it . ], 
  the ck -  kk rule actually is outdated . 
  knacken would be kna-cken or knack-en now . 
  ( i 'd still write knak-ken myself . 
  but that 's because i 'm kinda outdated , too . ),
