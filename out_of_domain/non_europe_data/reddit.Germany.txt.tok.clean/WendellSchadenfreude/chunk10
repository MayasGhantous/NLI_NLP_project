  the former if you are asking in general ( more likely `` which countries '' , plural ) , the latter only if you are asking about one specific trip that the other person just talked about . 
  [ so , i feel like the latter only makes sense if the last words out of the other person 's mouth were `` so , i just came back from my trip to a european country '' - quite a weird thing to say ... ], 
  the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms , with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children, 
  it 's a great story , but i still believe the old professor would have been happier if his colleague had brought evidence to * prove * his theory . 
  [ inb4 `` you ca n't prove a theory '' - you * do * know what i mean . ], 
  the old professor deserves enormous respect , of course . 
  he demonstrates impressively how a good scientist has to adapt his views in face of new evidence , instead of denying the evidence to preserve any pet theories . 
  a good scientist has to be willing to do this - but he does n't have to be happy about it . 
  my sister always makes fun of me for using `` dort '' , and somehow she 's right : people usually do n't do that . 
  it 's mostly me and the deutsche bahn . 
  on a sidenote , i think `` dort '' instead of `` da '' is still more common in northern germany . 
  but this is really more of a gut feeling . 
   kudos to you . 
  i teach middle school grammar and literature and a few years ago i decided to quit correcting other adult 's grammar . 
   a person 's use of language is a reflection of many things , not just intelligence . 
  i realized that by paying attention to the mechanics of their message , i was loosing the message . 
   i also realized what a total asshole i looked like correcting another adult 's grammar . 
   this is not to say that your mistakes go unnoticed . 
  i just do n't have to point them out to you to make myself feel better . 
  actually , germans would n't do that either . 
  it 's just 311484626 . 
  if you feel like you must use seperating signs , netego 's version is acceptable . 
  in switzerland , you would write 311 ' 484 ' 626 instead . 
  [ communist party usa ] ( http://www.cpusa.org/ ), 
  me neither , but let 's just assume he is n't . 
  why did you heretics make * two * of him ? 
  there is only * one * fsm !, 
  national philosopher , poet and spiritual father of pakistan, 
  lived here in 1907 . 
  this plaque was revealed by the minister for culture/education of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg in the presence of the pakistani ambassador and the mayor of heidelberg . 
  [ so the long paragraph is only boring bureaucratic talk . 
  i shortened it a little . ], 
  do n't know where that is ; never heard of iqbal before . 
  no , except when you count `` living on in other peoples ' thoughts/hearts / ... 
  yes , i wish death was n't the end of all things . 
  but i guess i wish the afterlife also would n't be eternal . 
  so , instead of an afterlife , i think i 'd rather choose living for , say , 500 years . 
  dying when you 're kind of tired of life ; that sounds best . 
  i 'm not even sue which version sounds better to me . 
  i 'd generally use `` fangt an mit ... '' because it avoids confusion . 
  looking this up will likely lead you to gnosticism , which is not what devilsadvocate was talking about . 
  gnostic/agnostic basically means ( at least , as used by the majority on / r/atheism ) how much knowledge/certainty you claim about the existence of god . 
  this means there would be gnostic theists ( `` i know that god exists . 
  '' ) , agnostic theists ( `` i 'm not 100 % sure that god exists , but i think so and i believe in him . 
  '' ) , agnostic atheists ( `` i do n't believe in any god . 
  there might be a god , but i do n't think so . '' ), 
  and finally , gnostic atheists . 
  ( `` i know there is no god ; i 'm absolutely certain of this . '' ), 
  the `` gnostic atheists '' part is why i do n't like this way of using the word ; because i do n't think gnostic atheists actually exist . 
   to him , maybe it 's a small part . 
  for us as we are now the thought of spending billions of years to make a universe seems ... tedious . 
  given eternity , spending a few billion years creating adam does n't seem like a big deal anymore , of course . 
  i have to admit , though , that this theory slightly amuses me . 
  the reason is that i do n't see what god is actually * doing * . 
  evolution is what simply has to happen to self-reproducing cells over long periods of time ; and humans or human-like creatues are a possible outcome of this process . 
  given that almost every species that ever existed is extinct today , there does n't seem to be any guidance or direction in this process . 
  god is n't needed to explain this , so if he exists , it seems like all he did was watch . 
  ( not to say that this is impossible . 
  an omniscient god at least would already have known billions of years ago that evolution would result in humans eventually , so he might just not have seen the need to interfere ... still , it sounds weird to me . ), 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperativ_%28modus%29#weitere_ersatzformen_des_imperativs ) lists five alternative to the actual imperative for giving orders in german . 
  this infinitive version is really pretty common , and i think it already was during wwii . 
  for you , that 's handy , because it avoids any du/ihr/sie confusion . 
  in stressful situations ( such as combat ) , i think this is the version that germans would use almost exclusively . 
  also , it sounds quite soldier-ly . 
  [ for instance , from your above examples : i think `` in position bleiben ! '', 
  sounds much more like a military command than `` bleibt in position ! '' . 
  both work , though . ], 
  europ\u00e4ische union is written with capital e & capital u. 
  [ now try pronouncing it !, 
  an interesting and complicated question is how to correctly say that she 's the first female chancellor . 
  `` die erste weibliche kanzlerin '' is kind of non-sensical , because every `` kanzlerin '' is female . 
  because that 's an address ( = eine anrede ) . 
  of course it does . 
   if that 's not singular , nothing is, 
  nothing * are * . 
  scnr . 
  `` to predominately consist of '', 
  there you go , split infinitive . 
  it 's not enough to simply split ^ ( see what i did there ? ), 
  * something * , that thing must also be an infinitive . 
  since your question has been answered , may i now point out that you 're using a * quotation * , not a `` quote '' ? 
  brilliant . 
  finally a part worthy of david . 
  to be fair , he put all that in italics , so he probably thought it was clear he was quoting someone . 
  how old are you , if i may ask ? 
   ... particularly when it 's the response that you get from a question or statement . 
  so , this would be the relevant `` eben '' then :, 
   eben can also imply agreement , the idea that a statement is , precisely or exactly the point . 
  -- eben !, 
   ( that is really a long article . 
  -- precisely ! ), 
  i think `` precisely '' is a good translation here . 
  i just want to add that `` eben '' also has a little `` see , * that 's * the problem '' , `` i told you ... '' or even `` duh !, 
  deine oma is sooo cool . 
  the pope * can * teach [ ex cathedra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex_cathedra#ex_cathedra ) , which means every catholic has to follow his teachings . 
  the only position thaught this way is , iirc , the virgin conception , or something like that . 
  one of the good thing about being right is this :, 
  evolution is true , wether your friend * believes * in it or not . 
  thus , you can stay friends even if the poor guy insists on believing ridiculous nonsense - just do n't push him too hard and too often . 
  without thinking about this , just a wild guess off the top of my head :,
