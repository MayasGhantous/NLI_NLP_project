  assuming no inbreeding , every descendant of pocahontas had 2 ^ 16 ~ 65,000 ancestors who were alive at the same time as pocahontas . 
  [ the assumption that there was no inbreeding is completely ridiculous , by the way . 
  but you are still the descendant of more than just 2 people who lived 400 years ago . ], 
  edit : the point i am trying to make is that there 's nothing special about pocahontas and john rolfe . 
  as a european , i can say almost with certainty that i 'm a descendant of charlemagne - i just ca n't tell you the exact lineage . 
  but i 'm also a descendant of almost all of charlemagne 's european contemporaries , except those who have no living descendants at all . 
  i simply accepted this number of 14 million without asking where it came from ; but i still do n't think it 's an unrealistic number . 
  as i said , 2.8 is the number of children you 'd need * who have children of their own * . 
  because of inbreeding , that number would have had to be higher in reality so that you could have 14 million descendants today - but 2.8 children is n't really all that many to begin with . 
  choosing a completely different approach : without inbreeding , you should have some 2 ^ 16 ancestors who lived around that time , that 's ~ 65,000 . 
  so if all your ancestors had been perfectly average * and * the world population had n't changed , every one of them would also have 65,000 descendants living today . 
  but the world population did change , it 's about 13 times as high as [ it was in 1600 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_population_estimates ) - that alone means that every one of your ancestors who lived in 1600 should have some 850,000 living descendants . 
  more importantly though , your ancestors probably were n't `` average '' - europeans who emigrated to the americas had a vastly higher reproductive success during the past 400 years than most of the world 's population . 
  ( the world population around 1600 for instance still includes tens of millions of native americans who , sadly , in their majority died shortly after without much living offspring . ), 
  cool . 
  16 was just my guess for the number of generations since pocahontas , it 's nice to have this confirmed . 
  and yeah , that 's where the sixteenth root comes from . 
  it 's good that we all agree on this . 
  could be replicated * where * ? 
  for anyone wondering : the pope thinks this actually means * status civitatis vaticanae * , `` vatican city state '' . 
   i realize the german people may not like her, 
  she 's actually the most popular politician in germany , and has been almost consistently for years . 
  as an example , this poll from march 2014 : [ 72 % say that they want angela merkel to play an important part in german politics in the future . 
  ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/169582/umfrage/beliebtheit-von-politikern-in-deutschland/ ) it was big news when she was only the most * second-most * popular politician for a moment this february . 
  ] ( http://www.absolventa.de/jobs/channel/chemie/thema/chemieingenieur-gehalt ), 
  there 's good money in chemistry . 
  if op really is a graduating as a chemical engineer , 45k is still a good starting wage , but not an unrealistic one . 
  and it 's for the entire war . 
  ( well , the portion of the war that the eigth air participated in , anyway . ), 
  the infantry that fought on omaha beach fought in lots of other battles after that one as well , so their overall death rate must have been higher . 
  absolventa.de disagrees . 
  38.000 euro . 
  '' ) , while in reality the phd is basically the standard degree for german chemists . 
  of course , the chemists who * actually * use chemistry are mostly not chemists with a diploma/master 's degree , but lab technicians ; and they are certainly paid less . 
  some are . 
  and they might very well [ be right about it ] ( http://perc.org/articles/everyone-calm-down-there-no-bee-pocalypse ) . 
  if you have no time to read the article , only look at [ this graph ] ( http://eclectecon.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ecbb69a883301901e7c6017970b-pi ) showing the number of commercially used honey bee colonies in the us . 
  the bee colony death rate * decreases * from 30.5 % last year to 23.2 % this year , and your conclusion is that `` our planet is dying '' ? 
  talk about scaremongering ... 
  i 'm not sure if you 're aware of this , but the tactic of digging tunnels underneath enemy positions to blow them up is still used nowadays . 
  [ here 's an example from syria ; happened * yesterday * . 
  ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/syrian-rebels-blow-army-base-major-hit-assad-article-1.1793271 ), 
  i think your chances at a good job are much better if you stay in health care . 
  the supply for english tutors in germany far exceeds the demand . 
  if you can ( legally ) work as a krankenschwester in germany , you should definitely at least give this a shot . 
  should you find that they only let you do menial work at a horrible pay , you can still find a different job . 
  i imagine this will be much easier from a position of employment . 
  ( nurses in germany do n't go to university , but they are still quite respected . 
  nobody thinks of their education as `` basic '' . 
  - of course , i know nothing about medicine , so i ca n't compare it to the education of an american np . ), 
  i guess they mostly use russian . 
  [ here 's a homepage ] ( http://www.russische-kirche-l.de/l-adressen.htm ) listing many russian-orthodox churches in germany . 
  of the ~ 50 churches , * one * has a note saying `` services exclusively in german '' . 
  i guess this means that all the other churches listed use at least some russian . 
  english ist the * most * common non-native language in france . 
  spanish is second . 
  german is third . 
  yeah , but the map you linked is `` second/third most widely spoken * first * language '' , while the map in this thread is `` most ( and second - / third-most ) widely spoken * second * language '' . 
   what you do is just take every single piece of land in the entire country, 
  no need to do that , you already get all the land when you only occupy the capital holding in every county . 
  i think even that is wasting time , but it certainly makes the post-war period easier . 
  i do n't get it . 
  ah ... thanks . 
  yep . 
  i 'd so insist on a paternity test after seeing this . 
  to be sure , if will is the father , i 'd still want to keep the child . 
  i 'd just want to know . 
  ( i 'm white , so i might know even without a test . 
  but you can never be too certain . ), 
  [ for those confused ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gmerfuzrnz4#t=94 ), 
  you 're underestimating `` these days '' . 
  as just one example , himym also has season 6 , episode 13 , `` bad news '' . 
  i do n't want to spoil this episode in case you 've never seen it and still want to - but otherwise , [ here 's the ending . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-8dy_q4zke ) ( in kind of weird quality and mirrored , but good enough . ), 
  `` nowadays '' has * scrubs * , which has a bunch of moments like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rirpllybys ) or [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy2spq1yk70 ) . 
  there are good comedy series now just as there were good comedy series in the 90 's . 
  and most good comedy series have a few `` dark '' episodes from time to time - i do n't think this has changed much over the past 20 years . 
  but it tastes * oh so good * . 
  mind giving us some pointers as to what kind of dirt you are talking about ? 
  [ cern ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cern ) , the world 's largest particle physics lab . 
  it might even be interesting for them , although i suppose they would treat it like some kind of museum . 
  but either way , it shows mankind in a good light : peaceful , scientific , cooperative , inquisitive . 
  sounds like a good move . 
  i get `` have it your way '' - but what 's funny about peachtrees ? 
  this thread is terrible for non-native speakers . 
  by far the most common is `` schatz '' , for both genders . 
  literally `` treasure '' . 
  ( this , by the way , is also what gollum calls the ring in german : ` my precious ' = `` mein schatz '' . ), 
  no , it was already under siege before that . 
  for a long time , both the hospital and the prison were under siege at the same time . 
  ah ... so this is not a wordplay at all , just ingenuity at its finest . 
   and the event triggered assassinations in afghanistan that day, 
  who was assassinated , by whom ? 
  i never heard this before , and i find it difficult to google it . 
  between spain and morocco , there should be a tiny gap for the straits of gibraltar - if you cross these , you 'd actually hit the shore of algeria . 
  fun fact : due west of gibraltar is almost exactly famous roanoke island . 
  could you do the same thing for the old world only ? 
  that is : what asian countries would be due west of europe and africa , if the americas ( and possibly australia ) did n't exist ? 
  looking at maps like this , it always seems incredible that these tiny countries uganda , rwanda , and burundi could hold for long even against the dr congo alone . 
  but uganda has some 35 million people , rwanda and burundi some 10 million each .
