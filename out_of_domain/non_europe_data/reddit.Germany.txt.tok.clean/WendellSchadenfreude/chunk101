  that 's ~ 55 million people , against congo 's ~ 70 million . 
  interesting . 
  this would depend on the sea levels , of course . 
  quick google search finds claims that greenland would turn into a group of [ some big ( and many small ) islands ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9j9xawh.png ) , or into [ one weird ring-island with some big lakes ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/topographic_map_of_greenland_bedrock.jpg ) in the center . 
  nope , gibraltar itself is completely [ hidden behind spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9z5usxn.png ) . 
  but [ granada is inland ... ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/granada ), 
  at university , you can be almost certain that everybody will speak standard german , with only a slight accent depending on the region . 
  where in germany will you be going ? 
  nice try . 
  adidas , allianz , basf . 
  kindi hospital has been completely demolished , so nobody really holds it anymore . 
   nice of the duchess to do the work for me , she 's a gonner . 
  do you people really play this * mean * ? 
  if this were my game , the duchess would receive a high honorary title , all her de jure lands ( if she did n't hold these already ) , and additional titles for all her unlanded children ( except the main heir ) . 
  many children have that . 
  it 's weird how all parents jump to `` you 'll already be dead by then '' . 
  the obvious reassuring answer is : this wo n't happen for billions of years , so we still have plenty of time to build spaceships and get out of here . 
  this map is crap . 
  you can look at it all you want , you 're not getting any valuable information from it . 
  spending money on a bmw that you ca n't really afford is a poor allocation of resources as well . 
  sure , some people need to get a car that is almost too expensive for them so that they impress the right people and further their career - that car might even pay for itself in the long run . 
  but most people who buy cars that they ca n't really afford simply lack self control or basic economic skills . 
  pretending to be something you 're not can work , if you do it right . 
  but if all you do is spend money on outer appearances , your money is wasted - and the people you 're trying to impress the most will know it . 
  for comparison : [ germany ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/26uvmo/german_stadiums_with_over_60000_capacity_420x563/ ), 
   it certainly has made the early game a lot harder, 
  it still a lot easier than it used to be when you could n't simply borrow money from the jews . 
  i wish they would completely rework these loans . 
  certainly not worth it , unless you want to do it for the fun of it . 
  india is part of the free patch that came with roi , not part of the dlc . 
  for comparison with our special friends : [ map showing all dutch stadiums with over 60,000 capacity .

  if you have to take one of these , `` tr\u00e4ume '' is the only version that sounds a little less weird than all the others . 
  it can be the imperative form of dream ( `` close your eyes and ** dream ** !, 
  '' ) , or it can simply be the plural - * dreams * . 
  still , i do n't think this works well . 
  if you want to make it really german , go with a compound word . 
  `` lebenstraum '' for instance would be the dream of a lifetime . 
  or go with `` lebenstr\u00e4ume '' if you really want the umlaut - * lifetime dreams * , or in other words : bucket list . 
  that does n't work . 
  since the students are suggesting an alternative ( `` b '' ) , the teacher ca n't simply say `` doch '' . 
  `` doch '' usually is n't a filler word at all . 
  it 's usually an emphatic `` yes '' that can only be used to reject a negative statement made by someone else . 
  typically , you already said something before and they disagreed with you . 
  or without the first statement : `` women ca n't be president in the us . '', 
  `` doch '' can be used as a kind-of filler word . 
  in these cases , it just gives some extra emphasis to the sentences . 
  ( `` aber ja doch '' is a nice expression of heartfelt approval . 
  no , that would be second future at sundawn . 
  `` ja '' can also be used as a modifier . 
  in your first example , it signifies that this should n't be new information to you - your boss is n't making this appointment now , but refering to an earlier mention of this meeting . 
  `` da bist du ja '' - i think i ca n't translate that without hearing it . 
  it could easily mean anything between `` what a coincidence - we were just talking about you , and there you are ! '', 
  and `` there you are , * finally * . '', 
  since we 're sharing trivia : x-ray radiation is also [ somewhat visible ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x-ray#visibility ) . 
  it is however unclear how exactly that works - one explanation is that x-rays induce phosphorescence in the liquid in your eyeball which is then detected normally - so you do n't actually see the source of the radiation , you * see your own eye * . 
  experiments on this are n't conducted anymore because of the high doses of radiation involved . 
  buy beer and be happy . 
  smoking sucks . 
   i played leon today , but my brothers killed me in 20 minutes ... 
  if i remember correctly , your brothers are also your heirs , so you just keep playing as one of them . 
  it 's not cleos in the show , it 's [ alton lannister ] ( http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/alton_lannister ) . 
  just in case anyone is wondering : this is not an effective way to play the game . 
  i 'm sure op knew what he was doing and enjoyed this game , so it 's not `` bad '' at all , but if you want to have an easier time , simply stop building stuff . 
  how did this happen ? 
  - took over the ere and mended the schism , thus turning catholics and cathars alike into orthodox heretics . 
  some time later , my court chaplain converted to cathar , and he quite convinced me of the truth of this new belief . 
  i converted most dukes in the realm , and the rest is history . 
  hardly . 
  there 's a bunch of small eastern european countries that i 'm at peace with at the moment even though we do n't have a truce . 
  - it 's disgusting . 
  in my defense , when the current wave of wars started , the screen was filled all the way to the left edge with little pictures of my victims . 
  ( only one of them , the silly sunni caliph , actually attacked * me * rather than the other way ` round . ), 
  once you 've recreated rome and have some 20k retinues , the rest is really just mopping up , so there 's no reason to be at peace with anyone . 
  fighting 20 + wars simultaneously at least sometimes makes it, 
  interesting , because you have to run against the clock . 
  this hits me rather unexpected . 
  i even stated the obvious myself , that if you enjoy playing like this , you 're doing the right thing - i 'm not telling anyone how they should spend their video gaming time . 
  but in a board frequented by lots and lots of newbies , i find it helpful to point out when decisions are n't made for strategic reasons , but simply for the hell of it . 
  [ i think cpt picard explains this better than any of us ever could ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lauihbaxbxy ), 
  buildings and new holdings have an extremely low return on investment . 
  when you build a new castle town , you need decades before you at least break even - that is , until you got the money back that you originally spent . 
  instead of building 2 new buildings , you can usually hire a mercenary company and conquer * at least * one province . 
  that province contains ~ 3 holdings with ~ 30 buildings - buildings stuff yourself is * never * going to beat that . 
  ( just try it . 
  in your next game , do n't build anything . 
  spend ~ 90 % of your money on mercenaries and retinues , the rest one gifts , events , and such . 
  maximum one assassination per decade . 
  do this until you get bored because conquering is so easy . 
  - btw , do n't send mercenaries home if you still have money to pay them as long as there are neighbours left to attack . ), 
  a nice cup of strong , black coffee , dude . 
  like , really nice and strong and black , hrmmmrm . 
  you know , nice and black and strong . 
  just , hmm , how i like it . 
  ber ist almost entirely a * political * project , as are the other projects listed in the article . 
  no shareholders involved , only politicians . 
   once you have a reasonably sized realm , money becomes more important . 
  as such you should be building cities in the provinces that you control . 
  building cities is * wasting * money .
