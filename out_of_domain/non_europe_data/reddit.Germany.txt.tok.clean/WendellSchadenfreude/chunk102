  only do it if you want to build a city because you want to build a city . 
  if you want to have much money , conquer other people 's cities instead of building new ones . 
   after you have revoked those , try holding as many baronies in your capital as possible , without going over your demesne limit . 
  i still doubt that an additional barony in your capital county can ever compete with an entire additional county . 
  oh , i do . 
  i do n't use all of them , and i certainly do n't use them all the time . 
  but when you are fighting 20 wars at the same time , why not let the levies of a few dukes/kings handle one of the smaller enemies ? 
  i find this graph very interesting , but clearly it has no place in a subreddit for * beautiful * data . 
  it 's ugly , crude , and impossible to understand . 
  sending out applications is depressing as hell . 
  i think i never managed more than ~ 10 per month . 
  could have written many more , of course , but it did n't make much sense since there were n't more open positions that fit my qualifications . 
  what 's your situation ? 
  yes , that 's acceptable . 
  the alternative is also fine . 
  coins * are * money . 
  sure . 
  [ here ] ( http://kottke.org/13/10/world-war-ii-in-7-minutes ) for instance . 
  yes , the 50 % is just an average , the real percentage can be higher or lower . 
  also , we 're using `` 50 % '' as a shorthand for `` the 99.99 % + that all humans share , and then some 50 % of the rest '' . 
  eastwatch and the shadow tower are still manned , the castles ( roughly ) at the eastern and western end of the wall . 
  \\* [ national * democratic * party of germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democratic_party_of_germany ) - at least , that 's what they call themselves . 
  i have no idea what they actually did in this study , but for a start , [ here 's wikipedia 's explanation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iodine-xenon_dating#meteorite_age_dating ) how xenon dating works in meteorites . 
  it 's actually iodine-xenon dating . 
  iodine has a radioactive isotope ( ^ 129 i ) that decays relatively quickly , on a cosmological scale : it 's half-life is 15.7 million years . 
  this isotope ( if i understand correctly ) is not normally formed in stars , only in supernovae . 
  cosmic bodies ( such as meteorites or planets ) that formed only a short time after a supernova can trap a lot of this iodine isotope . 
  bodies that are formed later can trap much less , because most of it has already decayed . 
  today , virtually all of this iodine isotope has decayed , but where there was a lot of it , there now is a lot of it 's xenon decay product ^ 129 xe . 
  if we find a lot of this xenon isotope in a rock , we know that this rock was formed shortly after a supernova . 
  before that collision , both earth and theia were still far too young for life to have begun . 
  the collision happened less than 100 million years after the formation of the solar system . 
  the xenon would have been the least problem - it was n't really a `` xenon atmosphere '' , it should mostly have been hydrogen and helium , with some xenon in it . 
  the heat and the lack of water should have made life impossible even if there had been enough time . 
  not exactly . 
  hitler was * appointed * as chancellor ( reichskanzler ) by the president ( reichspr\u00e4sident ) von hindenburg ; he was not elected by the parliament ( reichstag ) nor by the people directly . 
  in the last election before that , hitler 's nsdap had become the strongest party , but clearly fell short of a majority [ at 33 % of the vote ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_november_1932 ) . 
  even after hitler had become chancellor , his party [ got `` only '' 44 % of the vote ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_march_1933 ) in an election that was already overshadowed by state-run terror . 
  i 'm german ; we always used mx + c , just as the map says . 
  by offering reddit a chance to `` ask her anything '' , this # 2 winningest jeopardy contestant missed her chance to do an `` answer me anything '' instead , where people would have given her answers and she would have posted the corresponding questions . 
  why does auto-moderator insist that my answer has to contain a question mark ? 
  who is julia collins ? 
  bishopric or city : nope , he never takes those himself . 
  if he still has a castle , you can take all his holdings ( starting with cities and churches ) one by one . 
  you can find the how to in any of about 500 threads in this subreddit . 
  but it 's not a horrible name , it might easily become popular again in a few years . 
  when i hear `` karl ... '' , my brain would be torn between adding [ '' ... may '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_may ) or [ '' ... der gro\u00dfe '' ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_der_gro%c3%9fe ) . 
  the only karl i know personally was a teacher of mine , should be ~ 70 years old now . 
  just write a message to the steam support explaining this . 
  they do n't have to give you your money back , of course , but steam is often remarkably generous . 
  yeah , paradox * ca n't * do anything about this - you bought the game from steam , not pdx . 
  let us know how it goes . 
  people give you the standard answer : taking $ 2000 from someone who only earns $ 10,000 per year is quite harsh , taking $ 200,000 from someone who makes $ 1,000,000 is not . 
  in every suggestion for a flat percentage tax that i 've ever heard , a tax free amount was included , e.g. 
  you do n't pay any tax on the first $ 20,000 you make each year . 
  you pay a flat percentage on everything beyond that , which still results in different effective tax rates for different incomes . 
  it 's possible . 
  maybe need to close and restart the game , that 's sometimes necessary with succession bugs .

  ok , ok : murder his vassal baron until the pope inherits the barony - while the game is paused , of course , because he 'll give it away the very next day . 
  declare war for one of his holdings , but take all the cities and churches first !, 
  repeat until he only has a barony left , then take that one , too . 
  when you 're done , form rome , learn to use the search function , and message the mods about stickying this question . 
  if the pope already has no baron vassals left , you 're out of luck . 
  this answer is incorrect . 
   when you press someone 's claim like that, 
  he did n't press , the vassal * inherited * . 
  that 's the crucial difference . 
  when someone * inherits * a title higher than his highest current title from outside your realm , they leave your realm . 
  when you * press a claim * for one of your vassal 's , it does n't matter wether the pressed title is higher than their current ones - they will always stay your vassal ( unless the new title is at least the same level as ** your own ** highest title . ), 
  you 're an emperor : invite claimant , grant some land , * press claim * for kingdom , and the entire kingdom becomes vassalized . 
  ( alternatively , you can invite the claimant , grant him * a kingdom * , and then hope for his older brother to die . 
  if a vassal king inherits another kingdom , he remains your vassal . ), 
  yes , yes , you have to wait . 
  unless , of course , you 're really lucky and the pope suddenly dies ... they are usually old men , nobody would suspect a thing . 
  did you take away your own upvote from your post ? 
  very humble ...

  i like medium . 
  keeps your vassals happy enough , but allows revokation of infidel titels . 
  as byzantium , strong vassals are less of a problem - just make sure none/few of them are kings , and you can revoke duchies any time a superduke emerges . 
  if he only has mayors and bishops left , you ca n't take these . 
  you can assassinate these guys as often as you want , the pope will never take these holdings himself . 
  poland can not into rome . 
  confusing data , an ugly graph , most of the data is n't readable at all ( there has got to be some color coding in there , but i ca n't find it ) , the captions are nonsense ( negative prices , negative variances ... ) - this has got to be one of the ugliest contributions i 've seen on this subreddit . 
  can anyone who upvoted this tell me what they thought was * beautiful * about this ? 
  this graph will be very interesting as the show progresses . 
  i believe most of the * feast * column will stay empty forever . 
  the book was mostly characters running around doing nothing , which has been radically cut short for the show . 
  [ please keep this spoiler free . 
  by the way , op : when posting anything got related , i 'd recommend putting some comment about the existence of spoilers in the title , just to make people happy . 
  in this case , everyone can look at the graph , so it 's `` no spoilers '' . ], 
   with the regime change in libya , there is no nation with a single colored flag .
