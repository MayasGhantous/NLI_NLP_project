  interesting , i did not know they changed the flag . 
  i can tell you red is the most popular color by far , but i 'd also be interested in a more detailed breakdown . 
  and now i realize why the chart did n't contain the names of book chapters that have n't been used in the show yet . 
  the chart does n't give away to show watchers wether there 's still more bran/jon/dany chapters later in * dance * ( after the point already reached by the show ) . 
  it only shows there 's there 's some character named `` mercy '' in * winds of winter * . 
  [ i know who that is , but i 'm not telling . 
  very nicely done by whoever made that chart . 
  of course , if you want to avoid spoilers completely , you 'd better stay off the internet or at least far from any place where got is being discussed . 
  but i think you can look at this chart as long as you want , it 's not gon na ruin anyone 's fun . 
  if i had an apartment for rent , the thing i 'd be most worried about is that you might just leave soon . 
  if you do , i have to find new tenants again , i risk a few months of vacancy again , and i also risk that you might just leave without paying the last few months of rent . 
  ( i 'm sure you would n't do that , but your potential landlord ca n't know that . 
  if you one day just pack up your stuff and move abroad , getting his money would be next to impossible or at least * very * tedious . ), 
  if you plan to stay in germany for several more years at least ( or permanently ) , that 's something i would emphasize a lot every time you get a chance to talk to a landlord . 
  in my opinion , regencies still are n't nearly dangerous enough . 
  they should already start out with an automatic reduction of crown authority , and a high chance of relatives or powerful vassals just * taking * some of your titles , inheritance laws be damned . 
  but whiny newbies feel this game is too mean to them , and they downvote you for it because they do n't understand the meaning of the word `` opinion '' . 
  when a powerful ai declares war on you and takes all the lands you hold in an entire kingdom , that 's also an obstacle thrown at you through no fault of your own . 
  when your genius heir dies . 
  when the vikings raid your lands while your armies are fighting elsewhere . 
  all of this is `` unfair '' , and some players certainly think it 's `` unfun '' . 
  i happen to think that regencies are n't nearly dangerous enough for a player . 
  so you had bad luck once , and the consequences are ... well , actually pretty minor . 
  it 's not like this happens in * every * regency , and the game is much more interesting because bad things * can * happen to you . 
  deal with it . 
   you make it sound intentional , when in reality it is sloppy coding . 
  ... it * might * be sloppy coding . 
  or it might be working as intended . 
  if they ever change this , i hope they at least make regencies more dangerous in general . 
  ( in fact , i hope they make regencies more dangerous without changing this particular mechanism . ), 
  no way you would notice that on this chart . 
  measles could affect a few anti-vaxxers today , but more than 90 % of the population are vaccinated , which gives some protection even to those who are n't . 
  the graph goes up to almost 3,000 cases per 100,000 people - nowadays , there are [ a few hundred cases per year ] ( http://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/centers-for-disease-control-news-120/vaccine-coverage-high-in-u-s-but-measles-a-concern-cdc-680153.html ) - not per 100,000 people , but for the entire us !, 
  it 's an honour to be a bonner . 
  there 's a very active ( half-international ) group on meetup.com , `` bonn social '' . 
  if you want to find people do go hiking , drinking , playing , singing with , that 's a good place to start . 
  without more information about yourself , we ca n't really tell you much . 
  how old are you , where are you from , what will you be doing in bonn , how long will you be staying ? 
  [ here you go ... ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=windturbine+wald&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ro-ju9xwkjog7aa9l4gyag&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=887 ), 
  now fix it without the silly ~ ~ durchstreichen ~ ~ . 
  this just makes it hard to read and confusing , and nobody cares about the `` historical truth '' of this having been misspelled at some point . 
  my god , that 's a great post . 
  king vassals get -25 opinion , but that 's it . 
  there is no additional penalty for having several king vassals , so it 's easily manageable . 
  it 's so appropriate that it is n't even a gif !, 
  you do n't need to drink hydrochloric acid , [ it 's already in your stomach . 
  i would n't recommend drinking isopropanol , but it 's commonly [ used as hand sanitizer . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isopropanol#medical ), 
  ethylene glycol certainly is toxic , although it ( or the very similar diethylene glycol ) has been used ( illegally ) as a wine sweetener . 
  if you 're old enough and live in germany , you may in fact [ have ordered diethylene glycol in a restaurant . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_diethylene_glycol_wine_scandal ) ( do n't get me wrong : it 's toxic , you 're not supposed to drink it !, 
  but why would you * drink * industrial chemicals anyway ? ), 
   that sounds like something that would come directly from the mouth of a us republican or an oil lobbyist . 
  uh , fun !, 
  that sounds like something that would come directly from the mouth of a retarded hippie or joseph stalin himself . 
  are we done now , or do you think derisive comparisons are actually helpful ? 
  do n't write co \u00b2 . 
  if you ca n't use a subscript , `` co2 '' is fine . 
  if fracking has already had horrible consequences `` many times '' , point out these accidents instead of just throwing out some scary sounding names . 
  chemicals are n't dangerous just because they are n't safe to drink . 
  you ca n't drink battery acid , gasoline , or engine oil , yet cars are usually safe . 
  because that 's exactly what the laws would say ... 9.9, 
   chemicals are n't dangerous just because they are n't safe to drink . 
  you ca n't drink battery acid , gasoline , or engine oil , yet cars are usually safe . 
  i 'm concerned about corporations risking damage to the environment or people so i must be a hippie or a fascist . 
  you started this . 
  because i 'm not fundamentally opposed to fracking , i must be a `` us republican or an oil lobbyist '' . 
  - there are people who simply are n't scared of everything `` chemical '' , without getting paid for it . 
  you know that fracking is mostly a technology to extract chemicals from * out of the ground * , right ? 
  chemicals that have been there for millions of years . 
  if those get extracted and a tiny percentage of them gets replaced with hand sanitizer , i do n't see why i should be particularly worried . 
   i thought there 's been knowledge of the connection between certain pesticides and the devastating colony collapse disorder for at least a few months, 
  there have been * claims * , but there 's nothing substantiated . 
  look at [ this recent paper for more information .

   there have been marked increases in overwintering, 
  mortality of managed honey bee populations in recent decades . 
  it has been suggested that insecticides ( particularly neonicotinoids ) may be wholly or partly responsible . 
  the weak evidence base can not at present resolve this question although honeybee declines began, 
  before the wide use of neonicotinoids and there is poor, 
  geographical correlation between neonicotinoid use and, 
  honeybee decline . 
  two studies using different, 
  structured methodologies have explored this question . 
  used ` hill 's epidemiological `` causality criteria ''' and concluded that the evidence base did not currently support a role for dietary neonicotinoids in honeybee decline but that, 
  this conclusion should be seen as provisional . 
   ( b ) staveley et al. 
  used ` causal analysis ' methodology and concluded that neonicotinoids were ` unlikely ' to be the sole cause of honeybee decline but could be a contributing factor . 
  science is n't as fast as you may think or wish . 
  but do n't worry , neither is ccd [ even nearly as threatening or urgent as most people here seem to believe ] ( http://www.google.de/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2feclectecon.typepad.com%2f.a%2f6a00e54ecbb69a883301901e7c6017970b-pi&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eclectecon.net%2f2013%2f07%2fbees-is-bee-magedon-upon-us.html&amp;h=376&amp;w=591&amp;tbnid=zleewal8utsqpm%3a&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=rar5qxpaeevf2m&amp;ei=jmwlu56jbaip0axfjibo&amp;tbm=isch&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=164&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=41&amp;ved=0ccaqrqmwaa ) .
