  how so ? 
  it ends in 2007 ... 
  comparing the situation to 1950 is n't very useful . 
  beehives today are moved from one field to another much more than they used to be back then , so you need fewer . 
  a graph going further back only shows that modern agriculture needs fewer bee hives , mostly because they get moved around more often . 
  the fact that there were fewer hives used in 1990 than in 1950 does n't have anything to do with ccd . 
  i draw conclusions much more from [ this article ] ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1786/20140558.full.pdf+html ) . 
  ( pdf , proceedings of the royal society b , 2014 ), 
  in short : yep , ccd should be researched . 
  neonicotinoids might play a role in it . 
  but reddit used to run for the pitchforks when bees are mentioned , and people pretend that the collapse of the american agriculture was imminent . 
  german here . 
  what am i looking at ? 
   although the law says you ca n't go this fast, 
  the law does n't say that . 
  unlimited means unlimited , you * are * allowed to drive that fast . 
  ( as long as your car , the traffic around you , and other constraints allow you to do it safely , which could be disputed in the linked gif . ), 
  how do you get to a `` remaining 15 % '' ? 
  it 's more than 60 % of the autobahn that have * no speed limit * . 
  yes , yes , non-enforceable recommended maximum speed that you can call a `` limit '' if you really want to . 
  [ map from your own link , blue means no speed limit . ] ( http://www.autobahnatlas-online.de/limitkarte.pdf ) . 
  on all the blue parts , you 're * allowed * to drive 200 mph ( or more ) as long as you can safely do so . 
  the weather does n't need to be great , only dry . 
  i 've read the books and watched the show , but how does this happen in the board game ? 
  interesting map . 
  i think it would be an improvement if every state got a number indicating what percentage of the ppulation follows this second largest religion . 
  - might be anywhere from < < 1 % to almost 50 % . 
   in case the gender does not express meaning , why have n't people just started using a singular article , like `` das '' for everything ? 
  because that sounds horrible . 
  and there is really no incentive to doing so , because remembering the gender of words takes no effort at all for native germans . 
  for learners , i think it 's easiest to learn the gender with the word every single time from the very beginning . 
  `` house '' in german is not `` haus '' , it 's '' * das * haus '' - learn all vocabulary like that, 
  please do n't put the words `` newborn child '' and `` dropped '' so close to each other ; it makes me uncomfortable . 
   vassal kings take a further -30 opinion penalty . 
  not that it matters , but i think it 's -25 . 
   as was pointed out , classic research may take too damn long . 
  yeah , at the current rate , if we just wait for five more years , the [ number of bee colonies in the us would have dropped by roughly ** zero ** percent !,

  so who funds you independently ? 
  could you easily find one or two of these studies ? 
  neonicotinoids are ( meant to be ) used only on seeds ? 
  does that also mean they are used several months before bees can begin to collect the ( corresponding ) pollen ? 
  ah , you doing the thing where you ask me to be calm so that it looks like i 'm not calm no matter what i reply . 
  very clever . 
  i am , however , not the one calling for immediate drastic action . 
  talk to the hordes in this thread who have their pitchforks out and insist that all pesticides need to be banned yesterday . 
  i 'm glad to let the scientists have their discussion . 
  [ part of the discussion is this recent ( 2014 ) article that i 've linked several times . 
  ] ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1786/20140558.full.pdf+html ) ( free , pdf ), 
   there have been marked increases in overwintering mortality of managed honey bee populations in recent decades . 
  it has been suggested that insecticides ( particularly neonicotinoids ) may be wholly or partly responsible . 
  the weak evidence base can not at present resolve this question although honeybee declines began before the wide use of neonicotinoids and there is poor geographical correlation between neonicotinoid use and honeybee decline . 
  two studies using different structured methodologies have explored this question . 
  used ` hill 's epidemiological `` causality criteria ''' and concluded that the evidence base did not currently support a role for dietary neonicotinoids in honeybee decline but that this conclusion should be seen as provisional . 
   ( b ) staveley et al. 
  used ` causal analysis ' methodology and concluded that neonicotinoids were ` unlikely ' to be the sole cause of honeybee decline but could be a contributing factor . 
  ( by the way , i * am * a scientist . 
  even an environmental chemist , so if you define `` the field '' broadly , then i actually * am * a scientist in the field . ), 
   as the ancient greeks already noted : sola dosis facit venenum . 
  why did the ancient greeks speak latin ? 
  and how on earth did they manage to [ quote 15th century german physicians ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dose_makes_the_poison ), 
  i 'm kidding , mostly . 
  i 'm sure aristotle wrote something similar somewhere . 
  - thank you for the links . 
  good objection in general , but i do n't think anybody counts the workers . 
  if the queen survives , enough workers must have survived to keep the queen alive . 
  to my knowledge , when we discuss the effect of neonicotinoids on bees , we 're not worried about the effect they might have on individual workers , we 're only worried about their possible contribution to the sudden and complete collapse of entire colonies . 
  ( ccd = [ colony collapse disorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colony_collapse_disorder ) ),

  anyone know why the people from el salvador are so concentrated ? 
  i ca n't imagine them being a large group overall , so apparently all of them move them maryland and virginia . 
  [ not a rhetorical question ], 
  how do you think turkey will react to such a move ? 
  a few years ago , i 'm sure they would have invaded the new country without hesitation - now i have no idea . 
  just to make sure this does n't confuse anyone : north is near the bottom in this map . 
  it 's not a sentence at all , it does n't mean anything . 
  if * shlampe * is * schlampe * , it means `` slut with me '' . 
  but * schlampe * ca n't be used as a verb , so it does n't make sense . 
  in many western cities , the government has repeatedly offered truces and amnesties to the fsa rebels , and they have been accepted in homs and several damascus suburbs . 
  is there a similar offer for deir ez-zor ?
