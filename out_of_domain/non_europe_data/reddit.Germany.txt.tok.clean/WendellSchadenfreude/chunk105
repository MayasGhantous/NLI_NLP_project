  it seems like the fsa in deir will shortly only have the choice wether to surrender to isis or to the government ... 
  if white 's bishop takes that pawn , the black king takes the bishop , and there is no immediate ckeckmate . 
   however , based on the position , assuming black 's king and rook have n't moved , the only possible previous move for black must have been a pawn move . 
  this is possible , as he could have moved g2 as his final move . 
  could his last move also have been g6 , the other pawn on the g line ? ), 
  and if so , would this affect the analysis ? 
  i think it might , because that means the pawn on g2 might have come there by capturing ( e.g. 
  the light-square bishop ) from f3 , before the white pawns moved to f3 and e4 . 
  it 's probably possible to prove that this did n't happen , but i could n't find the proof . 
  i 'll have another try at an explanation for people who know the rules of chess but do n't understand what wiithepiiple is even talking about . 
  at first glance , this chess problem just looks relatively boring . 
  this is not a realistic position to ever encounter in an actual game of chess , and white does n't need to win in two moves - he is clearly winning , and who cares wether it takes two moves or four ? 
  but if you simply accept this as a chess problem and try to answer the question , finding the mate in two is n't all that difficult : you move your queen to d6 . 
  no normal move can save black now , your next move is checkmate either with the queen or with the knight . 
  - ** except ** ( ! ), 
  [ and * this * is where the problem gets ** interesting ** ] * if * black is still allowed to castle . 
  castling wo n't really save him in the long run , but it will prevent a mate in two . 
  castling is allowed in chess problems unless stated otherwise . 
  so that would mean that there is * no * mate in two moves for white , because black will castle after qd6 . 
  what the gilded comment does is prove that there is * no way * how the situation shown in the picture could * possibly * have been reached without black moving his king - but if the king already moved ( and then of course moved back to his original position ) , castling is not allowed and qd6 * is * mate in two . 
  a good starting point for the analysis is that there are two black pawns on the g-line . 
  one of them must have gotten there somehow !, 
  it ca n't be the pawn from the d - , e - , or f-line , because these are all still in place , so it must be the pawn that started on the c-line . 
  to get to the g-line , it must have captured 4 white pieces - but that seems impossible , because white has only lost 3 pieces ( a rook , a knight , and a bishop ) . 
  - i 'm gon na stop here , wiithepiiple explains the rest . 
  that 's how * normal * chess problems work . 
  this problem is different - the first task is to figure out what the * actual * problem is . 
  the interesting question is not `` how can white win '' , it 's `` is black still allowed to castle ? '', 
  in other words : is there any possible way how this situation could have been reached without black having moved either his rook or his king ( or both ) at least once ? 
  the gilded comment proves that this is * impossible * , that castling is thus not allowed and that thus there really is a mate in two ( starting with qd6 ) . 
  the rule a losing player would make up on the spot is actually [ capturing * en passant * . 
  `` i 'm allowed to capture your pieces on squares that they are n't even standing on !, 
  i even have a fancy name for it ! '', 
  ah , of course . 
  i knew i was missing something obvious ... 
  since i have you here , just another quick question - you stated that, 
   therefore , black must have moved his king, 
  but from your explanation , black might also have moved to rook instead , right ? 
  this does n't change the fact that he 's not allowed to castle , of course . 
  chess really has very few `` special '' rules . 
  the pawns are allowed to double-move if they have n't moved before - this is just to speed the game up a little , barely feels like a special move . 
  castling in two directions . 
  promoting a pawn . 
  well , and capturing * en passant * . 
  done . 
  you now know all `` special '' moves in chess . 
  just make sure you also know about [ stalemate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate ) . 
  just to be clear : it is * not * used anymore ; using it today would not be more respectful than `` sie '' anymore . 
  `` ihr '' as a respectful address is used to simulate medieval german . 
  in english , you would be using `` thou '' and `` thee '' that way . 
  ( in both cases , it does n't matter much that the result is probably not a very realistic representation of the medieval language . ), 
  what 's remarkable about that guy ? 
  he looks like a pretty normal character . 
  so he 's a genius * and * an idiot . 
  it 's a little late to get out of this , while your armies are already fighting . 
  because his name is `` hammer '' ? 
  i 'm underwhelmed . 
  let me try this ... 
  `` butthole '', 
  i still do n't get it at all . 
  why would verdun end after line one ? 
  is it something with pronouncing it like the french words for `` verse one '' ? 
  and why does nero have no words ?

  since he already shows up ( with zero votes ) , he is definetely eligible . 
  you probably just need to restart the game . 
  ( `` have you tried turning it off and on again ? '' ), 
  you can sort the candidate list by age , by the way .

  you need to wait until about 1000 ad ( i forgot if it 's one specific year ) . 
  that 's when christian mission in the east/north became important in reality , and the pagans in ck2 are programmed to rarely convert before that . 
  you risk an early game over due to a little bad luck and the unexpected death ( by disease , accident , event , ... ) of your firstborn son . 
  just make sure you pay some attention to your younger children as well . 
  * never * allow for them to have ambitious educators !, 
  chose content tutors if possible . 
  if your younger son is content , he is likely to get along just fine with your future heir . 
  and if you heir dies , you still have sons to fall back to . 
  i do n't think so . 
  you are allowed to give your children chinese names in the us or europe - but you do have to use western characters to write them , e.g. 
  `` wei '' instead of '' \u4f1f '' . 
  this is not the same as prohibiting chinese names - you just have to write them in a name that westerners ( including government officials ) can read them . 
   pope francis is an educated guy - a jesuit - and i 'm gon na assume he does n't actually believe in exorcism, 
  i think it sadly does n't work like that . 
  there are many highly educated people who believe all kinds of nonsense . 
  you do n't say ... 
  if this `` kill list '' had only one name on it , baghdadi would probably be it . 
  your link lacks a right parenthesis . 
  no need to shout . 
  i do n't think there 's an easy way to `` turn children gay '' . 
  but if there were , i 'd try for my children to * not * be gay . 
  mostly because i want grandchildren , and that 's just easier when your kids are straight . 
   a world-weary workman 's wife went, 
  very nice translation . 
  pseudo-medieval german . 
  when talking to a lord , you call him `` ihr '' ( as if he was more than one person ) . 
  when talking to a king , you might either do the same or use even more absurd forms ; similar to english . 
  less common : when talking to someone far beneath you ( some stablehand perhaps ) , you might address him as `` er '' . 
  none of this is done anymore today , and i guess there never was a time when this was * actually * correct .
