  it 's very similar to how americans will use `` thou '' and `` thine '' when they want to sound vaguely `` medieval '' . 
  it 's somewhat silly , but using the modern polite form `` sie '' would completely ruin the immersion in a series such as got . 
  for those who do n't get it : these guys are english . 
  they still wear their english jerseys , but otherwise seem to support germany now - and for this outrage , they blame the english head coach , roy hodgson . 
  small nit-pick :, 
  the medal was n't * presented * on the kaiser 's 100th birthday . 
  it 's a medal that was * established * on that occasion . 
  ( for comparison : the purple heart was established by washington , but you might be awarded with it today . ), 
  kompagnie landwehr-uebungs-bataillon der fu\u00dfartillerie ii . 
  roughly :, 
  by the order of his majesty the king and emperor ,, 
  this medal , established by his most excellent self , cast from the bronze of captured cannons and commemorative of the 100th birthday of the great emperor wilhelm i. , is awarded to, 
  gunner f.m. 
  accompanied by this very certificate . 
  lipinski , lieutnant colonel and commander of the regiment, 
  so , it 's a certificate for a medal that was awarded to michael haede . 
  does n't say what it was awarded for , also does n't give a date . 
  ( sometime after 1897 , of course . ), 
  by the way , wilhelm i. had been dead since 1888 , the emperor in 1897 ( and until 1918 ) was wilhelm ii. , his grandson . 
  to be fair , it looks more like `` lipinoki '' to me - but * lipinski * is a much more likely name . 
  more importantly , seewolfmk had already translated the signature - i only had to confirm his idea . 
  you should repost this as a top-level comment to make shure op sees it . 
  [ the article even exists in english , damn .

  a very similar statue still exists in [ koblenz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koblenz ) . 
  [ here 's a nice picture of it .

  i 've had some thirty to fourty couchsurfers who stayed at my place , for one night or up to one week . 
  some of them were boring , some of them were n't as tidy as i would have hoped , but none of them were creepy in any way . 
  most of them were fine , interesting people , and i 'm glad i hosted them . 
  [ strictly speaking , the question did n't address me , since i have so far only hosted people but have n't couchsurfed myself . 
  i do n't care , my answer is still a valuable contribution . ], 
  i 'm not kicking anyone out because they 're boring ; i 'm merely reporting my worst experience so far : boring guests . 
  it 's not a shocking experience , and i think i made it clear enough that i 'm overall very happy with my guest . 
  but yeah , you are staying at my place for free , you get a shower and at least some breakfast - you might be a decent person and at least try to be pleasant company . 
  always , as long as you are an emperor . 
  if you are only a king , the pope ca n't be your vassal , even if he is related to you . 
   i have 3/4 of the counties in the duchy , but his capital is in the one i do n't have , so i 'm wondering if that 's why ? 
  that 's why . 
   if it 's referring to a group of people , yes , it 's outdated . 
  i guess you meant `` unless '' , not `` if '' . 
  using `` ihr '' / `` euch '' for groups of people is still normal , using it for individuals is not . 
  ( '' \u00d6hi '' is a name from * heidi * , so she is talking to one person only in this paragraph . ), 
  it 's archaic . 
  calling a person `` ihr '' ( as if that person were a group of people ) was a respectful address in some places and times . 
  nowadays , it 's only used in role-play gaming and such , as fake-medieval german . 
  that still means that it 's * more * outdated if it 's * not * referring to a group of people but to one single person . 
  but you are right , i should have written `` ihr '' / `` euch '' , no capital letters . 
   some groups have personal goals ( i.e kurds gain greater independence if government falls [ ... ] ), 
  i really do n't think you can include the kurds with the other rebel groups in a discussion like this . 
  why outsiders would support ( or at least : cheer for ) the kurds seems obvious to me . 
  for all other rebel groups , i ca n't understand it either . 
  i 'm confused - are you saying it 's still used in bern , or just that is used to be used there as well ? 
  there is one feature in the german language that most germans are n't even aware of but that ( i was told ) contributes to the perception of german being a `` harsh '' language : [ the glottal stop ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glottal_stop ) or [ * stimmloser glottaler plosiv * ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/stimmloser_glottaler_plosiv ) . 
  swiss german does n't use this sound , and it 's perceived by germans as being much more melodic than standard german . 
  wikipedia has a few examples where you can hear the difference relatively clearly , for instance the words `` mein auto '' : in swiss german , this is pronounced like * mei nauto * - in standard german , even when you speak very fast , the word `` auto '' starts with a glottal stop . 
  [ i do n't think this is * the * reason why german is a harsh language , i just think it contributes . 
  german also uses more consonants and has no problem with consonant clusters , two features which we also perceive as harsh in other languages . ], 
  * the alchemist * is n't bad . 
  it 's a nice little story - it just does n't have as much depth as many people claim . 
  ( or maybe i just do n't see it . ), 
  i think * the alchemist * is somewhat similar to * the little prince * - i liked both of them , but that 's it . 
  i actually think less of people who name either of these as their favorite book and enthusiastically claim that it contains some sort of philosophial revelation . 
  '' \u00dcber '' is n't usually used as a modifier in german at all . 
  when in doubt , go with `` sehr '' . 
  ( that makes your speach a bit boring , but you can change that later by switching from `` sehr gl\u00fccklich '' to `` euphorisch '' and from `` sehr traurig '' to `` zu tode betr\u00fcbt '' . ), 
  last names where invented to help distinguish between different people , obviously . 
  if you have ten `` johns '' in your village , they need last names . 
  the reason that `` farmer '' is n't the most common last name by a huge margin is that the profession was * too * common . 
  if you 're lucky , one of your `` johns '' might have been a baker and one a smith , so you call them john baker and john smith - but you ca n't call all the rest of them `` john farmer '' , that would n't help at all . 
  so you have to call these guys `` john tall '' , `` john little '' , `` john johnson '' ( because his father 's name was john as well ) , `` john jackson '' ( guess why ... ) , `` john peterson '' , `` john brown '' ( color of his hair maybe ) , `` john king '' ( because his great-grandfather once delivered turnips to the king 's steward ) , ... 
  pretty certain the text is exaggerating the role of the tail . 
  smartereveryday has [ an awesome video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtwbpyjjqru ) explaining how cats always land on their feet - many people believe that they manage to do so thanks to their tails , but cats without a tail can actually still do it just fine . 
  the tail helps , but it 's not the most important part . 
  i believe this is very similar to the cheetah turning quickly . 
  the explanation that every village had a smith because all tools that could n't be made from wood had to be made from iron is n't good enough ? 
  this explanation has the advantage of also explaining why there are so many millers and bakers : every ( larger ) village had one mill and one bakery . 
  that 's rare enough to be used as a differentiator - i.e. 
  a last name - , but common enough to be a * common * last name . 
  the surname database explains other common surnames in a similarly fancyful fashion . 
  a `` baker '' was `` an official with special responsibilities for the baking ovens in a monastery or castle , as well as the keeper of the ` communal kitchen ' in a town or village , since most of the humbler households had no cooking facilities other than a pot over a fire . 
  the right to be in charge of this service and to exact money or loaves in return for its use , was in many parts of britain , a hereditary feudal privilege . 
  less often the surname may have been acquired by someone noted for specifically baking fine bread or as an owner of a kiln for the baking of pottery or even bricks . '', 
  `` large '' is `` a nickname for a generous person deriving from the middle english , old french ` large ' meaning ` generous ' , ` free ' , from the latin ` largus ' ` abundant ' . '', 
  nonsense !, 
  this site just tries to tell people what they want to hear : that they are connected through their last name to interesting and important people . 
  bakers were bakers , smiths were smiths , larges were tall or fat . 
  convergent evolution usually yields the same rough results , but from differing starting points . 
  the eyes of a squid are superfiscially very similar to those of a human , but when you look closely , you can clearly see that one did n't evolve from the other because - there are fundamental differences . 
  this wishbone thing is rather the opposite : modern birds do n't look much like dinosaurs , but they still have `` the same skeleton '' - or , well , they share this one bone at least . 
  but we know that birds are descended from dinosaurs because we 've found several of the species in between . 
  the most famous is certainly the [ archaeopteryx ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaeopteryx ) , but there are many others , like [ this little guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:iberomesornis-model.jpg ) - is n't he adorable ? 
  the only reasonable objection i know comes from xkcd : [ birds are n't * descended * from dinosaurs , they * are * dinosaurs .
