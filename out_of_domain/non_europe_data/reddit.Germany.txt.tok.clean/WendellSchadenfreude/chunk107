  it 's a set phrase . 
  breaking it down further does n't really make sense .

   what do you think about homosexuality ? 
  is it permissible ? 
  why or why not ? 
  sexual acts are permissible if all participants consent . 
  as long as all participants in homosexual acts are consenting adults , it is thus permissible . 
  i do n't get why you want to answer the question in the context of evolution at all . 
  contraception certainly is `` bad '' if all you are concerned with is producing healthy offspring - but it 's certainly permissible , because it does n't harm anyone . 
  if you could prove to me that humans did not evolve but must have been created , my views on homosexuality would n't change . 
  adults having consensual sex with each other does n't affect me unless i 'm one of them . 
  if two guys want to have sex with each other , i do n't care about this any more or less than i care about a guy and a girl wanting to have sex with each other - of course it 's `` permissible '' as long as all participants consent . 
  as a minor sidenote , talking about the evolutionary effects of aids does n't make any sense , because aids has only been around for some 60 years . 
  it has n't had a chance to affect the human genom in any relevant way . 
  by the way , would your view on homosexuality and its `` permissibility '' change if we were to find a simple cure for aids tomorrow ? 
  there is no more fsa/green presence east of the euphrates . 
  i 'm not sure if there is still any in the city center of deir ez-zor , but the eastern shore is completely in isis ' hands . 
  from all we know : yes . 
  this is where they tell the reader the state of our knowledge * before * the study . 
  the next sentence starts the explanation of their own work :, 
   ** we examined ** the effects of temperature acclimation on bat , energy balance and substrate metabolism in a prospective crossover study of 4-month duration , consisting of 4 consecutive blocks of 1-month overnight temperature acclimation [ 24 \u00b0 c ( month 1 ) \u2192 19 \u00b0 c ( month 2 ) \u2192 24 \u00b0 c ( month 3 ) \u2192 27 \u00b0 c ( month 4 ) ] of ** five healthy men ** in a temperature-controlled research facility . 
  so yeah - there 's a lot you can say against this study , but it * was * done on humans . 
  - `` who can call themselves ` fork lift operators ' . '', 
  if you 're playing for efficiency , about 80 % of your money should go to mercenaries and retinues . 
  the rest is mostly gifts/bribes and events . 
  or , for the same money , you can hire a mercenary company and conquer your neighbour 's land . 
  instead of upgrading * one * holding , you just got 3-4 new holdings . 
  i hope you are already playing with arumba 's keyboard mod . 
  combination of right-clicks and hotkeys allows you to bribe people at insane rates . 
  do it now . 
  never look back . 
  playing ck2 without keyboard hotkeys feels astonishingly tedious once you 've experienced what it * should * feel like . 
   3-4 new holdings that could 've been used to land people who can make claims . 
  3-4 holdings that you can still use to land people . 
  conquered holdings do n't go away either , you can keep them for the rest of the game . 
  mercs are gone when you release them , but you do n't * have to * release them as soon as a war ends , you can simply start another . 
  if you 're upgrading holdings as an investment , your investment strategy is simply bad . 
  ( you can still do it for fun , if you 're a builder at heart . ), 
  did isis actually have to conquer the former rebel areas west of the river , or did the rebels join them ? 
  a week or two ago , the old town ( hamadiya , ardhi , ... ) were still held by `` green '' rebels . 
  it seems unlikely that isis so easily crossed the euphrates . 
  just try it . 
  play one game without spending * any * money on holdings . 
  just retinues , mercenaries , gifts , and events . 
  you can then go back to upgrading holdings , but you 'll only do it because the game gets so stupidly easy once you stop wasting your money . 
  however , i believe you 'd never have an actual embassy in a non-state . 
  that is : you might have one , but you would n't call it that . 
  the `` embassy '' of ireland in palestine is n't called an embassy either , it 's a [ representative office ] ( http://www.embassypages.com/missions/embassy9529/ ) . 
  [ arya ] `` coin '', 
  legen and setzen are transitive , they require some sort of ( grammatical ) object . 
  when you are putting a thing somewhere , it 's * legen * or * setzen * . 
  when a person is lying or sitting somewhere , it 's * liegen * or * sitzen * . 
  i think the only complicating factor here is that * legen * and * setzen * can be used reflexively . 
  `` ich lege/setze mich hin '' - which is what you do when you * start * lying/sitting . 
  `` i 'm lying/sitting * down * '' in english .

  `` und dann stellt ( e ) sich heraus '' is correct , but there is no real colloquial way of saying this in german . 
  you 'd need to chose some other construction . 
  `` it turned out he had been dead all this time '' would become `` er war n\u00e4mlich die ganze zeit tot gewesen . '', 
  so basically , i think i would just express `` turns out '' by adding `` n\u00e4mlich '' or `` in wahrheit '' ( or both ) somewhere in the sentence . 
  it 's not a translation , but it might be the thing you add to a story to make it sound better . 
  not really . 
  you wo n't ever `` need '' even ten percent of the stuff you learned for your tests . 
  but good test results still show that you were able to sit down and do some learning . 
  if you can , try to get good grades , it makes many things easier . 
  hello there from germany . 
  i think the good questions and answers on this topic are almost the same throughout the world . 
  you do n't need to `` blindly consume '' . 
  if you want to break free from expectations , you should do that - for a while . 
  hitchhike through a foreign country for a year , live in the woods , join the navy , do some crazy volunteer work . 
  after a while , i think the `` comfortable life '' happens to be ... well , the most comfortable . 
  you 'd like to have a car that actually works , your own place , warm running water and all the good food you want - and you 'd also like to be a productive member of the society that makes it possible to have all this . 
  or maybe that 's just me . 
  but by all means : if you think you need to get out of the beaten path for a while , do so , and you might find an entirely different path for yourself .

  the third one of the evening is usually the best . 
  coors , millers , bud - probably never . 
  real beer : most likely somewhere between age 14 and age 25 . 
  never for some people . 
  if you want to get into it , try a few very different beers . 
  really different , like a dark stout , a wheat beer , ... 
  when you find one you like , stick to that for a while . 
  ( but do n't become a pathetic beer snop claiming that you 've found the one true beer . ), 
  probably less . 
  do you work out ? 
  do you meet friends at least twice a week ( in your free time , not at school ) ? 
  do you have a ( non-computer ) hobby ? 
  if you answer all questions with yes , you do n't have a problem with gaming too much . 
  gaming can be fun . 
  but before you start a marathon session , you might ask yourself for a moment : one year from now , will i wish i had done something different with my free time ? 
  sometimes you should do what you feel like , but sometimes you should listen to you-one-year-from-now . 
  yes .
