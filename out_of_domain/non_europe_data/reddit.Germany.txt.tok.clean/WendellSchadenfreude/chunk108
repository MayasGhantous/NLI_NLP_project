  i look much better now than i did at 18 . 
  i 'm also always really close to getting a little belly . 
  at 18 ( and even at 25 ) , i could eat as much as i wanted and always stayed skinny , now i have to watch that shit . 
  most of them do n't . 
  but why should they ? 
  most of your friends from school really are just people who * happened * to be in your classes . 
  stay friends with one or two you really like , and then search for the people who should be your friends * for a reason * . 
  ( i 'm not saying you should cut anyone out of your life , but it 's normal for many people to drift out of your life , even if you were friends for a while . ), 
  the friends you make in your twenties will still be your `` old friends '' in your fourties . 
  depends somewhat on what you want to do , but in most cases : yeah . 
  no matter what you learn , that little piece of paper you get at the end proves that you were able to sit down and do some learning . 
  do n't worry . 
  i still remember her , and i think i always will . 
  but it does n't hurt to think about her anymore . 
  i remember her fondly , but i only do so when i want to . 
  yes . 
  i do n't know . 
  but try to remember that you do , it will be good to have you on * our * team in a few years . 
  giving advice !, 
  giving advice to younger people is so much fun . 
  in fact , you should start right now !, 
  most of the time : pretend you 're hanging out with a guy . 
  for most people : yes . 
  do n't be fooled if many people answer no - the few people who actually never change their mind about this are just very vocal , mostly because they get annoyed by everybody * expecting * them to change . 
  ( everybody expects that because it usually happens . ), 
  for all the fuss we make about it , having had sex wo n't really change you as a person . 
  nobody will even * know * wether you had sex unless you tell them . 
  have sex when you have found a person that you want to have sex with and who wants to have sex with you . 
  no sooner , no later . 
  do you have a copy of the paper you signed ? 
  i think you 're probably ok - they may have been generous because you were already about to leave voluntarily , you were n't just caught on the street . 
  but you wo n't really know until you try to reapply for a visa . 
  [ i think homer 's lie detector scene is actually much better , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnlc-b8zwek ) although neither of them makes for any good quotes . 
  what do you think the consequences would be if jordan is serious ? 
  would the fsa in the southwest collapse soon , or would n't it change much for them ? 
  you have any proof of that ? 
  * seized * , not seizes . 
  this is n't something new , they are just trying to quantify what was seized in june . 
   or is one more used for `` i am active on the internet '' vs. `` i am active in sports . '', 
  in these examples , i think there 's actually quite a clear difference . 
  `` ich bin im internet aktiv '' - you 're active on the internet . 
  we all are , i guess . 
  `` ich bin im internet t\u00e4tig '' - sounds a bit weird , but clearly must mean that you are doing * business * online . 
  `` ich bin aktiv im sport '' - you do sports . 
  you 're running or lifting or something . 
  `` ich bin t\u00e4tig im sport '' - you * work * in sports . 
  probably not as an athlete , but as some sort of official , maybe even just a sales representative . 
  in these cases , `` t\u00e4tig '' hints at a professional activity , while `` aktiv '' simply means you 're doing something . 
  i 'm not sure if these can be generalized . 
   a lot of people say that the dlc is pretty much mandatory, 
  where 'd you find these people ? 
  ck2 without any dlc is an amazing game . 
  the first dlc you should get once you have a few bucks is legacy of rome . 
  but even that is not mandatory in any way .

  nope . 
  they insist that unreal will be * free * , not `` free-to-play '' or anything . 
  no microtransactions , no equipment or progress for money , simply a free game . 
  which is difficult for foreigners to say , but not quite as difficult as the the related * streichholzsch\u00e4chtelchen '' - little box of matches . 
  please , write it anyway . 
  what made you feel poor , mrfanzypantz ? 
   the hazzm movement ( arabic : \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0645 , harakat hazzm , meaning movement of steadfastness [ 4 ] ) is an alliance of self-declared moderate syrian rebels . 
  [ 1 ] the group has been supplied the bgm-71 tow anti-tank missile [ 9 ] by a `` western source '' . 
  from wikipedia ... 
  or better yet , the washington institute , [ `` rebels worth supporting '' ] ( http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/rebels-worth-supporting-syrias-harakat-hazm ) :, 
   a close look at the group 's military and ideological credentials seems to reveal a model candidate for greater u.s. and allied support , including lethal military assistance . 
  i do n't understand your comment about sectarianism , could you explain that ? 
  just to be sure : was this the actual leadership of harakat hazzm , or just some local group ? 
  how would luther have enforced or even suggested any kind of pronounciation ? 
  audio book ? 
  i do n't think luther had much of an * intention * of creating a common german language ; i doubt that he intentionally mixed `` all major dialects '' . 
  he mostly just used his own dialect . 
  only in some cases , when he was aware that this dialect would be hard to understand for most of his readers , did he use vocabulary taken from southern germany . 
  most people always answer to this question that they love their capital province and want to hold as many baronies as possible in there . 
  i 'm fine with people doing that , but i 'm still quite certain that it is inefficient . 
  instead of holding a barony in your capital county , you can hold an entire additional county , with three or more holdings in it . 
  this is going to win against one single holding almost all of the time . 
  most importantly : * building * additional holdings in your capital county is * never * going to be cost-efficient when compared to hiring mercenaries . 
  you should only do it when you do n't know what to do with your money anymore , or when you 're doing it for the fun of it . 
  other people 's phone are n't made of tin cans . 
  there actually is no faster , more reliable way to get in contact with most people , at least when by `` contact '' you mean more than a one-way message . 
  on the contrary . 
  this confirms once again what we already knew with 100 % certainty : that isis and the baath party have been working together . 
  the news is only that their cooperation is over now .

   you are aware that alcohol related driving deaths dropped significantly the year after the drinking age was raised , right ? 
  i was not aware of this , and i could n't find any hard data on it either . 
  i 'd be happy if you could . 
  from what i found , the link between lower legal drinking age and more road deaths is n't all that well established at all . 
  [ this was one of the better articles i found . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/15/lowering-legal-drinking-age-opinions-contributors-regulation.html ), 
  they even mention what you said about the number of alcohol related driving deaths dropping the year after the drinking age was raised , with an interesting addition ... 
   virtually all the life-saving impact of the mlda21 comes from the few early-adopting states , not from the larger number that resulted from federal pressure . 
  further , any life-saving effect in those states that first raised the drinking age was only temporary , occurring largely in the first year or two after switching to the mlda21 . 
  if you had n't noticed , rockets have been fired from gaza against israel for years . 
  israel is only attacking gaza to get them to stop doing that . 
  if you could get hamas to credibly promise that there will be no future attacks on israel from gaza , israel would gladly stop all attacks on gaza in a heartbeat .
