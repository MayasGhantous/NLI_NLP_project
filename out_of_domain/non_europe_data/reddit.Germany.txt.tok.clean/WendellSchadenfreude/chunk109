  [ that was easy . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2011/world/asiapcf/05/31/japan.nuclear.suicide/ ), 
  the [ `` fukushima 50 '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fukushima_50 ) even have their own wikipedia entry . 
  not to detract from their bravery , but it should be noted that none of them ended up receiving a particularly worrisome dose of radiation . 
  [ the two workers that received the highest amounts of radiation were actually young men . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fukushima_50#injury ), 
   this could be due to cops generally being healthier with regular work outs . 
  more likely they are just young . 
  not even necessarily younger than the population average , but there are no * old * people among active duty cops , and old people are the most likely to get cancer . 
  this is very important . 
  since there are many kinds of cancer , some of them are very likely to be more common in any random sample than they are in the general population . 
  you might ask the 9/11 workers for their favorite ice cream flavor , and you 'd find that they like certain flavors significantly more than the general population - but that 's simply because some of these flavors are rare and a small number of 9/11 workers who happen to like maracuja ice cream already is significantly more than you would expect . 
  but if they did n't like maracuja , they might have liked almond ice cream or strawberry nougat or something . 
   ( all men will get prostate cancer is they live long enough ), 
  is that so ? 
  ... that is somewhat depressing ... 
  dating stone tools is difficult . 
  no carbon means no carbon dating . 
  you can do similar stuff with radioactive isotopes of other elements , but it 's much more work . 
  the biggest problem : you might be able to find the age of the rock . 
  but that does n't tell you when that rock was chipped into a tool . 
  * that * is my fetish . 
  lol all you want . 
  but if you do n't want to look like a fool while doing so , tell me : what reason do you think does the idf have for attacking gaza ? 
  they would , like everybody else in the world , gladly ignore that place and simply pretend it does n't exist . 
  the only reason israel sends soldiers to gaza instead is that israel has been attacked from gaza hundreds of times . 
  nope , they are certainly not . 
  this terrorist group certainly is not the * islamic state * . 
  if anything , they are `` is '' , * with * quotation marks to clarify that this is merely a self-chosen name . 
  calling them * isis * avoids that little tediousness . 
  german here . 
  did that guy just make fun of me ? 
  i do n't really understand his post , but i think he 's being insolent !, 
   hamas was bombarding israel with rockets because the israeli government , despite knowing hamas was n't behind the kidnappings , began arresting hamas personnel in an attempt to break up the unity government under the pretense of searching for the kidnappers . 
  so that 's why they started ...

  the term `` dark age '' is n't used for the middle ages anymore , [ and for good reason .

  if you 've never heard of albertus magnus , hildegard of bingen , or frederick ii. , you have some reading to do . 
  [ albertus magnus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albertus_magnus ) , patron saint of scientists and students , called the * universal doctor * , one of very few people named `` the great '' who did n't earn this nickname through bloodshed . 
  [ hildegard of bingen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hildegard_of_bingen ) , 12th century female polymath , known composer , philosopher , writer not only of theological , but also of botanical and medicinal texts . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_ii,_holy_roman_emperor#personality ) , holy roman emperor , fluent in six languages , patron of sciences and arts . 
  better known by his nickname , `` stupor mundi '' - `` the astonishment of the world '' . 
  there are many more , of course , but i do n't want to bore you too much . 
  how is that `` almost as bad ? '', 
  how is it bad * at all * ? 
  having all the same rights under a different names still gives you all the same rights . 
  i can understand people who complain about the adoption situation . 
  but people who complain that they can get married and have all the same rights as other married people , only the government wo n't use the same name for it - those people are ridiculous . 
  the government uses all kinds of weird bureaucratic names for things , and nobody cares . 
  gladly , people this whiny do n't really seem to exist in germany . 
  they get the same financial benefits . 
  complaining that you get everything you want but it 's not officially called by your favorite name is whiny and nothing else . 
  ( i already acknowledged that the `` right to adopt '' is separate from this . ), 
  the subtitles were awesome . 
  really well done , for instance the part where she says `` when i 'm a hundred !, 
  imagine that in ~ 50 years , we might be able to implant computers into our brains in a way that lets us access the internet and all of mankind 's knowledge the same way we access our own memories . 
  with an implant like that , you will be able to recite shakespeare 's entire works by heart , or learn a new language within seconds simply by deciding that you want to `` download '' it . 
  but since storage capacities and bandwidth keep increasing , you will reach a point where your implant allows you to `` remember '' the entire internet . 
  all of reddit , including * this comment * will be as easy for you to recall as any other piece of information ever published .

  [ this is an outline of scottland , overlayed with wyoming . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c3pdcd5.png ) it 's not just the north west highlands , it 's all of the scottish mainland . 
  as you can see , at least it 's bigger than the yellowstone , but wyoming is easily twice as big as all of scotland - actually , it 's more than three times the size . 
  but while scotland has more than 5 million inhabitants , wyoming has less than 600 thousand .

  depending on where the canal gets its water from , would n't it make more sense to fill the top part with more water ? 
  that way , because you 're lowering a lot of water every time , you could gain energy from operating this wheel . 
  holy cow , that canal is pure madness !, 
  a few yards after this wheel , the canal disappears into a tunnel . 
  then it uses an aquaeduct . 
  then another tunnel . 
  then it crosses several rivers on aquaeducts again ... and then it just ends in the middle of a city . 
   and then where does the boat go ? 
  top one to edinburgh , bottom one either to the firth of forth ( eastern seashore of britain ) or to the firth of clyde ( western shore ) . 
   why is there a boat monorail in the first place ? 
  in scottish , that 's called a `` canal '' . 
  what interest in doing so would israel have ? 
  if the school was actually targeted ( and not just hit accidentally ) , it was likely because the school 's premises were used for military purposes . 
  [ rockets have already been found at several un schools ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/rockets-found-in-unrwa-school-for-third-time/ ) , which makes the idf 's claim that mortars were fired from this school credible to me . 
   i really do n't understand why israel is doing this ? 
  taking a look at the article might help . 
  israel claims they were responding to mortar fire coming from the school . 
  since other [ un schools have been used by hamas for military purposes ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/rockets-found-in-unrwa-school-for-third-time/ ) , i find that claim credible . 
  using un schools for military purposes is the perfect crime . 
  [ even when the un find rockets that are illegally stored within un schools , they simply give them back to hamas ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/rockets-found-in-unrwa-school-for-third-time/ ) . 
   in this case , there were no rockets in the school . 
  how do you know that ? 
  thanks to hamas refusing , there has not been any investigation of what actually happened . 
  in this case , the claim was n't that there were rockets stored in the school , it was that there was mortar fire coming from the school .
