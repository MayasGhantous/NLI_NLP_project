  it might have to do with `` parliament '' also implying a place . 
  at least in your examples , it 's treated like one . 
  `` washington has approved/decided ... '' , `` reporting from times square ... '' , `` lengthy discussions in texas ... '', 
  `` repost '' does n't quite cover it . 
  searching reddit for `` zeitgeist '' turns up hundreds of hits , and most of them about this movie . 
  wait just a few more days ; you 'll see a lot of him . 
  wrong country . 
   senate approved the law, 
  i feel like i 've heard expressions like this a bunch of times ... 
   when the nazis were clearly christian, 
  this generalizes a bit too much . 
  the nazis even came up with their own ... denomination , if you will , called `` gottgl\u00e4ubig '' . 
  ( could be translated as * deistic * , although that is rather confusing . 
  literally * god-believing * , * believing in god * . ), 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gottgl%c3%a4ubig ) only has an article about this in german , sorry . 
  `` gottgl\u00e4ubig '' basically meant that you were * opposed * to the christian churches . 
  of course , it also clearly meant that you were * not * an atheist . 
  sounds more like a rap than a poem . 
  why would it be `` whom '' ? 
  it 's simply `` children who are at risk . '', 
  they are talking about deathmatch . 
  shit just got * unreal * . 
  [ yoda , are we still going the right way ? 
  [ you are right . 
  does this one work ? 
  ] ( http://i.qkme.me/36fqyn.jpg ), 
  to answer the question , i think you 're right about that , too . 
  yoda sometimes is simply wrong , but usually not , strictly speaking . 
  not wrong , just weird . 
  i do n't enjoy . 
  - you entered the discussion with an insult , completely uncalled for . 
  ( `` you are a fool . '' ), 
  - your argument is that a sperm cell and a fetus are the same thing . 
  really ? 
  - after that , all of you just keep talking about rape , and make fun of `` dayton '' when he does n't seem to think it 's numerically important . 
  [ guess what , he 's right . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_the_united_states#reasons_for_abortions ), 
  - alistair 's opening statement is just pure nonsense . 
  does he think ( and do you think ) that supporting the death penalty means you have to support the random killing of humans under all circumstances ? 
  death penalty and abortion have * hardly anything * to do with each other . 
  - because there was no connection to atheism , you simply had to insult dayton again and call him out on his `` bullshit '' about `` precious life given by the almighty '' - but * he * *** did n't say anything like that *** . 
  that 's not him . 
  `` i 'm not okay with that '' leaves a lot of room for interpretation . 
  do you think it should be illegal ? 
  who should be punished , and ( roughly ) how severely ? 
  or do you just think it 's a bad idea , but should still be legal , like smoking , getting a tramp stamp , or listening to rap music ? 
  ( very subjective list , i 'm aware of that . ), 
  or do you only mean that * you * would n't want to have one , while it might be ok for others ? 
  so , i should not open it ? 
  ok , opened it . 
  it 's ok . 
  even sfw , unless you start screaming when mildy surprised . 
  it 's for everyone , not just german citizens . 
  ah , ok , i can see where that comes from now . 
  to be fair , it would be correct to ask '' *** whom *** are you looking at ? '', 
  - that 's kinda confusing . 
   the first question is are they all ` correct ' uses ( ie : are they something that you would encourage a non-native to learn to say ) ? 
  they are not . 
  she mostly uses `` eben '' as a meaningless interjection , the way you might use `` well '' or `` you know '' . 
  i would definitely encourage you to try and and learn using `` eben '' correctly , but not the way she does . 
  ( although i have little doubt that she is a german native speaker . ), 
  also , `` eben '' * is * really tricky . 
  do n't bother if your german is n't otherwise pretty good already . 
  iirc , some of my classmates used to say `` eben '' like this in school when giving presentations or answering questions . 
  i think they did so because they were talking to the teacher , and the teacher already knows what they are going to say ( if it is correct ) . 
  i think in that case it 's used more or less subconciously as an apology for saying stuff that is obvious . 
  anyway : it 's not a use that you should try to imitate . 
  in addition to the good answers you already got , maybe just a little thought for your dad :, 
  if fibonacci was in fact `` god 's fingerprint '' - why is n't it in the bible ? 
  i agree that this example is correct , but is it really grammatical ? 
  i thought it was only correct because this is a standing expression , used only like this or with small variations . 
  is every construction of the form `` he is a hard x not to y '' grammatically correct ? 
  would the exact opposite , `` he is an easy x not to y '' ( ? ), 
  also be correct ? 
  it just sounds weird because `` hard '' definitely * seems * to modify `` man '' , not `` not to like '' . 
   video ut latine loquis . 
  [ what i wanted to say : `` i see that you speak latin . 
  for me , it 's been a few years since i last practised latin . '' ], 
  i think you can answer that question truthfully without saying `` no '' . 
  you tell your child that you do n't know . 
  then ask what they will do in the afterlife * if * there is one ; or talk about how it would be nice if they could watch you from the afterlife * if * there is one . 
  you do n't have to put any stress on the '' * if * '' 's - i do n't think they are what children will usually want to talk about ... 
  alternatively , something along the line of `` after death , i think there will be peace ; and no more pain and medicines and other nasty stuff . '', 
   a single scv builds barracks full of people . 
  those people come out of buildings , but they can never go back in there . 
  they * can * shoot right through the buildings , though ... 
  give me one good reason to force parents to feed their children even though they do n't want them anymore . 
  [ i 'm not saying babies are the same thing as fetuses . 
  but there are lots of people who essentially believe just that , and * that 's * the point you have to be arguing . ], 
  but unlike plants , they can be said to be * human * . 
  i gave you an upside down upvote for this comment . 
  beautiful . 
  did your friends like it ? 
  also : try doing the same with the stars & stripes . 
  okcupid . 
  ( go to / r/okcupid for the details . ), 
  it 's not that widespread in germany , but you might still find some nice people there . 
  i do n't think you 'll find anybody on reddit directly - there are n't that many germans here , and they 're all guys .
