  if that is the case , i find it legitimate to ** return ** fire . 
   the un found one cache, 
  so you did n't even bother to read the * headline * of the article i linked . 
   rockets found in unrwa school , ** for third time **, 
  one time can happen . 
  three times : there 's a system behind that . 
  as others said , you do n't have to trust the times of israel , the un themselves admit this . 
   they are purposely targeting innocent civilians now . 
  and why would they do that ? 
  if your only explanation is `` for the fun of it '' , you should think long and hard about wether you believe you 're really understanding this conflict . 
  if you could make a deal with hamas that they do n't use specific areas , i would n't want to see these areas bombed . 
  i 'd be happy that civilians are safe there . 
  but hamas * is * using these schools for military purposes . 
  just as they have been known to use mosques , hospitals , ambulances - there is no place that is safe in gaza , and that is * thanks to hamas * . 
  you are rambling . 
  police do sometimes try to liberate hostages with force . 
  sometimes , hostages die in the process . 
  it 's not my fault that hamas is holding the entire population of the gaza strip hostage . 
  - this is your own analogy , by the way , and i like it . 
  in this case , soldiers claim they only * returned fire * after they were shot at from the school . 
  since we already proved that hamas * does * use schools for military purposes , i find that claim credible . 
  even more so since hamas refused any investigation of the incidence . 
  by the way , it 's [ `` false equivalence '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_equivalence ) . 
  only this is not . 
  the green line is the green line .

  i think the restarting is causing most of your problems . 
  unless you actually lost your last province , you can keep playing . 
  and only by staying in the game do you learn anything about * your current playthrough * and the opportunities it might offer . 
  next game , keep at it , for at least 100 years . 
  if you lose a war , maybe your son or your grandson can avenge you . 
  the game gets easier over time , and that includes in-game time . 
  your starting character has random stats and traits , his son will be better , * his * son will be better still ( and hopefully start a long line of grey eminences ) . 
  proper answer :, 
   in fact the `` allies '' were actually known as the axis and germany 's side was known as the central powers, 
  you are right about the `` central powers '' , but the allies in wwi were either called the allies , or the entente . 
  i never heard anyone call them the `` axis '' . 
  nope . 
  no dlcs are necessary at all , and the one you have ( legacy of rome ) is the most important one . 
  old gods , rajas , republic , sword - they are all nice and absolutely worth the money , but you do n't need any of them to enjoy the game . 
  so how have the bee populations in europe fared since the ban ? 
  * numbers * could easily convince me that more action needs to be taken . 
  give me some * numbers * to quantify the problem , or i wo n't believe you that there * is * a problem . 
  take a look at [ this article for instance . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/02/05/bee-deaths-reversal-as-evidence-points-away-from-neonics-as-driver-pressure-builds-to-rethink-ban/ ) it claims that the global [ number of beehives has been * increasing * ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jonentine/files/2014/05/global-beehives.png ) for decades , and that `` ccd '' does n't have an effect on [ the number of american beehives ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jonentine/files/2014/05/honeybees.png ) either . 
  i wo n't take this one article as scripture - they might easily be full of shit . 
  but they at least * try * to use numbers to quantify the issue , and they end up not seeing a problem at all . 
  if you want to convince me that there * is * a problem , you 'll have to use numbers as well . 
  building a tank ( without previous experience ) takes years upon years of work and planning . 
  building a first carrier group takes * decades * and costs billions . 
  if we 're talking about actual warfare , high effort and costs are n't much of a problem . 
  and stuxnet reached targets that would have been very difficult to hit by any other means . 
  retinues . 
  yep . 
  soviet nuclear warhead , definitely .

   if all the honey bees die off, 
  luckily , this is n't happening .

  i 'm so disappointed . 
  i thought you were talking about a plant , a living organism that generally does not move and absorbs nutrients from its surroundings . 
  but really you were just talking about some [ desalination plant ... ] ( http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25859513/nations-largest-ocean-desalination-plant-goes-up-near ), 
  now the only problem is that the actual til is so boring in this case . 
  learning about apollo 13 was interesting enough . 
  but learning that there was some dude somewhere who did n't know that apollo 13 really happened - woohoo ? 
  since you are an emperor , reforming the faith should be a piece of cake . 
  declare war on all the holders of holy sites at the same time , take enough , reform , switch to elective , be happy . 
  might be faster to use conquest cbs to increase moral authority . 
  or simply conquer all five holy sites , nevermind about authority ... 
  do you know if this is the legal wedding ( at the standesamt ) , the church wedding , or both on the same day ? 
  they will be expecting a present unless it says otherwise on the invitation . 
  you can be quite certain that there will never be a special focus on you during the entire event - the groom 's cousin and her partner are distant enough that nobody will really pay attention to you . 
  you might be right , if these are pillows that are permanently on the window sill , so that you can comfortably rest your arms while looking out the window . 
  i think op was talking about regular pillows/blankets that are used on beds and only put on window sills for a few hours . 
  i like this alternative suggestion . 
  / u/chorrovon , you should get a tattoo saying `` consider well , my friend '' instead . 
  do you have a reason to believe that beehives are significantly smaller now than they were in the 1960 's ? 
  colony collapse disorder is * not * known to reduce the number of bees in one hive . 
  in any case , i 'd be happy if you just include the ` keyword ' into your message : it would be really frightening if the bees died off , but the number of bees today is probably higher than it has ever been . 
  perfect sentence , does n't sound odd at all . 
  `` ich lese nicht viel '' is a fine alternative if you want to say that you do n't like reading in general ( books , newspapers , magazines ) . 
  `` ich lese nicht viele b\u00fccher '' is the normal way of saying that you do n't read many books . 
  sure , it might mean that you read cereal boxes instead , put usually it will just mean that you do n't read a lot . 
  ( the exact way of saying that you do n't read a lot would be `` ich lese nicht viel . '' ), 
  it puts extra emphasis on the `` nicht '' . 
  it does n't just mean that you do n't read a lot , it means that there are many books that you make a point of * not reading * . 
  `` there are many books that i * avoid * '' , or something . 
  `` ich lese viele b\u00fccher nicht '' ~ there are many books that i avoid . 
  there are many books that i * refuse * to read . 
  there are many books that i * do n't * read . 
  the latter is a somewhat strange statement . 
  placement of `` nicht '' usually alters the meaning of a sentence , but the rules for it are very similar to the english rules .
