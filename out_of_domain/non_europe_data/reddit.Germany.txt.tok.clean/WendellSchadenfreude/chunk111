  picture : get a good picture , made by a photographer ( not a machine ) . 
  wear a suit . 
  smile at the camera . 
  the picture should show your complete face and end a bit below your shoulders . 
  ( these pictures look best if your shoulders are n't facing the camera directly , put positioned about a 35 \u00b0 angle - one shoulder slightly toward the camera , on away from it . 
  but your face is looking directly at the camera . ), 
  i baffles me how you can say that in reply to a story in which the pharmaceutical industry quite obviously was the * hero * . 
  roots ' ex was in horrible pain and probably close to death until pharmaceutical research stepped in and kicked that virus ass . 
  yeah , it 's expensive . 
  but it 's worth it . 
  i hope so , but i 'm not sure if this applies to an american photographer taking pictures for a german cv . 
  the other way round , it would only work with a very honest photographer , who tells you that you have no need of his services . 
  link to tvtropes , [ `` standard hero reward '' . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/standardheroreward ), 
   a very common reward for the hero saving the day ( such as slaying the dragon/demon/evil wizard/whatever terrorizing the kingdom ) is marriage to the princess ( of the hero 's choice if there are more than one ) and being granted either half or all of the kingdom ( depending on whether the sovereign already has a male heir ) . 
   ( note i 'm trying out more fonetical spellings ), 
  note : it makes you look like a phool . 
  the pharmaceutical industry already did its job when the pill enters the market . 
  `` before even attempting '' would mean that they demand their money before doing any research . 
  [ if you 're female , you do n't get a job in germany !, 
  call it what you will , it 's still * saving lives * . 
  replying to that with `` fuck pharma '' is ignorant . 
   these figures in and of themselves only indicate that the roads are getting safer ; they do n't suggest that pot had anything to do with it . 
  we 're also only seven months in . 
  maybe these figures will change . 
  finally , it 's also possible that if it were n't for legal pot , the 2014 figures would be even lower . 
  there 's no real way to know that . 
  we can only look at the data available . 
  but you can bet that if fatalities were up this year , prohibition supporters would be blaming it on legal marijuana . 
  this reporting * is * as accurate and honest as it gets . 
  do n't reply to that guy any further . 
  it wo n't help , since he 's obviously bad at reading . 
  instead , just ** smile ** and move on !, 
  so , do scientists shooting themselves in the head cause people to say that phrase , is it the other way round , are the two events triggered by the same third event , or is there no causal link between the two ? 
  not reading the article is fucking retarded .

  if you count all pirates , it 's complete nonsense - there are probably * more * pirates now than there were at any other time in history . 
  pastafarians believe that pirates only prevent global warming when they are wearing * full pirate regalia * - eyepatches , peg legs , parrots , `` arrrr '' ... if you measure this number , it 's still complete nonsense , but it begins to be entertaining nonsense . 
  you 'll rarely go wrong if you leave out the `` f\u00fcr '' . 
  you can use it whenever the direct object is the thing you are paying for ( not the person you are paying ) , but you do n't have to use it . 
  ( `` ich habe f\u00fcr den klempner bezahlt '' might mean that you paid his company instead of paying the guy in cash . ), 
  i paid for the new pipes . 
  - to me , these two sound about equally acceptable . 
  christians surrounded by other christians are supposed to have a hard time expanding . 
  you get stability and safety , but you do n't get good cbs . 
  your easiest options are fabricated claims and invited claimants . 
  if you have a good chancellor , fabricating claims is n't all that slow - if your ruler is still young , you can fabricate a few claims and wait for a good time to press them all at once . 
  ( just be careful , these claims are not inherited . ), 
  inviting claimants : since you already have that princess , you can just marry her to your own heir , and * his * heir will one day inherit both scottland and ireland . 
  slow and tedious . 
  also quit risky , because one of them might die and mess up the succession . 
  it 's easier if you just invite claimants to the scottish * duchies * . 
  use the cb they give you , but just before pressing their claim ( at the end of the war ) , give them some of your own land - a barony is enough . 
  that way , they are you vassal , and they stay your vassal even when they get their ( formerly scottish ) duchy . 
  against your fellow christians , this is usually the fastest method to expand . 
  ( playing around with heresies or getting the pope to grant you claims can be faster , but are more advanced tactics . ), 
  he could say that if he had visited four lawyers . 
  maybe still at five or six . 
  it would also help if he had actually hired any of them . 
  but talking to * thirty * lawyers without hiring any of them - nobody is that picky . 
  i saw this link and thought `` oh , that 's interesting , i 'm gon na click that immediately ! '', 
  - the cursor rushed towards it to do its thing , and at the last moment before clicking i stopped myself - `` not so fast !, 
  not this time , motherfucker !, 
  fool me twenty times , shame on you , but fool me twentyone times - wait , that 's not him ... 
  they do n't even try to control for obvious factors like different number of hours worked and career interruptions . 
  surprisingly , the institute for women 's policy research is not an unbiased source . 
  [ entrapment explained by the illustrated guide to criminal law ] ( http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped ) . 
  i think this is accurate . 
   but you can bet that if fatalities were up this year , prohibition supporters would be blaming it on legal marijuana . 
  ** this ** is basically the whole point of the arrticle , and this alone is worth an article . 
  when people make any kind of drastic prediction , it 's always worth looking at reality after a while , just to check how far the predictions became reality . 
  so , how is crime developing in colorado , how many pot-related deaths or medical emergencies are there , how is the tax revenue developing , and yes , how safe are the streets . 
  it 's good that these things are checked , no matter what the numbers are . 
  in this case , it 's too early for a final conclusion , but we can already say at least one thing with relative certainty : legalising pot did n't have * catastrophic * consequences for road safety . 
  you only expand every 10 years if you only have one possible target and that target is completely stable . 
  if your ruler dies - the truce is over . 
  if their ruler dies - the truce is over . 
  if their ruler dies under suspicious circumstances - the truce is over . 
  ( i do n't use assassinations very often myself , i find them far to expansive . 
  but it is an option in this case . ), 
  if there is a rebellion in their realm - you do n't have a truce with the rebels , attack them immediately . 
  as soon as you can , usurp the english crown - all english duke vassals now become independent , and will either join your realm peacefully or become easy targets . 
  controling scottland and ireland , i 'm sure you can find some more targets . 
  take the islands north of britain , take the bretagne , attack norway - * something * is always possible . 
  you will very likely not like your first beer , or your second . 
  beer takes a while to get used to . 
  if you find you do n't like beer , try radler ( beer mixed with sprite ) . 
  hu , i never wondered : if the shia take over in ck2 , can they get a `` sunni caliphate rising '' event ? 
  or is that event always shias rising against sunnis ? 
  well written , yet it loses a lot of power simply by panda 's reply that he is * not * russian , but american . 
  no one so far commented on the fact that your username makes the fact that you 're asking this kind of question slightly suspicious ? 
  anyhow : awesome diagram !, 
  that does n't sound like a german name . 
  my first guess is that it 's semi-phonetic spelling for [ * leinfelden * ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/leinfelden-echterdingen ) , but that 's really just a guess and it could also be any number of other places .
