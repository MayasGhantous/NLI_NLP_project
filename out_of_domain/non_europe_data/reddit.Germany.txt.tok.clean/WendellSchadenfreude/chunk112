  behrendt is quite a common name in germany , this map shows [ where behrendts live today . 
   pick a definition for `` fascism '' , whatever it is , `` facing it now '' has not led to its disappearance . 
  how about the original italian fascism , ot the german nazi fascism ? 
  all ships departed from the ports , even the ones carrying mostly southern or eastern german emigrants . 
  but you are right , of course : langenfeld or many other spellings are similarly likely . 
  positive by 5 is still horrible . 
  make your vassals * happy * . 
  when none of them are in the red and all the important ones are at 70 + , you can start thinking about your charades again . 
  `` right next to your capital '' is only really better if it 's in your capital duchy . 
  if you can get the counties in your capital duchy , you should - preferably by * plotting * to revoke the titles . 
  probably not worth it then . 
   very confused here since i thought any different religion gave free revokes with medium , not just hostile religions . 
  is this right ? 
  nope . 
  it 's infidels . 
  since you are the ere , you can still revoke all duchies . 
  or simply * ask * your vassals to convert - they do n't consider you an infidel either , so their opinion modifiers are n't too bad . 
  there is none . 
  it 's just diffferent ways of translating their name . 
  islamic state of iraq and the levante or is of iraq and al-sham ( which is the arabic name of the levante or `` greater syria '' , basically ) . 
   last time i checked you ca n't swear fealty to an emperor as a king ,, 
  i do n't think this was ever true , but it certainly is n't at the moment . 
  ai kings will never swear fealty , but the human player can . 
  yes , he is quite likely to do that . 
  i think they fixed all this a few patches ago . 
  if you brokered a betrothal , the ai * will * now honor that agreement ( including wether or not the marriage is matrilinear ) , and your son will get married soon after both of them turn 16 . 
  the biggest risk is that the wife you chose for your son might die , and then he will chose to marry some ugly 32 year-old courtier matrilineally . 
  no certain way of fixing that . 
  your son will get married eventually , and as a king , he is likely to pick a reasonable match . 
  ( although the ai does occasionally chose the lisping courtier or the inbred daughter of some baron instead . ), 
  you can offer him a courtier of yours , but he is n't that likely to accept . 
  this is correct . 
  i only disagree with the edit :, 
   it 's still a really inefficient way to bring lands into your realm . 
  depending on the situation , this method can be very efficient . 
  taking an entire duchy from the hre without even going to war ? 
  yes , please !, 
  by the way , op : the rule for inheritances is different from the rule for * pressing claims * - if you had pressed a claim on a duchy for one of your counts , that count-turned-duke with all his land would still have been your vassal . 
  there 's also these three :, 
  `` dolorous edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight 's breastplate , but jon was not so certain . '', 
  `` a shield on his right arm would prove about as useful as nipples on his breastplate . '', 
  `` the nipples on his muscled breastplate had a pair of iron rings through them . '', 
  searchall !, 
  `` nipples on '', 
  [ here is the post . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings/comments/272cr3/500_or_so_hours_and_this_is_the_first_time_ive/ ), 
  i think this happens when you have auto-invite activated . 
  the characters receive an invitation to your plot the moment you bribe them , so they are no longer diplomatically available ( because they are already considering your offer ) , and this is counted as a `` no '' by the computer . 
  so , a bug , basically . 
  but if it is as i described , it should still mean that these characters join your plot a few days later - have you checked if that happens ? 
  i 've done that a few times . 
  it does work , but it can get awfully slow - most heirs are quite happy at home and wo n't join your court . 
  do n't forget to ask their wives instead , sometimes * they * will come to your court and bring their husbands with them . 
  sometimes you can even offer one of your courtiers to the heir who refuses to come to your court , then invite her back as soon as the two of them are married . 
  i 'd still go for duchy heirs instead - since the formerly pagan duchy you gave them has reduced levies and is probably quite useless in general , they wo n't usually be all that dangerous even after inheriting their second duchy . 
  it 's not in the depths of a flooded mine , it 's on the iron islands with dunstan drumm . 
  it 's not clear when exactly it was acquired by hilmar drumm , but this happened very likely long before tywin was born . 
  ( dunstan drumm is 30 years older than tywin , and hilmar was one of his ancestors . ), 
   and many of the gothic/frank tribes attacked the muslims in spain , which prompted the battle of tours . 
  tours is right in the middle of ( today 's ) france , hundreds of kilometers north of the pyrenees , the mountain range that separates spain from france . 
  the battle there took place ( obviously ! ), 
  because the muslims were attacking the franks , * not * the other way round . 
  the muslim invasion force had already pillaged bordeaux and other cities . 
  and before this invasion , there had already been numerous raids by the muslims north of the pyrenees . 
  why would you want to preserve your own non-icelandic heritage on iceland of all places ? 
  the list of approved female names actually includes bj\u00f6rg , bj\u00f6rgey , bj\u00f6rghei\u00f0ur , bj\u00f6rghildur , bj\u00f6rney , bj\u00f6rnfr\u00ed\u00f0ur , and bj\u00f6rt . 
  and bj\u00f6rk . 
  that would actually be an `` erlaubt '' list . 
  * was * it banned , really ? 
  i believe this is just something they say about this trailer to make it sound more interesting . 
  i did n't notice any swastikas in there - those can easily get stuff banned in germany . 
  showing images of hitler is allowed , showing the [ iron cross ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_cross ) certainly is . 
  why would n't it be ? 
  i honestly do n't even know which one you think should be faster . 
  edit : guys , i 'm * honestly * asking . 
  i see no reason whatsoever why an army of 5,000 men should be significantly slower or faster than an army of 20,000 men - if you know one , please explain this to me !, 
  that 's a reason at least , although i 'm unconvinced . 
  a larger army has to form a longer column , but that column still marches at the same speed . 
  it 's only an issue if soldiers have to wait around before they can enter that narrow path . 
  but to avoid that issue , good planning ( i.e. 
  the organizer trait ) still seems much more important than a 5k-vs-20k difference in numbers . 
  ca n't go wrong with that choice , those are three very nice cities . 
  thanks to some fierce competition between discounters ( e.g. 
  aldi ) , food is actually very cheap in germany . 
  100 $ still sounds ambitious to me . 
  i 'm sure it 's possible , but frugal . 
  will you be able to cook at home all the time ? 
  i think most students in germany get most of their meals in university cafeterias . 
  those are still cheap , but not * that * cheap . 
  only indirect disadvantages . 
  when your vassals start plotting , you get a reason to imprison them without invoking a tyrany penalty . 
  vassals often plot against each other , which can be to your benefit . 
  `` see the duchy of x granted to a new ruler '' prevents dangerous superdukes , but your spymaster will still auto-cancel that plot . 
  when you ask someone who is * backing * a plot to stop doing that , you either get a reason to imprison then ( when they say no ) , or you get a +50 opinion bonus ( when they comply ) . 
  to be a bit clearer than that : ~ ~ `` ich werde gegeht haben . 
  '' ~ ~ is wrong . 
  it 's a mistake a native speaker would * never * make , and it sounds horrible . 
  so whatever the source is , it was certainly written by an inexperienced non-native . 
  ( `` i will have walked . '' ), 
  `` ich werde '' * is * `` i 'm going to '' .
