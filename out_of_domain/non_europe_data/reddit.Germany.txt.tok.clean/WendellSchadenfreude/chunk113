  `` ich werde deutsch lernen '' - `` i 'm going to learn german . '', 
  `` i 'm going to conquer asia . '', 
  futur ii , `` ich werde gegangen sein '' , is probably something that you should learn later . 
  in most cases , `` tun '' and `` machen '' mean the same thing , but you 'll be safe if you always go with `` machen '' for now . 
  using * machen * instead of * tun * is correct in most cases , it usually even `` sounds normal '' . 
  you are right that germans will very often use the present tense even when talking about the future . 
  this is especially true when you are talking about the immediate future - `` ich mach ' das gleich . '', 
  it 's also fine to say this about the more distant future . 
  i think it indicates that you have a concrete plan . 
  ( does n't sound sarcastic at all . ), 
  in a way , the present tense is simply the `` normal '' way of talking in german . 
  '' ) , the present ( duh ... ) , the future ( see above ) , reccurring events ( `` immer wenn es regnet , denk ' ich an recife . 
  and probably some other things that i ca n't think of at the moment . 
  the big thing in that dlc is retinues . 
  once you are a decent size power ( ~ kingdom ) , go to the military advisor , retinue tab , and create some of those . 
  standing armies !, 
  you can declare war without disbanding them . 
  you can even declare war ( for extra fun ) while they are already on the march and only days away from arriving in enemy land . 
   rebels beat islamists, 
  so where did that happen ? 
  no way !, 
  `` master race '' master race represent !, 
  i guess it 's more or less the same in german : looked down upon by some people , but that 's no reason not to do it . 
  use it when you are at the bar or telling a story to your friends . 
  use the correct past tense when talking to your colleagues or to strangers . 
  show me the poacher who goes `` ah , not worth it '' when he sees an elephant with small tusks , and i 'll believe you . 
  `` small tusks '' must still be worth several thousand dollars .

  good of you to ask when you do n't understand such things . 
  it does n't justify him being shot , and ahbraham does n't seem to be * trying * to justify that . 
  but it still matters . 
  the story so far was that an unarmed teenager on the way to visit his grandmother was shot by the police . 
  now we know he was also an aggressive petty criminal . 
  that makes the idea that the cop was not a trigger-happy racist at least somewhat more credible , although it should still be investigated how far his actions were justified . 
  all of this has nothing to do , by the way , with the way the ferguson police handles protests . 
  absolutely . 
  if you can prove that the cop had just beaten up some black kids for no reason , if you can prove that he was a kkk member , if you can prove that he talked to his friends about his wish to kill black people - all that would be relevant information . 
  it would n't change the facts of what happened in this specific case . 
  but of course we do n't know these facts for certain . 
  at the moment , it still seems to me that this cop messed up and fatally shot a man whom he should n't have shot . 
  but this new information - that the victim was not only an unarmed teenager walking to his grandmother , but also an aggressive petty criminal - at least makes it seem less likely that the only reason for his death was an officer 's racism . 
  knowing that the victim behaved aggressively on the same day only some minutes earlier makes any claims that he behaved aggressively * again * much more credible . 
  real evidence about what actually happened when brown was killed would of course be much better , but this is * not * irrelevant . 
  that is possible . 
  in reality though , we just do n't know yet why exactly he was shot . 
  we may never know . 
  at least , it seems much less likely now that his being black was the only reason . 
  this is actually a great comparison to the current brown case :, 
  we know that these officers used excessive force in unrelated cases . 
  that does n't , strictly speaking , tell us if they did in * this * case . 
  we only know one version of the story , and maybe landau is n't telling the truth about it . 
  * but * knowing that the officers used excessive force in other cases still matters - it makes landau 's story much more credible . 
  in the current brown case , we also just got some new information : that brown was a petty criminal who had just stolen stuff from a shop and bullied the shopkeeper . 
  strictly speaking , this does once again not tell us anything about how and why he got shot a few minutes later . 
  but it * does * make some versions of the story more credible . 
  i wish the officers in the landau case would get punished severly for all the times they used excessive force , and it 's good to know that at least they got fired . 
  i do n't know yet what i should wish for for the officer who shot michael brown . 
  this is the best answer in this thread , never mind op 's negativity . 
  i think the alternative meaning is actually much more common :, 
  i guess using `` nicht einen '' in this sense ( `` not one , but several '' ) is the most common way of using it , with the meaning you described ( `` not even a single one '' ) being a distant second . 
  -- i do n't have a dog . 
  ( stop telling the landlord i do . ), 
   ich habe nicht einen hund - i do n't have a dog ( i had one , but not now ), 
  these sentences both just sound unnatural . 
  i both cases , i ca n't imagine native speakers saying anything other than `` ich habe keinen hund . '', 
  pretty sure you 're misinterpreting . 
   a king can only gain power if he is respected enough by his vassals , even more so than currently , and ** a vassal maintains full control of his own armies ** , making war much more scattered . 
  ( note that this is only for tribal vassals . ), 
  wait , wait , this is important !, 
  i always pronounce csgo as `` si es go ! '', 
  - would that make it an initionym ? 
  nope . 
  it might be possible under special circumstances , but in this case at least , it would n't work . 
  when you accept the hre 's call to arms , you are at war with france and ca n't declare another war on them . 
  however , you do not get a truce with them at the end of the war - so you might consider joining this war and declaring another one as soon as this one is over . 
  france might lose all her retinues against the hre and deplete her levies , while you siege down some castles in navarra - this will make things easier for you when you start the continuation war . 
  does n't work . 
  the moment you declare war , their call to arms becomes invalid , and they consider that a dishonored alliance . 
  raising your hand is the signal for `` thank you '' or `` sorry '' that every driver in germany understands . 
  if someone used their hazard lights this way , i would n't even understand it . 
   everyone in the world is descended from a single person who lived around 3,500 years ago , according to a new study .

  maybe he wants to emphasize that they are greek nationalists , to such a high degree that they basically are n't * anything but greek * . 
   there is a theory that robb has warged into greywind multiple times as some of his men recall he would sit in front of plans for hours without moving or reacting to anything . 
  just to clarify : it was * robb * who sat in front of maps and battle plans for hours , not grey wind . 
  ( i 'm just clarifying because i was confused for a second - `` the wolf did that ? 
  how did i miss something so weird ? '' ), 
   the best vassal type is a duke who holds his entire de jure duchy ( but no additional lands ), 
  why do you want your dukes to hold their entire duchy ? 
  is n't it better if they only control their capitals , with all other countries being held by counts ? 
  i do n't think this makes a major difference once you hold an empire , but i always prefered dukes to personally hold as little land as possible to keep them weak . 
   a good time to create a republic is when you kill one . 
  the best time to create a vassal republic is * as soon as possible * . 
  when you have any coastal city and a duchy title available , create a republic immediately !, 
  the tax income is always worth it . 
  one thing i 'm not sure about in the current patch : is it still advantageous to turn all of the cities in your capital into republics ?
