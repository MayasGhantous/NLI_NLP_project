  a while ago , this used to improve your capital 's technology because the vassal dukes would add their research to yours . 
  i want to give them control , i just do n't want to give them the land directly . 
  keeps them happy , but still keeps them weak . 
  only downside i can think of is that you will have somewhat more frequent inter-vassal wars when the duke tries to revoke one of the counties . 
   on a side note , has anybody else noticed that the shia/sunni caliphs act really stupid when they get small ? 
  all religious heads who can call great holy wars do that . 
  they ignore the strength of their target when declaring war , because they hope all followers of their religion will join them . 
  of course , this does n't help much once their religion has become tiny altogether , but it 's the way they are coded . 
  otherwise , the pope would never call e.g. 
  for the typical `` crusade for jerusalem '' , because that 's usually part of an arabic empire that is much stronger than the pope alone . 
  ( this coding could be improved , of course . 
  but on the other hand : it has religious fanatics do stupid things , so the realism might not be all that bad after all . ), 
  ca n't you just revoke all of them by plot ( in the intrigue tab ) ? 
  [ yes , to keep people away ... ] ( http://hqwide.com/wallpapers/l/1280x1024/17/batman_the_dark_knight_rises_scarecrow_comic_character_1280x1024_16827.jpg ), 
  owning slaves or killing gays hurts people no matter where you do it . 
  observing location-specific dress codes does n't hurt anyone . 
  liberal societies accept a wide range of dress codes , but they * can * define limits . 
  going nude is completely acceptable when you are in a finnish sauna or at a german fkk beach , but a naked stroll through manhattan will get you arrested . 
  there 's nothing discriminatory about that . 
  context is extortion . 
  redshirt 's plan is to get money from the driver by threatening to call the police because he was `` run over '' . 
  instead , he got run over . 
  that 's not `` i believe i can fly '' , that 's `` farewell , cruel world . '', 
  - [ just like this one . 
  `` seize with both hands '' ? 
  of course . 
  after all , it 's to keep the theories * inside * of his head , not to keep them out . 
  damn , i 'd never seen the context of that gif . 
  i love the sound effects of those bug war videos . 
  for those who ca n't think * that * hard , let me explain : whales have lungs , they regularly come up to the surface to breath air . 
   this is how you end up getting entire villages slaughtered . 
  yeah , because isis would n't do that otherwise ... / s, 
  why is everybody here giving complicated answers ? 
  * no , this is * ** not ** * a normal sentence . 
  this is an example of artistic license , which rammstein use to some extent in most of their songs . 
  a normal sentence would either simply be `` ich gehe nach hause '' , or - if you want to emphasize that you are going by yourself - `` ich gehe allein ( e ) nach hause . '', 
  i was hoping for the association with `` seize the day . '', 
  has he already been king of france for a while , or did he just inherit that title ? 
  i once had a courtier who came to inherit the independent kingdom of sweden . 
  he was leading one of my armies at the time , and he staid with that army for several months - i think i was only a duke myself , but i had a foreign king as one of my generals . 
  i think he only left when he declared a war of his own and went to lead his own armies instead . 
  nice idea . 
  i think it 's not worth the hazzle of atually searching for high-stewardship women , but nice if you have a few of them just laying around . 
  german here . 
  that does n't sound like an odd question to me . 
  of course you ask people what they do for a living . 
  another german here . 
  i 'm surprised that my fellow germans so far all claim that this does n't exist . 
  many people in germany will get somewhat tense when they learn they are dealing with jews . 
  * do n't make any inapprobriate jokes , do n't make any ... dammit , why ca n't i stop thinking about gas ? 
  * - something like this . 
  i 'm almost certain that the accusation `` are you treating me like this because i 'm jewish ? '', 
  will get more * interesting * reactions in germany than `` is it because i 'm from canada ? '', 
  - if there were no lingering weird feelings , there would be no reason for this difference . 
  no free breadsticks , but you do n't literally get these in america for being navajo either . 
  ( do you ? ), 
  they * do n't * harm them , they * affect * them . 
  not being allowed to walk through new york naked affects me , but it does n't harm me either . 
  but they do n't even affect sikhs , jews , or the vast majority of muslims . 
  we 're not taling about banning all headscarfs or `` religious clothing '' , but only those that cover the face . 
  there are good reasons to ban these , beside the fact that they are always an obvious symbol for a hostile attitude toward a free society . 
  the craziest thing i know about the world :, 
  the average canadian lives further south than the average german !, 
  un - be - lievable !, 
  arrest them for what ? 
  take away their citizenship and deny them re-entry , that 's the whle point . 
  they have n't commited any crime on british ground yet , so you ca n't arrest them for anything . 
  with you 100k + retinues , mostly . 
   to add to the other suggestions , best way to give away a county if you have no family members or other courtiers to give it to , is hire a holy man and give it to him . 
  the best way is going to the character finder , search for characters of your culture and religion , male , no ruler , sort by stewardship , optionally search for content characters or some other characteristics that you want in your vassal , e.g. 
  a few guys with high martial values to be your future generals . 
  those guys make much better vassals than random holy men . 
  interestingly , they do n't ask about `` screen time '' at all , they ask how long you used the internet . 
  i stare at a computer screen at work all day , but most of that is n't really `` internet time '' . 
  i imagine this is true for most people . 
  do you commonly use the word `` dyslexie '' in dutch ? 
  because in german , we almost exclusively talk about `` legasthenie '' , and the people who have it are `` legastheniker '' . 
  but hey - the words are still idfficult to spell at least !, 
  i guess it 's strictly speaking not the same thing , but i 've never heard the word `` dyslexie '' used in german . 
  ( it exists , but i think it 's only used by medical professionals . ), 
  that 's cute . 
  but really , iran is helping against isis already , and they will continue to do so . 
  isis is much more of a threat to iran than it is to the us , after all . 
  comes from a nice mix of latin ( legere - to read ) with ancient greek ( \u1f00\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 `` asth\u00e9neia '' - weakness , impairment ) . 
  so it means `` reading weakness '' ( but is used more commonly when talking about * writing * weakness , actually ) . 
  i checked the medical background ( as far as i can easily find it ) . 
  according to the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems 10th revision , `` legasthenie '' and `` dyslexie '' are different things . 
  `` legasthenie '' ( officially called `` lese - und rechtschreibst\u00f6rung '' in german , at least by doctors ) is [ `` specific reading disorder '' , which is a specific developmental disorder of scholastic skills , see mental and behavioural disorders in the chapter about disorders of psychological development . 
  ] ( http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/f80-f89 ), 
  `` dyslexie '' is part of [ `` symptoms , signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings , not elsewhere classified '' : `` symptoms and signs involving speech and voice '' . 
  ] ( http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/r47-r49 ), 
  that 's my typical reaction as well . 
  `` something just hit my leg ? 
  - i can probably eat that ! '', 
  still cheaper without the middlemen . 
  are there any maps like this that include canada ? 
  i wonder if you can `` see '' the border in all cases . 
  there are several relevant xkcds for this , but [ i think this one is the most fitting . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/44/ ), 
  yeah , what a morron .
