  article still talks about maliki gathering his army . 
  he 's not , there are a few independent counts further north . 
  retinues . 
  you need legacy of rome to use them . 
  it 's worth it .

  as long as this is n't * too * forced on your own kid , one ond one playtime sounds like a great idea . 
  do n't worry about what exactly they do , even just watching cartoons together will help both with learning the language and bonding . 
  a small gift ( a toy or something ) sounds like a nice gesture - all kids like presents , do n't they ? 
  i ca n't really imagine his parents being offended by this , unless your present clearly makes them seem poor . 
  ( new clothes , for instance , might be somewhat risky . ), 
  but all in all , i think you do n't need to worry about that kid too much , even though it 's very nice that you do . 
  of course this is a difficult time for him , but four-year olds should usually still be able to pick up a new language quickly . 
  i just realized where the confusion stems from : you * can * swear fealty as a king , but only to your de jure emperor !, 
  just so that you also see it , i 'll post this twice :, 
  i just realized where the confusion stems from : you * can * swear fealty as a king , but only to your de jure emperor !, 
  except when talking to your de jure emperor . 
  [ example : bulgaria asking for the ere 's protection . 
  just a county , or a duchy ? 
  have you been a cook then ? 
  i imagine a lot * more * can go wrong while actually preparing the meal than while carrying it from the kitchen to the table . 
   `` god hates figs '', 
  ca n't tell if you did this on purpose ... 
  [ mark 11:12 -25 - jesus ** curses a fig tree ** and clears the temple courts ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+11%3a12-25 ), 
   seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to find out if it had any fruit . 
  when he reached it , he found nothing but leaves , because it was not the season for figs . 
   then he said to the tree , `` may no one ever eat fruit from you again . '' and his disciples heard him say it . 
  it 's * exactly the same * in your own english example . 
  the group learn ** s ** . 
  the people learn . 
  explain this to me , and i shall copy your explanation !, 
  ok , you 're probably joking . 
  but i 'm always happy when someone explains complicated american football clips to me , so here 's my explanation of this scene :, 
  this goal did n't count . 
  the header that got past the goalkeeper would have gone in , of course , and that would have been a goal . 
  but then the other green ( nigerian ) player kicked it into the goal unnecessarily . 
  this would n't normally be a problem , but in this case , the player was offside , so the goal does n't count anymore . 
  ( she was offside because the moment that the header was played , she was closer to the german goal than any of the german defenders . 
  the details of this rule are a bit more complicated , but they do n't matter in this case . ), 
  if the ball had already crossed the line completely , the goal should have counted . 
  you are right that it looks like it did , although it 's very hard to tell . 
  completely impossible to tell for the referee , of course - and interestingly , even the modern goal line technology would n't help in this case . 
  as a sidenote , it 's enough if the player who is offside did n't even touch the ball , but was distracting the goalkeeper . 
  if i were the referee and someone proved to me that the ball crossed the line before # 7 touched it , that 's the story i 'd go with . 
  the relevant information is that davos himself is not included in that number . 
  because of his missing fingertips , he only counts as 0.997 men . 
  germany 's biggest newspaper ( bild ) had a girl like that on the frontpage every day until a few years ago . 
  it was a huge step for them to move the titties to page three at least . 
  this is the first time i heard of this , and now i * want one * !, 
  shopping without your own scanner feels so primitive !, 
  i do n't know why people in this thread are even discussing these numbers . 
  obvious nonsense is obvious , there * is * no way this is true . 
  because you will already look like a madman for throwing potatos in hydrogen peroxide and claiming that you 're * creating water * . 
  talking sternly to the bowl while you do this is gon na get you institutionalized . 
  i 'm sitting right next to a world map , and this thread is starting to feel like neck gymnastics . 
  closest to africa is maine - `` really ? '', 
  * looks over to the map * `` interesting ... '' * looks back at screen *, 
  sahara far north of equator - `` that does n't sound right . '', 
  - * checks map * - * back to screen *, 
  brazil half-way between america and europe - `` ok , now they 're just fucking with me '' * checks map * `` daaaamn ... '', 
  given that billiard balls are smoother than pancakes , i reckon this must actually be true about most states and most countries . 
  i had to see a video of this , and i actually found two . 
  both of them are quite horrible , but it kind of makes me happy how one of them [ shows that this is not true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvypl6qrjlk ) , while the other one [ shows that it is . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzehoj785s4 ), 
  ultimately , it seems to depend on the exact equipment you are using , but it is always very close . 
  getting two balls through one hoop at the same time should in most cases be possible , although in some cases you 'll have to compress the balls a little . 
  damn ... 
  i 'm at work now ; i read this and immediately looked over at where the world map should be - only to discover that i 'm sitting right next to a wall and was staring at the wallpaper . 
  ( the map is at my home , of course ... ), 
  i think this one is actually the most bs sounding geography fact in this thread . 
  just for the record : i found your notation system very intuitive and clear . 
  for the past few months , you can be certain that isis has * gained * more fighter than they have lost . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  i come from one of the many parts of the world where people do n't use checks anymore , so i barely understand * normal * checks . 
  but what 's the use in writing yourself a check , and why would you simply put a date ten years in the future on it ? 
  is time travel involved , or is this really just `` note to self : become rich by 2024 '' ? 
  nope , not at all . 
  supporters of the `` moderate '' rebel groups have been accusing assad since the beginning of the conflict that this was his strategy : beat down on the `` moderates '' until there is only a choice between sunni extremists on the one side and assad on the other . 
  that 's the point where we are now . 
  at this point , there is virtually zero chance of assad losing , because that would mean that the extremists win . 
  assad does n't have to fear foreign intervention anymore , and the rebels have no chance of `` winning he hearts and minds '' of the majority of the people anymore . 
  those would have been the two biggest dangers for assad , and he does n't have to worry about them anymore . 
  also , isis has n't really made * any * advances into assad 's territories yet . 
  they have attacked a few isolated army bases in the middle of their own zone of control , and that 's it . 
  i 'm so happy it * was n't * a `` smackdown '' . 
  there 's a chance she ( and others like her ) will actually listen to her over the course of the semester , and boy , would they learn something . 
  had he just told her how stupid that question is , there 's no chance he would have gotten through to her . 
  with a group as large as 250 fighters , the government would be more likely to negotiate a truce than actually take them all prisoner . 
  they give up their heavy weapons , and everybody goes home . 
  example : [ babila ] ( http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/middle-east/2014/feb-18/247680-syria-army-rebels-agree-new-damascus-truce.ashx#axzz3bgzeaiqg ), 
  smaller groups are certainly imprisoned . 
  i have no idea how they treat foreigners that they capture . 
  i 'll try my best .
