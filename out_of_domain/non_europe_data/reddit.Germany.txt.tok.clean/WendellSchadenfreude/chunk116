  assad is not a nice guy . 
  but we know ( from decades of experience ) that he wants to rule the people of syria regardless of their ethnicity or religions - as long as you do n't threaten his rule , assad typically does n't kill you . 
  that 's not exactly much by western standards , but in a conflict with isis & co , it 's clearly enough to make him the good guy . 
  that 's still non-creepy unless she 's a mindreader . 
  i like this explanation , i just want to explain one additional point : people with little knowledge in genetics will often be surprised why you would expect a random person to be the carrier of a ( recessive ) genetic defect vor illness . 
  since most of us are healthy , it sounds like inbreeding should be safe for most of us ( albeit weird ) . 
  but in fact , we all carry gene defects , even fatal ones ( if expressed ) , and more than just one . 
  this is because humans ( like other animals ) usually have very * good * genes , so almost any random mutation is harmful . 
  over hundreds of generations , harmful mutations can easily accumulate , because they are recessive , so they are not expressed and do n't harm their carriers . 
  fatal mutations * have to be * recessive , or they go extinct immediately by killing off their carriers . 
  most of these potentially harmful mutations did n't happen in * your * genome - they happened many generations ago and have ( silently ) been in your family ever since . 
  when you have kids with a non-relative , you pass on your genetic defects , but they still are n't expressed and do n't matter . 
  when you have kids with a close relative , all your own crap mutations get a chance to shine . 
  you have a 50 % chance of passing on your bad gene , and so does your sister . 
  it will only be expressed if you both do , so there 's a 25 % chance of having an exploding toddler . 
  50 % of the time , the child will be healthy ( with respect to this gene ) , but a carrier like yourself and your sister-wife . 
  25 % of the time , the child inherits two healthy versions of this gene . 
  `` dominant '' does * not * mean that this is the gene that will be passed on , it only means that this is the gene that will be * expressed * . 
  two people with black hair can have a blond child , if they both have one `` black '' and one `` blond '' gene and both happen to pass on the `` blond '' version . 
  i 'm afraid that question is out of my league . 
  i * think * that the answer is n't always the same , that you could either have one gene that is basically `` more recessive '' or that both genes would be expressed - but honestly , i do n't know this . 
  ( the `` blond '' gene , for instance , basically means `` no pigments in the hairs '' , so any alternative that puts pigments there will be expressed . ), 
  in theory , yes . 
  but as i said earlier : almost any random mutation ( that does anything ) will be harmful . 
  normal braincells are already pretty damn good , so changing them is far more likely to cause catastrophic failure than it is too improve their performance . 
  and this would only be one of your recessive mutations - the child would likely get a superbrain , but also die in infancy from defects in half a dozen unrelated genes . 
  in theory , yes . 
  ( as long as you only map `` your genes '' in general instead of analyzing one individual sperm or egg cell , you of course only have a 50 % of knowing which version of a gene you will pass on . ), 
  this is in fact already done for some diseases - if you have a family background , you and your partner can get tested to see if your children would have a high chance of being ill . a group in which this seems to be done almost routinely are askenazi jews . 
  [ one link here ] ( https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/health/genetics.html ) , relevant [ wikipedia article here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medical_genetics_of_jews ) . 
  another good read on this topic is the article on [ cystic fibrosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cystic_fibrosis#epidemiology ) . 
  they do n't test all your genes though , they only look at a few specific locations for very spcific diseases . 
  currently , we ca n't do much more , because we do n't know more about genetics yet . 
  and you are correct : many of the mutations you carry are specific to a single one of your ancestors ( in whom this mutation originally occured ) and those of his descendants who inherited the mutated gene , so even if you `` find '' them , you ca n't ( with current technology ) know what they would do if expressed . 
  i 'll just copy what i replied to somebody else 's related question :, 
  this ( testing , not `` fixing '' ) is in fact already done for some diseases - if you have a family background , you and your partner can get tested to see if your children would have a high chance of being ill . a group in which this seems to be done almost routinely are askenazi jews .

  with current technology , we ca n't really `` remove bad genes from a person '' . 
  but if you read the article on cystic fibrosis , it contains a paragraph on gene therapy , which is a first step in that direction . 
  true . 
  i meant `` fatal '' in the sense of `` fatal in infancy '' - i was on mobile and too lazy to go into this in more detail . 
  your guardian reacts to seeing you exit the dungeons with a bloody knife in hand - they will decide to either `` teach you some useful tricks '' or to `` show you the right way '' . 
  this either gives you a trait like cruel in the former case , or a trait like kind in the latter . 
  now i feel horibble for writing a useless comment that did n't contribute at all . 
  oh wait , that was n't me . 
  if the mutation is not present in the child 's siblings or other relatives , then it 's gone forever as soon as the child 's parents die . 
  the child itself did not inherit this mutation even as a recessive trait , so it ca n't pass it on to future generations either . 
  do n't worry though , the child will have plenty of other ( recessive ) genetic defects . 
  i easily spotted the detail that op meant this time , but i still find it annoying that op was too lazy to open the image in paint and add a big red arrow to it . 
  when your post title is completely ambiguous like this one , * show us what you 're talking about * in the picture !, 
  [ the pope in the screenshot is a karling .

  i do n't get what 's supposed to be funny about this . 
  the people calling the priest would be the people in the hospital after going through your wallet . 
  as an atheist , i hope that every catholic who ever is at the brink of death gets a chance to talk to a priest . 
  not because i believe that it will do them any good in an afterlife , but because it 's what they hope for . 
  most of us hope that our families would be present if we are in intensive care and possibly close to death . 
  devout catholics hope to see their families * and * a priest , and i do n't see what 's wrong with that . 
  this card is simply a good idea . 
  if i found a card like this on a person having an emergency , i 'd call a priest ( * after * calling 911 , obviously ) . 
  it sounds like she may be interested , but asking your roommate out is a risky move even * if * she is interested . 
  booking in person is more expensive . 
  3 suitcases + handbags sounds like quite a lot for 2 senior citizens to handle . 
  there 's nobody who 's officially tasked with helping with your luggage . 
  if it 's possible , traveling with fewer bags would certainly be easier for them . 
  definitely reserve seats . 
  as others mentioned : use bahn.de . 
  you can buy the tickets there ( with e.g. 
  credit card payment ) , they can send you the ticket as a pdf for you the print out . 
  you also reserve seats on the same homepage . 
  if they arrive in frankfurt by plane , a lot can go wrong and cause large delays . 
  in that case , i would recommend either a large layover time in frankfurt , or buying tickets at `` normalpreis '' - these are more expensive , but they are also valid in later trains . 
  if you buy `` sparangebote ) tickets , they are only valid for the one specific connection - if you miss your train , you have to buy a new ticket . 
  [ that still sounds sexy ... ] ( http://xkcd.com/1082/ ), 
  [ geology is not a science , it 's an adventure .

  yes it can . 
  i 'd say it 's used usually to describe a person 's current behaviour rather than their character .

  since we 're discussing marriage definitions , let 's ask oscar wilde : `` bigamy is having one wife too many .

   wallah, 
  at first , i thought this was just the worst spelling of `` voil\u00e0 '' i had ever seen - i 'm so relieved you were [ actually using arabic ] (,

  his ambition , by the way , is * not * `` become a paragon of virtue '' , although it looks like that . 
  it 's really simply `` become visible . '', 
  i mean , that 's why he 's wearing clothes in the first place . 
  people in this land of the invisible sometimes go out naked so that their clothes do n't give away their position . 
  but most of the time , a misunderstood sense of decency makes them wear clothes because it feels so * wrong * not to wear them . 
  bishop patrick 's liege , the invisible king , once solved that problem by borrowing the barely used clothes of an emperor friend of his . 
  the war was fought over the correct spelling of the word basileus/basileios . 
  in the end , they settled for basilexs . 
  oh , this is important information . 
  i was hoping for one mention of a solar ecplise - those would be impossible if the moon does n't revolve around the planet . 
  but they are not mentioned , so it 's possible that this moon is stationary ( in planetos ' frame of reference ) . 
  i think you are right , if the moon and the sun are always in the same places relative to the planet , tides should happen at the same time every day . 
  ( just so you know * somebody * got that reference . ),
