  you guys know what a [ `` jamais vu '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jamais_vu ) is ? 
  it 's when you are in a common situation that you 've experienced many times , but it * feels * like something you 've never seen before . 
  for instance , you might see a word like `` d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu '' , which you have seen a hundred times - but all of a sudden , you do n't know if you 've * ever * seen it with the accents , and it just looks * wrong * somehow ... 
  you can have kings as vassals . 
  others have mentioned this already , but i think nobody explained the * major * advantage that this gives you : you can press other people 's claim for a kingdom , and if you do it right , that kingdom becomes part of your empire . 
  invite claimant , declare war to press his claim , bring you warscore up to 100 % , give the claimant some land ( a barony is enough ) so that he is your vassal , enforce demands , done . 
  for christian rulers , this is one of the fastest possible ways to expand . 
  the papacy is also a king-level title , which means that you can vassalize the pope when you are an emperor . 
  simply set up an anti-pope , press his claim , done . 
  after that , ask him for additional claims against your neighbours . 
  i doubt that america would ( officially ) send anyone to saudi-arabia , that would just be too embarassing for the regime . 
  saudi-arabia has hired pakistani army units in the past and would do so again . 
  the psychological effect of isis in sa would still be immense , but i think their biggest problem is * getting there * . 
  there 's only dessert between the land they control and the saudi border , but there 's a lot of that !, 
  a large convoy driving 500 km ( ! ), 
  over open land would be target practice for the iraqi and us airforce . 
  he 's not . 
  he was born in germany , but that does n't make you german . 
  america uses a strict [ ius soli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) , i.e. 
  every person born on american soil has a right to american citizenship . 
  germany did n't use this principle at all when tosh was born ( and uses a very restricted version of it nowadays ) . 
  german parents would make you german , but i think tosh 's family is american . 
   [ you were born in germany , and moved to florida . 
  do you speak german ? 
  ] ( http://www.independent.com/news/2010/apr/21/daniel-tosh-interview/ ), 
  my parents were having sex in europe and gave birth to me there . 
  i grew up in florida and went to school there , and ended up going to university of central florida . 
  you are probably more german than daniel tosh . 
  if you should become a famous comedian , i still would n't really consider you a great example for german humor just because of your genetic heritage . 
  [ no land submarines you say ? 
  you [ ai n't seen much ] ( http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/ga/gastmsub_bob2.jpg ) then . 
  that 's not a terrible heir . 
  he 's honest , humble , temperate , brave , and has no negative traits , so all vassals will like him well enough . 
  if you simply mean `` i need a beer ( now ) '' , `` ich brauche ( jetzt ) ein bier '' is a more elegant translation . 
  deciding wether to use - ie - or - ei - is much easier in german than in english : - ie - is pronounced like - * ee * - in english , - ei - is pronounced like the `` ay '' in * ay caramba * . 
  the us helped others more . 
  for instance , the famous [ marshall plan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) money mostly went to former american allies . 
  ( i 'm not complaining - it 's surprising enough that the us decided to help germany * at all * . ), 
  now that is just cruel . 
  / u/reallyclevermoniker , not / r. 
  he might have been extremely jealous of her . 
  hitler had very bad teeth , some 15 ( ! ), 
  of them had to be extracted during his time as a soldier in the first world war . 
  what kind of nonsense article is this ? 
   the united states is said to have been discussing a no-fly zone over syria in an effort to stop islamic state of iraq and the levant . 
  isis does n't have an air force . 
  they captured some planes , but are apparantly unable to use them . 
  a no-fly zone would obviously be a move against the only faction that actually has an airforce , i.e. 
  the government forces . 
  why does nobody mention the doctor 's name , [ ignaz semmelweis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignaz_semmelweis ) ? 
  i think your comparison to `` alien magic '' is unfair . 
  sure , semmelweis did not know a mechanism by which better hygiene prevented childbed fever . 
  but his suggestion that doctors should wash their hands in chlorine solutions between patients could easily have been implemented everywhere to confirm ( or repudiate ) his results . 
  a better comparison might be a modern doctor finding that a flu shot cures patients suffering from leukemia - we would have no idea * how * this works , but doctors should damn well better test if it * does work * . 
  of course , you are right that semmelweis was not institutionalized directly for his medical ideas , but for depression and other actual mental issues . 
   so it 's not being clinically tested, 
  do you mean `` it 's * now * being clinically tested '' ? 
  the problem with the majority of doctors in semmelweis ' time was that they did * not * test his handwashing suggestion . 
  easy . 
  the only reason the product is manufactured somewhere else in the first place is that it 's cheaper to do so . 
  when you 're not allowed to produce it the cheapest way anymore , the price has to go up . 
  you can only make a married woman a concubine if she is in your prison . 
  so this probably means that the woman was plotting against someone , and was arrested for it by the king . 
  either that , or you missed how your son started a private war against the king , with his wife being captured at some point . 
  iirc , the main problem is that your vassals do n't help you out . 
  usually , your counts and dukes will do a lot of converting for you , but jewish ai rulers do n't care about this and do n't send their court rabbis proselytizing . 
  there probably is , although this is n't really a bug . 
  jews are meant not to care about converting other people , because they historically did n't ( and still do n't ) . 
  you first have to find a mod that goes back into the bcs . 
  ( interesting link , never heard of that . ), 
  possibly quite logical . 
  `` people who have these scars never get smallpox again . 
  ( this had been known for centuries at least . ), 
  maybe having the scars actually protect from smallpox even if you have n't actually * had * smallpox before , you * only * take some of the scars from somebody else . 
  `` ok , rubbing the scab material on people 's skin has n't made them sick , but it does n't seem to protect them either . 
  maybe we need to * go deeper * . 
  `` drinking dissolved scabs did n't work either . 
  are we out of options now ? 
  oh , wait - we could powderize the scabs and make suppositories from the powder . 
  `` suppositories did n't do anything , damnit !, 
  but wait , since we already have this powder , how about snorting it ? '', 
   6 million acres . 
  for europeans : that 's about 24,000 km \u00b2 . 
  quite exactly the size of sicily , or a bit smaller than belgium ( at around 30,000 km \u00b2 ) . 
  i wonder if there ever was a time when old teachers claimed that kids had become * better * over the course of their careers . 
  do you by any chance remember the teachers who were old when you started teaching , and what they said about 1990 's kids as compared to 1960 's / 1970 's kids ? 
  [ german , 30 years old ], 
  i never actually learned much about the * war * in school . 
  a lot about how the nazis came into power , about the persecution of jews , communists , etc. , about the concentration camps , also about some german resistance groups . 
  about the war itself , we were taught very clearly that germany started it , but not much else - we kind of jumped to the post-war history after that . 
  i believe this is mostly because they try not to teach * military * history , so battles and campaigns are mostly avoided in general .
