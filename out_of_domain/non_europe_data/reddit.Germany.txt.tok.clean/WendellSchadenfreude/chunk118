  probably because they think it breeds militarism . 
  or simply because they believe that battles are n't that important for understanding history . 
  - to an extent , i agree with that , although i think it goes too far if you do n't really hear anything about any battles in school . 
  for comparison , angela merkel is at 77 % . 
  [ i 'm not sure if this number is directly comparable . 
  thanks . 
  the topic of battles is avoided in general , not just german defeats . 
  if anything , german victories are avoided even more than german defeats . 
   more of a historical enemy than the nazi party to germany, 
  i do n't think that comparison makes much sense , i 'm quite sure it was never made in my school . 
  if you asked today 's germans on the street `` who 's worse , the nazis or the russians '' , you 'd get close to 100 % saying that nazis are worse . 
  i ca n't remember hearing much about this at school , but germans are still aware that the russian soldiers in germany committed severe crimes , especially mass-rape . 
  ( when this is discussed anywhere , you can be quite certain that the crimes committed by german soldiers in russia will also be mentioned , but it does always sound as if the germans * killed * many people , while the russians * raped * many people . 
  i 'm not sure if the relative numbers of killing and raping were historically really so different . ), 
   racial inequality is why we dropped the atomic bombs on japan and not germany . 
  germany was already defeated when the bomb became available . 
  germany was the target they had in mind when the manhattan project was started , and given how much germany * was * in fact bombed , i find the claim absurd that the us would not have used the atomic bomb against germany if it had been possible and useful . 
  depends on where in germany you are . 
  in most of germany , no disinfectants are added to the drinking water regularly . 
  in some regions , disinfectants are regularly used . 
  it 's rarely chlorine , but chlorine dioxide or chloramine . 
  even where these are used , the concentrations are much lower then the ones usually used in the us . 
  yes we do .

  calcium hypochlorite , chlorine , chlorine dioxide , sodium hypochlorite , and ozone are allowed as drinking water disinfectants in germany . 
  in many parts of germany , they are n't regularly used , and when they are used , the concentrations are still much lower than what you 'll find in the us , but they certainly are legal . 
  weird taste can have many reasons , but a different chlorine concentration than you 're used to is definitely one of them . 
  the chlorine wo n't harm you at the concentrations they put in drinking water . 
  bigger problem in italy might be that they do n't ( or did n't ) use * enough * chlorine - microbial contamination of the water is much more dangerous for you than a little chlorine . 
   the lines are bled, 
  what does this mean ? 
  you are right that in most parts of germany , desinfectants are n't regularly used , and when they are used , the concentrations are still much lower than what you 'll find in the us , but they certainly are legal .

  calcium hypochlorite , chlorine , chlorine dioxide , sodium hypochlorite , and ozone are allowed as drinking water disinfectants in germany . 
  and lots of other additives are also allowed ( e.g. 
  for regulating the ph ) . 
  this thread offers a great opportunity to switch to using a different , more fitting word . 
  biased , partial , partisan , those are all words that clearly mean what you are trying to say . 
  i would also strongly object to being called `` sectarian '' , although i sure do n't have a neutral , disinterested view on this conflict . 
  would you really use `` sectarian '' to describe people who clearly support one side in the ukrainian conflict ? 
  ( if you search / ukrainianconflict for `` sectarian '' , you get * one * result . 
  in here , you get hundreds . ), 
  do you have a reason for clinging to this particular term when there are others that are more precise and less offensive ? 
  there * are * groups in this conflict that are clearly sectarian in the literal sense of the word - isis for instance is fighting for one specific sect and will kill or oppress all others . 
  other groups * do n't * do this , and calling them and their supporters sectarian is confusing at best . 
   when assad makes deals with isis, 
  examples for such deals ? 
  but m.resident does n't support one specific sect . 
  ( i assume . ), 
  the government is not a sect . 
  and clearly , these `` synonyms '' do n't mean the same in all contexts , else you could also describe supporters of the government as * separatists * . 
  granted , the word is ** most commonly ** used in the non-literal sense , because there are no literal sectarians in most contexts . 
  when you describe a us politician as sectarian , it is clear that you do n't mean he literally wants to oppress all but the members of his own denomination . 
  when you use the word to describe a syrian , this is n't clear at all . 
  i 'm just confused * why * you keep using the word in this sense even after you already had to clarify it multiple times - this would * never * be necessary when using `` biased '' or `` factional '' . 
   i do n't know if the culture can change in the years outside of its ` average zone ' . 
  it 's possible via some events . 
  `` civilized peasants '' definitely , and i think your vassals can also have the `` get some of the boys from back home '' event . 
  not all that common , but not extremely rare either . 
  you will sometimes see a county switching to your culture and religion within only a few years after the conquest . 
   actually the reason it wasnt stable is pretty simple , there was no way to predict how stable a ship would be at the time . 
  so did other nations at the time also have big ships that sank as soon as they saw water ? 
  ( inb4 titanic , that does n't count . ), 
  the wasa is the only example i ever heard of , so i suppose this was n't a problem that simply could not have been avoided at the time . 
  from a quick look at wikipedia : the ships seem to be mostly comparable in that they made interesting wrecks . 
  the mr sank after 33 years of service and several wars . 
  quote from wiki however :, 
   the excavation and salvage of the mary rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology , comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the swedish 17th-century warship vasa in 1961 .

  if you 're not playing in ironman mode , you can of course simply use cheat codes to end the war . 
  ( i think if you cheat-grant them a province ( e.g. 
  the maldives ... ) and then grant it back to the former owner , this should be enough that the game considers the invasion to have been repelled . 
  they wo n't come back after that . ), 
  i find this is one of the most annoying things in the game - my sons ' wives constantly `` fancy me '' . 
  the best thing from a gameplay perspective is usually shagging them , of course , because it might give you better children/grandchildren - especially since these women usually have very good traits . 
  but if i wanted messed-up family trees , i 'd play zoroastrian characters . 
  edit : geter 's suggestion is actually much easier . 
  although i 'm not sure if that will make the aztecs go away , maybe their stacks will just linger in europe forever . 
  it 's not an uncommon term . 
  got any source on that ? 
  it does n't sound like selling tobacco , sugar , and cotton in europe would have been such a bad business idea . 
  many people here play with all kinds of mods , many of which can give you higher stats . 
  i ( like most players ) try to maximize diplomacy . 
  i 've had a few characters at ~ 30 , but certainly not many . 
  26 is already pretty damn good . 
  all religions have some specific events and mechanisms that have some influence on stats , but i do n't think it makes a big difference overall . 
  educate your own heir , marry for genetic traits , that 's about it . 
  maybe you 're trying to make a joke or to make a point , but anyway : this is wrong , `` by yourself '' in german never is ~ ~ beim selbst ~ ~ , it 's `` allein ( e ) '' or `` ohne hilfe '' . 
  when a heavily armed group of people ( isis ) is killing an unarmed or badly armed group of people , arming the victims is n't necessarily a bad idea . 
  the berlin wall was always meant to keep people in , from its first day to its last . 
  unlikely . 
  these people do n't just jump on a boat in guinea or sierra leone and sail all the way to europe , they travel by land to the north african mediterranean countries first . 
  africa is big ; if you 're suffering from ebola , you 're not gon na make it from liberia to the tunisian or libyian coast . 
  [ map of the current ebola outbreak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ebola_virus_epidemic_in_west_africa#mediaviewer/file:2014_ebola_virus_epidemic_in_west_africa.png ) - it 's not like everybody in africa has ebola or is at risk of catching it . 
  what is your first language ? 
  learning the case system in a new language is difficult for anyone , it takes a lot of practice to get it right - that 's still true when your own language has a similar system . 
  but if you do n't speak any language with such a system yet , even just getting a feeling for what this is all about might take a while . 
  they did not ; they were trying to get * out * . 
  from east to west germany , that is .
