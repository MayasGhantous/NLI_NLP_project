   is my diplomacy poor ? 
  it is not . 
  9 for me, 
  so your diplomacy ** is ** poor . 
   do these dukes just hate me ? 
  they do n't . 
  one of them even has a 100 opinion of me , and none are negative . 
  after two decades , why do n't all of them have 100 opinion of you ? 
  your elector dukes are important , keep them happy . 
   i can even switch the succession laws to agnatic to spare us any confusion . 
  i do so . 
  ** whyyy ** ? 
  why on * earth * would you do that ? 
  your son only has daughters , so now he has no heirs at all anymore , and you changed succession laws for absolutely no reason - you know your vassals do n't like that , right ? 
   killed in fucking battle . 
  yep . 
  now i 'm my daughter . 
  which is to say , one of them , because the laws of the duchy of valois ? 
  still gavelkind . 
  if you ca n't afford your ruler getting killed in battle , you should n't let him lead troops . 
  easy as that . 
  as you describe it , you could have easily won the war , and then there would have been no problem . 
  ( except for the fact that you could not have voted for your own children to inherit your kingdom , because you switched to agnatic ... ), 
  i play elective monarchy whenever possible . 
  i ca n't even remember the last time i lost an important title in the elections . 
  thinking about switching away from it because it just makes the game too easy . 
  totally ruins the game for me . 
  the problem is not that seniority is unbalanced . 
  consolidating all your dinasty 's lands can be worth the short reign penalties . 
  the problem is that you no longer feel like you 're playing ck2 . 
  at every succession , you 're suddenly an old man you 've never seen before . 
  you do n't care about his children or the rest of his family . 
  you maybe are of a different culture than you were a moment ago . 
  you ca n't get used to him , because he 's an old man and likely to die any moment now . 
  the big problem : it 's near impossible to get out of it - you need a ruler to stay in power for 10 years , but all of them die within two or three years instead . 
  i guess seniority can be fun when your dinasty is still small , so that you already know your heir . 
  but once has 100 + members , it 's just not fun anymore . 
   unless by `` in '' you mean inside east germany , which completely surrounded the city and was thus outside the berlin wall, 
  there was a wall ( or guarded fence at least ) not only in berlin , but along the entire border between the `` german democratic republic '' ( east ) and the federal republic of germany ( west ) . 
  the wall had been built by the east to keep their own people * in the east * , not to keep foreigners from entering the east . 
  granted , western berlin being a part of western germany that was surrounded by the east makes the in-out-terminology somewhat confusing . 
  see my other comment . 
  the point is : the east build a wall to keep people * in the east * . 
  ( there was n't a wall * only * in berlin , the entire border to the west was sealed off . ), 
  west berlin as an enclave within the east makes it somewhat confusing to talk simply about `` in '' and `` out '' , but the wall was still built to keep people from * leaving * the state , not to keep them from * entering * . 
  [ three million square miles of desert , for a start . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahara ), 
  the distance between liberia and tunisia is greater than the distance between mexico and canada . 
  just as the distance between liberia and france , or germany , or the usa . 
  so why would ebola come to tunisia by plane and then come to europe by refugee boat ? 
  * there is no ebola in tunisia/libya/algeria . 
   and no muslim body outside syria/iraq has recognized isis as part of islam .

  and as for indonesia : i ca n't find an official declaration of support from any `` muslim body '' ( only by individuals such as [ this founder of jemaah islamiyah ] ( http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/world/2014/aug-05/266107-indonesia-preacher-pledges-allegiance-to-isis.ashx#axzz3dybpls7y ) ) , but it 's not like they [ have no support ] ( http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/14/with-iraq-gains-isis-finds-traction-with-indonesian-hard-liners.html ) . 
  most of these are n't simply `` recognition as part of islam '' , they are actual oaths of allegiance . 
  you need to have an organized religion , then you can also try to convert the heathens . 
  so , if you 're playing norse , you first need to reform the faith . 
   bet you could send a duke, 
  ... damn ... 
  i 'm so embarassed now because i never thought of that . 
  instead of plotting against your dukes or spending thousands on assassinating them , simply make them your court chaplain and send them to the vikings - this is an almost guaranteed death sentence until about 1000 ad . 
  you were previously claiming that nobody recognizes them as part of islam , not that nobody accepts their claim of being the legitimate caliphate . 
  but in fact , as i said : most of the links i provided already were to articles about groups outside syria/iraq that * did * pledge allegiance to isis ' caliph . 
  yes , and i 'm providing links to abu sayyaf , tehreek-e-khilafat , the mujahedeen shura council in the environs of jerusalem , sabiri 's jamaat , aqim , and an unnamed lebanese group . 
  those are n't recruits , those are organizations , aka `` muslim bodies '' , recognizing isis not only as part of islam , but as the legitimate leadership of islam . 
  i 'm pretty sure it goes a few steps * further * than just recognizing them as part of islam . 
  you claim that `` no muslim body outside syria/iraq has recognized isis as part of islam '' - what do you mean by that claim if it 's so easy to find muslim groups from different parts of the world who obviously * do * recognize isis as part of islam ? 
  all these groups do n't count , because they not only recognize isis as part of islam , but actually go far beyond that ? 
  he 's absolutely right though . 
  this is n't something * you * should be blamed for - you were just being a nice person to people you respect , and you were even getting something out of it . 
  but this is in fact small-scale corruption , and the less of it exists , the better . 
  just ask yourself : would you be entirely comfortable learning that the burgerking next to your mcdonald 's gives the police free food * and * pays one of the officers $ 5 every day that he comes in ? 
  five bucks is something the bk can easily afford , and it 's not like this is really gon na make the officer treat that restaurant any different from yours , is it ? 
  it 's not like i would want to discharge an officer from the force for accepting a free coffee , or punish a restaurant manager for giving it to him - but in an ideal police force , the officers would * never * receive or accept any gifts on duty . 
   when it finally got to internal affairs , one lied and one did n't . 
  they both got fired . 
  were they treated any differently at all ? 
  i think losing your job over a stolen pack of beer ( if this is the first time he fucked up ) is a harsh punishment ; but * only * losing your job for stealing * and * obstructing the internal investigation is n't hard enough . 
  i guess the most interesting things will be improved mechanics for culture changes and for nomadic tribes . 
  - i 'm looking forward to this . 
  i also get the feeling that they are planning on having multiple storytelling events for the early karling rulers . 
  playing as one of them might feel more like campaign-mode than the `` open world '' that you normally have in ck2 . 
  this could be interesting as well . 
  ( i might be reading to much into this . 
  i 'm judging from only a few events that you could see in screenshots in an earlier story about this release . ), 
  yes is just so much more * exciting * . 
  it 's a choice between `` nothing changes , business as usual '' and `` wow , this is totally new '' . 
  as a sideline watcher who is n't really affected either way , i kind of hope for the `` yes '' , just to see what happens next . 
  of course , for the people who * are * affected , this should not be the most convincing argument . 
  * do you * really know how to make gunpowder ? 
  without asking wikipedia ? 
  i know it 's something with charcoal and sulphur and something else . 
  there was something about bird shit in there , but i do n't really remember the details of that . 
  producing anything that goes * boom * would probably take me decades at least . 
  it might be much easier for you , but even when you have some primitive gunpowder - you do n't have a gun . 
  how do you build the first guns in a way that they actually become useful tools within a single lifetime ?
