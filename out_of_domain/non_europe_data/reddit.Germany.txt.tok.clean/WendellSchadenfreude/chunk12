  friend of dave 's . 
  although , if you are a non-prescriptivist , you might argue that saying `` a friend of dave '' is quite common and not entirely absurd , so it might also be considered correct . 
  [ wikipedia knows . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oath_of_allegiance_%28united_states%29 ), 
   [ some regulation ] provides that the phrase `` so help me god '' is optional and that the words ` on oath ' can be substituted with ` and solemnly affirm ' . 
  the oath of allegiance , not to be confused with the pledge of a. :, 
   i hereby declare , on oath , that i absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince , potentate , state , or sovereignty of whom or which i have heretofore been a subject or citizen ; that i will support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states of america against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; that i will bear arms on behalf of the united states when required by the law ; that i will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the united states when required by the law ; that i will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law ; and that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion ; so help me god . 
  short story -  pr\u00e4teritum . 
  that 's all there is to say about this . 
  ( sorry for the late answer . ), 
  as a first step , maybe you can go to lutheran services instead of the catholic mass ? 
  with your mother being lutheran , your dad ca n't really object to that ( or if he does , you have an ally at least ) . 
  if you have to discuss this with him ( sounds quite likely ) , you might already tell him that you e.g. 
  do n't believe the pope is special in any way , and tell him you want to learn about different christian denominations . 
  - you have to know if this might already be enough for him to kick you out , but it does n't seem likely . 
  this would be a careful first step : you already disagree with his religion , but you do n't have to come out as an * evil , godless atheist * yet . 
  overall , i agree with the consensus here : try not to get kicked out , fake it until you make your own money ( or move out for other reasons ) . 
  just one more thing i want to add : *** even if *** your dad does kick you out someday , this is not the world 's end . 
  you will survive , and you will someday find your place in life where you do n't have to hide your beliefs ( or lack thereof ) from anyone . 
  oh my , you americans sure talk funny sometimes . 
  greetings to you , too !, 
  depends . 
  has he unwittingly rejected you personally , or just a few of your close friends ? 
  he still cries in the shower till this day . 
  and he deserves it . 
  everybody speaks prime numbers . 
  that is so sad ... 
  i have to assume your planet was destroyed at this point . 
  but at least your civilization went out with a nice twin prime on its mind . 
  bran would know benjen . 
  even hodor would know benjen . 
  ( though he 'd call him `` hodor '' . ), 
  i do n't think this was supposed to be anyone of importance . 
  this chapter actually bothered me quite a bit , because i think that liddle is far too well informed about everything no matter who he is . 
  but i think that 's just a mistake by grrm . 
  you masturbate fuhreriously in the shower , i know . 
  i do n't understand why most people here are being mean . 
  of course you can be atheist and spiritual . 
  sam harris writes a lot about this ; [ go read his blog ] ( http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/a-plea-for-spirituality ) . 
  his most recents posts are about near-death experiences , so it 's what you 're searching for for two reasons . 
  i think the bottom line about ndes is this : drawing conclusions about the nature of the entire universe from your personal experience ( that you had in a situation when your brain was definitely not working properly ) is a bad idea . 
  but still : you can be an atheist and a spiritual person . 
  now , to have some fun : `` saying ` i 'm not religious , but spiritual ' is like saying ` i 'm not stupid , but almost . ' '', 
  - some comedian , i forgot who . 
  '' ` i 'm not religious , but i 'm spiritual . ', 
  i like to reply with ` i 'm not honest , but you 're interesting ! ' '', 
  [ i 'm not serious about these quotations . 
  i just think they 're funny . ], 
  this is an / r/atheism classic ; and it 's a mostly pointless discussion . 
  most people in the world who describe themselves as buddhists are without any doubt religious about this . 
  but you can follow buddha 's teachings ( or at least most of them - i 'm not sure ) without having to belief in anything supernatural .

  edit : i 'm pretty sure i sound like a sam harris fanboy by now . 
  if i do n't , maybe i have to try harder . 
  i asked google and bing to retranslate it , and it still does n't make much sense ; but i 'm guessing :, 
  a return blazes not how shall we do ? 
  = there 's no need to hurry with the return shipment , how shall we procede ? 
  the biggest guess here is that he used `` blaze '' to translate * brennen * , literally * to burn * , which might be used to say that something is urgent . 
  it 's not really correct , but it might be used that way . 
  does n't have to be ; * comrad * already posted a link explaining that . 
  did you tap in the direction of tau ceti ? 
  poor confused bot . 
  it really says :, 
  - and i shit you not, 
  - this fucking *** eagle *** just comes out of nowhere ... 
  the inscription `` bier lieb u. lied macht nie lebensm\u00fcd ' '' means `` nice bear and a song never make you weary of life '' ; similar `` bier u. frohes lied ... '' = `` beer and a happy song ... '', 
  is it really a flock , though , or rather a murder ? 
  a team ? 
  oh my , i never tire of [ this list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_animal_names ) . 
  this still sounds weird . 
  should n't it be `` i wish you would have let me know you better ... '' ? 
  [ nice to meet you . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ifivebuukbe/ub0yshsvuii/aaaaaaaacd8/pubw9ry6xlq/s1600/waving-bear.gif ), 
  right , i never really noticed this . 
  j\u00e4gerlatein and anglerlatein do n't mean the same thing as juristenlatein or \u00c4rztelatein . 
  the latter two mean overcomplicated language that a layman ca n't understand , the former two are [ the lies that are said to be typically told by hunters and fishermen ] ( http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/23478030.jpg ) . 
  with * l\u00f6wenlatein * , it 's hard to tell what exactly he means .

   piraten 3,5 % 4 % 3 % 3 % 3 % 3 %, 
  du bist 'n held ... 
  are both both correct in your sentence ? 
  i think slapping would be * plustouching * , punching * doubleplustouching * . 
  was die satire angeht : satire darf alles . 
  just make sure you do n't make it sound like you 're `` angry '' with god ; `` why is god so mean '' , etc. 
  maybe something like this : why does the bible/nt not even convince muslims and jews who already share * almost all * beliefs of christianity ? 
  or the other way around : what makes her sure that all revelations of the baha'i are false , even tough her religion and its dogma are so similar to those of the baha'i ? 
  you 're certainly right . 
  but still , i think a better translation for '' '' murica !, 
  would be '' ` schlaaaaaand ! '', 
  at least chose an interesting one . 
  [ * los pollos hermanos * is a fast food restaurant chain that specializes in chicken . 
  ] ( http://breakingbad.wikia.com/wiki/los_pollos_hermanos ) - it 's singular , even though the name is plural . 
  best comment in this thread . 
  had me laughing like a maniac ... 
  ... * within * a fortnight . 
  ( a fortnight is a period of time , not an event . ), 
  that would be `` many and more '' , since you 're talking about people . 
  ( people are countable . 
  even when so many have tried that you ca n't count them anymore . ),
