   however , when speaking with a female , participants interrupted more and used more dependent clauses than when speaking with a male . 
  there was no significant interaction to suggest that the language differences based on communication partner was specific to one gender group . 
  i think you 're misunderstanding this . 
  this means that men are more willing to interrupt a woman rather than another man - only women * also * are more willing to interrupt women rather than men . 
   i prefer the schwarzwald , because one can really be in the nature . 
  people have already given you good answers and explained why `` lieber '' is not the same thing as `` prefer '' , but i wonder why nobody has given you the easy translation ... 
  you can download that for free . 
  [ here , for instance . 
  ] ( http://microsoft-3d-pinball-space-cadet.soft32.com/ ) ( no idea if this page is trustworthy . 
  google your own source if you want to . ), 
  as others suggested : bevorzugen . 
  but it 's a tiny bit highbrow , at least in spoken conversation . 
  i 'm not saying anything . 
  do n't want to risk inadvertently talking over someone . 
  as a sidenote , i think it 's cheap that people who likely have n't looked at the studies at all are downvoting you for having looked at them . 
   give him a already within your empire, 
  do n't omit the one crucial word : give him a * kingdom * . 
   unless crown laws interfere . 
  i 'm still not certain i understand the effect of crown laws on this correctly , so let 's see if we agree : if op grants the heir to ruthenia ( whom we shall call * ivan * ) the vassal kingdom of wales , and ruthenia has high or absolute crown authority , ivan will simply be disqualified as heir - when his father dies , a younger brother or different relative will inherit the kingdom of ruthenia . 
  ( if ruthenia has medium or lower ca , it will instead become a part of the british empire . ), 
  the ca of britannia does not matter . 
  is that correct ? 
  [ so this is n't the official version after all ? 
  nope , not at all . 
  they also have never seen you rule . 
  i just need to imagine my brother walking up to me and telling me that he is now an important man and will demand respect and obedience , and i 'm torn between laughing him out of the imaginary room or plotting to get rid of him . 
  that would very likely change if he had already been a successful ruler for a few years and i had ( just as everybody else ) gotten used to thinking of him as a lord - but at the moment , he 's just my brother , whom i 've seen drunk and foolish far too many times to suddenly take him serious . 
  they do n't hate you , they just think you are incompetent . 
  her husband was the king for 20 years , he knew all the tricks , he could silence insubordinate courtiers with one look , his vassals feared and respected him - while you are her darling , but you * are * just a silly boy . 
  of couse she loves you , but real men eat little children like you for breakfast . 
  she would love to see you succeed ( and most ck2 mothers will like you well enough , despite the short reign penalty ) , but maybe it 's just to risky , and your uncle would simply look more * regal * as the new king - he can grow a real beard at least . 
  depends on how strictly you distinguish between history and pre-history . 
  ( history means that written records exist . 
  everything that happened in doggerland is pre-history . ), 
   ** not saying you are wrong ** , but your universal claim is wrong . 
  here is proof . 
  here 's what you said :, 
   ** you would be wrong : **, 
  since you do n't speak enough german , why do you want to use this sentence in german at all ? 
  this sounds very german , but it 's not a word i ever heard . 
  i 'd translate `` third party '' as `` dritt - '' or something with `` extern '' in most contexts . 
   if flights or flight would give us the extra capability to do both_either fight or flee then the stomach dropping makes us incapable to move at all more than anything . 
  this is completely incomprehensible . 
  [ is this the guy you are talking about ? 
  imdb realizes i 'm in germany and decides to react to this by translating not the entire page , but only the movie titles ... 
   lawrence kasdan was born on january 14 , 1949 in miami , florida , usa . 
  yes ? 
  we 're not talking about throwing the apple in someone 's face or doing this during class , but throwing a grenade-shaped object and yelling `` grenade '' is just something boys have done for as long as grenades have existed . 
  i 've been out of school for a while , but i imagine this is still very much ok here in germany . 
  sent a pm . 
  this being a reply to a throwaway account after two months , i 'm guessing op will never even see the message . 
  i only reply here to make it clear to others who might be in a similar situation in the future that there are people in germany ( near the nrw/rlp border ) who can offer some assistance . 
   1 ) carlos slim , obtained wealth from his father/family . 
  not self made . 
  yeah , he inherited possibly a few million dollars . 
  he then became the richest man in the world by making some 80 billion ( = 80,000 million ) dollars . 
  if that is not a self-made fortune , nothing is . 
  starting with ~ 5 million is a good starting position , but it does n't mean that everything you 'll ever own is `` inherited '' . 
  if you inherit $ 10,000 from your parents and turn them into $ 10,000,000 , you * are * a self-made millionaire . 
  and he did much more than that , relatively speaking . 
  that 's what i 'd do . 
  include a remark about your german skills already in the cover letter . 
  maybe write that remark in german . 
  * or something similar . 
  i 'm sure there were some , but he compared the openness with which the topic is discussed in general . 
  this was obviously very different in the 1960 's , with one important reason being that most teachers at the time had been involved in the war in one way or another . 
  not really . 
  it 's societal suicide , obviously , but not outright illegal . 
  denying that the holocaust happened is illegal , and anything that can be seen as incitement to racial hate or warmongering can possibly get you in trouble . 
  but if you were to claim that hitler was a brave man , a brilliant commander , a sophisticated philosopher , ... - you would n't find many friends , but you would n't go to prison . 
  hitchhiking + couchsurfing for a reasonable $ 0 of traveling costs . 
  when and where and for how long do you plan to do this ? 
  go back to prussia , fool !, 
  that 's c ** s ** u , of course !, 
  climate change is n't really the same as pollution of air and water . 
  a little carbon dioxide ( or even quite a lot ) in the air does n't harm humans directly , but it will heat up the atmosphere . 
  simple : we also gps-tag all * hands * in america . 
  fighting climate change is still something quite different from fighting pollution , the difference is far from semantic . 
  air that contains 700 ppm carbon dioxide is fine for us to breathe , it can absolutely be considered `` clean air '' . 
  if * the atmosphere * contained 700 ppm carbon dioxide , the consequences would be catastrophic . 
  sox and nox are toxic gases that very quickly will kill you directly . 
  wiki tells me that the epa short-term exposure limit for so2 is 75 parts per * billion * - if you had 10,000 times that much co2 in the air , it would still be perfectly fine . 
  i still think mushing up air pollution and climate change in one big pile is very much unhelpful and confusing to the layman . 
  air that you could breathe all your life without any adverse effects is `` clean '' , but it still might change the climate . 
  and if you 're feeling generous , you also add the mouse-over text for mobile users :, 
   * but this guy , he might be for real !, 
  technically , that would be considered rape ( statutory at least ) if something similar happened today . 
  but no matter when and where it happened , it would still certainly be sex . 
  are you refering to the bombing of isis positions , or some other kind of support ? 
  just so you know where the downvotes are coming from : european atheist here . 
  you are embarassing . 
  of course it is , do n't be ridiculous . 
   rape is a type of sexual assault ** usually involving sexual intercourse ** ( or other forms of sexual penetration ) initiated against one or more individuals without the consent of those individuals . 
  [ wiki ], 
  you might be confusing this with the common ( albeit already dubious ) claim that rape is n't * about * sex , but about power . 
  but having sex with a person against their will is , by definition , still sex . 
  ( depending on definition , rape without sex is possible . 
  but jefferson and hemmings did have sex , so that is n't relevant here . ), 
   fucking hell , slaves were n't even allowed to read back then and were killed if they revealed themselves to be literate . 
  we do n't know if sally hemings was literate , but we know that her [ brother james was .
