   he spoke french and english and was literate ; his handwritten inventory of kitchen supplies made before he left monticello is held by the library of congress . 
  he also left recipes and other writings . 
  not that this is an important point in this context , but it goes to show that `` back then '' is a big place . 
  i 'm not even arguing that this * was n't * rape ( or would at least be considered rape if something similar happened today ) . 
  i 'm saying it was sex . 
  in this case , it is * extremely * useful to have the german ( or dutch ) wikipedia for comparison , because the english version is reporting a legend as if it were reality . 
  the french cavalry did * not * sneak in and capture the surprised dutch fleet . 
  the war was already over , the dutch fleet had orders not to fight anymore . 
  the dutch fleet was not seized at all - the commander of the french cavalry unit simply met the dutch captain , and they agreed that the fleet would stay where it was and not leave the harbor without french permission . 
  google translation of some parts of the german article . 
  ( bad translations , but you get the idea . ), 
  ( edit : i tried fixing the translations up a little , so that they are actual english . ), 
   the surrender of the dutch fleet in 1795 was an event that , in the later and embellished french perspective , resulted in the claim that french cavalry had captured the dutch fleet . 
  this legend is based on the representation of antoine-henri jomini , published in 1819 , which was adopted by many later authors . 
   [ ... ] on january 21 , captain h. reyntjes , the highest-ranking officer of the trapped ships , received [ ... ] the order of the state council of holland and west friesland to all naval and army units to cease any hostilities against french troops . 
  the states-general , the dutch parliament , adopted a resolution with the same content dated on january 21 shortly thereafter . 
   [ ... ] on the night of january 23 , 1795 , the 23-year-old commander and later lieutenant general louis joseph lahure with 780 infantry , 128 hussars , 39 gunners , and four six-pounder bronze cannons reached the marsdiep at den helder . 
  on the morning of january 23 , he rode with some of his hussars of the 8th hussars across the ice to the dutch flagship , the battleship * admiraal piet heyn * , where he was received by captain reyntjes for negotiations . 
  the course of these negotiations is not known , but apparently it was agreed to retain the status quo until the arrival of clear instructions . 
  the title of the article in german already is '' \u00dcbergabe der niederl\u00e4ndischen flotte 1795 '' ( surrender of the dutch fleet in 1795 ) , or `` overgave van de nederlandse vloot aan de franse cavalerie '' ( surrender of the dutch fleet to the french cavalry ) in dutch - very different from the english title `` capture of the dutch fleet at den helder '' . 
  i posted it in the thread where this was mentioned , and i 'll post it here again : this did not really happen , the english wikipedia is reporting a legend as if it were reality . 
  the french cavalry did * not * sneak in and capture the surprised dutch fleet .

  here is my translation ( based on wiki tranlsate ) of the german version of the wikipedia article for this event :,

  did you conquer all of hungary ( with what cb ? 
  ) , or did you somehow inherit it ? 
  it 's actually quite an easy choice : if you are into organic food , vegetarianism , saving the environment and the climate , feminism , gender equality , lgbtxyz , and all that lefty feel-good stuff , go to freiburg . 
  otherwise , go to bonn . 
  freiburg is a student village more than anything else , bonn is a comparably `` normal '' city . 
  bonn has the advantage of being close to cologne and closer than freiburg to basically * everything * ( in germany ) . 
  ah , you mean this kind of [ claymore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claymore ) . 
  i 'm much more familiar with the modern kind of [ claymore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m18_claymore_mine ) , got confused how i could have missed that in the video ... 
  turkey refused to help in the invasion of iraq , turkey now refuses to assist in the fight against isis - the middle-eastern air bases in turkey are virtually worthless for nato . 
  turkey is part of nato because they control the straits that would allow to keep russia out of the mediterranean . 
  this only becomes relevant in a war between russia and nato , but that 's basically the raison d'etre of nato anyway . 
  i hate all those `` modern '' microwaves that have a zillion different functions . 
  a microwave needs a time control and a power control and nothing else . 
  putting dozens of buttons on there makes a simple device complicated , and all for the `` benefit '' that you could also prepare turkey , vaporize ice cream , or dry cats in there , which nobody ever does . 
  when will they finally install thumb scanners in the cabs , dammit ? 
   what it is n't is education, 
  although education still makes it more likely that the jewish character will become friends with a ( future ) ruler - guardians and their wards have special events that make them friends .

  unidan was banned for using various alternative accounts for upvoting his own comments . 
  before that , he also got into a very silly fight about what is and what is n't a crow .

  you 're welcome . 
  he 's back , now , by the way , after about a one-month hiatus , as / u/unidanx . 
  - do n't talk about this too loudly , or it might cause extreme reactions . 
  it 's not about the karma . 
  he only upvoted himself maybe five times per post , and often got thousands of upvotes in total . 
  it 's about getting a high ranking in the `` new '' queue , as i und er stand it . 
  when you guarantee that your own posts are always seen as `` trending '' by the algorithm , other people 's posts do n't get a chance even thpugh they may be better . 
   you can pay for upvote and downvote bots, 
  which also gets you banned ( if anyone finds out ) . 
  good , educational posts get upvoted enough . 
  manipulating votes in favor of your own posts always means that somebody else 's post is * not * seen by most people , even though it was * better * than your post . 
  ( i also liked unidan 's posts , and i 'm glad he 's not gone for good . ), 
  that 's quite some recent progress south of adra , is n't it ? 
  within germany , berlin has the only election district in which [ a green party candidate won the direct vote ] (, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans-christian_str%c3%b6bele#member_of_parliament.2c_1998 - ) . 
  several times , even . 
  ( germany has a mixed election system , every district elects one candidate directly , and all parties who did not win `` enough '' seats directly to account for their share of the total vote are given seats to fill from their party list . 
  for smaller parties such as the greens , these seats are all they get , because all the `` direct '' mandates are won by the two big parties ( or possibly by the communists in parts of the old east ) . ), 
  i find that uncanny . 
  the berlin wall had spring guns ( [ `` selbstschussanlagen '' ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/selbstschussanlage ) ) , which i think were seen as state-of-the-art at the time . 
  you can twist that into very special human-robot relationship dynamics . 
  `` robots designed to kill people '' - although it 's a bit of a stretch to call them robots ... 
   because who wants to translate papers from german, 
  who publishes papers in german ? 
  [ here 's a list of the publications by the group of professor aeschlimann ] ( http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/aeschlimann/publications/ ) , physics at tu kaiserlautern - i chose this guy because he 's the first in the alphabet at the university you named . 
  it 's from their german homepage , and all of the publications are in english . 
  my favorite illustration of this is the story of the * angewandte chemie * ( `` applied chemistry '' ) . 
  * angewandte * is a very prestigious journals for general chemistry . 
  they used to be mostly in german . 
  then , english papers became more and more common , until the journal was split in half in 1962 ( ! ), 
  - they continued with one journal named * angewandte chemie * and another one named `` angewandte chemie international edition '' . 
  ( yes , this name is mixed german/english . ), 
  today , the `` international edition '' is 100 % in english , while the non-international , supposedly german edition - is still ~ 80 % english .
