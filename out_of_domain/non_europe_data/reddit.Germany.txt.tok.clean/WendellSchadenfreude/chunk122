  to be fair , your dad probably studied in germany a few decades ago . 
  germany has changed a lot since 1990 . 
  [ enough said ? 
  public debt is 73 % of gdp in the us , 80 % of gdp in germany . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt ), 
  he 's unidan . 
  use google . 
  or wikipedia . 
  or the reddit search function . 
  this is n't `` now '' , it has always been like that . 
  it 's just weird that there 's this big post about it now as if something important had changed . 
  ( even when and where there were fees , they never covered anything even close to the real cost of university , it was always just a few hundred euro per semester . ), 
  i think this is fine , germany also benefits from these students . 
  we might have to change something if there really were a giant wave of students who come to germany with the plan to leave again as soon as they get their `` free degrees '' , but this does n't currently seem to be the case at all . 
  in the general population , this is not a controversial issue . 
  even when tuition fees are discussed , this aspect is rarely ever brought up . 
  i do n't believe you 'll actually even try to do that , but if you do : good luck !, 
  message me when you are in germany . 
  i 've seen this so often , and it still makes me laugh tears . 
  the data in my first link is from * now * . 
  ( granted , it 's an extrapolation . ), 
  the data in my second link ( wikipedia/cia factbook ) are from 2012/2013 . 
  your link does n't even contain a comparison to germany at all , so it 's not especially useful . 
  you certainly have n't `` said enough '' by simply pointing out that the us is in debt , because so is germany . 
  fuck all your `` news '' reports about germany !, 
  our country does n't work like that . 
  there is no ban whatsoever . 
  this is an idea floating around , not a ban , not a law , not even a proposal . 
   german unis are recommending around 1000 ( around 800 euro , with student accomodation , food and transport - per semester, 
  what ? 
  where have you seen that ? 
  it might be 800 $ ** per month ** , that would make much more sense . 
  800 per month is 9,600 per year , so close enough to 10,000 . 
  mind you , this is the money to pay for rent and food and stuff . 
  university fees are only ~ 500 $ per year . 
  close-mindedness . 
  sunset invasion gives you what it promises : an aztec invasion . 
  it 's loads of fun . 
  many players do n't like it because an aztec invasion of europe somehow is more `` ahistoric '' than a cathar ireland taking over the continent or a black five-year old viking descendant of mohamed conquering land in india . 
  but yeah : sunset invasion is something that you sometimes turn on and then turn off again for some games . 
  when you play with legacy of rome once , you rarely want to go back to the base-game . 
  portraits  music   unit packs . 
  although i 'm having trouble finding an example where they would actually be diffferent . 
  best i can come up with : imagine movers are bringing in some wooden beams into your house , and you tell them where to put them . 
  if you say `` stellt sie in die ecke da ! '', 
  ( * put them in the corner over there * ) , it 's somewhat clear that you want them to put the beams upright , leaning against the wall . 
  if instead you say `` legt sie in die ecke da ! '', 
  ( also * put them in the corner over there * ) , you clearly mean for them to put the beams down on the ground , horizontally . 
   ( `` to love '' is a complicated verb in dutch so i opted to change it to `` to hate '' ), 
  i always wondered how this happened . 
  does the word/stem `` hou '' exist outside of `` hou van ... '' ? 
  is it possible to deconstruct the phrase , at least etymologically ? 
  it 's like the dutch are using a phrase that * used * to mean `` i care about you '' ( or something ... ) , but then they started using it to mean `` i love you '' , and at some point they got so used to it that they forgot about the phrase `` i love you '' and completely replaced it with the new one . 
  ** this is the german font **, 
  nope . 
  does n't even mention the guy . 
  of course , there are several other links from schindler 's list to hitler , like ss or wehrmacht . 
  but try for yourself , go to [ the article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schindler%27s_list ) and search for hitler . 
  for comparison : the [ first fortune 500 list , from 1955 . 
  ] ( http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1955/ ), 
  added some paragraphs and fixed some other small things :, 
  this is a very loaded couple of questions so if this is long i apologize in advance , and also apologize for grammatical errors since i am mobile right now . 
  the experience was bitter sweet to say the least . 
  being objectified by women was all too flattering in the beginning , but then it just became annoying . 
  the worst women to strip for were the married ones , but i guess you could say that about men as well . 
  to the married women , i was a playground . 
  there were limits to my stripping and there was some touching , but no junk touching - and these women were not having it . 
  i would have to remind them over and over again that you can touch my ass , touch my chest , my abs but the package was off limits . 
  again , i was a clean stripper , no shady stuff , which i found to be the best method because if they knew they would eventually get the whole package , they would n't keep throwing money . 
  did i like it !?!?!, 
  yes and no . 
  the late nights , the sometimes absolute pigs i had to dance for , and these were the ones that always wanted me to fuck them offering me sometimes up to 100 dollars just to get me to , which never happened , and ultimately would piss them off !!, 
  i will end it with a story of my worst experience where my decision to stop was solidified . 
  it was a friday evening and i was sitting around the office of the agency waiting for a call just hanging out watching tv . 
  call came in for a bachelorette party who at the last minute decided on a stripper . 
  i fit the description of what they wanted so off i went . 
  2\u00a01/2 hour drive to some resort type place with condo like homes , but the renting/time share kind . 
  pull up to the house and immediately see about 20-30 motorcycles in the driveway and instantly knew what type of party i was dancing for . 
  these parties were horrible , and this one was not going to be any different . 
  driver rings the bell and the door opens to a full on motorcycle club type gathering , guns , drugs and alcohol , disguised as a bachelorette party ... . men involved . 
  now i did not dance for men , strictly women and was always just comfortable with dancing in front of my driver if it was a man and sometimes a husband of one of the women at a party , but not a full on mix of motorcycle guys and gals . 
  head into an empty room to get ready and this big ass dude , probably the president or captain or some shit knocks on the door and asks to chat . 
  comes in and says `` now i know what they told me on the phone about the rules , but you 're here now and they do n't apply '' ... . the shit fuck look on my face was probably apparent ... tried to explain that was n't going to fly but of course he wasnt taking no for an answer and threw a few hundred on the bed and said make these girls happy we called you . 
  so i figure wtf , how bad could it be . 
  boy was i wrong . 
  these women handled me like a ken doll . 
  i walk out to the main room where i was to dance and 75 % of the women are naked . 
  you are probably thinking , shit , that is awesome , but no ... not at all . 
  most of these women were the biker types ... some were very good looking naked , but most were not , and those were the worst ones . 
  the groping , the touching , the kissing , the suckling . 
  could barely keep these women off my cock ... thank god my driver had rubbers because these girls were relentless and each had to have their turn . 
  i did dance and do my usual thing , but mostly all they wanted to do was go for a ride ... biker chicks indeed !!!, 
  the worst part of the whole ordeal was right at the end when everybody had their fill of me , the same big dude now says `` cum on the bride-to-be 's face ! '', 
  now this was going to be hard because when i did parties i used a stay hard lotion that numbed my penis , for the show . 
  i looked at my driver , he shrugs and basically signals you are on your own with this one , i am not stepping in . 
  to end this story , and ultimately my career in stripping ... one of the other guys obviously knew i needed the extra help and offered up one of the good looking naked women on the couch to give me a hand . 
  the bride-to-be kneels down in front of me to the right , the fluffer goes at my dick with a pretty good blow job and jerks me off on to the bride-to-be 's face . 
  fucking worst thing i ever did as a male stripper , and in front of about 10 guys too . 
  pictures were taken of the bride-to-be with my cum all over her face , and still to this day i do n't know if her soon-to-be husband was one of those 10 men . 
  walked into the office and quit that night !,
