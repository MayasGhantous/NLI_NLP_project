  ( you * are * proof-reading , are n't you ? ), 
  works extra well in this case , with the mistake being in the very last word ... 
  as a german , i can only tell you that our common narrative is the same as yours when it comes to this . 
  `` when the russians conquered a german village , all the girls and women were raped ; when the americans liberated a village , some of them were mean , and some of them gave the children chocolate . '', 
  this is obviously a simplification of what actually happened , but it 's at least the mainstream `` man on the street '' view in germany - today , and afaik at any time since wwii . 
  searchall !, 
  searchall !, 
  `` rabble '', 
  google `` ck2 north korea mode '' - it 's possible . 
  it 's op . 
  i think it still works after a few attempts to nerf it . 
  technically , it 's better to have vassals , but only baron level vassals . 
  periodically , you imprison and banish all of them for money . 
  for americans making fun of britons for their bad plumbing : just remember that * you 're * the ones who 's toilets keep clogging . 
  the rest of the civilized world does n't have this problem . 
  we like you silly anglo-saxons . 
  - the rest of the world, 
  really nsfw , btw . 
  vagina and stuff . 
  just clarifying because i often click nsfw links when i expect them to be artsy or otherwise harmless by european standards . 
  this one is n't . 
  i learned this on reddit : buy a plunger before you need a plunger . 
  then i looked up what a plunger is . 
  realized i do n't know this word even in german , so i looked up ( on wikipedia ) what a `` saugglocke '' is . 
  realized it 's something i once saw in my grandmother 's house , but have n't seen in decades . 
  i certainly wo n't buy one , but if you are american , i 'll repeat this friendly advice : buy a plunger before you need a plunger . 
  go to bahn.de instead to find out how long it will take by train . 
  just have to know a station close to where you 'll live . 
  urbar to frankfurt takes quite exactly 2 hours , because you 're going to koblenz first . 
  mostly do n't watch them . 
  if you want to watch part of them , do it without sound . 
  are there really hizbollah fighters in nubbol and al-zahraa ? 
  have they been there for years already , or did they get there at some later point ? 
  i 'm not sure there actually * are * changes to the map in the save-breaking sense . 
  provinces are still all the same ( ? 
  ) , only many of them now start without holdings and with tribes and stuff in them . 
  but since the save defines which holdings exist in a province , it might not be a problem . 
  with rajas , they offered the old patch as a `` beta version '' in steam . 
  i 'm fairly certain they 'll do that again , so you can finish any old saves you have before switching to charlemagne . 
  ( but you 'll just have to manually elect to use the `` beta version '' first . ), 
  can somebody give a brief recap of what they are saying ? 
  where 's `` where 's waldo '' ? 
  the pope wanted to come there for a big outdoor mass . 
  we did n't want him , for environmentalist reasons . 
  ( actually , everybody wanted him to come , except for some tiny environmentalist group . 
  but they managed to stop him . ), 
  this is n't new in any way . 
  german universities have always worked like this . 
  at most , we 've had `` tuition fees '' of a few hundred $ per semester for a few years . 
  i do n't even want to outright disagree with your prognosis of germany 's economic near future - but i certainly wo n't blame the free universities . 
  [ and here 's the historic background . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_verden ), 
   when he heard this , the lord king charles [ i.e. 
  charlemagne ; my edit ] rushed to the place with all the franks that he could gather on short notice and advanced to where the aller flows into the weser . 
  then all the saxons came together again , submitted to the authority of the lord king , and surrendered the evildoers who were chiefly responsible for this revolt to be put to death -- four thousand and five hundred of them . 
  this sentence was carried out . 
  others have already pointed out that * lingua franca * does n't necessarily mean the language spoken by most people . 
  i 'd like add that your sources [ 2 +3 ] are 15 years old , and english today certainly * is * the language [ that 's spoken by most people in the world . 
  and if you plan to live and use your language for another 10 or so years at least , the importance of english is certainly going to increase even further . 
  `` fracking science '' , if you 're using it non-ironically as the science/engineering pertaining to hydraulic fracturing , would simply be * fracking-wissenschaft * . 
  `` verfrackt '' or `` gefrackt '' would only work as `` translations '' when you 're using `` fracking science '' as a primitive wordplay . 
  syria will still be there in a few years . 
  five years ago , the entire country was safe for tourists , and maybe it will be at peace again five years from now . 
  at the moment , you could maybe visit latakia and tartus ( two coastal cities ) without people questioning your sanity . 
  overall , it 's just not worth the risk at the moment . 
   ( by the way , i 've looked up statistics for false reports of rape multiple times and found varying amounts , but the highest was 8 % . 
  it 's not as common as people think . ), 
  the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_accusation_of_rape#estimates_of_prevalence ) already mentions many statistical estimates that are higher than 8 % . 
  i 'm not saying any of these are correct , but if the highest * estimate * you could find was 8 % , you must have been looking very selectively . 
  while you do that , all the areas that used to be 0s will still `` look like 0 '' a little more than the areas that used to be 1s . 
  when you repeat the process often enough , this at the very least becomes undetectable . 
  but it 's easier to overwrite everything with random 1s and 0s . 
  that way , if an area `` looks more like 0 '' , you still do n't know if this is because it actually used to be a 0 , or because it was overwritten with a random 0 . 
   personally , i simply destroy my old hard drives anyway , which is fast , simple , cheap , and leaves no room for speculation . 
  eli5 , how do i quickly , easily , and cheaply destroy an old hard drive ? 
  the top answer will almost certainly be `` 10-1 '' , although that is n't more than a crude rule of thumb . 
  if you have mostly archers ( or horse archers ) , a much smaller ratio ( e.g. 
  6-1 ) is fine as well . 
  and all depends of course on the strategic situation . 
  mostly mercenaries ? 
  throw them at the enemy castle at 5-1 - you do n't care about losses , and they actually become cheaper when most of them die in battle . 
  - 95 % war success , this is the last castle you need to storm , and a huge enemy host is approaching ( but still a few provinces away ) ? 
  storm the castle , no matter the cost . 
  3-1 , possibly even 2-1 is enough . 
  on the other hand , if you are fighting a strong enemy and the decisive battle has not yet been fought , then you should n't storm holdings at all - keep your troops together until you have crushed the enemy 's main host !,

  `` 5099 bc '' is a very specific statement . 
  with carbondating ( or other radionuclides ) , such precise meassurements are n't possible , but since this is a wooden structures , it 's * possible * that they really know the precise year when this was built . 
  the method is called [ dendrochronology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dendrochronology ) , and it 's simply based on couting tree-rings . 
  at least for some regions , we have overlapping tree-ring archives that go back thousands of years . 
  the starks are the most powerful house in the north , they are the nightwatch 's strongest support in times of need and have been for thousands of years . 
  being a stark who voluntarily joined the watch and is one of the most powerful men at the wall gives you some privileges over the average thief or rapist who was sentenced to join the watch . 
  calm down , everybody . 
  i 'm all for the kurds , and this is good news , but i do n't think this hill is a big deal by itself . 
  [ map ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bz5ohnpcuaaizdn.png:large ) . 
  i feel it 's more important that they barely lost any ground in the city itself over the last few days . 
  let 's hope they can keep that up . 
   on a site where people brag about getting him/her so drunk they can go to pound town, 
  this reminds me of [ the time we got unidan so drunk that he could barely explain camels anymore .
