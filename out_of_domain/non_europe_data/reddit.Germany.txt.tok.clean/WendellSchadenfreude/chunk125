  / r/atheism is simply empty after [ the rapture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapture ) occurs . 
  that is only correct if you define one twin as the original twin and one as the clone . 
  otherwise , all four of them are clones - two pairs of clones . 
  just not clones of the guy in the threesome , of course , but clones of each other .

  for those who do n't get the water/ice thing :, 
  besides liquid water and water vapor , water has at least 15 different solid phases . 
  [ we call all of them `` ice '' , ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/phase_diagram_of_water.svg/512px-phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png ) but they all have different ( and sometimes quite complicated ) chrystal structures . 
  randall is suggesting that at under certain conditions , water might turn into birds and vice versa . 
  so birds do n't go anywhere when it rains , birds * are * rain . 
  do n't worry about this too much . 
  nobody will think bad about non-natives for messing this up . 
  it 's complicated because there are different rules for personal contact and written messages . 
  when writing an email or a letter to a professor , [ i think this page answers everything . 
  when directly talking to a male professor , you address him as `` professor nachname '' , or `` herr professor nachname '' if you want to be extra-formal . 
  and 95 % of the time , `` herr nachname '' is fine as well . 
  for female professors , i feel the more polite form `` frau professor nachname '' is more common . 
  `` professor nachname '' sounds weird too me - damn , this really is complicated . 
   `` frau nachname '' is also usually fine . 
  i 'd never say '' ( frau ) professor * in * nachname '' . 
  for doctors ( as in : phds at your university ) , `` herr/frau doktor nachname '' is always correct , `` herr/frau nachname '' will usually be fine as well . 
  in writing , `` doktor '' is always abbreviated ( `` dr. '' ) . 
  `` dozent '' is never used to address a person , neither in writing nor in speaking . 
  but do n't abbreviate the `` professor '' . 
  you only do that with `` dr. '' , not with any other title . 
  i think so . 
  you first need to mend the schism ( so that catholic becomes an orthodox heresy ) . 
  then , you need to convert to catholicism yourself and convert enough provinces to get `` the catholic faith trimumphant '' . 
  this will turn the brotherhood of the holy sepulchre into a catholic holy order , but that 's not what you wanted . 
  so now , you need to switch back to orthodoxy and * again * flip enough provinces to get `` the orthodox faith triumphant '' - that should now turn all catholic orders orthodox . 
  snow is made of ice particles . 
  on a microscopic level , we 'd call it ice . 
  this is somewhat comparable to how `` icicle '' , `` iceberg '' , and `` avalanche '' also are n't different phases of water , just different forms of how ice is arranged macroscopically . 
  you can order `` my size '' condoms on amazon . 
  they have very nice packs with three different sizes ( each three times ) for finding out which one you like best . 
  ( girth is the important factor , not length . 
  you can also simply meassure and then directly order the right size on amazon , of course . ),

  this reminds me of the incident in which the leadership of ahrar ash-sham was killed a few months ago .

   monkeys have been eating bananas for eons, 
  do monkeys even eat wild bananas ? 
  the modern , sweet , yellow banana has n't even been around all that long - and obviously , ( non-human ) monkeys are n't really exercising any selective pressure on them .

  what would turkey do without this `` distraction '' ? 
  stand at the border , in clear view of the terrorists , and watch how they kill people ?

  fuck this turkish government . 
  if you * ever * want cool water , the energy needed to cool down the water does n't matter . 
  people in this thread are so mean . 
  let me try to explain this in a way that is easier to understand :, 
  when a fridge is mostly `` empty '' , it 's actually filled with a lot of air . 
  every time you open the door , a lot of that cold air will flow out of the fridge and be replaced with warm air . 
  this warm air will then be cooled down once you closer the fridge again , which means you are wasting energy on cooling down * air * . 
  anything that displaces the air in the fridge reduces this waste . 
  putting some styrofoam bricks in there works fine , or * empty * bottles , or books - anything solid , really . 
  if you do n't really want to have cold water ( ever ) , you should n't be using water bottles : cooling down water takes a lot of energy , and what little you save every time you open the door will probably never be enough to make up for that initial investment . 
  are there really hizbollah units in nubbol and zaraa ? 
  when did they get there ? 
  i feel like the siege of these towns has been going on since before hizbollah even joined the conflict . 
  i 've only been there once , but as far as i remember : this is pretty much exactly what it looks like .
