  as unlikely as it sounds : that 's probably the reason , and it 's a damn good reason , too . 
   `` we are tribal people . 
  we will never forget to avenge , '' said abu salem , the commander of the group . 
  `` but we will do it by ourselves , in our own way . 
  we wo n't take any help from anyone . '', 
  shure , we should help them - wether they want help or not ... 
  as a civilian : what do you do when this happens ? 
  i suspect you ca n't simply tilt the mortar over until the dud falls out . 
  i 'd just leave the area and buy a new mortar , but that might get expensive after a while ... 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i think the vast majority of the sub agrees that the twitter account should n't have been used that way . 
  i think the vast majority of the sub also thinks that we can now move on . 
  still with the `` extremely unconfirmed '' ? 
  things do n't get * more unconfirmed * than simply `` unconfirmed '' . 
   every job i have applied for , i was offered that position . 
  what the hell are your qualifications ? 
  how many different positions are we talking ? 
  history is so weird . 
  if you want to evaluate how strong the muslims are , * do n't play as a zunist * . 
  of course they will crush you in most cases - they are supposed to . 
  that 's like starting a game as iceland in 1100 and then complaining that the aztecs are too strong . 
  muslims probably are a little too strong at the moment - although they historically really * were * strong around the year 800 . 
  they may get nerfed a little , but certainly not enough for the * zunists * to stand much of a chance against them in most games . 
  [ and my sax !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seax ), 
   but if you 're the only one teaching german to the child , their german is never going to be better than yours . 
  this is n't necessarily true . 
  this is somewhat regularly tested in reality when hearing parents have a deaf child . 
  the parents usually start learning sign language immediately , so they know a little but they obviously are n't `` natives '' . 
  the children , however , seem to be generally able to grasp the rules and concepts of their language even when the parents are n't using them correctly all of the time . 
  ( not an expert on this in any way , i 'm think i learned this from stephen pinker 's * the language instinct * . ), 
  i 've often wondered about this myself . 
  i somewhat plan on teaching my children german and english from the very start , even though i 'm not an english native speaker myself . 
  i think this might lead to them acquiring some few quirks where they copy my mistakes , but i think the benefits far outweigh the risks . 
   i knew somebody who had been brought up by an english father who spoke german to him and a german mother who spoke english to him, 
  ... why would they do * that * , instead of the other way round ? 
   a herbivore that lived in the forest might be green, 
  great , now i wonder why modern day herbivores generally * are n't * green - even those that live in forests . 
  that one at least is easily fixed by spain switching colors with portugal . 
  hill-arious . 
  and provoke the ire of the * bund der vertriebenen * ? 
   like say i 'm at a relatives house , would it be a faux pas to use sie instead of du ? 
  you would sound very silly doing that . 
  that 's it . 
  imagine calling one of your relatives `` sir '' all of a sudden . 
  you might do that when first meeting your ( future ) father-in-law , but you 'd never slip back into it once you 've established first-name relations . 
  but do n't worry about it - you 'll make many other mistakes that you do n't even realize , and germans will just think it 's cute . 
  ( i once dated a non-native girl who occasionally called me `` sie '' for a while at first . 
  it was oddly charming . ), 
   i always thought that it was obvious that seatbelts were designed by a man . 
  correct . 
  seatbelts as we know them were invented by [ nils bohlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nils_bohlin ) in 1958 . 
  he deserves praise for his work , and so does his company : in the interest of safety , [ volvo made the design available to other manufacturers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seat_belt#three-point ) instead of trying to protect it with patents . 
  there might be as many as 100 * deaths * from circumcision [ every year in the us . 
  ] ( http://www.circinfo.org/usa_deaths.html ) let 's get outraged about that . 
  to be fair , that study is somewhat controversial , as you 'd expect . 
  but even if the number is really far lower , it does n't change much : you 're operating on a tiny human being for no good reason , and you * are * risking complications . 
  yes , but a risk that is taken for medical reasons to alleviate a different ( and far more dangerous ) risk . 
  i do n't know how many ( if any ) children die from measles vaccines every year , but it 's certainly fewer than would die from measles if we stopped vaccinating . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to tell me ; maybe you missunderstood what i wrote . 
   i do n't know how many ( if any ) children die from measles vaccines every year , but it 's certainly fewer than would die from measles if we stopped vaccinating . 
  clearly , i want to keep vaccinating children . 
  you 're now * supposed * to have vassal kings ( once you 're powerful enough ) , so they do n't want to punish you for it . 
  if you want more power for yourself , you 'll now try to have viceroys instead of vassal kings , and * that * still comes with an opinion penalty . 
  fuck off with your smug attitude . 
  soldiers of a nation that is at peace are not legitimate targets for irregular gunmen . 
  these attackers are criminals and terrorists . 
   if soldiers are attacked , does n't that just make it an act of war , and not terrorism ? 
  if i 'm a soldier and i kill another soldier while our countries are at war , that 's an act of war . 
  if i kill a soldier in peacetime because i want to take his money , that 's a crime . 
  if i kill a soldier in peacetime to `` send a message '' , spread fear , or destabilize a government , that 's terrorism . 
  these are just examples and not complete definitions , of course , but it should be enough to classify most attacks . 
  because the attackers were n't military . 
  if i 'm a soldier and i kill another soldier while our countries are at war , that 's an act of war . 
  if i kill a soldier in peacetime because i want to take his money , that 's a crime . 
  if i kill a soldier in peacetime to `` send a message '' , spread fear , or destabilize a government , that 's terrorism . 
  regular military attacking regular military by regular military means . 
  war crime because the attack occured before the declaration of war . 
  if all you see in a uniform is a `` silly costume '' , you might generally not be fit to comment on things military or political . 
  if i lock you up for years , it 's a crime . 
  if a police officer in his silly uniform with his silly job locks you up because a man in a silly judge 's uniform told him to do it - not a crime . 
  in christianity , that makes perfect sense , because jesus * is * god . 
  but for islam , afaik it would really be blasphemous to claim that mohammad has any real power himself . 
  if you look at the tweets however , the isis guy did n't really do that : he tweeted that the prophet * told someone in a dream * that the victory was delayed for lack of prayers - not that the prophet himself delayed it . 
   and could inherit from the state, 
  how does one do that , inherit from a state ? 
  do n't worry if this sounds very confusing to you , the idea [ of the trinity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trinity ) sounds confusing to everybody . 
  still , it is quite fundamental for christianity - for instance , prayers are often ended with the formula `` in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy spirit , amen . '', 
  most important thing about this whole concept : father , son , and holy spirit are * one * god , not three . 
  you 'll also find pictures of god in christian churches , for instance in the famous [ `` creation of adam '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_creation_of_adam ) in the sistine chapel in rome . 
  i think christians are n't worried about the first commandment in this context because nobody ( except maybe small children ) believes that this * literally * shows what god is like , and nobody worships the pictures . 
  * if * they take kobane , they can easily hold it for the foreseeable future . 
  turkey is not going to let anyone cross the border who has to fight * while crossing * . 
  that would be one front that isis does n't have to worry about anymore , so i can somewhat understand their eagerness to take the city , even at high costs . 
  i do n't think so . 
  airstrikes are n't all that efficient against an enemy that can hide somewhere in a city , where you have no ground forces for spotting ( unless you 're willing to level the entire city ) . 
  and airstrikes * alone * are n't enough to drive an armed group from a city , so what would be the point of keeping them up ? 
  that would upset all of their * most loyal * customers - the ones who already bought their fire phones . 
  i do n't think amazon would be happy to give all of them their money back just so they can get rid of some phones . 
  i think the point is : * if * they manage to subdue the few remaining districts and take the border crossing , they are safe for good on that front .
