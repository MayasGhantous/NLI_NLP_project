  turkey would n't let any anti-isis forces cross the border if isis already holds the other side of the border . 
  so if they take the entire city , isis can withdraw all but a few hundred fighters and never has to worry about kobane again . 
  if they do n't take the crossing , they need thousands of fighters to stay there just to hold the land . 
  just north of deir ezzor , this map shows a small area of government control on the eastern shore of the euphrates ( at ayyash , i guess ) . 
  do you know if this is accurate ? 
  [ their mother 's name was also jenny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jenny_von_westphalen ) . 
  i do n't think the kurds are attacking very often at the moment , except for quick advances right after an airstrike . 
  if that 's the case , isis can control how `` loud '' things are in kobane most of the time . 
  [ the independent has an article about this event ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-attack-on-idlib-assads-army-leaders-slaughtered-as-jihadists-storm-syrias-second-city-9822023.html ) that makes it sound like a huge success . 
  however , i feel that article is n't very reliable since they got some pretty fundamental facts wrong . 
  ( the most obvious one : identifying the attackers as isis . ), 
  there still seems to be some confusion about what exactly happened . 
  mastouma clearly is to the south of idlib , not to the west , yet the article claims that western outskirts were infiltrated by the rebels . 
  i ca n't find any of these villages on a map . 
  did they take them from other rebel groups or from the government ? 
  and before that ( since at least 50 bc ) , they were in gaul ( modern france ) , where almost the entire population was celtic as well when the romans arrived . 
  i think they only changed the name of the decision to `` upgrade tribal holdings '' . 
  i suspect it 's still `` adopt feudalism '' the first time you do it , but it would be kinda silly to adopt feudalism again and again and again - so it 's simply called `` upgrading '' after that . 
  it has to stick around - you might conquer new tribal holdings after all . 
  she 's talking about him , not addressing him - therefore you should n't add a comma ( or audible pause ) before `` romeo '' . 
  edit : made this post a little nicer . 
  i hope you did n't read the mean original version . 
  it was . 
  this article is simply very confused . 
  we already [ have a thread discussing this attack ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2khjfq/jabhat_alnusra_storms_idlib_city_and_suffers/ ) , maybe we should try to keep all discussion there . 
  that thread was started by an article that makes it sound [ like the attack was far less successful . 
  ] ( http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jabhat-al-nusra-storms-idlib-city-suffers-devastating-losses/ ), 
  this article seems much more disinterested than the other articles covering this event . 
  thumbs up to the bbc . 
  if you want to discuss the event , [ i 'd still recommend keeping it in this thread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2khjfq/jabhat_alnusra_storms_idlib_city_and_suffers/ ), 
  i finally found where these villages ( or at least some of them ) are :, 
  [ link to map showing kansaffra/kensafrah ] ( http://wikimapia.org/3956020/kansaffra ) . 
  balyun/balyon is the next village to the north , ablin/eblin the one after that ; al-mugharah/mgharah and shinan/shnan are a little to the east . 
  these villages are about halfway between idlib and khan shikhoun ( on the north hama/morek front ) . 
  so my guess is that the nusra fighters simply moved north from the morek front . 
  are there any news from that region ? 
  ( by the way , these villages are right next to famous [ kafranbel ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=kafranbel&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=897&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=765pvm6gi8nmapk-gnal&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) . ), 
  i do n't understand this project at all . 
  why would i ever tell my children about a person who 's importance lies solely in being franklin 's sister ? 
  * franklin * was important , i will tell my children about him . 
  but i wo n't bother telling my children about his cousin , his son , his wife , or any other person who may have been emotionally important * to him * , but who was unimportant to history . 
  there were important women in history - but what good does it do to talk about unimportant people just because they were women ? 
  that 's nice and all . 
  we probably wo n't achieve that in school , but we can try . 
  but we certainly wo n't get there by teaching about the men and women who are famous because they actually contributed to history * and * adding some random women who were n't really all that important . 
  at each point in history , you can of course step back for a moment and ask yourself : during the time of all these napoleons , franklins , and washingtons , how did normal people live and how were they affected by `` history '' - and in that case , the normal people should obviously include women . 
  but that does n't seem to be the idea of this project . 
  thank you , that was an interesting read and it 's an argument that i can understand . 
  still , i hope we can agree that there 's a drastic difference between ben franklin and his sister . 
  ben franklin shaped history , and people today should learn how and why . 
  instead of him , you could talk about a handful of others who were similarly important - if possible , you should learn about all of them . 
  his sister was not important for history at all . 
  she * might * have been , but if we should learn anything about her today , it 's * why * she was not important . 
  and that 's true not just for her , but for millions of other women - as well as millions of men as well , by the way - and learning about them individually is at best impossible . 
  i hope young people today are n't taught that history was made by men * because they `` deserved '' it * . 
  but i hope they learn that history * was * mostly made by men , because that is true . 
  i hope they also learn the reasons for it , and understand that it does n't have to be true forever . 
  my god , that is depressing . 
   nusra is fundamentally different in its ideals and approach compared to is . 
  their ideals are exactly the same , only their approach is somewhat different . 
  after all , they * were * offshoots of the same organization . 
  even with regard to their approach , i believe it 's more of a question of judgement : jan would do exactly what isis does , but they do n't think they are strong enough for it . 
  since the us airstrikes started , [ past differences between jan and isis have also become less important . 
  for what it 's worth : i think this was one of the funniest comments i 've seen on this subreddit . 
  nicely done . 
  i wonder if it 's intentional that [ \u00d6land ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96land ) is already feudal in 867 , as opposed to all the rest of sweden . 
  [ born in the purple ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porphyrogennetos ), 
  for byzantene rulers , sons born while their parents already ruled the empire come first , sons born * before * their parents rose to power come after them . 
  you can fix that by granting your oldest son the title `` despot '' , which counts as being born in the purple . 
   and i 'm just a duke in the byzantine empire right now, 
  ah , right , i should pay more attention . 
  did the ai form the kingdom of greece ? 
  i thought they never do that . 
  in most cases : sie . 
  needs more details about the setting for a more determined answer . 
  e.g. , are you using first or last names ? 
  ( that 's basically a dead giveaway of wether you should use du or sie . ), 
   but i would be careful when you say `` unimportant '' . 
  i am being careful , that 's why i only chose the one obvious example : franklin 's sister is nowhere near as important as franklin - and that statement * still * makes her sound more important than she actually was . 
  actually , i 'll reply one more time , only about that comic . 
  1 ) i did not know that . 
  i do n't really know the founder of any other university either ( my own one excluded ) - i feel somewhat bad about that , but not about not knowing her specifically . 
  2 ) was elected to congress - big deal . 
  a hundred or so other people were newly elected to congress on that same day , and we remember hardly any of them . 
  3 ) how many inventors do you know ? 
  in modern times : edison and tesla , is that about it ? 
  hedy lamarr did n't actually invent wireless communication , just some technology that is now used in wireless communication . 
  if you ask wikipedia , [ she was n't the first person who invented it either . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frequency-hopping_spread_spectrum#multiple_inventors ) - do n't get me wrong , i still find this impressive . 
  but if you want to learn more about inventors , you might first want to learn about gutenberg , zuse , reis , von liebig , benz & otto , haber & bosch - and that 's just the german who 's inventions i found far more important in a quick check . 
  4 ) she was not one of the first airplane pilots overall . 
  so she only did something that thousands of other people had done before her . 
  5 ) rosalind franklin was about as important as watson & crick . 
  had she lived long enough , she would probably have shared the nobel price with them , and they might be equally famous now . 
  6 ) i read a lot about her , it 's a fascinating story . 
  but still , it 's mostly an amusing anecdote , and only important if you want to be a real specialist on chinese history . 
  - i 'd gladly concede that she 's more important than any male pirate ( except francis drake , if you want to count him ) . 
  those were probably six interesting biographies , but none of these women are unfairly `` left out of history '' .
