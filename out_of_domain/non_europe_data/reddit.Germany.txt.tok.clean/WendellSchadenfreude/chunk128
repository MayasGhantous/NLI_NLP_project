  if i had to choose between teaching somebody about all six of them or about ben franklin alone , i 'd chose franklin in a heartbeat . 
  i thought the same thing upon seeing the title of the article , but then the first paragraph says :, 
   ** the turkish military is holding kurdish peshmerga soldiers ** seven kilometers from the turkish border to syria , ** delaying their mission in ** the besieged city of ** kobane ** , peshmerga officials told rudaw . 
  the rules seem to allow using this quote as the submission title . 
   quotes from articles can be used as the title of your submission provided that it does not take away from what the message of the article is . 
  nice . 
  and you 're even able to pay for it . 
  that 's one of the more difficult decisions in the game , when your chancellor tells you he can get you a claim on a duchy for ~ 500 gold , but you are already close to bankrupt . 
  just remember : this claim is not heritable - go to war soon , or your ruler will die of an illness in a few months , and all the money was for nothing . 
  i become hideously rich by selling domesticated slugs in the future . 
  do n't ask about the details , you are not ready for this kind of knowledge yet . 
  but you will be by 2018 . 
  do i have to use it * purely * for making money , or can i improve the world in the process ? 
  i 'd go back in time and buy art from artists who died before becoming famous . 
  van gogh , cezanne , el greco , vermeer - some of them might have survived ( and painted ! ), 
  for years longer than they did if they had gotten some funds at the right time . 
  or some modern antibiotics , maybe . 
  i 'd buy some of their works , probably not even take them back with me in the time machine , but store them somewhere safe where i can conviently `` find '' them when i 'm back . 
  by selling * real * vermeers , i should become rich pretty quickly . 
  starting with impoverished painters , i 'd then move on to other artists - schubert , poe , ... - where i find it a bit harder to `` transport '' their works into our time and convince people that it is genuine . 
  as the final project , i 'd turn back to painters - those who did n't become famous even though they showed great ambition . 
  i 'd visit young aspiring painters suffering economic hardships in the early 20th century - probably in vienna , one of the culturally most influential cities at the time . 
  by sponsoring their careers , i feel i might really do some good for humanity . 
  buy them in the future , sell them in the past , live in the presnt ? 
  if you think you could do that to rockefeller , why ca n't you simply do it to a modern rich person , without any timetravel ? 
  either way , it 's illegal , immoral , and dangerous . 
  from what i can tell : good choice . 
  of course . 
  but it 's gon na be much more profitable after * the event * . 
  i plan to buy from current breeders , so it 's actually good for me that the industry already exists . 
  trapping two boars in one gorge . 
  i made two suggestions myself . 
  both of them are perfectly legal , ethical , and safe ( besides the inherent risks of timetravel ) . 
  and betting on sports events or insider trading strikes me as slightly less despicable than outright killing a man after coercing him to name you his heir . 
  especially since - if you are gon na force him to do something like that - you could have made him name your grandfather ( or some other relative of yours who was alive at the time ) , and then let him live out his days in peace . 
  get out of your fucking deep hole in the ground and have a little imagination !, 
  do you mean your father , or your father/brother ? 
   now go fuck yourself . 
  i would , if i had a time machine . 
  i hope this is true , but i already speculated before that most of the rebels in that area already left the pocket . 
  the jan fighters who attacked idlib last week and kicked some other rebel groups out of several villages around kansaffra must have come from somewhere . 
  i have no source for this whatsoever , but i suspect that they came from morek / kfar zita / lataminah . 
  the idlib attackers , or the guys in kansaffra ? 
  or is it also known that those were the same people ? 
  ask him what he would like you to do . 
  if i were him , this is what i 'd ask you to do : tell everybody who knows me and who knows her about why you do n't believe her . 
  this is so important , for a number of reasons . 
  - many of the people around them will believe her , at least to an extent . 
  these people think that your friend is a * rapist * - imagine if your own friends started believing that about you !, 
  if he is innocent , convinving his friends that he is is absolutely necessary so that he can keep his normal social life . 
  - it will also help protect possible future victims of hers . 
  i believe that false accusations of rape are rare , but why would we believe that a woman who falsely accuses * one * man wo n't accuse another one later ? 
  but ask him first . 
  maybe he does n't want you to share any of your knowledge about his relationships with other people . 
  this is just too mean for me . 
  therefore , i 'd first do it . 
  then , i 'd travel back even further in time , to a point where i have n't bought the books yet , and use my fortune to become jk rowling 's publisher . 
  that way , we both become rich . 
  i think these are nice . 
  i 'm surprised you know the guy 's name . 
  he never really made it as a painter . 
  yes . 
  help the world and become rich in the process . 
  what else would you have me do ? 
  da vinci certainly * was * an artist . 
  da vinci , newton , and einstein all became famous and at least somewhat wealthy during their own lifetimes , so i could n't really help them along * materially * . 
  - helping the stereotypical `` impoverished artist '' is easy - it 's enough if i even just bring them some groceries from time to time . 
  of course , i could give newton a modern physics book and help scientific progress . 
  but a ) i do n't get rich doing this , so i would n't answer the question , and b ) i 'm worried i might come back to a dystopian present after advancing science too quickly too early . 
  i 'll have my fun , even if this happens to have disastreous consequences . 
  deir ezzor is n't really a pro-government city , is it ? 
  i thought it was a poor and almost entirely sunni region . 
  i think you do , if it can create non-titular titles . 
  the drug that they are sometimes reported to be using is `` captagon '' . 
  if you google captagon + isis , you 'll find dozens of reports . 
  you 'll have to judge for yourself if any of them are credible .

   a basic change to a taxpayer 's account ** taxes ** about 14 days, 
  i ca n't tell if you did that on purpose ... 
  the us did n't play a role in the fall of the wall directly , but they were important for the reunification . 
  france and england were still very sceptical about having a united ( and thus more powerful ) germany in europe again . 
  margret thatcher is famously quoted complaining `` we defeated the germans twice , and now they 're back ! '', 
  - the us did n't share this fear of a united germany , and their influence was very important for convincing france and england . 
  [ wiki link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reunification#foreign_support_and_opposition ), 
  fsa is still an umbrella term for many different groups - although there are fewer than there used to be . 
  there certainly are some `` fsa '' groups who are allied with the ypg . 
  a few hundred of their fighters have been helping in the defense of kobane all along , a few hundred more were expected to reinforce the city at some point ( although i do n't know if this ever really happened ) . 
  the good news : you still get the ~ 500 gold from adventurers who attacked you . 
  i hope you understand the difference . 
  if i have a dog and three cats , and one of the cats dies , the number of pets i own has declined by 25 % . 
  100 % of the decline was in the most common pet species . 
  so , in the words of the article : `` number of pets declines by 1 . '', 
  in the words of op : `` number of pets declines . 
  study finds 100 % of a decline in cats ! '', 
  ( i cut myself . ), 
  ( i cut my hair . ), 
  so `` ich kaufe mich '' would also be grammatically correct , but only if you 're talking about a former slave who saved money and now is `` buying himself '' . 
  nice joke . 
  but the link only says that they have `` special forces '' , not a `` counter-terror '' unit .
