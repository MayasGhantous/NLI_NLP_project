  that 's not quite the same . 
  nope , syrian flag . 
  [ this is the ba'ath party 's flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/flag_of_the_ba%27ath_party.svg ) . 
  the saa does n't use that one , of course . 
  dismiss templars , hire mercenaries . 
  most important factor to speed up the ireland start ( without crazy heresy gambits ) : get a good chancellor . 
  search for characters everywhere , male , your religion , not rulers , sort by diplo - go through the first ten or so and find out if any of them happen to dislike their liege enough so that they might join your court . 
  it 's worth bribing someone ( ~ 20 gold for a courtier ) if that gives you a good chancellor . 
  you can also get them to join your court even if they like their old liege sometimes : marry them to one of your courtiers , then invite that courtier back to your court . 
  a chancellor with diplo 18 + will get you some claims * much * faster than one with diplo 12 or worse . 
  i think the regime has made some pretty significant progress in the map area even within just the few past months . 
  but if that 's not clear enough for you , simply compare [ the map to one from june last year . 
  at that point , it looked like the saa was pretty much done for . 
   i will no longer keep it secret :, 
   it was with thy sister, 
   thou hadst such a son, 
   hardly worse than thyself . 
  - not bad at all ... 
  the truck bomb was at the purple pin , in the red circle . 
  the ruins at the red pin will be fine for now . 
  if isis ever were to take the city , they would be destroyed , of course . 
  * are * you a doctor ? 
  that would be the first step for working as a doctor in germany . 
  ah , so the two requirements both have to be met . 
  i thought that was another `` or '' . 
  so as a non-sayyid and non-mirza , you need 1k piety * and * one of these province-groups . 
  as a sayyid , 1k piety * or * one of the province groups is enough . 
  as a mirza , you need one of these province groups . 
  your piety does n't matter . 
   look at these bitches , these pigs . 
  `` bitches '' as in literally female dogs ? 
   meaning fire worshipers, 
  if people ever want to insult me , i hope they call me a fire worshipper . 
  that is just the coolest derogatory term i have ever heard . 
   and he wished miscarriages on all my prospective children , 
  if you are of the same culture and religion as your liege , simply making him like you enough might work - he might simply transfer your de jure vassals to you . 
  do you know where this comes from ? 
  do the shi'a have some rituals that involve fire , or is this simply a historical thing that goes back to pre-shi ' a religions ? 
  in your decisions tab ( intrigue/plot menu ) , you should have the option `` upgrade tribal holdings '' . 
  before you can upgrade , you must first upgrade the province 's hillfort to maximum level . 
  just to add to the current answers : if i hear the name `` neidhard '' , i only think that it 's a name - i 've heard it before , and it 's not * obviously * a name with a meaning . 
  if your name really were `` envyheart '' , i guess everybody would try to find out if you 're an envious person upon first meeting you . 
  this is not the case with the name neidhard . 
  will need some more information . 
  `` syrian '' can mean so many things . 
  how old are you , and how old is she ? 
  why are you working together ? 
  which country are you even in ? 
  are they recent refugees , or old syrian diaspora who have lived there for generations ? 
  what religion are they , and you ? 
  will probably just ask more questions later , but these are some important questions for a start . 
   that 's why assad is also reluctant to fully attack is . 
  he needs them . 
  he 'd make more money by selling the oil himself , obviously . 
  but assad and isis * are * fighting each other , just look at deir ezzor for instance . 
  do n't try to find out . 
  it 's boring and stupid , and the more you try to find out what it * actually * is about , the more boring and stupid and complicated it gets . 
  i 'm very serious . 
  if you want to find out more about a complicated dispute , read up about syria or ukraine or american health care . 
  do n't waste any time on `` gamergate '' . 
  this article was written by robert fisk . 
  i think he used to write well-informed articles on syria - but lately , he keeps writing strange things . 
  in this [ recent article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-attack-on-idlib-assads-army-leaders-slaughtered-as-jihadists-storm-syrias-second-city-9822023.html ) , he claimed that isis had attacked idlib , when all other sources ( and basic logic ) agreed that it was jan. . 
  maybe this time he wrote about jan when it should have said isis just to make up for the earlier mistake . 
   because it 's not relevant to actual play . 
  this is how we humans still win . 
  we simply define the game human vs computer ( or computers against each other ) as `` not the * actual * game '' . 
  thanks for the very interesting link . 
  it illustrates very nicely how playing against a computer is different from playing against humans . 
  wrong question . 
  what 's nusra 's plan for the other rebel groups in the hypothetical case that both isis and assad are defeated , that 's the question . 
  just look at the regions were nusra and other non-isis rebel groups are fighting together . 
  it 's mostly the south ( dara'a ) and the region around idlib . 
  in both regions , nusra does as they please , and would easily overpower the other rebel groups any day . 
  [ comparable map of europe , ] ( http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/images/publications/mapsofthemonth/mom_february2013/semigra_high-quality.png ) but with a higher `` resolution '' . 
  ( [ if you only compare countries , women outnumber men in every non-tiny european country . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_sex_ratio#mediaviewer/file:sex_ratio_total_population_2.png ) ) ( no offense , montenegro ! ), 
  the numbers are also far more extreme because only young people ( age 25-29 ) are compared . 
  can we also get an american map that goes below state level ? 
   the militants from the islamic front will be required to give-up their weapons before they are mass transported to areas on the turkish border with aleppo . 
  upon their absence from the city of aleppo , the saa will have to allow u.n. groups inside the war-torn areas , while the former is allowed to reestablish checkpoints inside the once militant-controlled districts in the city . 
  i ca n't believe the rebels would ever agree to sign such a treaty . 
  have they commented on this at all so far ? 
  i prefer it this way . 
  this post is much better than the original , so it would have ended up either a highly upvoted comment in an obscure thread , or the bad original would have been pushed toward the frontpage by this this good reply . 
  we 'll have to ammend the rules soon :, 
   comments the likes of `` go fsa !, 
  '' , `` long live assad !, 
  '' , or `` liesaboutknowingyou rocks ! '', 
  will be removed . 
  do we know if these towns are currently still * inhabited * ? 
  i never heard anything about the local population during the isis advance - did they all leave , were the ones who stayed killed , or did many people stay and were left alone by isis ? 
  you want to press your wife 's claim against * that * ? 
  * sickening crunch *, 
  they usually take care of that themselves . 
  one more try at an explanation :, 
  a rabid dog could give a squirrel rabies by biting the little guy * very carefully * . 
  dogs are n't good at this , and the rabies does n't make it easier . 
  so usually , you end up with a squirrel that does carry rabies , but has unfortunately lost it 's head . 
  [ just play this video in the background , it will help .
