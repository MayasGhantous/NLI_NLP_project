  only if she 's trying to lose on purpose . 
  it 's actually a trial by 14 . , 
  even if it was about ways , it should still by `` many '' , not `` much '' . 
  the dead giveaway is your use of the plural `` have '' . 
  '' * much * and more * have * been tried '' is never correct , no matter what you are talking about . 
  in any case : thank you for being so understanding . 
  i * do * love correcting people . 
  i 'm not sure , but he might be talking about the horse . 
  * guest rights are n't what they used to be ... *, 
   throughout language , a double negative yields a positive, 
  that would be -1 *** x *** -1 = +1 . 
  excellent . 
  it means `` so be it '' . 
  technically , nothing to do with any god . 
  this never happens !, 
  do n't spoiler around . 
  the hobbit was first published in 1937 . 
   blue/brown + blue/hazel = 50 % chance you will have blue eyes . 
  should that be 25 % , or am i missing something ? 
  small question to the native speakers :, 
   and yet the menace of the years, 
  finds , and shall find , me unafraid . 
  i want to read this with a clear , audible pause between * me * and * unafraid * ; hardly any pause at all between * find * and * me * . 
  is that correct/acceptable ? 
  - i just find it odd that this diverts so clearly from the punctuation ; the pause would usually be where the comma is . 
  but it still seems to be the only `` good '' prosody . 
  oh god , no . 
  hopefully the better version of this * maybe * gets mass produced in 10 to 20 years . 
  mass producing this would be nothing but an enormous waste of money . 
  nope . 
  even today , video is n't used in soccer to help the referees . 
  but they are * thinking * about changing this . 
  k\u00f6ln or frankfurt , solid choices . 
  honestly , the artists probably just painted them so that adam and eve would n't look weird without bellybuttons . 
  wether they had any is n't mentioned in the bible , and god could certainly have created them with or without navels ; wichever he liked better . 
  [ qi covered this question , it 's really quite interesting .

  he has the personality of a lobster . 
  send that text , even if only to be polite . 
  worst case scenario : you make sure she does n't feel like a fool for asking for your number - even if she might not be interested anymore ; having to wait for two months . 
  best case scenario : fun february . 
  in this case , i thought the answer was `` because schalke '' . 
  your eyes , your shirt and the pictures ( well , the edges of the pictures ) * are * the same color , are n't they ? 
  for the record , i think you 're trolling . 
  but if so , you 're doing a damn good job . 
  other way ` round for me . 
  i already knew the xkcd , but i had no idea what it was talking about . 
  ( happens with xkcd . ), 
  i read bittechatte 's comment - which strangely i understand at once - and thought `` so * that 's * what the comic was all about '' . 
  your eyes look very blue to me , maybe grey/blue ; but not green . 
  in this picture , your shirt , your eyes and the `` frames '' of the pictures ( not the golden frames ; you know what i mean ... ) look the same to me . 
  i 'd say your shirt might be little darker and your eyes a little ligther , but still the same color . 
  i * think * i 'm `` normal-sighted '' . 
  not to be confused with / r/revolution . 
  most germans use these words completely interchangeably . 
  strictly speaking , * flaggen * and * fahnen * are different things , but most germans are not aware of the difference . 
  a * fahne * in the narrow sense is *** unique *** . 
  an army corps or a club might have a * fahne * : this means there is * one * piece of cloth with their colors on it , and they ca n't simply replace it . 
  i thing this woud be called a standard in english . 
  a * flagge * is not unique at all , there are usually thousands or millions of * flaggen * of one type . 
  the abstract alignment of a few colors ( black-red-gold , stars and stripes , ... ) is also called a * flagge * . 
  but once again : for most germans , these two words mean exactly the same thing . 
  this song is over , you ca n't just skip back to an earlier part of it , you have to switch to the next one :, 
  `` tell his reverence your story ! '', 
  `` normal '' german humor :, 
   `` we take you to the police station . 
  when we get there , we shoot you . '', 
  german black humor : shooting the guy . 
  then telling him you will shoot him again if he dies . 
  source : i 'm german . 
  loving this answer . 
  one more difference , of course , is that there are * other , legal ways * of getting nice things or feeding your family . 
  when you are in prison , the only way of getting your freedom before your time is done is running . 
  cheapest means of travelling might be [ mitfahrgelegenheit.de ] ( http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/ ) .

  nobody seems to ever drive from stuttgart to sylt , but stuttgart-kiel or stuttgart-hamburg are offered for ~ 40 $ . 
  also , why does it say `` house * nymeros * martell '' ? 
  should that not be just `` house martell '' ? 
  other than that : very cool - how can i get a few of those ? 
  aaaaaaaand it 's down , too . 
  [ here 's six of the best pictures on imgur .

  there 's certainly a lot we do n't know about time yet . 
  still , your view of it seems outdated to me . 
  we know that time is not the constant , unchanging background in front of which everything happens - time and space are kind of mashed up into each other , and mass influences both of them . 
  time passes more slowly close to heavy objects . 
  time slows down when you move quickly ( = close to the speed of light ) . 
  we know these things are true , the clocks of the gps satellites are basically constant experiments about this . 
  on some level , these facts are completely incomprehensible to our poor brains . 
  luckily , though , we * can * do the math . 
  i do n't even need to quote check this . 
  this quote alone shows his enormous wisdom !, 
  does he want you to ? 
  does he enjoy it when you talk about this stuff , or are you annoying him ? 
  i 'm guessing my advice ( as a fellow atheist ) is for you to just leave him alone , at least for a while . 
  i love my family , and i loved spending time with them over the holidays . 
  but the idea of spending * eternity * with them does n't seem inviting at all . 
  after even only a few hundred years , i know we 'd all be sick and tired of each other . 
  having only this one short life on earth is cruel and sad , and i wish it would last a little longer . 
  but still , when i think about it , the idea of eternity ( any kind of eternity ) often seems worse than death .
