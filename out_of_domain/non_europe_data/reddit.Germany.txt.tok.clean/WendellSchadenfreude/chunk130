  no , you do n't . 
  fuck all you people . 
  eli5 is * not * ** not ** ** not ** for literal 5 year olds . 
  it says so * everywhere * in that subreddit . 
  if you want `` you see , little timmy , ... '' explanations , go and make your own retarded sub ( or visit / r/explainlikeiama / ) . 
  that 's not a stalker , that 's a framed picture of his grandfather . 
  if you 're using a musket ... 
   i do n't really understand how the actions of the saa are really any different than is . 
  the government has already ruled syria for decades . 
  we * know * that they have n't eradicated all the minorities , which isis plans to do . 
  we also know they did n't institute slavery , or outlaw music , or eliminate * everything * except propaganda from the school curricula . 
  if you do n't see any differences between isis and the saa , look closer . 
   dont know why you still have to make jokes or something, 
  ... because this is reddit . 
  this is a very serious niche subreddit , but that does n't change the fundamentals of reddit : if you can make a joke , go ahead !, 
  granted , this may not have been very funny ( to you , at least ) . 
  for what it 's worth , it was n't meant to be a mean-spirited comment , just having some fun . 
  why is the coastal area so much darker now , too ? 
  were this pictures taken under the same conditions ? 
  same day , same time ? 
  that hospital near the center of the map is only grey to highlight it , right ? 
  it 's not an island held by isis in the middle of ypg territory ? 
   `` seven hells , this place is damp , '' she heard her guard complain . 
  `` i 'm chilled to the bones . 
  ** where are the bloody orange trees ? 
  i always heard there were orange trees in the free cities . 
  lemons and limes . 
  hot peppers , warm nights , girls with bare bellies . 
  where are the bare-bellied girls , i ask you ? '', 
   `` down in lys , and myr , and old volantis , '' the other guard replied . 
  he was an older man , big-bellied and grizzled . 
  `` i went to lys with lord tywin once , when he was hand to aerys . 
  ** braavos is north of king 's landing ** , fool . 
  ca n't you read a bloody map ? '', 
   because she was too old ( 29 ), 
  there 's the pretty one , and there 's the clever one . 
  it 's possible that this was a goof ; the man is n't infallible . 
  but i find it odd that we even get this spelled out : lemon trees do n't grow in braavos . 
  it 's such a random detail , there 's no reason this should ever have been mentioned . 
  i think the `` red door in dorne '' theory is older than the mercy chapter , so the fact that this detail is mentioned in the books at all makes it a lot more believable to me . 
  ( even though i 'm still not sure i really understand the significance of the location of the house with the red door . ), 
  who are then mercylessly slaughtered by your retinues , who were only one day away away from venice when you declared the war . 
  so what does `` captured '' mean here ? 
  did they actually fight ? 
  these two groups are both members of the `` islamic front '' , and probably the biggest two members . 
  if the two of them start fighting each other ( everywhere , not just in one location ) , the islamic front de facto no longer exists . 
   scotland had a study done , and legalizing it increases the rates of human trafficking and child prostitution . 
  i will not believe `` studies '' like that until they can provide a suggestion for a mechanism by which that might happen . 
  if you are willing to lure/abduct women from poor countries and force them into prostitution , you can do so wether the prostitution itself is illegal or not . 
  so why would * anyone * - even the most vile mafia gangs - start working in human trafficking and forced prostitution only * after * legal alternatives exist ? 
   here 's a link to a summary of their findings . 
  that 's a link to a campaign pamphlet or `` equality now '' , not to a government report . 
  i ca n't find the government report you talk about , but here 's a [ study that discusses prostitution in the netherlands . 
  ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-012-0088-z ), 
  consequences of the legalization are discussed on page 6 . 
  as a sidenote , you can learn from that article why simply stating that human trafficking increased after prostitution was legalized in the netherlands is disingenuous :, 
   in 2001 , 284 cases were reported , and in 2009 ,, 
  the higher figures are partly due the broader definition of the offence since 2005 , when the incidence of forced labor in sectors such as horticulture and the restaurant business were included . 
  the new, 
  article ( 237a penal code ) also recoded forced prostitution as, 
  human trafficking , regardless of whether national borders, 
  had been crossed . 
  it is therefore not surprising that since 2005 the most frequent country of origin of victims of trafficking was the netherlands itself , increasing to 39 % of all cases in 2008 , with a slight decline to 26 % in 2009 . 
  all of my friends are dead ... 
  yes . 
  if you simply google something like saudi + execution + woman , you 'll find many news stories of how the saudis executed women , e.g. 
  for witchcraft , idolatry , or adultery . 
   shoud i accept that a lot of people want to live under sharia for example ? 
  i accept that , for the most part . 
  if you want to live according to the rules you find in sharia , or the torrah , or the bible , or the book of mormon , or any other book , i 'm fine with that . 
  do n't drink alcohol , do n't eat pork , do n't eat beef , do n't smoke , do n't take drugs , do n't work on fridays , saturdays , or sundays , do n't swear , do n't commit adultery , do n't look at porn , do n't cut your hair , do n't wear clothes made by mixing different fibers , do n't listen to music that includes `` modern '' instruments , do n't have sex before marriage , do n't use birth control , ... - instead travel to mecca , pray five times a day , observe the ramadan , celebrate the eid , christmas , chanukkah , and easter , go to church and the mosque and the synagogue . 
  i 'm not going to tell you that you ca n't do any of these things , and if following these rules makes you happy , i 'm happy for you . 
  but they are not my rules , and i 'm going to fight you if you try to force them upon me . 
  isis has some weird rules , but nobody would have a problem with them if they only wanted to observe these rules * themselves * . 
  instead , they want to force them onto as many people as they can , and kill all those who refuse . 
  if you want to read more about stuff like this , maybe try [ `` the open society and its enemies '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_open_society_and_its_enemies ) by karl popper . 
  one thing you can learn even faster is how to spell [ hollandaise sauce . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hollandaise_sauce ) , 
  there seems to be some confusion in this thread , so just to clarify : they have entered the raqqah * governorate * , not raqqah city . 
  [ map of the syrian provinces . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governorates_of_syria ), 
   because he only said that at the time due the the circumstances of being surrounded by enemies . 
  germany during bismarck 's time had * one * enemy - france . 
  and it was france that was isolated in europe . 
  germany was allied with austria-hungary and russia in the [ league of the three emperors ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_the_three_emperors ) and with austria-hungary and italy in the [ triple alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triple_alliance_%281882%29 ) . 
  germany was also on good terms with england , and bismarck brokered an [ agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_agreements_1887 ) between england , italy , and austria . 
  this [ picture sums it up nicely ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/world_war_one_web_alliance.jpg ) . 
  these alliances only fell apart when wilhelm ii became kaiser in 1888 and decided to dismiss bismarck shortly after . 
  holy shit , that picture !, 
   distinguisation, 
  distinction . 
  there even is a nice expression : a distinction without a difference . 
  which is what we have with khorasan and nusra . 
  most of what he did * was * undone by wilhelm ii . 
  bismarck was an impressive politician , but crediting him with germany 's current wealth is a bit far-fectched . 
  the funny thing is that there was only this * one * co-conspirator . 
  you really want to go around telling people : `` the emperor and i plan to kill king humbert !, 
  it 's a huge conspiracy , involving him and me and nobody else . '', 
  how will that drunkard ever even get people to believe him ?
