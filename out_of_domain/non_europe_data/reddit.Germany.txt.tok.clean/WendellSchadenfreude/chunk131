  just imagine : he 's lying in his bed , incapable of moving , he 's only dimly aware of his suroundings , but from time to time , he mumbles : `` reinforce the right flank . '', 
  `` fortify the camp immediately . '', 
  `` where am i ? 
  mommy , is that you ? '', 
  `` send the mercenaries in first . '', 
  correct . 
  the character search you did was only for your realm . 
  there 's probably more abbasids left if you search everywhere . 
  still , it 's strange how they fell so low . 
   someone once told me `` if somebody tells you that they understand quantum mechanics , they 're a dirty fucking liar . '', 
  this seems to be the vulgar version of a popular richard feynman quote : `` if you think you understand quantum mechanics , you do n't understand quantum mechanics . '', 
  he is of house urbino , that sounds very much like he 's simply a relative of the pope . 
  i just wonder if he 's a relative of the * old * pope , or of the new one . 
  ( as you can see in the top right corner , the pope just died . ), 
  do we know that this video ( 1 ) shows isis , ( 2 ) is new and ( 3 ) was taken in aleppo ? 
  i did not know that there is any isis presence in aleppo .

  `` made in germany '' was widely used even when there were two german states . 
  `` made in west germany/gdr '' also existed , but were not universally used . 
   [ in 1973 , the bundesgerichtshof made a ruling that made in germany does not enable people to properly distinguish between the two germanys of the time , so made in west germany and made in gdr became popular . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/made_in_germany ), 
  i guess the same goes for `` printed in germany '' . 
  that sounds like something zapp brannigan might say . 
  `` you see , killbots have a preset kill limit . 
  knowing their weakness , i sent wave after wave of my own men at them , until they reached their limit and shut down . '', 
  becomes :, 
  `` the us only has millions and millions of bombs , so i simply kept sending soldiers to kobane to die . 
  when i realized that the us are producing * new * bombs every day , i simply sent more soldiers in faster and faster - we 'll see who runs out first ! '',

   neither of which were english speaking during the golden age of piracy ,, 
  the us was n't `` the us '' during the golden age of piracy , but it absolutely was english speaking . 
  i do n't understand the question . 
  i also do n't understand your answer . 
  just a word of caution : just because the daily mail reported on this does n't mean it actually happened . 
   so far , we just throw all this highly radioactive waste into old salt mines ( do a google image search on `` asse 2 '' ) . 
  asse 2 is not for highly radioactive waste and was never used for it . 
  i do n't really understand your basic argument . 
  germany already * has * nuclear waste , and has to take care of it at some point . 
  you might think that will be a huge problem ( i do n't think so at all , but that 's beside the point ) , but do you really think the problem will be much worse if it 's a little * more * waste ? 
  if we leave the plants running for another 40 years or so , it might be twice as much waste , but that will hardly be `` twice as much of a problem '' ... 
  has been like that for a while already . 
  a newer change is that the tiny yellow area around kobane has been expanding a little again . 
  ** if ** by `` factory area '' they mean [ shqayyef ] ( http://wikimapia.org/10063858/shqayyef-industrial-area ) , that means the rebels now really have no route into ( or out of ) the city anymore , except possibly through ( the kurdish district ) sheikh maqsood . 
  if so , that would be big news , since the regime could then begin the siege of the old town in earnest . 
  let 's wait for some confirmation . 
  checking if snopes has an article is always a good idea when confronted with apparent nonsense . 
  simply stating `` it 's impossible , nobody can be 179 years old ! '', 
  wo n't convince anyone . 
  being able to show that this whole story was originally made up by a site that officially publishes fake news stories is * much * better . 
  i think the statement was a bit less clear than that . 
  iirc they said they 'd let supplies for the fsa into the city - not for all `` rebels '' in general . 
  if there is no fsa left in the city ( as some claim ) , it might simply mean that no supplies will be let through at all . 
   advancing on 2 fronts : morek & hama-idlib main road . 
  but morek is * on * the hama-idlib main road ( the m5 ) . 
  i do n't understand what they mean by `` two fronts '' . 
  - is the saa also advancing south from the idlib area ? 
  one thing i 've been wondering for a long time , which never becomes quite clear from the maps : does the saa control the m5 highway between hama and homs ? 
   i guess we 'll see what happens now !, 
  what happens now is that you start raiding like hell . 
  save up all the gold you can get , keep at least 1k around at all times . 
  when the muslims come back for you , you hire all the mercenaries you can and try to take out their big armies before they can unite them all into an unbeatable doomstack . 
  right after you win a defensive war , or during a big revolt in the umayyad empire , or during a crusade against them , you strike . 
  450x , but you tried . 
  30s x 15/s = 450, 
  i guess since they were having a mock fight , they also wanted to have a mock beheading , which lead to the picture at the bottom left .

  considering the sub we 're in , i want to warn everybody : do n't click on these two links !, 
  they lead to misleading representation of data !, 
  click [ on this link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wbe7jqs.png ) and [ this link instead ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dgah8kn.png ) - they show the same data in a more acceptable way . 
  [ location ] ( http://wikimapia.org/6443633/kafr-nabudah ), 
  this is almost on the government/rebel frontline . 
   capitals all over the place, 
  i really do n't understand why other languages * do n't * do this . 
  you have capital letters , and you only ever use them for the beginning of sentences and for names ? 
  what a waste !, 
  capitalizing every noun simply makes reading easier once you get used to it . 
  german leaders in civilization games were usually bismarck and frederick the great . 
  i think those are a good choice . 
  for the most part , since germany was politically divided , our iconic historical figures were not politicians , so maybe the best answer would actually be goethe . 
  grammatical context also tells you which words are names , so there 's no reason to capitalize those either . 
  sometimes , care and experience are needed to tell wether or not a word is a noun , and this will make you misread a sentence for a few moments . 
  i just tried wrtiting such a sentence by using `` care and experience '' as nouns , two words that are much more commonly used as verbs . 
  you might start reading that sentence thinking they are verbs , until you realize it does n't work that way , and then you have to go back and re-read it . 
  ( only takes a few moments , of course , but still ... ), 
  english would probably benefit from capitalizing the nouns even more than german does , because you can [ verb ] ( http://aoife.allegracom.ca/images/verbing_sm.jpg ) so many nouns in english , and the difference is n't as easy to tell as it usually is in german . 
  belgium ( being a nato member ) is n't neutral anymore . 
  invading neutral countries is the most fun . 
  so i was thinking : maybe switzerland this time . 
  we just lulled them into removing the explosives from all the bridges between germany and their own puny country , so i guess we 're good to go .

  you are right , of course , but i think friedrich der gro\u00dfe comes closer than most other possible choices . 
  part of the reason : you say you `` worshipped '' him in dresden , saxony . 
  but friedrich was n't from saxony , he * invaded * saxony .
