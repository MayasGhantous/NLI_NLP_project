  and still , they were too impressed to stay mad at him . 
  why do you ? 
  they are n't different from other adjectives , so we do n't capitalize them . 
  in english , this would also help to make it clearer wether you are talking about something russian , or about * a * russian . 
  the article says so . 
  do n't you believe that they removed it all , or do n't you believe that they all were prepared for detonation in the first place ? 
  the english agreed to open a tunnel to france , thus reducing the military value of the channel that had protected them for a thousand years . 
  i think the swiss are really not worried about german tanks anymore . 
  fake teeth , obviously . 
  i have to admit i was a bit torn about that . 
  `` reading '' certainly [ * is * a noun ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reading ) , and should be capitalized if you use the german rules for capitalization - but doing this feels unnecessary , and i agree that it does n't improve readability at all . 
  so maybe we should n't simply copy the german rules after all , but adapt them a little . 
  in german , or in english ?

  i guess i 'll have to go through the effort and trouble myself with finding a better example . 
  ^ ^ did ^ ^ it ^ ^ work ? 
  i 'll just write another comment to explain how it was * supposed * to work , because i 'm not sure if it does . 
  i was hoping your brain would instantly see `` effort and trouble '' as belonging together . 
  if you were to read the comment out loud , this might make you stumble over the rest of the sentence , because you 'd rather expect it to be something like `` the effort and trouble * of * finding a better example . '', 
  but of course , `` trouble '' is a verb here , so you 're supposed to read `` go through the effort ( minor pause ) and * trouble myself * with ... '', 
  i 'm sure there are better examples still . 
  maybe you prefer this one ( [ from an article called `` is that a noun or a verb ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dailywritingtips.com/is-that-a-noun-or-a-verb-im-confused/ ) ) :, 
   the fear that the treasure wo n't be his troubles him throughout the film . 
  [ or this letter to the editor ] ( http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/08/07/when-a-word-is-both-verb-and-noun-confusion-results/ ) complaining that the headline `` thorndike woman 's death shrouds part of new burial trend '' was confusing . 
  capitalizing the article is really a bit much , but i think i get the example . 
  when somebody is talking to `` the godfather '' , you want to know what godfather that is . 
  when he 's talking to `` the godfather '' , it 's vito corleone . 
   as a saxon , how can you not like `` augustus the strong '' ? 
  oh , i would certainly choose him as the iconic leader of the * saxons * . 
  even over widukind . 
  might work as well . 
  personally , i would n't choose him , because he 's `` not german enough '' . 
  ( now that 's a slippery slope ... ) he was franconian , and considered himself a `` roman emperor '' - not `` german emperor '' . 
  actually , that 's another thing . 
  spaces between words are cool and all , we also use them in german sometimes . 
  but when two words clearly belong together , taking the space between them out makes a lot of sense . 
  the english-speaking world even acknowledges this , because you * sometimes * do this as well . 
  `` fire fly '' or `` key board '' would just look weird , because obviously : a firefly is * one * thing , so it should be one word as well . 
  but the train station also is one thing . 
  why is `` grandmother '' one word , `` great-uncle '' is two hyphenated words , and `` half brother '' two words ? 
  in german , those words are * gro\u00dfmutter * , * gro\u00dfonkel * , and * halbbruder * - one word each , no nonsense . 
  not sure if this is still of interest , but i think you 're ( mostly ) right . 
  this is not some society that happens to go by the name `` anime club '' - it 's the anime club of your school . 
  a club like that exists at many schools , just like the chess club and the marching band - and those also are n't capitalized . 
  but he is n't wrong either , because the name of your anime club almost certainly is `` anime club '' as well . 
  but if your anime club actually has a ( different ) name , then you are right . 
   i joined the anime club `` naruto 's friends '' . 
  i joined `` naruto 's friends '' because they are the coolest anime club ever !, 
  ( you ca n't capitalize `` anime club '' in these sentences . ), 
  i do n't understand your comment . 
  i do n't even know which language you 're talking about . 
  in any case , it 's '' * der * computer '' in german . 
  ... and explained twice why i did that . 
  ( hint : because it 's a noun . ), 
  i have to admit i was a bit torn about that . 
  `` reading '' certainly [ * is * a noun ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reading ) , and should be capitalized if you use the german rules for capitalization - but doing this feels unnecessary , and i agree that it does n't improve readability at all .

  you did , but for bad reasons !, 
  it 's not too late to correct that mistake !, 
  because you always know which words is a noun and which word is not . 
  we have other markers that show us where a sentence ends . 
  can you tell me what they are ? 
  i bet you can !,

  nonetheless , thanks for agreeing with me . 
  i would n't really call it a flaw either . 
  but the opposite happened in this thread : capitalization of nouns was listed as something weird about the * german * language - but it 's not a flaw , it 's a feature !, 
   the old man the boat . 
  damn , that 's a good example .

  are you using `` for '' for `` because '' ? 
  guess what my next suggestion would be !, 
  they usually come with a lot more than just 60k . 
  experienced players still beat them easily . 
  but if you do n't like them , simply turn off the dlc . 
  turn it back on when you can reliably start as a count and become emperor within 100 years . 
  the file you linked to does n't actually contain any data on literacy . 
  [ you need this one as well . 
  ] ( http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/age_level_data/c13/ddw-0000c-13a.xlsx ), 
  i made a graph for those who prefer to see the data without those artificial spikes . 
  [ click here . 
  my bad , half of it . 
  you actually need * both * files - the one you posted contains the population total , and the one i posted contains the total number of literates - to get the literacy rate , you need to combine these two numbers , of course ... 
  wow , that really exists ... 
  the top comment explained that : many poor people in india do n't know their exact age , so their age in surveys is guessed - usually as a round number . 
  these people are also especially likely to be illiterate . 
  it does n't take much for this effect to be visible . 
  imagine just 1 % of the people do n't know their age . 
  those people come from small , isolated villages , and almost all of them are illiterate . 
  so when they are surveyed , almost all of the 18-22 year-olds among them are registered as `` 20 years old '' - now the group of `` 20 year olds '' has four years ' worth of illiterates * extra * , while the adjacent age groups have fewer than they should have . 
  if the true illiteracy rate for all of these people is 10 % ( including the 1 % of people who are illiterate and do n't know their age ) , you 'll still find 9 % for the 19 year-olds , and almost 13 % for the 20 year-olds . 
  i think most of them simply * never * knew their age to begin with .
