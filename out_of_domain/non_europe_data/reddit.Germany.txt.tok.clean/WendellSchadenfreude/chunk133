  if birthdays are n't celebrated in your culture , you 'll never even ask the question `` how old am i '' - or at least , you wo n't expect an answer that is simply a number . 
  the average literacy of children 0-10 would be dramatically lower - half of them have 0 literacy . 
  ( literally 0 for all children 0-6 years old according to the survey data . ), 
  to be honest , however , i do n't know what exactly that plot did . 
  i just took what excel calls a `` floating average '' . 
  ( excel sometimes uses terms like this liberally . ), 
  so , what * do * they mean , in layman 's terms ? 
  asking wikipedia , preponderance of the evidence : `` the standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true . 
  effectively , the standard is satisfied if there is greater than 50 percent chance that the proposition is true . 
  lord denning , in miller v. minister of pensions , described it simply as ` more probable than not . ' '', 
  - that sounds pretty much like `` 51 % '' to me . 
  and `` beyond reasonable doubt '' : `` proof beyond a reasonable doubt , therefore , is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one 's own affairs . 
  however , it does not mean an absolute certainty . 
  the standard that must be met by the prosecution 's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime , thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty . '', 
  - ok , `` does not mean an absolute certainty '' . 
  in everyday language , that still sounds close enough to `` i 'm 100 % sure '' to be eli5-acceptable . 
  had that been my post , i would not edit it . 
  you 're not talking to `` the religious majority '' in here . 
  killing a lion ( or , more commonly , a cow ) is never considered murder . 
  killing a human usually is . 
  i think there is a good reason for that . 
  i also first thought he was talking about a version where you either kill five strangers or sacrifice * yourself * . 
  on second view though : he wrote `` consciences '' , not `` consciousness '' . 
  so would you let extra people die because pulling the lever and killing them would make you feel bad ? 
  ( i think that 's not the question . 
  you might even feel worse for * not * pulling the lever , and still think that it 's the right choice . 
  or not . ), 
  when you wrote `` authority monkeys '' , were you thinking about shakespeare ? 
   but man , proud man ,, 
   dressed in a little brief authority ,, 
   most ignorant of what he 's most assured ,, 
   his glassy essence , like an angry ape ,, 
   plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, 
   as make the angels weep ; who , with our spleens ,, 
   would all themselves laugh mortal . 
  this is the point where you crossed from justice to pure vengeance . 
  very good . 
  i just thought i 'd provide context for our less literate friends . 
  hello , similarly little socially apt friend !, 
  i think most people understood the tone that my statement was made in . 
  this can be hard on reddit , so do n't feel bad about taking a little too serious what was written in jest . 
  i 'm not sure i understand what i 'm looking at . 
  is this a screenshot from the game ? 
  or is it a screenshot in the background , and somebody shopped the `` photo '' in there ? 
  i think that 's why his pants look so short . 
  ( we 're focussing on the important parts here . ), 
  thanks . 
  never played dayz . 
  sure there is . 
  he could institute slavery , for instance . 
  or openly call for genocide . 
  but he 's on the side that * doesn * t do stuff like that . 
  the us bombed raqqa as well . 
  there are good reasons to do that . 
  this attack did n't come from the besieged city center , but from the outside . 
  out of curiosity : how old are you ? 
  i 'm 30 , so this was long before my time , but i thought it was common knowledge . 
  ( i mean this in the least offensive way possible - i 'm just curious . ), 
  spd+fdp still had a very harmonious coalition in rhineland-palatinate until 2006 . 
  it only ended because the spd received an absolute majority of mandates ( which sounds even more absurd today than the idea of an spd-fdp-coalition ) . 
  they even offered to keep the coalition running despite having no need for a partner , but the fdp declined . 
  let me just check if i can find * this * comment on the screen ... - oh , there it is !, 
  you 're right , then . 
  pretty . 
  is that really a current picture ? 
  i would have expected lada cars to be rare even in serbia nowadays . 
  as a sidenote , this is of course the old gdr embassy . 
  they liked practical architecture ... 
  i do n't simply want to say `` relevant xkcd '' in r/science , but [ this xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/938/ ) does explain the idea of using hiv to treat leukemia . 
  fascinating interview . 
  i only miss a question about the kurds and their future in syria . 
  from the title alone , i would have expected some sort of space science fiction , probably with light sabers and phasers and shit . 
  for the record : it 's not . 
  you do n't have to be into sci fi stuff to like this movie . 
   after their northern ranks have been decimated by saa offensives and the inter-rebel conflict . 
  ... and defections to isis . 
  can we please go back to * not * downvoting posts like this ? 
  it 's a factual contribution to the discussion . 
  we might not like what it says , and it might not even be correct , but this sub is so much better if content from people with contrasting opinions is visible . 
  switching to seniority succession should work just fine in this case . 
  colors should be reversed . 
  the top part is just awkward and desperate . 
  the bottom bit is comedy gold . 
  * half * god ? 
  [ fool , do you want your head bashed in ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thor ), 
  it 's strange how a castle like that has become the best defense against one of the most dangerous weapons in this war again : vbieds ca n't touch you up in there . 
  no , the next bridge downstream is in mayadin , some 30 km south . 
  you do n't need to look for isis ' motives in deir ezzor at all : the * government * brought the fight there , isis is defending . 
  they are simply trying to prevent the government from reaching * their * goals . 
  ( taking the oil fields , controlling the euphrates valley , cutting lines from and to raqqa ), 
  and that 's why the tree is a braid . 
  op could have said that clearer , but that does n't make the math wrong . 
  fuck that . 
  5 bucks for two lines of code ? 
  ( * removing * two lines of code at that . ), 
  do n't encourage that kind of money-grubbing . 
  they should simply include a checkbox `` gender equality '' at the start of each new game , for free . 
  ( i 'd never even use it , but this is something so simple i do n't understand why pdx does n't do it . ), 
  i do .
