  if we tolerate the use of chemical weapons because the enemy is isis , then next time someone will argue that you can also use them against jan , or against hamas , or against insurgents in chechnya , or against separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  yes . 
  a mountain . 
  does n't work , because this would only be `` x of y people found this joke funny '' in this case . 
  i wish people would qualify how good they are at this game in their answers . 
  i 'm a total newbie , but a veteran in ck2 . 
  about ck2 , i can tell you an almost game-breaking secret : buildings suck . 
  the game becomes much easier if you never build anything ( until you 're swimming in money and do n't know what to do with it ) , but spend all your money on mercenaries instead . 
  for euiv , i tried this same approach and so far failed miserably . 
  this might be because buildings are more important in euiv , or because i 'm just generally terrible at this game ( for now ) . 
  the time until even the best buildings repay their original investment . 
  for economic buildings , it 's roughly 100 years ( for the best ones ) . 
  after 100 years , you only have your initial money back - for one complete century , you would have been better off even by simply doing * nothing * with your money . 
  but of course , you do n't do nothing - you keep it in the treasury and wait for a good moment . 
  then you hire mercenaries , and conquer one more province than you would otherwise have conquered - instead of improving one single holding in one of your provinces , you now have a shiny new province with all of it 's 2-5 holdings . 
  you get * far * more money from that than you will ever get from building stuff . 
  more personal levies might not be all bad if you do n't have legacy of rome . 
  but really , the better solution is to simply * get * lor , because retinues are awesome . 
  that might be so ( i think it 's not anymore in the current patch and has n't been for a while ) , but even so : if mercs are not available , your first goal is to conquer a province that * makes * ( more ) mercs available and move your capital there . 
  after that , start the game for real . 
  ( this is only if you are playing for efficiency , of course . 
  if you want to be a builder , be a builder . ), 
  you forgot [ fulfillment house . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fulfillment_house ), 
   often more then you can transport via boat ( so you need to build stuff to get more boats ! ), 
  that used to be a big problem for iceland , but it 's not anymore since you can now `` seize merchants ships '' ( or something like that ) when you are at war , which gives you 20 ships for 50 gold . 
   actually building more cities in your provinces is pretty sweet if you have high taxes on the towns . 
  i might believe you , if you provide a rough calculation for how long it takes until you get your initial investment back . 
  500 + gold that you need to build a town is enough to hire two mercenary companies and pay them for a year , roughly . 
  before you build a new town , think hard if you might prefer to have some 4,000 additional soldiers any time soon . 
  and by `` any time soon '' , i mean within the next 50 years at least . 
  if , by using those mercenaries , you can conquer ( or hold ) even one single county , building a new holding instead is * never * going to catch up . 
  if it 's a decent county with 3 + holdings , it 's never even going to be close . 
  if you can conquer an entire extra duchy , you 'll just laugh about that guy who decided to build a new city instead . 
   then recruit them whilst they were almost dead, 
  damn , that 's clever . 
  you 'd need to define this a lot clearer . 
  thinking about historical examples , the best i could come up with are [ the huguenots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huguenot ) , french protestants . 
  they were officially tolerated by the ( catholic ) french government for a long time , but when the tolerance edict was repealed ( in 1685 ) , at least 200,000 of them fled the country . 
  many of them were highly educated , and for some european countries like prussia or sweden , the crafts and technologies that they brought with them were immensely important . 
  this is n't quite first world to third world , and it might not fit your definition of `` mass migration '' either , but it 's the closest i could come up with . 
  na , but i like the idea of being able to flag posts as jokes . 
  a joke is n't a bad post , but it 's not really `` helpful '' either . 
  wow , only 67 years . 
  if you ca n't find a target that you want to attack with mercenaries over a period of 67 years , you 're being too timid . 
  and those are just the best economic buildings in the game . 
  level ii or building new holdings are even worse than * that * . 
  was n't that changed in the latest patch , so that you only get the money from banishment if the character was a traitor ? 
  these virtues are * shared * by communists , that does n't make them communist virtues . 
  [ disneyland ] ( http://www.germs.nl/disney/maps/dlrpair1.jpg ) or some similar theme park . 
   and then those europeans take to the street and protest `` the islamisation of the west '' . 
  as if the crusades never happened . 
  how in the world do you draw a logical connection from one of these sentences to the other ? 
  tough speech for someone who complains about others separating humans into `` us '' and `` them '' . 
  `` we '' are a collective not only of all christians today , but even of those 1,000 years ago ? 
  as a sidenote , you realize that `` down there '' was mostly christian before it became muslim , right ? 
  in october , more than 400 extremist muslims [ attacked a kurdish demonstration in hamburg , germany . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20141008/eight-hurt-in-hamburg-street-battle-isis-kurds-salafists-islamists ) i think such proxy wars warrant a strong reaction , and the crusades or the holocaust do n't factor in there at all . 
   160 words for ` camel ' in the arabic language, 
  i was sceptical for a moment , but then again : think about how many words for `` horse '' english has . 
  colt , foal , yearling , stallion , bronco , filly , mare , mustang , gelding , steed , nag , plug , hot - , warm - , and coldbloods , pony , destrier , charger , palfrey , bay , chestnut , pinto - and then an endless number of compound words ( plow horse , war horse , racehorse , ... ) and of names of different breeds ( [ wikipedia list of easily more than 160 different breeds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_horse_breeds ) ) . 
  so yeah : that 's probably true . 
  the first law prohibiting/regulating child labor that i know of was issued in prussia in 1839 - its purpose was to protect children 's health enough so that they might later be drafted . 
  [ [ german wikipedia ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/preu%c3%9fisches_regulativ ) ], 
  if you ca n't find an older law , i 'm gon na call prohibition of child labor a militaristic ideal . 
  mechanization of agriculture is quite obvious - who * does n't * want to mechanize agriculture ? 
  capitalist certainly do . 
  this is n't really an ideological question at alll . 
  i guess the idea of educating children is also older than communism by a few thousand years . 
  the rest can be argued to be `` socialist '' , although they really are neither exclusive to socialism , nor are they at the heart of what people usually mean by `` socialism '' . 
   like even if he loved slavery with all his heart ,, 
  not that it 's important for the point you are making , but as a sidenote : [ he did n't . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_e._lee#lee.27s_views_on_slavery ) some claim that he was outright opposed to slavery , and while this is probably exaggerated , he certainly did n't `` love it with all his heart '' . 
  i would n't call that a fact , considering that lee argued he fought for the south * because * he could n't fight his own country . 
   '' [ ... ] how can i draw my sword upon virginia , my native state ? '', 
  you might think it 's obvious that loyalty to the union should come before loyalty to your own state ; but we ca n't necessarily demand this of people 150 years ago . 
  never ~ ~ saxonish ~ ~ . 
  * saxon * is fine . 
  i 'd prefer [ * saxonian * ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/saxonian ) for things pertaining to the state of saxony ( the modern state or any of its precursors ) , [ * saxon * ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/saxon ) for things more closely pertaining to the people . 
  jesus war aram\u00e4er . 
  you should now either take your meds , or * stop * taking them . 
   foxconn workers have committed suicide and the company installed netting to prevent it . 
  this point alone is enough to know that you are arguing exclusively based on emotions . 
  this can be very convincing , but often leads to crappy conclusions . 
   [ the suicide rate at foxconn during the suicide spate remained lower than that of the general chinese population as well as all 50 states in the united states . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foxconn_suicides ), 
  ( i hope you read german . ), 
  this reminds me of something that [ * usa erkl\u00e4rt * ] ( http://usaerklaert.wordpress.com/ ) wrote about differences between anglo-saxons and germans when it comes to ( accepting ) presents :, 
  what did i do wrong ? 
  i do n't understand !, 
  the whole article is called `` why americans do n't say what they think '' . 
  the blog is written by an american trying to explain america to germans , but many articles might also be interesting for you . 
  then go ahead and * find * that matching statistic , instead of just talking out of your ass . 
  foxconn employs several hundred thousand people . 
  a few of them * will * commit suicide every year . 
  unless the number of suicides is * significantly * higher than should be expected , i see no reason to blame the company for anything . 
  for hundreds of thousands of people , this company provides a steady income . 
  the working conditions certainly are n't great by american standards , but you have to apply * chinese * standards . 
  would china be a better place without this company and similar ones ? 
  would the employees really be better off if we embargoed the company ?
