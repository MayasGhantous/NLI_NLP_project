  do n't feed ducks bread , it 's bad for them . 
  here 's some suggestions what you can feed them instead :, 
  cracked corn, 
  wheat , barley or similar grains, 
  oats ( uncooked ; rolled or quick ), 
  rice ( cooked or uncooked ), 
  milo, 
  birdseed ( any type or mix ), 
  grapes ( cut in half ), 
  frozen peas or corn ( defrosted , no need to cook ), 
  earthworms, 
  mealworms ( fresh or dried ), 
  chopped lettuce or other greens or salad mixes, 
  vegetable trimmings or peels ( chopped ), 
  [ [ taken from this article ] ( http://birding.about.com/od/birdfeeders/a/whatduckseat.htm ) . ], 
  and you jump back to nothing but emotions and rhetorics . 
  you 'll make the world worse all your life , and you 'll always have a clear conscience doing it . 
  i was surprised by this as well , but they seem to know what they 're talking about . 
  [ birdfeeding myths . 
  ] ( http://birding.about.com/od/birdfeeders/tp/birdfeedingmyths.htm ), 
  rice can kill birds, 
   the myth that uncooked rice will swell and kill birds -- or in more colorful versions , cause the birds to explode -- is one of the most persistent and most false . 
  many types of birds eat different grains regularly , including rice , with no ill effects , and rice can be a nutritious addition to many birds ' diets . 
  leftover rice is one type of kitchen scrap that can be safely added to feeders in moderation , and the birds will eat it happily . 
  might want to contact [ snopes ] ( http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/birdrice.asp ) about this then . 
  you will find good and bad stories about any provider . 
  i just switched to o2 , for one reason only : they have contracts without a minimum required duration . 
  if they provide bad service or low speeds or piss you off in any other way , you can always cancel your contract at a month 's notice . 
  the only other providers i would consider are telekom/congstar if you want are willing to pay a premium for what probably is the best service ; or kabel deutschland since they use a completely different technology and can be the fastest provider in some regions . 
  also quite cheap if you want to combine internet and tv . 
  whatever anybody else tells you : go to o2 , and nobody else . 
  just make sure you have no minimum required contract duration . 
  if they ever do anything mean , quit your contract immediately . 
  any other company * can * fuck you over , and it will take 12 months or 24 months until you can do anything about it . 
  go with o2 , and they ca n't really do anything bad , because you 'd be gone by the end of the month . 
  the mainstream theory is still that america ( except maybe the bering strait area ) was settled around 13,000 years ago . 
  any finding much older than that is controversial at best . 
  starting with the clovis culture ~ 13,000 years ago , you find human artifacts in the americas * everywhere * . 
  if there were humans before that , we should expect to find a lot of their artifacts as well , but we do n't . 
   ottoprussian ( sp ? ), 
  ostpreussen , or east prussia . 
  temperate * is * confusing - it 's a long fuse . 
  so the picture shows a bomb that is eventually going to go off , only it might take a while longer than you expect - a strange interpretation of the word `` temperate '' . 
  [ picture ] ( http://www.ckiiwiki.com/file:temperate.png ), 
  i always thought it was bacon haging on a rack or something , [ like this ] ( http://www.sausagemaker.com/tutorials/bacon/hanging_raw1.jpg ) . 
  might be way off . 
   ( or aircraft as recently shown ), 
  you 're talking about an aircraft on the ground , right ? 
   i 've never even seen is with that many tanks on a single front . 
  without the word `` even '' , this sentence would mean something like : `` i 'm surprised isis is using so many tanks ! '', 
  with the word `` even '' , it means something like : `` it 's surprising that so many tanks were used in one front , because even isis - who are very well equipped - has never used so many tanks at once . '', 
  he 's not saying that * this * was isis . 
  which date format do they use ? 
  is this a picture from december 6 , or from june 12 ? 
  i do n't see how you would justify using log scale here . 
  there 's nothing logarithmic about a country 's currency reserves . 
  it would also make the data almost impossible to read . 
  i can see how that makes sense for investment charts , but this is about crrency reserves . 
  i still think it makes more sense the way the data are shown now : you 'd get a straight line if the reserves were falling by 50 billion a month , not if they were falling by 5 % each month . 
  we ( westerners ) only call it that because we first heard of this bridge from [ the reports of marco polo . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marco_polo_bridge ), 
  this is of course not true for the chinese , who first heard of the bridge - and gave it a name - when they built it . 
   i remember merkel begging the west to `` understand '' putin and to `` give him what he wants . '', 
  since you put that in quotation marks , i 'm sure you can provide a source for when she said that . 
  judging from the headlines about merkel and ukraine/crimea from this spring and summer , [ it seems like an unlikely quote . 
   angela merkel , the german chancellor , has pomised that russia will not `` get away '' with `` annexing '' crimea ... 
   merkel , hollande push for ukraine sanctions, 
   sanctions against russia over ukraine must continue : merkel, 
  it 's where cognitive dissonance does both , obviously . 
  do n't leave us guessing , tell us * what * it reminds you of . 
  because if it is nazi germany , you probably just need to learn more history . 
  germany did * not * go to war because the ecomony was tanking - [ the economy was doing just fine . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/bspdrweltkriseengl.png ), 
  if you leave copper around , your sister 's going to steal it . 
  i guess it 's '' * why * do you even [ ... ] '' . 
  anonymously telling somebody that they should leave or shut up because everybody hates them is n't a `` prank '' . 
  and writing a column for a newspaper is n't a prank either . 
  looking at the map , i do n't understand how taking a picture of the castello highway and [ haritan ] ( http://wikimapia.org/5205581/haritan ) together would be possible at all , regardless of controlled territories . 
  [ great britain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_britain ) is an island . 
  it 's been around for a bit longer than that . 
  what 's a mu ` man ? 
  i googled it , but that did n't help . 
  germany . 
  drinking beer in public . 
  not restaurants , but in a park or simply in the streets . 
  if you do n't look like a hobo and are n't noisy , nobody will think poorly of you for having a beer in a park , in the streets , on the train . 
  talking * loudly * . 
  this is often exaggerated , but germans do often talk a little louder than people in many other countries - that does n't mean they are angry , it 's just the normal conversational level . 
  looking at people . 
  staring at people can be seen as aggressive or invasive of course , but germans seem to be more tolerant of this than other people - it 's ok to take an interest in other people , you do n't have to pretend not to notice them at all . 
  invading weak neighbouring countries . 
  that 's just something we do . 
  speeding . 
  it 's well known that there are no speed limits on ( some parts of ) the german autobahn , but it 's not quite as well known that many germans care less about speed limits than most westerners . 
  if you go some 20 km/h over the speed limit , most germans will be ok with that . 
  the fines for speeding are also much lower than they are in most other countries . 
  eating raw meat . 
  [ mett ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mett ) is delicious . 
  just to be sure : we are only talking about saunas here , right ? 
  if a family simply walks around the house naked ( `` it 's sunday , no need to put on clothes .
