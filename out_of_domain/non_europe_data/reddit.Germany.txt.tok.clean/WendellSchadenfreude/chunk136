  '' ) , they would still be considered weird , would n't they ? 
  i do n't know much about how easy or difficult moving to germany as a foreigner is . 
  i know your ( certified ) qualifications will be important if you want to get a work permit . 
  for visiting , everywhere in germany is fine , really . 
  there are no big empty deserts , there 's a lot of history and cute little villages everywhere . 
  pathetic whataboutism . 
  `` you 're a nazi ! '', 
  `` yeah , but you killed the indians , so we 're even . '', 
   where i live in america it 's apparently alright to call any german a `` dirty fucking nazi '' . 
  there is no such place in america . 
  if you regularly get called a nazi as an insult , you 're doing something wrong . 
  who 's calling you that ? 
  what 's the situation ? 
  yes , and all those 80 million natives were deported into concentration camps by the us and then gassed to death . 
  there are at least twice as many [ native americans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas ) as there are [ jews ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jews ) today . 
  ( counting all the indigineous people of the americas - because that 's how bkh853 counted to get to his 80 million . ), 
  even in the us alone , there are 3-5 million native americans . 
  saying that their cultures are n't alive is insulting or ignorant . 
  jews in germany were very regularly described as vermin . 
  even officially , they were n't described simply as `` humans '' , but as [ * untermenschen * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermensch ) , sub-humans . 
  if you really want to one-up the holocaust by referencing the fate of the indigineous people of the americas , you 're gon na have a bad time whenever you run into someone who knows even a little bit about history . 
  [ here 's what the captain thinks about this . 
  ] ( https://sinigami.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/picard-facepalm2.jpg ), 
  that 's an interesting argument i had n't heard before . 
  however , i doubt that a hospital could ever make more money from offering euthanasia than it could get for a full course of chemo therapy . 
  i expect hospitals would always have an economic incentive for offering alternatives to euthanasia . 
  `` they '' being not 80 million , but 10,000 . 
  i 'm not saying the indians were treated nicely . 
  but trying to one-up the holocaust by comparing it to the fate of the native americans is an easy way of showing that you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  just quoting the relevant bit :, 
   crude oil is the traditional starting point for the many plastics that are essential to modern life . 
  ** approximately five percent of worldwide oil production is used to make plastics . 
  ** the products of numerous intermediate steps are high-quality precursors that can be used , for example , to make foams found in countless everyday items . 
  plastics also in most cases do n't use the same fractions of the oil that could be processed into fuels easily . 
  we burn the short carbon chains and turn the longer ones into plastics .

  searching this exact quote on google yields zero results , and i 'm a bit suspicious why this russian scientist would talk about bunrning dollar bills . 
  * raul , raul , it rhymes with foul . 
  * raul , raul , it rhymes with howl . 
  as he is slowly being tortured to death in the dreadfort . 
  ( btw , do n't tell me that `` raul '' could or should be pronounced differently . 
  in westeros , it rhymes with * foul * . ), 
  you have many answers already , some of them quite good , but i still want to give you another answer :, 
  i usually * do n't * make fun of religion , except when i 'm around friends whom i already know to be atheists . 
  i agree with you that it would be just rude to make jokes about ( e.g. ), 
  christianity around people who might be christians . 
  ( i think most atheists see it like this , but you are on / debateanatheist , and we 're a pugnacious bunch . ), 
  making fun of religions should obviously be legal , but it 's not a nice thing to do when you are around religious people . 
  but when i 'm among fellow-nonbelievers , or when i 'm watching comedians , i think religion is a fun topic . 
  if you knew many people who actually believed in voodoo or in the healing power of pepsi , you might also make fun of them . 
  merry christmas and a happy solstice !, 
  so many people answered that it 's not a theory , and they are right of course , but i feel like nobody gave a * good * explanation as to * why * it 's not a theory , so i 'll give it a try . 
  for an idea to be a theory , there has to be an answer to the question : * if * this idea is wrong , what could we possibly ever find to show that it is wrong ? 
  for evolution , there are hundreds of easy answers . 
  most of them include fossils , for instance : if you were to find the fossilized bones of a modern cat or a modern human who lived two billion years ago - the current theory of evolution would clearly be wrong . 
  if we were to find centaurs ( half horse , half man ) or any other kind of `` mixed '' animal , this would also disprove the theory of evolution - contrary to what some nutters believe , `` crocoducks '' actually are * not * something that evolution would make us expect . 
  also , if we were to find out that some modern species do n't have dna , but have some completely different method of storing genetic information , the theory of evolution would at least need to change a lot . 
  if these animals , instead of normal dna , had a genetic code that spells out the new testament , we could throw evolution out the window . 
  if aliens landed on earth and - despite having evolved on a different planet - they turned out to have the same dna as humans , this would also show that the theory of evolution is at least incomplete . 
  for `` intelligent design '' , no such finding would ever be possible . 
  crocoducks ? 
  the designer is n't just intelligent , he 's also amusing !, 
  an animal that has no dna ? 
  well , why would a superhuman creator * not * use some other way of storing genetic information ? 
  since `` id '' could - * in principle * - never be shown to be wrong , even if it is/were wrong , it can not count as a scientific theory . 
  evolution on the other hand - i can say this with confidence - will never be shown to be wrong , because it * is * correct ; but if it * were ` nt * true , there would be thousands of ways to disprove it . 
   which was toxic to life , bearing in mind he left out oxygen , , , , , , , , ** why ? 
  ** , , , , , , , , cause he knew oxygen would oxidize the mixture . 
  there was no oxygen in earth 's early atmosphere . 
  oxygen was introduced into the atmosphere only when photosynthesis started , some 2.4 billion years ago . 
  this introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere caused [ a mass extinction event , by the way .

  being able to identify all the different trees in a forest , being able to tell what mushrooms are edible , knowing how to skin a rabbit - a few thousand years ago , these things would only have been called `` not being an idiot '' . 
  nowadays , they are n't necessary anymore , and we respect people who still know something about them . 
  we do n't usually respect people who know how to boot a computer and write an email , because * everybody knows that * . 
  atheists usually do n't post such disclaimers .

  ( if you find this amusing , i have succeeded . ), 
  what if it * does n't * ? 
  the base number you use is mostly arbitrary . 
  using one with many factors ( like 12 ) has some advantages , but they are n't that important . 
  granted , using base 11 or base 13 would be somewhat annoying , because they have no factors at all . 
  it 's more important that all `` dimensions '' have the same base number . 
  for instance , if you know that you 're travelling at 80 miles per hour and you want to know how long ( in * minutes * , of course ) it will take you to reach a gas station that 's 11 miles away , that 's a difficult calculation to do in your head - and it does n't even get easier in european metric . 
  in french metric , 80 miles per hour would be 0.8 miles per minute , so you know that it will take 8.8 minutes , or 8 minutes and 80 seconds , to reach that gas station . 
  wow , i just realize that i want this system now . 
  as to the factors , we 'd get used to that . 
  a third of a metric hour would simply never be used , you 'd talk about tenths instead . 
  or directly about 10/20/30 minutes . 
  of course , this still means there are 12 months in a year , and 3 weeks in a month ; so it 's still not entirely base 10 . 
  weeks had 10 days , but months had 3 weeks , and years had 12 months . 
  adding five [ national holidays ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_republican_calendar#complementary_days ) at the end of the year . 
  six in leap years . 
  i like how you translated 5 days correctly into `` a half week '' . 
  there 's also basically 9 `` national holidays '' from christmas to new year 's in the current calendar . 
  the french complementary days had the advantage of being in september , which is much nicer for celebrations . 
  you just gloriously proved the point that even the most obvious and glaring contradiction found in a `` holy book '' will always be explained away by believers . 
  the same thing you did in the rest of this thread .
