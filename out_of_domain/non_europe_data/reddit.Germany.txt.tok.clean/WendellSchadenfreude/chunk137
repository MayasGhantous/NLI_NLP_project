  people who believe in `` holy books '' are fucking weird . 
  you just have to give up the antiquated notion that the time of the day or the time of the year should be closely related to the position of the sun in the sky . 
  every month gets ten weeks , every year ten months . 
  after 100 weeks ( = 1,000 days ) , a new years starts . 
  we will have three winters every year . 
  it 's like an anti-got world . 
  a day lasts ten hours , or 1,000 minutes , or 100,000 seconds . 
  so as to make this less confusing , we wo n't change the length of the good old second , so one day will now be a bit longer than it used to be . 
  ( 100,000 seconds instead of 86,000 . ), 
  this means that the sun will sometimes set at midnight and sometimes at noon , but honestly - what does the sun have to do with any of this ? 
  he is quoted as saying that , but it seems nobody knows anything about the specifics . 
  for instance , the most important point : would the kurds also cooperate with non-fsa rebels , i.e. 
  the rebel groups that actually control most of eastern aleppo ? 
  if your train barely has to slow down at a station , you can have stations closer to each other . 
  that way , fewer people will want to get off the train at each individual stop . 
  in the gif , there are two of these little extra carts . 
  one is at the station first and leaves with the train , one starts on the train and remains at the station . 
  so the train would exchange its cart for a new one at every station , and each station would exchange its cart with every passing train . 
  one of tens of thousands of planes that fly every single day . 
  give me $ 100,000 and i 'll squander it for you in no time . 
  that 'll boost the economy !, 
  and it 's so much easier than giving that money to 100 different people in small amounts . 
  there are good reasons to have a minimum wage law , and there are good reasons to raise the minimum wage from time to time - but doing that just so that irresponsible people have more money they can waste sounds like a bad reason to me . 
  the money you put in your savings account is n't simply gone either . 
  you 're just giving it to somebody else who will use it . 
  that gets especially clear if you use some of your savings to buy stocks . 
  as i said : gim me loads of money , i 'll squander it all . 
  if it 's good for the economy , i 'm willing to do my part . 
  me neither . 
  it 's a fun idea to play around with , but i do n't think we 're ever going to build anything like that . 
  only the people who walk into the extra cart get off . 
  it 's the headline with an exact quote from the article added . 
  op even made it somewhat clear where the headline ends and the quote begins . 
  [ burg eltz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eltz_castle ) is ( part-time ) inhabited by the same family that has lived there since the 12th century . 
  it has never been destroyed , and it 's open for visitors almost every day , except for the part where the owners live . 
   a quick google scholar search revealed several articles supporting the idea that bonobos were more peaceful and female dominated than chimps . 
  which is what he says in the article . 
   females are not dominant over males in the sense that all male chimpanzees are dominant over all female chimpanzees . 
  this is a very poorly understood area and we predict that future results will show that their dominance system is more to do with mother/son coalitions . 
   bonobos are violent . 
  granted they are not as violent as chimps but then what animal is ? 
  the question is just : are they really peaceful and female-dominated in the wild , or are they female-dominated and peaceful only if you take chimps as the only benchmark ? 
  since chimps are violent and completely male-dominated , * humans * are also peaceful and female-dominated compared to chimps . 
  i 'm not telling you what you should do , but when i was young , you could simply copy + paste the first sentence of any wsj article into google to get access to the full article .

  i wanted to leave this comment like that , but i hate when people post `` nsfw '' stuff when it seems like it 's probably sfw by european standards and i 'm not sure if i can safely click the link . 
  so to explain : hodor was already shown naked in season 1 , as the linked image shows . 
  osha comments that he `` must have giant 's blood in him '' , because of his * size * . 
  this is a good one . 
  i think i never payed an rpg that scary - maybe you should make one . 
  this gets somewhat funny if the game is n't set in detroit at all . 
  you 're marching through a half-medieval , half-postapocalyptic country haunted by demons and weird creatures , just trying to survive and maybe find some normal humans anywhere , and then you meet monximus , who greets you with : `` i 'm from detroit ; fuck off ! '', 
  by the way , i realized that the description might still be one of detroit .

   do you want me to try to translate the fb comments ? 
  i 'd appreciate that . 
  i can understand the gist of it , but a translation would be nice . 
  thanks . 
   also , this study is probably manipulated , as the german right wing ( nazi ) party ususally only gets 3 % . 
  and your only explanation for this is that the study must be rigged ? 
  the idea that these people might in fact * not * all be nazis does n't cross your mind at all ? 
  meanwhile hundreds of people from germany are fighting in syria and iraq , making this the largest foreign deployment of germans anywhere in the world . 
  you think it 's a relief that there 's swedes fighting on both sides of a foreign war ? 
  you are right of course that i 'm worried more about the people fighting on the side that 's doing most of the raping , beheading , and enslaving ; but claiming that there are hundreds of swedes fighting on the other side as well does n't really make it much better . 
  they get that if they invest $ 5 of their own as well . 
  which is probably something they could afford .

  [ 7 ] kinda correct - but easily misunderstood the way you translated it .

  best read the translations posted above for more detail . 
  now you 're the one throwing all immigrants in with each other , generalizing to all immigrants from a statement about the average immigrant . 
  besides , direct social welfare is n't the only way in which people benefit from a state , so comparing only the amount of welfare a group receives to the amount of taxes that group pays is an incomplete comparison at best . 
  immigrants benefit from roads , hospitals , fire departments , schools , etc. 
  just as much as other people ; so if you 're interested only in the economic aspect of immigration , you need to figure in `` their share '' of these costs as well . 
  [ suddenly , a lake !,

  the eye is drawn too much to the huge desert areas , and it 's hard to tell which changes actually mattered . 
  the severity of that problem barely scales with regard to size . 
  if you know what to do with 1 million tons of `` nuclear waste '' , you also know what to do with 2 million tons . 
  you 'll probably put them in the same abandoned mine anyway .
