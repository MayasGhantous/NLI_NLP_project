   until whats inside you completely decayed away, 
  except of course you 'd be long dead before even 1 % of the uranium has decayed . 
  not because it kills you , but because the half-life of uranium is so long . 
  i was immediately thinking about [ lindybeige 's video `` a point about drawing swords '' . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzbfui0pmda ), 
  * my * point is that there are nuclear power plants already . 
  so there * will be * nuclear waste to deal with , and it does n't matter much how much waste it 's going to be exactly . 
  so when you try to decide wether ( more ) nuclear is a great option at the moment or not - the waste should hardly influence your decision at all , because there will be nuclear waste either way . 
  this is true regardless of wether you think that the waste is n't a big problem to begin with , or wether you think that the waste managment is a big issue without any proper solution . 
  even if we never figure out a clever thing to do about the waste , if we end up storing it in a parking lot under the open sky somewhere indefinitely - making that parking lot twice as big is unlikely to cause big additional problems or even high additional costs . 
  does n't a metal sheath make a sword go dull quickly ? 
  are there advantages taht a metal sheath has over one made of leather or wood ?

  if you are threatened by a big coalition , * do n't * stack up more ae . 
  most importantly , you should n't have complained . 
  beginners often lose in euiv , * because * it is a good game . 
  be happy about this !, 
  how much fun would the game be if you could stomp everyone into the ground right from the very start ? 
  making them release nations sounds like a good idea to me , well done . 
  other than that , just listen to general burgdorf : you should have waited a few years more . 
  wait for ae to decay , improve relations with some of the coalition members enough for them to leave the coalition , reduce your overextension , find a new ally or two , pretend to be a good neighbour - * then * go on another conquering spree . 
  i 'm glad you 're taking this so well - i got kind of annoyed because this is subreddit is so full of whiny people . 
  we are stunned and saddened by the sudden passing of my brother detlev . 
  our deepest sympathy is with you . 
  for a variety of reasons , we unfortunately ca n't make it to the funeral . 
  myself , i recently had an operation on the left knee and i 'm currently suffering from heart issues ( angina pectoris ) again . 
  we hope you can understand this . 
  it has not been a good year for us . 
  in april , my sister helga passed away ; in june , my bother-in-law werner ; in september , my son lutz from my first marriage ; and now detlev -, 
  all the best wishes to you now ,, 
  be strong and remain full of good hope for the future .

  socrates had not been in politics at all and was still considered a troublemaker . 
  plato on the other was in politics for a while . 
  wiki :, 
   [ throughout his later life , plato became entangled with the politics of the city of syracuse . 
  according to diogenes laertius , plato initially visited syracuse while it was under the rule of dionysius . 
  during this first trip dionysius 's brother-in-law , dion of syracuse , became one of plato 's disciples , but the tyrant himself turned against plato . 
  plato almost faced death , but he was sold into slavery , then anniceris bought plato 's freedom for twenty * minas * , and sent him home .

  say you write * usrname * in a comment and then realize the typo - just correct it to * username * and be done with it . 
  if you must , add an explanation at the end of the post . 
  as a reader , i 'd never be interested in the story behind your typos , i just want to see the easily readable final comment . 
  when people point out mistakes in my comments , i usually just edit out the mistakes and reply to the person who found them with a `` thanks , i fixed that '' . 
  that way , the original comment simply looks nice , but you still have a documentation of the mistakes in the comment history , if there 's anyone who cares . 
  i do n't like `` vergessen sie nicht '' at all . 
  when the living and the dead talk with each other , they use `` du '' almost every time . 
  - it would really help if you could simply tell us the context of the phrase . 
  * sounds good for many contexts . 
  ( * nicht vergessen * sounds like the beginning of a grocery list . ), 
  * vergiss mein nicht * might work . 
  literally `` forget me not '' , including the archaic grammar . 
  or * unvergessen * ( `` unforgotten '' ) - since languages work in different ways , using this far-from-literal translation might also be best in some cases . 
  or use a complete phrase , * wir werden dich nie vergessen * , as a promise of the living to the dead . 
  how intensively do you shower ?

  i think it 's mostly the dead skin that you rub into the towel that starts smelling bad after a day or two .

  these words alone are terrifying . 
  in many cases , having only one child would n't make life for that one child much better . 
  it would only mean you have a high chance of ending up an old person without any children at all , because your only child died of some disease at 4 years old , or of an infected wound at 4 , or from a disease at 6 , or in an accident at 7 , or from a disease at 9 or 11 , or in war at 14 , or giving birth to your first ( stillborn ) grandchild at 17 .

  better have a few kids more , so that you are relatively sure to have at least one or two living children when you 're old . 
  also , how do you even * stop * having more kids ?

  this was an at least semi-serious suggestion a few years ago .

  this was my favorite suggestion : create the world 's highest artifical mountain , right in the center of berlin .
