  links , please . 
  seriously asking , i want to know what you are refering to . 
  han should probably be hans . 
  schmit is fine , although schmidt would be more common . 
  dimitri is too poor for a last name ? 
  you were doing fine until you simply accepted her using `` aaaaarg '' as an argument . 
  other than that , she 's just playing dumb . 
  she believes that the murderers in paris were motivated by their lack of a sense of humor ... ? 
  other maps do it , for instance the [ wikipedia map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:syrian_civil_war_detailed_map ) . 
  in the north ( specifically : the idlib gouvernorate ) , fsa and nusra are clearly not simply on the same side . 
  what i like most about this is that the thames , the rhine , and the seine used to be tributaries of the same river . 
  my sister-aunt is trying to murder me . 
  this could be right from / r/crusaderkings . 
  germany is doing very well also when you look at european ( or other international ) statistics that use the same method in all countries and have no reason to present germany in a favorable light . 
  the governments in all other countries also want to look good , there is no reason to believe that the german statistics are any less accurate than french , greek , or polish statistics - or than german statistics ten years ago . 
  if you only take into account those who contribute to social insurance ( `` sozialversicherungspflichtige '' ) , the numbers are still vastly improved , from [ 26.178 million in 2005 to 28.921 million in 2012 . 
   but if jon is his son , it all makes sense . 
  damn ... 
  i heard mance = rhaegar before , but i never thought about what this would mean for his relationship with jon . 
   technically unemployed, 
  you ca n't say `` technically unemployed '' when you mean `` technically employed '' . 
  possibly `` underemployed '' , as in `` would maybe like to work * more * but ca n't find that kind of job '' . 
  but this also happens in other countries , so it 's mostly a moot point in an international comparison . 
   this shows how insecure they are * in their beliefs * . 
  i think you still have a lot to learn about atheism . 
  that being said , i ( as an atheist ) find this picture disgusting and pointless , and i think op is a rude and tasteless person for posting it . 
   why are you here browsing this sub if you feel that it is a `` cesspool '' ? 
  because i * wish * the most prominent atheist subreddit were a little more mature and presentable , and i hope that my comments as well as my up - and downvotes are a contribution to making it so , albeit a small one . 
  as a fellow german , i 'm actually outraged that such dumb anti-american propaganda is spread in our schools . 
  is there any context that might make this more acceptable , or is this really just `` haha , look how stoopid the americans are '' ? 
  i believe i have better reason than most religious people when i tell people that they should act a certain way . 
  but that 's not even important : * telling * people how you believe they should be acting is generally not a problematic thing to do . 
  absolutely . 
  but the medium is the message , and i do n't think op 's message has any chance of getting through to anyone . 
  it 's just too blatantly crude and vulgar , and thus sadly casts a bad light on our subreddit . 
  i 'm actually worried by how unprofessional this looks . 
  [ here 's an article from `` the jewish daily forward '' that mentions a series of comics that ch did about jews . 
  ] ( http://forward.com/articles/212292/why-charlie-hebdo-must-be-free-to-offend-all-ev/ ), 
  more people believing wrong ideas does n't make those ideas right . 
  i do n't like communism . 
  roughly as many people live in ( nominally ) communist states as there are muslims in the world , and it used to be a lot more just 30 years ago . 
  and i 'm sure most of these people are/were actually nice enough - but that does n't change my view on communism . 
  saying that an idea or a system is inherently bad is not making a blanket statement about all people who hold that idea or suffer under that system . 
  [ here 's a study that tested ( among other things ) the methanol levels in several alcohol products in lithuania and hungary . 
  ] ( http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/alcalc/44/1/93.full.pdf ), 
  methanol was found in most of these products :, 
   methanol was detected in concentrations ranging from not, 
  detectable to 29 g/hl p.a. 
  ( lithuania ) and 20 g/hl p.a. 
  to 616 g/hl, 
  ( hungary ) . 
  although they still say :, 
   the current eu limit for naturally occurring methanol in some fruit, 
  spirits is 1000 g/hl p.a. 
  ( which equates to 0.4 % vol . 
  at 40 % vol . 
  none of the samples exceeded this limit . 
  the level above which toxic effects are expected ( 2 % vol . ), 
  substantially higher than the eu limit ( paine and dayan , 2001 ) . 
  in our samples , ** it appears that methanol content did not pose a, 
  threat to public health . 
   they were quick to post his name and picture as being guilty, 
  as being * suspected * . 
  see for instance these articles :, 
  [ manhunt continues for suspects of charlie hebdo attack ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4159552.htm ), 
  [ police raid apartment in hunt for terror suspects as france reels ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2015/s4159375.htm ), 
   she is still under arrest, 
  not according to op 's article . 
   hamyd 's sister , who is married to cherif , was taken into custody on wednesday and freed on saturday . 
  there really is n't that much that has to be `` taught '' . 
  our bodies are designed to have sex , we 're all pretty much naturals at it . 
  and `` bad sex '' is still fun . 
  if you have sex with a guy without telling him that it 's your first time , he probably wo n't suspect a thing . 
  that being said , if you tell this to a guy your age or up , he is unlikely to be put off by it . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  i did n't even notice , but this `` info `` graphic makes a statue at 182m height look about twice as high as the next one at 153m . 
  shame on them . 
  it 's meters . 
  for instance , [ christo redentor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_the_redeemer_%28statue%29 ) ( 39.6 `` mts '' ) , according to wiki , is 38 meters high including the pedestal , and weighs 635 metric tons - i 'm amazed that they actually include this number in the article . 
  large city . 
  provincial capital . 
  controls the euphrates river and valley , thus cutting isis ' supply lines between syria and iraq . 
  the area is rich in oil and gas . 
  defending a city is much easier than giving it up and reconquering it later . 
  is this a case where the comment is downvoted because the user is turkish ? 
  ( edit : was at -4 at the time of my comment . ), 
  obviously , it 's not the us airstrikes * alone * - but without them , isis * would * have taken the city without a doubt . 
  we are * quite certain * that there are no dolphin-like creatures anywhere in our solar system except on earth . 
  throughout the history of science , almost all people who believed what `` everybody '' considered nonsense have been wrong . 
  in some very rare cases , the crackpots turned out to be actually right - these exceptions became famous , but it does n't change the fact that they were * rare * exceptions . 
  if you believe there might be dolphin-like creatures on jupiter or pluto somewhere , do n't try to hold your breath until we find them . 
  if we 're lucky , we may yet find * life * somewhere else in our solar system - expecting highly evolved creatures with a brain and stuff is a bit much . 
  i love magic . '', 
  - cute . 
  not that it 's comparable to today 's islamic terror cells , but if you 've never heard of `` jewish people forming terror cells and murdering people '' , you should read the wikipedia articles about [ irgun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irgun ) and [ lehi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehi_%28group%29 ) , two militant organizations in palestine under the british mandate . 
   it should be noted that the burqa is not directly mentioned in the q'ran . 
  it is not required by islam . 
  why should this be noted ? 
  lots of things that * are * mentioned in the quran are illegal in civilized states , and/or should be illegal . 
  wether or not something is mentioned in an old book should n't have an influence on modern laws .
