  judaism actually is the first . 
  but yes , you are right : judaism , christianity , islam . 
  thanks for posting this , very interesting . 
  have you checked out / r/exmuslim ? 
  always an alternative if things get too christianity-centered around here . 
  i do n't even understand his reasoning . 
  does he mean you are harming your children by sending them to the caravan thing ? 
  harming them by being an atheist ? 
  or that you are a hypocrite because you are parasiting on church resources by sending your kids there without being a `` paying member '' ? 
  in any case , i do n't think you 're doing anything wrong . 
  if your kids enjoy going there and the church is ok with it - everybody wins . 
  sibiria is surprisingly green in summer . 
  mesmerized ? 
  the idea that you were memorized is quite mesmerizing and memorizable , too , but it does sound weird . 
  it 's actually `` schadenfreude '' , no capital f. 
  and yes , i do enjoy this . 
  you are right . 
  i only want to say this to make sure thehunter does n't think that this only your opinion . 
  evolution only started about * 10 billion years * after the big bang , [ when life first arose from inorganic matter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abiogenesis ) . 
  the two have nothing to do with each other .

  who gives a fuck about rules , grammar , or the oxford comma ? 
  judaism was n't / is n't founded on the talmud ( alone ) . 
  the fact that jesus was a jew makes it kind of hard to argue that christianity is older than judaism , imo . 
  i 'm guessing it 's because meassuring time is difficult . 
  you can very easily define a standard length or weigth . 
  thus , every country , every region even used their own set of units . 
  producing a ( rough ) physical representation of a standard unit of length or mass is easy , you just make some metal rod or brick . 
  defining a standard unit of time ( much shorter than the - for obvious reasons - universally used * day * ) is much harder . 
  it was basically impossible until mechanical clocks were invented , and for a long time , these were only used in clock towers . 
  i realize at this point that i have n't really given a good reson why there should n't be different systems for meassuring time , but i do n't feel like writing any more at the moment . 
  my god , it 's full of stars !, 
  wow , i really did n't know that and would n't have believed it without the video . 
  do you know if the outer part is also edible/used in other ways ? 
  it 's not begging the question at all . 
  calling jesus `` assyrian '' sounds rather off - did you mean aramean ? 
  ( yes , the languages are somewhat related ... ), 
  the talmud is not the only jewish book . 
  sure , judaism changed over the centuries - but so did christianity . 
  dammit , people - i asked selthor !, 
  i already got 5 good answers from you - how do you think he 's gon na come up with anything better than that ? 
  srsly : thanks , everybody !, 
  also , coconuts seem fantastically useful . 
  i get the feeling they are a better proof of god than bananas ... , 
  why not just teach him some stuff about religion/christianity ? 
  since these are kids , you can easily use all the silly stuff ... , 
  not to convert him , obviously , but because right now he might feel like he 's dumber than the other kids because they * know * about some stuff that he has no idea of . 
  about the end of the world , maybe just show him how christians ( and others ) have always been expecting that to happen during their lives and thus done some ridiculous things . 
  to expand this a little :, 
  do n't teach him much about the stuff that is * in * the bible , teach him something * about * the bible , christianity , etc. 
  - stuff that the other kids do n't know . 
  maybe even about religious persecution - i think the story of how giordano bruno was burned for pointing out that the earth is not the center of the universe is surely interesting , if you do n't think it 's too brutal for an 11-year old . 
  it 's not even true that the company is 100 years old .

  worse than evil spirits !, 
  [ so great was the devastation brought about by the war that estimates put the reduction of population in the german states at about 25 % to 40 % . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war#casualties_and_disease ), 
  [ one result of the war was the division of germany into many territories -- all of which , despite their membership in the empire , won de facto sovereignty . 
  this limited the power of the holy roman empire and decentralized german power . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war#political_consequences ), 
  and really , the others are right : `` germany '' never really * was * a powerhouse before 1870/1871 . 
  france for instance was probably stronger than any german state at almost any point in time for as long as it existed . 
  ( not usually stronger than all `` german '' states combined , but there is no reason why you should combine them . ), 
  i do n't think that 's what he 's talking about . 
  what grrm keeps complaining about is how he has so many extra tasks because he is unable to say no . 
  obviously , when he complains about this , he is not talking about winds/dreams , but about all his other work . 
  and he does have a lot of that . 
  i basically agree . 
  the only problem is that the terms are n't always used consequently . 
  the probably most famous * schloss * , [ neuschwanstein ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/fd/46/c5/neuschwanstein-castle.jpg ) , for instance - that 's a * burg * to me . 
  have you tried option 2 with a slightly longer copy + paste text ? 
   sorry for using this standard message of rejection of you . 
  being a lady , i get a fair number of messages a day , and it 's pretty easy to ignore the unwanted ones that just say `` what 's up ? '', 
  or `` wan na hook up ? '', 
   your message , however , was nice and provided some incentive for me to respond , but i still know i 'm not going to be attracted to you . 
  to save both of us the time and trouble , this message is the only answer you will get from me . 
   i hope you have better luck next time !, 
  something like this ? 
  being rejected never feels good , but i would prefer a `` no , thanks '' to deafening silence . 
  this message might at least help with guys who just do n't realize that girls get lots of messages on okc . 
  bargeld is cash , as opposed to all kinds of `` eletronic '' money . 
  this way , you say that you just do n't have any cash right here , right now - you might still be rich as a nigerian prince , but you ca n't pay for anything * right now * . 
  was that friend of arianne always called * spotted slyva * ? 
  not * spotted sylvia * or something ? 
  slyva ... sounds weird . 
  i always feel the word `` lock '' is a bit vague . 
  does your door have a handle on the outside ? 
  could i ( no experience in lock-picking , no tolls , ... ) just open it without a key , just like a door between two rooms ? 
  i sometimes do n't `` lock '' my door either , put i always pull it shut , and after that , there 's no obvious way to tell the difference . 
  `` and then give them away for free . '', 
  but darned - you already forgot it again . 
  did n't you ?
