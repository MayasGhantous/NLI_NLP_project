  from wikipedia :, 
   typically , popular visual media depict the flamethrower as short-ranged and only effective for a few meters ( due to the common use of propane gas as the fuel in flamethrowers in movies , for the safety of the actors ) . 
  contemporary flamethrowers can incinerate a target some 50 -- 80 meters ( 160 -- 260 ft ) from the gunner ; moreover , an unignited stream of flammable liquid can be fired and afterwards ignited , possibly by a lamp or other flame inside the bunker . 
   there are voices , even among conservatives , which think loudly about arming even the pkk . 
  why `` even '' among conservatives ? 
  the conservatives are always the most interventionist political group in germany . 
  ( they still usually are quite reluctant , but less so than the parties on the left . ), 
  that being said , even kauder ( the guy quoted in your linked article ) said he would n't arm the pkk against turkish wishes - i.e. , he would n't arm them , ever . 
  source : the interview where he said it . 
  [ in german . 
   impure blood refers to the blood of those singing it . 
  got any links to those historians ? 
  i 'm fairly certain the `` impure blood '' is simply * german * blood , and at least [ giscard d'estaing agreed with that interpretation . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_marseillaise#criticism_and_controversy ), 
  given that the song was created during a war of the french republic against several monarchies , your interpretation seems unconvincing . 
  they took most of it within just a few days , but since then , the frontlines on the island seem to have barely moved at all . 
  i 'm sure that anyone who posted insulting drawings of mohamad * on this subreddit * would get banned quickly , and i 'm ok with that . 
  even with complete freedom of speech , i can still kick you out of my house ( or my subreddit ) if i do n't like what you say . 
  and since this subreddit would be impossible without the contributions of many muslims - some of them not entirely `` moderate '' - there is a good reason to disallow comments that insult islam or mohamad . 
  freedom of speech means that anyone who does n't like this could open their own subreddit with laxer rules without fear of repercussions , but i doubt that this would be very succesful . 
  for anyone confused , [ here is the post that this is in reference to . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1y6lhe/what_is_the_worst_thing_someone_has_said_to_you/cfhtedq ), 
  it 's one of the single most funny ( and famous ) comments on reddit . 
  you 're welcome , you fucking retard . 
   they are saying how the spilling of blood in god 's name has once again become permissible . 
  are they saying that it has become permissible * for them * ( essentially threatening their enemies ) , or complaining that others ( e.g. 
  daesh ) see it as permissible ? 
  edit : also , since i 'm asking dumb questions - are they speaking persian , arabic , or some other language ? 
  ( sorry , i ca n't tell the difference . ), 
   he did say `` most '' moderate muslims, 
  not sure if you 're not a native speaker or you just did n't read that carefully , but as saadiul pointed out , `` the most moderate muslims '' is not the same as `` most moderate muslims '' . 
  instead , it means `` even those muslims who are more moderate than any other muslims '' .

  does anybody have a map of the situation in homs that 's more up-to-date [ than this one from april ' 14 ? 
  ] ( http://www.syrianperspective.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/twitter-petolucem-new-map-military-situation-....png ), 
  in april ( after this map was made , apparently ) , a ceasefire was negotiated for the old town of homs . 
  if i remember correctly , most rebels surrendered , while some opponents of the agreement were allowed to evacuate to the ar-rastan area . 
  this area is still in rebel hands ( mostly jan ) until today . 
  nope , he 's with jan.

   except for the fact that a few individuals have already been found guilty of being apologists for this attack and have received jail sentences this week ( one got a year in prison with at least 3 months that must be served ) for publishing their support on social media websites . 
  any links to those cases ? 
  since the attack happened only eight days ago , i 'd be impressed if france already managed to arrest , prosecute , and sentence some of the terror sympathizers that celebrated it . 
  thanks for the link . 
  looking at these cases , i do n't see anyone who should * not * have been punished . 
  telling police officers that you want to mow them down with a kalashnikov is n't `` freedom of speech '' . 
  i just hope the french prisons are now paying more attention to imprisoned fanatics and isolating them from any other prisoners . 
  orthodox and protestants have never really had much contact . 
  orthodox and catholics have , and i think there was some bad blood between them e.g. 
  [ during the time of the latin empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_empire ) . 
   they were spending their time reading and learning . 
  now if this is n't true , i do n't think i even want to learn the truth . 
  it 's just such a cute idea that this guy travels to syria to fight the infidels , but ca n't get where he wanted to go , so instead he just does what he could have been doing more comfortably without ever going to syria .

  their toilets . 
  toilets in civilized countries do n't have to clog up , ever . 
  i do n't own a plunger , and i do n't know anybody who does . 
  i think most non-americans do n't even know the * word * for plunger in their own language . 
  ( i did n't know it in german , i looked it up because of reddit . ), 
  those exist in germany , too , for some newspapers . 
  why would you take more than one , really ? 
  the trust system even works even though these machines are stupidly easy to open without putting any coins in them . 
  they suck . 
  the problem is that they do n't suck enough .

  i do n't know how they are technically different , i can only tell you : toilets in western europe do n't ever clog unless you throw stuff in there that really does n't belong there . 
  this is an often repeated story , but certainly not from the quran . 
  [ see islamhelpline.net for instance . 
  ] ( http://www.islamhelpline.net/node/7632 ), 
   respected sister in islam , although the record of this particular incident is found in almost all the books of ` seerah ' or biography of the prophet ( saws ) and is oft-repeated by the muslims , to the best of our knowledge there is no record of this specific incident in any of the authentic and established books of sunnah . 
  and allah alone knows best . 
   if someone has invented and concocted the incident from themselves and attributed it to the prophet ( saws ) , they shall have their due from their lord on the day of judgment ; and if the incident is indeed true , then it is well within the exalted standard of character of the noble prophet of allah ( saws ) . 
  this is still a great way to deal with those who insult you - be shockingly generous towards them . 
  so the lesson here is the best lesson you could learn about ethics : it does n't matter if mohammad ( or anybody else ) acted a certain way . 
  you should decide for yourself on the basis of logic , compassion , and empathy wether something is good or bad . 
  that is interesting , thank you for sharing it . 
  however , king abdullah will not be around forever - he is 91 years old and not of sound health . 
  unless his eventual successor shares those feelings toward hariri and assad , they may soon not matter any more .

  yes , obviously . 
  think about this : assisted suicide ( as ) being * illegal * means that it is illegal for everyone , under any circumstances , no matter how intensely they are suffering and how much they wish to die . 
  this is such an extreme position that i do n't even know how to formulate the opposite extreme . 
  `` everybody has to kill themselves , right now ! '' ? 
  `` everybody who gets sick must take poison '' ? 
  at the very least , it would be `` as is legal for anyone , for any reason , without any conditions . '', 
  - a position that is still so extreme that hardly anyone would support it .
