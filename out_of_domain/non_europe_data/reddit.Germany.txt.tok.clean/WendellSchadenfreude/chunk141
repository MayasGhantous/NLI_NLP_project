  we should n't support the extremists on the other end of the scale either . 
  i can understand if you decide * for yourself * that you would never commit suicide . 
  but where does anyone find the damn certainty to forbid everybody else from doing this , no matter what the circumstances are ? 
  assuming that the above story also was about the wife of abu lahab , it would be true that the quran mentions her , but it really does n't tell the story . 
  for those interested : there is no more context . 
  irocz0r quoted [ the entire surah ] ( http://quran.com/111 ) , we do n't learn anything else about this `` carrier of firewood '' . 
  i 'm really amazed right now by the idea that so many people believe that * this * is the perfect holy word of the eternal creator of the world . 
  he sends us a holy book , and one entire chapter of it is only a condemnation of abu lahab and his wife - without even telling us * why * they are so contemptible . 
  for all we know , this surah means that being rich and carrying firewood are two grave , unforgivable sins . 
   as for travel times sam and gilly would be on that boat until the series end . 
  can you show me some math on that ? 
  google claims that a galleon could sail at around eight knots . 
  the distance between lisbon and buenos aires is roughly 9500km or 5100 nautical miles . 
  according to [ this calculator ] ( http://www.sailingcourse.com/keelboat/speed_time_distance.htm ) , sailing that distance at a speed of only 5 knots would take a little more than 1,000 hours , or 43 days . 
  that does n't seem unreasonable . 
  the distance that sam and gilly have to sail might be twice as long , but their ship could also easily be twice as fast . 
  according to the wiki , '' [ they sail very well , but when becalmed , they are helpless . 
  ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/swan_ship ) '', 
  so how long does it take from the moment when that enemy machine gun started firing until the moment that the bombs are dropped ? 
  in your example , would the medevac simply get everybody out of there , or would they only get the injured soldier while the rest of you ... finish the patrol ? 
  inspect that former mg position ? 
  return to base on foot ? 
  huh ? 
  is there a significant number of chechens who live in these areas ? 
  i thought chechens lived almost exclusively in chechnya , and the only chechens in syria were fighters travelled to syria specifically to fight in this conflict . 
  nope , anybody can kill the good twin . 
  somebody who did n't read the prophecy will have came back and killt the good twin , thus will deprived us of the chance of having killed the evil one . 
  i hope you understand the tenses that i used in this comment . 
  no left turns in itself is n't a problem at all . 
  it 's well-known that [ ups tells their drivers to avoid left turns ] ( http://compass.ups.com/ups-driver-avoid-left-turns/ ) as much as possible . 
  i do n't know anything about dubai , so i believe your report of their messed-up city planning , but do n't blame the no-left-turns rule for long travel times - that rule actually makes sense for many cities .

  [ wiki article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gate_tower_building ), 
  i thought they were going for plausible `` claimability '' , i.e. 
  they want to be able to claim that they attacked israel . 
  without actually attacking israel , if possible , because that shit is dangerous . 
  damnit , you beat me by seconds . 
  i 've seen this gif used a few times , but i ca n't think of a more fitting context .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmccqxvbfym ), 
  i ca n't believe nobody has mentioned this yet . 
  it 's the most obvious example that i can imagine where a song and a game have basically become one . 
  it used to be called [ `` korobeiniki '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korobeiniki ) ( * peddlers * in russian ) and was a popular folk song from the nineteenth century , but since 1989 , it is and will forever be * the tetris song * . 
   what is even more interesting from a policy perspective is that the poverty trajectories of different regions from 1990-1998 have been so different . 
  over this period , the poverty rate in east asia drops from 27.5 percent to 15.3 percent and numbers in poverty fall from 452 to 278 million -- mainly because of the dramatic reductions in poverty in china . 
  these figures are startling -- the region is on course to achieving the millennium, 
  poverty reduction targets fifteen or so years ahead, 
  of schedule . 
  this reduction in poverty , which started well before 1990 , ** represents the largest fall in poverty ever, 
  witnessed in history ** ( ahuja et al. , 1997 ) . 
  in contrast ,, 
  poverty rates in sub-saharan africa have remained stagnant , moving from 47.6 percent in 1990 to 46.3, 
  percent in 1998 . 
  over this period around fifty million people are added to, 
  the african poverty tally . 
  we therefore have an, 
  african tragedy to contrast with the ** east asian miracle ** .

  i do n't think the gif adds any value over a simple screenshot in this case . 
  that being said , this gif would n't add any value under different circumstances either , so it might still be technically retired . 
  we 'll have to wait for someone else who can explain the actual rule , but i can already tell you this :, 
  the example sentence is correct , but you could also say, 
  ( it 's sounds rather convoluted and i do n't think anyone would actually say it like this , but it 's grammatically correct . ), 
  i think * w\u00e4hrend * does n't require the genitive if it 's connected to a verb . 
  this is so cool . 
  it means that your brain has the ability to process visual information in 3d , even though that ability has * never been used before * , at least not to this extent . 
  i would have guessed that the responsible brain areas would simply be rewired if they never receive 3d visual input . 
  i wonder if neurological research on this exists . 
  ( any experts around , maybe ? ), 
  why ? 
  since they kept not-shooting the colossi , they were n't actually * doing * much . 
  killing the m&m s seems like the right choice .

  maybe i would classify ( some of ) their terrorists acts as war crimes instead , because they otherwise are a pretty regular military organization . 
  if my opinion mattered , i think i 'd wiggle my way out of this by pretending that there is a separate `` military wing '' of hezbollah that is responsible for all terrorist acts , while the rest of the organization is not . 
  in reality , i do n't think such a split exists .
