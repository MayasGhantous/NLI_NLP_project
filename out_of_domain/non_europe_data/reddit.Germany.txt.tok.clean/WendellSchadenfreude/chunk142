  four years old , in response to the question [ `` have you ever picked up a hitchhiker '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/elal2/have_you_ever_picked_up_a_hitchhiker/c18z0z2 ) ? 
  nope . 
  one of them serves old capulet , the other one montague . 
  the capulet-servant says that his master is as good as montague . 
  the montague-servant answers `` no better '' , saying that capulet certainly is n't * better * than montague . 
  this is relatively civil , but still somewhat provocative . 
  it makes sense , because they all are trying to get the other guys to either strike first or become so insulting that * they * are allowed to strike first . 
  i like the [ `` no fear shakespeare '' version on sparknotes . 
  edit : this `` no '' is n't the opposite of `` yes '' , it 's rather like the opposite of `` any '' . 
  - `` he certainly is n't any * better * ! '', 
  dumb gorillas . 
  that does n't work , since they build a new nest every night - the nest in the background always proves that this is a new picture . 
  [ [ the wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nest-building_in_primates#in_gorillas ) only mentions that they build nests , [ this article also explains ] ( http://home.worldcom.ch/negenter/081nestbapes_e.html ) that they build a new one every night . ], 
  no , problem . 
  from the wikipedia article about [ slavery and the catholic church . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_church_and_slavery ), 
   however when the age of discovery greatly increased the number of slaves owned by christians , the response of the church , under strong political pressures , was confused and ineffective in preventing the establishment of slave societies in the colonies of catholic countries . 
  papal bulls such as dum diversas , romanus pontifex and their derivatives , ** sanctioned slavery and were used to justify enslavement of natives and the appropriation of their lands during this era . 
   ** a number of popes did issue papal bulls condemning `` unjust '' enslavement ** ( `` just '' enslavement was still accepted ) , and mistreatment of native americans by spanish and portuguese colonials ; however , these were largely ignored . 
  nonetheless , catholic missionaries such as the jesuits , who also owned slaves , worked to alleviate the suffering of native american slaves in the new world . 
  debate about the morality of slavery continued throughout this period , with some books critical of slavery being placed on the index of forbidden books by the holy office between 1573-1826 . 
  ** capuchin missionaries were excommunicated for calling for the emancipation of black slaves in the americas . 
  ** on 22 december 1741 , benedict xiv promulgated the papal bull `` immensa pastorum principis '' against the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the americas and other countries . 
   in spite of a stronger condemnation of unjust types of slavery by pope gregory xvi in his bull in supremo apostolatus issued in 1839 , some american bishops continued to support slave-holding interests until the abolition of slavery . 
  ** in 1866 the holy office of pope pius ix affirmed that , subject to conditions , it was not against divine law for a slave to be sold , bought or exchanged . 
  no idea what this should mean for game mechanics . 
  maybe the church could either condemn slavery ( giving e.g. 
  some extra unrest ) or justify it ( for some kind of bonus ) . 
  i assume these are the steps you want to take as a nahuatl nation , and step 4 is - sacrifice the rulers and heirs of portugal and the papal state . 
  * obligatory, 
  he is a year younger , but ascended to the throne at a younger age and is thus the longest ruling monarch in the world . 
  not really . 
  he was old and sick . 
  everybody had been speculating about his death for years . 
   for the day that the krg claims mosul for themselves . 
  do n't think this will happen . 
  the kurds already announced that their troops would no participate in the liberation of mosul so as to prevent kurdish-arab clashes in the future . 
  i believe they may have some sort of an agreement that they get to keep kirkuk but stay out of mosul . 
   they have , however , asked for food , toys , and other animals . 
  you ca n't really tell if that is asking a question at all - `` can i have my food ? '', 
  is just another way of saying `` give me my food ! '', 
  what is n't the point who was trying to make ? 
  my point is that a monkey asking why his food is n't there around the time that he usually is fed * is n't * ( necessarily ) really a monkey asking a question - it can just as well be interpreted as a monkey saying `` i 'm hungry , give me my food ! '', 
  only with questions for information can we be certain that the entity asking the question * is * in fact asking a question , rather than making a demand or a statement . 
  for those who 've never seen it :, 
  [ video of an american soldier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgelmcods38 ) who was kept as a pow in north vietnam . 
  while answering questions for a propaganda interview , he blinked the word `` t-o-r-t-u-r-e '' in morse code . 
  [ wiki article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeremiah_denton ), 
  this is much worse than just `` not a confession '' , this is a poorly disguised popular opinion puffin . 
  this made me chuckle . 
  then it made me sad . 
  asking a real question shows that you comprehend that some other person can have information that is unavailable to you . 
  it shows that you realize that such information can * exist * in the first place . 
  asking `` where is my food ? '', 
  can be a non-question if it 's really just a polite way of saying `` give me my food !, 
  '' , but it is clearly a question if you ask `` where , that is : under which of these ten buckets , is my food ? '', 
  as far as i know , a monkey will get the hint if a human points to one of several buckets and will check that one for food first , but ( if this wikipedia article is to be trusted ) he will never come up with the idea of asking . 
  edit : you are right , of course , that every question can be rephrase as a demand or a statement ( `` i want to know the meaning of life ! '' ) . 
  but because of that , i believe that the wikipedia article uses `` question '' in this context specifically as `` request for information '' . 
  i love it . 
  since i read that theon i chapter from twow , stannis signing the contract in blood always bothered me . 
  it seemed like such a random thing to happen , listlessly included in a scene where it did n't make much sense . 
  it so cool if this was actually necessary to fulfill an old prophecy . 
   read this : https://twitter.com/ver_scholl_en/status/558279326333153281, 
  so that others do n't have to read it in this annoying format :, 
  ndf & `` regime '' stances i think differ in hasakah . 
  ndf is drawn from local arab tribes , many of whom have internalised a particularly virulent kurdophobia -- vast majority of clashes are started/provoked by them . 
  many of these tribes also have components fighting alongside is , and there have even been ndf units that defected to is ( e.g. 
  during attack on hsk by is last summer ) . 
  for these guys , does n't really matter who they 're fighting for -- so long as it 's against kurds . 
  though is ' religious programme may be slightly more resonant than stale ba'ath , syrian government has shinier toys and likely more funds at its disposal . 
  regime proper otoh would prefer that clashes with ypg be kept to a minimum , as it 's an awkward pr spin ( bc minority status of kurds , rising global sympathy , & also undermines ` certain ' narrative that ypg is a puppet/ally of assad ) . 
  it does staunchly oppose self-rule , but prefers to counter it with soft power ( e.g. 
  quietly tapping religious/political figures to speak out against it & competing for affiliations among christians & arabs in jazira ) . 
  ypg generally prefers the same , ( rightly ) seeing is as the primary military threat for the short - to mid-term . 
  but i think both regime & ypg believe that there will be a showdown someday . 
  who even says that , really ? 
  if i had to argue that position , here goes :, 
  the saa wants to fight a `` fair war '' . 
  they would love nothing more than to meet out in the open , no civilians around , and duke it out . 
  the war could be resolved in an afternoon , everybody ( who 's still alive ) is home for dinner , no civilian casualties . 
  but the rebels know that they would lose such a war . 
  so instead , they decided to fight a `` dirty war '' , hiding in cities and towns , even in residential areas where they * know * that civilians are around . 
  they are the ones who brought the war to the cities , they are the ones effectively holding civilians hostage and using them as human shields . 
  with the barrel bombs , the saa is trying to force civilians to leave all combat areas . 
  that 's not a nice thing to do and causes high civilian casualties , but the blame for those lies with the people who brought the war to the cities instead of fighting it out in the open . 
  [ yes , that was reported everywhere . 
  ] ( http://kurdishdailynews.org/2015/01/21/ypg-hospital-area-liberated-in-kobane/ ), 
  i guess this grey color is just a very weird choice a the mapmaker to highlight important buildings . 
  although i have n't seen any reports that explicitly say that the ypg liberated the cultural center or the security box . 
  the city is ; the governorate is * mostly * , but not entirely . 
  [ is that so ? 
  ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/files/2014/12/g4034x-monday-datawatch1.png ), 
  the word can mean different things . 
  germans ( or austrians ) who say `` socialism '' tend to mean `` communism + democracy '' - which is not what we have in germany , nor in scandinavia . 
  but that 's not the only acceptable definition of the word . 
  the french `` parti socialiste '' is what would be called `` sozialdemokratisch '' ( social-democratic ) in german , but they clearly call themselves socialists . 
  in that sense , scandinavia is absolutely socialist , and so is ( more or less ) most of europe . 
  germany does n't suffer from too many immigrants * with college degrees * . 
  what about it ?
