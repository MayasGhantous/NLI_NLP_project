   the chief peshmerga staff jamal muhammad told radio free iraq that the kurdish forces have no plan to enter into mosul and liberate the city . 
  coldkurd :, 
   #kobane liberated since last night , i do not know why this delay in announcing it officially !, 
   in contrast to the aesthetics of the time, 
  do you mean the * ascetics * ? 
  did you delete your comment ? 
  because i can see it in your history , but when i go there , it says `` nothing seems to be here '' . 
   `` what the state of israel is doing to the palestinians today is essentially the same thing as what the nazis did to the, 
  jews in the third reich . '', 
  if you agree with that statement , you are probably anti-semitic , and you certainly are an idiot . 
  do they lay eggs and produce milk as well ? 
  a german expression for something that is extremely versatile and useful translates to egg-laying wool-milk-sow ( * eierlegende wollmilchsau * ) . 
  cool graffiti . 
  in case you do n't know who the girl in that picture is : [ runak bapir gherib ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2dxtsr/yezidi_girl_carries_an_assault_rifle_to_protect/ ) , 14 years old , fleeing from the mount sinjar area . 
  nope . 
  that link leads to a comment `` kittens are lethal if accidentally inhaled . '', 
  by a user named cunt-hooks . 
  none of the replies are from you . 
  nope - just that one comment . 
  i can see your other askreddit comments just fine . 
  gas reserves . 
  ( what do you mean , `` besides oil '' ? 
  - as if the oil were n't enough already ! ), 
  anyhow : dez is a large city , which makes it important all by itself . 
  it 's a provincial capital . 
  controls the euphrates river + valley , thus cutting isis lines from raqqa to abukamal + iraq . 
  defending urban areas is * much * easier than retreating and re-conquering those areas later on . 
   probably cause i would label it a `` tonkrug '' , so a tankard made out of clay instead of stone . 
  that would just be confusing , [ * tonkr\u00fcge * ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=tonkrug&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=887&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=i13hvn-xlmkruahog-gd&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) are something else entirely . 
  the material of a * steinkrug * is based on clay , but it 's should more properly be called [ * steingut * ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/steingut ) or [ * steinzeug * ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/steinzeug ) . 
  to live happily in this world ,, 
  drink your beer and be quiet . 
  the words are spelled weird . 
  e.g. , i ca n't imagine any german writing * erden * as `` eyden '' . 
  no idea what 's up with that . 
  unions work fairly well in germany . 
  and i say that as a german who quite reliably gets a headache when the german unions start talking . 
  it 's not easy for all kinds of companies to pack up and move to china . 
  so i 'm not getting any work done today ... ? 
  that 's not what he said , though . 
  turn it around : i want the saa to liberate raqqa at some point . 
  but if there were a danger of isis building nukes , i 'd rather see someone ( anyone ) bomb raqqa to ashes than letting them succeed . 
  which they do n't really need at the moment . 
  diplomatic leverage wo n't do them any good against isis , jan , or ahrar - conventional weapons will . 
  realistically , there 's only one enemy that is threatening an invasion and might be deterred if syria possessed nuclear weapons - no , not israel : turkey . 
  ca n't have been much . 
  their armor , artillery , and all heavy equipment was destroyed by the airstrikes , that 's why the kurds managed to take kobane back in the first place . 
   the attempt at taking kobane was mostly a bid to secure a safe passage for goods and people from turkey . 
  they already have a safe passage from turkey , for instance at the tall abyad border crossing , right north of raqqa . 
  the border crossing was still important - not for isis ; but for the kurds . 
  had they lost it , they would never have been able to take back kobane or anything in the canton . 
  with continued control over the border crossing , they may be able to take back all of it . 
  oktober 2014 ), 
  just imagine : * you * might be the first carrier of the mutation that gives people purple hair . 
  only it 's recessive , so it 's not expressed in you . 
  but four or five generations from now , when you great-grand-son happens to unknowingly marry your great-great-grand-daughter ( * not * his daughter or niece , more like his third cousin once removed ) , they will have some purple-haired children . 
   i wonder what kind of cool mutations would pop up if everyone started interbreeding . 
  this just goes to show that * most * random mutations are n't beneficial - we mostly refer to them as birth defects or ... - syndromes . 
  if you shag your sister , any children of yours will be as closely related to your parents as your siblings are , not accounting for rare random mutations . 
  to you , they will also be closer related genetically than normal children would be - they would be half-way between your children and your identical twins . 
   what if my sister is my twin ? 
  since your sister ca n't be your * identical * twin , her being your ( fraternal ) twin would n't make her any different from your other siblings . 
  you 're now just describing the same scenario as above , just from your parents ' perspective . 
   - if you have a boy and a girl , and they have a boy and a girl together , and * they * have a boy and a girl together , ... , your descendants will * on average * ( * ) forever be as closely related to you as your direct children were . 
  also , many of them will die from expressing all the harmful recessive mutations that you 're carrying around with you . 
  ( * ) the average is an interesting point . 
  your children all share exactly 50 % of your dna ( on top of the 99 % + that all humans share anyway , of course ) , the other 50 % come from your spouse . 
  but in your incestually conceived grandchildren , it 's only 50 % on average - some of them may by random chance be genetically more similar to you and less to your spouse , some of them the other way round . 
  how old are you ? 
  do you know any foreign language already ? 
  - if you do n't then learning at least one will have additional value . 
  do you plan to live in germany for a while at some point ? 
  if you do n't , then i think i 'd go with one of the other subjects . 
  learning additional languages is always good , but not quite as important for personal development as learning a first foreign language . 
  ultimately , you 'll have to decide this for yourself anyway . 
  does it seem possible that you may study a natural science at university ? 
  then go with chemistry by all means - it will be useful for a future biologist or physicist as well . 
  might want to study history ? 
  - philosophy it is !, 
  sports is cool , too , but i think this is the subject that is most easily `` replaced '' by joining a club . 
  i do n't think so . 
  they ca n't start a big charge in this area like the one they used to originally conquer it - they lost too much of their heavy equipment to the airstrikes for that . 
  i belong to a clear minority : my first contact with westeros was the board game . 
  played it with a few friends , decided to check out the background world , ordered agot . 
  two weeks later , ordered acok and asos . 
  two months later , started impatiently waiting for affc to finally come out . 
  i like these comparison pictures , but i feel they would be more convincing if they actually showed the same guy in the same suit , before and after visiting a tailor . 
  being a * big * country helps a lot . 
  as a german , i pay attention to the stuff happening in france , greece , or sweden . 
  i do n't hear too much news about chile , thailand , or madagascar either . 
  same guy , but different posture , different distance to camera , different lighting ( as you say ) - taking all this into account , this picture barely tells me anything about wether it 's important to take a suit to a tailor . 
   decimated would mean 10 % of them has died . 
  if you were an ancient roman . 
  for modern people , `` decimate '' means `` kill , destroy , or remove a large proportion of . '', 
  interesting ... 
   in islamic eschatology as found in the hadith , the area of dabiq is mentioned as a place of some of the events of the muslim malahim ( which would equate to the christian apocalypse , or armageddon ) . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] abu hurayrah , companion to the prophet , reported in his hadith that god 's messenger , the prophet said :, 
   `` the last hour ( of history ) would not come until the romans land at ( either ) al-a 'm aq or in dabiq ( two places along the current syria / turkey border ) . 
  an army consisting of the best ( soldiers ) of the people ( the muslims ) of the earth at that time will come from medina ( to counteract them ) . '', 
   for this reason the name dabiq was chosen for propaganda purposes as the title of the official online magazine of the islamic state ( is ) .
