  if you 're beginning to doubt that only now , you ca n't have been paying attention to `` the kurdish question '' for long . 
  an independent kurdistan * might * have stable relations with iran . 
  in the eyes of arabs and turks , the kurds will always be trying to steal `` their '' land , no matter how much they restrain themselves to majority kurdish areas . 
  i would have guessed that mosul will be taken mostly by the regular army , without much help from shi'a militias . 
  is the choice that they have joining nusra or death ? 
  this is not a permanent , fortified supply route . 
  he just wants to show that dez is n't cut off from supply or reinforcements . 
  if the government wants to send anything there , they just send a convoy and roll through the desert - there 's nothing there to stop them . 
  isis still controls the villages along the road , but going around them is n't difficult . 
  with total air superiority , i imagine it is n't all that dangerous either . 
  it 's from the simpsons . 
  two aliens take over america by disguising themselves as the democrat and republican presidential candidates . 
   george stephanopoulos : [ * to kodos , who has taken on the form of bill clinton * ] uh , mr. president , sir , people are becoming a bit ... confused by the way your and your opponent are , well , constantly holding hands . 
   kang : [ * disguised as bob dole * ] we are merely exchanging long protein strings . 
  if you can think of a simpler way , i 'd like to hear it . 
  i find it hard to believe that that really was an svbied . 
  when a car laden with explosives is detonated , do the remnants really still look much like a car ? 
  so much that they are worth saving , instead of simply using any * other * car ?

  this is a [ rather famous pun ] ( http://bestuff.com/stuff/super-calloused-fragile-mystic-hexed-by-halitosis ) , usually made about gandhi . 
   mahatma gandhi , as you know , walked barefoot most of the time , which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet . 
  he also ate very little , which made him rather frail and , with his odd diet , he suffered from bad breath . 
  this made him [ ... ] a super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis . 
  much better with `` hexed '' instead of `` plagued '' .

  there * are * genetic disorders such as [ the klinefelter ( or xxy ) syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klinefelter_syndrome ) that result in people who could be characterized as not truely male nor female .

  you 're the guy who wrote the comment about ( saudi ) king abdullah two weeks ago . 
  if you plan on writing more comments like these in the future ( and i hope you do ) , you might want to start using some kind of catch phrase for extra karma .

  you ca n't be friends with someone who does n't want to be friends with you . 
  wether your feelings are `` wrong '' does n't matter - you ca n't be friends with her if she does n't want it . 
  a truce including irbeen would be big . 
  [ it 's not so much a city in east ghouta as a very urban part of damascus ] ( http://wikimapia.org/23325529/irbeen ) - basically the only part of damascus that the opposition still controls , except jobar . 
  jobar itself would be completely cut off from the world without irbeen , no matter how many tunnels they have . 
  alas , the article is very confusing at this point . 
  it does n't seem like any opposition factions actually want to talk about a peace deal , they are just accusing each other of wanting just that . 
  difficult . 
  i feel you 're both in the wrong here , but you more than her . 
  no matter what else happened , you ca n't start calling her in-laws names on your sister 's facebook page ( or at all ) . 
  i agree that his comment about you being adopted was rude , but at least it was somewhat tongue-in-cheek . 
  in any case - if he 's in the wrong , it 's best to * let him be * in the wrong , not to insult him back . 
  ultimately , you probably value your relationship with your sister higher than the feeling of being right or wrong . 
  for that reason alone , you might want to apologize to her - it does n't prove you were wrong , it only proves you want to move on more than you want to be right . 
  i know this is much easier said than done ; i hate having to apologize . 
  but importantly : if you do it , be sincere about it . 
  you can also tell her that you expect her to stand up for you when her in-laws are rude to you . 
  also , obviously : do n't take bait posts on facebook in the future . 
  if you have to , post some mother jones or hupo stuff * on your own page * instead . 
   were against things like parlamentarism , basic rights , the then-current constitution, 
  the communists also were against parliamentarianism , basic rights , and the weimar constitution . 
  describing hitler as a communist would still be wrong . 
  if you ever read the words of the horst-wessel-lied , you know that hitler and his friends certainly did n't think of themselves as reactionaries . 
  the hitler movement wanted to be ( and was ) something new and revolutionary , something unlike everything that had existed prior - reactionaries never want that . 
  she probably did n't mean she loved it , only that she 'd gotten used to it . 
   it would bankrupt them . 
  * that * might be the least problem . 
  the us has been searching for a local infantery for a long time . 
  but so far , the `` moderate '' rebels that they supported have for the most part turned out to be useless at best , and the kurds were effective , but are unwilling ( and probably unable ) to move out of their own areas . 
  now , i do n't think that jordan will send soldiers either . 
  but if they did , they could probably get the us ( or us allies ) to pay for the entire operation . 
  our normal numbers are `` base 10 '' . 
  that means we have ten different symbols for numbers ( 0-9 ) , and 10 is the first number for which there is no symbol - we simply move the `` 1 '' one place to the left . 
  you can also decide to simply use a different base , e.g. 
  base 12 . 
  to do that , you need to invent two new symbols for `` ten '' and `` eleven '' . 
  for instance , we could use \u00a7 for `` ten '' and $ for `` eleven '' . 
  so then the numbers would look like this :, 
  8 ( eight ), 
  9 ( nine ), 
  \u00a7 ( ten ), 
  $ ( eleven ), 
  10 ( twelve ), 
  11 ( thirteen ), 
  12 ( fourteen ), 
  \u00a7 and $ * can * be used , but the most commonly used symbols by far are a for ten and b for eleven . 
  when using a higher base number , you need more symbols , so you can simply add the entire alphabet - c is twelve , d is thirteen , ... , x is thirtythree , y is thirtyfour , z is thirtyfive .
