  thirtysix , of course , would simply be written as `` 10 '' , because the `` 1 '' counts as thirtysix when you move it one place to the left . 
  ( `` 100 '' would be onethousand-twohundred-ninetysix , because thats thirtysix times thirtysix . ), 
  when you use the letters of the alphabet like that , this fraction just happens to spell out `` makeitstop '' again and again . 
  that could be straight out of / r/sixthworldproblems . 
  edit : i 'll just repost it there , let 's see how it fares ... 
  brigading usually means that you get multiple users ( a `` brigade '' ) to up - or ( more commonly ) downvote certain posts . 
  for instance , if a user in / r/chocolateicecream linked to posts in other subreddits in favor of vanilla ice cream just so that his chocolate buddies could all downvote that content , that would be brigading . 
  in this case , they probably simply mean that he personally had several accounts and used them to downvote other people 's posts or upvote his own . 
  [ upvote your post , log out , log in as sunbolts2 , upvote , log out , log in as sunbolts3 , ... - hint : you 'll get banned quickly . ], 
  i do n't think it does . 
  it does say that allah will burn those who disobey him , i.e. 
  send them to hell . 
  i do n't see where it says that muslims should burn people in this world . 
  examples :, 
   and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresses his limits - he will put him into the fire to abide eternally therein , and he will have a humiliating punishment . 
   and whoever does that in aggression and injustice - then we will drive him into a fire . 
  and that , for allah , is [ always ] easy . 
   that 's 48 million doses of mmr . 
  which means the statistical chance of dying from receiving mmr is 0.00000225 % . 
  108 deaths from 48 million doses would be a chance of 0.000225 % , you 're off by a factor of 100 . 
  on the other hand , you also assumed a very low fatality rate . 
  quoting wiki :, 
   between 1987 and 2000 , the case fatality rate across the united states was three measles-attributable deaths per 1000 cases , or 0.3 % . 
  300 times of what you chose . 
  so your argument still works . 
  that 's * exactly * the same verse i already quoted ( 14 ) , only `` my '' translation makes it clearer that this is something * allah * will do to the unbelievers . 
   and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresses his limits - he will put him into the fire to abide eternally therein , and he will have a humiliating punishment . 
  it does n't mean that muslims are supposed to burn anyone , it means that you and i are going to hell if the muslims are right . 
  which we already knew and are n't too worried about . 
  rephrasing the title to be more accurate and less click-baity : `` canadian student can make herself feel weird . '', 
  cool , very interesting . 
  true , i do n't even speak arabic . 
  but if you look at that entire surah , you can see a clear pattern : some rules are given , and then allah threatens those who do n't obey his commands with hellfire . 
  taking `` your '' translation :, 
  those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans , eat up a fire into their own bodies : they will soon be enduring a blazing fire !, 
  if any do that in rancour and injustice , - soon shall we cast them into the fire : and easy it is for allah . 
  some of them believed , and some of them averted their faces from him : and enough is hell for a burning fire . 
  those who reject our signs , we shall soon cast into the fire : as often as their skins are roasted through , we shall change them for fresh skins , that they may taste the penalty : for allah is exalted in power , wise . 
  the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire : no helper wilt thou find for them ; -, 
  obviously , * those * verses all are about things that allah will do , not things that muslims should do . 
  ( muslims ca n't eternally give people new skin and roast them again ... ), 
  so unless you can provide a reason for me to believe that this one verse is instead an instruction to muslims , i think it 's much more likely that this is * also * a describtion of what allah will do . 
  that 's nice to hear , but you might also want to provide clear evidence for this claim . 
  likely not . 
  if you read the snopes article , it explains a little about the vaccine adverse event reporting system ( vaers ) . 
  basically , when a child gets a vaccine and gets sick within the next few days , a report to that system might be filed - it does n't matter wether the sickness and the vaccine have anything to do with each other , because you ca n't even * know * if they do yet . 
  with millions of kids getting the mmr shot every year , we can expect * thousands * of them to get sick within a few days after the shot - not because of the vaccine , but simply because kids get sick all the time , and a few thousand out of a million would not be a surprising number . 
  when some of these children die ( e.g. 
  108 out of some 20 million + ) , they will be counted by the vaers as exactly what they are : children that died soon after receiving an mmr shot . 
  that does n't mean the vaccine caused their death . 
  it means that * if * a vaccine actually was harmful , we would notice quickly , because then the numbers from the vaers would be much higher for that vaccine . 
  as a fellow non-believer , i can tell you that this `` we '' very clearly is a royal we , refering to allah . 
  what else could it possibly be , in a sentence like this ? 
   as often as their skins are roasted through , we shall change them for fresh skins, 
  i have not watched the video . 
  still , i do n't believe this guy . 
  cgi ( even bad cgi ) is expensive , and it 's expensive because you need dozens or hundreds of skilled artist to use it . 
  to create several minutes of cgi flames in the short time since the pilot had been captured , isis would need to have hundreds of artists and designers who are better than anything hollywood has to offer . 
   him screaming bloody murder on the is would make the whole shot unusable . 
  that 's why they fed him opiates . 
   i used the known statistical likelihood from all measles cases ever , and it is 0.001 % . 
  that would be one in 100,000 . 
  ( see below . ), 
  also , there 's no way this is true . 
  why would the fatality rate in a modern , rich society such as the us in the 1990 's have been 300 times as high as the `` standard '' rate ? 
   cause i just put 108 / 48000000 and it still came back as 0.0000025 ? 
  exactly . 
  if 100 people infected with measles * all * died , that would mean a fatality rate of 100/100 = 1 , or 100 % . 
  if only 10 died , it would be 10/100 = 0.1 , or 10 % . 
  to get to percent , you need to multiply that 0 . x by 100 . 
  editing a video to get cool crossfades and stuff is something completely different than creating realistic fire . 
  along the mississippi , you 'd expect the state borders to be defined by the river . 
  and you 'd be right , mostly . 
  the problem is that the state borders were defined by the path of the river * at the time of the founding of the states * - but the river has shifted its path in several places since then . 
  because of that , the state borders differ from the current river bed in several places , the [ kentucky bend ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kentucky_bend ) is just the most famous . 
  you are being needlessly rude . 
   people who have been starved are n't going to hurt themselves by eating too much unless they literally rupture their stomach . 
  refeeding syndrome is the only thing you have to worry about, 
  so there * is * something that you have to worry about , and it can be fatal . 
  [ refeeding syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refeeding_syndrome ) , according to wikipedia , can lead to death from cardiac arrhythmia , not from ruptured stomaches . 
  i also doubt that you 'd still need close medical supervision after a week or two of normal nutrition , but it certainly would take much longer until you look like a healthy person again . 
  * cue, 
  no , you idiot . 
  the thing i always like to tell foreigners staying in germany for a while : do n't do filesharing in germany ( unless you * really * know what you 're doing ) . 
  it can easily get you into trouble . 
  streaming stuff is fine . 
  filesharing is not . 
  as a bit of an anti-theist myself : fuck that guy . 
  also , here 's the reaction of [ richard dawkins , one of the world 's most famous atheists/anti-theists , ] ( https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/565439089038852097 ) on twitter :, 
   how could any decent person not condemn the vile murder of three young us muslims in chapel hill ? 
   am i crazy even considering traveling internationally ( which i have never done before ) by myself and a kid ? 
  i do n't even understand that question . 
  why would you be crazy for that ? 
  it sounds like an awesome plan . 
  just in case : get your son a belly bag or something , put your phone number and the adress of your hotel/hostel / ... in there . 
  have fun in germany !,
