  sound travels some 300 meters per second . 
  let 's therefore call the distance of 300 meters `` one sound-second '' . 
  if you know that i am standing on a hill that is 900 meters away , and you can hear me yell something , you know that i must actually have yelled not just right now , but 3 seconds ago , because there is a distance of 3 sound-seconds between the two of us . 
  it 's like the counting we do to find out how far away a thunderstorm is by measuring the time between thunder and lightning . 
  if i were you , i would n't bother with another reply . 
  you 've made your point , and you 've been very convincing . 
  never heard the word before . 
  if i saw it on a shirt , i would think the wearer is at best a rebellious , misguided teenager , but more likely some esoterical nazi nutjob . 
  i 'd strongly recommend against getting such a shirt . 
  the problem might be your translation : `` spirit of the people '' sounds somewhat nice enough . 
  but to understand what the word * feels * like in german , i 'd translate it as `` spirit of the race '' instead . 
  if you use `` gemeinsinn '' , i would still think it 's a strange word to put on a t-shirt , but it would n't sound right-wingy or nationalistic to me . 
  it 's also nice because it has a trifold meaning . 
  ( roughly : the `` inner sense '' that combines all other senses ; common sense ; and something like public spirit or community spirit ), 
  other ideas :, 
  * zusammen * ( together ), 
  * eintracht * ( unity - also the name of some soccer teams ), 
  not officially , but it 's still commonly used as a polite address . 
  this is also done with other offices , such as speaker ( of the house ) , senator , secretary ( of state ) , ... 
  according to other mapmakers a few days ago , the regime lost a lot of ground north of the city . 
  around al-mallah and handarat . 
  i do n't know who 's right , but this looks like a map the regime would be rather happy with . 
  i ca n't read arabic , but i * think * its not quite that bad . 
  the dots represent vowels , i believe , so without them , you might get a message like this :, 
  shuld wu lunch thu nuculur mussuls ? 
  it sounds silly when you use the wrong vowels , but its still somewhat intelligable . 
  it 's dativ . 
  ( and plural . ), 
  can germany have some lebensraum , please ? 
  or , you know , it 's own flair at least ? 
  we do n't even know how big that box of wine was - they are often bigger than one liter , can be 4 liters . 
  getting blackout drunk from 1.5-2 liters ( 0.4-0 .5 gallons ) of wine sounds about right . 
  at least , it sounds far more likely than her boyfriend drugging her and having her raped instead of simply breaking up with her . 
  still a great investment , 100 % profit . 
  your brother is a financial genius . 
   you do seem to have mentally stitched together a theory that suits yourself . 
  says the person who came up with `` maybe you were n't just raped , but your boyfriend drugged you because he * wanted * you to get raped '' . 
  well , thanks . 
  but this is still a textbook humblebrag . 
  i do n't really understand - are we supposed to be outraged at the sight of this picture ? 
  personally , i wish israel would bomb al quaeda instead of saa/hizbollah . 
  but still , there 's no reason why the soldiers guarding a border post should n't talk with each other . 
  `` racism '' is sometimes used as the catch-all term for all kinds of group-based discrimination . 
   [ some definitions of racism also include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural , national , ethnic , caste , or religious stereotypes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism ), 
  this map uses six different colors for land areas , plus another one for the ocean ( and black for borders ) . 
  every time you meassure the difference between two temperatures given in a relative scale in percent , a scientist somewhere gets a cold . 
  you could use a temperature scale that defines these two temperatures as 1 \u00b0 and 2 \u00b0 - now it 's a difference of 100 % !, 
  but yeah , you 're right : + / -1 \u00b0 f seems pretty narrow to me , too . 
  this professor is a disgustingly racist , sexist piece of garbage . 
  this should n't just be the top post , it should be the one and only post in this thread . 
  nice reminder of the old rule : when a newspaper title asks if something happened , the answer is `` no '' . 
  [ johnny cash tells me it was 180 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-0lgilzj48 ) , so that 's what i choose to believe . 
  very cool map . 
   carrying a fucking deadly slingshot ? 
  this might be the fact you learn at an embarrassingly late age : david , according to the bible , was n't using a slingshot . 
  he was using [ a sling - sounds similar , but is something quite different . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sling_%28weapon%29 ), 
  if you look close enough , there is !, 
  only it 's been rotated 180 degrees and is now called a `` u '' . 
  ( it 's rotated via hand crank . 
  spins super easy and fast . ), 
  but what 's more significant than a * sign * ? 
  you already fixed it . 
  ( that sounds like something you would know , actually . ), 
  except for the alphabet still missing the letter g - germany now exists , but can be found under f. 
  i think i 'll stick with uganda for a few more days . 
  i 've grown used to it , and at least it saved me the embarassement of having to use a belgian flag . 
  i 'm almost certain that sentence shuld end with : '' ... and let the states decide the legality of abortion . '', 
  i 'm not a huge fan of that , but it does n't sound like a horrible idea either . 
  either way , it 's not relevant to this thread at all . 
   and this is why rand paul will never be president . 
  oh , there are other reasons for that . 
  of course it would cause a lot of trouble for the us if the president decided to `` give the kurds kurdistan '' , but i 'm sure neither the nominations nor the election will be decided by foreign affairs . 
   `` are you done yet ? '', 
  i would never dare ask that , because the obvious cruel response is : `` no , are you in yet ? '', 
   i wonder if it has anything to do with the close proximity people live in . 
  this is the pakistani-chinese border region , aka the western himalaya . 
  these two guys might be the only people in a hundred-mile radius . 
  for anyone wondering , `` butte '' is not pronounced like butter . 
  the - u - is pronounced like the one in university , the - e is silent . 
  thanks a lot , france !, 
  then arrange for the two kids to get married , legitimize them and treat their offspring as a cadet branch of your own dynasty . 
  if you live in any western country and * are n't * on some watchlist , our secret services really are n't doing their job . 
  - good to have you here . 
  nice . 
  this is the first blue/red penguin that i 've seen in a long time that * actually * was a blue/red penguin . 
  very well done , op !, 
  also , since we 're checking the math : where did the 155,000,000 gallons per day come from in the first place ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keystone_pipeline#keystone_pipeline ) claims a maximum discharge of 590,000 barrels per day for the keystone pipeline , 700,000 for keystone xl . 
  ( it says `` mbbl '' ; but confusingly [ the m stands for `` mille '' ( latin for 1,000 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barrel_%28unit%29#definitions_and_units ) , not for 1,000,000 ( or `` mega '' ) as usual . ), 
  one barrel of oil is 42 gallons , so even keystone xl will only transport 29,400,000 , or roughly 19 % of the number op used . 
  nsfw rating : wo n't get you fired . 
  woman in lingerie lying in the background . 
  edit : huh , why the downvotes ? 
  i 'm trying to be helpful . 
  nsfw can range from the use of crude language to close-up pictures of genitalia . 
  seeing nsfw ( in usually sfw subreddits ) on the frontpage always intrigues me , so i 'm telling other people what to expect . 
  if browsing adviceanimals wo n't get you fired , this picture wo n't get you fired either .
