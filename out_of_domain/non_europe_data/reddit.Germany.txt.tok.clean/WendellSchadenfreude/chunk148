  since you know how to spell `` lewis '' , who do you think the expedition was named after ? 
  who is the louis ? 
   please , just let art rest in peace . 
  people have * never * done that , since the beginning of art . 
  either way , night or the prussians will come soon . 
  sweden is the world 's [ 11th largest arms exporter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_industry#world.27s_largest_arms_exporters ) . 
  still impressive for a relatively small country , but any dictator who buys weapons in sweden also buys some in china , italy , germany , and some other places . 
  the biggest problem with most dictators is not the artillery and submarines they buy in sweden . 
  if he had a problem with that , i think he 'd have a bigger problem with her embracing him like that . 
  i think it clearly does n't . 
  it 's not even the right kind of bird , for duck 's sake !, 
  you 're right . 
  trieste was [ annexed by italy after ww1 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trieste#world_war_i.2c_annexation_to_italy_and_the_fascist_era ) the austrians had briefly lost it before during napoleon 's time , but took it back when napoleon was defeated . 
  i guess this is some joke i 'm not getting . 
  the g36 is the bundeswehr 's standard weapon . 
   similar tactics used by allied forces should be condoned as well . 
  i think you mean * condemn * , not * condone * . 
  the indiscriminate bombing of german cities was a war crime , of course . 
  i 'm surprised many people seem to have a problem with this statement , i would n't even have expected it to be controversial . 
  to be fair , a lot of the damage could hardly have been avoided with wwii technology . 
  bridges and train stations are legitimate targets , and they tend to be in cities . 
  all anti-aircraft defenses in a city are targets as well , of course . 
  if you want to hit those with unguided bombs without accepting unnecessary risks for your own planes and their crews , you have to throw a lot of bombs from high altitude that will only be somewhere * near * your target . 
  - that being said , the allies did n't * try * to minimize the damage , but deliberately targeted the civilian population as well , which clearly makes it a war crime . 
  simply shows that even good people sometimes do bad things for good reasons . 
  only had some hundreds of thousands of people killed . 
  swell guy . 
  being better than stalin does n't make you `` not that bad '' . 
  what do you think about nationalism that has not succeeded yet ? 
  as an example , take the kurds . 
  the situation in their area is very complicated , and so are their plans ( independent country versus more autonomy and so on ) , but lets simplify this a lot :, 
  the idea that the kurds should decide about their own government and their own laws in majority-kurdish areas , without interference from turks , arabs , or iranians ( except those who live as minorities in those same areas ) , is a fundamentally * good * idea . 
  do you agree with that , or is that idea already strange to you ? 
  it does n't suggest that at all . 
  other countries are often very foreign to me , at least in some aspects . 
  i simply do n't know what `` succeeding '' would even mean for them , and i do n't have any intention of telling them how to get there . 
  i feel ambitious enough when deciding what would be good for my country - i do n't want to tell you what would be good for yours , and i do n't want you to meddle in my country 's affairs either . 
  when i want to see my country to flourish , i do n't want your country to suffer - your country simply may have nothing to do with this . 
  i think my favorite patriotic song might help change your mind , the [ * kinderhymne * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children%27s_hymn ) ( `` children 's hymn '' ) . 
  the anthem was written by bertolt brecht , and there was a lot of public support for this to become the german anthem after the reunification . 
  i like our current anthem , but i really love this song . 
  ( the text , at least . 
  the pitch at which it is usually sung is difficult to bear . 
  [ here 's a decent version though . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7gkibcpz1s ) ), 
  for the lazy , here the english ( poetic ) translation of the text :, 
   grace spare not and spare no labour ,, 
   passion nor intelligence, 
   that a decent german nation, 
   flourish as do other lands . 
   that the people give up flinching, 
   at the crimes which we evoke ,, 
   and hold out their hands in friendship, 
   as they do to other folk . 
   neither over nor yet under, 
   other peoples will we be, 
   from the oder to the rhineland, 
   from the alps to the north sea . 
   and because we 'll make it better ,, 
   let us guard and love our home ,, 
   love it as our dearest country, 
   as the others love their own . 
  what was the dog 's reaction ? 
  also , was the dog chained and could n't get to your cousin ? 
   some workers stayed behind knowing they would die, 
  point to note : they * did n't * die . 
  so 48 are still alive and well . 
  some 360,000 people die from cancer in japan every year . 
  ( [ source , pdf ] ( http://ganjoho.jp/data/professional/statistics/backnumber/2013/fig01.pdf ) ) in the four years since the incident , that 's 1.4 million people , in a population of some 120 million . 
  so in a randomly chosen group of 50 japanese people , you 'd already expect `` 0.5 deaths '' from cancer after 4 years . 
  having two cases instead is well within the statistical variation that is to be expected in such a small sample . 
  ( * if * there were two deaths from cancer among them . 
  i only know of one . ), 
  yes , they will all die eventually . 
  probably some 15-20 of them from cancer . 
  but that 's not really what you usually mean when you say `` they knew they would die '' . 
  that 's a great definition !, 
  that would suck ; but the way i imagine this , your hands regrow within a few days of cutting your arms . 
  ( around the time it takes until that `` fresh haircut '' look fades . ), 
  so maybe you 'd only want to get one of your arms cut at a time - that would make you look uneven , but you 'd still have at least one hand all of the time . 
  oh , but maybe special units with extra long arms !, 
  what would the most important military benefit of that be ? 
  long legs could be used to cross shallow rivers , or to facilitate naval invasions - you can start wading toward the shore at a longer distance . 
  they never stop growing - i guess your arms would get annoying once they are some 2 or 3 meters long . 
  great answer !, 
  and then some weird teenagers would start getting those bad leg cuts on purpose - ca n't you just picture the crooks , lazily leaning against a wall somewhere ? 
  smug faces , like they own the earth , just because they are tilted at the same angle ? 
  do n't be mean . 
  maybe he just has n't gotten his legs cut in a while , and now he 's too far away from the screen to read that small text . 
  imagine the consequences for boxing !, 
  long-armed boxers trying to keep their opponent at a distance . 
  ( i mean , they already do , but the differences would be much more extreme . ), 
  once the short-arm gets close , it 's almost game over for the long-arm who ca n't fight effectively at that range - except maybe he also has longer legs and can get away easily . 
  before the fight , you would n't even know how tall your opponent is !, 
   military grade conditioner, 
  asking this question was worth it for this idea alone . 
  i think i can change your view much more easily and extremely than others in this thread are even trying .
