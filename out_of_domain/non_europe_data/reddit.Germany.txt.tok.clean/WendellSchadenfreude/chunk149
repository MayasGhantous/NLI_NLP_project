  southern california is fine when compared to seattle or toronto . 
  maybe make both of them long , but use an arm curler on one of them before the fight . 
  your curly arm becomes effectively shorter , but can cover a larger area of your body . 
  `` long distance is n't for me . 
  i ca n't sleep unless my husband 's arms are wrapped around me four times . '', 
  in hindsight , maybe . 
  the west ( and the world ) would be different . 
  but the spartans certainly did n't fight for * democracy * . 
  at least link to the article/video you are talking about then , not just to bild.de 's main page . 
  true enough : a study that looks at both water and energy would be better . 
  the problem is that by only looking at the water , op will * always * get a wrong idea of the cost of living in hot places . 
  that 's like only looking at heating and deciding that all the land north of chicago should n't be settled . 
  the linked study at least looks at the cost of both heating and cooling , so it takes into account both an advantage and a disadvantage of hot places . 
  that 's far from perfect , but it 's better than * only * looking at one disadvantage . 
  now ask yourself * why * insulations are so much better in the north . 
  when you build a house with bad insulation in the south , you need a lot of energy to keep cold in summer . 
  when you build a house with bad insulation in the north , you die in winter . 
  that was me , and it was earlier today ( for me at least ) . 
  i just think this question has some potential , and i wanted to see if this question becomes more popular when the americans are up . 
  good to hear you have a healthy digestion . 
  have fun in there !, 
  i do n't think this is a different subject matter at all . 
  heating in minneapolis absolutely is required for life , and a lot of it if you want to life * comfortably * . 
  if you want to say `` people should n't live there '' about a place , you have to figure in * all * the advantages and disadvantages - focusing only on water will not give you useful information . 
  * that 's * what i 'm trying to tell op . 
  i do n't want to tell people that they should n't live in seattle or minneapolis . 
  but if you ever meet someone who says that you should live there because the heating is so expensive , please do remind them that other places , while not requiring that much energy for heating , have other disadvantages . 
  in a way , fingers already * are * split ends for your arms . 
  do you think split ends would mean you grow additional hands ? 
  if so , what exactly would the problem be ? 
   summer camp pranks would include making your friend a quadriplegic while he 's sleeping lol, 
  that sounds like so much fun . 
  just take an axe to your friend 's legs , and the next day , he has to come to school on his stumpy thighs . 
  `` i had a really bad haircut '' does n't count as an excuse in reality , so `` i had a bad armcut '' also would n't count . 
  and then when jimmy is asked to solve a problem in front of the class , but ca n't reach the blackboard because of his short legs -, 
  `` jimmy seems to be having trouble - can somebody give him a hand ? '', 
  right now , the ecb is spending hundreds of billions to buy government bonds . 
  if you call * that * neo-liberalism , the word has lost all of what little meaning it still had . 
  auto-cannibalism would allow you to survive for weeks without food . 
  simply eating your legs and arms should buy you two or three weeks at least , as long as you have enough water . 
  and once you 're rescued , everything grows back , and there 's no lasting damage done . 
  on the other hand ( hehehe ... ) , the teacher will also protect jimmy when kids are making fun of him during recess . 
  `` kevin , stop pointing your finger at jimmy , or i 'll cut off your leg and kick you in the ass with it ! '', 
  would his legs be 14 feet long , or would they have 14 feet ? 
  or maybe both ... ? 
  that 's his `` et tu , brute '' look . 
  the man is julius caesar after all . 
  anybody have a mirror ? 
  or a copy of the text ? 
  i get blocked because the site is considered unsafe . 
   although one plot hole . 
  why would cops simply let him burst out of questioning room and run to roof . 
  because it 's america pre-9 / 11 , he has n't been aggressive in any way , and they are n't worried about a thing . 
  * m\u00e4dchen * and * k\u00e4se * have exactly the same \u00e4-sound . 
  ( somewhat similar to the fist sound in the english `` and '' . ), 
  the l in * nudeln * also can clearly be heard , not as a change of tone or something , but simply as an - l - . 
  it 's * nudeln * , not * nuden * . 
  - almost all letters in german actually are pronounced , so i 'm afraid i do n't understand what your talking about here . 
  ( there are some exceptions or semi-exceptions . 
  for instance , the word * engel * is not pronounced \\* * en-gel * , ~ ~ it 's ** almost ** e\u00e4e ( n ) - gel , with the - n - only indicating a somewhat more nasal e - . 
  but you still can hear the - n - . ~ ~ ), 
   and i strongly disagree on your portrayal of the pronunciation of engel . 
  yeah , you 're right about that , i do n't know what i did there . 
  i was tired and apparently only remembered that it 's not pronounced en-gel , but messed up after that . 
  when we talk , we do n't have to care , we get it right without ever thinking about it . 
  when you talk , it will always sound weird when you mess up the conjugations . 
  but that 's ok , you 're a foreigner , people expect you to make mistakes - keep talking !, 
  i sees what you do-ed there . 
  imdb disagrees . 
   let them come . 
  there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath . 
  this is so much better than the original . 
  and it does work pretty well . 
  there are a few historic portraits of dwarfs . 
  you can usually see that they * are * dwarfs very clearly . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portrait_of_sebasti%c3%a1n_de_morra ), 
  [ 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portrait_of_francisco_lezcano ), 
  [ 3 ] ( http://portraittimeline.com/1810s%20portraits%20-%20f_files/aragonese_dwarf_ca1811_by_vicente_lopez_y_portana1772-1850_foggmuseum1920.8.jpg ), 
  ~ ~ should n't the mean pool value at 0 tradition be 3.5 rather than 4 ? ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ edit : i believe all the given mean values are too high by 0.5 . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ edit 2 : or maybe i 'm missing something - all the max values also seem to be off by 1 - at 0 tradition , you get nothing but the dice roll , so it should simply be 6 , should n't it ? 
  or is the dice roll actually a random ( 1-7 ) rather than ( 1-6 ) ? 
  in that case , all the values given would be correct . ~ ~, 
  edit 3 : ok , now i get it . 
  i thought the last line , '' +1 , 50 % * chance * '' , only applied to admirals , but it applies to all leaders . 
  so while one extra point of miltradition usually gives you only 0.02 extra pips on military leaders , it gives you 1.02 extra pips if it brings you across a 20 % threshold . 
   you could also put the 50 % chance one after the first random , if you want the explanation to be right after the `` tradition '' ones, 
  this would be the best order , but maybe it 's not the order in which things happen : is the pool divided by 4/3 for admirals before or after that '' +1 , 50 % chance '' is added ? 
   since for each 20 threshold the number of die rolls it affects increases by 1 . 
  damn , of course . 
  but it should be 0.01 [ not 0.02 ] * ( floor ( t/20 ) + 1 ) , right ? 
  going from 0 to 1 gives you 0.01 mean extra pips . 
  going from 20 to 21 gives you 0.02 mean extra pips . 
  going from 80 to 81 gives you 0.05 mean extra pips . 
  i do n't understand - the cps are unimpressive , yet they are the main line of defense ? 
  everywhere else in syria , the hardest battles have been fought over urban areas . 
  even according to this map , the rebels have n't taken more than a few houses in the city proper , so i think it 's a bit early to give up the entire province ( even if this map is correct ) . 
   are earthquakes a problem in the uk ? 
  nope . 
  if i understand [ this list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_earthquakes_in_the_british_isles ) correctly , the last time somebody died from an earthquake in the uk was in 1884 .
