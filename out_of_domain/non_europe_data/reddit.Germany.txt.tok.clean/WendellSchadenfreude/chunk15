  not sure how i would really respond , but what i dislike most about his message is this :, 
  so his loving god does even save the gays if they regret their `` sins '' and accept christ - but he still condemns the muslims , the hindus , the buddhists , ... , and , of course , the atheists . 
  and not for * doing * anything wrong ( christian rapists and murderers are still `` holy through his son '' ) , but for * thoughtcrime * . 
  ( i 'm really quite sure this is n't what i would answer to his post . 
  but it 's what i feel . ), 
  -1 - you have to pay a fee for it , [ it 's around 240 $ ] ( http://www3.uni-bonn.de/studium/beratung/studentensekretariat/sozialbeitrag-gebuehren-und-beitraege ) . 
  and by that i mean that you * have to pay * for it , it 's not optional - i 'm pretty sure that 's true for erasmus students as well . 
  ( edit : the 240 $ is the sum of all the university fees you have to pay . 
  the ticket is the most expensive part of it at ~ 150 $ . ), 
  the main advantage is that this student card is a ticket for all busses in bonn and for all `` regional '' trains in nrw . 
  [ travel all the way to m\u00f6nchengladbach , paderborn and osnabr\u00fcck for free . 
  ( i 'm aware that you have likely never heard of these cities yet . ), 
  -2 - [ the * uni bonn * has a nice variety of sports courses . 
  ] ( http://www.sportangebot.uni-bonn.de/angebote/aktueller_zeitraum/index.html ) some of them are for free , some of them cost 10-20 $ per semester . 
  also , in most courses they never check if you really registered ... do n't ask me how i know that . 
  -3 - i have no idea . 
  -4 - i like poles . 
  you will have to suffer some jokes about poles being all thieves . 
  [ * what 's a polish triathlon ? 
  - walk to the pool , take a bike home . 
  * - stuff like that . ], 
  but i guess the opinion `` we '' have about poles is mostly influenced by polish immigrants , of which there are quite many in nrw . 
  they are hard-working , honest , simple , catholic plumbers and miners ; we generally like them - yes , i am painting in very broad strokes here , of course . 
  should be enough . 
  you wo n't live like a king , but you wo n't starve to death either . 
  `` dark wing *** s *** , dark words . '', 
   i admit i 've never debated with a person who displays the requisite ignorance to advocate that we should keep on releasing toxic chemicals into the environment in the name of economic growth . 
  this is n't even a question , of course we should . 
  and unless you turn of your computer * right now * and * forever * , i have to conclude that you agree . 
  [ the electricity you use is almost certainly at least in part produced by burning coal , and the parts of your computer where all produced in china at high emission of dozens of toxic gases . ], 
  there is ( theoretically ) an * optimal * level for this where we only emit a rather small amount of toxic gases that do little harm so that further reductions would be unreasonably expensive . 
  this `` optimal '' level is not know , of course , but we do know for certain that it is non-zero . 
  most university cafeterias are actually quite good in germany ; i think it 's just a ( global ) tradition to complain about cafeteria food . 
  *** he *** is third person singular . 
  he makes a sound , he makes sounds .

  he/she/it makes a sound or makes sounds . 
  you mean you just put a tree up in your living room and then throw it out again after a few weeks without ever getting to eat any parts of it ? 
  that 's so sad ... 
  ... are you sure ... ? 
  this is where everybody is going to send you . 
  i do n't think it 's really a * reputable * source , but then again : neither is the daily mail . 
  and then some !, 
  careful - as a korean , he might [ be afraid of fans ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fan_death ) , 
  remote diagnosing relationships over the internet is fun !, 
  it does n't sound like you should do anything about this . 
  you do n't want to lose him and are willing to tolerate his beliefs ; if he feels the same way , you do n't have a problem . 
  if he ca n't tolerate your disbelief , you do have a problem , of course . 
  but in that case , there is n't much you * can * do . 
  * if * he breaks up with you over this , it will feel horrible , but you will find a better bf easily . 
  ( sorry if this sounds patronizing . ), 
  enough about the relationship stuff , on to the fun atheism part !, 
   [ ... ] you believe that god is the most reasonable and logical answer you personally can come up with to explain events, 
  if you guys keep talking about this stuff , you might want to ask him how the answer `` god did it '' actually * explains anything * . 
  what does it even * mean * to believe that god created the big bang ? 
  i feel like that does n't change anything . 
  ( well , it does put god outside the universe , i.e. 
  outside of the sum of everything that exists ... ), 
  your use of the word agnostic , btw , was totally acceptable . 
  there 's just a bunch of people here who are sooo very proud that they learnt something about one possible definition of this word that they have to shove this knowledge in everybody 's face . 
  these people are assholes . 
  it 's not arbitrarily chosen !, 
  space_dolphins * is * 26 . , 
  it * is * a very good mindset , although a little more romanticism does n't harm anyone , either . 
  there 's no reason except statistics ^ and ^ his ^ mother why you should n't end up marrying him - and fuck statistics . 
  i hope you accept the fact that you 're an [ ignostic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignosticism ) . 
  yes , that definition game supports multiplayer !, 
  god , i love feynman . 
  do n't worry , you 're only second to last of the contries * shown * . 
  i 'm sure almost the entire middle east is down there with you . 
  i do n't want to downvote you , because this is a pretty cool picture . 
  but even in america , only the giant dinosaur-fish has anything to do with atheism , albeit only remotely . 
  the most hardcore christians could agree with everything on there and only `` correct '' your misstake of thinking that this animal lived in the `` triassic '' period - when obviously , there was no such period , and the fish-thing probably lived at the time of noah 's flood . 
  silly you . 
  so i understand that you do n't normally live with your family any more ? 
  if you do , i 'd like to redirect you to an important hint in the faq - [ should i come out to my parents as being an atheist ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq#toc_41 ) we do n't know your parents and family at all and this might not be a realistic risk , but there are parents who kick out their children for being atheists . 
  *** if *** there 's a risk of this happening to you , the standard advice here is to fake it until you 're old enough to move out and can `` come out to your parents [ ... ] at a home you own , over a dinner that you paid for yourself . '', 
  so , your parents might punish you , and you should be worried about this . 
  god , on the other hand - i do n't believe in his existence at all any more , but even when i imagine him being real , i do n't really fear his punishment . 
  i try to be a good person , and i think i usually am , so why would god punish me ? 
  the idea of a * loving * god who will punish you * forever * for some minor `` sins '' sounds completely absurd to me . 
  if the christian god exists , i 'm pretty sure he would * actually * be as you describe it :, 
   it would be just fine if god just sits with you after your death and says `` it 's ok , we all make mistakes '', 
  would still be embarrassing enough , god and all your religious family making fun of you in the afterlife : `` you really fell for those * fossils * and thought * evolution * was true ? 
  oh my , we had a good laugh about you ... '', 
  but even * if * this god exists and is a vengeful and petty jackass , he might still punish you if you 're a `` good christian '' - maybe the muslims are right !, 
  maybe the romans were , or the vikings , or the aztecs . 
  even if you knew for a fact that some god exists - do you really think you were lucky enough to just be born into a family who worships the * right * one ? 
  while all other religious people are still just as wrong as us atheists ? 
  i 'm sorry i do n't have great advice on how to handle your family . 
  you 're right , reddit wo n't `` solve '' this for you . 
  maybe just this small thing : if you decide to `` come out '' to them , it might help if you avoid the word `` atheist '' , at least for a while . 
  just saying that you 're not sure about your faith anymore and that you think people can be good without being christians might be enough . 
  or telling them you 're an agnostic and just do n't know if god exists anymore . 
  something like that ... 
  may i ask how old the two of you are , and if you will have to see him in the future ? 
  ( i.e. 
  classmates or something . ),
