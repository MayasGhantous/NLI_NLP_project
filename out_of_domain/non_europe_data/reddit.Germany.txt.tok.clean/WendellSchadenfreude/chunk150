  oh , this feels like a challenge !, 
  in the [ battle of l\u00fctzen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_l%c3%bctzen_%281632%29 ) in 1632 , the protestants won one of the most important victories of the thirty years ' war . 
  yet gustav adolf , king of sweden , was killed in the battle . 
  in the [ battle of cunaxa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cunaxa ) , ( if the reports of xenophon can be believed , ) the greek mercenaries shattered the persian troops . 
  their victory became meaningless , however , because their employer cyrus - pretender to the throne of persia - was killed in the battle . 
  the [ battle of kosovo ( 1389 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kosovo ) can be counted as a draw because both sides took heavy losses . 
  it can also be counted as a clear ottoman victory , because the invading turks could take those losses , while they were devastating to the defending serbs . 
  however you count it : both sides lost their commander in the battle . 
  the are all rather famous battles , i 'm sure there must be many less prominent examples . 
  still , you are right , of course : losing their commander is usually * bad news * for an army . 
  ( even just going from my own examples : the ottomans did great despite losing their sultan , but the swedes did much better under gustav adolf than they did in the years after his death , and the greeks were in a world of trouble immediately after cyrus ' death . ), 
   it does n't get any clearer than this , boys . 
  the perpetrator is literally rocking the flag of his side . 
  for those who want to have a look at the flag without any gore : [ here 's a clean picture , sfw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zksapor.jpg ) . 
  the flag in question is only partly visible ( in the original as well ) , but it looks more like the iraqi flag to me . 
  nicely done . 
  i 'll just quietly put this link here : [ haltern am see ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haltern ) . 
  sorry for your town 's losses . 
  oops . 
  did n't even see the tiny flag on his uniform . 
  [ here you go , sfw . 
  that appears to be the iraqi flag . 
  it 's red , white , and very dark - might be dark green , might be black . 
  but in the center , there clearly are two dark symbols ; not one big , bright sun . 
  some irrelevant ... actor , or something . 
  the guy at the bottom , in case anyone does n't know him , is the self-styled `` caliph '' of the `` islamic state '' , abu bakr al-baghdadi . 
  very nice examples !, 
  have you tried printing it out yourself ? 
  there 's also * k\u00f6nigtum * and * zarentum * . 
  in english , i would say the words k\u00f6nigtum , kaisertum , zarentum could all be translated as `` monarchy '' , only that the `` monarch '' is defined more precisely - so it 's basically `` king-archy '' or `` emperor-archy '' - which would mean the same thing as `` kingdom '' or `` empire '' . 
  the austrian empire can also be called the habsburg monarchy , so that still works in english . 
  the words mean the same thing , except `` kaisertum '' has a double meaning - it means both the country and the government system . 
  so there was a `` kaisertum \u00d6sterreich '' , but there still was an '' \u00d6sterreich '' even after the * kaisertum * was abolished . 
  when in doubt , go with `` kaiserreich '' . 
  `` kaisertum '' sounds old-fashioned . 
  edit : i guess you realize this , but i 'll spell it out anyway : the - tum is etymologically the same thing as the english - dom in `` kingdom '' or `` tsardom '' . 
  even with the same level of quality , the same level of depth and detail would not be possible if we tried to cover everything from algiers to karachi . 
  i 'm worried the sub would get flooded if we allowed all kinds of posts that are neither related to syria directly nor important enough to have repercussions for the entire me . 
   would it not be the similar to the `` dom '' in `` kingdom '' ? 
  uh , yes ? 
  that 's exactly what i said . 
  has been there since this morning . 
  do n't worry , that line can easily make it look like a comment ends there . 
  btw , `` der dom '' is not related to - dom / - tum . 
  the former comes from latin * domus * ( `` house '' ) , the latter is germanic . 
  it * does n't * . 
  / r/athiesm exists , the sub for nonbelievers with a spelling problem . 
  but the target group is probably too small to warrant its own debate forum . 
  thank you for this comment . 
  too bad the people of / worldnews would rather be enraged than informed . 
  if germany were to ban all cars made by non-german companies , that would affect future profits of the us automobile industry . 
  this means they could sue germany , even though there was no contract between them and germany at all . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  it 's not . 
  but when anti-regime sources report regime victories , it 's more credible than if they report regime defeats . 
  the opposite is true for well-defined sources . 
  ... for the duration of the war . 
  smart move , but it 's not like they actually said that having higher taxes for non-muslims is wrong . 
  wikipedia was kind enough to do it . 
  ( summary of the original ontological argument , by anselm of canterbury . ), 
   it is a conceptual truth ( or , so to speak , true by definition ) that god is a being than which none greater can be imagined ( that is , the greatest possible being that can be imagined ) . 
   god exists as an idea in the mind . 
   a being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is , other things being equal , greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind . 
   thus , if god exists only as an idea in the mind , then we can imagine something that is greater than god ( that is , a greatest possible being that does exist ) . 
   but we can not imagine something that is greater than god ( for it is a contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than the greatest possible being that can be imagined . ), 
   therefore , god exists . 
  i think this argument has never convinced anyone who was n't conviced already . 
  i do n't mind . 
  remember : almost all rulers in the game are men , all generals and admirals are , and every event that does n't specifically mention women is an event about men . 
  the ratio of men to women in the game is still clearly higher than 10:1 . 
  if you do n't feel like reading the long life stories , do n't . 
  just find out what your options mean in game terms , pick one and move on . 
  it 's just what these words do . 
  for what it 's worth : many native speakers use `` weil '' when they should use `` denn '' ( or change the word order ), 
  - many natives would use this sentence . 
  i do n't like it and think it 's wrong , but it 's acceptable if you are descriptivist enough . 
  the civilians that you see in this video apparently * were * fleeing . 
  i do n't see how that matters . 
  poachers should n't be killed for being poachers . 
  whenever feasible , they should be arrested and punished in different ways . 
  the problem is that poachers are armed and unwilling to let themselves be arrested . 
  trying to do it means taking unneccessary risks to possibly save their lives - which is commendable , but not ethically required . 
  comparable example : people should n't be killed for speeding , obviously . 
  but if you are speeding in a technical mounting a heavy machine gun , you probably will be shot at a distance . 
  you still should n't be shot for speeding , but you ca n't expect others to put their lives at risk just to save yours . 
  since you already have some serious answers , here 's mine : it can , but [ only in beer commercials .

  mostly so that you 'll remember the slogan . 
  [ double dutch ( uncountable ) ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/double_dutch ) , wiktionary :, 
   1 incomprehensible language . 
   2 a language game akin to pig latin . 
   3 a game of jump rope with two ropes and frequently two jumpers . 
   4 ( colloquial ) sex using a condom and the contraceptive pill at the same time . 
   if you somehow ended up in estonia 200 years ago , their culture would be totally foreign to you . 
  this is simply not true . 
  the people who lived in estonia 200 years ago already were estonians , they spoke estonian , and their culture was an obvious predecessor of the culture of today 's estonia . 
  if a modern estonian were transported to estonia 200 years ago , he 'd need a few weeks to learn the language , and could blend in quite well after that . 
  if he were transported to germany 200 years ago , this would be much more difficult . 
  if he were transported to china , namibia , or brazil , he would * actually * be in a culture totally foreign to him . 
  you could probably transport an estonian 2,000 years ( ! ),
