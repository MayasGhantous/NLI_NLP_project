  back in time , and he 'd still be able to talk to his ancestors after learning their `` dialect '' for a few weeks . 
  i think you make very interesting points and are actually more convincing than tzuridis - only i 'm still not quite certain * what * it is that you 're trying to convince us of . 
  alexander was not greek , he was something very similar to greek that does not have a modern match closer than greek ? 
  to make an apostrophe , you probably have to press shift + # , the # key being between the * \u00c4 * and the * enter * key on your keyboard . 
  the little thing you used is actually an [ acute accent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acute_accent ) . 
  your original post is rather boring . 
  edit : but wow , did i ever love your edit . 
  good job !, 
  seriously : could we get some opinions in here from people who have experiences with european weddings ? 
  i 've been to a few very nice weddings , but never involved with the finances . 
  at my best guess , if i calculate generously , i still would n't think any of the couples paid even $ 10k . 
  the reformation was also heresy in christianity . 
  the reformers also never * said * that they wanted to create some new form of christianity , they only said that they wanted to go back to what christianity had always been meant to be , while accusing the catholics of having strayed far from that . 
  how much do you pay in the first place ? 
  if he does a great job , i think i 'd tip the dj at my wedding maybe 50 $ . 
  up to 100 $ if i feel he was really awesome . 
  but honestly : i have no idea how much a dj at a wedding costs in germany . 
  edit : if there 's an agreed end time when he could legally simply pack up and leave , but he stays longer because your guests still want to dance , then you should definitely tip him . 
  maybe 50 $ per hour after the agreed time . 
  took me several minutes to spot the owl sitting in the tree near the left edge . 
  [ am i doing this right , / u/hallucinates _ owls ? ], 
  can somebody copypaste the text here ? 
  i always get blocked from almasdarnews . 
  do you mean the metaphorical weathermen who are right about simple yes-or-no predictions roughly 50 % of the time , or actual modern weathermen who are right about their ( short-term ) predictions roughly * always * ? 
  huge subsidies . 
  the companies running the electric grid are obligated to buy all the electricity produced by solar panels at absurdly inflated prices , for the first twenty years after installation of the panels . 
  the costs are passed on to all consumers of electricity . 
  it 's a sad story , really . 
  putting up solar panels in germany is so wasteful as long as there is still even a single un-paneled roof in spain . 
  it `` works '' because we throw money at it . 
  you 'd never recover your investment with solar panels in germany if it were n't for the guaranteed high prices at which the grid companies have to buy your power . 
  neither would you in spain , although you 'd come a lot closer . 
  so the concept would `` work '' better in spain than it does in germany , but it would still be a net loss for the country . 
  i assume you do n't have a middle name that might help ? 
  ( a male friend of mine has a slavic name that ends in - a and thus sounds very female to germans , so he always includes his indubitably male middle name when it matters . ), 
  while you ca n't sign your email as `` herr xyz '' , i think you can add an automatic signature/footer that includes `` herr '' . 
  i normally would n't include it there either , but it does n't look weird to me , and in any case : people do n't pay much attention to footers anyway . 
  but it will still help if people are confused about your gender and check the email for clues .

  today is thursday , the day of the god of thunder , so what is a more appropriate way to celebrate than with a development diary for europa univeralis iv . 
  we 've talked about development and politics the last few weeks , so now its time to talk a bit more about warfare again , before going back to more peacetime-related activities . 
  all of this mentioned in this development diary will be in the free update accompanying the next expansion . 
  fortress rework, 
  connecting a bit to the previous reveal of our change to how building works , we have overhauled the fortress system . 
  there are now four different forts , one available each century , providing 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 fort-levels each . 
  a newer fort makes the previous obsolete , so you only have 1 fort in each province . 
  each fortress also provides 5000 garrison per fort level , so besieging a fortress now requires a large investment . 
  forts now also require maintenance to be paid each month , which currently costs about 1.5 ducats for a level 1 fort per month in 1444 . 
  luckily , you can mothball a fortress which makes it drop to just 10 men defending it , and wo n't cost you anything in upkeep . 
  garrison growth for a fort is also a fair amount slower than before , so after you have taken a fort , you may want to stick around to protect it for a bit . 
  what is most important to know though , is that forts now have a zone of control . 
  first of all , they will automatically take control of any adjacent province that does not have any forts that is adjacent and hostile to them . 
  if two fortress compete over the same province , then the one with highest fort-level wins and in case of a tie , control goes to the owner of the province . 
  secondly , you can not walk past a fortress and its zone of control , as you have to siege down the blocking fort first . 
  each capital have a free fort-level , but that fort will not have any zoc , as most minor nations can not afford a major fortress .

  looting, 
  as we promised , we have now completely revised how looting works . 
  now there is a `` pile '' of possible loot in a province , which is directly tied to have developed the province is . 
  at the end of each month , all hostile units in a province attempt to loot , and the amount they loot depend on how many regiments you have there , and what types they are , where cavalry is by far the best . 
  some ideas and governments increase the amount you loot each month , where for example steppe hordes gains a nice boost . 
  a province starts recovering from being looted when 6 months have passed since last loot , and it takes up to a year until it has fully recovered . 
  of course , the penalty on a province from being looted is still there until it has fully recovered , but it is scaled on how much have been looted . 
  [ img ], 
  committed armies, 
  one of the major complaints we have had on the combat in eu4 , has been the fact that you can fully abort your movement whenever you liked . 
  this have been changed , and now you ca n't abort your movement if you have already moved 50 % of the way . 
  after all , its just common sense that a unit that have already moved halfway between the centers of two provinces is already in the second one . 
  force limits, 
  we felt that the calculations of forcelimits where far too hidden from the player , players saw stuff like `` +25.87 from provinces '' , which based based on projections of base-tax amongst other things , and sometimes those dropped for no obvious reasons . 
  now you will be able to see in each province how much it provides to your forcelimits , and we have cleaned up the logic . 
  each level of development gives 0.1 land and naval forcelimit . 
  overseas will provide -2 land and -2 naval forcelimit, 
  inland provinces will not provide any naval forcelimit . 
  however , a province will never be able to provide negative forcelimits . 
  a nation also have a base value of +3 land and +2 naval force limit , and there are some other ways to get direct forcelimit increased , that are not just percentage increases . 
  [ img ], 
  next week , we 'll be back and talk more about the devout . 
  that does n't sound natural to me . 
  if that were true , you should agree that we can now abolish the laws guaranteeing that all their electricity has to be bought at inflated prices . 
  if you agree with that , i do n't have any reason to keep arguing . 
  but i 'm certain they would * not * be profitable anywhere in germany without this special treatment . 
  the simple argument is this : if they were profitable ( * without * subsidies ) in germany ( even if it were only in freiburg or some other sunny places ) , they 'd be pure money-printing machines in spain and other sunny countries . 
  they are only profitable because they are subsidized . 
  this * might * change at some point in the future , of course . 
  but putting solar panels on all the roofs while we know they are not really worth it is nothing but a waste of money . 
  they do , but slowly . 
  at the moment , you get roughly [ 12c per kwh ] ( http://www.solaranlagen-portal.com/photovoltaik/wirtschaftlichkeit/einspeiseverguetung ) . 
  that 's much better than a few years ago , when you would get 40c + . 
  just to be clear : the prices are only lowered for * new * panels - the ones that were installed years ago still get the prices that were guaranteed back then , and will until they are 20 years old . 
  12c/kwh sounds good at first , because we are used to prices of 20 + c/kwh as consumers . 
  however , most of the consumer price is not for the production of the electricity . 
  when you buy electricity at an energy exchange , it only [ costs some 4c/kwh ] ( http://www.bhkw-infozentrum.de/statement/ueblicher_preis_bhkw.html ) ( because that 's the cost of generating the power in a conventional power plant ) , or [ some 6c/kwh during times of high consumption ] ( http://www.iwr.de/news.php?id=23140 ) . 
  luckily , that 's when solar panels produce most of their power , but still : they get prices roughly * twice as high as they should * , and they will get those for 20 years . 
  even just in the context of the eeg , photovoltaics is wasteful . 
  wind turbines generate much more than twice as much power ( 47 % of all renewable energy versus ~ 20 % ) , but the [ costs caused by photovoltaics are more than three times as high as those for wind .
