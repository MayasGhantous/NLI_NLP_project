  photovoltaics in germany are a huge waste of money , and we can be absolutely certain that they are until places like spain or florida start covering all their roofs . 
  and the amount of money we waste for it is enormous : 19.4 billion $ in 2013 alone for all the renewables , 42 % of that for solar . 
  ( see the wikipedia article . ), 
  even if you only cared about the climate and not about money at all : 19 billion euros per year could be used to * so much more * effect elsewhere . 
   regarding costs , it 's nice that wind is reasonably cheap in the german context , but photovoltaics has huge and yet-unrealized capital cost decrease potential , and solid state devices are basically maintenance-free, 
  then why the hell are we putting expensive garbage on all our roofs instead of waiting until the good stuff becomes available ? 
  i 'm sure we could get into a long , pointless discussion about nucear energy as well , but i do n't really feel like that . 
  you do realize however that solar in germany is several times as expensive as * wind energy * ? 
  progress does n't happen because we waste a lot of money on the stuff that we know to be crap . 
  if you want to fund r&d , fund r&d . we are paying 18 billion $ ( !, 
  read that number again ! ), 
  every year for renewables , the biggest share of that for solar . 
  giving 1 bn per year to universities directly would be much cheaper * and * would actually give us better panels . 
  means that overseas provinces do n't contribute to your forcelimits at all until they 've reached a certain level of development .

   how can treating the water on the surface be more likely to contaminate groundwater than straight up pumping it in the ground ? 
  `` the ground '' is a big place . 
  the layers from which we extract gas via fracking are much deeper than groundwater aquifers . 
  if we pump dirty water into those layers ( and it stays there ) , it 's far away from the groundwater that we want to keep clean .

  links for those who are confused : it 's are wordplay on [ prognathism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prognathism ) and [ the pragmatic sanction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pragmatic_sanction_of_1713 ) . 
   prognathism is the positional relationship of the mandible and/or maxilla to the skeletal base where either of the jaws protrudes beyond a predetermined imaginary line in the coronal plane of the skull . 
   the pragmatic sanction ( latin : pragmatica sanctio ) was an edict issued by charles vi on 19 april 1713 , to ensure that the habsburg hereditary possessions could be inherited by a daughter . 
  [ ... ] charles vi was , indeed , ultimately succeeded by his elder daughter maria theresa ( born 1717 ) . 
  despite the promulgation of the pragmatic sanction , however , her accession in 1740 resulted in the outbreak of the war of the austrian succession .

   why not use hydrogen sulfide gas ? 
  it would basically be like farting somebody to death . 
  if that 's not cruel and unusual ( and de-humanizing ) , i do n't know what is . 
   i remember a kurdish soldier who saw a suicide car bomb riding to a peshmerga checkpoint where 30 soldiers were patrolling . 
  he quickly got in his own car , started driving and crashed his own car into that of the suicide carbomb . 
  he lost his own life , but saved the life 30 kurdish peshmerga soldiers . 
  that is so cool - you hear a lot about suicide attacks , but this is the first story of a suicide * defense * i 've heard . 
  i 'm really happy that germany is helping the kurds . 
  i hope your people will be able to govern themselves democratically in the future , be it in a state of their own or in autonomous regions of the existing states . 
  so the more common question would have been : `` slaves of reddit , how do you feel about your situation ? '',

   thomas sallyfuckin ' jefferson, 
  that is one big wall of text . 
   stating that it would , by 1 june 2004 , respond to any offence with a rationale of self-defense , is yet another open revelation of the organization 's terrorist nature . 
  stating that you will defend yourself is a revelation of a terrorist nature ? 
  to be fair : the kurds have a long and bloody history with the turks , and not all of it was turkey 's fault . 
  that 's about as much as i 'm willing to concede . 
  luckily , we 're not supporting the kurds against turkey , but against isis . 
  if the kurds start using milans against turkey , we should stop sending them new missiles . 
   and i 'm not ok with handing out guns to fuel conflicts . 
  when the attacking side is already armed and set on genocide , giving some means of defense to their chosen victims is n't `` fueling a conflict '' . 
  geil is hardly ever used to mean * horny * any more , it almost always means * awesome * .

  [ * wired * interview ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes ), 
   ** how do you feel about your word meme being reappropriated by the internet ? 
   the meaning is not that far away from the original . 
  it 's anything that goes viral . 
  in the original introduction to the word meme in the last chapter of the selfish gene , i did actually use the metaphor of a virus . 
  so when anybody talks about something going viral on the internet , that is exactly what a meme is and it looks as though the word has been appropriated for a subset of that . 
  overall , he seems to be pretty ok with it .

  i do n't think that grouping of crimes is helpful . 
  `` skandieren volksverhetzender parolen '' ( ~ * chanting agitating propaganda * ) can be some grandpa yelling at a cloud , while anschl\u00e4ge ( ~ * attacks * ) includes arson and murder . 
  i know the numbers were high in the 90 's , but there 's one thing i always wonder : what happened to those people since ? 
  how many of them returned to their home countries , how many live happily and productively in germany , how many are still dependent on our society 's help , etc. ? 
  i think this is vital information when discussing asylum , yet i 've never learned anything about it from the media . 
  - do you know anything about that ? 
  interesting how it seems these numbers increased drastically since obama was re-elected . 
  thanks , obama !, 
  my point is : if you do n't want to imply causation , there 's no reason to bring this up . 
  you 're just throwing dirt and hoping some of it will stick .

  `` average annual hours worked by persons engaged '' - that sounds like they simply asked random people in the street about their job . 
  it does n't look like a comparison of people who actually have a full-time job , or any job .

  as far as i can see , we do n't have anything else to work with .

  i 'm not so much claiming that they used flawed methods , i 'm complaining that we have no idea what they did . 
  we do n't know how the data were measured , we do n't know what the data actually show , we ca n't read anything useful from this at all . 
  `` who 's your daddy ? '', 
   destined to hours-off from work and can not be used to take days off . 
  so it can be used to go home early , or to do some shopping during a long lunch breack , or to sleep until noon before you go to work , or to take a nap at work whenever you feel like it ? 
  how do people not use that ? 
  as a german , i have to ask : do you think you hate your family more than we hate your family , or more than we hate ours ?
