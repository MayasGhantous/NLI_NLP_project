  but you could go home at noon on friday and not come back until noon on monday ? 
  i believe you that full days off are still better than that - but it sounds * almost * as nice as a long weekend . 
  ah , ok then ... that might be true . 
  na , he 's not complaining . 
  just explaining that it is n't quite as good as simply having 40 + days off . 
  if you know what the graphs actually show , do n't leave the rest of us guessing : * what * were they actually comparing ? 
  the average annual work hours of some randomly chosen people , of all employees , of all available members of the workforce , of all adults , of all full-time employees ? 
  these graphs are garbage , because we do n't know what we 're looking at . 
   engaged meaning working, 
  i read `` persons engaged '' as `` people who engaged in this survey '' , i.e. 
  `` people we asked and got a response from '' . 
  your interpretation makes much more sense , and also makes the data more useful . 
  ( it 's still problematic to compare these numbers without knowing anything about unemployment rates or part-time work quotas , but at least we know what numbers we * are * comparing . ), 
  do you have an expression similar to the `` erbfeind '' ? 
  ( ~ `` hereditary enemy '' ), 
  it 's not really a slur , but useful to make it clear in one word how you feel about the french . 
  ( `` i hate them , because my father hated them and his father hated them and * his * father hated them , and that 's just how a good german feels . '' ), 
  when you search for `` erbfeind '' in the german wikipedia , it takes you to a long and detailed article about the french-german enmity , and that article does n't even seem to exist in french . 
  extremely disappointing !, 
  there are no serious tournaments in untimed chess . 
   interesting side note , the soviets have been accused of cheating before on the tournaments back in the days . 
  they would purposely draw against each other so their overall points is higher . 
  that does n't increase their overall points , it just distributes them more evenly . 
  which is usually not what you want . 
  afaik , they `` cheated '' by doing quite the opposite . 
  there were usually many soviet participants in the big tournaments , since chess is very popular in russia and many neighbouring countries . 
  as soon as one of them emerged as the apparently strongest soviet player , all the others would purposely lose against that player without even putting up much of a fight . 
  that does n't increase their overall points , but it meant that the `` soviet champion '' had some easy games over the course of the tournament , and thus was more rested in the only games that mattered - the ones against western players . 
  to make things easier , you can link to the specific comment you are talking about , and add ? context = `` number '' ( `` number '' being the number of parent comments that you want to include ; 2 in this case ) at the end of the permalink . 
  [ like this . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/cfbkx/im_85_certain_that_there_is_an_adult_actress_in/c0s6bzw?context=2 ) it highlights the relevant comment and makes it easier to understand . 
  btw , i agree with you : that was the most cleverest comment in all of reddit 's history ever . 
  very nice tip . 
  i especially like [ this picture ] ( http://www.duden.de/_media_/full/e/ecke-201020085886.jpg ) of an * ecke * . 
  that just sounds like a realistic football scenario : corner , header , goal . 
  alliance systems are n't permanent . 
  the alliances had been different ( and had * prevented * war ) in the late 19th century , they might have reverted back to that at some point , or changed into something entirely new , if the assassination had n't triggered the war too soon for that to happen . 
  as others have noted : war between the us and the soviet union was basically inevitable . 
  only the events that easily could have triggered it ( cuba etc. ), 
  actually * did n't * , and then the soviet union collapsed . 
  something comparable could easily have happened in 1915-1920 . 
  only it could n't , because the assassination happened first . 
   you think that one of the great powers collapsing is likely within 6 years of 1914 ? 
  i 'm going to call bullshit , unless you can provide real evidence of this being probable , not just possible . 
  too easy by far . 
  [ russia * did * collapse in 1917 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_revolution ) . 
  granted , they did so during and partly due to the war . 
  but a communist revolution was possible in russia as well as in some other european countries at the time . 
  if not russia , i suspect austria-hungary would have been most likely to collapse - not because of communists , but because of its ethnic minorities . 
  and it does n't even take a revolution or a collapse to change an alliance system . 
  this comment is a general tip for life , not just for this specific video . 
  * never * read youtube comments . 
  while turkish and saudi support is the main factor in him being in trouble in the first place . 
   it seems , to me , that the majority of the rebel forces are rather extremist . 
  what is your take on this ? 
  you do n't need a majority to be extremists . 
  it 's enough that the majority is unwilling to actively * stop * the extremists . 
  and there are very few rebels who are willing to fight nusra and the other fanatics just to protect syrian minorities . 
  that does n't cause much trouble to a government with an army . 
  the main factor in him continuing to live also is that he keeps breathing , not some foreign support . 
  yet without foreign support , somebody might make him stop breathing soon . 
  just as he would easily have made his opponents stop protesting , had it not been for foreign support . 
  that 's not so weird , it 's just what happens when you have a recessive gene that is not too rare , but also not too common in the population . 
  their parents carry the genes for being gingers , but they also carry the gene for being more typical `` middle-eastern '' . 
  if two such parents have four kids , you statistically get one child that is a ginger and three children with darker hair , although two of these also carry a copy of the recessive `` ginger-gene '' ( and might thus have ginger kids themselves ) . 
  good to know that , but he was likely just [ making a simpsons reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szbporwog00&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=55 ) , so the correct answer would have been : `` it glides as softly as a cloud ! '', 
   where ever i go in the middle east , as soon as people find out that am iraqi , they start telling me how great saddam hussien was . 
  this is actually quite similar to the experience of being german in the middle east . 
  did they only just lose that village when they lost idlib and re-took it now , or did they not hold it before ? 
  does the saa have an observable strategy for the idlib governorate at the moment ? 
  i 'm an saa supporter , but it feels like they are just posting news about meaningless `` successes '' to hide the fact that they have no idea what to do in the region . 
  yes , that 's shockingly common . 
  makes you sit in stumped silence when people hear you are german and reply with `` ah , i love germany !, 
  what hitler did to the jews , that was good ! '', 
  `` umm ... thank you , i guess ... ? '', 
  i hope you could control yourself after that . 
  otherwise , bystanders will only see how you push two old ladies down the stairs and then start laughing hysterically . 
  i think the most important factor is that the `` public atheists '' have been around for about 10 years . 
  the end of faith , the god delusion , god is not great - these books were published between 2004 and 2007 . 
  that 's too recent to convince many of today 's 35-44 year-olds , but just in time for the 25-34 crowd . 
  around that time , it became normal to have some people who were known to the public mostly for being atheists , and good at it . 
   the ozone crumbling, 
  [ the ozone layer is n't really crumbling anymore . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ozone_depletion#prospects_of_ozone_depletion ) even over antarctica , where the ozone hole was worst , it 's expected to return to pre-cfc levels over the next few decades . 
  we found out about this in time to avoid mayor problems . 
  let 's hope we 'll say the same thing about climate change one day . 
  how about one look at the article ? 
   religion, 
   which of the following religions or belief systems , if any , do you associate with ? 
   church of england = 33 %, 
   catholicism = 10 %, 
   other christian = 9 %, 
   judaism = 1 %, 
   other religion = 3 %, 
  not 30 . 
  `` j\u00e4h '' sounds very oldfashioned to me . 
  i would n't use it at all , except in some expressions like `` ein j\u00e4hes ende '' , `` j\u00e4h aus dem schlaf gerissen '' . 
  * fernsehen * is such a weird word , i do n't understand why they use it for these examples . 
  `` filme gucken '' ( * watching movies * ) would work just as well , and avoid all the confusion about `` fern sehen '' - `` fernsehen '' - `` fernsehgucken '' - `` fernseh gucken '' - `` fernsehen gucken '' etc. 
  - that sounds fine to me .
