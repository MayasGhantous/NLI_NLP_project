  ( i prefer `` lieber '' in place of `` eher '' here , but they both work . ), 
  ~ ~ er liest gerne b\u00fccher eher als filme gucken ~ ~ - nope , that makes no sense . 
  - i do n't think that sentence works without the `` zu '' . 
  it 's hard to imagine that sentence without some pretentious emphasis on the word `` b\u00fccher '' ( i read books , you peasant , while you watch day-time television !, 
  ) , but i do n't think it 's because of the position of * lieber * . 
  - sounds the same to me . 
  - yep , still the same . 
  do n't start small in your first few games . 
  play france , spain , sweden - the easy nations . 
  you might still lose , because the game is complicated . 
  or you might win , because these nations have it really easy . 
  but if you pick difficult starts in your first games - even if it works and you do n't die !, 
  - you 'll never have an enjoyable game as france , because that will be far too easy later on . 
  are the fighters on the kurdish side still mostly the same few guys who at one point only held a small corner of kobane city , or have they received massive reinforcements from somewhere by now ? 
  i know of the ~ 150 peshmerga , but is that all ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's `` meme '' like `` gene '' , because that 's where it comes from . 
   definative, 
  i just want to correct this because i feel it 's a common mistake : it 's * definitive * . 
  there are definitely no vowels other than e 's and i 's in there . 
   there is , and it 's got a long name like that sundress one . 
  what 's `` that sundress one '' ? 
   ooooooor him leaving now , combined with a general ceasefire ,, 
  anything combined with a general ceasefire sounds good . 
  anything combined with a general ceasefire also sounds like pure fantasy . 
  i do n't think the government side would collapse entirely if assad and his family left ( or were ousted ) , but i certainly do n't believe they would simply make peace with jan and isis after that . 
  copypaste what you can read into google , read the rest . 
  nsfl explanation : you see a kid writhing on the ground in pain , and one of his legs has been half ripped off - longitudinally . 
  shreds of meat and lots of blood . 
  look , puppies !, 
   required a 2 week warranty process, 
  [ in germany ... ] you can just request a replacement for the broken piece online , and they send it to you , free of charge . 
  if it 's not too far away , you can also drive back to ikea and get the missing/broken pieces immediately , also free of charge . 
  it 's cute how they are still `` leaking '' stuff when the documents are [ openly published by the eu anyway . 
  ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230 ) guess it sounds more dramatic that way . 
  you can * not * make that point for most countries . 
  of course you always have people who call themselves christians/muslims / ... but are n't much influenced by it in their daily lives . 
  but the extent to which this is true for scandinavian `` protestants '' is * far * higher than in most regions/religions in the world . 
  i do n't care enough to find `` a widely recognised scientific study '' just so that you * might * believe me , but i spent five seconds on google and found a [ new york times article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) that has a nice opener for you :, 
   anyone who has paid attention knows that denmark and sweden are among the least religious nations in the world . 
  he * explained * the numbers , because everybody who cares knows that scandinavia is one of the least religious places in the world and it might be confusing to see it as `` at least 70 % protestant christians '' . 
  in scandinavia , it 's those same `` protestant christians '' who do n't care about religion , never go to church , and often enough do n't even believe in god . 
  you 're `` arguing '' by simply claiming `` well , that 's true everywhere '' . 
  it is ** not ** , and this has nothing to do with how one feels about religion . 
  i 'd take it . 
  nobody doubts that ~ 70 % are * registered * as protestants . 
  nobody with half a brain doubts that * far fewer * actually are protestant christians , as far as their beliefs are concerned . 
  [ here , if you really need something to balance out your belief in this map ] ( http://books.google.de/books?id=taefipovx4mc&amp;pg=pa47&amp;dq=%22cambridge+companion+to+atheism%22&amp;psp=1&amp;sig=xerpbqay_zs2zxsryr0tajovdsk&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cambridge%20companion%20to%20atheism%22&amp;f=false ) - this book , on page 49 , cites several studies from the past 15 years that found that between 46 % and 85 % ( ! ), 
  of swedes do not believe in god . 
  i also plan to come back to this thread tomorrow and laugh at it * again * . 
  not sure if typo or misunderstanding , but it 's '' ... ** of ** perpetual sorrow '' , not `` or '' . 
  so , do you know any other skill for which something comparable even exists ? 
  maybe for lifting , you do a few lifts with just the bellbar ( with no added weigths ) : any fool could do that - but if you do it right , it 's a warm-up and helps remind you of the correct form , and i guess it would also show you that your muscles are basically working normally . 
  damn , i knew * something * was wrong when i wrote it . 
  great example . 
  so ... can i click it ? 
  chocolate it is !, 
  text :, 
  welcome back to our weekly series of development diaries about europa universalis . 
  this time we 'll talk about four new features that will be part of the next expansion . 
  free cities of the holy roman empire, 
  now the emperor can designate up to seven free cities in the empire . 
  a free city is a one province minor with a minimum of 10 development . 
  free cities provide imperial authority to the emperor , as well as manpower and income . 
  a free city also have some rather nice bonuses to their development . 
  if a free city gains another province or leave the hre . 
  they lose the free city status . 
  and a free city is always a type of republic , so countries that are n't a republic will become one upon accepting free city status . 
  a free city is always protected by the emperor if attacked , so be careful when expanding in the hre . 
  a free city can never be the subject of another nation . 
  of course , as the ruler of a opm , you can always refuse the offer of becoming a free city , and the emperor can spend some imperial authority to revoke a cities rights . 
  remove electorate, 
  the next expansion lets you get even more control over your electors . 
  if your religion is now official in the empire , you can now spend ia to remove the electorate status of your disloyal electors . 
  pause westernisation, 
  sometimes while you are westernising , you end up where you need to use your power for something else , like boosting stability , but currently you ca n't . 
  now we have added the option to pause westernisation . 
  you 'll still get the unrest from westernising , but there will be no events spawning while westernisation is paused . 
  most importantly though is the fact that your power is accumulating again instead of contributing to the westernisation process . 
  retire advisor, 
  have you ever sat there with a lot of money , but cursing the options you for advisors . 
  in the next expansion , you can now spend the amount of money it would cost to hire an advisor , and permanently retire him . 
  within a month , if there is available space in your pool of advisors , you will get a random new one in the same category . 
  maybe you get the + discipline one you wanted . . 
  next week we 'll focus on luther and buddha . 
  seems like a very short update . 
  such a shame - you tried twice , but got it wrong both times . 
  it 's not piedmot , it 's not piedmond , it 's [ piedmont ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piedmont ) . 
  this sounds likely , but it might also just be a renaming ( and redefining ) of the `` rheinlaender '' culture . 
  putting the rhineland and franconia into one culture is probably more accurate ( for the period in which the game is set ) than franconia and bavaria . 
  so when they want to talk about luther , this might mean that the reformation will have special mechanics when it happens in the hre . 
  just like the revolution can happen anywhere , but has some special mechanics for france . 
  in a way , yes . 
  however , keep in mind that all humans already are 96 % potato . 
  people with downsyndrome are only two percent * more * potato than all the rest of us . 
   my girlfriend [ ... ] is single and has no priorities outside of her job . 
  i hope you only mean she 's * unmarried * . 
  if your girlfriend is single , you 're doing something wrong . 
   the real problem here is that we think women want to take up the same jobs men do . 
  sadly this is not always true,
