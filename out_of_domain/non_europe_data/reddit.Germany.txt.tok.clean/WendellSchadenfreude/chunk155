  why is this sad ? 
   today is not my day . 
  ... yet !, 
  the day is not over , so many great things can still happen . 
  i generally do n't have much respect for the fsa groups , but i 'd be extremely impressed if this is true . 
  so , does this mousa ahmed nabhan actually represent most of the `` fsa '' , does he have the authority to speak for the groups that actually have some fighters in syria ? 
  [ here are some more answers for you , from when this question was posted * yesterday * . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/33l3zi/humans_have_46_chromosomes_potatoes_have_48/ ), 
  that 's a misunderstanding . 
  the key is called `` inter '' , not `` enter '' . 
  morticians generally like to press it when they come to inter deceased people . 
  in the arab world , i would imagine it 's much easier to * denounce * israel when it comes at no real costs . 
  if you had to publicly make your statement in syria , would you still go with officially recognising israel ? 
  it sounds much safer to accuse the zionist entity of crimes against humanity . 
  your statement , either way , might not have consequences for israel , but it might have conesquences * for you * . 
  e before ei . 
  that 's not the same thing . 
  america saved france , and america went to the moon . 
  america is still around , and somewhat responsible for the things she did in the past . 
  america collectively is somewhat responsible for crimes against the native indians - but if you are personally related to general custer , that 's certainly not something that you need to hide or be ashamed of . 
  nope . 
  fire and shock in land leaders have the same chance . 
  ( except for the very rare land leaders with 6 siege . 
  those have a higher chance of shock pips for any points left . ), 
  no , it does n't . 
  20.0 is a lot better than 19.9 , but 19.9 is still better than 1 ( or 5 , or 19.8 ) . 
  at 0 tradition , you get the following pool : one dice roll ( 1-6 ) + ( 50 % chance at +1 ) . 
  at 19.9 , you get the same , plus ( 19.9 % chance at another +1 ) . 
  at 20.1 , you get the same as at 0 , plus guaranteed ( +1 ) , ( 20.1 % chance at +1 ) , ( 0.1 % chance at +1 ) . 
  ( r/germany , nicht r/de ), 
  usually should n't take more than two days . 
  maybe you just were unlucky . 
  sarrin is the last larger town between kobane and raqqa . 
  it still a long way to raqqa , but if you simply follow the euphrates / lake assad , there is nothing between sarrin and raqqa except desert and some tiny villages . 
  just so you know , you also sound like the spoiled child of rich parents , only you sound like you 're so ashamed of it that you decided to be a racist , sexist brat instead of at least working in your parents ' business . 
  the only strategy that i can imagine behind this is that the rebels are giving them more or less the kind of fight that the saa wants - out in the open , not close quarters urban combat like in aleppo or jobar . 
  this might make sense if the rebel losses are much higher in these battles than the regime losses . 
  ( * much * higher , because i think the regime has greater manpower problems than the opposition at the moment . ), 
  does n't look like it at the moment , but those numbers are hard to get unless you have very reliable sources at the front . 
  i thought nusra and ahrar are so close that nusra is effectively part of this as well . 
  that works ? 
  i thought starting a separate war against poland would auto-decline this call for aid . 
  probably still worth it , but i would have expected a 25 prestige hit . 
  do you have any numbers on this ? 
  because i believe germany * still * has the highest carbon dioxide emissions in the eu even per capita , at least of any of the larger countries . 
  but any numbers i can find are old , incomplete , or confusing . 
  ( per gdp is a different story yet . ), 
  it is bad to worry about it * ineffectively * . 
  this method probably is quite ineffective . 
  has enough potential for further research , but that 's about it . 
  [ would n't have been much different from what germany actually did during the war . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coal_liquefaction#indirect_conversion_processes ) - coal liquefaction to generate gasoline from coal . 
  thanks . 
  i love gapminder . 
  so , in short : in the eu , only belgium and the netherlands have higher per capita emissions than germany . 
  per gdp : this is too complicated for me . 
  i think germany is doing ok , as are all other eu member states . 
  love your writing style . 
   her : you could n't have slept on the couch ? 
  that would have been the respectful thing to do . 
  at this point , you should simply have been honest with her : `` i could have done that , but i wanted to have sex with your son . '', 
  - would have loved to read about her reaction to that . 
  what to do : be * very * clear about not wanting to meet him again . 
  fuck being polite . 
  it 's not that things were simply moving a bit too fast for you , it 's that you wanted something else entirely and have no interest in ever going on a second date . 
  tell him that , it 's kinder than the `` polite '' alternative . 
  and have him give your best regards to his mother . 
   she complained that in the 86 positive reviews it was never mentioned that he suddenly did n't have a couch . 
  so ... it would have been a good gesture to write a review detailing her experiences , so the next people who look him up in london can make an informed decision of whether to go there or not . 
  this pissed me off to no end . 
  if somebody offers you a couch and then does n't actually have a couch , that 's a negative review . 
  neutral if you 're feeling generous . 
  if somebody offers you a couch , but then * claims * not to have one and offers to `` host '' you in their own bed instead , that 's a negative review and a [ report to the couchsurfing team ] ( https://support.couchsurfing.org/hc/en-us/requests/new?category=safety ) .

  you can put the commas there . 
  you can * not * put the `` es '' there . 
  syrian arab army . 
  so just that i understand the video correctly : it shows the saa leaving the city of idlib , not the evacuation of the salient south of idlib ? 
  ( ariha etc. ), 
  very interesting analysis . 
  there are plenty of virgins in college , and there 's * no way * for anybody else to know if you 've had sex . 
  some of the hottest , most confident people around you may be virgins , while that slightly awkward kid might have been a regular in their town 's swinger scene before going to college . 
  it does n't always show . 
  an averge penis compared to a porn star 's penis looks somewhat like average hands look compared to a heavyweight boxer 's hands . 
  1 ) yes , that 's what condoms are there for . 
  if you use it properly ( pulled all the way down the shaft ) , there 's hardly any risk of `` leakage '' . 
  - make shure to extract within a minute or so after the dead is done . 
  - i recommend using a condom all by yourself once or twice to practice . 
  2 ) as you like it . 
  you 're not `` supposed to '' , but you can . 
  it might help you to last longer if the actual sex is `` round two '' for you . 
  3 ) relax . 
  maybe it will feel great , maybe it wo n't . 
  either way , life goes on , and you have hundreds of times to get it right . 
  it stays out .

  just to confirm what the others have said : yes , it should . 
  you should go see a doctor about this . 
  you probably will feel embarassed about this no matter how many people tell you that you should n't , but anyhow : you should n't feel embarassed about this at all .
