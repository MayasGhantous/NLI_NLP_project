  all legal concerns aside , this is * certainly * true for a legitimate child that has the support of house frey . 
  ( for now , that is . 
  the ruins that will be left of house frey in just a few years wo n't matter much any more . ), 
  [ does anyone know who the guy in the picture is ?

  france breaks or waits out the truce , easily occupies all english lands on the continent , waits for high warscore , takes provinces in england in the peace treaty . 
  england breaks or waits out the truce , easily occupies all french provinces on the british isles , waits for high warscore , takes provinces in the french mainland in the peace treaty . 
  this goes back and forth for a while . 
  england and france switch places . 
   is n't the ` return province ' feature already in the game ? 
  like as scotland if i beat up england i can already make england give calais , etc. 
  to france , right ? 
  this is n't part of a peace treaty any more . 
  it simply a decision to hand some land back to its rightful owner - most likely because your ae is dangerously high and you want to avoid huge coalitions . 
  just for the record : this is a news headline , but it 's not a recent one . 
  the story happened years ago . 
  [ example from 2013 , not sure if that 's really when it happened .

  in 50 years , we wo n't have to separate our trash manually any more . 
  this is a job that machines are much better at anyway . 
  we might still have two bins - one for stuff that is moist and yucky , and one for everything else . 
  damn , i simply ca n't read that sentence at a higher speed than the one he sang it in . 
  they are probably afraid of normal anti-personnel mines . 
  walking in single file minimizes their risk of stepping on one of those , and ensures that only the first guy would get hit . 
  against these manually triggered ( ? ), 
  rows of mines , walking in single file is obviously a very bad choice . 
  how do we know that ? 
  all dating methods that i understand would n't really help to answer this . 
  e.g. , the atoms that make up the moon would have the same age as those that form the earth , so radionuclides should n't tell you much . 
  it has a tropical climate , and the weather is never * that * nice in germany . 
  but why do the isotope ratios tell us anything about the age of the moon ? 
  for a chunk of rock , the same amount of time has passed since the formation of the solar system , no matter if it spent that time on earth , or on theia , or on the moon . 
  even a collision of two planets would not influence elemental compositions ; tht 's why i do n't understand how isotope dating helps us at all in this case . 
  great , thanks for the explanation . 
   does anyone dispute that co2 emissions are pollution ? 
  yes , [ that kind of moron actually exists . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sgkvdndjna ), 
  and you 're not telling us any either . 
   the amount it generates is 70kwh/year, 
  per square meter . 
  it 's 70 meters long , and has an area of ~ 100 square meters . 
  so it generates ~ 10.000 $ worth of electricity per year . 
  still ridiculous at best . 
  i agree with all this . 
  putting solar panels over all roads is an absurd idea , and plenty of reasons for this are obvious to anyone who cares . 
  and yet , it 's * still * a better idea than turning the roads * into * solar panels . 
  just to be sure you know this : the next patch will not be compatible with old saves . 
  you will not get the new fort mechanics in your current game . 
  when the new patch rolls out , you can either finish your game with the old version ( run as a mod in steam ) , or start a new game with the new version . 
  no reason to hurry . 
  these references blend well . 
   nigeria - people 's democratic party ( goodluck jonathan ), 
  [ you missed something ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nigerian_general_election,_2015 ), 
  jonathan and his party lost the election in february to the [ all progressives congress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all_progressives_congress ) . 
  i 'm not sure if our labels really apply to these parties that well , but if you label them , the apc would be centre - * left * . 
   the news of important regime people being there only adds to the fire . 
  this is the first i hear about this - who 's ( said to be ) in there ? 
  maybe this [ ylvis video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paenaoyduuo ) can make you accept dubstep a little more . 
  i guess [ this xkcd does n't count as relevant ] ( https://xkcd.com/843/ ) , because it 's probably where you got the idea in the first place . 
  ( otherwise , it 's a / retiredxkcd . ), 
  just checking : all blanks should be `` the company '' , except for the very first one and the one in ( d ) who receives the $ 30,000 - correct ? 
  solid advice . 
   while they are scanning , and they are fast , begin bagging yourself . 
  to be safe , since you 're probably not fast enough the first few times : do n't bag your stuff at the register , just put it back in the cart . 
  bag later . 
  definitely do this at aldi . 
  i do n't like bce/ce , if only for the sound of it . 
  the `` beeee '' is often overemphasized just so that you can actually hear the difference , while there always is a clearly audible difference between ad and bc . 
  i like [ lindybeige 's suggestion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unaq2x_zqc4 ) : keep using bc and ad , but simply re-define them to mean `` backwards chronology '' ( because you are counting backwards , with year 10 coming before year 9 etc. ), 
  and `` ascending dates '' . 
  that title alone is enough middle-eastern conspiracy bullshit for the week for me . 
  it 's sad that so many people in this region of the world use this kind of crazyness as an explanation for * everything * . 
  just as a sidenote to show that the author has no idea what he 's talking about : the caption claims that this picture shows [ `` isis rebels in syria reveal their favorite banner honoring allah -- satan with a snake/alien hatching out of his chest . 
  ] ( http://donclasen.com/wp-content/uploads/isis-aliens-320x213-300x199.jpg ) they wear masks lest the world see that many are not even from the middle east . 
  and oh , they can write in english too . '', 
  - but it even * says * in the picture that they are from [ kafranbel ] ( http://www.occupiedkafranbel.com/ ) , which is not in isis territory . 
  you would n't ever do that in german . 
  i ca n't think of a construction using the passive voice that sounds even halfway realistic . 
  edit : for some aspect of * to get in trouble * , you might use `` ich werde bestraft werden . '', 
  the only strategic point i can see is that clearing out the area completely would set free most of the troops there to be used elsewhere . 
  they ca n't leave while jan/isis are still hiding in the mountains in significant numbers . 
  i 'm not sure if you are even serious , but just in case : of course the hre had emperors in that period . 
  charles v , ferdinand i , maximilian ii , and rudolf ii . 
  these treaties only prove that the hre in the early 16th century was not strong enough compared to the ottoman empire to force them to recognize their ruler as an emperor , while it * was * strong enough to do just that by the early 17th century . 
  but being recognized as such by the ottomans is n't the one defining characteristic of an emperor . 
  the hre did not have a real ruler ( neither emperor nor king ) from 1254 to 1273 , during the [ interregnum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_roman_empire#interregnum ) . 
  it 's complicated . 
  the rulers of the hre called themselves kings ( rex romanorum - king of the romans ) for a while ( roughly 1000-1500 ) , at least until they managed to go to rome and get the pope to crown them as emperor . 
  many of them never managed to do that , so they only were kings - but the title was also sometimes used for the designated heir of a ruling emperor . 
  later on , the rulers of the hre officially called themselves `` romanorum imperator , germaniae rex '' - * emperor of the romans , king in * ( or * of * ) * germany * '' , and the pope no longer had a say in this . 
  [ talk to the map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/empire-roman-emperor-charles-v.jpg ) , cause charles v is not listening . 
  you should n't be able to do that , because that 's not how feudalism worked . 
  also , you should n't start questions with `` am i the only one who ... '' . 
  lighting a candle ( or even just a match ) covers up bad smells pretty well . 
  american toilets apparently do that all the time . 
   if you do n't know the people very well it is not a good idea to bring alcohol as a present . 
  some form of alcohol ( most likely wine ) would be my go-to present for people i do n't know well .
