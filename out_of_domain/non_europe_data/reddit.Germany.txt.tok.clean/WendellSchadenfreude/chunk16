  as a side-note , you did n't even specify his faith - we 're all just assuming christianity ... 
  i think you might do best by de-escalating . 
  just tell him that you 're not mocking his religion , so he might want to stop making fun of your atheism . 
  - the alternative is , of course , to * start * mocking his religion , but the former method is by far the more mature think to do . 
  as long as you do n't write `` athiest '' , i 'm happy . 
  it feels like some people here are trying to make you feel bad about yourself - i do n't get that . 
  calling yourself an agnostic deist is perfectly acceptable and seems to fit your beliefs . 
  i 'm curious if this label will actually protect you from social stigma and `` excommunication '' - have you already used it in real life ? 
  the difference between agnostic deists and agnostic atheists is so small , it makes no difference for any practical questions . 
  if one label is socially preferable to you , by all means : use that one . 
  as a side-note , comparing our beliefs : i do n't feel the need for a `` prime mover '' - before the big bang , even time did n't exist yet , so there 's no need to ask about what was `` before that '' . 
  i have no problem with you naming the `` cause of the big bang '' `` god '' , i just do n't feel this cause is necessary . 
  after all , you 're still claiming `` god '' existed without anything causing him - i just believe the same thing about the universe . 
  would all of you please take a second to think about the fact that the person you are talking to and all their friends and loved ones are going to die within a few hundred years ? 
  after that , i hope you 'll feel more like treating each other nicely . 
  [ sorry if i sound patronizing or condescending . 
  i just really do n't see a reason for strife between you . ], 
  the definition of god as the first cause or prime mover is by no means something that c0ntrarian simply made up , it goes back to [ aristotle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_cause ) . 
  [ edit : i should have been more clear here . 
  aristotle , afaik , did n't call this `` first mover '' god . 
  but he thought that it must exist . ], 
  sure , most people who embrace this argument also claim to know more about this `` prime mover '' . 
  but there have been lots of people who believed in the existence of a god because `` there must be something that caused everything else '' . 
  ( i find that very unconvincing . ), 
  i do n't even think opening the ( remains of the ) kitten will be necessary - unpacking it should suffice . 
  do n't worry - if anyone did , [ erwin schr\u00f6dinger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schr%c3%b6dinger%27s_cat ) will show up around new year 's to claim the poor animal . 
  welcome to [ ignosticism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignosticism ) !, 
  i 'm not sure if you 're actually doing this , but i think claiming that the only concept to be called `` god '' should be `` all-knowing , loving magic sky-fairy '' is overly restrictive . 
  i agree with you that the belief in a god who only started the universe but never influenced it after that and had no real `` plan '' for it is not much of a belief at all , i.e. 
  it does n't have any consequences . 
  but believes of that kind are my favorite ones !, 
  ( at least , they do n't harm anyone . ), 
  maybe we should start calling them `` crusaders '' . 
  [ i think `` jihad '' and `` crusade '' are basically the same word , they only have opposing connotations both in the west and in islamic countries . ], 
   to them it means what jihadist is to us . 
  exactly , that 's the point - make them hear what we want to say , even if it sounds strange to us . 
   well crusades is literally an armed struggle , while jihad could be one , but is n't necessarily so . 
  i disagree , the words are the same in this respect , too . 
  [ a crusade can be an internal struggle , too . 
  and the folks we call `` jihadists '' certainly are n't only struggling internally . 
  metaphorical or not , the argument stands :, 
  when americans say that someone is `` on a crusade '' , they usually mean this person is doing a good thing . 
  people agree with the goals of the `` crusader '' , even though they might find him a little too enthusiastic . 
  a `` jihadist '' , on the other hand , is , to american ears , an evil , brutal man who attacks innocents in the name of his religion . 
  when , say , palestinians say that someone is `` fighting a jihad '' , they also mean this as a good thing . 
  a `` crusader '' , on the other hand , is , to palestinian ears , an evil , brutal man who attacks innocents in the name of his religion . 
  if we could get most muslims to think of terrorists not as jihadists , but as crusaders , the `` war on terror '' would be won for good . 
  boring read , kind of pointless . 
  btw , herschel would n't enjoy much modern-day intellectual respectability , either . 
  more than some `` bronze age goat herder '' , sure - but he was still wrong about almost everything . 
  ignoring everything i said to focus on this one arguably inappropriate name * that i did n't make up * and only used in quotation marks makes it seem like you 're not really interested in this discussion . 
  let me rephrase it for you : if we could get most muslims to think of terrorists not as jihadists , but as crusaders , al-qaeda would lose a lot of support . 
  nicely put indeed . 
   king james version ( kjv ),

  `` without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor , it is impossible to create a parody of fundamentalism that someone wo n't mistake for the real thing . '', 
  i 'm still not sure if i 'm falling for this one right here . 
  this * is * genuine fox material , right ? 
  satire , of course , but made by fox ?

  * stadt * means city . 
  * staat * means state/nation/country . 
  the plural of * land * should be * l\u00e4nder * ( or * laender * , if you want to avoid the \u00e4 ) . 
  alternatively , you can call them * states * . 
  three of the l\u00e4nder ( * not * the city-states ) do describe themselves as `` free states '' ( * freistaat * ) , although this has no political consequences . 
   if you tell someone you are from idaho , or wisconsin they will just look at you with a puzzled look and ask you *** what/who *** that is .

  well phrased . 
  i ca n't really tell you much about the bible , i 've only ever read small parts of it . 
  but that 's more than i 've read of any other `` holy book '' - there 's no reason to believe that there 's more truth in the bible than in , say , the upanishads . 
  ( which i also have n't read . ), 
  in any case : do n't rush things , take your time . 
  i do , of course , hope that you will be an atheist at some point . 
  but it really does n't matter wether this is in a week , a year or a decade . 
  try not to alienate your friends and family ( too much ) . 
  what kind of things ? 
  [ necessary dislaimer : being an atheist only means you have no belief in the existence of any god . 
  you might still do stupid things and believe in all kinds of superstitions or fairytales . ], 
  for most questions , the religious answer really does n't explain anything . 
  best example : creationism . 
  for some questions ( life after death , meaning of life ... ) , `` our '' answers are n't really based on facts , either - but at least we do n't claim that they are . 
  `` does anyone remember '' ?

  that 's true , but the stars are still seen on the background of a dark sky . 
  the question the video answers is why there are any dark spaces between the stars . 
  if the universe was infinite and unchanging ( on a large scale - i.e. 
  stars as the ones we see today were already there hundreds of billions of years ago , and were n't moving around so much ) , every line of sight in every direction would end at a star . 
  thus , the sky would be as bright as the sun everywhere , both at `` day '' and at `` night '' . 
  i think people are n't reacting to this because most of us hardly know anything about sikhism . 
  i 'd be mostly interested , for a start , if you call yourself sikh because your parents are and maybe you celebrate some religious holidays/events/rituals ; or if you hold any believes about the world that are based on your religion . 
  ( i just googled a little about sikhism . 
  the values it has sound nice enough . 
  all i could think of was that you either have a blank in `` gasoline '' , or you used terrible [ kerning ] ( http://xkcd.com/1015/ ) . 
  if you color code the people in a conversation , it 's easier to read .
