  for instance , an economist might be twice as expensive in britain as in india , while a call center agent would be five times as expensive in britain as in india . 
  in this case , as long as britain and india do n't use the same currency , it 's best for britain to specialize in economists and for india to specialize in call center agents . 
  this is [ based on a famous economic model ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage#ricardo.27s_example ) by the british economist ( ha ! ), 
  david ricardo . 
  to be fair , most people have a huge trade surplus with their employer , selling him labor every day and rarely buying anything from him in return . 
  for most people , this one surplus balances out all of their deficits . 
  confusing a fake candidate with an actual candidate to me seems less stupid than having an opinion on a nonexisting candidate . 
  great comment . 
   no , i would n't take my legs back ( even in their healthy state ) instead of twenty million dollars . 
  so , since you 've given this a lot of thought : would you rather take $ 20 million , or $ 10 million and * one * of your legs back ? 
  [ the wikipedia article is a great read . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hand_transplantation ), 
  hand transplantations are rare , but have been done successfully since 1999 , with less successful attempts in 1998 and 1964 . 
  i do n't have more information , but i assume the one in 1964 failed quite badly . 
  so then they realized that they needed a lot of progress in immunosuppressive drugs before they would risk another attempt at a huge operation to cure a non-lifethreatening condition at the cost of big long-term side effects . 
  the one in 1998 seems to have failed mostly due to a lack of patient cooperation , so the operation showed that the medicinal technology was available now . 
   i 've also heard that native esperanto speakers use irregular verbs even though their parents do n't, 
  so these native speakers are missing the entire point of their language !? 
  damn esperanto speakers - they ruined esperanto !, 
  oh yes , that 's so annoying . 
  there 's so much stuff that pregnant women are n't supposed to eat or do , and i bet most of it would be just fine ( in moderation ) .

  i hate knowing that this rant will from now on be linked to every time this little factoid is posted ; as if it were a good answer . 
  tl ; dr : ** yes ** , oxford university * is * older than the aztec empire . 
  the take-away messages is simply that oxford is * old * , while the `` aztec empire '' was still relatively new when the spaniards arrived . 
  this does n't imply that there was nothing of importance * before * the aztecs . 
  the comparison that rabbits uses but completely garbles is that oxford is also older than the german empire ( of 1871 ) , but clearly * not * older than german civilization . 
  of course this simple juxtaposition of oxford and `` the aztecs '' is only interesting and surprising to people who know little of meso-american history - but guess what , that 's easily 99 % of the people on reddit . 
  ( edit : come to think of it : i bet every time this is reposted , a huge number of people are surprised simply be the fact that oxford is * so * old . 
  so you might be an expert on meso-american history and still be surprised , still learn something new , still have a good starting point for some further reading . ), 
  for those people , the repost makes them smarter , if only a tiny bit , and it 's a good starting point that makes you want to research the history of oxford and of meso-american states .

   to oversimplify it , not everyone in society is on minimum wage , so a large majority of people 's wage will not be affected by the changes . 
  i think numbers will do this thread good , so here are some :, 
  [ `` in 2013 , 75.9 million workers [ ... ] in the, 
  united states were paid at hourly rates , representing, 
  58.8 percent of all wage and salary workers . 
  among, 
  those paid by the hour , 1.5 million earned exactly the, 
  prevailing federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour . 
  about 1.8 million had wages below the federal minimum . 
  together , these 3.3 million workers with wages at or, 
  below the federal minimum made up 4.3 percent of all, 
  hourly paid workers . 
  '' ] ( http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2013.pdf ) ( bureau of labor statistics ), 
  although if the new minimum wage was $ 15/h , that percentage would vastly increase . 
   being that a living wage/minimum wage never kept up with inflation, 
  [ i think it 's kept up pretty well , actually . 
  ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2014/09/ft_14.09.08_minimumwage.png ) the yellow line , minimum wage adjusted for inflation , has mostly been between 6 and 8 dollars per hour since the late 1950 's . 
  the highest spike , in the late 60 's , brought it up to some $ 8.50 or so . 
  so increaseing the minimum wage to $ 9/h would already bring it to an all-time high . 
  15 bucks per hour would be a completely new paradigm , for good or bad . 
  i agree with this in general , but it 's a bit of a different question . 
  wages should mostly keep up with productivity rather than inflation , because it means that the workers ' share of the value they produce remains constant . 
  but the minimum wage is a special case . 
  i think it makes more sense to couple this ( psychologically ) to inflation than to productivity . 
  if society decides that `` paying * anyone * less than x is immoral '' , then the value of x should correspond to the cost of living , i.e. 
  to inflation . 
  * sigh * . 
  `` the american takfiri zionist project '' . 
  as far as i know , nasrallah is a pragmatic moderate by the standards of the region .

  - country is protestant,

   the cause of colony collapse is no longer a mystery :, 
  indeed . 
  it 's varoa destructor , a parasitic mite . 
  or more honestly : we do * not * know what causes ccd . 
  restricting the use of neonictotinoids * might * be a good idea , or it might not . 
  it would n't mean that farmers simply give up using pesticides altogether , and their alternatives have some problems of their own . 
  first , we calm down . 
  we then try to find out how big of a problem we are actually facing . 
  ask [ the epa for instance ] ( http://www2.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder ) :, 
   once thought to pose a major long term threat to bees , reported cases of ccd have declined substantially over the last five years . 
  the number of hives that do not survive over the winter months -- the overall indicator for bee health -- has maintained an average of about 30.5 percent since 2008 . 
  while winter losses remain relatively high , the number of those losses attributed to ccd has dropped from roughly 60 percent of total hives lost in 2008 to 31.1 percent in 2013 . 
  that sounds like something that beekeepers should still be somewhat concerned about . 
  scientists should still try to figure out what is actually happening . 
  but for us , the general public , step three is clear : stop being so dramatic . 
  stop mis-quoting einstein .

  i 'm not sure if i 'm more knowledgable on this subject - i 'm european , so there are probably some basic things that i do n't get , but i make a somewhat neutral outside observer .

  10 bucks an hour is $ 1600 per month .
