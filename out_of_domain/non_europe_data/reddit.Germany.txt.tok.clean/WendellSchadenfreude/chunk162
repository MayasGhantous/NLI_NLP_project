  they do n't simply copy german laws , they first have to cutify the language .

  i guess it shows op 's daughter . 
   in my area i see pregnant girls , yes girls , 14-18 years old drinking fake coke ( its worse than the real stuff ) and eating cheap chips full of all sorts of shitty stuff . 
  i 'm sure you 're right that these are n't great mothers , but we ca n't know that from what you 're telling us about them . 
  pregnant women can eat chips and drink coke and have no reason to feel bad about it . 
  as long as they also eat some healthy food , there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  it 's not comparable to feeding a baby chips + coke . 
  how much of the trade do you control in constantinople and how much in aleppo ? 
  ( e.g. 
  if you control most of aleppo due to buildings already but do n't control most of constantinople , ships will help you * far more * in constantinople . ), 
  screenshots might help . 
  where , and for which group ? 
  coke contains only some 80 mg of caffeine per liter . 
  if you get 200 mg of caffeine from coke , you 're likely not drinking anything but coke - and sure , * that 's * unhealthy . 
  i do n't think we 're doing anyone a favor if we try to make women feel guilty for drinking coke during pregnancy . 
  it 's coke , not vodka . 
  having a coke during pregnancy every once in a while is absolutely fine . 
  feeding your newborn coke instead of milk is not . 
   raise the minimum wage . 
  i 'm fairly certain that does n't qualify as * socially * liberal .

  maybe you can turn it to your advantage that your town has so many different churches . 
  visit one of them for a few weeks , then another , then a third . 
  it will look like you 're just searching for the right church for yourself . 
  so you 'd definitely be making an effort , and being `` searching '' or `` uncertain '' is definitely looked upon more kindly than being an evil baby-eating atheist . 
  maybe there even * is * a church that makes you feel better . 
  if there 's a [ unitarian church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unitarian_universalism ) , try that one - i hear half of them are actually atheists .

  hang in there . 
  do n't self-harm , that wo n't make anything better . 
  go running instead when you feel overwhelmed by emotions - it will clear your head and heart , and it 's also a way to `` destroy yourself '' - but in a productive way .

  pro tip : the url in imgur does n't tell you the actual file type . 
   like you said , the muslims also pay a similar tax, 
  if they are all that similar , why would you want to have different rules and taxes at all ? 
  why not just say that all people pay the same kind of taxes and have to follow the same kind of laws , regardless of their beliefs ? 
  well , that was my question : if what you say is true , yet you know that the difference upsets many people , why would n't you simply get rid of the minor , unimportant difference altogether and say that all people pay the same kind of taxes , no matter what religion they belong to ? 
  have to follow it , * and * make other people follow it . 
  good luck , and thanks for posting this instead of simply disappearing . 
  do n't forget in your studies that there is a whole world around you that is much bigger than islam .

  i do n't understand why this is n't absolute standard for every webcam . 
  all users want to be able to turn their cameras off reliably . 
  i 'm not sure they 'll even try to take the city , unless isis evacuates . 
  they do n't need the city , they only want to cut the line from the turkish border to raqqa . 
  the border crossing itself would be nice , but it 's not all that important . 
  if you do n't answer the call , you * are * staying neutral . 
  of course that means losing one of your alliances - but that just means your former allies also `` stay neutral '' when you need them next time . 
  you can actually see the difference between black and white pieces in some cases . 
  i think it 's most notable for the pawn on the e-line . 
  the white pawn hardly ever advances by just one square : e2-e4 is much more common than e2-e3 . 
  for the black e-pawn , moving by just one square is also very common , i guess mostly because of the popular [ french defence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_defence ) . 
  from the looks of it , e7-e6 might actually happen more often than e7-e5 . 
  4 weeks instead of 2 years . 
  aleppo is less than 50 kilometers away . 
  but i do n't think he 's talking about the government moving north . 
  the rebels will have to send some forces from aleppo to the azaz front . 
  this might allow the regime to go back on the offensive in aleppo at some point .
