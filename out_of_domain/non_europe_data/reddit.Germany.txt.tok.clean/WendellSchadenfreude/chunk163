  right next to the eschatologically important village of [ dabiq ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dabiq ) . 
  will be interesting to see if the rebels also try to take dabiq as well , and how hard isis will try to defend it . 
  even on the [ disambiguation page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_%28disambiguation%29 ) , the 20th century bc is n't even listed as a possible meaning of `` 20th century '' . 
  this is interesting and i 'd love for more of reddit 's yorubas to chime in . 
  for all those who , like me , have no idea what this is all about , i went on wikipedia for a few minutes . 
  [ the book called odu ifa seems to exist . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/if%c3%a1#od.c3.b9_if.c3.a1 ), 
  a city called [ ile-ife ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ife ) also exists . 
  in the mythology of the yoruba , it 's the oldest city in the world , founded by a god during the creation of the world . 
  wikipedia does n't mention the non-mythological history of the city before the 12th century . 
  about the history of the yoruba people in general , / u/oer6000 and / u/virtuallyalive both seem to be right in their own way . 
  there is no documented history before the 15th century , when the oyo empire ruled what today is western nigeria . 
  but their ancestors had probably been living in the same area already since the first millenium bc , and slowly developed into the yoruba there , with not major migrations . 
  i 'm sure there is a lot wrong with this overview - as i said : it 's the ten-minutes-on-wikipedia version . 
  just wanted to make sure neither of these two users was completely trolling us . 
  true . 
  but if you 're anywhere near a normal user , you 'll never download that much . 
  you have to do so three months in a row before they limit your speed . 
  so if you 're actually above the limit twice , you can still simply cancel your contract before the limit ever affects you . 
  i support that notion . 
  but in my opinion , 24 month contracts are a worse business practice than soft 300 gb download limits . 
  so o2 is still better than almost everybody else . 
  if he pulls out of aleppo , assad has to leave the country or lose his life to a coup immediately . 
  isis and the rebels * are * already clashing north of aleppo . 
  would like a good map of the region , but this one is pretty much useless . 
  what * is * the intended message ? 
  he does n't missunderstand , he just asks a different question . 
  another user * did * recommend talking to hr . 
   talk to hr ? 
  they might be able to find you an alternative placement within the company . 
  it sounds like your manager would understand your desire to change teams . 
  that does n't seem like the dumbest suggestion . 
  sure , op does n't even acknowledge the suggestion that he should talk to his college - but there really is no reason to act like he 's the only one communicating poorly in that thread . 
  either way : i have no idea how this can possibly be considered bestof . 
   germany 's team is just recently good . 
  spain 's teams have been historically good . 
  i can only assume you 're kidding . 
  [ germany won 1st place in the world chamionship four times , 2nd place four times , 3rd place four times . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifa_world_cup#teams_reaching_the_top_four ) spain won once . 
  spain certainly also had good teams historically , but claiming that germany did n't is just silly . 
  but of course : in 7 years , either of the two countries might be dominant , or neither of them . 
   we are already one of the most densely populated countries . 
  germany 's not * that * densely populated . 
  [ it 's less dense than ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density ) the uk , belgium , india , the netherlands , israel , lebanon , south korea and a whole bunch of other countries . 
  automation or not : germany is shrinking so quickly that we will have very few young people for every old person in a couple of decades . 
  60 years ago was 1955 . 
  [ huge excess of births over deaths in germany ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/bevoelkerungsentwicklung_deutschland.png ) , beginning of the baby boomer years ( in germany - in the us , the boomer years already started in the 40s ) . 
  there 's always people in germany moaning that these numbers are fudged and do n't mean anything - these people are idiots . 
  these numbers * are * very good . 
  they are somewhat beautified , but they have * always * been , and the extent to which they are has not increased . 
  the german numbers look awesome in statistics gathered by international organizations as well . 
  yes , you need a picture . 
  [ here are some nice examples . 
  ] ( http://www.jobscout24.ch/de/jobratgeber/download-muster-lebenslauf-a4017/ ), 
  maybe [ use this one ] ( http://www.jobscout24.ch/download/vorlagen/lebenslauf_marketing.pdf ) as a model . 
  looking at india , i was certain this had to be a mistake , but it 's true according to wikipedia : india , the birthplace of buddhism , has fewer buddhists than christians , muslims , or atheists . 
   life starts at contraception, 
  i love this typo . 
  they should form 5 commonwealthes . 
  you might want to include that list of recent events in your next map . 
  there 's one mapmaker who does that , and it 's a pretty useful feature . 
  other than that and the labels for towns ( that you already mentioned ) , maybe you should add a symbol or an extra color for fronts that are actually seeing ( heavy ) fighting at the moment . 
  all in all : very nice work . 
  why would you post a photo of a book that mentions the webcomic [ instead of posting a link to the actual comic ? 
  it also includes an additional science tip : `` log scales are for quitters who ca n't find enough paper to make their point * properly * . '', 
  - and do n't forget looking at the mouse-over text . 
  it says right above the picture : `` as a certain webcomic put it '' . 
  your country being ** gibraltar ** ? 
  ... you do n't say ... 
   8 $ are really not that much . 
   i 'm really poor, 
  you do n't even know what `` poor '' means . 
  not even `` poor by german standards '' . 
  because you told us about yourself . 
  that should be [ coups d'\u00e9tat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) . 
  coup d'\u00e9tats sounds also acceptable to me . 
  or even coups d'\u00e9tats , since we 're talking about several `` blows '' * and * several states . 
  drop the acc\u00e9\u00e9nt online if you feel like it . 
  use * putsch * ( plural : putsches ) or * overthrow * instead to make your life easier . 
  it 's a great book . 
  quick read , also , you can finish it within a day or two . 
  if you know nothing about india and buddhism but suspect that it might be interesting to you , i 'd urge you to give it a try . 
  also , the book itself is * not * pretentious at all . 
  it 's really a great story about buddhism and enlightenment . 
  the book itself is not pretentious , it 's a nice , short read , and [ available online for free . 
  ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2500 ) - you should check it out !, 
  what books is he reading ? 
  the last payment for the reparations , depending on what you count , [ happened either in 1983 or in 2010 . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20100929/30145 ) anybody saying that they should have been higher is effectively saying that germany should still be paying today . 
  which ones ? 
  if you 're talking about the treaties that the german allies got , i agree . 
  but that 's not really `` precedent '' . 
  who else thinks that this demand is ridiculous when you ca n't have played more than a few * hours * with the new patch ? 
  fairly certain they normalized `` assists per goal '' . 
  di maria had 8 assists with only 3 goals , while sanchez had 13 goals with 7 assists . 
  8/3 / 7/13 = ** 4.95 ** - almost five , so di maria had 5 times as many `` assist per goal '' . 
  not that this statistic makes any sense . 
  but i thought it might still be important for you after 3 months ... 
  wonderful map .
