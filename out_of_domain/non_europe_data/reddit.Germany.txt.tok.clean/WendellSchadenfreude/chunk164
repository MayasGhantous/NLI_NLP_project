  i love how you implemented the contested areas . 
  if i had to change anything , i think i 'd make important roads a bit more prominent , and include some special marking for the border crossing . 
  ( it 's important , and not everybody knows where it is . ), 
  source for your numbers ? 
  i do n't really doubt them . 
  i just think they might still make germany look worse than it actually is , because 60 % of the median income is n't usually used to define relative poverty - only * armutsgef\u00e4hrdet * ( `` at risk of ( relative ) poverty '' ) . 
  relative poverty in most statistics starts below 40 % of the median income . 
  all . 
  i really do n't like that first thought experiment . 
  when you are in a position where you want to buy a computer as cheaply as possible , saving another 50 bucks is a good idea . 
  but when you 're already willing to spend 1,000 dollars on a luxury item ( which your 1k computer probably is ) , you * should n't * care much about 50 bucks any more - if you do , you probably should n't be spending the 1k in the first place . 
  if you want to buy a new sports car for 100,000 dollars and you could save 50 bucks by going to a different dealer , that 's still 50 bucks - but if you * care * about that amount of money , you definitely should n't be buying a car like that in the first place . 
   i sometimes get really angry when i think about what it has cost me and what it will cost me once i tell my ultra religious parents . 
  being queer , black and an atheist, 
  since i did n't see anybody else in this thread telling you this , i 'll give you the usual r/atheist warning :, 
  do not come out to your parents as long as you depend on them !, 
  if they overreact and kick you out while you have no job , no money , and no place of your own , you 're gon na have a really bad time . 
  see the faq for a longer explanation . 
  `` the best place to come out to your parents is at a home you own , over a dinner that you paid for yourself '' . 
   secular slurs, 
  i think you mean `` sectarian '' . 
  `` i will fuck your god '' is not a very secular thing to say . 
  since i do n't want to watch this video and you said `` shabiha '' , i have to ask : were these guys regular saa , or some paramilitary group/militia ? 
  just out of curiosity : `` transnistrian '' literally means `` on the other side of the dniester '' . 
  does `` pridnestrovian '' also mean `` on the other side ... '' , or is it `` on * this * side ... '' ? 
  can you back that fun fact up somehow ? 
  because wikipedia disagrees :, 
   [ neanderthals made advanced tools , probably had a language ( the nature of which is debated and likely unknowable ) and lived in complex social groups . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neanderthal#behavior ), 
  the german wikipedia goes into a little more detail and explains that the neanderthal hyoid bone was similar to ours and that they had the same [ foxp2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foxp2 ) gene ( which is believed to play an important role in the ability to speak ) . 
  [ zwiebelfisch had an article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/zwiebelfisch-bratskartoffeln-und-spiegelsei-a-293186.html ) about this , and a [ good overview over common cases . 
  tl ; dr : you do n't know . 
  there really is no rule , you just go with what sounds better . 
  and what sounds better sometimes depends on wether or not you work for the government . 
  the most important case , by the way , is `` verfassungsgebend '' - anyone who drops the - s - is a traitor !, 
  edit : on second thought , the most important case is actually * schadenfreude * . 
  no - s - in there . 
  [ same joke made by somebody else 8 hours earlier . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/39jon2/we_need_to_ensure_the_quality_of_slave_manufacture/ ), 
   if you ask me out on a date , i 'll assume you 'll be paying for it . 
  so , has this ever actually happened to you ? 
  this is n't a rhetorical question , i 'm genuinely interested : has a girl ever asked you out on a date and then paid the bill at some restaurant ? 
  ( just treating you to one beer or something does n't count . ), 
  call the waiter , tell them you 're paying separately . 
  done . 
  wow . 
  there really is n't much left between the two kurdish cantons now . 
  i expect them to link up ( and thus interrupt the road from raqqa to tal abyad ) within the next week . 
  i do n't think gir\u00ea will fall that quickly . 
  but the road can be cut anywhere , that 's far more important than the border crossing itself . 
   i do n't remember any other time in history where a light infantry guerrilla force used dense air support to make swift advances, 
  the northern alliance in afghanistan . 
  they had been a marginalized militia in a remote region of their country . 
  when the frontline bombardments started , it took them less than two weeks ( [ november 2nd - november 12th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_invasion_of_afghanistan#initial_air_strikes ) ) to reach and take the capital . 
  it 's been mentioned before that the ypg is the faction in this war that least depends on heavy weaponry . 
  they are primarily a light infantery force - and since the us airforce has no problem `` crossing '' the euphrates , they would keep their greatest advantage anyway . 
  crossing the euphrates by boat seems possible for the ypg . 
  they are n't mentioned because the `` deep state '' in turkey does n't appear to be important any more since [ the ergenekon trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_%28organization%29 ) of 2011 . 
   sloukh was n't completely empty though , nsfl, 
  so that people can decide if they want to see this : close-up of one dead young man in military camouflage , lying in a puddle of blood . 
  tame by the standards of this sub . 
  ( but not that interesting either . ), 
   deal god , is that right ? 
  might be . 
  but the numbers do n't seem quite as fucked up when you look at them a little closer . 
  [ wiki : distribution of wealth in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distribution_of_wealth#in_the_united_states ), 
  the top 1 % own ~ 35 % of the wealth in the us . 
  that 's pretty high , although lower than it has been in the late 90 's . 
  looking at [ one of the sources wikipedia cites ] ( http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html ) , we can calculate that the bottom 90 % owned 23 % of the net wealth in 2010 . 
  the top 0.1 % probably own more than half of what the top 1 % own in total , so they might have more than those 23 % of the net wealth . 
   e.g. 
  70 % of real estate is owned by the same crowd . 
  by what metric ? 
  source for that ? 
  [ since almost 70 % of americans own the house they live in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home-ownership_in_the_united_states#historical ) , i somewhat doubt your number . 
  if you [ look at different numbers ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/20/value_of_all_land_in_the_united_states.html ) , corporate america altogether owns real estate of a total value of `` only '' $ 9.9 trillion , while households and non-profits own $ 21.6 trillion in real estate , and noncorporate businesses own another $ 9.7 trillion . 
   bold prediction . 
  i love it . 
  yesterday , this really * was * a bold prediction . 
  today , we [ have a map like this . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/chcsyzgw8aardt8.png ), 
  so , to make another bold prediction : they will link up * today * . 
  ** claims ** that this is happening . 
  no proof , no evidence . 
  just claims by erdogan . 
  ( although i 'd still be surprised if this is an actual quote . ), 
   `` the west , which has shot arabs and turkmens , is unfortunately placing the pyd [ a syrian kurdish party ] and pkk in lieu of them , '' mr erdogan said . 
  since the ypg has officially asked all refugees and displaced people to return to their homes , i 'd be at the very least impressed by their pr abilities if this turned out to be true . 
  but honestly : nope , i do n't believe a word of this . 
  thanks , turkey !, 
  one of the main fsa groups allied to the kurds . 
  just because they have fewer rights does n't mean they have less education . 
   [ women comprise 60 % of saudi arabia 's college students but only 21 % of its labor force , much lower than in neighboring countries . 
  85 % of employed saudi women work in education , 6 % in public health , and 95 % in the public sector . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_saudi_arabia#girls.27_and_women.27s_education ), 
  from the wikipedia article :, 
   this eclipse is known as halley 's eclipse , after edmond halley ( 1656 -- 1742 ) who predicted this eclipse to within 4 minutes accuracy . 
  halley observed the eclipse from london where the city of london enjoyed 3 minutes 33 seconds of totality . 
  he also drew a predictive map showing the path of totality across england . 
  they also printed [ this neat map .
