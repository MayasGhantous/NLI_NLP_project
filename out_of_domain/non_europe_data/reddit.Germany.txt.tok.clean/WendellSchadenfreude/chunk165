  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/solar_eclipse_1715may03_halley_map.png ) all educated people definitely knew what was happening and were informed in advance . 
  - simple peasants somewhere in the countryside ? 
  i have no idea ... 
  george iii was born in 1738 . 
  he followed his grandfather ( george ii ) on the throne in 1760 . 
  his own father ( george 2.5 - na , just kidding : frederick ) had died in 1751 from a burst abscess in the lung - which neatly leeds back to the topic of `` i should n't have to deal with this shit '' . 
  [ * i * ** just ** * ca n't wait to be king !, 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ufnc85-xm ) - but maybe [ our current monarch will just live forever and i 'll never sit the throne ... ] ( http://static.gofugyourself.com/uploads/2014/08/charles-sad-419x251.jpg ), 
  it 's funny because it 's sad . 
  [ frederick , prince of wales , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick,_prince_of_wales ) was the heir apparent to the british throne for 24 years , until he died of an abscess in the lung . 
  his father , george ii , ruled for another nine years until his death . 
  indirekt . 
  completely baseless accusations without a shred of evidence . 
  how would ahrar know anything about this in the first place ? 
  they are n't anywhere near tel abyad . 
  these groups are simply repeating every word erdogan said . 
  the paper was retracted for a reason . 
  for several reasons , actually . 
  you can read all about [ * the s\u00e9ralini affair * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a9ralini_affair ) on wikipedia . 
  since you do n't seem to believe this : what do you think they want to do ? 
   i really fail to see how asking $ 20 for an expansion is money-grabbing . 
  because the original game was 40 $ , and all non-cosmetic dlcs now already add up to another 80 $ . 
  120 $ just so you have an actually * complete * game is a lot of money . 
  of course , most of us have n't bought all of this stuff at full price , but that 's kind of the point with this expansion : it feels like they want to force most players to switch * quickly * . 
  art of war 20, 
  conquest of paradise 15, 
  wealth of nations 10, 
  res publica 5, 
  total 80 $ , and this does n't include unit packs , songs , portraits , e-books , monuments , or even american dream . 
  i 'm fine with paradox ' dlc policy , overall . 
  i usually wait for 75 % off anyway . 
  but this expansion feels a little like they made the base game * worse * on purpose . 
  kelvin does n't use degrees , all other temperature scales do . 
  there is n't really a reason , [ `` degrees kelvin '' were used until 1967 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degree_%28temperature%29#kelvin ) . 
  it 's fun how the two top answers are basically `` doing stuff at room temperature that we can already do at different temperatures '' . 
  only for one of them ( cold fusion ) , room temperature is seen as `` cold '' , while it 's extremely hot for the other ( superconductors ) . 
  ... and more . 
  um ... the map says it is true . 
  between ayn isa ( already in the hands of ypg/fsa ) and raqqa , what is there ? 
  tall al-sim ` an , qualtah , abbarah , abu al-hassan , al hazimah , harran , mazr ` ah hattin , bi ' r jarbu , ar ruhayyat , kalwat ` ubayd - and one or two groups of houses that do n't have a name on that map . 
  all of these places * combined * are the size of tal abyad at best . 
  raqqa itself is huge , of course , but there is n't much between raqqa and the current frontline . 
   they 'd like ayn issa, 
  they already have [ ayn issa . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/39xfkh/urgent_liwa_thuwar_raqqa_announce_that_they_have/ ), 
  and further south , around zabadani ? 
  idlib is n't fsa , it 's the `` army of conquest '' . 
  in short : nusra + ahrar . 
  damascus - i can only guess you mean mostly east ghouta , which is controlled by jaysh al-islam - not fsa . 
  qalamon is mostly controlled by hezbollah by now . 
  the few pockets holding out are controlled by isis or nusra , except maybe for the tiny area around al-zabadani . 
   eastern qalamoun is completely outside of hezbollah control . 
  and out of fsa control even more , because it 's [ controlled entirely by the syrian government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:syrian_civil_war_detailed_map ) . 
  ruhaiba and jairud are n't part of the qalamoun region . 
   jaish al-usood al-sharqiyah . 
  that 's not even really an fsa group . 
  but even if you count them , there 's no evidence that they actually control * anything * in east qalamoun . 
  ( going to bed . 
  good night ! ), 
   i described this above , but the silly `` not here in time to help , just in time to chime in during introspection , also it took my longer to get here then for you to walk here as a dward , get captured in to slavery , get auctioned off , then make it here '' fely stupid . 
  what do you think he should have done ? 
  present himself to dany , `` i 'm the man who sent hired knifes after you all your life , and now i kind of want to switch sides '' ? 
  - varys had to wait until tyrion is in a position where he can protect him . 
   the great holy grail in anthropology is to find the single cultural constant that we would find shared among us all . 
  so what do you think about list of `` human universals '' like this one ? 
  http://humanuniversals.com/human-universals/ ( i shit you not , that 's the actual link to a list of human universals ) . 
   stannis is ambiguously presumed dead in both the books and show ( more certainly in the show ) . 
  did i miss something about the books ? 
  because the stannis i know is certainly alive and well , and about to kick some frey ass . 
  edit : can somebody actually explain this to me ? 
  because as far as i know , stannis is definitely alive in the books , and there is no reason to believe otherwise . 
  i do n't think the headline actually implies that . 
  you can send messages ( e.g. 
  threats ) to groups you do n't coordinate with . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/39chn4/massacre_40_druze_people_slaughtered_by_jabhat_al/ ), 
  these are just pictures documenting their claims of having killed a certain number of enemies . 
  the people were not tortured to death , they were armed and fighting when they were killed , and their bodies were n't disfigured any further after their death . 
  ( although many of them were killed in airstrikes and look quite horrible . ), 
  this is n't remotely comparable to the gore videos of isis . 
  can a person always belong to only one clan ? 
  if a shammar man marries a juboor woman ( would that be realistic ? 
  ) , would their children be considered shammar only , or juboor only , or both ? 
  7.3 e78 is also quite literally an astronomical number . 
  it 's roughly ( give or take a factor of a million or so ) equal to the number of atoms in the observable universe . 
  i do n't understand why quixotic_fool used so silly numbers . 
  double your money once every year for 50 years , and you 're still easily the richest person ever , with roughly 1,000 trillion dollars . 
  that 's just a little more than the us gdp over the entire course of those 50 years . 
  - and doubling your money every year might should actually be possible for a while if you come from the future . 
  ( i still think it becomes impossible once you already are the richest person by far , but well - everything beyond that is just a bonus anyway . ), 
  with amazon shipping arms to all of them . 
  `` conquest ( of ) aleppo '' in english , by the way . 
  paris is very clearly in the northern half of france . 
  thinking that it 's anywhere near the center might be a rather typical french misconception . 
  of course , it 's the center of france politically , economically , culturally , [ almost anything ] - ally , but not geographically . 
  they did make the correct call here . 
  messi might have confused the goal keeper , but if so , that 's the goalie 's problem for not understanding the situation correctly . 
  messi was blocking neither his movement nor his line of sight . 
  [ here 's a shitty explanatory image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rm7dk48.png ) to show what influencing the play without touching the ball means . 
  of course they 're not giving `` back '' the parts where almost exclusively white people have been living for 200 years .
