  many areas in the north are not deserts , they are graslands or tropical forests . 
  [ does this look like a desert to you ? 
  yep , that is pretty generous . 
  nobody is forcing them , there is * nothing * the aborigines could do or could have done to make them give anything back , they are doing this purely out of their own free will . 
  historically , there is n't much precedence for this kind of behaviour . 
  keep your racism to yourself , thank you . 
  it 's not ? 
  how so ? 
  if anything , i think it 's better , because it already started with a prosthetic * hand * rather than legs . 
   the keeper has literally no way of knowing if messi is offside or not, 
  he is standing mere meters away ? 
  he can look at where messi is and where his defenders are , and by knowing the rules immediately know that he can safely ignore messi - * if * he can reach that ball at all , which i doubt . 
  if the goalie lets a player who is offside influence his actions , that 's his own fault . 
  the rules do n't protect a goal keeper from making poor decisions . 
  knowing wether a player is offside is also his own job . 
  you could also claim that the defenders were also `` influenced '' by their wrong belief that messi was offside ( that 's why they started waving their hands ) , but that does n't * make * him offside . 
  if messi were hindering the goalie 's movement or even just blocking his line of sight , offside . 
  he 's not , therefore : onside . 
  i think you 're underestimating the mess that is the balkans . 
  have a look [ at this article ] ( http://mondediplo.com/2003/08/04derens ) or even just at some of its pictures [ [ macedonia ] ( http://mondediplo.com/img/jpg/macedoine_big.jpg ) , [ kosovo ] ( http://mondediplo.com/img/jpg/kosovo.jpg ) ] , and i think you 'll find that the ethnic clutter is n't any worse in syria than it is in ex-jugoslavia . 
  i do not frequent any such forums . 
  seriously , what point are you trying to make ? 
  please try to explain it with as little sarcasm as possible . 
  because to me , it looks like australia is giving huge areas of land to the aborigines , and all you have to say about this are sarcastic comments . 
  is your position that voluntary attempts at reparation deserve no praise unless australia razes sidney ? 
  it 's a bit much to describe this comment as `` helpful '' . 
  it might be , if you told us what you would call it instead . 
  i love that i honestly ca n't tell if you 're making fun of the `` muh privilege '' people , or if you really are one of them . 
  if you actually have something to say about this , go ahead and say it . 
  if not , keep confining yourself to sarcastic one-liners . 
  did you find a note explaining why you did that ? 
  if not , drunk you is kind of an ass . 
  fantastic list . 
  just so you do n't make a very costly mistake : [ it 's people who are * not yet * 24 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_north_america#florida ) . 
  24 years is too old already . 
  the future is ~ ~ dark ~ ~ hype and full of tinfoil !, 
  wow , amazing work . 
  for anyone interested , here 's the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_sedan_%281870%29 ) for the battle .

  [ oh my , you people are messed up . 
  there are only a few songs that are not team specific . 
  most of them are songs for the national team . 
  this one is great for singing along [ ( schwaaaaarz und wei\u00df , wir steh 'n auf eurer seite ... ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljeodcacrqs ) , [ this one is a bit outdated ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9owjbiulfnc ) ( because it predicts winning the world cup in 2010 ) , but still a great song . 
  but for the most part , you 'd have to learn the songs for one specific team ( although they keep stealing from each other ) . 
  some examples for the fc k\u00f6ln :, 
  [ mer stonn zo dir , fc k\u00f6lle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlp7ogfsgj0 ), 
  [ rut und wiess ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sclvltpbcau ), 
  yep , too bad : you 'll have to learn the regional dialect before learning the songs ... :p, 
  i think this comment is just needlessly confusing for foreigners .

   the constitution says `` the united states of america is '' , not '' are '' . 
  [ it says neither . 
  ] ( http://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/constitution/?gclid=cmhv2rhipcycfbdmtaodi7wkjq ), 
  ctrl + f the text for `` the united states is '' and `` the united states are '' , neither of them is used at all . 
  ( except in the sentence `` when the president of ** the united states is ** tried ... '' ), 
  for a moment , i was sure this was gon na be / u/hallucinates _ owls . 
  i was already so proud of myself : `` i 'm not falling for him this time ! '', 
   huge difference between the two . 
  i did n't even notice that `` until tomorrow '' could mean `` leave now , stay away until tomorrow , but you can return the day after that '' . 
  clearly , he means `` they have until tomorrow to leave the city '' . 
  i think everybody here is leaving out one important difference :, 
  ** a `` maler '' can either be a house painter or an artist painter . 
  ** a `` malermeister '' is always a house painter , never an artist . 
  ** he also has a master craftman 's diploma ( `` meisterbrief '' ) . 
  most people would simply call him a `` maler '' anyway , and i think many `` malermeister '' will even say about themselves that they are `` maler '' . 
  a house painter `` maler '' who is not a `` meister '' yet is a malergeselle ( journeyman ) or malerlehrling ( apprentice ) . 
  according to wikipedia , it is . 
   [ ** etymology ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=woman#etymology ), 
   the spelling of woman in english has progressed over the past millennium from w\u012bfmann [ 1 ] to w\u012bmmann to wumman , and finally , the modern spelling woman . 
  [ 2 ] in old english , w\u012bfmann meant `` female human '' , whereas w\u0113r meant `` male human '' . 
  mann or monn had a gender-neutral meaning of `` human '' , corresponding to modern english `` person '' or `` someone '' , however subsequent to the norman conquest , man began to be used more in reference to `` male human '' , and by the late 1200s had begun to eclipse usage of the older term w\u0113r .

  who is the shopped-in guy ? 
  pictures are too blurry for me to tell .

  thanks for the answer , / u/acarmadeofdeadfolks . ), 
  quote for readability . 
   fixing it i would say russia needs to get a golden age modifier after formation that gives them a massive discount to development . 
  something needs to allow for both a poor russia with infinite manpower eating the hordes , and also a giant scarey developed monster of the east for lategame . 
   here 's an idea , work your ass off and eventually you will become top management . 
  you realize this can only ever be true for < 1 % of the people , right ? 
  i * like * capitalism , i 'm even ok with america 's corporate capitalism , but this is a bad argument . 
  for one thing , you 're only showing that there are * some * hard-working people in the management , not that all hard-working people get there . 
  but more importantly , i think we 're discussing the wrong question in general . 
  a better question :, 
  do you want a good life only for the 1 % that work the hardest , or ( as far as possible ) a good life for all ? 
  where 'd you check ? 
  because while `` completely banned '' is a slight exaggeration , it 's mostly true [ that nazi symbols are banned in germany . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strafgesetzbuch_section_86a ) you can use them e.g. 
  for educational purposes , but if your app simply uses a swastika as its symbol , it 's going to be banned in germany . 
   the german strafgesetzbuch ( criminal code ) in \u00a7 86a outlaws `` use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations '' . 
  this concerns nazi symbolism in particular and is part of the denazification efforts following the fall of the third reich . 
   the law prohibits the distribution or public use of symbols of unconstitutional groups , in particular , flags , insignia , uniforms , slogans and forms of greeting . 
  for those who do n't get it :, 
  `` apart ( from ) '' means separate , disjoined . 
  `` a part ( of ) '' [ `` a part '' , in two words , dammit ] means section , member , piece , share . 
  it 's the minor error that op corrected by now .
