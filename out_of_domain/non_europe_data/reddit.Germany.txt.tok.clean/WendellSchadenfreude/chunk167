  now please show me where in that article anything resembling slavery is mentioned . 
  assuming you 're talking about foxconn :, 
   [ against this , the suicide rate at foxconn , even during the suicide spate , was lower than that of china [ 88 ] as well as that of all 50 states of the united states . 
  [ 89 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foxconn#suicides ), 
  i do n't think that 's an important distinction at all . 
  nobody is suggesting that the use of the confederate flag should be illegal for schools while they are teaching about the civil war , or for documentaries about the war . 
  those are the contexts in which nazi symbols are frequently used in germany - when teaching about history . 
  if that 's the only context in which a symbol is allowed , it 's banned for all practical purposes . 
  as a sidenote , i think neither the confederate flag nor nazi symbols should be illegal . 
  wether you should use them is a different question . 
  [ nice try , per . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=per&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=885&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=uhwnvdookyussahe2zbicw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ), 
  you realize he was [ talking about this flag ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_confederate_states_of_america_%281865%29.svg ) - yes , the white and red are part of the flag - , not [ this one ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:confederate_rebel_flag.svg ) , right ? 
   - giving leaders a chance to get better . 
  i love everything about this idea . 
  if i had to choose living as a gay married person in a bible belt village or as a gay person in a civil union anywhere in germany , it would be germany any time . 
  the situation of gay people in germany as well as in the us ( post - or pre-scotus ) is far better than that of black people under segregation , so you 'll have to come up with a better sarcastic one-liner at least , or one might think you 're deliberately making light of the struggle of the black community . 
  i think both of you made valid and well-argued points . 
  i love it when that happens . 
  the fsa brigades in the area have been fighting alongside the ypg against isis for months . 
  it 's absurd to believe that entire brigades would turn around and start to massacre civilians all of a sudden . 
  did you comment on the wrong thread ? 
  this is west of kobane , probably close to jarabulus , nowhere near hasakah . 
   `` if they take the ship , they 'll rape us to death , eat our flesh , and sew our skins into their clothing . 
  and , if we 're very , very lucky , they 'll do it in that order . '', 
  that seems pretty much on a par . 
  they * live * there . 
  if they leave , they are likely to never come back . 
  by your logic , they might also evacuate afrin to kobane and kobane to cizire . 
  and maybe cizire to northern iraq . 
  or pack up and move to the us altogether . 
   the office of vp usually signals the end of a political career, 
  i do n't think it does . 
  of the last five vps before biden , four ( ! ), 
  ran for president later . 
  quayle failed to secure the nomination , mondale was nominated but lost against reagan , gore came extremely close to winning , and bush senior actually won . 
  and that 's just the presidency . 
  mondale had a political career ( e.g. 
  ambassador to japan ) beside that , and do n't even start about gore . 
  he had - and still has - a lot of political and social influence ; he also received the nobel peace prize after his vice-presidency . 
  even the chinese will be hestitant to accept money that can only be used in turn to buy greek products . 
  they might do it , but not at great rates . 
  just to be clear : blowing up a bunch of american/russian/allied soldiers during the war would not be seen as a crime and would never have been prosecuted . 
  when we talk about the individual guilt , it 's most likely to be about participation in the holocaust or in other crimes against civilians . 
  a german soldiers who killed allied soldiers in combat but never hurt any civilians would not be seen as `` guilty '' of anything . 
  `` raqqa is being slaughtered silently '' is the name of an organization . 
  i like the ypg as much as most people on this board . 
  but i do because i do n't believe they are systematically killing civilians , let alone children . 
  show me any evidence that they do , and i will upvote that evidence and silently shed a tear for my idea that there might actually be a decent force left in syria . 
  show me unfounded rumors , and i wo n't believe them . 
  ribss opposes isis , and always has . 
  that 's not * interesting * , that 's only consequent . 
  ( not the displacement - his neglect of mentioning it . ), 
  he did n't mention saddam 's wars against the kurds either , or the armenian genocide , or last week 's baseball results - they all have nothing to do with wether or not there should be an anti-ypg flair . 
  thanks . 
  does the request itself even need to be discussed ? 
  of course there should be an anti-ypg flair , unless we do away with `` anti- `` flairs altogether . 
  not that i 'd have much respect for anyone who uses one , but we have lots of flairs for naive or despicable positions . 
   you dont fix a mystic by another mystic, 
  i think you mean `` mistake '' . 
  do n't worry , confusing these two is a common mystic . 
  probably because they still were in the restaurant and wanted to move him away from innocent bystanders first . 
  do your own homework . 
  if you want us to help , show us a bit of your thought process instead of just spamming this question . 
  it 's really weird for me : whenever i listen to a german labor union official , i think they 're talking nonsense . 
  but whenever i hear americans talk about their job conditions , i think they badly need some unions just like ours . 
  sweden has a higher gdp per capita than the us . 
  other european countries ( e.g. 
  germany , netherlands , austria ) are also doing just fine . 
  you have n't even seen the best part . 
  ellen [ actually answered in that thread . 
  protests against the ruling assad regime in syria turned into a violent civil war that has been jarring both syria and iraq for several years now . 
  hundreds of thousands have been killed , millions displaced . 
  via direct military action or indirect support of one of the many factions , major world and regional powers such as the us , russia , iran , and saudi-arabia have become involved in the conflict . 
  an end is nowhere in sight . 
  i 'm aware that you were asking what happened in that other `` conflict '' . 
  but this one is more important , as that yugoslav guy rightly stated . 
  texting people `` what are you doing tonight '' is not a great line . 
  if you want to hang out with them , you 're probably hoping that they have nothing special planned - but that 's awkward for them to admit . 
  or they have something planned , but maybe it 's not clear if you could just tag along . 
  if you want to do something with your friends , make a suggestion . 
  `` hey ben - wan na grab a beer / play some ball / watch a movie / play boardgames / hunt some boar / go swimming / have sex / look at cat pictures / discuss economics / sing * frozen * songs / play with my dog later ? '', 
  i think we should go private . 
  and just to be clear : this has * nothing * to do with fatpeoplehate or tpp . 
  i have no idea where op got that from . 
  not to be rude , but if you purely want to discuss logic , your entire post is nothing but garbage . 
   1 ) what caused the universe ? 
  must be an intelligent being, 
  why ? 
  how do you logically get from that question to this answer ? 
  there is no logic to debate in there at all . 
   2 ) considering this intelligent being created everything ( a ) , it must be all powerful ( b ) , therefore we can conclude it is just one intelligent being , as oppose to a trinity , hindu gods ( c ), 
  b does n't follow from a. 
  the creator of the universe might be powerless to change anything in the universe . 
  for instance , the people who built my car have no power over it at all . 
  they do n't even know where it is . 
  c does n't follow from anything . 
  there might be a group of creators , or the universe might have been created by accident , or there might even be the christian trinity - for an all-powerful god , being a trinity should n't be a problem , just because we do n't understand it . 
  if a company signs a confidentiality agreement that is so far-reaching that the company can no longer give any information on a situation that might be critical for the company 's survival , that company has a horrible legal team . 
  it 's pretty .
