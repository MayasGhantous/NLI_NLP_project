  what was your degree of involvment in this whole mess ? 
   germany 's kicking ass , got itself out of debt after the recession and into a surplus, 
  germany is running a surplus at the moment , but certainly is not `` out of debt '' . 
  per capita , germany 's debt is comparable to that of greece . 
  [ ( $ 27k for germany , $ 29k for greece ) ] ( http://www.haushaltssteuerung.de/staatsverschuldung-europa-ranking.html#staatsschulden-je-einwohner ) that 's much lower as a percentage of the gdp , of course . 
  the us debt per capita is [ higher than either germany 's or greece 's , by the way . 
  ] ( http://www.haushaltssteuerung.de/schuldenuhr-staatsverschuldung-usa.html ) ( $ 41k if we ignore intragovernmental debt - although there are so many differences that these numbers are probably not comparable . ), 
  ... netherlands , austria , switzerland , even england , poland , estonia . 
  germany was doing just fine before the euro . 
  it has helped germany in the past years , but the euro is not the biggest reason that life is fine in germany . 
  the us debt per capita is much [ higher than that of most european states at $ 41k . 
  ] ( http://www.haushaltssteuerung.de/schuldenuhr-staatsverschuldung-usa.html ) of the $ - countries , only [ ireland and greece come close to this , at $ 44k and $ 38k , respectively . 
  ( sources are in german , but the numbers are the same .

  gladly . 
  sweden 's gdp per capita is higher than america 's . 
  $ 60k vs $ 53k . 
  finland 's is slightly lower at $ 49k .

  just so that users are n't tempted to show their disagreement with your position by downvoting : i disagree . 
  i like having flairs . 
   every elected official that votes against this one is bought off by wall street . 
  i have big news for you : there are people in the world who have opinions different from yours , and they hold them for reasons other than being paid to do so , some of the time . 
   you could even argue that north africans worshiped some gods before christianity arrived . 
  of course they did , but so did everybody else in the world . 
  the religions shown in the video were n't the five first religions in the world . 
  religion is thousands of years old and was * everywhere * . 
  but that 's not the meaning of `` whatever '' op is looking for . 
  yep . 
  or more literally : '' ( all ) the same to me . '', 
   it has nothing to do with absorption, 
  of course it does , the microwaves are absorbed . 
  * is it large enough to fit an actual kitty ? 
   turns out savages do n't attack other savages . 
  that might be useful . 
  some relevant factors : show us the military ledger , sorted by highest force limit - if your enemies are at high manpower while you and your allies are not , you might be in trouble . 
  if the opposite is true , this will be a walk in the park . 
  can you make a separate peace with russia ? 
  that should be possible unless they are in a pu or something , and it would make things a lot easier . 
  if you 're scared , just try to pay the netherlands off and call scandinavia in to balance things out . 
  with their help , crushing russia should be easy enough . 
  all in all : yeah , you can win this . 
  your step-dad is a very wise man . 
  or , well , at least he 's not a complete retard . 
  that 's all i can really tell about him from this post . 
  germany . 
  i 'm shocked there is n't even an english wikipedia article explaining the concept of * hitzefrei * ( day off because of the heat ) . 
  the rules are different in every german region , but the standard seems to be something like 25 or 27 \u00b0 c , measured before 11 am . 
  source : [ hitzefrei ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hitzefrei ), 
  [ thank you for your suggestion . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/ ), 
  your cat , of course . 
  did you even look at the picture ? 
  that 's the point . 
  they ca n't use nazi flags , so they use some other flag that most people will still somewhat associate with the nazis . 
   salary of $ 1000-3000 usd, 
  per year , i assume ? 
   you can have leveraged trades . 
  for people who do n't know what this means : basically , trading with borrowed money . 
  which is a horrible idea and something you should never , ever do !, 
  it made warren buffet rich , and it will make you poor . 
   and what 's m\u00f6nchengladbach supposed to be ? 
  compare [ this picture . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:m%c3%b6nchengladbach_museum.jpg ), 
   i understand that in some cases , using sein for the past tense is used instead of haben, 
  in cases where the verb involves movement . 
  you would always be understood if you do this wrong . 
  i do n't understand how that 's a reason to hate him . 
   so i think it is safe to say that 80 % of infantry are non-sunnis also, 
  the ethno-religious makeup of regular army units certainly is n't the same as that of some elite units . 
  when the civil war started , most regular soldiers in the saa were sunnis , although most of the officers and elite units were alawites . 
  the defections ( that occured almost exclusively among sunnis ) changed that composition somewhat , but there certainly still are more than 20 % sunnis in the army . 
  for a company that * needs * to be liked by it 's customers , why would you hire a ceo whom the customers dislike in the first place ? 
  or start with part 2 if you 're only interested in the cars . 
  do you have sources in the area ? 
  honestly , people : let 's not downvote this guy for giving purely factual information , unless we have reason to believe that it 's wrong ... 
  even a person descended from aztecs or tupi or quechua is n't `` returning to the land of their ancestors '' when they move to california . 
  so even ignoring the fact that hispanics are mostly descended from spaniards ( you know : people from [ hispania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hispania ) ) , you are still wrong * and * racist . 
  you 're just trying to make other people feel old , right ? 
  i 'm not even gon na tell you how much * younger * than me he was . 
   or `` zus '' ( like it would sound in english ) instead of `` das '' ? 
  this one shocked me the most . 
  now that one just confuses me . 
  i listened to that part of the spot some ten times now , and i 'm still convinced the woman says `` das '' ( kun zee duz ... ) , not anything starting with a z - . 
  is my brain just messing with me ? 
  what are other people hearing ? 
  the people in that spot sound like normal speakers to me - their accents are n't particularly strong and they do n't sound * that * sloppy . 
  so yes , this is what normal germans talk like - one of the ways at least . 
  most will speak a little more clearly when talking to foreigners . 
  that being said , i do n't think this should discourage you too much . 
  once you actually know a language , you get used to different accents quite easily . 
  pronounciation is rather easier in german than in english . 
  most english accents are also quite far from what we learn in school , and we can still understand them . 
  amazing picture . 
  everything in this picture - the haircut , the jacket , the cars , the picture quality , and of course the wtc - tells you that 2000 was still firmly part of the '90s . 
  things * did * change overnight in 2001 . 
  the new millenium was just a few months late . 
  that does n't matter in this context .
