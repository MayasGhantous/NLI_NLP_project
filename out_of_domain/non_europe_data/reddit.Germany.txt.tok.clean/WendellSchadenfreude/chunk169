  cnn is claiming that reddit is mysogynistic because reddit revolted against a female ceo . 
  but reddit revolted against that ceo because a female employee was fired . 
  the reason why she was fired does n't matter at all : claiming that someone is sexist for choosing one woman over another does n't make any sense . 
  i have no idea who the male employee whom your refering to even was . 
  the rebel yell of the riot was `` victoria !, 
  '' , not `` victoria and that other dude '' . 
  i do n't think apple even produces anything in third world countries . 
  their factories are mostly in china , which is * not * a third world country . 
  generally , i consider paying people from poor countries better than * not * paying them . 
  something you consider `` next to nothing '' may well be a good wage in china , let alone in afghanistan , congo , or sudan . 
  was n't that true for tabqa as well ? 
  `` kinda telling '' in what way ? 
  one of them got obama and snoop here . 
  the other one also did some fine work . 
   who 's to say the replacement the wo n't be able to as well ? 
  assuming yours is not a troll post , you might still want to explain in what way it is `` telling '' that firing a female employee created more backlash among an ostensibly misogynistic community than firing a male employee . 
  i actually thought about it and decided that op more likely means apple products . 
  does n't matter really , since mac makeup is also produced in china . 
  oh , and in canada ( the working conditions must be horrible ) . 
  generally speaking , third world countries do n't produce much that they export . 
  that 's one of their problems . 
  either way , op should * also * feel bad for listing one class ot items ( clothing ) and one specific brand ( apple or mac ) .

   peter dinklage is just a memorizing actor . 
  do you mean mesmerizing ? 
  calling an actor `` memorizing '' also makes sense , but it would be quite a harsh insult . 
  `` he 's just * memorizing * his lines , not actually * acting * . '', 
  i thought they could n't sail against the wind at the time , making it impossible for two fleets coming from different directions to sail past each other . 
  which rule specifically ? 
  i do n't agree with the sentiment , but i do n't think it violates our rules . 
  and that 's good . 
  yep , that sounds very much like * intentionally * broken english . 
  anyway , [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3ddf3h/i_not_speak_english_well_i_am_in_el_paso_texas/ct44ll5 ) sums it up nicely : `` be aware that in worst case we got trolled , but in the best case we have provided some assistance to an abused kid and family . '', 
  - so this is probably fake , but it does n't matter that much . 
  although i wish we would only post stuff like this to bestof if we have better reason to believe that it 's real . 
  five hours , and no replies to this .

  there are hundreds of thousands of arabs in germany . 
  some 300,000 people in germany are citizens of arab countries , another 200,000 or so are germans with an arab ethnic background . 
  [ there 's even a short wikipedia article about them * in english * . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabs_in_germany ) - they usually are n't worried , and neither should you be . 
  germans might not talk to you in the street , because we do n't just talk to other people either , neither to germans nor to foreigners . 
  your wife 's hijab might garner a few contemptuous looks , but probably not . 
  as long as it 's just a headscarf covering her hair , few people will care . 
  if it 's a full abaya + niqab , many people will immediately think less of you . 
  even then , you 'll still be perfectly safe , but i would suggest to her to tone it down as much as she is comfortable with . 
  that 's a bonus , not a problem . 
  you just isolate them during the vote , only tell them who was voted out after the fact . 
  once you hear that you 're out , you do n't get another chance to talk to the other candidates . 
  does n't matter . 
  we had our fun . 
  ( they should probably get $ 1 million each .

  it 's fantastic how precisely you can see the [ carpathian basin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pannonian_basin ) on that map . 
  but no czechoslovakia . 
  the most german reply possible . 
  `` why have n't you overthrown your democratically elected government yet '' is quite a weird question . 
  if they do n't like it , they can elect a different one by no later than january 2017 . 
  until then , this government , wether you like it or not , is certainly better than anarchy . 
  one of my favorite christmas songs is actually australian , tim minchin 's [ `` drinking white wine in the sun '' . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwqudtxd2-c ), 
  australians - is that song any popular around christmas time in your country ? 
  denying crimes that your ancestors commited is a problem . 
  reducing your ancestor to * nothing but their crimes * is also a problem . 
  how popular is `` waltzing matilda '' ? 
  do you ever just put it on even when there are no tourists around ? 
  if so , how often ? 
  once a year , once a day , once a decade ? 
   420 new recruits per day ? 
  in the above post , it was 420 per * week * . 
  the numbers may be * way * off . 
  - up to eleven * what * ?

  if you say you 're from `` the virgin islands '' , that counts very much as exotic , because nobody will know what you 're even talking about . 
  if you say you 're from `` the usa , the virgin islands to be precise '' , people will still assume you 're from new york or something .

   get opinion modifier * iberian wedding * towards aragon ( +200 opinion ), 
   aragon gets opinion modifier * iberian wedding * towards castile castile ( +200 opinion ), 
   size 3 noble rebels rise in revolt in a random owned province that is not the capital, 
   every known country with a royal marriage with aragon gets the opinion modifier iberian wedding towards castile ( -50 opinion ), 
   ** no , let us marry a local talent instead **, 
   gain +1 stability, 
   aragon gets opinion modifier * declined iberian wedding * towards castile ( -25 opinion ), 
  so , you gain 1 stability , you avoid having to fight some rebels , and you do n't anger your rm partners .

  lebanon has a roughly equal amount of sunni and shia muslims , and hezbollah has no problem cooperating with sunnis ( or christians , or druze ) . 
  see for instance the [ lebanese resistance brigades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hezbollah#lebanese_resistance_brigades ) . 
  if this is the third , which are the other two ? 
  mississippi and ... ? 
  ouch ... 
  i thought that , but then i thought `` that ca n't mean ` big river ' , it 's named after the area '' ...
