   the russians named the yukon river , believing that `` yuk-khana '' was a deg xinag phrase meaning big river . 
  [ 6 ] however , `` yuk-khana '' is not a deg xinag phrase meaning big river . 
  [ 7 ] probably , the deg hit ' an borrowed the name from an upriver language and borrowed the `` big river '' meaning from the central yup ' ik name . 
  [ 8 ] most likely , yukon was derived from an obsolete gwich ` in word , [ 9 ] which included the concept of long water or wide water , but did not mean `` big '' river or `` great '' river . 
  they are , and your comment also is against the rules . 
  this would completely freak me out , much more than `` my love '' ever would . 
  i 'm ok with these suggestions , but i think the `` generic '' term of endearment would be `` mein schatz '' in german . 
  works after thirty years of marriage just as well as early on in the relationship . 
  generic is what i was going for . 
  op 's girl likely did n't mean much by saying `` my love '' - at least , that 's what we hope . 
  `` mein schatz '' is simply what all kinds of couples call each other , and it does n't really convey how close you think you are . 
  answering the second question first : probably not . 
  you are probably not dedicated enough to be a good beekeeper , and you wo n't do any good if you have a hive that dies within a year . 
  if you are serious about getting into beekeeping , find some local beekeeper and talk to them first . 
  about their importance : bees are very important , economically and ecologically . 
  if they disappeared suddenly , it would have quite drastic consequences . 
  the good news is that there 's no danger of that happening . 
  [ ask for instance the epa ] ( http://www2.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder ) and you 'll find that high winter losses are more of an economical nuissance than an actual threat . 
  probably not . 
  there are many rumors , but those are spread mostly by people who always hated the kurds . 
  there certainly is no centraly organized genocide carried out by the kurdish forces . 
  there might occasionally have been war crimes commited by individual units . 
  there was a different story that i found much more clever . 
  guy used a debit card and amazon ebooks to gain unlimited free credit . 
  i ca n't really work out the details anymore , but roughly : when he needed money , he ordered some ebooks to be paid from his debit card . 
  he cancelled the order and was immediately reimbursed the money - but he had n't even actually paid yet . 
  this somehow worked out so that he had free credit - at the end of the month , he simply had to order and cancel a bunch of stuff , and somehow did n't have to pay for any of it until the end of the * next * month , when he would do the same thing again . 
  ( i 'm pretty sure amazon fixed that by now . ), 
  how common are they in the us ? 
  i 'm german , and i never even heard of workplace drug tests offline . 
  no , that 's not the same . 
  in a public multireddit , if you want to comment on any post , you 'd still go to the original submission in some porn subreddit . 
  depending on your workplace , that can already be impossible , because every url containing `` porn '' may be blocked ( or dangerous to enter ) . 
  the `` official '' multireddit that dakta mentioned even contains the porn suffix in the name itself . 
  if you do n't want to enter a sfwporn subreddit , i 'm sure you also do n't want to enter a multireddit called `` sfwpornnetwork '' . 
  you should be able to participate . 
  you might have ended up with np.reddit in the url because you followed some bestof link . 
  but if you simply go to / r/nosillysuffix / , there should be no problem . 
  can you link to the comment ? 
  i have no idea what you are talking about ; i do n't even know which op you mean . 
  for the record : i 've submitted this question to [ xkcd 's `` what if ? 
  '' ] ( http://what-if.xkcd.com/ ) ( with reference to / u/jazdia ) . 
  please do n't bother randall by sending in the same suggestion again . 
  i like this idea , but pluto certainly is n't stable enough to roll around on the surface of the earth . 
  ( neither is the earth 's crust . ), 
  it 's switzerland . 
  all the trains * combined * are only a couple of minutes late every year . 
  edit : yes , i 'm slightly exaggerating for effect . 
  but here are some details from an article titled [ the swiss are scandalized by trains that run three minutes behind schedule ] ( http://qz.com/166186/the-swiss-are-scandalized-by-trains-that-run-three-minutes-behind-schedule/ ) . 
   swiss media are abuzz with the news of the country 's faltering rail system . 
  last year , the state-run rail operator missed its target for punctuality ; only 87.5 % of trains arrived within three minutes of their scheduled arrival . 
  this is down from the 89 % target as well as the second consecutive year of deterioration -- it recorded an on-time performance of 89.8 % in 2011 and 88 % in 2012 . 
  not quite . 
  many of the `` benefits '' are mandatory - everybody has 20 + vacation days per year , paid sick leave , free health care and all that stuff . 
  i 'm sure cern has a better work environment than most emploeyers , but from what i read on reddit , every american company must feel like a sweatshop compared to any company operating within legal boundaries in switzerland or the eu . 
  norway begs to differ . 
  you sound like you 're mad about something . 
  maybe you should have a long lunchbreak to calm down , or take some days off . 
  i love this story . 
   i thought my boss told me it was `` the day the cheeses ascend to the heavens '' that sounded weird to me , but she seemed uncomfortable talking about it so i did n't press her . 
  most people are uncomfortable talking about this , becasue they do n't really know what these holidays are about . 
  just be glad you did n't ask about corpus christi , or you might have ended up with `` the day that we are all happy about the dead cheeses '' . 
  ( `` fronleichnam '' does n't actually have anything to do with `` froh '' ~ * happy * , but many people think so . ), 
  i love the us . 
  i do n't think it 's `` hating on the us '' to feel sorry for american workers who have no sick leave , no maternity leave , and some ten-fifteen free days per year in a job with poor healthcare and long hours . 
  about bad parts of the country as seen by foreigners - first you have to find some . 
  i think there were quite a few articles critical of the minaret ban a few years ago , or of the swiss banks helping their customers to commit tax fraud . 
  it 's possible that some of these articles were written by americans - although america is of course quite far away from switzerland , and most comments by foreigners would be by germans or frenchmen . 
  in that case , you 'll have to wait for an hour or two . 
  it 's even worse when he goes on vacation - you 're stuck in the train until he comes back , which can take several weeks . 
  that sounds exactly like something [ roger federer would say ] ( http://imgace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/advantage-of-living-in-switzerland.jpg ) in defense of his home country . 
  i think chemistry is generally speaking in higher demand than biology . 
  my view might be somewhat biased by the fact that i * am * a chemist , so i hear a lot more about chemistry than about biology . 
  a problem in this case is that the normal degree for german academic chemists is not the bachelor or even the master , but the doctorate . 
  a few years ago , i heard that some 90 % of master/diploma absolvents went on to get their doctorate in chemistry . 
  if you ca n't see yourself doing that ( ten years at university is a * long * time ) , you might instead want to become a lab assistant instead - in germany , this would be an apprenticeship , i have no idea how you would go about doing something similar in the us . 
   i 'm pretty sure it 's johan and not john, 
  swedish / english . 
  he 's still charles xiv jean in french . 
  whenever this is mentioned on reddit , he is called `` a soldier '' , which makes it sound like he was some lowly private . 
  so just to clarify : bernadotte was a marshal of the empire , he had been governor of hanover and french minister of war , and he was 1st sovereign prince of ponte corvo . 
  according to wikipedia , [ it was the armed/safe switch which was still in the safe position , as it should be . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_goldsboro_b-52_crash#bomb_recovery ), 
  cheap shot against young men . 
  considering the user who 's daughter we 're talking about is called `` babyjesusbukkake '' , i do n't think they are always more gross or silly than adults of either gender . 
  [ here is an example for rather extreme political correctness . 
  ] ( http://www.thefederalistpapers.org/education-2/this-ucla-professor-called-racist-for-the-horrible-thing-he-did-to-a-black-student ) - a ucla professor who was accused of racism and `` creating a hostile class climate for students of color '' because he insisted that everybody has to use correct english in their papers . 
  you might be politically correct and insist that [ aave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_american_vernacular_english ) ( - assuming that 's roughly what they were using instead - ) * is * `` correct '' english - but it 's certainly not the kind of english you use in scientific papers . 
   i ca n't think of any situation i would use `` merkst du den unterschied ? '', 
  i can think of thousands . 
  in pretty much any situation in which i might say `` kannst du den unterschied erkennen ? 
  '' , i 'd also be happy to say `` merkst du den unterschied ? '', 
  instead . 
  sounds very natural to me . 
  as aru21 said : that sentence doens ' t sound good . 
  `` merkst du den unterschied '' is just fine , your sentence for some reason is not . 
  it might work if this is meant to be a generic `` du '' , but in that case , i 'd prefer `` man '' - `` kann man den unterschied zwischen 30fps und 60fps merken ? '', 
  ( i still do n't think i 'd ask the question like that . 
  but it would n't feel too weird if somebody else did . ), 
   there was a scientific study ( do n't have the link handy ) showing that if there is any wind at all , black clothing cools you more than white .
