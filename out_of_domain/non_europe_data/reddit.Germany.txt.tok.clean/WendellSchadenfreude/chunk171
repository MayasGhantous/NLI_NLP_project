  unless somebody finds that study , i do n't believe it - at least , the reason you state for it . 
  black absorbs more light than white * in the visible spectrum * - that 's why it 's black . 
  the sun emits light in that part of the spectrum - in other words , it 's bright . 
  the absorbed light heats things up , because they emit the absorbed energy as heat . 
  now if humans also emitted light in the visible spectrum , black clothes would absorb that just as well as they absorb the sunlight . 
  but humans * do n't * emit light in the visible spectrum - we do n't glow in the dark . 
  google found some explanations that say [ the black , loose clothes help create sort of a chimney effect ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/most-improbable-scientific-research-abrahams ) , with air rising between the robes and the skin , cooling the body by transporting away sweat . 
  that sounds possible . 
  my guess is that the color is mostly a fashion choice . 
  if you ca n't have a rational discussion with some of the people here , you can simply * not * reply to their comments . 
  we have isis supporters here . 
  i think people who support that group are beyond the reach of reason , but i 'm still happy they are here - they give useful insights and sometimes have good sources . 
  posting something like `` you support murderers '' under each of their posts wo n't do any good . 
  my position is very different from yours , but i think we * can * have a reasonable discussion . 
  advocating genocide would be against the rules and results in a ban . 
  supporting any group does not , even if that group is reasponsible for crimes . 
  that 's not quite how i remember it , although it 's close .

  a * rosette * in german is [ mostly this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fensterrose ) , or [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosette_%28ornamentik%29 ) , or [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/blattrosette ) , or [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a4cherrosette ) , or of course the place [ rosette ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosette_%28%c3%84gypten%29 ) where that [ famous stone ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/stein_von_rosette ) was found . 
  but it can also be a slang word for anus , used [ mostly by rappers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcqid9_tjy&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=74 ) . 
  if anybody is offended because you talk about rosetta stone , tear them a new one .

  edit : links zu quellen, 
   what a lot of people do n't realize when they gush about the german higher education system is that it works because the slots are limited, 
  that 's true only for a limited number of subjects , e.g. 
  medicine . 
  for most subjects ( e.g. 
  law , economics , anything stem ) you just need an average high school degree ( `` abitur '' ) for most universities , and there are some universities where any abitur will do . 
  that 's a much * smaller * problem than reddit thinks it is . 
  [ quoting the epa  ( http://www2.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder ), 
   colony collapse disorder is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen , plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees and the queen . 
  ** once thought to pose a major long term threat to bees , reported cases of ccd have declined substantially over the last five years . 
  ** the number of hives that do not survive over the winter months -- the overall indicator for bee health -- has maintained an average of about 30.5 percent since 2008 . 
  while winter losses remain relatively high , the number of those losses attributed to ccd has dropped from roughly 60 percent of total hives lost in 2008 to 31.1 percent in 2013 . 
  if some 30 percent of all beehives keep dying every winter ( instead of the expected 15-20 % ) , then that 's a bit of a nuissance , but not really a problem to anybody . 
   thus italy always leaves the empire which does n't make any sense historically . 
  but the hre did historically lose its control over northern italy at some time between 1500 and 1600 , did n't it ? 
  i think it 's already rather generous of the eu4 that switzerland remains a part of the empire forever . 
  where 'd you get that number ? 
  it was correct in 1985 , but the number has increased almost every year since then . 
  [ [ german wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/abiturientenquote_und_studienanf%c3%a4ngerquote ) ], 
  in 2010 , 49 % of all people finished school with the abitur . 
  the number has increased to slightly above 50 % since then . 
  of the kids who finished primary school last year , 43.9 % went to a * gymnasium * , and 10 . % to a * gemeinschaftsschule * ( which also offer * abitur * , although some of their students are likely to leave school with a lower level degree ] . 
  it was more of an [ overall ** increase ** than an overall decline . 
  ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jonentine/files/2014/05/global-beehives.png ), 
  except locally , beekeepers were always able to replace the losses . 
  creating new beehives is n't exactly difficult . 
  it was deleted there for being just too plain stupid . 
  that 's really quite an achievement , is n't it ?
