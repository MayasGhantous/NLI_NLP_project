  the correct , standard-language way of saying that title would be `` der dativ ist der tod des genitivs '' . 
  the title is a slang variant , and another such variant would be `` der dativ ist der tod vom genitiv '' . 
  - it 's not that you ** should ** use that , but some germans will . 
  i met my mother 's cousin for the first time when he was in his 80 's and i was in my 20 's .

  this is probably not true anymore if the relatedness is so distant that you do n't even know exactly * how * you are related , or if there 's an extreme hierarchial difference that matters in some way - e.g. , you 're a student at a university where your distant relative happens to be a professor .

  learn how to swim , you 're not too old for that !,

  so you barely have to do anything to stay afloat , learning to swim is 90 % psychology . 
  `` fl\u00fcgel von freiheit '' does n't really mean anything . 
  at least , i would n't know how to use it in a sentence . 
  too bad you can only give one option for which side you support . 
  i think whether or not you support the kurds has little to do with which side you support in the `` original '' conflict between the assad government and the rebels .

  i 'm german , and i do love the paternosters . 
  you never have to wait for the lift to arrive or for the doors to close , it does n't stop at every floor for someone to get on or off , but simply keeps moving . 
  even though it moves slowly , it ends up bring faster than a regular lift most of the times . 
  i can see why they are rarely used anyore - ca n't transport anything like a stroller or a large suitcase , impossible to use if you 're in a wheelchair - but for many uses , a paternoster is just great - efficient * and * fun . 
  that 's what all the girls say ... 
  do n't think so . 
  depending on context , you might just describe this as a * desecration * . 
  works best for the fresh snow , i think , and is also possible in german as `` entweihung '' or `` sch\u00e4ndung '' . 
  although it 's probably a bit too much in most cases .

  as a german who thinks we are taking in way too many asylum seekers at the moment : yes , i think so . 
  people fleeing from syria are doing so for a legitimate reason . 
  i hope we can send most of them back home in a few years , but for now , we should take them in and treat them well ( and watch some of them closely ) . 
  just to clarify why these numbers are so low ( compared to some other recently reported numbers ) : they are only for the first half of the year , and they do n't include a large number ( ~ 100,000 ) of asylum seekers who we know are in germany but have n't officially filed their asylum application yet . 
  wg-gesucht is your best chance . 
  search for anything containing the word `` zwischenmiete '' - this means somebody is only leaving their place for a few months ( often students doing an exchange semester or something like this ) and only want somebody in there for that period . 
  i think you 'll find this most commonly in wgs .

  this is really interesting because of australia 's policy to not let any [ illegal immigrants stay in the country .

  a huge part of it is how news work in westeros . 
  we know tyrion better than anyone in westeros does . 
  for what most people `` know '' about him , read again what oberyn thought before seeing him ( as a babe ) :, 
  `` you were said to have [ ... ] a stiff curly tail like a swine 's . 
  your head was monstrous huge , we heard , half again the size of your body , and you had been born with thick black hair and a beard besides , an evil eye , and lion 's claws . 
  your teeth were so long you could not close your mouth , and between your legs were a girl 's privates as well as a boy 's . '', 
  would you marry your daughter to ** that ** ? 
  would you respect anyone who did ? 
  would you seriously believe that tywin would ever let that monkey-demon inherit his title and lands ? 
  plus , given that he was reported to be a hermaphrodite , most people would have expected tyrion to be infertile , which would make marriage to him pointless . 
   he 's the patron saint of law enforcement,

  most importantly , because people do n't build * new * houses when they are n't allowed to sell or lease these houses at their actual market value , but ( might ) have to settle for something much lower .

  far too many people want to live in ny -  prices go up . 
  if you ca n't afford living in new york , at least you know that the people who do live there pay a lot for that privilege . 
   and this is why every 20-something i know bought a house instead of renting . 
  with what money ? 
  i * think * you 'd need more downpayment than that in germany - but i 'll have to find out more about that . 
  i do n't relly understand why this post is downvoted . 
  i actually agree with the suggestion , even though i 'm not sure if it was meant purely rhetorical . 
  we * should * introduce legal ways for ( some ! ), 
  syrian refugees to come to germany , and the best places for registration facilities would be turkey or lebanon . 
  crack down on people smuggling and illegal immigration , but allow legal ways to find asylum . 
   take everyone directly from turky, 
  no way i would support that . 
  decide on a number , say 100,000 per year , and get these from turkey . 
  send everybody who comes into the country illegally back to wherever they came from . 
   all candidates benefit from being vague and riding the line on most corner issues . 
  ** most voters are single issue voters deep down ** and you eliminate some people from your camp whenever you clearly take sides . 
  i 've never really thought about it like that . 
  i believe you are right . 
   building shortages :, 
   when the bank has no houses to sell , players wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell his/her houses the bank before building . 
   if there are a limited number of houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more than the bank has , the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest bidder .

   the germans are all saying the german economy needs these guys . 
  the germans who are saying this have no clue what they are talking about . 
  the german economy does * not * need several 100,000 poorly educated workers per year . 
  i 'm not against granting asylum to many syrian refugees . 
  but people who use economic arguments to justify this are obviously clueless about both asylum and economics . 
  to prevent the german population from shrinking , you 'd need fewer than 200,000 immigrants per year . 
  asylum is not immigration and was never meant to be , even though many people do n't seem to get the difference . 
  if we do treat the asylum seekers set to arrive within the year like immigrants , that 's already enough immigration for the rest of the decade .
