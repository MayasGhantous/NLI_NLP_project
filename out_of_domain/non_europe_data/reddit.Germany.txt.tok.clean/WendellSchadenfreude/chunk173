  that way , people will already know what to expect when clicking the link , and nobody will be confused or disappointed because they 've never seen anything similar in their own ( vanilla ) game . 
  + shift to cycle in the opposite direction, 
  probably text-to-speech , although there are several methods . 
  blind people * can * use computers . 
  [ here 's a video explaining some of the basics . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzffnbbex6c ), 
  seemed like 2-3 weeks 2-3 months ago . 
  nope , this is simply a counting error . 
  expansions :, 
  conquest of paradise, 
  wealth of nations, 
  res publica, 
  art of war, 
  common sense, 
  if i had to pick the `` major expansions '' from that list , i would take only the ones named after famous writings : wealth of nations , art of war , common sense . 
   some people might be indicted and may go to prison , but anyone senior would be pardoned . 
  no way in hell . 
  as long as there is still anyone around who could be pardoned , there would also still be thousands of people who escaped from the wtc , tens of thousands who lost friends or family when the towers collapsed . 
  and these are n't powerless members of some disenfranchised minority like the tuskegee blacks , but people who are often enough in positions of power themselves , or at least know people who are . 
  if it were shown at any point within the next 20 years that the us government organized 9/11 ( which it did n't , of course ) , there would be death penalties for all mayor players and long prison sentences for anyone involved in any way . 
  nobody in politics would even think about protecting them . 
  even if the rules * were * the same , there is still one crucial difference : in the eyes of isis , this is a contract between their government and * all of their * christian subjects . 
  if a christian beats his muslim neighbor in a private argument ( an aggression against a muslim , the `` non-controversial rule '' ) , that contract has been violated by `` the christians '' - and there can thus be some form of collective punishment . 
  if that 's something that some western racists want for muslims , i 've never heard of it . 
  another difference is of course that the ancestors of these christians has been living in the area for longer than islam has even existed , while the vast majority of muslims in the west are recent immigrants . 
   islamic relative-tolerance towards `` people of the book '' is not the issue, 
  oh , it sure is * an * issue . 
   that way , the mechanic continues to work in the same way as the nation gets bigger in size . 
  why would you want it to ? 
  in a small nations , la should go down in * all * provinces . 
  in a large nation , it should do so only in the core areas , but decrease very slowly in provinces further away - or actually * increase * . 
  i really like this idea , if you scale it with distance to the capital . 
  bigger nations have a more difficult time keeping their far-away provinces under control . 
  if you only control , say , portugal , la should gradually go down in all your provinces . 
  if you conquer additional lands in central spain , la in your core areas should n't be affected - but it should go down more slowly in the new areas . 
  if your empire stretches all the way to the pyrenees , la in the easternmost provinces should n't go down at all unless you lower it manually , and if you also control some italian provinces , la all the way over there should slowly increase all the time . 
  maybe troops stationed in a province could prevent la from going up . 
  i just think this idea makes more sense if it * does n't * scale . 
  all provinces near your capital ( up to five provinces away or something like that ) use local autonomy as it is now . 
  all areas five-ten provinces away still have gradually decreasing la , but the decrease is slower . 
  more than ten provinces away from the capital : no decrease at all . 
  more than twenty provinces : slow increase , unless you have troops stationed in the province . 
  ( numbers chosen at semi-random for illustration . 
  using the distance calculation that the game already has makes more sense , of course . ), 
  `` every time senior members of the american government killed thousands of americans on live television '' has n't ever happened yet . 
  exactly , `` sie '' is simply more polite . 
  it 's also combined with a person 's last name , while you use the first name for people you call `` du '' . 
  ( with very few exceptions . ), 
  `` sie '' ( polite * you * ) should n't be confused with `` sie '' ( * they * ) . 
  it 's more important when thinking about future immigrants . 
  if they do n't allow some voodoo rituals , that does n't affect anyone currently living there - and practioners of voodoo can at least decide to move somewhere else instead . 
  but the christians are already there , and there is no reason at all why these rules should apply to them . 
  this might be the greatest video i 've ever seen . 
  or i might be a little tipsy , and the video is just ok . 
  but i did enjoy it . 
  yes . 
  i hope assad wins , turns into a second gandhi , embraces love and equal rights for all , kicks out religious fanatics and hands out free cookies to everyone . 
  my hope is just as unrealistic as yours . 
   if a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her , and he writes her a certificate of divorce , gives it to her and sends her from his house , and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man , and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce , gives it to her and sends her from his house , or if he dies , then her first husband , who divorced her , is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled . 
  that would be detestable in the eyes of the lord . 
  do not bring sin upon the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance . 
  such a weird book . 
  yes , he does . 
  i did n't know about his background until now . 
  i thought he sounded somewhat strange , but i always thought that that was just his way of rapping , i never thought that he sounded like a foreigner . 
  just noticed on that map that afrin also has a `` lovers ' forest '' , just like kobane . 
  is that a kurdish thing , or also common in the rest of syria ? 
  are these forest planted or natural ? 
  are they actually used as a sort of couples ' retreat , or does the name mean something else entirely ? 
  where do you get the idea that a government victory would lead to more refugees than a government defeat ? 
  people are fleeing from * war * , not from assad . 
  if either side crushes the other ( s ) , there will be some additional refugees fleeing from the victor 's cruelties . 
  there is no reason to believe that this will be any less the case if the rebels win . 
  at least with assad , you 're not his enemy simply based on your sect , as long as you are n't involved in politics . 
  the dublin rules were suspended before the truck with the dead refugees was found . 
  there 's a well-known [ group of speedrunners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_club ) that say a playthrough should take less than 30 years . 
  it already took me longer than that and i feel like i still have a lot to explore . 
  i think speedruns are n't for me . 
  1 means that you are an american with german ancestors , e.g. 
  your parents or grandparents were germans . 
  2 might mean the same thing , but more likely means that you were born a german and became an american at some point in your life . 
   we saved a shitload of money in that time . 
  that is true !, 
  dammit . 
   everybody here is screaming `` numbers , numbers , money , money '', 
  if your only answer to people using numbers is an appeal to emotions , it looks like they might be right about the numbers . 
   reading the article , i also wondered , how did the robbers know they were jewish ? 
  his name is [ shmuel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shmuel ) . 
  if that name is on the doorbell or the letter box , it does n't get much more obvious than that . 
  i noticed last week on a map that afrin also has a `` lovers ' forest '' , just like kobane . 
  is that a kurdish thing , or also common in the rest of syria ? 
  are these forest planted or natural ? 
  are they actually used as a sort of couples ' retreat , or does the name mean something else entirely ? 
  they * have * a country , that 's why they are called `` syrian '' refugees . 
  not in the ones that are currently coming . 
  close to 80 % are young men . 
   97 % of the population can read and write . 
  [ 99.8 % , actually . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate ) - literacy rates are typically measured only in the population above age 15 , so the missing 0.2 % might just be people with some psychological disability . 
  [ 4 elections actually .
