  ] ( http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/ ) ( qj adams , rb hayes , b harrison , gw bush ) - the fact that americans can be so nonchalant about this is quite educational , by the way : it shows that proper democracy is the rule of law much more than it is the rule of the majority . 
   but sharaa is hourani, 
  for those wondering : that means [ he 's from the region of houran/hauran . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hauran ) bascially : the southwest . 
  wow . 
  i was expecting a few dozen planes , but those have to be thousands . 
  this is a confession , this is an opinion . 
  believe me : bacon and beer are ok even if * all * your income comes from them . 
  actually , it makes them even better . 
  how is that a hint at twilight ? 
  exactly . 
  the popular opinion puffin was banned because it 's boring to read about people 's oh-so-edgy opinions . 
   as bush delivers his voice-over in the ad , a headline appears : florida `` led the nation in job creation from 2000 to 2007 . '' that lops off the first year of bush 's governorship , and by that standard , florida just edges california in total jobs created . 
  yep . 
  that warrants at most one `` pinocchio '' , as the claim is mostly true - just a somewhat selective telling of truth . 
  thanks . 
  or could we maybe ** not ** have such a sticky until we know if this is actually true ? 
  it 's great if you feel as safe as always , and it 's sad if some people do n't , but we ca n't know how safe germany actually * is * until we see some statistics , and that will take a couple of months . 
  you claim that germany is as safe as it was ( e.g. ), 
  last year , because you * wish * this to be true , not because you actually * know * wether or not it is . 
  [ true . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/map_of_the_german_empire_-_1914.png ) but the gif is right that these were never formally part of the empire , they legally were just * possessions . 
  i do n't think that 's quite the same . 
  in the soviet union , there were other countries beside russia , but there were no other countries beside germany in the german empire . 
  there also was no `` nation above germany '' in the german empire , germany * was * the empire . 
  [ deutsch-s\u00fcdwestafrika ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_south-west_africa ) was n't a country , it was simply some land that germany owned without it being part of germany . 
  it 's similar to the way that germany might own its foreign embassies , but they are still part of their host countries - except that there was no host country in the german colonies . 
  they were into that alright . 
  mostly , this is a legal distinction without a real difference - although it might have made a difference at some point if germany had n't lost the colonies at the end of wwi . 
  the french had an extreme understanding of the legal status of their colonies : the colonies were part of france exactly as much as any part of mainland france . 
  even today , [ french guyana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_guiana ) has the same legal status as [ aquitaine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aquitaine ) or any other french region . 
  the german view was the opposite extreme : the colonies were not part of germany , they were not really part of any country , they were just some lands that germany happened to own . 
  germany has about [ 150k-200k fewer births than deaths every year . 
  ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2015/08/pd15_302_126.html;jsessionid=7c2aa53420606286f4c7af5544f420aa.cae1 ) with 200k immigrants per year , the population would remain stable . 
  the willingness to accept many more than that ca n't be explained very well with the ageing society . 
  as a german , i think this is probably necessary . 
  but thanks to our public statements in the past few weeks , it 's also incredibly embarassing ... 
   lots of other countries , not just russia . 
  that 's what i said . 
   the nation of germany was a nation within the german empire , which was technically above it . 
  that 's just not true . 
  `` german empire '' was the name of germany at the time . 
  just as the federal republic of germany today * is * germany and not just some state within germany , so the empire also * was * germany . 
   the basic law knows no limits on asylum seekers . 
  the basic law grants asylum only to those who are politically persecuted , and only if they did n't enter through some other eu state . 
  by the basic law , germany has no legal obligation to accept any syrian refugees . 
  i still think we should accept many , but i ca n't stand it when people claim that we are obligated to take anyone who shows up . 
  just have a look at the emperor 's full title :, 
   his imperial and royal majesty william ii , by the grace of god , german emperor and king of prussia , margrave of brandenburg , burgrave of nuremberg , count of hohenzollern , duke of silesia and of the county of glatz , grand duke of the lower rhine and of posen , duke of saxony , of angria , of westphalia , of pomerania and of lunenburg , duke of schleswig , of holstein and of crossen , duke of magdeburg , of bremen , of guelderland and of j\u00fclich , cleves and berg , duke of the wends and the kashubians , of lauenburg and of mecklenburg , landgrave of hesse and in thuringia , margrave of upper and lower lusatia , prince of orange , of rugen , of east friesland , of paderborn and of pyrmont , prince of halberstadt , of m\u00fcnster , of minden , of osnabr\u00fcck , of hildesheim , of verden , of kammin , of fulda , of nassau and of moers , princely count of henneberg , count of the mark , of ravensberg , of hohenstein , of tecklenburg and of lingen , count of mansfeld , of sigmaringen and of veringen , lord of frankfurt . 
  every little holding of his in germany is mentionend ( all part of germany , or small countries `` under germany '' , if you will ) - but not a word about africa . 
  queen victoria 's title was remarkably short by comparison , and yet it mentions at least one of her holdings that was separate from the uk and , as you describe it , just happened to be also ruled by her . 
   her majesty victoria , by the grace of god , of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland queen , defender of the faith , empress of india . 
  the germans could of course have decided to * make * south-west africa a country , and name wilhelm ii `` german emperor and king of namibia '' or something like that - but they did n't . 
   it increases the chance that the west intervenes and deposes assad, 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  the more the russians engage in syria , the * less * likely it becomes that the west will attack assad . 
  would be far to messy if western bombs happened to kill some russian `` advisors '' . 
   i promptly ended the game and deleted the safe file . 
  i can not understand why people do this . 
  so you lost a war to venice as the ottoman empire - what are they gon na do ? 
  they take a few of your provinces , at worst force you to release bulgaria or something . 
  so what ? 
  you just turn around and secure anatolia , conquer egypt , subdue mesopotamia - and then , when the peace treaties have run out , when venice has carelessly broken the alliance with france , when hungary and austria are at war and the commonwealth is engulfed in rebellions : you turn your attention back to europe and show those fools not to mess with turkey !, 
  there 's nothing more glorious than finally taking revenge on an old enemy . 
  the game is n't half that much fun when you just smoothly conquer the world without ever meeting serious resistance . 
  going on holidays together ( just the two of you ) can happen if you are just friends , but it would be unusual . 
  he 's probably into you and just feels the same way that he does n't want to jeopardize the friendship , so here 's what you do : touch his forearm when you talk to him . 
  if he does n't actively pull away , he 's interested and might get the confidence to actually do something about it . 
  beside that , just dress nice when you meet him , and sit close to him when watching a movie together . 
  invite me to the wedding . 
  touch topless topmodels !, 
  if i heard about two of my acquaintances who went on a holiday together , i would immediately ask if they are a couple . 
  if they are not , i would still assume that at least one of them wants to change that . 
  a man and a woman in germany * can * go on a holiday together without being a couple , but i do n't think it 's very common . 
  of course , our social circles might just be different when it comes to this . 
  it \u00b4 s actually not an apostrophe , it \u00b4 s an acute accent . 
  op , what keyboard layout do you use ? 
  the apostrophe is most likely to the left of your `` enter '' key . 
  accidental touches are n't the same as obviously intentional touches . 
  when sitting together with one of his buddies , he 's certainly not worried about possibly sitting to close to them . 
  touching his forearm is the sweet spot that still gives you plausible deniability , but will likely be clear enough as a signal to him . 
  if you do n't want to try this , you either have to let it go , or sit him down and tell him that you need to talk to him . 
  that should be enough to make a decent-sized chair out of them . 
   [ what if it does n't work out ? 
   [ ah , but what if it does . 
  that 's not much of a problem , supplies just need an hour longer at most . 
  [ you can easily check that yourself on google maps . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bn8dadx.png ) ( note : i 'm not suggesting that these exakt routes were or will be used by the government . ), 
  the main problem for the regime is the question that this loss poses : if they ca n't defend the outskirts of damascus against a force that has been besieged since forever - what * can * they defend ? 
  not much changes . 
  supplies get a little more complicated , but not that much . 
  [ you can easily check that yourself on google maps . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bn8dadx.png ) ( note : i 'm not suggesting that these exakt routes were or will be used by the government . ), 
  people love having one quick look at a map and seeing this big strategic opportunity , but it 's probably not there . 
  from what i hear , the government had n't been using the m5 for a while anyway , because it was already within the range of enemy arms . 
  does n't change the meaning at all . 
  to my ears , it 's slightly more polite to ask for things using `` gerne '' , although `` ich m\u00f6chte ... '' is polite enough for any context already . 
  `` ich m\u00f6chte ( gerne ) das wiener schnitzel mit pommes '' is how you might order food in a restaurant . 
  whether or not you include the `` gerne '' does n't change anything .
