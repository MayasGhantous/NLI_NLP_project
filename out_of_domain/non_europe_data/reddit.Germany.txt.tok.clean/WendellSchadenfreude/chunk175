   with kind regards, 
   winston, 
  it 's a signature . 
  it does n't `` mean '' anything , but does to an extent show the level of respect you have for the addressee . 
  in this case , chruchill was being extremely polite . 
  it may come as a surprise to you , but the majority of mexicans does * not * die in drug wars . 
   ai n't nobody tryna see yo nasty feet !, 
  have you heard of * socks * ? 
  they are these amazingly soft cloth-shoes that you can wear under your regular shoes . 
  you can take off your shoes and keep wearing your socks when entering a house !, 
   one by the common name , the other by the scientists it 's named after ( ... right ? ), 
  not quite . 
  [ baader and meinhof ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) were the founders of the red army faction , a german terrorist organization in the 1970 's . 
  using their name for the frequency illusion is just a joke . 
   the st. paul minnesota pioneer press online commenting board was the unlikely source of the name . 
  in 1994 , a commenter dubbed the frequency illusion `` the baader-meinhof phenomenon '' after randomly hearing two references to baader-meinhof within 24 hours . 
  the phenomenon has nothing to do with the gang , in other words . 
  ** of course ** i wear socks every day , and absolutely everybody else around here does , too . 
  ( here = germany ), 
  not wearing socks is definitely a warm-country-thing . 
  and it would completely mess up my rules , because i agree that i do n't want visitors to walk around my place barefooted . 
  i know that within europe , taking off your shoes when entering a home is the norm in most northern countries , but unusual in the south , so that seems to confirm it :, 
  warm country - keep your shoes on . 
  cold country - wear socks , take your shoes off whne entering a home . 
  japan - entirely different rules , including special bathroom shoes . 
  almost any `` historic fact '' that starts with `` in medieval times ... '' can be safely discarded . 
  op 's talking about a period of 1,000 years and is n't even giving a location , so i assume it 's all of europe . 
  ( outside of europe , the term `` middle ages '' is n't really applicable . ), 
  if you ca n't narrow it down any more than that , you obviously have no reliable data on anything . 
   in 1992 the north atlantic cod biomass collapsed and fell 99 % in 1 year . 
  that 's 1 percent of the previous year, 
  source for that , please . 
  because wikipedia does n't sound quite as dramatic :, 
   several cod stocks collapsed in the 1990s ( declined by  95 % of maximum historical biomass ) and have failed to recover even with the cessation of fishing . 
  - it 's `` several cod stocks '' , not the entire north atlantic . 
  - it 's 95 % , not 99 % . 
  - it 's from the historic maximum , not from the previous year . 
  - it 's the early 90 's , not one specific year . 
  do n't get me wrong , that 's still worrysome enough , and definitely something that needs/needed to be addressed . 
  edit : found what you were talking about : the [ collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collapse_of_the_atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery ) . 
  wow , that really sounds dramatic . 
  it was limited to canada though . 
  - anyway , i think we agree that overfishing is something that needs to be addressed , and that only governments can really do anything about it . 
   the graph on that wiki page is of landings not biomass , and that can collapse suddenly due to a moratorium, 
  yeah , the wikipedia graphs are really quite terrible . 
  because a moratorium did happen , on [ july 2 , 1992 ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/cod-fishing-the-biggest-layoff-in-canadian-history ) , and you ca n't see in the graphs how much the landings declined before that . 
  * of course * they collapsed completely in 1992 , the year of the moratorium - when people are n't allowed to catch fish anymore , far less fish is caught . 
  there probably was a dramatic decline even before the moratorium , but the graphs are n't useful at showing that . 
  according to wikipedia , [ summer temperatures in athens , greece , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/athens#climate ) are actually pretty much the same as [ temperatures in phuket , thailand . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_thailand#climate ) greece * does * have a winter , with mean daily temperatures as low as 10 \u00b0 c ( 50 \u00b0 f ) , while thailand is just hot all year long - but when it comes to the extreme heat , the difference is n't all that big . 
  although it 's probably harder to deal with in thailand , because it 's often wet & hot , while greece is usually dry . 
  [ temperatures in bangkok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bangkok#climate ) are still pretty much the same as summer temperatures in athens . 
  from my northern point of view , these places are * both * uninhabitable . 
  at the very least , they both warrant a siesta to avoid the worst heat . 
  that website mostly refers to the exact same website that op already linked to , and to a bbc article about ekirch , the guy who made all this up . 
  all the references in the bible seem to be pretty ambiguous . 
  take this one for instance :, 
   about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god , and the other prisoners were listening to them . 
  suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken . 
  at once all the prison doors flew open , and everyone 's chains came loose . 
  the jailer woke up , [ ... ], 
  so paul and the other prisoners were awake , but the jailer was sleeping . 
  they are in the `` inner cell '' and probably have no way of knowing what time it is , while the jailer is the only person who is in a normal situation . 
  if anything , i think this passage confirms that normal people at the time were * not * up at midnight . 
  also : `` medieval times '' - and you start talking about the bible ... 
  that 's the part that was already in op 's link . 
  it 's a medieval source at least , yey !, 
  unfortunately , i do n't really understand middle english . 
  if you can find me a translation [ of the entire passage ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=e4dxd7sk7wcc&amp;pg=pa173&amp;dq=chaucer+%22firste+sleep%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cduq6aewa2ovchmi67rl1uh7xwivx7nych2a7aid#v=onepage&amp;q=chaucer%20%22firste%20sleep%22&amp;f=false ) ( say 360-390 ) , i might have an opinion on this passage . 
  but even then : * one * mention in chaucer . 
  we already know that some people sometimes get up in the middle of the night even today , so you can definitely expect some references to this in the literature . 
  but if this were something that most people in most places did most of the time until ~ 1900 , we 'd expect lots of references to it everywhere . 
  get back to studying engineering , it does n't get much more german than that !, 
  ( seriously , that 's probably possible . ), 
  welcome to germany , i hope your family will be happy here . 
  it 's really sad having these discussions , because people with the best intentions like yourself are exactly the problem with merging lanes . 
  people * should n't * `` get over first chance they get '' . 
  normal considerate human beings who actually know how traffic works do n't do that . 
  you are supposed to merge at the * last * chance you get - at the point where your own lane ends . 
  and at that point , if you are in the lane that is being continued , you let everybody in who is trying to merge , no matter what you think about them , because everything else is dangerous . 
  i do n't doubt that you are a considerate driver who is interested in fairness and safety on the road - but in these situations , you are still in the wrong , and your behavior is making traffic worse for everyone . 
  merge when the lane closes , not before !, 
  it 's tragic having these discussions , because people like you certainly have the best intentions , but you are sadly still in the wrong . 
  you can only alternate teeth when there * are * teeth in both lanes , right up to the point where you are supposed to merge . 
  when a tooth in a real zipper `` merges early '' , the zipper gets stuck . 
  when two lanes merge , * please * use both lanes until the end - it 's the fairest and most efficient method for everybody on the road . 
  the drivers slowing down traffic and making the situation unfair and more dangerous for everybody are the ones who merge early .
