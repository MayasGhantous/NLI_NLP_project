  use both lanes . 
  merge at the merge point . 
  merging before that point makes everything worse - it 's inefficient , unfair , and more dangerous for everybody involved . 
  yeah , assholes will merge at the merge point whether they are good drivers or not . 
  but good drivers will also always merge at the merge point , whether they are assholes or not . 
  people who merge before that are probably good people , but they are certainly bad drivers , and whether they believe it or not : their choice is inefficient , unfair , and dangerous . 
  [ here 's what it looks like in real traffic . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpby71tnc0 ) ( minnesota department of transportation ), 
  zipper merging is the most efficient , fair , and safe method for combining two lanes . 
  always use both lanes until the very end - the drivers who are making the unfair and dangerous choice are the ones who merge early . 
  it 's tragic having these discussions , because people like you certainly have the best intentions , but you are sadly still in the wrong . 
  when two lanes merge , please use both lanes until the end - it 's the fairest and most efficient method for everybody on the road . 
  the drivers slowing down traffic and making the situation unfair and more dangerous for everybody are the ones who merge early .

  they may be considerate people , but they are still bad drivers . 
  if you are a good , considerate person * and * a good driver , you will merge at the merge point , not a half mile before . 
  granted , you will also do that if you are a bad driver and an asshole - but only bad drivers will merge before their lane ends .

  if you can keep your head when all about you, 
  are losing theirs and blaming it on you ,, 
  if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you ,, 
  but make allowance for their doubting too ;, 
  if you can wait and not be tired by waiting ,, 
  or being lied about , do n't deal in lies ,, 
  or being hated , do n't give way to hating ,, 
  and yet do n't look too good , nor talk too wise :, 
  if you can dream -- and not make dreams your master ;, 
  if you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim ;, 
  if you can meet with triumph and disaster, 
  and treat those two impostors just the same ;, 
  if you can bear to hear the truth you 've spoken, 
  twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools ,, 
  or watch the things you gave your life to , broken ,, 
  and stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools :, 
  if you can make one heap of all your winnings, 
  and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss ,, 
  and lose , and start again at your beginnings, 
  and never breathe a word about your loss ;, 
  if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew, 
  to serve your turn long after they are gone ,, 
  and so hold on when there is nothing in you, 
  except the will which says to them : `` hold on ! '', 
  if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue ,, 
  or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch ,, 
  if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you ,, 
  if all men count with you , but none too much ;, 
  if you can fill the unforgiving minute, 
  with sixty seconds ' worth of distance run ,, 
  yours is the earth and everything that 's in it ,,

  it 's difficult to not let your emotions get the best of you when you 're actually stuck in traffic - but we 're not in traffic now and should try to find the method that is * actually * best for everybody . 
  i do n't have to tell myself that the late merge is best - it 's what almost all the experts agree on .

   but what most traffic experts say about merging will sting . 
  the person who drove up the empty lane was merging properly . 
  and that backup you 're sitting in ? 
  it was caused by drivers like you who merged too early . 
   the late merge -- also known as the zipper merge -- has proved to be the safest and most-efficient way of merging highway traffic into one lane , experts say .

   this week , however , washington state joined minnesota in sending a clear message to drivers : merge rudely . 
  it 's actually faster and safer . 
  [ or wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merge_%28traffic%29 ) ( even though they do n't believe in higher throughput , they still say it 's safer and fairer . ), 
   governments hold campaigns to promote the late merge method because irritation , aggression and feelings of insecurity easily occur while `` zipping '' . 
  often drivers who change lanes too early do n't like to see other drivers continue until the end of the drop-away lane , even though this late merging is encouraged by the authorities . 
  luckily , i come from a country where this correct merging behavior is encouraged and widely accepted . 
  the driver who uses the lane that is still open until the very end * is * in the correct lane , that 's the point . 
  and you might think it 's more dangerous , but few experts agree .

   now we see why rebels are fighting for zabadani until the last bullet . 
  the rebels in zabadani are not connected to the ones in east ghouta , and certainly were n't informed of this offensive during the past few months during which they kept fighting . 
  well , obviously : follow the law . 
  but if late merging is allowed in your jurisdiction , use late merging !, 
  and if it is n't , try to get the laws changed , because zippers are the bee 's knees . 
  they making driving far more enjoyable , even when you are in the lane that is being merged into . 
  when you are a good person and a good driver and the law allows it , you will always merge late .
