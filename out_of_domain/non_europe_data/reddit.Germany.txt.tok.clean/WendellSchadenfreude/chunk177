  no need to change any letters at all . 
  [ the thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thing_%28assembly%29 ) now possesses all the power and wisdom of an assembly of viking warriors . 
  i have no idea what this is about , but i still kind of like it . 
  so , eli5 , what am i looking at in that video ? 
  is the story that the lady is telling true ? 
  oh , uhm ... yes . 
  ** yes , i absolutely love it ! ** . 
  ^ ^ really , ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ just ^ ^ ok . 
  ... tell my wife `` hello '' ... 
  it was ... it was * you * all along ? 
  * / u/wendellschadenfreude dies * - press f to pay respects, 
  i reported this video as a violation of rule 4 , because it 's clearly intended for recruitment purposes . 
  we should n't spread stuff like this .

  [ house of david ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/davidic_line ) , you heretics . 
   the davidic line ( also referred to as the ** house of david ** ) [ ... ] refers to the tracing of lineage to the king david referred to in the hebrew bible and in the new testament . 
   [ ... ] in christian interpretation the `` davidic promise '' of a davidic line in 2 samuel 7 is understood in various ways , traditionally referring to the genealogies of christ in the new testament . 
  one christian interpretation of the davidic line counts the line continuing to jesus of nazareth via adoption of joseph of nazareth , according to the family tree of the kings of judah in gospel of matthew chapter 1 . 
  reading all this makes me so gay . 
  with a master of education degree in physics and computer science , i 'm confident that you can easily find a teaching job at a school . 
  just google something like `` quereinstieg/seiteneinstieg lehrer '' + your bundesland , and you will find more information . 
  i think physics teachers in most parts of germany are in such high demand that they will be willing to bend all the rules for you . 
  ( you would n't be a `` lehrer '' immediately , just a `` referendar '' ( ~ student teacher , trainee teacher ) for a year or so . ), 
  the [ `` l\u00e4nder '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_%28deutschland%29 ) are responsible for education in germany . 
  i do n't think there 's anything centrally organized , since you 'll ( i believe ) essentially be treated like a career changer . 
  where in germany will you be moving ? 
  if you google `` quereinsteig lehrer nrw '' , you find [ this ] ( https://www.schulministerium.nrw.de/docs/lehrkraftnrw/anerkennungsverfahren/seiteneinstiegberuf/index.html ) , or this for [ baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ] ( https://www.lehrer-online-bw.de/,lde/startseite/lobw/seiteneinstieg ) , and i 'm sure something similar for other l\u00e4nder . 
  your best course of action is to call one of the phone numbers there . 
  with a degree in physics , i 'm fairly certain you can find a teaching job almost anywhere in germany . 
  if the men are not allowed to leave fua/kafraya and there are no aid drops for six months , they 'd simply starve to death during that time . 
  there must be some other parts to this deal that we do n't know of yet , or it does n't make any sense at all . 
  might be . 
  so the rebels would let trucks bring food to these towns but control to for weapons , or something like that . 
  i wonder which side refused to simply have the towns evacuated instead - does the government want to keep control of the towns , or do the rebels want to keep the soldiers as almost-hostages ? 
   which then slights another show/film/actor in their prime . 
  so which show is being slighted at the moment ? 
  when the \u00e4 is n't available , do you also replace it with `` ae '' ( as we do in german ) ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  parties do n't stop being radical just because a lot of people vote for them . 
  in recent polls in saxony , afd is at 13 % and npd at 5 - that does n't make either party any more moderate , they are still a populist right-wing party and a right-wing extremist party , respectively . 
  oh god , please no . 
   tabletop gaming 1 , heavy metal music 2 , mmorpgs 3 , anime 4 , joss whedon projects 5 , comic books 6 , etc. 
  are you counting `` etc. '', 
  ( `` i 'm interested in all of these six things , but i have no interest in * anything * else - therefore , `` etc. '', 
  does n't apply to me ! '' ), 
  those are never used on the frontlines . 
  the risk of hitting your own troops would be far too high . 
  it 's spelled ( and pronounced ) [ russophobic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-russian_sentiment ) , no - i - in russo - . 
  so is there still fighting going on around marea , or has isis stopped the attacks at some point ? 
  have they tried to skip marea and attack tal rif ` at directly ? 
   the city is known for being one of our environmental strongholds, 
  when you google `` worst air quality germany '' ( in german ) , the first link is an article about stuttgart . 
  [ including this impressive picture . 
  ] ( http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/bild/1.2450378.1429859836/860x860/feinstaub-stuttgart-luftverschmutzung.jpg ) - granted , it 's only about `` feinstaub '' ( fine respirable dust ) , and i know that stuttgart is a clean city - but it 's news to me that stuttgart of all cities is known for having a healthy environment . 
  edit : i 'm aware that what you can see in the picture is mostly just fog . 
  still : worst air quality in germany . 
  even though that has little to do with immigration . 
  that sounds like a character you 're not supposed to play . 
  at the very least : not as a newbie . 
  [ like this ? 
  we , as a society , live longer and healthier , more peaceful and prosperous lifes than ever before . 
  i 'm one of them . 
  i agree that one side in this conflict is sectarian - all important rebel groups would make life very hard for any non-sunni . 
  but the other side is not sectarian - sunnis can and do live happy lives under government control . 
  i do n't think that qualifies as a sectarian war . 
  that article is quite confusingly written , but i think it does n't say what you are suggesting . 
   marshall himself visited vietnam to conduct studies similar to those done during world war ii and later emulated in korea . 
  he concluded that much had changed since those earlier conflicts and that ** it was not unusual for close to 100 percent of american infantrymen to engage the adversary during firefights in vietnam . 
  i doubt that the `` 3 in 10 '' number was ever accurate . 
  maybe it was for the americans in wwii , but if so , that conflict was the exception more likely than the rule . 
  i finished it . 
  it does n't say what you claim . 
  it starts with the `` 3 in 10 '' number , but later finds a `` nearly 2 in 10 '' instead - but the * opposite * `` 2 in 10 '' , meaning that more than 80 % of all soldiers ** did ** fire their personal weapon at least once . 
  after that , they go through lengthy eplanations of why 2 in 10 might not have fired their weapons , or why others might not have done so in specific situations , but they never claim a different number after that . 
  in the study that the author conducted personally , only nine out of 258 servicemen claimed never to have fired their weapon at the enemy . 
  if okcupid can be believed : it does for women , but not for men . 
  [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1hwzzgo.jpg ) shows the age of men whose pictures women found the most attractive , against the age of those women . 
  as you can see , women always prefer a man who is * roughly * their own age . 
  ( a few years older for younger women , a few years younger for women 40 + . ), 
  [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3g55v7u.jpg ) on the other hand shows the age of women whose picture was most attractive to men , depending on the age of those men - except that it * does n't * depend on the age of the men at all : the average man always thinks that women are the hottest in their early twenties . 
   ( i have never done that before ), 
  so , this is new . 
  it 's just called `` gravy '' on mars because it 's so much weaker . 
  `` so , jon , now that we are brothers , i have to tell you that i 'm actually your uncle , not your father . '', 
  it was n't a bad attempt , actually . 
  just for clarification : it 's also spelled differently in the uk ( etc. 
  it 's a reliops . 
  wait , you did that * on purpose * , out of pure self-interest ? 
  i spared you because i thought you were this fun , quirky little ewok , and it was actually all just fake ?
