  interfax - the russian orthodox church supported the decision to use the russian air force in syria . 
   `` this decision is consistent with international law , the mentality of our people and the special role that our country has always played in the middle east , '' - said the head of the synodal department \u00ee church and society relations archpriest vsevolod chaplin told journalists on wednesday . 
   pointing to the fact that today the russian government takes on a special role in resolving the situation in the middle east , he said that russia can not be indifferent to observe the current extermination of christians in the region , and other social groups . 
   the priest also said that the interreligious council of russia at a meeting in moscow on wednesday to take a statement in support of active operations in the country 's fight against terror in the middle east . 
   ** `` the fight against terrorism - is a sacred struggle , and today our country is perhaps the most active force in the world that fights with him because she has this self-interest , but because terrorism is immoral . 
  '' ** - he said . 
   earlier wednesday , the federation council has agreed to the president to use in syria russian air force . 
  however , as stressed in the federation council head of the kremlin administration , sergei ivanov , the use of the armed forces on the land theater of operations possible military objective of the operation is extremely air support of the syrian government forces in their counteraction lih . 
  nice work . 
  how did you do that ? 
  simply get out the magnifying glass and start searching ? 
  [ by military spending , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) russia and saudi arabia are either third and fourth , or fourth and third , depending on the source . 
  in other words : they are pretty much tied at $ 80bn per year . 
  sure , the saudis are world champions in spending money without much effect , but saudi arabia and turkey are still significant regional powers and could cause the russians a lot of trouble if they really wanted to . 
  of course . 
  nobody expects the saudis to attack the russians directly . 
  [ mapfrappe ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/ ) just let 's you draw an outline on a map and shows you the size of that outline on a different part of the map . 
  usefull if you want to compare something besides countries . 
  could you give us a quick ms paint sketch of the situation ? 
  i 'm having trouble picturing it . 
  i do n't think that 's correct . 
  turkey attacking kurds in syria would be big news - they would have put that in the headline . 
  i think the sentence you quote should be understood as `` launched ground attacks against, 
  - ( 1 ) the pkk ( in turkey and iraq ), 
  - ( 2 ) and islamic state in northern syria . '', 
  if you take a look [ at the longer article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/24/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-un-iduskcn0py2h820150724?mod=related&amp;channelname=worldnews ) about that statement that they link to , there 's no mention of attacks against the kurds in syria either . 
  very nice . 
  if you want this to show all airstrikes , i suggest you should show older ones in a different color and with a smaller symbol - make them small and pink after a week , tiny and yellow after two or something . 
  else the map will probably look too crowded soon . 
  so just to be sure i get this : jan attacked the kurds in sm last week , they pushed toward castello highway , a truce was negotiated - but jan kept firing mortars at sm , and now this is happening ? 
  the area was quiet for several months before that , right ? 
   turkey has given up their `` assad must go immediately '' stance , which is a huge development as erdogan was previously extremely uncompromising stance towards assad 's removal . 
  erdogan already [ conceded last week ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-transition-could-assad-turkeys-erdogan-155431961.html ) that a transition period might include assad . 
  interestingly , `` erdogan 's remarks [ ... ] came a day after he held talks with russian president vladimir putin '' . 
  the russian airplanes are very much part of this war . 
  they might be the decisive factor at the moment . 
  we also discussed american airplanes for a while back when the us airforce started bombing isis in kobane . 
  i 'm not even sure if you 're joking . 
  if elections in syria were held while assad is still in power , there is * no way * he would lose these elections , except maybe if he lets one of his cousins or friends run in his place . 
  assad would win a plurality of the vote even in fair elections - but there 's no reason to expect fair elections in syria any time soon . 
   would the fsa be allowed to vote ? 
  pick your own scenario . 
  if there were fair elections right now in syria with every syrian in syria ( for simplicity : let 's exclude syrians abroad ) casting one vote , assad would win simply based on the fact that he would gain  90 % of the vote in the pro-government camp , while there would be dozens of weak candidates splitting the opposition vote . 
  but more realistically : if elections are held while assad is still in power , he would win by gaining ~ 500 % of the vote in several parts of the country - i.e. 
  by fraud . 
  best case scenario : you easily `` take '' the whole border . 
  big whoop - unless you put up checkpoints every few hundred yards , it 's still an open border . 
  if you do , there are now thousands of checkpoints , and isis can chose any one of them for an attack with far superior numbers . 
   in europe , our slaves were white and black in equal numbers, 
  what country and time period are you even talking about ? 
  for this statement to be true , you will have to pick place , time , and definition of slavery quite exactly . 
  good wikipedia article : [ slavery in medieval europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_medieval_europe ), 
  you should n't feel stupid - the journalist who wrote it like that should . 
   the law is time-limited until march 2017, 
  i love this . 
  i wish most new laws had an expiration date after which they automatically become invalid unless they are actively renewed . 
  whether she meant to say it or whether she even realized what she was saying does n't matter : `` everybody 's welcome ! '', 
  was exactly what was heard in the camps in turkey and lebanon and a lot of other places , and if that was a misunderstanding , merkel so far did nothing to remedy it . 
  very good idea . 
  i find it somewhat hard to tell what size the circles actually are - `` is homs a * metropolis * or just a * big city * ? '', 
  - i think you could improve the map if you did n't use circles in all cases , but switched some of the categories to octagons or diamonds . 
  they have always controlled it , since the beginning of the war . 
  isis holds the eastern bank of the euphrates and some part of the old town on the western bank , government forces ( mostly republican guard ) control most of the western bank , including the airport . 
  isis controls all the surrounding land . 
  what is all that stuff on the ground ? 
  just to be sure i understand : they are running on a laptop that you brought with you to germany , right ? 
  you 're fine . 
  torrenting is dangerous in germany , but not * that * dangerous . 
  especially if these are really just documentaries , there probably is n't even anyone trying to enforce the copyright . 
  if there is and they did happen to catch your ip , it would still probably lead to nothing - most lawyers are in this for some easy money , and complications ( like having to find a hotel guest or somebody in a foreign country ) would make it not worth the effort . 
  this will have drastic consequences very soon . 
  in total . 
  i expect that most of them will lose their job within the next 20 years . 
  since the middle of november 2014 , intelligence indicates that ankara delivered weapons to forces of the armed resistance in syria . 
  recipients are said to be ahrar al sham and the islamic front . 
  wo n't translate the question , which is horribly bureaucratic german . 
  the answer is pretty short and vague . 
  it 's is unclear what kind of evidence they have , and the recipients are listed with some caution . 
  ( `` sollen sein '' , which i translated as `` are said to be '' . ), 
  they probably have no hard evidence , only some informers or something . 
  it 's the official government answer to a question by a member of parliament from the left party , germany 's communist . 
   coldren, 
  what does this mean ? 
  google gives a lot of answers , but none of them seem helpful . 
   with russia 's escalation , does the us have more leeway to essentially flip off erdogan ? 
  yeah , i imagine that western politicians are quite happy about that aspect of the russian intervention at least . 
  before , there was always the risk that erdogan , being disillusioned by the eu and our constant bickering about civil rights and stuff , might move turkey closer to russia . 
  that risk vanished when russia 's bombing campaign started . 
  after reading [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85land_crisis ) , i still have no idea what you mean . 
  talking with ... himself ? 
  i love the details of this . 
  the picture that germoney has on the wall : [ it 's the proclamation of the emperor in versailles , 1871 .

  the books right next to it : faust , the luther bible , the basic law , das kapital , grimm 's ( `` uncensored '' ) fairy tales , clausewitz ' vom kriege , grass ' tin drun , and lastly of course : ** kein mampf ** . 
  people who give out souvenier checks , that 's who . 
  i have not noticed that , i see a lot of news and comments that are critical of jan , ahrar , or sultan murad . 
  [ this article ] ( http://aranews.net/2015/10/kurdish-forces-intensify-anti-qaeda-attacks-in-aleppo/?utm_source=twitter ) is currently the top post in this sub . 
  it 's clearly negative news regarding nusra . 
  it might help if you do n't call them silly names like `` puppy isis '' . 
  because i 'm sure some people were n't aware : [ sponges are actually animals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sponge ) , not plants .
