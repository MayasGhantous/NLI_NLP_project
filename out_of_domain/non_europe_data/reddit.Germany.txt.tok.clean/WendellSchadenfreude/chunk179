  wow , that was fast - thanks !, 
  in a world that is almost ours , people regularly eat sponges and use dead chickens to clean their plates . 
  it 's exactly the same joke . 
  i want rum + coke , but no coke .

   hello everyone and welcome back to yet another development diary for europa universalis 4 . 
  today 's dev diary will be about two of the new features coming in the ( as yet unannounced ) expansion that we 're working on , as well as a few additional goodies coming in the patch . 
  so , without further ado :, 
   ** advanced change culture ( expansion feature ) **, 
   currently , the change culture feature for eu4 is a bit limited . 
  it only allows you to change a province to your primary culture , and does not care if that province is right next to your core lands , or way off on the other side of siberia . 
  the new expansion expands on this feature by giving you more options in what culture you want to change a province to . 
  the options you have to choose from are as follows :, 
   - primary culture : as before , you can choose to change a province to your primary culture . 
  this is made 25 % cheaper if the province borders any province of your primary culture . 
   - adjacent owned culture : instead of changing a province to your primary culture , you may choose to spread any adjacent owned culture there , whether that culture is accepted or not . 
  for example , if you are playing as england and want to expand the gascon culture so that it is easier to keep it as accepted , you could choose to replace the basques in labourd with gascons instead of replacing them with englishmen . 
  this is 25 % cheaper than a normal conversion ( same as spreading adjacency primary culture ) . 
   - original culture : if a province has already been culture converted , and you want to bring the original culture of the province , you can now always do so ( for example , restoring the basques to labourd after the gascons forced them out in our example above ) . 
  this is 50 % cheaper than a normal culture conversion . 
   those without the expansion will still only be able to change provinces to their primary culture , but will get the 25 % adjacency discount . 
   ** name your heir ( expansion feature ) **, 
   ever gotten that 0/0/0 heir and wished you could give him or her a suitably insulting name ? 
  with the new expansion , now you can !, 
  whenever you get an heir whose name is not predefined by an event ( ' i shall name him johan ' etc ) , you will now get the option to name that heir . 
  of course , if you are n't feeling creative , there is a pre-selected name that you can simply choose instead of making up your own . 
  but where 's the fun in that ? 
   ** mercenary rework ( free feature ) **, 
   another change coming in the 1.14 patch is a change to mercenary support limits . 
  the previous system had a ` mercenary pool ' which would have a chance to replentish every day based on the size of your country , your available mercenaries modifier and your current number of mercenaries . 
  this was a confusing and opaque system that was also made worse by the randomness of which type of mercenaries you 'd get . 
  this has now been scrapped and replaced with a much simpler system whereby each country has a mercenary support limit equal to 20 + 30 % of their land forcelimit . 
  the mercenary support limit simply determines how many mercenary regiments you can have under arms at any given time and is affected by the ` available mercenaries ' modifier ( which has been appropriately rebalanced ) . 
  these mercenaries can be of any type and can all be recruited at once instead of having to wait for the pool to refill . 
  additionally , the army planner available to those with the art of war expansion has been reworked to fit the new mechanics , replacing the ` build all mercenaries ' button with the ability to put mercenary regiments into your templates . 
   ** blocking canals ( free feature ) **, 
   ever since we added canals in patch 1.6 , we 've had requests for the ability to restrict access to canals : after all , it does n't make a whole lot of sense that you 'd just let an enemy fleet sail right through your canal so that they can land troops in your colonies . 
  free in the 1.14 patch is a change to canals that will prevent anyone who is at war with the owner of the canal from moving their ships through it . 
   well , that 's all for today !, 
  next week we 'll be talking about the treatment of native populations and colonial warfare , but before i leave you i wanted to share some teasers from the reworked random new world that i 've been posting on my twitter , for those of you who might have missed them :, 
  iron is by far the most common of the heavy elements in the universe . 
  [ this graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/solarsystemabundances.png ) from wikipedia shows the relative abundance of the elements in the solar system . 
  hydrogen ( chemical symbol h ) and helium ( he ) , the elements that make up the sun , are the most common , followed by oxygen ( o ) . 
  iron ( fe ) is more common than any of the elements that are heavier ( to the right ) . 
  nickel ( ni ) seems to be a close second , but keep in mind that this is a logarithmic scale - so if the difference is between 1 and 2 , it means that iron is 10 to 100 times more abundant than nickel . 
  the earth 's core is made of an iron-nickel alloy , simply because there is so much more iron and nickel than anything else . 
  lead and platinum and all that heavy stuff is certainly in there as well , but you can almost ignore it , since iron is a million times more common . 
  by the way , we even have an idea * why * iron and nickel are so common : [ their atomic cores ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_binding_energy#nuclear_binding_energy_curve ) are the most stable . 
   john 's hopkins, 
  i 've seen people call it `` john hopkins '' a lot , but this one is new to me . 
  it 's really `` johns hopkins '' , [ named after this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johns_hopkins ) . 
  this is a [ raven . 
  ( replies beginning with `` here 's the thing ... '' will be considered not funny . ), 
   indigenous person from the lower end of rockies . 
  it took the u.s. about 30 years to defeat us . 
  when / u/csbob2010 said `` imagine trying to go to the rockies and fight the indigenous people there '' , i thought it sounded like an interesting thought experiment . 
  only your answer made me realize that this * actually has happened * . 
  i came to this thread to learn about afghanistan , not to get a new perspective on the us . 
    what 's wrong with the south ? 
   it 's hot , it 's dirty , the people suck , they get mad and shoot at you . 
  that 's all true , but i think he was asking about the south in afghanistan , not the southern us . 
  this is what you have to say as a german to somebody making a joke about `` persil '' ? 
  as a german , i must say : [ da wei\u00df man , was man hat .

  chronological order :, 
  golden twenties , some pretty happy years ( 1924-1929 ), 
  great depression , decline of the republic ( 1929-1933 ), 
  nazi germany ( 1933-1945 ), 
  world champion ( 1954 ), 
  world champion ( 1974 ), 
  world champion ( 1990 ), 
  world champion ( 2014 ), 
  i think that 's about it . 
  our view of the southern front should n't change much just because the saudis are willing to arm them . 
  `` hind '' is their nato name , and the one that is much more well-known in the west . 
  * if * you switch to calling them mil mi-24 , please add a description such as `` gunship '' or `` attack helicopter '' . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a report claiming that . 
  i 'm pretty sure they control the shore of the lake west of jabbul, 
  cruel . 
  i agree with everything you wrote , so let me just say this :, 
  this post sucks ass . 
  confession bear contains the worst fucking examples of confessions i 've ever heard . 
  it 's because people are trying to analyze this push far too early . 
  give it a week at least , then have another look at the map and at all the estimated losses . 
  so far , every analysis is mostly guesswork . 
   every issue goes through a process of never ending jokes before getting on the right track . 
  aw , man . 
  now i want to be a mod . 
  your comment is very informative . 
  i think the reason you 're being downvoted is that the way you quoted the `` overkill - demo '' part sounds somewhat passive-aggressive . 
  this is nonsense . 
   just as it is not possible that the united states would be in the dark as to what is actually happening . 
  ** yes ** , that is absolutely possible . 
  this is a huge problem with the typical world view of middle-easterners : they think that american pulls the strings on everything that happens around them . 
  russia is not intervening because america wants her to .
