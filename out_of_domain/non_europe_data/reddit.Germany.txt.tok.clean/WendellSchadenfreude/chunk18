  it 's almost funny how people are afraid of this , since the exact * opposite * is what actually happens . 
  if you 're not a donor , the doctors will at some point stop all treatment because you are dead . 
  if you * are * a donor , the doctors will at that same point keep treating you with all their skills . 
  you 're still dead , of course , so it does n't make a difference to you . 
  but if you are scared you might be `` just comatose '' , it 's better for you to be a donor . 
  ( hint : there are differences between coma and braindeath that are pretty obvious to doctors . ), 
  i just learned from this very thread that this quotation is misattributed . 
  ( go to wikiquote or google `` marcus aurelius misquote '' for sources . ), 
  it 's a . gif - if you watch closely , he winks at you . 
  i love how you can already recognize sagan as the child in the library . 
  did you see it ? 
  it 's amazing , is n't it ? 
  have you ever tried using china as an argument for people like this ? 
  ( i 'd try it myself , but there are no people like this in germany . 
  because there are at least a billion people on earth who could be expected to have a relatively open mind about the western evolution/creation `` debate '' - the chinese ( and other asians ) . 
  when they hear the arguments from `` both sides '' , it seems they are only ever convinced by ours ... 
  any of these helpful ? 
  they do n't explain that anywhere in the article , right ? 
  ( maybe i 'm too tired to find it ... ), 
  it 's weird ... 
  he says `` proved '' , though - and it annoys me that i ca n't tell which one is correct ( or `` more correct '' ) or wether there 's any difference in meaning ... 
   capital gains are already taxed as the company earns them . 
  this is the point people do n't understand . 
  explain this more clearly and in as much boring detail as possible when discussing this . 
  nope , even that would n't do it . 
  thankfully , somebody already [ made the calculations for me ] ( http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/question473.htm ) ; less than 70 meters even with all the antarctic ice gone . 
  and mind you , to melt the antarctic ice , we would need a whole new kind of climate change . 
  30-40 \u00b0 c , not 3-4 . 
  this map is only for fun , it does * not * show anything that could realistically happen . 
  that 's a great answer !, 
  i 'm gon na use that one somewhere somehow ... 
  awesome . 
  on battlefields was where i 'd spent ten thousand days . 
  not quite , versailles was special . 
  the best comparison would be the treaty of frankfurt , after the franco-german war of 1870/71 . 
  that treaty was seen as excessively harsh by the french ; but if you take e.g. 
  the `` war indemnities '' : france was able to pay them within less than 3 years . 
  this would have been absolutely impossible for germany after wwi , and it was meant to be impossible . 
  i guess your point is that `` modern '' peace treaties try to end wars with `` peace without victory '' ( woodrow wilson ) , while versailles and earlier treaties clearly showed who lost and who one . 
  - i think that 's true as a basic idea , although there are some older historic examples of placable peace treaties . 
  your dad 's interpretation of the fish-and-loaves story is the same one my pastor gave us in confirmation class . 
  * that * 's the difference . 
  what did you think op was talking about ? 
  so who wrote the letter she 's reading ? 
  when it comes to the whole coming-out thing , we took the advice ( down to even the vocabulary ) from the gay comunity . 
  [ their advice ] ( http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/gay-and-lesbian-well-being/201103/should-you-come-out-your-parents ) also is to not to tell your parents if `` you are financially and physically dependent on your parents . 
  if you come out , what is the likelihood that your parents will throw you out of the house and/or withdraw all financial support ( including money for college ) ? 
  if the chances of this happening are strong , you might want to consider ` holding off ' until you have finished school , are financially independent , and have your own place to live . '', 
  having to go to church with them might suck . 
  but it can be a lot better than the alternative . 
  `` backup king '' actually made me laugh . 
   demonstrate-ably, 
  \u201e demonstrably `` might be the word you 're looking for . 
   does n't krauss talk about the richness of living in the present universe , where we have so much evidence of the past , but that at some point in the future , when people look to the `` heavens '' the evidence will be gone , and they will not be able to support current laws and theories of physics ( crudely put , sorry ) . 
  yeah , but timescale . 
  krauss is talking about billions of years , here . 
  there 's plenty of evidence for that ; start right back at wikipedia . 
  you 're right , of course , that virtually nobody ( educated ) believed this * in the middle ages * . 
  but then again , even many otherwise intelligent people today believe this about the middle ages , even though no historian educated on the subject does . 
  - in a few hundred years , some chumps on the hypernet are going to make fun of our time because `` they all still believed that people in the middle ages did n't know the earth was a sphere '' , despite the fact that their hyperpedia and every one of their scholars will agree that `` we '' already knew better . 
  nobody 's saying we should * accept the bible as true * . 
  the question is merely if we should believe ( as in `` think that it 's true '' ) that jesus actually existed - not ( necessarily ) as the son of god , but as some galilean preacher and leader of a small group of disciples . 
  it 's not helpful to compare this to the quran , because there 's no doubt that the merchant-turned-preacher/warlord mohammad really existed . 
  of course i do n't believe that he actually talked to angels or rode to the heavens on a winged horse , but i 'm sure mohammad really * existed * . 
   so , in effect , the layperson is trusting the experts in all these areas . 
  i 'm happy to trust the historians on jesus the historical person . 
  but what is it that historians are actually saying on the matter ? 
  * a few non-christians around the year 100 likely believed that a guy named jesus or christ or something lived around the year 20 somewhere somehow . 
  * - is that the consensus ? 
  i do n't understand this . 
  virtually everybody here seems to agree that this was * not * `` a good analogy '' . 
  how did it get 1000 + upvotes in the first place ? 
  whenever posts like this make frontpage , i feel a little embarassed ... 
  it * might * also have made it to the news if she had started invoking satan . 
   you exert a pull on the earth and it exerts a     pull on you, 
  ... it exerts a = pull on you . 
  ( you just `` feel '' that same pull more . ), 
  or she had * one * sane friend who knew this stuff and told god . 
  ( does n't even have to be an atheist , anybody with some sense of humor would be enough . ), 
  since the force is relative to the product of both masses ( mine and the earth 's ) , it 's obviously the same for both masses . 
  of course , applying a force to me has very different effects than applying that same force to the entire earth . 
  [ if you magically teleport a human to a height of a few hundred meters , he quickly starts moving towards the ground ( `` falling '' ) , because the earth is attracting him . 
  at the same time , if you want to be * very precise * , the earth starts moving towards him because * he is attracting it * , with an equal force . 
  the force is * tiny * , so it does n't significantly move the earth ; but the force pulling on the human is just as tiny - only he 's so very small that it still has a huge effect on him . ], 
  zizek is too hard to listen to for me . 
  they had what ? 
  wheels that do n't work unless they are on completely even ground ? 
  yes , yes - that 's why we 're here on / r/atheism . 
  but all this is no reason to upvote * bad * content . 
  there - are - four - lights !, 
  the reasoning is n't ever clearly given . 
  i do n't think it sounds * too * logical . 
  cersei was n't gon na pay her debts back in time , ok . 
  but stannis , while willing to stand in for all the crown 's debts , ca n't pay them back * now * , either . 
  on the contrary , he even needs * more * loans . 
  so , either the bank thought that cersei planned on * never * paying them back at all , or they feel they need to make an example of cersei to scare other powerful debtors . 
  also , tysha . 
  even when tywin has his soldiers rape a `` whore '' to death , he still has them pay her . 
  am i the only one noticing the swastika ? 
  oh , right .
