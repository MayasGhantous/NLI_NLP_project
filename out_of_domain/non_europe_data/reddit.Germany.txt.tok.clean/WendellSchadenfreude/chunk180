  the us are powerful , but they are n't the hidden player behind * everything * . 
  in fact , most things that happen in the world were not planned and decided by the us . 
  it is clear that putin used the un summit to inform some people of his plans ahead of time - but this intervention is still his decision , not something obama or the pentagon asked of him . 
  one man switching sides would be enough . 
  74 % of 74 % would be 55 % . 
  if they have less support than that , the numbers do n't sound all that scary for assad anymore . 
  120 tons - might be almost two abrams tanks . 
  what 's it called by locals ? 
  probably some connecting trench . 
  they certainly ca n't defend anything to their left or right from within this trench . 
  but they might have some forward trench or position in the background and their main base in the direction that the image was taken from , and this deep trench allows them to walk from one to the other in relative safety . 
  i do n't know , i 'm just guessing here . 
  that 's a very generous way of putting it . 
  [ the rebels were overrun by isis in this area ] ( http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-at-the-doorsteps-of-aleppo-after-capturing-the-infantry-school/ ) last week . 
  it 's possible that many of their fighters managed to escape , but `` pulling back '' makes it sounds like a planned and orderly operation . 
  any two random people will have lots of similarities if you look for them , so i 'd take these `` studies '' with a grain of salt . 
  there is no chance that having a friend named matthew is genetic , so this clearly is just coincidence . 
  similar tastes for hair styles and music might be somewhat heritable - but they might also have shared the same favorite breakfast cereal and cartoon series , might both love table tennis and practical jokes , might have a favorite teacher called roberts , might drink diet black cherry soda and eat toast without the crust , they might both have been wiccans and have a tattoo of a grizzly . 
  or they might not , and we do n't find it remarkable that they * do n't * share any of these similarities . 
  want to tell us more about that ? 
  results so far : -8 , -3 , +841 . 
  interesting . 
  reading up on san marino ... uff :, 
   the investiture of the [ captains regent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/captains_regent ) takes place on 1 april and 1 october every year , beginning in 1243 . 
  this story is several years old .

   anyone who does not provide for their relatives , and especially for their own household , has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever . 
   a woman should learn in quietness and full submission . 
  12 i do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man ; she must be quiet . 
   but if we do not destroy ourselves i believe that we will , one day , venture to the stars . '',

  i think this is mostly a misunderstanding . 
  * if * we find life on mars , there are three obvious explanations :, 
  life developed independently on mars and on earth . 
  life started on earth and somehow travelled to mars . 
  life started on mars and somehow travelled to earth . 
  if mars life were found to be similar to earth life ( i.e. 
  dna based ) , explanation 1 becomes very unlikely , which leaves two possibilities . 
  now to me , earth-to-mars sounds much more likely , but mars-to-earth is somewhat more surprising and fascinating . 
  i think that 's the entire reason why journalists love this option so much and write so much about it . 
  if we assume that there is no life on mars today ( and no evidence of former life ) , i do n't think serious scientists would subscribe to the mars-to-earth explanation - as you say , in that case , it only adds one unneccessary step for the origin of life without explaining anything . 
  but it is a valid explanation * if * we find that there is life on mars ( or was at some point ) . 
  `` to go to sleep '' in german is `` einschlafen '' . 
  `` to go to bed '' in german is `` schlafen gehen '' . 
  you will often see `` schlafen gehen '' spelled in just one word , `` schlafengehen '' . 
  ( i 'm tired , so i 'm going to bed now . ), 
  ( tonight , i only want to take a bath and then go to bed early . ), 
  ( i was so tired that i fell asleep watching tv yesterday . ), 
  in short : no . 
  we can express this in german - `` ich bin im begriff , x zu tun . '', 
  would be closest - but it sounds very formal and somewhat stilted . 
  it 's definitely not the common everyday phrase that `` about to do x '' is in english . 
  in most situations , i think i would paraphrase and use the word `` gleich '' in german . 
  as with most translations , looking for a word-by-word equivalent is not the best way to go . 
  paradox entertainment . 
  visit them at / r/paradoxplaza , and prepare to have your mind blown . 
  their games are the best . 
  oops . 
  yeah , you 're right of course .

  easy remedy : go read the dev diaries to one of the old expansions that you already have .

  he 's just speaking theoretically . 
  being a lackwit does n't automatically remove aegon `` jinglebell '' from the line of succession . 
  given that he is the second son of lord walder 's eldest son , he and all the sons he might still have would come before ser emmon , who is walder 's second son . 
  of course , there was only a slim chance of this happening even when aegon was still alive . 
  a lackwit would be pushed aside by someone , regardless of his theoretical rights . 
  he has lots and lots of songs . 
  no sons though . 
  `` are we talking about the legitimate us government in london , or about the imposters in washington ? '', 
  videre would be `` to see '' , videri is `` to be seen '' . 
  but you 're right , it 's a fitting idea for him to turn that motto on its head . 
  what happened there ? 
  did the car just run over a huge mine ? 
  why would you have a mine that is so much overkill that it throws cars ~ 50m into the air ? 
  true . 
  but as they say : nil tam difficile est , quin quaerendo investigari possiet . 
   now europe , and germany , must show that they can do the morally correct thing , and let in all , all , people who are refugees . 
  as you say : `` who are refugees . '', 
  hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who come to germany are not refugees . 
  when they are rejected , they should be made to leave as quickly as possible . 
   capitalism describes private control over the means of production and inevitably leads to a political dictatorship of private capital, 
  except that this has never actually happened , it 's just 19th century marxist armchair reasoning . 
  i hope you at least noticed that your link is to `` criticism of liberal democracy '' , which is all kinds of fucked up . 
   there is nothing about capitalism here . 
  it 's amazing how easily people manage to ignore this . 
  this drug company has a * state-sanctioned * monopoly , and that 's the only reason they are able to do the bullshit they they are pulling off . 
  gie\u00dfen is just fine . 
  it 's not pretty architecturally , but how important is that to you really ? 
  it 's still a nice city with a big student population . 
  i studied in marburg , gie\u00dfen 's rival city , so you can be sure i 'm not trying to oversell gie\u00dfen . 
  i 'm sure you 'll enjoy your time there . 
  visit frankfurt ( and watch a soccer match in the stadium ) and marburg while you 're there . 
  also , the standard advice : do n't use torrents while you are in germany .
