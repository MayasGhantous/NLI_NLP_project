  unless you know what you 're doing ( vpns and stuff ) , you can easily get caught , which is expensive , stressful , and embarassing . 
  streaming stuff is ok . 
  really , i do n't think explanations will be all that useful . 
  this is just something you have to develop a natural feeling for over time . 
  do n't worry , it 's never a problem if you do n't use them yourself , and you can mostly ignore them in other people 's sentences , too , since they do n't change the meaning much . 
  among the biggest oil and gas companies in the world , you have the china national petroleum corporation , the china petrochemical corporation , gazprom , lukoil , saudi aramco , kuwait petroleum company and several other national companies . 
  oil and natural gas is a market that can hardly be characterized as capitalist . 
  even if it were : a monopoly in one market is a far stretch from `` a political dictatorship of private capital '' . 
  really depends on what your lifestyle is like and what you are already doing . 
  but the top answers are right :, 
  - work out ( running , body weight excersises ) , especially if you have a mostly sedentary job ,, 
  - read , especially if your job does n't challenge you intellectually ,, 
  - meditate , especially if you feel stressed out a lot ,, 
  - clean up your place if you otherwise do n't . 
  if you have 60-90 minutes every day , you can probably do all of these . 
  clean up your place for 10-15 minutes every day , meditate for 10-15 minutes every day . 
  alternating daily , spend the rest of the time reading or working out . 
  in addition to these instances when the name `` bloodraven '' is mentioned , we also meet him as a tree , of course . 
  i think we can only link that tree to bloodraven because of the phrase `` a thousand eyes and one '' :, 
   `` a ... crow ? '', 
  the pale lord 's voice was dry . 
  his lips moved slowly , as if they had forgotten how to form words . 
  black of garb and black of blood . '', 
  the clothes he wore were rotten and faded , spotted with moss and eaten through with worms , but once they had been black . 
  `` i have been many things , bran . 
  now i am as you see me , and now you will understand why i could not come to you ... except in dreams . 
  ** i have watched you for a long time , watched you with a thousand eyes and one . 
  ** i saw your birth , and that of your lord father before you . 
  i saw your first step , heard your first word , was part of your first dream . 
  i was watching when you fell . 
  and now you are come to me at last , brandon stark , though the hour is late . '', 
  bran iii, 
  `` most of him has gone into the tree , '' explained the singer meera called leaf . 
  `` he has lived beyond his mortal span , and yet he lingers . 
  for us , for you , for the realms of men . 
  only a little strength remains in his flesh . 
  ** he has a thousand eyes and one ** , but there is much to watch . 
  one day you will know . '', 
  this site is much better than the one linked by op . 
  not as flashy , not so trashy , far more credible , and it contains teriba 's entire statement . 
   what is an asylum seeker is in the eye of the beholder . 
  it 's really not , you 're messing up with the terms here . 
  an asylum seeker is any person who seeks asylum . 
  there is nothing beholder-y about that . 
   sweden and germany are both nations that should accept large numbers of refugees, 
  indeed . 
  but 100,000 per year would already be a `` large number '' in the eyes of some . 
  1,000,000 is more than just a `` large number '' in the eyes of most . 
  then you are poorly informed about climate change , statistics , or both . 
  even with a clear trend ( climate getting warmer ) , `` almost every month '' would n't be `` the warmest [ month ] on record '' as long as there are any significant fluctuations - which there certainly are in a system as complex as the world 's climate . 
  just look at [ their graph  ( http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/zgkymde1lzewlze1lzfkl1nlchruzw1wc0pnljewodk5lmpwzwpwcxrodw1icteymdb4otywmd4/7f0da69a/ebf/septtempsjma2.jpg ) if september 2016 is at 0.3 or 0.4 \u00b0 c anomaly , it would still be above the red trend line and clearly above the long-term average - but colder than september 2015 . 
   then all those refugees are asylum seekers , be definition , because they seek asylum in germany . 
  you 're getting there : all refugees who seek asylum in germany are asylum seekers , but not all asylum seekers who seek asylum in germany are refugees . 
  turkey is also getting paid for this by her western allies . 
  turkey is a neighbouring nation - if civil war breaks out in denmark or france , i say we should feel a lot more responsible than some distant country . 
  turkey is also accomodating these refugees mostly in large camps . 
  if we did just the same , we could take in many more people - but they 'd have no reason to come here , since they might just as well stay in turkey , and we 'd have no reason to do it , since doing the same thing in turkey would be much cheaper . 
  i comprehend what you are saying , but at least the first sentence is simply ** not true ** . 
  there are asylum seekers in germany who are not refugees . 
  hundreds of thousands of them . 
  ( there probably also are some refugees in germany who are not asylum seekers , but that 's just a sidenote . ), 
  i do n't think he 's a troll . 
  many people are * that much * guided by their emotions . 
  nope . 
  it 's right here . 
  edit : or , since you mentioned google : [ here ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/36%c2%b007'14.7%22n+37%c2%b029'03.6%22e/@36.1207493,37.4821333,907m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 ) - it 's not labelled at all and google maps seems to think it 's simply part of al safirah . 
  should n't that be / m or something ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand this graph . 
  say i see a video where it takes 9 seconds for the tow to reach its target . 
  that means the distance was 2000 [ something ] ... well , i hope this is 2000 meters . 
  ok , so the right axis title should actually be range/m , not range/sec . 
  that makes it clearer . 
  [ here 's the graph with corrected axis labels and only the relevant information . 
  count the seconds , look up that number on the x axis , find the corresponding distance on the y axis . 
  examples :, 
  12 seconds to target - 2500 meters . 
  20 seconds ~ 3600 meters . 
  1.5 seconds - probably a shopped video . 
  edit : by the way , i do n't want to appear ungrateful . 
  op has given us good and relevant information that helps better understand tow videos . 
  i just made a version that is more user-friendly if all you care about is the question : `` how far away was that tank ? '', 
  i went with `` distance / m '' in [ my own version . 
  or gender ambiguous . 
   it 's not exactly wrong, 
  that 's the point : yes , it is exactly wrong . 
  you ca n't give a range in seconds ; the right axis is actually in meters , not in seconds . 
  that second graph is very nice and easy to understand . 
  just guessing here : the pressure of the fuel decreases , thus less propellant per second is forced out of the jet ( and thus burned ) , thus lower propulsion . 
   now it 's implied distance divided by meters . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  the axis shows a dimensionless `` 2000 '' , which is exactly the distance ( 2000 m ) divided by meters . 
  it works the same way for the other axis : it shows a `` 9 '' , which is the time ( 9s ) divided by seconds . 
  it is commonly used this way in scientific literature . 
  the way you suggest [ with square brackets ] is also used , but i prefer this one because it 's more systematic . 
  it 's actually the version recommended by the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , [ see here ] ( http://physics.nist.gov/pubs/sp811/sec07.html ) :, 
   2 ) the ordinate of a graph is labeled t / ( 10 ^ 3 k ) , where t is thermodynamic temperature and k is the unit symbol for kelvin , and has scale marks at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . 
  if the ordinate value of a point on a curve in the graph is estimated to be 3.2 , the corresponding temperature is t / ( 10 ^ 3 k ) = 3.2 or t = 3200 k. notice the lack of ambiguity in this form of labeling compared with `` temperature ( 10 ^ 3 k ) . '', 
  so they even explicity recommend not using brackets . 
  ( that is : they do use brackets in this example because it 's not just `` t/k '' , but `` t / ( 10 ^ 3 k ) '' . 
  but the brackets are only to attach `` 10 ^ 3 '' to `` k '' , while the '' / '' is used to show that the quantity is divided by its unit to render its numerical value .
