  damn , i wish they included one example without any `` 10 ^ 3 '' stuff . ), 
  i think brackets are still the most common version , and i 'd never call that wrong . 
  think of it this way : you would write `` one ** in ** ten '' as `` 1/10 '' . 
  you thus write `` distance ** in ** meters '' as `` distance/m '' . 
  do n't pronounce this as `` distance per meter '' , it 's '' ... in meters '' . 
  feasible , yes - but why ? 
  a breakout would certainly by costly , and it looks like they can simply stay put for another week or so until there 's a safe way out . 
  that 's exactly what i would use in all of the given examples . 
  an [ ell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ell ) times [ two and a half hands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hand_%28unit%29 ) times [ one third of a pace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pace_%28unit%29 ) . 
  or about 46x25x25 cm . 
  i do n't understand why that highway would be important in this situation . 
  the rebels control the highway between aleppo and morek , so there will be no government reinforcements coming along this highway for a long time . 
  the rebels on the other hand can use it to get somewhat close to aleppo , but given that the government already controls west aleppo , they ca n't use it to enter the city either . 
  taking a few more miles of the highway would n't change the strategic situation much , would it ? 
  [ nope .

   yes , it is putting germany under strain . 
   no , we are not in danger of being overwhelmed . 
  then why do you think the guy is saying it ? 
  he does n't sound like some xenophobic fearmongerer . 
  he sounds like his facility simply * is * being overwhelmed , because too many people are arriving in too short a time . 
   the facility is operated by the rumelsberger diakonie , the local chapter of germany 's nationwide protestant charity operation . 
  werner pfingstgraef , who is responsible for unaccompanied minors at the facility , says : `` if i compare the present situation with the floods ( of 2013 ) , then you have to say , we 're under water . '', 
  every one of his employees , he says , is running `` like they were on a hamster wheel . '', 
  i hate this position . 
  some headline or article reports problems in germany related to immigration , and what do you worry about ? 
  you do n't worry that the headline or article might be right , you only worry that some people you do n't like might enjoy reading it . 
  yes . 
  germans joke about lazy bureaucrats as much as everybody else , and compared to private companies , government institutions can be sluggish . 
  but overall and especially compared to some other countries , german bureaucracy is pretty efficient . 
  the way i understand your comment , we are not prepared for this many people . 
  we * could have been prepared * , maybe , but we are n't . 
  and now we are not prepared , but many still want to pretend that we are , because we could have been if things had been different . 
  i do n't think you can blame the government that much for the lack of preparedness . 
  had you told anyone that you expect a million refugees to come to germany in 2015 , they would have called you insane . 
   those poor `` lesser apes '' , always walking around feeling inferior .

  if you protest against ttip , you should n't be surprised to be called a nazi , because the nazis also protest against it .

   people talking about kzs to tens of thousands of cheering people in germany !, 
  by `` people '' you mean pirincci . 
  i take it you have n't actually watched what he said . 
  if you have , you either did n't understand him , or you 're misrepresenting what he said . 
  he did not say that he wanted to open kzs , he accused others of secretly wanting to send people like him to kzs . 
  isis supporters who have been in syria have combat experience and some military discipline , they know how to use guns and explosives , and they have contacts that they know they can trust . 
  people like that are far more dangerous than some radicalized german kid . 
  posing as a refugee was the easiest way to get to germany without any kind of registration for a while , and possibly still is . 
  yup , just what i thought : you have no idea what he actually said . 
  he was raving about a cdu politician who told some guy who was complaining because of the refugee crisis that he ( the complainer ) should just leave the country . 
  to that , pirinicci says :, 
  so there are some people who complain about the refugee crisis . 
  there was a politician who told them they should just leave the country . 
  pirincci suggests that this politician would actually like to open concentration camps for these people instead . 
  he is * not * suggesting concentration camps himself . 
  i do n't like pirincci myself . 
  there are many reasons to dislike him . 
  but if you dislike him `` because he wants to open concentration camps '' , then you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  ** akif pirincci ** hates people because they are not german like him ? 
   what you do is the typical pegida cherry picking . 
  what you do is lying . 
  i 'm not pegida , and i do n't even particularly like them . 
  you do n't have to listen to an entire speech ( i have n't either ) , but when you accuse somebody of wanting to open concentration camps , you might want to listen to the one minute when he actually talks about those . 
  or read a transcript that is longer than one sentence .

  her other nephew ( aegon ) talks/thinks about marrying her all the time . 
  it 's a `` kommentar '' , which in english makes it an opinion piece , which is a type of article . 
   an opinion piece is an article , published in a newspaper or magazine , that mainly reflects the author 's opinion about the subject . 
  anyway , it does n't matter much what you call it : the author thinks that it 's a good argument against the ttip demonstrations that some right-wingers or nazis participated . 
  i disagree . 
  i think `` allegedly '' would be too weak a translation for `` offenbar '' . 
  `` apparently '' is ok , although i prefer `` obviously '' or `` evidently '' . 
  when you say that something is `` offenbar wahr '' , you 're saying that it clearly appears to be true . 
  it * might * just look like that and not actually be true , but you 're not really voicing any doubt about it . 
  you 're just saying that it looks like it is true . 
  i already knew that , but my problem is : i have no idea how to pronounce it . 
  like `` gross '' ( = disgusting ) , or ( since it 's probably derived from a french word ) pretty much like `` grow '' , or entirely different ? 
  this guy 's right , by the way . 
   it never was and never will . 
  every single refugee that came here and applied for assylum has been documented and checked or is still being checked . 
  as soon as they entered german soil , they were guarded and directed with no chance of leaving . 
  dream on . 
  before border controls were [ reinstated on september 13 ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlinge-thomas-de-maiziere-verkuendet-grenzkontrollen-a-1052724.html ) , nobody was registered while crossing the border . 
  refugees * could * then go to the police or some other public offices to get registered as asylum seekers . 
  i hope that what you say is happening * now * , but thousands of refugees and migrants entered germany without any kind of registration . 
  if you do n't believe me , here 's a ( german ) source that you can hardly accuse of being anti-refugee : [ indymedia linksunten . 
  which country are you in ? 
  in germany , you need sky to watch most matches .
