  for radio : i have n't tested it yet , but you should try [ sport1.fm . 
  if you ca n't describe the sound , describe the situation when germans do this , tell us what you think it means , give us * something * to work with . 
  or tell us instead : what is that word that americans use sometimes ? 
  you know , that one word , that sounds so funny ? 
  beautiful story . 
  are the boys in [ this picture ] ( http://nicolasbouliane.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/020930-o-9999g-002-630x480.jpg ) wearing something like tights ? 
  great . 
  just two or three months too late . 
  the at least [ 70 saa soldiers that were executed after the base fell in september ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_abu_al-duhur_airbase ) , and all their comrades who died fighting . 
  sounds like a convenient way of ending an alliance that you no longer care for : call your ally into war promising them a lot of land , then give them nothing at the end . 
  they will probably hate you enough for that to break the alliance . 
  stratigraphy is the study of rock layers . 
  it does n't help at at all when trying to find out when exactly during the `` middle ages '' something happened , further proving that people who talk about `` the middle ages '' usually have no idea what they are talking about . 
  `` stratigraphy '' is also used somewhat metaphorically , for how data are structured . 
  this is probably what he means , although it has to be one of the most convoluted ways of asking that question . 
  the answer in short : give us a country and a century at least . 
  if you just look it up on wikipedia , you find that this whole `` mead-for-a-month '' thing is nothing but `` a widely disputed explanation of the term . '', 
   [ a widely disputed explanation of the term [ 7 ] [ 8 ] claims that it comes from a tradition in any of a number of cultures ( e.g. 
  welsh , [ 9 ] german or scandinavian [ 10 ] or babylonian [ 11 ] ) where mead was drunk in great quantities at weddings and then after the ceremony nuptial couples were given a month 's supply of mead . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honeymoon#etymology ), 
  it 's called `` honeymoon '' because it 's such a sweet time . 
  anything beyond that is hogwash . 
  i maintain my original claim : if you talk about anything that happened `` in the middle ages '' , you better provide a place and a century at least . 
  otherwise , it 's nothing but urban legends and hot air . 
  it should be '' \u00dcbermut '' , not '' - m\u00fctigkeit '' . 
  \u00dcbermut definitely is somewhat negative . 
  it 's an excessive mixture of joy and confidence . 
  i do n't think it has to be negative , but it often is . 
  ausgelassenheit is not negative . 
  it 's simply relaxed jollity and merriness . 
   in germany it 's still common to have what they call a `` shelf '' toilet , where faeces actually lands on a ceramic shelf and is washed down off it and into the pipes when you flush . 
  it 's not really common anymore . 
  it 's been years since i 've seen one . 
  they still exist , but mostly in some old buildings that have n't been renovated in decades . 
  for those who ca n't picture it , [ this is what they look like . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/klo_flachsp%c3%bcler_mit_altem_sp%c3%bclkasten.jpg ), 
  so satisfying and terrifying at the same time when it finally happened . 
  that really looked like a close call for the camera man . 
  how much do we know about the cmmand structure of jai ? 
  if he has/had been killed or incapacitated , should we expect a lot of infighting in east ghouta , or would there be a clear second-in-command who takes over ? 
  i love them very much , and would be happy if there were more of them ( although i do n't think there are good political reasons for these bases , and certainly none for additional ones ) . 
  most germans like them , especially those who live close to one . 
  some germans of course oppose them with vigor , mostly motivated by a misguided `` pacifism '' . 
  german reddit is overwhelmingly leftist to the bone , so do n't expect the answers here to be representative . 
  especially american soldiers are certainly much more popular in the german general population than they are on reddit . 
  the bags i use always seem to shrink to half their size in the washing machine . 
  after that , they are so small that they are hardly useful anymore . 
  ( washing at 60 \u00b0 c or less , by the way . ), 
  things sometimes get dirty . 
  people wash things to make them clean again . 
  ask the guy above me for details . 
   and if it starts to look or smell funky , just throw them in the washing mashine . 
  i 've used the same set of bags for at least 10 years . 
  if you like that poem idea yourself , go for it !, 
  all families have somewhat different christmas traditions , but only stupid families will get mad at you for preparing a poem - even if it 's a bad one and they do n't usually do anything like that . 
  pay for soldiers is fine , as far as i know . 
  nothing exceptional , but enough to feed a family . 
  the most annoying thing seems to be that soldiers often have to move around within germany - and serve for months at a time in foreign deployments . 
  muslims in the german military - i have no idea . 
  ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article7562534/die-bundeswehr-wird-zur-multireligioesen-armee.html ) apparently , there are about 1,000 already . 
  my guess : the bundeswehr will officially be very happy about muslims joinging , but there will be also quite a lot of distrust , both from comrades and sometimes from the administration . 
  self-deprecating humor is an old jewish tradition , right ? 
  you will confuse a lot of germans . 
  when you make jokes about jews , most germans will be quite appalled and think you must be an antisemite . 
  upon learning that you are a jew ( or if they already know that ) , they will be confused about whether they should still feel offended on your behalf , or if they should reply in kind with some jokes - and if so , whether these should be about jews or about germans . 
  you definitely wo n't be thrown in jail or fined for this . 
  for my part , i think germany has been sorely missing some jewish humor , so i welcome all your attempts to bring it back . 
  i just take offense that you use the word potato as a slur !, 
  dispo - is short for disposition - , you might find words like dispositionskredit . 
  [ on wikipedia , for instance . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dispositionskredit ), 
  seems to be called * overdraft * in english . 
  in short : dispokredit means how far you are allowed to go into the negative ( withdraw money even if your account is already empty ) , - zins is the interest you pay on that . 
  it will usually be extremely high , so try to avoid this entirely !, 
  it 's really annoying that the article did n't clarify this at all . 
  google tells me this guy is an official southern front spokesman and has been for a while . 
  that 's about as fsa as it gets , at least . 
  because this is a common mistake : you do n't usually `` pledge alliance '' , you either, 
  - `` form an [ alliance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzh3ztbjaki ) '' with someone - this is mutual , it makes the two of you allies ,, 
  - or you `` pledge [ allegiance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlp72vzquou ) '' to someone . 
  this means you will follow orders from that person , at least to some extent . 
  `` bay'ah '' is usually translated as allegiance . 
  for those unaware : the current price is around $ 50 per barrel . 
  that 's considered a low price by most , because it was much higher ( ~ 100 $ ) since around 2010 , although oil has historically been cheaper ( ~ $ 25 ) most of the time . 
  [ graph ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/danielfisher/files/2015/01/eia-oil-price.jpg ), 
  i think $ 70 per barrel is a realistic price , but nobody really knows . 
  might easily be $ 30 or $ 120 instead . 
  [ midgley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_midgley,_jr . ), 
  died in 1944 , a connection between cfcs and the ozone layer was n't discovered until the 70 's . 
  his death was apparently an accident , not suicide . 
  ( he strangled himself in a system of strings that he had deviced to allow himself get out of bed despite his partial paralysis . ), 
  [ lead acetate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lead%28ii%29_acetate ) was used as a sweetener in foods for centuries . 
  yummy !, 
  they have been wrong about many things , but in this case , [ you are simply misremembering . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzannvsoemw ), 
  the map shows bashkuy under saa control . 
  only the name is in rebel territory on this map , not the town itself . 
  peter schaar . 
  diplomatic view from the perspective of bohemia , the protestant war leader . 
  genoa , switzerland , and hungary only joined as allies of the emperor , mantua .
