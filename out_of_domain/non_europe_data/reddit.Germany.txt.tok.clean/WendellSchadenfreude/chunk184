  most major foreign powers were busy with a war between a strong burgundy ( with poland + lithuania and some minor allies ) against great britain ( with castile , tuscany and some minor allies ) . 
  i think the only non-hre power to actually join a league was * cyprus * .

  it 's german , but the words are not important . 
  not necessary , but great . 
  1 extra monarch point per month is 12 per year , and an idea costs 400 mp base , so after just 33 years of having an advisor , you can get an extra idea . 
  and that 's for level 1 advisors . 
  if you can afford them , a level 3 advisor gives you an extra idea every 10 years - that 's awesome !, 
  within a hundred years , you will have an entire additional idea * group * completed , plus one or two technologies . 
  that 's worth it all by itself , completely ignoring the bonus that the advisor gives you . 
  as a sidenote : level 3 advisors are expensive , but they have an additional hidden advantage - they give you an event that gives +1 stability relatively often .

  why do n't you have to worry about groceries just because you live on campus ? 
  pro-tip : skip all mondays instead . 
  you will always look one day `` fresher '' than everybody else at work , and you do n't miss out on fridays , which tend to be a lot more casual and relaxed than mondays . 
  this is the first correctly used confession bear i 've seen all week . 
  do n't scare it away !, 
  i think maria anna and ferdinand iii could accurately be described as, 
  - first cousins ( they share a set of grandparents : her mother margarita is the sister of his father ferdinand ii . ), 
  - second cousins ( they share a set of great-grandparents , anne of habsburg and albert v. of course , all first cousins share all great-grandparents who were the parents of their common grandparents , but this one is different : they are ferdinand 's great-grandparents * on his mother 's side * as well . ), 
  - third cousins ( ferdinand i of the hre and anna of bohemia and hungary are his great-great-grandparents through anne of habsurg , maria anna , and ferdinand ii ; and they are * her * great-great-grandparents through maximilian , anne of austria , and philipp iii . 
  - of course , they also are their great-grandparents through charles ii , and they are their great-great-grandparents * again * through maria anna of bavaria , but let 's not make this needlessly complicated . 
  also , we already used charles ii and maria anna to argue for them being second cousins . ), 
  - fourth cousins . 
  ( because the original philip and joanna are their shared great-great-great-grandparents . 
  and not shared simply because they are the parents of their common great-great-grandfather ferdinand i , whom we already covered , but because they also are the parents of * her * great-great-grandfather charles v and * his * great-great-grandmother isabella of burgundy . ), 
  and then they got married . 
  and * then * their daughter married her mother 's brother . 
  it 's not a double standard ; the reverse case simply ca n't ever happen . 
  a girl would have to give birth to a child after being raped , and a court would then have to decide that this child should grow up with the rapist father rather than with the mother . 
  0 % chance of that ever happening . 
  it 's not like that because of a double standard . 
  it 's because with a male victim and a female rapist , there is a chance that a child will be born and grow up living with the mother . 
  with a female victim and a male rapist , there is no chance that a child will be born and grow up living with the father . 
   why would a female rapist be given custody of the child ? 
  because male vicitims of rape usually do n't * want * custody . 
  if they do , i hope they have a good chance of getting it ( * and * receive child support ) - but i 've never heard of a case like that . 
  in any case , that 's not the double standard people were discussing . 
   i hope they would n't , with both genders . 
  what now ? 
  you hope that victims of rape do n't get custody of their children if they want it ? 
  you need to read a lot more . 
  having something like a one child policy would be great for many african countries .

  `` ich mache kaffee '' sounds silly when you 're asked about your job . 
  i would simply say where you work - `` ich arbeite bei starbucks '' , `` ich arbeite in einem cafe . '', 
  if i had to come up with a job title , i 'd probably say `` kellner '' . 
  those are good suggestions , except there are no german words with spaces . 
  restaurantmitarbeiter would be one word , or hyphenated at most . 
  gastronomiefachkraft or servicefachkraft would both be good words , albeit very formal . 
  i think your teacher is mostly wrong . 
  your sentence is pretty bad , but not because of the word m\u00e4dchen . 
  - and that clearly would n't mean thirteen year olds . 
   ianal but i would 've gone for emancipation ... the ` son ' is an adult , fully capable of supporting himself , it seems like a no brainer that it 'd be approved . 
  i 'm not a lawyer either , but i do n't think emancipation has anything to do without this . 
  the reason they ca n't get married is not that the `` son '' is viewed as not nature enough ( like some fourteen year-old wanting to elope ) , but simply that thy are ( legally ) father and son . 
  you ca n't marry your father , even as a fully emancipated adult .

   if you nurse a 2 year old from the right , and a newborn from the left , the right will produce mature milk and the left will produce colostrum for a while before producing higher-fat milk . 
  milk content can change daily based on your baby 's needs . 
  any idea on how that works ? 
  how do your breasts get feedback from the baby ? 
  for those who do n't get the word play : an old saying goes that [ `` it takes a village to raise a child '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it_takes_a_village ) . 
  zero pips does n't mean that the general does n't know anything about that aspect of war .

  do you have any idea why this is happening ? 
  i do n't remember seeing a single warning in any of my recent games . 
   i noticed the sdf flag includes what is now turkey 's hatay province as part of syria . 
  oh my , i would never have noticed , but this is correct .

  the small black area surrounded by yellow in your first map is part of the al-hasakah governorate , but not hasakah city . 
  it 's mostly the [ small town of al-hawl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-hawl_offensive_%282015%29 ) , plus some surrounding villages . 
  hasakah-city can be seen clearly on the left side of the second map . 
  it 's held mostly by sdf , partly by the government . 
  the government forces in the city are surrounded by sdf , but both sides have a truce in the area . 
  about the small surrounded isis area in your first map : i doubt that this is accurate . 
  but even if we believe the map , the area held by the sdf south of the isis `` pocket '' would be mostly open desert with only a few small villages . 
  reinforcing or evacuating the `` pocket '' would be no problem for isis . 
  just in case you 're serious about this question , here 's another serious answer : no , it 's not . 
  i 've never seen a hitler mustache in my life , except on actors , comedians , and people trying what it would look like while shaving . 
  this particular story is likely just a legend , for frederick as well as for kapodistras and parmentier .
