  we do know , however , that frederick was a big fan of potatoes and tried to spread them in prussia . 
  we know that he issued at least 15 so called `` potato edicts '' ( `` kartoffelbefehl '' ) to his magistrates , instructing them to promote the cultivation of potatoes . 
  wikipedia sadly only has the article about this in [ german ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kartoffelbefehl ) and [ french ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89dit_des_pommes_de_terre ) , but it includes a famous picture of [ frederick supervising a potato harvest ] ( http://www.kinderzeitmaschine.de/uploads/tx_sgkzm/friedrich_kartoffel.jpg ) , and a picture of [ his tomb , upon which people placed potatoes in his honor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/friedrich_ii_tomb_p7140136.jpg ) . 
  i agree that this does n't show * much * ( assuming that it 's true at all ) , but it 's something . 
  if they managed to break this siege without foreign ground troops , it might improve the army 's morale a bit and give them some convidence that they * can * achieve something . 
  if they can only do so with russian air support , so what ? 
  - they * have * that air support , and will have it at other fronts as well for the foreseeable future . 
  so , i 'm not going to celebrate that the saa is now a new and suddenly highly competent fighting force , but this is a start . 
  if they manage another one or two offensives like this , i might regard them as somewhat competent again . 
  i do n't think he was doing that ; just giving an extreme example . 
  most dictators at most points in time would easily have won in open , democratic elections . 
  if only because they allow now well-organized opposition and make potential rivals and opponents disappear if they become too popular . 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glaukenstucken ) no , wait , that 's a different `` opposite of schadenfreude '' . 
  the other answers are right : if you feel miserable because you see others succeed , that 's * neid * , * eifersucht * or ( best in my opinion ) * missgunst * . 
  * neid * mostly means that you want for yourself what somebody else has ,, 
  * eifersucht * is mostly used in romantic contexts ,, 
  and * missgunst * simply means that you resent sombody for haing something good . 
  getting scalped does n't necessarily kill you . 
  there 's for instance [ this picture of robert mcgee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:robert_mcgee,_scalped_as_a_child_by_sioux_chief_little_turtle_in_1864-2.jpg ) , who was scalped as a child by a sioux chief . 
  you cropped out so much , and i still have no idea what i 'm supposed to be looking at . 
  edit : ah , ok : 6-6-6 ruler . 
  well , ok then . 
  easy fix for that : [ ms paint . 
   no it is not . 
  it 's utter bullshit and it is punishable by law . 
  no other bullshit is punishable by law ; so the question is whether this particular bullshit should be . 
  if you believe and publicly claim that napoleon never existed , people will consider you an idiot , but you will not by punished ( under the law ) . 
  there 's a serious historian who claims that [ charlemagne never existed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phantom_time_hypothesis ) - most of his colleagues consider this an embarassing folly , but certainly nobody wants to punish him for it . 
  sure , if you claim that the holocaust never happened , you are * wrong * . 
  but if you only claim this and otherwise do n't denigrate anyone - should the false claim alone be considered an incitement to hatred ? 
   deutsch-rationalen ... 
  volksverhetzung is not simply sprouting nonsense . 
  you can verhetz the volk without saying anything nonsensical , or you can say nothing but nonsense without verhetzing anyone . 
  ( vergib mir die albernen denglizismen , i could not resist . ), 
  you 're being childish . 
  it 's possible to debate whether a factual ( albeit false ) claim should be considered a crime , without questioning democracy or free speech in germany in general . 
  so far , i have n't heard an argument from you in favor of criminalization . 
   these laws are in place for a reason . 
  for * what * reason ? 
  the fact that many countries ban something does n't prove that there is good reason to do so . 
  see marihuana for instance . 
  plus , the majority of countries * do n't * ban holocaust denial , of course , so you ca n't even argue with sheer numbers . 
   and lying can and is punishable by several countries laws ( depending on circumstance , as in this case as well ) . 
  name one such country , please . 
  lying is definitely legal in germany . 
  you can stand on the street all day claiming that the sky is yellow and that cheese grows on trees , you can print it on t-shirts or publish it in newspapers . 
  people will know that you are crazy , but you will not be punished for it . 
  of course lying e.g. 
  about products that you are trying to sell is illegal . 
  but this particular lie or stupidity is punishable even when you are n't trying to sell anything with it . 
   btw : paris is on fire . 
  watch the news . 
  for a moment there , i thought you just wanted to give an example of a lie that you are allowed to tell . 
  wish it were so ... 
  dude , will you * stop refreshing * ?!, 
  ( sorry , humor is my coping mechanism . ), 
  everbody is saying that we should n't turn on muslims in general , and yeah , that 's true of course - but i hope we can agree that we * should * turn on this kind of muslim , with a vengence . 
  we can find out where these attackers worshipped . 
  these mosques should be closed down , and all those who work or preach there arrested and thoroughly investigated . 
  the places themselves should be searched from top to bottom , and should be * demolished * after that . 
  klar . 
  i do n't think he was being literal . 
  ( israel obviously is n't going to blame hezbollah , after all . ), 
  erdogan has blamed terrorist attacks on the pkk when it was obvious that isis was responsible . 
  jai is doing the same thing here : blaming someone who you know is innocent because you do n't like them . 
  have you ever considered not being a muslim any more ? 
  if the quran were the perfect word of god , it would not be so easy to use it as justification for murdering innocent people . 
  [ this is what punk means to me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mfcewr090 ), 
  seriously : i had no idea that it exists as a surname . 
  i only know the music style . 
  punkt sounds the most german ( since it 's a german word , of course , meaning `` point '' ) , and punke sounds the most like a realistic ( german ) surname to me . 
  with the last name `` punk '' , i think i 'd expect polish ancestry . 
  i 'm not sure about punkt or punke . 
  punishing looters , even punishing them with death , would n't normally be considered ethnic cleansing . 
  of course it gets somewhat muddy when most people of a certain religious or ethnic group participated in lootings . 
  i 'm not sure at all what kind of treatment i would wish on a person ike the sunni neighbor in your story . 
   but acronyms are n't really a thing in arab culture, 
  how about [ fatah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatah ) ( ** \u1e24 ** arakat at - ** t ** a\u1e25r\u012br al-wa\u1e6dan\u012b al - ** f ** ilas\u1e6d\u012bn\u012b ) or [ hamas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamas ) ( \u1e24arakat al-muq\u0101wama al-isl\u0101miyya ) ? 
  either these two are exceptions , or akronyms are a common way of naming organizations in arabic . 
   they got into an ivy league university . 
  for many , that is an accomplishment in itself . 
  username checks out , `` yale_alum15 '' . 
  you do n't go protesting in a library if you value learning and intellectualism . 
  no , `` wie '' is never used that way . 
  i think the concept of `` valley girls '' in general does n't translate well into german society . 
  plus maybe adding `` ne '' , `` boah '' , or `` ey '' somewhere . 
  - this does sound like a dumb , vapid girl ; but it also sounds `` lower class '' , which valley girls are n't . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm not sure i 've ever seen a bathroom in europe with a central drain in the floor . 
  sure , the floor is tiled , but there 's nowhere for the water to go - if you want to drop a water balloon , you better do it in the tub . 
  bathrooms in most parts of the world are tiled , but do not typically have a central drain in the floor . 
  when i lived in sweden ( ~ 15 years ago ) , that was also the case there . 
  this is a great opportunity to repost my favorite map of the world : a map [ highlighting all the countries in the world that are south sudan !, 
  ] ( https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4kg0oelztb_xsmyzc0cpoj3c70c=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2939696/countries_that_are_south_sudan.0.png ), 
  i guess a better translation would be to avoid the number of letters altogether and just go with `` we are missing one very short word : assad . '', 
  translating it as a `` four-letter word '' adds some extra confusion because `` four-letter word '' in english usually refers to [ swear words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four-letter_word ) such as fuck , shit , or dick . 
  it 's adds a hilarious layer to the translation , but i do n't think this double entendre exists at all in the original . 
  poland can into drain !, 
  i 'm still not quite sure .
