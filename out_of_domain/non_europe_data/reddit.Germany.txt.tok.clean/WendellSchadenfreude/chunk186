  it might be in greenland somewhere . 
  or that country just north of south korea - is that south sudan ? 
  we clearly need more data !, 
  art of war . 
  common sense after that . 
  but i think you should wait until you can get them at at least -66 % . 
  wow . 
  watt is los ? 
  / u/solidus _ snake , i have a question about the kuweires section . 
  you say that since the breaking of the siege there have been reports of fighting at the thermal power plant . 
  i thought that was just single report that confused the thermal power plant with either [ this production plant ] ( http://www.wikimapia.org/25166585/production-facility ) or [ this chemical plant ] ( http://www.wikimapia.org/25741505/sysacco-chemical-plant ) , both of which are much smaller and closer to the airbase than the large thermal power plant . 
  if the saa already managed to make its way to the thermal power plant , i 'd be thorougly impressed , but i do n't think they did . 
  do you know more about this ? 
  who is this presentation/quiz for ? 
  american highschoolers ? 
  i second posting to / germany . 
  edit : actually , just look at the other top answers in this thread . 
  this is basically the `` imposter syndrome '' , which most people have at least from time to time . 
  `` i do n't belong here , everybody else is much smarter than i am , and any day now they are going to find out what an idiot i am and they 're all going to laugh at me and send me away . '', 
  - that 's normal . 
  how is everybody ignoring the fact that this comment was made by `` themadtherapist '' ? 
   that 's how eurocrats deal with all foreign competition , especially when it comes to automotive manufacturing . 
  the plant they are talking about likely is n't even in the automotive industry . 
  quote from the article :, 
   tesla has said that germany is a key market for its household battery-storage systems . 
  so it would be about powerwalls and such stuff .

  all their communication was still saved . 
  ( memory costs * nothing * . ), 
  for suicidal terrorists , that does n't matter much . 
  after the deed , who cares who reads any messages ? 
  but for a corrupt government , having communication data of basically * all * citizens saved is invaluable . 
  want to impede a rival political candidate ? 
  - have your people look through all of his messages . 
  and through all of his communication partners ' messages as well - maybe you 'll find dirt on one of them . 
  some union or political movement is giving you a hard time ? 
  find all their members and everything they ever sent to anyone , immediately , for free !, 
  somebody you want to see in jail has a lawyer who is just too damn good ? 
  maybe it helps if you read the lawyer 's emails . 
  you know what 's even more crazy ? 
  freshwater eels in europe do exactly the same thing . 
  just like [ american eels ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/rostratamuk.jpg ) , they also [ swim to the sargasso sea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/anguillamuk.jpg ) , a region in the northern atlantic somewhere close to bermuda . 
  they cross almost the entire ocean to get there , and their larvae take around * three years * to get back to europe . 
  great comment . 
  tiny correction : it 's actually * rite * of passage . 
  millions of americans * do n't * pay off their entire credit card debt at the end the cycle . 
  the average american household owes $ 7,000 in credit card debt . 
  looking only at indebted households , that number goes up to [ $ 16,000 ] ( https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/average-credit-card-debt-household/ ) . 
  if you pay 20 % interest , that 's $ 3,200 per year for nothing .

   thank you mama najla merkel, 
  does `` najla '' have a meaning , or is it just your `` translated '' version of * angela * ? 
  choosing to have a second car is n't the fault of the car companies either , but it explains why people spend more than they did 50 years ago . 
  which * is * part of the problem . 
  ahmadi are cool folks . 
  in the islamic world however , [ they are usually not accepted as muslims . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmadiyya#persecution ) i believe they mostly call themselves that because it gives them some small protection from persecution by ( other ) muslims .

  your parent comment was not talking about government forces cutting the m5 in idlib province , but about isis cutting the m5 south of homs , near sadad . 
  [ map of the area ] ( http://wikimapia.org/12952886/sadad ) - the m5 is just west of sadad . 
  it 's probably still outdated , since government forces [ claim to have taken mahin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3tx53k/saa_hezbollah_captures_mahin_from_isis/ ) , east of sadad , thus increasing the buffer zone between the m5 and isis territory again . 
  [ the m5 is long and important .

  hillary generally goes by her first name in this campaign . 
  might be trying to make people forget that she is one of the clintons . 
  [ her official campaign slogan is `` hillary for america '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hillary_clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016 ), 
  which might be part of the problem - people might go `` i want bill , not hillary '' and thus just stay home instead of voting democrat . 
  or maybe she thinks americans simply would n't like another `` dynasty '' in the white house . 
  in any case : she is doing it herself , so calling her hillary should be ok . 
  i care little enough about jeb that i was able to forget that . 
  you are right , he goes by `` jeb '' quite as persistently as hillary goes by `` hillary '' . 
  also , jeb2016.com does not look nearly professional enough for a presidential candidate . 
  if you ever plan on reading the books , i recommend not reading this spoiler . 
  it 's about a widely accepted fan theory , and finding out about it yourself - which is absolutely possible , if you just pay attention while reading - would be so much more fun than reading about it in a spoiler . 
   has al-nusra really encircled the city ? 
  no , certainly not . 
  they just mean that nusra sent fighters to the borders of the canton . 
  the article is poorly written in that regard ; i would guess the author was n't even aware that afrin is the name of the city and the canton . 
  the borders of the canton are essentially unchanged since the beginning of the conflict , and nusra absolutely has not surrounded the city . 
  jeyne westerling will be seen in the prologue of twow ? 
  that 's new information to me . 
   plus if russia really crossed into turkey there is nothing they can say but apologize . 
  and if turkey really shot down a russian plane that was flying over syria the entire time ? 
  do n't leave out the best part :, 
   possible start of ww3 !, 
   our crowdfund campaign is live !, 
  support for regime . 
  i do n't think you can show solidarity with refugees with symbols alone , you will have to use words . 
   palau is n't poor though . 
  due to us subsidies the average income is about the same as mexico/brazil/bulgaria . 
  [ bulgaria stronk !, 
   love was unrequited . 
  still glad i got it out there . 
  sorry to hear that . 
  still , be proud of yourself - youd did what you could , and this is better than the alternative of never having told her . 
  i do n't think there 's a difference .
