  yes of course . 
  but 32 years * is * a long time . 
  reading this story , i also only want the son of a bitch dead or behind bars forever . 
  but 30 years later , is he even really still the same person ? 
  he is , and has been walking free for 15 years by now . 
  without any further crimes , as far as we know . 
  they recognised that they could control the access to the mediterranean sea by positioning cannons there that could reach the the entire strait ( of course this is not a strait in game ) . 
  the [ distance between gibraltar ] ( http://fr.distance.to/gibraltar/ceuta ) and the north-african coast is some 25 km ( 15 miles ) . 
  before the modern era , canons simply could n't fire that far , and even today , canons at that range wo n't be effective against moving ships . 
  gibraltar allowed the british to control the strait , but only because they stationed ships there . 
   the trucks do not belong to us and there is no clear information on who bombed them . 
  the initial report was that they were hit by russia . 
  [ 2014 ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2014/01/turkish-intelligence-trucks-smuggle-syria.html# ), 
  [ 2015 ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/04/turkey-scapegoating-upsets-gendarmerie-shipping-weapons.html# ), 
  which of course would n't really make it any better . 
  are n't most serjeants in the free companies ? 
  maybe the rank does n't exist in the feudal armies of westeros . 
  hard . 
  could also use strange . 
  thanks for checking . 
  i like this as a meme . 
  microwave boy might also have worked , but i think this nicely highlights a different aspect of your situation . 
  for those who do n't get it , [ augsburg is famous for its marionette theater , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augsburger_puppenkiste ) the * augsburger puppenkiste * . 
  i do n't think anybody in nato was happy about turkey shooting down that jet . 
  we will defend the turks if they are attacked . 
  we will not help them in any folly that they start . 
   and some even wish more isis attacks on france, 
  can you quote a few of those ? 
   `` read it for yourself , '' he answered , though he was almost certain that none of them could read . 
  `` lord ramsay treats his captives honorably so long as they keep faith with him . '', 
  ** he has only taken toes and fingers and that other thing ** , when he might have had my tongue , or peeled the skin off my legs from heel to thigh .

  do you still have to use sun screen on the areas covered by tattoos , or do tattoos basically have a high protection factor themselves ? 
   revenge for infraction inflicted upon his tribe/family and was getting one instance of tribal justice, 
  can you name a few examples of what these infractions would typically have been ? 
  good luck . 
  walking from khartoum ( on the nile ) to adre ( on the modern sudan/chad border ) : [ 292 hours according to google .

  but at least you 'd be following a road , not just crossing the desert . 
  early morning yesterday [ on faz.net ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/kriminalitaet/berlin-schlaegerei-loest-panik-in-fluechtlingsheim-aus-13938448.html ) . 
  in the evening [ on spiegel online . 
  unless i 'm mistaken , the math involved in this case is satisfyingly easy :, 
  8 points from nation boni , 1 at least from d6 , 5 from ( floor100/20 ) , 1 from 100 % chance at first percentage check , 9 from ideas . 
  8 +1 +5 +1 +9 = ** 24 guaranteed points ** , meaning you will * always * get 6-6-6-6 generals while at 100 military tradition . 
  and if you 're feeling risky , you can ease up on the ideas a little , because you have a 99.68 % chance of getting at least one additional point . 
  ( 1/6 for d6 ) \\* ( .2 \\* .4 \\* .6 \\* .8 to fail all percentage checks after the first ) \\* ( .5 to fail the final check ) = 0.0032, 
  microsoft would have been the go-to answer for the evils of capitalism in the 90s . 
  they ignored any standards that would have allowed their products to be compatible with anybody else 's and pushed their competition out of the market with all kinds of tricks . 
  people seriously feared that ms would become a monopoly with total control over everybody 's computers . 
  isil controls maybe 10 % of the population of iraq . 
  weirdly , i feel like he did n't rebrand himself at all . 
  he was always the same person , only in different jobs . 
   democratic institutions, 
  i 'm not sure i would actually call a parliament that uses the * liberum veto * democratic - when the will of even a 99 % majority could be nullified by a single noble shmock . 
  england had quite a [ powerful parliament in the 17th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glorious_revolution ) , and the [ dutch republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_republic ) was certainly more democratic than poland-lithuania . 
   though at what point will it be 100 % true that at least 2 people will share a birthday . 
  are you really asking ? 
  because that 's easy : you need 367 people for that . 
  365 for all the normal days of the year , one to cover february 29 in leap years , and then one more person who * definitely * has the same birthday as somebody else . 
  i heard that when you do the same thing with india , the line simply goes on * forever * , because their reproductive rate is higher and more children would be born than people could walk past you in the same interval of time . 
   every citizen is equal ( no princes , counts etc. ), 
  do n't make it sound more modern than it was . 
  the idea was that every * nobleman * was equal . 
  at least 80 % of the population were not `` equal '' . 
  you can revoke your cores , then westernize . 
  i do n't know , i do n't think i 've ever revoked a core . 
  only in casual conversation . 
  it 's equal to five lots . 
  for scientific purposes , you would use decalots , hectolots , kilolots instead , equal to 10 , 100 , or 1,000 lots , respectively . 
  i would guess you are right , but wikipedia quotes a higher number . 
   [ also , the 15 % of commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights ( the szlachta ) was a substantially larger percentage than in majority european countries even in the nineteenth century  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) [ ... ], 
  i think that ca n't be right , 15 % of the population would be something like 50 % of all adult men , but i do n't have better sources and did n't want to use a number that could easily be `` refuted '' by wikipedia . 
  half the population is female . 
  15 % of the entire population thus is 30 % of the male population . 
  in 17th century poland , life expectancy was probably somewhere around 35 years . 
  under these circumstances , roughly half the population are children . 
   so women do n't count as population then ? 
  i was assuming they did n't have these same political rights as male nobles . 
   the life expectancy in the middle ages was skewed by infant mortality . 
  if you lived to 5 , you most likely lived to 60 . 
  high infant and child mortality only further * increases * the percentage of the population that children make up . 
  this might seem counter-intuitive , but it 's definitely true . 
  ( if you have no child mortality and constant population , you need one child per adult . 
  if you had an absurdly high 50 % child mortality , you 'd need two children per adult to maintain the population . ), 
  as a sidenote , this is n't `` the middle ages '' . 
  the 17th century is the early modern period . 
  i ca n't find any good sources on this , but in absence of sources , i still doubt that a twelve year-old girl would have been able to block any legislation . 
  the * liberum veto * ** is ** madness , but this would be a whole new level of insanity . 
  they may be born where they please , but i insist that once they learn how to walk , they walk past me on their own !, 
  if the alternative to erdogan were jihadists taking control of turkey , i would support erdogan . 
  if the alternative to assad were a chp - or hdp-like party taking control of syria , i would not support assad . 
  for a coup ? 
  lots . 
  edit : just to be clear : i do n't expect a coup in turkey . 
  just remember what you do in english with `` i , my , me '' or `` he , his , him '' . 
  they all mean the same thing , only in different cases . 
  ( not the three cases you mentioned . ), 
  now realize that german does the same thing * with every word * , not just personal pronouns . 
  done - you now understand cases .
