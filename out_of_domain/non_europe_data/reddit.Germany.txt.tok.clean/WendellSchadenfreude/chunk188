  i never said or implied anything like that . 
  the alternatives to erdogan are better than he is . 
  the alternatives to assad are worse than he is . 
  that does n't mean that erdogan is better or worse than assad . 
   the guy i commented on clearly compared erdogan and assad . 
  nope , i clearly did not . 
  i compare erdogan and assad to their respective opponents , not to each other . 
  the actual border corssing ? 
  i think close to nil . 
  they ca n't risk fighting there , because any collateral damage in turkey would give the turks a very welcome reason to intervene . 
  but if the sdf take , say , [ tall rifat ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/tall+rifat,+syria/@36.4746342,37.0575709,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x152fe8f90ecc7df1:0x2ebae1ace11177ea ) , the road from the border to aleppo is cut . 
  i think it will take several weeks , but one way or the other , the road is going to be cut . 
  either by sdf gains , by another isis push , or by the government connecting aleppo to nubl/zaraa . 
  do we know where they will evacuate to ? 
  also : wow . 
   some 75,000 people currently live in waer, 
  i would have guessed there are a few hundred left , or a few thousand at most , not 75,000 . 
   her boyfriend `` worked in it '' . 
  this is a nice example of understatement . 
  to say the least . 
  [ good one . 
  since op probably wo n't get this : it 's the [ merkel-raute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkel-raute ) , her typical hand gesture . 
  just google it , and you will find [ a lot of jokes . 
  impossible !, 
  the `` ohne koch gehts och '' city would never use a slogan this crude . 
  [ wikipedia knows . 
  what do you do with the two days left ? 
  as the article says itself , this headline is nonsense : :, 
   the planned evacuation will take place in two phases : 1st phase is to allow humanitarian aid to any remaining civilians living inside the district ; 2nd phase is the transportation of the 600 rebel fighters from al-wa ' er to the idlib governorate . 
   the whole plan is supposed to last as long as two months , with the end goal being the syrian government in full control of homs city . 
  there are still hundreds of rebel fighters in homs at the moment , and until they have actually withdrawn , the government is not in full control . 
  at best , there 's a truce at the moment . 
  all of this is great news , but i do n't like headlines that exaggerate this clearly . 
   russian move to support the ypg/j and jat forces in their offensive was brilliant ,, 
  did n't they only start that after jan declared that they would attack afrin ? 
  there used to be one or two , but i do n't think we have any ( open ) isis supporters at the moment . 
  there are , however , some people who will cheer for isis advances in northern aleppo even though they do n't support isis . 
  the reason is that these advances might be advantageous both for the regime and for the kurds . 
  if isis takes over the rebel areas in n. aleppo , it makes the rebel positions in aleppo city much harder to defend , bringing assad 's troops closer to a victory in this war . 
  ( if they safely control all of damascus + aleppo + the coast , the war is essentially over . ), 
  and if isis expels all rebels from n. aleppo , there will be nothing but isis separating afrin from kobane , which will probably allow the kurds to go on the offensive and connect their cantons , making autonomous or independent kurdish regions much more viable . 
   up to date there is no doubt that turkey 's aircraft attacking on the russian su-27 bomber was planned provocation of ankara . 
  i doubt that . 
  it seems like this was a pretty spontaneous overreaction . 
  why would they have * planned * something that so obviously and predictably backfired ? 
   not obvious is another fact : whether turkey could own without prior consultation with the west and nato to shoot down russian plane ? 
  that 's not a `` fact '' at all , that 's a question . 
  and an easy one at that : yes , turkey is able to shoot down planes without consulting anybody beforehand . 
   this situation is unlikely , since turkey is a nato member , and must conform to its strategy , as well as the alliance is responsible for the actions of their members . 
  nonsense . 
  nato is a defensive pact . 
  for the most part , nato members do n't have a common strategy , and they certainly are n't responsible for each other 's actions . 
  they promised to collectively defend their territory , and that 's it . 
  what * is * germany 's main atheist organization ? 
  in your spoiler , it says `` 3 children '' , but it should be `` 2 children ( and their mother ) '' .

  do you really think more than ~ 5 % of the people did ? 
  people talk about the ways how they make their games easier or harder all the time , but hardly anybody ever mentions the difficulty slider . 
  i know i never touched it . 
   til more than 5 % = everyone, 
  what i said is '' < 5 % = nobody '' . 
  so ''  95 % = everyone '' . 
  add a `` virtually '' if you must . 
  hard mode in eu4 is used by hardly anybody , and the reason is not that people do n't want a hard game , but that the way in which the higher settings make the game difficult are n't interesting or fun in the eyes of almost everybody . 
  many players still start games as opms , which is difficult * and * interesting . 
  everybody knows that science gives us tools that can be used for good or evil . 
  what harris claims is that science can also give us answers to ethical questions in at least some cases . 
  a question like that might be : `` should i vaccinate my children ? '', 
  to answer this question , you could either ask your favorite religious authority about your religion 's view on vaccination , or you could ignore all religious authorities and simply try to find out which course of action will likely lead to a world with more human happiness and less human suffering . 
  the latter is the approach that harris would call scientific . 
  it can also work in cases where the answer is n't immediatly obvious , e.g. 
  `` should i eat meat ? '', 
  - there are many religious answers to this , and harris would suggest to ignore them all . 
  a `` scientific '' answer would instead try to factor in the pleasure of eating tasty meat , the suffering of farm animals , health effects , effects of meat production on climate change and many other things . 
  a scientific answer to the question might then also be something undogmatic like `` you can eat meat , but it should be from producers that treat animals well , and eating more than x kg of meat per person per year would n't be sustainable , so you should try to eat no more than that . '', 
  ( sidenote : i have no idea what harris ' position on this is . ), 
  harris at least once gives an answer of this scientific type to a question that i find very interesting : [ should you burn wood in your fireplace ? 
  ] ( http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-fireplace-delusion ) - even though i do n't like the answer , i do n't think this question could be answered in any interesting way without using science . 
   chomsky specifically asked that this not be a public debate , and harris published it . 
  chomsky 's words :, 
   the idea of publishing personal correspondence is pretty weird , a strange form of exhibitionism -- whatever the content . 
  personally , i ca n't imagine doing it . 
  ** however , if you want to do it , i wo n't object . 
  ( emphasis mine ) chomsky tried to be as rude as possible about it , but clearly allowed for this exchange to be published . 
  this particular thing does n't even seem like it would be that hard to code . 
  walking from one enemy province with a fort directly into another enemy province with a fort simply should never be possible , should it ? 
  the way it stands , having forts in adjacent provinces * increases * your enemy 's options . 
  different languages yield interesting results . 
  germans feel lonely , ugly , empty and alone . 
  spaniards feel good - other than that , all their feelings are about song lyrics . 
  the french feel bad , good , alone and not pretty . 
  the swedish feel like the jazz band [ rena rama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rena_rama ) , they feel ugly , they feel proud and content with themselves , and they feel so lonely . 
  give me some more languages , please !, 
  whether or not you agree to have your private conversation published is n't really a question of free speech . 
  i also support the right of neo-nazis to publish their stuff , but if you sent me a private message and asked me not to publish it , i would n't . 
  my parent comment claimed that harris published the conversation despite chomsky specifically asking him not to . 
  i just showed that chomsky clearly stated that he 'd be ok with harris publishing it . 
  * ful * meaning full made so much sense to me that i did n't even question it .
