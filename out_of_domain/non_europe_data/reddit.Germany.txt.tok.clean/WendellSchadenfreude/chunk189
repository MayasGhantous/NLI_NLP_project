   is implicit lack of objection , `` permission '' ? 
  saying `` if you want to publish this , i wo n't object '' is not `` implicit lack of objection '' . 
   because you 've already lost the argument . 
  yeah , sure . 
  you saying so will certainly make it so . 
  there are a million easy ways in which you can make it clear that you do not want a private exchange published . 
  saying `` if you publish this , i wo n't object '' is * not * one of them . 
  on the contrary , it 's a clear way of saying `` go ahead '' . 
  if i tell you that i do n't want you to do something ( even several times ) , and * then * i tell you you can do it and i wo n't object , then it 's fine if you go ahead and do it . 
   450 soldiers - 6 tornado jets for surveillance + sat radar, 
  i still do n't understand how you need more than 400 soldiers for 6 planes . 
  a handful are pilots and other crew - are some 400 of these guys engineers ? 
  you have a bunch of cookies lying around and i ask if i can have one . 
  you say i ca n't because they are your cookies . 
  a few hours later , i ask again , and you still tell me that you want to keep all of your cookies . 
  a few hours after that , while getting ready to leave , i see that you still have n't eaten all your cookies , so i ask one more time , and you say : `` fine , if you take one , i wo n't object . '', 
  - i think that means i can take a cookie . 
  now , will you tell me that your metaphor is more fitting ? 
  ( `` harris essentially * raped * chomsky ! '' ), 
  i think the level of consent that can be demanded is higher when we are talking about having sex or starting a war of aggression than it is when talking about publishing a few emails or taking a cookie . 
  besides , the `` i do n't enjoy sex '' from your metaphor has no equivalent in the real conversation . 
  * i would n't publish it , but you can * makes perfect sense , while * i do n't want to have sex with you , but you can have sex with me * does n't . 
  good theory . 
   i feel i have a very big advantage, 
  is there some context to this ? 
  yes we are . 
   species, 
  a type or kind of thing .

  if you are a muslim with some extremist friends or a very recent immigrant from syria - maybe you should n't watch it . 
  if you are a typical christian/atheist german with only an abstract interest in the middle east - go ahead . 
  i have watched some isis stuff . 
  has n't gotten me in trouble , and i do n't see how it could . 
  i have no idea what you mean by `` the new isis video '' , so i ca n't tell you how much gore to expect . 
  most of their propaganda videos are pretty clean , but of course they also have videos showing how they burn people to death or cut off heads with kitchen knifes . 
  99 % of the world 's population just died , and your first concern is rampant breeding ? 
  the survivors are probably traumatized and depressed , and only one in 10,000 couples from before is still together . 
  the survivors ' birth rate likely drops drastically . 
  but even if it does n't , if it explodes instead : if the population * doubles * with every generation from now on , it takes 6-7 generations to get back to the old number . 
   wo n't people just get sick from eating the meat otherwise ? 
  no , the antibiotics are not there to make the meat safe . 
  they are only used to make it cheaper to grow the animals . 
  if you have thousands of chickens/pigs/cows in a single facility , an outbreak of a disease can cost a lot of money , so they just pump them full of antibiotics the entire time . 
   or the price of meat would go much higher ? 
  higher , sure . 
  probably not much higher . 
  although it will be hard to find honest numbers about this anywhere . 
   i 'm assuming they gave the meds to the animals for a reason, 
  sure . 
  but this is one of the clearest cases of market failure . 
  using antibiotics in farm animals makes meat cheaper , which is nice for producers or consumers of meat . 
  but if it takes away our last-resort antibiotics , the price we all pay for this is far higher than the little extra that we might have to pay for the meat . 
  i 'm a capitalist , i want farmers to find cheap and efficient ways to produce food . 
  but if what is cheapest for an individual farmer is much more costly for us as a society , we need the government to step in . 
  one or two last-resort antibiotics should be kep away from farmers just as much as they should be kept away from people suffering from the flu or some trivial infection . 
  you safe them for people who would die without them . 
  you complain about somebody 's rhetoric while accusing them of `` advocating nazi policies '' ? 
  i do n't like trump . 
  i do n't like his stance on immigration or muslims . 
  - but he does n't advocate exterminating them . 
  he does n't advocate building death camps where millions of people will be killed . 
  the nazis did just that . 
  demanding to not let any muslims enter america is extreme . 
  but it 's nowhere near the most extreme nazi policies . 
  but this is n't a nash equilibrium at all . 
  being the only country with nuclear weapons in space would be advantageous , and not having nuclear weapons in space when your enemy does would be disadvantageous . 
  no matter what your opponent does , getting nukes in space would be the advantageous strategy . 
  i 'm glad there are no nukes in space , and i hope there never will be . 
  but the nash equilibrium would be all sides having nukes in space event though heverybody agrees that it 's a terrible situation - but you ca n't gain an advantage in that situation by changing only your own strategy . 
  that 's not a nash equilibrium . 
  in a ne , no player can gain anything from changing * only * their own strategy . 
   a group of players are in nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible , taking into account the decisions of the others in the game ** as long the other party 's decision remains unchanged . 
  true , but this still is no nash equilibrium . 
  in a ne , no player can gain anything from changing * only * their own strategy . 
   a group of players are in nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible , taking into account the decisions of the others in the game ** as long the other party 's decision remains unchanged . 
  the theory simply does n't fit in this situation . 
  a simple ne would be the opposite case : we have nukes and the russians ( let 's speak in clich\u00e9s to make things easier ) have nukes . 
  everybody would be better off if both sides simply got rid of their nukes - but nobody will , because no side can gain an advantage from changing * only their own strategy * . 
  that 's a nch equilibrium . 
  true , but not a nash equilibrium . 
  a ne is n't necessarily a * good * outcome . 
  this nuke case is basically a [ prisoner 's dilemma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner's_dilemma#generalized_form ) : we can all see that the best outcome overall is when all sides cooperate . 
  but no matter how the other side acts , the best strategy for you always is to betray the other side . 
  this leads to the worst situation , where both sides are betraying each other - but that outcome is the only nash equilibrium in this game : a situation in which no side can gain from changing * only * their own strategy . 
  it 's from the main books , but only mentioned as a legend .

  wow ... `` chancellor of the free world '' ... `` de facto leader of a continent '' , `` called the most powerful woman in the world '' . 
  they 're really laying it on with a trowel . 
  when anyone says `` sub-zero '' , i always assume they are talking about celsius anyway . 
  the zero in celsius ( freezing point of water ) is much more important than it is in fahrenheit , where it 's a pretty arbitrary point . 
  also , china uses the celsius scale . 
  0 \u00b0 c would be 32 \u00b0 f.
