  for anyone wondering :, 
  0 \u00b0 c ~ 32 \u00b0 f, 
  0 \u00b0 f ~ -18 \u00b0 c, 
  economics can be so simple sometimes . 
  maps of the region from a few days ago . 
  [ map 1 ] ( http://s3.img7.ir/osivb.jpg ), 
  [ map 2 ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cvolj31wiaamzs8.jpg:orig ), 
  compare with wikipedia 's [ overview map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:syrian_civil_war_detailed_map ) if you do n't know where this region is . 
  if the m5 is cut , rebels will have a much harder time supplying aleppo from the south , or moving fighters from the north ( azaz , mare ) to hama province ( morek ) and latakia province ( salma ) or vice versa . 
  it 's just called `` 0 k '' , without the degree symbol . 
  chinese soldiers ca n't fight at that temperature , [ only the finns can . 
  you probably misunderstood :, 
   [ to slay something can mean to kill it or to amuse it . 
  the past tense of the first meaning is slew , while the past tense of the second meaning is slayed . 
  ] ( http://grammarist.com/usage/slayed-or-slew/ ), 
  this pope amused a dragon so much , the grateful dragon decided to give him one of his arms so he could forge a sword from its bones . 
  [ this page has collected a few hundred of those . 
  ] ( http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/muslim_voices_against_extremism_and_terrorism_part_i_fatwas ), 
  a fatwa is just a formal legal opinion given by somebody who studied islamic law . 
  and just because one scholar has given his opinion on a topic does n't mean that other scholars ca n't state theirs . 
  there can be a fatwa by the local imam of some tiny congregation stating that it 's allowed for muslims to sell cigarettes , and a fatwa by the imam one town over stating the opposite - muslims then have to decide which of these scholars they trust more . 
   the koran literally forbids burning people alive . 
  got a direct quote for that ? 
  as far as i know , this is only from a hadith ( that advocates killing in a different way instead ) . 
  other hadiths at least clearly state that mohammed burned people alive . 
  i do n't think the quran says anything on the matter . 
   so what do you use to measure stuff instead ? 
  german casual baker here . 
  i do n't have a kitchen scale , that 's for pedants and old people . 
  i use a [ measuring jug instead ] ( http://cdn4.micasa.ch/medias/sys_master/zoom/c/f/0/7/id_9262241120286_zoom.jpg ) , which has three scales for water ( or milk ) , sugar , and flour . 
  same method as yours : just pour it in , do n't worry about density . 
  for smaller amounts , we do use tablespoons and kitchenspoons . 
  the only time in ottoman history when the sultan was captured was during the [ battle of ankara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ankara ) in 1402 . 
  i do n't know that it had anything to do with the sultan 's wife . 
  so hartz iv is n't useful or decent . 
  fine christmas spirit you have yourself . 
  i think the most interesting perspective is this one : [ 715.000 children were born in germany in 2014 . 
   we are spending 15 billion euros on refugees this year . 
  i saw that number and thought it was way too high and could n't be true - but after researching , it turns out this is n't even a high estimate . 
  [ this article quotes an estimated cost of 21bn $ for just this year . 
  your reinforcement army needs to get there before the enemy 's units arrive . 
  otherwise , your small canon stack is already fighting , which means your five canons are now in the frontline - they are absolutely useless there and get slaughtered quickly . 
  after that , your reinforcements will fill up the frontline , but you probably do n't have enough canons left to properly support your new frontline from the back , so you still deal less damage and take higher losses than the enemy . 
  if you ca n't make sure that your main stack will get there fast enough , do n't siege with canon-only stacks . 
  at least go 5-0-5 or something , or do n't siege at all until you 've beaten the main enemy army . 
  just to be clear : this is only about control , not ownership . 
  denmark can even cross if one side of the straight is a swedish province , as long as they have that province occupied . 
  really , i 'm a huge fan of the metric system , but it does n't make much of a difference for the purpose of * baking * . 
  one decisive factor is usually omitted in the news about this story : while the group posed in safety vests with the imprint `` sharia police '' ( in english ) in several videos , they did apparently * not * wear these vests while telling people not to enter pubs and casinos . 
  i 'm sure wearing vests like these while giving instructions to people would be seen as impersonating a police officer , which is ( of course ) illegal . 
  the way it happened , the court seems to believe that these guys were merely voicing their opinion , not trying to intimidate anyone or demanding the adoption of sharia law in germany . 
   this thing looks like the lhc had sex with a m\u00f6bius strip . 
  stealing this . 
  i 'm having trouble imaging a comparable scenario for these cases . 
  a more realistic case might be a self-proclaimed `` animal-police '' telling people that eating meat and wearing leather products is evil . 
  these guys were apparently not ( officially ) trying to implement all parts of sharia law , but only talking about drinking and gambling . 
  it 's easy to tell people that gambling and alcohol are evil without resorting to any form of hate speach . 
  ( it 's stupid , of course , because gambling and alcohol are great . ), 
  it 's almost impossible to recommend `` racial purity '' without resorting to hate speech . 
  i do n't get it . 
  sounds like quite average beat-boxing . 
  after having had a look at his vowel-poems , i 'm sure this is amazing in some way as well , but i completely fail to understand it . 
  can somebody please explain ? 
   he wrote a book titled [ eunoia ] ( http://archives.chbooks.com/online_books/eunoia/text.html ) . 
  * wow * . 
  i just spent a few minutes reading that , then ordered two copies immediately . 
  buying it just once would not have been enough . 
  never heard getschecht either . 
  google finds 280 results , most of which do n't actually use the word at all . 
  ( for comparison : 70.000 for `` get\u00fcrkt '' . ), 
  `` get\u00fcrkt '' is an actual word in german . 
  `` getschecht '' might be an inside joke in one village or family , but it 's not really a word . 
  good . 
  now try to un-learn , because it 's actually not . 
  at least 90 % of african-americans do n't celebrate kwanzaa . 
  the most popular ( year-end ) holiday among african-americans is christmas , by a huge margin . 
  the only thing that bothers me about this chart is the implication that it 's somehow normal for african americans to celebrate `` kwanzaa '' . 
  [ hardly any of them do . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kwanzaa#popularity ) ( ~ 1-5 % ) the vast majority of african americans celebrate christmas . 
  if somebody wishes you `` happy kwanzaa '' , the correct response obviously still is `` thanks , you too '' . 
  but if you just want to say something `` christmas-y '' to a black person , go with `` merry christmas '' or `` happy holidays '' . 
  he is ? 
  are you talking about the lewinsky scandal , or some other incident ? 
  [ not american , never heard bill clinton accused of being a rapist before . ], 
  it 's ok , people - he 's just telling op some consoling lies . 
  we all know nutella really is the nectar of the gods , but it would be rude to say that to the poor guy who ca n't have any . 
  talking about the near future and reproductive rates in the same sentence is completely self-defeating . 
  to have a stable population , germany needs roughly 150k immigrants per year . 
  anybody have a link to the actual bka report ? 
  i ca n't find it on their homepage . 
  edit : by now i can tell you : nobody in this thread has had a look at the actual report , because it has n't been released to the public . 
  de maziere ( minister of the interior ) had this report drafted so as to fight rumors about rising crime rates , but now he refuses to simply have it published . 
  i find this quite annoying . 
  [ the wiki has a very decent list . 
  ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/category:merchant_ships ), 
  there are also a few non-trading ships that are mentioned a few times , so you might also want to look at the [ category page for ships . 
  ] ( http://m.westeros.org/index.php/category:ships ), 
  the articles for each ship are very short . 
  i think the most important recurring ship will be the myraham . 
  check [ out these two ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1pexqs/spoilers_all_i_know_where_robbs_letter_is/ ) threads [ if you have no idea why .
