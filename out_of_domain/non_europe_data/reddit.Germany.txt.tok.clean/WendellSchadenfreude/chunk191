  that 's 2014 , not the report they are talking about . 
  to keep the german population from shrinking , the country would need about 150k immigrants per year . 
  we could find that many easily within the eu . 
  and all of those would speak english , know how to read european letters , and would have enjoyed health care comparable to the german level for their entire life prior to coming to germany . 
  * some * syrian immgrants will help the german economy , probably . 
  but that 's only true for maybe 10 % of the total number . 
  it is . 
  only for some weird reason the more experienced players tend to lose against newbies . 
  will your view change already if the nomination goes to rubio ? 
  [ according to most betting sites ] ( http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/us-politics/us-presidential-election-2016/republican-candidate ) , he 's the most likely candidate at this point . 
  the early nomination race is the high time for crazy candidates - you do n't need to appeal to the moderates , the only important thing is that you have a few die-hard supporters who actualy show up to vote for you . 
  this changes already when we get closer to the actual nomination , when more people start paying attention - most `` crazy '' candidates drop out at some point . 
  after the nomination , whoever is chosen as the candidate will also start to sound much more moderate . 
  they ( probably ) wo n't outright change their positions , but they will do what they can to appeal to moderates and independents - they already know that convinced republicans will vote for them . 
  possible , although it seems we do n't really know . 
   [ hieroglyphs emerged from the preliterate artistic traditions of egypt . 
  for example , symbols on gerzean pottery from c. 4000 bce resemble hieroglyphic writing . 
  in 1998 , a german archaeological team under g\u00fcnter dreyer excavating at abydos ( modern umm el-qa ` ab ) uncovered tomb u-j of a predynastic ruler , and recovered three hundred clay labels inscribed with proto-hieroglyphs , dating to the naqada iiia period of the 33rd century bce . 
  the first full sentence written in hieroglyphs so far discovered was found on a seal impression found in the tomb of seth-peribsen at umm el-qa ` ab , which dates from the second dynasty . 
  ( my comment : that 's around 2800 bc . ), 
  in the era of the old kingdom , the middle kingdom and the new kingdom , about 800 hieroglyphs existed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egyptian_hieroglyphs#history_and_evolution ), 
   geoffrey sampson stated that egyptian hieroglyphs `` came into existence a little after sumerian script , and , probably [ were ] , invented under the influence of the latter '' , and that it is `` probable that the general idea of expressing words of a language in writing was brought to egypt from sumerian mesopotamia . '', 
  however , given the lack of direct evidence , `` no definitive determination has been made as to the origin of hieroglyphics in ancient egypt . '', 
  instead , it is pointed out and held that `` the evidence for such direct influence remains flimsy '' and that `` a very credible argument can also be made for the independent development of writing in egypt ... '' recent discoveries such as the abydos glyphs `` challenge the commonly held belief that early logographs , pictographic symbols representing a specific place , object , or quantity , first evolved into more complex phonetic symbols in mesopotamia .

   [ the cuneiform writing system was in use for more than three millennia , through several stages of development , from the 34th century b.c.e. 
  down to the 2nd century c.e.

  this is ok . 
  still , that is one great subreddit . 
  for haftpflicht : yes , get one . 
  every person living in germany should have one . 
  huk-coburg is probably ok , it 's hard to compare . 
  does n't matter much , because haftpflicht is cheap and extremely important . 
  for all other kinds of insurance : what 's your situation ? 
  are you german , foreigner living in germany ? 
  are you a student , employee , part-time worker , unemployed , freelancer ? 
  20 years old , 30 years old , 80 years old ? 
  single , married , parent of 12 children ? 
  this stuff matters . 
  that 's only when `` machen '' or `` tun '' \\* has already been said . 
  in response to `` was machst du ? 
  '' , `` die aussicht genie\u00dfen '' is a correct response , and it 's not even colloquial . 
  other questions from your example ( wo bist du , wohin gehst du ) can not be answered properly with an infinitive . 
  \\* or , in rare cases , a similar word . 
  for example : `` was treibst du so ? '', 
  would just be a colloquial way of asking `` what are you doing ? '', 
  - you could still answer with : `` essen , trinken , fu\u00dfball gucken . '', 
  if you want to return to your home country in a few years , it 's probably better to get most of your insurances there . 
  otherwise , what you really need is health insurance ( which every german has , and you probably do , too ) , haftpflicht , and berufsunf\u00e4higkeit . 
  if your family depends on your income , you should also get a life insurance .

   lost a leg ? 
  nope , you can still work as a baker . 
  `` berufsunf\u00e4higkeit '' ( buv ) pays out if you ca n't work in your actual job anymore . 
  does n't matter if you 'd still be able to do something else . 
  by the way , you mean `` wary '' , not `` vary '' . 
   of course , but what actually prevents you from working as a baker ? 
  or as a engineer sitting at a desk ? 
  typically : psychological problems . 
  or having a bad back , thus not being able to sit at a desk for 8 hours straight . 
  nsfl explanation : closeup of a person who was burned so thoroughly that what remains is only a skeleton with some charred meat on it . 
  quite gruesome , although it 's easier to llok at than some of the stuff on this subreddit , because it hardly looks like a person anymore . 
  i 'm sorry , what was the first one ? 
  how literal do you want to be ? 
  you can go with `` worte der weisheit '' of course , but be aware that this is * not * a standing expression in german as it is in english . 
  `` weise worte '' sounds more natural . 
  i 'd probably go with `` guter rat '' or `` gute ratschl\u00e4ge '' in most cases . 
  uhm ... maybe i did . 
  what 's funny about him eating newspapers ? 
  you mean `` commend '' ( praise , approve , say that something is good ) , not `` command '' ( give orders ) .

  you can have an `` amount '' only of things that are uncountable . 
  an amount of rice or salt or water would be typical examples .

  because you good absolutely make folks pay for an opportunity to spend a few hours collecting rocks with that thing . 
  that probably means that he is moving toward you , and the doppler effect makes the light he emits/reflects blue-shifted , thus higher in energy or `` hotter '' .
