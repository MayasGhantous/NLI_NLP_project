  definitely heard this before . 
  it 's not exactly common , but it exists . 
  i do n't know why , but this makes me sad . 
  dandelions should get to * fly * , or at least be eaten by goats , not be trapped forever in resin . 
  `` i have many heaps of stuff '', 
   its news to me that nursa is active here . 
  i thought jai did n't allow other groups, 
  that 's also what i find most interesting about this report - is nusra active and relevant in e ghouta ? 
   it does n't do a comparison with the national average . 
  in that case , you can simply discard it . 
  learning that there are `` x suicides per year/day '' among a group of people is completely useless unless you ask the obvious question about it : is that a lot ? 
  the famous chinese `` suicide factories '' ( foxconn/apple ) actually had lower rates of suicide than the chinese average . 
  you would never have guessed so from reading any of the articles about them . 
  the ai also regularly declares wars `` to purge the heresy of x '' . 
  then they win and force x to pay war reparations or maybe hand over a province , but never actually force convert them to end the heresy . 
  it 's hugely disappointing . 
  the forced truce after breaking an alliance was just poorly implemented in the last patch and will almost certainly be fixed in some way in the next . 
  it 's not just the restoration cb , it 's ** any ** `` claim throne '' cb - they used to be awesome , and now they are almost completely useless . 
  an easy fix would be that taking the mission or claiming a throne breaks your alliance and simply starts a war instantly ( without any extra-ae for trucebreaking ) . 
  still would n't be as good as it used to be , but it would do . 
  does n't need to be hardcoded , but giving them a `` historical rival '' modifier for -25 opinion should be enough . 
   do you always spend a chunk of warscore to force conversion when you could grab provinces , money or power projection ? 
  regularly . 
  and more importantly : the ai should . 
  we 're the player , it 's ok if we care about nothing but power . 
  but if the ai claims to be motivated by religious differences , it should at least try to act as if it really were . 
  in most cases , these wars just end with war reparations anyway , which just leaves everyone poorer than before . 
   this is like the saddest thing i 've ever heard . 
  you live a very sheltered life . 
   but if you break an alliance to enforce a union , other countries are gon na be pissed . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  in a typical example , you and your alliance partner have been allies and `` royally married '' for a long time . 
  then the other country 's ruler dies and your dynasty takes over anyway . 
  if you now press your claim on the throne , other members of your dynasty might get worried ( thus the opinion malus with other royal marriage partners ) , but all other countries wo n't see much of a difference : `` these two countries have always been close , so what if they are now both ruled by the same king ? '', 
  if you 're about to enforce a pu on one of your long-term rivals , other countries should be much more worried , because you 're upsetting the balance of powers much more . 
  eine million ? 
  [ sure is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devil's_advocate#origin_and_history ) . 
  spain and france had not been traditional allies , they had in fact just stopped [ fighting against each other ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nine_years'_war ) four years before the wotss . 
  most of europe opposed france pu'ing spain not because it was seen as evil backstabbing , but because it was obvious that a franco-spanish empire would have been the end of any european `` balance of powers '' . 
  that 's a mechanism that sadly does n't really exist in eu4 , other countries opposing you simply because you are growing too powerful . 
  instead , people get mad when hesse tries to press a somewhat legitimate claim on cleves .

  for those unaware , this entire area is [ western ghouta . 
  ] ( http://wikimapia.org/27594876/western-ghouta ) rarely gets talked about , [ eastern ghouta gets all the atention . 
  the town hey are talking about [ is this one . 
  if you look at some 2015 maps , they show that this town was a [ small ] ( https://archicivilians.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/damascuscity.jpg ) or [ a tiny pocket ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cirqs0hueaab6-f.png ) of rebel control in government land . 
  i always wondered why the saa does n't try harder to clear out these pockets . 
  just a few clicks down the road , there 's this [ group of women with brooms ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uozvrby.jpg ) who are apparently cleaning up the street . 
  makes the whole neighborhood look far less scary . 
  werewolf is a poorly designed game . 
  the fact alone that one player always dies in the first night ( before anything else has happened ) and has to watch for the rest of the game is reason enough not to play it . 
  if you like werewolf , try [ the resistance ] ( https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance ) . 
  you also get to lie to your friends and pretend that you 're one of them , trying to convince them that your real-life best friend ( who will hate you forever for this ) is actually the traitor in your ranks . 
  but * everybody * gets to participate for the entire game - no moderator required , no player eliminations . 
  [ wiki link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_resistance_%28game%29 ), 
  edit : oh , and it 's already fun with 5 or 6 players . 
  werewolf ( even if you play without a moderator ) with 6 players is still completely pointless . 
  that sounds like exactly my type of party . 
  frankly , i 'm getting the feeling that you 're working * against * the best interests of the group here . 
  i do n't want to imply anything , but i 'll be keeping an eye on you . 
  it 's more of a filler game that you play while still waiting for the rest of the group to arrive . 
  probably works better with kids than resistance or werewolf . 
  all in all , i 'd recommend getting that third kid . 
  in short , have a [ look at this board for 10 players . 
  ] ( https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1428044.jpg ) ( you use a different board depending on number of players . ), 
  the players are a resistance group that wants to conduct operations against the government . 
  but as the board tells you , 4 players are actually spies sent by the government to infiltrate the group . 
  the game has five rounds . 
  in the first round , the group leader selects 3 group members ( may include himself ) to go on mission . 
  then comes a first vote , where all players either approve this team or reject it . 
  if it is rejected , the next player selects a team and tries to get it approved . 
  once a team is approved for a mission , only the members of the team play one card each , face-down . 
  these cards tell whether they try to make the operation succeed ( which normal resistance members always want ) or fail ( which spies usually want , but sometimes it would make their role too obvious ) . 
  if a `` fail '' card was played , the operation fails . 
  then the next player becomes group leader , and selects a team to go on the second mission . 
  if three missions succeed , the resistance wins . 
  if three missions fail , the spies win . 
  i doubt that they have a `` landlord '' in the typical sense . 
  the players who are on an approved team are each given one fail and one success card before they vote . 
  they pick on card and put it down on the table , and all the left-over cards are returned . 
  you have no cards `` on your hand '' ( except for your `` character card , the one card telling you whether you are resistance or a spy ) . 
  that point does n't stand at all , it 's flat out wrong . 
  they are [ * reformed * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calvinism ) . 
  if you want to add something , call the reformed church , reformed tradition , or reformed christianity . 
  saying `` reformed catholics '' is just weird . 
   migrants do n't commit more crimes than germans when adjusted for economic status , which makes the point moot . 
  does n't really make the point moot . 
  so the immigrants would n't be more criminal than germans if they were n't poorer , more likely male , young , urban and unemployed - but they * are * all these things . 
  i only ever heard this in the card game [ illuminati ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illuminati_%28game%29 ) . 
  most people wo n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i do n't think anybody will be offended , it 's too obviously a humorous expression for that . 
  typically , you would n't tip at all in a german hotel . 
  `` i eat things like you , but not your size . '', 
  `` i eat things your size , but not like you . '', 
  but you , unlike me , did n't repost it . 
  therefore i , alone , get to reap in all that sweet second-hand karma . 
  seriously , stupid kids are ruining this . 
  the whole point is that both sides have plausible deniability , and an enjoyable evening either way . 
  i 'm afraid you probably ca n't .
