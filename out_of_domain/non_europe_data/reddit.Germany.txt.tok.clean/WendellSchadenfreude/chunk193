  being available for only 3 months and not speaking german probably makes it next to impossible to find a job . 
  as others have mentioned , it might be easier if you simply do n't tell potential employers that you plan to leave so soon - but that can of course hurt you in the long run , because you wo n't get a good `` arbeitszeugnis '' ( employer testimonial ) and future employers might wonder why you quit after so short a time . 
  what does your partner do ? 
  having contacts could get you a job , if they need some short-time help . 
  overall , i 'm sorry to say this , but i think your chances for a job in germany are slim . 
  best finish your studies , or take up a craft . 
  ( i just mention this because you say you already dropped out of university twice . 
  university is n't for everyone , and it 's not the end of the world if you decide to drop out for good and learn a craft or a trade . ),

  quoting wikipedia :, 
   since the akp 's rise to power , cumhuriyet has been particularly renowned for its impartial , occasionally courageous journalism . 
  in 2015 it was awarded the freedom of press prize by international ngo reporters without borders for making a stand against the government 's mounting pressure . 
  do you read any international news about turkey ? 
  you should try it sometime . 
  as a german , i love reading articles from journalists who know my country well but still have an outside view . 
  ( the swiss newspaper neue z\u00fcrcher zeitung is fantastic for that . ), 
  german journalists often share the same boring view on things , even though they are free to write whatever they want . 
  in turkey , fear of government repression must make this problem much worse . 
  i recommend the economist . 
  well then , answer like an adult without sarcasm : do you ever read anything foreigners write about turkey ? 
  because claiming that cumhuriyet is nothing but smear campaigns reeks of the narrow-minded turkish nationalismus this sub is quite familiar with . 
   includes giving weird secrets, 
  weird secrets like turkey supporting isis ? 
  i could understand the anger , except that 's barely a secret anymore , and you should be angry because it 's * happening * , not because somebody reports on it .

  ] ( http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/625443/jewish/is-blood-transfusion-permissible-in-jewish-belief.htm ), 
   furthermore , according to jewish belief , saving a life is one of the most important mitzvot ( commandments ) , overriding nearly all of the others . 
  ( the exceptions are murder , certain sexual offenses , and idol-worship -- we can not transgress these even to save a life . ), 
  therefore , if a blood transfusion is deemed medically necessary , then it is not only permissible but obligatory .

  your translation is correct . 
  using `` zum '' this way sounds like corporate speech to me , but it 's also somewhat more precise than all alternatives .
