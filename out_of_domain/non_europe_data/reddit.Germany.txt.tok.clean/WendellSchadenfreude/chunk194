  some people will believe that you 're a muslim and will dislike you for it , but that does n't really affect you . 
  you are more likely to be spontaneously attacked in the street if you stay in the us than if you come to germany . 
  you might feel like people are staring at you a lot , but that 's just how germans look at anything we find interesting - it 's not seen as offensive in germany . 
  all of the countries you listed are still safer than america . 
  just like america , they also have places that are less safe than others . 
  the bad places in america are far worse than the bad places in germany . 
  this is n't meant to be america-bashing , by the way : i know most places in the us are perfectly safe as well . 
  just trying to put things into perspective . 
  when travelling the countries you listed , you hardly need to worry about violence . 
  bad things can happen anywhere , but it 's not very likely in these places . 
  enjoy your trip !,

  a [ food chopper ] ( http://www.sencor.eu/getattachment/5b587875-7fa3-450b-9eed-8fbcdfbf304f/shb-4310.aspx ) would also have been fun , and somewhat less terrifying . 
  `` cleaver '', 
  now that you mention it , it * is * an interesting source . 
  you 're misreading that . 
  they 're calling * themselves * the resistance . 
  they are the islamic resistance against zionism , imperialism and all that stuff . 
  it has nothing to do with the current war , they 've been using the name for a long time .

  i think you wo n't find two germans who agree exactly on what the difference between these three words is , so for all practical purposes , they mean the same thing . 
  i would say that * lustig * is the most respectful ( funny on purpose ) , while * komisch * is closer to stupid-funny ; but i 'm sure there are germans who 'd disagree .

  saa and ypg will likely come to some form of agreement instead of openly fighting in this war . 
  this agreement will certainly not include the formation of a syrian kurdish `` state '' , but the kurds will remain in control of their own land and have extensive autonomy , officially or de-facto . 
  al-bab will not be part ot the autonomous kurdish regions , and the kurds will not have a problem with that .

  [ here 's a list of mistakes tolkien made . 
  ] ( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/mistakes_and_inconsistencies_in_tolkien's_works ), 
  it 's not a lot , but no man is perfect . 
  i started playing long war a while ago , and i love it . 
  however , i 'm now at a point in my first serious campaign where i wonder if i should just give up . 
  i do n't think i made any * huge * mistakes - i 've never been squad-wiped , and i was able to keep up with exalt and the aliens for a while . 
  but recently , there have been more and more missions that i simply had to retreat from . 
  i have mostly beam weapons , just researched gauss weapons ( although alloy shortage did n't allow me to produce more than one rifle so far ) , and when several mechtoids show up at the same time , there 's nothing i can do but run . 
  cyberdiscs also seem to have become near invulnerable recently . 
  my biggest problem is that more and more countries are leaving the council - i 'm down to five now . 
  is that normal ? 
  should i keep fighting , or is it time to give up and start a new campaign ? 
  really ? 
  but the languages are n't closely related at all - is that just coincidence , or is this a loan word from one of these languages to the other ? 
   whats the vice versa ? 
  spit on a hog ( as in : a pig covered in saliva ) , obviously . 
  it 's really quite disgusting . 
  easy fix for that : [ annex abkhazia . 
  instead of thinking about the universere , maybe it helps if you start thinking about it from the other end :, 
  if you had only three atoms in total , called a , b , and c , you 'd already have 6 different ways to arrange these atoms : abc , acb , bac , bca , cab , and cba . 
  add a fourth atom , and there 's dabc , adbc , abdc , abcd , dacb , adcb , acdb , acbd , dbac , bdac , badc , bacd , dbca , bdca , bcad , bcad , dcab , cdab , cadb , cabd , dcba , cdba , cbda , and cbad - 24 ways to arrange them !, 
  a fifth atom brings it up to 120 different ways . 
  the number of ways in which objects can be arranged is vastly higher than the number of objects . 
  now of course this does n't help if the universe is literally infinite , but it at least means that the number of combinations of something can easily be higher than the number of atoms in the [ ( definitely finite ) part of the universe that can theoretically be observed from earth .

   according to eurostat , eu member states received 626,000 asylum applications in 2014 , the highest number since the 672,000 applications received in 1992 , [ 18 ] and granted protection status to more than 185,000 asylum seekers . 
  [ 19 ] the number of asylum applications doubled to 1,221,855 in 2015 .

  they support minimum wages , gender quota , `` wage equality '' laws , the `` energiewende '' , ending of nuclear energy , stricter regulations for financial markets , earlier retirements and of course , last but not least , unregulated mass immigration . 
   i `` applaud '' your `` subtle '' use of quotation marks . 
  `` thanks '' . 
  the point about conservative parties is actually interesting . 
  it * is * fun to see conservative politicians defending the right of women to dress `` provocatively '' ( see what i did there ? ), 
  in public or the right of people to be openly gay . 
  but still : all the issues listed are examples for things that conservatives in germany would have opposed just a few years ago , and now they are expected to support or accept them - it should be easy to see why one might find the cdu `` more on the left than they ever were before '' . 
  whether you think that 's a good thing or not is up to you . 
  also , learn the difference between immigration and asylum . 
  i do n't think `` unregulated mass asylum '' would be any less catchy , but it would be less accurate . 
  at the very least , * both * things are happening in germany right now . 
  as long as they make no attempt at regulating the obviously most important point ( the * number * of immigrants that are accepted every year ) , i do n't think that describing it as `` unregulated '' is inaccurate . 
  i hope you read german , because [ this article ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/die-uebergriffe-in-koeln-und-falsche-zahlen-von-der-wiesn-14004617.html ) explains nicely that what you wrote is nonsense . 
  after new years in cologne , there were several hundred reported sexual assaults because of a group of around 1,000 men . 
  at the oktoberfest in the last few years , there have been between 0 and 6 rapes per year , at an event with 5 + million visitors . 
   the point was that a phrase like `` more on the left than they ever were before '' suggests that there was an unproportional shift to the left, 
  ... and there clearly was . 
  can you even name a few political topics where the cdu still is significantly to the right of the spd ? 
  just one or two to warm a conservative 's heart ? 
  ( i 'm not talking about myself , by the way . 
  i 'm not much of a conservative . 
  i just acknowledge that the cdu is n't , either . ), 
  by the way , conservative parties are not always simply forced to accept a new progressive status quo . 
  a recent counter-example from germany is pedophilia . 
  in the 70s and 80s , [ many progressives demanded a legalization of pedophilia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4dophilie-debatte_%281970er_und_1980er_jahre%29 ) , which conservatives opposed . 
  nowadays , the conservatives have simply won this particular debate .
