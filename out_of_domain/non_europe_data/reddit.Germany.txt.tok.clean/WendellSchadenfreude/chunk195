  i am disappoint .

  austria decided on an upper limit of refugees that they want to accept this year . 
  we 'll see how that works out . 
  but in my opinion , any talk about immigration , asylum and integration is just noise as long as you are unwilling to define for how many people your plans could actually work . 
  i would not have expected a huge difference between these three newspapers . 
  if anything , the * welt * should be a bit * less * `` sophisticated '' / highbrow/intellectual than the other two . 
  the german translation is actually called `` wer die nachtigall st\u00f6rt '' , `` he who disturbs the nightingale '' . 
  they changed it to some other bird that sings prettily , but i have no idea why they changed the `` kill '' part . 
   sooo i 'm german and nobody here is `` outraged '' . 
  that is not true . 
  at the very least , many germans of russian descent are . 
  here are some reports about protests by russo-germans . 
  only a few hundred at each protest , but it 's still quite impressive that the russian media can mobilize that many people in germany . 
  ( imagine what they can do in estonia or latvia . ), 
  in your comment : geld egal . 
  it would definitely work , but i 'd recommend getting enemy unknown instead . 
  it 's still fun , much cheaper , and all of its worst bugs have been fixed . 
  if you do n't like it ( xcom is great , but not for eveyone ) , you wasted only very little money . 
  if you love it , you can still get xcom2 ( and it might already be cheaper and mostly bug-free at that point ) . 
  or get enemy within and long war at that point , and wait for another couple of months . 
  since there are many non-natives here , i 'll explain the joke :, 
  there is an expression , [ `` to throw the baby out with the bathwater '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/don't_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater ) , meaning to unintentionally eliminate something good while trying to get rid of something bad . 
  it is a great wordplay . 
   so somehow they lost 3 people but clinton 's vote went up by 14 . 
  clinton 's vote went up by 22 . 
  - are you trying to commit voter fraud ? 
   for the second count , the hillary side just added the new people they saw join their side . 
  assuming that they did * this * count correctly , it 's enough anyway . 
  there were only 34 votes for o'malley + undecided in the first round , with sanders and clinton at 215 and 210 . 
  if 22 of these 34 people joined the clinton side , they have 232 votes and a 17-vote lead , with only 12 undecided votes left . 
  sure , it 's * possible * that dozens of clinton supporters left or switched sides ( while * no * sanders supporters did ) , but it does n't seem likely . 
  it 's neither , and linking there did n't make any sense . 
  it 's a perfectly drama-free and amusing sub with `` selfies of the soul '' , including stuff like this :, 
  if `` the apple never falls far from the tree '' is close enough for you , you can simply say the same thing in german : `` der apfel f\u00e4llt nicht weit vom stamm . '', 
   i believe clinton only won by 4 county delegates, 
  clinton won by 4 `` state delegate equivalents '' , which is a lot more than just 4 county delegates . 
  [ this article explains it . 
  ] ( http://www.npr.org/2016/02/02/465268206/coin-toss-fact-check-no-coin-flips-did-not-win-iowa-for-hillary-clinton ) the coin flips did not matter . 
  they make a difference , for one in 11,000 delegates each . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.npr.org/2016/02/02/465268206/coin-toss-fact-check-no-coin-flips-did-not-win-iowa-for-hillary-clinton ) explains it very well . 
  the coin flips did not matter . 
   and when she won by literally the virtue of 6 coin flips ,, 
  [ she did not . 
  ] ( http://www.npr.org/2016/02/02/465268206/coin-toss-fact-check-no-coin-flips-did-not-win-iowa-for-hillary-clinton ) the coin flips did n't matter . 
   while that is a great article , it does say that hillary only won by 4 county delegates ( 701 vs. 697 ) . 
  those are the `` state delegate equivalents '' . 
  the things hillary won by coin flip were a handful of these here :, 
   those precinct caucuses elected ** 11,065 delegates ** to the county conventions , which take place march 12 . 
   and here 's the root of what 's causing all the confusion : ** the breakdown of those 11,065 is not reported on caucus night .

  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  my guess : it will officially be the former , de facto the latter . 
  the picture is from 2005 . 
  none of the people in it have been president since it was taken . 
  two of them are n't even eligible . 
  i thought the [ 22nd ammendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-second_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) was pretty clear :, 
   no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice [ ... ], 
  bill clinton has been elected twice , he is therefore no longer eligible . 
   is ccd still causing decline in bee populations ? 
  more precisely : it still is * not * doing it , and never has . 
  [ here 's a graph showing the number of beehives in the world . 
  ] ( http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-05-1451953254-310201-beehivesworlwide.png ) it has been steadily increasing over the past few decades . 
  this is a much * smaller * threat than people make it out to be , in that it simply is n't happening at all . 
  [ the number of honeybee hives has increased steadily over the last few decades . 
  ] ( http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-05-1451953254-310201-beehivesworlwide.png ) the [ article ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/post_10802_b_8913974.html ) from which i took the graph seems to be somewhat worried about some species of wild bees , but not all that much overall . 
  there is no huge threatening crisis happening that the general public is unaware of - on the contrary , many laymen are worried about something that really * is n't * happening . 
  * friends * ' take on it :, 
  [ `` we might have to repopulate the earth .

  `` and * condoms * are the way to do that ? '', 
  i want to be a jerk . 
  when you write `` would of '' , you sound like a moron . 
  because it 's hard to keep a level head when this stuff is actually happening to you , it 's useful to think about it a little bit before it happens . 
  it 's obvious that you should not sign some long-ass document that you are not allowed to read when you 're being laid of . 
  it 's obvious that the managers who are doing this to you do n't have * your * best interests at heart . 
  it 's obvious that they have no real leverage to * make * you sign - what are they gon na do , fire you ? 
  if they could give you a * worse * deal , they already would have . 
  these things are obvious , and yet they certainly are hard to see when you really are in a situation where you feel your world is crashing down around you . 
  it 's understandable that you might lose your head and sign whatever you are presented in a situation like this . 
  but you really should n't . 
  a total of around [ 60k foreign soldiers , about 40k of them are americans . 
  german opinion of these soldiers is generally good . 
  if germany were `` in the grip of the usa '' , we would have participated in the iraq war . 
  [ england , spain , and some of our neighbours did ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/coalition_of_the_willing.svg ) , we did n't - because schr\u00f6der did n't want to , and there 's nothing the us could do about that . 
  the sanctions against russia were decided by the eu , not the us . 
  they are not in our economic interest , sure , but they might be in our * political * interest . 
   closing that border against isil is more important, 
  more important than what , and to whom ? 
  i do n't understand this part of your post . 
  the easiest way to close that border against isis once and for all is to let the ypg do its job . 
  once the cantons are connected , the border is sealed . 
   you answered your own question . 
  i did n't , and neither did you . 
  even if i accept everything you wrote , saying that `` closing the border against isil is more important '' obviously is * not * turkey 's position - that 's why i do n't understand what you are refering to by this . 
  the turkish government obviously thinks that making life difficult for the ypg is much more important than doing the same thing against isis . 
  that would dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama does n't know what he 's doing .
