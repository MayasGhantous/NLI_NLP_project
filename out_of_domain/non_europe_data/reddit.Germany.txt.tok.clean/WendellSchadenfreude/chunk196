  definitly simply ** do n't do it . 
  valentine 's day is for lovers , not for friends . 
  tell her exactly what you tell all of your other friends on valentine 's : * nothing * . 
  if you just want to do it because she 's single on valentine 's and you want to do something nice , do n't worry : as a german , she likely does n't care about this day at all . 
  most stereotypes about germans are very positive . 
  i 've never encountered any negative reactions from people who learned that i was german . 
  some lame jokes , possibly , but that really only makes it easier - you already know what the jokes will be about , and the stereotype already is that you as a german have no sense of humor : you now either just confirm that stereotype by not finding the jokes funny , or you immediately become `` the fun german '' by joining in . 
   next they 'll be upset when they find out you can do your confession online . 
  honestly , i ca n't even tell if you 're joking . 
  you could try to sound nicer . 
  there 's nothing about turkey attacking the saa on the frontpage . 
  i 've seen some reports about this ( mostly by russian conspiracy sites ) , but nothing credible . 
  i 'm so disappointed . 
  i thought you were the first * time traveller * . 
  ... * damn * ... 
  which was awesome . 
  if you liked it , maybe pick up xcom : enemy unknown . 
  at first , it might feel like the game has been dumbed down , but it gets a lot better after a while . 
  this is working as intended . 
  it looks weird because people mostly posts when outrageous stuff happened to them . 
  the chance for all the shots in op 's gif to be misses was probably somewhere between 5 and 10 % . 
  stuff like this will happen to you a few times in a campaign , but definitely not on every mission . 
  how do you think a giant would stand any chance against a dragon ? 
   `` our ** clerks does n't ** speak english well , so we need to ** wright ** it '', 
  that sounds * exactly * like something the people in that store would think . 
  since everybody else has given the correct answer ( `` depends on your job , but in most office jobs : yes . '' ), 
  already , i want to add one more aspect :, 
  no , we ca n't - for health reasons . 
  teenagers can eat whenever they want whatever they want , and their bodies seem to be happy . 
  adults who eat whenever they want will come apart at the seams very quickly . 
  ask away !, 
  the hivemind will help you . 
  pointing out mistakes that align so well with the topic of the comment is a form of schadenfreude that would be totally acceptable in my country , but maybe not anywhere else . 
  anyway , it was meant as a light-hearted joke . 
  in case anyone is wondering what the mistakes were : it should either be `` our clerk does n't '' ( if it 's one clerk ) or `` our clerks do n't '' ( more than one clerk ) , and it should be `` so we need to write it '' ( write that sign ) or possibly `` so we need to right it '' ( we need to make it right ) . 
  i do n't get the * spiegel * sometimes . 
   1:50 off-voice : `` even though there are no opposition troops in the city [ of aleppo ] , [ ... ] '', 
  this is an obvious and stupid lie . 
  if there were no opposition troops , the government would simply waltz in and the war would be over for aleppo . 
   erdogan might be a maniacal , authoritarian jerk but shooting his own people ? 
  given that some of his most important advisors were caught on tape discussing a false flag attack in 2014 , i certainly would n't put it past him . 
  [ [ in case you do n't know what i 'm talking about , here 's wikipedia about the former head of the turkish national intelligence organisation .

  legitimacy is not a problem . 
  legitimacy can be manufactured . '' ], 
  still , as long as we know nothing , there is no reason to speculate about this . 
  it 's not unrealistic to assume pkk or isis involvement . 
  whose hypocrisy ? 
   you want the offensive forces to win , but not without losses . 
  why would you want * that * ? 
  same thing , but nusairis is a derogatory term . 
  do n't call them that . 
   skin softer than down, 
  because this part made no sense to me at first , i 'm sure there wil be other people ( non-natives ) with the same problem : [ `` down '' are soft feathers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/down_feather ), 
  is it because they can both be translated as `` to determine '' ? 
  * feststellen * is mostly `` to find out '' . 
  things already are what they are , and you just * stell fest * that they are . 
  * festlegen * is mostly `` to define '' . 
  you * leg fest * what things should be like . 
   a colored man, 
  not sure if you 're aware , but `` colored '' is not considered a polite term in english . 
  `` black '' is better . 
  asking german reddit this is like asking american reddit : `` i hear some worrying things about bernie sanders - would he really be a bad president ? '', 
  the answers you get are not necessarily representative of the general opinion or the actual situation . 
  that is somehow different from `` colored '' . 
  the only context in which `` colored '' is pc ( in the us at least ) nowadays is the naacp . 
   in the 21st century , colored is generally not regarded as a politically correct term . 
  [ 1 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] however , it lives on in the association name national association for the advancement of colored people , generally called naacp . 
   in 2008 carla sims , communications director for the naacp in washington , d.c. , said `` the term ` colored ' is not derogatory , [ the naacp ] chose the word ` colored ' because it was the most positive description commonly used [ in 1909 , when the association was founded ] . 
  it 's outdated and antiquated but not offensive . '', 
  certainly not as offensive as many other terms , but not the best translation for `` farbige '' either . 
  ( although i think that term is also falling out of fashion . ), 
  her belief in homeopathy is probably diluted by a large number of positive traits , which makes it accep - ... no , wait !, 
  now that i think about it , that would only make it * worse * !, 
   [ dal or dhal ( ipa : [ d\u032aa\u02d0l ] ) is a dried pulse ( lentil , pea or various types of bean ) which has been split . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dal ) the word dal is also used to name the thick stew prepared from these pulses , an important part of indian , nepali , pakistani , sri lankan and bangladeshi cuisine . 
  dal or lentils is staple food eaten with rice and roti or chapati ( wheat-based flat bread ) throughout india , pakistan , bangladesh and nepal where dal bhat ( literally : dhal and rice ) is the staple food for much of the population . 
  dal is a ready source of proteins for a balanced diet containing no meat . 
  that fetus certainly was stillborn . 
  i 'm sure what they mean is more like these kids .

  pulling an image of a broken watch off the internet ^ ^ 1 and putting it up in the store would take less than five minutes , so this does n't show that this was a planned attack at all . 
  but if it was : yeah , so what ? 
  like preparing for a debate is a bad thing . 
  the image is the third one that comes up when you google `` broken watch '' . 
  good post . 
  except for the typo in * arzt * , please fix that . 
  i do n't think so . 
  but that would n't change if colors were switched for the regime and non-isis rebels . 
  the regime is red in most other maps , the rebels green . 
  in this map , the regime is green and the rebels are orange . 
  that is so sweet .
