  yup . 
  for anyone wondering : that means this gif has been used in the most relevant way possible . 
  cause and effect may be diffucult to discern in this case . 
  people who do n't like foreigners in general are less likely to voluntarily establish contact with refugees , while those with a very positive view are more likely to volunteer in refugee camps or even look for jobs that regularly would bring them in contact with refugees . 
  from the given data , we ca n't really tell whether contact with refugees makes people more worried or less . 
  hope this still comes in time : are there former rebel fighters among the refugees who are leaving the country because they are losimg the war ? 
  if so , how many ? 
  da war alles in ordnung . 
  the us is supporting factions that fight the saa . 
  the tow program was one of the most important factors for many of the rebel successes . 
  there were times in this war when the us might have directly supported the rebels , if only they had cut all ties al-qaeda . 
  now that wo n't happen any more , of course . 
   i do n't mean like accidentally using the singular when they intended to use plural . 
  i mean using the wrong cases or articles . 
  especially word-endings/declentions . 
   does it happen often ? 
  essentially never . 
  native speakers do n't have to think about rules and grammar . 
  your native language and its grammar are as natural to you as breathing or walking , and it does n't matter how complicated your language 's grammar is . 
  walking is horribly complicated when you think about it - but none of us think about it , we just walk . 
  grammatical mistakes of the sort that you describe ( `` i have many book '' , `` i goed to the park yesterday '' , `` he play a game '' ) never happen to natives , ^ ^ 1 and they always stand out when foreigners make them - they are completely obvious even to natives who do n't formally know anything about grammar and have no way of describing * why * something is wrong . 
  1 ) slang or dialects notwithstanding . 
  just to clarify : a `` saunaclub '' is basically a brothel , right ? 
  it 's just a prank , cuz !, 
  not really true nowadays . 
  you hardly find those any more , except sometimes in old people 's houses . 
   which button has the bigger flush ?

   because the us are losing . 
  since the question was about isis , this is simply nonsense . 
  isis has suffered major defeats against both the kurds ( [ tel abyad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tell_abyad_offensive ) , [ hasakah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_al-hasakah_%28june%e2%80%93august_2015%29 ) , [ tishrin dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tishrin_dam_offensive ) , ... ) and the iraqi army ( [ ramadi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramadi#iraq.27s_recapture_of_the_city ) ) - the two factions most decidedly supported by the us . 
  the us also half-heartedly supports some syrian rebel groups - and those groups are in fact losing . 
  but they are losing to the government , not isis . 
  isis ' last offensives against the rebels ( the attacks on mare ) pretty much stalled without any significant gains . 
   the remaining seiged garrisons around the country, 
  after dez , are there really any left ? 
  fua and kafarya ( the villages east of idlib ) - is n't that it ? 
  not including the saa garrisons in hasakah province , who are surrounded by the kurds , not fsa or rebels . 
  morale within the saa at this point must be pretty high anyway , as well as the confidence that they can actually win this war . 
  i once heard a security worker at an airport joke about germans always having haribo somewhere in their carry-on luggage . 
  i know i never travel without . 
   he decided to be come a masseuse . 
  unless becoming a completely different person included a sex change , he became a [ masseur . 
  i know , it sounds weird - the female form is simply much more common . 
  no to all . 
  the sentences are fine , all suggested alternatives are wrong or at least change the meaning . 
  `` ich freue mich daran '' works , although it sounds oldfashioned , but it now means `` i 'm happy about it '' , not `` looking forward to it '' . 
  `` ich \u00e4rgere mich darauf '' only works if you are talking about some location that you are standing on while being angry . 
  `` bist du dabei sicher '' is itself at least questionable , it should simply be `` bist du ( dir ) da sicher '' ( if what you mean to say is * `` are you sure about that ?

  building a roughly humanoid robot that can beat humans in tennis would be interesting . 
  building a wall behind a tennis net would be much more efficient , but also utterly boring . 
  bush sr. won it in 1988 , and every republican before him since 1968 . 
  but you 're right , the democratic lead in illinois has been pretty solid since 1996 , and the state is practically guaranteed to stay blue in this election . 
  because unlike the poles they would * not * kill protesters for this kind of behaviour ? 
  just showing how high the wall will be ? 
  you 're right that this could easily be used as a campaign ad , but i would n't condemn the woman without some context . 
  she might just be doing this sarcastically after just having been called a fascist or something . 
  might still be a good comparison . 
  at most occassions where there is antifa violence in europe , there are also peaceful protests , with far larger numbers of people participating . 
  and the media do the same thing . 
  that 's some * interesting * context .

  it 's seems extremely easy to prevent this kind of scam : just glue one or two little plastic bumps on random spots on the surface of the scanner - before thieves are able to install anything on top of the scanner , they would now have to remove these spacers . 
  i believe the opposite is much more true . 
  `` refugee camps ` recruit ' from the rebels '' , i.e. 
  rebel fighters who feel they are losing just pack up and leave the country as refugees . 
  you 're linking to the wrong 538 article here . 
  [ this is the delegate tracker . 
  ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/democrats/ ) it tells you which candidate is `` on track '' to win 50 % +1 of all pledged delegates . ^ ^ 1 in the elections so far , clinton has won more than she `` needed '' , so if both candidates basically kept their current level of support among all demographics , clinton would clearly win . 
  however , her target for today is 365 delegates , compared to only 326 for sanders . 
  if clinton wins by 25 delegates , as suggested by / u/rpolitics4trump , this will actually be a good result for sanders . 
  1 ) sanders will probably need slightly more than that so that the superdelegates do n't tip the convention in clinton 's favor , but let 's ingnore that for a moment . 
  well , kind of . 
  it 's more precise to say that he would still * not * be on a path to winning - but if he loses by a few delegates today , that actually brings him closer winning overall . 
  [ according to 538 ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/democrats/ ) , if both candidates were on track to win exactly 50 % +1 of the pledged delegates , clinton would win 365 today , and sanders only 326 . 
  sanders would need fewer because the states voting today are somewhat unfavorable to him , and most of the states yet to come should be `` easier '' for him . 
  however , clinton has outperformed her `` delegation tracker '' so far , so she is on track to win by more than just one pledged delegate . 
  to stay on track , she will need only additional 275 delegates today ( although everything below 365 means she 's losing some of her lead ) . 
   i 'm willing to have it all crumble to affect the change i desire . 
  i think this is one of the rare cases where you should absolutely use `` effect '' instead of `` affect '' , even though it 's a verb . 
  you hope that electing trump will [ * cause * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/effect#verb ) a change . 
  think `` cause and effect '' . 
  if you vote for trump to affect a change , you think that the change is already happening and that electing trump will [ alter that change ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affect#verb ) in a way that you prefer - which , if you * actually * want warren or sanders , sounds like the opposite of what you want .
