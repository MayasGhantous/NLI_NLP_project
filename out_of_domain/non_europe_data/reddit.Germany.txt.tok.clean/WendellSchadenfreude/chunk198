   if you do n't know if you believe in something then you do n't . 
  i do n't know if i believe in the truth of that statement . 
  when you ( 1 ) put string around a ball and ( 2 ) take a piece of string that goes around the same ball at 1 meter distance , then it does n't matter how big the ball actually is : the difference in length between the two pieces of string will always be 2pi meters ( and 2pi is very roughly 6 ) . 
  you can test this yourself with a tennis ball and a soccer ball . 
  mathematically , this is trivial , but it still sounds surprising when talking about very large balls ( such as mine ) . 
  this is a good one . 
  i 'm completely sure that you are wrong , but i do n't dare just looking in a mirror because i 'm scared to find out that i really look like a freak with my eyes in the middle of my face . 
  this will also trip up some germans , and some might claim that you should say it some other way , but it 's really the only way of saying it . 
  an example of where this sometimes causes trouble is when comparing angela merkel to previous german chancellors . 
  `` merkel ist die beste/schlechteste kanzlerin , die deutschland jemals hatte '' does n't really mean anything , because she 's the * only * `` kanzlerin '' . 
  but saying that she 's `` der beste/schlechteste kanzler '' sounds somewhat odd ( but is correct nontheless ) . 
   `` they say that france 's methods against terrorism are right , but when we operate against terrorists , they say we go against democracy , freedom , human rights and the rule of law .

   to my defence , all of my books and cad tools are american . 
   defence, 
  explain yourself !, 
  sometimes that works well , sometimes it does n't . 
  in this case , it sounds like op wants to talk about something that had to do with the fact that his boss was female . 
  if you start a story like that with `` in meinem ersten job hatte ich eine chefin '' , you 'd probaby have to stress the * - in * a lot to make your point clear - that would also sound weird . 
  if you just want to talk about your first boss and the gender does n't matter all that much for the story , you could easily go with `` in meinem ersten job hatte ich eine chefin , die total verr\u00fcckt war ! '', 
  the numbers come from s\u00e4po , the swedish counter-espionage and counter-terrorism agency . 
  this almost certainly means that they are not talking about crime in general ( that 's not their business at all ) , but specifically about terrorism . 
  [ frauen d\u00fcrfen im iran seit einigen jahren die meisten mint-f\u00e4cher n\u00e4mlich gar nicht mehr studieren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_gender_restrictions_in_education#20_august_2012_course_ban ) , worauf der von dir verlinkte artikel aber gar nicht eingeht . 
   i do n't think it 's true that women ca n't negotiate . 
  but i do think that they have to do it differently from the way men do . 
  that is not the `` actual report '' , you 're just quoting the article . 
  s\u00e4po * is * involved with some kinds of crime - terrorism is a kind of criminal activity after all . 
  s\u00e4po is not usually involved with rape , assault , theft , burglary or any number of other `` normal '' crime . 
  it would be very surprising if statistics about this sort of crime are also reported by s\u00e4po . 
  unless you can show me otherwise from the actual report , i will believe that `` crime '' in this context only refers to the kind of crime that s\u00e4po actually deals with , not to crime in general . 
   see page 70 of the report for the english summary . 
  link ? 
  the only report i could find ( on s\u00e4po 's homepage ) was barely more than 70 pages long even in the swedish complete version , and it dealt exclusively with counter-espionage and counter-terrorism stuff . 
  when a member of s\u00e4po talks about `` crime '' , i do n't find it so outrageous to assume that they could mean the kind of of crime that s\u00e4po actually has to deal with . 
  i 'm absoultely willing to believe that this is about crime in general - but you 'd have to show me something better than a no-context one-line quote from a press conference . 
  too bad also that it covers the period from 1997-2001 and includes only permanent swedish residents . 
  and that it states `` it is two and a half times as likely for persons born abroad to be registered as crime suspects as it is for swedish born persons with both parents born in sweden . '', 
  man , i really hope that this is the report / u/exegene was talking about . 
  because it would hardly be possible to be * more * wrong .

  your answer is wrong . 
  the answer from the key means `` if only i had cooked myself '' . 
  i guess you were going for `` cooked * for * myself '' , which would be `` h\u00e4tte ich doch f\u00fcr mich selbst gekocht . '', 
  that would be correct , but the answer they give sounds better . 
  you use * selbst * this way when you do n't really need it . 
  you say * selbst * is being used alone , but that 's not quite true : it 's * ich [ ... ] selbst * . 
  you can take out the * selbst * and do n't really change the sentence ( `` h\u00e4tte ich doch gekocht '' ) , only then you 'd have to really put some stress on the * ich * to make it clear that this is the key word .

  i never heard of this until now ; i 'm pretty sure you wo n't find it in any normal german supermarket . 
  most germans will simply think that this is a weird question , because they do n't care about history enough to have an answer to it . 
  for those who care about history : yes , i believe most would see the hre as '' ( mostly ) german '' . 
  before that , there were [ six germanic tribes ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_st%c3%a4mme ) that are traditionally seen as `` proto-germans '' : bayuvars ( i.e. 
  bavarians ) , swabians ( or alemans ) , francs , saxons , thuringians , and frisians . 
  there is no work-around .

  do n't learn `` apfel '' , learn `` der apfel '' .

  your bank always assumes that you have to pay taxes on all of the interest they pay you , and so they automatically send these taxes to the government . 
  but for the first 800 $ , you actually do n't have to pay taxes - but your bank ca n't know if these * are * the first 800 : you might have accounts with other banks as well . 
  freistellungsauftrag just means that you tell your bank not to pay taxes on the first 800 $ . 
  yes , because they ca n't tell if it 's legally yours or the other person 's . 
  most commonly used in `` je ... , desto ... '', 
  je mehr , desto besser - the more , the better .
