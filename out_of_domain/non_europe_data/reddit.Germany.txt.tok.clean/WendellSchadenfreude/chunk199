  you can probably also tell your bank in advance not to allow them to withdraw money from your account anymore .

  it 's not `` schaue '' , it 's `` glaube '' . 
  when you need an infusion , you do n't want the doctors to first take 30 minutes to calibrate their pumps .

  i walk on escalators all the time , and i see other people doing it as well . 
  germany . 
  i had no idea this was a thing , but [ this video shows the escalator training of the austrian police .

  two of them fit nicely on the escalator next to each other . 
  i 'm quite embarassed , but i have to ask : what he does with the bread around 35 minutes , building that hamburger - is that the way it 's meant to be used ? 
   she has a hypothesis , not a theory . 
  she has a theory , since she 's using normal-person language . 
  sorry for being pedantic , but people using `` medieval '' to mean anything old is one of my pet peeves . 
  pineapples , being a new world plant , were not known in the middle ages ( which is a period that only exists in european history ) . 
  the middle ages ended when america was discovered . 
  ( either by definition , or just around the same time . ), 
  pineapples were used in europe [ for decoration in the 18th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pineapple#history ) , which is part of the [ early modern period . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_europe ), 
  parts of it are a bit unsettling . 
   a problem with the plan was that it did not discuss how to attack the empire if canada declared its neutrality , which the authors believed was likely . 
  ( the plan advised against accepting such a declaration without permission to occupy canadian ports and some land until the war ended . ), 
  `` the canadians will likely stay neutral , but our plan assumes that they wo n't . 
  so if they do , we 'll just have to attack them anyway . '', 
  that 's pretty much how the german empire thought about belgium at the time . 
   occupying halifax , ** following a poison gas first strike ** , would deny the british a major naval base and cut links between britain and canada . 
  the fuck ? 
  they wanted to start a war with a poison gas strike on a major port city ? 
  [ correct . 
  thanks , that 's the one .

  are you so sure that you need good grounds to sue the us in a french court ? 
  or a moroccan one ? 
  or a court in thailand , china , guatemala ? 
  if you want to allow any court on the planet to accept complaints or lawsuits against foreign governments , you better have faith in the court system of any country where there are american assets of value . 
  ( the us does n't have to worry about being sued in an iranian or north korean court , because they could do nothing to harm the us even if ( `` if '' ) they were found guilty . 
  most countries could simply start confiscating american assets . ), 
  corporations ( just like people ) can sue countries already . 
  in the appropriate courts , which usually are the courts of the respective country . 
  not wanting to be sued in every kangaroo court of the planet does n't acknowledge anything but common sense . 
  as a supporter of the fdp , i 'm so happy that they failed to clear the 5 % threshold in saxony-anhalt . 
  had the fdp gotten 5 % ( rather than the 4.9 % they actually got ) , it would have been necessary to include the fdp in this coalition , which would n't have helped anyone and would only have made this coalition even more unstable and confusing . 
  you know who invented that reduced vat for hotels ? 
  the spd . 
  you know who always supported it ? 
  the left . 
  seriously . 
  you know who actually pushed for it the hardest in the black & yellow coalition ? 
  the csu . 
  if the hotel vat is your biggest problem with the fdp , you really should n't talk about other people being uneducated . 
  i do n't think that was a good decision , but it 's also one that matters quite little to me . 
  [ shame on the house of ptolemy !,

  shure , he 's [ not everybody 's type ] ( https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr03/2013/1/24/16/enhanced-buzz-8064-1359063561-3.jpg?no-auto ) , but when you claim that [ this man ] ( https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/1/24/16/enhanced-buzz-18264-1359063561-21.jpg ) never had [ any sex appeal ] ( https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/bill-cosby-portrait.jpg?w=814 ) , you 're letting your feelings undermine your judgement . 
  he [ looked like this ] ( https://blifetoday.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bill-cosby.jpg ) , * and * he was rich and famous . 
  of course not . 
  i do n't usually picture him like that either . 
  but when you claim that he never had any sex appeal , it 's obviously absurd to only think about what he looks like now . 
  it 's like saying that [ sean connery ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/590x/427594_1.jpg ) never [ had any sex appeal ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qb24x0pgvom/ur6blmnryci/aaaaaaaastc/kdemzo08u_g/s1600/sean-connery-2013.jpg ) .

  ] ( http://www.007.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dnjamesbond41.jpg ), 
   wait but , he was gorgeous ? 
  * and * rich , funny , and famous . 
  if he was only looking to get laid , he certainly would n't have needed drugs back then . 
  you seem to be handling this just the right way . 
  your sister 's fiance is an absolute ass , and also quite foolhardy for even asking that : if i were engaged to a person who suggests that my sister ( 12 years old ) should n't be invited to the wedding , there would * be * no wedding . 
  your sister is also an ass or an unbelievable push-over for accepting that demand . 
  as close family , you definitely deserve an invitation ( and a +1 ) , no matter how old you are . 
  however , it 's her wedding and her stupid choice - it 's good that you 're not making a scene about it . 
  you ca n't force them to come to their senses , and you ca n't just show up uninvited . 
  as others have said : if they change their mind and invite you after all , you should still go . 
  if they do n't , i would suggest you even send them a card ( no gift or anything , just a card ) - but after that , it 's fine if you never reach out to them again . 
  depending on what op meant by `` cutting them out of his life '' , i think this is very good advice . 
  you will see them again at family events ( since * normal * people invite all of their relatives to such events ) , so if you try to avoid them completely , it 's just going to make things difficult for you and others in the family . 
  distance yourself , but still treat her like you would treat a second cousin or something - give her a call when she has a child , and if you send everybody else a card for christmas , send her one as well . 
  i think your view is smarter and more realistic than his , and he should probably go . 
  it * can * work , and if it does n't - then the relationship would probably have failed at some point anyway . 
  however , i do n't know anything about the air force . 
  maybe it is a realistic option for him to stay closer to home , and it wo n't harm his career too much . 
  it 's very good that you 're supporting his decision either way - let him know that !, 
  absolutely . 
  for those wondering , [ here 's the full clip . 
  poorly written , but it clearly means that during the past year , a drop from 2,000 / month to 200/month occured . 
  this is a fantastic visualization . 
  i ( being european ) do n't even care about tornadoes , and i still find this fascinating to watch . 
  definitely belongs in this sub . 
  way to * use * somebody else 's idea and actually make something of it . 
  dnd is so weird , with these extreme results happening 10 % of the time . 
  other systems use 3 d20 , and it 's only an extreme result if two or three of them show a 20 ( or a 1 ) . 
  makes much more sense . 
   except that us californians rejected her from representing us by huge margins, 
  of course you did , she 's a republican . 
  no vp pick will win california for ted cruz in the general election . 
  cruz is probably hoping that she will help him win the california * primary * , where only the republicans matter . 
  that 's also why he picked her so early : he needs a boost * now * , because trump will be the nominee anyway if he wins convincingly in cali . 
  i do n't think it 's going to work , but it 's a bit of a hail mary anyway - if it * might * work , that 's enough .
