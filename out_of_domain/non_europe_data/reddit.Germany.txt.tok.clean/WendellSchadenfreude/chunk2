  reise - < br /  informationen is fine . 
  and/or it used to be a religion , but it 's not anymore . 
  they have a bunch of stuff online , but i do n't think that includes the one part that makes them interesting ... sorry . 
   however i am really self conscious about my accent and pronunciation . 
  do germans mind this ? 
  i 'm just afraid that i 'll try my hand at german , and they will switch to english if their english is better than my german . 
  i 'm afraid that might happen a lot . 
  not really because we mind your pronounciation , but because many germans will like the chance of using their english ( and might even think that 's more polite than letting you struggle with your german ) . 
  just try not to mind it too much - we do appreciate you learning our language , even if it does n't seem like it . 
  and i 'm sure your german will improve quickly . 
  ( germans always have this problem when trying to learn e.g. 
  dutch or swedish . ), 
  sure . 
  i sent you a message . 
  k\u00f6ln / cologne sounds logical . 
  special treat : if you can come there between february 7 and feb 12 , it 's karneval !, 
  if you want to see a more typical small german city , you can visit me in koblenz . 
  [ i guess you 'd be going from amsterdam to m\u00fcnchen by train . 
  https://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml in this case , you 'll likely be passing k\u00f6ln and frankfurt , among other cities . ], 
  i think asking reddit this question , you kind of already know what we are going to tell you :, 
  if you do n't take the offer , you will certainly regret it for at least a few years , possibly forever . 
  if you take the offer , you will at worst regret it for a few years , possibly never . 
  [ good idea to turn that first offer down , though . 
  mostly money , i think . 
  the bund has a lot more than the l\u00e4nder , and in the `` compromises '' that the bundesrat aggrees to , the bund usually ends up paying for almost everything . 
  other than that , party discipline might be helpful . 
  on the other hand , i 'm not even sure that i aggree with your assessment that the bundesrat * does * compromise that easily . 
  on a sidenote , i think the main power of the bundesrat lies in the fact that all it 's members are actually governments themselfes . 
  you might try comparering it rather to the european council than to any other national upper house . 
  beer to go ? 
  really ? 
  if you 're also ok with sitting down to drink your beer in the comfy atmosphere of an old brewery , here you go :, 
  if it does n't have to be 100 + years old , the number of possible choices increases massively , of course . 
  my guess ( for which the franconians are going to beat me ) is that when it comes to beer , bamberg is n't that different from munich . 
  has anyone warned you yet that germans take their beer very serious ? 
  `` indische reise '' only if it 's indians from india , `` indianische reise '' for north-american indians . 
  also , the `` am '' in `` am fest teilnehmen '' is not colloquial ; it 's perfect standard german . 
  oregon-buffalo-fest . 
  * `` oregonisch '' sounds weird , but so does `` oregonian '' . 
  i think it would n't if we were more used to it . 
  and no , that 's a little much . 
  ( it might work in other cases , the length is n't even that problematic . ), 
  25 characters including spaces . 
  dropping the `` oregon '' because it makes things so complicated . 
  [ if it 's required , go with simply adding `` in oregon '' or `` oregons '' . ], 
  `` tour '' can be used in german as well , and often will be used especially in touristy contexts . 
  `` reise '' only really works if the tour includes staying in some indian hotel for a few days ; for a trip from one site to the next , `` fahrt '' would be a better translation ( if you want to avoid `` tour '' to use a real german word ) . 
  `` st\u00e4tten '' is probably the best direct translation for `` sites '' - it makes the reader thing of sanctuaries or graveyards , but it might also include normal villages . 
  the modifying works almost the same way in german ; there just are n't ever any spaces in the middle of the word . 
  hauskatze is house cat , katzenhaus does n't exist but might be like a doghouse for a cat . 
  most common example in which both words make sense : a `` milchkuh '' is a dairy cow , `` kuhmilch '' is simply ( cow 's ) milk . 
  these are just votes , not real people . 
  the pm alone casts all the votes for their land . 
  most l\u00e4nder most of the time are ruled by a coalition of two ( or rarely more ) parties . 
  if the coalition parties in any one land ca n't agree on how to vote on an issue in the bundesrat , the land usually ( 99 % ) abstains , which is effectively a `` no '' . 
  in theory , the pm can always cast the vote as he pleases , even if this might cause the smaller party to leave his coalition . 
  * each land 's government `` can '' assign members . 
  i 'm not sure if they actually do , but they do n't really have to - the pm alone casts all the votes . 
  `` gay '' means `` happy '' . 
  dan dennett suggested calling `` non-brights '' `` supers '' ( because they believe in something supernatural ) - using positive-sounding words for both sides also is what happened with gay/straight . 
  would that make you feel better ? 
  [ i would n't use the word `` bright '' because when you do nobody knows what the hell you 're talking about . 
  but `` physically bitch-slapping '' people who use it seems rather extreme . ], 
  ftfy . 
  here , i think this open letter might be adressed to you . 
   [ ... ] you , and society , need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor . 
  give a man a fire and he 's warm for the day . 
  but set fire to him and he 's warm for the rest of his life . 
  - terry pratchett, 
  what subject exactly ? 
  evolution , or the distinction between `` theory '' and `` fact '' ? 
  the main difference is grammatical :, 
  [ the meaning of these to sentences is roughly the same . ], 
  differences in use ... 
  i ca n't explain this in general , i 'm afraid . 
  one big difference is how you talk about food :, 
  `` ich mag bohnen '' is `` i like ( the taste of ) beans . '', 
  `` bohnen gefallen mir '' sounds weird , more as if you like what beans look like . 
  you 'd could say `` mir gef\u00e4llt der geschmack von bohnen '' , but i 'd rather just stick with `` m\u00f6gen '' . 
  but what when it 's not a vocative ? 
  `` the clown , jerry , was n't laughing any longer . '', 
  [ jerry is the clown , not the person i 'm talking to . ], 
  thanks . 
  i never pictured ggg to be a dad ... 
  hm ... maybe he adopted . 
  i was thinking about writing something similar to that ; i just ca n't really phrase it . 
  if you will , `` gefallen '' is something that happens to your eyes ( or ears ) , `` m\u00f6gen '' is something you do with your heart . 
  you sound like a wonderful person . 
  i 'm so sorry you 'll have to leave your parents and the rest of your family behind , but i 'm sure it will be best for you . 
  you sound like you 've put a lot of thought into this and certainly are n't just acting on a whim . 
  i do n't think luck is only for the weak - you might need some , and i hope very mush that you 'll always have more than you need . 
  have a great new life in america !, 
  ( like other posters , i guess i ca n't help you in any relevant way since germany is a bit far from everywhere . 
  anyway : if there 's a way i could help , please let me know . ), 
  : i guess it goes without saying : i 'd love to hear more from you in a few years . 
  maybe an ama when you 've become an american citizen , or something like that . 
  also - enjoy the support you find here , but do n't forget to be careful not to let anyone even glance at your screen while you do it . 
  sorry you have to be so careful . 
  hope you 'll be safe . 
  does n't apply here .
