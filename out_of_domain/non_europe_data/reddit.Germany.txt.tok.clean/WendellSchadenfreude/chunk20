   if you throw the word islamophobe at somebody , it says a lot more about you than the person it 's directed at . 
  it tells the world that either you are not aware of the origins of this term , or you are willfully playing along with the islamist propaganda . 
   criticizing islam is no more phobic than criticizing any political ideology , such as e.g. 
  nazism or communism . 
  - init100, 
  this is great . 
  i want one like this , if i get a tombstone at all . 
  [ edit : allthough it would be a lie . 
  i do n't live life to the fullest ; i spend far too much time on reddit to claim that . ], 
  and they are christians ? 
  ( maybe that 's just a phase for them - they might yet grow out of it ...  ), 
  i 'm sorry to hear that . 
  did you ever come up with a great reply ? 
  if you tell me what you think is wrong with the argument , i 'd love to help you formulate one . 
  ok , so maybe `` norse '' was a poor choice . 
  ( not sure if you 're trying to fool me here , but it 's not really important if there * actually * still are followers of odin ... ), 
  the point is : my grandchildren might one day come to me and tell me that they think christianity and islam and all these other religions are dangerous . 
  i would like that - clever grandchildren . 
  what i would like * better * is if they came to me and told me they had just learnt that people used to take * religions * serious in my youth , and they would like to hear more about the quaint folk of the 20th century . 
  `` white '' person here , we prefer being called pale-faces . 
  [ native german ], 
  i do n't think i can usually tell the difference , except from context . 
  `` kennedy i * t berliner '' could either mean that kennedy is from berlin , or that he is eating doughnuts ( or that he is a doughnut or eats people from berlin ) . 
  it 's not obvious at all , because `` berliner '' is ambiguous , too . 
  [ these are berliner ] ( http://ais.badische-zeitung.de/piece/02/e3/64/7e/48456830.jpg ) , and [ these are , too ] ( http://blog.rezkonv.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/berliner-pfannkuchen.jpg ) . 
  kleidung instead of klamotten seems old to me . 
  the funniest thing is when foreigners do n't know when to use `` du '' and `` sie '' . 
  people using `` du '' when talking to strangers are funny enough , people using `` sie '' when talking to children or animals are simply hilarious . 
  ah , yes - on the internet , everybody is `` du '' , except for some douchebags in the comment sections of news pages . 
  our rule was : until you have a phd , you 're `` du '' . 
  downvote because hard to read . 
  i do n't . 
  always ask yourself : wwsd ? 
   basically , the fires showed her what she needed to do . 
  first stannis , now jon . 
  you think she 'll be doing jon , too ? 
  that part is short for george r ( r ) martin fanfiction . 
  guns , * germs * , and steel . 
  [ i know , we already covered that . 
  just felt like alluding to diamond 's book . ], 
  `` at the time '' is so broad an expression in this case ... 
  the arquebuses ( pl ? ), 
  the first roanoke colonists used in the late 16th century were much worse than the rifles custer 's men used almost 300 years later ... 
  i do n't know much about historical guns . 
  if you do : would you say a 1600-arquebus is already `` better '' than bows and arrows ? 
  ( why ? ), 
  [ that might backfire .

   but it 's not about `` truth '' with a capital `` t '' , or `` salvation '' with a capital `` s '' . 
   if they do n't know either of these stories , or never considered them , then you need to follow up : `` why is it an atheist knows this stuff but you do not ? 
  it 's not about `` atheists '' with a capital `` a '' either , is it ? 
  why does expanding the apostrophe change the word order ? 
  in english : you do n't exist . 
  it 's simply `` you do n't exist '' . 
  in * a beautiful mind * , there 's a scene where nash is fighting with parcher , telling him that he 's not real . 
  i do n't think he uses this exact expression , though . 
  not sure if that 's really your point , but this seems to come down to : health care is important , thus it should be paid for by taxes . 
  housing and food are ( arguably ) even more important than health care . 
  i think we all agree that these things should * not * be paid for by taxes . 
  also , heavy stuff ( almsot everything ! ), 
  has to be double-bagged in these lousy plastic bags . 
  tomato , tomato . 
   it 's generally pretty unwise, 
  i think we all agree that this is just another way of saying the same thing . 
  * science * demands perfect evidence from science . 
  the flag 's a she ? 
  i do n't think that was ever the correct version of the pledge . 
  i like `` growing up '' better as a metaphore . 
  you were once a child , why are you now an adult ? 
  at what point did that happen ? 
  also : if you `` evolved '' from a child into an adult - why are there still children ? 
  [ of course , the reason is not the same as with monkeys/humans , but the question still makes no sense , so it 's ok . ], 
  do n't open this link !, 
  ( unless you want to . ), 
  it 's a video of man being beheaded with a chainsaw . 
  i used to work in a research group in germany that was about half german , half chinese . 
  chinese are usually said to eat anything , but when we made * mettbr\u00f6tchen * , we did n't get any of them to eat it . 
  one of them took one bite and actually spit it out again , the others just stared at us as if we 'd gone mad . 
  good times ... 
  brilliant . 
  look at the username , folks . 
   we think that roughly 400k died via the nuclear bombs . 
  more like half that many . 
  200k would still be a lot of heads . 
  but knowing that these two numbers are somewhere in the same region is terrifying . 
  do n't be unrealistic . 
  who does n't like genocide ? 
   [ ... ] , you can bet your last dollar that i would n't have given a shit . 
  neither would any rational bastard who understands that they were barely conscious at this age ( let alone able to comprehend anything ; be that pain , joy , warmth , colours ) . 
   the problem that surrounds this topic is that we use our adult understanding of the world to make decisions for a lump of flesh that is totally oblivious to everything around it . 
  every word of that is true for a three-months old baby . 
   we 're not arguing the killing of babies because they have no consciousness , do n't create a ridiculous argument . 
  yes , we are ; that is precisely the thing we 're arguing . 
  platefish said that he is completely ok with an abortion after 8 months of pregnancy * because the fetus is `` barely conscious at this age '' * . 
  unless you believe that a three-months old baby is fundamentally more conscious , i do n't see the difference . 
  ( if you believe this of a three-months old baby , lets talk about a twenty-minutes old baby instead . ), 
  without two 0 's . 
  which begs the question : if there are two 0 's in 100 , why is there still w00ster ? 
  you should read up on that a little ; most of what you say is not true . 
  [ just to give one example : what is that `` old regime '' you are talking about ?
