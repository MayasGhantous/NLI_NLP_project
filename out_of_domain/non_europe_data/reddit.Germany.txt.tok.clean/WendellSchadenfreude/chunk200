  the british pint is about 20 % larger than the american pint , and most of the rest of the world simply has no idea what a `` pint '' is . 
   i guess combining a d5 with a d20 would get you to single digit percentages, 
  or just use 2 d10 in different colors , one for the first digit and one for the second . 
  gives you exact numbers 0-99 . 
  i know many people like for improbably events to happen in rpgs , but a 20-step scale is just too short for my taste . 
  you have extreme results in basically every fight - but since a 1 does n't automatically mean that the hero dies , you also ca n't do really great things just because you rolled a 20 . 
  with 3d20 , two dice showing 20 is already pretty rare , and you can have actually unlikely events happen thus . 
  getting three 20 's on an important roll is something that most players will only ever get once or twice in their life ( 1 in 8,000 rolls ) , and can allow their characters to achieve amazing things . 
  it then also becomes acceptable when your characters suffer actually bad consequences from double - or triple-1 's . 
  i disagree . 
  in a conflict where every side habitually exaggerates the casualties they inflicted on their enemies , showing pictures ( of dressed , non-mutilated bodies ) as proof seems acceptable to me . 
  i do n't get it . 
  ( non-native speaker ), 
  i get that `` draw '' can mean tie or painting , but why would either of that mean that you ca n't link to it ? 
  does it actually say atheism , or could this also be translated to mean something completely different ? 
   whether accidentally or on purpose , life has ` infested ' every corner of our planet , so there should be no reason to stop life artificially at this point . 
  life stopped * naturally * at this point , the question is just whether we should artifically spread it any further . 
  i agree that we should try to colonize mars at some point , and thus obviously spread earth life there . 
  but still , i think that planetary protection makes a lot of sense * for now * . 
  there might be life ( or traces of former life ) on mars , and it would be extremely exciting to find it . 
  spread earth life there or otherwise `` terraforming '' the planet might quickly destroy mars life and all traces of it ever existing , which would be a huge loss scientifically , philosophically and possibly economically . 
  planetary protection on the other hands costs us basically nothing . 
  we ca n't send people to mars yet , we definitely ca n't establish colonies on mars yet , we ca n't terraform mars yet , we ca n't spread life to mars or any other celestial body in any meaningful and controlled way . 
  making sure our rovers and other vessels do n't carry any contaminant life is just common sense for now . 
  you are in fact the one who wants to throw logic out of the window , for no other reason than the sentimental idea that `` life * wants * to spread '' . 
  tl ; dr : planetary protection is not going to last * forever * , but it 's a great idea * for now * . 
  and by that , i mean another few decades at least . 
  i generally do n't see a problem with taking pictures of dead bodies . 
  i 'm not talking about parading them through cities or taking selfies while holding detached heads , but taking pictures that simply show the ( number of ) bodies of dead people does n't de-humanize them or mean that you are giving up your own humanity .

  i was just guessing the gender from the insults that the kids use :, 
   when they 're mad at me , they call me a motherfucker , an asshole , an idiot and a fatass under their breath . 
  female teachers would probably be insulted as a `` bitch '' , but rarely as a `` motherfucker '' . 
  of course , these insults have been translated from spanish to english , so it might not be true anymore .

  dictionaries of course have to contain ( roughly ) the same words with ( roughly ) the same definitions , but they sometimes also have [ fake entries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fictitious_entry#examples ) specifically to catch plagiarists . 
  if your dictionary explains mostly the same words as some other dictionary , that 's just to be expected . 
  but if you explain the word [ `` esquivalience '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_oxford_american_dictionary#fictitious_entry ) , you copied from noad . 
  google used a similar trick to make bing look the fool . 
   google , alleging its search results for a misspelling of tarsorrhaphy started appearing in bing results partway through the summer of 2010 , created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like `` hiybbprqag '' , `` delhipublicschool40 chdjob '' and `` juegosdeben1ogrande '' each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage . 
  nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on bing .

  also , what does any of it even mean ? 
  the lines to ford or mcdonald 's probably mean that somebody in that circle owns controlling shares of those companies . 
  the lines to `` us ambassador to finland '' or `` spanish minister '' probably mean that somebody * is * the ambassador/minister . 
  the lines to the presidential campaigns probably mean that they donated money ? 
  what exactly do the lines to `` national campaign to prevent teen pregnancy '' , `` carol moseley braun for president '' and the `` friends of dick lugar '' mean , and should i really be scared of these ? 
  no , no - he just means that he gave it to her . 
  the turnout is n't necessarily higher among those who agree with her than among those who do n't . 
  if you have 1/3 approval and 2/3 turnout , there 's still a ( mathematical ) chance of you getting exactly 0 votes . 
  turnout is higher in germany than it is in the us mostly because our system is different . 
  even if you know that your area will be carried by party x , a vote for party y is n't wasted .

  because there are so many people who do n't get at all why some people might kill themselves if they were 10 years old again : most of these folks have * children * . 
  if you 're 10 years old again , your children are gone - and not just gone , actually : it 's like they never even existed . 
  that 's why i 'm explaining it . 
  i doubt that most of the people who would kill themselves are the typical 20-25 year old redditors . 
  even if you did n't enjoy your life from 10-20 , going back there with all your knowledge would easily allow you to change it . 
  killing yourself seems like an absurd suggestion when you could instead be a super-smart teenager . 
  the problem arises when you * do n't * want to change anything , because even the smallest change would mean that you completely and forever wiped out the people that you care about the most . 
  i do n't think telling * him * is the right course of action .
