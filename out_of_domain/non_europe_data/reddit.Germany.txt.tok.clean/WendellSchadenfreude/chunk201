  you are misinformed . 
  the bees are doing fine . 
  all of the bees from a few years ago are dead , because bees do n't live that long . 
  but they have been easily replaced by a roughly equal number of new bees . 
  [ take a look at this for instance . 
  ] ( http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-24-1427170938-9300708-chart20150322at5.17.37pm.png ), 
  and all your bees will be dead after the first warm day . 
  worst case scenario : the mites do in fact adapt quickly , and you 're back to square one . 
  more realistic scenario : the mites take years or decades to adapt , and in some regions , they never do . 
  you have solved your problem for the time being , and you 're no worse off after that . 
  i do n't think this idea is nearly as brilliant as they claim it is , but the possibility that mites might adapt is n't the most important problem . 
  we also use other ways to deal with them now , and they * might * adapt to those as well . 
  or they might not , at least not quickly . 
  mites are n't insects , by the way . 
   honey bee population is already starting to recover, 
  `` starting to recover '' is a bit of an understatement , when [ the data show ] ( http://cdn11.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bee-graph.jpg ) that there never was a problem to begin with . 
  `` can * i * be the priest this time ? '', 
  nobody counts individual bees , obviously . 
  bees are n't all that important because they produce honey , but because they pollinate plants ; so the honey production does n't matter much . 
  but if you care about it : [ here you go .

  if you read his post as an inquisitive request for more information , i see your point . 
  i read it as `` omg , why are n't we doing this immediately to all our hives ? '', 
  - and i maintain that the correct reply is : `` calm your tits , buddy . '', 
  the big hysteria only started around 2006 . 
  2.5 in 1996 to 2.5 in 2012 - yeah , it was horrible !, 
  the decline ( decline !, 
  not a sudden drop ) before that was intentional . 
  beehives are managed more efficiently now than they used to be , e.g. 
  loaded on trucks and brought where they are needed . 
  therefore far fewer hives are needed than back in the 80 's . 
  there never was a situation where the number of hives dropped because the beekeepers were unable to maintain the number they wanted . 
  iirc , it was from the same article that the above comment linked to . 
  ca n't be accessed anymore at the moment , reddit hug of death . 
  but just google the number of beehives , in the us or globally or in any region of the world , and you wo n't find a worrying trend over the past 10-20 years anywhere . 
  i like the idea of a replay myself . 
  but i 'd feel horrible , because it would annihilate my little sister . 
  by the way , i call it a `` replay '' because of [ this fantastic book ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.replay ) , which deals with a similar idea . 
  nope .

  thanks . 
  i recommend that you also repost this comment as a direct answer to johnny90 , because it might otherwise get burried when my comment score drops further in the negative . 
  it 's much harder to get reliable data about wild bee colonies , of course . 
  but if it 's any consolation : the number of wild cows is absolutely tiny compared to the number of `` managed '' cows . 
  if you want to combine road with solar panels , you can still put the panels above the road and place the poles behind [ guard rails ] ( http://www.baizlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/guardrail.jpg ) . 
  ( the poles , not the poles ! ), 
  i * am * somewhat worried about bacteria developing antibiotic resistances . 
  there are n't all that many classes of antibiotics , and it would really suck if bacteria evolved that could n't be killed with any of them . 
  however , this only means that we should maybe somewhat restrict the use of antibiotics ; not that we should n't use them at all . 
  people who claim that this idea is bad because the mites could adapt should also say that antibiotics are a bad idea because the bacteria might adapt . 
  electricity , not energy . 
  fossil fuels used in cars were not included . 
  quoting / u/nabber86 , because i think more people should see [ his answer . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4j05zy/probably_the_smartest_solution_ive_seen_to_help/d32paw1 ), 
   people who know nothing about bees see this type of thing and say , `` wtf beekeepers , why are you not doing this ? '' . 
  there seems to be a consensus among the general public that beekeepers do n't know what they are doing and are the ones causing the problems because of their ignorance . 
   there was so much bullshit/catch phrases in that video that i could not finish watching it . 
  the hive burning scene is ridiculous , because you only do that in the rare case of foul brood , yet the supposed purpose of the thermal hive is to get rid of varroa . 
   then you have the cost for something that has n't been proved to work . 
  a single hive ( bottom , top , super , frames , and foundation ) will set you back about $ 150 and that does n't include the cost of the honey supers ; another $ 50 per hive at least . 
  i have 15 hives , so do the math on that . 
  judging by the materials , workmanship , and hardware on the solar hive shown in the vid , i am guessing that they start at about $ 600 each ; wannabe suburban hipsters = target market . 
   ( you 'd be back to square one , but poorer ), 
  on the contrary : you 'd be back to square one , but * richer * , because you got rid of some pests for at least a few years , possibly decades . 
  that 's definitely a much better idea than solar stupid roadways . 
   or , you can build a really sturdy building . 
  people often overestimate how `` sturdy '' such a building would need to be . 
  in hiroshima , there was a public lavatory less than 500 meters ( ~ 520 yards ) away from the hypocenter . 
  it survived the explosion , and is today used once again as a public lavatory . 
  the bomb used in hiroshima was comparably small , of course , but still : a strong concrete building a few hundred meters away from an a-bomb can easily survive the explosion . 
  even if people inside of the building might not . 
  great . 
  so my kids do n't literally stop existing , they still are in some kind of parallel universe that might or might not exist . 
  there 's just no way for me to ever see them again . 
  hooray !, 
  in case you were just asking for an explanation of what the sentence means :, 
  `` i have some reasons for loving you now , and i had some reasons for loving you back then . 
  but they are totally different from each other . 
  ( i loved you back then ) ** for none of the reasons ** ( for which ) ** i love you now . 
   uncommon though ? 
  trees have been turning orange every year for a while though , have n't they ? 
  sure , but there were no europeans around to see it . 
  trees in europe do n't turn nearly as orange in autumn as trees in america , they can usually quite accurately be described as yellow . 
  [ here 's an article about it .

  in snake culture , this is considered a free lunch . 
  in standard german :, 
  in english :, 
  well , let 's see how much english the anglo-saxon speaks when i speak dialect . 
  fucking google translate wo n't help you with that !, 
  zuvor , because you 're talking about the survey prior to this one .
