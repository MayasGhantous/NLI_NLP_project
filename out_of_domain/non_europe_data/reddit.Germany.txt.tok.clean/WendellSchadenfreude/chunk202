  [ german native ], 
  i 'm confused by your answer . 
  the subclause is n't necessarily nonrestrictive in possibility 1 and restrictive in possibility 2 . 
  there could also be several mothers , and only one among them loves the daughter . 
  ( possibility 1 , but restrictive . ), 
  or there could just be a mother that is loved by the daughter , and that 's it . 
  ( possibility 2 , but nonrestrictive . ), 
  she does n't need to be one of several mothers , among whom she is the only one who is loved by the daughter . 
  edit :, 
  this is also still true for your example . 
  this can also mean one of four things :, 
  `` the daughter , who loves the mother , ... '' ( there 's one daughter . 
  she happens to love the mother . ), 
  `` the daughter that loves the mother ... '' ( there are several daughters . 
  one of them loves the mother . ), 
  `` the daughter , whom the mother loves , ... '' ( there 's one daughter . 
  she is loved by the mother . ), 
  `` the daughter that the mother loves ... '' ( there are several daughters . 
  only one of them is loved by the mother . ), 
  ( the commas in english depend on [ whether the clause is restrictive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-restrictive_clause ) , by the way . ), 
  it 's even worse , the sentence can mean one of four things :, 
  `` the mother , who loves the daughter , ... '' ( there 's one mother . 
  she happens to love the daughter . ), 
  `` the mother that loves the daughter ... '' ( there are several mothers . 
  one of them loves the daughter . ), 
  `` the mother , whom the daughter loves , ... '' ( there 's one mother . 
  she is loved by the daughter . ), 
  `` the mother that the daughter loves ... '' ( there are several mothers . 
  only one of them is loved by the daughter . ), 
  [ hooray : in english , you can tell whether the subclause is restrictive or [ non-restrictive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-restrictive_clause ) !, 
  in german , you ca n't . ], 
  but it would usually be clear from context which meaning you were going for . 
  i do n't think i 've ever consciously rephrased a sentence to avoid this problem ; and if i would , it would probably just be because i dislike the double - `` die '' , not to avoid the ambiguity .

   1 australian dollar equals 0.73 us dollar, 
  i somewhat disagree with the previous posters . 
  i would definitely mark your first translation as a word order mistake , even though it might not be technically wrong in some specific cases . 
  [ i think this website has pretty good explanations . 
  ] ( https://www.lsa.umich.edu/german/hmr/grammatik/wortstellung/nicht.html ) in your example , `` nicht '' goes right before `` finden '' simply because `` finden '' is the word that is being negated . 
    wherefore art thou romeo ? 
   of course that should be `` where are you romeo ? '', 
  right ? 
  i still do n't understand how people even arrive at this conclusion . 
  `` therefore '' does n't simply mean `` there '' , it means `` thus '' . 
  `` wherefore '' is the question to which `` therefore '' is the answer . 
  i do n't even know what you 're trying to say about the question at hand . 
  in case you 're not aware : you sound quite condescending . 
  telling someone who is learning a foreign language ( and , like op , is specifically asking for a `` hard and fast rule '' ! ), 
  that `` there 's no such thing as ` rules ' '' is certainly not very helpful . 
  so what would your actual answer to op 's question be ? 
  if it sounds so odd that you feel the need to change it yourself , why burden people who are just learning the language with the information that it * might * be an alternative under some circumstances ? 
  even when adding `` einfach '' ( which is one of those [ modal particles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_modal_particle ) that are very hard for foreigners to use ) , you would say `` ich konnte meine kreditkarte einfach nicht finden '' 90 % of the time . 
  ~ ~ `` ich konnte nicht meine kreditkarte finden '' ~ ~ is a variant that germans would use very rarely and under specific circumstances ; but much more commonly , it is a giveaway that the speaker is a foreigner .

  normally , you need to file your taxes until the end of may .

  i * think * that your best course of action would be to join the lohnsteuerhilfering . 
  they are officially a club ( which sounds a bit weird ) , but the only purpose of the club is to help its members with their steuererkl\u00e4rung . 
  should be cheaper than a steuerberater , and still grants the automatic deadline extension . 
  as far as i know , they are n't much worse than a professional steuerberater , so hiring one is only worth it if your case is really complicated . 
  true , but op said that he has `` a bit of extra income '' , which probably means more than 410 $ per year - in that case , he has to file a tax return .

   arriving at the cape of the eleven thousand virgins, 
  the what now ? 
  ... no wonder they lingered for a bit . 
  [ ok , the [ actual explanation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cape_virgenes ) is completely un-sexy . 
  it 's named for a story of 11,000 virgins who were supposedly martyred in an event that the vatican considers [ `` entirely fabulous '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_ursula ) . ], 
  i was refering to this part :, 
   a commemoration of saint ursula and her companions in the mass of saint hilarion formerly in the general roman calendar on october 21 was removed in 1969 , because '' ** their passio is entirely fabulous ** : nothing , not even their names , is known about the virgin saints who were killed at cologne at some uncertain time '' . 
  in any case : there obviously never was an event when eleven * thousand * christian virgins were all killed at any point in the early middle ages . 
  i love the explanations in the article for how the word `` thousand '' may accidentally have been added to the story due to some misunderstanding . 
  how they arrived at this is so funny . 
  '' ` venerean ? ' '', 
  `` nah , that sounds like [ ` venereal ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexually_transmitted_infection ) .

  `` yes , she 's aphrodite . 
  so that would be ` aphrodisial ' . '', 
  `` dammit , that just sounds like [ ` aphrodisiac ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphrodisiac ) . 
  ca n't use that either . '', 
  they went with [ `` cytherean '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cytherean ) because aphrodite , according to greek mythology , was born ( emerged from the sea , to be more precise ) near the island of cythera . 
  in the books , i 'm sure they will find rhaegar 's silver harp in the tombs .
