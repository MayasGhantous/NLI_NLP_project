  i do n't want to sound like a fifteen year-old fanboy , but if you ever want to directly send money to him , the best way to go would be bitcoin . 
  dude , calm down . 
  they are not my party , i 'm not even american . 
  blacks are people , guns are not . 
  - i hope you have a better comparison than that . 
  the amendment you are quoting contains not only the phrase `` shall not be infringed '' , but also the phrase `` well-regulated '' . 
  in short , the stance that republicans take against abortion is * far * more extreme than the stance that democrats take in relation to firearms . 
  ( i wo n't even say `` against firearms '' , because they are * not * against firearms . ), 
  if these are the only two issues that op cares about , he should vote democrat . 
  and i do n't just recommend that to everybody . 
  having the right to bear arms does n't mean the right to bear any kind of gun in any place at any time under any circumstance . 
  the question is : is the democratic party against firearms to the same or a similar extent to which the republican party is against abortions ? 
  and the answer clearly is : no , not at all . 
  what matters is : they are against some specific forms of firearms . 
  but they clearly recognize the right of people to own a glock or something for self-defense . 
  if you think that people should be allowed to own guns , except in some extreme cases , you 're in line with the democratic party . 
  if you think that people should be allowed to have abortions , except in some extreme cases , you 're also in line with the democratic party . 
  and no , i 'm not a democrat and i do n't just recommend the democratic party to everyone . 
  but if op only cares about these two things , complaining about his choice of parties is silly , because there clearly * is * a party for him . 
  i do n't care much about cosmetic features . 
  does n't matter much whether they are banned or not . 
  the point is that the democrats recognize and support the right of people to own guns , except in some cases which they deem extreme . 
  you ca n't really say that the republicans recognize and support the right of people to have abortions , except in some cases which they deem extreme . 
  they are against abortions on principle , and at most willing to grant some few exceptions . 
  the democrats are n't for everyone ; but if op only cares about these two things , they clearly are for him . 
   it does n't ? 
  it does n't . 
  ask the surpreme court . 
   [ like most rights , the second amendment right is not unlimited . 
  ] ( http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/554/570.html#sthash.vyz4uwpm.dpuf ) it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose . 
  out of curiosity , do you think i should have the right to own tanks and grenade throwers ? 
  thanks for the info . 
  how about intercontinental rockets and nuclear warheads ? 
  i 'm not saying `` no one '' wants to take your guns , i 'm saying * the democrats * do n't . 
  at least not to nearly the same extent that the republicans want to `` take your abortions '' . 
  i * am * comparing things that are n't very similar : the democrats ' view on guns with the republican view on abortions . 
  the comparison works very well , and shows that the latter view is more extreme by far . 
  but that does n't mean that naming just any two things is a good comparison . 
  * people * have rights . 
  blacks are people , guns are not , and that makes your entire comparison pointless . 
  but i do n't think further discussion is useful . 
  you calling me a `` nutjob '' shows that you do n't even realize that i 'm not discussing my own views at all , i 'm discussing the democrats ' views , as stated in their most recent platform . 
  panel 1 is about normal rainbows . 
  panel 2 is about `` double '' rainbows , which is * every * rainbow as long as conditions are good . 
  [ see this picture , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg ) in the top left and right corners . 
  panel 3 is probably about [ halos , see wikipedia .

  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/halo_in_the_himalayas.jpg ), 
  panel 4 , my best guess would be [ `` sun-dogs '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sun_dogs ) , see [ this picture . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/fargo_sundogs_2_18_09.jpg ), 
  the phenomena of course are n't usually visible at the same time . 
  i wonder if it 's theoretically possible at all . 
  i think it 's sun dogs because the character starts saying `` on either side of [ the sun ] '' . 
  sun dogs always come in pairs , one on either side of the sun . 
  depends on [ how you hold the chopsticks . 
  i sometimes `` spring '' , and sometimes i `` fall '' . 
  can i be rich , too ? 
  there 's being too poor to pay for something even though it 's worth it , and then there 's being stupid . 
  you 're being stupid . 
  stop being stupid !, 
  you say you have a salary , which i assume to be at least $ 600 per month . 
  if you could double that for $ 1,200 , you 'd break even after only two months . 
  money does n't appear from nowhere , you get it from the bank . 
  if you have a salary , then yes , you can get a loan . 
  if your numbers are correct , it would even be worth it to just get a credit card and pay the $ 1,200 that way - that would already be stupid because you 'd pay far more interest than necessary , but it would be much smarter than * not * paying these 1,200 and losing out on * an entire extra salary * every month . 
  call you bank * today * !, 
  double your income , and then buy me some gold !, 
  that looks pretty bad . 
  saying that the airbase was `` destroyed '' still sounds like hyperbole to me . 
  according to the [ wikipedia list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_syrian_air_force_bases ) , tiyas has 60 hardened aircraft shelters . 
  losing the helicopters sucks , but most of the aircraft , and the base itself , should still be useable . 
  we 're all thinking it , but you still ca n't post stuff like that in this subreddit . 
  stay civil !, 
  this subreddit is best when supporters of all different groups can speak their mind , even supporters of isis or other people who 's beliefs you deem absurd . 
  thank you for contributing . 
  i think you 're wrong about everything you just said , but please do n't be discouraged from sharing your opinions on this subreddit . 
   why is that strange ? 
  * because * we all know that it 's nonsense . 
  hillary saying that women are the primary victims of war was increadibly dumb . 
  but this article says exactly the same thing :, 
   but with all the talk of democracy and her one human rights speech in 1996 , the main victims of the secretary 's interventions have been the human rights of human beings , those denied their liberty and forced to endure the abuses that are inevitably unleashed in ** war -- and its main victims , women and children . 
  it 's not surprising that hillary said something like this ; but it is strange that journalists would simply adobt such an absurd claim . 
  if that part of the article is meant to be simply quoting hillary , they should make that a lot clearer . 
  for those who 've never seen it : here [ snopes ] on clinton 's claim . 
  go ahead and delete it then !, 
  otherwise the mods will delete it anyway , and might warn you for it .
