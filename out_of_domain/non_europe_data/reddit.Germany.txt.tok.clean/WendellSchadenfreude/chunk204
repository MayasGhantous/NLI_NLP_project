  do you think sunnis and shias should live together in peace ? 
  oops . 
  yeah , that 's the link that was supposed to be there . 
  you know what 's going to happen to him ? 
  the night king will resurrect him , of course , because an un-direwolf is an awesome pet . 
  but he 'll also give him a new name : winter . 
  when the white walkers storm the wall , the last thing that dolorous edd will hear before his throat is ripped out will be panicked voices giving the stark words a new meaning : '' * winter * is coming ! '', 
  planet obvious . 
  if you have a regular salary , you can get a loan . 
  if a small loan ( $ 1,200 ) can double your income , you should take that loan . 
  this is just common sense . 
  do n't pretend i 'm donald trump suggesting that you should just get `` a small loan of a million dollars '' . 
  there are people in this world who would only need $ 1,200 to vastly improve their lives but ca n't get that much money - but if you have a regular income , certifiable skills , good command of the english language , and access to a computer , you are not among these people . 
  fun plan , but you will need some way to practise german , or you certainly wo n't be able to just speak it all of a sudden . 
  the first time you speak german wo n't sound anything like real german , you will need a while ( and somebody who can correct your mistakes ) to get the sounds right . 
  still : keep it up !, 
  learning languages is great . 
  did you realize that while watching [ dara o'briain ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z0gs9gb.jpg ) if not , you should go watch him now , he 's amazing . 
   hearth and harvest and we yield up to you , my lord . 
  you somehow managed to drop the `` heart '' that should come between hearth and harvest . 
  how did he end that email ? 
  mfg [ firstname ] - go with `` du '', 
  mfg [ firstname ] [ lastname ] or anything else - go with `` sie '', 
  and just to make it clear that the coincidence is n't all that unlikely : if our week only had 6 days , then 10 !, 
  seconds would be exactly 7 weeks instead , and it would still look faszinating . 
  and there would be other fun coincidences for different numbers of hours per day or minutes per hour . 
  and you , with the only sentence you wrote , did nothing but show the pretentious arrogance of a stereotypical german . 
  well done , my dear countryman !, 
  you start your post with an extremely condescending `` oh dear '' and go on talking about `` typical ignorance '' of americans , because we sophisticated europeans of course know much more about the world than those barbarians ever could . 
  and for what ? 
  the simple statement that there is no longer a threat of global socialism , i.e. 
  that the cold war is over . 
  the stereotypical german is seen as an annoying know-it-all in many countries . 
  just look at me , and you 'll know why they think that . 
  then look at yourself , and you 'll see that you started it . 
  besides , your comment is n't even a real sentence . 
  ( americans would be perceived as ignorance ? ), 
  well , yeah - but that 's also a totally boring answer . 
  it 's like saying that jekyll/hyde is n't completely sane - of course he 's not , that 's the premise of the character . 
  captain reynolds is a much more interesting character , because he 's seen as a near flawless hero by many , but if you take a closer look , you really ca n't deny that the man needs therapy . 
  from your post and your replies in this thread , i get the feeling that this is probably just bad luck . 
  some standard advice to foreigners in interviews is to shake hands a little harder and look the interviewer in the eye a bit more than you 're used to , but this really should n't be the make-or-break difference . 
  other than that , you 'll just need to keep at it . 
  the job market in berlin is tough , and i imagine the companies can chose from a large number of applicants . 
  as others have said : it 's a good sign that you are getting so many interviews . 
  since this is n't obvious : `` parfum '' should be pronounced french , with a nasal - um . 
  4 ) someone who shares your lack of belief in any gods , but does n't share all of your values . 
  grow up . 
  politics are complicated , and not everyone on the other side is evil or stupid . 
  the headstone behind that one though : `` infant '' :(, 
  that 's already figured in - he 's no comparing the value of his bitcoin to 2014 dollars , but to ( comparably slightly inflated ) 2016 dollars . 
  [ mfw i could n't figure out what this watch is about . 
  ] ( http://media05.myheimat.de/2012/04/02/2038699_web.jpg?1333389732 ), 
   is it because women innately love children , or is it because we put toy prams and plastic babies in their hands before they can even speak themselves ? 
  does it matter ? 
  when i make a choice , does it really matter whether i made that choice because of my genes , or because of events that happened in my earliest childhood ? 
  sure , this is philosophically fascinating ( nature vs nurture ) , but i do n't see how it should affect the debate about gender equality in adults . 
  because many people found it interesting . 
  that 's how reddit works . 
  the questions come down to : should we take kids from their parents and raise them all the same way ? 
  if you do n't do that , parents in our culture * do * raise girls and boys differently , and that results in different preferences , choices , abilities , and opportunities . 
  you ca n't change that if you let parents raise their kids . 
  and just to be clear : * i * do n't want to take kids from their parents . 
  i just think that your idea of `` equality '' is dangerous . 
  i care about equality of opportunity - for people who bring the same stuff to the table . 
  people who were brought up differently ca n't have the same opportunities unless you discriminate against those whose upbringing was more fitting for the matter at hand . 
   saying nice words everyone can agree with, 
  i think that 's the point : he usually says nice words that everyone ( except china ) can agree with . 
  the supposedly '' * nice * '' thing to say in this case is that we should help all the refugees , and only the usual baddies complain that it 's too much already . 
  yet here we have the dalai lama , who is basically the nicest person on the planet , saying the same thing . 
  most likely because this was before cellphones . 
  [ ho-ly shit .

  op made this post last year on / relationships . 
  things are ** much ** worse than they look in this thread . 
  - they are 19 . 
  - the girl was his first kiss . 
  - he was her 9th sexual partner , by her count . 
  - she cheated on him . 
  - the biological father already has another kid by another woman that he also left . 
  - he 's also a violent criminal . 
  - quote op : `` hate her with extreme passion but still love her . '', 
  honestly , op 's girl is such an enormous living , cheating red flag that i feel this must be an elaborate troll . 
  op , i wish you all the luck in the world . 
  but do n't get mad if people tell you to * run * as fast and far as you can - it 's what every sane person would tell you to do . 
  edit : [ different post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/4jgkf9/buying_my_own_house_soon_and_making_a_list_of_all/ ) : op is also buying his own house soon . 
  i guess that mostly makes it better , but it somehow also makes it worse . 
   why are people upvoting op ? 
  this is just a bad idea . . 
  but it 's a fun thread . 
  in a morbid sort of way . 
  [ who 's on the other end ? 
  fun fact : [ 9001 is a prime number . 
  what bothers me about this : people learn that a `` vomitorium '' was not a place to vomit and conclude that the romans did n't intentionally vomit after/during meals - but these are two separate questions . 
  we know for a fact that the * vomitoria * were not places to vomit , but it 's unclear whether intentional vomiting happened . 
  it certainly did n't happen everwhere during all their history ( rome existed for a * long * time ) , but there seem to have been times when it was considered acceptable among the aristocracy to vomit so that you could eat more . 
  the wikipedia page cites four sources for this , [ all of them labeled `` unreliable source ? '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_roman_cuisine#table_culture ), 
  the most famous source for this is a story about an assassination attempt on caesar , told by cicero .
