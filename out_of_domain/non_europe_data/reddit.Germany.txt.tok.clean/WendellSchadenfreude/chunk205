  he just states matter-of-factly that caesar decided on a whim to go vomit in the bedroom after dinner , instead of in the bathroom where the assassins were waiting for him . 
  there is no explanation as to why caesar would go vomit at all - it might have been a one time thing simply because he was feeling ill , but the text makes it sound like this was simply the normal thing to do : after dinner , go to the bathroom and vomit . 
  or maybe midgets ?

  [ here 's the scene , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t698xdx4fem&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=79 ) this is the correct got quote to answer with . 
  thalidomide was prescribed to pregnant women because it was believed to be a safe a reliable [ drug to treat morning sickness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thalidomide ) , not as part of some twisted experiment . 
  this is not part of the crusader kings or any dlc or mod that i 've ever heard of . 
  your game must be haunted . 
  seriously though , do not try to find out more about this online , it will be much more fun to find out for yourself . 
  sorry , i do n't . 
  the funniest part of that :, 
   soon as i patents my one invention , it 's going to change the world . 
  no , you fool . 
  soon as you patent your own invention , i - working as an intake clerk at the patent office - am going to steal it , pass it off as my own and become rich and famous . 
  after all , that 's what einstein did , is n't it ? 
  i hate how that quote is always capitalized to make him look like an idiot . 
  `` i do n't look at twitter because it does n't tell me anything . '',

  from what i hear , sanders understands realpolitik just fine and is actually [ pretty good at getting things done ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/ ) in a divided congress . 
   at a rally in turkey , erdo\u011fan described mps who backed the armenia motion as `` the long arm of the separatist terrorists in [ turkey ] '' , in remarks broadcast on state television . 
  that 's not the same thing as calling them terrorists . 
  erdogan clearly says enough idiotic things , we should n't make stuff like this up about him . 
   `` there 's trouble in the gypsy village '' in german, 
  greek , not german . 
  the equivalent word to `` gypsy '' in german is not related : `` zigeuner '' . 
   my kids will have methane-filled birthday balloons . 
  is n't that dangerous ? 
  better than hydrogen , sure , but would methane be safe enough for a kids ' birthday party ? 
  german redditors - do we have anything comparable ? 
  - ei - and - ie - sound very different in german . 
  ( - ei - is * ay * as in [ * ay caramba * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzqf-3uhag ) , - ie - is * ee * ), 
  this is actually why the number is pronounced `` niner '' in the [ nato phonetic alphabet . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_phonetic_alphabet#pronunciation ), 
  just saying `` nine '' would have been too confusing for the germans . 
  hello david !, 
  ** what 's your favorite scientific conference to attend ? 
  i 'm a young scientist myself and have attended a few conferences . 
  i always found them immensely motivating , even though i rarely learned anything that was directly relevant to my research - is your own experience similar ? 
  the 4 languages he speaks are icelandic , faroese , danish and english . 
  his entire argument seems to be : if there was a mass-killing of turks by armenians , then the mass-killing of armenians by turks ca n't have been a genocide . 
  what a crappy argument . 
  i think we should talk about turkish victims in world war i and the following conflicts in anatolia , just as we do talk about german victims in/after wwii . 
  but talking about turkish victims with turks who claim that * their * ancestors did nothing wrong is like talking about german victims with neo-nazis who deny german war crimes . 
  roughly : `` dude , go fuck yourself . '', 
  seehofer is a well-known conservative bavarian politician . 
   there 's no way she 'd have taken the risk . 
  correct , people would never fuck around with someone they 're not supposed to . 
  you 're new to this planet , right ? 
  want me to give you a tour ? 
  i 'm gon na tell my people to add it to mine as well . 
  * frau * is `` woman '' in german . 
  * frauenrechte sind menschenrechte * is `` women 's rights are human rights . '', 
  * erste frau * means `` first woman '' , or possibly `` first lady '' . 
  * starke frau * means `` strong woman '' . 
   and the storage of those are n't long term solutions either . 
  yes , they are . 
  the word `` permanent '' should have been a hint . 
  water gets in , and the world ends ? 
  there 's about [ 1 mg/kg of uranium in natural soil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uranium_in_the_environment#natural_occurrence ) anyway ( sometimes more , sometimes less ) . 
  you know how much uranium that makes in a 500x500x500m block of rock ? 
  assuming a density of 2 ( rock being ~ 2 times as heavy as water ) , it would be 500mx500mx500m x 2kg/l x 1,000 l/m \u00b3 x 1 mg/kg = ** 250,000 kg uranium ** . 
  even if water got * in * , got in contact with the uranium waste , and then got * out * again - it would n't even matter . 
  there 's vastly more uranium in the surrounding rock than there ever was in that mine . 
  as others have said , i 'm afraid you ca n't do much against this . 
  recovering some of your losses via airbnb sounds like a good plan . 
  as you say , there 's little leverage that they have to stop you from doing it .

  ad 2 : [ article ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/08/100831-can-nuclear-waste-spark-an-energy-solution/ ) about possible use of `` nuclear waste '' as a source of energy . 
  ad 3 : common sense . 
  twice the waste is * not * twice the problem , and there will definitely already be some nuclear waste . 
  ad 4 : [ pdf about the underground waste disposal site at herfa-neurode ] ( http://www.grs.de/sites/default/files/pdf/05_practical_implementation_of_unterground_disposal_kus.pdf ) , the largest facility of this kind in the world . 
  stores mercury and cyanides , among other things . 
  all of the problems are purely psychological in nature . 
  if you care about problems that might arise in 50,000 years more than you care about the present , you are not part of a rational debate . 
  just because you know what happened 50,000 years ago does n't mean you have the slightest idea of what the world will be like * in * 50,000 years . 
  the technology that even just our great-great-grandchildren will have is totally unimaginable to us . 
  if we store `` nuclear waste '' safely for ~ 200 years , we have done our duty . 
   we do have a decent idea of how things will be in 50,000 years geologically due to the time span of the earth 's processes , just because you do n't have the training yourself does n't mean that the understanding is not there . 
  i 'm not talking about geology , i 'm talking about * technology * , mostly . 
  technology in just 200 years will be incomprehensible to us . 
  thinking that we somehow have to help out humans in 50,000 years is beyond silly . 
  given that air is mostly nitrogen , do ballons filled with pure nitrogen actually float nicely ? 
  you can be very much against something , be a complete bigot about something , without condoning violence against that `` something '' . 
  i do n't like asparagus , and i think people who like asparagus are smelly idiots . 
  but if some fanatic were to kill dozens of asparagians , i 'd side with the victims against that fucking murderer . 
  that may be true , but it does n't really matter . 
  the question is not if most of these people would * not * have joined the islamists if there had been western support , it 's if most of them would actively have * stopped * them . 
  there is very little evidence to make me think so . 
  much worse . 
  in iraq , at least there * was * an invasion , with tens of thousands of american soldiers trying to keep the peace . 
  in syria , nobody wanted to invade , the west just wanted to let the fsa topple assad . 
  after that , the country would have been post-invasion iraq without the americans .
