  murderous , bloody anarchy , that is . 
   you would n't be so mad about the asparagus ' death once they refused to change, 
  you say that , but it 's not true . 
  i do n't condone murder ; not even against disgusting , smelly , slime-eaters . 
  i guess that 's how most anti-lgbt people feel about this massacre . 
  for those who do n't get it :, 
  '' ... aufgrund ** i ** hres hohen alters '' would be `` because of * her * old age '' - this is what they meant to say : the leopard died because she was old . 
  '' ... aufgrund ** i ** hres hohen alters '' means `` because of * your * old age '' ( with a polite `` you '' ) - so the leopard died because the visitors were too old . 
   what are you going to build that technology out of ? 
  i 'm not claiming that * i * know . 
  200 years from now will be pure science fiction . 
  `` all life '' would n't even be affected if we did n't bury our nuclear waste , but simply left it out in the open . 
  it would stil be a * local * problem , not one that affects all earth . 
  [ it 's a forest . 
   i do n't know a single person who supports isis or theocracies for that matter . 
  he 's talking about iran . 
  [ sanctions against iran were lifted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanctions_against_iran ) ( after some 30 years ) in january , which [ ted cruz ( along with others ) ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-deal-will-facilitate-and-accelerate-/ ) has often and loudly protested against . 
  in ted cruz ' mind , lifting these sanctions is the same as `` supporting iran '' . 
  to answer the immediate follow-up question : some people still buy it , because it keeps your money safe , and you ca n't store billions of euros under your mattress . 
  german bonds are still a convenient way of safely storing large amounts of money at a very low cost . 
  as a german , i would support this . 
  but there 's no way it is true . 
  edit : maybe i should elaborate a bit . 
  i would support it if our parliament decided to allow the government to send soldiers to support the sdf . 
  but without the parliament 's permission , the german government ca n't send soldiers anywhere - not even just a few `` special forces '' . 
  there are some exceptions ( for urgent circumstances ) , but `` we just like the kurds so much '' certainly is n't one of them . 
  sure . 
  which country would you choose , [ switzerland ? 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/35ddc68e-dde7-11e4-8d14-00144feab7de.html#axzz4byid6u9x ), 
  of course , if you buy bonds from outside the euro zone ( as a european investor ) , you always have some risk because of the currency exchange . 
  if you want to avoid that , you 're basically stuck with austria , finland or the netherlands . 
   but the entire turner family has shown no remorse for what happened, 
  his family 's statements do n't matter , only his own . 
  if you read ( and believe ) [ his letter ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/brock-turner-statement-stanford-rape-case-campus-culture ) , it 's clear that he feels remorse and never wants to do anything similar again . 
  he could take even more responsibility by blaming * himself * instead of alcohol and `` party culture '' , but i can understand how you come to the conclusion that he is unlikely to break the law ( in a similar way ) again . 
  fine . 
  but where 's my jetpack ? 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1623/ ), 
  how about two of your clones marrying ? 
  they are the same length no matter what you do to your clock . 
  for most people , the problem is not dst . 
  it 's changing the clock twice a year . 
  yes . 
  changing the clock causes all kinds of problems for absolutely no reason . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure . 
  you love getting up early and pretending that it 's already late so that you can go to bed early and pretend that this means the sun is still shining late in the evening . 
  or the opposite ? 
  either way , it sounds like a hoot . 
  i know damn well that only crazy people would demand that our entire society should go through a crazy procedure twice a year just so they can attach different arbitrary numbers to the things they are doing . 
  absolutely doable . 
  take exploration as first or second idea group , expand to the sea early on , proceed as usual . 
  if by `` known '' you mean `` known to the general public '' : none of them stand out much . 
  differences between german universities are n't generally that big , there is no `` ivy league '' . 
  i quickly googled this [ top ten ] ( http://www.meineuni.de/top/lehre/sprachen/linguistik/ ) list , and it sounds about right : i think i 've heard vaguely good things about all of these universities . 
  for anything beyond that , i think you 'd have to look at individual professors more than universities . 
  as the others said : no , you have no reason to worry . 
  hardly anybody in germany is opposed to university educated , english-speaking and german-learning foreigners from first world countries coming here to work . 
  since you mentioned what * you * look like , but not your gf : looking `` middle-eastern '' / arab would probably be worst in germany . 
  still not actually a problem , but would probably draw the most unfriendly stares or angry mutters . 
  yes , this is legal . 
  i wholeheartedly agree that it * is * gender discrimination and should n't be legal , but it is pretty much standard for all university jobs . 
  do n't worry about it too much : they will have very few female applications , and they will hire who they want anyway . 
   the argument is that men enjoy a systemic preference just for being male , so hiring preferences like that are an attempt to ` level the playing field ' . 
   it 's a pretty common thing across the western world , especially in public sector stuff . 
  great answer , thank you for contributing . 
   is this really news to you or are you one of those `` mens rights activists '' trying to troll us ? 
  you could n't possibly be more of an ass . 
   the opposition takes a bit more of a dismissive passive aggression . 
  this is the german default attitude . 
  can someone please just put all four of them in the same graph ? 
  ( i 'm at work , or else i would do it myself . ), 
   do you she will be okay in germany ? 
  yes , she will be much safer in germany than she would be anywhere in mexiko . 
  ( and i 'm not even thinking about the clich\u00e9 nothing-but-gangs version of mexiko , but purely about statistics . ), 
  even if people mistake her for a refugees - it 's not actually common for refugees in germany to be mistreated or harassed . 
  if she stays for several months , i would guess that she will during that time get a few unfriendly stares and might hear someone mutter stuff like `` go back to your own country '' once or twice - but she 'll be safe even then . 
   the issue that both hallis and the blackfish face is , as you say , the neck and moat cailin . 
  at least for hallis , i do n't think that 's a problem . 
  all he needs to do is contact the crannogmen ( i.e. 
  yell `` crannogmen !, 
  where are you ? '', 
  while wandering the neck ) , and they 'll be happy to smuggle him through the swamps and into the north . 
  this is probably also true for the blackfish , but definitely for the man who is escorting ned stark 's bones back home . 
   `` that 's not possible . 
  this would have to have started growing before the world was even created . '', 
  damn . 
  he got * so * close to actually learning something . 
  [ for those who do n't know what kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 means . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) it 's a tragic story , really . 
  that 's hilarious . 
   that just is n't possible : unless there is a giant outside source of energy supplying the earth with huge amounts of energy . 
  if there were such a source , scientists would certainly know about it . 
  [ picture of pittsburgh . 
  ] ( http://www.densho.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/5810703610_d91b240008_b.jpg ) not a bad comparison . 
  [ website with more pictures . 
  ] ( http://pittsburghskyline.com/content/2015/08/18/downtown-pittsburgh-aerials-summer-2015/ ), 
  oh - so this [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1391/ ) was probably inspired by that . 
   and apparently there is also the hilarious phrase `` daher der name bratkartoffel ! '', 
  which i am really sure no living being has ever used . 
  until now !,
