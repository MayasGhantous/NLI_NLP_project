  that phrase is awesome , and i will start using it !,

   citation fucking needed , or do you not need oxygen to live ? 
  climate change of the level that is usually discussed would n't deprive us of oxygen . 
  i think in the books he 's the only giant that went over to the night 's watch , but not literally the last of the giants . 
  what 's with the armenian flag ? 
   i do n't know if assad can afford another year of this endless conflict . 
  i think he 's counting on the war in iraq ending within the next year , after which at least some of the shi'a militias might move on to syria . 
  this guy is absolutely right , by the way . 
  a country ca n't have both a king and a president at the same time . 
  the spanish `` president '' is not the `` president of spain '' , but confusingly called [ `` president of the government '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_spain ) , or more commonly simply `` prime minister '' in english . 
  in germany , your ( former ) employer has to give you a reference that describes your performance `` benevolently '' . 
  even if you were an absolute screw-up , they * have * to say nice things about you , which leads to some hilarious phrases and codes . 
  `` always tried to be on time '' of course means that you were regularly late ; but praising somebody for always being punctual is * still * bad , because that 's something that is simply * expected * from an employee , so praising it probably means that there 's nothing else worthy of praise . 
  stuff like `` very sociable '' often hints at a drinking problem . 
  saying that somebody was `` well liked by their colleagues '' means they were insubordinate - because it * should * be `` by their collegaues and supervisors . '', 
  if you actually want to recommend an emplyoee , the praise has to be over-the-top . 
  `` completed his assignments to our complete satisfaction '' would still only be mediocre , because it could be `` always completed every task to our most utter satisfaction '' . 
  why would they stop at the border ? 
  they are fighting isis now , and many of them will want to keep fighting isis when all of iraq has been retaken . 
  sure , some of them might be motivated mostly by iraqi nationalism , but i do n't think that 's true for the majority of them . 
  most of them have families in southern iraq and do n't need to fight in fallujah or mossul either just to keep their families in basra safe . 
  and having an allied shi'a regime firmly in power in syria would certainly be in their interest , too . 
  they have lived there since long before `` turkey '' was even a thing , and have no obligation to ever `` integrate '' . 
  in germany , the same is true e.g. 
  for [ sorbs ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorben#rechte_der_sorben_in_deutschland ) and [ danes ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a4nische_minderheit_in_deutschland#status ) . 
  ( small minorities , sure , but that 's only because we lost two wars and a lot of land where more minorities might otherwise live . ),

  i 'm honestly asking , i 've never seen window bars like these . 
  they still look like it would be possible to open them from the outside , only complicated . 
   elephant missiles, 
  never heard that name before , so here 's a link for anyone else who has n't . 
  i 'm only in my 30s , and i only have a very vague idea of what minecraft is . 
  some augmented version of tetris or something . 
  my parents certainly know less about this than i do , so you absolutely * can * be that much out of the loop . 
   the military saw you coming mate, 
  `` warning - explosive is poisonous if eaten '' - they saw me coming as well . 
  `` do not burn - produces toxic gases '' - and some other idiot as well . 
  i 'm actually impressed . 
  now what else could i do wrong with that thing ? 
  what happens if i shoot it ? 
  well , close enough .

  my father has been a few times ; not sure if he ever got an account . 
  and there are lots of people on reddit who are 10 or 20 years older than i am . 
  i 'm quite certain the opposite is true . 
  germans became more environmentally conscious , and that made enough of them vote for the greens to make that party successful . 
  if it were as you describe it , you 'd expect far more opposition from other parties and their voters , because the environmental stuff are `` ideas of the greens '' - but they are hardly ever divisive in germany . 
  compared to japan : no . 
  compared to most other countries : yes . 
  you wo n't see much trash in the streets or stuff like that . 
  lazyness in not the opposite of efficiency . 
  i try to be very efficient , so that i have more time to be lazy . 
  good idea about [ the herring . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickled_herring ), 
  no , and i 'm really surprised that this seems to common , judging from the other answers . 
  not nearly as big a thing as most foreigners seem to believe . 
  bigger in the east , but overall a niche phenomenon . 
  i do n't think she seems bad . 
  she 's not * great * , overall a bit dull , but could be far worse . 
  life of the others . 
  the really long ones are only used in laws or as jokes . 
  most compound words are just normal , everyday words , and it 's weird that they * are n't * spelled like that in english . 
  a water bottle is one thing , not two , so it 's `` wasserflasche '' in german . 
  some words like steuererkl\u00e4rung , haftpflichtversicherung , lebensmittelvergiftung probably look scary long to foreigners , but are processed effortlessly if you speak german well enough . 
  a huge ( 90 % + ) majority of germans welcomes immigration . 
  there is mostly dissent over whether there should be an upper limit to the number of immigrants per year . 
   do you know anybody from bielefeld ? 
  yes . 
  she 's nice , and as you can guess , she 's sooo sick of that joke . 
  if you ever meet anyone from bielefeld , do n't bring it up . 
  it 's like asking a tall person what the air up there is like . 
  i 'm not even sure i understand the question . 
  gymnasium ( [ the german equivalent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secondary_school#germany ) to high school ) lasts until the students are ~ 18 years old . 
  of course the students are going to have `` sleepovers '' ( by `` sleepovers '' , you mean sex , right ? 
  ) , why would n't they ? 
  15-18-year olds have sex in every other country in the world as well . 
  sehr interessanter artikel . 
   cercis malice through marjories eyes, 
   lancel was pretty confident the kid was going to act like any other normal 8 year-old . 
  then why did he follow him at all ? 
  he had just been given an order by the high sparrow , to go and fetch the queen , and he sees some normal 8-year old boy and decides : `` wait , this is more important - i first have to follow that kid somewhere for some reason to do something . 
  the queen and the pope can wait . '', 
  can you somehow confirm this with the mods , please ?
