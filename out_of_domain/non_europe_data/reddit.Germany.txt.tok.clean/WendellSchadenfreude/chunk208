  even just 20 years from now , isis will mostly be the [ egyptian goddess ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isis ) again . 
  isis already stopped calling themselves isis anyway . 
  daaamn . 
  submitted to / r/threadkillers . 
  uh , i 'm sorry . 
  [ the memo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant ) must have gotten lost somehow . 
  isis was short for `` islamic state of iraq and syria '' ( or `` al-sham '' instead of `` syria '' , meaning the levante or greater syria ) . 
  since june 2014 , the group has been claiming that they are no longer just some terrorist organization , but * the * `` islamic state '' , lead by a `` caliph '' whom all muslims in the world should follow . 
  they thus dropped the second '' - is '' . 
  since about the same time , they have been losing more and more territory , and will hopefully soon be reduced to nothing but a small insurgent/terrorist group once again . 
  well , good morning , sunshine !, 
  you 're up , but you have n't had your coffee yet , right ? 
  pretty afternoon-y . 
  just came home from work , had a few drinks with some coworkers , and life is good . 
  oh , my bad . 
  will do , boss !, 
  probably . 
  you 'd best contact one of the mods ( like / u/oreng or / u/elburroloc0 directly and ask them how to get one of these little signs next to your name . 
  there are/were a few users here whose identities were known , such as petolucem or the pr guy of cizirecanton ; i do n't know what they did to prove that they are who they claim to be . 
  if there are pictures of you in syria on your facebook , you could simply post a link there , as you said . 
  sorry for being annoying , i just did n't want to jump into a q&a session with you when you might just be some fifteen-year old who claims to be one of the guys in that unit . 
  * nobody * in the uk has experience with anything like this . 
  if they go through with the brexit , they 'll need lawyers to work their way through literally tens of thousands of pages of eu law . 
  having a degree that even just roughly relates to this field should give you a guaranteed job in the next ~ ten years . 
  for anyone wondering : op did n't steal that showerthought from the [ toplevel comment in that other thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/4qls4j/wait_lena_dunham_is_calling_out_kanye_for/d4u7n6f ) . 
  it 's the same user . 
  you will need to officially leave the church . 
  if you are officially a member of the catholic church , you are legally required to pay church taxes in germany , and can get in trouble if you do n't . 
  it 's ** not enough ** to simply state something else on any immigration/registration documents . 
  [ [ geman law site that discusses this . 
  the catholic church is a well-organized global organization , and it 's possible for them to find out that you are still a member and living in germany . 
  time to get your official atheism membership card !, 
  isis ? 
  nazi germany ? 
  there are/were many examples for regimes where you could easily get killed for simply belonging to the `` wrong '' group of people , even when you did n't do anything against the regime youself . 
  i 'm guessing that it 's pretty hard for old men to learn a drill like that properly , even if it 's easy enough for them to do it if they learned it when they were young . 
  pretty much . 
  although they get the state to do the knocking . 
  what an absolute shitpost . 
  the `` humor '' part must be where they are using capslock . 
  the german is atrocious , the latin is worse , and even in english , the idiots mix up `` romantic '' and `` romanic '' . 
  i do n't get it .

  america , you need some damn unions !, 
   [ ... ] her dad [ ... ] i know nothing else about him or her . 
  i am fairly certain that he is in fact male . 
  i [ german ] generally hope that the brexit negotiations are amicable , and i do n't like how many europeans seem to be huffy and offended because of the british referendum , or even worse , how some want to `` set an example '' in the negotiations to scare other countries who might be thinking about leaving the union . 
  but if the uk/england tries to go all tax haven on us , i hope the eu does all that we can do to punish this behaviour . 
  any restrictions for trade with england would certainly harm the eu , but it would harm you more . 
  i 'd much rather suffer from punishing you for starting a tax `` race to the bottom '' than from actually racing you . 
  if england tries to attract corporations away from the eu by offering lower taxes , why would we allow these corporations to do business in the eu anymore , as if nothing happened ?

  the author makes a lot of good points , but then again :, 
   we routinely get figures referring to thousands of soldiers , and there seems like a real concern that we know who has more men or less men .

  that 's a dilemma , not a double standard . 
  a [ dilemma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dilemma ) is when you have to choose between two options , both of which are unpleasant . 
  a [ double standard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_standard ) is when two different people do the same thing , and people say that it 's good for one of them but bad for the other . 
  it 's a straight line east of castle black . 
  that 's long enough to serve as a scale . 
  i take it you 've already been to hamburg ? 
  otherwise , just go there , simply for logistical reasons . 
  berlin and k\u00f6ln are both great cities and absolutely worth a visit . 
  i guess berlin makes for the better `` story '' , so i 'd probably go there . 
  ok , next one :, 
  you were never meant to * be * . 
  go to hamburg then , and at least stay overnight !, 
  i refuse to even explain more - i 'm not doing your job for you , go experience hamburg yourself !, 
  mostly , we would learn from it . 
  if we found life ( in the form of some `` bacteriae '' ) on mars , we would first analyze its genetic code , to find out whether it 's dna-based . 
  if it is , this would show us that life almost certainly spread from earth to mars or the other way around at some point . 
  if it is * not * dna-based , we would know that it evolved independently . 
  this would be more exiciting , because we could then be sure that life evolves * often * when only some few conditions are met . 
  ( if life evolved on earth * and * on mars , it certainly also evolved on millions of other planets everywhere in the milky way . ), 
  for direct uses , we could learn the tricks that mars life used to adapt to mars conditions . 
  ( mostly how to survive in very cold , dry areas , i suppose . ), 
  if it 's dna life , we could potentially transfer some of these tricks to earth organisms ( * very * carefully ! ) . 
  if it 's noon-dna life , we could learn about a lot of new substances .

   the sea monster 's face shows you can obviously do a style that is n't so obviously influenced by the oatmeal .

  yeah , give your humans the face of that sea creature . 
  it looks cute !, 
  reminds me of a story i once heard about a smartass russian military academy cadet who was asked to explain what kind of terrain is best for tank operations . 
  his reply : `` any terrain that does n't have enemy anti-tank weapons . '', 
  i 'm sure it 's an urban legend , but the idea is true . 
  in the end , it 's apparently easier to have them pay taxes . 
  advantages :, 
  1 ) comparability . 
  if government employees did n't pay taxes , earning x would be completely different for them than it is for other people . 
  2 ) there are direct taxes ( income tax ) and indirect taxes ( sales tax ) . 
  government employees will always have to pay indirect taxes , just like everybody else . 
  if they did n't pay direct taxes , it would be beneficial for them if direct taxes were high and indirect taxes were low . 
  this would unnecessarily create new controversial political debates . 
  3 ) government employees can have other sources of income , e.g.
