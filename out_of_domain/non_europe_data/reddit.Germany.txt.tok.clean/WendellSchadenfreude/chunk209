  of course they need to pay taxes on those - but if they did n't pay taxes on their regular income , taxing any additional income would be complicated and unsystematic .

  can somebody who works in a retirement home comment on this ? 
  maybe i 'm too much of a cynic , but it sounds to me like they 'd have to be worried about gold diggers . 
  * if some young person walks into a retirement home and wants to spend time with lonely nonagenarians , that 's sweet - but it also sounds like the perfect foundation for all kinds of scams . 
  i agree that it sounds like a great idea , i 'm just wondering if it 's actually possible that easily .

  anybody who still gives americans shit because of their beer knows * nothing * about beer . 
  american beers * were * bad throughout most of the 20th century . 
  they were simply prohibited from 1920 until 1933 , and tightly regulated after that , which resulted in a very limited choice of watery , boring beers . 
  in 1979 , the [ beer market was finally deregulated ] ( http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2010/08/how-jimmy-carter-saved-craft-beer/19195/ ) , and many new breweries were founded . 
  this began slowly , but then the number of us breweries completely exploded in the 90s , and then ( after a slight lull in the early 2000s ) exploded again in the last few years . 
  today , america has [ more than 4,000 breweries ] ( https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/number-of-breweries/ ) , which serve beer for absolutely everbody 's taste . 
  if i were n't german , i would say that i 'm jealous . 
   so `` gr\u00f6len '' might be written `` gr\u00f6hlen '', 
  i was sure that `` gr\u00f6hlen '' is the correct spelling .

  according to [ most definitions ] ( http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/01/09/opinion/09borderlines-map1/09borderlines-map1-blog427.jpg ) , the north caucasus region is [ part of europe .

  the chechens certainly are n't central asians .

  `` collective '' in this context means the national guards . 
  according to this interpretation , they are the `` well regulated militia '' that the second amendment talks about , and individual citizens do n't necessarily have the right to own guns . 
  or the supervisor who simply does n't like one of his officers . 
  simple fix though : it should n't even be allowed to review the footage without either a complaint or the officer 's consent . 
  please , make a minimum effort to explain it , at least . 
  i think you 're right , by the way , but you 're also not being the least bit helpful . 
   that 's way to complicated to explain to a five year old and thus should be avoided .

  i think you end up having different names in germany and the uk , because the obe 's and stuff do n't become part of your name in germany .

  it just would n't say anything about it on your german passport . 
   it does n't matter how many tanks you have when hundreds of civilians stand in ` front of them . 
  that depends on how many tanks you have and how ruthless you are while using them . 
  see for instance the [ uprising in east germany in 1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uprising_of_1953_in_east_germany ) or the [ prague spring . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_spring ) both of them crushed by tanks , despite widespread popular support .

  most importantly : do n't worry . 
  people celebrate a polterabend mostly so that they can invite everybody who is n't important enough to be invited to the actual wedding . 
  ( that would be you . 
  no offense . ), 
  if you show up completely empty-handed , that would be ok . not perfect , but ok . 
  if some other colleagues have also been invited , it 's perfectly fine if you just all pitch in some money . 
  ( hand it over in an envelope with a nice card . ), 
  if possible , bring some old plates and cups . 
  most flowerpots probably are n't all that suitable . 
  if you do n't have any old porcelain ( and neither do your friends ) then i would n't even bother with this . 
  buying new porcelain just to smash it sounds too wasteful . 
  the polterabend will probably just be a relaxed evening of the couple 's families , friends , colleagues and neighbours sitting around , eating , drinking and chatting , with one or two silly games that the couple is forced to participate in . 
  direct reply just to make sure you see the other opinions on that spending range : 120 $ is * way * too much . 
  as a colleague ( who is n't also a close personal friend ) , you should n't spend more than * maybe * 30 $ . 
  if several colleagues are going , just pitching in 10 $ for a gift is also fine . 
  ( 5 $ if you 're a temp or an intern . ), 
  this range is assuming that each of you makes between ~ 1000 and ~ 2000 $ per month . 
  adjust as necessary .

  that 's a separate question really . 
  but they definitely had that list in a drawer somewhere and were ready to `` execute order 66 '' at the first good opportunity . 
  now you 're making it sounds like it 's not a big deal , but it 's still fascist lemonade . 
  democratic leaders do not have lists of judges and governors that they would like to sack at first opportunity just lying around . 
  no they do n't , you bitter user of salty catchphrases . 
  can you name an example of a democratic leader who ever , anywhere in the world , had hundreds of judges or politicians arrested in a single day ? 
  you ca n't ( practically by definition ) , and it is thus absurd to believe that democratic leaders today have lists prepared for such a case . 
  those lists would n't benefit them , but pose an enormous risk if they were ever leaked . 
  provide an example of a democratic leader who had hundreds of judges and opposition politicians removed from office then . 
  i do n't think the difference is all that relevant in this context . 
  of course if makes a big difference for the individual person who is either arrested or simply sent home ( assuming that they will be left alone after having been removed from office ) . 
  but from the point of view of legality and democracy , the removing from office is the part that 's imporant . 
  [ the post i 'm replying to originally only said `` julius caesar . '' ], 
  certainly not a democrat . 
  also , he is rather famous for his clemency and for * not * using `` proscriptions '' . 
  i can believe that a lot of that was just propaganda and that he did in fact have a kill list of his secret enemies , but he was at least restrained in that regard by the standards of his time . 
  still not a democrat , though . 
  concerning your edit :, 
   oh and hitler and he did it the exact same way as is happening now . 
  ok , now you 're just confused .
