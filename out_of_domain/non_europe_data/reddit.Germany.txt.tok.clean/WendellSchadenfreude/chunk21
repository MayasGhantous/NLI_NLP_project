  the weimar republic ? 
  ... not much of a regime , really . ], 
  ignoring everything ironic about this : it 's always a bad idea to think that the nazis were simply `` stupid people '' . 
  makes it impossible to understand history , makes it impossible to learn from it . 
  there 's even people who deny that it 's hollow !, 
  out of curiosity , could you point me to one or two maps that code a lot of information in a way that is easy to decipher for the colorblind ( or people with * your * kind of colorblindness ) ? 
  do you know how/why it got to southern spain so early ? 
  edit : ok , i 'll expand this a little . 
  i just looked at the german wikipedia article on `` english cuisine '' , and i love how it starts :, 
   ( my translation ) since it 's often very greasy and hearty , the traditional english cuisine has the reputation of being stodgy and boring outside enland . 
  this is the first sentence . 
  germans do * not * like english food . 
  but of course you 're right , it is far more similar to continental european food than , say , thai or mexican ( etc. ), 
  food is . 
  `` america '' is a word of italian ( or , if you will , german ) origin . 
  that does n't mean americans should feel italian . 
  if you ask canadians or brasilians wether they feel `` american '' , what kind of results do you expect ? 
  ( ok , that 's a mean comparison ...  ), 
  mitchell and webb know why . 
   i live in georgia ( united states ) . 
  upvote for this alone . 
  whenever someone writes they are from georgia , i sadly sit there wondering `` which one ? '', 
  - but not this time !, 
  in the books , was n't the `` rains '' the last song the `` musicians '' played before the ... you know ... ? 
  but be careful with that . 
  i just tried `` croats are ... '' in german , and autocomplete suggests '' ... persians '' - is that better ? 
  ( or can you explain to me why it would suggest this ? ), 
  germans are weird . 
  or maybe it means weird . 
  ( in sociology : `` western , educated , industrialized , rich , democratic '' ), 
  was n't invented by him . 
  [ i think it 's actually a simpsons reference .

  i like red . 
  i kinda like blue . 
  ~ ~ ~ green looks like a huge fucking douchebag . 
  ( his own words , i would n't usually be this rude . 
  ) ~ ~ ~ edit : ok , let 's be more polite : there was no reason for you to insult red . 
  remember that he and all his loved ones are going to die within a few short decades , and then try being nice to him in the meantime . 
  what would make me really happy would be a screenshot of you apologizing to him . 
  it would also make you look like a bigger person . 
  [ / edit ], 
  sidenote , though : good job on the coloring . 
  it 's very easy to distinguish who is who ; and it 's very easy to talk about . 
  i 'd downvote you . 
  [ edit ] this is for tv , radio , and some pages on the internet . 
  [ / edit ], 
  short answer : yes . 
  longer answer : no , but something similar . 
  there 's an english wikipedia entry explain most of it :, 
  the article actually explains the old system , they are changing it right now , but the change does n't really need to concern you . 
  the big change is that so far you had to pay when you owned a tv/radio/computer , now every household has to pay , regardless of devices . 
  the fee is 17,98 $ per month for every household . 
  print , btw : no public financing . 
  there is one small newspaper ( `` das parlament '' ) published by the bundestag , but hardly anyone even knows that . 
  mind to elaborate ... ? 
  the best i could do for you :, 
  [ are the faroese people senseless terrorizing murderous dolphin killers ? 
  ] ( http://elinbrimheimheinesen.blogspot.de/2009/09/no-respect-for-whales.html ), 
  [ this was n't autocomplete , but one of the first results i found . 
  i do n't get any autocomplete suggestions for `` why are the faroese ... '' , etc. 
  from the article :, 
   some people outside the faroes think that *** faroese people are senseless primitive murderous inbred drunken brutal beasts who once a year kill thousands of intelligent dolphins for fun as a ` coming of age ritual ' *** just to leave most of the whales to rot on the beach and feeding the rest of the poisonous meat to their innocent children . 
  happy now ? 
  `` sorry i called you out on your bigotry . '', 
  - that would make an awful apology in any case . 
  `` i blamed you for oppression that you are in no way responsible for . 
  i also called you a `` huge fucking douchebag '' for no good reason . 
  that was uncalled for . 
  i 'm sorry i insulted you , i just sometimes overreact ; the oppression of gay people all around the world and even in the us angers me , and this sometimes makes me forget my manners . '', 
  - something along these lines , maybe . 
  of course you do n't * need * to do anything . 
  i 'm not your mother , and i 'm not the internet police . 
  i 'm just a stranger telling you about his ideas on how to make the world a better place . 
  but you did insult him for no good reason ; and i think you know that yourself . 
  no , silverionmox , he would n't do that . 
  and you know why , silverionmox ? 
  it 's because you , silverionmox , are important to him . 
  he wakes up in the morning thinking `` silverionmox is my favorite customer . 
  i 'm happy to work with people like silverionmox every day . '', 
  silverionmox , ai n't that fantastic ? 
  silverionmox , how do you feel about that , silverionmox ? 
  silverionmox !, 
  cool . 
  do you have a complete list of the in-between ancestors ? 
  also : where do you live ?

  part 2 , chapter 5 . 
  `` up to 1,900 million '' *** does *** include 6000 . 
  in that picture : creepy . 
  but do n't worry . 
  it 's probably not really your cat blinking . 
  only your cat 's reflection . 
  does that make it better ? 
  pretty sure those are not related . 
  know your enemy : the reflection likes you . 
  your cat hates you . 
  cretans love it , too .
