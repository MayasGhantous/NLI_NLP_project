  hitler is not a good example of a democratic leader . 
  but yeah , he did have a list of hundreds of opposition politicians ( and other people ) that he had removed from office and arrested [ at first opportunity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichstag_fire#political_consequences ), 
  hitler was not an example of a democratic leader , not on his first day in office , not before he was elected , not at any point in his life . 
   there was a big groundswell of support for getting rid of the jews among the german populace . 
  is that not democratic ? 
  democracy includes the rule of law , human rights , protection of minorities . 
  hitler was never a democratic leader , not because he was a `` big meany jerk '' , but because he never was a democrat . 
  at best , you can claim that he was * democratically elected * , although that is already a bit of a stretch . 
   assume that my audience otherwise thinks my german is perfect . 
  do n't worry , they already do n't . 
  it 's the equivalent of using `` he '' instead of `` him '' in english , or `` give '' instead of `` gives '' , or `` goed '' instead of `` went '' - native speakers will always notice when you 're misgendering words , and will know that you 're a foreigner . 
  do n't worry about it , it does n't mean that people wo n't understand you or will get annoyed . 
  biggest problem is that they might switch to speaking english with you . 
  [ germans very occasionally use the wrong gender when we change our mind in the middle of a sentence and end up using a different word than we had originally planned . 
  but this still somehow sounds different from the way foreigners misgender words . ], 
   learn the articles with the nouns . 
  i so often wish i had listened to my german professors when they told me this . 
  yes , this ca n't be said often enough . 
  when you learn german , do n't memorize, 
  tree = baum, 
  house = haus, 
  sun = sonne . 
  instead , learn, 
  right from the very beginning . 
  the silvery-white area that is visible after that ( around 7:30 for instance ) - is that the eardrum ? 
  [ source . 
  [ what he 's actually doing . 
  i ca n't come up with a ** ni ppon ** s about this . 
  does n't look all that difficult . 
  `` mommy lapi not a pie . '', 
  remember the weird `` lapi '' part , and you 're good to go . 
  nope . 
  you ca n't feel schadenfreude at someone 's * good * fortune , only at someone 's misfortune . 
  words for envy and jealousy also exist in german . 
  ( neid , missgunst , and eifersucht . 
  neid = * i want that too * . 
  missgunst = * i do n't want him to have that . 
  * eifersucht = mostly in romantic contexts . ], 
  what 's wrong with the sentence `` i ca n't come up with any puns about this '' ? 
  i thought the opposite myself : the sentence is fine , my pun was admittedly not that great . 
  that explains why we live on a planet that has an atmosphere that 's good for us . 
  but having a planet that 's small enough that we are able to overcome its gravity and get into space - that is just sheer luck . 
  we did not evolve for that . 
   i guess theres only one instance of that happening , but still . 
  this has happened several times already . 
  two of the big instances are division 30 and harakat hazzm . 
  but this guy did something that might slightly annoy his ex-girlfriend !, 
  the whole insanity of it !, 
  what an absolute madman . 
  ordering a live bobcat to her place would have been crazy . 
  ordering condoms to your place - who the fuck cares ? 
  if you 're annoyed because you keep losing , stop playing nations like byzantium entirely . 
  that 's a nation you play when you * want * a challenge . 
  for russia : why did n't you simply keep playing ? 
  the game is n't over when you 're the minor partner in a pu . 
  the french alliance with the commonwealth might not last forever , and even if it does : at some point , they will be at war with the ottomans , sweden and spain at the same time , while your independence is supported by england and austria ( or something like that ) . 
  the game is much more fun when you actually have to overcome challenges at some point !, 
  the castille game sounds like bad luck , but then again : why 'd you have to go to war against austria at all ? 
  just wait for a good opportunity , while you establish some colonies and expand into france or something . 
  ** the game is not over just because * something bad happened * . 
  keep playing , wait for your time to come . 
  ** waltzing from victory to victory while you conquer the entire world is fun once or twice , but it 's much more glorious if you actually lead your nation through some hardships and ultimately overcome enemies that oppressed your country for centuries . 
  [ social security was already mentioned . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_security_ ( united_states ), 
  but also , belgium sends a [ higher number of jihadis ] ( http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html ) to syria than any other western country , adjusted for population size . 
  congraz for finding this , but shame on you and florry for not simply * writing the trick down * . 
  there 's no reason to watch a long , boring video . 
  the bug :, 
  - sell a ship to a country ( for any non-zero amount ) . 
  - without unpausing , save and leave the game . 
  - after resuming , the target country is at 0 land and sea upkeep , meaning they have hardly any trade power and their troops will shatter in every fight . 
  you do n't need a 14-minute video to explain this . 
  to be fair , that `` poem '' actually was nothing but personal attacks , not `` criticism '' . 
  [ he was even presenting it as `` saying something like this would be illegal in germany '' . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4552je_english-subtitled-neo-magazine-royale-erdogan-schmahkritik-with-jan-bohmermann-boehmermann-31-03-20_school?start=145 ), 
  it 's only reflexive if you 're doing it to yourself . 
  but :, 
   replacing perfectly healthy and fine-looking teeth with fake ones because of aesthetics . 
  do americans actually do that ? 
  i thought the insanely white teeth just came from using whiteners . 
  as a customer , i do n't care about those problems . 
  i just want to know how much money i 'll end up paying . 
  stores could easily label all products * correctly * , displaying the price that their customers will actually have to pay . 
  customer convenience is usually valued so highly in the us , it 's weird that it 's completely ignored in this regard . 
  what buts and ifs ? 
  - if you restart the game * again * , the bug-induced bankruptcy ends and the nations returns to normal . 
  ( although you can of course just pull off the same thing again . ), 
  that 's all i can think of . 
  granted , i never made it to the end of that video , so there might have been more . 
  these reviews are nonsense . 
  it 's a great game without any dlc . 
  you can visit germany and should be perfectly safe . 
  however , you will probably meet with some rejection . 
  to reduce this and make your stay more comfortable , ask your wife if she would like to take that hijab off ( and possibly even wear western clothes in general ) . 
  if you 're wearing long dresses ( like [ this ] ( https://aishaalialali.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dishdasha-300x273.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/138719318-two-arab-men-standing-near-the-office-wall-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=xhm1vfqieyvw0uah7jdc%2fvak9v5b4qd01%2buygny5zeo%2fwvuhp%2b6r2ws9hbo7fas4 ) ) yourself , you might also want to change into western clothes while you 're here . 
  it 's not necessary , but it 's an obvious gesture of goodwill on your part . 
  / u/hufflepufffan already gave a good translation , but i want to stress the more important part of his answer : germans do n't use checks . 
  i 'm in my thirties , and i 've never used or even * seen * a check in my life . 
  if somebody sent me one , i would n't know what to do with it .
