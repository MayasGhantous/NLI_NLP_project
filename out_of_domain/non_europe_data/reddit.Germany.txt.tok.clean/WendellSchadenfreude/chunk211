  if you have any other option , sending a check is probably not a good idea . 
  is a simple bank transfer not possible ? 
  good preparation . 
  enjoy your trip to germany then !, 
  i would rather be on the safer side when it comes to speed limits - so why are we allowing more than 10mph anywhere in the country ? 
  the lowest limits for potentially harmful things are * not * always the best . 
   toxic algae blooms, 
  to be fair , this has nothing to do with the measures that the article discusses . 
  algae blooms are not caused by some trace carcinogens in the water . 
  `` popeln '' , as suggested by the first replies , is a very childish way of saying this . 
  maybe that 's exactly what you 're looking , but just in case , the more serious ways of saying this would be :, 
  or simply, 
  `` finger weg * von * der nase '' might work , although that sounds like you do n't want them to touch the outside of their nose . 
  without the `` von '' , it does n't work at all . 
  yes , `` finger weg '' means `` hands off '' . 
  but if you want to say `` hands off x '' , then you have to add `` von '' in german . 
  `` hands off the cookies '' is `` finger weg von den keksen '' . 
  [ `` rambomesser '' ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=rambomesser&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=886&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiuqbnu8ppoahwgi8akhztyalgq_auibigb ) scheint ziemlich genau definiert zu sein ; jedenfalls sehen die google-bilder alle praktisch gleich aus . 
  i think we should just consider this an ama request . 
  you can see his dramatic rolls in the gif , at the bottom left corner . 
  pretty obvious choice : saarland . 
  you prefer being close to our brother , you already knew the language once and only need to re-learn it , you like the city better . 
  that would already be an easy decision . 
  but on top of all that , you also have a scholarship in saarbr\u00fccken !, 
  you do n't throw away thousands of dollars on not-even-a-whim . 
  plus , studying on a scholarship sounds great on your cv . 
  saarland it is , all the way . 
  make that choice now , and never question it again . 
  first one sounds good . 
  second one sounds a tiny bit silly ; i think it 's because `` ziehen '' just implies too much effort , like the finger might be stuck . 
  [ here 's a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkorp55aqvg ) showing that situation . 
   i worked as a delivery driver for a few pizza places and while they check to make sure your car has insurance , personal insurance does n't cover use of cars for business purposes . 
  every pizza delivery i 've ever known had a company car ( or scooter ) that was used for the deliveries . 
  is that not the case everywhere ? 
  employees using their own cars to deliver pizza sounds sketchy as hell to me . 
  so much confusion about the `` youth housing complexes '' . 
  in this map , the one in ne bani zayd is controlled by the regime , while the one next to castello road is still rebel held . 
  in some other maps , the ypg controls one or even both . 
  i guess it will take a day or two until we actually now the new frontlines . 
  either way , aleppo city is completely cut off . 
  get some rest . 
  the number of troops they can use for actual offensive operations is limited , and the advantage of a siege is that you do n't have to do anything . 
  they will dig in and wait for a while . 
  every day that goes by , more people ( civilians and militants ) will flee aleppo city , and the remaining defenders will become weaker and weaker . 
  the saa shock troops will get some rest , and will be re-deployed to a different active front in a few weeks . 
  i 'm guessing south aleppo , pushing towards al-fu ` ah . 
  come spring , they will proudly rebrand themselves as `` the wooden bank of braavos '' .

  he will quietly imprison , torture and execute * some * people . 
  but executing tens of thousands of syrians is simply not practical , nor is it in the interest of the regime . 
  letting the main part of the opposition return home is much better than having to fight them , and letting them work and pay taxes is far more lucrative than imprisoning and executing them . 
  the government will mistreat and kill * some * people , sadly . 
  claiming that they will torture and execute every single opposition fighter is just silly . 
  interesting map that shows large areas ( correctly ) as simply not controlled by anyone . 
  all the flat areas between two villages are of course no man 's land . 
  i 'm not quite as pessimistic as the others , but it 's true that school alone wo n't get you to fluency . 
  [ the foreign service institute has some estimates ] ( http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty ) for how long it takes for an english speaker to reach `` general professional proficiency '' in different languages . 
  for german , they estimate 750 hours - but that 's for an intensive 30 week course with 25 hours of classes per week . 
  if you learn german only at school , for some 4 hours per week ( ? 
  ) , you wo n't even reach those 750 hours after 4 years - and they will be less effective since they are spread out so much and you learn a lot of other stuff as well . 
  however , if you actually put some effort in and learn not just in class but also for another two or three hours per week at home , you can become quite good within four years . 
  good enough to read books and have some actual conversations , and most importantly : good enough to enjoy coming to germany and immersing yourself in the language , which is the only way to become actually fluent . 
  i do n't remember much about the book . 
  i think `` momo '' might be an easier ( and shorter ) choice . 
  [ relevant xkcd . 
  as a german , i think this is a bigger fail on my country 's part . 
  we 're spending billions on solar panels . 
  as long as california is n't absolutely covered in those things , it 's just obvious that we are wasting money by using them . 
   becasue renly [ ... ] probly wont have an heir . 
  i doubt it . 
  being gay is not an excuse to not do what 's best for your country and family . 
  just close your eyes and think of ~ ~ england ~ ~ the seven kingdoms . 
  none of the countries ( or states ) that get two or three times as much sun as germany are taking that opportunity . 
  if solar power were worth it in germany , how much more would it be worth it california , florida , spain , greece ? 
  conveniently , the sun also shines exactly when you have all your acs running - which we do n't even have in germany . 
  you either believe that germany is making bank on solar power , and portugal , italy , texas , turkey , japan ( all of these places get far more sun than germany ) are just too stupid to see it , even though they could easily make many times as much - or you have to admit that germany is wasting a lot of money here . 
  that may be true and useful for some technologies , but solar power in germany is still a huge waste of money . 
  i 'm not arguing against * every part * of the `` energiewende '' , but for some reason , you 're seen as an anti-environmentalist if you argue against * any * part of it . 
  if we were building solar panels and selling them to i.e. 
  spain , that might make sense . 
  but most manufacturers of solar panels in germany went bankrupt over the last ~ 10 years . 
  among the [ top ten largest manufacturers of solar panels in the world , ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/163986/umfrage/weltweit-groesste-hersteller-von-solarzellen/ ) there is one german company left . 
  * using * solar panels in germany when there are still roofs in spain that do n't have one is an obvious waste of resources . 
  ( and to be clear : the guy who puts it on his roof can still make money off of it in germany . 
  but that 's just because of heavy subsidies ; it 's still a societal net loss . ), 
  they expect to install ~ 1/4 of what germany already has installed by 2020 , according to wikipedia . 
  almost all of the other places i mentioned are also increasing their use of solar power . 
  and that 's fine - they * should * be using solar power much more than germany is using it . 
  and once it 's obvious that solar power is actually worth it in spain , we should also look into it if it would be worth it in france . 
  then germany . 
  sadly , that 's not the order in which things are actually done . 
  my argument is that there 's hardly any place in the world that uses solar power as much as germany does , although there are dozens of developed countries and 49 us states that get more sunshine hours than germany . 
  ( sidenote : they also get more vertical sun , which is a huge advantage for pv . ), 
  that 's probably because it 's not actually a net gain even in these sunny places . 
  if it 's not * obviously * a net gain in places like the us or spain , it ca n't even be anywhere close in germany . 
  it 's kind of you if you think that germans are smarter than * all * of these people . 
  but i do n't believe that . 
  hey , and now you got downvoted as well . 
  fox news got the amount of sunshine wrong that germany gets .
