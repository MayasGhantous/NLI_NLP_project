  that 's an embarassing mistake , and they should be ashamed of themselves . 
  but at least they understood that the amount of sunshine that a place gets * matters * and that solar energy might be a good idea in one place while being a bad idea in another place ( with the same technology ) . 
  for most of reddit , this is apparently too complicated . 
   for one , even if it 's not that profitable right now , it might be in the future, 
  and i would be all for it in the future . 
  but that does n't make doing it * now * any smarter . 
  germany should put money in researching solar power . 
  * not * in putting solar panels on german roofs . 
  sidenote about dependency on foreign countries : solar hardly reduces germany 's dependency on foreign oil and gas . 
  we get [ 6 % of our * electricity * from solar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/stromerzeugung_deutschland.png ) , but we could easily get those from coal . 
  ( which we have a lot of - so there 's no dependency . ), 
  but that 's only for electricity - oil and gas are mostly used for transportation and heating , and solar does n't help with those at all . 
  i 'm just trying to refute the `` leading role '' argument . 
  that could be a good argument , if germany were developing cool new products and selling them to the rest of the world . 
  but instead , we * buy * solar panels from other countries and put them on our roofs . 
  shipping chinese solar panels to germany is such a glaring waste of resources . 
  china has far more sunshine , and they have a far higher demand for new sources of electricity , while germany already has good power plants and only sometimes needs to replace old ones . 
  but instead of putting solar panels up in china , we ship them around half the globe and install them in a particularly dark country - all in the name of environmentalism !, 
  and that 's cool . 
  but germany still has 40gw of installed pv capacity , compared to 25gw for the entire us . 
  and german consumers pay $ 8.5 bn for pv electricity every year , for 6 % of our electricity . 
  we get twice as much from wind , for less than half the cost . 
  i know they are , and i know that it 's increasing . 
  and once it 's huge , we germans should have a thorough look at it , analyze how profitable it is , and * then * decide whether it might also be good for our country . 
  although we should still let france go first . 
  sadly , the whole debate is not guided by numbers , but by feelings . 
  have a look at the source that i just posted . 
  germany does not depend on other countries for electricity . 
  we buy foreign coal because it 's cheaper , but we could use our own just as well . 
  gas makes up less than 10 % of our electricity , oil is n't even listed separately . 
  we need oil and gas for transportation and heating , but pv does n't help with that at all . 
  and if you insist on renewable energy : we get more than twice as much electricity from wind as from solar . 
  and we pay less than half as much for it .

   due to mods being like `` okay i do n't see whats going on here '' and removing the post , even though the point was obvious, 
  if it 's not obvious to the mods , you can bet your ass that it 's not obvious to  50 % of the users either . 
  exactly !, 
  i * wish * we 'd wait and see . 
  pay for research and wait for the * good * solar technology ( or something else ) to come along , instead of jumping ahead of ourselves and putting billions into * bad * solar technology . 
   as for your sidenote : that might be a reason to invest more in , among others , solar, 
  you claim that solar reduces the german dependency on foreign nation . 
  i show you that it does n't . 
  you tell me that might be a reason to invest even more in solar . 
  i do n't understand your argument . 
  obtaining knowledge is * great * . 
  i 've said it about a dozen times in this thread , we should invest tons of money into solar power * research * . 
  but research does n't include putting millions of solar panels on roofs . 
  panels that we bought from china , because * they * have the infrastructure to produce them cheaper than we can do it already - so even if other countries switch use more solar , germany would hardly benefit from that . 
  german consumers pay more than $ 8bn extra every year for solar energy . 
  put half of that into research , and i 'd be so happy . 
  do you know any comparison of profitability between solar and wind in texas ? 
  it 's very clear in germany ( wind blows solar out of the water ) , but i wonder how they fare relative to each other in places with far more sunshine . 
   ( btw , $ 8 billion does n't sound like that much , right ? ), 
  [ it 's roughly two entire harvards .

  in what way ? 
  to me , they look pretty typical . 
  which makes it all the more important to use some periods . 
   not on canadian netflix though . 
  peep show is n't just on netflix , but also on youtube in a complete ( s1-s8 ) , ordered list . 
  every episode uploaded in three parts , but that 's a very minor annoyance . 
  so for anyone else with no netflix or canadian netflix , [ just go here .

  since when ? 
  about a week ago , the regime managed to completely isolate the rebel held eastern part of the city by taking some land in the northwest ( near the castello highway ) . 
  in response to that , opposition groups have started a large assault to break the siege , attacking from the southwest . 
  they definitely had some intial success , but after that , i do n't think anyone can rightly claim to know what exactly is happening . 
  important areas during this rebel offensive are the `` 1070 apartments project '' and the `` artillery school '' - if the rebels take both , they have basically broken the siege . 
  i think the rebels initially took the 1070 projects , but were thrown back after that . 
  however , they may actually never have taken it , or they may have taken it and still hold it , or they may have taken and lost and then re-taken it - nobody really knows . 
  the artillery school is controlled by the regime , although some people claim that the rebels have taken some part of it . 
  wait until tomorrow or the day after that , and we will know more . 
  i have a feeling that you do n't know what `` fait accompli '' means . 
   a thing that has already happened or been decided before those affected hear about it , leaving them with no option but to accept it . 
  if the siege holds and assad 's troops eventually take aleppo , you are right that the war is essentially over . 
   where jon is elected ( is that the right word ? ), 
  proclaimed . 
  fait accompli does not mean the point in a fight when you realize that you are losing . 
  it means that you are presented with something without ever having had a chance to fight ( or argue or disagree ) . 
  i have no idea why you would do it , but you * are * doing it . 
  it 's a fait accompli for me - you just started using the phrase without ever asking me , and i did n't get to tell you not to do it . 
  you just started all of a sudden , and it was apparently too late for me to do anything about it . 
  considering they are the attacking force in an urban area and their enemies have total air superiority , i 'm surprised the rebels have n't lost a least 3 times as many men as the government . 
  how can somebody be so dumb ? 
  `` we know where their positions are because they were careless and talked about it online . 
  and now i 'm giving away this advantage by talking about it on tv ! '', 
  there was a thread on here just yesterday about pokemon go in syria , specifically eastern ghouta . 
  just because it 's a warzone does n't mean that everybody is busy fighting * all the time * . 
  you must be confusing something . 
  pr\u00e4teritum is the grammatical tense that is used for almost all novels and stories . 
  however , in everyday speech , people are much more likely to use the perfekt . 
  i do n't see how that is a `` wtf america '' moment . 
  [ britain * used to * celebrate thanksgiving ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thanksgiving#united_kingdom ) , just like practically everyone else in the world . 
  it just never was quite as big a deal as thanksgiving in the us is today . 
  english , no doubt . 
  even if the question were broken english or good german , i 'd probably go with english first . 
   it really is n't about her religion . 
  except that if her religion were islam , chances are good that she would never even want to be a wine queen . 
  i also know some people who call themselves muslims and drink acohol . 
  of course this happens , that 's why i wrote `` chances are good '' .
