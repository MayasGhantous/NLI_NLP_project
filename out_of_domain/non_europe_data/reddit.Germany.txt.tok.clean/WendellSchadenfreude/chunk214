  [ `` lafayette , we are here . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_e._stanton#lafayette_quote ), 
   giles corey ( september 11 , 1611 -- september 19 , 1692 ) was accused of witchcraft along with his wife martha corey during the salem witch trials . 
  after being arrested for witchcraft , corey refused to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty . 
  he was subjected to pressing in an effort to force him to plead -- the only example of such a sanction in american history -- but instead died after two days of torture . 
   [ ... ] finally , giles corey cried out `` more weight ! '', 
  and died . 
  supposedly , just before his death , he cursed sheriff corwin and the entire town of salem . 
  he was 81 . 
  from the picture , i would guess that they were smuggling cigarettes , coffee , sweets , and the like . 
  not essential supplies , but small luxuries that can be sold at a high profit in besieged villages . 
  as long as they have any money , at least . 
  ( or maybe they were smuggling food and their executioners placed those items next to their bodies to make it seem like they were n't . 
  who knows . ), 
  the law would obviously apply to men as well . 
  also , if we have to take the burqa away from the women who proudly wear it to show their dislike for our society and all of our values so that we can liberate the women who only wear it because they are forced by their male relatives - hey , that 's a double-win !, 
   i 'd appreciate if someone could remind me how many terrorist attacks were performed by burka-wearing women ? 
  dozens . 
  [ here are a few examples . 
  i 'm sure there 'll be one or two cases where this is the consequence , and i 'm sorry for them . 
  but at least not allowing someone to ever leave the house is obviously illegal already . 
  we need to make sure every young muslim girl in germany knows this , and then at least they have legal tools available against their oppressors . 
  but i doubt that this will be the consequence in more than a handful of cases . 
  it 's just really unpractical in germany . 
  the men would need to do all the shopping , run all errands , pick up the kids from school , and they 'd need to get at-home appointments with hairdressers , doctors , and the like . 
  men who are consequent and barbaric enough for this probably do n't let `` their '' women leave the house much anyway . 
  that 's an argument * for * the ban - there are n't many women who wear burqas in germany , so lets ban them preemptively and make it clear that we do n't want them here . 
  and it 's not firing at anything but burqas . 
  there 's nothing harsh about it at all . 
  `` our islamist enemies '' can also use the fact that we eat pork against us in their propaganda . 
  our they could use all kinds of lies , as they do often enough . 
  if anybody hates us because we ban burqas , they already hated us before . 
   so how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire internet handles in a month ? 
  oh god , that 's so cute . 
  does anybody have a version with clearer audio ? 
  should have used a [ hexagon .

   45 % male , 45 % female , and 10 % kids . 
  far more kids . 
  [ in 2010 , the median age of the syrian population was 21.8 years . 
  ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/326576/average-age-of-the-population-in-syria/ ), 
   there was a guardian reports that in the whole of aleppo there are around 30k civilians left, 
  that was only rebel-held east aleppo . 
  the majority of the population lives in the western part of the city , * far more * than 30k . 
  probably still close to 2 million . 
  ta-da !, 
  edit : ne , is schon gut . 
   they may be of romani extraction , although this theory is disputed and theories of pre-celt origin also exist . 
   their origin is genetically irish . 
  do n't feel too bad if it does n't work out well . 
  the castile start is actually quite difficult . 
  if france and aragon rival you and form an alliance , you 'll have a hard time dealing with them early on . 
  why would anyone do that ? 
   never heard of salted liquorice before ,, 
  oh you poor , lost child , your entire life so far has been wasted !, 
  go to [ the thread about ` what event divided your life into `` before '' and `` after '' ' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/4xocmb/what_event_divided_your_life_into_before_and_after/ ) and say that it was reading * this * thread , because your life will never be the same once you start eating the * best stuff there is * !, 
  i found it completely impossible to tell one club from the other , so [ i made this version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6mln4hh.gif ) which i hope is much easier to read . 
  what is `` 50 '' ? 
  i do n't know all of these , but some . 
   what does he means with `` knolle '' , is it a slang ? 
  is he talking about tubers , literally ? 
  it 's slang , and probably means `` high on magic mushrooms '' . 
  could possibly also just mean `` drunk '' , although that would more commonly be `` kn\u00fclle '' . 
  that 's not really a sentence . 
  your translation is correct , and it 's just as weird in german . 
  you have to read that together with the next line : '' ... auch zu dem dope einfach besser '' . 
  i would translate it as `` bangs better with the dope '' or something - it just means that they combine very well . 
   what `` breit '' means here ? 
  `` breit '' is slang for `` high '' . 
  i think you are getting the joke at the end , it 's just not a very good one . 
  `` niederlande '' ( * netherlands * ) and `` niederlage '' ( * defeat * ) sounds similar . 
  he says that this is just coincidence , except in the context of football : because the dutch are so bad at football ( according to this song ) . 
  they are bad at it , but at least they are good at losing . 
  meh joke at best . 
  / r/crusaderkings already showed what this can lead to : [ from norse to horse 2.0 : how a horse exterminated all of mankind ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings/comments/4mo3rd/from_norse_to_horse_20_how_a_horse_exterminated/ ) . 
  shit , you 're right . 
  i did n't convert the file manually , of course , i just did n't notice when imgur ( ? ), 
  did . 
  [ anyway , here 's an improved version as a png . 
  in ck2 , it was possible to appoint a horse as your chancellor when your ruler had the `` lunatic '' trait . 
  ( [ see caligula/incitatus . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incitatus ) ), 
  specifically for this flair event , they added a horse picture as a character portrait . 
  the horse chancellor would also have `` horse culture '' and receive the `` horse '' trait , which would make it impossible for this character to marry or be granted land - this was meant to make it impossible to use horses as playable characters . 
  this player however found a loophole : he appointed the horse as heir to a bishopric ( the developers simply forgot to dis-allow this ) , killed the old bishop and thus created a land-holding horse . 
  the game then automatically created new characters for the horse-bishop 's council - and while those also had horse culture , they did n't have the `` horse '' trait . 
  the player then married his own character to the new , marrigable horses , spawned a dynasty of horse children , conquered the entire known world as a horse and wiped out almost all of humanity . 
   nobody thought it was weird that aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall their jewish ( to say nothing of the myriad other persecuted groups ) friends , neighbours , colleagues , acquaintances , and even distant family ... just disappeared ? 
  to a goddamn farm ? 
  you might be overestimating the number of jews that lived in germany at the time . 
  according to the nazi census of 1939 ( [ german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksz%c3%a4hlung_im_deutschen_reich_1939#angaben_zu_.e2.80.9ejuden.e2.80.9c ) ) , there were only 234.000 jews among a population of 69.3 million people . 
  that 's 0.34 % - it 's entirely possible that most germans did n't know any jews personally , or at least not more than one or two . 
  ( for comparison : jews today make up [ around 2 % of the population in the us . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_jews ) ), 
  most of the jews who were killed in the holocaust did n't come from germany , but from poland and other eastern/central european countries under german occupation . 
  of course , before this census was taken , there had already been severe discrimination against the jews in germany , [ attempts to force them into emigration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89vian_conference ) and the [ progroms of november 1938 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kristallnacht ) . 
  those were public , so every german knew about them , obviously . 
  but knowing about those things is still very different from knowing about the holocaust . 
   how you felt your apart of history now, 
  * you 're a part,
