  but `` apart '' is also wrong , it 's `` a part '' . 
  [ `` apart ( from ) '' means separate , aside .

  '' [ a part ( of ) ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/part#noun ) '' is almost the opposite , and is what you mean . 
  there are some people on this sub who support the rebels , there are some who support the government , there are some who only support the sdf , there are even one or two who support isis . 
  playing the blame game every time you read a post by someone who cheers for a different side than you do does n't help anyone , you 're essentially just spamming .

  the women wearing burka have to wear it everywhere except at home , not just on trips to the beach . 
  and the punishment for refusing to wear one is n't just a roasting by your friends in the places where they are common . 
  yeah , because women in the west are totally forced to wear nothing but bikinis every time they leave their home . 
   some wear the burkini out of choice , not oppression . 
  those are usually the ones participating in the oppressing . 
  try talking to a woman wearing a wedding ring , report back with the results .

  that 's because you 've never studied the rise to power of any oppressive movement . 
  simply tolerating the intolerant does not protect the freedom of a society . 
   the only reason, 
  i do n't presume that . 
  i presume it 's a very * common * reason . 
  of course there are some fanatics who * want * this kind of life . 
  i do n't value their freedom to show their disdain for our entire way of life as highly as the freedom of the people who usually become their first victims - their less fanatic fellow muslims . 
  entire countries ' worth of evidence . 
  look at saudi arabia , look at iran !, 
   as highly as, 
  there 's the real problem . 
  you 're just protecting intolerance and oppression . 
  not at all . 
  they are a poor representation of muslims who want to live in free societies and * do n't * wear symbols of oppression . 
  they are , however , are good representation of the way of life that many islamic fanatics want to force on others . 
  maybe you would protect the right of people to hang out in front of black churches wearing kkk uniforms . 
  maybe you still would do that if there were regular attacks on these churches by kkk members . 
  i would not . 
  i agree , this is a horrible `` guide '' . 
  old gods and charlemagne for instance - new players should n't even consider these . 
  the game is just fine without them . 
  just start a few games in 1066 . 
  you can still get tog and charlemagne once you 've sunk a few hundred hours into the game . 
  it was also used by the ditmarsians ( in today 's northern germany ) in at least one battle . 
   [ crammed together on a narrow road with no solid ground on which to deploy , the ducal army was unable to make use of its numerical superiority . 
  ** the lightly equipped peasants were familiar with the land and used poles to leap over the ditches . 
  ** most of the ducal soldiers were not killed by enemy arms , but drowned . 
  the conquest attempt was thus repelled .

  the first one looks so good i want to go all gollum on it . 
  here is [ a timeline that clears some things up ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/timeline_of_major_events ) :, 
  the first men invaded westeros and started fighting the cotf around 12,000 years ago . 
  10,000 years ago , both sides came to an agreement and ended their war . 
  this begins the age of heroes ( 10k-8k y.a. ) . 
  the age of heroes ends with the long night ( 8k y.a. 
  ) , during which the others invade . 
  at the end of the long night , bran the builder raises the wall . 
  so one thing is certain : the white walkers already existed * before * the andals invaded . 
  and started fighting both first men and cotf . 
  the cotf are apparently unable or unwilling to create something like the white walkers again , and retreat into the forests beyond the wall . 
  all these dates are somewhat uncertain ( and meant to be ) . 
  one example : the andal invasion may have happened only 2,000 years ago rather than 6,000 years ago . 
  it 's the andals and their maesters who write down history , and they want to give some legitimacy to their kingdoms by claiming that they 've been around for much longer than they may actually have been . 
  and that 's true already on this zoomed-out scale . 
  rivers are also responsible for all the fun [ border irregularieties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/border_irregularities_of_the_united_states#states ) , such as [ this one ] ( http://www.kafalas.com/kentuckybend.png ) or [ this one ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3656/3416251521_d612738b85_z.jpg?zz=1 ) . 
  note that this is not caused by any development in the current conflict . 
  it 's simply because of the german parliament 's resolution that referred to the [ armenian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide ) as such . 
  turkey decided to be petty about it and refused german parlamentarians visits to the german soldiers stationed at the base . 
  germany 's armed forces are somewhat closely controlled by parliament ( not the government ) , so this situation * is * unacceptable . 
  plus , their argument is extremely poor . 
  `` we wo n't talk to x because some of our people already died fighting x '' means that you will never make peace with anyone . 
  i agree that peace talks with isis make no sense , but that 's not because of the `` martyrs of manbij '' . 
  same place as everywhere else : the internet . 
  alternate.de for instance . 
  is there a specific reason for this ? 
  because i can guarantee that the internet offers better prices than any shop for gaming pc hardware , and better advice than most . 
   no way erdogan would be able to explain that away to the domestic audience . 
  since the coup , erdogan has 100 % control of the media . 
  he could explain that these soldiers have gone on a surprise mission to mars , and nobody in turkey would say otherwise . 
   which means more exports than imports . 
  and turkey needs these exports ( and the associated currency ) a lot more than the eu needs the imports . 
  the trade balance does n't show at all for which side the trade is more important . 
  purely sarcastic posts are n't allowed on this subreddit . 
  anyway , the sarcasm would be more effective if there really were many other countries in the world that can compete with german manufacturing . 
  as kyilanci insisted , turkey has a positive trade balance with the eu , so the more important question is whether * turkish * goods can easily be replaced . 
  `` oh yes we soooo need turkish apparel , foodstuffs , and textiles . '', 
  in any case : if you think that turkey is anywhere near as important for the eu 's economy as the eu is for turkey 's , you are completely dillusional . 
  it is . 
  this is actually done in germany ( since ~ 1970 ) and many other countries . 
  glass bottles can be re-used about 50 times , pet bottles about half that often . 
   pet bottles are n't reused as bottles . 
  some of them are , in germany and lots of other countries . 
  reusable plastic bottles in germany look [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/8/8d/1lflasche_frankenbrunnen.jpg ) , they are much thicker and more sturdy than the single-use plastic bottles . 
  [ here 's a direct comparison  ( https://utopia-index.com/0/uploads/15/06/17/1sgpmvkie1ic/670_503_3/150617-cola-vergleich-coca-cola-life-flaschen-u-670x503.jpg ) glass on the left , reusable ( `` mehrweg '' ) pet in the middle , single-use pet on the right .

  it probably protects the men themselves from some ( rarer ) forms of cancer , i.e. 
  anal and penile cancer . 
  more importantly , it protects these men 's female partners . 
  really ? 
  how can they attack these towns ? 
  they are west of al-bab , right next to marea . 
  i do n't think the sdf is anywhere near these places . 
  edit : ah , ok - they captured them from the west , from afrin .
