  that makes sense . 
  with this move , they are trying very hard to be loyal and reliable partners to the sdf . 
  the sdf want to connect the cantons , and the us wants them to do it , because it would tremendously weaken isis . 
  turkey does n't want this to happen , but it 's not really turkey 's business . 
   you had me until your last point . 
  [ i.e. 
  clinton implying that obama might get assassinated . ], 
  want to see [ an epic 10-minute rant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlnfsl130_y ) by msnbc-anchorman keith olbermann ? 
  it 's best not to tangle with him . 
  it 's because nobody thinks that the opposite of `` plumber '' should just be `` normal '' . 
  lots of people think that the opposite of `` trans '' or `` gay '' should just be `` normal '' , and * that 's * insulting to trans or gay people - that 's why they came up with words that actually mean the opposite of `` trans '' or `` gay '' . 
   they would n't be encircled without ramosauh district falling . 
  the government still controls quara hill , right ? 
  if so , aleppo would definitely be under siege if they have taken the entire artillery base . 
  [ 3000 appartments - artillery base - quara - water treatment - cement factory . 
  http://i.imgur.com/dhshwfg.jpg ) that 's enough to definitely stop any movement in and out of the city . 
   fact of the day, 
   if you could take all the bacteria out of your body , they would be enough to fill a large soup can . 
   quote of the day, 
   `` only the pure in heart can make a good soup . '', 
  curiously , they did so on faction demand . 
  azaz is basically guaranteed by turkey . 
  the turks have used heavy artillery bombardment in the area before to stop the kurds from advancing . 
  i do n't think afrin will ever attack azaz directly , since it would needlessly provoke turkey too much . 
   even when they stood up , had assad relinquished some of his family 's powers and made concessions , the revolution would have been stopped in their tracks . 
  he did exactly that with [ the 2012 constitution . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_syria ), 
  right , i misunderstood vaigatto 's post . 
  [ ahem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_bull_of_1356#prince-electors ) - erzbischof , pfalzgraf , markgraf , herzog , and k\u00f6nig , if you please . 
  he has one living brother ( robert ) and two sisters ( maryanne and elizabeth ) . 
  the brother mentioned here ( fred ) died in 1981 . 
  i think an even better subreddit in the this vein is / r/100yearsago . 
  posts news from exactly 100 years ago every day . 
  for instance , august 31 , 1916 : president wilson recalls 15,000 soldiers from mexican border as precaution against railroad strike violence, 
  a fire extinguisher is recommended in all european countries , but only required in a minority . 
  i mean , that 's nice , but it really does n't look like a large demonstration . 
  a few hundred people , and half of them children who have no idea what they are actually doing . 
  i do n't like the turkish invasion , and i hope the sdf stay in manbij , but this little protest should n't sway anybody 's opinion much . 
  if this is about eric andre at the rnc , it does n't fit in this thread at all . 
  googling the phrase gives [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3gff2_wmk ) as the top result . 
   whereas the use of hands and limbs is mostly meant for defense and survival . 
  almost the entire value that our hands offer , we get from using tools , not from using our hands directly , and that was already true for early humans . 
  as far as claws/paws go , bare hands simply suck . 
  being able to better maipulate a tool offers a vastly greater advantage than ambidexterity ever could . 
   ( sorry if i just invented a word . ), 
  which one ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambidexterity ), 
  * witchcraft * was done for centuries almost everywhere in the world as well . 
  obviously , sending messages with drums is * possible * . 
  you need at most two different sounds to send messages of arbitrary complexity , in theory . 
  but how complex do the messages actually get when the drums are used in traditional ways , such as shown in the video ? 
  does it still sound like nothing but music if there 's a long , detailed message encoded in it ? 
  i do n't understand it , so i would like to see it tested and quantified by reliable people under controlled circumstances . 
  i think that 's a much better reaction than `` i do n't understand it , so i 'm just going to believe everything anyone tells me about it . '', 
  i agree with what the others say : ramouseh ca n't be defended against an enemy who holds both the cement factory and the artillery base . 
  ramouseh * looks * like a densely settled urban area on the map , but almost all the buildings have been completely flattened and offer very little cover . 
  if the government holds the coast , damascus , and aleppo , then the war * is * over . 
  if after years of fighting , the biggest accomplishment of the rebels is that they still hold idlib , they are done for . 
  so the question only is if the siege holds this time . 
  but considering that the rebels by their own claims prepared for several months before they started their last offensive , i doubt that they will be able to break the siege again . 
  once the mainstream rebels are out of the picture , isis is no threat to the government . 
  they will slowly be ground to pieces , even if they should have some temporary successes again . 
  so yeah : assad will not take back all of syria - there will be some sort of deal deciding the fate of the kurdish and other sdf-held areas , and assad wo n't ever * take * back any of the areas held by turkish proxies . 
  but if the siege of aleppo holds , the war still is basically over . 
  take the one to bonn hbf . 
  hbf ( tief ) is the subway station just below the regular station . 
  talking about different stations : are you even sure that you want to start at frankfurt hbf ? 
  if you arrive at the airport , the easiest train station to use is `` frankfurt ( m ) flughafen '' . 
  most , but not all trains stop at both of these frankfurt stations . 
  you sound like an awesome big brother . 
  sending your sister to volkshochschule definitely was a horrible move - those are n't actually schools at all , more like evening classes that you take as a hobby . 
  if you can afford it without too much trouble , i think you are right that mis sounds like the best choice . 
  it would put your sister in an academically very stimulating environment where she can make friends in german or english . 
  one problem might be the calendar . 
  the academic year in bavaria starts next week for regular schools , but it already [ started two weeks ago at mis . 
  ] ( http://fluencycontent-schoolwebsite.netdna-ssl.com/filecluster/munichinternational/mainfolder/newa-and-events/calendar/schulkalendar-2016-2017.pdf ) - i hope it 's even still possible to get into this school for the current year . 
  i think that should be possible , as long as you can prove that you will receive a pension that is enough to cover your living expenses . 
  as an american , ( if i understand [ this ] ( https://heimatkunde.boell.de/2014/11/18/visa-fuer-deutschland-wer-kann-sie-bekommen-und-wie ) correctly ) you can simply come to germany without any visa and apply for a permanent residency permit ( `` aufenthaltsgenehmigung '' ) within the first 90 days . 
  if your livelihood is secured , you have a passport , and you 've never been in conflict with german law , it should be granted . 
  that 's how new laws are published officially - at that point , they actually become valid laws . 
  after they have been published , laws are [ organized like this . 
  ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aktuell.html ) - click on any of the letters , and you will see all the federal german laws that start with that letter . 
  laws always have a name and an abbreviation . 
  most of them are known only to the few people for whom the law matters ( e.g. 
  `` stfachangausbv - verordnung \u00fcber die berufsausbildung zum steuerfachangestellten/zur steuerfachangestellten '' - * law on how you can become a tax accountant * or something like that ) , while a few of them are known to the general public . 
  ( e.g. 
  when talking about laws , it is very common to refer to them by the abbreviation . 
  these laws are subdivided into short `` paragraphs '' , which is probably what you mean when you say `` law '' . 
  you might say something like `` dieser betrug ist strafbar nach [ \u00a7 263 stgb ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__263.html ) . '', 
  - `` this deceit is punishable according to section ( `` paragraph '' ) 263 of the criminal code . '', 
   for example closing the game via task manager, 
  you can do that when * not * playing ironman just as well . 
  only difference is that you do n't need to , because you can load an old save without having to crash the game . 
   i recommend castille , because it 's a relatively easy nation, 
  i think castile often ends up having a hard and frustrating early game . 
  when aragon rivals you and allies france , you simply have very little room to expand . 
  this is n't problematic for experienced players , but it can mean a bunch of early-game military defeats for a newbie . 
  sorry you have to go through this . 
  it sounds like you are set to marry your german boyfriend . 
  if that is the case , you can make everything * much * easier by simply going through with it asap .
