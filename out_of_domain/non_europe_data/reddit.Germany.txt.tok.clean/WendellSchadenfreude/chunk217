  just make an appointment at the standesamt . 
  once you 're married to a german , all language classes , medical problems , and appeals do n't matter any more , you will be allowed to stay in germany indefinitely . 
  ( if you want to have a big wedding , have that one later . 
  it 's not uncommon to treat the official wedding as a small administrative act and have a separate big-party-wedding later on . ), 
  if you still need those documents from back home ( this is a rhetorical `` if '' - yes , you will need them ) and they ca n't be sent to you by mail , getting your passport back might also be easier if you get another appointment and show up together with your boyfriend , introducing him as your `` verlobter '' ( fianc\u00e9 ) . 
   they had to infect each orphan in succession because of the long voyage, 
  where can i read more about this ? 
  it 's horrifyingly morbid in such a delightful way , i think i 'm going to talk about this very often for a while . 
  certainly makes * me * nervous . 
  ] ( http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/3-as08-14-2383a.jpg ), 
  this is good advice . 
  do n't panic , op . 
  your case is completely clear - as the wife of a german , you have the right to live in germany . 
  ( there are a few exceptions that quite clearly * do n't * apply to you . 
  as an american , you do n't even need to speak rudimentary german . ), 
  you are probably right that the person you dealt with was hired and trained specifically to deal with refugees , and that 's why they have no idea how to handle your case . 
  make sure to bring your husband 's passport or id to make it clear that he is german . 
  i think i would n't . 
  the first one deals only with * einreise * and visa questions - you do n't want a visum , you want a permanent residence permit . 
  the second one deals with relevant questions and looks good to me , but it 's still just some random homepage and will probably not look that convincing when you bring it as a print-out . 
   i feel like i know the guy completely . 
  i see him so much , i feel like we need to get beers . 
  you know him completely , and yet you want to get beers with him ? 
  trump is a teetotaler . 
  the dutch really are the best at making germans angry . 
  you know exactly what you have to say ; i 'm actually impressed . 
  and angry . 
  i think it 's embarassing that he did n't know what aleppo is , but i do n't care much . 
  when you think about the presidential candidates and the conflict in syria , johnson still seems like the best candidate . 
  think about the worst thing a president johnson might realistically do in the syrian ( or a similar ) conflict . 
  - apparently , it 's that he might look like a bit of a fool until he talks to one of his advisors . 
  i can live with that . 
  hillary might send ground troops to syria , or at least push for regime change by giving massive air support ( disguised as a `` no-fly zone '' ) to opposition groups - possibly even jihadist groups . 
  trump - god knows what he might do . 
  he might nuke damascus , build an alliance with isis , or make rojava a us state ; or he might do just the opposite of all that . 
  i ca n't vote in the election , and if i could , i would n't vote for johnson . 
  but that 's not because he fumbled a question on tv . 
   all of the info i find about visas in general & study courses have exceptions for citizens of the u.s. , canada , japan , & a number of other countries, 
  they do , but those exceptions always work * in your favor * . 
  americans can simply come to germany as tourists and then apply for a longer-term visa * while you are here * . 
  south americans ca n't do that , they have to apply for long-term visa before coming to germany . 
   do you feel that proportional representation has caused instability , political stalemate , and/or frequent elections in your country ? 
  certainly not . 
  germany has been immensely stable with this voting system , with no problematic stalemates and few early elections . 
  although i think a stalemate is possible with our voting system . 
  you just need two parties ( typically one on the left and one on the right ) that are large enough to make coalitions excluding both of them impossible , but extreme enough that nobody wants to work with them . 
  germany at the moment might be moving in that directions . 
  see for instance the [ regional elections in saxony-anhalt in march . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/landtagswahl_in_sachsen-anhalt_2016 ) the success of afd ( right-wing populist party ) and linke ( left-wing populist party ) forced all other parties ( cdu , spd , greens ) into a coalitions - and if the fdp had received just a few votes more ( they landed just below the 5 % - threshold at 4.9 % ) , they would have been needed in that coalition as well . 
   some people in canada have criticized proportional representation for enabling parties with extremist viewpoints to enter parliament and wield disproportionate influence with little support . 
  what do you think about such criticisms ? 
  somewhat true . 
  it 's not even just extremist parties , it 's small parties in general . 
  a small party with some clever politicians can gain a lot of influence in a coalition with only some 5-10 % of the vote . 
  see for instance the fdp : from 1949 until 1998 , they were part of the government ( in changing coalitions ) for longer time than either of the two main parties . 
   how much do the local mps/candidates matter in your system ? 
  i do n't feel qualified to answer this , since i know too little about local politics or my local mps . 
  although i think this is rather typical for voters , so maybe you can say that they do n't matter all that much . 
   do you feel that mmp creates two classes of mps between the constituency and list members , with the list members being inferior ? 
  what do you think about using an open list system to elect the list members ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  even the mps who are elected directly usually depend a lot on their party , since the parties decide which candidate runs in which district . 
  if you go against your party line too often , you might lose your district , and very few mps would stand any chance without the support of their party . 
  one of the very rare exceptions is [ green mp hans-christian str\u00f6bele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans-christian_str%c3%b6bele#member_of_parliament.2c_1998 - ) . 
   how frequently do your mps go against party lines , and what has happened to those that did ? 
  rarely . 
  if they do , it can easily happen that they lose their spot on the party 's candidate list , lose their mandate in the next election , and are never heard of again . 
  there are some mps who go against party lines more often , but that 's typically in cases where they know that the majority is secure , so their dissent is largely symbolic . 
  they do n't get in trouble with their parties for this , because it helps binding some smaller voter groups to the party . 
   do you think the electoral threshold for a party to be elected to parliament in your country is at an appropriate level ? 
  yes . 
  should n't be much higher , at least . 
   are there any substantial groups in your country that want to switch over to fptp ? 
  no , none . 
  the two big parties thought about it for a while in the 60s , but i have never heard anyone argue for fptp in germany in my life . 
  [ wikipedia ( in german ) actually discusses this a bit . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehrheitswahl#deutschland ) introducing fptp in germany would legally be possible , by the way . 
   do you feel that most voters understand how to properly cast their ballot on election day , and comprehend how your electoral system works ? 
  most understand the basics . 
  one vote is the one that really matters - most voters understand this , even though the important one is confusingly the * second * vote ( zweitstimme ) in germany . 
   what has the effect been of a 16 year old voting age in your states which have it that low ? 
  i have never seen an analysis of the effect , and i have n't observed any myself , so i think there is no * huge * effect . 
  overall , i 'd guess it harms conservative parties . 
   has your country ever changed its electoral system before ( even minor changes are welcome as answers ) and if so , did such changes require a referendum to go through ; do you think one is necessary if your country changes its voting system ? 
  legally , i think the voting system could be changed by a simple majority in the bundestag . 
  the law was changed a bit in the '50s , and then again in 2011 and 2013 , but never in major ways .

  is `` the war '' really the correct answer for england ? 
  germany was n't able to bomb england anywhere near as thoroughly as the allies bombed germany . 
  the luftwaffe dropped [ some 40,000 tons of bombs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_blitz#effectiveness_of_bombing ) on england - the raf used more [ than that on berlin alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_berlin_in_world_war_ii ) , and the allies in total used some [ 1.4 million tons of bombs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_bombing_during_world_war_ii#allied_bombing_statistics_1939.e2.80.9345 ) against germany .
