  in london and some other places ( e.g. 
  coventry , hull ) , i can certainly believe that german bombing explains why most houses were built after the war - but is that really true for all the rest of britain as well ?

   in 2007 , as governor , kaine cut off state funding for abstinence-only sex education programs , citing studies which showed that such programs were ineffective , while comprehensive sex education programs were more effective . 
  kaine believes that both abstinence and contraceptives must be taught , and that education should be evidence-based . 
  this is moadamiya , the damascus suburb , right ? 
  that 's a long way to drive .

  for anyone who does n't know the abbreviation :, 
  cessation of hostilities . 
  essentially a truce . 
   and employs directly and indirectly so few people, 
  nice spin , but that 's a * good * thing . 
  providing the same amount of eneergy ( or anything else ) with fewer people than alternative methods means that coal is more * efficient * in this regard . 
  ahrar al-sham are not on the list ? 
  they went a bit back-and-forth about whether they accept the coh . 
  you were talking about employment effects . 
  * more * employees per amount of energy is less efficient . 
  * that * should n't be confusing to anyone . 
  of course satire can have a political agenda . 
  good answer . 
  as an alternative , i would translate `` she 's the best doctor '' as `` sie ist der beste arzt '' . 
  i 'm sure some people think this is old-fashioned , but it does make it clear that you think she 's better than all of the male doctors as well . 
   the totalitarian regime china, 
  should china really be called `` totalitarian '' ? 
  i would n't argue against `` authoritarian '' , but `` totalitarian '' seems like an exaggeration at least .

  if you care about the dating and party scene , i believe you should strike kaiserslautern off the list . 
  i 'm sure it 's a beautiful city , but it 's only 100k people , and the nearby us base means there 's an excess of men . 
  [ edit : [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/geschlechterverteilung_zensus_2011.png ) ( from 2011 ) shows how many men there are per 100 women , ages 18-29 . 
  kaiserslautern is at 127 , wiesbaden and stuttgart are at 87 and 100 . ], 
  stuttgart has 600k people , wiesbaden together with mainz ( just across the river ) almost 500k . 
  between stuttgart and wiesbaden/mainz , i do n't think that 's an easy choice . 
  stuttgart is probably a bit more urban - decide for yourself if that 's a good thing or bad . 
  looking for a place to live , i 'd always start at [ wg-gesucht .

  all kidding aside , `` hyperawareness '' * is * the point . 
  when you hear some religious preacher raging against homosexuals or `` moral decadence '' , it 's great if more and more people hearing it immediately come to the conclusion that he must be some sort of pervert himself , and probably a criminal . 
   the story did not end that well for a few people . 
  i have no idea if that means 2 people got fired , or dozens got vaporized . 
  the best visualization of this that i have ever seen are the animated bubble graphs from gapminder.org . 
  [ this one for instance ] ( https://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majormode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=c$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=1916$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=xcoords;iid=phawcnavuyj1jimakmq1img;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=ycoords;iid=tusegjoqhafugwuvhvy-wla;by=ind$inc_s;univalue=8.21;iid=phawcnavuyj0xoobl_n5taq;by=ind$inc_c;univalue=255;gid=catid0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;datamin=194;datamax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;datamin=7.69;datamax=60$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds= ) : it shows how the number of children per woman has dropped everywhere in the world over the past 100 years as gdps went up .

  i see zero . 
  watch the video to the end , and you 'll see one . 
  ( two if you count her infant daughter . ), 
  if you have a point , try to state it without sarcasm now . 
  i was talking about preachers who rage against homosexuality and `` moral decadence '' , not necessarily about * every * christian figurehead . 
  if people assume these preachers of hate are all perverts and pedophiles , that 's a * good * thing , because it undermines their message of hate . 
  if would be great if we could do the same thing to muslim fanatics , although not necessarily to all muslims . 
  so i think your comparison works , but not the way you used it . 
  if people do n't listen to hate preachers because they think these guys are all perverts , that 's a good thing in my book . 
  you 're comparing these preachers first to muslims , now to mexicans - it 's simply not the same . 
  these men choose to spew prejudice and hatred , and the fewer people listen to them , the better . 
   why should n't families of innocents killed by the us military be compensated for that ? 
  i 'm surprised nobody has replied to the `` innocent '' part , because that 's important - who decides that ? 
  do you think that the us would be treated fairly in front of an iranian or venezolan court ? 
  if every country can be sued in every civil court of every other country , finding one idiotic judge with a personal grudge against a foreign country is enough to start diplomatic trouble . 
  i ca n't understand why this subreddit celebrates intentionally crashing your game .

  nobody is impressed by your `` achievements '' anyway .

  i promised you in 1973 that i would organize this book for you . 
  unfortunately , it took almost two years before i had a chance to acquire it . 
  i happened to meet a student from osnabr\u00fcck in 1974 , and one year after that , she was able to get it via a fellow student from berlin . 
  i had hoped that you would come to germany again sometime , and i would have liked to give you the book in person . 
  too bad that never worked out . 
  i present you with this book as a reminder of the beautiful vacation that i could spend with you ( plural ) , and i hope that it will give you ( singular ) a lot of joy . 
  kind regards to you and maria , and all the best ,,

  edit : buying `` mein kampf '' in germany was apparently quite complicated until 2016 . 
  the book was n't officially banned , but the copyright was held by the state of bavaria , and they did n't allow reprints . 
  the copyright only ran out on january 1st , 2016 . 
  ( the end of the year 70 years after the author 's death . ), 
  very little about wwii itself , but i liked the trilogy by klaus kordon :, 
  die roten matrosen ( `` the red sailors '' , november 1918 , about the revolution at the end of wwi that was sparked by the mutiny of the sailors of the imperial fleet and their march to berlin ), 
  mit dem r\u00fccken zur wand ( `` with their backs to the wall '' , 1932/33 , about the chaotic end of the weimar republic , street battles in berlin , and the nazis ' rise to power ), 
  der erste fr\u00fchling ( `` the first spring '' , 1945 - so this is the only book that is at least partly set in wwii . 
  it 's about the last days of the war in berlin , with hitler youth and old men still fighting the soviets , the occupation of the city and the first months of peace . ), 
  all three books tell history through the eyes of normal people ( mostly teenagers ) who happen to witness important events . 
   \u00d6calan wants peace because he thinks that 's the only way he will get out of prison . 
  is there any chance that \u00d6calan will ever get out of prison ?

  kaiserslautern has [ 6 us bases ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ausl%c3%a4ndische_milit%c3%a4rbasen_in_deutschland#kaiserslautern ) . 
  yet i think all of these bases do n't even matter compared to the massive nearby base at ramstein . 
  there 's 35k us soldiers on that base alone , some [ 50k in the kaiserslautern area ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaiserslautern_military_community ) overall .
