  yes , the kaiserslautern military community really has its own wikipedia page , in german and english . 
  it 's the largest us base outside the us . ), 
  you mean the bahncard 100 ? 
  [ 4090 $ per year . 
  i do n't think the comparison works too well . 
  the japan railpass is for tourists only , while the bahncard 100 is definitely * not * for tourists . 
  it * is * cheaper on a per week basis , though . 
  only thing i know about is [ interrail . 
  i 've used it , but years ago - the rules changed a lot since then . 
  i think it 's still not really a `` period '' of 8 days , but 8 days of your choice over a period of 30 days . 
  that 's pretty decent if you want to travel around the country . 
  stay in city a for a weekend , take a train to city b on monday . 
  ( day 1 ) spend four days in b , then take a train to a nearby village on saturday , spend the day there and take a train to city c in the evening . 
  ( day 2 ) - going on like this , you can do quite a lot of exploring with an interrail pass . 
  it 's not rei ** g ** ning in northern italy , it 's [ ** reining in ** ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rein+in ) northern italy . 
  pretty good . 
  bit too fast overall , but mostly easy to understand . 
  there is a lot of small stuff , of course . 
  starting with the title of the video : if you ca n't use - \u00f6 - , use - oe - instead , not - o - . 
  i think the biggest problem with your pronounciation is that you need to practice the - ch - sounds . 
  you always say either - sch - or - ck - instead . 
  i think [ this video does a pretty good job explaining when to use which - ch - sound and even how to make them . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnfqdlojiz4 ), 
  you also pronounce some e 's like i 's . 
  unfortunately , this is not something you understand , it 's something you have to learn by heart . 
  i love duolingo , but i do n't think it really gets you anywhere . 
  if you really want to learn german , you should absolutely go with the courses . 
  i 'm about 70 % certain that he is making a joke . 
  [ that actually looks tasty . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viqyqka3mnu ) i still think i 'd prefer it a little more done than that , but i really learned something new here ... 
  l\u00fcnenschloss is simply a family name . 
  it seems to be a ( very low-level ) aristocratic family - they are descended from some landed knight named `` jacobus zu l\u00fcnissla '' in the 16th century . 
  there 's actually a homepage [luenenschloss.org ] ( http://www.luenenschloss.org/index.html ) by a guy with the last name who is apparently very much into genealogy and stuff . 
  if you are related , you can contact him via that homepage , i 'm sure he 'd be happy about that . 
  [ this homepage ] ( http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/l%c3%bcnenschlo%c3%9f_ ( familienname \\ ) ) has two maps that show you where in germany the name is common . 
  it 's concentrated quite clearly around the village of neviges , where that landed knight had his manor . 
  the faint `` fhj '' is short for `` fahnenjunker '' , [ cadet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fahnenjunker ) . 
  `` zug '' is * platoon * , the smallest military unit . 
   the place was so filthy there 's no way i 'm returning it any dirtier than it was !, 
  this might be the reason why the previous tenant did n't get his deposit back . 
  anyway : you do n't have to return an apartment or room in the state in which it was when you moved in , you generally have to return it `` besenrein '' - clean swept , without lumps of dirt lying around . 
  it says : `` zoinks !, 
  you 've taken a wrong turn ! '', 
  i would translate this into german as : `` zoinken !, 
  but that just makes for an incredibly dull game . 
  you just stare at the screen watching your colonies grow over centuries , until they finally are big enoug hto break free . 
  can be held legally accountable for this kind of thing * in the future * . 
  it 's not about this ceo , it 's about the next ceo who thinks about setting up a similar system . 
  hillary was by far the most likely 2016 democratic candidate 2 years ago . 
  it 's not that hard to see that * somebody * in the republican party might have prepared something against her . 
  i believe that this really is what it seems to be ( combetta committing a crime in an idiotic way ) , but it 's not that hard to imagine an alternative . 
  true , i did not realize his reddit account was that old . 
  two years ago , he already was n't some `` random it guy '' , but the guy who managed clinton 's email server . 
  if you 're looking for people whose online identity you might want to steal to harm clinton , he would have been one of them . 
  but not 7 years ago . 
  look at my comment again , and you 'll realize that i 'm * not * blaming republicans for this . 
  however , if you think that there was * nobody * in the republican party who prepared some dirt to be used against clinton ( and other likely democratic candidates ) in 2014 , you are a fool . 
  the same goes if you think that * nobody * in the democratic party prepared some stuff against jeb or christie ( though possibly not against trump , who did not look like a likely candidate in 2014 ) . 
  the presidential election is not some highschool beauty pageant ; there are thousands of people who prepare for the campaigns long before they actually start . 
  hiking in germany is so safe that i 'm not even sure if you 're asking ironically . 
  it might just be the safest combination of [ activity ] and [ place ] that you can come up with at all . 
  playing yu-gi-oh indoors in japan might be safer , but barely so . 
  ( 1 ) is good . 
  ( 2 ) does n't work in op 's example , since this is a specific friend . 
  op , just go with `` mein freund '' ( and do n't worry about the possible implication ) , or say the friends name instead : `` peter ist allergisch gegen n\u00fcsse . '', 
  u-s-a !, 
  by air , apparently . 
  `` the unchaste '' indeed . 
  description for the curious : badly charred human remains . 
  the feet still look almost normal , the rest of the body is mostly skeletonized . 
  a ( rather cute ) dog seems to be feeding on the body . 
  from the proportions , i 'd guess the body is that of a teenager . 
  but a brief glance at the description would probably have been better than a thorough look at the image !, 
  there 's a reason they say `` war never changes '' . 
  for an example from the same region , read about the lebanese civil war on wikipedia , and you 'll find that it was just as confusing and violent as this one . 
  it is new that isis is posting its smut directly to the internet . 
  everything else about this war is just same old , same old . 
  this is both advanced racism and advanced stupidity . 
  [ romanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania ) are not the same as [ romani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) . 
  `` thanks ! '', 
  - obama, 
  but only ~ 3 % of all romanians are romani . 
  so even ignoring all de-humanizing language , it 's like you 're insulting the people of [ ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland ) because you are prejudiced against [ irish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) . 
  that would make you an ignorant prick even to other people who do n't like irish travellers . 
  also , `` there '' means `` in a specific place ( in some distance to the speaker ) '' . 
  but in `` there are '' , it suddenly means `` in some completely unspecified place , somewhere in the universe '' . 
  why is that ? 
  this is the same `` it '' that is raining in english when water falls from the sky . 
  sometimes it rains , sometimes it gives apples . 
  i do n't think i 've ever been confused about this in my life . 
  when you 're asking a co-worker if the visitors from berlin will be at the meeting , you 'd only call these people `` sie '' if your co-worker * just * mentioned them . 
  otherwise , you 'd call them `` die berliner '' ( or something ) . 
  if you call them `` sie '' even though nobody mentioned them before , then your co-worker would indeed be confused - but he 'd be just as confused in english , because he has no idea who you 're talking about . 
  ( `` will they be at the meeting too ? '', 
  `` who 's ` they ' ? ), 
  fine - when someone says `` you '' , they might either mean you , or they might mean somebody/anyone . 
  how do you tell the difference ? 
  there are n't nearly enough transpeople for that . 
  are you comparing apples to oranges ? 
  `` die orange '' also is akkusativ , it just looks the same as the nominativ .
