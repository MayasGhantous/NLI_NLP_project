  they just say they do n't . 
  what 's not debated is that the muslims had some presence in ( what today is ) france in the early 8th century . 
  they actually held narbonne until 759 . 
  [ [ it 's also in that article .

   or execute them if you think they 'll be more trouble in the future . 
  why would you do that ? 
  why not just keep them in your dungeon for a few decades ? 
  in a way , that 's the best place for your powerful vasall to be . 
   i 'm 40 hours or so in and restarted about 30 times . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  i do n't mean to critisize your way of playing , i 'm just curious because this is so different from how i play the game . 
  ( everyone should play as they like it , obviously . ), 
  i 've spent ~ 200 hours with the game , and i have n't restarted even once . 
  ( finished * one * game so far , now playing the second . ), 
  in my first game , after having fallen from king of poland to being some insignificant duchess stuck in a partilineal marriage with no heirs of my dynasty , i thought i 'd lose within a few more years . 
  instead , i killed my husband , married anew , and my only son later rose to being emperor of byzantium . 
  starting as a count , it is , of course , quite easy to lose the game within a few short years - it that what happened to you , or do you just restart because you like the early game so much ? 
  `` hello !, 
  my name is inigo montoya .

  i 'll stop here , because you have to make * some * mistakes . 
  `` f\u00fcr sport mache ich x '' is not really a german expression , i 'm not sure what the best alternative would be . 
  `` to hang out '' ca n't be translated 1:1 into german , though you might use the word `` chillen '' if your teacher accepts `` modern '' german . 
  i do n't understand what `` oder jede andere h\u00e4user '' is supposed to mean . 
  are you male or female ? 
  in either case , `` eine koch '' is wrong . 
  only about the `` spa\u00df machen '' : nouns are never `` sehr '' / `` very '' , they can only be `` viel '' / `` much , a lot of '' . 
  german is so much fun . 
  the classic quote on this subreddit in situations like this used to be 1 timothy 5:8 . 
   but if anyone does not provide for his relatives , and especially for members of his household , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever . 
  not what i expected . 
  much better than what i expected . 
  also , i think it 's important to keep in mind how * long * this took . 
  it 's not easy to say when exactly the last common ancestor of chimps and humans lived , but i think scientist agree that it was more than 4 million years ago . 
  `` 4 million years '' - when we just say these words , i do n't think we usually realize how * long * a period that is . 
  ( how much do we have in common with the people who lived only 4 thousand years ago ? 
  ... one thousand times more . 
  seems about right . ), 
  after that , our ancestors ( that we do n't share with chimps anymore ) were n't modern humans right away . 
  homo sapiens has only existed for ~ 250.000 years . 
  that 's still a few million years of homo habilis/ergaster/antecessor ... 
  i think either pope benedict or john paul ii said that the best prayer for any situation is :, 
   thy will be done . 
  ca n't find a source on this , but in any case : if i had to choose a prayer , that one would come right after the litany against fear . 
  funny you should say that . 
  i started by opening more and more new tabs for this , too . 
  then i realized i was n't really gon na read all these clever comments anyway , so i just opened all the following links in the same tab . 
  you still divided `` one nation indivisible '' , albeit only with an unnecessary comma . 
  not good unless it 's made clear that it 's not actually a quotation of marcus aurelius . 
   when pretending to quote someone , always remember that it 's more important what was said than who said it .

  will you have your eyes replaced with meatballs ? 
  tennesseean korea is best korea !, 
  just google `` stupid definition of atheism '' - that actually worked ... 
  that 's at the very least a questionable etymology ; ask wikipedia about it . 
  [ `` snowshoe-netter '' , `` speaker of a foreign language '' ( ! ), 
  are alternative explanations for the root of the word `` eskimo '' ], 
  plot twist : he 's your teacher . 
  as a german who actually got the joke , this makes me * schadenfroh * . 
  `` treppab '' is used very rarely and i think it 's always ironic . 
  it indicates a direction of movement , not a place . 
  * sounds most natural . 
  if you want to use `` unten '' , you have to add `` nach '' : * bring deine socken #nach # unten !, 
  why would he do that ? 
   not sure about the commonwealth thing tho, 
  the commonwealth is basically the former british empire .

  [ native , western germany ], 
  `` schwimmen gehen '' does n't even feel like two verbs to me . 
  same with `` laufen gehen '' , `` klettern gehen '' , but strangely not with `` arbeiten gehen '' - maybe i should think about this a little ... ], 
  sounds completely wrong . 
  - that 's correct . 
  the only reason i can imagine why germans might use a different word order in this example is that some people [ use `` weil '' with a main clause ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/zwiebelfisch-weil-das-ist-ein-nebensatz-a-350013.html ) , so it would be `` ich komme nicht mit , weil ich kann morgen schwimmen gehen . '', 
  - that 's not exactly correct , but not uncommon either . 
  your `` 4 verb '' examples both sound wrong . 
  let me try a different example :, 
   `` i moved to the sea because i wanted to be able to go swimming . '', 
  no alternative word order sounds acceptable to me . 
  same .
