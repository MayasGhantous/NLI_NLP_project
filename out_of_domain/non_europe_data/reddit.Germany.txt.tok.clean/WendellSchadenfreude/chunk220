  [ here 's a table . 
  ] ( http://images.slideplayer.org/9/2646400/slides/slide_4.jpg ), 
  actually , the situation is the same as in english :, 
   in english , the term labyrinth is generally synonymous with maze . 
  as a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological labyrinth , however , many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two . 
  in this specialized usage maze refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction , while a unicursal labyrinth has only a single path to the center . 
  the distinction between a * labyrinth * ( with only a single path ) and an * irrgarten * ( with a complex system of paths ) might be a bit more common in german than it is in english , but most people will also use the words as synonyms . 
  thinking about it some more , i guess it 's just shifted :, 
  in english , maze is the normal word and acceptable for any kind of maze-y thing . 
  labyrinth is an unusual word and only used to specifically refer to the single-path variant . 
  in german , labyrinth is the normal word which can refer to any kind of labyrinth-y thing . 
  irrgarten is a somewhat unusual word and only used to specifically refer to the complex variant . 
  `` good riddance '' might not mean what you think it means , or you 're not thinking clearly about the situation .

  more realistically : to [ gioia tauro .

  even [ civitavecchia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civitavecchia ) is mostly for ferries , cruises , and fishing . 
  i 'm afraid there is n't much else to say about it that the table does n't already say . 
  in german , adjectives that come before a noun have to [ `` agree '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_ ( linguistics \\ ) ) with that noun , meaning they take the same number , gender , and case . 
  you first have to learn the respective endings by heart , and later develop a feeling for them . 
  at least the adjective declination , as you can see from the table , is much easier than that of the article . 
   however , no decisive moves are likely by either side ,, 
  but the rebels are under siege . 
  the government does n't need to make any decisive move - holding the situation as it is will make the rebels become weaker every day . 
  do the rebels in east aleppo allow civilians to leave the area ? 
  does anybody have reliable information on this ? 
  in jedem fall ? 
  yes , pretty easily . 
  make sure you improve relations with enough princes that they support your reforms . 
  whenever you have enough support , just add a chunk of your land to the hre for the ia ( stop at 50 ) and immediately burn it all for the reform . 
  with all the ottoman and russian lands that you can take , this should n't be a problem . 
  seems very fitting . 
  just as a heads-up for any non-natives wondering : the numbering in this image is the reverse of what you would usually use . 
  the `` first line of defense '' should be the one closest to the enemy . 
   after ongoing protests of the policy , a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the nypd 's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens ' constitutional rights . 
  however , the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice , but called for outside oversight and reform .

   just to go down the list , we defend japan , we defend germany , we defend south korea , we defend saudi arabia , we defend countries . 
  they do not pay us . 
  but they should be paying us , because we are providing tremendous service and we 're losing a fortune . 
  that 's why we 're losing -- we 're losing -- we lose on everything . 
  i do n't find that clear at all , but it 's definitely possible .

   i mean , can you imagine , we 're defending saudi arabia ? 
  and with all of the money they have , we 're defending them , and they 're not paying ? 
  all you have to do is speak to them .

  mediafire does n't seem to be working for me . 
  neither of the two questions is answered in the science alert article . 
  this is endearingly naive . 
  pharmaceutical research can cost * billions * of dollars . 
  nobody pays that much purely out of interest . 
  scientists need to eat , whether their results are ultimately patented or not . 
  the research happens * before * the products are patented , so getting rid of patents would n't affect the cost of research at all . 
  it 's healthy to be skeptical of people who use * nothing but * condescension as an argument . 
  but it 's also healthy to reconsider extreme positions from time to time . 
  even ardent critics of pharmaceutical patents ( such as [ bernie sanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prizes_as_an_alternative_to_patents#united_states ) \\ ) do n't want to outlaw patents in general , and they certainly do n't think that expensive research will be conducted ( to the necessary extent ) purely out of interest . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the same in every country on earth that has tax brackets . 
  after searching a bit on google , the only poster that i could find that looks somewhat similar is [ this one ] ( http://www.heute.de/zdf/zdfportal/blob/41396336/1/data.jpg ) , but there 's no knife involved here . 
  did it look anything like this ? 
  this poster was apparently used in the 70 's , when wearing your seatbelt was made mandatory . 
  it might have been re-used in a modified version in the 2000 's .

  unlike lego , your survey seems poorly designed though . 
  when you say you do n't purchase lego , you still have to say who you purchase lego for . 
  and it does n't get clear at all if `` do you purchase lego '' is supposed to be `` do you do so regularly ? '', 
  or `` have you ever ? '', 
  this was n't citizens vs foreign country , it was country vs country ; and it was n't in some court of one of the involved nations , but in a neutral international court . 
   yes , citizens of other countries can sue the us . 
  generally speaking : no , they ca n't . 
  practically all countries in the world accept the idea of [ state immunity . 
   the doctrine and rules of ** state immunity ** concern the protection which a state is given from being sued in the courts of other states .

   also minting the cage they hold people in at the back of their currency is not something i 'm surprised of .

  could be both of you , but yeah : erdogan certainly is confused about a lot of things . 
  as the map shows , the rebels still control some of the buildings , but the saa also controls some - probably more than half . 
   `` oppressing groups '', 
  he said `` opposing '' , not `` oppressing '' . 
  um , yes , why are you quoting this to me ? 
   people in ** opposing groups ** create their own parody/strawman versions of the discussion in order to discredit it ( say , `` trigger warnings are about liberals not wanting their feelings hurt '' ), 
  `` til '' ? 
  did you really just learn the meaning of the word `` minority '' ? 
   the smaller number or part , especially a number or part representing less than half of the whole . 
   [ according to the long war journal , as of mid-2011 , the drone strikes in pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian_casualties_from_us_drone_strikes ), 
  unless you split them up in `` civilians killed in strikes against isis '' and `` civilians killed in strikes against rebels '' , you have to compare them to the total number of militants killed . 
  well , yes , obviously : most civilians are killed when the militants stay in places where there are many civilians around . 
  i do n't think that tells us much ( or anything nefarious ) about the russian airstrikes . 
  that one works ( for now ) . 
  i agree . 
  this is actually a really good example for a mass murder/killing that 's * not * ( part of ) a genocide .
