  the line is often somewhat blurred , but this is clearly not a genocide . 
   he felt he was acting in the best interest of his country . 
  he felt he was abolishing civil rights , starting wars , commiting genocides and killing millions in the best interest of his country . 
  that makes him an evil person , without any doubt . 
   the world community must intervene . 
  how , without killing even more people ? 
  civilians are n't a `` faction '' . 
  those are civilians killed in attacks against isis as well as civilians killed in attacks against rebels . 
  if you count all civilians as one group , you also have to count all militants as one group . 
  there is no consensus . 
  estimates range from about one months to more than a year . 
  we have no idea how airtight that siege is , and we do n't actually know how many people ( militants or civilians ) there are in east aleppo , so it 's basically a guessing game . 
   less than a hundred, 
  technically correct , but i guees that it was even fewer than 10 . 
  the entire `` pocket '' was cleared out within a single day . 
  even just a few dozen fighters should have been able to hold out longer than that . 
  i do n't think anyone can correctly guess the number , but in short : it will be * enough * . 
  if aleppo falls , the mainstream rebels have lost the war . 
  assad then controls damascus , aleppo , and the coast , while the rebels control idlib and not much else . 
  i think the troops would mostly be used in south aleppo ( province ) , to break the siege of fuah and kefraya . 
  but it does n't matter much : with total control over all the syrian core areas , assad 's troops will be on the offensive * everywhere * . 
  by the way , here 's a wikipedia list of [ countries without armed forces . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_without_armed_forces ), 
  she 's wrong , of course , but not * entirely * wrong : [ germany has a very low military budget as a percentage of the gdp . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) to be on the level of france or britain , we 'd need to spend some additional $ 25bn per year , or $ 60bn per year to be on the same level as the us . 
  that 's quite a lot of money , and it certainly benefits germany that we do n't need to spend it on our military . 
  i think the dial of that clock just changes to include other options . 
  `` dentist '' is something you only need for a few hours per year , so that field can probably change to say `` pub '' , `` grocery '' , `` stadium '' , or `` theater '' instead . 
  only the commonly used ones like `` at home '' or `` travelling '' are permanently displayed . 
  was the proclamation of the german empire in versailles really an intentional humiliation ? 
  i thought it only happened there because that 's were all the important leaders of the german states were . 
  they had to be close to the front , because germany was still fighting the french republic and later the paris commune . 
  bismarck had been in versailles since at least october 1870 ( mentioned in the [ german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_von_bismarck#krieg_und_reichsgr.c3.bcndung ) ) negotiating with southern german princes . 
  it was apparently normal for political leaders at the time to be close to the front line - the germans had just taken the french emperor as a pow after his army was defeated at [ sedan in 1870 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_sedan ), 
  it 's natural , but it 's also been sealed in place for a few hundred million years . 
  interesting , but this should n't really matter for crete . 
  if turkish jets enter the airspace over/around crete , it 's a deliberate provocation . 
   albert nobel, 
  and that albert 's name ? 
  was actually [ alfred . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_nobel ), 
   and let the country lead conservative , religious and traditional lives . 
  and let the young people leave the countryside for the cities . 
  this should be the top answer . 
  using anything but a serrated knife on tomatoes is an unnecessary risk . 
  just do an image search for `` tomato knife '' - [ all the results are serrated . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=tomato+knife&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=886&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjh7qqtqsppahujpbqkhcqbc4sq_auibigb ), 
  three months old is almost new in the sense that the knife does n't need actual sharpening , but you should be ** honing ** your knife ideally * every time you use it * . 
  honing is what most people mean when they say sharpening . 
  honing just pushed the edge of the blade back into place , while actual sharpening shaves off part of the blade to create an entirely new edge . 
  [ this link ] ( http://www.thekitchn.com/did-you-know-this-steel-doesnt-actually-sharpen-knives-211855 ) explains it further - although i somewhat dislike linking to it , because they sho cutting a tomato with a non-serrated knife , which is a mistake itself . 
  * new * caramic knives do . 
  be aware that ceramic knives also do n't stay sharp forever . 
   [ suppliers take different approaches on the question of resharpening . 
  one supplier advises against re-sharpening , suggesting that ceramic knives can be considered as limited lifetime disposable items . 
  other suppliers encourage occasional resharpening and provide ceramic-specific diamond-based sharpening appliances which can be costly .

  the red cross did n't raise money `` to build houses '' , they raised money for * disaster relief * . 
  building permanent houses is n't part of that , so i 'm surprised they built any houses at all . 
  the red cross raised 488 millions , [ and here 's how they spent it . 
  ] ( https://embed.widencdn.net/pdf/plus/americanredcross/ptgzfpe2ky/red-cross-projects-and-partnerships-in-haiti.pdf?u=lr3pbf ) biggest items :, 
  contribution to food distribution 29.9 m, 
  domestic heater meals 14.2 m, 
  integrated neighborhood rehabilitation and recovery 18.8 m, 
  there 's also a lot of stuff in there about `` transitional shelter '' , `` progressive shelter '' , but nothing about simply building new , permanent houses . 
  there are some bad charities , but the red cross isnt one of them . 
  there are also some poorly run projects by good charities , and it 's possible that the haiti mission of the red cross was one of them . 
  ( the program cost was close to 70 milion , or ~ 14 % of the grand total . ), 
  but they did ** not ** spend 500 million of 6 houses . 
  do n't feel bad , it 's complete hogwash . 
  your money did some good .

   edit : my mother has investigated the possibility of it being a scam . 
  it is not scam . 
  please stop talking about scams . 
  thank you . 
  how did she investigate it ? 
  because this sounds like a scam and nothing else . 
  here are two articles ( in german ) about scammers pretending to be police officers on the phone . 
  why would the kripo ever call you just to tell you that you are a suspect ? 
  if they really suspected her being a terrorist , that 's the dumbest thing they could possibly do . 
  so , course of action : call the actual police , from a different phone , using a number that you get directly from polizei.bayern.de . 
  tell them about the call , give them the number , ask them for advice . 
  then block the original number , and forget this ever happened . 
   actually , only ~ 1/2 the results are serrated in that search, 
  i 'm only looking at the first ~ 30 results , and * all of them * are serrated . 
  there are a few where you ca n't see it easily , but they still are :, 
  [ this one ] ( http://images.knifecenter.com/knifecenter/boker/images/bo5700a.jpg ) looks the most suspicious , but it 's still serrated according to the comments [ on the site . 
  ] ( https://www.knifecenter.com/item/bo5700/boker-arbolito-5-inch-tomato-knife-black-delrin-handles ) ( i think it 's only part of the edge in this case . ), 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.weapons-universe.com/brands/bench-mark-knives/benchmark-ceramic-tomato-knife-210.jpg ) is [ micro-serrated according to the description . 
  ] ( http://www.weapons-universe.com/brands/bench-mark-knives/benchmark-ceramic-tomato-knife-210.shtml ), 
  they are also all called `` tomato knife '' . 
  ( i ca n't check for one of them , and one more is called `` cheese and tomato knife '' . ), 
  most steak knives are also serrated , so you can easily use them to cut tomatoes - much better than any non-serrated knife . 
  it 's directly from the red cross . 
  it 's probably even true that a lot of money was wasted there . 
  but not nearly a `` 500 million for 6 houses '' lot . 
  and npr certainly never `` went in search '' of the money , or else they woud easily have found most of it .
