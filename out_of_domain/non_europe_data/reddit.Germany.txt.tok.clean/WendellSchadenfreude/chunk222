  but they preferred getting more clicks and views . 
  first ask yourself : how many houses would you * expect * the redd cross to build from disaster relief money ? 
  the answer , in my opinion , is * zero * . 
  you do n't build permanent new houses with disaster relief , you do all that other good stuff that the pdf lists . 
  that alone tells you that the npr article is clickbait garbage . 
  if you 're just hoping to `` get in early '' , you can just as well start your own pyramid . 
  just ask 10 of your friends to give you money , and in return , they get to ask ten of * their * friends to also give you money and to give some money to the original friends . 
  if that sounds like a spectacularly retarded idea , it 's because it is . 
  but that 's how pyramid schemes work . 
  if starting your own pyramid sounds like too much of a hassle , do n't worry : i just started one for you !, 
  so i 'm at level one of wendell 's pyramid , and you have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get in at level two !, 
  just send me money , and you 'll get several times what you paid if only enough people join at the lower levels . 
  pm me for a bitcoin address !, 
  you could actually still join at level two !, 
  apparently , people on reddit do n't want to get rich . 
  but i guess not everybody is a risk-taker like you , / u/cravenj1 . 
  it takes some vision to understand an opportunity like this one . 
  what does she lay on that couch ? 
  also , thier -  their . 
  took me a moment to realize you mean * reddit * gold . 
  but damn , that 's a brilliant idea . 
  * i * should have thought of that !, 
  i 'm in . 
  here 's your gold . 
  i do n't think they mean the entire district . 
  sounds more likely that this is only about the factories at the northern edge of the district , just south of al-kindi hospital . 
  still good progress . 
  other way round . 
  by `` program cost '' , they mean the share of the money that they `` pocketed '' themselves . 
  86 % was used * in * the program , 14 % to pay for having the program . 
  it 's explained in the pdf :, 
   [ program costs ] include things like : i ) salaries , wages and benefits for staff working on our haiti assistance program in the field and at headquarters ; ii ) travel and maintenance costs for all staff working in haiti or traveling related to the program ; iii ) oversight of grants awarded to local ngo or red cross member society to support disaster response ; iv ) accountability , monitoring and evaluation, 
  i think the government is simply using all offensive forces in the area to shrink the pocket as fast as possible . 
  they probably just want to be done with it before some major international development makes things more difficult for them . 
  no , they would n't . 
  what gave you that silly idea ? 
  it 's also pretty brave to talk shit about the clinton foundation while the [ trump foundation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_j._trump_foundation ) is n't even allowed to pretend being a charitable foundation anymore ( in new york , for now ) . 
  scammed ? 
  just wait and see - i 'm gon na get * so much gold * . 
   just last night pence promised that a trump administration would bomb the saa to stop `` atrocities '' in aleppo . 
  i did n't watch the entire debate and almost did n't believe this , but it 's absolutely true :, 
   [ pence  but about aleppo and about syria , i truly do believe that what america ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones , so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas , work with our arab partners , real time , right now , to make that happen . 
   and secondly , i just have to tell you that the provocations by russia need to be met with american strength . 
  and if russia chooses to be involved and continue , i should say , to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in aleppo , ** the united states of america should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the assad regime ** to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in aleppo . 
  it 's only on two specific days of the year , and the crowds are enormous - you 'll have to wait for hours before you get to make your exchange . 
  i once wanted to do this as a child . 
  when we got to the queue , my father simply decided that it was better to throw all the chestnuts away and * buy * the candy rather than spending the entire day waiting in line . 
  you only get a maximum of 5kg of haribo ( for chestnuts ) or 10kg ( for acorns - but 50kg of acorns , that 's * a lot * !, 
  ) , so it 's worth at best [ some 40 $ . 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.de/haribo-phantasia-1-kg-dose/dp/b01519bi28/ref=sr_1_4?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1475741029&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=haribo ), 
  thanks for that - this observation really breaks the illusion . 
  i think they were n't really * lost * , they just evolved into something different : the [ `` brille '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brille ) , which is basically a transparent scale covering the eye . 
  wikipedia claims ( sadly without a source ) that this evolved from a fusion of the upper and lower eyelids . 
  as to why this happened : could be that it gives better protection against dirt getting into the eye ( which would be a common problem when your lifestyle involves slithering through undergrowth ) , or it could be that it simply makes [ moulting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moulting ) easier . 
  it 's in thousands of other men , probably . 
  some of these men might even do it with your daughters one day - and is n't that an uplifting fact !, 
   it makes it harder for nusra to accept the un proposal, 
  but assad would * love * for them to accept that proposal . 
  there 's no easier way for him to finally get back undivided control of aleppo - the rebels simply leave , and he does n't have to spend time and lose soldiers fighting them , does n't have to destroy the city he wants to rule , does n't risk international outrage , might even get some recognition for the fact that he 's willing to let them leave . 
  the title of that second story is fantastic : `` kicking the habit . '', 
   https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sprache_des_nationalsozialismus, 
  i think they mean this area here : http://wikimapia.org/#lang=de&amp;lat=36.163223&amp;lon=37.169323&amp;z=16&amp;m=b&amp;show=/35795024/talet-al-sheikh-sa-eed, 
  looks to me like this is \u00a7 923 :, 
  which is my favorite law , by the way , because section ( 1 ) is a hexameter , and section ( 3 ) rhymes . 
  [ link to the english translation . 
  section 923, 
  boundary tree, 
  ( 1 ) where there is a tree standing on the boundary , the fruits and , if the tree is felled , the tree itself belong to the neighbours in equal shares . 
  ( 2 ) each of the neighbours may require the tree to be removed . 
  the costs of the removal are borne by the neighbours in equal shares . 
  the neighbour who requires the removal , however , must bear the costs alone if the other neighbour waives his right to the tree ; in this case he acquires sole ownership upon the separation . 
  the claim to removal is excluded if the tree serves as a boundary marker and in view of the circumstances can not be replaced by another appropriate boundary marker . 
  ( 3 ) these provisions also apply to a bush standing on the boundary . 
  how does this work again ? 
  ! remindme 24 hours, 
   mosul , kirkuk and erbil must be under iraqi central government rule . 
  these places were not kurdish historically . 
  that 's arguably true for mosul , but kirkuk definitely is [ historically kurdish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirkuk#kurdish_people ) , and erbil is both as historically kurdish as it gets * and * the modern-day capital city of iraqi kurdistan . 
  you just proved that both of these cities were assyrian at some point . 
  i have no problem with that assertion , but it does n't contradict what i said : both cities also were historically kurdish . 
  ( and arbil clearly is kurdish today . ), 
  a city can have belonged to different ethnic groups over the course of its history . 
  this is true for almost all cities in the middle-east . 
  i 'm not even saying that this gives the kurds a claim on kirkuk or any other city . 
  i am saying that history certainly ca n't be used as an argument to * deny * kurdish claims . 
  until 8 pm is definitely ok , but do n't call * at * 8 pm - it 's rude to interrupt the * tagesschau * . 
  later than that , it takes some judgement : if these are actual adults ( 40 + years ) , i would n't call after 8 pm . 
  for students and other young people , calling until around 9:30 seems fine to me . 
  do n't worry about dinner , it 's not like * abendbrot * can get cold . 
  this is a great example for why you always need to watch small kids very closely around water , even if it 's just a tiny pond like this one . 
  there 's a good chance that boy would have drowned in those few inches of water . 
  sorry , but both of your sentences are wrong . 
  it 's `` entschieden '' , not `` entscheidet '' . 
  and even then , the `` das '' never belongs in `` ich habe mich ~ ~ das ~ ~ entschieden '' . 
  leaving out the reflexive pronoun then changes the meaning of the sentence somewhat . 
  `` ich habe das entschieden '' sounds like the answer to `` who decided this ? '', 
  '' ) , while `` ich habe mich entschieden '' sounds like the answer to `` have you decided yet ? '', 
  for the other sentence , i do n't understand the question . 
  you use `` ich finde mich '' when talking about yourself , and `` ich finde '' when talking about something other than yourself . 
  `` ich finde den film sch\u00f6n '' - `` i think the movie is beautiful . '',
