  you might be able to negotiate if you 're willing to buy * a lot * of stuff - things that are past their `` mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum '' obviously did n't sell well before and they sure as hell wo n't sell well now , so the store might be happy to get rid of it all . 
   is this `` fire control '' a phrase meant to imply that they have the ability to observe a given area ( generally speaking ) , and place it under direct fire ? 
  yes . 
  are you serious ?

  this might be in part because you underestimate just how many people there are in the ruhr area . 
  when people say they are from oberhausen ( 200k inhabitants ) , bottrop ( 120k ) , gelsenkirchen ( 260k ) , herne ( 150k ) , m\u00fclheim ( 170k ) - that 's not so different from talking about freiburg ( 220k ) , heilbronn ( 120k ) , or ulm ( 120k ) . 
  but the latter are some `` big cities '' in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , while you 'd consider the former to be small towns near duisburg ( 500k ) , essen ( 600k ) , bochum ( 360k ) , or dortmund ( 600k ) . 
  [ maps ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/ruhr_area-administration.png ) for [ reference ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/karte_baden-wuerttemberg_physisch.png ), 
  the most important thing really is that there are no stereotypes about nrw , because it 's too big and inhomogeneneous . 
  the name is a clue already : the two main regions are the ruhr area and the rhine land . 
  m\u00fcnster however belongs to neither of these two big regions . 
  it 's a student town more than anything else , with a big church and lots of bikes . 
  it 's the capital of its own little region ( the [ m\u00fcnsterland ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%bcnsterland ) ) , but that region is too small for stereotypes about it being well-known . 
  i think it 's mostly quite rural and traditional , apart from the city itself . 
  and just to make it even clearer :, 
  you could also use base 4 ( which is 2 ^ 2 ) , but then you might just stick with base 2 because the difference is n't big enough . 
  it still baffles me that people fail to understand that `` what were you wearing '' is n't asked purely to shift blame to the victim . 
  maybe that used to be the case , and maybe some people still use it that way , but the question absolutely makes sense . 
  the answer shows you how well the person reporting the crime can remember details from around the event , it shows if the story changes over time , and it shows if there are discrepancies within the report or between the report and potential witnesses ' statements .

  [ tardigrades have normal dna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tardigrade#genomes_and_genome_sequencing ) , with the same four acids that every other creature on earth uses to code their genetic information . 
  this is a very strong indicator that they evolved on earth from other earth creatures . 
  it 's * possible * of course , but it seems very unlikely . 
  there 's nothing all that special about the four acids that make up our dna , they probably just happened to be the first ones that ever coded for something self-reproducing . 
  maybe more striking than the four acids themselves is the fact that they code [ for the same proteins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dna_codon_table ) in all living creatures . 
  any living cell that reads the code `` gct '' will produce [ alanine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alanine ) . 
  maybe there is something special about the four dna acids and they form a genetic code more easily than other small molecules ever could - but there is no reason why the genetic code by which they create proteins would be * the same * in an alien world . 
  if tardigrades used dna , but in their dna , `` gct '' meant leucine , `` ctt '' meant glycine and `` cct '' meant some other protein that is n't even mentioned in that codon table , then that would still almost certainly mean they are aliens . 
  but they use the same table as everybody else . 
  [ * ] strictly speaking , it was probably [ rna that first coded for self-reproducing creatures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rna_world ) , and those creatures then came up with a way of storing their fragile rna in the form of the much more robust dna . 
  but that 's not important here . 
  [ see my other comment . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/57sqkn/this_is_a_tardigrade_a_tiny_creature_that_can/d8v2iat ), 
  dna * might * be a universal requirement , but the same [ codon table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dna_codon_table ) would certainly not be . 
  yet all earth creatures use the same three genetic `` letters '' to always mean the same amino acid , and only the same [ 23 amino acids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proteinogenic_amino_acid ) are ever used to produce proteins - even though humans can easily come up with other amino acids that * could * be used . 
  for comparison : imagine that in a far away future where space travel is common , you find a computer on some abandonded space station that looks so strange that it * might * just be alien . 
  but the programs on the computer are written in c++ + - you can now be almost certain that the space station was built using earth technology . 
  from tardigrades ? 
  other tardigrades !, 
  there 's more than [ 1,000 different ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heterotardigrada ) species [ of those guys . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eutardigrade ), 
  other than that , they are probably [ related to arthropods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arthropod ) , but not in the sense that [ one evolved from the other ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tactopoda#phylogeny ) - they only share a `` recent '' common ancestor . 
  ha , the pan-double-spermia theory !, 
  although i 'd argue that this would make them not-alien to us , because it would mean that we share a common ancestor .

  being controversial is actually * good * for an artist most of the time . 
  creates free publicity . 
  i 'm not sure i understand the question . 
  if it 's '' * why * does all life on earth use ( nearly ) the same codon table ? 
  '' , the answer is because all life on earth shares a common ancestor . 
  these most primitive beings ( basically just self-replicating molecules ) happened to read `` act '' as `` threonine '' , and it 's been the same ever since because changing it would n't offer any advantage , but would mean that all the existing proteins no longer work ( i.e. 
  the creature would die instantly ) . 
  ( proteins look something [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/myoglobin.png ) , with the ribbons being long chains of always the same 23 amino acids in different orders . 
  they are self-organizing , i.e. 
  they fold into this specific shape with all of the beautiful ribbons and structures simply because of the molecular attractions between the different amino acids . 
  if you took out all instances of one of the amino acids and replaced them with some other amino acid ( which is what using a different codon table would mean ) , the structure would certainly collapse and you would n't have a working protein . ), 
  life using a different codon table ( or entirely different dna ) has no chance to evolve on earth , because we ( normal-life creatures ) would eat it in the earliest stages . 
  a better love story than twilight . 
  however , it 's tar ** d ** igrade . 
  the `` tard - '' is the same one that you know from the word `` re-tard-ed '' ; it means `` slow '' .
