   however , in south india , it is common for hindu cross cousins to marry , with matrilateral cross-cousin ( mother 's brother 's daughter ) marriages being especially favored . 
  in the region , `` uncle-niece and first-cousin unions are preferential and jointly ** account for some 30 % of marriages ** '' . 
  `` died doing what she loved '' ? 
  i think your post was confusing with regards to the civil war because you claim that it started when `` the last tyrant '' refused peaceful transition of power , but it 's unclear who this `` last tyrant '' is supposed to be . 
  it was the south in general that refused to accept lincoln as preisdent even though he was democratically elected , but i could n't tell you which one person could be considered the tyrant or the trump that started the civil war . 
  neither jefferson davis nor robert e. lee seem to fit very well . 
  it 's baffling , because he handled that question pretty well in the first debate . 
  and it 's really an easy question for a candidate . 
  [ `` if she wins , i will absolutely support her .

  i feel like the people who replied to this all support the idea and are deliberately forgetting one of the most important cons :, 
  if you have a database of all the medical information of all americans , these data * will * be hacked . 
  every medical doctor in the country would need to be able to access this databank , which means that you ca n't keep it safe ( you * ca n't * keep a system safe if tens of thousands of people are supposed to have access to it ) , and there are dozens or hundreds of ( powerful ) parties who 'd be interested in the data . 
  you want your current and future employer to know your entire medical history ? 
  you want the russians to know the detailed medical history of all members of congress ? 
  you want hackers to know every person in the us that ever got a prescription for viagra ? 
  you want religious fanatics to know everyone who ever got an abortion ( even if it happened decades ago ) ? 
  i edited my original post with some examples , possibly after you replied . 
   you want your current and future employer to know your entire medical history ?

  you want religious fanatics to know everyone who ever got an abortion ( even if it happened decades ago ) ? 
  if you want only one example , take the one about abortions . 
  does n't even need hackers : if a person like ted cruz or mike huckabee might become president one day , would it make you feel better or worse knowing that there 's a list of all american women who ever had an abortion ? 
   but the same can be said about a lot of other information such as my credit card info . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i 'm sure there is no national database of everybody 's credit card info . 
  better security is fine , but that means you ca n't have a central database that every doctor can simply access . 
  a system like that systematically ca n't be safe . 
  i did n't even get into cases where people might try to * change * the information stored in such a system - but if every doctor can access a database , you can bet that it would also be possible to fraudulently write in that system . 
  you could store medical information on a card ( similar to an id card ) that everybody gets issued by the state , and all doctors get devices to read and write information on that card . 
  that way , there would be no central database , and illegally reading a card like that would only give you information about this one specific person . 
  this still has some downsites , but i think it removes some of the big ones . 
  it also has the disadvantage that people would lose their cards all the time ; but that would only put them right back at the point where they are now - only their old doctors would still know their medical information . 
  galaxy note 7 . 
  because they think the police wo n't look for a weapon as thoroughly as they might have believed before ? 
  if anything , this may help solving a few murders , because reddit 's murderers get lazy and just drop their murder weapons somewhere on the street , where at least a few of them will be found . 
  i think that `` i might be able to dispose of the murder weapon with less effort than i previously thought '' is an extremely weak motivation . 
  nobody is going to murder people because of that . 
  if anything , the top posts ( telling you how to * properly * dispose of a weapon ) are much more dangerous . 
  he does n't intend to tear up nato . 
  but [ he has implied ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-nato/492341/ ) that the us might not come to the defense of a nato country if that country has n't `` paid the bills '' . 
  mutual defense is * the * core idea of nato , it 's the entire reason for this organization to exist . 
  these remarks are deeply worrying for some american allies . 
  i know their one finger salute is supposed to profess their belief that there is * one * god . 
  so far however , i have seen this kind of salute only from isis , nusra , and other jihadi groups . 
  is this a common gesture in the region , or does it actually say a lot about these men and their world views ? 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm using the right numbers from the article , but it does talk about an `` original price tag '' of $ 370 million . 
  if that was in 1973 , inflation alone means it corresponds to [ $ 2.01 billion in 2016 .

   the core idea of nato is to keep the petrodollar intact . 
  the core idea of nato is mutual defense . 
  nothing else . 
   we are allied with religious bigots who use oil money to oppress their countries . 
  not in nato . 
  you are thinking of saudi-arabia , which has nothing to do with nato . 
  almost all nato countries are absolutely fine democracies ( with some fringe cases like turkey lately ) . 
  and these countries are particularly worried by trump 's comments . 
  look how they were received in poland or the baltic states . 
   instead the one who sneezed has to apologize . 
  fun fact from a german : anybody who expects me to apologize for sneezing can go fuck themselves . 
  but as a person with some allergies , i agree that you should say `` gesundheit '' no more than maybe once per day to anybody . 
  failure to meet the minimum required standards with regards to propriety . 
  my answer was a bit tongue in cheek - `` niveautechnische grenzwertunterschreitung '' is just a deliberately confounded way of saying `` dumb stuff '' . 
  `` niveau '' means `` level '' or `` standard '' , and is commonly used to refer to a standard of intellect or propriety , e.g. 
  `` donald trump hat kein niveau . '', 
  ( hard to translate , something like `` donald trump is uncultured . '' ), 
  '' - technische '' here is a casual way of saying `` with regards to '' , e.g. 
  ( `` with regards to my job , things are looking great right now . '' ), 
  `` grenzwert '' means `` threshold value '' , and `` unterschreitung '' means `` shortfall '' , so combined it 's `` falling short of the minimum limit '' . 
  overall , it 's pretty typical for * die \u00c4rzte * : they say that they are just here to take care of doing nonsense , because somebody has to do it !, 
   no one played soldier after the war, 
  [ of course children still played soldier . 
  ] ( http://www.franken-magazin.net/wp-content/themes/gazetti/timthumb.php?src=http://www.franken-magazin.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bildschirmfoto-2014-09-10-um-20.52.49.png&amp;w=800 ), 
  if you read german , in [ this story ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/kinderspiele-in-der-nachkriegszeit-a-949226.html ) the author recalls how he played `` conquest '' with his friends , a game in which two groups each controlled a ruined building and tried to conquer the other group 's hq by throwing rocks at them . 
  he also talks about playing with old ammunition ( sounds even more dangerous than throwing rocks at each other - i would frown on that so much more than simply playing with helmets ! ), 
  and building their own fake pistols . 
  in [ this story ] ( https://www.braunschweig.de/leben/stadtportraet/stadtteile/mascherode/ereignisse_der_nachkriegszeit_bis_anfang_der_50er.pdf ) , the author recalls how the boys from one village even `` raided '' an abandoned german barracks and played using the old uniforms - which then actually got them in trouble , i.e. 
  some allied soldiers mistook them for actual german resistance fighters and opened fire . 
  this is certainly not a typical story , but the author also describes other , more normal instances of kids playing soldier shortly after the war . 
  maybe it was frowned upon more in the east ( both authors above were from the west ) , but even there , i doubt that frowning will be enough to keep boys from ever playing soldier . 
  chavez was immensely popular , too . 
   bonefied, 
  if just anyone said things this clever and funny to me , i 'd want that person to be my roommate . 
  yeah , that 's the alternative : he might mean bone-ified , i.e. 
  turned into bone .

  offensive in iraq the cavemen from the `` islamic state '', 
  ** in summary : more and more places in iraq and syria are freed from the `` islamic state '' - and always , the liberator find extensive tunnel systems . 
  the laboriously dug labyrinths were apparently designed for a long period of resistance , even in small remote villages . 
  the question now is : what kind of defense systems have the is terrorists built up in the beleaguered city of mossul ? 
  * where the is was expelled , the liberators often find huge tunnel systems under the houses . 
  they show the strict organization of the militia - and they are reason to worry about the battle of mosul . 
  abbas had been looking forward to this day . 
  for the first time in two years and two months , the fugitive registrar of the local administration returned to his village last friday . 
  `` my house was still standing , '' says abbas , who does not want to call his last name . 
  but he can hardly keep the tears . 
  his home at least was not turned into a pale pile of rubble like some neighboring houses , which had been hit by american air strikes in the fight against the `` islamic state '' . 
  but as he approaches house , carefully scurrying behind a kurdish mine clearer , he looks into the void . 
  more precisely : into several door-sized openings , driven by compressed air pumps through the massive natural stone walls , and into a tunnel entrance , the excavation of which fills an entire room .
