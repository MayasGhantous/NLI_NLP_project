  `` what did they do , what did they do with my house , my grandfather built this , what did they do ? '', 
  he is still stunned , while his family collects the still useful belongings and furniture to load them on their pick-up . 
  a few hours later once again , `` at least for a few months '' , left the house that the isis fighters had so thorougly riddled with holes . 
  the village now stands on a labyrinth : the break-throughs continue into the neighboring houses , and the tunnel entrance leads into an underground vein system . 
  it stretches several hundred meters across the village with exits in about a dozen houses , exits hidden under beds and boards , a command center , electricity and water supply as well as storage chambers . 
  all in four to five meters depth under the rocky ground . 
  abbas ' village bas ghardan counts 240 houses and is actually only a district of the village chakuli , about 30 kilometers east of mosul . 
  but the extent and timing of this irrational molework reveal a lot about the military planning capability of the is . 
  the jihadists must have begun shortly after their conquest of the village in august 2014 in order to create such an extensive system of corridors . 
  especially since no jac-hammers , generators or other building materials could be found . 
  the terrorists had probably already taken them away . 
  instead : a mosque hall , which was filled two and a half meters with excavation , except for a sandsack-supported corridor ; a command center for the `` emir '' of the village , which is completely furnished like a room with panels , bed , floor and light switches ; electricity and telephone cables , as well as a water line from the house of the unfortunate official abbas . 
  he had the misfortune to live near the source of the village . 
  since its occupation in the summer two years ago , the small village had been on the front line of the is to the kurdish peschmerga fighters , who regularly fired mortars from a mountain ridge nearby . 
  despite this bombardment , the effort is terrifying with which the is has established itself here , including a communication center , where there are still laminated maps with 66 code numbers for combat situations ( `` 13 - wind report , 27 - suicide attack , 32 - brother is missing '' ) a service plan for the 75-minute shifts of the guards . 
  `` what will this look like in mosul itself ? '', 
  asks atto zibari , the local peschmerga commander , who does not even want come to the village , because even two days after the liberation , it is not quite clear if there aer n't yet a few is men hiding somewhere : `` in mossul , they have probably built subterranean highways , or a large-scale disco . '', 
  hardly anyone can laugh at this joke . 
  too much of what is hidden behind the religious facade of the `` islamic state '' is an immensely organized , strategically thought-out system with the conquered villages turned into underground fortresses . 
  nothing that would indicate too much faith in god . 
  in the iraqi cities of ramadi and sindjar , in syrian manbij , in several villages on either side of the frontier , the invading troops found interspersed , elaborate tunnel systems , sometimes zigzagged , in order to complicate their capture . 
  the is fighters can escape from air raids there , change their positions in ground combat unobserved . 
  wall break-throughs also serve this purpose . 
  from the beginning , the fighters apparently prepared for a long resistance . 
  in bas ghardan , too , there are stockpiles of medicine and gauze bandages as well as food supplies . 
  but in the end , isis barely exploited their options here . 
  `` they could have resisted us much longer . 
  but in the end , it was only a handful of men who stayed behind , and those ended up fighting outside and were shot . 
  most of them , including their leaders , had apparently left before , '' zibari says . 
  in the subterranean command bunker of bas ghardan , the commander 's tea cup was found still half-full . 
  it seems to have been a hasty departure . 
  i do n't know what you should answer , but you should go and listen to a few [ paul panzer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpdsao16m94 ) calls . 
  that 's included in the `` 25 % more '' number . 
  it 's not that americans work 25 % more each day * and * more days per week * and * more weeks per year . 
  it 's that you guys work almost 25 % more overall , due to somewhat longer hours , lower unemployment , later retirement , and fewer vacation days . 
   the study was designed to make it easier to compare countries to each other , by capturing the overall hours per person , not just for people with jobs . 
  that incorporates not just the length of the typical workweek but also retirement , vacation , unemployment , and other time spent out of the workforce . 
   if they were allied to someone , they always helped them when needed . 
  they pretty much abandoned prussia under frederick the great during the seven years ' war , just when england had reached all of her own objectives while prussia was on the brink of collapse . 
   among cohorts born in the late 1900s , males were 1.1 ( 95 % ci 1.1 to 1.2 ) times more likely than females to consume alcohol , 1.2 ( 95 % ci 1.1 to 1.4 ) times more likely to drink alcohol in ways suggestive of problematic use and 1.3 ( 95 % ci 1.2 to 1.3 ) times more likely to experience alcohol-related harms . 
   simpsons was considered offensive only because the right wing family values freaks are very loud and vocal, 
  funny how these perceptions change over time : a german conservative , family-values politician a few years ago lamented that you rarely get to see `` normal '' families on tv anymore , `` except for the simpsons '' .

  `` the economy '' does n't stay the same over decades .

   people told me that i would have an easier time finding a wg if i stayed in a hotel in mainz . 
  people are right . 
  maybe use airbnb ( or couchsurfing ) instead of a hotel , but finding a wg is * much * easier when you are actually there . 
  nobody wants to accept a person they 've never met before as a roommate . 
  i think you got lucky that you got at least one wg to agree to a skype interview - i do n't think many wgs can be bothered to do that . 
  even if there are n't many people interested in a room ( and there usually are ) , your chances are bad if you ca n't show up in person . 
  provided that at least one of the other people is not a total freak , it 's just so much easier and safer to go with that person than with someone you 've never met before . 
  for what it 's worth , i think being french ( are you french , or just staying there at the moment ? ), 
  will actually * increase * your chances once you are there in person , since it automatically makes you interesting . 
  the comparison with the pennsylvania dutch seems mostly appropriate , except for the relationship with technology . 
  swabians have conservative values , but they embrace modern technology . 
  and i do n't just mean in comparison with the penndutch , but in comparison with other germans as well . 
  a famous marketing slogan of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg is `` wir k\u00f6nnen alles .

   if skype is not enough then i shall fly to mainz !, 
  i recommend you fly with swissair , but do n't tell anyone about it !, 
  complaining about something together is a bonding ritual in parts of germany . 
  you should simply have agreed that this is a huge schweinerei and that anst\u00e4ndige leute would never do sowas . 
  yes .

  you 're not harming anybody , and that cross sign is n't used the same way among all christian churches anyway .

  these things would matter to your kids in ~ 20 years - there 's no reason to believe that they 'll still be true then . 
  by the way , adjusted wages in the us are much higher today than they were in the '90s , [ especially if you look at hourly wages . 
  ] ( http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/bn-hy156_bytheh_g_20150417085434.jpg ) so if today is a bad economy to have kids , the '90s must have been absolutely abysmal .

   his 48 % speech, 
   martyred on the other hand is completely neutral, 
  it 's apparently used that way by all parties in this civil war , but the term martyr used to have a very specific meaning : a person who is killed because of their religious beliefs . 
  in this narrow sense , hardly anybody in this war has been a martyr , and a soldier who dies in combat can * never * be a martyr .
