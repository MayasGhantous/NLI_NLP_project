  i downvoted this because i * think * it 's `` old news '' , i.e. 
  from yesterday , and the tfsa retook all these villages quickly and is currently in control of them . 
  so , timeline :, 
  1 ) isis in control of akhtarin + villages ( since around 2014 ), 
  2 ) tfsa takes them ( sometime in october ), 
  3 ) isis retakes them in a surprise raid ( night from monday to tuesday ), 
  4 ) tfsa takes them back a few hours later ( tuesday morning ), 
  this tweet sounds like isis took them * again * after that , but i do n't think that 's what actually happened - please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  [ they do .

  and no matter what happens , she will keep saying that until after the election , because backing down would make her look weak . 
  that does n't mean she actually still believes it . 
  anyway , this is n't about us politics . 
  there are rules in place in democracies that can sometimes trump the ( momentary ) will of the majority . 
  like when [ americans voted for al gore in 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_2000 ) , but bush became president , or when [ more americans voted for democratic rather than than republican representatives in 2012 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_house_of_representatives_elections,_2012 ) , yet they ended up being `` represented '' mostly by republicans . 
  it does n't require any `` floundering '' to insist that parliament get the last word in this question ; especially in the uk with its history of strong [ parliamentary sovereignty .

  would have been better than the name you * actually * chose : [ `` the emirates fa cup '' . 
  also , the best players in the world ( for our american friends : [ cristiano ronaldo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cristiano_ronaldo ) and [ lionel messi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lionel_messi ) ) currently play in spain and show no intention of transfering to england . 
  it does imply that , but i do n't think it 's accurate . 
  i ca n't find actual numbers , but articles that discuss this ( like [ this one ] ( http://www.dw.com/de/arbeitslosenzahl-sinkt-im-oktober-auf-254-millionen/a-36229070 ) ( german ) ) usually only mention that most of the refugees who came to germany in 2015 still are in language or occupational training classes and thus do n't count as unemployed . 
  unemployment numbers are expected to rise slightly when these people enter the statistic . 
  yeah , this post should get a tag `` advisors , not combat troops '' or something similar . 
  can somebody explain to me one thing about this :, 
  where do the `` spare parts '' come from that are used to form the copy of the dna ? 
  one strand goes in , two strands come out - so the proteins have to find a lot of phosphate , sugar , and g , t , c , and a - where do these come from ? 
  are they just floating around everywhere in the cell ( not shown in the video ) and the proteins just grab them `` out of thin air '' , are they part of the proteins that do the copying and tear themselves apart in the process , or are they regularly delivered by other proteins ( e.g. 
  the green blobs that keep flying in and out in that video ) ? 
  but what a shoddy experimental design !, 
  i 'm running a similar experiment , but i take samples daily rather than monthly , and i use triplicate samples ; quintuble on the weekend . 
   indeed , sadat appears to have been behind much of the killing of civilians that erdogan 's media blamed , absent any evidence beyond forced confessions , upon g\u00fclenist coup plotters . 
  i have no trouble believing this , but i also have no trouble believing it to be a crackpot theory - so , are there any sources or evidence for it ? 
   13 % of votes , well above the percentage of just kurds can achieve . 
  the kurds probably make up around 20 % of the population in turkey . 
  ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey#demographics ) ) - it 's just hard to know , because legally every citizen of turkey is a `` turk '' . 
   klassekampen ( norwegian left-leaning newspaper ), 
  i think a newspaper literally called [ class conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/class_conflict ) is a bit more than just `` left-leaning '' . 
  that 's not a deadlift . 
  the dumbbells do n't touch the ground , so there 's nothing `` dead '' about this . 
  ... no it 's not ... 
  i think it 's mostly a rich/poor thing . 
  in poor countries everywhere around the world , there are stray dogs in the streets , and people who treat these dogs poorly . 
  in all rich and well-organized countries , the stray dogs at some point are killed or captured . 
  all the remaining dogs are then somebody 's property and companion , so even if you do n't like dogs , you ca n't just mistreat them anymore . 
  even in poorer european countries , there are at least some stray dogs , and there are people who casually kick them in the streets . 
   metro area : 15 %, 
  the urban area is at 15.9 % ( 10.6 million people ) , the metro area at 18.6 % ( 12.4 million ) . 
  ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris ) ), 
  that sounds more like france . 
  yeah , i did n't want to single out a country , but i mostly know this personally from bulgaria . 
  i imagine it 's very similar to romania in that regard . 
  does n't matter . 
  we do n't care about this specific treaty , we care about the fact that congress clearly stated that the us is not a christian nation . 
  relevant username - this guy has insider knowledge . 
  the one in the middle of hikmah is simply wrong . 
  here 's my attempt at showing all the important locations on an [ elevation map . 
  as you can see , both al-hikmah an the 1070 projects are elevated positions themselves , the hills do n't really overlook them . 
  but getting supplies or reinforcements in and out of the 1070 projects should be difficult for the rebels while the saa controls these hills .

  a german who does n't know what `` abendbrot '' is obviously has no frkin idea who he is . 
  if she 's otherwise eligible , yes . 
  she could also be vice-president * during * her husband 's term . 
  texas is about * twice * the size of germany . 
  texas - 268,581 sq miles ( 696,241 km \u00b2 ), 
  germany - 137,847 sq miles ( 357,168 km \u00b2 ), 
  but yeah , saying that texas is the size of europe is off even more . 
  i thought the saa held much more than that . 
  they are just an area in sw aleppo where there has been a lot of fighting , and there 's more at the moment . 
  it 's one of the positions that the rebels conquered a few months ago when they briefly broke the siege ( after it had just been established ) . 
  eu4 is so funny . 
  here we have a player who just accomplished the impossible , conquering the world as ryukyu , a feat that 99.9 % + of all players ca n't achieve after 1000 + hours - and he just learns something new about the basic user interface of the game . 
   well , why not at least try ? 
  because a world conquest is super tedious and takes forever ( in real life ) if you 're not sure how to proceed . 
  who were you 're earliest few vassal states ? 
  ( by early , i mean roughly up to the point when you vassalized ming . ), 
  who spells `` mic drop '' with an - e ? 
  i think for men it 's much more commonly used as a middle name , though . 
  just a short selection : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_ ( given_name ) #as _ male_middle_name, 
  how do you guys pronounce the `` 1070 '' apartments ? 
  their actual name would be arabic , of course , but how do you pronounce them in english , in your mind at least ? 
  i 've only ever seen the name in writing , and nobody i know offline would even know what i 'm talking about if i asked . 
  i 've always read it as `` thousand-seventy apartments '' .

  if by `` this situation '' you mean specifically the gospel : `` das evangelium nach johannes '' would be just as common as `` das johannes-evangelium '' , and all alternatives ( `` gem\u00e4\u00df '' , `` laut '' , `` zufolge '' ) would be quite rare . 
  no chance for asylum . 
  qualifications do n't matter for asylum , only whether they are victims of political persecution . 
  regular immigration might be possible if your father finds a job in germany , but i do n't think you 're serious enough for me to actually look more into the details of that . 
  you are , by the way , overreacting - and i mean this to sound consoling rather than berating . 
  it might be bad , but it will be ok . 4 years is not forever . 
  i had to check this , it sounded so absurd .
