   prior to five women accusing herman cain of sexual harassment , i predicted he would become the republican nominee . 
  after the accusations , most pundits expect cain to go down in flames . 
  i 'm going to double down and reaffirm my prediction that cain will win the republican nomination . 
  by `` storming '' , they mean `` attacking '' , i suppose ? 
  this seems to be the common usage in this conflict , but i still find it annoying . 
  in a military context , `` storming '' used to mean `` suddenly attacking ** and capturing ** '' . 
  good answer !, 
  op , be aware that this is quite an unusual way of saying `` i miss you '' . 
  `` ich vermisse dich '' or `` du fehlst mir '' would be much more common , and i think even `` ich habe sehnsucht nach dir . '', 
  your own translation is wrong , the sentence with `` vermissen '' would be `` ich habe dich sehr vermisst . '', 
  - but that does n't work with the `` mich '' . 
  granted , the historical basis for * that * is much better than the one for non-christians joining . 
  the ottoman support never really materialized , while catholic france massively intervened on the protestant side in the thirty years ' war . 
   frequently we see the houses jump back to the opposing party during mid-terms . 
  no chance of that for the senate in 2018 . 
  just have a look [ at the map . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_senate_elections,_2018 ) only 8 republican seats are up for election , but 25 for democrats ( or independents caucused with the dems ) . 
  almost all of the republican seats are in safely red states ( texas , wyoming , utah , missouri ) , while the dems have to defend a lot of seats in swing states ( virginia , michigan , wisconsin , florida ) or even deep red states . 
  ( montana , missouri , ... ), 
  not very sad if you stay healthy . 
  very sad indeed if you * need * healthcare and do n't have insurance . 
  fairly certain it would be forcing a pu . 
  iirc , it used to be like that in the early patches . 
  ( and just to be clear : if france wins , there 's no unification/pu . 
  even at 100 ws . ), 
   i actually thought they would start as a vassal of denmark, 
  how dare you !, 
  the proud people of dithmarschen were nobody 's subject !, 
  they still beat the danes in 1500 in the glorious [ battle of hemmingstedt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_hemmingstedt ) , and only were subdued in the last feud of 1559 . 
  ( worst year ever !, 
  also , no english wikipedia page for this war , [ only german . 
  this would be just as it used to be in the first 10 or so patches . 
  just google `` eu4 winning the hundred years war '' , and you 'll find lots of posts and videos about it , like [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/2rjl3a/winning_the_hundred_years_war_as_england_in_192/ ) - [ ( preview picture ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7amfvwb.jpg ) . 
  you are right : when you managed to install a pu over france as england early on , you had basically already `` won '' the game . 
  just need to keep that pu long enough to bring their liberty desire down a bit , then go ahead and conquer the world !, 
  i knew this stuff , but only because my family comes from dithmarschen and i read all about it on wikipedia years ago . 
  in german schools south of hamburg , you 'll never hear the name `` dithmarschen '' . 
  honestly , i 'd just go with `` das macht sinn '' and be done with it . 
  it 's what most germans * actually use * . 
  all the variants are mostly used by elderly people , or by those consciously and for mistaken reasons trying to avoid `` sinn machen '' . 
  if anybody tells you that it 's a misstake or an anglicism , either just smile and nod , or tell them that they are not only foolish pedants , [ but wrong to boot .

  this is n't about evidence , it 's about understanding what happened . 
  why is his car standing in the middle of the intersection , why is he not in his car , and how do they know that he voted for trump ? 
  [ what is a `` potato '' ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2tdbig/tifu_by_enraging_the_parents_of_my_girlfriend_by/ ), 
   `` what 's a quark ? 
  i 've never heard of it ? '', 
  fittingly enough , quark is actually pretty good with potato . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quark_ ( dairy_product ), 
  let me try if i 'm getting this : these are all things that * you * personally favor , right ? 
  it 's not that you would love more gun control and an `` assault weapon ban '' but think that it 's unpopular and costs the democrats votes - you actually do n't like heightened gun control yourself . 
  it 's not that you would love to see more free trade , but you know that preaching protectionism will get more votes - you support left-wing economics yourself , right ? 
  if this is the case , ask yourself : do the democrats really need to do all the things and only the things that would make them more appealing * to you * ? 
  i think you are just projecting your own perspective on the entire nation . 
   `` downloaden '' can be even found in duden , `` sinn machen '' not . 
   the head of a u.n.-backed humanitarian taskforce for syria , jan egeland , told journalists . 
  this is the first time i actually see jan egeland mentioned in a serious article . 
  i only knew him from the [ tribute video a norwegian comedian made about him a few years ago . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn-oemgzleu ), 
  i guess if * he * ca n't achieve a peaceful solution in aleppo , nobody can . 
  but most of these are n't * interesting * at all . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure if there 's * any * open math problem that 's interesting to the general public since the proof of fermat 's last theorem . 
  - if you want to , you can take this as criticism of the public 's lack of interest in maths rather than criticism of maths itself . 
  `` interesting to mathematicians '' is not enough - the top answers in this thread are interesting not only to experts in the respective field . 
   reddit has switched so quickly from being so loudly pro-clinton three days ago to being so pro-trump . 
  thinking that the protesters are fools and that any protesters who did n't vote are double-fools does n't make you pro-trump . 
  these protests just look bad and have no hope of accomplishing anything . 
  what could they even * hope * to accomplish ? 
  trump is the president-elect . 
  accepting that is just the adult thing to do . 
  whether one likes him or not is irrelevant . 
  damn ... the electorate grew by 13 % , so there would have been almost * 160 million * voters if turnout had been the same . 
  40 million people - one in every four - who would have voted in a 2008-like election simply stayed at home . 
   is n't this the 3rd president elect that has lost the popular vote in the past 15 years ? 
  second in the past 16 years , after bush ( in his first term ) . 
  happened before that in 1824 , 1876 , and 1888 . 
  maybe because people do n't understand what exactly the story is here . 
  why is this passport interesting ? 
  what does it tell us ? 
  edit : since i 'm sure i 'm not the only one who did n't get it , here 's my explanation of what this post iss trying to tell us :, 
  - the pmu found a turkish diplomatic passport with some dead isis fighter . 
  - they claimed that this was proof that turkey supported isis by handing out diplomatic passports to isis fighters so that they could travel freely . 
  - it turns out that this passport was actually stolen by isis from a turkish diplomat whom they had taken as a hostage . 
  - turkey was smart enough to cancel the passport when this hostage situation occured , so that isis never would have had a chance to use it , at least not to actually cross an international border . 
  - meaning that this picture does n't prove turkish support for isis at all ; but rather proves the opposite .
