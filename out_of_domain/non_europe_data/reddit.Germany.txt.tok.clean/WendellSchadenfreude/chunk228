  although * seeing * the [ klabautermann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klabautermann ) is always a bad omen , the kobold himself is actually a nice fellow . 
  the little monk [ monaciello ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monaciello ) leads people in need to hidden treasure . 
  in america , bigfoot also does n't appear to be particularly threatening , just shy and blurry . 
  yeah , but if i understand this correctly , it was n't * his * passport , but one stolen from a hostage . 
  - i really do n't understand the story and its implications . 
  i only have some superficial knowledge about this , but iirc :, 
  - if your mother still was a german ( and you can prove it ) when you were born , this should be easy . 
  - if she was n't , you 'll basically have to go through the normal immigration process ; without any dual citizenship . 
  i * think * i understand now - but for god 's sake , why do n't you tell the story so that people can understand it * easily * ? 
  - the pmu found a turkish diplomatic passport with some dead isis fighter . 
  - they claimed that this was proof that turkey supported isis by handing out diplomatic passports to isis fighters so that they could travel freely . 
  - it turns out that this passport was actually stolen by isis from a turkish diplomat whom they had taken as a hostage . 
  - turkey was smart enough to cancel the passport when this hostage situation occured , so that isis never would have had a chance to use it , at least not to actually cross an international border . 
  - meaning that this picture does n't prove turkish support for isis at all ; but rather proves the opposite . 
  is ** that ** the story that this post is trying to tell ? 
  oh yes , santa claus and the easter bunny are also great examples for benevolent western supernatural entities !, 
   she told me that eating lunch with a stranger was an experiment for her psychology class where she was required to break a social norm, 
  that 's an awesome line to remember for when you hit on someone but then realize that you just do n't like them . 
  she really let you down easy , did n't she ? 
  by the way , he probably never said `` bigly '' , but just slaughtered `` big league '' a bit . 
  i do n't know about `` soonly '' , but i ca n't find that on google - only results for `` so only '' . 
   `` we 're with you until you become fascists . 
  and you 're really god damn close to becoming fascist . 
  idiots . 
  watch yourself . '', 
  calm down . 
  the last time you had a republican president with a republican senate and house was under george bush - that was n't pretty , but it was n't anywhere near fascism either . 
  edit : oh , look at that - / germany suddenly likes george bush . 
  or are you folks just too young to remember how * hated * that man was ? 
  or you have n't been paying attention to what actually makes a fascist a fascist , and are just throwing around this term in a way that makes you look uninformed and melodramatic , and is insulting to victims of * actual * fascism . 
  call it fascism when he cancels the 2020 elections , randomly has hundreds of his political opponents arrested , or at least forces all liberal scotus justices to retire . 
  if he does n't , do n't call him a fascist , or you 'll wear out the word . 
   trump got more votes than obama in florida , ohio , north carolina and pennsylvania . 
  not true for ohio and pennsylvania . 
  in ohio , [ obama got 2.94 million votes in 2008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election_in_ohio,_2008 ) and 2.83 in 2012 , trump got 2.77 . 
  in penn , [ obama got 3.27 million votes in 2008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election_in_pennsylvania,_2016 ) and 2.99 in 2012 , trump got 2.91 . 
   already promised that during the election . 
  one zinger in a debate is not a promise . 
  and you deliberately cut of the `` hundreds '' part ; or i really missed something : when did trump claim that he would have hundreds of his political opponents arrested ? 
  source for this , or you 're just lying to yourself because you * want to be upset * . 
  the confused kids who are protesting at the moment are certainly not `` the normal people '' . 
  hell , these protesters are n't even popular * on reddit * . 
  worth around 40 $ . 
  probably no additional `` historic '' value . 
  sorry if this disappoints you . 
   i remember exactly how hated bush was, 
  do you also remember how he was called a fascist ? 
  [ because ] ( http://www.oldamericancentury.org/14pts.htm ) he [ was . 
  ] ( http://newpol.org/content/bush-administration-fascist ), 
  and then he simply stepped down when his term ran out . 
  there are so many bad things one can say about trump that are actually true . 
  but no , better to cry wolf again and call him a fascist . 
   sorry , but popular on reddit is at the moment facists views . 
  but luckily , we have / germany and / de , the last bastions of anti-fascism !, 
  there are people who claim that the word `` fascist '' in english has lost its meaning almost entirely and it now synonymous with `` bully '' or even just `` person i do n't like '' . 
  when i read comment chains like this , i ca n't help but agree . 
  no , those are simply ocean currents like the famous [ gulf stream ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_stream ) . 
  in this case , the [ east australian current . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_australian_current ), 
   like erdogan or trump, 
  erdogan has arrested tens of thousands of people and fired thousands of judges , tens of thousands of teachers and professors . 
  i take no issue at all with calling * him * a fascist . 
  what has trump done or anounced that he will do that comes even remotely close to this ? 
   yeah , because we are germans we have no right to have an opinion about people who show the early behavior of a fascist ? 
  wtf ? 
  do you fucking read what you write ? 
  yes , do you ? 
  because i did not write what you seem to believe i wrote . 
  well , then call him * that * !, 
  `` compulsive liar '' is not the same thing as `` fascist '' . 
   break with the established order ? 
  check . 
  trump just had nice meetings with obama and paul ryan . 
  he 's not breaking with the established order any more than bernie sanders would have done . 
   totalitarian mass movement ? 
  check . 
  excuse me ? 
  * totalitarian * ? 
  even `` mass movement '' does n't describe it very well , but `` totalitarian '' is just making shit up . 
  his anti-elitism is worrying , no objection here . 
  do you think that trump will still be president nine years from today ? 
  i 'm sure he wo n't be , and that alone is almost enough for me to know that he 's not a fascist . 
  ( i still do n't like him , by the way . ), 
  it 's not productive either to yell `` fascism ! '', 
  when exactly * nothing at all * has happened . 
  the vast majority of adult , reasonable americans will accept donald trump as their president , and telling them that this is tolerating fascism will only do harm . 
  i think the rules were updated quite a bit since you last looked at them :, 
   7 ) if your post links to content with a biased or editorialized title , adjust the title so it is presented in a civil and unbiased manner . 
  i have no problem with the title as it is , but editorializing it to something like `` civilians return to 1070 projects after saa/hezbollah retook the area '' would be accepted and actually encouraged in this subreddit . 
  and then there 's also [ this t-rex ] ( http://geekologie.com/2009/10/19/pangeasaurus.jpg ) that you get from moving south america on top of africa . 
  there is no question that there really was a young man who was killed and then run over with a tank . 
  as sigurdz corrected himself , `` staged '' would have been a better word than `` faked '' . 
  the point is that it might not have been iraqi soldiers who did this to an isis fighter , but isis fighters * pretending * to be iraqi soldiers who did it to god-knows-who-that-poor-kid-was . 
  good luck to you . 
  there are times in our lives for each of us when we need to focus on ourselves first . 
  nobody can blame you for this . 
   i ca n't even find a single reference to the alleged `` deer run '' mercury spill . 
  i think he 's talking about the [ doe run company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doe_run_company ) , the largest producer of lead in america . 
  doe rather than deer , and lead rather than mercury . 
  `` sure , i 'll fix it , just give me a second . '',
