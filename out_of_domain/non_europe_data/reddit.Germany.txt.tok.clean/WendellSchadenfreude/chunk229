  `` there , that should do it . 
  i just had to remotely regarble the gribblers and add some extra ram . 
  let me know if the issue persists . '', 
  it is not the healthy who need a doctor , but the sick . 
  the part of it that 's a famous painting is only louis xiv himself , but he 's placed in front of a different background . 
  the [ original painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/louis_xiv_of_france.jpg ) is set indoors . 
  one of them , the [ german reform party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reform_party ) ( * deutsche reformpartei * ) was originally literally called the antisemitic people 's party ( * antisemitische volkspartei * ) . 
  antisemitism was the foundation of their entire program . 
  the way the word is used in europe , it should n't have surprised them . 
  directly from cdu.de :, 
  the cdu has always seen itself as a party for liberals ( as well as conservatives and christian-democrats ) . 
  \u00c4h ... 
  i 'm not sure if this guide is still completely up-to-date , but it explains the direct-inheritance mechanic pretty well . 
  [ chapter 3 ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/guide-to-royal-marriages-personal-unions-and-claim-throne.788829/ ), 
  central points : direct inheritance can only happen when the country is in [ `` tier 1 '' ] ( http://forumcontent.paradoxplaza.com/public/144045/tiers.jpg ) , which is only 5 % of the time . 
  if the country is in t1 while the old ruler dies without an heir , the following happens :, 
  - local noble succeeds, 
  - b ) every other cases ( rm & no dynasty / no rm & dynasty / rm & dynasty ) :, 
  - strongest successor will inherit if her number of provinces  = junior 's nop * 2 and junior 's nop < = 15, 
  - 2nd strongest successor will inherit if her number of provinces  = junior 's nop * 2 and junior 's nop < = 15, 
  - succession war between them if neither qualifies for the above ( even if there are more rm partners with enough nop ), 
  - not enough nop and no valid contestants exist -  pu, 
  - not enough nop and valid contestant exists -  sw between successor and contestant, 
  just to make sure you see it :, 
  [ this guide ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/guide-to-royal-marriages-personal-unions-and-claim-throne.788829/ ) in the paradox forums explains what happened and why it 's so rare . 
  ( look at chapter 3 ), 
  he 's also * legally * qualified for a cabinet position . 
  but he does n't think even think himself that he 's * actually * qualified for one . 
  yet being president would apparently have been easier . 
  this [ wikipedia list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_animals_with_fraudulent_diplomas ) contains seven cats and six dogs that achieved diplomas in a variety of disciplines . 
  wikipedia judges them all to be `` fraudulent '' , but i think they are just biased against non-humans . 
  my favorite one is dr. zoe d. katze . 
   dr. zoe d. katze ( `` zoe the cat '' in german ) was a housecat owned by steve k. d. eichel . 
  around 2001 , eichel was able to obtain several well-known hypnotherapy certifications for his cat . 
  the ease with which dr. katze obtained these credentials became the subject of an article by the american bar association and a news report by cbs news . 
  the certification of dr. katze has been cited in several books and articles on credentialing scams , and has appeared in psychology and forensic curricula . 
  eichel also served as the consultant to the bbc investigation that ultimately led to the certification of george the cat by various uk hypnosis associations . 
  the outside wall of a house is still a * wand * . 
   from a pretty dodgy institution, 
  * doggy * . 
  the word you 're looking for is * doggy * , not * dodgy * . 
  i do n't think the official iraqi armed forces will do much . 
  they might even want to make a point of showing that they stop right at the border , because that 's the border between two countries that isis tried to tear down . 
  but there will definitely be thousands of volunteers entering syria , and tons of weapons , ammo , and supplies via semi-official channels . 
  and these highly motivated fighters will be willing to go anywhere the syrian government needs them . 
   was there a man dismay 'd ? 
   not tho ' the soldier knew, 
   some one had blunder 'd :, 
  can somebody `` translate '' these lines into modern english prose for me ? 
  ah , ok . now it makes sense . 
  thank you !, 
   i do n't see that happening anytime soon, 
  why not ? 
  ( serious question ), 
  religious reasons ? 
  bad historic experiences ? 
  personal aversion by assad ? 
  that 's because you shoot videos with your phone 's camera , not with the screen . 
  that 's actually the most fucked-up part of the video . 
  the kid looks to be 12 at most , and he 's clearly carrying an ak . 
  [ like this song ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pln8obi_ek ), 
  the song is sung by many clubs . 
  now do one for new guinea !, 
   because of the time depth of its inhabitation and its highly fractured landscape , an unusually high number of languages are spoken on the island , with some 1,000 languages ( a figure higher than that of most continents ) having been catalogued out of an estimated worldwide pre-columbian total of more than 7,000 currently spoken human languages according to ethnologue . 
  donald trump is batman ? 
  that 's actually the video i was looking for when i found kirpy !, 
  that would make sure that nobody who actually knows their shit will ever work for the government again . 
  there are democrats and republicans right now who will become members of congress in 2018 or 2020 . 
  i hope these people have intelligent advisors who are experts in their fields . 
  you apparently want to make sure that they will have to cut all contact immediately after they are elected . 
  tom brady simply is * not * known in most countries . 
  uhm , why not ? 
  if you just extrapolate from the dates on your map , that sounds realistic . 
  they took a lot of land on november 14-16 , so why not again on nov 17 , 18 , and 19 ? 
  it would be great progress , but not completely implausible . 
   i do have an answering machine . 
  make sure you have an adult message on that answering machine . 
  not `` whassup , this is yan !, 
  say what you want after the beep , bitches !, 
  '' , but `` this is [ first name ] [ last name ] 's phone . 
  i 'm not home now , but i check this answering machine regularly . 
  if you leave a message and your number , i 'll call you back ! '', 
   i 'm unsure with surplus you mean, 
  the one in [ the federal budget . 
  germany ran a deficit every year since 1970 , with the federal debt increasing on average by 2.7 % of the gdp each year . 
  under merkel , there was a surplus in 2014 and again in 2015 , and there [ probably will be in 2016 . 
   he would be a lame duck president, 
  why would he ? 
  johnson was n't a lame duck during his first term . 
  president is president ; the idea of a `` mandate '' for anything is overrated . 
  after all , trump does n't have the mandate of the popular vote either , he just happens to be president regardless of that . 
  did fillon ever actually talk about an `` alliance with assad '' ? 
  while he 's certainly a lot friendlier toward the syrian government than hollande , this sounds like an exaggeration/oversimplification . 
  he 's leading , and has been endorsed by sarkozy , who came in third . 
  fillon 's chances of becoming president are better than hillary 's ever were . 
  merkel is all but guaranteed to remain in office . 
   since when did local cops become private armies for oil companies ... 
  the earliest example i could find with a quick search was the [ bayonne refinery strike in 1915 .
