  a fascinating event . 
  here are some headlines from the ny times :, 
  [ july 20  ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9d0ce1d81038e633a25753c2a9619c946496d6cf&amp;legacy=true ) 5,000 standard men may join in strike ; closing of bayonne oil plant might cause shortage of supply for the allies .

  [ july 27 ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9e01efd61038e633a25754c2a9619c946496d6cf&amp;legacy=true ) : sheriff captures police for strike ; invades jersey city and swears in surprised officials as bayonne deputies . 
  [ july 29 ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9800e1df133fe233a2575ac2a9619c946496d6cf&amp;legacy=true ) : kinkead arrests 99 strike guards ; winding up trouble in bayonne , he seizes armed men at tidewater plant . 
  [ july 30 ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9f04eedf133fe233a25753c3a9619c946496d6cf&amp;legacy=true ) : another oil striker dies . 
  ; fourth fatality resulting from rioting in bayonne . 
  this is really nothing new . 
  if you do n't limit yourself specifically to oil companies , you can easily find lots of dramatic examples from the 19th century . 
  i always understood that this was your point , and i think it 's a good one . 
  you did however make it more complicated by bringing up tywin , who is not a pov character . 
  people with this phobia actually are reincarnations of the noblemen who were executed during the french revolution . 
  the lower class revolutionaries early on were even called [ `` sans-culottes '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sans-culottes ) ( `` without breeches '' ) because they wore pants instead of the [ * culotte * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culottes ) that was fashionable among the nobility . 
  not wearing pants was what gave away your noble status and lead to your death in an earlier life ; that 's the origin of your nightmares !, 
  how 's his wife holding up ? 
  i think this is the meanest thing i 've ever seen anybody do on reddit . 
  also , fascinating sub . 
  lies !, 
  exactly , this is quite important . 
  in some cultures ( e.g. 
  in arab countries ) you are supposed to leave something on your plate to show that your host was generous and served more food than you could possibly eat . 
  in germany , that would be considered wasteful . 
  eat your plate , or there wo n't be sunshine tomorrow !, 
  ha , certainly not !, 
  also from the guardian :, 
  [ how bush 's grandfather helped hitler 's rise to power ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar ), 
  i think this present article is completely tame . 
  it 's just an article about the historically interesting family background of the president-elect . 
  it 's no different from articles about [ obama 's family in kenya ] ( https://face2faceafrica.com/article/video-young-barack-obama-meeting-family-kenya-will-melt-heart ) . 
  schau dir einfach mal breitbart 's `` establishment conservative 's guide to the alt-right '' an . 
  typen wie die in dem video werden in diesem artikel beschrieben als '' ** the worst dregs of human society ** : anti-semites , white supremacists , and other members of the stormfront set . '', 
   einen der prominentesten figuren der alt-right, 
  ich habe schon anderswo hier im thread zitiert , was auf breitbart im `` establishment conservative 's guide to the alt-right '' \u00fcber typen wie die in dem video gesagt wird : `` the worst dregs of human society : anti-semites , white supremacists , and other members of the stormfront set . '', 
  because there is n't open farmland between their lines , but the major city of al-bab , still held by isis . 
  they would connect the cantons if they could , with no regard for turkey 's opinion . 
  alas , they ca n't . 
  fastest is to have +1 everywhere and + ( highest possible ) in one siege . 
  one artillery with every sieging army , all leftover arty sieging the same fort , with your best siege general . 
  in an already occupied province adjacent to some other siege , keep a 1-regiment army ready to transfer your siege general to the next siege as quickly as possible . 
  not a dumb question at all , but a fascinating one !, 
  however , the water never actually got `` that high '' , the ground in that region was simply lower at some point . 
  the large mountain regions on earth are generally formed where two tectonic plates converge , i.e. 
  move against each other . 
  [ like this . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/mountain_by_reverse_fault.gif ), 
  the most impressive example is the himalaya , which was formed when [ india crashed into asia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/himalaya-formation.gif ) at an impressive speed of maybe up to 15 cm per year . 
  india is still slowly moving northwards today , and the himalaya continues to rise because of this . 
  because of this , you can actually find seashells in the highest mountain regions of the himalayas - these creatures lived there millions of years ago , and the mountains had not been formed yet . 
   democrats also won the most votes in the senate , and it 's looking like they won the most votes in the house , too . 
  the article you linked to does n't say that about the house , and i do n't think it 's correct . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_house_of_representatives_elections,_2016 ) the republicans won the house with 61 million votes against 58 million for the democrats . 
   well dems are quite clearly not accepting the election results, 
  the vast majority are . 
  since my comments are the only ones left standing , i 'll have to reply to myself to ask : what happened ? 
  i felt like this was an overall pretty civil discussion , and while `` the other side '' was obviously wrong on all counts , i still think it was educational . 
  me neither . 
  and just to be clear : that 's 10 minutes * walking * distance . 
  nope . 
  even just the eu is 4,324,782 km \u00b2 ( 1,669,808 sq mi ) , more than six times the size of texas . 
  ( 696,241 km \u00b2 or 268,581 sq mi ), 
  although texas is still bigger ( by area ) than any individual eu country . 
   how do you guys function all speaking different languages . 
  95 % of the time , we talk in english if we are from countries with different languages . 
  i 'm german , and i speak * some * swedish , * some * french , * some * spanish - but when i meet someone from sweden , france , or spain , i always talk to them in english . 
  they do that in scandinavia , and it 's really good for both the babies ( who like the snug feeling of being under their blankets in a comfy stroller in the cold ) and the parents ( who get some peace and quiet and can actually have adult conversations ) . 
  unfortunately , europeans outside of scandinavia would be shocked to see this and would likely call child protection services immediately . 
  green rebels , red syrian army ( saa ) , yellow the kurdish enclave of sheikh masood ( loosely allied with the saa ) . 
  it 's very much just a joke . 
  dithmarschen was governed for a while ( 1447-1559 ) by a college of 48 `` judges '' who were appointed for life . 
  i say `` appointed '' rather than `` elected '' , because while there was some kind of election process , only the rich landowners had any say in it . 
  these landowners were still technically `` peasants '' , so you can justify calling the system a `` peasant republic '' , although this does n't mean that every farmhand and laborer suddenly was entitled to rights and participation . 
  if you 're wondering about the most important feature of `` communist '' systems : there was no public ownership of the means of production ( i.e. 
  the land ) . 
  so , no communism . 
  still : the system was surprisingly modern for the time . 
  who needs a feudal overlord anyway ? 
  source : am dithmarscher . 
  also , [ german wikipedia . 
   can you say folkist in english ? 
  you can apparently use [ `` folkish '' ] (, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folkish ) to translate `` v\u00f6lkisch '' , although it usually means [ something else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folk_culture ) . 
  i guess you could say that , but i do n't like it . 
  i think it invokes wrong ideas about dithmarschen . 
  in a plutocracy , the ruling class in my opinion would consist of some kind of traders or merchants , while they were all landowners in dithmarschen . 
  also , there 's some at least hypothetical social mobility implied in the word `` plutocracy '' - you can simply become rich somehow , and then you 're a member of the ruling class . 
  in dithmarschen , being rich alone would probably not have helped you much , unless you managed to marry into one of the landowning families . 
   now look at all the plastic piled up in the oceans making all that heat . 
  i believe that is our biggest source of global warming right now, 
  that belief is flat out wrong . 
  plastics floating in the ocean do not contribute to global warming ; they do n't generate any heat at all . 
  ( they are bad for other reasons . ), 
  no , they were not aristocrats . 
  just the peasants with the biggest tracts of land . 
  and they * did * elect their college of 48 judges and established a rule of law . 
  by the standards of the 15th century , that 's pretty damn progressive , so do n't judge them too harshly .
