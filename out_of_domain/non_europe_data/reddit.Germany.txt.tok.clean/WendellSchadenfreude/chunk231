  i 'm not sure i understand the question . 
  solar covers on a pool prevent the loss of heat from evaporation . 
  there are a few rivers or lakes where plastic garbage covers the surface in a [ somewhat similar way ] ( http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/ht/p2/2016/09/24/pictures/sector-137-garbage_1bda91ba-81c2-11e6-a0d9-e435f3f63e15.jpg ) , but those are small areas . 
  water in the oceans generally does n't form anything near a closed layer on top of the water . 
  look at the descriptions in the wikipedia article about the [ `` great pacific garbage patch '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_pacific_garbage_patch ) : `` there are no islands of trash ; it is more akin to a diffuse soup of plastic floating in our oceans . '', 
  even if there * were * `` islands of trash '' , these would likely have a * cooling * effect , because the surface of plastic garbage is usually brighter than the surface of the ocean and would thus reflect more sunlight . 
  that 's a poll and not a model . 
  and they clearly were wrong besides . 
  their last poll before the election showed trump [ leading the popular vote by 5 % , 48-43 . 
  ] ( http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-last-flurry-of-polls-provides-data-on-1478436452-htmlstory.html ) in reality , clinton won the popular vote by almost [ 2 % , 48-46 .3 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_2016 ), 
  the la times/usc poll was a great poll , they absolutely did good work - but only because they were very transparent about their methods and data . 
  in the article linked above , they even discuss a re-weighted version of their own poll which showed clinton leading the popular vote by 1 % - much closer than their own `` official '' version . 
   but after 2 elections where they had the closest results , i think there 's something in it . 
  but they were not close at all . 
  as i wrote , they had trump at +5 rather than -2 , so they were off by 7 points - that 's as wrong as if they had predicted a 9-point clinton landslide victory !, 
  almost every other poll was closer to the truth . 
  most had clinton at +4 , which is off by only ~ 2 points . 
   that 'd be great if the popular vote decided the election . 
  they predicted the popular vote , so that 's what i 'm looking at . 
  if they had predicted `` clinton +2 , but trump still wins the electoral college '' , i 'd be * really * impressed . 
  but they predicted trump to win the popular vote by +5 , so they were far worse than almost any other poll . 
  538 clearly took trump serious as well . 
  28 % serious , with 10.5 % for the result that actually happened : winning the electoral college despite losing the popular vote . 
  i 'm not defending the huffpost 's fantasies . 
  i 'm just telling you that 538 's forecast was clearly better than the la times ' . 
  the popular vote margin 538 predicted was off by only 1.9 points ( -3.6 predicted , -1.7 in reality ) , while the la times was off by almost 7 points . 
  and as for the electoral college : you can see the map that the la times predicted [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-last-flurry-of-polls-provides-data-on-1478436452-htmlstory.html ) they even gave clinton arizona and ohio , unlike 538 . 
  but let me repeat : their poll was really good for it 's transparency . 
  but the weightings that they used were obviously very wrong ; they even say so themselves . 
   yet western media did n't report it ?

  how do you get the idea that western media is n't reporting this ?

   to be fair the germans did literally deny the namibian genocide until 2015 in a very similar way, 
  not in a very similar way . 
  nobody in germany would have been outraged if you talked about it . 
  some few people argue ( d ) that it should n't be called a `` genocide '' , but most germans simply do n't have an opinion on this . 
  the namibian genocide is vastly less important for german history than the armenian genocide is for turkish history , for several reasons :, 
  - 100k people died , instead of 1.5 million . 
  - it happened half a world away from germany , rather than right in the middle of the country . 
  - namibia was only a german colony for another ~ 10 years , and has had very little connection with germany in the ~ 90 years since then . 
  western armenia/eastern anatolia has been part of turkey ever since the genocide . 
   yes , but that is on top of all of the genocide history in germany . 
  but nobody denies * that * . 
  geography absolutely matters : germans simply do n't think about namibia very often . 
  turks think about anatolia * all the time * . 
  first check the next field . 
  there often are two fields on forms , which confusingly can be either, 
  [ name ] and [ vorname ] ** or **, 
  [ name ] and [ nachname ] . 
  if there 's no second field , i 'd write both . 
  if there 's no room for both , i 'd write my last name only . 
  ( maybe first name only if you 're under 16 years old . ), 
   russia ( ussr ) have shot down 11 us airplanes over foreign soil since the formation of nato, 
  interesting - i 've never heard about this before . 
  [ wikipedia has a list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air-to-air_combat_losses_between_the_soviet_union_and_the_united_states ) . 
  - last time this happened was in 1970 though . 
  i like the russian people . 
  politically , i do n't trust russia much , and i do n't trust putin at all . 
  it 's despicable how russia maintains frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova , and what they 're doing in ukraine is downright criminal . 
  russian influence in western countries is usually harmful ; and russia 's neighbors ( particularly in the baltics ) are right to feel threatened by her . 
  in syria however , i think that putin is supporting the right side . 
  while for-profit prisons are a generally terrible idea , reddit likes to exaggerate their importance . 
  [ only about 9 % of inmates in the us are housed in privately operated prisons . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_prison#development_3 ), 
  debating ukraine is not allowed in this sub ; so i wo n't . 
  in any case , you might want to ask yourself : if your view is that all the people you do n't like are nazis and glorify nazis - is your view all that realistic ? 
  ( i do n't think like that about russia . ), 
  this comment is * never * the answer to anything . 
  it 's a starting point at best . 
  if you take `` it 's not all black and white '' as an answer , you actually understand the world less than people who only see black an white - because you just reduced the world from being at least black and white to being only grey . 
  i think it 's really sweet . 
  and no matter how long i watch it : it never goes bad . 
  link to the [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/1007/ ) . 
  i read 1q84 because people i respect and admire praised murakami so much , and i ended up deeply disappointed . 
  i gave murakami a second try with kafka on the shore , and was just as disappointed , and in pretty much the same way . 
  both books start out great and create a mysterious , suspenseful atmosphere i really enjoyed . 
  great prose , great settings , interesting characters . 
  then a lot of strange , but fascinating stuff happens that makes you want to keep reading to find out what this is all about - but in the end , you do n't . 
  nothing is explained , everything just keeps getting stranger , and then the book ends . 
  i know all books do n't have to be the same , and i know some people enjoy murakami a lot ; that 's fine by me . 
  but if what bothered you about 1q84 was similar to what i describe , i do n't think you 'll enjoy kafka ots . 
  i was pretty convinced to give up murakami for good . 
  these comments here make me think that i might give it one more try at some point and read norwegian wood . 
  that 's an exaggerated expectation unless you live in a very special area . 
  the ipcc expects global sea levels to rise by an average of somewhere between 0.26 m and 0.82 m until 2100 . 
  ( [ source , pdf , page 15 ] ( https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/unfccc/cop19/3_gregory13sbsta.pdf ) ), 
  in the next `` ten to twenty years '' , sea levels are expected to rise by less than 20cm ( ~ 8 '' ) . 
  sea level rise is worrying and will cause a lot of trouble in some regions ( e.g. 
  but your `` guarantee '' might just make people not believe you when they see that most houses along sea are still there and doing just fine by 2030 . 
  in this case , it 's easy : the corner kick was clearly awarded before the 5-minute mark , maybe around 4:50 minutes . 
  the corner kick is thus still carried out , no matter how long it takes to prepare . 
  after the corner kick , if the other team had managed to simply kick the ball away high and far , the referee would have ended the game immediately .
