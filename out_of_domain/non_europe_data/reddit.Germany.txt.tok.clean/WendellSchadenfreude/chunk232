  methane fires look [ just like regular fires .

  methanol is a liquid very similar to ethanol ( = drinking alkohol ) , but it burns much slower and with a hardly visible flame . 
  these are n't * my * predictions , they are the predictions of the ipcc . 
  if you propose scenarios that go far beyond them , you are on a level with the people who deny them in the other direction - the `` climate sceptics '' . 
  the maldives are one of the `` very special areas '' i mentioned , but even there most houses will * not * be gone within 25 years . 
  ( tsunamis notwithstanding . ), 
   the absence of an illegal , unjustified military intervention is not evidence of caring for a peaceful outcome . 
  of course not . 
  but it 's clear evidence that the west 's n \u00b0 1 goal was * not * the extinction of the syrian government , as you claimed earlier . 
  i agree , it 's simply are different situation . 
  the areas under government control do n't need un aid and never asked for it . 
  they are n't under siege , they are able to feed themselves . 
  there 's nothing nefarious about the un not sending them food . 
  i would have thought that they mean the same thing in german , too , but [ `` instandhaltung '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/instandhaltung ) apparently is a more comprehensive term that also includes `` instandsetzung '' , i.e. 
  repairs and restoration . 
  mexiko . 
  if for nothing else , then definitely to find out what op 's reference is about !, 
  also , because there 's only one of you , and the world is lucky to have you . 
  [ that picture ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/czbglgbxcaarken.jpg ) somewhat dampens my mood . 
  all these boys in the picture - they are so young , they probably do n't even remember what peace is . 
  they should get to simply stay in aleppo , but instead their fathers will force them to go to idlib , and thus risk their lives again . 
  but they are going deeper into the ground . 
  ventilation tubes should go up towards the surface , should n't they ? 
   syrian army liberate hawsh shalaq near mayda'ani in east ghouta , damascus, 
  seems like a [ place with rather ill-defined borders .

  you 're not thinking straight . 
  telling surrounded enemy fighters that their only options are surrender or death is the norm , not something unusually cruel or outrageous . 
  that looks quite comfy , and the location is great . 
  you think i 'd legally be allowed to live in there ? 
  behold , the glorious joseon ( korean ) victory against the japanese at [ myeongnyang in 1597 !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_myeongnyang ), 
  13 joseon ships against 130 ( or possibly up to 330 ) japanese ships . 
  end result : no ships lost on the joseon side . 
  at least 30 japanese ships destroyed , half of the japanese soldiers dead . 
  shut up , shut up , shut aaap !, 
   their so called new creation ( it has a specific arabic name , but i ca n't remember it ) . 
  [ bid ` ah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bid%e2%80%98ah ) ? 
   linguistically the term means `` innovation , novelty , heretical doctrine , heresy '' . 
  who invented it ? 
  it 's mentioned , albeit briefly , in the same article . 
   mr colville also said there had been reports that rebel groups were preventing people from fleeing to safety , and were `` using civilians as pawns '' . 
   because there was fraud, 
  not ( necessarily ) fraud , just incompetence that * might * have enabled fraud . 
  almost definitely [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/flag_of_syria.svg ) and [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/flag_of_syria_2011%2c_observed.svg ) . 
  the former is the offical flag of the syrian arab republic ( i.e. 
  the country ruled by assad ) , the latter is used by some of the opposition groups fighting against assad , e.g. 
  by the syrian '' [ national coalition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_coalition_for_syrian_revolutionary_and_opposition_forces ) '' . 
  which flag you want to use basically shows which side you support in the civil war . 
  i 'm afraid there are n't really any neutral symbols for syria at the moment . 
  in case you are worried : the hardcore jihadi groups in syria mostly use neither of these flags . 
  some of them might use the green three-star flag ( or are at least allied to the people who use it ) , but they mostly stick to black banners with white arabic writing on them or vice versa . 
   / r/the _ schulz will become an independent subreddit . 
  if you count the siege of a city as an `` urban battle '' , then it was n't . 
  the [ siege of candia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_candia ) in the 17th century lasted for 21 years . 
  in modern history and using `` urban battle '' in a more narrow sense , i ca n't think of a longer one . 
  i downvoted it because the link does n't show what the title claims . 
  there are gruesome photos , but nothing that suggests executions , let alone mass executions . 
  all the people shown in the pictures could have died fighting ; the badly burned ones almost certainly died in airstrikes . 
  it 's possible that government forces have executed some rebel fighters in aleppo . 
  but these pictures are in no way proof of it . 
  ( polen ! ), 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/at-will_employment ), 
  you do n't need heavy machinery to clean away rubble . 
  it 's easily [ done by hand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tr%c3%bcmmerfrau ) , and labor is cheap in syria . 
   from a sub i can not link, 
  uhm ... could i get a link to that subreddit , please ? 
  i promise i 'll claim i got it somewhere else . 
  if they integrate it , will it become `` provencal canada 's provence '' ? 
  i 'm guessing doing this by hand has indeed become harder since ferroconcrete is nowadays used much more often than simple bricks . 
  still , the destruction in syria - however bad it may be - is nowhere near as thorough and comprehensive as [ it was in germany ] ( https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2011/10/world-war-ii-the-fall-of-nazi-germany/w20_95490389/main_1200.jpg?1420519036 ) ( and other european countries ) after ww2 . 
  clearing away the rubbe should n't be a major problem , except maybe in areas where you have to expect ied everywhere . 
  and it 's not like syria will suddenly have no constrcution machinery after the war . 
   is n't western infrastructure wood based through . 
  no , that 's just ( most ) american suburbs . 
  cities in central europe were made mostly of stone already before ww2 ( with [ some exceptions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timber_framing#half-timbering ) ) . 
  just google `` german cities after ww2 '' for some impressions .

  this is such a ridiculous non-story that they unfortunately want to repeat every four years with the new report . 
  these reports are compiled by a cooperation of several ministeries . 
  there obviously are a lot of passages that are added or deleted in the process . 
  there 's nothing nefarious about that . 
  the only problem is that the preliminary versions of the report are leaked , and the media pretend that every change between that version and the final one was done to hide some ugly truth . 
  i wish the media would discuss the numbers in the actual report , not this absurd circus . 
  i 've written scientific reports in cooperation with scientists from other institutions . 
  i assure you that there are several drafts , and passages get deleted between drafts . 
  this does n't just happen with every government report , but with every complicated text ever written . 
  franz ferdinand was n't some ambassador whose name noone had ever heard before , he was the nephew of the emperor ( who had no living sons ) and heir presumptive of the austrian-hungarian empire . 
  that would be more like killing both putin 's daughters and his prime minister . 
  and then some . 
  i agree . 
  but at least it lead me to a quick google search on whether a retractable bollard * can * stop a truck at all . 
  turns out that it can .

  so yeah - i guess we 'll be seeing a lot more of those in our cities in the near future . 
  the jigsaw puzzle was also invented in london . 
  and not only did it happen during the timeline of eu4 , around 1760 , but it was invented by a guy [ who loved staring at maps so much that he made a game out of it .
