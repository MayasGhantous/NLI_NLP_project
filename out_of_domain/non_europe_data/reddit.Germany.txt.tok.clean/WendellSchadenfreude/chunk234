  that 's where the atoms went . 
  [ small sketch for illustration . 
   a 2:1 masters degree, 
  can someone explain to the non-american what that means ? 
  most likely : vd leyen would have ordered the pilots to shoot the plane down , the pilots would have done so , and there would have been a lenghty investigation afterwards that would have ended with nobody being legally punished due to [ '' \u00dcbergesetzlicher notstand '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%9cbergesetzlicher_notstand ) - `` extralegal/supralegal state of emergency '' . 
   killing people is unlawful, 
  exactly . 
  that 's why the constitutional court ruled that * the law * ca n't say that it 's ok ; and why politicians or the military would still ( despite the lack of a law ) decide that it * is * in this scenario . 
  that 's why it 's called * \u00fcbergesetzlich * after all - you ca n't make a law about it , but you can still do it . 
  i 'm pretty convinced that this is what would happen - otherwise , why would they send up the fighter planes in the first place ? 
   so , you are saying that despite the constitutional court ruled `` shooting down an aircraft with innocent people '' can not be allowed by law , some ( who , exactly ? ), 
  can order it , b/c it 's '' \u00fcbergesetzlich '' ... and ( maybe ) get away with it ? 
  yes . 
  and i 'm quite content with this . 
  it 's so dumb it hurts . 
  i 'm proud of you . 
   russia wo n't accept any proposal that implies that crimea is not a part of russia, 
  true . 
   anything else and current goverment would be labeled as traitors and overthrown . 
  silly exaggeration . 
  putin could cede st. petersburg and nobody could simply overthrow him . 
   enlisted personnel disproportionally come from poor , rural , mostly white areas ( trump country ), 
  this is absolutely not true . 
  source : the heritage foundation 's report [ `` who serves in the u.s. military ? 
  the demographics of enlisted troops and officers '' ] ( http://www.heritage.org/defense/report/who-serves-the-us-military-the-demographics-enlisted-troops-and-officers ) - quotes :, 
  u.s. military service disproportionately attracts enlisted personnel and officers who ** do not come from disadvantaged backgrounds ** . 
  previous heritage foundation research demonstrated that the quality of enlisted troops has increased since the start of the iraq war . 
  this report demonstrates that the same is true of the officer corps . 
  members of the all-volunteer military are ** significantly more likely to come from high-income neighborhoods than from low-income neighborhoods ** . 
  only 11 percent of enlisted recruits in 2007 came from the poorest one-fifth ( quintile ) of neighborhoods , while 25 percent came from the wealthiest quintile . 
  these trends are even more pronounced in the army reserve officer training corps ( rotc ) program , in which 40 percent of enrollees come from the wealthiest neighborhoods-a number that has increased substantially over the past four years . 
  ** american soldiers are more educated than their peers . 
  ** a little more than 1 percent of enlisted personnel lack a high school degree , compared to 21 percent of men 18-24 years old , and 95 percent of officer accessions have at least a bachelor 's degree . 
  contrary to conventional wisdom , minorities are not overrepresented in military service . 
  ** enlisted troops are somewhat more likely to be white or black than their non-military peers . 
  ** whites are proportionately represented in the officer corps , and blacks are overrepresented , but their rate of overrepresentation has declined each year from 2004 to 2007 . 
  new recruits are also disproportionately likely to come from the south , which is in line with the history of southern military tradition . 
  i hope that you were simply misinformed yourself and not deliberately spreading untruths . 
  if that is the case , i suggest that you edit your comment to prevent more people from reading these `` alternative facts '' . 
   when you have workers that look like they belong there carrying out things , people do n't question it if it happens through the normal working hours . 
  i have just the subreddit for you :, 
  / r/actlikeyoubelong /, 
  one thing i want to add that i have n't seen come up in the replies so far : the turkish government actively tries to prevent turks in germany from assimilating into german society . 
  see the wikipedia article on [ ditib ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish-islamic_union_for_religious_affairs ) for some details . 
  in short : turkey sends hundreds of imams to germany , usually for a short period of time , so that turks in germany are indoctrinated in turkish by turkish government officials who have no knowledge of germany at all . 
  and ditib is just part of the turkish efforts to keep turks in germany turkish forever . 
  are the `` hitler finds out '' videos still relevant ? 
  because in [ `` the downfall of grammar '' ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f8fbrujjivw ) , you can see hitler struggling with the fact that there is no german word for `` grammar nazi '' . 
  obama was highly qualified . 
  no phd , but he * taught * constitutional law and was president of * harvard law review * . 
  as a legitimate scientist myself : nope . 
  i do n't think scientists are generally more qualified for government than smart non-scientists are . 
  i thought most es rebels * are * idlib rebels who just relocated via turkey . 
  thing is : if you want to establish a dictatorship , i doubt that you 'll let a slight majority of the people stop you . 
  i 'm sure there 'll be hundreds of anatolian villages where erdogan 's enabling act gets 5000 votes out of the 350 people living there . 
  if you 're looking for a high-quality polandball comic about germany , [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3nkhm3/the_greatest_enemy/ ) is my favorite by far . 
  that looks fantastic . 
  it does n't matter how they count part-time employees as long as they have n't * changed * the way they do it . 
  most of the statements in the second group can be answered with one simply fact : this was al-qaeda-controlled territory . 
   so far there has been zero physical or photographic evidence of a single rebel chemical munition or `` chemical weapons warehouse , '' whether intact , destroyed , or compromised . 
  of course not , this is aq territory . 
  if they have chemical weapons facilities , they wo n't simply let people take pictures . 
   all victims were pro-opposition . 
  i do n't know why you would even claim this . 
  the victims were * civilians * , they were n't on anybody 's side . 
  but also : this is opposition territory . 
  people who are openly pro-regime would be killed . 
   all eyewitnesses accuse the regime of committing a chemical weapons attack . 
  this is aq territory . 
  saying anything other than that into a camera would be a good way to get murdered . 
  for now , i think that a regime attack with chemical weapons is the most likely explanation for this incident . 
  but your arguments still do n't sound very convincing to me . 
  wer sich selbst ein bild davon machen kann , kann gut auf youtube mit videos wie [ diesem hier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58arqir882w ) ( \u00fcber die `` gender wage gap '' ) anfangen . 
  this sentence is grammatically correct , but it sounds somewhat contrived . 
  `` wo haben sie deutsch gelernt '' or `` woher k\u00f6nnen sie deutsch '' would be normal , natural-sounding sentences . 
  your sentence in english would be something like `` where did you learn how to speak german '' , instead of more natural questions like : `` where did you learn german ? '', 
  correct , but it does sound like a machine talking . 
  does the sdf in the area still get regular air support by the usaf ? 
   the gap between rich and poor is widening dramatically . 
  the gini coefficient for germany ( 30.1 ) is almost the same as that for france ( 29.2 ) , and it 's also almost the same as it was 10 years ago . 
  ( 2007 : 30.4 ) ( data from [ eurostat ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_di12 ) . ), 
  germans do praise the * savoir vivre * of the french . 
  we identify this with france so much that we use the word in french , even though according to wikipedia , it 's not even used the same way in france . 
  ( we do n't mean good manners , we mean the art of living a relaxed , happy life . ), 
  speaking about the economy : the grass * is * greener in germany . 
  the german economy is doing exceptionally well , and has been doing so for years . 
  unemployment is low and [ has been low for almost a decade . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v0gibwh.png ) even the global financial crisis of 2007/2008 did n't affect germany all that much . 
  one decade of hearing about how great the german economy is feels like a long time , and you 're probably too young to remember , but the german economy was doing quite poorly ~ 15 years ago . 
  a lot of praise for germany 's current economic success is due to former chancellor schr\u00f6der 's [ `` agenda 2010 '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) reforms , even though his own party does n't want to hear it . 
   white house reporter for seven years, 
  point of fairness : seven years is not a long time . 
  that means they saw obama and nobody else - and not even obama 's first year . 
   al qaeda members were caught in turkey with sarin, 
  your source does n't say that . 
   cos said unknown chemical materials were found during the raids and sent away for investigation . 
  he ** denied ** media reports that a small amount of the nerve agent sarin had been uncovered . 
  it 's not that i 'd refuse to believe the initial newspaper reports , but qualifying them as `` fact '' is a bit much . 
   in the middle east, 
  nigeria , south sudan , and somalia are not part of the middle east .
