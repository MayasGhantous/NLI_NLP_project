  here 's a [ brilliant 10-minute talk by hans rosling that is extremely relevant for you . 
  ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth ), 
  most important point : if you want to stop population growth in poor countries , you * first * have to bring them out of poverty . 
  education and prosperity have been followed by birth control , family planning , and stagnating populations everywhere . 
  the population of africa * will * double in the next 30 years , and there 's nothing ( short of a devastating pandemia or nuclear war ) that can change that . 
  if we want to prevent further population growth ( and further starvation ) after that , we must end the extreme poverty in some african countries . 
  if human kindness is n't reason enough for you , there 's a more selfish reason you might agree with . 
  if we * do n't * help the poor people of today , their grandchildren might vastly outnumber ours , and that would n't go well .

  the western middle class life certainly is not the `` saddest thing ever '' . 
  my definition of poverty in this context is the one used by rosling in his talk : people who are struggling to buy a ( first ! ), 
  pair of shoes . 
  middle class westerners do n't have more kids mostly because they * do n't want to * . 
  just like the middle classes everywhere else in the world . 
  it costs less to raise kids when you do n't buy them shoes . 
  seriously : pull yourself together . 
  there are people in the world who have it * much * harder than you or i do . 
  let me give you one more selfish argument that might convice you to change your despicable stance . 
  i have a * big * libertarian streak . 
  i 'm all for small government and laissez-faire economics . 
  i should be your ally politically . 
  but when i listen to extremists who want to commit unprecedented genocide by starvation , all i can think of is how happy i am that governments force people like you to still feed other people 's kids , whether you like it or not . 
  i will avoid being politically associated with you as much as i can . 
  so , maybe just tone down the social darwinism a bit , for purely political reasons . 
   leading to even more mouths to feed . 
  * not * helping people out of poverty leads to ever higher populations . 
   qui bono, 
  if you mean `` who benefits '' , it should be * cui bono * .

  the romans had a word for this : [ saeculum .

  you can still fix the loo . 
  boy , you do n't have a clue . 
  that was my first thought as well , but i 'm pretty sure now it 's supposed to be gills . 
  in theory : yes . 
  in reality : not a chance in hell , for at least the next 100 years . 
  that second video does n't seem to exist anymore - do you maybe have another link ? 
  if you love a great singleplayer campaign : yes . 
  if you 're more about multiplayer : yes . 
  i think that 's an accurate assessment . 
  the short answer would be `` true '' , since the clintons in fact `` do n't take a salary from this work , and they do n't receive any other direct monetary benefit . '', 
  they rate it as only `` mostly true '' because it does bring the clintons good pr that this charitable foundation has their name on it , and this could be construed as a `` personal benefit '' . 
  as mentioned in the very next sentence by politifacts : `` other clinton foundation leaders take home six-figure salaries , according to tax documents . '', 
  they also have [ this picture ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6ececy923qb7ye893ycmupfajrqkt2fy9l7mej7npqvneoxydasiiym2lzjylu6vyejp7qxbi1oeftcbn0b3-bt7t_thcfj1ijig8xyou-94g0zfewsvht153-bnqtcgaig2wcyh ) showing the tax documents with the compensation for individual board members .

  when you start your post with a number followed by a dot , reddit annoyingly thinks that you 're starting a list , and insists that all lists should start with `` 1 '' , so it turns whatever number you 've written into a 1 . 
  to change that , put a \\ between the number and the dot . 
  it does n't show up in the final post ; only let 's reddit know that the dot should be ignored in formatting the post .

  but why would you post a video of cruz making a fool of himself ? 
  here 's the data cruz is talking about , and i even highlighted what he calls [ `` the pause '' . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vnyueh0.png ) in short : it does n't exist . 
  your video , by the way , is from 2015 . 
  as it turned out , 2015 was globally the warmest year in recent history by quite a clear margin . 
  and then 2016 was warmer still . 
  read more about it [ on wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_warming_hiatus ), 
  i find it rather telling that you do n't even try to defend what cruz said ( because it 's indefensible ) , but simply jump to a completely unrelated dataset . 
  the vostok ice cores , from which the graph you posted is constructed , are really nice in that they illustrate that temperature and co2 are closely correlated . 
  ( this would be expected from the physical properties of co2 anyway , but it 's nice to have this record . ), 
  [ here 's the graph you posted with co2 added . 
  the problem with graphs over hundreds of thousands of years is that they make it impossible to see the very recent past - you ca n't even see where exactly they end . 
  [ this graph makes it easier ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/carbon_dioxide_400kyr.png ) - just look at the cyan and black parts for the co2 concentration . 
  co2 concentrations are already higher than they were during any of your ice age/warm age cycles , and still rising quickly . 
  also keep in mind that data from 100,000 years ago clearly are n't as reliable as data from 2016 . 
  and most importantly : please keep in mind that * i hope you are right * , and global warming will be no problem . 
  but i do n't think so . 
  damn , that 's what i wanted to ask , too .

  at the very least , these `` clones '' would still receive an entirely new x chromosome from their mothers , would n't they ? 
   modifies the corresponding genes in the other parent 's chromosomes, 
  i get that , but that 's my point : the x chromosome inherited from the mother does n't have a corresponding x chromosome from the father , only a much smaller y chomosome . 
  if i understand this correctly , you could only end up with lots of kids who are much closer related to you than your kids usually would be , but not actually clones . 
   every genetic trait that makes you you, 
  but my sons will each have an x chromosome . 
  they will get that x chromosome from their mother , because i have to pass on my y chromosome to them ( or else they would n't be sons ) . 
  even if i were somehow genetically modified to make sure that all my genetic traits become dominant , i do n't see how this could affect traits that are coded for on the x chromosome , except for the few ones that are also coded for on the ( much smaller ) y chromosome . 
  a child that get 's all of its genetic information from me would have to be a daughter - but being a different sex , that child could hardly be considered my clone .
