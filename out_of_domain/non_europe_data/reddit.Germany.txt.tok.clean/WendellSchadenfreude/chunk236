  it sounds like sanders is making a comment on one very specific aspect of the country ( income equality ) , not endorsing the entire system . 
  i 'd like to read the comment in the original context , but the link that should provide it is dead . 
  whithout context , i think it 's dishonest to claim that sanders endorsed the chavez system based on this quote . 
   likely op just mistyped it . 
  there are apparently people whose name is actually [ spelled cl\u00f6e . 
  does n't make any sense if it 's supposed to be chlo\u00eb , but still - it might have been her parents who `` mistyped '' the name , not her boyfriend . 
  tru\u00eb l\u00f6ve . 
  i was n't talking about trump , so leave him out of this . 
  i was asking about the context in which sanders talked favorably about one aspect of chavism , to find out if he ever endorsed ( part of ) that ideology . 
  as it stands , i do n't think he ever did . 
   using the dictionary we found that aerolite was invented in 1815 . 
  i ca n't even find a source for this , which makes the story even better . 
  even searching directly for `` aerolite * and * 1815 '' , the best source i can find is [ this one ] ( http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/category/?id=6735&amp;page=1 ) , which i believe only wants to say that the word `` aerolite '' ( for a type of meteorite ) was first used around 1815 . 
  i 'm fairly certain you had exactly a [ million-to-one chance . 
  ] ( https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/million-to-one_chance ), 
  which still does n't translate well to `` population '' . 
   the 1974 ceasefire line is widely recognized as the border by everyone except ( you guessed it ) syria . 
  you are misinformed . 
  [ quoting wikipedia  (, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golan_heights#u.s._position ), 
  the united states ** considers the golan heights to be syrian territory held under israeli occupation ** subject to negotiation and israeli withdrawal . 
  the united states considers the application of israeli law to the golan heights to be a violation of international law , both the fourth geneva convention 's prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force and united nations security council resolution 242 . 
   i mean , if human right just means `` government cant deny access '' , then guns are a human right, 
  how would that follow ? 
  governments around the globe regularly deny access to guns ; and they do so in accordance with the laws . 
  even the us government does , to some extent . 
   we are as `` at war '' with russia as is possible in the nuclear age . 
  that 's just a silly exaggeration . 
  both the us and russia could e.g. 
  massively escalate things in syria or ukraine . 
   you could also say that russia is trying to regain some kind of influence to counter us influence in eastern europe . 
  but the people of eastern europe do n't * want * to live under this russian `` influence '' again . 
  eu and nato are n't aggressively taking over anybody 's territory . 
  they only expand when a country wants to join them , and the main motivation for this is money ( in the case of the eu ) and fear of russia ( in the case of nato ) . 
  because his capital is in japan . 
  and yet they were much higher * during * the cuban missile crisis - and even then , the countries were * not * at war . 
  so : america is not `` as much ` at war ' with russia as is possible '' . 
  not nearly . 
  one `` zu '' still missing . 
   stop on out, 
  does this mean `` for example '' ? 
  european here . 
  do n't worry , [ you guys are * all * weird . 
   having a daddy who gives you whatever you want, 
  except love . 
   but this man ( a lifelong coward , so we should n't have expected much else ), 
  john mccain a lifelong coward ? 
  just because trump said dumb shit about him , you do n't have to . 
  whatever he may do now or in the future , we can say with certainty and vigor that he is * not * a `` lifelong coward '' . 
   [ in mid-1968 , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_mccain#prisoner_of_war ) [ ... ] the north vietnamese offered mccain early release [ 43 ] because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes , [ 44 ] and also to show other pows that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially . 
  [ 43 ] ** mccain turned down the offer ** ; he would only accept repatriation if every man taken in before him was released as well . 
  enjoy what ? 
  a hit piece against then-candidate mccain from 2008 is certainly not going to convince me that the man was a coward when he refused to accept special treatment and early release after several months of torture and solitary confinement . 
  you can critisize a lot of what he does now , but claiming that he 's a `` lifelong coward '' is just dumb and low . 
  it should also give you pause that this is literally something that trump has done ( `` i like people who were n't captured . 
  '' ) , and been widely and rightly critisized for . 
  do n't stoop so low as to critisize everything about everone on the other side . 
  not sure if this really adds anything new . 
  from the [ wapo article  ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.5ad1cbf05b54 ), 
   `` the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation , '' said ** h.r. 
  mcmaster ** , the national security adviser , who participated in the meeting . 
  `` at no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed , and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly . '', 
   mcmaster reiterated his statement in a subsequent appearance at the white house on monday and described the washington post story as `` false , '' but did not take any questions . 
  not at all . 
  that 's not how alliances work . 
  if a british intelligence agency finds out something that might be relevant to the us , thy 'll usually be happy to share it . 
  but if the americans then decide that they also want to share that same piece of information with russia , bangladesh , or south sudan , it 's obvious that they would first * ask * the brits if that 's ok . 
  the brits would clearly do the same if the roles were reversed . 
  we do n't know what information exactly trump gave to the russians , if any . 
  could have been simply `` we know that isis wants to build laptop bombs '' , could be `` we actually have this informer who works * inside * of an isis bomb manufactory in raqqa . 
  he 's the second in command in that factory , and they have no idea he 's actually working for us [ or our ally ] . 
  he told us they are working on laptop bombs . '', 
  if it was only the former , that 's no a ( big ) scandal . 
  if it 's closer to the latter , that 's information that would directly get somebody tortured to death if it gets out . 
  practically speaking , he can investigate pretty much anything he wants . 
  he 's not supposed to , but nobody could really stop him if he wants to . 
  the best comparison we have is kenneth starr . 
  he was supposed to [ investigate the whitewater real estate deals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/starr_report ) , but ended up investigating everything he could find about clinton . 
  rosenstein was confirmed 94-6 in the senate . 
  does n't sound like democrats were trying to block his confirmation . 
   6-0-11-2 navy, 
  is n't getting more galleys instead of any heavies better for a country like athens , especially early on ? 
  my go-to solution is to bring homemade snacks , e.g. 
  guacamole or meatballs . 
  even better if you can bring something typical for your country/region/city . 
  people usually appreciate this more than some lame 10 $ gift . 
  showing up empty-handed would almost certainly be ok as well . 
   imo , i and everybody i know prefer 10 5 $ presents over one 100 $ present . 
  unless these 5 $ presents are party food : no thanks . 
  it 's not even that i 'd prefer one 100 $ present , i 'd even prefer * nothing * over a bunch of 5 $ presents .
