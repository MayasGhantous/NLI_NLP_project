  that means ( simplifiying ) that at least ~ 1 % of all humans die every year , and this has been true for thousands of years . 
  but since new humans are born , the total number of humans actually increases . 
  if bee hives lived to be ~ 5 years on average , you 'd expect about 20 % to die off each year .

  russia was too poor and troubled back then to think about expansion . 
  just take [ one look at this chart . 
  ] ( https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/russia-gdp.png?s=wgdpruss&amp;v=201704031440v&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231 ), 
  as soon as russia became stronger , it started threatening its neighbors .

  `` speck '' is usually bacon , but it can also mean ecessive body fat , flab . 
  octopuses have tentacles . 
  a fat octopus would have speck-tacles . 
  ( there 's almost a follow-up joke about improved eyesight in there . ), 
  he already knows the saudis are the good guys . 
  they gave ivanka money , the bad guys would n't do that . 
  well , kind of . 
  there are different levels of agreements and guarantees in international politics . 
   the president getting elected by the government , like it is in many other countrys including for example germany . 
  neither the president nor the chancellor in germany are elected `` by the government '' . 
  maybe you mean something like `` elected as party leaders by their parties '' ? 
  because the chancellor typically also is head of one of the big parties , and in * that * position , they are often ( re - ) elected with 90 % + of the vote . 
   either side of the isle, 
  i just want to correct this because `` both sides of the isle '' would also make so much sense that i 'm afraid people might completely misunderstand this image :, 
  it 's both sides of the * aisle * , as in : the lane between [ two sets of chairs or benches .

   maturity . 
  maturation is the verb . 
  the process , not the verb . 
  ( the verb is `` to mature '' , of course . ), 
  the gorilla reaches maturity by undergoing maturation . 
  phew , that 's a relief . 
  i almost deleted it because i know that i sound somewhat pedantic and annoying . 
   i 'm pretty sure too that there is still good money in coal mining by the way . 
  maybe the german coal is poor quality or something , it 's a pretty huge industry here in australia at least from what i 've heard . 
  german coal is simply expensive . 
  first source i found claims [ 180 $ per ton ] ( https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/coal-germany ) ( $ 200 ) , while australian coal is around [ $ ( us ) 80 ] ( https://ycharts.com/indicators/australia_coal_price ) . 
  turkey already holds are far larger number of kurdish villages * within * turkey . 
   for non europeans , interrail is a train ticket available to european residents that allows unlimited travel on non-high-speed trains across europe for a given period of time and a fixed price . 
  one important detail : the ticket is not valid in your home country . 
  about other languages :, 
  `` bow and arrow '' is also a `` siamese twin '' in other languages , such as german/dutch/skandinavian ( `` pfeil und bogen '' , `` pijl en boog '' , `` pil og boge '' ) and iberian languages ( `` arco e/y flecha '' ) . 
  although interestingly , it does n't seem to be the case in french . 
  ( i do n't speak enough french to be sure about this , but it seems that simply calling it `` arc '' is much more common than `` arc et fl\u00e8ches '' as a set phrase . ), 
  i also find interesting that the order of words is reversed in german/skandinavian as compared to english - `` pfeil und bogen '' is literally `` arrow and bow '' , not the other way round . 
  for anyone who does n't know what to think anymore because people keep skipping back and forth between `` inquirer '' and `` enquirer '' :, 
  they are both correct spellings of the same word , meaning `` person who asks questions '' . 
  the tabloid is called the [ national ** e ** nquirer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_enquirer ) . 
  annoyingly , it would make more sense if it were the `` inquirer '' , because that spelling is more common in america , while `` enquirer '' is more common in british english . 
  apparently , many people also [ make a slight distinction ] ( https://youtu.be/5btznemznzy?t=3 ) of using `` enquire '' for simply asking questions and `` inquire '' for a more formal investigation . 
  once again , calling a ( wannabe ) investigative magazine `` inquirer '' would make more sense . 
   does german have other irreversible binomials ? 
  of course ; although i think they are more common in english . 
  if you read any german , you can find a list on wikipedia : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hendiadyoin, 
  in all other cases i can think of , the order is the same as in english . 
  ( `` sun and moon '' is `` sonne und mond '' , `` day and night '' is `` tag und nacht '' , etc. ), 
  german also has one nice `` siamese quadruplet '' in `` frisch , fromm , fr\u00f6hlich , frei '' , meaning something like `` happy-go-lucky '' . 
  if you want to avoid the possible nazi-implications , you might go with, 
  ( man 's best friend and protector ), 
  `` man 's best friend '' in german just as in english always refers to dogs . 
  2 years to become fluent enough to follow university courses and have casual conversations about non-trivial topics wil be quite challenging . 
  it 's possible , but it will definitely require more than just 2 hours or so of classes per week . 
  ( 2 hours per * day * might work . ), 
   im more of a roman history buff so tueteberg forest , cannae , andrianople , and carrhea come to mind . 
  * [ teutoburg forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_teutoburg_forest ), 
  * [ adrianople ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_adrianople ), 
  * [ carrhae ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_carrhae ), 
  i do n't doubt that you knew the correct spelling of these battles , by the way . 
  but it still bothered me . 
  the first european map that showed `` cipangu '' ( as marco polo had called japan ) was the fra mauro map from around 1450 . 
  i do n't even know what you mean by `` accurate '' . 
  i think this map was meant to be an artistic representation of the world , not an accurate one . 
  they did n't even get the mediterranean or the red sea right , although they definitely knew what these areas look like . 
  ( there is no double chain of islands [ in the red sea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/red_sea_topographic_map-de.svg ) - i think they just made them up because it looks pretty . ), 
  in terms of accuracy , [ mercator 's 1569 map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/mercator_1569.png ) ( just two years later ) seems far superior to me . 
  [ i understood that reference . 
   now the fungal has adapted, 
  since we 're fixing failures : it 's either `` fungal * something * '' ( e.g. 
  fungal infection ) , or `` the fungus '' . 
  `` fungus '' is the noun , `` fungal '' is the adjective . 
  but since nobody else mentioned it : i really dig how you ended that comment : `` ravaging the cavendish '' sounds great . 
  it 's fascinating - anyone who has never heard trump speak would have to think that you were mentally ill or having a stroke while writing that comment .

  when you say you can confirm , do you mean you 've actually shot a bear ? 
  story ? 
  good story , but you did * not * drop a bear in that one .

  oh , this is grammar nazi 's paradise : it 's adolf , with an - f. 
  acting ag would be rosenstein , right ? 
  if so , he would n't outlast sessions for a day . 
  because trump would fire him . 
  if he fires sessions , firing rosenstein at the same time wo n't make much of a difference with regards to the size of the scandal .
