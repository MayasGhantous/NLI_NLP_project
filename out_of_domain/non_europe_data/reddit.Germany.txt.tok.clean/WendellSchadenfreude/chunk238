  just for other players who might have this problem and find this thread : you have to revoke free cities to create new non-vassal republics , grant that republic the electorate and make some duchies into new free cities . 
  unfortunately , this takes a long time , because the former free city hates your guts for revoking their status , and will refuse to accept the electorate . 
  from a game design perspective , i do n't think any of this makes sense . 
  republics becoming electors seems much less plausible than one of the episcopalian electorates passing to a duchy . 
  why would people in these pockets become refugees ? 
  * how * would they even do that , i.e. 
  why would the government let them leave the country ? 
  when the government takes over these pockets , the war is over for the civilians in them . 
  no reason to leave syria anymore . 
  lindner . 
  welcome to germany !, 
  mueller ( usually spelled `` m\u00fcller '' ) is the most common surname in germany . 
  even if you do n't read german , the length of this [ wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%bcller_ ( familienname \\ ) ) will give you a rough idea just * how * common it is . 
  that was a fantastic ability . 
  is there a modern program which can do this with similar ease ? 
  got a link to the thread you mean ? 
  because in the one i remember , all the top post were basically saying : `` i do n't like trump , but he 's not wrong about doing this . '', 
  i actually checked , [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6oan25/trump_ends_covert_cia_program_to_arm_antiassad/ ) was the biggest thread on the topic on / politics . 
  two low-effort post at the top , but after that , it 's all support for trump 's decision . 
  the top posts in order :, 
   the best deals , folks !, 
   remember how trump was seeking deliverables he could offer to putin in their g20 meeting ? 
   looks like trump delivered . 
   i do n't like why trump did it , but i agree with the decision to end the covert cia program . 
  i did n't like it when this program was first reported back in 2013 under obama , i 'm not going to be a hypocrite and say i 'm unhappy to see it go . 
   if we 're going to insert ourselves into a civil war , we should just fucking do it . 
  send the military , not civilians with zero accountability . 
  the cia has an awful track record when it comes to meddling in foreign wars . 
  this action in syria , where obama explicitly did n't want in , is no better . 
   the larger problem for us in syria is that it 's basically been ground zero for a proxy war with russia . 
  i do n't have to like the russian government to realize that having two major nuclear powers engaging in a proxy war is dangerous . 
   again , i do n't like trump , assad , or putin , but arming rebels through the cia was a really bad way of participating in that civil war . 
   one of those times that something happens i agree with , for all the wrong reasons . 
  we should n't have been involved in a middle eastern civil war anyway . 
  but a few months ago , trump compared assad to adolph hitler . 
  now he feels that it is not important to stop adolph hitler . 
   does anyone else find it kind of gross that an article about a major shift in the syrian civil war talks primarily about the u.s. and russia ? 
  should n't there be some sort of talk about how this might affect syrians and other nations in the region ? 
  the u.s. and russia are n't even really the primary actors in the proxy war in syria - that would be saudi arabia and iran . 
   i 'm not entirely convinced that sending weapons was super wise in the first place . 
  that strategy has bitten us in the ass pretty severely in the past . 
   good . 
  we had no business arming rebel groups . 
  anyone who disagrees has n't learned anything from the last 100 + years of covert bullshit that has ruined a good chunk of the world . 
   is n't this a good thing ? 
   toppling dictators has only made things worse and given putin more power ( in russia he is seen as `` cleaning up america 's mess '' in the middle east ) . 
   maybe i 'm misunderstanding the significance of this , but are n't we usually against inciting civil war in third world countries ? 
  are we just hating this move because it 's trump , or am i missing something here ? 
  i see that it 's also favorable for russia , but i do n't know if that automatically means it 's bad for the us . 
   this is a good thing tho, 
   just a reminder to everyone that the cia funding rebel groups to depose various regimes has bitten us in the ass , repeatedly ( `` blowback '' ) . 
  this might not be such a terrible thing . 
  so , where are the `` liberals wanting to arm jihadists '' - somewhere much further down in the comments ? 
  the sharpest criticism of trump 's decision that i heard from anyone ( unsurprisingly ) came from john mccain . 
  by the way , this was not a one-time comment by him . 
  in this [ phone interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1spiynywrxw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=140 ) , he also suggests that leakers 150 years ago would have been `` hung '' ( and we can assume that he was n't talking about their massive balls , but actually meant to say `` hanged '' . ), 
  pretextual , or something similar . 
  it means that the reason they are stating is not their actual reason , but just something they say because it sounds credible and they do n't want to give their real reason . 
  tip for that video : watch at 1.25 speed , at least . 
   he created a hostile workplace for all his female coworkers . 
  how so ? 
  he 's not saying anything unkind about his female coworkers . 
  this is such a weird argument . 
  he 's the one who was actually fired . 
  people who think like him will now be worried that they may be fired if anyone finds out how they think - * that 's * a hostile work environment . 
   stating that all your female co-workers are naturally and genetically handicapped in many aspects of their jobs, 
  that 's also not remotely similar to what he wrote . 
  `` men are , on average , more assertive than women '' is n't the same as `` my female coworkers are too stupid to assert themselves '' ; just as `` women are , on average , more coopoerative than men '' is n't the same as `` my male coworkers are anti-social brutes . '', 
   most of his conclusions were unfounded ( conservatives are more conscientious ... 
  what ? ), 
  that 's not necessarily true , but it 's certainly not simply `` what ? '' . 
  [ here 's a source . 
  ] ( http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.224.1720&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf ) ( pdf ), 
   conservatives are naturally more conscientious than liberals, 
  that 's something that you can dispute , but it 's not something that he simply made up himself . 
  [ here 's a source . 
  ] ( http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.224.1720&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf ) ( pdf ), 
   `` males are naturally less neurotic and have more `` drive '' than females , because even castrated males are supposedly more manly / dominant than girls, 
  i do n't get what the `` castrated '' part was all about ; that just sounds weird . 
  but for `` neuroticism '' , again : [ here 's a source . 
  ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2031866/ ), 
  [ quote from the abstract : `` in college and adult samples , women score higher then men on the five factor model ( ffm ) personality traits of neuroticism and agreeableness . '', 
  and [ here 's another . 
  ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3149680/ ), 
  [ `` replicating previous findings , women reported higher big five extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism scores than men . '', 
  took five seconds on google - and * you 're * complaining that other people are posting before doing their work . 
   the avoidance of forms of expression that exclude , marginalize , or insult groups of people ( his definition of political correctness ) is a liberal authoritarian tool that leads to authoritarian policies, 
  i do n't think he actually said anything similar to that anywhere . 
  the only thing he calls `` authoritarian '' is discrimination against people ( that is done `` to reach equal representation '' ) . 
   he basically says that women are n't as good as men in the tech industry, 
  he does n't say that . 
  he just explains why there are * fewer * , he does n't claim that the ones who are there are any worse . 
   you ca n't tell a a girl who 's at his company she 's only there cause she 's a girl or that 's she 's not ever gon na be as good as him at his job because she 's a girl, 
  he does n't say that . 
   what the fuck did you get expect to happen . 
  i 'm really serious , what did you really think was gon na happen ? 
  i ca n't say i 'm really * surprised * they fired him . 
  but if you instead want to know what i would have hoped for :, 
  google could have published a well thought-out reply , even thanking this guy for his input , but made it clear that they disagree with him on [ x ] , [ y ] , and [ z ] . 
  he does n't even * mention * his coworkers .
