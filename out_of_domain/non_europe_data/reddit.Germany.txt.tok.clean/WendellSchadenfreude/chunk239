  if somebody were to ask why there are more black atheletes than statistically expected on the [ us national basketball team ] ( https://nbcprobasketballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/610x-48.jpeg?w=610&amp;h=343&amp;crop=1 ) , i do n't think that saying `` black people may , on average , be biologically better at this than white people '' would create a hostile work environment for any of the white athletes . 
  ( regardless of whether that explanation is correct or not . ), 
  - also , that statement would n't imply at all that the white athletes who * are * on the team are any worse than their black colleagues . 
  how old are you ? 
  [ since the year 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_medicine_and_medical_technology#2000_.e2.80.93_present ) :, 
  - the human genome project was completed, 
  - the first telesurgery performed, 
  - vaccines approved for rotavirus and hpv, 
  - first face transplant, 
  - organs ( kidney , liver ) grown * in vitro *, 
  those are all * major * breakthroughs . 
  there 's also huge developments that are harder to pin-point to one specific year , such as the rise of minimally-invasive surgery . 
  and of course the general , gradual improvements that are probably more important than any individual breakthrough . 
  just [ * look * ] ( http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/year/2016 ) at the list of new approved drugs in the us every year . 
   i know a lot of churches use the donations to help the less fortunate . 
  of course they do - it 's just that churches have much higher overhead costs than any efficient dedicated charity . 
  if you try to [ rank charities ] ( http://www.givewell.org ) by how much good you do with every dollar you donate to them , no churches show up anywhere near the top . 
  the real origin is much more fitting : it 's [ non-stupid watergate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/follow_the_money ) . 
  it 's good that you do n't want to `` come out '' . 
  it sucks , but being that honest with your family could simply do you too much harm . 
  keep your head down until you 're 18 ( at least ) and can move out . 
  until then , to stay sane , try everything to get out of the house more . 
  join a sports team . 
  join some club . 
  if they wo n't let you do anything else , even join a church choir or any other activities that your church offers - normal clubs would be better , but not getting out of the house at all will certainly be worst . 
  maybe you can just go running with some friends ? 
  if you can convinve them that you should attend a regular school , that might help you a lot . 
  maybe even just for a few classes - are there any subjects that your parents and home-schooling tutors ca n't possibly cover ? 
  ( geography ? 
  spanish ? 
  latin ? 
  higher maths ? ), 
  do n't just spend your days staring at your phone !, 
  that 's a recipe for unhappiness in life . 
  with any friends that you have - try to spend more time with them !, 
  hang out at their place , have sleepovers , take weekend camping trips . 
  if possible ( more likely in a year or two ) , try to get a part-time job . 
  that gets you out of the house , gives you more independence , * and * it gives you some money in case you need it . 
  also , it ca n't hurt to check out if there are any / atheisthavens near you . 
  save a contact in your phone , just in case you suddenly need it . 
  you sound like a smart kid . 
  if you can keep your sanity for another few years , life will be awesome !, 
  honestly , that just sounds like a pretty normal conversation i have with old friends . 
  the jokes here are different , but they are n't any more inane . 
  there are just many more people joining in , so every angle of a joke is exhausted much more quickly . 
  i do n't think they are particularly bad . 
  you find horror stories about every delivery company . 
  the thing is : when you get a delivery without any problems , you usually barely remember what company delivered it . 
  personally , i only had really bad experiences with hermes . 
  but honestly : all of these companies have overworked , underpaid drivers . 
  if your elevator is confusing , maybe just place a post-it in there . 
  `` dpd for [ last name ] , press this button --  '', 
  opening the apartment door in pjs is fine . 
  makes you look like a slacker unless you 're visibly sick ; but the driver has certainly seen worse . 
  partly because it 's not the most important topic any more , but partly because it brings her about as many votes as it costs her . 
  1 ) there are people who like her because of her behavior during that crisis . 
  2 ) there are people who worry about mass immigration , but realize that of the parties that could realistically be in power after the elections , the cdu/csu is the most anti-immigration party . 
  and spd-led coalition would support immigration and open borders much more than merkel 's administration . 
  a right-wing extremist literally mowed down a crowd of people with a car ; and we 're really lucky he only killed * one * person . 
  the presidents job is to condemn that , full stop . 
  * that * would bring the country together , because everybody should be able to agree that murder/terrorism is evil . 
  even the good people among the right-wing protesters ( assuming there were any ) should be able to get behind that . 
  if instead you say `` the murderer was bad , but lots of other people are also bad '' , you * are * defending the murderer . 
  fuck `` antifa '' , but there 's a time and a place for condemning them - and it 's not right after an actual act of right-wing domestic terrorism occured . 
  trump is like one of the disgraceful people who reacted to 9/11 with `` yeah , but the us also does a lot of bad stuff , so they kind of had it coming . '', 
  klar . 
  that 's not even fun in english , where most words only have like 5 letters anyway . 
  ( of the 22 words in your sentence , ** 19 ** had 4 letters or fewer . ), 
  ntteer nenbeefekft : google translate hlfit nciht mher . 
  in ck2 at the standard start date ( 1066 ) , the character in the world with the highest learning stat is baron hans of asperg . 
  he 's also shy , cynical , and honest . 
   wisdom teeth are painful as fuck to remove . 
  that varies from case to case . 
  i got mine out ( 2x2 within a few weeks ) with local anaesthesia as well , and i ca n't say it hurt * at all * . 
  just felt a bit weird durign the procedure , and the painkillers made me a bit groggy for the next two days or so , but it really was n't too bad of an experience . 
  i just stayed at home and ate nothing but yogurt for half a week - that avoided the chewing problem . 
   restaurants and mom and pop convince stores . 
  the most persuasive kind of store !, 
  carbon-14 is a [ naturally occuring isotope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon-14#origin ) , formed by cosmic rays from nitrogen in the atmosphere . 
  c-14 has a natural abundance of about 1 part per trillion . 
  due to the atomic tests , the atmospheric level roughly doubled for a while . 
  some other radionuclides ( e.g. 
  cobalt-60 ) that were produced by human activity do not occur naturally ( except maybe in trace amounts , i.e. 
  much smaller than 1 ppt ) . 
  however , we * can * make ` pure ' steel . 
  nobody does , because low-background steel is n't actually all that expensive - there simply are n't that many applications for which you actually need it . 
  plus , the natural background radiation of the air was actually [ increased by only ~ 10 % . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/background_radiation#atmospheric_nuclear_testing ), 
  at 1.5 hours per day , you 'll be done with duolingo in a week . 
  you 'll also be conversational within a few months - from dutch to german , that basically only means that you have to learn the pronounciation and some regular differences . 
  ( i think fluency depends more on your talent , and also on your level of immersion . 
  but it should take about two years even at full immersion , i.e. 
  living in germany surrounded by germans . ), 
  no , no - he 's talking about black caucasians . 
  it 's really not whoosh . 
  the ( old ) joke goes something like [ `` by the time i finish this sentence , a hundred people will have died in china . '', 
  - `` why did you stop talking ? '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhhrgofpblc ) . 
  there it makes sense , because it at least sounds like they might have died later if only you had kept talking . 
  but seconds pass regardless of whether anybody is counting . 
  that makes it just a really poor joke .
