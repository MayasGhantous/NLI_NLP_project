   but it seems like an incredibly difficult starting position . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's not easy , but others are much harder . 
  people love coming up with great byzantium strategies , but it can really be enough for a start if you 're allied with poland ( + lithuania ) or with albania and hungary , and then get a little bit lucky . 
  depends on how you define `` a couple of weeks '' . 
  if we say that rent is ~ 250 $ ( pretty low estimate ) , they would get 1900 $ within 3 months . 
  and it 's a good deal for pretty much everyone involved . 
  if free rent is worth nothing , yeah . 
  and we do n't look at other benefits . 
   according to source d , [ ... ] trump 's ( perverted ) conduct in moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the ritz carlton hotel , where he knew president and mrs obama ( whom he hated ) had stayed on one of their offical trips to russia , and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a `` golden showers '' ( urination ) show in front of him . 
  the hotel was known to be under fsb control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms to record anything they wanted to . 
  but just go and read the thing . 
  the original document ( 35 pages ) , not the 40k pages . 
  other parts of it are far more important .

  some things you might not know about reddit : press return twice to actually force a linebreak . 
  - he put pre-trial detainees in tents that reached 145 degrees -- so hot their shoes melted . 
  he boastfully called these `` concentration camps . '', 
  - he put a live webcam in a women 's holding cell pointing a the toilet , so anyone on the internet could watch detainees go to the bathroom . 
  - he refused investigate hundreds of molestation cases including dozens of cases with young children for victims , even in cases where great details of the crime were known . 
  ignored rape cases too , including of a 13-year old girl . 
  - he staged a fake assassination attempt of himself , to get himself publicity . 
  an innocent man spent 4 years in jail for this . 
  - has his deputies routinely arrest latinx citizens ( yes , citizens , though it should n't matter to you ) and detain them for hours , days , or weeks , based on false charges . 
  - stopped investigating violent crimes , including homicides , because he was so focused on harassing of latinxs . 
  - placed spanish-speaking inmates into solitary confinements , for not speaking english . 
  - he also withheld meds , causing needless suffering and deterioration of inmates . 
  - he forced inmates to watch videos of newt gingrich , calling it educational . 
  - oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in the history of the united states , per doj findings . 
  - one of his jailers nearly broke the neck of a paraplegic man , because the man asked for a catheter . 
  - he arrested a ny times reporter for covering him . 
  ( they won a $ 3.75 million settlement . ), 
  - he hired a pi to investigate a federal judge and his wife , after the judge ruled that indeed arpaio had been racially profiling latinxs , and ordered him to stop . 
  - he refused to stop doing so . 
  the conviction of this is what his pardon is undoing . 
  - in one botched swat raid , his deputies set a puppy on fire and laughed about it / at the owner . 
  - not surprisingly , inmates died in his facilities at unusually high rates . 
  - his deputies killed prisoners by placing them in restraint chairs and the abusing them . 
  deputies killed one by using a stun gun on him -- he was already in a restraint chair . 
  video showed another died after fourteen guards beat , shocked , and suffocated him -- also already in a restraint chair . 
  in that case , the sheriff 's office was accused of discarding evidence , including crushed larynx of the deceased . 
  - created the first juvenile chain gang in several decades in the united states . 
  relatedly , he boasted on his website about all the free labor he was providing for taxpayers . 
  - cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in legal and other extra-ordinary costs . 
  - to cut costs , he provided inmates two meals a day , which were later found to be unfit for consumption -- including moldy bread and rotten fruit . 
  - despite all this , found money and time to send deputies to hawaii to `` prove '' obama 's birth certificate was fake . 
  this list is sadly incomplete . 
  what important element of fascism would you say he 's missing ? 
  she always opposed turkey joining , but supported keeping the talks about it open - this is actually a typical merkel position , somehow keeping all options open . 
  `` turkey should n't be an eu member , * and * we should officially end the talks about their membership really is a new position for her . 
   but it might be most people 's 3rd language, 
  a third language is still a secondary language . 
   no grid operator or utility wants to depend on a single source of energy . 
  french grid operators are pretty happy with pretty much just two sources though , [ nuclear and water .

   hundreds if not thousands of innocent people, 
  hundreds of thousands if not millions . 
  when do you think that would have happened ? 
  there have been [ more than 2,000 nuke tests since the end of wwii .

  the first part is `` number of days since the first a-bomb was dropped '' - how would that ever be reset ? 
  * i * would n't rob a guy even if he was guaranteed * not * to have a gun on him - but some methhead would , regardless of the gun . 
  or a a desperate debtor . 
  and a scorned lover , a jealous husband , an outraged religious fanatic , or any number of other people might attack that poor guy even if they do n't want to rob him . 
  i do n't think so . 
  good indicator : when the people of saarland [ were asked in 1935 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saar_status_referendum,_1935 ) , less than 0.5 % voted for unification with france . 
  now , i would n't want to put a fixed value at which percentage of the people you need to convince before an area should be considered a core , but 0.5 % really is n't much . 
   this will create a truce lasting for 20 years . 
  i see what you did there , marshal foch . 
  the whole concept of `` cores '' is a bit fuzzy , of course , but i think it entails convincing at least * some * of the people who live in an area that they belong to your country . 
  `` some '' might be just 5 % or so ; but not just ** . ** 5 % . 
  at best , saarland would have been a territorial core , which was lost immediately at the end of the napoleonic wars . 
  i think that 's because the dragon intercepted the ball and * touched down * in the end zone .

  if your sentence is commuted to `` one day left in prison '' , can you still plead the fifth after that ?

  probably something similar to [ aleppo 's industrial city . 
  but really : i only just realized how little of deir ezzor actually is north/east of the river . 
  there are n't any proper urban areas , just a couple of villages . 
  i can imagine the sdf reaching the river within a week . 
  this is my `` he ca n't * actually * have said that '' trump moment of the day . 
  90 % of the time , it turns out that he actually * did * - but did he really brag about buying politicians ? 
  about being able to buy them , or about actually having done so ? 
  pretending to give a shit and actually giving a shit are two different things . 
  i 'd appreciate it if we did n't all have to spend money to pretend that we give a shit when we do n't . 
  it 's nice when a handful of my coworkers remember my birthday because they are people i actually like and who actually like me , and who are also the people i might invite to my party if i have one . 
  i do n't care at all about the card with 50 names on it that i also get for my birthday . 
  most of the people on there probably did n't even check whose card they were signing ( and that 's fine ) . 
  `` prom '' ( officially short for `` promenande dance , although i do n't think most people know this ) is a somewhat formal event that american highschools hold for their students , typically near the end of the school year . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prom ) - typically : guys wear tuxedos , girls wear dresses , and they all think it 's super important . 
  guys have always been expected to ask the girl out for prom .
