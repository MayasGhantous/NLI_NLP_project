  in the past few years , there 's been a trend that simply * asking * is n't enough , but they guy has to make a big romantic show out of it - the way the lead character might do for a marriage proposal in a cheap kitschy romantic movie . 
  that 's called a `` promposal '' . 
  it 's horrid . 
   `` a black '' or especially to say `` the blacks . '', 
  granted , these two sound kinda offensive . 
  but calling someone `` a black person/man/woman '' or speaking about `` black people '' sounds just fine to me . 
  that 's not `` correcting '' them . 
  white people also are n't the same color as bed sheets , but they 're still called white . 
  calling black people `` brown people '' is just deliberately confusing . 
  it does express contradiction !, 
  i was confused as well for a moment , and i still think they should have phrased this differently , but at least this makes it interesting . 
  `` sanction '' is what 's called an [ autantonym ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auto-antonym ) or contranym , the rare case of a word that has two meanings that are not just * different * , but * opposing * . 
  `` sanction '' can mean `` approval '' ( `` gay marriage is legal now , but it will probably never be sanctioned by the catholic church '' . ), 
  as well as `` punishment '' ( `` new sanctions against north korea '' ) . 
  the former meaning is somewhat unusual nowadays , and mostly used in religious contexts . 
  another autantonym would be `` to dust '' , which can either mean `` to remove dust '' ( i.e. 
  cleaning ) or `` to add dust '' ( e.g. 
  dusting a cake with sugar ) . 
  wikipedia has a few more . 
  so in this case , we have to assume that extramarital affairs were not typically sanctioned in taihitian culture , i.e. 
  they were frowned upon . 
   i fail to see any benefits that trump would reap by quitting, 
  more time for golf and stuff . 
  also , i fail to see any benefits in a lot of the things trump does . 
   [ joseph and d\u00e9sir\u00e9e were engaged , and the brother of joseph , napoleon bonaparte , was also introduced to the family . 
  reportedly , it was napoleon who suggested that joseph should be engaged to her older sister julie instead , while he should be engaged to d\u00e9sir\u00e9e ; this suggestion had the approval of all four involved .

  ... people were so weird back then . 
   you could have just said that she became one of the most and influential mathematicians . 
  that would have been just nonsense though . 
  she was n't very influential as a mathematician at all . 
  ( `` influential '' to me would mean that she did any work that other mathematicians built upon . 
  she did n't . ), 
  ada lovelace can be considered `` the first computer programmer '' , and that should be impressive enough . 
  but instead , she 's often hopelessly overhyped . 
  but her program was * not * `` a turning point in the develoment of modern computers '' - nobody even cared for her program until 1953 , and then people only cared for historic reasons . 
  she did not actually advance mathematics or computer science in any meaningful way . 
  ( it 's conceivable at least that she might have , had she not died at 36 . ), 
  calling her one of the most influential female mathematicians should actually be considered an anti-feminist thing to say , because there are so many other women who actually * amde * contributions to maths ; most notably [ emmy noether ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emmy_noether ) . 
  i 'm not really one of `` them guys '' ( i.e.

  `` at this point , who does n't want trump impeached ? '',

   so they would n't pay 2 % of their income for a universal system ? 
  ( what the medicare levy is in australia ), 
  the 2 % number is a bit misleading , since this is not the only money that australians pay for health care . 
  overall , [ australians pay ~ 9.5 % of their gdp for healthcare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_care_in_australia ) . 
  the point still stands , though : americans pay a [ higher percentage ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/australia_healthcare_cost_comparison.png ) of their gdp for health care , even though their gdp per capita is higher . 
   signalling on exit is the one thing i still have problems with . 
  i do it every time , but roundabouts are the only case where i think it 's not quite necessary . 
  your turn signal is mostly interesting for drivers who would want to enter the roundabout and have to know that you 're exiting - but they usually ca n't really * see * your turn signal anyway because your car is in the way . 
  i think it would be a nice addition if cars had an extra `` turn '' signal right at the center front . 
  in roundabouts , it would signal `` i 'm about to exit '' ; and it would be very easy to see for the relevant other drivers . 
  you could also use that signal at normal intersection to make it clear that you really want to drive straight ahead and are n't some asshat who wants to turn but was too lazy to use his turn signal . 
   there 's no car between the driver waiting at the roundabout entry and that turn signal . 
  yes there is - * your * car . 
  do you think [ this car is signalling a right-hand turn ? 
  ] ( https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/htb1g7l8ofxxxxcyxxxxq6xxfxxxe/free-shipping-2pc-lot-car-styling-car-led-lamp-canbus-font-b-front-b-font-turn.jpg ) probably not , since there 's no driver in it , but it * might * - you ca n't see it . 
  [ or this one ? 
  you definitely ca n't see the rear turn signal . 
  but [ with ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m9rtaed3hfu/maxresdefault.jpg ) many [ cars ] ( http://www.ijdmtoy.com/ebay/sku341/py24w-led-for-bmw-turn-signal-lights-07.jpg ) , you [ also ] ( http://media.istockphoto.com/photos/blue-modern-car-closeup-of-headlight-picture-id473430402?s=2048x2048 ) ca n't [ see the ] ( http://www.ijdmtoy.com/ebay/smd_led/t20/30-smd/led-turn-signal-light-07.jpg ) front [ turn singal ] ( http://www.ijdmtoy.com/ebay/smd_led/t20/30-smd/led-turn-signal-light-01.jpg ) very well until they are at an almost 90 \u00b0 angle with you - but that never even happens if the car is exiting the roundabout . 
  ( that 's why it `` feels like going straight '' . ), 
  of course you often * can * see the turn signal at some point - but it would be much easier , * and * you would see it sooner if there were another light at ( or close to ) the center of the car . 
  you 're welcome . 
  if trump and the gop establishment actually turn on each other , i think about half of all republican voters would support trump . 
  and that 's why they 're terrified : if you split the republican party in half ( even if it 's a 70/30 split ) , the democrats win 35 + states , including all the big ones . 
  tl ; dr : the genitive of `` dunkel '' would be `` dunkeler '' - that 's hard to pronounce , so it becomes `` dunkler '' .

   plea the fifth, 
  the verb is plead ; plea is the noun . 
  `` fuck off '' would be grammatically correct . 
  `` get fucked '' would also be correct , but you should n't capitalize the `` fucked '' ( and only capitalize the `` get '' if it 's the beginning of the sentence ) . 
  neither would be particularly kind or appropriate . 
  eichmann was a citizen of the german reich , and the brd * is * the german reich , legally speaking . 
  not just the legal successor , but actually identical to the reich .

  i actually checked : [ they did not . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_eichmann#trial ), 
  although eichmann 's defense team did - that team , interestingly , consisted of german lawyers . 
  [ israel had changed the law specifically for this process so that foreign lawyers were even allowed to represent defendants . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_servatius ), 
  germany apparently did not protest because the un condoned the israeli actions , although i ca n't find out more about this . 
  ( i guess germany actually just wanted to find * any * reason that would allow them * not * to protest in that case . 
   when the prosecution rested , the defence opened its case with a motion to dismiss based on the trial itself being illegal . 
  servatius [ eichmann 's lawyer ] challenged eichmann 's kidnapping and the basis for the israeli law under which he had been indicted .
