  he argued that if the trial were to continue , it should transfer its jurisdiction to west germany . 
  the prosecution countered by stating that the united nations had endorsed israel 's actions , and that both west germany and argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate . 
  the defence motion was subsequently dismissed . 
  there was some talk about it , but it 's generally [ not even legally possible to revoke the german citizenship . 
  ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0096 ) you can lose it , but only if that does n't make you stateless . 
  in 22 , you circled the last `` e '' in the second line - but you were supposed to circle the last `` the '' . 
  your circle in 16 also does n't overlap with the left corner of the triangle . 
  since i make the rules , `` wow '' does not count as a word . 
  in 29 , i have no idea what you 're supposed to do , so your answer is wrong . 
  actually , same for 30 . 
  the question is n't really a sentence , so you 're wrong again !, 
  boy , this test is ridiculous . 
  for a second ? 
  i have no idea what i 'm supposed to do . 
  is there a difference between `` printing '' and `` writing '' a word ? 
  am i supposed to first write every other word , then write every third word ? 
  what does `` original type smaller '' mean ? 
   for what seems like just posing for the camera . 
  i hope that 's all it is ; and they are more careful with their ammunition when no reporters are around . 
  i heard that journalists in war zones often have that effect . 
  when they go in the firs time , they wonder if they 'll have to ask the soldiers if they would fire a few bullets for the camera ; but then they learn they never have to ask : when there 's a camera , soldiers will usually decide all on their own that they ca n't be seen just standing around doing nothing , it 's better to shoot a few bullets in some random direction pretending that there might be an enemy . 
  it helps * a lot * if you have the opportunity to take a shower at work . 
  in 2010 , norwegian police fired 6 bullets . 
  [ that 's more than in any other year from 2002 to 2014 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/police_firearm_use_by_country#norway ), 
  there 's apparently been a frightening surge of police violence in norway recently : [ they shot a man in 2015 , and another one in 2016 . 
  ] ( https://www.thelocal.no/20161128/norwegian-police-involved-in-just-fourth-fatal-shooting-in-14-years ), 
  to be fair , norway only has a population of about 5 milion , so it 's somewhere between chicago city and the chicago metro area . 
   also latvian joke need potato somewhere . 
  on the contrary , latvian joke need * no * potato somewhere . 
  only dream of potato . 
  unlike isis , the sdf have no plans of taking over the entire country . 
  so unless the government decides to actively attack them , there will be no bloodshed between these two sides . 
  so you 're not so much expecting more bloodshed as hoping for it . 
  besides , the most valuable places of syria are aleppo , damascus , and the coast . 
  no love for lebanon ? 
  * everybody * should celebrate the destruction of isis . 
  i think [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2clfz7/spoilers_all_theory_discussion_the_mystery_of_the/ ) is the most thorough explanation of all th theories surrounding the `` pink letter '' . 
  or maybe look at [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/4wi0nh/spoilers_twow_the_pink_letters_author_is_almost/ ) . 
  i used to think that it was stannis who wrote that letter ; but i 've honestly forgotten what made me think so . 
   if you flip the last 2 digits it pulls up the opposite of your vote . 
  america does n't have a strict two-party-system , so there is no `` opposite of your vote '' . 
   learning our president hired common thugs to break in and bug the opposition, 
  i thought he did n't ? 
  do n't want to do the research now , but i thought nixon was `` only '' involved in the cover-up , not in the actual break-in . 
  i think of all the realistic options , that one comes closest to what the us hopes for . 
  syria remains officially intact , but the kurds are de facto independent - what more could the us want ? 
  sure , getting rid of assad would be nice ( from a us perspective ) , but that 's not a realistic goal . 
  i am [ home ] .

  these are n't simply * reposts * , these are * classics * . 
  until the subreddit rules changed about a month ago , these images and some others would just resurface at least once a month . 
  things changed , for better or for worse , but it would be a pity if new users * never * got to see some of these . 
  and i also enjoy seing them from time to time , even though i 'm happy that they do n't take up the entire front page any more . 
  if this is received kindly , i 'll post a similar collection in a few weeks . 
  any suggestions of memes that absolutely * must * be added next time ? 
  [ spoilers about ender 's game , obviously . 
  if you spoil other books from the series , please use tags . 
  thanks ! ], 
  * ender 's game * seems to be one of reddit 's favourite books . 
  you convinced me to try it , and i liked it , too - but there 's one question that 's been bugging me . 
  * how did the buggers know which planet ender would come to live on ? 
  or did they simply put an `` end of the world tower '' on every one of their planets ? 
  or possibly several , because planets are big and ender has to find it first . 
  i hope this subreddit allows questions like this ; i did n't know where else i could ask . 
  be it the bouncer at a nightclub or a powerful governent official - with tones of money , cookies , or `` manus manum lavat '' - to get something done just a little faster , or to avoid prison time - have you ever bribed anyone ? 
  when my bastard son was born , i decided to acknowledge him as mine , but to not legitimize him . 
  the mouseover tooltip claimed that i could still legitimize him later . 
  i 've never done this , and i ca n't find the option anywhere . 
  does it actually work ? 
  [ in case it 's relevant : my character died , so the child is now my bastard brother , not my son anymore . 
  i would like to legitimize him because he is at the moment the only other living person with my blood . ], 
  my pc has been running just fine since i built it ~ 2.5 years ago , but a few days ago it started crashing constantly . 
  the screen freezes and the computer does n't react to anything ( including ctrl + alt + delete ) for several minutes , it then shows a blue screen for a split second before shutting down . 
  instead of rebooting , it complains something about `` insert proper boot device '' . 
  when i switch it off completely and restart , everything works just fine - sometimes for a few hours , sometimes just for 20 minutes , then it crashes again . 
  does n't seem to matter if i 'm gaming , surfing , or not doing anything at all . 
  i have no idea what might be causing this and hope somebody here can help me find the problem . 
  whocrashed does n't even realize there were any crashes . 
  i updated all drivers . 
  i cleaned the case . 
  all temperatures ( according to speedfan ) are very good ( ~ 30 \u00b0 c ) . 
  i ran memtest86 over night , and it found no problems . 
  - what 's next ? 
  win 7, 
  intel i5 3.3 ghz, 
  ssd ( crucial ) for os , wd green 2tb for stuff, 
  ** edit : ** like misvak , i also suspect the ssd to be at fault . 
  i made a new partition on my hdd , disconnected the ssd and installed windows on the new partition . 
  so far , everything seems to work ... if that 's still the case in a few hours , i 'll count this as `` solved '' . 
  playing one dynastic line from count to emperor to ruler of all the known world has become a bit of a drag lately , so i was thinking about games in which i occasionally switch the character i 'm playing . 
  i was thinking i might always play until my ruler dies , then continue as his * second * son .
