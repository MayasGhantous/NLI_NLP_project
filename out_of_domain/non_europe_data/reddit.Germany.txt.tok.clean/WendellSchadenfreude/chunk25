  quebec is near the eastern border of your timezone - i 'm confused now , does n't that mean that the sun rises relatively early ?

  `` aetheism '' - * cringe * ... that looks worse than the common `` athiesm '' . 
  it 's * atheism * . 
  a - = without, 
  theos = god, 
  - ism = * common suffix for philosophies etc. 
  hope this helps you remembering , `` atheism '' just looks so much nicer . 
  it 's basically a social security card , a primitive version of it . 
  it 's from the `` seekasse '' , an insurrance or social security institution for sailors . 
  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/seekasse [ sorry , german only . ], 
  sorry , i do n't think it 's interesting enough for me to translate it for you . 
  just his basic data ( walter n\u00e4der , maritime machinist , living in hamburg , born in magdeburg in 1882 ) and a lot of very bureaucratic german . 
  arrrg is right , but he left out one piece of information that might be interesting to you :, 
  the guy 's name . 
  he is identified as `` walther albert wunsch , called n\u00e4der '' . 
  so it looks as if his name was actually wunsch , he just called himself n\u00e4der - for whatever reason ... 
  also , he lived in [ t\u00f6nning ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%b6nning ) . 
   society progresses one funeral at a time . 
  i do n't know who you want to quote this to , i just wanted to let you know that i , as a fellow atheist ( and supporter of marriage equality ) , still think this sounds inhuman and disgusting , so the reactions you get might be mixed ... 
   i really think the internet helps , young people have access to a wide range of information they are no longer forced into inherited stereotyping and they can make up their own minds . 
  i think you might be too euphoric here . 
  while it 's true that `` young people [ and not only young people ] have access to a wide range of information '' , people do n't usually * use * this . 
  instead , the internet is mostly used to find your ( small or big ) circle of peers who agree with almost everything you believe . 
  even if your own ideas are insanely wrong , the internet makes it very easy to find at least a few hundred people who share them and will happily reinforce all your beliefs . 
  since i 'm sure most people wo n't get this :, 
  [ stalin 's son yakov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yakov_dzhugashvili ) was captured by the germans in 1941 , later died in a concentration camp . 
  he was n't stalin 's * only * son , though , he had a brother ( and a sister ) . 
  now * this * makes me laugh . 
  there are still entire societies where they all `` simply know that homosexuality is wrong '' . 
  there are , on the other hand , people who do n't think that `` bestiality '' is wrong . 
  have a look at [ this wiki-list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zoophilia_and_the_law#national_laws ) . 
  zoophilia is legal , for instance , in hungary and denmark . 
  paedophilia , just two random examples : it was not generally considered wrong in [ ancient greece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pederasty#the_greeks ) ; and mohammad 's wife aisha was nine years old when the marriage was consumated . 
  why is n't it legal in china , then ? 
  i 'm not saying any argument justifies treating people like second class citizens , but the '' * godless communists * '' must certainly have * some * non-religious arguments . 
  this should * so * be the top-post in this thread .

  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5cr0yyf40 ), 
  [ mitchell & webb link ], 
   for most people who have thought about it , the difference would be : consent . 
  assuming that you 're not aware of it , i just wanted to inform you that this sounds extremely condescending . 
  anyway , about the consent : consent is not required when i kill and eat a cow . 
  but you still want to claim that this is relevant not only if i want to fuck her instead , but even if i only want to * marry * my darling cow ( and possibly eat her later ) ? 
  and in the case of pedophilia : wikpedia claims that in ancient greece , `` the pederastic relationship had to be approved by the boy 's father '' . 
  maybe we should also allow pedophilia * with consent of the child 's parents * ? 
  uh , plot twist : this was actually a protest against * incest * , and they * are * sisters !,
