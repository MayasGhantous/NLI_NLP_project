  op 's picture was also from france , and is several months old , btw . 
  there 's another picture taken a few moments later or earlier that at least shows one guy who seems to like what he sees . 
  ( bottom left ), 
  look at the video in this article . 
  it 's france , 85 % whites . 
  men ( their husbands , i assume ) were also there , look at the video in this article :, 
  it 's france , 85 % whites . 
  men ( their husbands , i assume ) were also there , look at the video in this article :, 
  who now , the kissing girls or the women in the background ? 
  the girls were pretending , they are straight . 
  google `` french protest kiss '' or something for the story . 
  ( it 's several months old . ), 
  ok , i 'll be posting the same answer to everyone in this thread ...

  marseille , france . 
   because the anti equal marriage protest was funded by a christian organisation . 
  do some googleling . 
  i did some googleling . 
  what you say is not true . 
  it 's not a religious organization . 
  their members might be religious , but the organization is not . 
  ( of course not , i want to add : this is france , where they invented la\u00efcit\u00e9 . ), 
  this is france , 85 % white . 
  also , i do n't think blacks ( biggest minority in france and the us ) statistically support gay marriage any more than whites , neither in france nor in the us . 
  they are * not * a religious organization . 
  the french do n't like mixing politics and religion . 
  `` in the shadow of a church '' is literally every market place in europe .

  this is france . 
  the wikipedia statistics about this are almost funny : half the french describe themselves as as catholics , but only half * of those `` catholics '' * say that they believe in god !, 
  only ~ 5 % of the population attend church once a week . 
  *** or *** he thinks the girls only kissed because their religion demands it !, 
  baseless claim . 
  the `` icky '' - factor makes up for much more than 1 % . 
  globally , it might be more important than religion . 
  this was n't organized by the ump . 
  ( nor is the ump a christian party . ), 
  it was organized by alliance vita . 
  not a religious organization , though most of their members might be christians . 
  the men are on the other side of the picture . 
  these two women are literally standing on path cutting through the center of two large groups , one of men and the other of women . 
  like these protesters better ?

  are doctors without borders a christian organization ? 
  edit : i do n't know what `` provita '' is , btw - i was talking only about the french `` alliance vita '' . 
  political organizations in france tend to not be religious , because laicite . 
  well , at least you 're trying now . 
  please notice you are still defending jrv 's non-argument that this is not an issue because `` we all know bestiality and paedophilia are wrong '' . 
  you found a few passable rational arguments as to how `` bestiality and paedophila '' are actually * different * from homosexuality , which is what jrv should have done in the first place . 
  now you only need to learn some manners !, 
  [ srsly , dude : i 'm on your side . 
  this whole thread is about non-religious arguments against gay marriage , i was simply providing some . 
  i never insulted you , so your attitude was entirely uncalled for . ], 
  in this map , were rooting for the black death . 
  nice observation . 
   only half of those `` catholics '' say that they believe in god !, 
  actually , i do n't see how this qualifies as `` logical '' . 
  i 'd invite you to read that quotation again . 
  well , that was * his * point as well . 
  more or less . 
  we live in such a great time ... 
  `` why are there no updates ? '', 
  - `` here are 30 papers for you . '', 
  why is that a big difference ? 
  wild guess : n2 will only displace the oxygen in the air slowly , so the birds become drowsy and then just fall asleep , forever ; while co2 chokes you internally , so you die gasping for air ( without effect ) at full conscience . 
  - is that about right , or am i way off ? 
  my favorite map of the day . 
  i think that 's legal everywhere . 
   please do n't hate me because i 'm a christian on r/atheism . . 
  of course not !, 
  just keep coming back , you wo n't be a christian for long . 
  anyhow , here 's some reading for you and your sister : [ wikipedia on sexual orientation and evolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation#sexual_orientation_and_evolution ) . 
  of course , your sister is right to some ( very limited ) extent : evolutionary advantages of homosexuality are not * obvious * . 
  now , there are some things in nature that just happen despite the fact that they are ( or seem ! ), 
  disadvantagous ( in terms of evolution ) , like animals eating their own offspring ( common in fish ) . 
  but if you look at the wikipedia article , there are some possible advantages that homosexuality might have . 
  in any case : evolutionary success has nothing to do with morality . 
  genocide offers great rewards in evolutionary terms , but it 's still morally wrong without a doubt . 
  i agree that he should change his passwords ( and i think it 's really weird that he does n't realize that himself ) , but you might want to look into easier-to-remember passwords . 
  how so ? 
  he likely * gave * his ex the password at some point - if he used keepass , he 'd probably just have given her the master password , and she 'd now have access to *** all *** his accounts . 
  ( not saying password managers are n't a good idea . 
  but this might be a bad case to prove it . ), 
  come to think of it , maybe that 's exactly what happened ... 
  from what little we know , i think that 's overly dramatic . 
  his ex knows his password . 
  possibly his email password only . 
  change that password , and your done .
