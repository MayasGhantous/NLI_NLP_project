  he 'll just turn the water into wine and wait till you drown * willingly * . 
  damn , this is * almost * a fantastic comment . 
  except jesus was a carpenter , only a few of his apostles were fishermen . 
  but i agree , this puts the whole `` fishers of men '' thing into a new light . 
  `` what 's in the safe , dear mister drug lord ? '', 
  why would he make excuses for a god he does n't believe in ? 
  many more babies die of natural reasons than are aborted . 
  that 's a fact , but it does n't tell you anything about wether abortion is right or wrong . 
  reducing this to a legal question , do you have any suggestions as to what the laws * should * be like ? 
  the man can force the woman to carry the child to term if he wants it and she does n't ? 
  the man can force the woman to abort the child if she wants it and he does n't ? 
  what if the violinist 's kidney failed * because you stabbed him *, 
  a ) in a drunken stupor . 
  b ) in a spontaneous outburst of anger . 
  c ) accidentally while playing knife games . 
  d ) accidentally in an otherwise harmless brawl . 
  e ) accidentally out of pure carelessness , while cooking . 
  in all these cases , you did n't really plan for the violinist to be in his awkward situation , but you are at least somewhat responsible for it . 
  i think in all these cases , you would have an obligation to save his life . 
  [ decide for youself if you still think that this is a great analogy . ], 
   edit : woman -  women, 
  why ... ? 
  makes more sense as `` woman '' , but if you change it , you also have to change does -  do , father -  fathers and so on . 
  sorry , there wo n't be a real answer for a couple of hours . 
  maybe never . 
  the original analogy compared pregnancy to kidnapping . 
  i 'm only adding the stabbing to make you at least somewhat responsible for the violinist 's condition . 
  in cases c-e , the stabbing was accidental and thus not really illegal or immoral . 
  [ in other words : do n't tell me i ca n't compare stabbing someone to `` stabbing someone '' . 
  if you know what i mean . ], 
  i do n't think the fetus is hers the same way that her body is . 
  if someone asked you , you 'd always advice them to keep their baby ? 
  ( i guess we 're not talking about rape , incest , or danger to the mother 's life , but all the `` normal '' cases . ), 
  may i ask why ? 
  do you simply think that keeping the baby is always the choice that will make the mother happier in the long run , or is it something completely different ? 
  [ i 'll be off for today . 
  good night ! ], 
  i guess i would , at least in cases where this is the only way to save the victim 's life . 
  ( transplantation do n't quite work that way , of course , you ca n't just donate a liver to anyone . ), 
   funny how anti-abortionists never use their guilt-trip campaigns to promote organ donation . 
  i promote organ donations as good as i can . 
  i do n't think `` guilt-tripping '' usually makes for a very convincing argument . 
  even so , it works even worse as an argument for organ donations , because the donor can rarely be made responsible in any way for the condition of the receiver , while the parents * are * responsible for the `` condition '' of a fetus . 
  ( maybe you think using the word `` responsible '' is already part of a guilt-trip campaign . 
  good for you ! ), 
  i 'll believe the accusations of misogyny if you can show me someone who opposes a mother 's right to have an abortion but advocates the father 's right to force her to have one . 
  [ hint : nobody does that . ], 
  i 'm sorry if it seems that way to you . 
  but again , at least in cases c-e , the stabbing was accidental and thus neither illegal nor immoral . 
  i would n't advice against cooking just because you might accidentally injure someone while doing it . 
  but if you do , i think you are somewhat responsible for their situation . 
   where do you live that it 's legal to kidnap and mutilate someone because they stabbed your friend ? 
  right now , i 'm living in the world of * your * analogy , where doing this is the only way to save your friend 's life . 
  in the original analogy , the `` stabbed violinist '' is supposed to be the fetus , not the mother . 
  i think his condition is at least somewhat comparable to that of a fetus , although there are of course limits to every analogy . 
   then you do n't think that people have a right to bodily integrity . 
  i do , that 's why i think stabbing someone should be punished . 
  if you violate another person 's right to liberty and lock them up somewhere , the government will ignore your right to liberty and lock you up in jail . 
  if you destroy another person 's property , the government will ignore your property rights and force you to pay up . 
  please note that these are not meant to be analogies to sex and pregnancy any more . 
  in fact , i feel like we 've digressed quite far . 
  i have nuts in my pants . 
  you 're still just fighting straw men . 
  nobody i 've ever met was in any way opposed to abortion because they thought of pregnancy as a deserved punishment . 
  at least consider the possibility that there are people who oppose abortion not because they want to punish the mother , but because they * do n't * want to punish the child . 
  i certainly do n't want to punish women ( nor men ) for having sex ; the sexual liberation has clearly made the world a more enjoyable place to live on . 
  of course not , that 's why it 's called `` imagining '' . 
  go ask dudesan to go and find you a single case of a famous unconscious violinist who was plugged to another person 's circulatory system . 
  [ pidgezero_one was , i assume , talking about * real * organ donations - the stab-then-donate argument was part of an analogy . ], 
  about strawmen : i think you 're the one beating one . 
  there are quite a few opponents of abortion on / r/atheism , but i do n't think a single one of them is opposed to birth control . 
  at the very least , i 'm not . 
  pregnancy is a ( possible ) * consequence * of having unprotected sex . 
  i do n't think of it as a punishment , and i do n't want to punish women ( or men ) for having sex . 
  read dudesan 's original analogy again . 
  i 'm not imagining anything about the legal system , i 'm imagining the case of a person being kidnapped by the society of music lovers because they are the only person who can save a famous violinist 's life . 
  i 'm only adding to this thought experiment the fact that this person ( in one way or another ) put the violinist in a situation where he needed saving in the first place . 
  i 'm not claiming that there really * is * a society of insane music lovers . 
  to be fair , we get more distracted when * actual * boobs are introduced , and that 's almost always by a woman .

  it seems weird that the hands in the picture are not numbered `` in the same direction '' . 
  on the one hand , the thumb is right next to the wrist - on the other hand , all the other fingers are between wrist and thumb . 
  does anybody know if this is true , or just a mistake in the picture ? 
  in case this was a serious question : 87 years . 
  it 's a reference to lincoln 's [ gettysburg address ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gettysburg_address#text_of_gettysburg_address ) . 
  @ `` first post '' : i think you did it right . 
  there 's an interesting thing *** on tvtropes *** . 
  you never link there without a warning !, 
  these are both correct . 
  notice that the article is capitalized in the first version ( because it 's already a capital letter in the original title of the book ) , and is lower case and outside of the quotation marks in the second case . 
  i do n't think you should mention it yourself .
