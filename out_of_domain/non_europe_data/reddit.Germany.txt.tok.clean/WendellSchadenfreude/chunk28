  however , they are likely gon na ask about it , and then you should be honest . 
  do n't boast about how much they loved you and how much they 're offering you , but yeah : you want to work in this field , so of course you applied at every company that works in this field . 
  the alternative , that your childhood dream has alwayws been to work for company x , and company x * only * , is rarely believeable . 
  nonsense !, 
  you obviously have no idea what you 're talking about !, 
  what a vile defamation !, 
  germany is n't filled with swedes at all . 
  when the british say `` poll tax '' , they mean a tax per head . 
  this has nothing to do with the american `` poll tax '' that had to be paid so that you were allowed to vote . 
  uh , that is * good * . 
   right , but even romans knew about it as like , a celestial body , or some shit yeah ? 
  nope , only as a god . 
  have n't seen it either . 
  no problem understanding the quote . 
  thatcher 's poll tax had nothing to do with `` disenfranchising '' anyone . 
  and that was your claim . 
  this tax did n't * stop * poor people from voting against her , it * made them * do it . 
  west germany is best germany !, 
  * friends * will still be popular in ten years . 
  did n't sansa tell cersei about ned 's plans as well ? 
  this thread is perfection . 
  ok , mine was still a friends reference , the same episode everybody else was talking about . 
  ( `` gum would be perfection . '' ), 
  if yours was as well , i 'm not getting it . 
  the mental image of bill clinton receiveing oral , if he were in thatcher 's current state , would be quite disturbing . 
   stolen elections via the poll tax, 
  completely nonsensical accusation . 
  1 ) this was not an american style poll tax , it had nothing to do with the right to vote . 
  2 ) the poll tax was only introduced * after * the last time thatcher had been elected . 
   `` a friend to pinochet and an enemy to mandela - nuff said . '', 
  i 'm trying to find out how thatcher can be said to have been `` an enemy to mandela '' . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premiership_of_margaret_thatcher#apartheid ) , they sure had some disagreements , but she always tried to get him released from prison , and mandela `` spoke of his respect for thatcher , even expressing disappointment that she would not be ` the very first person i would see ' on release from prison . '', 
   energy subsidies are very common , so it would make sense to compare the level of subsidies involved . 
  [ i can only talk about german subsidies . 
  i 'm just guessing that they are/were similar to those in the uk . ], 
  subsidies for mines are n't really energy subsidies - they were only used to lower the price of domestic coal to that of imported coal . 
  scrapping all mining subsidies does not ( or barely ) increase the cost of electricity generated from coal . 
   busy struggling to earn a dollar, 
  pound . 
  thatcher could very well have been elected again , there is no term limit . 
  if the poll tax helped the tories , john major would n't have abolished it * immediately * when he came into power . 
   the poll tax was designed to keep poorer communities poorer . 
  if you believe any democratic politician - even thatcher - ever thinks like this , you 're never going to understand politics .

  all these laws are only legalizing the use [ + transport , possesion of small quantities ] of marijuana , right ? 
  are there any efforts at legalizing the production as well ? 
   it would take 7 or 8 hours just to drive out of his state . 
  some shitty roads , eh ?

   in one of my memrise vocab courses , monday is taught without a `` der '' whereas tuesday and thursday are taught with the `` der '' in front such as `` der dienstag , '' or `` der donnerstag , '', 
  that 's weird . 
  the articles are used in exactly the same way for all days of the week .

  koreans of reddit , is [ sic ] there any cultural , social or political differences that remain today between north and south korea ? 
  i mean , come on : surely it 's just minor differences that get completely blown out of proportion , right ? 
  also : west germany is best germany !, 
  you know , i 'd really like to know that . 
  most turks in germany speak turkish at home , even after several generations in germany . 
  [ source : gut feeling . 
  not backed by statistics . ], 
  obama held a speech at the brandenburg gate himself ( during his first campaign ) . 
  did not speak any german , though , iirc . 
  [ `` people of the world , look at berlin !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-9ry38ahbu ) [ this is quoting a famous german exclamation at least , [ `` ihr v\u00f6lker der welt , schaut auf diese stadt !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vcxojnka9e ) ], 
  arbitrary of course , but i think it makes understanding easier .

  i want to see if * fully * legalized ( same as alcohol ) , but the way this is happening now might be the best strategy to get there . 
  legalize private use , wait for ~ ten years , and everybody gets used to legal marijuana and will wonder why on earth people are persecuted for providing legal products . 
  so , when your father said it , i 'm guessing it was in turkish ? 
  somehow this makes it even funnier to me ... 
  / r/lanl _ german, 
  / r/germany, 
  / r/de, 
  these are all ( grammatcically ) correct . 
  one for east germany , one for west germany , and one for sorry-i-have-no-idea . 
  edit : having two makes sense , because one is * about * germany , but in english . 
  but / r/deutschland and / r/de are both in german . 
  you might argue that / r/deutschland is in german * and * about germany , while / r/de simply is in german , but about everything . 
  in reality , though , it just does n't make much sense . 
  yes , although i think that `` ich konnte deutsch '' would almost always feel more natural . 
  ca n't really find a good example in which i 'd use `` ich habe [ sprache ] gekonnt '' at the moment . 
  [ i could still speak chinese when i moved to tokyo , but then it got all crowded out by japanese . ], 
  or something like that . 
  baby do n't hurt me !, 
  oh my god , it already exists ... 
  ah , that does n't sound strange to me at all . 
  but it 's * konjunktiv * , not * perfekt * . 
  very slightly so . 
  if we 're talking about backflips , i 'd go with `` h\u00e4tte ich das gekonnt '' . 
  but if you used your version in a normal conversation , i 'm not sure i 'd even notice this as unusual . 
  [ and i 'm easily annoyed by wrong grammar in most cases . ],
