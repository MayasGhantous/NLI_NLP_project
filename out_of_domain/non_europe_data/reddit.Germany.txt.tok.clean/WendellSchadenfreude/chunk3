  niem\u00f6ller 's `` they '' already came for both americans and non-americans . 
  speaking out against any of this is a good start , speaking out against all the rest can come later . 
  i 'm german , and i approve of the americans-first approach . 
  it 's good realpolitik . 
  i agree , although it does get rather complicated . 
  first off , so that we all know what we 're talking about , the exakt names of the two works ( which i 'd never heard of before - yeah , i 'm a philistine ) are : `` der goldne topf '' and '' \u00dcber das marionettentheater '' . 
  so i 'd write your sentence like this :, 
  but that 's only because it 's the frst time that you mention them , so you have to give the exact titles . 
  if it was somewhere else in the text , i 'd go with either, 
  same goes for this sentence :, 
  i 'm not exactly sure if this shortening of the title is allowed in an academic text ; but it 's the way that i 'd prefer . 
  i agree , especially the `` dann behaupte ich '' does n't work at all . 
  right ? 
  i might believe you that this is an optional comma nowadays , but i 'm quite certain it 's ( also ) correct with the comma . 
  here , i think this explains the rule :, 
  [ my tl ; dr : if you write the sentence with `` um '' , you have to use a comma . 
  if you leave out the `` um '' , you 're still alllowed to ; and i think you should . ], 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't think either of your suggestions actually translates one of the english sentences . 
  honestly , the `` du kannst dies tun '' - sentences do n't even sound like correct german to me . 
  i do n't think you can really translate this construction ; you have to find a new german sentence for every example . 
  my suggestions in these two cases would be :, 
  ii really depends on the context , might be something like :, 
  but as i said : the construction does n't survive . 
  edit : constructions with `` indem '' might be your best chance for a universal translation of the construction . 
  - works as well . 
  only one thing that really caught my eye :, 
  after a semicolon , you do n't start with a capital letter ( unless you have to for other reasons ) . 
  i 'd prefer a colon ( doppelpunkt ) here , anyway - but you 'd still use lowercase after that . 
  ok , one more thing that nobody adressed :, 
  why does the text start with `` hallo '' ? 
  is it supposed to be a letter or something ? 
   i was assuming he meant these sentences to be a one-time use , which would lean towards `` als '', 
  no , you 're not . 
  unless the original title actually started with a lowercase letter ( very rare ) , you definetly leave it at capital letters . 
  for all those too lazy to do the math :, 
  that 's one call every 2 minutes and 24 seconds ; 7 minutes 12 seconds on `` graves '', 
  just to make sure , you do know what 's going to happen around midnight , right ? 
  this is a serious question , i once had a visitor from korea over new years . 
  he kept asking when we would be going to see the fireworks everybody kept talking about , and seemed really quite scared when it finally started - everywhere around us . 
  edit : also : just stay in hamburg ; with some germans if possible . 
  watch * dinner for one * , do some molybdomancy ( yep , i had to look that one up ) , eat some raclette . 
  what , you want him to only watch alfred tetzlaff instead ? 
  but that 's so much harder to understand ... 
  if you just google `` media markt kreditkarte '' , you can see that at least he 's not the only customer complaining about their refusal to accept cc 's . 
  another company well know for accepting only cash or ec cards is aldi . 
  i believe this is true for lidl and other discounters as well , so it might just have something to do with `` frugality '' after all . 
  and despite talking about ww2 himself , he also managed to integrate the silly british `` do n't mention the war '' - clich\u00e9 . 
  so , by `` no , it is n't '' , you mean `` yes , that 's it '' , right ? 
  if the government covers all expenses for parents who send their kids to kitas , but does n't pay for e.g. 
  `` tagesm\u00fctter '' , nannies , au-pairs , etc. , that basically means that the government tries to decide how parents should raise their kids . 
  also , there are parents who want to send their kids to kitas but simply ca n't because there is no kita . 
   betreuungsgeld is what *** parents *** get if they do n't send their kids into a kita . 
  ftfy . 
  ok , slow down there . 
  i 'll explain step-by-step what i was trying to say , then we can see if there really was any disagreement . 
  - aldi is * the * most `` frugal '' german company , in that aldi would never waste a cent . 
  - aldi does n't accept cc 's . 
  - therefore : not accepting cc 's might really be a sign of german `` frugality '' . 
  - frugality here means two things :, 
  1 ) most of the customers ( even though they tend to be poorer than the average german ) are n't willing to `` spend more than they have '' by using cc 's - not even for food , not even at the end of the month . 
  thus, 
  it 's only a small minority of people who would even want to use cc 's . 
  2 ) the company is n't willing to pay for a little extra comfort for its customers . 
  are you ok with this ? 
  except of course you still get betreuungsgeld if the mother is working and the father stays home with the kids . 
  or even if both parents are working . 
  the only thing that matters is wether you send the kids to a kita or not . 
  it 's actually quite like private schools receiving public funds for their students . 
  which they do . 
  upvote for the link to the sam harris article . 
  i 'm sure he explains this stuff better than i could . 
  he actually wrote two articles about this , here 's the other one :, 
  it 's not even that much , if you 're only going for an efficient electoral college win ( without a majority in the popular vote ) . 
  half a million votes at most . 
  `` er schl\u00e4ft '' is basically the only correct translation for `` he is sleeping '' . 
  if you want to emphasize that he is sleeping * right now * , you can say `` er schl\u00e4ft ( jetzt ) gerade '' . 
  bottom line : you have to learn some grammar to translate * anything * . 
  books are already subisidized in germany ( reduced vat ) . 
  i was trying to explain , not to convince anybody . 
  the opera example makes it that much harder for me , because i like it so much : the opera should not be subsidized . 
  neither should kitas be . 
  the reason that the opera is funded and jazz bands are n't is of course that opera is considered more valuable - but it 's bad enough that politicans decide what music is best , it 's even worse when they also get to decide what form of childcare is . 
  he had a son ( or daughter ? ), 
  named `` smith '' ? 
   children abraham , john , martin , smith, 
  sorry - changed the picture , is it better now ? 
  maybe we should call them revelations . 
  dammit , where 's julian assange when you really need him ? 
  i think `` reps '' means `` representatives '' here . 
  [ the video shows both dem & gop reps multi-voting . ], 
  sorry , i do n't get this whole `` karma '' thing . 
  i did n't delete anything , though , just replaced the link with one to a better version of the same picture . 
  you accidentally the whole question !, 
   thanks for those informations !, 
  confirmed german . 
  if that were true , the board would say, 
   one nation *** without god ***, 
  it does n't . 
  ( and should n't . ), 
  a recent immigrant being the only real conservative in this thread so reminds me of something ann coulter recently wrote .
