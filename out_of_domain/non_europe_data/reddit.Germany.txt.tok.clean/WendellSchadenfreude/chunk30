   afd has basically a nationalist , `` neo nazi '' attitude , like their opinion on immigrants . 
  that they want an immigration system similar to that of canada ? 
  that they demand the legal right to work in germany for asylum seekers ? 
  that they insist that victims of political persecution should always be granted asylum ? 
  i 'm at a loss for words . 
  i think they agree about this * with all political parties * ( of any relevance ) . 
  even the greens ( afaik ) do n't want to simply invite everybody in the world to come to live in germany . 
  there is only disagreement about how generously we should interprete the term `` persecution '' and ( more importantly ) how big of a problem economic immigration actually is . 
   whereas confident speakers , do the opposite . 
  i love how the extra comma can be interpreted as you pausing for a moment there , conveying confidence . 
  * you 're, 
  ( sorry , my grammar is pretty bad for a grammar nazi . ), 
  nobody enjoys being molested . 
  but whatever it is that she does sometimes enjoy in nightclubs , it 's not in any way relevant . 
  if he molested her , it does n't matter that she sometimes enjoys when other guys do the same things . 
  if he did n't , it 's does n't matter either . 
  even so : his minimum cause is being taken somewhat serious . 
  if you claim you were * falsely * accused of molesting a girl , it 's unwise to start the story by throwing around sexist slur . 
  i have no idea why people are downvoting my comment , i was just giving advice . 
  i 'd be devastated if i cared about my karma . 
  [ edit : i understand even less why people would downvote you . 
  if i did n't care about * your * karma even less than i care about my own , i 'd be devastated . ], 
  some people enjoy stuff that others would call molestation . 
  guess what , it 's not molestation in that case . 
  if i kiss my girlfriend , that 's not molestation . 
  if i kiss you , it might be . 
  i do care about the visibility of my comments . 
  here , i 'll downvote this comment myself . 
  even if that were true : appropriate behaviour in a club is not the same as appropriate behavious in school . 
  if your train is on time , that 's more than enough . 
  also , there are about 2 trains per hour that get you from koblenz to oberwesel , so it 's not a tragedy if you miss one . 
  ( even if your ticket is only valid for the one train - buying another ticket would hurt , of course , but it would n't be expensive from koblenz to oberwesel . 
  ~ 21 $ for a group ticket . 
  [ this is also the ticket you want to have if you want to go for a day-trip to koblenz . 
  `` minigruppenticket '' , up to 5 people , as many trips as you want for one day . ] ), 
  if it 's already a regional train that brings you to koblenz , make sure you do n't get off to soon : the station is `` koblenz hauptbahnhof '' . 
  the one before that is called `` koblenz stadtmitte '' , which sounds somewhat important but really is n't . 
  enjoy your stay !, 
  bold move , doing an ama right now . 
  i respect that . 
  do you think there will be several global krypto-currencies in a few years , or will there only be one ? 
  i 'm wainting for my verification right now . 
  i 'm ~ # 22,000 on the list . 
  any minute now . 
  [ i trust you 've seen mitchell & webb 's sketch about a medieval inventor ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5cr0yyf40 ), 
  came here to say that . 
  then realized that it 's not really true . 
  so you 're transported to england in 1513 . 
  what can you actually tell me about the next 50 years ? 
  anything that is actually useful for you to make a living ? 
  ... or * good * bread . 
  fools . 
  winter is coming . 
  ( always . ), 
  at the current rate of extraction , they have enough reserves for about 70 years . 
  the known resources ( that just ca n't be extreated economically at the current price and technology level ) suffice for another 200 years , roughly . 
  planning further than 50 years ahead is bold and difficult , but sometimes still the reasonable thing to do . 
  planning further than 100 years into the future is only ever worth it for the entertainment . 
  nothing . 
  that 's what he 's saying . 
  the word is of course related to the fascists ( due to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fasces ) ) , and now that i think about it , possibly also to the english '' [ faggot ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipqbsu1jee0 ) '' . 
  england bacause i was guessing that it 's the best place for most of us to be . 
  at least we 'd kind of speak the language , and we ( most of us ) probably know english history in more detail than hungarian or vietnamese history . 
  also , i 'm white , and i 'm guessing a majority here is . 
  if you 're transported to some great plains native american tribe , you would ( probably ) not look the least like one of them , not speak their language , not be able to even find out * where * ( and * when * ) you are , and the only thing you know about their history is that white people will fuck them in a couple of hundred years . 
  also , you might kill most of them with your germs . 
  - i 'd rather be in england . 
  i think most of the famous laconic phrases have been quoted here already , i 'm only missing one :, 
  this is said to have been the reply that leonidas gave the persians before the battle of thermopylae when they demanded that the spartans surrender their weapons - it means `` come and get them '' . 
  it 's still sometimes used as a motto by american gun-right activists . 
  [ obligatory link to the scene where it was used in * 300 * . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltqvrnkr6ug&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=25s ), 
  i can only refer you to [couchsurfing.com ] ( https://www.couchsurfing.org/n/places/cologne-nordrhein-westfalen-germany ) - should be easier finding someone there . 
  i 'd offer you my couch , but it 's in koblenz , still ~ one hour away from cologne . 
  i 'm sure you can find something better . 
  i do n't think `` king size '' beds usually exist in german hotels . 
  the answer i like to hear most when i have any kind of request is `` gerne . '', 
  ( ~ `` gladly . 
  '' ) ; it sounds as if they are really happy to help me out . 
  upvote so more people can see this - it 's hilarious . 
  that 's not what happened , for me at least . 
  i just saw your name in / r/bestof * twice * and actually liked both of your comments , so i decided to have a look at what else you wrote . 
  and it was worth it . 
  russia is blatantly * cheating * , getting two additional borders just from [ kaliningrad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_oblast ) . 
  pretty sure he said * liberal-biased * , not liberal-based . 
  * so * glad i 'm not the only one . 
  you 're a terrible nerd , though !, 
  they are pretty much interchangable . 
  stick with `` passieren '' , `` geschehen '' can easily sound too poetic or bombastic . 
  i do n't think anybody mentioned joint venture 's [ song about holland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmpsmvb3lsy ) yet . 
  captures quite well how germans normally like the netherlands , but `` solang 's um fu\u00dfball geht , hasse ich holland wie die pest . '', 
  [ `` when it comes to football , i hate holland like the plague . '' ], 
  maybe [ croatia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia ) is where the lost colonists * really * went ... 
  so do a lot of gay men . 
  he is in the settlers of catan card game . 
   fun fact : police first started to doubt the phantom theory when they `` found '' the dna in multiple bodies that had to be identified after severe traffic accidents . 
  oh , she was * good * ... `` make it look like an accident . '', 
  i 'd say definitely read them , but there 's no hurry . 
  maybe give adwd some time to sink in , go read the d&e novels when you 've run out of other stuff to do .
