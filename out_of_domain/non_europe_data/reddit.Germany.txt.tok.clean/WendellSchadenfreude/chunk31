  if i 'm not mistaken , does n't also it also place emphasis on ` being traffic ' as oppossed to the process of ` becoming traffic ' . 
  for example , `` i have become traffic ... '' is slightly more focused on him , in that moment , becoming traffic where-as `` i am become traffic '' focuses on his being of traffic , or trafficness as i call it . 
  so , one focuses on the moment of the action , the other focuses on the action itself . 
  the adriatic belongs to our dear italian friends , we could never take what is rightfully theirs !,

  i completely ruined a frying pan with this , and the food did n't really look like anything anymore . 
  just slimy coalm , shaped somewhat like pasta . 
  very similar and somewhat more interesting : my roommate once left on the hotplate at maximum heat over night without anything on it . 
  when i opened the kitchen door the next morning , i was engulfed by a wave of at least 60 \u00b0 c ( 140 \u00b0 f ) hot air . 
  and it was n't just the air : the entire kitchen , furniture , walls , and everything , was hot to the touch . 
  the hotplate itself was a bright shiny orange . 
  we left the window open for hours , because whenever you closed it , the room would be uncomfortably hot again within minutes .

  oh no , do n't say that . 
  say something like this :, 
  `` i feel we would all benefit from concise communication , that 's why i am trying to give the best answer to your question , not just the fastest one . 
  i 'm sure your company could benefit from my patience and my attention to detail . '', 
  it 's so confusing that this expression is used ironically about 50 % of the time in tv series ... 
  i think it 's actually worse than that , or better - hard to decide . 
  a bayonet does n't ( usually ) kill a man the instant it penetrates him , he rather bleeds to death in the long , painful minutes that follow . 
  my guess is that people stabbed by a bayonet mostly feel * surprise * , followed of course by * pain * . 
  i heard the problem was caused ( partly ? ), 
  by the 1992 * energy policy act * . 
  it regulated , among other things , the amount of water `` per flush '' that toilets are allowed to use .

   for example , in lord of the rings gandalf refers to the balrog as `` du '' ; but presumably he 's not on friendly terms with the demon , so should n't he have referred to him as `` sie '' ? 
  gandalf addressing the balrog as `` sie '' sounds more hilarious than any other case of du/sie-confusion i have ever heard of .
