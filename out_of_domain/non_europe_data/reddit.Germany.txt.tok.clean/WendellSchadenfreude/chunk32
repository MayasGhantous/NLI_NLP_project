  [ well , ... ] ( http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/37218263.jpg ), 
  can someone please explain the word `` flakey '' to a poor confused german ? 
  even after reading most of the comments here , i have no idea what these women are like , and i 'll become a 29 year old male in a few months ... - i have to know it !, 
  leo.org claims the word does n't even exist . 
  nope . 
  that one always reminded him of how he was assassinated by einstein in 1924 . 
  oh ... the last message i got , only a few minutes ago , was to cancel a date that was planned for tomorrow . 
  does that count , or does it have to be last-minute ? 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  for a moment , i thought this was morse code ... 
  negative . 
  get out of there , it 's gon na blow !, 
  is there something like this for other years , too ? 
  i do n't know if this is obvious , but i 'll explain it anyway :, 
  they are calling 200 lightyears `` our reach '' because we developed radio a little over 100 years ago . 
  ( they are just very generously calling it `` 200 years '' . 
  although 100 might be more precise if you are even a little strict about what you call a radio . ), 
  radio was the first kind of radiation produced by mankind that could be detected by an alien civilization . 
  so * if * anyone is out there listening , if they are outside that little circle , they ca n't have heard a word from earth yet . 
  if someone lives on the edge of the circle , it will still take a while until they could theoretically pick up the first radio waves sent by people like hertz or marconi - and if they do and they decide to answer , it will take 200 years more for their answer to reach us .

  copied from donald brown 's [ human universals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_universals ) . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  but you 're * faaaast * . 
  and confusingly honest . 
  but an honest one , and funny at that . 
  also , you are not entirely wrong , my comment was kinda off-topic . 
  the two things darrkman mentioned are universals , * and * they would in fact be hard to explain to aliens ( unless they happen to do something similar ) . 
  `` why are you talking nonsense with that tiny human in a high-pitched voice ? '', 
  i watched the video , and judging from the picture at 0:50 , he does look like at least one of his parents if middle-eastern . 
  i 'm not saying people like that ca n't be `` real europeans '' . 
  but if this is the `` most european '' person they could find , then i 'd agree that these fighters are n't really europeans , but badly integrated immigrants . 
  just because you ca n't do it does n't mean it 's not part of your culture . 
  i ca n't do magic , either . 
  yeah , i was wondering about that one , too . 
  ( wiki does n't offer an explanation . ), 
  i guess all traditional societies had beliefs in rain dances or something similar , and nowadays we actually * have * some primitive means of weather control , but i think there were some human societies that had neither - which would mean it 's not a universal . 
  maybe were just missunderstanding it ... 
  ooh , definitely . 
  just to spell it out for everybody : `` no woman no cry '' means `` no , woman !, 
  do n't cry ! '', 
   the title and main refrain , `` no woman , no cry '' , is entreating a woman not to cry . 
  it would be rendered `` no , woman , nuh cry '' in jamaican patois . 
  the `` nuh '' is pronounced with a short schwa vowel ( a `` mumbled '' vowel , often represented as `` uh '' in spelling ) and represents a clitic ( `` weakened '' ) form of `` no '' . 
  it is the equivalent to the contraction `` do n't '' . 
  the song is about growing up in the ghetto and persuading a woman that things will get better . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_woman,_no_cry ), 
  that 's kinda funny - it 's not what anybody was expecting . 
  ( can i bother you for a source ? ), 
  better than italy . 
  i 'm pretty sure the most common interpretation ( more common than the correct one ) is : i do n't have a woman , so i have no reason to be sad . 
  as in `` no woman *** = *** no cry '', 
  ( yes , that is quite stupid . ), 
   i 'm pretty sure the most common interpretation ( more common than the correct one ) is : i do n't have a woman , so i have no reason to be sad .

  leopard ii , according to wikipedia :, 
  as an additional answer : most germans do n't know this , either . 
  most german military vehicles are named after animals . 
  ( i think this started in wwii with the `` tiger '' panzer . ), 
  leopard , skorpion , wiesel , keiler , puma , marder , ozelot , b\u00fcffel , jaguar . 
  not all names can be equally impressive ... , 
  this has nothing to do with evolution . 
  this is one individual ape learning a new behaviour , not the change of inherited characteristics over successive generations . 
  clever . 
  did n't even notice the typo , was very confused by the picture . 
  very observant of you , and exactly the right picture . 
  too easy in german :, 
  glad to see that somebody else already asked my question . 
  somehow , this makes it a little less remarkable , because we are so used to different breeds of dogs being hardly similar too each other . 
  emphatic denial . 
  `` you keep saying that , but i absolutely *** was n't *** with a hooker last night . '', 
  ( imo the most basic meaning of the sentence , without any special twist . 
  just emphasis . ), 
  damn , this sounds interesting . 
  i 'm mostly replying so that i will remember to do this at home . 
  put some effort in it . 
  the guy who said `` yes '' at least capitalized the first letter and ended the sentence properly with a period . 
  this is much more effort than i anticipated . 
  i had to upvote both your comments to reward this . 
  regarding context , i have to admit that i 'm sadly not qualified to lead an interesting discussion about this topic . 
  i 'm hoping for someone else to reply to your statements . 
  maybe we can get / r/linguistics or / r/mapporn to draw us a map highlighting the different words for broccoli in every european language . 
  similar to what they did for [ cucumbers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m0ghvy6.png ) and [ oranges ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/ba351a2d7fee42388e34084ae7e6cf6f/tumblr_mlhqkycfie1rasnq9o1_1280.png ) . 
  my thought exactly . 
  this map is still nice , but the one you 're proposing would be much more interesting . 
  [ wikipedia has a global map like this .

  from [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_by_country ) article . 
  if you want to piss him off ( posthumously ) , call him webbster or webber or something . 
  do you also have a system for keeping track of people who replied to you ? 
  read the same story about noam chomsky . 
  probably both not true . 
  i think it really might be because aldi is so efficient and puts pressure on the entire industry .

  they mean nothing relevant . ), 
  you know how annoying it is how binding your shoes always takes * forever * when you just want to go play outside for a minute ? 
  daddy is going to the mall now , and if you want to , you can come along and we 'll buy you some new shoes - i know , shopping is * boring * , but listen : these shoes would have velcro strips , so you 'd never have to tie them again !, 
  yes , yes , justin bieber also wears velcro shoes - i think that 's because he ca n't tie them properly , but that 's not relevant now .
