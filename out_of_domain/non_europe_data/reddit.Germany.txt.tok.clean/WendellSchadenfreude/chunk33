  `` relevant '' . 
  it means ... ah , nevermind . 
  just look at this picture : you see this word , d - a - y ? 
  it means `` day '' . 
  the picture tells you that if you have to bind your shoes five times a day [ * point at the top row , where it says `` 5/day '' * ] , and it takes you one minute every time [ * move finger down to the `` 1 minute '' row * ] , then you would still save time if the shoe shopping took us *** six whole days *** !, 
  can you imagine that ? 
  six whole boring days at the mall , ha-ha !, 
  but do n't worry , it 's really not going to take more than a few minutes , and i 'll get you some ice cream when we 're done . 
  edit : by the way , i know that this would only be true if little atlantis69 could wear the same shoes for the next five years . 
  but he does n't know that , and he needs some new shoes anyway . 
  would benefit from also using the roman calendar , years since the founding of the city . 
  yes , i was simplyfing by assuming that it takes zero time to `` tie '' velcros . 
  the overall time spent on a task is not important , only the time shaved off . 
  as always , the southern european countries have it worse . 
  poor spanish journalists will actually have to suffer through this * in the stadium * !, 
  since we 're talking about usernames :, 
  haha , you ca n't get a job !, 
  [ what did you say ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfxvs2jf2du&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=79s ), 
   also , since greece thought it was a good idea to elect an extreme right party and the italians elected that idiot again , people get this `` well , it 's your own fault now ! '', 
  attitude . 
  what idiot ? 
  the extreme right party in greece ( assuming you 're talking of the `` golden dawn '' ) received less than 7 % of the vote ... 
  you mostly get answers from hardcore fans in here , so let me try to get your expectations to a more realistic level :, 
  at least the first season is very highschool-y . 
  watching it as an adult feels kinda silly . 
  still a good show , though . 
  in case people do n't understand why such a map might be interesting at all :, 
  long-distance busses were * illegal * in germany until very recently . 
  they are completely new for us . 
  i 've used long-distance busses before , but only in foreign countries . 
  episode 3 , which season ? 
  with a giant sword . 
  but * this * is not the sword . 
  ... [ the sword is my penis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=julyx-wzih8 ) ... ( sfw ), 
   but if there 's one inalienable fact we all know , it 's that girls can not throw . 
  also , the fact that people think `` inalienable '' just means something like `` fundamental '' or `` important '' . 
  ( `` inalienable rights '' are not simply `` important rights '' , they are `` rights that are not alienable '' , i.e. 
  they ca n't be taken away or transfered . ), 
  please let that `` corporations are people '' meme pass away calmly . 
  that poor ugly missunderstood cripple does n't do anybody any good . 
   also : if you 're required to put it on there , then the consumer does n't have the choice to buy the unlabeled can . 
  that 's only true if you require the qr code for * all * products , even the ones not using gmos . 
  why do n't you link to the comic directly ? 
   the reality of farming is that many of the desirable traits are lost when the plants are allowed to freely reproduce . 
  could you explain to an interested layman how seed companies produce enough seeds for farmers to buy and use ? 
  do they just have giant fields where there somehow is no `` free reproduction '' of the plants ? 
  [ questions out of honest interest , btw . 
  not a trap or anything . 
   ` medical advances, 
  is that short for * medical advances from ` merica * ? 
  i 'm not getting married tomorrow . 
  op , what state are you ? 
   unless you 're one of the first few people to see the fake quote you can just as easily be fooled because of all the false hits that will turn up once it 's been repeated enough times . 
  that 's where i think this is different from the sagan/hitler quote thing : it gives a precise source for the quote , albeit - obviously - a wrong one . 
  if you google `` exodus 6 4 '' ( or any other bible passage ) , the first hits will always be pages that show you the * actual * bible , not some made up `` quotation '' that others fell for . 
  `` i also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan , where they resided as foreigners . '', 
  the hitch witch . 
   i would keep doing that for life . 
  would n't they confiscate the knife ? 
  making bomb threats at an airport might last longer for free . 
  i live in the city of koblenz , germany . 
  population before the event 100,000 . 
  on the day of the event , everybody around me is dying , so i 'm probably quite distressed and confused . 
  i try calling my family , but all of them sadly are dying , too . 
  infrastructure is still intact , but since nobody in the world knows what is happening , this does n't help me much . 
  the next morning , i wake up in a ghost town . 
  is anybody else still alive ? 
  koblenz is a university town , but reddit is n't that popular in germany , so there may or may not be a few more survivors , but likely no more than three or four . 
  to me , the city looks completely dead . 
  electricity is already off by now , so most of my ways of contacting the rest of the world are gone . 
  i have a battery powered radio . 
  there are probably some working stations in america - do you think i could receive them ? 
  i 'm assuming i ca n't . 
  food and water is no problem , of course - but i need to find more people !, 
  for all i know , i might be the only person alive in the world ... 
  i steal a car , drive around the city , blowing the horn every once in a while - if there are other redditors , this should be enough to find them . 
  either with them or alone , i drive to bonn to find my family - all dead , i 'm afraid . 
  i search bonn for more survivors , then drive on to the larger city of cologne ( 1m people ) . 
  surely , there must be a few survivors there . 
  wild guess : somewhere around 20 people . 
  together , we steal a power generator from some abandoned hospital , set up a few computers and try to get to the internet - i do n't know why , put all survivors seem to be somewhat nerdy ... 
  my long term plan is to go where most of the world 's remaining population lives : the usa . 
  i guess i 'll try to learn flying a plane from some flight simulator , then steal one at the cologne airport and fly over to you guys with all survivors who want to come with me . 
  what we find there , other people in this thread will have to tell you . 
  why are n't there more serious answers to this question ? 
  people put far more work in the scenario of everyone above the age of 5 dying , which i found far less interesting . 
  if we have a vote on it , barack obama definitely is the undisputed leader of the world for now . 
  do you think / r/conservative and their friends will stay calm ? 
  they do have most of the guns , after all ... 
  the virus kills humans , only . 
  it was probably created by the cats ... 
  sorry , that 's really not attractive at all . 
  there 's plenty of food * everywhere * , for now at least . 
  europe is still the safest place to live , but i guess america is the only place with a large enough population to rebuild * anything * . 
  i 'm in germany , i 'll try getting to england first - maybe the us later . 
  so no point in setting up r/virus \u00fcberlebende , i guess ... 
  england - by car , through the tunnel . 
  i 'll steal a car and drive until i 'm low on gas , then steal another one . 
  simply search empty houses for car keys , should n't be too hard .
