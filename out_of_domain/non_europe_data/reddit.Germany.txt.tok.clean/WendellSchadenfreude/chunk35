  i really do n't see how our history is relevant to this question . 
   aximander of miletus, 
  i think the general theme of new atheism is the search for truth and objectivity , but that 's more of a sidenote . 
  when it comes to violence , religion can be compared to racism : there have been both good and bad rulers who were not racists , and there have both good and bad rulers who were racists . 
  still , racism obviously gives a ruler an additional reason for being evil . 
  getting rid of racism would make the world an all-peaceful place . 
  but it would diminish the near infinite number of reason why people kill each other by one . 
  what period ? 
  influential in what way ? 
  for germany , or internationally ? 
  has n't this already been decided ? 
  walk in circles in escher 's staircase . 
  it wo n't solve your problem , but it will at least buy you some `` time '' . 
  mind if we talk to them for a moment , just to hear more sides of this story ? 
   which has a fair amount of support in afghanistan , pakistan and iran . 
  it looks to be building a fairly strong base within syria too by supporting the rebels . 
  iran does n't seem to fit in this list . 
  iran is currently fighting against al qaeda in syria . 
  even in iraq , they were temporary allies at best . 
  are they biting each other 's fingers , or each their own ? 
  in the latter case , i fear you have no right to intervene . 
  is that `` shouting match '' the `` nullification crisis '' ? 
  is that worth reading up on ? 
   i live in germany close to the dutch border . 
  i go there by train fairly often, 
  explanation for the americans :, 
  that means he 's a pothead . 
  well , i mean , that was just , like , my opinion , man . 
  the edl they are refering to is the * [ english defence league ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_defence_league ) * . 
   i ca n't believe i never realized that things like this are just an action , intention has nothing to do with it . 
  how do you determine who raped whom ? 
  if the two of us walked into a room and just started tearing each others ' clothes off , how do you know what game i was playing when i flipped the coin ? 
   guys get drunk and sleep with a fat chick , haha that 's a hilarious comedy movie , they brush it off and go on . 
  but for girls there could be major , life-changing , society-shaming consequences if they do n't remember to use condoms and birth control , and remembering and enforcing those kinds of things tend to go out the window when even just on the tipsy side . 
  if he gets her pregnant , that 's life-changing for him , too . 
  if she gives him aids , that 's life-changing for him , too . 
   too drunk to really struggle or be coherent, 
  the scenario was two equally drunk people . 
  if i is still sober enough to fuck anyone , then i should still be able to struggle * at all * or to say `` stop '' - if i actually did either of these but he did n't stop , then yes , i 'd consider it rape . 
  [ if all i did was say `` stop '' or struggle very ineffectively , then this would end up as my word against his , of course , so he 'd go unpunished . 
  i do n't think anything can be done about that . ], 
   there is a difference between consent and not . 
  if she consents under circumstances that she also consented to , then i do n't see how you can possibly argue that it 's *** not her fault *** . 
  i know some people who will accuse you of being misogynistic for talking about `` fault '' here . 
  i think it 's rather fussy , but not entirely wrong : when you say that it 's `` her fault '' , you 're blaming the girl for getting drunk and having sex . 
  as long as both parties were just silly-drunk but not blacked out or anything , the point is not that `` it 's her own fault '' , of course , but rather that it 's nobody 's fault because nothing wrong happened . 
  really ? 
  i do n't mean to insult skyfarer , his comment was interesting and insightful , but he really only pointed out why girls might have more reason not to want to have drunk sex . 
  that may be true , but it does n't mean we should view a girl who still decides to get drunk and get laid as a rape victim . 
   i do n't care if the attacker is 3x as drunk as the victim . 
  you should care if there *** even is *** an attacker and a victim , or just consensual sex . 
  i do n't think anyone in this thread ever argued that raping an unconscious person should n't be considered rape `` because they did n't struggle '' . 
  but when two people are both drunk and decide in their drunken state that they want to have sex with each other , i do n't see how that turns the sex into rape and makes one of them a criminal and the other one a victim . 
  * gasland * is really not a reliable source . 
  you 'll remember how people in that movie lit their tab water on fire , right ? 
  the gas in the water [ had nothing to do with fracking ] ( http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/frack_nation_w2iegtptkm0cit5ejyzjho ) . 
  i actually get angry because here in germany the common attitude seems to be `` hey , it might be legal , but it 's immoral ! '' . 
  if it 's legal , it 's fine . 
  it 's not the company 's fault if the laws are shitty . 
  you ca n't expect them to voluntarily pay higher taxes than they have to . 
  tactically speaking : it might be . 
  chemical weapons would probably be very effective in a battle like this one . 
  but using chemical weapons this way would be next to impossible to hide . 
  assad might just as well kill himself as use chemical weapons . 
  you throw around `` they '' as if `` they '' were all the same person . 
  apple did * not * set up the tax laws . 
  companies are not the referee in the tax game . 
  i 'm just saying that if you do n't voluntarily pay more taxes than you have to , you should n't complain about apple not doing this either . 
  nope , it 's not . 
  use mapfrappe.com , that 's where dontgotsemembro got his maps from . 
  has greenland really , or is it just colored as part of denmark ? 
  quoting manyballs :, 
   it 's the reverse of what women do the morning after clubbing and a one night stand . 
  cause they normally wear heels , so they do n't really want to wear them the next day cause heels are apparently a pain in the ass to wear . 
  edit - that does not work as intended ... 
  so how many donations per 1000 population do you need ? 
  or is there no such thing as `` enough blood '' ?
