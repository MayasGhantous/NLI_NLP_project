   [ ... ] there not . 
  they 're not even close . 
  how did this happen ? 
  getting one `` they 're not '' right , but not the other ?

  i 'm just curious to see wether sansa only betrays him to his death , or if she wields the knife herself . 
  hide that spoiler !, 
  i want the non-readers to be as surprised as i was when this happened in feast .

  because of the sheep skin , i 'm pretty sure it 's jason , but i ca n't find the particular sculpture .

  edit : nevermind , you were talking about [ this guy ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xwzs2#xwoet0l ) , right ? 
  sorry , i meant the first one , obviously .

  the clothes are incredible , but to be honest : i still think they look somewhat weird and less realistic than the face . 
  if bernini were alive , i 'd pay him to make a nude version of that sculpture .

  yes , yes - that must be it .

  the o needs to be a capital letter , else you 're talking about [ holmium ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holmium ), 
  unless you produce your own ammo , too , that does n't help much . 
  memorize has only eight letters , calculate has nine . 
  that is important in this sentence .

  same with polish in the dortmund area ( the ruhrgebiet ) , in the west . 
  people today always assume that the poles only came there in the ~ 1950 's , but they 've been there much longer . 
  also , people have to open the thread to find the link to the picture . 
  if the top comment already tells you why the linked picture is crap , there 's no way around that comment anymore . 
   a sprinter who exists is faster than one who does n't exist . 
  i think this is the point where descartes would have disagreed . 
  it 's easy to imagine a sprinter who is faster than usain bolt . 
  such a sprinter might not exist , but that 's not in any way a problem . 
  god , on the other hand , is per definition the greatest thing that can possibly imagined . 
  since every thing that can be imagined * and * is real is `` greater '' than any thing that can only be imagined , god must be one of the things that exist . 
  this is not true for the fastest imaginable sprinter - he might exist in imagination * only * . 
  or so says descartes . 
  i do n't find it very convincing either , but it is worth thinking about for a moment .

  and why is he being downvoted for it ? 
  sweden has a weird system where paying for sex is illegal ( thus red in the map ) , but * being * paid for sex is n't - prostitutes work inside the law . 
  this would have been such a nice map for / r/redactedcharts . 
  in short : being rich is far more important than the legal status or prostitution . 
  same as with taxing and regulation any other activity ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand the question ... 
  same as restaurants . 
  chefs/prostitutes report how much money they make , pay taxes accordingly . 
  if the authorities think they are lying , they might send someone to roughly count customers . 
  if they think the restaurant/brothel is working with illegal immigrants , forced labor , child labor , or is otherwise violating regulations , police might show up . 
  i find this immensily interesting . 
  could you give me some catchwords to help me find more on this on wikipedia ? 
  impossible to say . 
  look at the chinese : the long periods of stabile empires were n't always the times of huge scientific advancements . 
  weird . 
  they can really be called `` swedish democrats '' in english . 
  wanted to correct you to `` sweden democrats '' , but you were n't even wrong . 
  same story as with sweden : selling is legal . 
  buying is not . 
  also , there are of course places in the us and other countries where prostitution is illegal but you can easily find prostitutes . 
  still not sure i get it . 
  nevermind , off to rewatch [ doctor who 's epic rap battle against doc brown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdj7gvc_dsa ) . 
  quasi-officially the one subreddit for all memes that would previously have filled / r/atheism . 
  the memes did n't go away , they can all still be found here :, 
  i 'm not sure everybody is aware of this , so i like posting this link everywhere . 
  not sure yet how i feel about the change . 
  memes are a good `` gateway drug '' , maybe it was n't such a bad idea to make them the one sort of content that was presented to every new member of reddit . 
  but let 's give it a week at least . 
  when you feel like seeing some atheist memes , go here :, 
  it seems some people are n't aware that the memes still exist , so i like posting this link everywhere . 
  well , that was the problem . 
  we did n't have both , because it 's almost impossible for a news story to get hundreds of upvotes quickly . 
  might be possible for the most sensationalist articles , but those are n't the ones we want to see either . 
  ( images are here now : http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceatheists/ ), 
  i 'm always dissapointed when people post links to exiting subreddits , and then these subreddits do n't really exist . 
  i 'm almost certain i would have loved a subreddit about fucking boring things . 
  do n't you think it 's possible that you have simply become a better player ? 
  i do n't have tog yet , but playing without it , i have conquered more land than this within 200 years , starting out as some lowly basque count . 
  i hardly think those are overpowered . 
  i think one day i might try a challenge : play an entire game without pausing . 
  has anybody tried that ? 
  you might also try starting as a vasall duke to the byzantine empire first , somewhere in a save spot in greece maybe . 
  play for ~ 50 years , learn who 's who , observe and analyze what the emperor does , then start a new game - this time with you as the emperor , trying to do better . 
  this is * so * important !,
