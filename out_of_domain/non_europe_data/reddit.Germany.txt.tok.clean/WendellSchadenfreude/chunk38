  how did op ever find a decent match without knowing this ? 
  find people everywhere , women , unmarried , my religion ( usually ) , not in prison , sort by rank/diplomacy/stewardship . 
  or sort by age , look for 15-20 year olds only if you want to be relatively certain to produce some offspring . 
  i assumed green meant `` no data '' ... ( but that grey , of course ), 
  of course , the folks at redactedcharts would have solved this within seconds . 
  but they do that with more difficult maps , too - i have no idea how they do it ... 
  your link is borked . 
  currently at -15 . 
  also showing an interesting psychological phenomenon . 
  maybe the example is n't that good after all . 
  imagine you have two groups of people , a and b , and you ask everyone in these groups two questions . 
  for group a : how many inches are in a foot ? 
  at what age did gandhi die ? 
  for group b : how many yards are in a mile ? 
  at what age did gandhi die ? 
  the questions are obviously unrelated in both cases , but still : group b will guess a higher age of death for gandhi . 
  i do n't think they were talking about * phone * numbers . 
  ... or were they ? 
  did n't buy them yet because you lack time or because you lack money ? 
  or other reasons ? 
  pm me a delivery address and a link to your amazon wishlist , and you 'll get something to read . 
  i think others are better . 
  ( justin bieber vs beethoven , romney vs obama , ... ), 
  if you liked this one at all , check them out as well . 
  most of them are n't cute at all ... :(, 
  firefighters . 
   i had it upside down . 
  are you sure it was n't the artist who had it upside down ? 
  it 's hard to tell with abstract art , and he was french : some confusion is to be expected . 
  hodor hodor for dor gogol gogol ? 
  hodor ? 
  [ i 'm so sick of people writing `` hodor hodor '' everywhere . 
  but it seemed kind of appropriate here . ], 
   a heresy of which religion ? 
  all of them !, 
  it 's better than hot dogs !, 
   want pictures as direct links only on certain days ? 
  this is a great idea , albeit a bit complicated . 
  friday-monday : old r/atheism , with lots of sheltering suburban mums and stuff, 
  tuesday-wednesday : new r/atheism , lots of long videos and discussions , memes only in `` sub-subreddits '' ( / r/adviceatheist ), 
  this would definitely take a while to sink in , but it turns r/atheism into more of a front page for all atheism-realted subreddits , which shows new users they way to either / r/trueatheism or / r/thefacebookdelusion or both . 
  i think this is absolutely worth a try !, 
  ( also , do n't let anyone get you down : all of you mods are doing a good job , each in their own way . ), 
  beautifully written , yet it leaves me wondering : when was the last time you actually wrote a letter ? 
  yeah , i 'm gon na need to see those pictures first . 
  just to verify your story , of course . 
  yeah , i love mapfrappe , but it still seems to mess up everything close to the poles . 
  [ compared to mother russia !, 
  hahahaha !, 
  hahahahahaha !,

  are we talking about kazimir malevitch 's installation [ * white on white * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f1stuuw.jpg ) ? 
  damn , has nobody even bothered to have a look at the article ? 
   sure , carrots and many other foods do contain beta-carotene , which metabolizes into vitamin a and everyone agrees that is essential for maintaining eye health , but it does not improve it . 
  if you are not consuming enough vitamin a , any number of sources could help restore your vitamin a supply . 
  carrots themselves are not unique or magical in this way . 
  in fact , carrots have less beta-carotene per 200 calorie serving than red peppers , kale and lettuce .

  i 'm german . 
  i * love * that guy . 
  made this [ mirrored version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5emb69t.jpg ) instead , which also has a very special twist . 
  in case you [ do n't see it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i3yfw4j.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not even sure if the artist intended this ... 
  [ edit : i guess he did . 
  it just fits too perfectly . ], 
  as a dumb european , i have to ask this : being `` denied your diploma '' only means that you do n't get it during the official ceremony together with all your peers , right ? 
  you still * get * your diploma , you only have to go pick it up at some office ? 
  what 's up with liechtenstein ? 
  austria and switzerland are at less than 1 , liechtenstein at more than 5 ? 
  always have been . 
  have n't we ? 
  how so ? 
  the rate is higher than in any other major western country . 
  australia , nz , pretty much all of europe , japan ... 
  ... what 's a transcript ? 
  she still gets documents proving that she went to this school and graduated successfully ? 
  - * ok , found the translation . 
  ... is there still anything that a diploma is actually good for if you have your transcripts ? 
  debatable . 
  in any case , does n't really matter in this context : japan is one of the countries the us should use as a benchmark . 
  not angola or myanmar . 
  i 'd still go with `` debatable '' . 
  japan and south korea are at the very least quite different from all * other * western countries . 
  [ i say `` debatable '' , but i 'm not really interested in debating this here . 
  if you are : sorry ...  ], 
  ok , still seems to work really well . 
  the big problem i encountered was when trying to get an outline of antarctica . 
  care to try and make one ? 
  well , just in time :, 
  / r/atheism becomes the sub-frontpage for all atheism-related subreddits . 
  problem solved . 
   as the first line in their top-level reply, 
  the * first * line . 
  not the * only * line . 
  does n't really matter , this is n't strictly speaking a poll . 
  his answer was very good either way .
