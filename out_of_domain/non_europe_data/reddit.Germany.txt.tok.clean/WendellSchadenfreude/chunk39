  i think this comment is funny . 
  still , i think it should be downvoted into inobservability ( if that is a word ) , because at least in this thread , content should beat humor . 
  the * approve * - fraction at least should agree with this , i think .

  i take it you do n't believe the changes they are talking about even exist ... 
  this subreddit did n't evolve into what we see now . 
  it was * intelligently designed * exactly this way at four o'clock this afternoon .

  this is an interesting comment that actually contributes to the discussion . 
  usually , i 'd just upvote it and move on , but relevant comments are so few in this thread that i 'd like to point them out .

  you really should n't `` fix '' r/atheism when you are *** in *** r/atheism . 
  people usually do this on purpose , because unnecessary links break the flow of a comment for the reader .

  i 'll assume the quotation marks mean that this comment has basically nothing to do with ... well , anything . 
   was n't there an official poll on this yesterday, 
  i do n't think so . 
  could you point out where you think this `` official poll '' happened ?

   edit : please upvote / u/periodicthinker for visibility . 
  he has set up an independent audit of the votes here . 
  please do n't . 
  this is n't a poll , this is a survey/feedback thread . 
  it 's absolutely meaningless that there 's a bunch of people who post * nothing but * `` reject '' . 
  i do n't think there 's a single post that says nothing but `` approve '' - makes a lot of sense , if you think about it , that the people who want to make this subreddit more `` complicated '' wo n't post one-word answers . 
  these statistics are fringe-interesting , but meaningless . 
  if you 're the kind of person who prefers memes and facebook posts , you 're also the kind of person to post one-word answers ( `` reject '' ) , as a frustratingly large group of people did in this thread . 
  if you want this sub to be more thought-provoking and complex , posting one-word answers ( `` approve '' ) does n't make much sense . 
  only posts that give at least a semblance of a reason should be taken into account at all . 
  does n't really matter , this is n't a poll . 
  it 's a survey/feedback thread - only contributions with a minimum amount of content are relevant at all . 
  still : nice catch . 
  a very impolite way of expressing your opinion . 
  you are talking to real human beings . 
  i think this opinion could have been expressed without insulting anyone . 
  even mods are * people * , you know ? 
  thousands of people who have * nothing at all * to say , but feel the need to post *** exactly the same thing *** over and over and over again - these people are the very reason why r/atheism was changed . 
  think about it !, 
  wether they approve or dissapprove : do n't ever let a faceless mass of humanity determine your self-value . 
  you are more important than the little number next to your user name , and your opinion * can * be a lot more relevant . 
  now , this is a reason . 
  could you edit your original post to say `` reject '' and then give exactly this reason ? 
   many are posting `` reject '' with their reasons . 
  and some of these posts are interesting and relevant .
