  ( yes , i somtimes read ann coulter . 
  i also read robert reich , so please do n't `` downvote by proxy '' . ), 
   try asking a recent immigrant :, 
   -- how do you feel about abortion ? 
   it 's taking a life . 
   -- what should we do about criminals ? 
   lock them up and throw away the key . 
   -- do you support raising taxes ? 
   no , the government takes too much already . 
   -- how do you feel about overpaid , well-pensioned government  workers with no-show jobs ? 
   it ticks me me off . 
   -- do you support gay marriage ? 
   absolutely not . 
   -- how are you going to vote ? 
   democratic . 
  alighiero is an italian first name . 
  sorry , it only has a wikipedia article in italian : http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/alighiero, 
  if i understand correctly , it says that the name is derived from words ( possibly ) meaning roughly `` noble warrior '' . 
  alighieri is comparable to `` son of alighiero '' . 
  the word `` allegory '' was already used in ancient greece ; here 's an ebook referencing a few antique authors and their use of the word . 
  ( it literally means something like '' ( language ) different from that used in the market '' . 
  allos ( all - ) ~ different ; agora ~ market , forum . ), 
  upvote for using the mean examples `` university '' and `` hour '' , where `` university '' starts with a vowel , but not with a vowel * sound * ; while `` hour '' does start with a vowel sound despite the first letter being a consonant . 
  i do n't know why gr8white is being downvoted , though , because the emphasis thing is also kinda correct . 
  `` the biggest building in this town is the university . '', 
  ( the = theh ), 
  `` harvard is * the * university of the east coast . '', 
  ( the = theeee ), 
  when using all-caps , you should replace '' \u00df '' with `` ss '' . 
  the sentence `` ich will fussball heute abend spielen '' sounds a little weird to me . 
  it 's possible germans might say this sometimes , but `` ich will heute abend fussball spielen '' still sounds better even if you want to put extra emphasis on the `` fu\u00dfball '' . 
  ( in that case , you might also say `` ich will * fu\u00dfball * spielen heute abend '' . ), 
  using the plural `` informations '' is one of the most typical mistakes germans make in english . 
  `` danke f\u00fcr die informationen '' ist einfach `` thanks for the information '' . 
  [ speculum and fimcotw seem to think that my comment was mean . 
  i 'm sorry if you felt that way as well ; i did n't mean to be rude . ], 
  i agree . 
   btw i find your comment more witty than rude , so dont worry, 
  so do i !, 
  but i always feel that way about my comments ( this one for instance ) , so maybe i 'm not the best judge of wit and rudeness . 
   all germans are familiar with the epic poem , the song of the nibelungs , which recounts the tale of the beautiful , invincible br\u00fcnhild , her suitor gunther and the dragon slayer siegfried . 
  i wish that were true .

  you do n't argue with pidgeons , you play chess with them !, 
  how do atheists genuinely explain the first cause without the supernatural ? 
  `` god '' is no explanation at all . 
  saying that god created the universe and god simply always existed is in no way more logical than simply saying that the universe itself always existed . 
   `` if anything now exists , either something must be eternal , or something non-eternal emerged out of nothing . '', 
  actually , i think there are at least two more possible answers . 
  - time is not really a line , but a circle . 
  - time ( and space ) only started with the big bang . 
  asking what was `` before '' that does n't make any sense , since there was no `` before '' . 
  it 's like asking what was in all the free space `` around '' the big bang - there was no `` space '' , there was no `` around '' . 
  [ please note : i do n't mean this as a scientific explanation of the big bang . 
  i 'm not a physicist . ], 
  interesting idea , although it quite certainly does n't explain much for the top 1 % . 
  ( those are actually rich people . 
  you do n't get rich by having fewer children . ), 
  do you have any data on this ? 
  probably cancer . 
  it still feels to me like meeting people was actually easier in the old days . 
  when i agreed on monday to meet a friend in front of the travel agency next to the library on thursday afternoon , 4pm - we 'd both be there at that time . 
  if he was late , i would wait for him , and vice versa . 
  nowadays , we 'd only agree to maybe meet sometime thursday afternoon , but we 'd still talk/text two or three times on thursday just to check if the date still stands and what exact time were going to be there . 
  is n't there an `` and '' somewhere in the original text ? 
  in that case , you could just skip the stuff you do n't want to quote with '' [ ... ] '' . 
   `` debating societies , lecture series , [ ... ] and literary journals '', 
  just google `` music + taliban '' for more information . 
  ( and it 's not just the taliban , most extreme muslim groups are prejudiced against music . ), 
  http://www.rawa.org/music.htm - the censorship of music in afghanistan ( pre 9/11 ), 
  `` during the five years of taliban rule in afghanistan , music was banned . 
  if religious police spotted a music cassette in a driver 's car , they would pull him out onto the street , beat him and destroy the tapes . 
  there were public burnings of music tapes . '', 
  of course , looking at my own source once more , i have no idea how reliable `` mcclatchy newspapers '' really are . 
  sorry to act the grammar nazi , but `` diety '' annoys me almost as much as `` athiest '' . 
  the latin/greek word is deus/theos , the `` e '' is the first vowel in both cases . 
  de-it-y . 
  a-the-ist . 
  it 's a great picture . 
  do you know what animal that is ? 
  she 's great . 
  wafa sultan . 
  i want to watch more of her videos . 
   i love her to death and would kill anyone to prove to her i want the very best, 
  ahem ... really ? 
  at the time of the conversation , the hoping was already done and over . 
  `` he '' was n't hoping anymore , probably because the `` schreiben '' part was also already finished . 
  but he had been full of hope in the past . 
   which i can be dead with . 
  ftfy , because i like the wordplay . 
  well , almost . 
  `` i just hope some mullah decides to not go fatwa on her . '', 
  means that you hope there will be at least * one * mullah somewhere who does n't . 
  even if all others do . 
  `` i just hope no mullah ... '' means you hope there wo n't even be a single one who does . 
  which sounds more like something you might be hoping for . 
  she is married , btw , and has kids , too . 
  you do n't really deserve an answer , but like most of the folks on / r/atheism , i 'm a generous person and will give you one anyway . 
  the question really is n't when life starts . 
  when you take antibiotics , you are killing millions of living creatures - bacteriae .
