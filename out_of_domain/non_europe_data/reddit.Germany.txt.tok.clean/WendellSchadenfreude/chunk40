  many many more posted nothing but the word `` reject '' ( or possibly the word `` approve '' , though i have n't seen this yet ) . 
  this only highlights that there are many people around who fail to recognize the value of * content * . 
  lovely . 
  tell me if you ever want to talk about it . 
  look , this is progress !, 
  half-an-hour-ago-you might have asked `` do you even internet , asshole ? '', 
  i 'm so proud of you !, 
   you want to remove from the would be expected to fail, 
  remove from the what ? 
  i like you . 
  i think you wanted to be mean to me , but that does n't really matter . 
  sorry , i might not reply to you any further , my inbox is flowing over ( and reading all these messages is * oh so difficult * ... ), 
   this thread only called for a `` reject '' or `` accept . '', 
  actually , it did n't . 
   as the first line in their top-level reply, 
  `` as the * first * line '' kind of implies that there should be a second line . 
  i do n't reject easily-digested humor . 
  your impersonation of me was brilliant . 
  no , i think i meant `` impersonation '' . 
  there might be a language barrier here ( english is n't my first language ) , but even with the help of a dictionary , i 'd still say that you were n't so much `` describing '' me, 
   wendell is a sad , humorless excuse for an atheist . 
  he keeps his cave darkened at all times and is only ever slightly amused by feeling superior to others . 
  as * impersonating * me :, 
   `` what ? 
  just reject ? 
  no lengthy , pompous , pointless explanation that can be found a few comments above yours !, 
  semi-moron , you will never achieve the high-minded superiority of the true atheist who rejects easily-digested humor ! '', 
  i do n't think they are . 
  jij asked for this to be `` the first line '' of a comment . 
  not for it to be * the only word * . 
  in any case : if these posts are there only to be `` counted '' , they should be downvoted so that other post ( with actual content ) get some visibility . 
  [ thank you for your contributions !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iupuqq5wsyw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=56s ), 
  much better . 
  i 've withdrawn my downvote . 
  i still disagree with you , but i think you are a decent human being . 
  this blows my mind ... 
  you linked to three ( reject - ) comments with actually relevant content yourself , and now you 're telling me they should n't be taken seriously ? 
  as a sidenote , i think if this was a poll , it would have been called a poll . 
  you are talking to real-life people here . 
  think about that . 
  they are going to die either way , and everyone and everything they ever loved is going to perish , too . 
  there 's no reason to insult them . 
  tell that to the [ giant tortoise ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4k-l1hlj9nk#t=95s ) , almost extinct because it was so delicious . 
  ( qi link , very amusingly tells why they did n't have a scientific name for 300 years . ), 
  or better yet , [ the dodo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dodo#relationship_with_humans ) , actually extinct . 
  or the formerly most common bird in north america , the [ passenger pigeon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passenger_pigeon ) . 
  edible , extinct . 
  this is depressing . 
  now to really drive it home , can you give us a rough estimate of the percentage of treatments that * do n't * make it from phase i to phase ii/iii ? 
  just to be sure i get this right : [ this is day 1 ] ? 
  not bad . 
   1 a : a usually formal expression of opinion or will in response to a proposed decision ; especially : one given as an indication of approval or disapproval of a proposal , motion , or candidate for office, 
  there was no * proposed decision * , no proposal at all in that mod post . 
  the decision had already been made , it was a feedback thread . 
  ( also , off topic : i find that definition weirdly broad . 
  i checked with other dictionaries , but they seem to agree : when i ask wether you want some ice cream , your answer is an expression of will in response to a proposed decision and thus a `` vote '' . ), 
  sort by `` controversial '' , repeat . 
  if there 's 1000 people on reddit debating ice cream , there might be 500 who strongly favor chocolade and 400 who strongly favor vanilla , plus 100 with no strong opinion ( or a preference for rarer flavors ) . 
  if there 's an equal percentage of chocolade and vanilla people who do n't care about the quality of a post but downvote everything they do n't agree with , this will result in the first 500 post almost exclusively favoring chocolade . 
  even if they include * nothing * but the word `` chocolade '' . 
  the reddit voting system can make every narrow majority look huge . 
   an old meme , and one of the best posts i 've seen in years !, 
  the changes have been in effect for less than a week , and they 've already brought you the best post you 've seen * in years * , and you *** reject *** them ? 
   the proposed decision was the change made by the mods , which was the subject of the vote . 
  that is purely your interpretation and not backed by anything in jij 's post . 
  [ it 's here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/ ) , in case you want to have another look at it . 
  also , please stop insulting me . 
  we 're all friends here . 
   at the time among the jews , the number forty was n't generally used to signify a specific number , per se , but rather more used as a general term for a large figure . 
  good editing . 
   people are down-voting because they do n't want people to know there 's an appeal going on ? 
  or because they think that this is n't particularly interesting ( for whatever reason ) and should n't be ranked this high in our sub . 
  ( i did n't downvote . ), 
  easy fix : post [ meme ] in the title of meme posts . 
  can even be done automatically by the bot . 
  i 'm not saying it is irrelevant ( as in : it should be removed , like posts about gardening or chess that have nothing to do with atheism ) , i 'm saying people who downvote it probably just do n't think it 's interesting ( enough ) . 
  there 's no reason to assume malice . 
  ( of course we 're all interested in the future of / r/atheism , almost by definition . 
  there 's still lots of reasons why people might not be interested in reading about this `` appeal '' . 
  if it matters to you , i think your post is well made ; but i still would like to see posts about other topics higher up than this one . ), 
  still counts , night is just the dark side of the sun . 
  [ robert fortunes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_fortune ) travels through china . 
  at the time it was still illegal to export tea from china or share any knowledge connected to the cultivation of tea with foreigners . 
  fortune spent several years in china , sometimes disguised as a chinese merchant ( which worked despite the fact that he did n't speak any chinese language ) , and brought tea from china to india and thus the british empire . 
  lol - / r/bestoff actually exists . 
  it 's a very small subreddit with the motto : `` it 's / r/bestof , dipshit '' . 
  because he wanted to be active as a `` normal user '' . 
  ( he said something to this effect elsewhere . ), 
  never masturbated , right ? 
  very calming . 
  you do n't have to stride through the vastness of the ocean , you 're practically shooting fish in a barrel . 
  this is one of my least favorite memes , and i still think your post is great . 
   ( 3 ) yes , i know , there 's a typo in australia . 
  and in nambiia . 
   i 've been upvoting comments that are for or against , to get that conversation on the front page . 
  you feel there 's not enough posts about this on the front page already ? 
   but your experiment is contaminated by people who upvote posts like the title indicates, 
  that 's not contamination , that 's the subject of the experiment . 
  well , this is n't a strict scientific experiment , of course ; it 's mostly for entertainment .
