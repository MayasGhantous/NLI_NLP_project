  how long are you visiting ?

  these are n't simply * reposts * , these are * classics * . 
  i even think they deserve being posted about once a week , but maybe best not as seperate posts . 
  no matter what rules apply for this subreddit in the future , i think we should post this collection from time to time . 
  in any case : not relevant to this thread . 
  i 'd ask you to remove it , actually . 
  you think the ancient greeks look stupid ... ? 
   it is considered a goal worthy of sending their children to die for , in search of gloried martyrdom for the sake of sayyida zaynab , the prophet muhammad 's daughter and the woman considered to be the jewel of his household , whose members the shiites revere and consider rightful heirs to the caliphate . 
  i do n't understand why they 'd make such a stupid mistake despite the fact that they linked to the wikipedia page themselves : zaynab was mohammad 's granddaughter , not his daughter . 
  ( of course , just a small sidenote to this article , not really relevant to the topic . 
  but still ... ), 
  thx . 
  [ also edited my post . 
  this thread should be about helping her * if * she is serious . ], 
  the subreddit you 're looking for is called / r/adviceatheists / . 
  if you want to spend even less , try couchsurfing . 
  sweden is * expensive * , leave as quickly as you can after seeing stockholm . 
  if you click the `` submit meme '' link in the sidebar , that forum is where you are redirected . 
  that 's basically part of the `` coup '' . 
  i suppose many users * are * in fact posting their memes over there . 
   yeah , thing is , i would love to teach in germany but it would take years and years of hard work and even then would be looked down upon anyway considering i can just go teach in my country . 
  also , teachers in germany are n't payed that well unless they are `` beamte '' . 
  unless you have a german citizenship , you ca n't become one . 
   limit the amount of personal information you initially share . 
  this is a bit complicated because the comlete opposite is also true : when you meet someone , you want to have some personal information that identifies them as a real person - i.e. 
  their name and adress , preferably . 
  the thread in question is about a ~ ~ typical date rape scenario . ~ ~ first date rape scenario with a relative stranger . 
  this scenario does n't seem likely any more if you have some sort of information that would allow the police to easily find the other person . 
  address in this case does n't necessarily mean your exact street , but enough that law enforcement could track you down . 
  * this particular * case was one involving a stranger * and * were only discussing how to act in relation to strangers ( as in : people you 've so far only `` met '' on okc and are only now starting to meet in real life ) . 
  you 're not trying to keep away as much personal information as possible from your * friends * . 
  all of it ? 
   as a final point , the first wave of people whose jobs will completely cease to exit will be drivers ( truck drivers , taxi drivers , potentially pilots and other large machinery ) and we should start seeing that in the next ten years or so . 
  i 've spent so much time thinking about the consequences of self-driving cars , and somehow i completely missed that point . 
  self-driving cars basically are ( technologically ) available already . 
  once they become legal , truck drivers and cab drivers will be out of work - almost all of them , and very abruptly . 
  well , he did give a tl ; dr. 
  if you do n't like it , i suggest you instead focuss only on the one example he spends some time talking about :, 
   the first wave of people whose jobs will completely cease to exit will be drivers ( truck drivers , taxi drivers , potentially pilots and other large machinery ) and we should start seeing that in the next ten years or so . 
  i think this might be true . 
  self-driving cars are basically not a future technology anymore , they are available * today * . 
  once they become legal , truck drivers and cab drivers will be out of work very quickly - all of them , basically . 
  a racist police department might still side with him based on the other guy 's ethnicity . 
  ( not saying this is the case , of course . 
  but it 's not illogical in and of itself . ), 
  well , this was only in place of a tl ; dr. to quote the next few sentences : ( my emphasis ), 
   they 're an interesting case for a few reasons . 
  the first is that they will be replaced almost whole sale , as opposed to seeing efficiency gains incrementally making us need fewer and fewer drivers , meaning one day there are virtually no self driving cars and the next each new car is self driving . 
  *** this is much , much more sudden shift than what happened during the industrial revolution which took place over the course of 60 years , giving people generations to move into different sectors of the economy . 
  *** two , because it 's whole sale and sudden , this will be much more visible and less esoteric than some software which reduces the amount of effort it takes a white collar worker to preform some task or some robot which frees up wielders to address the areas that take more skill . 
  its visibility will drive a public conversation we have n't had before . 
  finally , because this is a group of people who are generally economically disadvantaged ( or , at the very least , not privileged ) and generally are n't well educated , retraining them is going to be difficult , and they 're unlikely to find jobs that pay as well if they are able to find jobs at all . 
  also , this was posted in the * singularity * subreddit . 
  they are only concerned with the very sudden changes they predict to happen when we reach the `` intelligence explosion '' . 
   ( i 'm talking 18pk a day ), 
  what 's does `` pk '' mean in this sentence ? 
  ( sorry if stupid question ; german . ), 
   to be fair , typical date rape is from someone you know . 
  if we 're talking about first time meeting someone , then we 're talking about an atypical date rape scenario . 
  it 's the one we 're talking about , otherwise the advice to `` limit the amount of personal information you initially share '' is just nonsensical . 
  in cases of first time meeting someone , not sharing private information makes you safer from stalkers , but less safe from sexual assault . 
  edit : btw , things like google voice , as mentioned by nvwlsnmnm , might be a very good way of exchanging `` private '' information - stalkers ca n't make google give up you actual phoe number to them , but the police can . 
  ( do n't know much about google voice , do n't know if it could easily be cancelled out by basically using it in combination with throwaway cell phones or something . 
  but the basic mechanism is a good idea . ), 
  i 'm not afraid of the future , i think it will be wonderful . 
  still : technological breakthroughs of the future are likely to have some dramatic socio-economic consequences , and they wo n't always be for the ( short-term ) good .

  oh wow , this is depressing ... 
  i told you i posted your meme in adviceatheists . 
  [ it 's now one of the top 10 posts in that subreddit ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceatheists/comments/1g1eo9/what_if_ujij_is_actually_is_actually_a_theologian/ ), 
  am i looking at the wrong page ? 
  most of the post in reddit.com/controversial/ are clearly from / r/gaming . 
  i did . 
  still : / gaming . 
  with the two-click policy , i think most memes would benefit from having the first line in the title already ; and/or you could already tell which meme it is . 
  helps people to avoid reposts - and there 's real horror , only finding a repost after oh so many clicks . 
  this is fricking annoying if you have 10 + holdings by the same foreign power somewhere in your realm , but can only ever claim one of them in each war ... 
  in your case , maybe your lucky and their liege lord only holds titles in one duchy ( other than these three baron level titles ) . 
  in that case , declare holy war on him ( since he 's a muslim ) , and when you win , these three baron level vasalls become independent . 
  you still need three seperate wars to claim all of them then , but you can declare all these wars at the same time .
