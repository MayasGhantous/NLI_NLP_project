  i did n't notice that myself . 
  i 'm pretty certain it was like this in megalophobia 's original post already , although we ca n't check that anymore . 
  so many mistakes in one meme , and it 's still quite successful . 
  i 'm not certain now - he can start a hw for leon , of course , giving him the other counties . 
  but i think this wo n't give him control of the holdings within counties that he already controls . 
  ( it certainly does n't work if the muslim ruler of leon is n't also the liege lord of these holdings , which i ca n't tell from this screenshot . ), 
  good to know . 
  i 'll repost it next week . 
  obama is visiting germany , not the other way round . 
  and that part of the article actually was true . 
  wow . 
  that is powerful . 
  whenever i control a bigger empire , i think the most annoying messages are the ones about some random duke joining a faction , thus bringing it up to ... still less than 5 % of my power - * i do n't care !, 
  i always find this a little disappointing . 
  i assume you did n't just arrest him out of the blue , but had to put down a rebellion . 
  if this is the case , he should just have hired * all * the mercs and made your life hell . 
  exactly . 
  uh , hellenic religion !, 
  i want to play that !, 
   moved the counties of loon and julich from de jure cologne to luxemburg, 
  loon i can understand , but what did julich ever have to do with luxemburg ? 
  that 's more average than usual . 
  above-average average , though not the averagest i 've ever met .

  greetings , fellow human !, 
  i have used my fingers and my brain to create [ this picture ] ( link attached ) of the rules that should be compatible for you to access the information using your eyes . 
  i hardly needed the help of a computer . 
  their conspiracy is no danger for us . 
  enjoy all the rest of your life !,

  `` there is no such thing as bad weather . 
  there 's only bad clothing . '', 
  `` very unique '' absolutely makes sense . 
  everything in this world is unique in one way or another . 
  a fast food restaurant might be unique in that it 's the only mcdonald 's on sixth street in springfield , minnesouri . 
  that 's something unique about it even if there 's 200 mcdonald 's in that town and half a dozen other fast food places on sixth street . 
  it 's unique , but it 's clearly not as unique as the eighteenth century swedish-moroccan sushi beer garden next door . 
  this really is the same shop as the one yesterday , right ? 
  it has the same `` big deals '' signs , and sansa is still wearing the same clothes and carrying the same bags . 
  well , i guess you deserve the same praise as your colleague : no hover hand . 
  well done . 
  could have been improved by writing it from the perspective of your straight brother . 
  `` when your ultra conservative dad approves of your gay brothers relationship but not of your straight relationship, 
  it 's time to dump her . '', 
  makes it easier to understand . 
  there 's hardly anybody . 
  less than 1 % . 
  i mean , i 'll make jokes about this myself , and many people will . 
  but nobody is serious about this . 
  i think the biggest group of people who might actually wish this are some die-hard communists who wish there still was some sort of reformed gdr . 
  that would mean they are more likely to be from the east , but seriously : even most communists/socialist are happy about the german unity . 
   i do n't see him having a chance as a direct candidate . 
  especially not in halle . 
  of course not . 
  [ here 's the 2009 election results ] (, 
  it was contested only between the cdu and the * linke * . 
  * linke * candidate petra sitte won , and she 's her party 's candidate again this year . 
  this makes things very hard for the spd ; no matter who their candidate is . 
  well , `` holy shit '' might be a bit much . 
  but there 's about 500.000 black germans . 
  500k/80m means that 1 in 160 germans is black , so in the 620 member bundestag , you 'd expect on average 4 black members . 
  that 's really the answer to a very different question . 
  `` was the gdr government ( at least partly ) justified in building the wall ? '', 
  vs `` should we rebuild it ? '', 
  i do n't understand your question/suggestion . 
  her capitalization freaks me out . 
  not just `` the holocaust '' , which would be strange enough , but `` the holocaust '' , like it 's a movie title . 
  [ he 's got whole world ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guyrerfscb8 ),

  everything that 's extraordinarily big and fatty . 
  yes , but it proves that it happens * naturally * . 
  and everyone who 's interested knows this , of course , but some people still seem to be surprised when they hear it and can be convinced that * all * climate change is natural . 
  or even more true than this : we simply do n't know what exact hand gestures the romans used . 
  imagine someone in fivehundred years reading about `` high-fives '' . 
  unless they find videos of it , they 'll never know what exactly that looks like . 
  ( do you spread your fingers ? 
  `` five '' sounds like you do . 
  `` high '' , is that shoulder high , or as high as you can reach , or is it only a metaphor ? ), 
  also , the roman empire existed for several centuries . 
  hand gestures may have changed slightly over time . 
   based on circumstantial and physical evidence, 
  the only possible `` evidence '' would be contemporary texts . 
  they exist , of course , and they mention something with thumbs or hands and movement , but reconstructing the exact gesture is impossible at least from the text fragments i 've seen . 
  i have n't seen many , and it 's very well possible that i have n't seen the best ones , but i do n't think there are any real * descriptions * . 
  the authors were concerned with other things than describing the details of a hand movement that all their contemporary readers were familiar with . 
  if there are no good descriptions , then you can be as well studied as you want - you 're still just guessing . 
  i can confirm this . 
  not yet over . 
  i liked a game that i started as the one basque vasall of the king of castille . 
  being a different culture than your liege adds some difficulty in the beginning . 
  become inddependent , take over castille or navarra , expand against the muslims , form hispania . 
  mihael is only a little boy . 
  this is outrageous . 
  we need to put an end to the tyranny of king glorkcakes !, 
  invasion !,
