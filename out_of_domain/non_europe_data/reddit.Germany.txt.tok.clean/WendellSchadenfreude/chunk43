  ... why does this exist ? 
  and why is it for toxlab only ? 
  this should be the top comment in this thread !, 
  `` x of castille has declared castillian war for castille on y of castille . '', 
  how did that ever happen ? 
  [ oh , that 's right - like this ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1f339h/iberian_peninsula_language_shifts_fixed_complete/ ), 
  probably too late for that , but *** yes *** . 
  also , link here to this new comment , so i can upvote it . 
  [ enjoy the tear gas ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkuo942mgi4 ) , zur melodie von * enjoy the silence * . 
  yes , yes , of course - but what does the sign say !, 
  nice . 
  how and when did you start ? 
  looks like one weird game , where pisa , croatia and the * knights templar * are three of europe 's most powerful nations ... 
  so , no more big events , and at some point , everybody is at maximum technology - any other downsides ? 
  in case anybody else does n't know the song ( or is too lazy to search for it ) . 
  [ relevant part ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awegsyuehe0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=221s ), 
  it 's much easier when you 're not in an all-catholic region like britain . 
  just conquer some heathen lands via holy wars , and give them to claimants or heirs of * other * lands . 
  if claimant , press their claim next . 
  if heir , assassinate title holder . 
  no matter which side wins , i do n't think an autonomous kurdistan , if it were to come , would include aleppo . 
  yeah , i also used to do that via dynasty tree - it 's horrible !, 
  switch to character search , at the bottom right of the screen , the icon showing two little people . 
  there , either do as pcrackenhead suggested ( sort by dynasty ) , or search your realm for men , non-imprisoned , non-ruler , probably your culture and religion , great house ; then sort by diplomacy or stewardship and scroll down until you see someone of your blood . 
   you want a vision of the future ? 
  imagine a billion tiny legs stomping on a human face : forever . 
  this alone would have sufficed to make yours a brilliant comment . 
   how many terrorist attacks have taken place in germany ? 
  i really dislike this line of arguing , because there 's another side to it . 
  when a terrorist attack actually happens , many people demand that * something must be done * , and all the rules should be changed as quickly as possible ... 
  instead , we should always ( wether there has been a recent attack or not ) * think * about what kind of attacks could happen and ~ ~ what kind of surveillance might stop them ~ ~ . 
  edit : let me somewhat rephrase that - ... what kind of attack could happen , what the mildest form of surveillance is that would stop them , and wether we think this is worth it . 
  why would they need to fly in from afghanistan ? 
  it 's not like they do n't have enough crazy friends * in * germany . 
  last time muslim extremists * tried * a terrorist bombing in germany was in december 2012 , at the bonn train station .

  [ greenlandic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenlandic_language ) , according to wiki , has been greenland 's only official language since 2009 . 
  it 's an eskimo-aleut language , not related to danish .

   who 's old ? 
  you 're old !, 
  you know , that really sounds like one of those stories grandpas tell sometimes where you ca n't be sure wether their youth really was this strange , or if they just forgot to take their meds and are now confused . 
  looks cool , too , but i do n't think that 's what loki was talking about . 
  it 's from the 70 's , kiddo !,

  a few weeks ago , there was a thread on askreddit , [ what makes europeans hate gypsies so much ? 
  are they really that bad ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ ), 
  when i saw that , my first thought also was : `` we do n't hate them . '', 
  opened the thread , was overwhelmed by an astonishingly intense hatred . 
  so , yeah , the two of us seem to be wrong about this : europe does hate gypsies . 
  that 's an opinion in the spirit of this thread !, 
  i wonder if you 're right about this . 
  i think in the end , our european racism is just different and ca n't be compared quantitatively to yours .

  i think most bullies actually grow out of it but never realize they were being assholes . 
  i 'm a real life european . 
  that 's what the `` we '' refered to . 
  nah , this was in 1914 , long before schr\u00f6dinger 's thought experiment .

  do both parties still support that embargo ? 
  do they have a official reason that makes at least a little sense ? 
  do they have a political ( tactical ) reason at least ? 
  ( i heard something about exile cubans who support the embargo - something about them ? ),

  i do n't think i ever heard of you or read any of your posts , sorry . 
  i just thought the transcriber only really works on directly posted links , not on comments . 
  since this comment was high up , i thought mobile users etc. 
  might still like a transcribtion , and the funniest way to make one seemed to be an imitation of the transcriber . 
  wish i had stuck more to its normal format , but i could n't find the bot .
