  yes , adventurer invasions are actually a good thing to happen . 
  peasant revolts are only annoying , but adventurers always give you a little money at least ... 
  * points at the door * - not a very smart employer anyway ... 
  another way of converting to christianity is by taking some poor christian girl as your concubine . 
  with a christian wife or concubine , you can always decide in the espionage screen that her pillow talk has convinced you to her faith . 
  can i learn that in an hour ? 
  relevant xkcds :, 
  if anything , he 'd have to kill her * before * the child is born . 
  but if he wanted to do that , there would have been no need to divorce her first . 
  `` conceived '' , that makes for an interesting follow-up question !, 
  the game only tells you that your wife is pregnant three months * after * conception . 
  did paradox include a message that only shows up if you somehow managed to divorce your wife during these three months [ when you do n't know she 's pregnant yet ? 
  surprised nobody mentioned [ replay ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/replay_%28novel%29 ) yet . 
  great novel ( short enough for a lazy weekend ) about a 40something who dies to find himself being 18 again . 
  i learned about this book from reddit , and i loved it . 
  the only single-trait courtier i ever had was an elusive shadow . 
  * very * elusive . 
  too lazy to check them out myself , sorry . 
  i 'm guessing the tl ; dr is : these accounts are all older than the ama , and they look `` normal '' - is that correct ? 
   question 9 by / u/hmlee . 
  account * 4 days * older than ama . 
  this is weird . 
  several people in the ama call him out as having created his account the very same day - not 4 days before . 
  any idea how this happened ?

  nope . 
  these areas were n't affected .

  you 're sure this is n't just his fetish ? 
  getting kicked in the nuts ? 
  so , is this another way in which the communist manifesto is like the bible ? 
  book that had some good ideas * for its time * , but should n't be used as a moral compass today ? 
  they are certainly one of the better parts of that book . 
  still - ten rules , and they do n't include a word about slavery or rape . 
  we 've come up with better sets of rules since then . 
  do n't covet thy neighbour . 
  do n't fuck anyone who does n't consent . 
  there , we 've improved them . 
  as a german , i agree with his first point . 
  we just have a weird fetish . 
  you can simply say `` casus belli '' even as plural . 
  pronounce it with a long - u - if you want it to sound fancy . 
  applies even in your sentence , where it should be accussative , because * casus * uses the rare * u declination * . 
  `` belli '' could of course be replaced by `` bellorum '' if you want to say `` reasons for * wars * '' , not `` reasons for war '' ; but i 'd go with the latter . 
  the singular is [ * phenomenon * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phenomenon ) , btw . 
  the beer it good ? 
  ... that 's a good point , actually ... 
  i mean , it 's `` productive '' only in a purely destructive way , which is something cats are good at , but it was still useful to humans . 
   reddit offers a pillow friendly work environment . 
  sir , i need to know where i can get some business pillows . 
  is there a cocktail called dirty joe ? 
  because that sounds like a cocktail ... 
  what 's the `` double '' ? 
  i only see one `` what ?!, 
   `` for example , the baseline lifetime risk of thyroid cancer for females is just three-quarters of one percent and the additional lifetime risk estimated in this assessment for a female infant exposed in the most affected location is one-half of one percent . '', 
   so the total additional risk is almost negligible . 
  that 's not `` negligible '' , that 's an increase by 66 % , according to your numbers . 
  [ baseline 0.75 , increase 0.5 . ], 
   regardless of whether or not the cancer was due to his heroic actions he was a hero and should be recognized as such . 
  it was n't . 
  quoting / u/mantra :, 
   he died of esophageal cancer is absolutely not caused by radiation exposure . 
  it comes from smoking or in asia from various foods that also cause elevated stomach cancer rates . 
   radiation exposure will cause cancers in fast-growing/reproducing cells such as bone marrow primarily . 
  or organs that concentrate specific radionuclides like i-131 in the thyroid or sr-90 in the bones . 
  i agree that this has nothing to do with wether or not he was a hero . 
  in a way , that 's correct . 
  compared to the earthquake and the tsunami ( that killed some 15,000 people ) , nothing really relevant happened with that power plant . 
   but switching from [ ... ] seniority ought to be trickier . 
  have you ever * been * in seniority in the late game ? 
  it 's near impossible to get out of !, 
  with hundreds of living members in your dynasty , your heir will always just be another 80 year old who dies long before getting anywhere near ten years of ruling . 
  again , and again , and again . 
  just to be sure : you are playing on `` very hard '' , right ? 
  not sure how much of an effect that actually has , but it seems many people are n't even aware that there are different difficulty levels ... 
  if it reminded you of kraftklub , maybe it was kraftklub .

  saying you hate makeup is like saying you hate music . 
  you might not like modern pop music or you might not like dubstep or classical music , but there is * some form of music * that you like , and this is true for probably every human on the planet . 
  similarly , there is some sort of look or appearance that you like . 
  it may not be important to you that your so actually * has * this look , but it would still be nice if they did . 
  no matter what this look is - there is some kind of makeup that , if used correctly , can help them get it . 
  i 'm curious now , what makeup * is * she wearing ? 
   hell , even if he decided he has n't been screwed but simply wants the entire 400,000 , he can decide to go after her , with or with the down payment . 
  he can go after her , but that does n't get him any money . 
  unless she actually has 400k lying around in cash . 
  this is how you always get new missions in rpgs . 
  laddergoat , you seem trustworthy . 
  i have need of someone to help me with a delicate operation . 
  let 's not talk about it to loudly , lest the authorities hear us , but there is something you could do for me ... are you interested in making some money ? 
  i do n't know where you get the idea that i 'm `` up in arms '' . 
  i 'm just telling you : if there is a look that you like in women , there 's a type of makeup to give them that look . 
  even ( especially ! ), 
  if it 's a look of `` natural beauty '' . 
  not caring much about looks is a good think . 
  saying you do n't like makeup is just silly . 
  not even really for you , i just want to post this for myself , because i came up with a better comparison than music : spices .
