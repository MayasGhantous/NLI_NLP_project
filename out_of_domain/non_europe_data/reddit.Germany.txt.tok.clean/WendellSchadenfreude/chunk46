  [ and herbs and stuff . 
  maybe i should call it `` seasoning '' - i have only a very basic idea about cooking . 
  i 'll stick with `` spices '' . ], 
  many people like `` spicy food '' . 
  this does n't even mean the same thing to everybody , but let 's not get into this too deep . 
  other people * do n't * like spicy food . 
  that 's ok , there 's nothing to argue about . 
  but claiming you do n't like * spices * in general probably just means that you 've never tasted well-seasoned food . 
  there * is * some flavor that you like , and there * are * some spices ( herbs , ... ) that will give your food that flavor . 
  why `` fuck '' ? 
  just do it now or whenever is good for you - she 's gon na wait for you . 
  although finding some random guy 's daughter is likely just a sidequest that does n't give a big reward anyway . 
   which she will after he kills her husband . 
  ... why ? 
  maybe this is an american thing i 'm not getting . 
  if i was the recipient of someone 's life insurance , i 'm certain the company would wire the money to my bank account , not send someone with a suitcase full of bank notes to my house . 
  a hitman could kill me easily enough , but that would n't get him any of the money in my bank account . 
  i think this is the core of the missunderstanding :, 
   makeup is just one type of `` seasoning '' for looks . 
  it is n't . 
  any kind of `` seasoning for looks '' would be called makeup . 
  so what does makeup mean , specifically ? 
  ( my definition would be that it 's any kind of substance used to enhance the appearance or odor of the human body . 
  and yes , i took that from wikipedia . ), 
  i 'm not trying to be snappish or anything , by the way . 
  if you have a good definition of makeup , i 'd really like to hear it . 
  this is not a good example for `` taking it too far '' . 
  any `` smart scientist person '' should be able to give at least a rough answer to this `` skeptic '' . 
  duck vagina . 
  / r/fearme, 
  you have every reason to be confused . 
  it 's supposed to be `` she would read the books '' . 
  just always remember that `` read '' rhymes with `` lead '' , but `` read '' rhymes with `` lead '' . 
  i remember that the advice in case of a hijacking was for all the passengers to remain calm and simply do as they 're told . 
  i think that 's the biggest difference for hijackers today : no matter what you do and how you 're armed : the entire plane is gon na try and jump you . 
  all modern cockpits are fortified enough that passengers/hijackers ca n't simply waltz in anymore . 
  that alone is enough to make another 9/11 * using the same methods * impossible . 
  i do n't understand what exactly you mean to say . 
  in any case , i assure you : if i had only the choice of letting a hijacker fly my plane , or flying it myself , i 'd choose the latter . 
  and i know nothing about flying . 
  * somehow * landing a plane semi-safely ca n't be that difficult . 
  well , no untrained passenger ever had to land a larg airplane in reality ; so we 're ultimately just guessing . 
  it has happened with smaller planes , though . 
  [ story 1 ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2009/us/04/13/florida.plane.emergency/ ) [ story 2 ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/us/story?id=96248&amp;page=1#.ud7qe20wkbz ), 
  if it ever happened , the poor insta-pilot would at least get detailed instructions over the radio , and the longest available runway reserved exclusively for him . 
  there 's at least a decent chance of survival in this case . 
   all be in not with the tickler, 
  * albeit, 
  can you explain this to a non-american ? 
  the civil case is tm 's family vs zimmermann , and a possible outcome is that zimmermann has to pay them some money because he was at least partly to blame for tm 's death ? 
  i checked out his comments . 
  what you say is not true . 
  he posts about all kinds of stuff . 
  your cynicism is completely absurd . 
  i 'm not even gon na address the cheap geneticicism . 
  ( pretty sure that 's not a word , but it should be : obsessing about genetics when they really do n't matter in this context . ), 
  in our parents ' generation , many people were certain that the world would be a horrible place for their children - but in my opinion , life turned out quite wonderful for us . 
  there were big problems back then , there are big problems now , and there will be big problems in 30 , 50 , or 100 years . 
  none of the problems we have now and none of the ridiculous `` economic uncertainties '' you see in the future are worth mentioning if you compare them to the constant fear of a nuclear war that dominated the zeitgeist in the 50 's -80 's . 
  for our lives , the big problems rarely matter as much as the small ones anyway . 
  tl ; dr : cheer up , dammit . 
  and then have lots of kids !, 
  one obvious problem : small companies would be * very * hesitant when it comes to hiring people , because it means that all the employees/shareholders lose a relevant share of their money . 
  i think there are bigger problems than this one , but it 's a pretty obvious one and , i believe , one that you will care about . 
  most pyramids are actually in sudan . 
  taxes are certainly still collected in the coastal region , where the government has always held uncontested power . 
  support from iran and russia ( and lebanon ) is probably very important for the government , although you wo n't find actual numbers about this anywhere . 
  they are siding with the kurds and nobody else . 
  the kurds are mostly defending their own areas , in the north , along the turkish and iraqi border . 
  the kurdish militias have had minor clashes with both government and rebel forces . 
  their goal is , simply put , to get out of this conflict with as much autonomy as possible . 
  also `` good '' , `` highly '' , `` moderates '' , and especially `` secularists '' . 
  raze , not raise . 
  unless you 're talking about underground cities that need to be raised to the ground . 
  this is n't about being rich , it 's about having any kind of income . 
  it 's hard enough for many young people to find an entrance level job as is . 
  this would be a lot harder if hiring a person meant making them an equal owner of your company . 
  oh , not at all . 
  just compare it to lebanon . 
  during the lebanese civil war ( 1975-1990 ) , there were about 80 separate factions in a much smaller country . 
  ( wikipedia lists only 22 , but those are only the major ones . ), 
  compared to that , syria still looks clean and tidy . 
  of course , the war has been going on for `` only '' two years , the war in lebanon dragged on for 15 ( ! ), 
  years . 
  i have no doubt there are some individual kurds fighting on either side . 
  still , i think you 're mostly painting a wrong picture . 
  i do n't know that `` the kurds '' ( as in , the organized ypg/pyd groups ) ever fought alongside the fsa . 
  all they did was push the government forces out of some kurdish areas . 
  after that , they denied access to these areas to the fsa as well . 
  you ca n't simply end your comment in a comma . 
  the suspense is killing me ,, 
  ahm ... is that some inside joke i do n't get , or do you really have to id people for * pepperoni pizza * ? 
  * instructions unclear , got pizza stuck in elevator doors *, 
  restaurants , deliveries , and supermarkets ? 
  damn ... did n't even notice that . 
  do you think that was on purpose ? 
  ... you people are making me feel dumb . 
  i only noticed the other error because of your comment ... 
  you 're in a great position to change a person 's mind , at least about some little things . 
  most people do n't ever really listen to arguments that are coming `` from the other side '' , but since your boss believes that you 're on his side , you can chose at least one topic that you disagree with .
