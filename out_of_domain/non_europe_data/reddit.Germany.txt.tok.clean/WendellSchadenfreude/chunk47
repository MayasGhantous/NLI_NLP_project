  if , for instance , you mention that you think a person 's sexual orientation is n't the government 's business and gays should thus have the same rights , this might actually convince him - coming from a `` staunch republican '' such as you . 
  you 're not destined to fail , nobody is . 
  24 is still young , you have plenty of time to find your niche in life . 
  does n't have to be big , as long as it makes you happy . 
  ok , be honest now : did you already see / u/typicalredditretort 's answer , or did you just happen to write * exactly * the same thing ? 
  just to clarify one aspect of this a little :, 
  they are n't `` originally '' similar . 
  the languages are completely different ( the adopted words notwithstanding ) ; polish is a slavic language and lithuanian a baltic language . 
  the similarities evolved because they happened to share a country for some twohundred years , [ the commonwealth of both nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) . 
  is `` dayum '' a two-syllable `` damn '' ? 
  `` what is the raiding of a guild compared to the founding of a guild ? '', 
  to be fair - we had them all up in our shit pretty much * up to * the fall of the ottoman empire . 
  ( `` we '' and `` them '' and stuff ... well , you know ... ), 
  they do n't * physically * make you stumble . 
  they are n't only in berlin , but actually in hundreds of cities . 
  i think it 's really powerful , seeing these stones everywhere in the streets . 
  koblenz ( a town of 100k people ) has a hundred * stolpersteine * . 
  this shows how there must have been thousands of people with jewish neighbours and friends in koblenz alone . 
  i 'm really surprised that there are n't any ( ? ), 
  states where homosexuality simply never was illegal . 
  think about greece , for instance : during the golden era of ancient greece , it was normal to be bisexual . 
  when did they ever decide that it should suddenly become illegal ? 
  i felt like i should do more to support this idea , so i upvoted your comment as well . 
  you executed his 0 year old son ... ? 
  i hardly dare asking , but how did his other three children die ?

   beastealty, 
  just * be stealthy * about it , it 'll be ok . 
  i 'm really not sure if that 's good or bad . 
   then she iced the cake and balanced her account right there at the register . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  explain like i 'm 28 but have never seen a cheque in my life , please !, 
  i see it somewhat like that , i 'm just not sure about one thing :, 
  japan was lucky with the wind blowing almost everything that came out of the plant right into the ocean . 
  there 's lots of people who claim that if the weather had been different , tokyo might have become an evacuation zone . 
  i have no idea if that 's true , but if it is , then it certainly was n't a success , but just very lucky . 
  in my experience , the opposite is true : people like to talk endlessly about the natives who were killed directly by armed white men , without even realizing that the number of native americans who died from european diseases was * vastly * higher . 
  well , it kind of did , but mostly probably did n't . 
  there 's [ one occasion ] ( http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1088/did-whites-ever-give-native-americans-blankets-infected-with-smallpox ) when a british high-ranking officer had a plan including smallpox-infested blankets , although we do n't know if even he ever but that plan into action . 
  so this may have happened , but it was n't really a common thing . 
  diseases spread on their own , they do n't usually need much help from people . 
  really ? 
  when ? 
  ( serious questions . 
  i have no idea what you are talking about ; but i 'd like to know . 
  75 % sounds awful . ), 
  so he was showing around your new , * dead * kitten ? 
  the poor neighbours must have thought that you were trying to threaten them . 
  on purpose , or by accident ? 
  did she swallow ? 
  ... man , it feels weird to ask that about a six year-old . 
  [ yes , yes , / r/nocontext , i know ... ], 
  i think that 's the point . 
  it 's not gon na happen `` again '' , it 's just gon na happen . 
  sometime . 
  probably . 
  highest elevation of the maldives is 7 feet / 2 meters . 
  his name is hassan . 
  where are you from ? 
  i 'm from germany , i do n't think there are any shared bedroom dorms here , but i spent a semester in lithuania , and i did share my room with another student there . 
  i do n't believe you . 
  earthporn is such a bad choice for default . 
  i love the sfw-network ( although it really needs renaming to be safe for the frontpage ) , but earthporn is * nothing but desktop images * . 
  there 's no discusion ; there 's usually not even any * comments * . 
  [ earthporn is basically nothing but the results of a google search for landscape themed desktop backgrounds ... ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=desktop+backgrounds&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.49478099,d.yms,pv.xjs.s.en_us.c75bky5eq0a.o&amp;biw=1760&amp;bih=873&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=ja7nuepygitxswaq_idyda#um=1&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=desktop+backgrounds+landscape&amp;oq=desktop+backgrounds+landscape&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i19j0i5i19l3.9564.10873.2.11034.9.9.0.0.0.0.99.638.9.9.0....0...1c.1.21.img.twadefl52nq&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.49478099,d.yms&amp;fp=445f4cffa48762b3&amp;biw=1760&amp;bih=873 ), 
  [ it 's not a map , but here 's an overview . 
  ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_livqq7q0d11qitcsyo1_500.png ), 
  this is absolutely true . 
  the big change for / r/earthporn is that there might * be * comments from now on . 
  very good suggestion . 
  sorry it 'll likely get burried . 
  sorry , i meant to reply to a different post . 
  ^ na , ^ just ^ kidding ... 
  i * hate * that bastard .

  what language have you been learning ? 
  if it was spanish - [ haha !, 
  ] ( http://www.allmystery.de/dateien/uh59514,1282427519,simpsons-haha.jpg ) they mostly speak catalan in barcelona . 
  this is , btw , not a good question for askreddit . 
  do n't know which sub would be better . 
  maybe / spain , maybe / travel , ... 
  according to your own definition - have you ever been one ? 
  ask again in / r/eli5 . 
  five year olds ask weird questions . 
  eli5 is confusingly named , the questions are * not * answered as if talking to a five year old . 
  it 's actually `` explain to a layman '' . 
  guess this came across meaner than was intended . 
  the part about spanish * not * being `` the '' language of barcelona is still true , though . 
  anyhow - enjoy europe !, 
  does your son also do this ? 
  it sounds like the least thing a muscleman could do . 
  your face being upside down makes it even harder than usual to interpret your emotions . 
  are you sad ? 
  ... why ? 
  ( eli5 * is * the goto subreddit if you want questions like this one answered . ), 
  i have * no idea * what you 're talking about . 
  explain like i 'm five , literally !, 
  did you hear about the dyslexic , agnostic insomniac ?
