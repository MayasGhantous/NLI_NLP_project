  i think the laws are actually like that in * most * places , although it 's hard to tell on a global scale . 
  the relevant [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue ) explains the laws in germany , france , brazil , and serbia , all of which have `` duty to rescue '' laws - not helping a person in danger even though you could is a criminal offense in these countries . 
  they also mention that somewhat similar laws are in place in countries including albania , andorra , argentina , austria , belgium , brazil , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , israel , italy , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , russia , serbia , spain , and switzerland . 
  but these laws generally are n't called `` good samaritian laws '' - that 's something related , but different . 
  yeah , but it 's also not nearly as bad as you may have thought . 
  [ volks * marsch * . 
  kingdom republics are * sooo * annoying . 
  takes forever to take them apart . 
  what might be annoying is that many people will assume you understand neither german not english , so they 'll basically ignore you because they think they ca n't talk to you anyway . 
  that also answers the question wether people can tell the difference between asian americans and asians - no , of course not . 
  ( how would they ? ), 
  as one of the most beautiful french regions . 
  stra\u00dfburg is a relatively common destination for small trips , especially the cathedral is quite famous . 
  we somehow love the idea that there are still native speakers of german in `` elsass '' , although i think that 's barely true anymore . 
  this is actually problematic for germans , because we say `` fuck '' much more casually than most americans . 
  it 's only sometimes used as a category in a few shops . 
  they have `` classic '' , `` charts '' , `` pop/rock '' , `` electronic '' ... and in a few instances , they also used the category `` black music '' for soul and rnb and such . 
  so , short version : it 's not true . 
  but in a year or so , do you think it will not have been passed or will it not have not been passed ? 
  thanks . 
  i needed an expert opinion on that . 
  this is such a cute description - `` the blades make the noise go away '' . 
  i 'm sure it 's also a good metaphore for something , i have to remember this . 
  ( i 'm still waiting for a chance a using the somewhat similar `` headaches are n't caused by a lack of aspirin '' . ), 
  when you 're a king already , simply searching your realm for characters of the same culture and religion ( who are not rulers ) also gives you an endless supply , you do n't have to invite anyone . 
  the problem in mickos example , if i understand correctly , was that he was a catholic but wanted to hand out titles to orthodox characters only . 
  that 's much more tedious ... 
  it 's annoying that this ca n't be controlled , but i do n't think it 's much of a problem . 
  when you grant someone from your own religion group a landed title , they will usually be willing to convert . 
  ( if necessary , also send them a gift - only costs 20 gold . ), 
  and when they are of your religion , having a different culture * from the same culture group * is n't that bad .

  thanks . 
  for now , i 'm content to know that there * is * an answer - i thought this might have just been a hole in the story . 
  totally different . 
  that spyware would be used against individual suspects . 
  when you are suspected of a crime , your phone calls can be tapped and your apartment can be bugged , so it should also be possible for the police to scan your computer . 
  this is not comparable to spying on * everybody 's * entire internet communication . 
  they did n't plan to install that software on * every * computer .

  installing hidden cameras in every living room in the country : not ok . not even if you only watch the footage of a few of these cameras that you find interesting . 
  installing a hidden camera in the living room of a specific suspect , with a warrant and reasonable suspicion - not a problem at all . 
  that does n't sound healthy . 
   broke my humorous, 
  is that the proverbial `` funny bone '' ? 
  so glad i 'm not the only one . 
  i first thought this was a brilliant replay , then suddenly i was n't sure if it was actually just * whoosh * ... 
  i 'm a little embarrased to admit it , but this title confused me badly ... 
  a clock has three hands : hour , minute , and second . 
  so the second hand is actually not the second , but the minute hand . 
  the second is the third , of course . 
  and the second hand does n't just freeze for moments , it freezes for a minute every time ... 
   it was a trade treaty , and it was great for both sides , and they were rather friendly , even allies at one point , because of it . 
  whom were they fighting when they were allies ? 
  thanks . 
  ( cool , i was sure the answer would be some guy i 'd never heard of .

  am i the only one who thinks that this is increadibly sad ? 
  i love bakery smell . 
  but if * walking by a bakery * is the best part of your day , you need to change something in your life . 
  having a romantic candlelight dinner , 5 courses , at a table that you booked months in advance at an expensive restaurant for an anniversary - * all by yourself * - that would be so much sadder than anything you can do with your microwave . 
  ah , that does n't sound to bad anymore .
