  you came so close to making sense at this point : `` the cells that will one day become a human '' - that 's the question !, 
  * when * do these cells start being human ? 
  as always , there 's an xkcd for this . 
   my question to anybody that claims to be `` pro-life '' is if they are in fact pro life , or just pro-birth . 
  i think there 's a relatively easy answer to this . 
  pro-lifers in general claim that an unborn child is already a person . 
  thus , it should have basically the same personal rights as a young child . 
  we ca n't really force you to treat your children well , but we will punish you if you kill them ( or massively neglect them ) . 
  but society * does * already punish you if you massively neglect your children . 
  and you certainly * are * punished if you kill your children . 
  wich from a pro-life point of view seems to be quite comparable to killing our children * before they are born * , i.e. 
  having abortions . 
  i do n't want to get into the broader social lament , because i think it has no business in this discussion . 
   the simple reality is that it is far more cruel to bring a life into the world that is destined for misery , crime , and abject poverty than it is to stop it before it starts . 
  `` stop before it starts '' is ( from a pro-life pov ) not abortion , but contraception . 
  all laws you talk about would be in no way comparable to anti-abortion laws , but to laws punishing pregnant women for smoking , drinking or eating unhealthy . 
  `` putting down '' poor children out of mercy ... na , i really do n't even want to talk about this . 
  ( i feel i could n't without insulting you . ), 
  you seem to be digressing again . 
  the faucet in my kitchen just started dripping . 
  brb , just got to fix that . 
  `` a graveyard shift is a shift of work running through the early hours of the morning , especially one from midnight until 8 am . '',

  in defense of slavery supporters , they 'd rather it be federally legal . 
  now what ? 
   there are a number of reasons for this , but probably one of the most obvious is that it creates confusion among citizens . 
  if laws are different for different states , how is one person who moves from one state to another supposed to know them all . 
  people already do n't know `` all the laws '' of their country/state without moving . 
  the simple reason is that people in texas are n't the same as people in new york . 
  texans ( on average ) would be less happy having to live like new yorkers and vice versa - why should they share more laws than necessary ? 
  they need to do something about the sound - i hate having those wind-noises in my ears .

  not the point at all . 
  everyone has some rules they 'd like to see put into force , if possible for the whole world . 
  the fact that mj supporters would rather see it legalized federally than on state level is in no way specific to them ; that is true for almost every supporter of almost every law .

  i guess it 's because people tend to think of themselves first , but have memorized that saying `` i and peter '' is impolite and will often be answered by somebody pointing out that it should be `` peter and i '' . 
  since `` peter and me '' would still be wrong , you can usually get away with `` me and peter '' , because there is no super-obvious correction . 
  what about the plural ? 
  would people ever say `` us and the millers went to the store '' ? 
  or would it always be `` we and the millers ... '' / `` the millers and we ... '' ? 
  [ or , of course , stuff like : `` the millers and us , we went ... '' ], 
  is that even the same difference ? 
  is your teacher from austria ? 
  aaaber :, 
   she [ margaret mead ] observed in the flirtations between the american soldiers and british women a pattern of misunderstandings regarding who is supposed to take which initiative . 
  she wrote of the americans , `` the boy learns to make advances and rely upon the girl to repulse them whenever they are inappropriate to the state of feeling between the pair '' , as contrasted to the british , where `` the girl is reared to depend upon a slight barrier of chilliness ... which the boys learn to respect , and for the rest to rely upon the men to approach or advance , as warranted by the situation . '', 
  this resulted , for example , in british women interpreting an american soldier 's gregariousness as something more intimate or serious than he had intended . 
   communications theorist paul watzlawick used this situation , where `` both american soldiers and british girls accused one another of being sexually brash '' , as an example of differences in `` punctuation '' in interpersonal communications . 
  he wrote that courtship in both cultures used approximately 30 steps from `` first eye contact to the ultimate consummation '' , but that the sequence of the steps was different . 
  for example , kissing might be an early step in the american pattern but a relatively intimate act in the english pattern . 
  ( ok , you already had a few similar responses ... sorry , this took me a while to write ... ), 
  oh , i believe in the first one ; and i think there 's lots of atheists who also agree with the second one . 
  but believing that these are two valuable lessons or believing that the man who said them was a very wise and praiseworthy teacher does n't make you a christian . 
  ( it might still make you a good person . ), 
  believing that this man was the son of god , born of a virgin , resurrected from the dead , ascended to the heavens , there waiting to come back and judge all mankind - that 's what makes a christian . 
  sorry if i sound like i 'm trying to lecture you on christianity , that 's not what i 'm trying . 
  my point simply is : if these are the only two parts of the bible that you believe in , you are not a christian , you might be an atheist . 
  but if you truly love `` your neighbour '' and act like it , you still are a good person , and if there happens to be a just god , i think he 'd let you in to heaven - even if you did n't believe in him .

  it 's important to note that evolution wo n't necessarily turn us into something that we today would consider to be `` more advanced '' . 
  i do n't want to go into which traits today actually grant a reproductive advantage ( because this usually gets ugly rather quickly ) , but even assuming only random mutations ( without any real `` selection '' ) from now on : the eye is pretty good as it is . 
  random ( significant ) mutations to a modern human 's eye would likely make it worse in one way or another - they might also make it better , but that just seems very unlikely . 
  since we could in many cases fix the damage to the eye ( with glasses , lenses , surgeries ) * without `` fixing '' the genetic mutation that caused it * , these disadvantageous mutations might accumulate over time - causing future humans to be half-blind by default . 
  and the eye is , of course , just one example , the same thing could at the same time happen to all or other organs as well . 
  but do n't worry , `` future '' here means ~ 1000 generations . 
  technology is much faster than that .

   i 'm just saying that i 'm not going to arrogantly tell someone what they should be allowed to call themselves based on a definition that i , an outsider , made up for them . 
  i do n't think you can generally say that this is arrogant . 
  there 's lots of people who call themselves vegetarians and continue eating eggs , honey , fish , and whatnot . 
  now , i do n't want to go into the details here : this might all still be called vegetarianism . 
  but if you call yourself a `` vegetarian who eats steak three times a week '' , you 're simply wrong about the meaning of the word `` vegetarian '' . 
   you 're an agnostic atheist . 
  you see , * that 's * a fancy way of saying it . 
  fun fact indeed . 
  in arabic , westerners can be called `` ferengi '' , derived from the franks that gave their name to france . 
  this is , of course , also where startrek 's ferengi got their name . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferengi#etymology ) says the arabs adopted the persian word * farangi * . 
  i 'm not sure why they think it went this way ; it seems more likely that the arabs would have subsumized all europeans as `` franks '' first . 
  but anyway : yes , a closely related word is also used in persian , and in e.g. 
  thai . 
  my first thought exactly when looking at this map . 
  well , yeah , not `` for littlefinger '' .
