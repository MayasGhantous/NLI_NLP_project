  they had shared a border since 1793 , since the second partition of poland . 
  wendell is just wendell , the first name . 
  ( not german . ), 
  schadenfreude is joy in the misfortune of others . 
  wendell schadenfreude was my name when i was a german for halloween last year . 
  ( everybody in harlem loved the white guys in lederhosen . ), 
  dude ... if she left you , she was * not * the best thing to ever happen to you . 
  that thing is still to come . 
   i 'm confused, 
  that was the plan with that costume . 
  i actually * am * german . 
  ( or am i ? ), 
  i was in the us with two friends at the time . 
  we all bought cheap lederhosen and a completely overboard `` traditional german/bavarian costume '' , spoke english with our worst possible german accent and claimed that our last names were `` schadenfreude '' , `` wanderlust '' , and such . 
  plan was to make people believe we were americans ( badly ) dressed as germans . 
  i think it worked most of the time . 
  any source on that ? 
  ( i actually believe you , but still . ), 
  so it 's basically the chinese calling chinese food just `` food '' . 
  scotch is scottish whisky , but it 's called `` whisky '' in scotland . 
  short answer : none . 
  of course , disinfectants ( usually chlorine dioxide ) are added to make sure the water is free of microorganisms . 
  rarely some other chemicals ( mostly to adjust the ph ) . 
  but we do n't have anything like the fluoride that is commonly added to drinking water in america . 
  as an example : the drinking water provider of the city of erfurt ( in german ) . 
  edit : drinking water was fluoridated in the gdr , incidentally . 
  i think this is only partly the right law for this question . 
  it applies to bottled water , but not to tap water . 
  for tap water , the additives would be the ones listed by the umweltbundesamt . 
  [ [ pdf here . 
  no chance of understanding anything unless your german is really good . 
  edit : btw , chlorine ( or related compounds ) are used in germany , too . 
  i do n't think it should be regarded as an additive , because it 's supposed to be mostly gone when the water reaches the consumer . 
  wastewater treatment plant . 
  it 's used there , too , and does n't need to be `` removed '' , because it is consumed by the reactions with all the other stuff in the water . 
  but it 's also used for drinking water disinfection . 
  other countries use a lot more , but it 's also commonly used in germany . 
  you ca n't taste or smell it at < ~ 1 mg/l ( or you just get used to it ) . 
  ( source : i do research on drinking water . ), 
  edit : just to be clear : chlorine directly is not used in germany , but stuff like sodium hypochlorite or chlorine dioxide . 
  in the media , these would all be called `` chlorine '' . 
  yes , i think i made it sound like chlorine ( etc. ), 
  is used more often than it actually is . 
  * most * german drinking water is ground water which is already germfree , so it is not usually treated with any chemicals . 
  every treatment plant * can * add `` chlorine '' , though , and they do whenever the safety of the water is threatened . 
  * `` mr big shot '', 
  i love how this is obviously still the first thing many people think about . 
   cars drive slow on the left lane on the autobahn . 
  this always makes me so angry , i feel like i could invade poland or something . 
  close the window !, 
  you want to kill us all ? 
  i do n't think so , but i do n't think i 've ever seen any data on this . 
  in germany , tooth paste usually contains fluoride , and so does most of the table salt . 
  that 's enough , it does n't have to be in the drinking water . 
  ( germans do n't have crazy white teeth like many americans , but that 's a different story . ), 
  ah , interesting . 
  i never knew they asked for the fluoride as well . 
  i had heard before that american soldiers in germany asked for ( totally unnecessary ) additional chlorine in their tap water , just so that it tastes `` cleaner '' . 
  i love the map wikipedia uses for liechtenstein . 
  [ it actually shows you where the country is , even if you had no clue before .

   i once got interrogated while walking home from the grocery store because a half gallon of milk went missing . 
  did they ever find the rascal responsible for this horrible dead , or does the town still cower in fear of the return of the milk monster ? 
  my key looks like that . 
  ( germany ), 
  not sure if this is normal : i live in a house with ~ 10 other apartments , and everyone has a key that opens both the front door and the door to their own apartment , but not to anybody else 's apartment . 
  and how many murders have there been in the yankee stadium in the past ten years ?

  china . 
  the country . 
  ok , not sure if it would be the most beneficial , but the most interesting : would there be anything left to buy if you had to avoid everything that was * made in china * ? 
  what makes you think that ? 
  there 's more than one racist in the world , i 'm sorry to break this to you . 
  in any case : i gave all of them basically the same answer .

  has anyone told you the joke about the turtle in the desert that keeps saying `` neeeneeeneee '' ?

  so your great uncle was 13 when hitler rose to power , your aunt was 15 . 
  in the next 6 years , they heard nothing but propaganda ; and then the war started and it got even worse . 
  do n't be too hard on them .
