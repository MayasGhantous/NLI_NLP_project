  if you are 90 years old and think that the nazi era was the best time of your life , it does n't mean you 're a nazi . 
  it probably means that you * were * one , but most importantly it means that you were * young * and it was a great time for you . 
  ok , but * what * is it ? 
  [ i stole your comment , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1jnrq6/after_overhearing_a_conversation_at_a_bar/cbgnjsc ) i hope that 's ok . 
  marrying your niece is probably even more legal than marrying your first cousin , and also more frowned upon . 
  so yours should actually be the top comment in this thread . 
  not so sure about that . 
  if i had to tell my friends either that i shoplifted my new flatscreen or that i frequented prostitutes once a week , i think i 'd go with the shoplifiting . 
  ( i do n't shoplift , and i do n't frequent prostitutes . 
  - you wo n't believe me . 
  ah , nevermind ... ), 
  yeah , i somehow blacked out and thought that `` niece '' ment your cousin 's daughter , not your brother 's or sister 's . 
  anyway , how about marrying your grandniece ? 
  btw , i think your explanation is a bit off . 
  the link is for cousins is : you - ( up ) -  your parent - ( up ) -  your grandparent - ( down ) -  your aunt/uncle - ( down ) -  your cousin . 
  you get a `` relation factor '' of 0.5 ^ 4 = 0.0625 , but you have to take this route twice , because you share * two * of your grandparents with your cousin . 
  so rf = 0.125 for cousins . 
  for your niece , it goes : you - ( up ) -  your parent - ( down ) -  your sibling - ( down ) -  your niece, 
  this gives you a `` relation factor '' of 0.5 ^ 3 = 0.125 , which you have to double again because you share both parents with your ( full ) siblings . 
  so rf for your nieces and nephews : 0.25 . 
  [ this `` relation factor '' , if i 'm not mistaken , is also the ( average ) percentage of dna that you have in common with your relative ( in addition to the huge part of dna that is the same for any human ) . ], 
  maybe a helpful way of thinking about this is that your siblings are your `` zeroth '' cousins . 
  your ( full ) siblings share two parents with you . 
  your first cousins share two grandparents with you . 
  your second cousins share two great-grandparents with you . 
  your third cousins share two great-great-grandparents with you , and so on ... 
  edit : no , wait - this is different from what you were saying . 
  damn ... 
  edit2 : i think what i said was correct . 
  have a look at wikipedia , [ this looks quite tidy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin ) . 
  your second cousin is not your cousin 's cousin . 
  actually , your second cousin is also your cousin 's second cousin . 
  first cousin 's child is your * child 's * second cousin , not your 's . 
  islam does n't have much intermarriage either . 
  jews also were n't ever big on proselytizing , which is different in islam and christianity . 
   never underestimate internet hate . 
  when your post is this rude , you do n't really have to say that you 're german , everyone already knows . 
  the german equivalent to starting your post with `` completely wrong '' is not `` total falsch '' , it is `` total falsch , * arschloch * '' . 
  unless this was your intention , you should always be less direct when talking to non-germans . 
  nothing much , thank you for asking . 
  anything wrong with you ? 
  i was n't `` having a go at him '' , i told him that his post was probably much more rude than he intended . 
  since he replied that he actually * did intend to be rude * , i do n't even see what you 're accusing me of . 
  i was n't wrong in perceiving his comment as rude , i was only wrong in believing that he would n't be rude intentionally . 
  yes , but it does n't show what the other vasalls are - they ( at least some of them ) might be waldensians , too . 
  would you consider doing an ama about this experience ? 
  is it just me , or are her questions inaudible ? 
  edit : i 'm on a different computer and can hear the questions now . 
  they cancel out , except that inbred also gives you -30.0 % on fertility and -1.50 on health . 
  paradox games are all terrible . 
  completely unplayable , no fun at all , ever . 
  they 're all graphics and no strategy at all . 
  civilization also sucks when you think about it , does n't it ? 
  basically just a boring point-and-click thing . 
  ( you come back here when you 've reached the career level you want to reach and finished your degree . 
  then we 'll talk some more . ), 
  can you name one ? 
  just so that we know what you 're thinking of . 
   germany spies on their own citizens, 
  on a few individually selected citiziens who are suspects in a criminal investigation . 
  not on all citizens , just for the heck of it . 
  edit : do n't believe me , simply click the link that hivemind6 provided and read at least the headline !, 
  not even the article , the header already tells you that this was about trojan software . 
  this has to be installed on every computer individually , which is done only in cases of an ongoing criminal investigation . 
  comparing this to the program that the americans are `` getting flak '' for at the moment is beyond absurd . 
  what language is that ? 
  ( `` fick ja '' would kinda be german , although we do n't use it . ), 
  some background :, 
  that minister ( with the impossible name sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger - do n't even try to pronounce that ) is a member of the smaller party in the german government coalition , the `` free democrats '' or fdp . 
  she has a long record of standing up for privacy rights . 
  for instance , she resigned as a minister in 1995 in protest because her own party supported legislation that allowed acustical surveillance of private residences . 
  in this case ( as in many others ) i 'm afraid her ideas wo n't have any real impact . 
  her party is incidentally the only reason the german elections in september ) will be somewhat suspenseful . 
  angela merkel is going to `` win '' the elections , there 's hardly any doubt about that . 
  but the free democrats might fall below 5 % of the vote , which would mean they do n't get any seats in the bundestag . 
  in this case , angela merkel would have to find a new partner to form a coalition . 
   this will only cause a greater socio-economic divide, 
  i do n't think anything can cause a greater divide than a burka . 
  nobody will ever even talk to you while you 're wearing one ( and that 's basically the point ) . 
  oh , my bad . 
  when you said, 
   and banning burka 's will help this ? 
  i thought you were talking about burkas , not headscarves . 
  not really an answer to the question - there is not a single german company mentioned in that article . 
  oh great , thanks . 
  you just linked to a comment that i had already answered to and that totally does n't have anything to do with my question . 
  yes , and no , do n't do that . 
   ( approximately 200 000 kurds live in syria ), 
  you 're lacking a zero there , it 's around two million kurds in syria . 
  *** bogan ***, 
  australian term used to describe members of society that are a combination of what the yanks call rednecks , jocks and trailer park trash . 
  most likely found wearing mockies , flanalette shirts and consuming vb ( bad aussie beer ) . 
  large amount of bogans can be found living in the borough , bendigo , aust . 
  my , some of the other [ urban dictionary explanations ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bogan ) are even better ... 
  for the next 100 years , the ipcc projects a sea level rise of up to 60cm . 
  that would n't cause much trouble for the dutch . 
  over the course of centuries ( or millenia ) , the sea level might rise much more than that . 
  unless somebody bombs the dikes : no . 
   it 's possible to capitalize du but only when your addressing someone directly, 
  forgive my silly question , but is n't that the only time when `` du '' would ever be used ?
