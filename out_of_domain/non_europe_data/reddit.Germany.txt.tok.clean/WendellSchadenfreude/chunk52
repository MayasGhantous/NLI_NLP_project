  disclaimer : i 'm a bit oldfashioned . 
  i 'd always capitalize `` du '' . 
  i learned that this should be done in letters as a silly little sign of respect for the other person , but i do n't even think that 's really the reason . 
  ( i 'd still capitalize it in sentences such as `` hau ab , du arschloch ! '' ... ), 
  my reason is mostly consistency : when adressing someone as `` sie '' instead of `` du '' , you have to capitalize it , simply to avoid confusion with `` sie '' ( = she/her ) . 
  ( i know this does n't sound like a terribly professional reason . 
  but it 's a simple enough rule : all second person pronouns are capitalized . ), 
  the sea levels are n't going to rise by 2 metres in our lifetimes . 
  the highest ipcc projection is 60 cm until 2100 ( compared to 1990 ) . 
  the lowest is 18cm . 
  do n't sell your goddamned add medication . 
  first , dangerous physicians . 
  second , purchasers cheaper . 
  add . 
  add . 
  know add x that way . 
  what does it * mean * ... ? 
  this might be true , but it sounds like you 're high . 
  this does n't feel like much of a cmv answer , but i think it is the most important point . 
  i remember i once heard ann coulter arguing that she would n't challenge exceptions for rape and incest because that would harm the chances of putting any pro-life legislation in place . 
  it 's much better from a pro-life point of view to ban almost all abortions than to have a logically consistent position without a majority . 
  it 's important to note that rape is in fact rarely the reason for abortions . 
  found via wiki answers :, 
   according to the centers for disease control ( cdc ) , there were 820,151 legal induced abortions in the us in 2005 . 
  *** about 1 % is due to incest or rape *** and about 3 % due to mothers health . 
  whom are you quoting , and why ? 
  [ quick and dirty tip  ( http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/who-versus-whom?page=all ) when you 're trying to decide whether to use `` who '' or `` whom , '' ask yourself if the answer to the question would be `` he '' or `` him . '', 
  the answer in this case could be `` him '' , but not `` he '' . 
  thus it 's `` whom '' , not `` who '' . 
  i think us germans are the only ones who often call it `` kinder garden '' instead . 
  btw , they also use `` schadenfreude '' . 
  ( albeit rarely . ), 
  haha , your line got stolen !, 
  thanks for giving me a chance at using mine . 
  that 's easy , actually :, 
  your ( first ) cousin 's child is your '' ( first ) cousin once removed '' . 
  your cousin 's grandchild is your `` cousin twice removed '' . 
  your cousin 's parent ( the one who is your bloodrelative at least ) is in principle also your `` cousin once removed '' , although we 'd always call them `` uncle '' or `` aunt '' instead . 
  in other words : your parent 's cousin is also your cousin once removed , your grandparent 's cousin is your cousin twice removed . 
  bit more complicated ( but not much ) is the thing with `` first cousins '' , `` second cousins '' , ... 
  [ wikipedia explain all of this quite simple . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin ), 
  the internet is a great medium for watching chess matches . 
  you can watch the position and get live comments by grandmasters observing the match . 
  in 1996 , i witnessed online what i still think was the last really glorious victory of a world chess champion against a chess computer . 
  garry kasparov beat ibm 's deep blue , and i can still remember their sixth match . 
  [ [ link to a video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp8ae1hwnxa ) and [ to the wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_blue_versus_garry_kasparov#1996_game_6 ) . ], 
  i was only twelve years old , and somehow this match gave me the feeling that * i * could understand what kasparov was doing , while the computer could n't . 
  nothing big . 
  at a time when i had just finished my master thesis and thus had no obligations in the world , at the end of a day of sports with friends , i was riding my bike back home along the shore of a small river on this very mild summer evening , and i knew the next few weeks would be full of days like that one - i just felt happy with the world . 
  the end of that tilde is the depressing heat death , an endless universe filled with nothing but very faint and uniform radiation . 
  we 're somewhere on the third z , i believe . 
  would you prefer your clone to be articically aged so that he is as old as you are , or would you want him to raise him the classic way ? 
  your identical twin also has the same dna but is a different person . 
  there are also ways for others to tell you apart . 
  ( well know example : fingerprints . ), 
  it would be murder , without any doubt . 
  it would n't be an act of war then . 
  just a grave diplomatic incident . 
   pakistan also called that an act of war . 
  [ they did not . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactions_to_the_death_of_osama_bin_laden#.c2.a0pakistan ), 
   following the death of bin laden , president asif ali zardari convened emergency talks with prime minister yousuf raza gilani and security chiefs in islamabad . 
  gilani said : `` we will not allow our soil to be used against any other country for terrorism and therefore i think it 's a great victory , it 's a success and i congratulate the success of this operation . '', 
  later gilani blamed the world for their failure to capture bin laden . 
   the day after the raid , the pakistani government lashed out at the u.s. , saying that the united states had taken `` an unauthorized unilateral action '' that would not be tolerated in the future . 
  the foreign ministry further said , `` such an event shall not serve as a future precedent for any state , including the united states . '', 
  nonsense . 
  did you actually type 100 zeros ? 
  this typo in the middle of it makes me believe you did ... 
  well - thanks for the explanation . 
   it would still be an act of war . 
  acts of war are n't requirements for anyone to go to war . 
  they are acts that are universally recognized as aggressive justifications for war , and on the stage of global politics , no one likes an aggressor . 
  you 're making it sound like `` act of war '' is the exact same thing as `` casus belli '' . 
  i disagree . 
  murdering snowden could be a casus belli , that is : russia would be quite justified in declaring war because of it . 
  it would not in itself be an act of war , it would only justify later acts of war . 
  [ to be clear , i think this is a minor and rather boring difference . 
  but saying that assassinationg snowden would be `` an act of war '' is a poor eli5 answer , because it explains in no way what would actually happen . ], 
  in its * internal , secret * report . 
  is your answer to the question of this thread that russia would do * nothing * , but write disgruntled reports ? 
  because that is certainly possible , but if that 's what you want to say , say it . 
  saying that it would be `` an act of war '' just does n't answer the question . 
  that 's exactly what i thought about this answer ; and i mean it . 
  darth , if we should ever happen to attend the same party , i 'd love to talk with you for a while . 
  i think that is an actually more interesting question , because the us could afford a war against russia much better than vice versa . 
  ( still very badly , of course ... ), 
  but in the end , i guess in most cases this would work out similarly to the [ litvinenko case ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko ) that others already mentioned in this thread . 
  russian defected spy is poisoned in england , everybody knows it was the russians , they deny it , england is pissed for a while and then everything slowly settles down again . 
  i did . 
  i thought that 's what everyone is talking about in here . 
  `` to go after someone '' , defined by the free dictionary :, 
  to pursue someone , something , or an animal . 
  fig . 
  to charge or attack someone or an animal . 
  i mean , the us already * are * `` going after '' snowden in the meaning given under # 1 , they are pursuing him and trying to get him extradited . 
  so i figured the only thing op could mean by `` go after '' would be to physically attack him , most likely killing him . 
  ( or `` making him disappear '' , which does n't change much . ), 
  but you could have copypasted `` 000 , '' a few times .
