  like this . 
  i honestly wonder if you just posted without really thinking , if you 're trolling or if you possibly * do * think `` in images '' . 
  i can tell you that i do n't , and as far as i can possibly know that , most other people also think in language , not in images . 
  `` we '' even believe that thinking without language is basically impossible . 
  i even said every zero out loud . 
  my colleagues think i 'm a colourful snowflake . 
  `` 1 zero comma zero zero zero comma zero zero zero ... '', 
  remember - the enemy 's gate is * down * !, 
  yes . 
  at some point within the next fifty years , the us is just going to lose interest , and thus the `` war '' will basically be over . 
  worst case scenario : the us becomes part of an actual war somewhere in east asia or south america . 
  this war goes on for a few years , and while it does , everybody forgets that the middle east even exists . 
  knock knock . 
  damn , i should 've seen that coming . 
  unless the russians believe some cover up story about how the kremlin was * accidentally * vaporized , i guess so . 
  i think wwi is a good example for all this . 
  archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated , this was what triggered the war . 
  killing him was not an act of war itself . 
  even if we imagine some background story were the serbian ( or russian ) government was responsible for the assassination , it still was n't an act of war ; but it was ( in a way ) the casus belli . 
  [ this also highlights the difference between the casus belli and the actual reasons for a war . 
  the assassination of franz ferdinand caused the war only because there reasons that made both sides * want * to go to war . ], 
   why dont you assholes look up, 
  because you use capslock . 
  fuck off yourself . 
  ... sometimes i wonder what my brain is doing . 
  you know what , i 'll just delete everything i posted . 
  much better . 
  i even forced myself to read most of the article you posted . 
  i still think its slanderous nonsense . 
  and about the video ... did you even watch it yourself ? 
  he 's talking about reducing co2 output to zero , not population . 
  i reccomend you watch [ his entire ted talk . 
  ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates.html ) he actually expects an population * increase * by a factor of about 1.3 . 
  again ? 
  ... well , why not ... 
  reading your describtion , i wanted to strongly advice you to not use the `` ish '' pronounciation . 
  it 's partly a regional thing ( i guess it 's quite common in the southwest ) . 
  but unless you also use that regional dialect for everything else , it mostly makes you sound like you 're some gutter rat . 
  here 's an example of how * not * to pronounce it . 
  that 's what i immediately think of when i hear someone pronouncing `` ich '' as `` isch '' ... ( all the german they use is of course quite wrong . 
  do n't worry if you do n't understand all of it . ), 
  my only problem now is that the pronounciation in that mlp song sounds totally fine to me . 
  it 's possible that duolingo just emphasizes the throatyness of the ch-sound because that 's something that many foreigners have problems with . 
  use your throat , but do n't overdo it - making that sound should n't hurt , the air still flows out of your mouth , no somehow into your throat . 
  actually , i think quite the same about this . 
  making predictions about our technological abilities in even a hundred years is almost silly , talking about billions and billions of years is quite absurd . 
  you might take this to be the prediction of what the future would play out like if we humans decided not to intervene . 
  also , read asimov 's * last question * . 
  this reccomendation ca n't be given often enough . 
  one of them 's a comma , the other three are zeros . 
  [ damn , somebody caught me ...  ], 
  `` kiezdeutsch '' is mostly a lower class sociolect , and teaching such a variety to someone who wants to learn the language is simply bad teaching . 
  `` throaty '' was rilig 's description . 
  i guess non-linguists sometimes think of their palate as being the uppermost part of their throat . 
  ( i was not thinking of the * ach * - ch . ), 
  i 'm quite certain you are sincere , but this is n't correct . 
  ~ ~ `` human '' and `` huge '' start with a j-sound , like `` yes '' or `` you '' . ~ ~, 
  i just recorded myself saying [ `` yes , hugo - you are a huge human '' ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ou5qqjwyh7 ) to vocaroo . 
  would you [ mind doing the same ] ( http://vocaroo.com/ ) ? 
  i would love to hear your version . 
  ( it 's free and easy and only takes a few seconds , all you need is a microphone . ), 
  rule of thumb : if you 've ever heard the name of the place before , it 's too big . 
   i base this hate on several years of german in school with several horrible teachers and one actually from germany that was the worst . 
  i say `` i will forgive germany when they apologize for that year with that bitch '' . 
  on behalf of all germans , i want to offer our sincerest apologies for that year with that ... bad teacher . 
  i think our language is wonderful , but it 's certainly not one that makes things easy for students . 
  i feel singularily suited for offering these apologies , because i suffered through almost three years of learning swedish at school . 
  it was n't that bad looking back , but at the time , it almost made me fail the entire year . 
  i 'm german and quite patriotic about it . 
  i feel the only people on reddit who think that makes me a nazi are some of our compatriots . 
  that is probably what confused the filmmakers , too . 
  `` so , this newest generation of missiles has a range equal to a tiny fraction of the diameter of a human hair ... better fly really close to the target ! '', 
  well , of course they do . 
  it 's an original document , they ca n't * keep * it . 
  is that when washington was founded ? 
  the company or the river ? 
  yep . 
  i always thought the evolution of languages could be used pretty nicely to explain biological evolution by analogy . 
  i now see what might be the biggest problem there ... 
  quick , what month will it be one year from now ? 
  and do n't use google !, 
  finally this all makes sense to me . 
  i hope you often share you insights about the universe on / r/shittyaskscience . 
  i tried to find out if that is correct , but i do n't know how to do that . 
  can anyone confirm that it will , in fact , be smarch one year from now ? 
  what is your native language , and what did you learn in your { language } classes at school ? 
  i 'm german , and we did n't learn what nouns and verbs are either - not in our german classes , that is . 
  i only really started understanding grammar when i learned latin . 
  in your native language classes , you mostly learn interpretation . 
  of poems , short stories , novels , ... 
  the south was * not * republican , the north was . 
  lincoln was a republican . 
  he won the elections by winning all the northern states , the republicans had very little support in the south at the time , because they were the anti-slavery party . 
  this was ~ 150 years ago . 
  the parties have changed a lot since then . 
  they only became roughly the way you know them in the 1960s . 
  [ if you were trolling , you got what you wanted . 
  if you were serious - well , you can learn from this thread that there are many things that `` everybody knows '' , but every one of us * does n't * know a few of these things . ], 
  well , some people pointed it out already , but nobody really clearly , so i 'll do it . 
  the south ( as in : the confederacy ) did not turn red .
