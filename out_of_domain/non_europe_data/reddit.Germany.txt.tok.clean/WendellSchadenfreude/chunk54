  they turned blue or green , whatever color you want to use for the southern democratic party . 
  the north was red , the north had solid republican majorities . 
  lincoln was a republican . 
  the republicans were the anti-slavery party . 
  of course , this was ~ 150 years ago , and the parties have changed a lot since then . 
  i 'm just going to reply this to a few people , just to make sure you actually see it . 
  this feels like the perfect thread for people to learn something that `` everybody knows '' . 
  the south was not republican , the north was . 
  lincoln was a republican . 
  he won the elections by winning all the northern states , the republicans had very little support in the south at the time , because they were the anti-slavery party . 
  this was ~ 150 years ago . 
  the parties have changed a lot since then . 
  they only became roughly the way you know them in the 1960s .

  it 's a detailed explanation of why they believe to have a right to secede , but as to * why * they would want to do it , they give exactly *** one *** reason : slavery . 
  / u/i _ am_bob was absolutely right ( and quite generous ) when he said this :, 
   so you can say it was the principal of the thing and slavery was not the main cause , but to say it was only a small part is simply not accurate . 
  you think she 'll want for the sexy centenarians to hit on her ? 
  i guess the lesson here is that you should flirt with those who are slightly more than half your age . 
  the thirteen and fourteen year-olds . 
  if i tell you , will you post about it in til ? 
  silly you . 
  in 2000 years , there will be [ only one version of the bible ] ( http://lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=genesis_1 ) , and that one will incidentally also be widely recognized as being the most important cat meme . 
  i suddenly understand why people might get offended by being labeled even with inoffensive terms . 
  i 'd get upset if you insist on calling me `` pink '' . 
  his mindset in this case was sarcasm . 
  fuck everything about that !, 
  also , your character 's name is `` stormblade i furysoul '' . 
  * anything * trumps that . 
  nope , that 's normal . 
  it 's not offensive . 
  if i see you wearing this in berlin , i 'll assume you 're a ( german ) communist . 
  wo n't make me especially like you , but there are rather many communists in berlin . 
  carnival in cologne was brutal . 
  cheap lederhosen ( as shown in the picture , including the red-and-white shirt , was by far the single most common costume . 
  it 's not a bad costume per se , but it was so popular it just looked dumb . 
  if your family is polish , should n't your tattoo show the polish eagle instead ? 
  [ polish coat of arms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_poland ), 
  getting a tattoo of a prussian eagle will make many germans think that you are a nazi sympathizer . 
  but does it really matter what people think of your tattoos ? 
  tattoos in general wo n't improve most people 's opinion of you . 
  if you have a reason to get them anyway , that should n't dissuade you . 
   you can prevent bird strikes, 
   [ most `` window-strikes '' can be prevented easily and inexpensively . 
  birds are highly aware of raptors ( birds of prey ) . 
  just tape a raptor silhouette to your window . 
  birds heading into your window will take notice and change their course .

  i do n't think this is true , by the way . 
  just one of these little things that people in one country are totally convinced of , while most people in the rest of the world have never heard of it . 
  i 'd go with `` alltagstauglich '' . 
  it 's a nice and very german word . 
  this is more or less true , but it 's important to keep in mind that there was no nuclear explosion in chernobyl at all ( neither in the air nor on the ground ) . 
  the explosions in chernobyl were steam explosions or possibly ( oxy ) hydrogen explosions . 
  if the hiroshima bomb had been detonated on the ground , the immediate physical destruction would still have been much bigger than that of all the chernobyl explosions . 
  [ how much sense that chart made . 
  i only have one that i use for both . 
  a statement about * one 's child 's presumed future * spiritual beliefs . 
  hm , good question . 
  because this is germany , they are all somewhat traditional borders . 
  the villages on the one side of a border simply were `` always '' ( i.e. 
  most of the time in the past ~ 500 years ) part of their region , which is a different region than that `` on the other side '' . 
  if you take the border between saxony and bavaria as an example , i guess the divide is quite clear . 
  the dialects are different , the traditions are different , the food ( and the beer ) is different - it should n't usually be hard to tell a bavarian and a saxon apart . 
  ( although i do n't know that i 've ever actually met anyone from the border region . ), 
  but why are there so weird traditional borders between the settlements of bavarians and saxons ? 
  i guess in the end this does usually come down to natural borders , only they happen to be minor rivers or small mountain ridges that are rarely shown in maps . 
  the modern districts were only formed after wwii , to be sure , but they are mostly made up of traditional older regions . 
  the women in the former gdr are * less * likely to be in football clubs ? 
  i 'm surprised . 
  there 's no need for anyone to ask , your religion is already registered . 
  things need to have their proper order , after all . 
  to be sure if it 's that glitch , just check the byzantine court . 
  if most of the emperor 's family has been blinded , it 's because of the recent patch . 
  easiest fix : start a new game . 
  only old saves are affected . 
  if you want to finish your old game , go to your ck2 folder , search for, 
  00_traits . txt and 02_traits . txt , make a backup of these two files somewhere . 
  then use wordpad to move the entire `` siege_leader '' entry ( the last one in 00_traits ) to the end of 02_traits . 
  done . 
  may i ask what your country of origin is ? 
  ( might make explaining some things easier . ), 
  in short : there is no ideal party for you . 
  for instance , no party ( of any relevance ) supports a legalization of home-schooling . 
  the pirates share many of your expressed ideals , and they would be a relatively safe bet : since they are unlikely to have any real power after the elections , they can stay true to those ideals . 
  ( pardon my cynicism . ), 
  of the parties currently in the bundestag , there 's no contest : the fdp is the party for you . 
  if they end up in power though , it will again be in a coalition with the christian democrats , so do n't expect too much when it comes to legalization of cannabis/file-sharing or abolition of religious privileges . 
  that calls for a social experiment !, 
  i shall raise my children to worship the ancient greek pantheon ( zeus , apollo , ... ) , which i do n't do myself . 
  * and * i will teach them that they are wrong to do so . 
  word of caution about the pirates : if they have any power , it will be as part of ( or tolerating ) a red/green `` taxes must go * up * '' coalition .
