  major tax reductions in the next few years are not going to happen , no matter what party is in power . 
  but there have been some minor tax cuts by the current government already , and the fdp is the only major party that is at least theoretically calling for further ones . 
  damn , i ca n't read that , it 's too small ... 
   i dont see your problems about the `` the taxes go up '' . 
  maybe i can help you see it . 
  here ' what op wrote :, 
   i am interested in ( ** this is in order of most to least important ** ) :, 
   tax reduction, 
  op wants tax reductions . 
  `` you should n't want that '' is certainly a possible answer . 
  but the one i chose was `` this party wants tax cuts , and this one does n't . '', 
  edit : `` rich '' is a very malleable term , by the way . 
   above to down, 
  top to bottom . 
  by the way , since everbody seems to be all business here :, 
  welcome to germany !, 
  good to have you here . 
  / r/explainlikeiama / is your subreddit . 
  post as many `` explain like i 'm literally five years old '' questions as you want . 
  eli5 is not for 5 year-olds . 
  there really is no question , you are an fdp voter . 
  most people here just do n't want to tell you this , because most people here do n't like the fdp ( and especially their economic policies ) . 
  ( not that the fdp actually calls for the things you described . 
  but with these positions , in the fdp you will be part of a vocal minority . 
  in every other major party , you will be the enemy . ), 
  does n't sound to me like a realistic scenario at all . 
  have you ever talked about this with any of your pirate friends ? 
  the pirates tolerating friedrich and westerwelle - to me , that sounds about as outlandish as a cdu/linke coalition . 
  i can also see the cdu rather embracing the greens than the pirates . 
  but whoever we blame for it : any form of cooperation between the pirates one the one side and cdu or fdp on the other is simply not going to happen after this election . 
  joey ( from friends ) only learns this [ near the end of this video ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktqcbds8hsc ), 
  i 'm sure you can get the rest on kickstarter . 
  the first part is correct . 
  the second part is roughly `` but i do n't have anyone to do this kind of stuff with me . '', 
  foreigners who have been in the country long enough to almost sound american . 
  [ family guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xsefvwqcxa ), 
  what idiots are downvoting this ? 
  there is no reason whatsoever to believe that there is a relevant number of foreigners among the protesters . 
  the muslim brotherhood , whatever you think of them , is a big party in egypt . 
  what he means is probably that the us are cooperating and partly financing with the egyptian army . 
  they have been doing so for years , basically as a bribe so that egypt leaves israel alone . 
  well , an unsecured router is just a modern way of saying `` make yourself at home - if you see anything you like , just take it ! '', 
  are you surfing on a calculator ? 
  oh , wait , let me try again : * what is this ? 
  a display for ants ? 
  sixty years later , [ these guys throwing rocks at russian tanks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py4iur9fgja&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=24 ) in east berlin are still considered heros . 
  even though the commentator 's laconic remarks are of course correct : `` and so , because stones and courage against tanks are not enough , the revolt died . '', 
  [ well ... explanation , reddit style . 
  ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/4e22f461c30601625b03569e39eb7cd4/tumblr_mljiqz5wsy1rs9bbso1_500.png ), 
  the muslim brotherhood are certainly not nice guys by our standards , and they have the support of many of egypt 's fanatics . 
  killing several hundred protesters is still a massacre . 
  wikipedia is an awesome source for history . 
  to make it a bit more interesting for the start , i 'd suggest you choose one character and read about him first . 
  maybe one of the real `` crusader kings '' , like [ richard the lionheart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_lionheart ) or [ frederick i barbarossa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_i,_holy_roman_emperor ) ( a `` crusader emperor '' ) . 
  read a bit about one of them , then come back a few days later and see how much you remember . 
  one thing that ckii prepares you for is the realization that history was * complicated * , with hundreds of little rulers doing their own thing at any point in time . 
  is talking about rape ok ? 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ get ^ ^ it . 
  i would let the whole horde fuck her . 
  all 40,000 men and their horses , too , if that 's what it took . 
  you are correct , ser . 
  this video is endearingly named [ `` viserys puts it in perspective '' ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqhiulcpgq ), 
  cheap shot . 
  even younger men ca n't swim in armor , and i want to see you go on a crusade ( on horseback ) when you 're almost 70 . 
  german here , we do n't have baggers anywhere , so i have a question :, 
  are american baggers even paid by their employer , or do they work for tips ? 
  why is the bottom text so hard to read ? 
  nope , does n't work . 
  knowing the meaning of the word is good , knowing the `` meaning '' of the prefix is very good , but in many cases , you 'll still have no clue what the combination means . 
  some of your examples :, 
  stellen - put, 
  vorgehen - walk ahead , * but also : * proceed, 
  vorsteigen - * does n't really exist , could be `` climb ahead '' or something like that *, 
  vorstellen - imagine * or * introduce, 
  verstellen - feign , shift , obstruct, 
  look up the rest yourself . 
  there 's really no system in there . 
  i do . 
  it 's not that difficult . 
  people here seem to be worried that this takes a long time and makes the lines stop , but it does n't . 
  in most supermarkets , the check out counter is long enough that the cashier just pushes your items onward into the `` bagging zone '' . 
  that zone is big enough ( and basically split in two parts ) that you can calmly bag your things while they scan the next customer 's stuff . 
  in cheaper super markets , you just put everything back into your cart immediately after it has been scanned ( you can do that as quickly as they can possibly scan stuff ) and bag it later . 
  crannogmen - the people who live in the neck . 
  south of moat cailin . 
  greywater watch . 
  howland reed , meera and jojen . 
  so , did they chase the rest of your army and kill off the 40k survivors , too ? 
  tim minchin [ explains the numbers quite well . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmaezegyfee ), 
  that is only your theory . 
  in some cases , that is true . 
  in others , it is n't . 
  your examples :, 
  1 aufgeben - to give up ( also : to post ( a letter ) ), 
  3 eingeben - to insert , to type, 
  the original meaning is kept to some extent for 2 , 3 , and 4 . 
  but it 's different from the english meaning . 
  ( ausgeben can mean `` to pay for others '' , but not really `` to share '' . ), 
  op is a bad op and deserves bad karma either way .
