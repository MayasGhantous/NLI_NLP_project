  posting about an article that you did n't even really read is not much better than deliberately lying . 
  i opened the comments only to find out if ( and how ) the title was missleading , becaue so many of them are . 
  / u/ehrgeizium did a very good job , and i am grateful for it . 
  edit : damn , sorry - misspelled your name ... 
  well , that 's nice and all . 
  but do try to make some other friends as well , and quickly . 
  it 's * so * easy during he first two weeks of classes , and it will help you a lot to have more than just one ( socially awkward ) friend . 
  they have , in the past ~ 4 years . 
  they only decreased from ~ 2003-2009 . 
  i think you 're confusing different kinds of interest rates . 
  germany has to pay lower rates on her own government debts . 
  that 's a good thing ( for germany ) , simple as that . 
  the fed rate and other central rates are n't directly connected to that . 
  ( although indirectly they are , of course , in many ways . ), 
  those are , as you say , a sign or consequence of the depression . 
   its many virtues might be summarized as `` the banality of the good . '', 
  this is brilliant . 
  he was just pointing out that you made it sound like you did . 
  `` zwar '' is never used alone , it 's always part of a `` zwar - aber '' construction . 
  not about the map , but about the article :, 
   in german jokes , poles are depicted as lazy and unemployed people who distinguished themselves in the art of stealing . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  poles are thieves in german jokes , but they are n't lazy . 
  there 's even a bunch of more modern jokes that really make fun of german craftsmen ( plumbers , builders , ... ) for being so lazy compared to their polish counterparts . 
  of the classic `` thief '' jokes about poland , this is my favorite :, 
   what 's a polish triathlon ? 
   walk to the swimming pool , take a bike back home . 
  you can sell them young at quite a good price . 
  your article claims that there was a minimum decrease ( 0.1 % ) in the first quarter , but also that an increase is expected for the entire year . 
  and those numbers come from the labor unions , they do n't have a history of being too optimistic . 
  are you faster than the guy in * butterfly effect * ? 
  i do n't see how doing a triathlon can be construed as laziness . 
  even if it 's this kind of triathlon . 
  for some reason , that scene seems to be online only in french . 
  does n't really make much of a difference .

  but he starts slow .

  ( great movie , by the way . ), 
  well , you * could * make it by splitting up any other compound that contains hydrogen and/or oxygen . 
  but water really is very common on earth and very cheap , so there 's no reason to ever use anything else . 
  you will be underwhelmed : his posting history is less than one page long . 
  but here 's another piece of weird information for you , expanding on the former one : all the electrons in the universe can be described as being the same one electron that just keeps travelling back and forth through time and thus appears to us to be in so very many places at once . 
  this chart is pure gold . 
  well , of course : the problem with this `` explanation '' is that it does n't really * explain anything * . 
  it is just an idea that seems totally weird but does not really conflict with anything we know about physics . 
  these are two very good messages , and it 's good advice in general . 
   but not really old, 
  insult the beer if you must , but if you insult the cathedral , i 'll drown you in altbier . 
  the people of cologne were only cautious : it was believed that the day the dom was finished would be the day of the apocalypse . 
  i even know some french , but to be honest : i 'd avoid saying `` hors d'oeuvres '' as much as possible , and i 'd call a rendezvous a `` date '' - in both cases because i 'd be worried about butchering the french pronunciation . 
  in the case of demesne - well , i did suspect it was french . 
  i 'm just never certain how `` french '' the english pronunciation of french words really is . 
  you were introduced by an `` internal error '' message ? 
  american tourist at the cathedral : `` is this church pre-wwii ? '', 
  tour guide : `` ma'am , this church is pre-america . '', 
  i just like this story too much to accept that the snappy answer is mostly untrue . 
  it 's only `` risky '' if he has traits that make you not want to have him as a count level vasall . 
  ( mostly ambitious , foreign culture and religion ), 
  if you want to replace him by somebody else , it 's much easier to do that while he still is a baron . 
  7 kingdoms and the riverlands . 
  and yet , here 's what robert says in season 1 , episode 6 :, 
  `` back in our day , you were n't a real man until you 'd fucked one girl from each of the seven kingdoms and the riverlands . 
  - we used to call it ` making the eight . ' '', 
  i do n't remember that the expression was ever used in the books . 
  yeah , i have no idea how that happened . 
  this one sounded a bit passive-aggressive , but before that ... 
  i do n't know , maybe people were offended because they did n't know what the correct answer to your rhetorical questions was . 
  why ? 
  i thought a craven commander only was less likely to get himself killed ( maimed , injured , incapacitated ) in battle . 
  what 's the downside ? 
  ( apart from -2 martial , obviously . ), 
  in addition to aru21 :, 
  the weird thing about the konjunktiv is that most germans would use it quite exactly as you did , with lots of `` w\u00fcrde '' . 
  in a written test , i also suspect that you 're supposed to use the `` real '' konjunktiv . 
  [ this is what / u/slightlysocialist was talking about .

  be happy about this . 
  the ai often puts on hardly any resistance after you 've survived the initial struggles , but this empire might . 
  and you 're not really in too much trouble . 
  they will have many rebellions and civil wars even if you do nothing ; and they are unlikely to actually be aggressive towards you . 
  even if they decide to start a few holy wars against you , what 's the worst that could happen ? 
  you lose a dutchy or two , temporarily . 
  i watched it five , six times wondering why anyone would post a gif of some dude catching a piece of fabric . 
  in case somebody else is as retarded as i am : look at his right arm . 
  it 's a prosthesis . 
  i have n't bothered to check if this is still true , but some months ago , it was always a good idea to form republics from the cities of your own capital province - give the mayor a county and a duchy somewhere ( then possibly revoke the county to keep him weak ) . 
  the republics capital will still be the original city in your capital province . 
  the main benefit of this was that you get additional research from having duke level vasalls in your capital . 
  how dare you insult president streetlamp le moose !, 
  great !, 
  when you do , would you mind paying attention to wether it 's important that your vasall republics hold no land except for their original city ( to keep their research `` focused '' ) - if their holding land elsewhere makes them `` spread their research around '' , it might confuse the issue . 
   the thing that worries me is the vassal republic revoking titles from their duchy and then moving their capital away . 
  that i already checked . 
  never seems to happen . 
  i 'm not sure i 've ever even seen them revoke any county . 
  to move their capital , they 'd have to revoke a county first , then revoke a city in that county .

  great movie , go watch it . 
  do n't watch the two successor movies .
