  they are horrible . 
  his other hand is also controlled by his brain . 
  also awesome , just a little more common . 
   edit : also , multireddit . 
  ah , thanks . 
  just when i had decided that i finally needed to create a syria multireddit myself . 
  i know a few people who barely use theirs - i can ask around if one of them is willing to sell . 
  i do n't see it either . 
  34 is a very high martial skill , is that all ? 
  ( and that guy is a wroth , brave , zealous , aggressive viking-berserker , which does sound kind of scary . ), 
   well i think bismarck was voted the greatest german in a zdf show, 
  i thought that was always gutenberg . 
  in the only example i could find online , it was neither bismarck nor gutenberg , but konrad adenauer . 
  i waw focussing on the fabric . 
  when i looked at his right arm , at first i only noticed that he held his hand rather weirdly . 
  i thought if might have to do with what i believed to be a bandage around his upper arm ... 
  holy shit * what * ? 
  go ahead , give us * any * definition of livings standards by which they are n't on average higher nowadays than they ever were in history . 
  i almost wanted to concede this , but then i realized that i can dismiss it on a technicality : i asked about `` history '' , and hunter-gatherers are prehistoric . 
  ( of course , `` history '' an be used in ways that definetely include hunter-gatherers , but for the lenght of this thread , i 'm gon na argue that `` history '' is * recorded history * and nothing else . ), 
  in any case : i would n't want to be a hunter-gatherer . 
  even if it possibly meant more leisure time . 
  thanks for doing this . 
  it already was a very good post , with you using actual names ( instead of doing the common , but confusing `` my son , my daughter 's son , and my other daughter 's first husband 's son '' thing ) and posting that great chart . 
  for actually posting the answer to your own question , i would name * you * despot if i could .

  if you can survive the regular game , starting the old gods start as a son of lodbrok basically guarantees you world domination . 
  ( not that there is anything wrong with that . 
  it 's loads of fun . ), 
  i ca n't speak for op , of course , but i could do this easily without cheats . 
  learning the basics of this game is hard . 
  beating the ai to bloodly pulp * after * you 've learnt the basics is easy . 
  it possible that he used cheats , of course , but this can easily be achieved without cheats .

  a picture of a bear and a maiden fair ... 
  that was too easy . 
  i created people jumping to reach stuff that would otherwise be out of their reach . 
  they do it all the time in sports such as basketball , but i 'm the one who started it all . 
  tell your friends !, 
  that bug is long fixed . 
  it sometimes made tournament simply never end - they would go on forever , with more and more of your vasalls and courtiers being wounded , maimed , or killed over time . 
  fun bug . 
  so , that 's been fixed . 
  tournaments give you an opinion bonus with all your vasalls . 
  it 's often worth it for new rulers to relieve some of the `` short reign '' trouble . 
  other than that , i think they 're too expensive . 
  i mostly use them for roleplaying , when there 's something to celebrate . 
   only jerusalem is now a handful of territories in france !, 
  that happens . 
  will your heir still inherit them ? 
  if so , it does n't sound like you 're doing too bad . 
  can you just use these french territories to afford a litte reconquista in spain ? 
  are you using any expansions ? 
  well , convert back ... ? 
  ( easiest way to do this is to marry a catholic wife , which gives you the option in your espionage screen to let listen to her `` pillow talk '' . ), 
  i usually would n't advice this , because changing your religion back and forth kinda ruins the roleplaying aspects of the game for me . 
  but if you converted `` on a whim '' once , there 's no reason not to do it a second time . 
  uoh ... is that a ship ? 
   `` if there are two crows in a given area , they will meet up . '', 
  well , i 'll use any chance i get at [ posting my favorite picture ... ] ( http://theboard.byu.edu/media/attached_files/r_115680/attempted-murder-crows.jpg ), 
  / u/geejo , get cracking !, 
  we need answers !, 
  or , if you have a life outside this subreddit , later is fine , too ... 
  i only said it was bad compared to the art - there 's really no shame in that . 
  it was mostly to reassure people who might be able to see op 's imgur-gallery but not this homepage that they 're not missing out on anything . 
  ( but it seems the homepage can in fact handle the traffic just fine . ), 
  well , yeah - if you need them . 
  when you have been ruling for ten years , have no problems with factions , have all laws in place as you want them and already have positive relations with most of your vasalls ( including all the important ones ) , then it 's basically 200 gold for nothing . 
  is this where i link to the relevant xkcd , [ the one about time vultures ? 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/926/ ), 
  by the way , antarctica does n't get much snow . 
  it just never melts , that 's why there is a lot of it . 
  because cold air can hold very little water vapour , the actual precipitation in antarctica is low . 
  so low that most of the continent is technically a desert . 
  the driest desert in the world , in fact , despite being covered in ( solid ) water . 
  i think / u/uyth is at least partly right , and you 're just highlighting the difference . 
  european airports do n't have real `` closing times '' either , but there are some restrictions to keep the noise down at night . 
  [ i tried finding something similar to this for o'hare ] ( http://www.heathrowairport.com/static/heathrow_noise/downloads/pdf/nightflights11.pdf ) , but i do n't think it exists . 
  also , if you look at the gif closely : there 's a time at night when basically all air traffic in europe dies down completely . 
  this does n't seem to happen in na . 
  you are refreshingly naive . 
  this campaign is tongue-in-cheek , of course , but their main goal is to connect climate change denial with hurricanes in the mind of the public ; in other words : blaming their political opponents for hurricane deaths and damages . 
  shameless liar !, 
  the multitudes of generations before me are * dead !, 
  and i 'm also feeling a little qeasy ... 
  one day you might realize that most of the people who disagree with you are not malevolent , they are n't stupid , and they are n't being paid for it . 
  it 's a painful realization . 
  also , if somebody really * is * paying all these other folks in this thread , i want my share !, 
  if i do n't make it through this downtime , you can have my stuff . 
  if somehow i make it , i might revise my will in the future . 
   i 'm trying now to remember how tyrion even came across bronn , and if there are any connections further back with tywin . 
  bronn just happened to be at the inn where cathelyn took tyrion captive . 
  the idea that he was already sent there by tywin sounds extremely tin-foily to me .
