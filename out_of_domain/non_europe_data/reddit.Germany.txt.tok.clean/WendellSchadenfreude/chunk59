  so the two of you do n't get along even for a single month after you moved in ? 
  there is no way us folks on the internet could know if that 's mostly your fault or his . 
  i can somewhat sympathize with him : you moved in to the place where he had previously been living alone ( or with a different roommate who was probably his buddy ) and all of a sudden things just are n't the way he wants them to be anymore . 
  that 's not your fault , of course , but we certainly ca n't tell you if he is actually an asshole or if the two of you just were n't meant to be roommates . 
  do n't look where to put the blame , simply move out . 
  the text g0dy suggested is good ; although given the circumstances , i think you can be more personal , a little less formal . 
  print this out twice , once for him and once for you , give it to him in person . 
  i know this is a somewhat weird mix between a letter and a formal document , but i think it 's appropriate . 
  the personal touch ( and refraining from blame ) might make things easier for both of you , since you probably still want to ( or have to ) live with him for the rest of the month . 
  did you start with `` this '' to show your approval of what redditfakeyjake wrote , or do you have a student called this ? 
  the worst commonly used design in the uk are your water taps . 
  trying to prove that you did n't read the article ? 
   bonus : anti-venom and antivenin are the same thing . 
  wikipedia claims it can also be called * antivenene * . 
  ... if your point is that antivenom and antivenin are both correct words for the same thing , why would you `` correct '' somebody who uses one of these words ... ? 
  did you know that there are english translations of some of morgenstern 's poems ? 
  and they are really quite good ...

  stop acting so crimsonly . 
  breaking bad had the greatest finale of any tv series i 've ever seen , at the end of season 4 . 
  then i found out there 's a fifth season ( halfway out ) . 
  when you want a phrase like this translated , giving the context ( describing the situation that you want to use it in ) helps a lot . 
  that 's really interesting . 
  could you tell us which country that is , and also if it 's boys and girls together ? 
  they are n't adults , either . 
  [ ... and a spot of sugar , too .

  honestly , just because you dared comlain about this ** fan-ta-stic ** heir , i hope she dies in an accident before turning 16 . 
  still working for me , too . 
  what 's the problem for you ? 
  [ and i agree : arumba 's mod is the most important one , playing without it is a horrible drag . ], 
  did you also start your ireland game in 867 ? 
  because if you did , and you still managed to `` win '' it , most pagan starts will be far too easy . 
  if you want to play a viking , it would have to be some icelandic count or something to be any challenge . 
  yes , but what happens ? 
  does nothing happen when you try to start the game , does is crash during startup , does it crash when you start a new game or load an old savegame , does it randomly crash while playing ? 
  when it crashes , does it freeze or does it close to desktop ? 
  did you ever change anything in your game files , for instance to fix the issues with misslabeled traits in the last patch ? 
  does the interface part of the mod work ? 
  ( that is , do you have non-overlapping windows ? ), 
  is the mod listed ( and , i apologize for the question , * ticked on * ) in that little mod selection window that opens before the game starts ? 
  the obvious trouble-shooting of course would be reinstalling the mod , then ( if that did n't help ) reinstalling both the game and the mod . 
  well , the one window i was talking about is [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bwlgdcq.png ) , the little mod selector that starts before the actual game . 
  for the other one , open your council and try to replace one of the counsellors . 
  does the character search window open [ stacked like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vpgk76o.png ) , covering part of the council interface , or neatly [ next to the council window , like this ? 
  if it 's the latter , you know that some part of the mod is working ... 
  you are using a qwerty keyboard , btw , right ? 
   does this recognize that there is absolutely no correspondence between vaccines and disease prevention ? 
  no , it shows that there actually * is * such a correspondence . 
   in reality though, 
  i think you may have been playing * too much ... *, 
  ** g ** is earth 's gravity , 9.80665 meters/sec \u00b2 . 
  the ship would accelerate for the entire first half of the voyage , and it would accelerate ( using its thrusters ) as fast as if it was in free fall close to the surface of the earth ( sans atmosphere ) . 
  there is no reason why this specific acceleration should be used , its just a basically random number used out of convenience because we all have a crude feeling of what it means . 
  ( if you were in board that ship , it would mean that `` gravity '' feels normal to you . 
  only it 's not really gravity , it 's the ship 's acceleration . ), 
  it 's not really time travel . 
  only time passing at different speeds depending on how quickly you move . 
  if you move very quickly ( close to c , the speed of light ) , time * for you * passes slowly - but still in the normal `` direction '' . 
  for the rest of us , it passes normally . 
  if you could get in a space ship that travels at almost-c right now , just fly arround for a few hours ( meassured by your own wristwatch ) and then return to earth , thousands of years would have passed here . 
  that 's a very cool script . 
  no , the first half . 
  after half the voyage , you need to start * decelerating * , so you turn your ship around . 
  when you 're at your destination , your speed is down to 0 . 
  hurray !, 
  na , wenn man so drum bettelt ... 
   the top predator in the food chain and dominant species on earth, 
  always makes me feel a little proud to be described that way . 
  maiming does , too ? 
  did n't know that ... 
  all the time . 
  i ca n't decide if this helps me getting over the anger , or if it only makes me angry all over again . 
  why would you do that ? 
  just give the duchy of munster to someone . 
  the de jure munster provinces ( the three in southwest ireland ) should go with that title , thus effectively splitting this super-duchy in half without destroying any titles . 
  or instead simply grant vasallage of some of the provinces to some other ( irish ) duke . 
  for the lazy or those who think that this is n't a real comment :, 
  that 's weird . 
  still , just give the title to one of the counts in de-jure-munster . 
  he will at the very least be duke of his own province , and after that , you can transfer vasallage of the other counties to him as well . 
  oh ... that 's how i understood * sturmgewehr * . 
  `` failing both times '' to wash you hands , not `` failing to * wash your hands both times * '' . 
   having lived it , this title does n't seem so sensationalized . 
  but it is . 
  it does n't matter if this topic is important to you and the title speaks to you on a personal level . 
  what the cdc said was `` if x , then y '' , what the title says is `` y '' - that 's sensationalization . 
  there 's also simply no need for this : infections * are * scary , and it is a terrifying thought that we might lose our best weapons against them . 
   we know by the year 2050 we 'll need at least another half an earth, 
  who `` knows '' that ? 
  both of them ? 
  i wanted to say that i want to be that cool when i 'm 58 . 
  but honestly : i 'm 28 , and i wish i was this cool * now * . 
  vups ? 
  was that before or after she tried aborting you ? 
  that 's the point : do n't move there !,
