  they might march for harry the heir and his beautiful poor wife - was n't that littlefingers plan ? 
  i never knew sweden was this rich ... 
  you can talk about the rosetta stone or otherwise use the word `` rosette '' in german . 
  there 'll be some kids giggling , but they are the same people who ca n't talk about beavers in english with a straight face . 
  i think that 's what lonelylike wanted to imply : `` rosette '' can mean `` asshole '' . 
  but that 's * only * a slang meaning , nothing to be worried about . 
  normal people wo n't act like you just used a dirty word when your talking about the windows of the strasbourg cathedral . 
  honestly : church window . 
   if it is modifying `` moronic , '' then would n't it be an adjective ? 
  no , an adverb . 
  an adverb is a word that changes or qualifies the meaning of a verb , adjective , other adverb , clause , sentence or any other word or phrase , except that it does not include the adjectives and determiners that directly modify nouns . 
  oh , some people are gon na blame you for that . 
  grownuphonestly : yes , it is . 
  exhibit a : me . 
  you did well . 
  now there 's one thing left to do , to help out some poor future guys : make her understand that by `` being in an informal relationship '' , you do n't mean fucking around with other girls . 
  at least i 'm guessing you just mean becoming a little familiar and building some sort of friendship before going into full-out hardcore relationship mode where you can just * expect * to get a `` good morning text '' . 
  ( if that 's what you mean by `` testing the water '' and stuff , it makes you the good guy in my book . ), 
  teach her that , then ... well , yeah , run . 
  honestly , what 's your point ? 
  i 'm sure a story like this has happened more than once . 
  sometimes the male students may have been clever enough to see this as the deliberate provocation that it is , sometimes they ( at least : some of them ) must surely have taken the bait . 
  does n't mean anything if zazza does n't know exactly where she got the story from . 
  btw , the only thing that sounds odd to me in her account of the story is the use of the word `` freshman '' - clearly an evil sexist term , is n't it ? 
  i fail to see what 's funny aboubwahahah - sorry , could n't go through with this . 
  edit : it really is n't about * grammar * , though . 
  think you 're right . 
  `` mir ist '' does n't really describe you at all ; in a way , it rather describes what the world is like * for you * . 
  stiftung is not exactly `` institute '' , more like non-profit foundation . 
  warentest is literally product-test , ware = product . 
  and that 's what they do , test all sorts of consumer products and publish the results ( for free ) . 
  i 'd rather compare it to calling yourself a footballer when you 're really playing * american * football . 
  this would be the correct use of the word for many people , but not for all . 
  in any case : i did include fish in the list because i wanted to use something from the darker part of what i still believed to be grey area . 
  if you 're right , it 's not grey anymore , but completely black . 
  i 'd be ok with that . 
   `` if i do n't read it , it ca n't be true '', 
  i 'm going to steal this . 
  i think you could have been nicer to him . 
  remember , this * is * important to him , and he is ( probably ) sincere . 
  i do n't agree with some folks here calling you a dick or anything , but you could have been a little nicer . 
  ( of course , he was worse than you in this respect . ), 
  all in all : you did ok . not great , but ok . 
  i think you could have been nicer . 
  if you do n't want to talk to them , tell them so politely . 
  if you 're ok with talking to them , just answer the question . 
  not believing in god does n't mean you ca n't think about what question you 'd ask him * if * your belief happened to be wrong and you actually got the chance to ask him a question one day . 
  `` why did you create life in a way that looks so much like it * evolved * ? '', 
  might have been far more fun . 
  and hypothetically , you might even have had the chance to teach each other a thing or two . 
  there 's no protestant in the supreme court at the moment . 
  ( i know , they are n't `` lawmakers '' . 
  but they are important . ), 
  his answer did n't might sense in any way , though . 
  i 'm an atheist , but if i were to meet god , i 'd ask him lots of questions . 
  ( even though i 'd be embarassed as hell at first . ), 
  if he had asked them `` if you found out there is no god , what would you do ? 
  '' , the answer `` well , i 'm a christian , so this question does n't apply to me . '', 
  would be considered mind-numbingly dumb . 
  these two girls might be zealots with whom there is no reasoning . 
  or they might not be . 
  because op was unnecessarily inclement , we 'll never know . 
  childish and mean without any purpose . 
  she was genuinely happy . 
  you made fun of a typo . 
  way to go ... 
  so that 's were that comes from ... the only german texts i have ever seen that switched back and forth between male and female pronouns were the rulebooks for * das schwarze auge * , a german pen-and-paper rpg . 
  of course , what makes matters worse is that in german there are `` male '' and `` female '' version of every noun describing a person , too . 
  ( e.g. 
  teacher is lehrer/lehrerin , customer is kunde/kundin . ), 
   you could of course freeze or vomit because of a long-term illness - then ( as a german at least ) , you notice that you are a sick person and move from `` mir ist '' to `` ich bin '' . 
  but only to `` ich bin krank '' , not `` ich bin schlecht / \u00fcbel . '', 
   it 's not like [ ... ] he is being an asshole, 
  what do you think how the green poster and the 16 people who `` liked '' the status felt about this ? 
  this is n't one of your buddies who agrees with you and then points out : `` dude , you made a funny typo there . '', 
  it is ( or at the very least : it is guaranteed to come across as ) an arrogant smarter-than-thou `` typical atheist '' who tries to spoil a good thing by poking fun at a friggin * typo * . 
  exactly !, 
  the typo does n't - pointing it out as if it was in any way important does . 
  honestly , put yourself in her shoes . 
   you just had a long conversation with a young man who grew up in an almost fundamentalist christian household , believing that evolution is `` just a theory spread by people who hate god '' and could never-ever be true . 
  after hours of friendly discussion , you convinced him that he might have been taught nonsense . 
  you got him to watch a video explaining evolution , and it made sense to him . 
  by the end of the evening , he borrowed your copy of the selfish gene and seemed really interested about this . 
   you then tell your friends ( mostly fellow atheists ) about this on facebook , and the first response you get is from a christian `` friend '' of yours who points out that you made a speeling misstake - and this is * all he posts , without any further comment * . 
  do n't you think that christian is a dick ? 
  if you ca n't be happy for the fact that your friend is happy , why not just ignore this status ? 
  if they are saints , that 's what they 'll do . 
  that 's what i said . 
  it 's not what they heard . 
  op could deliver and show us the response - he must know his friends better than we do , and if the response was `` oh my , you 're right - what a silly misstake . 
   '' , then i wish to withdraw my criticism . 
  edit : it appears that `` dear president * surname * '' is just as acceptable . 
  see for instance : http://writing.lifetips.com/cat/7939/addresses-for-letters/index.html, 
  well , ok . maybe i * am * the only one who feels this way . 
  i 'd really like to see the facebook reaction , though . 
  ah , thank you . 
  i knew i heard dawkins answer ( well ... kinda answer ) that question sometime , but i could n't find it . 
  i understand that . 
  i think myself that 's it 's a nice saying that can sometimes make people think about why they believe in their specific religion and not in any of the others ; but it 's basically just a rhetoric trick . 
  not believing in * any * god is very diffferent from believing in * any one specific god * ( and none of the others ) .
