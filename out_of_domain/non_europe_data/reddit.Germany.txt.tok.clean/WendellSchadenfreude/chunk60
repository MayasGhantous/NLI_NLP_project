  problem not solved at all . 
  having armies from italy and africa * march * to greece to board a ship sounds like something the ai would do , but certainly not the player . 
  there should simply be a button ( and a hotkey ) that makes every selected army jump on anchored boats in their respective county ( if available ) . 
   friesoythe, 
  called ... ? 
  arumba 's keyboard mod is the only one i use so far . 
  that one offers a hotkey , which is wonderful , but the hotkey still only works for one single army . 
  as a german , that episode is the only reason i know this book at all . 
  he uses it at an audition ? 
  i only remember him reading at a baby shower or child 's first birthday . 
  [ time up !, 
  ] ( http://media.smwcentral.net/dotsarecool/mariolegend/mariolegend_00005.png ), 
  burn them all . 
   integrated arumba 's keybinding + gui tweak mod, 
  so when running ck2 + , i need to deactivate arumba 's mod ? 
  does changing the hotkeys ( for example to work as intended on a german qwertz keyboard ) work the same way as with arumba 's mod ? 
  ( using wordpad + + . ), 
  also , is it just me , or are the links to the paradox forum not working ? 
  edit : also , thank you very much .

  it 's dutch , so as a german , i somewhat understand what he 's saying . 
  i just fear the day a dutchman might hear me trying to sing along . 
  have you ever heard the [ japanese version ] (, 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcyci2wzwzs&amp;list=pl6729e82d3d3c2cb4 ) of dschingis khan 's dschingis khan ? 
  that sounds like a brilliant solution !, 
  it must have attracted crowds !,

  what 's a pencil , grandpa ? 
  i do n't think you can capture ruling queens after sieges . 
  from what you write , i 'm guessing that your other room is in a `` wg '' , a shared flat . 
  if you 'd prefer the studentenwerk room , why not contact your other landlord first ? 
  they might still be ok with letting you out of the contract , possibly in exchange for you paying one month of rent ( so that they have some time to find somebody else ) . 
  paying double rent for one month is annoying , but you should overall still save money if that studentenwerk room is ~ 100 $ cheaper every month after that . 
  how do * you * not know what rewinding is ? 
  it must have something to do with the wind , obviously ... 
  that 's what it 's saying , strictly speaking , but that would be a weird homework : writing several analys ** e ** s about an 80 page section or an entire book , each of these analyses 1-2 sentences long ... 
  nice . 
  especially the shocked expression on the girl 's face . 
  but i think she 'll mostly be disappointed because this guy 's window is just a hole in the wall . 
   antonyms for mammoth, 
  is that a figure of speech ? 
  ( i do n't get it . ), 
  ( sidenote : quotes ' significance , not quote 's significance . ), 
  til americans use the word `` watershed '' in the weirdest way . 
  they do n't mean the drainage divide , they mean the basin . 
  outside north america , a watershed is the line that separates the regions that north americans call watersheds . 
  i would like to see some statistix on this . 
  because , frankly , i doubt it . 
  wikipedia claims that the saint lawrence ( basically the one existing `` pipeline '' ) has an average dicharge of almost 17,000 cubic meters per second . 
  that 's roughly 1.5 * 10 ^ 12 liters per day . 
  according [ to the us epa ] ( http://water.epa.gov/learn/kids/drinkingwater/water_trivia_facts.cfm ) , approximately 400 billion gallons of water are used in the united states per day . 
  by a strange coincidence , that 's the * same * number - 1.5 * 10 ^ 12 liters per day . 
  so if the us decided to get * all * their fresh water from the great lakes , there would be enough water * forever * . 
  the levels would n't go down at all , only the saint lawrence would cease to exist . 
  his name is fring . 
  ( they got that right elsewhere in the article . ), 
  google tells me there are some germans called that . 
  that would not be the correct answer . 
  * bitte * can be `` please '' or `` you 're welcome '' ( the reply to `` thank you '' ) , which sounds confusing enough , but it can not be the reply to * entschuldigung * . 
  ... damn , somebody out-old-fashioned me . 
  i think you are correct in a way , although i would insist that foreigners should n't learn this , because nobody will believe * them * that they are right . 
  most germans , when they say `` entschuldigung '' , will think of it as short for `` ich entschuldige mich '' . 
  traditionally , it * was * short for `` ich bitte um entschuldigung . '', 
  in the latter case , the reply `` bitte '' does make sense . 
  i ca n't believe nobody 's mentioned the only logical answer to this yet :, 
  students of reddit , use thicker paper !, 
  that way , holding it up to the light wo n't help much , * and * the stack will be higher , making it look like you wrote more . 
  the german wikipedia has a [ list of noble rulers named adolf . ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_i . ), 
  roughly 50 guys on there . 
  counts , dukes , granddukes , bishops , archbishops , kings . 
  you can change crown authority once per ruler 's lifetime . 
  you can also use the subjugation cb only once per ruler 's lifetime . 
  ( would be far too strong without this restriction . ), 
  this should n't be affected by crown authority laws . 
  the exception from this rule is that you can try to subjugate as often as you want to in one kingdom as long as you are not king yet and take the ambition to become king of that kingdom . 
  ( careful , you ca n't cancel that ambition . 
  you either see it through or you die trying , but you ca n't simply switch so some other ambition . ),

  ... and a stutter . 
  just to make sure people understand what this would do : being despot counts as being born in the purple . 
  so then what did you mean by `` they learned from the weimar republic '' ? 
  the weimar governments never were dysfunctional because of the small parties . 
  they were dysfunctional because of two of the biggest parties , nazis and communists . 
  the 5 % threshold certainly makes some sense . 
  but most germans always claim that it is `` one of the lessons learnt from the weimar republic '' , and that 's just bullshit . 
  that phrase should be considered a delinquency . 
  as a friend of the fdp : i do n't really know . 
  the fdp managed to have the compulsory military service abolished ( which should have been enough to make their `` left wing '' happy ) and the economic key data alone should be enough to make their `` right wing '' ( and everybody else ) happy . 
  do n't take too much of what you read about them on reddit at face value . 
  the fdp has been vigorously * hated * by the left for decades , and german reddit tends mostly left . 
  keep in mind that the decline is n't quite as big as it seems . 
  the 15 % in the last election were exceptional , 6-8 % is more normal for the fdp . 
  i guess the biggest single problem was that everyone who is content with the government voted `` merkel '' . 
   and if it was the doing of the fdp, 
  threre is no `` if '' there . 
  the cdu/csu had campaigned to keep the compulsory service , the coalition abolished it - because of the fdp . 
   also i think the biggest misstake was the tax reduction for hotels . 
  it was clear clientele politic, 
  that certainly got bad press .
