  but if it was clientele politics , why did even the communists ( and , less obviously , greens and spd ) agree with it * before * the elections ? 
  @citizen rights : wan na bet we get retention of telecommunication data ( vorratsdatenspeicherung ) within the next four years ? 
  you 're not married , are you ? 
  just to make shure nobody overestimates the importance of the above map , here 's another one :, 
  [ black is where merkel 's cdu/csu was the strongest party . 
  ( red - social democrats , purple - socialists , former gdr 's ruling party ), 
  i 'm not sure if that 's what the meme is talking about .

  but it is , of course , his nine iron , a golf club . 
  there are different forms of colorblind . 
  in many cases , it might be best for you to imagine it like hearing is for me and ( presumably ) you : i can tell high pitch tones and low pitch tones apart , of course . 
  but let me hear one note now and another ( somewhat similar ) one in a few minutes , and i 'll have no idea which one is higher - they might even be the same and i could n't be sure . 
  some people have absolute pitch and can tell you what exact note they just heard without needing any other notes for comparison . 
  now imagine a world where almost everyone has perfect pitch - many people would just believe that the two of us must be quiet dumb because we ca n't identify c minor . 
  thanks . 
  let 's start with a word of caution : asking german reddit about the fdp is like asking / r/politics about the tea party - most answers you get will be worse than useless . 
  i think some of the hatred actually still goes back to 1982 . 
  the fdp was in a coalition with the spd , but was unhappy with chancellor schmidt 's course . 
  so without waiting for the next election , they just left the government and agreed with the cdu to elect helmut kohl as the new chancellor . 
  yes , they can do that - the chancellor is elcted not by he people , but by the bundestag , and the bundestag majority can elect a new chancellor whenever they want to . 
  kohl called for early elections , and the fdp barely survived those . 
  many of their former left-wing members abandoned the party , and the left was quite bitter about the fdp 's `` treason '' . 
  so , this would be the root ... from there on , i think it just developed a life of its own . 
  hating the fdp , even if you had no real idea * why * , became to be seen as a valid political opinion on the left . 
  thus , i think most people who hate the fdp today do so * because it 's easy * . 
  [ i think you can somewhat compare it to hating george bush . 
  there may have been many reasons to do so , but for most people , these reasons actually would n't matter much . 
  they do it because it gets cheap approval . ], 
  abolishing the compulsory military service , lowering taxes for hotels , reducing unemployment . 
  oh , wait - they promised these things , and that 's also what they actually did . 
  makkiii must be talking about something else . 
  i think you 're using more sarcasm than is good for online discussions , especially with foreigners present for whom it may be harder to decipher . 
   lowering taxes for hotels showed clearly that all they had in mind was to please a very small group of fdp voters . 
  and why do you think the communists also wanted to reduce the taxes for hotels ? 
  to please fdp voters ? 
  military service was * not * abolished in the 1990 's , but in 2010/2011 . 
  and * only * because of the fdp - the cdu/csu had loudly and clearly campaigned to keep it . 
  ( it 's a different matter that it was easy enough for many people to get out of it . ), 
  i read your argument . 
  more than 60,000 men were still drafted per year in the 2000 's , and that does n't even include the alternative civilian service . 
  that 's not nearly the same thing as ** 0 ** since 2011 . 
  btw , i was serious with my question about the communists and the hotel taxes . 
  ( edited for a more civil tone . ), 
  formed for me playing a norse character yesterday . 
   if they had n't ended conscription 2011 by law it would have ended some years later by court order, 
  possible , but not certain . 
  in any case , the cdu wanted to keep the draft . 
  @taxes for hotels : [ election menifesto of the `` linke '' , 2009 . 
  just search it for `` hotel '' or something . 
  ] ( http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/wahlen/pdf/beschluss_bundestagswahlprogramm_redtb_revms_final.pdf ), 
  many greens and social democrats also supported this * before the elections * , although in their case there is no clear evidence for it in the election manifestos . 
  ( the spd for instance proposed in the bavarian parliament that bavaria should try to get the taxes for hotels reduced , this must have been ~ 2007 . ), 
  the csu defended the draft tooth and nail , they did n't just come around on their own , but because they * had to * , as part of the price they had to pay for the coalition . 
  this was a major success of the fdp , wether you want it or not . 
  of course the fdp wanted the cms gone long before that , but they had n't been in the government for ten years . 
  ( btw , the greens had been . 
  they also claimed they wanted to abolish it , but did nothing . ), 
  civil rights : the cdu always demanded the retention of telecommunication data for all citizens ( vorratsdatenspeicherung ) . 
  the fdp is the only reason we do n't have that ( yet ) . 
  just one example ... 
  [ translation btw : the poster says that the sixt cars have `` more seats than the fdp '' - the current smaller coalition party that got less than 5 % of the votes and will thus have no seats in the next bundestag . ], 
  you might miss the warmth , and i 'm not only talking about the weather . 
  compared to most other nations , germans might seem quite cold and distant at first . 
  if you do n't have/make any friends here , this might make you feel very lonely . 
  also , probably he biggest problem : many foreigners have moved to germany in the past few years . 
  if you 're not fluent in german , that might make it difficult to find a job .

  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/603/ ) for all those who claim that the movie is oh so true ... 
  no , they made that promise long before the election , and long before the donation as well . 
  the nickname was n't `` earned '' , it was propaganda used by parties who * also * supported lower taxes for hotels before the elections . 
  and yes , they did promise lower taxes for everyone , only some of which came . 
  ( there were tax cuts e.g. 
  for families , only they were n't as substantial as people had hoped they would be , and nobody wanted to hear about them . ), 
  so you made them look bad until they got fired .
