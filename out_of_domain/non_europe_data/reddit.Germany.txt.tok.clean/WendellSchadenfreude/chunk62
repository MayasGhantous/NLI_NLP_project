  are you proud of what you 've done ? 
  well , this was n't something they only promised , it was something that they pomised * and * kept . 
  a small thing , admittedly . 
  i already posted it elsewhere in this thread , but it is a great video about this . 
  take your time for four minutes from the bundestag . 
  [ j\u00f6rg van essen giving examples of how all the parties of the political left supported the hotel tex breaks * before * the elections . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuw6abe9uk ), 
  i know this cost the fdp a lot of support , obviously . 
  my point is : it should n't have , there was n't anything wrong with it . 
  the version of the story as it is usually reported is simply a lie . 
  the same question was asked one month ago , here 's the link : [ eli5 : why are there no foreign military bases in the us yet america has military bases all over the world ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kjxix/eli5_why_are_there_no_foreign_military_bases_in/ ), 
  but make sure this does n't sound like you just quit ( or worse : got fired ) after six months ... 
  your map marks the middle east as it 's own continent . 
  you might either chose your maps more carefully when you decide to insult people , or you might want to go back through a couple grade-school level geography courses . 
  [ edit : ok , he started it . 
  that being said , `` north america '' does usually , but does n't * necessarily * mean the entire north american continent , it can also just refer to mexico , the united states , and canada . 
  `` central america '' is a region that obviously exists , despite not being a continent . 
  uh , that 's ugly . 
  please do n't . 
  they do n't like it when you talk about glitches and bugs , because it 's not a bug . 
  it 's been created by the players . 
  [ am i doing this right ? ], 
  if you 've never heard of the all blacks , you have to watch a few videos of what they do before their games . 
  [ like this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj4wmc3higw ) . 
  it 's called a haka , and it 's something like a traditional maori war dance . 
  it 's not , and nobody will show it that way . 
  it 's a separate * region * , not a continent . 
  just like the middle east . 
  - i am actually surprised anyone would draw a map like the one you provided , btw . 
  edit : just for the fun of it , here are two interesting maps . 
  [ number 1 ] ( http://www.seanews.com.tr/images/articles/2013_08/108696/mainmap.gif ) [ number 2 ] ( http://iesalminares.wikispaces.com/file/view/worldmap_en.gif/57560056/572x299/worldmap_en.gif ) - i think they are both pretty terrible , but that 's beside the point . 
  in this case though , i 'm pretty sure it 's not an index based on a year . 
  100 very likely indicates `` average turnout '' , that is the same turnout as the nation as a whole had - roughly 60 % turnout . 
  150 would then indicate a turnout of 90 % ; 50 would indicate only 30 % tunout . 
   in parts of germany , namely in the south , many people consider it a day of great sadness, 
  i 'm having a hard time believing this . 
  there may be a small minority who thinks that way , but my guess would be that it 's roughly the size of the bayernpartei ( `` bavaria party '' , semi-serious separatist ) - 5k members , 2.1 % of the vote in bavaria . 
  also , i think iamambience is a genius , a great inspiration , and one of the world 's most distinguished philantropists . 
  you can now truthfully say that in 2013 , iamambience was labeled a genius and so on . 
  tectonic . 
  they react surprisingly fast , taking into account that we are talking about geological time spans here , i.e. 
  hundreds of thousands of years at the very least . 
  there are linguists who will tell you that every `` mistake '' that a native speaker makes is just \u201e non-standard use '' . 
  dramatik pur !, 
  i 'm quite sure they did , but less - because gravity was afraid of them . 
  also , this was like hundreds of years ago , so maybe gravity still flowed in a different direction . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  you know that you should have started your post differently , right ? 
  you should have opened with an exited : `` geologist here ! '', 
  damn ... they are the same word in german . 
  ( diskret ), 
  the pronounciation is the same for both , right ? 
  my recommendation for new players nowadays would be : play * anything but ireland * . 
  in tog it 's difficult ; in 1066 it 's mindnumbingly boring . 
  for a fun and easy game , just play an old gods norse pagan . 
  you have many soldiers , there are rarely any real outside threats , and you have many strong casus belli . 
  ( cbs are one of the most difficult concepts in the game , so this helps a lot . ), 
  gavelkind inheritance is the only real problem , but at least this teaches you early on how important inheritance laws are . 
   1066 sweden would be my suggestion . 
  it 's where i started to learn the game most . 
  is n't that quite difficult for newbies ? 
  your strongest vasall is erik the heathen . 
  he is actually stronger than you are and almost guaranteed to rebel early on because he 's norse and you 're christian . 
  i 've never played it myself , but i would imagine that you can easily lose most of your power within the first few years if you do n't already know how to deal with powerful vasalls . 
  that is only the least amount ( or more precisely : lowest percentage ) of votes possible at equal voter turnout in all states . 
  in the spreadsheat , he just assumes 100 % turnout . 
  more than that , actually , because the basis for the calculations in the spreadsheat is the entire population , not just the smaller voting age population . 
  if turnout was low in the small states and high in the big states , far less than 21 % of the popular vote is required . 
  taking the example / u/mooseatwork used to the extreme , the 40 small states could have been won with only one single voter showing up in each of them ( unless there are some rules about minimum required turnout in these states that i am not aware of ) . 
  high turnout in the ten big states can still mean that more than 150 million people cast their vote . 
  all of them , except for the 40 voters from the small states , can vote against you , and you still have a majority in the electoral college . 
  you win with far less than 1 % of the vote . 
  about 0.00003 % , i think . 
  [ one might say this is more extreme if you turn it around and win the biggest ten states + wyoming , each with one single voter turning out . 
  but then overall turnout would also be lower . ], 
  [ i think they 're talking about this .

  i did n't even know that the pope could grant you two invasion cbs at the same time . 
  good to know . 
  they are just * too damn important * , they ca n't be deactivated . 
  just imagine the catastrophic consequences if raiders hit one of your siege camps and you are n't immediately informed !, 
  [ here 's the wikipedia article about the names of germany in different languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_germany ) . 
  when you learn german words , it 's best if you * always * learn them with the article , right from the beginning . 
  makes things easier in the long run, 
  train - der zug, 
  i heard on reddit that most people who complain about monopoly taking too long seem to play without auctions . 
  no idea if that 's true , i never liked monopoly myself . 
   buying property, 
   whenever you land on an unowned property you may buy that property from the bank at its printed price . 
  you receive the title deed card showing ownership . 
  place the title deed card face up in front of you . 
   ** if you do not wish to buy the property , the bank sells it at auction to the highest bidder . 
  ** the high bidder pays the bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the title deed card for that property . 
   * any player , including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price , may bid . 
  bidding may start at any price . 
  if you think that the states should have more power than they do now , running in a state wo n't help much - the states wo n't get more power than they currently have unless some people in the federal government agree that they should . 
  these popups are all so horrible . 
  not only can they not be disabled , but also , * if you ever really are interested * in what they have to tell you , they do n't even tell you what province they are talking about . 
  ( the one you showed does , but first you have to find out where `` kempten '' is . ),
