  we sometimes make thought experiments about what would happen if the sun suddenly stopped providing us with free warmth and energy . 
  just imagine that some bacteria might be having the same thought experiments about * you * - you are their only source of warmth and energy ; what would they do if their human suddenly stopped working . 
  sadly - for both bacteria and humans - , this happens all the time . 
   `` no friend ever served me , and no enemy ever wronged me , whom i have not repaid in full . '', 
  he was from the family of the cornelii , and the motto of their house is : `` a cornelia always pays his debts . '', 
  and beer can make you forget all about that . 
  beer is so awesome . 
   i honestly have no used legacy of rom, 
  never used retinues ? 
  of course he thinks the federal government should have * some * powers , the ones granted to the federation in the constitution . 
  for congress : [ article 1 , section 8 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/constitution_of_the_united_states_of_america#section_8 ), 
  i 'm not even saying that limiting federal powers that much is a good idea , but * if * you think it is , you have to run for federal office . 
  it 's just silly to demand that ron paul should n't run for federal office because he believes that the federal level is too powerful compared to the states ' . 
  i 've never actually played one of the sons of lodbrok , but i imagine they should be very suitable for newbies . 
  conquer england , or conquer scandinavia , or just pillage all of europe - who 's gon na stop you ? 
  that 's because noone ever asks about the rights that * are * mentioned in the constitution . 
  ask ron paul wether he thinks that congress should provide and maintain a navy . 
  i 'm sure he 'll say yes . 
  ( he might also say that the navy is currently bigger than it needs to be , but that 's beside the point . ), 
  if you think that rp 's standard answer ( `` the government should n't do anything about this . '' ), 
  is just being lazy , please tell me :, 
  do you think the united ** nations ** should make stricter or more liberal gun control laws for america ? 
  what about health care , do you think the united nations should regulate that ? 
  my answer to these ( and all similar ) questions would be that the un should n't do jack about it , because it 's none of their business and should be decided on us level ( or below ) . 
  non-american myself . 
  i noticed many people saying `` i 'm from < country  , we have universal healthcare and it 's not an issue at all , i do n't understand how there is even a debate about this in america . '', 
  i tried finding an analogy for these people , and i think this one might work :, 
  imagine you grew up in a country where the government provides accomodation for everyone . 
  when you finish high school and want to move out from home , you just tell the government where you want to live , and they provide a place for you . 
  the government plans ahead , so they build new houses when the population is growing . 
  when you get married or have kids , you can get a bigger place . 
  old people or the handicapped can get places closer to the city centers and closer to public transport . 
  does n't it just sound wonderful ? 
  growing up in such a country , i 'm sure most of us would wonder how there could possibly be places where people would n't want this . 
  `` in america , you have to find someone who owns an apartment and is willing to rent it to you ? 
  you have to do that * yourself * , and they take * rent * ? 
  what if they simply take * too much * rent ? 
  how would i even find a place in a city where i do n't live yet ? '', 
  now if obama decided to craft an `` affordable living act '' that basically turns america into a country where the government provides houses for everyone , the details would n't matter much : that would be a bad law , and people ( in that case : not just the republicans ) would be outraged . 
  the republicans are claiming that `` obamacare '' basically does the same thing to health care . 
  i do n't want to be the judge of how far that is true . 
  edit : come on - do n't just downvote , tell me what is * so * wrong with the analogy that other people should n't even see it . 
  i 'm quite sure i do n't understand your comment . 
  it sounds somewhat belligerent to me , i 'm just not sure if that 's intentional . 
  what 's called welfare ? 
  my housing analogy ? 
  [ i 'm european , so i 'm going to bed now . 
  take your time if you want to reply . ], 
  russia is a bit strange about this . 
  they call germans `` nemetskiy '' , basically the same word that all other slavs also use . 
  but for the country , they use `` germaniya '' . 
  nope , no idea . 
  thanks for the great reply . 
  i do n't know the details of what `` obamacare '' acutally * does * , so the analogy was n't meant to be correct here - but thank you for providing some details . 
  anyway - i just wanted to show why many foreigners do n't understand the american debate at all ; and why this not-understanding does n't prove anything about government-run health care ( or other systems ) . 
  they do n't have to be good for people to get used to them very quickly . 
  this has n't changed . 
  `` anonymous applications '' are rare , and unless the company specifically asks for it , i 'm pretty sure that not sending a photo will still mean that you have no chance at getting hired . 
  what 's the green stuff on some of the roofs ? 
   interestingly , in the groups of animals fed with the nk603 with -, 
  out r application , similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor, 
  incidence and mortality rates were observed . 
  edit : vergiss das paper . 
  omfg !, 
  `` found at the market '' ? 
  - that 's what google translate makes of this , anyway ... 
  is there a deeper meaning to this ? 
  hallo , runilith !, 
  it 's not . 
  have a look at the article . 
   to make the pills , researchers processed the feces until it contained only bacteria , and then encapsulated the bacterial concentrate inside three layers of gelatin capsule . 
  this ensured the pills would n't leak or disintegrate until they were past the stomach and into the small intestine [ ... ], 
  this is orally applied . 
  i think that 's new . 
   before the big bang, 
  `` before the big bang '' is like `` north of the north pole '' . 
  you 're talking about something that just does n't exist . 
  for drinking water , the [ us epa has defined a maximum contaminant level goal ] ( http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm#one ) of no more than 7 million fibers of asbestos per liter . 
  at this level , there is no known or expected risk to human health . 
  for asbestos in solid foods , there is no established analytical method to determine the concentration . 
  there is so far no conclusive evidence that ingested asbestos is harmful to humans . 
  ( inhaled asbestos fibers * are * harmful . 
  * do n't smoke your yoghurt !, 
  ingested asbestos * may * be harmful , so deliberately adding asbestos for flavor is a bold and probably illegal move . 
  but if some tv channel tells you that asbestos has been detected in your favourite yoghurt , just keep eating it and do n't worry about it . 
  [ you can get oat cereal that 's free of asbestos at xkcd . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/641/ ), 
  some were stabby , some were crushy . 
  my god , you 're a clever one !, 
  [ here , go talk to stephen hawking . 
  ] ( http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html ), 
   since events before the big bang have no observational consequences , one may as well cut them out of the theory , and say that time began at the big bang . 
  events before the big bang , are simply not defined , because there 's no way one could measure what happened at them . 
  this kind of beginning to the universe , and of time itself , is very different to the beginnings that had been considered earlier . 
  i think the point is just that the reaction does n't necessarily stop at a some point , you could keep it going forever , and while it runs , it provides more energy than it consumes . 
  basically , a simple campfire has q = infinity - you could keep putting on new coal/wood forever , and the energy you get from the fire is much higher than the energy you needed to start the fire ( the denominator of the q factor ) and the energy it takes to move the coal . 
  ( the chemical energy bound in the coal - what actually is converted into heat - would not be included in the calculations . ), 
  this is n't literally true * forever * , of course , but there is no obvious point at which the reaction will have to come to an end . 
  always hard to give relationship advice on the internet , but i 'll have a go .
