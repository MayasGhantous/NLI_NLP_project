  it 's possible that he shut down the discussion because what little you said already challenged his ( hitherto unquestioned ) beliefs in a way that made him want to think about them alone . 
  nobody , not even your boyfriend , will just lose their belief * during a discussion * because of a rational argument . 
  if he thinks for a while about what you said , he may come to agree with even some of what you did n't get to say . 
  [ just imagine if something he said had `` opened your eyes and made you see the truth of christianity '' - you would certainly have needed some time for this to actually take effect , because it would have changed your life a lot . 
  losing his faith or even just questioning it might mean he feels the need to change his life even more . ], 
  on the other hand , it 's very well possible that he does n't actually contemplate your beliefs or lack thereof , that he will never change or question his opinion , and that the relationship will end at some point because he will never be happy with a non-beliefing girlfriend . 
  in this case , sooner is better than later . 
  i find this map very interesting , but i do n't think it should be on here . 
  as a map , it 's rather disappointing , mostly because the color code makes it hard to read . 
  on the road from hama/homs to aleppo . 
  if you wear a suit because you think you look good in it , that 's cool . 
  button as you like it . 
  most times people wear suits , they also want * other people * to think they look good and know how to dress . 
  if that is the case , * do n't * touch that button . 
  man , there are people still downvoting this ? 
  they must really like their black suits ... 
  edit : when i wrote this , he was at -5 or so . 
  everybody does that . 
  if a person shows up to a job interview in a jumpsuit or a track suit , i bet you 'd also think less of them before they even open their mouth . 
  not dressing `` correctly '' ( that is : following these arbitrary rules ) says something about you . 
  it proves you either do n't know how to dress , or you think you do n't have to . 
  if i tried to sneak into zenugerman 's circles , they could easily tell that i do n't belong there before i open my mouth . 
  but that 's not because their rules are pathetic , it 's because i really do n't belong there . 
  the rules work , and * that 's * why you follow them . 
  wow , you get a lot of hate for this . 
  i think it was a very informative and useful post . 
  * obviously * , these rules are arbitrary . 
  i do n't see why people feel the need to point this out ; all social norms are arbitrary . 
  you could easily make me out as a faker if i tried acting like i belonged in your group . 
  but i would * be * a faker , so the rules make sense . 
  just so that you also learn something from this ( besides the english grammar that was already corrected ) : if you talk about stephen hawking and do n't know how to spell his name , my colleagues and i would immediately spot you as a non-scientist . 
  could someone who knows more about this confirm this ? 
  i know the button is always left unbuttoned , but are corpses really exempt from this rule ? 
   you expect down votes because you are selectively picking facts and ignoring others . 
  while the image that started this thread was an unbiased and complete representation of all the relevant facts . 
  bet you missed your chance at a far greater victory . 
  `` invasion '' is a cb for one de jure kingdom . 
  when you `` enforce demands '' , that 's what you get . 
  but you * also * get all the land you occupied , no matter which de jure kingdom it was in . 
  after beating the hre , you could just have kept going until you get * all their land * when making peace . 
  with holy wars , you get the duchy that you declared war for ; no matter what you occupied . 
  with great holy wars ( crusade etc. 
  ) , you get a defined kingdom . 
  invasion is better . 
   to another object in the galaxy, 
  for easier understanding , i wanted to point out that this method really only works within our galaxy , the milky way . 
  other galaxies are too far away , so the angle at which we see them hardly changes during the course of a year . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your problem . 
  imagine you are in a [ football stadium . 
  ] ( http://www-personal.umich.edu/~copyrght/3datlas3/images/googleearth/footballstadium.jpg ), 
  you meassure how far every other person in that stadium is from you , and you 're done : you can now draw an image of what the stadium is shaped like ( even if you 've never seen an aerial picture of a stadium ) and where inside that stadium you are . 
   there is almost never a day that goes by where i do n't believe that i am not good even if something bad happened . 
  i do n't think you did n't use not enough negations in that sentence . 
  actually , it may just have been one too many . 
  that aside : keep it up . 
  choosing to be happy is an important part of being happy for most of us . 
  just stop building anything . 
  use the money to hire mercenaries , crush the enemy 's main army first , hunt down every army he has until nothing remains , then start sieging down his holdings . 
  i do . 
  so - how are you ? 
  very good post . 
  except for this part , where your math does n't work :, 
   then you could say that a laborer 's day of 25 denarii would equate $ 72.5 today , and this would give a conversion rate of about $ 5 per denarius . 
  1 denarius should n't be 5 $ , but rather 3 $ . 
  ( not that this really changes anything . ), 
  it 's an interesting choice - the `` product '' is really somewhat comparable throughout all of human history . 
  more so at least than almost anything else . 
  that being said , i doubt that demand was anywhere near constant , and neither was supply . 
  in a way , this is a correct answer ... 
  but i guess the question was n't `` i have this roman coin , how much can i get for it ? 
  '' , it was more `` this gladiator won 100,000 denarii in price money - in today 's world , would that be like an baseball player earning 100 million dollars ? '' . 
  in this case , comparing the value of the metals is a bad approximation at best . 
  or maybe she was , which would make the story even worse . 
  a beater in this case being a car ?

  ethnic dutch . 
  culture frankish , so at least that 's one thing his vasalls will like about him . 
  ethnicity does n't have any effects on the gameplay , only on your character 's looks . 
  that 's why it 's not mentioned anywhere in the standard game . 
  nope . 
  pelves . 
  or pelvises , but pelves is more latin and thus better . 
  your example is weird . 
  `` sie sind '' , with a capitalized `` sie '' , does not belong where you put it . 
  instead , it should be :, 
  * ich bin - wir sind ( 1st person singular and plural ), 
  * du bist - ihr seid ( 2nd person singular and plural ) * or * sie sind - sie sind ( also 2nd person , singular and plural are identical , formal or polite form ), 
  * er/sie/es ist - sie sind ( 3rd person singular and plural - non-capitalized `` sie '' ), 
  or even clearer , ordered in my prefered way :, 
  * du bist ( 2nd p. sg ) * or * sie sind ( 2nd p. sg , formal ), 
  * ihr seid ( 2nd p. pl ) * or * sie sind ( 2nd p. pl , formal ), 
  well , it 's * a * point . 
  i do n't think it 's * the * point - the metric system would be superior even if only few people used it . 
  [ i loved this scene from how i met your mother .

  also , how is the photo `` unexplained '' ? 
  it was taken by the police , and it shows a crime scene . 
  wow , what a mystery ... 
  i 'm agnostic about their existence .
