  of course i ca n't prove that there are n't any gnostic atheists . 
  it 's possible that they exist , but i do n't believe it . 
  so you yelled back : `` seeing you is a pleasure as always , old bean ! '', 
   there is a big difference though between an armoured footman or knight ( who could indeed move pretty ok and fight in hand to hand combat ) and heavy cavalry . 
  i 'm confused - knights * are * heavy cavalry , are n't they ? 
  did they ? 
  from their transatlantic `` incursions '' ? 
  seems unlikely to me . 
  the vikings did take slaves on their other expeditions , of course , but it seems almost wasteful to take slaves among the north american indians to take them back to europe - you 'd have to feed them for several weeks , when it would be so much easier to just take slaves * in * europe . 
  not to defend the role that columbus played as governor , but the main reason for the depopulation of hispaniola was almost certainly [ lacking immunity to european diseases ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas#depopulation_from_disease ) . 
  disease killed ~ 90 % of the native american population elsewhere , there 's no reason to believe that hispaniola 's native inhabitants were more immune to this than others . 
  also , the population of the entire island is less than 20 million today . 
  it sounds unlikely that it was `` millions '' in pre-columbian times . 
  on wikipedia , you find [ a number of 250,000 instead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hispaniola#post-columbian ) . 
   the natives had no immunity to european diseases , including smallpox , and entire tribes were destroyed . 
  from an estimated initial population of 250,000 in 1492 , 14,000 arawaks were left by 1517 . 
  just to make sure i understand your point : columbus was a mean man , so when talking about him , historical accuracy does n't matter . 
  is that is ? 
  granted , that is pretty much what op also said . 
  i started out saying this :, 
   not to defend the role that columbus played as governor, 
  i 'm not defending columbus , i 'm just insisting on the truth . 
  saying that mlk day should n't be celebrated because mlk massacred all the australian aborigines would be an idiotic position , because it 's based on false factual claims . 
  that `` millions '' lived on hispaniola pre-columbus , and that columbus ' policies killed nearly all of them , are also factual claims . 
  and they are also false . 
  the former because there were far less than a million people , the latter because the majority ( likely ~ 90 % ) of them died from diseases that were completely independent of columbus ' policies . 
  columbus and his people * did * kill most of those who did n't die from disease . 
  wether columbus day should be celebrated is a different question . 
  ( i think it should , although we should n't celebrate columbus as a person . ), 
  and yet we got the freedom . 
  ( freedom strictly in the sense of `` freedom to drive as fast as your car will allow '' , of course . ),

  thank you for the question . 
  the number of people who believe in some god used to be very close to 100 % - does that mean that god 's existence was more certain at that time and is less certain now ? 
  i hope it 's no longer true today , but for the longest time , almost everybody on earth believed in witchcraft or some form of magic . 
  i 'm quite sure that 's all rubbish . 
  are you telling me i should n't be , because what so many people believe in must be true ? 
  maybe the jews are right , then 0.5 % of the world are right - more than 99 % would thus be wrong , even though some 55 % at least come somewhat close . 
  truth is not decided democratically . 
   though technically the grandfather is someone 's son . 
  you could change the riddle to say `` two fathers and * their * two sons '' . 
  `` two fathers , each accompanied by his son '' - ok now ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  i was thinking about adding `` respective '' , but that makes it somewhat sound as if each father had two sons . 
  i do n't think it does . 
  that is not true , since he was n't yet 21 . 
  sex between a 14 year-old and a 17 year-old is [ legal in missouri ] ( http://www.ageofconsent.com/missouri.htm ) . 
  if that is true and argument is simply silly from both sides , why is he in major legal trouble , and she is n't ? 
  the point is : saying `` allegedly '' does not imply that she lied . 
  it only implies that he has n't been proven to be a rapist . 
  i do n't think you 're reading the page you linked to correctly . 
  since he was 17 and she was 14 , having sex was legal for them ( or would have been ; sober and consensual ) . 
   [ missouri , like most states , takes the difference in age between the partners into account when one or both of them are under the age of consent .

  that 's not what `` creationism '' means . 
  and for millions of others , it means something else . 
  for millions of people , being an atheist means being a babykiller . 
  but it actually just means being a non-believer in any deities . 
  stick with the actual definition of words , or you end up talking garbage . 
  `` telling everyone that disagrees with you they should burn in hell for eternity '' is not what being a creationist means ; it means believing that life or the world were created by a supernatural being . 
   alleged rapist, 
  thank you . 
  point is : if people believe her , he * is * in legal trouble , big time . 
  if people believe him , she is n't . 
  thus , the line of argument is n't the same from both sides . 
   why does he deserve a fair chance but she does n't ? 
  she does , of course . 
  who said she did n't ? 
  nobody is considering sending her to jail . 
  our discussion is a bit complicated by the fact that it is unclear what shootinwilly really wanted to say with his comment . 
  i thought he was poking fun at the fact that most people here are more than willing to believe her version of the story , no questions asked . 
  if your point was that ( in absence of other evidence ) his version of the story does n't deserve more credibility than her 's , i agree with you . 
  my point just is that in this case , both of them should be considered innocent of any crime . 
  i had one for a few years .
