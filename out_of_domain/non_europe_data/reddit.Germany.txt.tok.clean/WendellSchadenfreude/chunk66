  in this case ( new ruler whom presumably nobody likes ; you being a strong vasall ) , rebellion sounds logical . 
  if you 're too scared , accept the loss . 
  setbacks are what keeps the game fun . 
  and after a few generations at most , your family * will * take revenge . 
  that 's one of those overprized apple products , right ? 
  [ german here , homeschooling is illegal in germany ], 
  when americans are homeschooled , does that usually mean that their only teachers in that year are their parents ? 
  or do people hire teachers for some `` subjects '' ? 
  do you homeschool kids together with a few neighbours ? 
  no , no , mommies . 
  mailman got around . 
  [ edit ende ], 
  tried the vikings ? 
  important notes about them : make sure they have enough ships for their men - sometimes mercs need one extra ship to transport the company . 
  when you hire them , use the ships to transport them to your target , then disband the ships immediately - their monthly fee drops from 30 + to ~ 10 after that . 
  still too expensive for the count of the canaries , i guess ... 
  might still be more efficient than waiting for the technology to build ships , then building ships just to transport your handful of levies . 
  what do you plan on conquering with those , morocco ? 
  the first shipyard likely does n't even give you enough ships to transport your own castle 's levies . 
  if you want to start as a weak island count that * is * viable , i 'd recommend the faroe islands . 
  being norse , you can get the money you need for the start by pillaging , and there 's iceland and the orkneys just waiting to be conquered . 
  after that , you can still convert to christianity if you feel being norse makes thing too easy . 
  [ i once made it from count of the faroes to fylkir in a single ruler 's lifetime . ], 
  that is so cute . 
  to clear this up ( since i very much hope he * does n't * know it ) :, 
  `` in the red '' means losing money . 
  `` in the black '' is the opposite . 
  they are a light , greenish baby-blue . 
  for men , could n't you `` simply '' use the same x chromosome twice ( and leave out the y ) , to make a female almost-clone ? 
  do n't ruin this !, 
  for all the regions that exist on the x chromosome but not on the y , there should n't be a problem with harmful recessive genes - all these genes are already expressed in me . 
  and i 'm doing fine , occasional fits of lunacy notwithstanding . 
  all the regions that exist on both x and y , i 'll of course take from my y and have them designed into a new , custom-made x chromosome . 
  my almost-clone will get my normal x and the new , tailor-made one . 
  but only one x would n't have any advantages over taking the same old x twice , would it ? 
  looking at the drastic consequences of having only one x chromosome ( [ wikipedia , turner syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turner_syndrome ) ) , that does n't seem inviting . 
  maybe you 're just giving me bad advice on purpose , because it upsets you that you ca n't make a male semi-clone of yourself for lack of a y chromosome . 
  if you want to , you can borrow mine . 
  wait for a steam sale , then buy all of them at -75 % . 
  your rule of thumb is a rule of index and middle finger ? 
  now , i do n't want to point the finger at you - hands down , it 's a handy rule - but it does sound like you 're putting your foot in your mouth . 
  [ also , social security stops running surplus , and every baby has genes mapped at birth . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/887/ ) oh , and white people in the us and britain become a minority . 
  i still think this is a very strong argument . 
  there are many fields in which the cost of labor is the only major cost . 
  in these fields , saving even just 10 % on the cost of labor would be * huge * for any company . 
  even if only * one * company were unprejudiced ( or differently prejudiced than the others ) , this one company could be extremely successful by hiring only or mostly women . 
   can all change the way someone hires, 
  yes , someone - but * everyone * ? 
  well , yeah . 
  but if these biases are different from person to person , they ca n't explain a systematic discrimination . 
  if women were systematically paid 5 % less ( even just 5 % - not to talk about 10 % or 20 % + ) than men for the same work , all companies that are n't specifically biased against women would * prefer * hiring them . 
   germany 's police force is nationalized, 
  police in germany ( translated into american terms ) is the states ' business , not a federal one . 
  to be fair , there * is * a federal police force as well , the `` bundespolizei '' . 
  they are the border police and control `` interstate '' railways . 
  also , germany 's anti-terror unit , the gsg9 ( which you might know , for instance , from counter-strike ) , is part of the bundespolizei . 
  i do n't think * flowy * is the same as * flowery * . 
  zat is not funny !, 
  why is there no data point for equal score ? 
  is that not possible at half-time ? 
  thanks . 
  i think it 's really weird that they 're not showing this point . 
  a home team that 's tied at half time will win ~ 55 % of the time . 
  that means being tied for a home team is rather like being `` zero points ahead '' than `` zero points behind '' - which is a bad thing , because being slightly behind is better than being slightly ~ ~ behind ~ ~ ahead . 
  ( i might be exaggerating . ), 
  i do n't understand that argument . 
  there is no need for them to declare a tie anything - just call it a tie , and show the damn data point . 
  no , no , i just had a minor ... mental disadvantage . 
  i messed this up , of course / u/adlaiking is correct . 
  * slams car door *, 
  that big bang background is thermal radiation , `` heat '' . 
  a geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation . 
  when you wave it at a person , what you 're picking up is n't `` cosmic '' , it 's really the radiation coming from that person . 
   you want to educate your heir yourself , unless your character is detestable , in which case you can try your luck with a grey eminence with good stats . 
  almost . 
  you want to try your luck with someone with nice traits . 
  ambitious ( great for your heir - bad for everybody else !, 
  ) , diligent , gregarious , patient , just , zealous , brave , honest - that sort of stuff . 
  and he must have the desired culture & religion , of course . 
  stats barely matter - an imbecile tutor with nice traits is better than a genius tutor without them ( or with bad ones ) . 
  then , days before your heir 's sixtheenth birthday , you find a new tutor for him , and * that one * is a grey eminence , midas touched , or whatever you prefer . 
  that 's why i say they * barely * matter . 
  i do n't even think that event is the most important way in which they matter - wards also simply get some of their points ( at their birthday , i believe ) depending on how good their tutor 's stats are . 
  but traits   stats for tutors . 
  sorry , my ~ ~ acident ~ ~ mistake . 
  it certainly is a currency . 
  what else would you call it ? 
  being a currency does n't make it a safe investment or anything . 
  the zimbabwean dollar also was a currency . 
  investing in btc instead of zwl was definitely a smart move . 
  that depends on how risk averse you are as an investor and how much you need the money right now . 
  bitcoin is * still * a very risky investment - you might make a lot of money with it , or you might lose a lot . 
  he sold 1/5 and bought an apartment . 
  that still leaves him with ~ $ 700k in bitcoin . 
  if i were him , i 'd probably sell another 2/5 or so and buy traditional stocks . 
  it 's a currency . 
  i have a little money in bitcoin . 
  for me to get that money back , i do n't need bitcoin to be hugely successful , it can stay right where it is now . 
  ponzi schemes only work as long as there are always new people throwing more money into the system .
