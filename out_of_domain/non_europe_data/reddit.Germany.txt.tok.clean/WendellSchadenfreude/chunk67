  if people stopped exchanging other currencies to bitcoin ( and vice versa ) right now , it would n't hurt bitcoin at all : it would still be very useful as a currency that inables almost-free , almost-instant global payments . 
  i think you 're confusing mt. 
  gox with the silk road . 
  the former is an exchange and does afaik not have any trouble with the us government . 
  the latter was a kind of digital black market and was brought down by the us police a few weeks ago . 
  it 's actually about ten times that . 
   [ bitcoins sent last 24h - 1,575,889.87 btc ] ( http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/ ), 
  you can use * any * currency to buy drugs and porn . 
  ( i 'd wager most drugs in the world are paid for in us$ . ), 
  and * any * currency can also buy you apartments and other goods or services . 
  any currency might lose value compared to others . 
  for the ability to buy stuff with bitcoin , it does n't even matter if 1 btc equals one dollar or one thousand . 
  it still has the advantage of being easily transferable around the globe within seconds , almost for free . 
  that 's why i hope bitcoin stays around , no matter at what $ - btc exchange rate . 
  less influential than the homosexuals , incidentally . 
  do n't tell that to timekillz , i 'm trying to make him feel embarrassed . 
  ( of course people thought it was about the nazis , because - of course !, 
  - it * was * about the nazis . 
  that 's the joke . ), 
  and * that * is my joke . 
  weird comparison ; the two are n't remotely the same . 
  flags in general are rare in germany . 
  nazi flags are illegal , and even if they were n't , virtually nobody would use them . 
  i think even the ( tiny ) rightwing extremist groups in germany mostly prefer the black-white-red [ war ensign ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:war_ensign_of_germany_1933-1935.svg ) . 
  ( that one is legal , as far as i know . 
  but still : i 've never seen it myself , only on tv . ), 
  at that point , we were certainly exporting more than we were importing . 
  oct 3rd is a holiday in germany , but not the rest of europe - so germany needed less power than normal , but could still produce just as much as usual . 
  also , on sunny , windy days , germany can produce more power than we need , while the weather barely affects how much power some countries ( like france ) can generate . 
  they have this 3-day-diagram at the end of the article . 
  compring oct 2nd and oct 3rd , you can see that oct 3rd was both a good day for the renewables and a day of low overall production . 
  ~ ~ male ~ ~ men 's . 
  i 'm against it . 
  people who are paid below minimum wage now will rarely simply get a raise . 
  their jobs will disappear instead . 
  ( not instantaneously , but over time . ), 
  minimum wage does n't really protect the weakest members of our society ( as the government always should ) , it hurts them instead . 
  sidenote : once implanted , a minimum wage will never be abolished again , and it will never be reduced either . 
  instead , in every single election , the spd will demand that it be raised a little , the linke that it be raised a lot . 
  if you doubt that this can happen at all , imagine the minimum wage being ~ 20 $ instead of 8.5 $ . 
  you do n't think any jobs would disappear * then * ? 
  of course , it will rarely be that somebody was hired to do one specific task at 8 $ / h , and instead of paying 8.5 $ / h , their boss just sends them packing . 
  but some workers can be replaced by machines , some tasks can be reorganized so that they can be fulfilled by fewer people , some services are used less often when their cost increases . 
   i do n't think imagining what happens when we set the minimum wage at 20 , 50 or 100 $ an hour contributes anything to this discussion . 
  it * absolutely * does . 
  how else could you possibly argue that the minimum wage should be 8.5 $ instead of 20 $ ? 
  or at least 12 $ - do n't you think people * deserve * at least 12 $ per hour ? 
  when i say `` machines '' , i was n't so much thinking of giant assembly line robots . 
  doormen and security guards are n't usually replaced by terminator-style fighting robots , but by simple electronic door systems . 
  but these systems cost money , too , and a company can calculate quite precisely at what cost/hour people are cheaper than electronics . 
  you make it sound as if cleaning robots were a ridiculous idea . 
  but a simple [ roomba ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roomba ) in an office might mean that the actual cleaning personnel has to come in only once per week instead of twice . 
  give it a few years , and you might not laugh anymore . 
  the more expensive `` cheap labor '' is , the more often will companies think about stuff like this . 
  or do you still think automatic checkout counters are funny ? 
   businesses do n't learn to run more efficiently all of a sudden as wages increase . 
  the point is that the reorganization of labor * is n't * more efficient at lower wages . 
  in my office , we have people who are only responsible for sending and receiving parcel . 
  every one of us * could * do that for our own packets , but it 's just more efficient this way . 
  but if we had to pay the mailroom workers more and more money , at some point it * would * become more efficient for every employee to do this themselves . 
  ( we are quite specialized ; i 'm sure the ladies in our mailroom already make more than a minimum wage would ever be . 
  but that 's not true for every company . ), 
  for almost every job that is anywhere * near * minimum wage levels , wages make up a * significant * fraction of the overall price . 
   you ca n't `` just reduce the number of employees . '', 
  yeah , that * never * happens . 
  this is n't `` forced labor '' . 
  the rules changed to make sure that * any * wage is above welfare levels - even if you only work 10 hours per week at 5 $ / h , you now have almost 200 $ per month more than someone who relies exclusively on welfare . 
  the basic idea behind that is still valid : whoever works should have more than whoever does n't work . 
  ... if you accept that a minimum wage itself is reasonable and logical . 
  actually , i * do * agree with you on that - anytime the government decides on a figure for * anything * , adjusting that figure according to inflation makes sense . 
  sadly , this is n't done with tax thresholds either . 
   exhibit 1 : look at the usa and the current state of economic affairs . 
  is that what we want in germany ? 
  you know that they have a minimum wage , right ? 
  simply pointing at america and using `` look how evil they are '' as an argument does n't work as well as usually here . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying . 
  germany currently does n't have a minimum wage . 
  this debate is n't about wether we should `` drop '' it , it 's about wether we should introduce one . 
  that was my first idea , too , so i crossposted this image to / r/shittyaskscience . 
  if you can elaborate on your theory a little , you should [ post it here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/1pmhbp/in_this_image_xpost_from_rpics_the_trees_appear/ ), 
  if that is `` zwangsarbeit '' , whatever you 're suggesting is `` stalinism '' . 
  do n't complain , you started this nonsense . 
  my own guess was that right before this picture was taken , all the trees were in the same spot - a little to the left of the camera - but then were flung away from there by some sort of explosion . 
  the trees that are the furthest from the observer only appear to be red because they are moving away from the camera so quickly that their light is red-shifted . 
  i can add another 2.4 % certainty to that . 
  warrt ok gottshuus to seggt . 
  ] ( http://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/kark_%28huus%29 ), 
  i do n't even think that part of the map is correct . 
  the baltic word more likely is from the old [ ruthenian language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruthenian_language ) . 
  i 'm not sure you 're reading the map correctly . 
  there would have been more than 16 `` bundesl\u00e4nder '' in the roosevelt plan - they are the areas with the dotted borders . 
  ( franken , kassel , westfalen , braunschweig , ... ) the five big ones would have become independent countries . 
  both . 
  there 's a dlc , but even if you do n't buy it , several new features are added to the game via patch . 
  it was similar with the old gods . 
  you need the dlc to play a norse character or use the tog start date , but some of the other stuff ( i think raiding , reformed pagans , ... ) was added for free . 
  conquer those who are weak . 
  then come back and conquer those who are strong . 
  how is that different from sober dutch ?
