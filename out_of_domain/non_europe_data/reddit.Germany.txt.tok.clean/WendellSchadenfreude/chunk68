  so what do you eat for breakfast ? 
  they do n't sell groceries ; thus they are n't included in the picture . 
  oh , thanks - that actually helps . 
  more old-fashioned people might instead just say * anything * about g\u00f6tz von berlichingen . 
  it always means `` fuck you '' , essentially . 
  you can find a lot about this even in the english wikipedia in the article about the [ swabian salute ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swabian_salute ) . 
  to really practise what you know about german , try to translate this phrase : `` wenn alle t\u00e4ten , was sie mich mal k\u00f6nnten , k\u00e4m ' ich nie zum sitzen . '', 
  sony is n't a media company either . 
  they produce hardware , not content . 
  you can mouseover the difficulty level to see what bonuses/maluses it gives . 
  i usually find it easy to go from count to emperor within two or three generations ; but i still play on normal difficulty . 
  i played a game or two on highest difficulty , and i just think it makes the game less fun . 
  biggest factor i remember is that it reduces your armies ' morale . 
  this means you will always lose when ~ equal armies meet , and somehow that bothers me a lot . 
  ( when the enemy has 2k soldiers , you always have to get 3k + - it just feels like you are an incompetent commander . ), 
  i felt like it does n't help much because it only * really * makes one part of the game harder - the very start , when you still are a count or small duke . 
  i find that part hard enough , i wish the game would stay hard once you are emperor . 
  i guess i will increase the difficulty again sometime in the future . 
  for now , i 'm happy playing difficult characters . 
  dawkins has n't done that , but [ sam harris has spent at least some thought on this ] ( http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/in-defense-of-profiling ) . 
   we should profile muslims , or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be muslim , and we should be honest about it . 
  and , again , i would n't put someone who looks like me entirely outside the bull 's - eye ( after all , what would adam gadahn look like if he cleaned himself up ? ), 
  but there are people who do not stand a chance of being jihadists , and tsa screeners can know this at a glance . 
  not in this thread . 
  mcdonalds is n't owned by one of these companies . 
  but yeah , that certainly was n't healthy . 
  yes , but his mnemonic also helps remembering which flag is for which country . 
  i understood he was doing it to sound pretentious , i just did n't get that it was supposed to be a joke . 
   the only thing that kept japan from surrender was the emperor ,, 
  this is incorrect . 
  the emperor had to * make * the military commanders surrender , there even was an attempted putsch against the emperor by officers who wanted to prevent the capitulation . 
  one thing to remember is that it would n't have been only fission bombs ( `` a bomb '' , basically the hiroshima type ) , but also fusion bombs . 
  ( hydrogen bombs , `` h bombs '' ), 
  an h-bomb uses a normal a-bomb * as the trigger * to start the actual explosion . 
  these bombs would have been used against all the major cities . 
  wikipedia has [ an illustration of how much of paris would be destroyed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:tsar_bomba_paris.png ) by one single h-bomb . 
  the red circle , the small yellow one is only the size of the fire ball . 
  ( admittedly , this is for the biggest h-bomb ever , the russian [ tsar bomba ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar_bomba ) . ), 
  one factoid that keeps resurfacing in til is that the last widow of a soldier who fought in the american civil war died in 2008 . 
  she maried him in 1934 , when she was 19 and he was 86 years old . 
  but still , you could have met her in 2005 a she could have told stories beginning with : `` my late husband , who fought in the civil war , ... '', 
  here 's the video . 
  it is also very untrue . 
  they claim a 60-90 % likelihood for a sea level rise by ** 20 meters ** until 2100 . 
  the ipcc predicts up to 0.59 m instead , in their worst scenario . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-5-1.html ) or [ here ] ( http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-6-5.html ) . 
   is the long-term radiation greater with a fusion bomb ? 
  afaik it 's smaller . 
  ( or maybe just proportionally smaller ? ), 
  if you lived somewhere on the prairie , the bombs would n't kill you in an all-out nuclear war , and the radiation likely would n't , either . 
  a nuclear winter might kill you by destroying your food supply . 
  nobody really knows how severe these secondary consequences of a nuclear total war would be . 
  i think it might have killed all humans within a few years , but certainly not all life . 
  just marry yourself , you 'll be fine . 
  everything about the early human settlement of madagascar . 
  in case you never heard about this : madagascar , the huge island east of africa , was n't originally settled by people from africa . 
  instead , the first ones to arrive were southeast asians , from borneo . 
  we do n't really know when exactly that was - it may have been as late as 500ad . 
  ( just imagine : during the high time of the roman empire , * nobody * lived or had ever lived on madagascar . ), 
  we also do n't really know how they got there - the austronesians built big outrigger canoes that * can * cross oceans , but did they really just sail into the blue and happen to land on madagascar ? 
  they also reached hawaii and the easter island , to we know they cross oceans repeatedly . 
  somehow madagascar still seems more fantastic to me , because it looks ( on a globe ) to be so close to africa and instead was settled this late from other islands thousands of miles away . 
  this is n't a mystery as in [ `` aliens '' ] ( http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/aliens-guy.jpg ) , just as in `` wow '' . 
   ok erectus is n't a person, 
  are you saying homos are n't people ? 
  shame on you !, 
  are you just guessing , or is there some form of evidence for this ? 
   actually it was malaysians, 
  given that the malaysian mainland is , of course , closer to madagascar , this is probably right - but i doubt very much that you can prove this . 
  actually , * they * killed most of the big animals of madagascar upon arrival - not the other way ` round . 
  yeah , but malaysian malays and bornese malays are basically the same people - the malaysian malays , afaik , came from borneo themselves . 
  it can of course still be possible to find out where exactly the first immigrants to madagascar came from , but you have to look really close and be somewhat lucky . 
  i was n't aware that this had actually ( successfully ) been done . 
  i just looked around for papers on this ; [ this one from 2009 ] ( http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/9/2109.full.pdf+html ) ( pdf , free ) seemed the most fitting . 
  genetic paper in which they find , as you say , that the genetic markers the analyzed are most similar between malagasy people and mainland malaysians . 
  the older ( linguistic ) data they cite in their introduction is : `` it ( the malagasy language ) belongs to the west malayo-polynesian ( wmp ) branch, 
  of the austronesian family and 90 % of its basic vocabulary has been found to be shared with maanyan , a language from the region of the barito river in southeastern borneo ( dahl 1951 ; adelaar 1995b ) . '', 
  their conclusion : `` however , the search of a pinpointed geographic ancestry could be inconclusive even for forthcoming genomewide surveys . '', 
  i find all this extremely fascinating . 
  ( btw , i have no idea what they actually did in this paper , in know little about genetics . ), 
  well , that just proves that darwin was n't all-knowing . 
  just taking this one example :, 
   his land swarmed with powerful and docile animals , yet he never dreamed a harness , cart , or sled . 
  nonsense . 
  we modern people have been unable to this day to domesticate a single african `` powerful '' animal , despite modern tools , modern methods and the certain knowledge that animal domestication is in principle possible . 
  claiming that the ancient africans should have been able to domesticate their animals if they had n't been so lazy is pure hogwash . 
  in case you 're really interested in an answer to your question , i recommend jared diamonds `` guns , germs , and steel '' . 
  short , easy read , good explanation for the fact that europeans and asians were so much more advanced than africans , americans , or australians . 
   darwin was a racist bastard underneath it all . 
  that 's not surprising . 
  not only was it very common in his time , there was also simply nothing to scientifically oppose views as you just quoted . 
  they could only see that africans were primitive , while europeans were far more advanced . 
  but the science of the time could n't explain that difference . 
  racism could - the assumption that africans are simply dumber or lazier than europeans was somewhat justifiable in darwin 's time . 
  but it 's not a good assumption anymore . 
  not because people have changed , but because we have far better explanations for the differences in technology between africa and europe . 
  the way you quoted darwins passage about the africans made it seems like you think these views are still valid today - they are not , science has proven them to be wrong . 
  ( darwin still was one of the most important scientists of all times , his racism does n't change that . ), 
  that seems very likely . 
  the best sign for this that i know of is the [ sweet potato ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweet_potato#origin.2c_distribution_and_diversity ) .
