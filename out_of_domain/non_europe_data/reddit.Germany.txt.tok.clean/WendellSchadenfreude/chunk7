  i ca n't imagine this very argument `` turning anybody atheist '' . 
  but then again , no single argument ever does . 
  pretty uncalled for . 
  but if it makes you feel better ... 
  you include medivacs as fighting units , but not warp prisms and overlords ? 
  leaving out observers and overseers , ok . 
  queens . 
  definitely a fighting unit . 
   klar . 
  ... or pretending to work . 
  relevant [ xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/928/ ) . 
  ( read the mouseover tooltip ! ), 
  there was a young man of wight, 
  who ate apples with great delight, 
  it kept the doctor away, 
  'til one unfortunate day, 
  he died from too much cyanide . 
  i was thaught that all the old laws still stand , but many of them are `` sacrifices '' in a way . 
  `` not eating bacon '' is , if you will , a sacrifice . 
  since jesus already gave the highest possible sacrifice ( his life ) , all further sacrifices are pointless and unnecessary . 
  do n't know were i learnt this , but i always found ( and still find ) it to be an interesting argument . 
  not extremely convincing , but interesting . 
  sounds best as :, 
   i managed a large , tightly knit group of kittens . 
  that was entertaining but time-consuming . 
  ( my reason : neither the kittens nor the group are time-consuming . 
  managing them is . ), 
  if you speak standard german , i think it will be easier for you in k\u00f6ln than in m\u00fcnchen . 
  ( although maybe i only think so because i 'm from near k\u00f6ln , so that dialect is easier for me . ), 
  k\u00f6lner sprechen oft `` ch '' ein wenig wie `` sch '' aus ( wie * thatwhicherodes * schon erkl\u00e4rt hat ) und das `` g '' wie ein `` j '' , besonders am wortanfang ; even when they are otherwise speaking standard german . 
  like this . 
  [ they might also change that sentence a lot more and for example say `` br\u00fcdche '' instead of `` br\u00f6tchen '' , but a k\u00f6lner trying to speak hochdeutsch might sound like this . ], 
  in case the site ca n't handle the traffic , here 's an imgur-link to the picture . 
  because he 's being dead . 
   have fun with the beer ... it 's basically bud light . 
  on topic : if you want to get a little scared , listen to some music in k\u00f6lsch . 
  like this :, 
  it even has lyrics , but i 'm sure you still wo n't understand a thing . 
  but do n't worry , they do n't really talk like that ( too often ) . 
  but there are many songs in this dialect , and many of them are quite popular . 
  my thought exactly . 
  i have no idea why this is being downvoted . 
  teaching is important , but by teaching one step at a time , you make sure your students really understand what they just learnt . 
  if you just jump to `` print 2 copies '' directly , your mother will never appreciate the power of copy/paste . 
  this link was posted somewhere in this thread . 
  two . 
  i really wonder if they expected this . 
  it seems like the results will be almost useless if you do n't have any geographic information attached to it . 
  [ `` why , some atheists experience a lot of discrimination , and some do n't . 
  also , some of them are from the us and some from china , but we ca n't tell who 's who . '' ], 
  i 'm glad he said that several times . 
  the first few times , i thought i just had n't understood him correctly . 
  now i know i just really do n't understand him ... 
   i , in fact , spent most of my time in jr high trying to refute the fact that i myself was gay , so some of the crap i spewed at the time was in self defense trying just to survive . 
  this really confused me . 
  maybe it 's only unclear to me because english is not my first language , but i have to ask : is this meant to say that you had to refute rumors about you being gay ( because you are n't ) , or that you are gay and fought the realization of that fact ? 
  oh , the first place i encountered * that * was an armstrong & miller video :, 
  ( `` random '' is at ~ 34 seconds ), 
  in the end , it comes down to learning the articles when you learn the words . 
  car - das auto, 
  try to learn new words already with the article , adding the articles later will only make it harder . 
  ( i do n't get the second half of the sentence . 
  is this supposed to be '' ... until april 9 , 12 o'clock '' ? ), 
  ( `` am strand '' is directly at the beach . 
  if it 's only close , it might be something like '' ... einem schloss in strandn\u00e4he . '' ), 
  and this is even being upvoted ? 
  sorry , frotc , but you need to read up on a few ww ii basics here . 
  germany and russia just divided poland between the two of them `` peacefully '' ( that is : not fighting each other ) . 
  france and england declared war on germany after germany had attacked poland , but russia did n't . 
  the german-russian fighting started later , when germany attacked russia - russia had still sent germany supplies earlier that very day . 
  basically correct . 
  this , at least , is half-correct . 
  hitler did n't have any ( published ) plans to `` conquer the world '' - it was `` only '' europe . 
  but russia was * the * central part of his plans for greater germany - hitler * really * wanted to attack russia . 
  it 's the only reason he actually did it . 
  here 's a nice map for you : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:greater_germanic_reich.png, 
  was it uncanny though , or was it * random * ? 
  reminds me of a set of `` ironic declinations '' i once saw that all worked somewhat like this :, 
   i could lose a few pounds . 
   you 're fat . 
   he looks like a stranded whale . 
  i thought there should be some word ending in - onym for this , but i ca n't find one . 
  the most interesting one i found is the autantonym or contronym , a concept that shows why learning languages is so difficult : it 's a word that has a certain meaning some times and the exact opposite meaning at other times . 
  wikipedia has a few examples such as fast ( moving quickly ; fixed firmly in place ) and sanction ( punishment , prohibition ; permission ) . 
  there 's a surprising number of words like this . 
  [ sorry i could n't help with the original question . 
  but i found this interesting enough to share it anyway . ), 
  or simply use `` konsole spielen '' . 
  ( even better : name the console . 
  `` playstation spielen '' or something like that . ), 
  `` konsolenspiele spielen '' is correct , but clumsy . 
  `` ballspiele spielen '' or `` computerspiele spielen '' would also be possible , but `` ball spielen '' and `` computer spielen '' sounds much better . 
  i 'm german . 
  i did n't even know what a `` stein '' is in this context . 
  til some german . 
  actually , even that was built . 
  comparing the german numbers to 1990 is never a fair comparison . 
  the entire east german industry collapsed , that accounted for a lot of the reduction . 
  oh , the goat story was great , imho , compared to * everything * that 's happened in seasons 7 and 8 . 
  ned did n't need the frey bridge at all .
