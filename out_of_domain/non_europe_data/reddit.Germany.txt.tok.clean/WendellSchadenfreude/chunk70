  i was here first , you go find your own website !, 
  also , why is your top comment of all time `` beads ? '', 
  `` outnumbered '' does n't mean whatever it is you think it means . 
  when one horse-sized man has to fight five duck-sized children , he is clearly outnumbered , but he should n't have a problem winning this fight . 
   ever since it had very bad reputation . 
  the bundeswehr does n't have a bad reputation at all . 
  on the contrary , it 's one of germany 's institutions that are most unanimously respected . 
  [ here 's an article about this in german . 
  if you ca n't read german , [ this picture contains the most important information ] ( http://img.welt.de/img/deutschland/crop121418351/6050719752-ci3x2l-w580-aoriginal-h386-l0/dwo-bundeswehr-ansehen-cw-2-.jpg ) . 
  answers to the question `` do you personally have a high or a low opinion of the bundeswehr ? 
  '' , from left to right `` high '' , `` rather high '' , `` neutral '' , `` rather low '' , `` low '' , `` i do n't know '' . 
  in that case , `` almost '' does n't mean what you think it means . 
  because germany was n't `` almost outnumbered '' . 
  in both wars , she clearly * was * outnumbered . 
  pangaea broke apart about 200 million years ago . 
  humans have been around for about 1 % of that time . 
  ( about 0.1 % if you only count anatomically modern humans . ), 
  at least some of that can be attributed to `` incumbent bonus '' . 
  the way you present the number , it works against here twice , because both obama and brown benefited from it ( presumably ) . 
  in the version of this story that i read ( some 15 years ago ) , the last part was about the reward ( fangpr\u00e4mie ) that was offered for bringing this beutelratte back , the hottentottenstottertrottelmutterattent\u00e4terlattengitterwetterkotterbeutelrattenfangpr\u00e4mie . 
  typing this word feels weirder to me than saying it ... 
  hey , that was going to be my own answer !, 
  ( just kidding . 
  i never made lemonade . ), 
  [ because of your username , this is how i imagine you ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it-vx7bsgiu ) , only hairier . 
  what 's the symbol between strong and humble ? 
   and bronn does serve ** the hand ** that pays him very well . 
  i think bronn will even be sensitive enough not to say it like that . 
   you no longer get any liege levies from vassals with a negative opinion of you, 
  i already wondered this yesterday : you do n't get * any * ? 
  surely you still get the minimum levies as per crown authority ? 
  ( e.g. 
  40 % at medium ca . ), 
  unless you get bitten . 
  it 's a pronoun . 
  do you think `` him '' is n't english 101 ? 
  [ who am i ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wcvsd4f_7fm#t=164 ) ... oh , wait , wrong number ... 
  monday 18th . 
  as someone who has always effectively played ironman mode already , me too . 
  in short , i think you 'll be ok . 
  it does , however , depend somewhat on the details : where would you be working ? 
  large clinic or your own practice , and where geographically ? 
  also , brazilians come in all skin colours - how obviously non-german are you ? 
  i 'm not sure how much it will really matter , but as a rule of thumb , i 'd say it gets easier the whiter you are . 
  most importantly , what acartesiandemon said : do you know that you 'll be allowed to work in germany ? 
  i think that 's only for how long * their * period of notice is , in case they want to fire you . 
  skin is different from fabric , so soap is different from washing powder . 
  they need different temperatures to be effective . 
  some people are a bit obsessed with bacteriae , some people just do n't like touching wet clothes . 
  i do n't think any of this is specific to germany . 
   though i have a feeling i am of a very small majority . 
  guess you meant to say * minority * . 
  i very much * hope * that these ai improvements will make the game harder and cost me `` victoy '' from time to time . 
  once you have all the mechanics figured out , the 1 . x game just became too easy . 
  you 'd only use the former in iambic poems . 
  this is not correct . 
  in both cases , hans believes that he does n't know maria ; but neither version tells us wether his belief is true . 
   in b. your 're saying hans does n't believe that he is acqainted with maria and thus ignores her . 
  this is the meaning that * both * sentences have . 
   then finally , when it comes to actual battles , i do n't know if its the fact that the difficulty is turned up , or if there 's some aspect i 'm missing , but in fights with even numbers where i have a significant martial advantage ( 3-4 per section , i 've been trying to match up generals as best as i can ) i 'm getting absolutely rolled . 
  i 'm seeing the morale of flanks collapse before even the melee phase in some cases , and it has reached the point where unless i 'm going into battles with a bare minimum of a 50 % size advantage over the enemy army , i 'm going to lose miserably . 
  and this is without taking into account terrain advantages/disadvantages , which make it so that unless my army is twice the size of the enemy i 'm boned . 
  yep , this is purely the effect of high difficulty . 
  annoyed me as well . 
  it just makes you feel like a bad general when you keep losing battles against roughly equal ( or even weaker ) armies . 
  this is why i still play on normal difficulty mostly . 
  the stuff about alliances really sounds buggy , but i 've never heard oh anything similar . 
  maybe you ( assidentally ) disabled the notification that the ai uses to call you into wars ? 
  this could at least explain the opinion hits with your * actual * allies who seemingly never called you into war . 
   it does ring a bell for me . 
  i have some fragments floating around in my head , i just ca n't place it ( and google is surprisingly bad to find the right context for the fragments . ), 
  ooh , let me try !, 
  i love trying to recognize fragments of poems !, 
  language can be used in some much more creative ways than you seem willing to accept . 
  [ here are a few examples from lingustic publications alone using similar constructions . 
  [ there 's even more about hans !, 
  it 's not exactly * common * , but it 's still perfectly acceptable . 
  rebel leaders do n't carry any cash ( unless they managed to conquer at least one holding ) . 
  that 's adventurers . 
  siege expert is siege expert . 
  organizer would also still be great . 
  i also kept one around just because he was a genius - i married him ( matrilineally ) to some relative of mine , and they did in fact have some offspring . 
  ( do n't remember if there were any geniuses among the kids . ), 
  but yeah , broken spirit usually makes them useless . 
   i 've noticed that banishing them , even if they 're of a different religion than me incurs a -10 piety hit . 
  ... it does ? 
  i do n't think it does . 
  i usually banish them ( at no penalty ) , i execute those who `` angered '' me . 
  ( by retreating too often , or by rebelling while i was preparing a tournament , or while some foreign country also attacked me . ), 
  even executing has no penalty as long as they are heathens . 
   historically they converted fairly quickly . 
  after otto the great defeated them in the battle of lechfeld . 
  this is such an important event in german history , it 's a pity that most germans have never heard of it . 
  well , use him for sieges . 
  sieges * only * . 
  he still gives you a 40 % bonus for that . 
  the journal is called `` tree '' ? 
  silly biologists ... , 
  i never thought about this before reading the selfish gene , but i found the idea immensely interesting :,
