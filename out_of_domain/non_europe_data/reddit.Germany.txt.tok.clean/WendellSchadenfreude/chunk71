  having an extra full sibling ( same father , same mother ) is , from the standpoint of your genes , basically the same thing as having a child of your own . 
  in each case , you share fifty percent of your genes . 
  ( in addition to what you share with other humans anyway , of course . ), 
  [ ah , i actually found one !,

  when that happens , it usually means you planned your war wrong . 
  ( normal procedure : first kill their big stacks , then siege them down into submission . ), 
  but even so - when enemy armies approach , just switch army leaders . 
  split your army . 
  even a small force should be enough to stop them long enough for your main army to catch up . 
  i rarely fight wars in pagan homelands ( other than maybe against counts with just 1 or 2 provinces ) until i reach military organisation iv . 
  i do n't really know anything about them , but i can at least tell you this :, 
  the viadrina is surprisingly well known for such a small-town university , and it has ( among clueless folks like me at least ) a very good reputation . 
  quite many germans would n't want to move to ffo because it 's that far in the east . 
  for many of our german fellow students , ffo would likely have been only their second choice ; but that should n't matter much for you . 
  / r/hispanicpeoplegifs it is !, 
  `` stannis !, 
  stannis ! '', 
  if they are n't , they should n't call it * real * gross earnings . 
  so , you 're calling in sick ? 
  ca n't switch to elective ? 
  there 's not really a problem , btw - he 's of your dynasty , so if he inherits , you play on as him . 
  since his kids ( once you switch out of seniority ) will inherit bohemia * and * his wife 's lands , this is probably your best course of action . 
  you can send assassins even when you ca n't plot against him , of course , it 's just expensive . 
  ( do n't forget to send you spymaster there first . ), 
  it 's not even called `` tutorial island '' anymore , it 's officially `` the island of boredom '' . 
  maybe start as the king of poland . 
  you 're independent , have some weak pagan neighbours , and there 's no * real * threat to your rule until the mongols show up . 
  if i am your boss , please talk to hr instead , as i wo n't be in myself tomorrow . 
  i 'm also somewhat under the weather . 
  must be the flu . 
  i think it 's important that none of your neighbours can actually destroy you . 
  maybe hungary , definitely the hre are strong enough to take a county or two off you if they should try - even a duchy if they feel brazen . 
  but that 's not gon na end the game for you , it just gives you all the more reason to play on and seek revenge . 
  very interesting . 
  i do n't understand how this card works , though . 
  what does it say ? 
  `` if i get captured , listen to my buddy jack '' ? 
  also , that card would likely be captured with him - does the staff ( or somebody else ) have a copy ? 
  so what does `` unique '' language mean in this context ? 
  are/were for instance all the aboriginal languages of the `` southeast '' region closely related , or does each color in this map mark a more or less isolated language ? 
  if bardi were dutch , would nyul nyul be german , english , french , russian , sanskrit - or would it still be nyul nyul ? 
  any luck on the eugenics front ? 
  or did you get married for the claims ? 
  [ come on , somebody had to make these jokes ... ], 
  also had this problem , also had a wrong checksum . 
  i deleted `` common '' , '' mod '' , and `` traits '' folders , then verified game cache integrity . 
  [ like this ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-qeuh-3335 ), 
  some ~ 1000 ( small ) files were downloaded ( ~ 5 seconds ) . 
  that fixed it . 
  there are people in this subreddit who are actually * good * at this game . 
  you 've had * one * day to play around with these mechanics !, 
  i like them so far , but it 's * far too early * to say anything of substance . 
  100k men for `` most of the roman empire '' is n't that far off . 
  ( less than 400k fought at philippi . ), 
  and you are not the roman empire . 
  charles martel had less than 20k men when he became `` the savior of europe '' by beating the umayyads at tours . 
  i understand you 've never * actually * seen them invade since the patch game out ? 
  why not wait and try to fight them off a few times ( not just once ! ), 
  before forming an opinion ... ? 
  so it was 300k , and now it 's * only * 100k ? 
  yeah , sounds horrible ... 
  [ i was so certain it was gon na be this classic picture . 
  ] ( http://www.ladyandthesweatshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/american-way-a.jpg ), 
  of course it was . 
  [ you know my agreeing with you was purely ironic . ], 
  do you have the correct checksum ? 
  ( wgpn ), 
  do you have the correct checksum ? 
  ( wgpn ), 
  loading ironman saves works fine for me . 
  start the game . 
  on the first screen , near the bottom left corner , there are four letters . 
  [ in this image , it 's `` guhh '' . 
  ] ( http://lparchive.org/crusader-kings-2/update%2001/1-1_1.png ), 
  these letters are somehow calculated from your game files - if there 's anything wrong with your files ( maybe because you changed something with an old mod , or because one of your files simply got corrupted ) , these letters will be different . 
  if they are , you just delete some or all of your game files and have steam download them again , so that you actually have the files you 're supposed to have . 
  if the problem persists , it 's actually a bug . 
  you could kill cancer by giving the patient somebody else 's white blood cells en masse . 
  they 'd kill the cancer quickly . 
  unfortunately , they 'd also kill everything else indiscriminately . 
  wgpn is correct . 
  ok , since this seems to be a problem with the character portaits : do you have any of the portait dlcs ? 
  ( `` mongol faces '' , etc. ), 
  have you tried disabling them ? 
  also , is this in old savegames , in new games , or both ? 
  well , the checksum means that your gamefiles are as they should be . 
  you can only try deleting all the mod files ( including face pack dlcs ) . 
  steam does all the work for you , deleting stuff should be safe . 
  i do n't know which number is which dlc , but you can just check how big they are . 
  i guess the actual expansions are rather large , while a facepack is probably somewhere just a few mbs big . 
  ( i guess ... ) - delete all the small stuff , try again . 
  the same crash ? 
  weird . 
  to get steam to download everything , [ have you done this ? 
  ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-qeuh-3335 ), 
  true enough - the white blood cells would start fighting it out . 
  but you only need enough donor cells to overcome that resistance , and then some . 
  sadly , it 's separated spar-kasse , not spark-ass ( e ) . 
  so what do you expect to happen after that ?
