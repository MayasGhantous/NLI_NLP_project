  would be even better if you had it say `` the netherlands '' . 
  flanders is close to france as well , but it mostly lies along the border to the netherlands . 
  of the two big regions of belgium ( flanders and wallonia ) , flanders is the `` dutch '' part , wallonia the `` french '' part . 
  ( slightly simplified ... ), 
  wow - that is really cool . 
   stories about bloody mary, 
  come on , at least write it three times , you have to get over your fear at some point . 
  here , let me show you . 
  bloody mary . 
  bloody mary . 
  since op * is * king failure himself now , the claim on the ere should still be a strong one - it 's not inherited . 
  well , i 'll just use this opportunity to thank you for the work you put into your subreddit . 
  it 's the only reason i feel somewhat well-informed about syria . 
  the accusation is nonsense , of course . 
  i also think you 're supporting the wrong side in this conflict , but you 're clearly doing so in a civil and unbiased way . 
  since girls ca n't be grand headmasters , she 's simply '' ... of teutonic order '' . 
  this somehow happened because her late grandfather , then headmaster , was granted the kingdom of hungary after a successful crusade . 
  upon his death , she inherited some of his titles , including the teutonic order . 
  have your kids learn german , send them to university for free . 
  when i hear about american college graduates with close-to-a-million in debt , i do n't understand why more people do n't do this . 
  seriously , you could move here for that money , buy a house and finish college with less debt * and * as a landowner . 
  does he say `` please '' in english , or does it just happen to sound like that in norwegian ? 
  you need a visa , and that 's basically it . 
  for starters , [ maybe read here . 
  ] ( https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/en/ ) college in germany is free , you only pay maybe 500 $ per year for administrative fees . 
  ( there 's always political plans for university fees , for foreigners or for everybody , at least in some parts of germany . 
  but do n't worry about these details too much ; even when there are fees , they are negligible compared to the us . 
  currently , there are none in most parts of germany . ), 
  it can be more complicated if you want to study e.g. 
  medicine or some other subjects . 
  but in most cases , you can enroll at any university with no trouble . 
  [ before anyone tells me : yeah , i 'm making it sound easier than it is . 
  studying abroad is * always * complicated , even studying in general always is . 
  but coming to germany as an american does n't add * too much * hassle . ], 
  feel free to pm me if you want to ask about more details . 
   only eu students get education in germany for free ... 
  i do n't know what makes you think that ; i 'm quite certain that it 's not correct . 
   [ how high are tuition fees in germany ? 
  the german public institutions of higher education normally waive tuition fees for most bachelor 's and many master 's degree programmes . 
  ] ( https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/9198-expenses-finance ), 
  of course , studying in england works just fine as well - still cheap compared to the us . 
  in that case , people are simply bitching about it too much . 
  in 957 , things are looking good for the byzantine empire . 
  almost the entire de jure empire is under control , only a small rebellion in georgia needs to be put down . 
  but then the muslims invade !, 
  first , the sunni caliph declares a jihad for the kingdom of armenia . 
  that 's bad , the caliph controls one of the world 's biggest armies !, 
  but when it rains , it pours : only a few days later , the shia declare a jihad as well - their target is the kingdom of anatolia !, 
  i 've never seen this before : two jihads on a single target . 
  against the united [ ummah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ummah ) , the greeks stand no chance , and so they lose half their empire in what is basically just one single war !, 
  with a proper leash , it causes no harm ; neither in dogs nor in humans . 
  but fast movement , stopped abruptly by a rope tied around your neck - that 's called hanging , and it works for dogs as well as for humans . 
   americans probably hae a much lower standard of living than most western euuropeans, 
  where did you get that idea ? 
  it depends , of course , a lot on how you define `` living standard '' , but i do n't know of any definition by which the us is doing much worse than western europe . 
  there are ways of defining living standard that would rank the us lower than most western european countries , but not by much . 
  these methods always include a measure for equality , which means the us not for being poorer , but for being less egalitarian . 
  the median household income in the us is still higher ( adjusted for buying power ) than that of all [ but the three richest european countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) . 
  ( and these three , luxembourg , norway , and switzerland , are all rather special and can hardly be compared to other countries . ), 
  besides the other reasons given in this thread already , there 's one more : very few people are suitable organ donors after their death . 
  kidney transplants are fairly common because the donor is alive . 
  after your death , your organs ( including kidneys donated to you by someone else ) become damaged within minutes - unless you die from brain death . 
   [ the major obstacle to organ transplantation today is the limited organ supply . 
  it is estimated that only 1 -- 4 % of the total number of people dying in hospitals and about 10 % of those dying in intensive care units ( icus ) die in the situation known as `` brain death '' ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2f978-94-011-0201-8_20 ) [ ... ], 
  since you could n't take the kidney `` back '' with the original recipient still alive , this alone would make it impossible in most cases . 
  `` usually '' . 
  as in , always , automatically . 
  we should be fine as long as nobody mentions airplanes and bombs , or countries like syria and afghanistan . 
  ireland is the island of boredom . 
  you mostly just sit around and watch while your chancellor * does n't * fabricate claims . 
  people only recommend it to newbies because they want them to suffer the same way they suffered themselves . 
   watching lets plays of games that i 'm playing seems like cheating to me, 
  i understand that for rpg/fps , but not for ck2 . 
  even if you play as the same character you saw in a lets play , your game will still be totally different . 
  getting into ck2 is difficult . 
  early on , you will rarely understand what your decisions actually * do * . 
  sticking around was worth it for me , because i love the mixture of rpg and strategy that the game offers . 
  ymmv , you have to know what you like yourself . 
  i found lets plays boring . 
  maybe read [ this aar ] ( http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?588118-saltborn-a-crovan-aar ) instead - rather simple sense of humor , but it highlights the way that this game writes stories every time you play it . 
  or just start playing , you 'll get it at some point . 
  ( just do n't start in ireland . 
  it 's boring . ), 
  came here to check that this was n't a bug in my browser . 
  i enjoyed this , too . 
  it annoyed me for a moment ( `` why is n't this working ?!, 
  '' ) , and then i realized that it 's somewhat fitting and definitely intentional . 
  i 'm afraid not . 
  technology is n't that big a part of ck2 , you ca n't really `` put a focus on technology '' . 
  ( getting high levels in military organization and legalism early on is nice , but not vital . ), 
  if you do n't * know * if your budget is more like 400 $ or 450 $ per month , it 's probably more like 600 $ . 
  600 $ / month is still a good student budget . 
  it 's a medieval game . 
  research * was * slow and incremental around 1000ad . 
  if you play as a norse character , focus all your research on military organization and heavy infantery , get a strong retinue of housecarls , build the housecarl buildings in your capital , and manage to get the heavy infantery leader trait and maybe the unyielding trait , the army you lead will often be able to defeat enemies who have twice your numbers , in favourable terrain at least . 
  or if you 're fighting pagans in their own lands , reaching mo level iv really * is * a big deal . 
  other than that - well , it 's not a game for everyone . 
  you can make a lot of money e.g. 
  from having some vasall merchant republics . 
  i still would n't say that you 're an economic powerhouse - because you 're not a country , you 're a dynasty .
