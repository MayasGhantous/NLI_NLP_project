  i think painting the map in the colour of your country is relatively easy and boring , but making sure that all your grandchildren have a good life is always challenging , no matter how good you are in this game . 
  just start playing and focus on that . 
  you gay , sex be great !, 
  still works , somehow ... 
  what `` same '' budget ? 
  i 'm not saying living on a 400 $ budget is n't possible . 
  of course it is . 
  but when you do , you 're either homeless , or you * know * your budget better than just + / - 50 $ . 
  not 400-450 $ / month , and `` maybe even less '' . 
  people who seem so proud that they 're living on a frugal budget usually do n't include any `` irregular '' expenses in that budget . 
  like clothes or travel . 
  i 'm not sure if you noticed , but this video was already included in the eaworldview article you posted , so posting it again is quite redundant . 
  the posts are both already from `` 1 hour ago '' . 
  in this case , i will tell eaworldview to stop posting redundant videos in their articles - whish me luck !, 
  i have no clue what happened . 
  if the player in the white shirt had scored immediately , without fooling the blue players first , would n't that have been much ... safer ? 
  those 20 guys in the center all feel like they are their own boss . 
  you can help a little * before * founding the republic : while the mayor is still your direct vasall , you can construct some buildings in his city . 
  give him level 1 market and port , at least . 
  would n't have helped . 
  the character did n't die , he got unlanded by losing a war . 
   this happened last week at temporal time travel tours . 
  last week ? 
  if i remember correctly , this did n't happen until next year . 
  coming home to an empty apartment can be depressing . 
  cooking for just one person sucks . 
  your roommates ' social circles will make finding friends in a new town easier . 
  it 's much easier to have great parties if you have 3-5 hosts who each have a room and only have to invite 5-10 guests each . 
  that 's just off the top of my head . 
  and i actually like living alone . 
   point, 
  point ? 
  singular ? 
  i 'm offended !, 
  if the entire country was in a state and insurgency , and the aim is to control the entire country . 
  i do n't know what petraeus meant , but i do n't think you should include the population of the coastal area . 
  and if assad decides that he can live without the euphrates valley , the people living there should n't be included either . 
  i think you 'll get the wrong numbers in that case if you only count foreign personel . 
  there were already iraqui forces fighting alongside the us , were n't there ? 
  ( not just the regular army , also the sons of iraq . ), 
  yes , they are actually closer to being relieved than they have been any time this year . 
  the recaptured villages should be out of the scope of this map . 
  in the bottom right corner , you can see tell arn - i think the villages in question should all be a little to the south/south-east from there . 
  [ here 's the same map from two weeks ago . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/by0eoasiyaiefws.jpg:large ), 
  [ and here 's the thread were we discussed that map . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/1qfrj4/proassad_syrian_perspective_updated_map_of_aleppo/ ), 
  the only real change visible in the map is the government taking control of part of the industrial complex in the north . 
  i sometimes think i 'm the most generous and forgiving ruler on this board . 
  after rebellions , i usually just release most of the rebels , some of them with gifts . 
  for most of them , that 's enough so that they wo n't ever rebel again . 
  they think you are merciful , they are happy you released them from prison , they like your gifts and they are impressed that you crushed a rebellion - that 's easily +60 opinion or more . 
  enough for you to survive until the `` short rule '' penalty has turned into a `` long rule '' bonus . 
  one or two leaders of the rebellion might have to be punished , because they hate you too much to ever be reconciled , or because they simply have grown too powerful . 
  or because they are ambitious , or foreigners who refuse to let you chose tutors for their children . 
  in that case , yeah : revoke their titles , keep them imprisoned . 
  but it just feels cruel doing that . 
   but its an non-visible man watching a video of a house getting demolished on his labtop . 
  i think the edges you can see are just because the camera is indoors , filming the demolishing through a window cutout . 
  this is how halal slaughter is practised . 
  and that 's why peta ( or at least some of their members ) criticize halal/kosher slaughter . 
  [ here 's a link to their homepage . 
  ] ( http://www.peta.org/blog/cruelty-behind-muslim-ritual-slaughter/ ), 
   i 'm going to be frank -- after a minute and a half of gaia 's latest undercover video footage from a halal slaughterhouse in belgium , i had to stop watching . 
  but while i was able to hit a pause button , the more than 250,000 cows , sheep , and goats who are slaughtered while they are still conscious must endure prolonged torment . 
  animals killed halal ( according to islamic law ) can not be stunned before their throats are cut , which means that many animals -- including the cow shown in this video -- fight and gasp for their last breath , struggling to stand while the blood drains from their necks . 
   belgium forbids slaughter without prior stunning , but the law does not apply to ritual slaughter practices , even though much of the halal meat produced in the country is distributed both to religious and nonreligious markets . 
  islamic teachings encourage kindness and compassion toward all creatures , which is why many muslims make the humane decision to go vegan . 
  visit islamicconcern.com to learn more about cruelty-free alternatives to halal meat . 
  sure , this does n't seem an important issue for them . 
  wether halal slaughter is more or less humane than regular slaughter still seems to be up to some debate . 
  ( i doubt that this debate will ever yield any results . ), 
  are there videos of discussions between hitchens and pinker ? 
  ... got to find them ... 
  seriously , this is the only sfw video i know of that should never be posted without a trigger warning . 
  while everybody else already answered correctly that we are still evolving , i 'd just like to add that this does n't mean we 're ever gon na observe any significant change in our biology . 
  if you could observe a group of humans for , say , a thousand years , that would only be about 40 generations . 
  in evolutionary terms , that 's very little . 
  since it looks like this is n't getting answered by dawkins , i can offer you the next-best thing : an answer by sam harris . 
  [ killing the buddha ] ( http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/killing-the-buddha/ ), 
   [ t ] here is much more for us to understand about how the mind can transform itself from a mere reservoir of greed , hatred , and delusion into an instrument of wisdom and compassion . 
  students of the buddha are very well placed to further our understanding on this front , but the religion of buddhism currently stands in their way . 
  a lion is a cat , technically . 
  it 's not targeted against them . 
  might have hit the muslims in spain instead , or in the kingdom of jerusalem , or on sicily . 
  if i remember correctly , this is quite exactly what the russians did in the early days of the chechnya war . 
  you 're right , it went badly for them . 
  it * is * weird , it looks intentional . 
  they seem to have cut exactly along the german-danish border , and deleted all the danish islands . 
  ( including greenland ! ), 
  the length of the bars . 
  if the bar for one latitude was that long , it would mean that 23 % of the population of the region in question live at that latitude . 
  ( it would make more sense to have 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 % shown , or something like that . 
  23 % seems somewhat arbitrary ... ), 
  i find it very brave that you did n't prelude this question with `` this might be a stupid question ... '' , 
  it 's been answered elsewhere in this thread : [ she does n't . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1rlb2w/my_twin_sister_adopted_a_cat_we_match/cdoexq1 ), 
  yeah , but the weird thing is that they * are * `` identical '' twins - but only one of them has the mutant eyes !, 
  nobody really knows , i guess there would be re-elections . 
  i 'm quite sure that this is n't gon na happen though .
