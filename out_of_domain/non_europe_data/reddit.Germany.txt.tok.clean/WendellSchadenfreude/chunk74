  the media are trying ( and will keep trying ) to make this sound like it might go either way , but i really ca n't imagine the majority of spd members stabbing their party 's leadership in the back like that . 
  all of the foreigners fighting for them seem to be . 
  i have n't heard of any volunteer from a western country who went to syria to fight assad * in the name of democracy * . 
   so , calling it ghetto is basically saying `` the way that black people talk is how poor people talk . '', 
  so , black people are poor . 
  i do n't get how calling it `` aave '' instead of `` ghetto '' makes this better instead of worse . 
  when it 's called `` ghetto '' , it 's a best/worst * implied * that `` black people are poor '' ; i 'd say that 's actually just your interpretation . 
  when you call it `` aave '' instead , you 're outright * saying * that this is `` the way black people talk '' . 
  but it 's not , it 's the way poor people talk . 
  by calling it `` aave '' , you 're * actually * stereotyping all black people as poor . 
  by calling it `` ghetto '' , i do n't think you are . 
  imagine if somebody instead switched unexpectedly to speaking high-class british english : it would be stereotyping to say that they `` talk like a white person '' . 
  saying that they `` sound like the queen '' is not implying that all white people sound like the queen , behave like royalty , or are super-rich . 
  it 's just a somewhat accurate comparison . 
  if this was a white guy saying it , would you call it aave ? 
   he hangs out up front, 
  how does he get there ? 
  do southern churches have a back door just for grooms ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding ... 
  i play similarly , or at least i used to . 
  i mostly do n't finish games because i think the game becomes too easy and somewhat boring once you are an emperor . 
  about plots : yeah , i handled them exactly the same way , but i 've changed it completely . 
  i now just look at the plot list once or twice a year to see if there are any plots that involve my most powerful vasalls ( by them or against them ) . 
  if there are n't ( or if they do n't interest me ) , i just check * and immediately un-check * the box for automatically cancelling all plots . 
  this means all current plots are cancelled ( you will get dozens of popups over the next few days ... ) , but incoming plots are n't - you can check them out again after a few more months . 
  i find this saves a lot of time and still feels like you 're not necleting your micro-managment duties too much . 
  i think you have this exactly backwards . 
  of course , we only have one sentence to work with , so we ca n't be certain . 
  but this one sentence starts with `` fuck it '' - that 's not simply aave . 
  if she had simply said `` let 's get some bagels over there '' in aave ( i 'm not even gon na try to simulate this in writing ... ) , i would agree that it 's not `` ghetto '' . 
  in the german/nazi comparison , it 's as if she had started the sentence with a yelled `` achtung ! '', 
  - that 's not just speaking like a german , it 's `` prussian parade ground german '' ( ppgg ) or , if you will , `` nazi '' . 
  you make more gold per year . 
  i make more gold per minute . 
  in his case , that 's not a problem . 
  in the beginning of the video , they talk about how he got into an accident and then developed a heart condition before buying the first lottery ticket . 
  so the double-jackpot was already karmic turnaround . 
  already wanted to downvote because i hate when people make these broing comments `` tagged you as x '' . 
  then i realized , just in time - your tag is actually clever . 
   two brothers killed exactly one year apart . 
  we have right here a nice example of how stories about weird coincidences get weirder with every re-telling . 
  you took this directly from cracked . 
  but they do n't claim it was `` exactly one year apart '' . 
  quote from the article :, 
   almost exactly one year later . 
  i 'm sure you did n't do this intentionally , but i 'm sure glad that it slipped in . 
  you can just imagine that originally , this might just have been two brothers who were both killed in car accidents , maybe both by taxis . 
  the rest may already have been made up by the newspaper . 
  ( or , of course , it may be all true in this one case . ), 
  because everything 's better when said in latin , here 's what the romans thought about this : fabula crescit eundo - the story grows as it goes . 
  ok then . 
  i 'd just like to clarify one thing about the german/nazi comparison . 
  ( i 'm not sure if you were aware of it , but i 'm actually german . ), 
  if you hear someone speaking german like a prussian drill sergeant , i find it somewhat offensive if you just describe it as `` german '' . 
  describing it as `` nazi '' instead is fine by me - i do n't talk like a drill sergeant , so this does n't imply i 'm a nazi . 
  simply characterizing it as `` german '' * does * imply that all germans talk that way . 
  i am , for example , slightly annoyed by [ this comic . 
  ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m008pztyo41qgzxfho1_500.jpg ) ( `` butterfly '' in different languages . ), 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/takbir ) had a very interesting explanation . 
   in the islamic world , instead of applause , often someone will shout `` takbir '' and the crowd will respond `` allahu akbar '' in response . 
  that 's exactly what happened in the video . 
  must have been yesterday . 
  the video was uploaded sixteen hours ago , in the middle of the night ( syria time ) . 
  the execution took place in daylight . 
  still ... this hit me hard . 
  when you see videos of atrocities , there 's usually this somewhat comforting thought `` well , that was 20/40/70 years ago '' . 
  that may or may not be so , but it 's not the point in this case . 
  i 'm glad you put `` moderate '' in double quotes . 
  we were n't discussing what percentage of the rebells are foreign extremists , we were discussing what perecentage of the foreigners fighting for the rebells are extremists . 
  from what i 've heard so far , that percentage is 100 . 
  for anyone unfamiliar with the geography of the region , [ here 's the town in google maps . 
  ] ( https://maps.google.de/maps?q=34.09162,36.759367&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x15228e49f7451b8b:0xb738e74ba093b39c,34.09162,36.759367&amp;gl=de&amp;ei=ewcxus7xnopx4at69ogwag&amp;ved=0ccoq8gewaa ), 
  it 's important because it 's on the damascus-homs-aleppo highway . 
  just like quarah ( just north ) and al nabk/nabuk to the south . 
  i do n't think the fact that other groups are * even worse * alone makes a group of religious fanatics a moderate one . 
  but even if it did , you still seem to be missing the point . 
  we are only discussing the foreign fighters who come from europe to syria to fight against assad . 
  i 'd gladly believe you that at least some of them just want democracy and human rights , but you 'd have to show me some reports about such people . 
  every single rebell who came to syria from a western country that i 've heard of so far was an extremist . 
  ... at the moment . 
  new coalition wants to change that , so if the children are maybe ~ 20 , they might never have to choose . 
  a ) i think if you 're younger than 23 years , this should be easy for you . 
  i guess you should just contact the german embassy or nearest consulate and ask them . 
  b ) apply as a german , makes * everything * easier . 
  nope , not at all . 
  it 's not the closest star to our solar system . 
  it 's the one system of all the ones we know about that * resembles our system most * *** closely *** . 
  it looks like ours , at a glance at least . 
  it 's * not * anywhere near us , `` geographically '' . 
  explanation good . 
  wendell satisfied . 
  or just play the game and accept that you 'll occasionally lose . 
  whatever is the most fun to you . 
  that does n't even sound so different from the standard `` keep ~ 5 counties , 1-2 duchies , and a lot of kingdom titles + 1 empire '' . 
  at this point , your vassals generate most of your income . 
  what comes from your demesne is nice , but not crucial . 
  as coyote_gospel said , i think this is just a faulty tooltip . 
  i think you could make it go away by giving the county of jerusalem ( or some other , newly acquired county ) to your second son . 
  gavelkind succession takes titles into account that you already handed out while alive . 
  it 's always been like this .
