  for the most part , it 's a good idea to just leave them alone . 
  it 's annoying that this can cause some civil wars , but revoking/retracting counties just makes your vasalls hate you too much . 
  if the duke of moray in your example should ever revolt , you can just revoke the duchy after crushing the revolt . 
  even if you give it back to him right after that , it will now only control its de jure counties . 
  the counties in ulster become your direct vasalls instead , and you can then transfer their vasallage to their de jure duke ( if you want to ) . 
  to a degree , you can do that by handing out titles to your sons while you are still alive . 
  also , you can of course switch to elective and be done with almost all succession trouble . 
  i just started an ironman game as the jewish khazars . 
  within five years , my character died of the great pox with no heir to the dynasty . 
  game over , shit happens . 
  i started again and was happy to reach the ripe old age of 40 this time . 
  you can prevent losing your capital that way . 
  as an old norse , you need * some * disadvantage . 
  losing most of your stuff on succession is n't nearly enough to balance out raiding , conquest cb , naval conquests , strong retinues and the ability to use rivers . 
  also , reforming the norse religion is really not that hard . 
  4 of the 5 holy sites are coastal ... 
  i 'd just like to point out that `` oort '' starts with a long `` oh '' - sound . 
  it 's dutch , so i 'm sure i 'm not making the sound correctly myself , but it 's clearly not the sound that a double-o makes in words like `` soon '' or `` moon '' . 
  more like in `` door '' . 
   i never said selling them for dollars . 
  people will hold them . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  absolutely not . 
  the point of bitcoin is being a global , useful , safe * currency * . 
  people are meant to use it that way , to pay for goods and services . 
  in the long run , btc is n't more interesting as an investment than any other currency . 
  but * as a currency * rather than an investment , it will always have advantages over $ and $ . 
  but he 's not born in germany , he 's the son of a german . 
  children of germans can always be germans , children born on us soil can always be americans . 
  this is both old and not changing . 
  a child of a german born in the us can easily have double citizenship . 
  what 's new is that this child might not have to choose one citizenship at 23 . 
  ( although i think children of germans really never were forced to choose , even if they also had another citizenship . 
  so you 're right , i 'm somewhat thinking in the wrong direction . ), 
  only thing i can imagine is that you make it sound too easy . 
  although you 're probably right , for a child of a german father this * should * be easy . 
  also , if you went through this yourself , you 're the expert in this thread . 
  so , never mind the downvotes ... 
  ( i think you might be making things more complicated than they need to be by applying for the citizenship only after coming to germany . 
  he could just become a german while still in the us , and then move here . 
  although it 's hard to tell which way would be less paperwork . ), 
  i very much doubt that this is or ever was the case . 
  children of germans are germans , that 's the basic idea of the german citizenship law . 
  ask wiki :, 
  unless his father was born after the year 2000 ( * and * not in germany ) , he 's german . 
  as a child born in the us , getting us citizenship is easy . 
  as a child born to german parents , getting german citizenship is easy . 
  the only problem is that atm you 're not allowed to keep both ctzshps after age 23 . 
  from reading this text alone , i can tell that your children will go to the gymnasium without even feeling any pressure in the grundschule . 
  this system may be unfair to the children of parents who lack any higher education themselves . 
  but you 're interested in your children 's education and able to write a coherent text - that virtually guarantees that your children will go to the gymnasium . 
  [ please do n't downvote me just because you think this is unfair , but only if you think it 's not true . ], 
  oh , please ... 
   [ being born to a parent with a university degree is more likely to guarantee a child top grades at school in england than in the us , australia and germany , a study has revealed . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/apr/26/university-school-grades-child-background ), 
   [ . . ] a study of 16,000 14-year-olds , commissioned by the educational charity the sutton trust , found that in england , 56 % of teenagers whose parents had degrees scored high enough grades to perform in the top quarter of their peer group . 
  this was the case for just 9 % of teenagers whose parents had left school without qualifications . 
  the gap of 47 percentage points is more than twice australia 's ( 23 percentage points ) , and higher than germany 's and the us 's ( 37 and 43 percentage points respectively ) . 
  according to this article , the parents ' degrees matter * less * in germany than they do in the us or england . 
  your parents education * is * a strong determining factor for your own academic success everywhere .

  great !, 
  thumps up to whoever organized that !, 
  ( it was you , was n't it ? ), 
  i can understand why they might feel that way . 
  but taking this claim serious still sounds silly to me . 
  assad did n't * order * sunni fanatics from all over the world to come to syria to fight against him ( and against almost everybody else ) . 
  he just knew they would come , and they did . 
  you might also just be the only guy in the room not clever enough to pretend he does n't know anything about these things that i ` ver never heard of before . 
  what is buik-ache ? 
  ok , so since i have an expert here and have only ever seen `` aave '' in writing , never heard anyone actually say it :, 
  should i pronounce it a-a-v-e ( every single letter ) , or something like the `` ave '' in `` ave maria '' ? 
  probably never . 
  there 's not much of a market , since the cards are available for free online . 
  did you see the girl at 1:14 ? 
  she caught one vase , and when he throws another one at her , she just slows it down with her foot so it does n't break either ... 
  there were lots of different factions in iraq . 
  assad certainly was on good terms with the old baathists - members of saddam hussein 's and assad 's party . 
  any support from assad for al quaeda in iraq may just have been a by-product of his support for the baathists - much like the west now wants to support the `` fsa '' in syria and ends up at least partly supporting al quaeda . 
  i still think you 're ( or : the washington post is ) painting a wrong picture by claiming that assad deliberately supprted al quaeda against the iaqi government . 
  he certainly supported * some * groups in iraq . 
  but i find it very hard to believe that he would have chosen the most extremist sunni groups possible . 
  the assad family must have feared nothing more in the past 50 years than a sunni uprising in their own country . 
  [ fwiw , here 's a 2009 article that accuses assad of sheltering iraqi baathists . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-saddam-revisited-as-iraq-accuses-syria-of-sheltering-baathist-bombers-1785453.html ), 
  only if they inherit . 
  the sources associating it with agriculture probably use it as a technical term . 
  not as a verb , but as a noun that means something like `` sprout '' - i 'm guessing here , because i 've never heard it used that way . 
  i hope you are aware that the german you are reading is very oldfashioned and complicated . 
  modern native speakers will have to concentrate to understand the passage you posted . 
  ( and even then , i guess most actually wo n't really understand it . ), 
  oh , wow ... `` aufwuchs '' is also used in english . 
   aufwuchs ( german `` surface growth '' or `` overgrowth '' ) is the collection of small animals and plants that adhere to open surfaces in aquatic environments , such as parts of rooted plants .
