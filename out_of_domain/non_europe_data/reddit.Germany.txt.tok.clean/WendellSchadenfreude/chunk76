  in both marine and freshwater environments , algae -- particularly green algae and diatoms -- make up the dominant component of aufwuchs communities . 
  that 's the technical term i meant . 
  but it 's not the meaning it has in your example ( i 'm quite sure it did n't have that meaning at all in nietzsche 's time ) , i just thought this was interesting . 
  `` aufwachsen '' is biological . 
  other kinds of growth are simply `` wachsen '' , without the `` auf - '' . 
  it 's not used transitively - you ca n't say ~ ~ sie w\u00e4chst ihre firma . ~ ~, 
  you can also simply use `` wachsen '' for children - in that case , you 're probably only talking about their physical growth . 
  none . 
  do n't listen to people telling you otherwise . 
  the game has changed so much since most of us played the vanilla version ( if ever ) that we ca n't even know what we 're talking about . 
  play a few games , find out if you like it . 
  if you do n't like the base game , the dlcs wont change that . 
  if you like it , buy dlcs in a sale ( -75 % ) at some point . 
  i 'd miss legacy of rome the most , for retinues . 
  some people here seem to think it 's outrageous to suggest that a new player should n't spend any money on dlc before testing if they actually * like * the game ... 
   he bought the game . 
  that means he is interested in the game enough to invest a little time and money in buying additional content . 
  it means that he * already * spend some money on the game . 
  there 's no reason for spending any more money before he has at least tested vanilla for a while . 
  [ this is n't true for every game , btw . 
  if you ever want to try civ iv , buy it * with * * beyond the sword * - the game just does n't feel like a complete game otherwise . 
  but ck2 does , even without any dlc . ], 
  if you announce a challenge for nantes , you have to link to [ this guy ] ( http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?734972-how-to-conquer-the-world-in-25-years . ) . 
  starting as nantes , he conquered * the entire map * within 25 years . 
  [ i should copy his warning : gaminess level = maximum . 
  if you 're the type that avoids in-game exploits and cheesy tactics , this is definitely not for you . 
  - also , this was before soa and the latest patch . ], 
  do you lose anything by going to frankfurt * and * applying somewhere else ? 
  personally , i have much less respct for fhs than for universities , but i think i 'm a minority - most people in germany do n't see a big difference . 
  not sure how employers think about that - i think wages are usually higher for university graduates , but i 'm not sure if there 's really a * big * difference . 
  also , architecture is less of an academic science and more a professional training , which by my guess means that fhs are n't really worse at it than unis . 
  if you just look at the google maps of bochum and osnabr\u00fcck , you can kinda see what to expect . 
  bochum is surrounded by cities in all directions . 
  ( there are still green areas in between , but there 's people everywhere . ), 
  osnabr\u00fcck is right in the middle of nowhere , with flat green land all around . 
  to me , that means that osnabr\u00fcck is clearly more beautiful , but that really only depends on what you 're looking for . 
  osnabr\u00fcck has some small-village charme , with a real oldtown with churches and stuff . 
  bochum offers the advantages that come with lots and lots of people . 
  also , better football . 
  schibboleth ? 
  i still think they were justified in doing so . 
  you know , the americans for a long time had only known the coastal region of china . 
  most of the chinese population lives near the coast , but america did n't know that . 
  when the americans started their space program and first saw china from above , they became worried by the sheer size of the country - they thought it was all as densely populated as the coast . 
  this sudden fear of china - the yellow terror - is captured in neil armstrong 's famous quote : `` that is one big country full of small people ! '', 
  in an attempt to contain the chinese and cut them off from world trade , the americans then tried to build a wall * around the entire country * !, 
  if that 's not provocation for war , i do n't know what is . 
  i 'm not sure that 's true . 
  it says on the new one that it is `` constructed from statistical data '' . 
  that could well mean that most of the planets shown have n't really been `` discovered '' , they are just assumed to be there . 
  that still means they probably * really are there * , but there has n't necessarily been that much progress in finding them . 
  if you can tell the difference between planets orbiting sun-like stars and other planets , you 're not missing anything . 
  if you ca n't see that difference ... well , about 2/3 of the planets are around `` other '' stars , independent of planet size . 
  neither napoleon nor hitler `` invaded in winter '' . 
  hitler 's `` operation barbarossa '' started on june 22 , napoleon 's invasion began on june 24 . 
  as you can see on the graphic , napoleon at least ca n't even claim that he `` was beaten by general winter '' . 
  his campaign was a lost cause by the time he arrived in moskow , with temperatures at around 0 \u00b0 c ( 32 \u00b0 f ) . 
  even if you 're from corsica , that 's not shockingly cold . 
  ( although i assume that these are day-time temperatures in the graph , while corsica only ever gets that cold in some winter nights . 
  anyhow : 0 \u00b0 c is n't * that * cold . ), 
  of course . 
  but if you do n't properly dress , feed , and equip your army , you lose wars because of poor logistics , not because of adverse conditions . 
  that 's not `` except '' , that 's my point . 
  this sounds like an awesome game . 
  please play on until you either lost entirely , or have recovered your empire !, 
  also , you write really well . 
  even if he just * surrenders * , i bet this is not a `` karelian claim for the empire of britannia ( and all of op 's holdings ) '' war . 
  from the looks , it 's an offensive holy war , so op wo n't lose * anything * except a little money . 
  while it 's annoying , i think it 's actually pretty realistic . 
  pre-patch , vencie for instance was far too easy to conquer . 
  is he your vasall now ? 
  ( he is if you are an emperor . ), 
  if so , you already get some nice taxes from rome . 
  the most powerful weapon the pope can grant you are n't even the crusades anymore - it 's claims . 
  just go to the title page of any christian duchy that looks interesting , and next to the `` usurp '' button , there should now be a `` claim '' button . 
  the pope will think about it for a few days , but now that he loves you , he will grant you a few claims . 
  in my last christian game , i got the pope to grant me claims on five duchies in italy . 
  you can then press all these claims simultaneously . 
  if `` nabrk '' is supposed to be nabuk or al-nabk - that is n't even anywhere near aleppo . 
  it 's in the qalamoun region , where there 's also a government offensive , separate from the one in aleppo . 
   kurds enjoying victories in the northeast, 
  but these kurdish victories were n't against the saa , they were in battles against al-nusra/isis , right ? 
  i would actually count these as being good for the regime . 
  what was the inheritance law ? 
  in that case , you should n't surrender . 
   ( although you 'd still only lose the empire and your capital , not the game . ), 
  also in that case , i do n't think it 's unrealistic for your opponents to get a lot of support . 
  thousands of soldiers just materializing out of thin air in the middle of lappland is n't realistic , but thousands of soldiers supporting the other claimant and flocking to his banners from all over your empire is n't . 
  making them all show up at the same time is a convenient way to simulate this ( and actually makes things easier for you thanks to attrition ) . 
   it also seems to affect attack damage because 0 morale armies do 0 damage . 
  units at < 25 morale start retreating . 
  from that point on , they do n't do any damage anymore . 
   so by the time it hits nola , i 'm pretty sure a high percentage has passed through a human bladder . 
  not even 1 % . 
  not even closely . 
  the mississippi has an average discharge ( according to wiki ) of about 17 million liters of water per second . 
  i ca n't find how many people actually rely on the m. for their drinking water - only that it were [ 15 million in 2000 ] ( http://www.nps.gov/miss/riverfacts.htm ) in the upper half of the basin , anywhere up from cairo , il , the confluence with the ohio . 
  if we just add the entire population of the states of mississippi , arkansas , and louisiana , that 's roughly another 10 million , for a total of 25 million people . 
  these 25 million people would have to drink 0.68 liters * per second * each to drink all the mississippi water , that 's almost 60,000 liters per day . 
  if they drink a generous 6 liters per day instead , that 's only about 0.01 % .
