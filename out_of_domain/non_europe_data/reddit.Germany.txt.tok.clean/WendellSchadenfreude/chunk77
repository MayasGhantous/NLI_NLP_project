  oh , one more thing . 
  i 'm sure this situation is over already , but for the next time something like this happens , remember :, 
  this is somebody 's * personal * claim on your empire . 
  if the claimant should happen to die from an acute case of dagger-in-the-bowels , the war would be over instantly . 
  do you also use zacharias instead of zeppelin ? 
  like arabic . 
  i think most germans do n't like the sound of either language very much . 
  yiddish , on the other hand , sounds adorable . 
  argh , this needs to be at the top ... why did seven people vote in that straw poll , but not upvote this comment ? 
  interesting . 
  and they even have some time left to ~ ~ conquer ~ ~ liberate all of persia before the hordes show up . 
  i would n't give too much about the details of that article . 
  it 's from 2012 . 
  [ i do n't actually know * how * technology changed , but i 'm quite sure it did . ], 
  or he plays as king of blob , you are his vassal . 
  this will probably make him enjoy the game more . 
  or you could just both play sons of lodbrok and invade england together . 
  does n't matter , you can just play . 
  easy way out is to reform the faith and switch out of gavelkind . 
  this even feels like something your character might do because he 's also sick of bloody succession wars . 
  just conquer the holy sites in denmark , norway , and holland , that should be enough . 
  oh , also : do n't believe that it 's normal to have your character survive dozens of battles , smallpox , and pneumonia . 
  you will sometimes die for no apparent reason at age 20 . 
  i love this game . 
  this must be a separate incident - it 's from daraa , the reuters report is from al-nabk . 
  [ daraa is in the south , on the jordanian border , al-nabk is north of damascus , in the qualamun region . ], 
  edit : i do n't speak arabic , but i think the speaker in the `` video of gas '' also mentions al-nabk . 
  * and * second best gold edit ever . 
  that 's called the `` status quo ante '' . 
  thank you . 
  being instinctively disgusted by this suggestion makes me feel so cultured . 
  not broken at all . 
  you sometimes need to adapt a little , but the game works just fine . 
  i played as faroe islands once . 
  the start is * really * slow , because you need to build the shipyard buildings before you can even leave your island . 
  once you can pillage and the money starts rolling in , things get a lot better . 
  you do n't have any barony level vasalls , right ? 
  if you had , you could only raise their troops and send them pillaging . 
  otherwise ... well , i 've never played * subjugated * faroe islands . 
  this might be really close to `` game over '' . 
  you might have to wait until your income ( ~ 0.2 per month ? ), 
  allows you to build either a shipyard , or a second castle . 
  or maybe you can marry a baroness somewhere and have your son inherit her land ... 
  for reference : there are more than 100,000 women in prison in the us . 
  dein sarkasmus is eher unangebracht . 
  this is a horrible post . 
  i have no idea what you did , what the ai did , what i 'm supposed to be seeing . 
  it 's even more than 100x that of syria , which is more relevant here . 
  but the female incarceration rate could be the same order of magnitude - if it 's twice as high in syria as in the us , assad would already have a thousand women in prison - * without * fighting a civil war . 
  if you think the rebels would n't do stuff that 's bad for pr in the west , why are there rebels publicly declaring their allegiance to al-quaeda ? 
  why are they beheading people on camera ?

  i think if you completely unland him , you can become the new fylkyr . 
  never tried this , though , si i do n't know about the details . 
  even better : also replace `` thou '' with `` you '' . 
  that 's not the fallacy fallacy , [ this is . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_from_fallacy ), 
  there should also be a rule about not using the word `` fallacy '' to often . 
  or we could simply not do that even though there is no rule .

   when i meet people from other regions in germany and they find out about my origin , they thend to make a point about it . 
  i do that with * everyone * , no matter where they are from . 
  nah , that 's just a joke . 
  mostly . 
  many people really do n't like [ bayern m\u00fcnchen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8qpd3cfeck ) , the [ football team ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oswyyoosdpu ) * . 
  the simple reason for that of course is that they are the strongest club in germany by far and have been for most of the past ~ 30 years . 
  other than that , many germans might find it somewhat annoying that the first thing people everywhere in the world think when they hear `` germany '' is `` oktoberfest '' . 
  * in case you do n't understand these songs : the first one is basically a vow , `` i would die before i 'd play for bayern '' . 
  the second one is even simpler : `` ha-ha , bayern lost ! '', 
  you have to be higher in rank than the title he is getting . 
  if you 're a king , you can do this with dukes . 
  to do it with kings , you need to be an emperor . 
  also , if one of your barons/counts/dukes * inherits * a kingdom outside of your empire , they will take their land with them ( if crown authority permits this ) .

  i just wanted to add an answer to a related question : do bavarians want to be independent ? 
  it 's a suggestion you hear in jest sometimes . 
  in reality , there is a political party that pursues this goal , and they are tiny . 
  they are still celebrating that they got their best result in a long time in 2013 , 2.1 % in bavaria . 
  and i 'm quite sure that even most of those voters do n't * actually * want an independent bavaria . 
  so , nope : bavarians * are * germans , they do n't want to be independent , and other germans do n't hate them . 
  when you say hockey , do you only mean `` real '' hockey ( fieldhockey ) , or does it include stuff like floorball and icehockey ? 
  [ here 's the speech . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fmnfvkey4c ), 
  this might actually be an unpopular opinion . 
  i found the video by searching for `` greatest speech ever '' . 
  to be honest , i 'm not sure what * exactly * the game does for high ca inheritances . 
  i 'm quite certain that in your example , the game will either find another heir who remains a vassal to the king of germany , or the duchy of holstein will go directly to the king of germany . 
  ( i think the latter case is more common , might even be the only one . ), 
  [ well , well , well - what do we have here ?
