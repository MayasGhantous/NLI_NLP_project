  do n't worry , it 's not your fault . 
  reddit is n't quite sure about this . 
  the puffin is mostly used for ( and i believe : was even intended for ) opinions that are n't * really * unpopular . 
   only s\u00f6ldner in their squad . 
  no ` eigengew\u00e4chs ' in there . 
  philipp lahm came to bayern at age 12 , bastian schweinsteiger at 14 , holger badstuber at 13 , thomas m\u00fcller at 11 . 
  we might be more generous and also include toni kroos and david alaba , but i do n't think we have to . 
  was n't it the sewer system of lannisport ? 
  stuff like what ? 
  if your heir is also your wife 's heir , this is an unusally good marriage . 
  apart from that , i do n't know what i 'm looking at . 
  edit : since this is n't your first wife , he probably is n't . 
  too bad . 
   it 's a pretty funny coincidence this all came together . 
  that looks more like it was deliberately added , not like a coincidence . 
  i just checked - he is always there ( in the stamford bridge start ) , not randomly generated . 
  the charcters with highest diplo , martial , etc. 
  seem to be random , so this one is the only easter egg . 
  or i just did n't get the others ... 
  this article is badly missing some * numbers * . 
  it only really tells us about eight guys going to turkey . 
  how many rebels are abandoning the front lines ? 
  how many are accepting the amnesty ? 
  of those , are any simply switching sides and now fighting for the regime ? 
  ( if so , how many ? ), 
  if they get * really * lucky , they find something like the [ rosetta stone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosetta_stone ) : a document ( of sorts ) containing the same text in two ( or more ) languages , one of which is already known . 
  `` usually '' ? 
  this happened once , because they added the new trait ( s ) in the middle of the list . 
  if they simply added the new trait at the end of all old traits , this should n't be a problem . 
   the only region that the rebels are having success at the moment is deir ez zor ( big woop ), 
  i thought that had been in rebel hands for months/years already ? 
  the only area with recent rebel success imo is daraa in the far south . 
  ( sfw , not actual porn ), 
  hint : you do n't know what 's going on in the world . 
  compared to a person who reads a newspaper - any newspaper ( ! ), 
  - even just twice a week , you have no idea what 's happening . 
   most of the time i will just upgrade my county, 
  there 's your mistake . 
  stop doing that , and you 'll have all the money you need . 
  i 'm not even joking . 
  you can start upgrading your county when your income is at least 20 per month and you do n't know what to do with it . 
  until then , * mercenaries * are better than castle towns or churches . 
  just be nice to your vassals . 
  it 's been centuries since my last civil war . 
  when a new ruler takes over , * immediately * pause the game and check your vassal list , sort by opinion . 
  do the people who dislike you most have a specific reason ? 
  `` wants control of the county of boring '' ? 
  - give it to him !, 
  ( grant the county to some schmock of your culture and religion , then transfer vassalage . ), 
  send some gifts , send your chancellor to improve relations , hand out some honorary titles . 
  create a new duchy or two and hand them out to have new , extremely loyal dukes . 
  of course , make sure you do n't keep more than two duchies yourself - hand out all the rest !, 
  also , all counties in excess of your demesne limit . 
  these measures are so simple and logical , and yet they are usually enough to make factions go away or make them small enough that they ca n't hurt you . 
  not that it 's important , but this image is at least two weeks old . 
  no , this picture was taken pre-if . 
  that outfit suits him really well . 
  this is my favorite reddit pun in a * long * time . 
  also , they can show support for their kids . 
  added benefit : they can tell their kids that they are proud of them * during the event * without interupting . 
  you think so ? 
  [ have a look at this sequence of the video ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zqeygyqon8g#t=188 ), 
  you 're not an idiot , you 're just at home right here in this sub . 
  `` who are they ? 
  the dustins ? 
  the glovers ? 
  some family from bear island ? 
  the husband has a bit of a volantene look ... dammit , who are they ? '', 
   they lasted for more than 1 thousands years, 
  i 'm honestly curious as to how you measure this . 
  counting from osman i. to atat\u00fcrk , i would generously talk about almost 700 years , but not 1,000 . 
  ok , now do n't cheat and tell me what you know about astyanax , eumaeus and tithonus !, 
  nice . 
  thank you very much !, 
   one of only a handful of characters ( menelaus is another ) to be addressed in the second person by homer 's narrative voice . 
  i do n't want to ask , but i somehow hope you want to talk more about this ... do we have any idea about why this is ? 
  good place to start is [ his ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1d42co/ ) . 
  more seats in this case does n't mean more choices . 
  the number of choices is not limited by the number of seats available , but by the number of parties that have any chance of winning at least one of these seats . 
  i 'm not even sure if you 're serious . 
  * in theory * , the idea ( as you present it ) is n't all bad . 
  but this is n't what people mean when they talk about gerrymandering ( gm ) . 
  gm is n't done to get homogeneous districts , but to make sure your own party wins as many disctricts as possible . 
  only a few homogeneous districts are created : the ones where the opposing party has a large majority * already * - you turn that 60 % - majority into a 90 % - majority if it allows your own party to win one or two of the previously contested districts . 
  let me take your own two imaginary districts to show you how this works : the blacks , mexicans , and asians all vote for my party , the whites for yours - since one district is all-white and the other 25 % white , our parties will win one district each . 
  this outcome represents the districts reasonably well : your party had a popular majority , but not a huge one . 
  but now i get to gerrymander , and `` to make sure that majorities can get better representation '' ( official version ) , i create a new disctrict , district c. district c is created by joining 30 % of the white clones from district a with all the mexicans and half the asians from district b. 
  new result : your party still gets a majority of the popular vote , of course , but you only win district a ( with 100 % of the vote ) . 
  my party wins district b ( the blacks and the remaining asians still outnumber the whites ) and c ( where the mexicans and asians outnumber the whites ) . 
  you just lost the election . 
  are there any pictures of the snow-covered pyramids ? 
  i just googled for it , but i do n't think any of the pics are legitimate . 
  [ except this one , maybe ] ( http://www.nemo.nu/ibisportal/0egyptintro/snow.jpg ) . 
  so they are freed and then what ? 
  the prison is under siege , they have nowhere to go . 
  [ map ] ( http://www.syrianperspective.com/2013/11/new-map-of-aleppo-army-advances-to.html ), 
  are they recruited into saa militias ? 
  or do the rebels simply let them pass through the siege lines ? 
  that 's possible for greek culture , not for orthodox religion .
