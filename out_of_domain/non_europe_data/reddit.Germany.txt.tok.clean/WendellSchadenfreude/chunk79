  so the easiest would be playing a catholic greek . 
  oh yes , please . 
  the way it is now , seniority completely ruins the game when you have a large dynasty . 
  your heir is always some 80 year old you 've never seen before , possibly from a foreign country . 
  and because you always die within less than ten years , you can * never * get out of seniority again . 
  ( it 's still strong enough gameplay-wise . 
  it just ruins the fun . ), 
  you can do that to some degree , but you have to do it while you 're still alive . 
  the more titles you give to your younger children , the fewer will they inherit upon your death . 
  hand out enough while alive , and they inherit nothing . 
   like louis iv said , `` i am the state . '', 
  king louis xiv . 
  lived around 1700 , hundreds of years after ck2 . 
  he was vastly more powerful ( within his own realm ) than any eropean king was around 1100 . 
  `` security force '' - are they combatants or ( civil ) police ? 
  will they be used to support ssa/ndf ? 
  what about the regular police ? 
  it makes rebellions much rarer . 
  if you have dukes but control their ( de jure ) counts directly , the dukes * hate * you for it . 
  if you give them all their de jure lands , most of the dukes won * t rebell anymore , and the ones who do will find less support . 
  if you have powerful vassals , make them happy . 
  the `` prohibition '' they talk about is that of the npd , an extreme right-wing party that might be banned soon . 
  so they are saying that they do n't care wether the party will be banned , because they will stop them either way ( i.e. 
  stop any demonstration or rally ) . 
  in english maybe : `` we do n't need you to ban them , we can handle them on our own . '', 
  i do n't like any of the suggestions made here for the second sentence ; they do n't sound like german . 
  i do n't think you should focus on the `` german '' part too much . 
  if you wanted to get a present for one of your friends , what would you get them ? 
  if anything , you should get him something that is typical for your country/region , not something that is `` a typical present for germans '' . 
  ( the best thing your family could get him might be a course for a driver 's license . 
  if that 's possible in your country and his parents think it 's ok , that is . 
  might be a bit too expensive for a christmas presents though . ), 
   but i 'll never bother to play a game where west francia holds frances, 
  west francia becomes france when it 's ruled by a non-karling king . 
  ( pure guess : the converter probably turns it into france , no matter if the karlings are still in power . ), 
   started as the khazars , and now i am doing really well . 
  what a surprise ... 
  almost all culture/religion requirements for titles were waived when soa came out . 
  go ahead , create your empire . 
  it wo n't be the `` jewish empire '' by name , but you can form tartaria , ruthenia , carpathia or something . 
  the marriage thing is well known . 
  since soa , the ai always suggests a matri-marriage if that is what was agreed upon earlier , but they still wo n't let you suggest it . 
  just have to wait for them ... annoying , but much better than it used to be . 
  i had not noticed before , but now that you list the towns again ... did you realize that there is basically no difference between the towns captured in november and the ones mentioned now ? 
  this week :, 
   rebels appear to have fought in the direction of deir salmon ** [ 1 ] ** , qasimayah ** [ 2 ] ** , qaysa ** [ 3 ] ** and abbaden towards otaybah . 
  november :, 
   the saa retreated from al qasimia ** [ 2 ] ** , al biharia , al qisa ** [ 3 ] ** and der salman ** [ 1 ] ** . 
  otaybah and the damascus airport were controlled by the government the entire time and still are . 
  the rebels are basically still where they were a month ago . 
  props where props are due - that is , not for you , in this case . 
  only the first quote was taken from you , from this thread . 
  the second one was directly from the pro-government militia ( and translated by madlool ) - you did n't have much working-out to do . 
   rebels are now almost solely concentrated within western damascus . 
  * eastern * damascus . 
  what 's with people confusing east and west in this thread ? 
  you sound like a cute couple . 
  he pretends he does n't want to see a movie , you pretend to believe him . 
  then you bribe him just so that you do n't have to tell him that you saw right through his act . 
  that 's what happened , right ? 
  i should have included `` where '' ... 
  `` schlagzeug '' means drum kit . 
  this improved my mental image of the scene a lot . 
  i wonder if there is a sum at all that would make this work . 
  $ 5 to an indonesian cop might be something like $ 100 to one in london . 
  but by letting you go , they 'd also be risking a lot more . 
  do you have any idea how much the ticket would have been , roughly ? 
  why ? 
  the karling doomstacks mostly are n't event troops , are they ? 
  every 10-20 years ? 
  i thought expelling the jewry was permanent - no more borrowing until the end of the game . 
  because it was basically this way already ? 
  the ilkhanate is n't your real problem , the golden horde is . 
  you will lose half your land to the mongols , at least . 
  that 's what 's supposed to happen . 
  but with an empire the size of yours , you 're likely to survive . 
  enjoy the fight , accept some defeats . 
  maybe build a nice new capital in st. petersburg . 
  well , all three karling kingdoms together * should * easily be able to defeat scandinavia . 
  think about it : france + germany + benelux vs denmark + norway + sweden ? 
  no contest , at no point in history . 
  i still do n't know what `` event troops '' that are supposed to be . 
  maybe they were just retinues . 
  well , that 's an advantage they have , but i 'm quite certain they were n't * designed * with that purpose in mind . 
  `` flachsp\u00fcler '' are the old version of german toilets , most of them were installed ( i 'm gueessing here ) between 1900 and 1950 . 
  i do n't think stool samples were already an important factor in that period . 
  at least not important enough to dictate the design of common people 's bathroom . 
  is `` brown coat '' a nickname for spies or something ? 
  i only now it as * firefly * fans . 
  it 's the freudian `` ego '' in english . 
  they are the same thing , exccept that with `` entschuldigen sie '' , you make it clear that you 're addressing the other person by the polite `` sie '' ( instead of `` du '' ) . 
  english comparison : `` excuse me , ... '' vs `` excuse me , sir , ... '', 
  i do n't think you have the right town there . 
  [ i think it 's this one . 
  ] ( https://maps.google.de/maps?q=kan%c3%a2y%c3%a9,+al+qnayyah,+as-sanamayn,+daraa+governorate,+syrien&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sll=51.507884,7.470263&amp;sspn=0.358565,0.617294&amp;geocode=fy229wedokeoag&amp;hnear=kan%c3%a2y%c3%a9,+al+qnayyah,+syrien&amp;t=m&amp;z=15 ), 
  about half-way between damascus and daraa , much more important strategically . 
  not sure if you all noticed : the german version of this article was already posted in this sub two days ago , see [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/1t1htj/islam_or_death_islamists_take_2000_christians/ ) . 
  that article did n't mention any original source , but i 'm quite certain it was just a translation of the fides article . 
   in the battle of towton , for instance ( 1400s ) , the duke of somerset fielded 36k . 
  a duke .
