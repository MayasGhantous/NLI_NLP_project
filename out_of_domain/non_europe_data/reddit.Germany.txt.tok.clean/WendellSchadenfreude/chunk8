  robb only needed it because the lannisters were already blocking the kingsroad , and he did n't want to engage them directly , but instead wanted to surprise them by marching ( with his cavalry only ) towards riverrun . 
  to answer the `` paying attention part '' : you could easily have noticed this in one of the later cersei chapters . 
  she thinks about what a nice and stupid girl sansa was , coming to her and telling her about ned 's plans . 
  shortest good comment i have seen on reddit so far . 
  had he not crossed at the twins , robb would have lost the war that instant . 
  i thought it was pretty clear from the books - had he not gotten the frey allegiance , what should he have done ? 
  march south on the eastern shore , with ~ 4000 frey soldiers at his back and tywin in front of him ? 
  crossing at all costs was the only way he was able to * capture jaime * . 
  oh , and defeat jaime 's army twice ( whispering woods and riverrun ) , and bring the war into the lannister heartlands . 
  yes it is . 
  ( the starks learn about this only a few minutes before catelyn rides off to deal with walder frey . ), 
  one more reason * not * to let them cross : the war is going badly for the starks so far , and the freys want to be on the winning side . 
  nothing !, 
  * nothing * happened . 
  it all keeps just going back and forth , there 's no real story arcs any more , and absolutely no chracter development . 
  also , if you imagined your dad telling you a story like this , up until ~ season 5 it was a nice story giving you some background info about your dad when he was younger . 
  by now , it 's just a story about he really never even wanted to be with your mom , but was always in love with `` aunt robin '' . 
  edit : dammit , can i not put * spoilers * in here ? 
  my post is only a little spoilerish , of course , but still : how can i hide it ? 
  he 's already south of the neck , though - shipping in at white harbor would first mean marching his entire army back up north . 
  shipping in is a neat idea at least , but sailing up the trident and the red fork while the lannisters hold both banks - good luck with that . 
  you 'd even have to cross the ruby ford ; i have no idea how that would be done by ship ( not one ship ; an armada ) . 
  sending theon home , marrying the westerling girl - we do n't need to discuss this , those were two * stupid * ideas , and if you had to point out * the one thing * that lost the war , it was the westerling marriage . 
  ( of course , it really was a combination of several factors ... ), 
  at the moment when robb and his army are at the twins , he * needs * the crossing , at all costs . 
  if he does n't get it , there is no chance in seven hells that any one of the great houses would even have considered marriage . 
  drank , drank ... that sounds wrong to me . 
  `` drunk '' , maybe ? 
  anyway : enjoy . 
  ( but do the work , first ! ), 
  indeed : the presence of the invisible pink unicorn can be felt in that scene !, 
  just look at the bus window near the right edge of the picture : there she is , and yet she is n't there !, 
  pink , invisible and divine !, 
  oh , wait : that was n't the deity you were talking about ? 
  feeble-minded fool , you !, 
   the curve lets it slide over the victim 's * bones * . 
  ftfy . 
  it still cuts through the poor guy 's flesh , of course . 
  note that the curved blade does n't really work when your enemies are wearing heavy armor - slicing just does n't cut it against steel . 
   also , what are the negative consequences of circumcision ? 
  mostly , about 100 dead boys every year in the us alone . 
  thymos : journal of boyhood studies , vol . 
  1 , spring 2010 , 78-90, 
  lost boys : an estimate of u.s. circumcision-related infant deaths, 
  abstract : baby boys can and do succumb as a result of having their foreskin removed . 
  circumcision-related mortality rates are not known with certainty ; this study estimates the scale of this problem . 
  *** this study finds that approximately 117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths ( 9.01 / 100,000 ) occur annually in the united states *** , about 1.3 % of male neonatal deaths from all causes . 
  because infant circumcision is elective , all of these deaths are avoidable . 
  this study also identifies reasons why accurate data on these deaths are not available , some of the obstacles to preventing these deaths , and some solutions to overcome them . 
  i 'm not sure i understand you correctly . 
  the blade of a rider 's weapon is curved to make sure it does * not * `` hook '' at/within the enemy . 
  the enemy is always on the `` outside '' of the curve . 
  some fine lord he would have been , sitting in his castle while his father is being held hostage and his mother 's family is being besieged . 
  robb did n't even need to hold the riverlands , * edmure * did that for him . 
  ( the second time , that is . 
  after robb lifted the seige of riverrun . ), 
  also , his plan never was to simply take the riverlands and defend them , he wanted to bring the war into the lannister lands . 
  this worked reasonably well and might have worked much better , had edmure , balon greyjoy and tyrion lannister not thwarted the plan , each by his own actions . 
  most readily imagined `` alternate westeros '' : tyrion never gets to manage things in kings landing , or he does n't do quite as well . 
  -  stannis takes the city . 
  -  robb has a very good chance of remaining king in the north forever . 
  it 's double-edged , actually . 
  as far as i remember , we only ever see anybody use the outer edge . 
  [ spoiler , first season got ] ( / s `` mago cuts khal drogo with that side . 
  not really in the fight yet , though . '' ), 
  edit : here 's a video of a guy who made his own arakh - thank god for the internet . 
  warning : if you like weapons , this is pretty painful ; he uses it to cut firewood . 
  anyway , to the point of this thread : he gave it only one edge - the outer one . 
  you 're probably right . 
  i find it hard to tell how big it is exactly , because the only real measure we have is part of the guy 's hand ( which is really close to the camera ) . 
  only the `` scimitar '' version , where the edge is on the outside . 
  but i really do n't understand why so many people ( genericwit being one of them ) seem to take from the show that the arakh 's edge is on the inside ( as with a scythe ) . 
  the show 's arakhs are double-edged , and the outer edge is clearly the one that would be used from horseback . 
  the inner one , i guess , is mostly decorative/traditional . 
  your point being ? 
  nobody * wants * to execute innocent humans . 
  wow . 
  i just read their post about `` halt '' , and they are really good . 
  your definition of `` want '' implies that if you ever use a car , you * want * to die in a car accident . 
  you can easily say `` we oppose abortion because it only kills innocent people '' . 
  this does n't have anything to do with arguing for or against the death penalty . 
  even though i think that my comparison was more accurate , let 's take yours :, 
  car manufacturer a skimps on safety features , knowing that this will allow him to make cheaper cars , but also knowing that some of his customers are going to die in accidents unnecessarily . 
  car manufacturer b places timebombs in his cars to deliberately kill his customers . 
  do both of them * want * their customers to die ? 
  of course , you 're not going to simply answer this question . 
  i can understand that ; it 's not a perfect analogy anyway . 
  ( but it was yours . ), 
  but still , i 'd prefer if you did n't try to come up with a new , even sillier analogy instead . 
  supporters of the death penalty do n't * want * to kill innocent people ; supporters of prison sentences do n't * want * innocent people to go to jail . 
  * if * a fetus is a person , it is certainly about as innocent a person as can be . 
  the entire point of an abortion is to end that person 's life ( * if * it is a person ) . 
  bout_it_bout_it 's point ( which i agree with ) was that there is no contradiction between being both pro-life and a supporter of the death penalty . 
  if you say that pro-lifers oppose abortion because it kills innocent * potential * people , you 're close . 
  bout_it already covered that :, 
   [ and please , spare the `` but babies are not persons !!! '', 
  argument . 
  it is irrelevant . 
  they believe they are humans and their stance springs from that . ], 
  pro-lifers oppose abortion because * they think * that it kills * actual people * - not just potential ones or anything else .
