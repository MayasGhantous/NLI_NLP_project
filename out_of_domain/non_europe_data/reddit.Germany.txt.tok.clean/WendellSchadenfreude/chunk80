  an english duke . 
  - this is already after the end of ck2 , if only by a few years . 
  ( 1461 * is * after 1453 ), 
  - he was n't just a duke , he was the leader of the lancastrian party . 
  in ck2 terms , he was leading the army of a claimant to the throne of england . 
  - this was n't just any battle , it was the largest battle * ever * fought in england . 
  - according to wikipedia , the french had up to 25,000 men at cr\u00e9cy , not 40,000 . 
  incidentally , 25k is the number that you mention as possible for france in ck2 . 
  well done . 
   the entire 100k in arms in ck2 terms would include garrisons . 
  - @dorylaeum : your numbers again differ vastly from wikipedia 's numbers . 
  they estimate the entire seljuk army at up to 8,000 men . 
  patched numbers are fine . 
   there is a reason you ca n't cite wikipedia for papers in high school/college . 
  and that reason is that you ca n't cite * encyclopedias * at all , because you 're supposed to do some research and to know more than what is basically common knowledge . 
  ( in theory , that 's all you find in encyclopedias . ), 
  but in our context here , having wikipedia as a source that backs your claims is infinitely better than having * no source * at all . 
  contemporary sources exaggerate unless proven otherwise . 
   the much higher figures given by contemporary chroniclers such as jean froissart ( 100,000 ) and richard wynkeley ( 80,000 ) have been described by historians as quite exaggerated and `` unacceptable '' , going by the extant war treasury records for 1340 . 
  schnerb , `` the french army before and after 1346 '' in ayton & preston ( 2005 ) , p. 269, 
  [ yay , citing wikipedia 's source this time . 
  damn , that looks good . 
  ( except for the ms paint arrows . 
  your recordings are awful . 
  i have no idea what the two people are syaing , it does n't sound like german . 
  do you have trouble with the word `` ich '' ? 
  the spaniards i know get presents only or mostly on january 6th , and they are brought by the reyes . 
  seems quite appropriate for this map to include the home of the * original * [ saint nicholas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_nicholas ) . 
   he actually was n't next in line ; his two nephews were , but there were rumors that the preceding king , richard 's brother edward iv , had had a precontract of marriage with a woman which invalidated his marriage to his queen , thus making his two sons bastards . 
  i think in ck2 terms , this is n't a fabricated claim , it 's an inherited weak claim . 
  edward , the oldest son of the former king , inherited the throne , and richard happened to be his warden . 
  in ck2 , he would have had to found a faction , press his claim , and edward could have accepted his demand - reality was just a little faster with richard simply imprisoning his ward immediately and letting him rot in the dungeons . 
  point is : when pressing a weak claim , your character also does n't simply announce that he * wants * to be king and will now proceed to dispose the rightful king . 
  he will do as richard did and fabricate a tale about how the currect king * is n't * really the rightful king . 
   and is it as `` bad '' as publicly using the nazi swastika ? 
  that part 's easy : no , it is n't - nothing else is . 
  you can sometimes see people wearing the communist red star or hammer & sickle somewhere on their clothes . 
  i 'm quite certain they never get into any legal trouble because of * that * . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's actually legal , but it seems to be without consequences . 
  there is no reason to believe that the factions that formed the islamic front are anywhere near the same size . 
  based on the fact that there are no reports about anything the kurdish islamists have ever accomplished , they do n't seem to be that significant . 
  45,000 is basically the official number of fighters claimed by ypg , quoted for instance [ here ] ( http://www.jungewelt.de/2013/11-06/021.php ) . 
  [ german article ] or simply on wiki 's page [ about them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_protection_units ) , make of that what you want . 
  there seems to be no information about kurdish islamists , because they are too insignificant for anyone to write about them . 
  given that , i think 2,000 is quite a generous estimate . 
  of course not , they 're not * his * fighters , they are kurds . 
  if you have more reliable numbers , do let us know . 
  i do n't think there have been any impressively successful government offensives in rebel-held * urban * areas . 
  the most urban areas where there were recent government advances would be the qalamon towns , if you want to call those urban . 
  it was surprising how fast the saa managed to open a route to aleppo , but that 's just controlling an open road - that 's easy when you have tanks and air support . 
  i 'm quite sure they would have relieved the kindi hospital had they been able . 
  if not for the propagandistic success , then simply to get their soldiers out of there . 
  - there were at least a hundred soldiers in that hospital when the siege began ( iirc , and possibly more ) , and they knew that they were sitting targets for vbieds for a while now . 
  `` that man '' ? 
  it 's not just the driver who died in that instant . 
  can anybody explain what 's happening in the hospital in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3wcrerwk3e&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=30 ) ? 
  none from the same source . 
  what we can piece together : the government bombed as-sukkari yesterday - in the map that 's at the very end of the green bulge in central aleppo . 
  so it seems there has been hardly any change in that area . 
  the regime did take some parts of the industrial city in the north , but never all of it . 
  maybe roughly the eastern half . 
  if they want to relieve the central prison ( the northernmost orange spot on the map ) , that 's their most likely route . 
  well , and then the news from this very thread : the orange spot at al-kindi is no more . 
  i do n't know what he calls it , but unless/until i see an actual `` phase ii '' , i call it meaningless . 
  they tried to break a siege , and failed . 
   anyways , we saw this happen to the us in vietnam , iraq and afghanistan . 
  the soviets had the same problem in its operation in afghanistan as well . 
  there are some crucial differences that make these comparisons problematic . 
  the most important one being that the saa is not a foreign invading force that is peceived as the common enemy by the general population . 
  you are right , of course , that actually * holding * conquered territories is key for any possible regime success . 
  meh , it 's somewhat mixed . 
  i 'd say there 's two things to watch out for in the near future : do the rebels manage to break the siege of e. ghouta , and does the government manage to take yabrood . 
  other than that - if either side could make some actual progress in aleppo , that would be important . 
  but it does n't look like that 's happening at the moment . 
  looking forward to reading it . 
  ( the internet makes some things difficult - i just want to emphasize that this is no sarcasm , i 'm * actually * looking forward to reading it . ), 
  still : capturing a few towns is nice , but does n't have much value by itself . 
  east ghouta is still surrounded , the besieged area has just gotten a little larger . 
  to me it felt like the biggest rebel success in east ghouta was capturing those ~ 40 shi'a militamen . 
  ( i guess you know what i 'm talking about ... ), 
  if the rebels managed e.g. 
  to take the damascus airport , * that * would be valuable . 
  but a village more or less is just a village . 
   there are powers that want the fight to go on as much as possible . 
  i 've heard this before , but i do n't really buy it . 
  who do you think wants the fighting to go on as long as possible ? 
  i can imagine some people gleefully watching the sectarian warfare because they like the idea of muslims killing each other - but i ca n't really picture anyone who would always * support * the losing side to prolong this war . 
  were they all ? 
  i only remember that their commander was executed immediately . 
  now that i think about it ... 
  i sure ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  [ google says this is captain mustafa . 
  ] ( http://cdn2.shipspotting.com/photos/middle/4/7/7/1028774.jpg ) he looked different in the video ... 
  serious answer : i do n't think anybody here knew that `` captain mustafa '' existed until he did n't . 
  wether he was important at all is impossible to tell . 
  he might have been just a buddy of the other guys you saw in the video , or he may have been a battle commander and brilliant tactician who was important for all the rebel groups in western aleppo . 
  somewhat reasonable guess : he was an `` officer '' coordinating the rebels in [ khan alasal ] ( http://wikimapia.org/#lang=de&amp;lat=36.169140&amp;lon=37.039896&amp;z=15&amp;m=b ) and possibly a few neighbouring villages . 
  killing him in that case is nice for the saa , but not really a big deal . 
   the building however is not as fortified as kindi where you had thousands of empty rooms that could be used as firing positions . 
  actually , the prison is much bigger than the hospital .
