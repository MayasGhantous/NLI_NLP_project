   this changes the outlook on the situation in aleppo completley . 
  it does ? 
  i thought it was always the rebel plan to attack the prison next , so this is simply what was to be expected . 
   that the rebels would move ~ ~ south ~ ~ ** east ** to defend sheik najjar, 
  best if you move your comment over [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/1tgswl/the_war_nerd_saudis_syria_and_blowback/ ) , where this article was posted to this sub first . 
   so , do you see now why people deny al qaeda will be allowed to gain power ? 
  do you now agree that it is highly unlikely that al qaeda will be allowed to gain power ? 
  no , and i do n't see how you could possibly believe that . 
  there is * one * provinicial capital where assad lost power . 
  that city * is * now ruled by al qaeda . 
  those are simple , undeniable facts . 
  a group of polar bears is called a * celebration * . 
  seems fitting . 
  a group of polar bears is called a * celebration * . 
  i 'm not even making that up !, 
  [ they 're also called an * aurora * or a * sleuth * , but i prefer celeration . ], 
  on the contrary , this will make him * lose * dublin . 
  when you press the claims of one of your vasalls , they stay your vasalls as long as their new title is n't the same level as yours ( or higher ) . 
  but when one of your vasalls * inherits * a title that is higher than their current title from outside your realm , they are no longer your vasall . 
  read xelzeno 's post : he suggested killing the uncle ( the earl of dublin ) , so that the child of uncle & aunt inherits dublin , then killing the aunt so that this kid also inherits the duchy of moray . 
  but that 's actually ba advice , because it would make op lose dublin . 
  he acatually has to come up with some plan if he does n't want to lose dublin . 
  ( killing the might work , for starters . ), 
   i would n't recommend a black person to move to the east of germany . 
  not sure if i agree with this , but in any case , for clarification :, 
  berlin is * not * part of `` the east of germany '' . 
  - is klar . 
  if you press the claim , it does n't matter . 
  when they * inherit * it , it does . 
  [ about 40 % . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/chinademography.svg ), 
  do you think people downvoted you because this was so easy to find out and you did n't even try ; or because they did n't like you to questioning the value of the data given ? 
  this is such a nonsense statistic . 
  i 'm not saying air pollution is n't a problem in china , but giving this percentage does n't help seeing how big of a problem it is . 
  if only one chinese died from lung cancer 30 years ago and 5 died this year , that 's an increase by 400 % , but still an outstandingly good number . 
  if on the other hand lung cancer was already somewhat common thirty years ago , then it 's a huge problem now . 
  but this number does n't tell us anything about that . 
  use * good * statistics , please . 
  if you had predicted to the 1970 's chinese their current cancer rates and their current gdp , they would have been overjoyed . 
  actually , it does n't . 
   nationwide in the last three decades , an era in which china opened up its economy and industrialized , deaths from lung cancer have risen 465 % . 
  it says `` deaths '' , not `` death rates '' or anything . 
  when you look at the study , you can see that it 's actually death rates , not deaths , but this article is simply bad and does n't make that clear . 
  you 're comparing the chinese incidence rate to the us death rate now . 
  `` new cases '' in the us is 52.4 / 100,000 ( your source ) . 
  so let me chose a new title :, 
   lung cancer in beijing is 20 % more common than in the us . 
  that 's a number we can work with . 
  in short , he could press a claim for the byzantine empire and every single one of its counties and duchies - is that it ? 
  ah ... ` tis the season to overinterpret the word `` maid '' . 
  it does n't have to be a virgin , you know , it can also mean just any young/unmarried woman . 
  the prophecy is fullfilled perfectly , you do n't have to construct something incredible like a virgin giving birth . 
  - wait , i might be now thinking about the wrong prophecy . 
  so can we delete this thread and repost it ? 
  leaving out `` checkpoint '' is n't just a normal typo . 
  it 's like saying `` the government has liberated aleppo '' instead of '' ... a village near aleppo . '', 
  do n't spend too much time thinking about your councillors ' families , they barely matter . 
  keep your court small enough ; there 's a fertility penalty ( for unlanded characters ) if you have more than 30 people in your court . 
  make sure you have a few talented characters around to raise children , your own children our important foreign children . 
  these courtiers need to be your culture and religion . 
  it 's good if a few of them are content ( to raise the heirs of your strongest vasalls - also nice if they are zealous , gregarious , etc. ), 
  or have all kinds of good traits ( to raise your children ) . 
  of course you usually want to raise your own heir , but you might need a good courtier to do it for you e.g. 
  if you ever inherit the realm as a child . 
  other than that : if you have courtiers who are genius , quick , strong , or attractive , it might be worth it to find reasonable mates for them , so that you get future generations of talented courtiers and possible partners for some of your children . 
  but as i said : do n't worry about all this too much . 
  if you do n't heed it at all , you can still conquer the world . 
  i usually try to find partners for all my councillors , but mostly as a roleplaying aspect , to reward them for leal service . 
  short answers : no , their stats do n't give you any direct bonuses . 
  if you will , the best wife for a courtier whom you 're about to land is a celibate one , or one in her late 30s . 
  this makes it unlikely for the couple to ever have kids , and upon the former courtier 's death , you get your land back . 
  early expansion is usually simply slower when you are a vasall lord . 
  you can usually wage war outside the realm as you please . 
  internally , you can still fabricate claims , though ( depending on crown authority ) you might have to wait for a civil war 'till you can actually press them . 
  never had anything like this . 
  have you waited for a few in-game days ? 
  maybe this just sorts itself out quickly . 
  otherwise , i 'm afraid you 'll have to wait for them to form a faction and present their demands again - better start saving up money to hire mercs for the civil war . 
  ... possibly also humping each other . 
  - hey , it 's just fair !, 
   [ one opposition doctor  `` with the help of informant doctors and iranian , russian , and korean physicians '', 
  iran and russia are strong supporters of the regime , of course - but is there a reason he might have chosen to include * korea * in that list ? 
  it just seems so random , as if he had added new zealand or lesotho . 
   sorry i 've been so long replying . 
  yeah , i 'm sorry it took me so long , too . 
  thanks for the awesome comments .

   ypg fighters in rojava . 
  did they simply write `` ypg '' in the dirt on their jeep ? 
  that seems a bit lazy - but i like the kurdish pragmatism . 
  come on , put a minimum of effort into your question . 
  are you wondering why he wants them to win , or why he does n't want anybody else to win as well ? 
  a continental quilt . 
  true , but they * do * come from that . 
  the fact that there are other ways does n't change anything . 
  [ according to the sydney morning herald , the infant circumcision rate in australia was 12.9 % as of 2003 . 
  however , rates in the states varied , with highest rates in queensland ( 19.3 % ) , new south wales ( 16.3 % ) and south australia ( 14.3 % ) , and the lowest in tasmania ( 1.6 % ) .
