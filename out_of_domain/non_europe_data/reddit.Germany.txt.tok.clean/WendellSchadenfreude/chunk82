  [ in new south wales , rates have risen from 13 % in 1999 to 18 % in 2009 . 
  in victoria , according to the herald sun , the prevalence of 2010 circumcisions indicated that rates have risen but no information was provided about the rates prior to the rise . 
  non-therapeutic infant circumcision is no longer provided in public hospitals in new south wales , tasmania , western australia , victoria , and south australia . 
  the royal australasian college of physicians ( racp ) estimated in 2010 that 10 to 20 percent of newborn boys are being circumcised .

  the bible quote is daniel 12:3 . 
   those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens , and those who lead many to righteousness , like the stars for ever and ever . 
  although the german version does n't say `` those who are wise '' , it says `` the teachers '' .

  worked ( literally : weaved ) at the parish since its foundation until the evening of his life in devotional love and **** - faithfulness . 
  i think it really says `` an der gemeinde gewebt '' , `` weaving the community/parish '' . 
  `` the evening of his life '' [ lebensabend , nowadays not spelled with that weird '' = '' in the middle of the word anymore ] is quite a common expression for old age in german , it might sound too elevated in english . 
  well , yes , it does . 
  it just does other things beside that .

  is that the trailer park version ? ), 
  here 's an article that was posted a while ago . 
  it tries too hard to be funny , but is still quite informative and might help anwer your question . 
   the monarch [ abdullah ] , who is hosting french president francois hollande , also accused assad of having attracted islamic extremists to syria . 
  did he really say that ? 
  what an incredibly absurd and twisted accusation . 
  ha , i finally realized what kind of * treue * that is :, 
  the faithfulness of the shepherd . 
  good post . 
  i do n't like what 's happening , but i like how you are reporting it . 
   a gendarmerie team that searched the truck and discovered ammunition , weapons and some humanitarian aid in the cargo informed both the chief prosecutor and lekesiz before parking the truck in the parking lot of a nearby factory until the prosecutor arrived at the scene . 
  in the meantime , the three occupants of the vehicle were detained . 
   rebuilding will be a massive , massive problem . 
  estimates put what syria has lost on the order of more than $ 50 billion . 
  to put that in perspective : 50 billion is roughly $ 2,500 per syrian , or syria 's pre-war gdp per year . 
  just imagine the letters their ds would have made them write for * that * . 
   wait , one stick a month , now two bottles a year . 
   those are two different units of measurement . 
  a year has twelve months . 
  it 's ok , we all sometimes have gaps in our knowledge .

   there is n't mass lootings and dope fiends run amok, 
  come to think of it ... the cartels stand to lose a lot of money due to legalization . 
  if i were them , i 'd pay a bunch of kids * to get really high , run amok in a mall , and blame it on mj in court . 
  * money to their families , that is . 
  and they should probably do this in a state with no death penalty . 
  this really is n't a smart thing to say . 
  if you do n't like the reports , do n't read them . 
  if you read them , remember that they are about science , not about miracles . 
  we do n't have a pill that you take once and it cures any cancer you might have . 
  we likely wo n't ever have such a pill . 
  but we * are * making progress incrementally , and this article is about one small step in this process . 
  if you compare what a typical cancer diagnosis meant thirty years ago to what it means today , you 'll see how far we 've come . 
  this is n't bullshit . 
  it 's research . 
  we now know that blocking this one protein eradicates one type of cancer in mice . 
  we did n't know this before . 
  this quote being in the original klingon adds meaning , but i 'll still add a rough translation :,

  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gnomes_of_z%c3%bcrich ), 
   gnomes of z\u00fcrich is a disparaging term for swiss bankers . 
  swiss bankers are popularly associated with extremely secretive policies , while gnomes in fairy tales live underground , in secret , counting their riches . 
  z\u00fcrich is the commercial center of switzerland .

  one question i always wondered :, 
  is theft a rampaging problem on that camping area ? 
  you just know that at certain times in the evening , everybody goes to the big stages . 
  one single criminal could easily search through dozens or hundreds of tents . 
  is there some kind of security , or do people simply leave nothing in their tents ?

  one of my first games , i played a polish count . 
  became duke , became king of poland . 
  then a german duke showed up and informed me that he and some other dukes wanted * me * to be the holy roman emperor . 
  i gladly joined their war , became emperor . 
  then all hell broke loose in germany - they did n't like being ruled by a foreigner after all . 
  i managed to hold on to my title through one or two rebellions . 
  then my ruler dies unexpectedly , and a daughter inherits .
