  i also lose the polish kingdom title in the succession . 
  factions jump up everywhere , and one of them gets too strong for me . 
  from holy roman emperor , i am reduced to a polish duchess in her mid-twenties , stuck in a regular marriage . 
  at this point , i 'm mostly waiting for one of the much stronger dukes to take away the last of my land and end my suffering . 
  at this low point of the game , i also need to murder my husband and re-marry ( matrilineally ) just in time so that i can still have children of my dynasty . 
  also i also have kill off one or two of * my own children * from my first marriage . 
  i have * one * son . 
  one chance . 
  every time he gets the sniffles , i feel physically ill myself . 
  but even if he survives , do i have a chance for a comeback ? 
  turns out , i do . 
  i suddenly realize that thanks to some long forgotten marriage agreement that i brokered in better days , i stand to inherit * byzantium * from an uncle or cousin or something . 
  the guy tries having children of his own a few times , but when his wife finally gets pregnant , she is suddenly assassinated . 
  what monster would do that , murder a pregnant woman ? 
  ... anyway , this happens three times , and then my uncle finally accepts that marriage is not for him . 
  he dies , i die , and my son goes on to rule an ever expanding byzantium for more than six decades . 
  that 's why they 'll be learning english first , and then choose between french and russian . 
  that does n't sound unreasonable . 
   i think the salient argument in 1491 is that infectious disease from outside the americas had already demolished the indigenous population well before the arrival of columbus . 
  not `` well before '' . 
  they only arrived with columbus and the other europeans . 
  the point is that smallpox , measles and other european dieseases spread across the americas much faster than the europeans themselves . 
  also , his genes are n't blind . 
  the north-african muslims in turn [ raided as far north as iceland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_abductions ) . 
   in 1607 , english historian william camden stated that it was derived from the sicilian triskelion . 
  you look like a movie villain . 
  what do they mean by `` entry prohibited '' ? 
  cities like bordeaux or brest certainly still were inhabited , right ? 
   ( am i doing this right ? ), 
  i think so . 
  that 's neat actually , that gravity would be directly proportional to radius . 
  playing as the king of greece , a vasall to byzantium , i managed to throw the demon invaders back into the sea from whence they came . 
  the annoying thing : this pop-up is great , but it now keeps showing up once or twice per month . 
  any ideas on how i get this to stop ? 
  i thought the triggers might be messed up because the aztecs never even conquered a single county . 
  side observation : despite not conquering anything , the aztecs converted one province to their religion and another one to their culture . 
  huh ? 
  it 's not as big as you might think . 
  i 'm a catholic , and when i still was a duke in greece , i won a crusade for andalusia . 
  so then there was a little byzantium in spain , and a lot of it in greece/anatolia , but nothing in between . 
  ( i only added barcelona and tunis very recently . ), 
  i recognition of your services , i award you the honorary title `` master of the code '' . 
  nope , just me . 
  although they somehow managed to also botch their simultaneous invasion of * norway * !, 
  they occupied iceland , but then the war somehow ended inconclusively . 
  i 'm not sure why , maybe because norway ( liege of iceland ) was taken over by sweden . 
  anyhow , the aztecs gave up their occupied territories and had some 80k soldiers just sitting idly on iceland after that . 
  in mauretania , they landed some 100k soldiers . 
  beating them was surprisingly easy . 
  i hired all the holy orders and some mercenaries , which brought me up to around 60k men - about half of them cavalry . 
  the aztecs were spread thin , and i never had to fight a battle in which i did n't clearly outnumber them . 
  sad part of this : my liege - the official target of the invasion - did n't get any war success from my butchering thousands . 
  the war dragged on until the war succes was at 100 % from controlling the territory alone . 
  in that time , the aztecs did their best to prove how worthless the ai still is sometimes : they sailed their fleet ( 1000 ships exactly ) up to iceland , loaded up * one single company * of ~ 5000 soldiers and came back to africa , while the rest of their icelandic army stayed behind . 
  they repeated that until the very end ... 
  nope . 
  mine was ironman too , and it 's still running fine . 
  you just need to restart for the changes to take effect . 
  answer . 
  faster than the human . 
  if they are going in the same direction , that is . 
  you found the two big ones . 
  levies have been reduced . 
  reason , i think , was to make massive expansion and the late game a little harder . 
  and most cultural requirements for titles have been waived ( for the player ) , because ... 
  i feel the question should be : why were they ever in the game in the first place ?

   i do n't like folge as singular in this context . 
  it reminds me of a mathematische folge or a thronfolge , in that it sounds more like ` sequence ' than ` consequence ' . 
  i think that 's just you . 
  the * duden * also lists `` consequence '' as the main meaning of `` folge '' , not `` sequence '' . 
  i ca n't really think of any advantages - i just find this very cool . 
  ok , one maybe-advantage : he can still wage jihad on * other * christians , right ? 
  - can you join these ? 
  ( the tooltip for joining your vasalls ' wars says you ca n't do it * except for crusades/jihad * . ), 
  even if you ca n't , this is a kingdom-cb against christians . 
  even if you ca n't chose the target yourself nor fight the war , you might still get lucky with this . 
  that 's the opposite of a newbie mistake . 
  rule of thumb : building * anything * makes the game harder . 
  using the money for mercenaries is the better alternative in almost every case . 
  i like the norse retinue-buildings ( and when you 're at it , training grounds ) . 
  and they * might * really be worth building , in your capital country at least , once your income is at  20/month . 
  but it 's enough if you do that now , no need to restart . 
  the other guys might also have high levies right now because they are defending against infidels and all their vasalls love them for it . 
  just looking at the eco buildings : even the cheapest ( most efficient ) castle towns means that you effectively * lost * money for 50 years . 
  use your money instead to hire mercenaries and take over somebody else 's castle town . 
  and his castles , churches , and cities . 
  you * ca n't * beat the roi that conquering new territory has in this game . 
  just try it : in your next game , you are only allowed to spend money on bribes , events , and a minimum of necessary titles/claims . 
  * and mercenaries * . 
  by the way , i * wish * that things were different . 
  i 'm a builder at heart , not a warlord . 
  i think you 've been lead astray . 
  this lead should rhyme with read . 
  this was funnier than the [ `` my blackberry is not working '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kag39jki0li ) sketch . 
  i was thinking of also instating a cult to worship me and praise my achievements . 
  would you like to be my high priest ?
