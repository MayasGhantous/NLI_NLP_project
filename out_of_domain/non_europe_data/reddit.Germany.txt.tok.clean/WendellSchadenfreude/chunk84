   `` halten '' is rather colloquial in this context . 
  no , it is n't . 
  edit : well , i 'd love to expand on this a little , but there 's really not much more to say . 
  the duden does n't mark it as colloquial either . 
  `` halten '' simply is not a colloquial word , not in this meaning and not in any other , and i do n't know where you even got that idea . 
  what date is it , and when did you start ? 
  '' ] ( http://www.amazon.de/halten-thomas-achtzehn-autoren-antworten/dp/359612252x ) - do you think he chose a deliberately colloquial title ? 
  we do n't even know the context of op 's question is , but i do n't think it matters . 
  conquer land , have at least low feudal taxes , and relatively high city + church taxes . 
   however , i highly doubt that 's where the video is . 
  why ? 
  that 's seems like a pretty realistic place for the saa to have conquered .

  [ robert baden-powell ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_baden-powell ) ? 
  i almost hope that you simply posted in the wrong thread by accident . 
  `` thanks but i 'll pass . '', 
  and `` just not interested , sorry  '' - how could you possibly say these responses are rude ? 
  and those are n't in reply to a nice , thought-out message by a guy who appears to have read her profile , but in reply to a generic one-liner . 
  seriously - you complain about rudeness , but you call people a `` bitch '' for that ? 
  insisting to hear * reasons * why a person does n't want to chat with you is asking for insults . 
  she was still kind enough , she did * not * call him ugly . 
   she had to have the last word . 
  he literally ordered her to stop talking . 
  he even felt the need to * tell her that he blocked her * . 
  i aggree with your general assessment that this subreddit is often rude , but you 're simply defending the wrong guy here . 
   `` i know how you look '' translates to `` i think you 're ugly . '', 
  that is * your * translation . 
  i think it translates exactly to `` you 're not my type . '', 
  and she already said thanks and sorry . 
  posting this thread is somewhat petty , i wo n't deny that . 
  calling her a bitch in this thread is ruder than anything either of the two people did in that conversation . 
  why ? 
  are you 17 already and it has n't happened yet ? 
  byzantium also has the varangian guard , and some very cool honorary titles . 
  i 'm mostly thinking about the `` despot '' title , which counts as being `` born in the purple '' . 
  this means that even with primogeniture , you can freely choose your heir from all children born before you became the emperor , because the one you make despot comes before all others . 
  generally yes , because keeps your realm calm and peaceful . 
  however : if a vassal duke already likes you even though you are the direct liege of one ( or more ) of his de jure counties , keep them for a while . 
  your heir can do the transfer right after the succession to balance out the new ruler penalty . 
  this is for dukes . 
  for kings : you mostly do n't want to have too many king level vassals . 
  you do n't need to create all available titles . 
  a king who controls 20 % + of your realm is a dangerous vassal . 
  that is correct . 
  but the ingame tooltip describes this as `` counts as being born in the purple '' , because it offers the same prefered place in the line of succession . 
  [ wikipedia 's article on the bridge has a section dedicated only to the suicides .

   after a fall of four seconds , jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph or about 120 km/h . 
  most of the jumpers die from impact trauma . 
  about 5 % of the jumpers survive the initial impact but generally drown or die of hypothermia in the cold water .

  has there been a king of ireland before you ? 
  my idea was that either you 're a pagan ( and thus not allowed to borrow from the jews ) , or that the jews were expelled from ireland by an ai king of ireland . 
  the expulsion might still be active , and you 'd at some point get the option ( in the intrigue menu ) to reinvite the jewry . 
  running any mods ? 
  i 'm basically out of ideas . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the khazars ( or any other jews ) losing their land in the east would n't affect this . 
  can you also translate the poem at 3:50 and the slogans the other guys on the bus are shouting , roughly ?

  bab al-hawa , where the warehouses are , is right on the border to the turkish province of hatay . 
  [ wikimapia , about 40 km west of alppo . 
  this al-bab is also about 40 km from aleppo , but to the northeast . 
  bab just means `` gate '' , so there 's a ton of places that have this as part of their name . 
  i do n't believe this . 
  i 'm quite sure this twitter account is confusing two places called `` bab '' . 
  quoting myself from a different thread :, 
   bab al-hawa , where the warehouses are , is right on the border to the turkish province of hatay . 
  [ wikimapia , about 40 km west of alppo . 
   this al-bab is also about 40 km from aleppo , but to the northeast . 
   bab just means `` gate '' , so there 's a ton of places that have this as part of their name . 
  in any case : that second bab ( the one ne of aleppo , * not * al-hawa ) was conquered by isis a few days ago , and they killed dozens of other rebels there . 
  until i see more detailed proof , i 'm not going to believe this twitter account that the same thing happened days later in another place named bab . 
  ( i do n't think bab al-hawa even * has * 40 residents . 
  it 's a border checkpoint , not a village . ), 
  edit : btw , i do n't use twitter . 
  anybody who does - could you tell/ask that user about this ? 
  the point is that the biological mechanical gear shown in op 's picture is * not * an example of biomimetics . 
  we did n't see this image and decide to build similar gears ourselves . 
  we already have gears and have had them for centuries - but we only now found out that they also occur in nature . 
  i do n't even think calling this `` biomimetics '' is close , because that 's pretty much the opposite . 
  yes , much better than you are , un-kind person . 
  * this * is what the guy said :, 
   how do we invent the same thing that has been around in nature for a millenia ? 
  he was n't * suggesting * that we study nature to find ideas for inventions , he was wondering how it could have happened that gears were `` invented '' independently by humans and by nature . 
   without the plea bargain , criminals who are guilty have simply no reason ** not ** to plead `` not guilty '' .

   elective succession does n't take agnatic-cognatic gender laws into account . 
  however with absolute cognatic you can grant titles to female characters . 
  i think the way it 's explained now is very confusing . 
  `` does n't take gender laws into account '' , what does that mean ? 
  ( i know what it means ingame , but it could just as well mean that women are * never * eligible , even when you are absolute cognatic , because * the gender law is n't taken into account * . ),
