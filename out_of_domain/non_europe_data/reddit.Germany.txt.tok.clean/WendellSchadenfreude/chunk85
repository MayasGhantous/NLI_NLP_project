  maybe change it to something like : under elective , female characters are always eligible , even when using absolute agnatic succession . 
  however , you can * grant * them titles only under absolute cognatic . 
  you sometimes need to restart the game for some characters to show up . 
  also , your grandsons are n't eligible if their father ( or mother , in a matrilineal marriage ) is still alive - you ca n't simply `` skip '' generations in elective . 
  i actually find it annoying that elective is so easy for big empires . 
  i wish there were some additional penalties/requirements . 
  whoa , whoa , whoa ... / r/athiesm , the subreddit for humanists with a spelling problem , barely has more than 2000 subscribers . 
  and they do n't seem angry at all - it 's a very welcoming place . 
  good , except there 's an `` are '' missing . 
   even if there * are * eligible males . 
  but wait , is that correct ? 
  so when combining elective with pure agnatic succession , women ca n't be elected ? 
  ( i think i 've never really used that combination . ), 
   greenpeace findet chemikalien in fabriken, 
  or imprecise . 
  also , how do you know this was an airstrike and not just artillery ? 
  ( i assume that you ca n't tell the difference , but if you can , this is a serious question . ), 
  dar al-shifa simply means `` house of healing '' and seems to be a somewhat generic hospital name , so i ca n't find out anything about this specific hospital . 
  maybe , just like al-kindi , it was used as an improvised barracks by one side or the other . 
  no instrumental music . 
  do you think that 's because they just did n't have instruments or electricity ( for radios ) , because they just happened to like this a capella song - or because instruments are * forbidden * ? 
  why iceland and not faroes ? 
  ( faroes was my most fun norse game . ), 
  if you ask wikipedia , that 's actually not true ; unless he was adopted before 1977 . 
  ( although it might still be easy to get the citizenship back . 
  but that 's probably a question for an expert . ), 
  may i ask how old you are ? 
  i never heard of german kids being adopted to foreign countries , i 'm curious when this happened . 
  no , no - i want to destroy it , not give it away . 
  you know , ahm ... to send a message . 
  to someone . 
  i know the fsa * as presented in western media * would n't , that 's why i found this video interesting . 
  the difference between this video and similar video by the saa is simply quite obvious . 
  [ example one ] ( http://www.military.com/video/forces/humor/saa-music-video-is-hilarious/1873313014001/ ), 
  [ example two ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9856060/syrian-soldiers-filmed-dancing-to-usher-song-in-online-video.html ), 
  i have n't had a penpal since i was 12 years old ... 
  i would love to try that again . 
  details in private messages , ok ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ryghtrqkgs ), 
  the saa is * also * fighting this civil war . 
  you do n't need to carry a harp or pipe organ around , it 's enough to have a radio or a keyboard . 
  they have cameras and are filming themselves singing , so they do n't seem to be too concerned with anything * at that moment * . 
  i think this video shows that even the `` moderate '' groups * enforce * the ban on music instruments , even during a civil war when they should have more pressing concerns . 
  how do you react when your 5 year old reponds by claiming he had intercourse with your mother last night ? 
  because in my experience , that 's usually what happens ( on voicechat ) . 
  that one sounds to my ears like any other arab pop music . 
  [ example 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txrt3duoiu ), 
  it 's not bad , but i ca n't tell one song from the other . 
  i have no idea if this looks like an airstrike , i 'm not an expert . 
  although i know that cities can easily be destroyed by ( conventional ) airstrikes , even worse than this picture shows . 
  [ cologne 1945 , all done by airstrikes .

  na , she 's probably gon na like you better than before , because all the `` wants control of the duchy of x '' go away . 
  anyway - if she 's the right culture and religion and a de jure vasall of yours , a small gift should be enough to convinve her to become a vasall . 
  ooh , that 's perfect . 
  and i had n't seen a comment referencing that incident in days . 
  maybe weeks , even . 
  or l\u00ebtzebuergesch , if you really want to know how * they * call it . 
   both languages have almost no overlapping words , and a completely different grammatical structure . 
  as a german , i can always * roughly * understand what a dutch song is about . 
  there are often lines that sound just like silly-german . 
  is it always food ? 
  so this is `` shot down '' , not `` show down '' , right ? 
  i was expecting a video of two helicopters fighting each other ( `` show down '' ) ... 
  yeah , and for them as well , i would n't say that they have `` no overlapping words , and a completely different grammatical structure '' . 
  the only criterion i know of to distinguish dialects from separate languages is that there are no `` intermediate '' forms between to languages , while dialects ( usually ? ), 
  occur in a continuum . 
  i think it 's true that there are no `` intermediate '' forms between german and dutch , which would make them clearly separate ( though similar ) languages . 
  asyx ' comment seems to imply that there are . 
  the claimant will be your vasall , if, 
  - the claimed title was lower than your own highest title, 
  and one or more of the following is true :, 
  - the claimant is of your dynasty * or *, 
  - the claimed land is part of your de jure territory * or *, 
  - the claimant already is a vasall of yours when you enforce your demands ( i.e. 
  when you make peace ), 
  what 's that in reference to ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  no , that 's not correct . 
  if you press a claim for one of your vassals , he remains your vassal ( with his new title ) in any case , * unless * his new title is at least the same level as * your * title . 
  * his * old title does n't matter ; only that he had one and was your vassal . 
  if you 're the king of france and the count of amiens - your vassal - holds a claim on the duchy of alsace in the hre , you can press that claim . 
  the new duke of alsace ( and count of amiens ) will be your vassal . 
  it 's different for inheritances , maybe that 's what 's confusing you . 
  if one of your counts * inherits * a duchy , he becomes independent or a vassal of that duchy 's liege . 
  what about that ? 
  if you press the wife claim and she is * not * landed herself , * not * a member of your dynasty , and the title is * not * your de jure vassal , she will get the title but * not * be your vassal . 
  her husband does n't matter in this . 
  of course , husband and wife often have the same heir . 
  in this case , it gets even more complicated ... , 
  [ if one title is higher than the other , the child will usually end up being a vassal of that higher title 's liege . 
  if both titles are of the same rank , the child will be and remain a vassal of the liege of the parent * who dies first * . 
  high crown authority makes this more complicated , and i do n't exactly know * what * it does . ], 
  well , i can only tell you this much about your comment ( in the other thread ) :, 
   edit : here 's some more added context : i reloaded , and just murdered his dad instead so he inherits . 
  quicker to do . 
  that 's not the same thing . 
  inheritances have different rules than pressed claims . 
  the heir becomes a vassal of the higher title 's liege - in this case , a vassal of the hre because the kingdom is higher than the county . 
  so the screenshot does n't help us much in this case .
