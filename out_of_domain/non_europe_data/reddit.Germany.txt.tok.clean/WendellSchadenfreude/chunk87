  but stop when you reach 11-7 , because you 're at 100 % then . 
   `` schmitz '' looks like a surname to me , with no speacial meaning . 
  you 're misunderstanding op . 
  i turn around , just to look at him , and already his shoulder is broken . '', 
  that 's what he says . 
  that guy 's shoulder is broken , but oh , it was n't on purpose . 
  what he * means * , that 's a different question . 
  but it gets rather clear if you keep reading . 
  edit : i 'm not sure your translation of `` ringen '' as `` struggle '' is good in this context . 
  to me , `` he never struggled '' sounds like `` he always had enough money '' , while schmitz is simply saying that the other guy never * wrestled * . 
  ( of course , this is english word choice , so you know better than i do what the first idea is that pops into your mind when you hear that someone `` never struggled '' . ), 
   i just assumed that frisch meant for this to have a double-meaning . 
  that 's what i meant : it 's very nice that your translation has this double meaning , and it 's somewhat fitting . 
  but the german sentence does n't have that double meaning , it 's quite clearly about physical wrestling . 
  so you 're not actually writing a translation , you 're writing an improved version . 
  exactly !, 
  you get all the benefits of the gesture if you just point out something that you think your friend would like , and then * they * decide wether they like it enough to actually spend money on it . 
  this still proves that you care about your friend , and that you actually spend some thought on what might make them happy . 
  imagine this happy christmas :, 
  `` dad , i thought you might like a new watch . '', 
  * show picture of a watch on your phone * `` oh , that true . 
  yeah , i think i 'll get one just like that . 
  thank you , son ! '', 
  - `` mom , i found a purse that would look great with your favourite dress . '', 
  * picture * `` oh , that 's very sweet of you . 
  but that purse is really far too small , i need a bigger one . 
  i 'll keep my old one for now . '', 
  if this was the standard procedure , i think there 's no way people would ever switch to the way * we * do it . 
  just buying stuff for other people without even asking them first ? 
  getting them crap they do n't really want ? 
  - no , no - i 'll give my family * ideas * , because i * love * them !, 
   i am from europe and whenever i have to contact someone from the us , there 's a 6 hour delay due to time zones , because of that , the correspondance is almost always 1 day behind what it should be . 
  ha , we 'd get rid of that problem , too !, 
  europeans who often work with americans start working at 11 am cet , stay in the office until 7 pm . 
  their american colleagues work from 7 am to 3 pm , est. 
  thanks to this 4-hour difference in their work hours , the time difference has been reduced to just two hours !, 
  [ the european works from 10 am to 6 pm gmt , the american from 12 am to 8 pm . ], 
  this might not work for any two time zones . 
  exactly !, 
  it would n't just be the same , it would be * improved * !, 
  and that aspect is conserved if you only present your friends with your * ideas * about what they might like . 
  you still show you care , you still show you thought about them , you still show that you know them well - but you do n't waste money in the process . 
  * because * the money is n't what presents are all about , there 's no reason to actually spend it . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're aggreeing or objecting . 
  the trouble of thinking of you , of considering your likes - all that would be conserved if we did n't make presents , but instead * presented * our ideas about what our friends and family might like . 
  people would still be using their personal resources - their time , creativity , research effort , power of observation - to find a perfect suggestion to present you . 
  they just would n't have to use their * financial * resources . 
  gut feeling . 
  there really are no rules , we just use the gender that sounds right . 
  if the thought is enough , why is buying stuff still required ? 
  the thought is enough . 
  the present itself is meaningless . 
  i strongly agree . 
   about 90 % of the gifts i give nowadays are alcohol . 
  it 's the spirit that counts !, 
  sure it is . 
  but it 's rotational symmetry . 
  [ sorry for being a smart-ass . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotational_symmetry ), 
  and nothing would change about * that * part , if it was considered appropriate to simply point out things that your friends would like instead of buying them yourself . 
  since the financial transaction is not a crucial part of gifting , that 's the part we can simply leave out to * improve * gifting . 
  no , but you 're the only one who believed it was possible that others might * not * have noticed . 
  agot has a somewhat `` medieval '' setting , and fucking your own children is also considered bad style in westeros . 
  ( see craster . ), 
  that 's something really weird about gifting ( as is ) :, 
  you 're mostly not supposed to make people presents that they just could n't afford . 
  that 's because it messes with the reciprocity . 
  imagine i ( living on minimum wage ) get you a sweater for christmas , and you ( rich kid that you are ) get me a new sports car . 
  with normal presents , we would pretend that everybody gave as much as they got - but here , it 's simply too obvious that this is n't the case and that i wo n't be able to make you a gift of comparable monetary value anytime soon . 
  so i would probably still like having the car - but you would make our friendship awkward . 
  if you make people gifts that are * far * more expensive than the gifts that they ( can ) make you , do n't be surprised if they actually like you * less * for it . 
   examples of literature of this genre included the lord of the rings by j. r. r. tolkien , the chronicles of narnia by c. s. lewis or a song of ice and fire by george r. r. martin . 
  the targs never wed parents to children either . 
  and nobody in westeros seems to think that lysa 's and sweetrobin 's relationship is * normal * . 
  ( despite the fact that it 's not incestuous , just weird . ), 
  sure . 
  play ironman , and you get the achievements . 
  arumbas mod does n't influence that , i use it myself . 
  why unwed ? 
  married characters are often easier to lure to your court . 
  many skilled characters are happy where they are ( because they already are on the council ) , but their wife might not be happy . 
  send the wife a gift ( always just 20 gold ) , then ask * her * to come to your court . 
  if she accepts , her husband will move with her . 
  and if they are unmarried , there 's no reason to insist on a martilineal marriage . 
  just marry them to one of the young women in your court , and immediately after the marriage , ask the woman to come back . 
  60 % of the time , this works every time . 
  i have some achievements , and i never play without arumba 's mod . 
  you do , absolutely . 
  helps a lot if you * do * stuff . 
  preverably in a team , a club , a community , any kind of group . 
  this helps because there will be a few people you see regularly , so you do n't have to tell them `` i want to be your friend '' right the first time you meet them . 
  might want to delete this and resubmit as [ serious ] . 
  / r/outoftheloop - subreddit that explains every inside joke on reddit . 
  because they would have been ignored , and being ignored looks bad on a king . 
  were you dressed like a chessboard , by any chance ? 
  if you work 80 + hours per week and are depressed because you have no friends : quit your fucking job . 
  or go half-day . 
  of course you 'll have no friends if you have no time for friends . 
  [ if you work 80 + hours per week and are happy , i 'm fine with that . ], 
  sure .
