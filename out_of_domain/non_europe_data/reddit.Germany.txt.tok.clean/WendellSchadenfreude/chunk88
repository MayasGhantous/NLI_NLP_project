  but i still think you 're wasting your time * more * if you want to make friends and * do n't * join any clubs , teams , communities . 
  if you do n't like the people you meet in a club , you can still leave and hopefully find a different one . 
  are you friends with them now ? 
  irrelevant ? 
  [ cataphracts . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cataphract ), 
  yes , it is . 
  assuming that your empire wo n't split up upon inheritance , that there wo n't be any poorly timed * major * rebellions , that your retinues are halfway decent , and that you are a better-than-horrible commander , the hordes are going to be a cakewalk for you . 
  the first question is so imprecise . 
  when i had a sip of my father 's beer at 10 ( ? 
  ) , was that the first time i `` drank alcohol '' ? 
  for germany : schadenfreude . 
  it 's joy that you feel at the misfortune of ... - wait , what ? 
  you * do * know what it means ? 
  shit ... 
  this comment has already been submitted to bestof . 
  for zoroastrians . 
  a descendant of the saoshyant , the one who restored zoroastrian rule over persia . 
  these get so much easier when you give a few examples , with a tiny bit of context so that we know what the sentence is actually meant to say . 
  the one example that you give is confusing , i have no idea in which situation one would use that sentence . 
  `` i had him stop playing with the girl . '', 
  - ok , your son used to play with some girl you did n't like , you stopped them , and now you 're bragging about this to the neighbour ? 
  would n't you just say `` i made him stop playing with the girl '' in that case ? 
  - can you describe the situation in which you would use your sentence ? 
  or one of many possible alternatives . 
  bonus question : yes , prefix attached and conjugated . 
  1 ) you should use `` du '' , because they introduced themselves with their first names . 
  ( from the age difference alone , i would still have been comfortable with them using `` du '' while you use `` sie '' , but if you call them by their first names , they are `` du '' . ), 
  2 ) all of this does n't really apply , because they already introduced themselves with their first names - that 's already offering the `` du '' . 
  if you had all started by using `` sie '' , then only they would have been allowed to offer the `` du '' at some point ( or not , if they did n't want to ) . 
  they would probably have done so by simply telling you `` du kannst \u00fcbrigens karl-heinz zu mir sagen '' or something like that . 
  not quite by simply addressing you with `` du '' out of the blue , but not very formal either . 
  i think he asked , by the way , because there are a few parts of germany ( around hamburg , i believe ) where using `` sie '' with the first name is seen as acceptable . 
  munich definitely is n't one of these parts , so you should go with `` du '' . 
   through some rng miracle was able to beat me in the moutains while attacking and with fewer troops . 
  that 's not an rng miracle , that 's cataphracts . 
  people always recommend assassinations in threads like these . 
  i find that very risky and expensive ; any attempt on the byzantine emperor is 450 ( ? ), 
  gold , and he likely has a good spymaster himself , so you might fail a few times . 
  but you have 3k gold , and probably a good income as well . 
  this really does n't look like an enemy who is stronger than you are . 
  ca n't you just hire mercenaries and declare an invasion of armenia ? 
  should be easy enough to crush the byzantine main army with 3-5 mercenary companies and your retinues + levies . 
  ( i 'm inexperienced with muslim characters . 
  * can * you invade armenia ? ), 
  you wo n't get kartli in that war , even if you occupy it . 
  i just wanted to conquer armenia because the ere wo n't be dangerous to you anymore after that - you can then retake kartli by holy war at your own leisure . 
  you can of course just wait for a better time , but i think your odds are n't bad even if you attack right now . 
  just estimate how many mercenaries you will be able to pay for at least a year . 
  should be more than 15k . 
  by `` less accurate '' , they mean that the predictions his model made were less precise . 
  `` where exactly will jupiter and mars be in the nightsky tomorrow at midnight '' , that sort of thing . 
  there were very elaborate heliocentric models to predict this - they required the planetary orbits ( around the earth ) to be full of little bows and ties , but the results were quite accurate . 
  galileo 's model had the planets move round the sun in circles , i believe . 
  this makes the calculations * much easier * , but they were somewhat less accurate because the orbits * are n't * circles , they are ellipses . 
  the heliocentric model was of course far less accurate in hindsight , it did n't describe reality nearly as well . 
  a year 's a long time . 
  you only need to win the first big engagement and then pursue the ~ 30k army until it 's totally gone . 
  after that , you can sacrifice most of the remaining mercenaries to storm a few castles before you send the rest of them home . 
  the byzantine reinforcements , with all their retinues gone , should n't be enough to trouble you . 
  sure , the trick is to find the balance : hire one company more and you can only pay all of them for 12 months exactly , which might not be enough . 
  hire one company less and you might not have superior numbers when you really need them . 
  but i think 3k gold is plenty enough in this situation to bring the ere down without even waiting for rebellions . 
  you could fly her to the us , live there for two years , improve your english , and then fly back , and it would be massively more expensive than having the procedure done in spain !, 
  it 's not in there . 
  probably only possible for your own children , not for your brothers and sisters . 
  too bad . 
  but thank you . 
  i did not legitimize him because his older sister was a genius and he was n't . 
  she died childless at age 17 . 
  then my king died , so the youngest dauther , age 1 , took over . 
  she just died childless at age 18 . 
  sometimes , this game is just mean . 
  ( these were the children of my starting character , so they were the only mambers of my family yet . ), 
  not so sure . 
  they probably do n't have dedicated baggage units . 
  everything the fighters need has to be in those cars . 
  more cars also simply makes them more flexible . 
  it 's sounds unlikely that they are wasting fuel just to appear more numerous . 
  i granted him land ( while still playing as his father ) , no pop-up . 
  because they think it sounds cool , mostly . 
  it does n't really make them legally any different from the other * l\u00e4nder * . 
  they just decided to use the historic german word for `` republic '' as their official name . 
  they are the only ones who do this because they are the only ones that already existed as republics at some point before they became part of modern germany . 
  most other * l\u00e4nder * could n't , because they never existed in their modern form historically , but are combinations of smaller historic territories . 
  ( e.g. 
  can somebody explain `` tick territory '' ? 
  i 'm german , and i do n't get it . 
  `` why is sachsen-anhalt the land of the early birds '' is somewhat funny . 
  a few years ago , they tried to find something that makes their * land * special . 
  unfortunately , st ( the offical abbreviaion ) is very boring , and they could n't find anything . 
  finally , they found a statistic saying that people in st get up a few minutes earlier than everybody else in germany . 
  that 's mostly because there are no jobs in st and many of them have a long commute to other * l\u00e4nder * , but it * sounds * like a good thing . 
  ok , that is actually more sad than funny . 
  thuringen and saxony both were republics ( `` freistaat '' ) during the weimar republic . 
  what 's wrong with the 1918 * freistaat bayern * ? 
  it was proclaimed by a socialist , yes . 
  but he ( kurt eisner ) was a peaceful democrat who organized elections and accepted his defeat in these elections - and was murdered right afterwards . 
  the communists had somewhat supported the * freistaat * when eisner was alive , but they rebelled against it after his death and proclaimed their own communist * r\u00e4terepublik * ( `` councils ' republic '' ) .
