  it is . 
  but using it in this context would have sounded slightly anachronistic to me , and i did n't want to risk a debate about wether it 's fair to call them that and associate them with the crimes of * the * soviet republic - crimes that mostly had n't even happened yet . 
  you think they shoud have gone through with churchill 's [ operation unthinkable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unthinkable ) ? 
  to be fair , it 's almost impossible * not * to be more clever than that .

  i was well aware of that . 
  of course . 
  always . 
   a ** free patch ** will be released alongside the expansion and it will contain a surprisingly hefty amount of content , ** including the entirety of the expanded map **, 
  you get the entire expanded map for free ? 
  that 's awesome ... 
  i do n't really know what steam workshops are good for , never played a game that had one ( that i was aware of ) . 
  can you explain why this is exciting ? 
  quite certain it 'll break . 
  strictly speaking , it 's a [ vocative ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vocative_case ) , the case used to address someone ( or something ) . 
  in german , this case is always identical to the nominative . 
  i think this means that it does n't really exist in german , although it seems to have [ left some traces . 
  ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vokativ#deutsch ), 
  reminds me of the [ dictionary of obscure sorrows . 
  ] ( http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/archive ), 
  they invented words such * anecdoche * - a conversation in which everyone is talking but nobody is listening - or * sonder * - the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own in which you might appear only once , as an extra sipping coffee in the background . 
   i never heard just one of those words . 
  of course not , they do n't exist ( yet ) , they are * proposed * new words . 
  i like the wordplay in * tageslichtspielschock * . 
  most of them do n't feel like they could really be german compounds , except for * eisenbahnscheinbewegung * - i knew exactly what that is before i read the explanation , and it makes sense to have a word for it . 
  `` idol chatter '' ( praying to a god you do n't believe in ) is so much better in english . 
  why are there so many aircrafts `` out of rotation '' ? 
  since planes only make money when they are in the air , i thought it was unusual for them to ever simply be idle on the ground . 
  damn , i 'm intrigued . 
  i thought the pope was hardcoded to * always * have the religion of ... well , * his * religion . 
  that would just make holding two different papacies impossible . 
  ... in australia . 
  to be fair , you started your comment with a passive-aggressive `` did you not read the conclusion '' ? 
  `` anti-vaxxer '' is a bit harsh . 
  what the article calls `` low-moderate consumption '' is roughly the * minimum * amount discussed in your `` conventional wisdom '' text . 
  83 g of alcohol per week is roughly 1 beer ( 0.25 l ) per day . 
  in your text , this amount is purely self-reported , and it 's well-known ( and seems obvious ) that women usually underreport the amount of alcohol they consume during pregnancy - especially women who 's children turn out to actually have birth-defects that might be alcohol-related . 
  susan astley seems almost surprised that one ( ! ), 
  of the  2,500 children with severe fasd that she treated had been exposed to `` just 1 beer per day for the first 4 months '' ( of pregnancy ) . 
  * just 1 beer per day * , self-reported , and that 's the lowest amount covered in your text - i know few women who drink more than that when they * are n't * pregnant . 
  this study was done in living mice . 
  for all it 's other weaknesses , that 's * in vivo * . 
  i think the more important difference usually is that you can simply kill the mice and slice their brain open . 
  there 's just too much paperwork when you want to do that with humans . 
  anyhow : reddit gets about one article per week of a treatment that cures one kind of cancer in mice . 
  most of them are never heard of again , because they do n't work in humans . 
  humans and other animals are similar , but there * are * significant differences . 
  that 's why putting the word `` mice '' in the title would be very helpful . 
  the pkk can/could rely on the support of millions of kurds in turkey . 
  how many friends do you think isis has in the country ? 
  hundreds ? 
  by `` the country '' , i meant turkey . 
  of course they have support in iraq and syria . 
  the [ illustrated guide to criminal law ] ( http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped ) explains this in some detail . 
  you were banned and then immediately went there ? 
  do n't you value your skin at all ? 
  lustful is seen as bad ? 
  i like everything that gives me fertility bonuses , i 'll take them small hit to piety ( ? ), 
  that goes with it . 
  same here . 
  i do n't like vdleyen and many of her ideas , but i think she will be a very effective minister of defense . 
  the most important skill is how to lead a large organization ; this does n't change much between two ministeries . 
   how many ceos of electronic companies have studied ee ? 
  how many ceos of pharmaceutical companies have studied chemistry , biology or pharmacology ? 
  for germany , i 'd say : about half . 
  maybe more . 
  i jsut randomly sampled a few of the big names in german industry and found e.g. 
  that the ceos ( or rough equivalents ) of [ bayer ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/marijn_dekkers ) , [ bosch ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkmar_denner ) , and [ daimler ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieter_zetsche ) are a chemist , a physicist , and an engineer , respectively . 
  [ links are to their german wiki pages . ], 
  i believe this has a better chance of being answered in / r/eli5 . 
  personally , i have no idea . 
  [ vastly generalizing men and women in this answer ... ], 
  i think a reason is that men in a way like thinking about violence , while women do n't . 
  if you never really think about violence , you 're not likely to buy a gun . 
  by `` thinking about violence '' , i do n't mean that men actually * are * violent in general . 
  but we are fascinated by war documentaries , first-person shooters , martial arts . 
  does n't matter much if this is a natural difference or ( partly ) a cultural one , it is a difference between men and women in america . 
  the ai stays as useless as it is . 
  in any battle on very hard , you need almost twice your opponents numbers , or your soldiers will run away . 
  to me , this ruins a lot of the fun of the game . 
  i think very few players play on settings other than `` normal '' . 
  i wish paradox would completely change the meaning of these difficulty settings . 
  it absolutely worked - it has a total of close to 0 . 
  sort comments in this thread by most controversial , and maebbie 's is the top comment . 
  to fix all your money problems , the usual recommendation is that you keep all barons/bishops/mayors in office . 
  whenever your money runs low , you arrest and banish some ( or all ) of them ( `` farming '' ) . 
  the only minor downside this really has is that you have only one court in your realm , so conversation of counties is slow and you have more uprisings than usual . 
  oh , and it 's boring . 
  and it 's very necessary , because i 'm still not sure i get it . 
  is the joke that the moral authority of catholicism is `` 666 '' , the number of the beast ? 
  because otherwise , 66 % moral authority is n't really all that bad . 
  nope , it 's only correct * without * the comma . 
  when you say `` where i live '' on reddit , it would be nice if you also told us * where that is * . 
  this is of course very different for men , but keep in mind that there 's a reason for this - it 's not only people being nasty sexists . 
  getting married and having kids is much easier for a woman in her twenties than for a woman in her late thirties . 
  for men , this is not true , and you might even say that the opposite is . 
  does `` gem\u00fctlich '' also exist in dutch ? 
  for anyone confused at what 's happening here : these are just germans using the normal german conversation volume . 
   at first , people do tell us to apologise .
