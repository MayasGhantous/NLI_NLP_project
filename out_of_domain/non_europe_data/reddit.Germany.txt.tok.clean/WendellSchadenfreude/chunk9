  side note about pregnancies that threaten the mother 's life : of course the embryo is still innocent !, 
  he 's not doing that * on purpose * , obviously . 
  [ must i really add that only fundamentalist idiots oppose a mother 's right to abort a pregnancy that is threatening her life ? 
  but supporting it simply has nothing to do with the belief that the embryo is `` guilty '' of anything . ], 
   maybe they do n't both want their customers to die , but manufacturer a certainly does n't care if they do . 
  exactly . 
  glad we can agree on this . 
  now , if he puts in some safety measures ( but only very basic ones ) , it seems he cares about his customers ' lifes * a little * . 
  if he makes relatively safe cars that could , at some expense , certainly be even safer , he does care quite a bit . 
  not as much as he could , but he does . 
  compare to death penalty : building cheap cars ( the thing you * want * to do ) is killing guilty people . 
  killing customers ( the thing that sometimes happens , even if you do n't really want it to ) is killing innocent people . 
  no safety measures at all - just execute everyone suspected of murder ( or similar crimes ) . 
  some basic safety measures - execute every convicted murderer . 
  very good safety measures - what the us have today . 
  an absolutely safe car can never be built - if you want to be 100 % sure not to ever execute an innocent person , you ca n't support the death penalty . 
  i still agree with bout_it that all this has nothing to do with abortion . 
  in an abortion , you 're not trying to distinguish between `` guilty '' and `` innocent '' fetuses . 
  you 're trying to distinguish between people and not-people . 
  finding dumb people who hold views that are opposed to yours does n't make your views correct . 
  i do n't agree with joe walsh . 
  granting for the purpose of the argument that fetuses are people , and further granting that * if * they are people , they certainly are * innocent * people , supporting abortion would be like supporting the death penalty even for people whom *** you know to be innocent *** . 
   but these are the people who are writing laws in support of your position . 
  you do n't even * know * my position . 
  i merely supported bout_it 's assessment that there is no ( necessary ) contradiction in being both pro-life and a supporter of the death penalty . 
  there are no laws supporting * that * position . 
  health care is not quasi-related , it 's completely unrelated . 
  i 'm not interested in a discussion of that topic . 
  [ i 'm interested in remarking that it 's a sad consequence of the extreme polarization of american politics that many unrelated positions are often clustered together . 
  if you know a person 's stand on abortion , you usually know their stand on health care , gun control , and affirmative action as well . 
  but that does n't mean these topics are closely related . ], 
  i 'm not an expert , but i 'm pretty sure a two-year old who accidentally kills someone would not be convicted of manslaughter or anything else . 
  there is no intention , there is no [ `` guilty mind '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mens_rea ) . 
  be careful with your arguments : if you assert a fetus to be capable of * guilt * , it becomes very hard to argue that he is not a person . 
  anyway , that 's it for me for today . 
  if you post a reply , i 'm likely still going to read it , but i do n't think i 'll post any further comments on this topic . 
  it 's been fun talking to you . 
  i just wanted to write that i was sorry i could n't help , but then i stumbled into [ this site ] ( https://maps.google.de/maps/ms?gl=de&amp;ie=utf8&amp;oe=utf8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100786430830544911234.0004435ca137f046de78c ) . 
  detailed 3-day plan for discovering berlin . 
  the funny thing about `` gn\u00e4dige '' is that it 's usually simply pronounced as `` gn\u00e4 ' '' , as if the '' - dige '' just was n't there . 
  [ ok , maybe i should be using the past tense here . 
  germans stopped saying `` gn\u00e4dige frau '' around the 1960s . 
  but until then , they actually said `` gn\u00e4 ' frau '' / `` gn\u00e4 ' fr\u00e4ulein '' . ), 
  an american friend of mine could n't stop laughing when he first saw a sparkasse . 
  does that count ? 
  i ` ver never been to a brothel or a prostitute , so i do n't know much about how their situation in germany actually is . 
  [ well , obviously , i ca n't prove this if you do n't believe me . 
  and if i did go to prostitutes , i guess i would n't admit it on the internet . ], 
  that being said , i feel quite enthusiastic about the legality of prostitution . 
  prostitution exists in every country in the world ( very likely even the vatican ) , but it 's certainly most dangerous ( for everybody involved ) in countries such as saudi-arabia , where it is most severely punished . 
  in germany , prostitutes can simply call the police if one of their `` customers '' refuses to pay or becomes threatening in any way . 
  they can even get health insurane and old-age pensions . 
  i do n't think this is actually a majority position in germany , but if i were asked , i 'd definitely advise every country to legalize prostitution . 
  ( about the majority : this is a total non-issue in germany , it 's never discussed ; so i have no idea what most germans think about it . ), 
  now , about the `` customers '' ... ( is `` johns '' the right word ? ), 
  i do n't really have a clear opinion about them . 
  if all i know about a guy was that he regularly visits a prostitute , i 'd picture a fat 50 year-old construction worker . 
  does n't get much action at home , does n't have a chance to score with other women , thus pays to have some fun . 
  clearly not someone i 'd have a lot of respect for , but i would n't see him as a bad person either . 
  i do n't think this stereotype exists in germany . 
  it 's not like brothels are actually called `` brothel '' , but they are n't disguised as saunas . 
  i still agree with you . 
  it 's a term that does n't make any sense scientifically . 
  the question was wether it is * incorrect * ; so i 'm guessing by `` yes '' you meant `` no '' . 
  at the very least , it `` be able * to * '' . 
  do you even need to make the sentence so formal ? 
  `` jim will be able to tell you when the computer is going to be moved . '', 
  - too casual for your purpose ? 
  when ned made his promise , rhaegar was already dead - how did he cooperate with him ? 
  dortmund ( the current german champion ) was in a group with the current english champion , the current spanish champion , and the current dutch champion . 
  in a group like that , you ca n't simply * expect * anything . 
  the refutation , at first glance , seems quite nonsensical . 
   we may feel confident that by the year 2000 the total number, 
  of the damned will be at least 29,422,641,251,519,917,000 souls . 
  29 * billion billion * souls ? 
  no way !, 
  the total number of all humans ever born might be ~ 100 billion . 
  even adding all fertilized human egg cells ( assuming they all got their respective souls at the moment of conception * and * also assuming that those poor souls all went to hell ) wo n't get you anywhere close to 290 billion . 
  using that number , their estimate is off by a factor of 100 million . 
   ( fangen means to catch something . 
  a ball in the air , a fish in a net etc. 
  it has to be something difficult to obtain . 
  moss , sticks and stones do n't run away ! ), 
  i 'm gueesing he meant `` start with ... '' - `` fangt * an * mit ... '' . 
  only the `` an '' is missing . 
  or better yet :, 
  ~ ~ sounds ok . more natural : ~ ~ ( edit : kleinergruenerkaktus is right : if you want to use `` zuf\u00fcgen '' , one `` zu '' is missing from the sentence . 
  i did n't notice that at first . ), 
  of course , germans still will have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  to answer only the question about the imperatives : those are just fine . 
   a stock also is a larger twig , without any implications of a tool . 
  i was at first really surprised at peoplewithoutmatches ' claim that a `` stock '' is always some sort of tool ; i had never thought of it like that . 
  but really , i think he is right . 
  a `` stock '' is * not * a part of a ( living ) plant , it 's a piece of wood that at least * potentially * is a tool . 
  great video !, 
  wikipedia has at least one exception :, 
  but * that * point is totally boring . 
  is there a reason you are asking for * one * country instead of `` countries '' ? 
  that sounds unusual ... 
  gut feeling :,
