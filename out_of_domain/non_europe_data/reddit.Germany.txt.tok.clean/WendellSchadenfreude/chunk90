  do they ? 
  i 'm german , i have lots of international friends , and this never happened to me . 
  and i absolutely would have a problem apologizing . 
  * if * somebody told me to , i 'd probably just be dumbfounded because this is such a ridiculous demand . 
  me neither , and i 'm german . 
   in his treatment of slavery in the american south in * democracy in america * , alexis de tocqueville contrasts modern with ancient slavery . 
  while ancient slavery , he wrote , typically aimed to constrain only the body -- to force the enslaved into servile work -- modern slavery aims to entrap the mind . 
  it `` overturns the order of nature , '' constituting what tocqueville chillingly called `` spiritualized despotism and violence . '', 
  is that what you 're talking about ? 
  associationg them with the nazis is exactly how i would mock germans if i were a non-german . 
  but that does n't mean that people who do that want you to apologize for hitler . 
  i seriously hope that when people mocked you as `` hitler 's cousin '' , you did n't reply with `` i 'm so sorry for what hitler did . '', 
  relevant xkcd : [ strip games ] ( http://xkcd.com/696/ ), 
  a `` work around '' for that would likely have meant hundreds of hours of work for mediocre results . 
  ( fixing all these provinces , adding thousands of characters with all their lands and armies , into a running game ? 
  nope , that 's * not * easy . ), 
  since they will offer the old version of the game , i do n't see a problem . 
  but these irish servants were n't considered property . 
  even * if * they were possibly treated the same as black slaves ( as visible to an external observer ) , their * children * were n't . 
  a slave 's children were slaves , a white servant 's children were poor , but free . 
  it 's not `` psychobabble '' to use different names for phenomena that actually * were * different . 
  that 's because of karl may 's stories about winnetou . 
   when someone tastes `` rotting banana '' there may actually be the molecule for that in the drink, 
  as a chemist , i just want to make sure nobody takes this too literal : there may actually be a few billion molecules for that in the drink . 
  ( that 's still next to nothing . ), 
  i do n't care about the winter olympics , neither online nor on tv . 
  can i get my money back ? 
   you get the whole package or nothing . 
  you * get * the whole package . 
  not `` or nothing '' . 
  if i had * that * choice , i would opt out . 
  damn , you 're right . 
  i thought tokyo was part of the light blue area , but it 's actually purple ... 
  this is a very good explanation , except for the nonchalance with which you mention that a child might just have ** an extra finger ** . 
  that 's not something we just sometimes oberserve without giving it much thought . 
  even in evolutionary terms , * extra fingers * do n't just happen from time to time . 
  [ ** whales ** still have 5 fingers ] ( http://www.whalesongs.org/cetacean/sperm_whales/sperm_finger.gif ) , not four or six . 
  i think you should replace that part of your explanation with something else . 
  children can be hairier than their parents , or weaker , or smarter , they can have lighter skin , bigger noses or stronger bones - but as a good rule of thumb ( no pun intended ) , they will have the same number of fingers . 
  you almost sound like krushchew , `` gagarin flew into space , but did n't see any god there . '', 
  you do n't see heracles around because [ he died ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heracles#death ) and was called to olympus by his father . 
  zeus has n't been proven to not exist . 
  it 's only clear that he 's not simply a tall man living on mount olympus - i 'm not sure if even the ancient greeks ever really believed * that * . 
  but even if this were true for zeus , the force has not been proven to not exist . 
  i 'm sure that the force is `` beyond our understanding '' , but i still do n't believe that it 's * real * . 
  i think i 'd only ever say `` ich hab dich lieb '' in a relationship where i feel like it 's too soon to * actually * say `` i love you '' , but i * almost * want to say it . 
  i 'm not sure if people still do this , but for a while `` hdl '' ( `` hab dich lieb '' ) was used by some silly people to end text messages to their `` besties '' . 
  do most americans actually know reddit ? 
  if you mentioned to a fourty year-old colleague that you read something `` on reddit '' , would you expect them to know what you are talking about ? 
  in germany : nope . 
  i 'm in my late twenties , and i do n't know any other redditors . 
  even my geeky friends only know that it 's a website that i visit , but they do n't use it themselves . 
  ] ( http://www.bundessortenamt.de/internet30/fileadmin/files/pdf/bsl_getreide_2013.pdf ) seiten 148-184 . 
  just checked . 
  it looked good ; i still dis - and reconnected all cables . 
  let 's hope that helped ; i 'll be back in an hour or so . 
  nope , that was n't it . 
  screen froze again , and upon restart i get `` reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key '' . 
  switch off , switch on , boots like normal . 
  what 's an `` ironman '' ? 
  i 'd google it , but i guess the results would n't be very helpful ... 
  you might want to look up both spelling and meaning of this word . 
  : excessive or blind patriotism -- compare jingoism, 
  : undue partiality or attachment to a group or place to which one belongs or has belonged, 
  : an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex ; also : behavior expressive of such an attitude, 
  no , this never happens . 
  most germans will also say `` england '' when talking about the uk or great britain , just as we usually call the netherlands `` holland '' . 
  but no german * land * is ever used to refer to all of germany . 
  being rude does n't make you right . 
  had you asked anyone ( even in kansas ) in 1859 , `` when did this civil war start ? '', 
  - they would just have stared at you wondering what you were talking about . 
  had you asked anyone in 1862 , they would have started talking about fort sumter . 
  do you know if there was any official interaction between the two ? 
   how the situation was in iraq under saddam , whether there were shia ministers, 
  i do n't see that anybody already replied to this , so i will : there were shia ministers , the most prominent example being the guy who later became known as [ `` comical ali '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhammad_saeed_al-sahhaf ) . 
  there also was at least one [ christian minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tariq_aziz ) . 
  they win far too often . 
  i find this very annoying , because crusader states are boring . 
  well , * this * had to happen . 
  when one of your vassals * inherits * a title from outside the realm that 's higher than their current title , they always leave the realm . 
  i do n't think crown authority even matters in this case . 
  ( high ca prevents counties from leaving your realm through the death of their current holder . 
  also , the rules are very different for pressed claims . ), 
  this is weird . 
  did this happen when you pressed your claims , or did the war become invalid ? 
  ( i 'm thinking that maybe she converted or inherited the title and thus made your war invalid . 
  although i do n't think that 's what 's supposed to happen . ), 
  could you eli5 this for me ? 
  [ non-american , if that matters . ], 
  she 's actually spelled michelle , with two l 's . 
  that 's how to tell them apart . 
  attempt # 28 or something ? 
  the human body had to put up with the human * brain * for millions of years . 
  poor body has seen all kinds of intense shit . 
   achieved a warscore of 100 on 27th april ** 2070 ** . 
  talk about a war of attrition . 
  did you finally win when you could employ hovertanks ? 
  regular . 
  obviously . 
  because it sounds like you do n't understand what the map shows .
