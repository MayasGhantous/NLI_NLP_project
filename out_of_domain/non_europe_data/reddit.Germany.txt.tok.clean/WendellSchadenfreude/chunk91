  the orange areas are * not * the places where the richest 25 % of americans live . 
  ( some of them are , of course , but that 's not what the map is concerned with . ), 
  the map shows which of the strongest economic centers you have to combine to reach 25 % of the entire nation 's gdp . 
  if you want the top 1 % , you could e.g.

  when christians win a crusade and there are christian claimants to the title , they always get the land , no matter who contributed what . 
  there rarely are norse claimants , and i 'm not sure if the mechanism is supposed to be in place . 
  maybe it 's not , and that 's why it bugged and gave her the land , but did n't make her independent ( as it would have if this had been a christian crusade ) . 
  or did she possibly already hold other titles as a vassal of the umayyads , * before * getting aquitaine ? 
  ( in that case , i 'm not even sure what would habppen in a crusade . ), 
  yes , except that most of them are n't `` moderate '' themselves . 
  jan is officially al-quaeda , so they fighting isis is basically aq fighting aq . 
  ahrar al-sham is n't aq , but they are far from being `` moderates '' . 
  some other members of the islamic front might be called moderates if you are very generous with the term .

   once upon a time , it was considered the height of aristocratic manners when one was dining , to go about asking someone to pass you something , by engaging in this simple dialogue ;, 
   ` henry , would you like more chicken ? ', 
   ` no , arthur , but would you like more chicken ? ', 
   ` yes , i would henry . ', 
   ` then i shall pass it to you . ', 
  i love this . 
  it would drive me insane , but it 's just so smooth and aristocratic . 
  i think it can be interpreted to be compatible . 
  but it was n't . 
  before science found out about evolution , there was no way to understand genesis correctly . 
  so the bible was clearly written in a way that * had to * give people completely wrong ideas for almost 2,000 years . 
  if we completely misunderstood * that part * of the bible , might we not be misunderstanding other parts as well ? 
  like the sermon on the mount , or * all * the stories about jesus ? 
  - if all of them might also mean the opposite of what used to be read into them , your only sensible course is to completely disregard the bible and think for yourself about what is good and what is bad .

  workers in the german metalworking industry and some other industrial sectors do have a 35 hour work week - most other people do n't . 
  government employees for instance have 40 hour weeks in most parts of germany . 
  i believe 35 hour work weeks were a bit more widespread in germany in the 1990 's , but it seems that did n't work out too well for the german economy . 
  edit : this [ statistics homepage ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/75864/umfrage/durchschnittliche-wochenarbeitszeit-in-den-laendern-der-eu/ ) [ german ] claims that german full-time employees work 41.9 hours per week on average , with 41.6 hours being the eu average .

  [ relevant xkcd : the general problem .

  it 's * good * that this succession law makes their games a little more challenging . 
  some people claim that in gvlkd you should simply kill all your sons except one , or never have more than one son to begin with . 
  ( marry an old woman , take concubines until you have one son , then set all of them aside . ), 
  - i do n't like this method , because it means you can easily lose the game if one character randomly dies , which happens all the time . 
  so what you should do instead is * prepare * for your own death . 
  have strong retinues ( i hope you have lor ) , save money for mercenaries or new titles ( to be created and handed out on the first day playing as your new ruler ) , imprison one or two dangerous vassals while the long reign bonus will still keep everybody else in line . 
  i think you should also have given all of your sons some land - you gave all your younger sons barony level titles . 
  if you give them newly conquered ( e.g. 
  irish ) provinces , these provinces count toward their inheritance - they will get fewer of your scottish core provinces . 
  this way , you can give them many titles , and they still wo n't be able to raise many troops , because all their land is newly conquered , wrong culture + religion . 
  also , once you 've formed your kingdom , your next goal should be reforming your faith and getting out of gavelkind . 
  during the ( northern ) summer - it 's night there .

  rajas will massively change how abyssinia is played .

  you 're boxed in by the muslims , have few available mercenaries , and no access to the sea .

  i thought the child would still get the culture/religion of their primary parent ( the mother if the parents are married matrilineally , the father otherwise ) .

  the most important consequence of this change might actually be that you can no longer pick off a neighbor 's rebelling vassals one by one . 
  in many cases , this was the fastest method of expansion and a major advantage the player had over the ai . 
  the ai is horrible at it . 
  as a player , if you find yourself next to a strong empire , you wait for a faction in that empire to fire . 
  you then declare war in all of the rebels anywhere close to you - five , six wars at the same time . 
  the ai never does that , but it 's a low-risk , high-reward move . 
  i have no idea . 
  only thing i can tell you : as long as there still are catholics around , one of them will likely grant the pope a church very soon .

  berlin , by a large margin .

  food ca n't be much cheaper in the ruhrgebiet than it is anywhere else in germany , and housing does n't really matter when you are on hartz iv : rent [ as long as your place is `` reasonable '' ( * angemessen * ) ] is paid directly to your landlord by the government , you ca n't keep anything to yourself just because your place is extra-cheap .
