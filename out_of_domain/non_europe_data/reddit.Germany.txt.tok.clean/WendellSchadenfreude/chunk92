  it `` counts as a currency '' because there are people who use it as one . 
  if enough people decide to accept oreo cookies in exchange for goods and services , oreos also can be counted as a currency . 
  bitcoins as a currency have the advantage of being scarce , hard to forge , and easily transferable around the globe . 
   also , it 's 10 minutes for each and every transaction , no matter how big or how far . 
  imagine buying a coffee to go and waiting 10 minutes on the counter waiting for your transaction to go through . 
  no need to imagine , there are already [ places where you can do that ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/26/bitcoins-gain-currency-in-berlin ) . 
  except you do n't really have to wait for 10 minutes , there are faster methods of using bitcoin . 
   there is n't a mountain range on mars which looks like a qr code that spells out `` mars '' over and over . 
  there might be , we just have n't found it yet . 
  it 's famously known as russell 's qr code . 
  just dress up as x and y. 
  or you could go as death and one of his friends . 
  or both simply dress up as ghosts . 
  oh wait - you meant cosplay , not coldplay , right ? 
  to give some actual numbers for this :, 
  the average man from hamburg is 10.8 centimeters ( 4.25 inches ) taller than the average man from thuringia . 
  [ source , pdf ] ( http://www.menshealth.de/sixcms/media.php/37/mens_health_fettatlas_2008.pdf ) - i would n't have thought that the difference is that big . 
  ( to be fair , hamburg and turingia are the two most extreme * l\u00e4nder * in this statistic . ), 
  let 's start with learning some english : you 're trying to * immerse * ( not * emerge * ) yourself . 
  popular american song translated into german in 1861 : [ das star-spangled banner ] ( http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.rbc.as.113160/enlarge.html?page=1&amp;section=&amp;size=1024&amp;from=pageturner ) . 
  - i 'm not even kidding !, 
  although the german is a little old-fashioned , of course . 
  there 's a german version of `` for olde long syne '' , [ `` nehmt abschied , br\u00fcder '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqymvgytqnu ) . 
  [ [ modernized version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbuqo2unsoq ) ] - would songs like this be what you 're looking for ? 
  there are many old songs that exist in english and german versions - they usually are n't really `` translations '' though , so i 'm not sure if you 're interested at all . 
  more humorous : a capella german version of brtiney spears : wise guys - [ `` schlag mich , baby , noch einmal '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qalgt1pnc7y ), 
  the west has done nothing whatsoever against russia in the past 20 years . 
  and do n't get me wrong : that 's a good thing . 
  but your claim that the west has been `` fucking russia over '' is a ridiculous lie . 
  making sure that poland , estonia , latvia , and other eastern - / central-european countries do n't have to fear russian intervention is not `` driving russia into a corner '' - we 're not meddling in russian affairs , we are at best trying to stop them from meddling in other nations ' affairs . 
  gysi is a smart man and a convinving speaker . 
  listening to him , you 'll often think that he 's making good points - and i say that as someone who disagrees with gysi on almost anything . 
  but no , he does not represent the average german . 
  certainly not in general , and not in this matter either . 
  do n't worry , that was pretty good . 
  so what you 're saying is that the west `` fucked russia over '' by giving them loans to support their transition to a market economy . 
  of course this transition did n't work very well . 
  communist economies that are forced to compete with * real * economies crash badly . 
  this also happened in eastern germany , and we did n't try to fuck * them * over ( either ) . 
  no country was forced to join nato , they all * wanted to * . 
  russia is n't affected by this at all . 
  ( yeah , sure : russia * is * affected by this as it reduces their ability to bully these countries . 
  i 'm not accusing the russians of * wanting * to do that ; but they certainly have no right to it , whether they want to or not . ), 
   again i ask you , why does nato need more and more bases closer and closer to russia if by all standards it is more than contained and outclassed on every front ? 
  easy : because russia 's neighbours feel threatened and * ask * for these bases . 
  and right now , russia is giving them ample reason to feel threatened . 
  so did you even really notice at the time that this was weird , or did you only realize that later ? 
  ( also , how old were you , roughly ? ), 
  i 'm so glad that does n't really exist . 
  i 've never known anyone like that either , but i think my friends ' houses are just too small for it . 
  if i had two living rooms , i 'd do exactly that . 
  does n't sound like bad parenting at all . 
  [ landj\u00e4ger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landj%c3%a4ger ) have a `` mixture of things inside the tube '' , they certainly are sausages , and they are usually eaten raw as a snack . 
  i 'm european , and i would find this weird . 
  to be fair , i find having a private pool at your house weirder than walking around your house naked after using your private pool . 
  but the latter is * also * weird , especially when you have guests over . 
   blocked `` north korea mode '' ; you now lose huge parts of all income and levies if your demesne is too big, 
  what does `` too big '' mean in this context ? 
  say you have 4 provinces and your demesne limit is 3 , how big will the penalty be ? 
   children can no longer pick up the religion or culture of a guardian if the guardian does not share the religion or culture of his employer, 
  so i can no longer change my religion/culture by having my heir educated by a foreigner in my court ? 
   characters now lose the ambition to get married upon becoming eunuchs or homosexual, 
  so homosexual now becomes a really horrible trait , instead of the slight nuisance it used to be ? 
   added a prisoner age check to event 50010, 
  that 's the `` torture a prisoner '' event - no more torturing infants . 
  oh ... thanks . 
  you got as long as you want , you do n't have to patch . 
  they already said that 2.0 will still be available . 
  what will you be studying ? 
  do you speak any german ? 
  this is the most depressing thing i 've read all year . 
  and the second and third most depressing thing as well . 
  good writing . 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  i just have to look around my apartment , and i 'm happy because everything is so * clean * . 
  ( it is n't , strictly speaking , but by comparison it makes me feel good . ), 
  core of the game is the dynastic feudal system , holy orders do n't have that . 
  their rulers have no relevant younger brothers , there are no claimants on their titles , they do n't even have to deal with insubordinate vasalls . 
  as a christian ruler who wants to take over that * knights templar hungary * , you basically have no option but an endless series of claims wars ( usually fabricated claims ) for one single county . 
  german scientists were * more * advanced ( relative to other countries ) * before * the rise of the nazis . 
  as a very rough measure , the nobel prizes to germans from 1901 until the nazi rise to power in 1933 :, 
  in physics : 1901 ( r\u00f6ntgen ) , 1905 , 1909 , 1911 , 1914 , 1918 ( planck ) , 1919 , 1921 ( einstein ) , 1925 , 1932 ( heisenberg ) . 
  in chemistry : 1902 , 1905 , 1907 , 1909 , 1910 , 1915 , 1920 , 1925 , 1927 , 1928 , 1930 , 1931 . 
  the nazis do n't deserve much credit for advanced technology , if any . 
  do that for a few months . 
  then actually decapitate your neighbor , put his head in a jar . 
  perfect crime . 
  because if you have to make up a name for a plumber on the spot , it 's always mario !, 
  your username will never be more relevant . 
   the scariest part of some walls are the currents that might run against them . 
  up or down ? 
  nothing . 
  nightmares . 
  do n't think about it . 
  that picture makes blue whales just looks ridiculous . 
  you call that `` diving '' , big guy ? 
  you are * barely * submerged in water - you still got 99 % of the way to go . 
  i 'm floating at the surface , and so are you , basically !, 
  so that 's what that is ... 
  i only knew [ this picture ] ( http://cfile214.uf.daum.net/image/1567563f4d6a46921b703f ) with the caption `` this is what happens when you divide by zero ! '',
