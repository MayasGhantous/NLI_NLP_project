  well , yeah ? 
  currents pushing you to the surface do n't seem so scary . 
  that actually sounds like fun . 
  currents pulling you into a bottomless black abyss - no thanks !, 
  even if it were technologically feasible right now , why would anyone do that ? 
  what 's there to mine for in asteroids that you could n't find on earth for a fraction of the cost ? 
  even if you found asteroids that consisted entirely of gold , platinum , and rare earth metals - i do n't see this ever being worth it . 
  the only context in which asteroid mining makes sense seems to be far more advanced space travel , where you want to mine the materials to build spacecrafts already in space , so you do n't have to lift them out of earth 's gravitational well first . 
  i hope your degree is a master 's degree ( or equivalent ) ; otherwise finding a phd program ( `` promotionsstelle '' ) will probably be difficult . 
  wrong !, 
  correctness is part of the fun !, 
  ( btw , beginning a comment with `` wrong ! '', 
  is n't impolite in german . 
  we 're just * that * honest . ), 
  except yes they are , and fuck you for playing dumb . 
  - pardon my french . 
   look at ksa and israel recently, 
  i must have missed that - where did they cooperate ? 
  very good and comprehensive post . 
   i 'm not completly sure how much of local touch i put into the two last ideas , but that 's how we talk down here in southern germany . 
  some input on this question : the third variant ( brandon seine jacke ) has me involuntarily shaking with disgust every time i read it . 
  i know what it means , and i know it 's correct in some dialects , but it sounds horrible in my ears . 
  even worse when people use it with the article : `` dem brandon seine liegt auf dem sofa und der gabi ihre h\u00e4ngt im gang . '', 
  this one does n't work . 
  '' ... damit ich die nachbarin ausziehen sehen kann '' does work , but it means that you watch her moving out , not getting undressed . 
  watching the neighbour get naked might work as `` damit ich die nachbarin sich ausziehen sehen kann '' - but that sounds quite complicated to me , i 'd rather avoid this constrcution here . 
  sounds more natural . 
  it sucks , but it 's really not censorship . 
  saarbr\u00fccken is smaller than kiel . 
  i love this answer . 
  question about one detail : how would you translate `` socialism '' in your post to german ? 
  `` someone who ca n't win '' ? 
  should i maybe just chose the most powerful vasall who is not of my dynasty ? 
  so if i 'm a king , would that result in that guy getting my kingdom , while my sons get all duchies and counties ? 
  ( who gets the capital county ? ), 
  fair point . 
  i still think you should have added [ iraq ] or something to the title . 
  it 's unusual to refer to the iraqi government as the `` regime '' , the tweet is quite confusing because of this . 
  i find it strange that you chose not to separate * mit * and * spielen * . 
  `` jemandem mitspielen '' exists , but it mostly means `` playing tricks on someone '' - i would n't us it for `` play with someone '' . 
  the sentence sounds much more natural to me like this :, 
  i would n't be so strict . 
  `` worten mitspielen '' is a nice wordplay itself . 
  i ca n't believe nobody else is bothered by this . 
  i was shure something like this was going to be the top comment . 
  for those who do n't get it :, 
  it 's `` till death do ** us ** part '' , or `` till death us do part '' - not ~ ~ `` till death do we part '' ~ ~ , which does n't make any sense . 
  i love it . 
  can i get the template ? 
  relevant xkcd ... oh , wait - i think there is n't one . 
  [ this one ] ( https://xkcd.com/773/ ) is related , but it 's about university pages , not restaurants . 
  it 's difficult to break through the muslim lines as abyssinia . 
  i call it the `` out of africa '' problem . 
  i really liked this about playing abyssinia . 
  minor point about the duchies : why would creating duchies put you at risk of claimant wars ? 
  just hand them out to content vasalls of your culture and religion who do n't have any claims on your titles . 
  i only realized in my african playthrough that the mercenaries you can hire seem to be determined partly by the location of your capital . 
  i moved it to jerusalem at some point , and from that moment on , i could hire several additional companies . 
  - maybe moving it to egypt is enough to get some more ? 
  just snatch one county in the delta , move your capital there and hope that you can get enough mercenaries to stop the muslim response . 
  i find the nazis have some comical potential . 
  i still downvoted his `` joke '' . 
  if you get a chance , you should actually offer to take her to church at least once . 
  church in america is so different from germany , it 's certainly interesting for a visitor . 
  i 'm sorry to ask , but i seriously ca n't tell if this is just satire or reality : your great uncle was in prison until ~ 1990 for transporting beer ? 
  did he ever try to get a pardon ? 
  this is the funniest `` redditor 's wife '' i 've seen in months . 
  i agree . 
  absolutely ricdolious . 
  well written story . 
  not realistic under any circumstances , of course . 
  even if the entire atmosphere was poisoned , oxygen could easily be generated from water . 
  it 's not cheap , but certainly cheaper and easier than searching for old plastic bottles . 
  i still ca n't tell if you 're writting some absurd dystopian short story , or talking about things that actually happened in america in the real world . 
  the past just seems like a horrible place , even this not so distant past . 
   with the cables attached , the dead car will not have the power from both batteries to start , which should work , unless the dead car 's battery was really super dead . 
  it will not ? 
  did you maybe mean to write `` it will * now * '' - otherwise , this sentence does n't seem to make sense . 
  ( i really appreciate this detailed explanation , btw . ), 
  your messages are probably crap . 
  i 'm intrigued by this message . 
  want to meet sometime ? 
  maybe at your place , tonight ? 
  i think there were several amas by people who were in prison for years . 
  one `` prison survival advice '' that they seem to agree on is that you 1 ) do n't really talk about what you 're in for and 2 ) do n't tell * anyone * you 're getting released until you 're actually getting released . 
  also , do n't stay in contact with the other inmates once you 're out . 
  in that case , since you already know how to take off , you probably know how to land as well . 
  never thought about that ... if you are a christian ruler , but some of your land is jewish , * can * you still expel the jews ? 
  does it have any special effects ? 
  [ fun fact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_phonetic_alphabet ) : because the english `` nine '' and the german `` nein '' ( = `` no '' ) sound so similar , the number is called `` niner '' in aviation , radiocommunication , the military , etc. 
  ... we germans are also the reason `` three '' is called `` tree '' . 
  i find that very thoughtful of you guys , changing your numbers to make things easier for us . 
   reasons for the dead ends may be because this part of deutschland might have been part of denmark at the time . 
  strictly speaking , it probably was n't a part of denmark , but a state of the german confederation that happened to be ruled by a foreigner , the king of denmark . 
  in any case , it was probably governed from kopenhagen . 
  documents from that time might still exist in the [ deutsche kanzlei ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_kanzlei_%28kopenhagen%29 ) in kopenhagen , or in the [ archive of schleswig-holstein ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/landesarchiv_schleswig-holstein ) [ both links to german wikipedia ] , although i doubt that they kept the kind of population data that you would be interested in . 
  i agree with / u/ocbienroule that the heimatmuseum is your best bet . 
  you can probably contact them in english ; but let me know if you want anything translated . 
  i love it . 
  i will not combine it with the jain challenge , but i think i will give this a try .
