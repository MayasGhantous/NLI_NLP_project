  help me out here : how do i bet manage to switch religions repeatedly , without switching cultures as well ? 
  since courtiers will no longer be able to convert children except to their `` employer 's '' culture & religion , this sounds like the most difficult part . 
  the switch to one of the book religions is easy , as long as you are a pagan - but how do i get back out of it ? 
  many players think that ireland is the most boring place to start . 
  it 's considered `` easy '' because ( in the 1066 start at least ) there are no big powers around that could crush you early on . 
  still , i never liked playing there . 
  if you want more action as a christian ruler , start in spain . 
  if you lose early on , just start a new game . 
  also , i guarantee that there are many cool events that you have n't seen yet . 
  legally , the taxpayer would have to pay for all this in germany because of a commitment from the 1960 's , when all parties in germany supported nuclear energy . 
  now that all parties are somewhat against it , they will probably make the energy companies pay to some extent ; but there really is no legal basis for it . 
  the government needs a storage facility for the waste from research reactors anyway . 
  i think we have a similar rule about pollutants . 
  but when the state wanted private companies to build nuclear power plants , it was guaranteed that the waste disposal would be paid for by the government . 
  pacta sunt servanda , the state ca n't retroactively abandon this promise . 
  ( well , `` ca n't '' - they will , to an extent . ), 
  of course it would be far less waste ; but why should that matter much . 
  the storage facilities in discussion are old mines , they are easily big enough to store everything . 
  it 's not like upkeep doubles when you have twice the waste in the same old mine . 
  i 'm the former home-school tutor of the schnakenburg family . 
   france was totally destroyed . 
  some regions in the far east and north of france were . 
  `` france '' was not `` totally destroyed '' by any means . 
  yeah , but first i need to find a court where they have your culture , but a foreign religion . 
  the opposite would be relatively easy - you just convert some pagans , and they are your religion but a foreign culture . 
  but how do i make foreign lands accept my culture , but not my religion ? 
  because of this :, 
   +1 point if you keep your home culture the entire game, 
  also , it sounds like extra fun that way - everywhere you go , always take your culture with you . 
  thank you for your request concerning your family ' geneology ( bcl fick etc. ), 
  we will have a meeting at our museum next week and discuss how we can best help you . 
  in order to do this , we require some additional information about your family , e.g. 
  where did the great grandfather live ? 
  even small clues can be important for us to improve our research . 
  there also is an option of researching at a church archive in another place * . 
  they have records of almost all ahrensb\u00f6k citizens born before ~ 1880 . 
  two more questions : are you asking from abroad or from germany ? 
  how did you find out about us ? 
  best regards ,, 
  gb ha, 
  * this part sounds a bit strange . 
  she does n't specify what this `` other place '' with the church archive might be . 
  i 'm guessing it 's be the landesarchiv i mentioned earlier , but i might be way off . 
  that 's a much better homepage than i would have expected from the `` kirchenkreis ostholstein '' . 
  so the relevant part : the `` other place '' would be gleschendorf , the next village . 
  they can give op information , they need a complete postal adress for that , and it 's not for free ( although no `` prices '' are given ) . 
   the point is that the generic masculine can not be defined as gender-neutral, 
   you can see in the ~ ~ left ~ ~ right . 
  from the article :, 
   when microsoft discovered the image through corbis , because it had been scanned into its archives at a low resolution , the agency flew o'rear to their headquarters to get a better scan . 
   `` corbis said , ` please send us that original ' . 
  so we called the federal express [ fedex ] ... and they said how much they would insure that photograph for and i said ` well i do n't think that 's enough ' . 
  so microsoft then said through corbis ` here 's a plane ticket , bring us that image and hand it to us , it 's too valuable ' . 
  after paying for his plane ticket , i guess they paid a little more than $ 100 for the photo . 
  does n't really matter if it was $ 1,000 or $ 10,000 or even more than that - it was a good deal for one image in any case .

  some people remarked on how the faceless men might punish arya for killing people from her own list . 
  i think this is not going to happen , because she can claim that raff * asked for it * . 
  right before she kills him , she makes him say `` her name '' :, 
   `` mercy , '' she said . 
  `` my name is mercy . 
  can you say it ? '', 
   `` mercy , '' he said . 
  `` my name is raff . '', 
  she can now * truthfully * tell the faceless men that the last thing raff said before she cut his artery was `` mercy . 
  my name is raff . '', 
  what izembaro means is `` we , all of us who work at this theater , will not disappoint the envoy . '', 
  the snapper makes a joke out of it by pretending that he might just have used the majestic plural `` we , the great izembaro , the first of our name , king of the mummers , the bravos , and the gutter rats , and protector of the harbor , ... will not disappoint ... '', 
  you have a bit more info on that ? 
  i never heard of german ( or german-american ) spies in america . 
   just so we 're clear , does this coincide with arya being acquainted with the gift of mercy \u00e0 la sandor ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand what you 're asking , so maybe this is n't the answer you were hoping for . 
  when sandor gave that one piper soldier the gift of mercy ( after the red wedding ) , arya was with him . 
  it still stands out to me that arya wants him to say `` her name '' before she kills him . 
  giving the gift of mery to people who ask for it is the very heart of the faceless men philosophy . 
  killing for money came only later . 
  `` kaufe lokal '' - strategien verbannen - so ein quatsch . 
  the faceless men started by giving the gift of mercy to slaves who simply * really * wanted it - nobody paid for their death . 
  when arya arrives at the house of black and white , the very first thing she does is help a man die ; without any payment . 
  giving death/mercy to those who ask for it is the reason for the existence of the fm . 
  everything else ( = money ) came later . 
  possible . 
  but this would be mercy 's last performance either way . 
  just like cat of the canals , mercy will stop existing after having killed , because arya will take on a new face even if she stays in the house of black and white . 
   when you start getting a huge realm it is damn near impossible to wage war against anyone . 
  i think * that * part is actually working as intended .

  there are version of this riddle that are so much more complicated . 
  the wizard has one hundred prisoners , puts them on the stairs , puts a black hat or a white hat on every one of them ( nothing else is known - might be 100 black hats , or 100 white hats , or 43 black hats and 57 white hats , or any other combination ) , then asks the guy at the top of the stairs about the color of his hat . 
  if he knows it , the wizard lets him go , if he does n't know it , the wizard kills him . 
  either way , he then asks the next guy . 
  if anyone says anything other than `` black '' or `` white '' , the wizard kills all of them . 
  before the wizard puts the hats on them , the prisoners have a chance to discuss a strategy . 
  you are one of them , what strategy do you propose to save as many prisoners as possible ? 
  [ example for an easy strategy ] ( #s `` the first prisoner could simply say what color the * second * prisoner 's hat has . 
  the second prisoner now knows the color of his hat , so he is safe .
