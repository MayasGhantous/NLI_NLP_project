  if they happen to have the same color , both of them are safe . 
  the third and forth prisoner do the same thing , and so on .

  if it 's even for him but was odd for the first prisoner , he must be wearing a black hat himself .

  this would be correct , if it were in spoiler tags . 
  let others have fun as well . 
  wizards do crazy stuff , so you have a motive for this weird riddle . 
  also , a wizard can easily stop the prisoners from doing stuff that they 're not supposed to do . 
  stomping morse code with their feet or something . 
  if you want to save someone who has broken through thin ice , * do not run towards them * as shown on the picture . 
  if you do , you 'll almost certainly both end up in the water . 
  - the ice was too thin to support him , so it will be too thin to support * both of you * and his wet clothes . 
  i think the correct method is to crawl somewhere close , then use something rope-like ( e.g. 
  a jacket that you hold on one sleeve ) to pull them out . 
  he `` acknowledged '' their existence , but he did n't confirm that they are genuine . 
  it 's really a shame that you ca n't have line breaks within spoilers . 
  you 're right , of course . 
  different approach for explaining this : think about the riddle with only * three * prisoners . 
  i 'm the last one , you 're the guy in the middle . 
  beforehand , we agree that i 'll count the number of black hats i can see , and * if * it 's even , i 'll say `` black '' . 
  the test starts , and i say `` black '' . 
  ( i die , because my hat really was white - but there was no way we could have known that ... ), 
  you look at the guys in front of you and see that he is wearing a black hat . 
  so the number of black hats you see is * odd * , and you think for a moment that i * should * have said `` white '' to convey this information to you - but of course , i could also see your hat , but you ca n't . 
  so if i saw an even number of black hats but you see an odd one , your own hat must be black . 
  dubiousdoctor , who stands at the end of the line , knows that i could see an even number of black hats - either two or zero . 
  he also knows that * your * hat was black , so it ca n't be zero : his hat must be black as well . 
  correct , although there 's a far better method . 
  it has been posted here a few times , so i wo n't post it again . 
  my hint was only to get peoples ' brains started about how you could convey any information to your fellow prisoners . 
  that 's why your captor is a wizard . 
  if you try shenanigans of that kind , he 'll turn your hands to soup so you ca n't tap people on the shoulder any more . 
  you do n't even need to know if the other guys survived . 
  you only need to hear their answers . 
  otherwise , you are correct . 
  is that enough ? 
  ( `` m\u00fcnchener '' is also fine to me , but it seems that `` m\u00fcnchner '' is the preferred form . ), 
  just to be sure : you want this to used in situations where it basically means `` yes , that seems like the obvious answer , but i have n't given it much thought and might be convinced otherwise '' - or something like that , right ? 
  or `` vermutlich '' in some cases . 
  i think you 'd need to say what you are sch\u00e4tz-ing , so it has to be `` ich sch\u00e4tze ja '' or `` ich sch\u00e4tze schon '' . 
  those are fine , too .

  my new favorite subreddit . 
  this only works if your vassal 's title is the same level or higher as her title . 
  example : you invite a woman who has a claim on a duchy . 
  you marry her to a vassal count of yours , press her claim , wait for them to have a son , kill the father , kill the mother - you just lost a county overall , because the son will now be an independent duke . 
  had you married her to a vassal duke , the son would have remained in your realm . 
  you do however still run the risk of losing the duchy , if the mother happens to die before you manage to kill the father . 
   this will ensure that her children inherit the claim, 
  i did not know that . 
  very interesting . 
   and by 9th grade pretty much everybody is doing it . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  15 + year olds have always claimed that of course they already had sex . 
  that does n't mean they actually did it . 
  sure , 15 years is an age when many people have their first time . 
  that was already the case when i was that age , ~ 15 years ago . 
  but there are also lots of kids who do n't have sex that early , they just are n't usually so loud about it . 
  being a virgin at 16-20 was completely normal when i was that age , but you 'd have had a hard time finding any 16-20yo 's who would have admitted to being virgins . 
  you have a man-cave at 16 ? 
  you sound awesome !, 
  this is inaccurate , you might be thinking about pressed claims . 
  [ here , i started a game and used the console to prove it  ( http://imgur.com/a/raokl ) when you are an emperor ( or king ) and one of your vassal counts inherits a duchy from outside the realm , * they leave your realm * . 
  if you 're using console commands anyway , you can just give all these baronies to one of your vassals . 
  the other ways around this would be going to war against the papcy three times ( for each holding individually ) , or ( if you are a catholic and hold an empire title ) nominating an anti-pope and pressing his claim on the papacy . 
   choose a tutor that is of the german culture and has either the gregarious or diligent trait ( ideally both ) to educate your son . 
  this alone does n't help anymore since the latest patch . 
  the child has to be educated * at the court * of a german ruler to pick up the german culture . 
  some random german courtier at an irish court wo n't change an irish child 's culture anymore . 
  you can just send them there when they turn 6 . 
  foreign rulers are usually happy to accept your children as wards ( or let them be tutored by one of their courtiers ) . 
  if your kids are born at your wife 's court , you 're in a matrilinear marriage and the child wo n't be of your dynasty . 
  he would still have been born at your own court . 
  * his children * might be born at a foreign court . 
  also , when you do this , you 're playing with fire . 
  you might live longer than you planned , and while you 're alive , you have no way of getting your son back , and you have no control over the education of * his * children . 
  can be worth the risk , if your grandchildren inherit their mother 's land as well - but i still do n't like doing this .
