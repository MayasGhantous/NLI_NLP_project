   however , military personnel are different from the general population in that they are overwhelmingly ** young ** , male , of low ses , and have a high base rate of psychological disorders . 
  all risk factors for suicide . 
  everybody seems to think that , but being young is * not * a risk factor for suicide . 
  on the contrary , being old is . 
  the most [ comprehensive statistic ] ( http://www.suicide.org/suicide-statistics.html#death-rates ) i could find is ten years old , unfortunately . 
  but still , it shows that the suicide rate is consistantly higher among the elderly ( 65 years + ) than among people aged 20-34 . 
  or just look at this diagram , [ with data from germany . 
  ( 2011 , grey are men , pink women , it shows suicides per 100,000 people by age group ) ] ( http://www.rlp-gegen-depression.de/images/suizidraten-in-deutschland.jpg ), 
  that way you miss most of the geniuses who are n't 16 years old yet . 
  and the ~ 13 to 16 year olds make some darn good wifes . 
  it 's not a starter , it 's * the only thing they have * . 
  and even for a starter , it 's pretty horrible . 
  there 's one case in which british soldiers tried using smallpox as a weapon ( in a war ) , and they may or may not have been successful . 
  twisting this into an accussation that `` our ( american ? ), 
  use of smallpox historically is one of the biggest biological attacks ever '' is beyond ridiculous . 
  smallpox killed millions of native americans , nobody doubts that . 
  but it did n't need the concious support of any europeans ( and their pathetically limited 15th-18th century knowledge of diseases ) in doing so .

  oh , never thought of that ... they definitely need to change it so you only get the achievement when holding a * non-temporary * emperor title . 
  they are not . 
  some regions of some countries have lost far more bee colonies than usual in some winters of the past ~ 15 years . 
  people ( reddit , journalists ... ) talking about this always make it sound like something between * silent spring ii * and the dolphins leaving earth in the * hitchhiker 's guide * . 
  it 's interesting , and it 's certainly something relevant for beekeepers and scientists , but it 's not threatening . 
  it 's very likely not even one single phenomenon . 
  and since everybody keeps talking about it , it 's certainly not `` the elephant in the room '' . 
  the [ wikipedia article on `` ccd '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colony_collapse_disorder ) is still a good read . 
  but keep this part in mind for the entire article :, 
   non-ccd winter losses as high as 50 % have occurred in some years and regions ( e.g. , 2000 -- 2001 in pennsylvania ) . 
  normal winter losses are typically considered to be in the range of 15 -- 25 % . 
  in many cases , beekeepers reporting significant losses of bees did not experience true ccd , but losses due to other causes . 
   data accumulated over a period from september 24 , 2003 , through to ** january 16 , 2004 ** . 
  ten years , three months . 
  [ too old . 
  too bad , i think this is a much better answer than most in this thread . 
  most answers show great pictures , but none that is iconic and recognizable enough to be `` famous in the future '' . 
  i spend about 90 % of my money on mercenaries . 
  they usually have the best roi by far . 
  that 's interesting , but it [ appears to be a myth . 
  ] ( http://adisquisitivemind.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/lesson-307-dueling-is-not-in-fact-lega-in-paraguay/ ), 
  finding lots of dead adult bees is actually the opposite of what happens in ccd . 
  [ quoting wikipedia 's signs in symptoms section ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colony_collapse_disorder#signs_and_symptoms ), 
   in collapsed colonies ccd is suspected when a complete absence of adult bees is found in colonies , with no or little buildup of dead bees in the hive or in front of the hive . 
  also , finding 50,000 dead bees in one place can certainly be disturbing , but that 's really only * one * beehive . 
  so you 're saying i should start hunting some humans ? 
  i think this paper is [ publically available ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12111/pdf ) ( pdf ) , albeit not through your link . 
  when citing an article , it 's very helpful to mention the article 's title ( an overview of the environmental risks posed, 
  by neonicotinoid insecticides ) - i could only find this one through its doi . 
  edit : still working on this comment . 
  you 're welcome . 
  nope , no title nor abstract , only the university 's off-campus login site . 
  but the doi was thankfully in the url . 
  damn , you even saw the rest of my reply . 
  i deleted that after a moment when i changed my mind a bit . 
  a 20 % increase is of course a 100 % increase over the usual ~ 20 % death rate . 
  so i agree , this is an interesting story . 
  i just do n't see how it is even close to being `` the elephant in the room '' ; especially if we already know what 's causing the problem . 
  ( i 'm not so convinced of the importance of neonicotinoids , even though they may certainly have unintended effects on bee health . ), 
  i think this is a story that will quietly go away over the next few years without anyone ever really knowing what happened or why . 
  because as a first step , you just really need to see some foreign country , any one will do , and you could go to canada this very weekend . 
  do it !, 
  book a flight , or simply drive up there !, 
  toronto is only ~ 8-10 hours drive . 
  if you can take a three ( or four ) day weekend , you can do that by car . 
  [ a beach trip you say ? 
  ( who does n't like canadian beaches in april ? ), 
  i 've seen that a few times , also before the latest patch . 
  it 's really not worth it , you never get much more than op got . 
  did i just spoil a minor detail of a 30 year old book for you ? 
  let me introduce you [ to this nice little song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzqw7_flk0 ) to make it up to you . 
  : wan na hear the answer to the ultimate question of life , the universe , and everything ? 
  there is * nothing * in that article to support the claim that `` the bees are all dying '' . 
  as i said : some colonies are dying . 
  at rates that might be worrying for beekeepers . 
  for the general population , this is nowhere close to a reason for alarm . 
  [ the number of bee colonies in the us is relatively stable ] ( http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/honeybee-colonies.jpg?w=977&amp;h=628 ) , by the way . 
  it 's easy to compensate for the ccd losses . 
  [ taken from [ this article ] ( http://perc.org/articles/everyone-calm-down-there-no-bee-pocalypse ) . ], 
  found a good article about ccd in general . 
  you seemed interested , so i thought i 'd share . 
  [ `` everyone calm down , there is no `` bee-pocalypse '' '' ] ( http://perc.org/articles/everyone-calm-down-there-no-bee-pocalypse ), 
  if you do n't want to read it , this graph says it all : [ the number of bee colonies in the us ] ( http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/honeybee-colonies.jpg?w=977&amp;h=628 ) - it 's * completely unaffected * by ccd , the increased mortality can easily be compensated . 
   just look what you earned then and paid for consumergoods and rent . 
  i doubt that the average worker has to work longer ( per unit of consumption ) today than he had to in 1985 , at least if you only compare western germany . 
  currently , wages for `` the masses '' certainly are rising ; just look at the `` tarifvertrag '' ( for 2.1 million people ! ), 
  from last week : 5.4 % increase over two years . 
  and they are rising stronger than that for the low incomes , by up to 7.6 % .
