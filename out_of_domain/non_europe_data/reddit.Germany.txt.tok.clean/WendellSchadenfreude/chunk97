  babel fish from the * hitchhiker 's guide * . 
  they are little leech-like creatures that when put into your ear canal allow you to understand anything said to you in any form of language - they are universal translators !, 
  that 's awesome enough on its own of course , but if babel fish really existed , they would also prove that there is no god :, 
   now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could evolve purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the * non * - existence of god . 
  the argument goes something like this :, 
   `` i refuse to prove that i exist , '' says god , `` for proof denies faith , and without faith i am nothing . '', 
   `` but , '' says man , `` the babel fish is a dead giveaway , is n't it ? 
  it could not have evolved by chance . 
  it proves you exist , and so therefore , by your own arguments , you do n't . 
   `` oh dear , '' says god , `` i had n't thought of that , '' and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic . 
   `` oh , that was easy , '' says man , and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white , and gets killed on the next zebra crossing . 
  you 're right - but if you switch back and forth between these two pictures quickly , it looks like arya is dancing , so that 's cool at least . 
  thank you . 
   [ ... ] yet stop i did : in fact i often do ,, 
   and always end much at a loss like this ,, 
   wondering what to look for ; wondering , too ,, 
   when churches will fall completely out of use, 
   what we shall turn them into , if we shall keep, 
   a few cathedrals chronically on show ,, 
   their parchment , plate and pyx in locked cases ,, 
   and let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep . 
   shall we avoid them as unlucky places ? 
   or , after dark , will dubious women come, 
   to make their children touch a particular stone ;, 
   pick simples for a cancer ; or on some, 
   advised night see walking a dead one ? 
   power of some sort will go on, 
   in games , in riddles , seemingly at random ;, 
   but superstition , like belief , must die ,, 
   and what remains when disbelief has gone ? 
   grass , weedy pavement , brambles , buttress , sky ,, 
   a shape less recognisable each week ,, 
   a purpose more obscure . 
  i wonder who, 
   will be the last , the very last , to seek, 
   this place for what it was ; one of the crew, 
   that tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were ?

   putin has outright said the ussr was a disaster not to be repeated . 
  putin has outright said that * the collapse * of the ussr was a disaster . 
   [ above all , we should acknowledge that the collapse of the soviet union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century . 
  neunzehnhundertneunundachtzig would be most common . 
  one thing always used to be different - german years were used without an `` in '' . 
  english : this happened ** in ** 1989 . 
  ( in nineteen eightynine ), 
  german : dies geschah ~ ~ in ~ ~ 1989 . 
  although you nowadays often hear people adding the `` in '' in german as well , it 's still rather uncommon . 
  if it 's only this passage , i find it very unconvincing as proof that jojen will die at home - it could just as easily mean that jojen simply wants to `` go home '' ; `` going home '' being a common metaphor for dying . 
  it 's certainly used this way in the books , for instance by the dornish soldier ( from the bloody mummers ) that brienne kills in the whispers . 
  `` send me back to dorne . '',

  that 's because the patch is no longer in beta , it 's now the official version of the game that everybody is using .

  commenting on the presentation of the data :, 
  why in the world are the axes not using the same scale ? 
  they both go from 0 % to 100 % , but the x-axis is still about 1.5 times as long as the y axis . 
  this just makes the data difficult to read for no reason . 
   restaurants , i 'd recommend are enchilada for some amazing mexican food and los gauchos for argentinian steaks . 
  because that 's what americans ( ? ), 
  should try when they are in germany ... 
  when people talk about the [ golden age of science fiction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_age_of_science_fiction ) , we remember heinlein , arthur c. clarke , and asimov . 
  we ignore the fact that there were thousands of other authors , and most of what they wrote was trash . 
  if you look at other [ `` golden ages '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_age_%28metaphor%29#genre ) ( of the western , of broadway , of detective fiction ) , you will find a common pattern : [ ninety percent of everything is crap ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sturgeon%27s_law ) . 
  during a golden age , the bad is just as bad as it always is . 
  but the good is as good as it ever gets . 
  not sure how important that `` lifeline '' is . 
  but we know for certain that thousands of government soldiers are currently still tied up in the qalamoun region , but will be free to deploy elsewhere in a few weeks . 
  winning in that region is big , even if you ignore logistical and moral effects it might have on other regions . 
  any examples of english books that you like ? 
  since `` fantasy '' is such a broad genre , this might help narrowing it down a little . 
  much better . 
  yoren was so cool . 
  if you want to try german food in koblenz , try one of these places maybe :, 
  [ pegelhaus ] ( http://www.pegelhaus.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;itemid=63&amp;lang=de ), 
  all of these places have traditional food from the rhine/moselle region . 
  i really like the wacht am rhein - and it 's close to the `` deutsches eck '' , where every visitor to koblenz has to go anyway . 
  i 'm not sure if this is mostly a reccomendation to op or to sir_brags - but if you like meat and potatoes ( and either wine or beer ) , the regional cuisine in koblenz is definitely worth a try . 
  good advice in general , but in this case ? 
  he 's not the owner of the house or anything , he just came in as a member of a cleaning crew . 
  download arumba 's [ keyboard mod ] ( http://www.arumba.tv/mods/ ) . 
  never play without it again . 
  it adds the most obviously missing hotkeys ( raise levies , board ship , disband army , send offer , ... ) in the unused bottom row of your keyboard . 
  you can edit them using wordpad + + . 
  when you open the list to appoint a new council member , the list overlaps with the council window . 
  comparing the skills of your current councillors with those of the possible candidates becomes thus unneccessarily tedious . 
  arumba fixed that . 
  i have no idea , i never play multiplayer . 
  they do n't affect your checksum and are compatible with iron man . 
  my guess is that you can also use them in multiplayer , but i never tried . 
  that 's cute .
