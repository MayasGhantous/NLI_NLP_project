  would n't that be if his opinion is at -41 ? 
  i thought you get the same number of levies/taxes at any positive opinion . 
  great catch , i totally missed that . 
  i do n't think there 's a phrase for that . 
  when tipping people , saying `` stimmt so '' would be a good translation for `` keep the change '' , but that only works for tipps and sounds weird when talking about 1-10 cents . 
  this is just an example of the stereotype being true : germans are somewhat obsessed with precision . 
  when you have to pay 11.97 $ , you ca n't pay 12 $ - it 's only 3 cents , but it 's still * your * money , and they ca n't simply keep it . 
   but some people still want their bikes back . 
  and you think they are in germany ? 
  when our bikes disappear , we always blame the poles . 
  everything in this post is wrong or strongly misleading . 
  income inequality in germany is n't increasing . 
  it did increase quite clearly from the 1990 's to ~ 2005 , but decreased again between 2005 and 2010 . 
  any data newer than that is n't all that reliable yet , but clearly there has n't been a strong trend over the past ~ 10 years . 
  and in any case , income inequality in germany is pretty average when compared to other oecd states . 
  [ best english source : oecd data ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=idd ), 
  and none of them have to `` beg '' for welfare , they have a right to it . 
  the nazi group existed , yeah . 
  three people , who managed to murder 9 immigrants over the course of ~ 10 years before they were caught ( in 2011 ) . 
  the claim that they were supported by the authorities is common , but unsubstanitated . 
   your oecd number do n't match with the experience millions are making on a daily basis . 
  `` my personal experience does n't match the statistics , therefore the statistics must be wrong . '', 
  the oecd has no reason to make germany look good . 
  they use the sam methodology for all the other countries listed . 
  do you think there are countries where people on welfare can simply go out and buy new fridges or beds regularly ? 
  having to give some justification before getting new ( expensive ) stuff for free is n't `` begging '' . 
  all their basic needs are covered , and they also have a right to a fridge and a bed for their children - i do n't think it 's scandalous when they have to prove that they actually * need * this stuff before they get it . 
  i 'm not comparing poor people in germany to starving kids in third world countries . 
  i compared income inequality between oecd countries . 
  the oecd is basically [ `` the first world '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/oecd_member_states_map.svg ) . 
  edit : about your edit - an international comparison of child poverty rates shows that germany [ is n't doing too bad ] ( http://www.commondreams.org/sites/commondreams.org/files/imce-images/childpovertychart.jpg ) . 
  ( data from [ unicef , 2012 ] ( http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc10_eng.pdf ) , pdf ) keep in mind that they are talking about * relative * poverty , usually defined as having less than 50 % of the national average available income .

  i do n't think being poor and reliant on welfare is fun . 
  but i doubt that there 's something specifically horrible about being poor * in germany * .

  being european , i do n't really understand it myself . 
  i know the orange team is supposed to carry the ball to the right , but one of their players accidentally throws it past his own team far to the left . 
  the white team gets there so fast that orange ca n't recover the ball , and thus white scores some points . 
  it 's obviously a major fuck-up by the orange team , and it must be quite rare . 
  betting on it would have given you a lot of money . 
  ah , ok ... if the orange player had managed to really pick up the ball ( with no white players anywhere near him ) , would he have been allowed to keep playing and carry/throw it out of the end zone again ? 
  or was the play over the moment that he touched the ball in his own endzone ? 
  anytime , except three times .

  the redshift answer is correct , but seems confusing to me . 
  the important starting point is that the light was already on it 's way while the expansion happened . 
  in the extreme case , moments after the big bang , everything in the universe was very close to everything else . 
  when the first stars formed , everything was still much closer together than it is now , so their light should have reached `` earth '' ( which did n't yet exist , of course ) billions of years ago . 
  but the space that this light had to cross expanded , and thus the light is only reaching us right now .

  translating into english , i suppose english is your native language ? 
  how did you get started ? 
  do you have a technical background ? 
  there are exceptions of course , but [ the general rule ] ( http://karenrueckert.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/should-i-only-translate-into-my-native-language/ ) for translators is that it 's best to translate * into * your native language . 
  as a german with a science background , i can easily understand many technical documents in english , so i could translate them into german . 
  i could also translate german documents into english , but they would always sound like translations . 
  no , not at all . 
  [ reading in german and english . ], 
  thinking about books that i 've read , i often ca n't even remember what language i read them in . 
  of course , reading a translation is different from reading a book in the original language . 
  but if i want to read e.g. 
  a spanish or russian book , i do n't feel my experience would be different wether i read them in german or in english . 
  this is true , but i do n't think it 's an answer to the question . 
  you are only comparing reading translations to reading originals ; you 're not actually comparing the difference between reading in english and reading in norwegian . 
  if you were to read the name of the rose ( original in italian ) or war and peace ( original in russian ) , do you think you 'd experience them differently depending on wether you read them in norwegian or in english ?
