  do you simply want to say that somebody has to do some paying ( `` these floors are n't gon na scrub themselves , grab a broom !, 
  '' ) , or do you want to say that it 's not worth it ? 
  in both cases , i find it hard to give a good translation , because school in germany is ( basically ) free . 
  but before i try to find a good one , i want some context . 
  for the most part , cdu members could be mainstream * democrats * . 
  do you need to siege down everything ? 
  you already control normandy . 
  take essex and one or two more duchies to hand out to your buddies in your initial war . 
  if there are any english rebellions after that , crushing them should be easy enough , and you can take away their titles after that . 
  the termites in this process can be re-used , the paper is consumed . 
  invest in paper !, 
  your organs can only be used when you are braindead . 
  when you are braindead and an organ donor , your body is kept alive by machines until the doctors get a chance to harvest the organs . 
  when you are braindead and * not * an organ donor , the machines are switched off . 
  either way , `` you '' are already dead with no chance of survival . 
  but your bodily functions will actually be kept up * longer * if you are a donor . 
  registering as a donor means that even though you 're dead , at least your body parts ( that are now useless to you ) will save or vastly improve several people 's lives . 
  [ clearly stating your position on organ donation on a piece of paper that you keep in your wallet is a good idea either way , to make shure your relatives do n't have to make a difficult decision for you . ],

   sigil : the big dipper with an extra star above and to the right ( alaska 's flag ), 
  that 's not `` an extra star '' , that 's [ polaris ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polaris ) , the northern star . 
  using the big dipper to find polaris is the easiest wy to find north at night on the northern hemisphere . 
  do you know if that new liver of yours would potentially be re-used again if you were to die in an appropriate way ? 
  i always wondered that ... 
  who do you think `` they '' are ? 
  do you know any doctors ? 
  ask them if it 's standard procedure to let people bleed out on the side of the road so that their organs can be transplanted . 
  to your doctor , the potential recipients are just as anonymous as they are to you . 
  * you * are your doctor 's patient , the person who actually has a face and a name . 
  also , you simply * ca n't * `` let a person die '' in a way that would leave their organs ready for transplantation . 
  organ donation is only possible when people die of * brain death * - when you bleed out next to your car , your organs become useless . 
  why would it be the 35th province ? 
  iran only has [ 31 provinces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_iran ) ... 
   well apparently in germany there is a government office that deals with stuff like this . 
  do you know the name of that office ? 
  because i do n't know what this might be , and it seems like nobody else does , either . 
  can you simply tell us your german famlily 's name and city of origin ? 
  on wether or not you know the correct spelling ? 
  it 's so cool that they put this in the game . 
  and that you found it , too .

  cute .

  [ this is was the dog has to say about this . 
  germany . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm getting too old for this stuff , but i think torrents are dead in germany . 
  they are easy to track , and a lot of people have gotten in trouble for illegal torrents . 
  streams on the other hand are doing just fine . 
  if i understand them correctly ( [ link to their german page ] ( http://www.1und1.de/datenschutz ) ) , 1 & 1 does keep records of their customers ' connection data . 
  if they keep records , they have to share them with prosecution authorities . 
  in your own best interest , do n't use torrents in germany . 
  since about 2008 . 
  from 2009 to 2010 , isps were required by law to keep records of their customers ' connection data . 
  this law was deemed unconstitutional , but isps * can * still keep records ; and afaik they all do . 
  you can find a lot about this in the [ german wikipedia ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/filesharing#.c3.9cber_die_ip-adresse ) , for a start . 
  also , simply google `` abmahnung torrent '' ( * abmahnung * roughly is german for `` cease & desist '' ) , and you 'll find hundreds of stories of germans who got caught using torrents . 
  when you use torrents in germany , you 're playing with fire . 
  i 'm told streaming is fine . 
  it 's unclear if it 's illegal , and afaik nobody has ever gotten any trouble for it . 
  ( for watching !, 
  hosting is different , of course . ), 
  downloading is certainly illegal , i have no idea how high the risk of getting caught is . 
  i never do anything illegal myself . 
  it was taken down ( by being declared unconstitutional by the german federal constitutional court ) . 
  but that only means the isps do n't * have to * keep records of your connections , but they are still allowed to . 
  it 's the passive form . 
  `` ich habe geboren '' - i gave birth . 
  `` ich wurde geboren '' - i was `` given birth '' , i.e. 
  i was born . 
  90 % of what ? 
  are you claiming that 90 % of all the species that existed when humans became the dominant species on the planet have gone extinct , or that 90 % of all the species that ever went extinct did so during the human era ? 
  either way , i do n't believe you . 
  true , but that 's not what the aliens were asking . 
  how many of those species died * during our stewardship of this planet * , that was the question . 
  explaining that the dinosaurs ( and countless other species ) died out is n't embarassing in any way , it just happened a long time before humans even existed . 
  @julianlau [ that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/25g0kg/if_aliens_came_to_earth_after_a_period_of/chgwosl ) . 
  i still do n't believe that number , but we 're getting closer . 
  in this case , the number is far too low . 
  if you only look at the known [ major extinction events ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinction_event#major_extinction_events ) , there are several that killed more than 70 % of all species alive at the time - and those are only the major events , not the normal dying-out . 
  to a good approximation , all species are extinct . 
   haha there 's around 14 million of us !, 
  for a moment i thought this number had to be far too high ... but the math says you could be right . 
  jr&p lived 400 years ago . 
  if the average child since then was born to parents who were 25 years old at the time , that 's 16 generations . 
  the 16th root of 14,000,000 is 2.80 - so to have 14,000,000 descendants today , jr&p and the following generations of the family only needed to have an average of about 2.8 children . 
  ( 2.8 children who survive to have children of their own , that is . ), 
   interface - character browser can now filter on religion and culture as well as religion and culture group, 
  this is sooo good . 
  it would be , if they in fact were descendants of * one single family * . 
  but they are n't . 
  they are descendants of thousands of pocahontas ' contemporaries as well .
