  has got ta be feelin fucking good when you 're on rockin it on the dancefloor !, 
  yeah , it was just a quick google search , you 'd have to fasten the chain much closer to the wall to have enough room for ironing . 
  i 'd also use a chain for the setup , this way you can just use it to hold the board to the wall while it 's not in use . 
  the support brace on the bottom would take a lot more resources and skill to make yourself . 
  ... fuck it , i 'll draw it ... 
  edit : if you 'd go a little overkill with your mounting ( thick chain , big hooks , 3 hinges ) you could get away with only one chain . 
  edit 2 : oh and of course you need some foam and a sturdy cloth on top of it to give it some squishyness . 
  for me it 's more about `` shoving the hip forward '' which i cant achive while my knees are in front of me . 
  luckily i can do most positions in a way that benefits me , but standing blowjobs are mostly just exhausting for me ... 
  so ... for a usb stick this is little overkill ... i got a [ kingston datatraveler ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/b00urmsype ) a couple of years ago and that thing is fucking sturdy and much smaller than this thing . 
  what what ? 
  ( i was referring to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isujdfwgqss ) video  ), 
  really ? 
  i ca n't complain about that  i had problems with other sticks breaking or disassembling themselves on my keychain, 
  [ this is getting better by the hour ] ( http://cdn.gifbay.com/2012/11/nothing_like_popcorn_with_a_movie-15084.gif ), 
  god , that was hilarious !, 
  i could watch that all day, 
  haha i had fun drawing that in paint , so i do n't care , 
  next time use google image search, 
  my god that woman is fucking unstable !, 
  why would you cry and scream when the horse is freaking out already ? 
  wtf, 
  sooo , are there war officers ? 
  i do n't quite understand the need to specify officers as peace officers if there are no war officers ... 
  i can tell you that milling that piece would be much more efficient than first milling the mdf counterpart and then casting it , especially if you want to produce only one piece . 
  but you need more expensive machines and tools for milling aluminium than for mdf . 
  also , if an error in your cnc program fucks up your piece , i 'd rather replace mdf than aluminium . 
  man , that is one complicated system right there ... in germany it 's so much easier :, 
  - 15 : may start working, 
  - 16 : age of consent , drink non-distilled alcohol, 
  - 18 : everything else, 
  edit : forgot alcohol, 
  aaaand a shoe came off , she ( probably ) ded, 
  edit : only one shoe came off, 
  what year is it ? 
  this video looks like it 's been made in 2005 . 
  the cyclist too imo , even if it was justified to complain , he kinda lost it too . 
  his ( and my ) problem is n't the gun or that you carry one . 
  the problem is, 
   i would have hoped he 'd tried something so i could put him down . 
  hoping for someone to do something so you can shoot/kill ~ ~ him ~ ~ them sounds pretty fucked up , not only in backwood shitberg . 
  oh , okay , verbally defending yourself means screaming the same thing over and over again ? 
  good luck , buddy . 
  with your next verbal argument, 
  i 've been on the road of `` react the way you are treated '' until i found that it benefits no one and i 'm better off taking the high road if you ca n't properly argue with someone . 
  does that make me seem arrogant some times ? 
  yes but i do n't care . 
  does it ruin the rest of my day ? 
  not in the slightest . 
  it 's all about training yourself to react different in stressful situations . 
  could they kinda try to not make it a fucking mouth full to say out loud ? 
  something like just `` radeon crimson '' would have done it . 
  or go completely wild and call it `` radeon settings '', 
  could we ban facebook links please ? 
  they do n't work well with reddit and i have to reload the page after i 'm done ... 
  so much for useless inventions, 
  still , for me as a european , it 's hard to follow that thought . 
  i 'm okay with damaging someone until they are unable to attack me or stop doing so if i have to , but going from `` hey that guy just hit me in the face '' to `` he needs to die '' is absolutely unimaginable for . 
  but hey , whatever floats your boat i guess . 
  i guess reddit likes to shout and scream today , next time a woman screams in panic everyone will be like `` maan why do woman always scream like that in stressful situations '', 
  i 'm actually sorry that you live in a world that requires such a mindset . 
  be safe dude . 
  that 's convenient , you can use one brain for at least 3 human skins , so 2 people can keep their brains after skinning !, 
  dude we are onto something here !, 
  well , since there are no news that show animations or gameplay , it 's only natural that everyone is talking about graphics . 
  well , they replied to a craigslist ad ... 
  i really like your stuff , but every time the title comes up it says `` build '' instead of `` built '' it bugs the hell out of me . 
  just so you can correct that in the future , `` built '' is the past tense of `` build '' and should go with `` designed '' since that 's past tense too . 
  yeah , i really do n't understand why everyone has to be so fucking involved in everything . 
  just . . chill and let people talk , maybe even consider th ... 
  i do n't even care about this post now that i think about it . 
  peace, 
  it 's similar to a `` kartoffelpresse '' . 
  you use it to make mashed potatoes and you just put boiled potatoes in it and then squeeze them through the holes . 
  instant mashed potatoes . 
  you mean , he has a * rad * channel ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ schow ^ ^ ^ myself ^ ^ ^ out, 
  wow incredible purchase . 
  if everything works the pedals and trackir alone are worth about 200 bucks !, 
  looks fairly normal sized to me ... ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ show ^ ^ ^ myself ^ ^ ^ out, 
  i bet sean finnegan can !, 
  my god , i really have to defeat the urge to upload this as my facebook profile pic ... 
  so many people would be so fucking mad ... 
  sooo the system is planned as following :, 
  work while you are healthy and strong, 
  pay taxes for all sorts of things , including people that ca n't work, 
  as soon as you belong to the people that ca n't work ( age , accidents , health ) you benefit from the money the healthy and strong pay in taxes, 
  obviously there flaws with that system , but those flaws were minor , as long as there was kind of a social pyramid where more people are of working age and condition than the opposite . 
  tl ; dr : the `` old '' people probably paid for their `` old '' people while they were of working age , so they kinda deserve that . 
  as i said , there are flaws with that system , and as long as there is enough money put into it , those flaws seem minor . 
  for example people who could work but do n't and still get the benefits . 
  if you are talking about people that really ca n't work for health/mental reasons , i guess it 's better to not have homeless people and not have people die because of simple reasons like hunger or cold . 
  also , at least in germany , it 's not income tax that is paying for that , it 's `` social security '' . 
  i may have used the wrong word here , but it is essentially tax , as it is based on what you earn and it comes off right where income tax is collected . 
  edit : as i said twice now , this system has flaws . 
  this is just my interpretation of why people would do it this way . 
  i do n't know why , but man , that facebook thing with the french flag really pissed me off ... especially people who reversed it the next day . 
  well , i guess `` lady '' was a little bit of an overstatement ... 
  also , apparently he has everything on camera !, 
  wow , i really enjoyed your calming and slightly ~ ~ amused ~ ~ excited voice !,
