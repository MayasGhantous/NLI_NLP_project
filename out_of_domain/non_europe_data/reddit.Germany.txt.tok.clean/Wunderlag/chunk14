  when i get home i 'll look into it and provide you with links . 
  edit : okay i 'm home now . 
  first of all [ here ] ( http://ts.thrustmaster.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&amp;gid=1&amp;fid=3&amp;pid=311&amp;cid=12 ) is the link to the download site . 
  and for resetting the joystick , you need to open the gui configurator and click on stock on the left , choose a setting and click run . 
  dude , how about a spoiler alert ? 
  of course there is , but to get a really good drill shape you need some pretty advanced knapping skills . 
  also , the more efficient you make your drill , the more fragile it gets while this arrow shaped drill would be very robust and easy to carry around . 
  it was a plastic cup ... 
  keep a pot of sand by the bed . 
  sprinkle some on your johnson from time to time . 
  adding sand this way will help your problem . 
  ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ had ^ ^ ^ to, 
  haha i almost got scamned right before christmas , i already bought the snacks and he never replied with an adress xd, 
  i ate the whole package with my family , so not much harm was done , 
  get going , just watch a couple of [ videos on vimeo ] ( https://vimeo.com/blog/category/video-school ) ( they have learning videos for adobe premiere , final cut and windows movie maker ) . 
  if you have a general idea with those videos , and do n't mind 25 $ monthly fee , then go to lynda.com and you 'll acquire your editing-skills super fast . 
  haha , wow thanks that means a lot since i really tried to nail that in this video . 
  there is much room for improvement , but i 'm working on it , 
  i 'll see them the first time on wednesday although i 've been a fan for years . 
  so much hype, 
  i 'm nit quite sure where maybach originated , but at least mercedes is german and he is pronouncing it correctly the german way . 
  okay guys , i will see them as the opening act for slipknot on wednesday and i really ca n't help myself but i kinda lost motivation to go to the whole concert because of them . 
  i really tried to like them at least a little and went through their spotify library but i just ca n't get over the really bad sounds they are making ( i 'm struggling to call it music ... ) . 
  can anyone explain what is so special/good about them and maybe change my mind ? 
  that photo of her face is much more haunting to me . 
  her eyes are so eerie ... 
  you have n't seen german porn yet ...

  [ woman : `` so that 's the transformer we always have problems with , can you take a look at it ? '', 
  guy : `` yeah , but why is there hay on the ground ? '', 
  woman : `` why do you wear a mask ? '', 
  guy : `` hmm , just blow me !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnkaa2g57lg ), 
  i 'm not a sucker for punk , so maybe that 's my problem here . 
  but why anyone would give them an opening act for slipknot is beyond me . 
  hear themselves talking with a 0.1 second delay, 
  there is an app where you can simulate this ... 
  afaik mad catz products are of very poor quality , better get a thrustmaster t.flight hotas x if you want a decent beginner model . 
  if you like it and you want to upgrade to the good stuff ( as i did , i had the t.flight for like 3 months and then bought a hotas warthog ) those like 40 $ really do n't hurt much . 
  disclaimer : i never had a mad catz product , my opinion is based on my intense online research . 
  the f.l.y. 
  5 has an inbuilt throttle so i guess he wants one with it . 
  also the t.flight has an extra axis on the throttle which is veey isfull in space flight, 
  can anyone tell me what she said while walking out ? 
  i could n't understand it . 
  fellow austrian here . 
  while i agree that skiing on prepared routes is safe ** r ** , 3 people at the company i work for had an skiing accident last year , all of them mediocre skier . 
  my boss tumbled down the mountainside and broke his spine -  permanently disabled from the waist down ; a coworker broke his collarbone -  7 weeks disabled left hand ; another coworker broke 3 ribs -  6 weeks disabled . 
  i used to love snowboarding but for those reasons and the high price i 'll probably never do it again ... 
  can someone explain how this middle lane works ? 
  in europe you are not allowed to cross any solid lines , this would pretty much make this lane obsolete since you ca n't get on it ... 
  funny enough , `` herumlungern '' or `` lungern '' means `` hang around '' or `` hang out '' in german ... 
  yeah , linger would be an even better translation depending on the context, 
  wow , they definitely look nice , but 550 $ + shipping is asking way too much for those couple of laser cut parts , nuts , bolts , springs and sensors . 
   that 's definitely not ~ ~ his ~ ~ their first rodeo ... 
  ftfy, 
  maybe he installed windows on the usb stick ? 
  read the annotations ? 
  or even the video description :, 
  english :, 
  the sound of a polka drifted from my neighbor 's, 
  and set my feet a-tapping oh !, 
  ieva 's mother had her eye on her daughter but, 
  ieva she managed to fool her , you know . 
  'cause who 's going to listen to mother saying no, 
  when we 're all busy dancing to and fro !, 
  ieva was smiling , the fiddle it was wailing, 
  as people crowded round to wish her luck . 
  everyone was hot but it did n't seem to bother, 
  the handsome young man , the dashing buck . 
  'cause who 's going to mind a drop of sweat, 
  when he 's all busy dancing to and fro !, 
  ieva 's mother she shut herself away, 
  in her own quiet room to hum a hymn . 
  leaving our hero to have a spot of fun, 
  in a neighbor 's house when the lights are dim . 
  'cause what does it matter what the old folks say, 
  when you 're all busy dancing to and fro !, 
  when the music stopped then the real fun began, 
  and that 's when the laddie fooled around . 
  when he took her home , when the dancing was over, 
  her mother angrily waiting they found . 
  but i said to her , ieva , now do n't you weep, 
  and we 'll soon be dancing to and fro !, 
  i said to her mother now stop that noise, 
  or i wo n't be responsible for what i do . 
  if you go quietly and stay in your room, 
  you wo n't get hurt while your daughter i woo . 
  'cause this fine laddie is a wild sort of guy, 
  when he 's all busy dancing to and fro !, 
  one thing i tell you is you wo n't trap me ,, 
  no , you wo n't find me an easy catch . 
  travel to the east and travel to the west but, 
  ieva and i are going to make a match . 
  'cause this fine laddie ai n't the bashful sort, 
  when he 's all busy dancing to and fro . 
  yeah , but one mistake can cost you a whole fucking hand . 
  work safety rules are there for a reason and you really do n't want to lose a finger via degloving just because you fear the drill . 
  the problem with diresta is that he uses his tool wrong , which not only animates him to ignore work safety but also fucks up his tools unnecessarily . 
  i work with metal in a professional environment so i could point out a couple of problems with this video , if you are interested .
