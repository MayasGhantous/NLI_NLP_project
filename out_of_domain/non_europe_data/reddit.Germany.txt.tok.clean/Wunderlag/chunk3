  he basically got screwed over a ( shady ) game `` swaping '' deal . 
  i need that , where do i get it ? 
  had i asked my parents for a videogame for 40-60 bucks when i was 12 , they would have asked me `` what do you need a videogame for ? 
  you dont have a console nor pc , you moron '', 
  so yeah ... i still see loads of those clich\u00e9 cod kiddies and that game comes with a hefty 60 $ pricetag ... 
  thanks , 
  i ca n't remember where i read this , bis pilae 's weight over thereis something like 5grams or so ... that comet has no gravity worth mentioning, 
  because fuck you , bitch !! 1 ! 1 !! one1 !, 
  my guess is that is hat some automated stabilisation onboard that can correct itself if needed, 
  if it is that bad , consider buying an antistatic wristband for everyone involved building the pc !, 
  herbert the pervert int the cartrunk is pretty funny too, 
  how can one asune that a guy with a coathanger is threat ? 
  pulling a gun on someone unarmed is so fucking weird . 
  not related , but i got ta say that i ca n't believe that anyone would buy stuff like this for that price . 
  are people gambling in it being worth more in the future ? 
  ( to each their own btw , i do n't want to discurage anyone buying it ), 
  they ca n't even find philae with rosettas cameras and scanners , so probably no , 
  i 'm on mobile , can someone provide `` rekt '' checklist please ? 
  yeaah , so if `` valve '' made a game , it would be made by a guy named valve sitting there coding all day and releasing it ? 
  all games are made by employees , whether they are single persons or companies employed by valve ... 
  this answer was true many years ago . 
  right now the shift to `` everyone must get high education '' is in full progress . 
  it 's very very hard to get a good young apprentice because everyone who thinks he is smarter than the rest can get higher education for basically no cost and at least tries it for a couple of years before failing . 
  so right now we are in some kind of hole where a lot of people try and not enough people failed at trying to get good people to learn a trade, 
  if i recall correctly it 's a hack noone has found yet and you did n't plublicize or abuse it . 
  which should make you havier , no ? 
  dude , that sign is a british pound ( # ) sign , not a euro ( $ ) sign ... 
  most electric razors come with an clip-on for hair lenght . 
  start with the highest setting an start going all over your ass in all directions . 
  keep lowering the clip-on until you 're satisfied . 
  you basically ca n't hurt yourself , so go wild . 
  shaving your crack without that clipon or with a razor  could < end with a fissure around your poop hole , so do it if you dare , but be warned . 
  how much was it when you bought it ? 
  my god that 's terrible , please use proper your/you 're ( your in this case ), 
  meeh i just payed 390 $ on amazon with 2-3 days till shipping ... i really hope it does n't take longer . 
  you drive 4hrs per day to work ? 
  with your car ?? 
  would n't it be much much more convenient and save you lots of money to move there ? 
  ( considering fuel cost , car maintanance , time lost you could work a second job , ... ), 
  even if you live for free now , it could still be profitable to move cliser to work because cars do n't only cost gas-money , but also oil , maintenance , tires , etc. 
  which sometimes amounts to double the gas costs ... and the 4 hours a day driving could earn you a good bit extra each month to compensate for higher rent . 
  i 'm just shocked that people do that kind of stuff , but then again fuel costs more here in germany so maybe it 's not an issue in the states . 
  yeah , renting a room seems to be the most reasonable thing to do then , something small just to sleep there . 
  i was just curious why people do such long commutes , but i guess i underestimated the huge price differences for rent . 
  adding you for alien isolation, 
  you do n't even need to land , just hit eject and before you press x to get back in game you can float around and stuff . 
  this is where you scroll your mousewheel and get the pistol out . 
  yep , also : if your ship dies , you die ... 
  so , i like early access and followed the `` trend '' of it since before it was a thing on steam but i ca n't remember any games that did n't give you full access to the game after it was released . 
  especially with steam early access , where it is a must for the developer to give it to you . 
  paying for beta testing only would be really fucking stupid anyways and i am sure the developer would be shut down by the gaming press pretty fast . 
  do n't get me wrong , i feel sorry for the people who were injured or died , especially those who did n't drive themselves , but all of those crashing in there were going way too fast for these conditions and not one car activated the hazard lights ... and noone thought about getting their hazard triangle out to put it a couple of meters back so oncoming traffic would see it soon enough . 
  you do n't have to walk on the road and the snow did n't seem to be that deep , so you could walk beside it . 
  also : the guys filming this were in really great danger too . 
  if a car started rolling and somehow bounced over another they could easily be killed . 
  but i guess getting a good shot instead of carrying a hazard triangle a couple meters is more important . 
  do n't buy early access unless you are 100 % sure the game is at a stage where you want it to be !, 
  watch youtube videos to determine the current state of the game . 
  i think that was all ingame chat since the hacker probably was n't on their teamspeak/skype ... 
  oh , come on . 
  this is not / r/pcmasterrace, 
  erm it is not even a bug , this is by design . 
  they disabled specific non or bad working chips on all 970s and this includes 1 l2 cache . 
  that makes a 2nd l2 cache have to do the work of 2 l2 caches as soon as you need the last 0.5 gb of ram ( 8 l2 caches - 1 l2 cache = 1/8 --  1/8 of 4gb ram = 0.5 gb ), 
  see this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b74myv8ldxc ), 
  edit : with all chips enabled it would essentially be a 980, 
  see my answer [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2tth2o/dying_light_promises_no_review_embargoes_delivers/co2n7va ), 
  i think many cheap photo editing apps call their `` boost clarity '' feature `` hdr '' and use only one photo for it . 
  guess that 's why so many people call it hdr, 
  it 's from a german sketch show , so no harm was done , 
  i had that same problem ( my own fault for breaking it ) and they did n't even want the old keyboard back . 
  they just sent me a new one that a arrived a week after that ... at least they do so in germany ( btw same with my g35 with worn out ear pads and my g500 , which they even upgraded to the g500s . ), 
  note that `` gift '' means `` poison '' in german, 
  i think / r/ch0pp3r is referring to your title ... 
  oh god , as a qm in a metal manufacturing company i could n't stand the lack of security and base knowledge while milling and grinding . 
  although the knife looks great , this guy just calls for ripped off fingers and tools flying across his workshop . 
  worst thing for me was definitively grinding with gloves on . 
  that shit can fuck your fingers up in no time and i 've seen that happen once . 
  with over 150.000 subscribers , that guy should take on some responsibility and take a course in work safety . 
  people will hurt themselves imitating his work . 
  when grinding , milling or drilling , do not ever use gloves . 
  if your bare finger gets caught you might have some burns or maybe lose a finger nail . 
  if your glove gets caught it could rip your fingers straight off and smushes the ripped off parts . 
  that is also why you should wear clothing that is specifically made for workshops . 
  this clothing has predetermined breaking points e.g. 
  on your shoulders so your sleeve comes off and you do n't get pulled into the machine . 
  ( did n't see him doing it , just as a fyi ), 
  another thing that bothered me was how shallow he clamped the round metal bar into his blank vice . 
  there are special vice-cheeks with groves in them for that purpose that prevent the bar from flying . 
  oh and not having any protective glass around your milling area is just suicidal since the cutter is turning with at least 2000-3000 turns per minute and if it breaks you get that shit straight into your stomach . 
  and on a side note : he is using far too less lubricant while milling . 
  there should be a constant flow of liquid around the milling area to prevent the cutter from dying too early . 
  ( and that one spurt he gave it in the video just kills the cutting edge if the cutter is already heated up ), 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzgvkp6o6ig ) is obviously his ~ ~ father ~ ~ grandfather, 
  jup , [ that 's ] ( http://www.redneckheaven.com/ ) the bar, 
  nah , it hit the front page of / r/videos a couple days ago, 
  am i right that , if they are downloading that stuff from space in a constant rate over 5 years , they got a downstream of about 16mb/s ? 
  that is crazy fast imo . 
  every time i see cricket and the fast cameras racing across the field and everyone yelling what just happened i ca n't help but think of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_6d3jbbo4s ),
