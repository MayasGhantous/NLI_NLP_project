  - headphones g930 on selfmade hook from pill-box, 
  - my beloved pc ( specs bellow ), 
  - headphones g35 with trackir trackclip pro attached, 
  specs of my pc :, 
  - i5-3570k @ 4.2 ghz, 
  - 16gb of corsair vengeance 1600mhz, 
  - nvidia geforce gtx 980, 
  - noctua nh-d14 cpu cooler, 
  - cooler master haf rc-922xm-kkn1, 
  - a couple of old harddrives, 
  some of the `` mods '' i did to my setup are :, 
  - the hole in the middle of the desk guides the usb cables of the gamepads , mouse , keyboard and usb hub to the back of my desk, 
  - the joystick is mounted on a ( crude ) [ selfmade aluminium plate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xqiz2e1.jpg ), 
  - the two headsets are hanging on `` hooks '' made from old pill bottles . 
  the g930 `` hook '' has an additional hook screwed into the front to hold the charging cable . 
  - there are 4 led strips glued behind the rim of the table to illuminate the wall when turned on . 
  anything sliding is a problem though ... and you always have to deal with the usb cable . 
  as of late i was thinking about attaching the whole thing to my chair and have it between my legs . 
  then you could just screw off the handle and it would n't hinder you . 
  still got the problem with that usb cable though ... 
  already done , do you need proof ? 
  haha i got those all around my car and apartment . 
  the problem is that i always bunch them up in one place and then i got none in my car or non in my apartment . 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/30laei/i_made_a_219_upgrade_to_my_flightsim/cptle66 ), 
  thanks , i just posted a comment with all the stuff in the photo and my pc specs [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/30laei/i_made_a_219_upgrade_to_my_flightsim/cptle66 ), 
  as i said in other comments , i was disappointing in the `` zoom-in-ability '' of my photo because i always appreciate when i can do that with other posts on here , 
  [ no space left , still off center :-p ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l2logoq.jpg ), 
  bring some wooden planks and nails to extend my desk and i 'll provide the beer . 
  thanks !, 
  i tried astro a40s and they suuuucked so badly , especially compared to the cheaper g35s so i stopped looking for astros altogether . 
  i may run another test with the a50s if im in the mood . 
  thanks, 
  sadly not a 100 % . 
  the accuracy when shooting for example gimbaled weapons is n't as good with the joystick but when it comes to flight maneuverability mouse got nothing to say . 
  with hotas and paddles you decide when to pitch , yaw and roll and you ca n't really do that with kb&m . 
  another thing is buttons . 
  buttons fucking all over your hand . 
  with kb&m you have to use at least wasd for movement and then you got like 10-12 keys around your fingers ( including mouse buttons ) . 
  on my hotas i got 22 buttons on my joystick and 16 buttons on the throttle in immediate range and much more within the flick of my wrist . 
  edit : there are ways to counter the loss of accuracy . 
  i for example use trackir and let my gimbaled weapons in star citizen follow my head movement . 
  it 's a little hard a t first but you get used to it pretty fast and it 's a lot of fun . 
  so much room in there  although i hate that they used rivets to attach the drive cage . 
  8 screws more and the airflow would be so much better !, 
  naaah , i live near a really loud street and prefer my headphones for gaming and watching movies ( when on my own ), 
  i definitely love my warthog , but the different springs in the x55 would have been a welcome addition to the warthog . 
  that hog is fucking hard to handle !, 
  i 'm guessing a floppy cape is not a cape made of floppy disks ? 
  edit : but for reals now : do not ever wear loose clothes or long sleeves when drilling , grinding , turning or milling !, 
  i answered that question [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/30laei/i_made_a_219_upgrade_to_my_flightsim/cptjxt9 ), 
  the g930s are for watching movies and stuff when i 'm alone and sitting on the couch since i live nearby a really noisy street . 
  that is exactly my problem here . 
  a good set of cans like the sennheiser hd9598 cost about 170 $ , plus ~ 50 $ for a decent mic makes double what a pair of g35 cost . 
  and then you lose the benefit of :, 
  - buttons on your headset, 
  - volume control on your headset, 
  - retracting-your-mic-auto-mute function, 
  - ( if you buy g930s ) wireless-ness, 
  that 's why i stuck with them . 
  best alternative for me would be :, 
  - senneheiser hd598, 
  problem with antlion is that they are always sold out and pretty expensive, 
  i 'm by no means against good audio gear !, 
  as i said i tried some headphones and they were better , more comfortable and you could use them with other gear ( g35s have only usb ) . 
  but the little details that i missed made me choose against them . 
  haha that stand looks great !, 
  i did n't even think of doing something like that but i can definitely understand how it is wobbly ... 
  problem with manufacturing something like that is, 
  a ) i 'm just qa and had n't had any experience with milling for like 5 years now, 
  b ) i 'm not the owner of the company i work for and ca n't just do stuff like that, 
  and c ) everything that is `` out-of-your-way '' movable will be wobbly per definition ... 
  but i was thinking about a clip-on for your desk . 
  something like my solution but with a quick-fastening solution to clip to the underside of your desk, 
  yeah , as long as you do n't zoom in , 
  i think it just is n't cool anymore . 
  modern cases are all about slickness , extremely round edges or one solid block without profile and hiding all fan-intakes in the front . 
  and it 's big ... really big ... and i like it :d, 
  haha the audiophiles are string within this sub , 
  i do n't use the speakers much because of a noisy street right in front of my window and my headset ( s ) are not top of the line but the best for me ( look for the other comments here about audiogear to learn more ), 
  so , i thought a little about my mount and had an idea how to mount it the most efficient way . 
  bolting it to the table is pretty bad because you ca n't remove it when needed ( at least not very fast ) . 
  the best solution i came up with is to buy special fasteners and bolt them to the table instead . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.schnellspanner24.com/waagrechtspanner___schnellspanner_horizontal_sph-1-wf27kg201-a.html ) you can see how they look , but since i 'm german i really have no idea how they are called in english ... the literal translation would be `` horizontal fast-fasteners '' . 
  use 3 of them and bolt them around where you want your joystick to be . 
  the only thing you have to consider is that you need 3 little plates underneath the fasteners with the thickness of your joystick-plate with holes for the screws . 
  goddammit that would be a hilarious joke  next time, 
  honestly i did n't have much time to play anything since i got it today ... answering a reddit thread is fucking time consuming ... 
  i 'll play some in the next few hours and update you when i 'm done, 
  yeah did n't coolermaster show this absurd stacking tower where you can stack like 1 big tower on a small one and then stack 2 of the small ones above ? 
  for me it 's mostly because i always wanted a surround-monitor system but could n't stand the bezels .
