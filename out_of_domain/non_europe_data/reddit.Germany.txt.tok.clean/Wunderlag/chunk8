  i looked into it as i wanted to buy and use one myself , but the problem is that you ca n't use it for anything . 
  uploading to the internet requires you to pixelate all license plates and faces and you ( most likely ) ca n't use it for legal claims at all . 
  so there is absolutely no point in buying one in germany but for your own enjoyment .

  `` the unnoticeable filming of motorists and pedestrians on public roads is a significant intrusion into the informational self-determination law and fundamentally incompatible with the german data protection laws . '', 
  here in germany the gt starts at $ 40,000 :(, 
  not to unnecessarily alarm you , but if all signs are there and your period did n't start yet , there could ( and not must ) be something odd with your lady parts . 
  having a doctor check you is always a good thing and if you get sexually active that should be number one on your to-do list anyway . 
  wow , if i pay that much for things i expect the bill to be written with silver ink on fucking ivory slabs ( or at least handwritten on normal paper ) but not this shitty , thin pos paper ... 
   she hit you without letting you know !, 
  well ... 
  okay i do n't know what to say ... 
  i guess there are some other variables here . 
  first of all , there is the temperature of the pizza . 
  did you ever bite into a piece of hot salami pizza ? 
  that shit hurts . 
  also , if he assaults someone he does n't have a say in how the other reacts . 
  but then again , his `` reaction '' was far too long from the initial hit to be a immediate . 
  i guess in court this would have lashed out pretty hard against the puncher . 
  21:9 monitor does help ( [ see my rig ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/30laei/i_made_a_219_upgrade_to_my_flightsim/ ) ) but i played for years with a single 16:9 monitor and it was great all the time . 
  only thing i did n't like at first was the price , but it was still absolutely worth it !, 
  my god , the use of `` alte '' ( `` old woman '' ? ), 
  is fucking horrible ... 
  there you go : / r/boltedontits, 
  i 'm honestly trying to understand what went through their minds while doing this shit . 
  was she once raped by cops while being searched ? 
  did they watch too much bad cops stuff on tv ? 
  is she just mentally ill ? 
  was there anything illegal in the car ? 
  i am pretty confident that gta 5 has at least 3 hours of cutscenes and it does n't bother anyone . 
  what i 'm saying is that 3 hours of cutscenes are okay if the game lenght supports it . 
  wait a minute , there is no requirement for cars nor trucks to put on snow tires on snowy/icy roads ? 
  the du/sie thing is n't that complicated . 
  just think of it as a replacement for sir/madam . 
  if you would adress the other with sir/madam you should adress them with sie , if not then with du . 
   `` i 'm gon na sue bigfoot ** in bigfoot-court ** for trespassing on my property and obstructing my right to travel freely . 
  they do n't exist though . '', 
  ftfy, 
  is this spoiler free ? 
  i really really want to watch it but i do n't want to get spoiled :(, 
  nice thanks !, 
  is there any footage that 's downloadable with at least 1080p60 ? 
  youtube rapes the quality too much and i 'd prefer some raw footage, 
  you have to watch the overhead signs . 
  it 's the same in germany , as in you should ( have to ? ), 
  use the emergency lane if the signs tell you to , the solid line essentially becomes a dotted line . 
  they mostly do it based on traffic statistics to get more lanes when there is peak traffic . 
  best unofficial music video ever, 
  aaand it actually works pretty decently . 
  if you need a rough plan of the shape it 's okay as it is , if you need better measurements , just go ahead and put in 2 wall lenghts by hand and the rest gets recalculated . 
  you can also connect rooms with doors and add windows . 
  it works with your accelerometer which means that you have to make the transitions between walls slowly and evenly for best results . 
  i used it while looking for a new appartment and just asked the owners if i could take a minute to measure the rooms to see if my stuff fits . 
  all were amazed by it and i guess you leave a pretty good impression because i got a positive answer after all sightings . 
  meeh , it worked for me more accurately when i tried it but maybe it 's personal preference or skill to move evenly ? 
  idk, 
  they mostly were private persons and no realtors and those who had floor plans had rough outlines with some but almost no measures in them . 
  well ... she failed [ horribly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9dwseeq.jpg ), 
  it took some real effort to get in there by herself since she got that mentality in the first place, 
  ( horrible readability on mobile ), 
  why even have an attendant then ? 
  here in germany and austria there are super cheap gas stations where there is absolutely no personnel at all . 
  you just stop , attach the hose to the car , turn around and put in your ec - or credit-card . 
  then the gas starts going and when you stop and `` hang up '' your card is used to pay . 
  hit the big red button i guess , never tried it . 
  maybe there is even some electronic stuff in there . 
  how unfortunate that his phone died ... i guess i got ta belief that the cops left empty handed !, 
  i 'm pretty sure that if he had just answered the question of his age properly and friendly and maybe got into a little chit chat about that the officer would n't even have asked about the id . 
  that would have taken something about under a minute and all would be good . 
  wait , what ? 
  you ca n't enter national parks at night in usa ? 
  maybe even a little too smart-ass-y , at least in germany i feel like that could backfire, 
  so , i work as a manager in quality control department at a metal manufacturer and am in constant contact witch my colleagues where i have to tell them what they did wrong . 
  my advice is :, 
  1 ) be professional all the time . 
  do n't take anything personal and assume that mistakes are always by accident . 
  2 ) be ready to receive and give constructive criticism . 
  try to give a well thought through alternative or solution but without any pressure , just mention it on the side and do n't tell them `` i told you '' afterwards . 
  3 ) if you talk german , all of your higher ups are to be addressed with `` sie '' , the english equivalent would be `` sir '' om `` madam '' . 
  you may call colleagues on and under your level by `` du '' , but you 'll be save to address people more than 20 years older than you by `` sie '' too . 
  they may offer you `` du '' by themselves after some time . 
  4 ) work fast and efficient . 
  try to improve yourself and your surroundings the best you can . 
  if feel your workflow should be different or changed pitch the idea to your superior . 
  there may be a reason why it is done that way and simple ideas may have already been tried and failed for some reason . 
  5 ) i do n't know if this is a difference , but a german greeting between two business persons goes as follows ( at least i do it that way ) : make eye contact , do n't be shy -- approach and say `` hallo '' or `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' while you reach out your right hand for a handshake -- shake hand with a firm grip , try to match the other party 's pressure -- while shaking hands continue with '' * lastname * * firstname * mein name '' -- while shaking hands nod your head slightly . 
  joghurt and nutella are neither masculine nor feminine ... 
  if you need her name for scientific purposes , it 's roxy raye, 
  oh i always fucking love it when people drive like they really really have to be somewhere fast , overtake in super dangerous situations and stick to your ass like glue and 10 minutes later you catch up to them easily despite driving normal because they are stuck in traffic xd, 
  also , i think his left front turn signal is broken, 
  dude , the modmic alone is over 40 $, 
  everyone is recommending this , but there are certainly some drawbacks :, 
  - you have to manage 2 cables, 
  - there is no mute button for the mic, 
  - this mic is somewhat okay , but you have to clip it on your shirt, 
  - when the mic is moving you got scratching noises, 
  i was using a g35 for ages and since everyone was recommending this setup and i got some money to spend , i bought 5 top headphones for 200-300 $ ( sennheiser pc 363d , sony mdrma900 , sennheiser hd 598 , beyerdynamic dt-990 , akg k 701 ) , 2 clip-on mics ( zalman and some 2 $ china-thing ) and an asus xonar dx . 
  in the end i returned all of those things because nothing came close to the utility and functions of the g35 . 
  no question , some headphone sound better , but the buttons , auto-mute and mute button , pretty decent mic and volume control combined with the 300 $ upgrade price made me really rethink all of this .
