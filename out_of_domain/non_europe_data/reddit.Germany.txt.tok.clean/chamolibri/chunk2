  why make something like that part of your identity ? 
  i started drinking alcohol . 
  does n't sound like much but i had successfully abstained from it for more than 20 years all the way through several festivals and all so everyone just knew me as `` does n't drink '' . 
  shit happened , went through a messy break-up and decided i needed more distractions so i started going out a lot more and subsequently drinking . 
  pretty much took all my family and old friends completely by surprise but they adjusted to it quickly as `` he 's finally become normal '' and now i drink occasionally and i 'm fine with it . 
  awesome thing . 
  thanks a million , man !, 
  only downside is that google ony has . pdf and smashwords requires a login . 
  then again i 'm bitching over a gift horse so there 's that .

  thanks for the advice , i 'll give it a go . 
  glad to hear your body has its priorities straight in critical poop-or-die situations . 
  dunno ... i get the feeling that all these really smart people claiming that ( a ) we might be living inside a simulation designed by an advanced civilization or ( b ) we might actually be something like a zoo for an advanced civilization or similar ideas are somewhat desperately looking for an explanation for all this shit other than `` by and large people are stupid assholes '' . 
  i admire their attempts at avoiding cynicism , but that 's what i think it is : some way , any way to avoid becoming a cynic . 
  i do n't think about it . 
  i am aware of it happening somewhere in the periphery of my perception and occasionally glance over but australia is literally half a world away and i have more pressing matters on my mind . 
  level design that requires you to fail at least once in order to succeed . 
  i do n't mean challenging design that demands a certain amount of skill or reflexes in order to pass a given trap/obstacle/enemy / anything but rather design where you enter a room from a slightly wrong direction and die immediately . 
  jumping puzzles with fixed camera angles where you see the right direction to jump after you jumped the wrong way and landed in the lava , that sort of thing . 
  so yeah ... obligatory failure due to level design . 
  `` slim version '' of the ps2 and jak 3 . 
  awesome game , great gameplay , mechanics and story and still one of my all time favourites even after 11 years , although nostalgia may play a part in that . 
  yep , pretty much that . 
  the principle is about as advanced as it gets but in the end the most feasibly way to actually do anything with the energy is to boil water and turn turbines . 
  which is also obviously why water leaking from a nuclear power plant is almost always really really bad and unhealthy . 
  depends . 
  as / u/rannasha explained accurately :, 
   in some designs , the coolant fluid is used to boil the water that will power the turbines , while in others water is the coolant and it is boiled directly by the heat of the reactor . 
  you would n't want to just dump the water back into some river in the latter concept . 
  thank you for the detailed insight and the expansion of my limited knowledge on the subject !,

  ah , the good ol' [ double tap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_tap#other_uses_of_the_term ) . 
  * one on my arm from cutting . 
  * one on my forehead from the glorious attempt to drop a bouncy ball into a lego-gateway from the top of the back of an armchair on my brother 's third birthday which resulted in the armchair falling over and me hitting my head on the corner of one of our living room speakers . 
  boy was that fun !, 
  eh ... in comparison to fc2 , i think fc3 and 4 have definitely made vast progress regarding the whole stealth gameplay , enemy ai , etc. 
  but i liked the variety of different characters in fc2 , the `` looseness '' of the story and most of all the fact , that every playable character was a professional in some way or another . 
  former mercs , mossad , ira , some other form of `` freedom fighters '' ... they all had reasonable military experience , had to abandon their old `` careers '' for some reason and were now doing contract killing for a living and that was it . 
  plus the fact that the only way to get better in fc2 was to buy new weapons or to actually get better at the game . 
  considering mankind 's overall creativity when it comes to killing , we would have probably shot them all down sooner or later . 
  [ without a doubt ] ( https://www.statista.com/chart/2203/the-worlds-deadliest-animals/ ) ... but does drinking our blood and thereby transferring potentially deadly germs into us qualify as `` higher in the food chain '' ? 
  wait ... was that `` release brakes '' - feature in fc3 or was that a new addition in fc4 ? 
  yeah , that one got a bit out of hand . 
  also imo this gem of a game fully deserves every bit of money you throw at it . 
  idk ... it might be different with a random person but with my current gf i know her hygiene standards , i know mine , so i know worst thing is be a little bit of dick-taste when kissing and that 's it . 
  i tend to underestimate my own strength and in the process unintentionally hurt a girl and since i know about the issue i prefer being too cautious over actually causing physical harm . 
  if i am being told to go rough explicitly , it 's a different story , though .

  i ca n't decide whether you are actually german or just have a good grasp of the language . 
  regardless , reading this as a german , it is utterly hilarious and absolutely awesome . 
  well done !, 
  edit : i would give you a funny look for some of those words , though . 
  once upon a time ( like , really ... nearly eight years back ) i went on a holiday with my mother , her then-boyfriend , my brother and my then-girlfriend . 
  i do n't remember much of that holiday except the fact that one night my gf and i decided to give rape-y stuff a try ( retrospect : who calls sex that ? 
  o.o ) and after about five centimetres and an equal amount of seconds i was done , she was deflowered and we decided to let it rest until we were both of age ... only to go back at it the next evening and the one after that and so forth . 
  i would change it to `` morgenlattenpinkelerm\u00f6glichungswandanlehnen '' , though , because `` morgenlatte '' is much more common than `` morgenst\u00e4nder '' , as is `` pinkeln '' instead of `` pieseln '' . 
  this could either be a sign of healthy expectations ( self-sufficiency , etc. ), 
  or a sign of laziness ( yay for free maintenance !, 
  i am no linguist but i would reckon that `` pieseln '' is more common to older generations . 
  judging from my everyday experience `` pinkeln '' is more commonly/colloquially used but i could n't reliably tell you just exactly * how * much more common it actually is . 
  parents decided to get a divorce after my father tried to kill himself and spent some time in the hospital for psychiatric treatment for depression following that . 
  i do n't know * why * exactly they decided to go their separate ways and i never asked but i always assumed that it was something along the lines of my mother not being able to deal with that and my father not being fulfilled with their marriage or something similar . 
  seeing how they both have changed after more than a decade of not being together any more i find it hard to believe they once found something that made them want to get married in the first place but at least they both seem to be much happier the way it is now and they get along as well as one could hope . 
  as for me ... i think the largest effect was that i * hate * any sort of lingering discomfort/unresolved issues . 
  i am extremely keen on talking through any trouble there might be just to be sure there is nothing brewing under the surface that 's going to bite me in the ass some day without warning .

  far northern germany ) , so my knowledge and grasp of bavarian dialect is incomplete at best . 
  reading it makes it seem much more serious than it feels to me . 
  or i am just used to it because it 's part of my life . 
  could n't complain at all . 
  i get along fine with both of them , they get along ( relatively ) fine ( needless to say , they do n't actively seek to hang out but with two sons , christmas , birthdays , etc. 
  it 's impossible for them * not * to meet occasionally . ), 
  and all in all i would say everything went better than expected . 
  less offensive than `` pissen '' , yes , but `` pinkeln '' and `` pieseln '' are about equally ( un ) offensive , i think . 
  the relation there is about the same as between `` piss '' and `` pee '' . 
  because it 's an easy way to `` get back '' at you for hurting his feelings . 
  he obviously did n't think you were ugly when you started going out on dates , so there 's that . 
  and even though you were as civil and polite as you could have been in that situation and made it perfectly clear that your rejection had nothing to do with any flaws of his , that nagging feeling of inadequacy remains . 
  after all you * told * him he was a great guy and he * knows * himself to be a great guy so why oh why was n't he great enough for you ? 
  what did he do wrong ? 
  what mistake did he make that apparently was so bad , you would n't even tell him to his face ? 
  bottom line , i think it 's a coping mechanism born from some degree of insecurity and telling himself ( and you ) that you were n't physically attractive enough for him , anyway , makes it easier for him to accept your rejection . 
  not saying that this is right or that you should have to accept it because it is n't and you should n't but i think that 's the main reason for his behaviour . 
  i do n't know if this still qualifies as `` punk '' but i find bands like flogging molly , the real mckenzies or the dropkick murphys quite enjoyable . 
  they do however mix `` classic '' punk-motives with traditional irish or scottish instruments and elements . 
  other than that modern hardcore really does the trick for me when it comes to motivational music ( e.g. 
  workout ) . 
  stick to your guns and hatebreed would be some more brutal bands from that direction while rise against have evolved so far away from their roots that their more recent stuff can hardly be called punk or hardcore any more but i still find their music and message convincing . 
  ^ that 's ^ because ^ they 're ^ actually ^ germans . 
  and judging from that look it feels extremely violated in a private moment . 
  he 's completely right , of course .
