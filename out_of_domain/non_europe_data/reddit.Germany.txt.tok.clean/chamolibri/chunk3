  one should keep the friend-making-attire and the boob-showing-attire strictly separate and take tremendous care not to get them mixed up . 
  imagine the consequences . 
  think of the kids !, 
  although , i hate to admit it , my first thought upon seeing your profile pic was `` heh , boobs . '' . 
  still ... what a douche . 
  [ who hurt you ? 
  \\ whispers \\ who hurt you ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glcjwdaus4c ), 
  have n't played primal nor seen any let 's plays of the game , yet . 
  what 's the context of the situation there ? 
  do you just barge in on it , take notice and move on , do you interrupt by barging in , are you actively encouraged to step in ? 
  the point in this particular bit is rape occurring in a ceremony meant to `` unleash the warrior '' in jason , i.e. 
  uplift him in some way and not just as something that happens and is to be abhorred . 
  for once that . 
  plus as far as i see it , most of those atrocities are atrocities committed by vaas and his pirates or hoyt and his mercs . 
  you as the player on the other hand are portrayed as a rightful fighter for the islanders ' liberty , thus justifying your actions as a means to a noble end . 
  although - as was mentioned above - i am pretty sure jason and his naivete are mostly used and abused by citra and dennis as a symbol for their cause . 
  good point . 
  i actually never really thought about it as jason being used but more about him going crazy bit by bit , but your point does make a lot of sense . 
  especially in the lights of citra murdering you - if you chose to kill your friends and stay with her - while telling you that your son would make an awesome shining leader for the rakyat . 
  so yeah ... that definitely adds to the `` jason is a means to an end for her '' - thought . 
  this is a long shot , but i guess most players see it as `` yay , boobs ! '', 
  and then move on to use the newly unlocked abilities to kill more pirates/mercs and become even more awesome . 
  i have to admit , i have n't played any game of the f.e.a.r. 
  series , so no , i do n't know which scene . 
  shame on me . 
  you are entirely right concerning changing art for reasons of political correctness and omitting important bits of a character 's development in order to avoid poking some people the wrong way . 
  ( i know she kills you if you decide to stay with her ... talk about an abusive relationship if i 've ever seen one . 
  / u/partyonalec and / u/2 _ wycked elaborated on the point of citra and dennis using jason pretty well . ), 
  + use money to buy a large tv , an inflatable pool and lots of beer . 
  + get drunk with germans in pool with rubber duck present while watching the olympics go to shit all by themselves . 
   [ ... ] you are there to work not push your religious views in someones face . 
  i get the sentiment , but i think there 's a huge difference between wearing something as a sign of your affiliation with a certain religious group and pushing your views in someone 's face . 
  as long as you do n't go around preaching or harassing people this should not be an issue . 
  and finally we are talking about fashion choices . 
  sure , these particular ones ( crosses , hijab , etc. ), 
  are based on religious beliefs but as long as what you wear is no open insult to anyone , nobody should give damn . 
  hijabs and other head scarves can be a sign of submission to some , they can be a symbol of empowerment ( i.e. 
  avoiding objectification ) to others or they can just as well be an entirely meaningless item of clothing . 
  religious headdresses are n't that uncommon , just look at kippas in judaism , turbans in sikhism , head scarves in islam and ( more orthodox ) christianity . 
  none of those are an open insult to anyone by themselves , save to those who feel insulted by the presence of a certain religious group . 
  edit : spelling, 
  because while * we * perceive it as an act of oppression or submission to have women cover their hair and breasts , other cultures perceive it as an act of over-sexualisation and objectification to have women dress in a revealing way and promote * that * as a good thing . 
  cultures differ and people make their life choices in part based on their background . 
  as long as nobody gets harmed in the process people should be allowed to wear , say and do whatever they want and should not be judged for it . 
  bottom line : as long as wearing a hijab does not compromise workplace safety , there is no reason not to wear one . 
  the same goes for any other item of clothing , religious or otherwise . 
  i did n't feel like going the roughly ten kilometres to her place by bike anymore as summer turned to fall turned to winter and the weather conditions got harsher . 
  felt like too much of an effort at the time . 
  broke up via sch\u00fclervz ( an early facebook-predecessor ) and then ignored her completely . 
  this was in secondary school , we were 15 and i was a premium ass . 
  that 's a cicada as far as i can tell . 
  `` fuck you , your possessions and your life choices . 
  buy me expensive stuff for the privilege of being my boyfriend . 
  please suck up to me after i was a major cunt , so you can still have a chance at buying me stuff to be my boyfriend . '', 
  \\ - what ? 
  also depends on the inexperienced party 's attitude . 
  inexperienced and willing to try new stuff and explore boundaries ? 
  i 'm all for that . 
  somewhat condescending whiteknight meets somewhat misogynist neckbeard . 
  what a strange occurrence . 
  i do n't know for sure . 
  i am merely assuming from the title of an other post with that same screenshot ( only the first one , though ) and the fact that i have seen this text being ridiculed both on here and on / r/justneckbeardthings before . 
  i might be wrong , i do n't know . 
  why twice ? 
  i get the idea of rubbing one out before certain decisions to ensure that possible horniness or sexual frustration play a lesser role in the final outcome . 
  but why twice ? 
  on that topic ( and also somewhat off-topic ) :, 
  i do consider myself politically left-wing but a huge problem i have with a fair amount of other people describing themselves as left-wing - and therefore anti-racist - is the idea that racist/sexist/whatever behaviour ** from ** an `` oppressed minority '' directed ** at ** the perceived `` oppressor '' is ok because that minority does n't have the definatory power in order for it to * really * be bad . 
  ironically i find that both racist/sexist/whatever and hypocritical because to me it implies that said minority is too unimportant for their flaws to matter and it goes against the basic left-wing principle of fighting ** all ** racism/sexism/whatever . 
  what comes to mind :, 
  * the main characters from the prototype series . 
  super humans who would literally rip apart entire platoons of soldiers , toss around heavy weaponry like it 's nothing and above all that could also assume another human 's shape so they could be disguised as anybody around you and strike at any time ? 
  * same goes for corvo or daud from dishonored - at least if you do n't go for the ghost-achievement as a player . 
  guys could teleport , move at immense speed ( i.e. 
  slow time ) , summon those plague rats , take over other people and much more ... if i knew those guys were out there and potentially after me i 'd be shitting myself . 
  i think generally every protagonist who is to some degree super powered and unstoppable is absolutely terrifying because as a bad guy ( grunt ) you know there is nothing you can do against the hero except probably slightly delay him through the time it takes him to dismember you and all your friends/colleagues . 
  edit : phrasing . 
  `` simply because because you can breathe does n't mean you 're alive or that you really live . '', 
  i 'm sorry if i was n't clear in my original post . 
  yes , the movie gave a heavy hint * that * superman was dead , what with the casket showing as they talked about how he was gone , but never made clear * how and why * and that was extremely confusing since i was n't entirely certain whether or not superman was dead , or had just left earth following someone else 's death , or any other reason . 
  edit : like i said : i did n't watch the previous movies as i 'm not really interested in superman so i expected the main hero of the previous movies to be alive and well and just not involved in this movie . 
  if it were an obvious sequel to the other movies i would completely support you there ; but as a supposed standalone-movie i would have expected more context and less confusion . 
  civil war for instance is fully titled `` cpt . 
  america : civil war '' , making it obvious that you should at least have watched `` cpt . 
  america : the first avenger '' and `` cpt . 
  america : winter soldier '' for context and background . 
  which is german for `` extra thick '' . 
  agreed , it 's an awesome anthem , althoug i think the [ anthem of the soviet union ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bulfwgsi8bc ) still trumps it . 
  penis is a masculine noun . 
  just a socially awkward/inept geek who loves his stuff with a passion and has a few quirks/is lazy . 
  i did indeed just assume the gender of all the penises . 
  technically speaking , yes . 
  but very basic compared to machines , weight racks , etc. 
  in my opinion and experience they are more than sufficient for a proper workout , though . 
  i 've been working out for years with nothing more than that and the results have been great . 
  well , you 're still talking about gaining 14kg so most of all , that 's going to take time and dedication but should be very much doable with what you have . 
  / u/mycrowesoft is right about the bench as well , i think . 
  made me realize : i do n't regret sleeping with anyone i have slept with . 
  some of them i do n't particularly like anymore and some i have never seen or talked to again but apart from that , it was nice when it happened and so far nothing bad has come off it .
