  i 'd think you 're one of the students that take their time to study ... 3-4 semesters behind maybe ? 
  i think he went north-east, 
  1437 is with secret since quite some time in case you missed that . 
  do mek and guardian greaves stack ? 
  do multiple guardians stack ? 
  then it is a car mod you do n't like , and not one that was done a shitty way . 
  atos clinkz sounds fun and i can see the synergy - he 's on my hero challenge atm so i might try that in an unranked match , thanks !, 
  i guess diffu was meant to be for clinkz , 
  but i 'm german and if someone introduces hinself as edward i do n't call him eduard - it seems strange to me to translate names . 
  i think they only started interfering when they trash talked about one of their sponsors ( vulcun ) which seems right to me . 
  as long as it is friendly banter i am totally fine with it, 
  does it make sense to not level up storm ult because you can jump faster ? 
  i think most of his damage does not come from the ult anyway : s, 
  you look like a cool guy to hang out with , but also like you will get annoying when you 're drunk, 
  sorry , but this was definately the first time i saw you :d, 
  but cool that i guessed right !, 
  nyx ? 
  i have that . 
  can make a vid for you next week when i am home again , 
  it actually works pretty well , but only with the built-in bowl which is tiny - so pretty short smoking times . 
  does not get hot outside though , only warm . 
  i think i got it as a gift from ebay . 
  hi guys , i use the elementary weather plugin , but how do i change location ? 
  it assigned a city close to me automatically , but not directly my town : s, 
  well , if you did not point that out then i 'd still have believed that was the sub . 
  especially with female pheromones and 55 gallons of lube ... 
  close to my story , i had it back when having an ingame overlay was revolutionary - and me and two friends till use it until today . 
  it was cool to have them both visible instantly and i liked that it was easy to chat with . 
  btw i saw this !, 
  do you know in which file it is ? 
  i have looked multiple times but it seems like i am just too dumb to find it :(, 
  bur why are the programs german then ? 
  did he really think that excuse would make it any better ? 
  that 's beautiful . 
  relax , you 're doing fine . 
  he is fat, 
  he is gay, 
  he is always in the way, 
  jeez i cant wait to play that ugly motherfucker, 
  3400 solo mmr , muted a lot ? 
  1 cost more for you roping ? 
  but valid point , unfortunately, 
  from a non-american point of view : i wished people like you stayed there and became a person of influence . 
  i rarely see opinions like that rise up from people living there , and even the persons i think of as very smart seem to have that `` weird '' side . 
  michelin-tyre drivers withdrawed as michelin said their tyres would probably make it 10 laps - the wikipedia article is pretty large, 
  take a look at the logitech g700s - i love that thing . 
  not sure if it 's too expensive though, 
  yes of course , but i hope it was n't more than 2 bucks ... 
  except this `` burger '' actually tastes ... 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ american ^ ^ ^ beers , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ lot ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ crappy ^ ^ ^ stuff ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ opinion, 
  well , that is ridiculous . 
  glados . 
  no way you do n't like that villain ai , great voicelines , even a great storyline - and incredibly fun to play with and against . 
  1581508602 my first one ever to submit here - we will see how you handle the action and if you can spot the mistakes made , 
  very cool , hope you like it , 
  is your piss bright green ? 
   uh that 's my point you dumb worthless cockroach . 
  i 'm sure people will now notice how good your arguments are , you really showed that guy, 
  3mm - hair length . 
  would look good on you , though i can understand you not cutting it !, 
  791 - really big sky or sleeping dogs !, 
  thanks for the giveaway !, 
  well , if you enjoyed the game i prefer to wait for the full cast - if you do n't want to cast it again audio only is fine for me too , 
  or see all with one look while in a teamfight and asking yourself who to save . 
  after reading this comment the fifth-sixth time i finally understood who roy is :[, 
  sorry , will post a suggestion to remove the mouse cursor for an increased skillcap and less clumsyness !, 
  are pc parts priced `` normally '' in your country ? 
  if yes , why the fuck do people buy consoles ? 
  it does n't even make sense at normal prices !, 
  iirc my calcumator used it to show fractions . 
  no idea why though ( 2/3 --  2 \u00ac 3 ), 
  okay , i actually thought the thread would go on and create a therapist-themed reddit-bot , until i finally noticed the username of the guy after reading the whole comment chain . 
  i 'm a dumbus . 
  but `` w / '' then makes `` doubleyouslash '' and not `` with '' :|, 
  oh god , that makes it even better, 
  it is one page claiming that a month ago , no other sources confirming this - come on . 
  what do you do today ? 
  you seem like a smart kid at the pics , i am curious what direction you went, 
  my first title actually had us in them , but i broke rule 2 - so i just quickly resubmitted with another title and forgot about that . 
  i see this the same as you , as i am not a us-citizen myself , 
  how i skill her : net first , keep at lvl 1 , max rip tide , then illus - ult at 6 . 
  i think net is too much value out of one point to skip it , another point in illus early on is not that much of a gamebreaker - but net can be . 
  i buy stout shield and quelling + regen , then get stick aquila and brown boots and proceed to farm radiance . 
  after that straight travels and rat the shit out of them . 
  manta next , then octarine core , granting you 100 % uptime on illus , ridiculous tp and ult cd , and lifesteal from radiance . 
  next items are whatever fits vest , diffu/skadi/mkb / bfly etc. 
  note that this requires a team with lots of utility and good at fighting from behind , because that 's what you will need the first 25 minutes . 
  i know there are other builds , but if i want to rat - naga is my way to go . 
  well , i once did that to a guy whose mother died of cancer 2 weeks earlier ( i did not know that ) . 
  he got pretty mad and i can understand that , though i do n't think that these jokes are an insult to that specific person . 
  i do n't think a your-mother-joke has ever been meta in a way like this one, 
  what i really wonder : where the hell do you get all of your stuff ? 
  to me it looks like when reddit stuff just gets copied to 9gag , but you seem at the top of the chain . 
  this reminds me so much of the guy that shopped meepo 's face onto all the other heroes, 
  but ... i can still see it ? 
  i do n't know ... 
  he 's at least trying to come up with something you can call `` strat '' himself , but at the same time does n't realize how terrible it is ... : /, 
  yep !, 
  in esslingen though , but a really great restaurant with actual greek food ( gyros-free ! ), 
  my personal tio is to order masses of vorspeisen and eat yourself through all of that .
