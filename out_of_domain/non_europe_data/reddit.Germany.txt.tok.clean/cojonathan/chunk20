  i had a shortened clarity for a while as text tone, 
  got my kr51/2 2 days ago , 
  then it still was a hell of a party, 
  out 5stack queued for 15 minutes and then we decided to play source 1 again : /, 
  791 - i got my first motorized vehicle ever - a scooter . 
  i am almost 23 . 
  i love it . 
  was n't secret 's only goal to win ti ? 
  if they still stand to that point , i doubt they will stick together . 
  but maybe they found more in this team than just the dream of winning ti ... 
  that team was just so likeable , was n't it ? 
  like throwing the nicest guys in one team , which actually appeared to be quite good, 
  somebody make him an evil marketing genius !!, 
  alliance and eg are actually the same organisation, 
  well you made millions smile or laugh when seeing it , do n't be sad , 
  ... he did well so far, 
  there also is the `` subreddit '' called / r/suspiciousquotes which should be `` the same '', 
  moustaches are * cool * !, 
  in addition to the ones already posted , / r/nostupidquestions is a cool sub for any type of questions . 
  aui is available ... oh :(, 
  from my perspective , and holy fuck it is only the stuff i experienced , not the opinion everyone should have , kuro has always been nice in public , while argeezy almost always had that douchy attitude . 
  even though it was meant to be jokes from rtz , i have never witnessed any bad manner or anything from kuro and even when talking in ti-hubs or anything he always seemed like a humble guy . 
  i really dont care much about rtz , but i dont think kuro is that bad of a person . 
  also i just realized how fucking weird this `` drama '' is ... 
  i think strax is the best character in the whole show . 
  everybody is always so smart and violence is the last way for anybody , and then there 's potato-head not understanding genders and solving basic problems with grenades . 
  i do n't browse this sub frequently because i am a bit behind on episodes , but i doubt anybody loves strax that much . 
  but zai said so, 
  did n't think of that one actually . 
  thanks !, 
  that sound cut makes me feel uncomfortable, 
  at the same time , why should n't he also try his best with a lower tier team - wo n't be bad for his casting and maybe he can grab a bit of cash . 
  what audi is that ? 
  it looks veyron-ish, 
  e : 3rd on page 5, 
  well , if the verge used `` kappa '' `` pogchamp '' or other cancerous emoticons it would be by +4 k now, 
  i love how imgur users downvote it thinking it is just a picture of an aventador, 
  playing the didgeridoo, 
  might be perspective , too , but the first one is a guy i 'd hang out with . 
  so definately first one !, 
  also you seem a bit insecure on the pics and very insecure with that title despite there being no reason at first glance . 
  just chill , you 're likeable !, 
  79109 - rocket league !, 
  it looks like a lot of fun , but i think it 's too expensive to buy it myself . 
  i am actualy really sad that there are no new cards that make your opponent draw :(, 
  okay that 's awkward - that box is already ticked : /, 
  i think that worked - i was permanently just looking for unchecked boxes to activate it :d, 
  i actually think this might be to force people to play source 2, 
  not trying to fuck up your reflink but :, 
  is the 64-bit version actually stable now ? 
  though you will have to wait a lot longer to recieve , 
  i ordered mine to germany and waited about a month , but it is definately the same and of good quality . 
  i 'm rooting for alliance and vp and really hope 5jungz can bring back a bit of glory to the german dota scene . 
  looks pretty strong , hu ? 
  so this fucking gyazo shit is apparently taking me longer to load than you to upload, 
  very cool !, 
  they 've really come a long way !, 
  a smart is waaay safer than this one . 
  good to see that dunning-kruger is present at every skill bracket, 
  if you put it into a percentage compared to total germans , it is still a high number but way lower that other eu countries . 
  it 's so weird how europeans manage to drive their mobile homes , boats and other bigass trailers with compacts , is n't it ? 
  [ here , i have a random picture , too ] ( http://www.auto-news.de/webcore/data/content/auto_article_ext/24496_1243498945038.jpg ), 
  you do n't seem to realize that 100 hp already is plenty, 
  hey , that wallpaper-sub is awesome !, 
  / r/battlecars is cool , too !, 
  aghs looks a bit sloppy , does n't it ? 
  [ this pic older than the internet came to my mind ] ( http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/homer-cereal-epic-fail_3125.jpg ), 
  cool , danke !, 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , fuck my inbox :d, 
  schneider gelion 1 - though i doubt it is available anywhere else than germany and countries next to it, 
  / r/european is pretty full of hate against immigrants , the us and jews too , isnt it ? 
  but what if it all was a plot to bomb the president ? 
  oh god , thank you !, 
  i swear i searched their site but i must have done so miserably ... 
  mix it with vanilla , seriously - 1:1 up to 1:2 ( 1 vanilla ), 
  there are balls you can purchase that are extra heavy - train with one of these !, 
  there 's a difference between not stopping at a red light and dashing through it with 100mph . 
  do you have to be over 105 at the beginning or at the end of your `` sprint '' ? 
  so ... can i rush aghs on carry undying ? 
  i dunno , i thought wr was pretty strong last patch already and the overall nerfs for most mids ( bloodstone/bottle ) do not hurt her that much in comparison to others . 
  i think she will rise to a top pick . 
  the team he split up with , which is now doing better ? 
  why the fuck do they only do well when i 'm not watching , seriously, 
  what would you consider a better counterplay ? 
  just curious, 
  thank you , bot !, 
  thanks :d, 
  / r/anormaldayinrussia is russia-specific but could be what youre looking for, 
  i have a pretty good pc and it sometimes took me 2:50 , sometimes 30s ( not sure , but as fast as most fast guys load ) - it was really random , loading a game first did n't help . 
  a mate then told me to turn on vsync , now i am back to being one of the first to load again . 
  deleted, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wait ... 
  that 's not how resolution works :d, 
  that 's nice , thanks !, 
  not the original version but pretty close - if there is n't the `` real '' one , this will do the job , 
  title says `` high resolution '', 
  i know how to rescale a picture - problem is that a 250px * 200px will look like shit on a a3 sheet of paper . 
  ( i want to make a sign for frankfurt ), 
  no they wo n't , and that 's why they are above 5k .
