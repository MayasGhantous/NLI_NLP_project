  edit : how do i format the code correctly on mobile ? 
  well that could of course be . 
  but then , why is one behaving differently ? 
  i even exchanged transistors but it did not help, 
  thanks , that sould clean it up . 
  i think that the inverse outputs might be the transistors inverting - so that means only one pin is * actually * inverted . 
  so the easiest `` fix '' would be switching pins i guess, 
  oooh !, 
  audpin is meant to be the analog input pin 5 !, 
  how are these numbered ? 
  that 's it :d, 
  yeah i just tried that and it seems to work . 
  only problem now is that the visuals are now flickering a lot , will see how to fix that ( guess i have to do that via code ), 
   - bug description :, 
  has 6 legs , can go invis and back in time, 
   - your steam profile link ( ** important ** ) :, 
   - match id ( ** important ** ) :, 
   - any other helpful information :, 
  `` time ant '' would suit him more, 
   thank you . 
  you 're welcome, 
  i have a mate who only played on weekends - that was during his time he got to soend home during his time in jail ( how the fuck is this called ? ) . 
  he finally got out and climbed from 4k to 5k in a month, 
  what about it was irregular ? 
  also knallrot ? 
  can you give some song examples ? 
  i think as bundeskanzler he was generally recieved as `` okay '' - other than merkel who is more loved or hated . 
  however as he started to work for gazprom and basically sold his soul after his political career ended left a bitter taste to his former decisions . 
  lovely , thank you !, 
  gut !, 
  mod comment answering the question because he is happy that there is at least some sort of traffic in his sunreddit, 
  untasteful joke about the incident, 
  comment stating that many people are new and have not seen that post yet, 
  that was less magical than i expected :(, 
  how many buttons/switches do they actually use during a race and are not just `` settings '' ? 
  i have no clue about f1 but i ca n't imagine more than shifting and steering being done with that thing, 
  probiere eeees !!, 
  very cool , thanks !, 
  super name . 
  i mean you can just buy it when you 've pretty much won already, 
   rdfd, 
  rdfd, 
  i think the order was random for everybody, 
  if i was in that boat , then i 'd prefer not to know, 
  this must be the most ridiculous fix i 've ever seen ... i would not have found that `` solution '', 
  nice . 
  sorte ?
