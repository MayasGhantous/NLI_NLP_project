  alch does not fit here, 
  reading through all of this makes you look like a reaaally nice guy - what 's your ping to euw ? 
  if you want to play with me and my stupid friends from all over europe - my steamid is cheniejack , we usually take our time to find a 5stack  wo n't be online until next week though !, 
  i was just hoping for another panel :(, 
  kuro puppey funn1k aui_2000 fata - i am not sure but i think kuro and puppey are still friends , right ? 
  e : alternatively kuro fata - black ^ rmn - qojqva on the offlane . 
  i just want an all german mouz again :(, 
  finnebassen - you 're not cool enough, 
  eric prydz - every day, 
  kyrill & redford - somebody to love, 
  of my 80 + i have 3 xs , 3 xl and about 12 normal sized ones - so i seem to have a different pattern than most here, 
  what is your favourite meal ? 
  and snack ? 
  iirc you can calibrate at around 4.5 k - leaving you with 20 wins left to 4k , so at least 30 wins . 
  if we assume a win rate of 75 % that makes around 60 games , and if we also assume a game and search time of 45 minutes per game you get around 6.67 per hour . 
  i mean that 's not too bad if you live in poorer countries - plus you just play some dotes, 
  [ n ] ice, 
  that is a pretty crappy aghs though :d, 
  it is not even a second of stun for 4200 gold - it indeed does, 
  thinking of it , it would be very gimmicky in a rat-based lineup with underlord or sth ... wait for 2 people to teleport in , interrupt the rest immediately and then push their shit out :d, 
  bh : money printer, 
  but the ocean for example is not as detailed - the lower levels do n't exist there . 
  nice !, 
  me too !, 
  of course they are noticeable , but i think they look far less than 600k on first sight . 
  death prophet !, 
  sucker would be lutscher , 
  just do it !, 
  one thirs of it at least !, 
  oh whoopsie , when did i click * that * button on this random site ? 
  1790 - very nice !, 
  there might have happened something with right-extremists in the past ... 
  also , the german media is `` against '' every violent group of extremists . 
  just because there also are left-extremists makes the situation in bautzen not any bit better . 
  these people become increasingly violent against others , including terroristic acts - and that is something you should be against . 
  i just looked it up , in 2015 , there have been 5620 left-extremist delicts by a group of 26700 people . 
  right-extremist : 21933 by 22600 people . 
  so i guess , there also just is a lot more to tell news about , and in addition to that right-extremist violence often is against asylum-seekers , which are , of course , a highly debated topic in general . 
  there are quick tests for adults already , you look into a thing onto a picture and it immediately tells you what you will need - but less precise . 
  i do n't know how they work , but i guess those testing machines work for kiddos too, 
  now i want to buy a vocoder, 
  are you seriously mad at a fantasy creature which was drawn as a joke ? 
  or just make it an option !, 
  mmmh , bier !, 
  i think people should not be offended by the flags thrown , but by the players not being able to play after the rules . 
  i would love to own madden though ; __ ; fucking console exclusives, 
  woah - how is the modded game experience ? 
  i had no clue !, 
  edit : available only to customers in the us ... think a vpn can work around that ? 
  ist ein `` game of thrones '' - star . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not , no, 
  i read somewhere that you can add it to uplay but it is a bit of a workaround , lem me google it - that would be huge !, 
  what 's your perfect one ? 
  but only if there was a door when they lived in that house !, 
  / r/battlecars !, 
  do you have anything paired with it ? 
  you look very serious . 
  i like that the glasses are not all black, 
  comment praising the shitty art over the top just to make sure artist does not commit suicide after all the negative comments so far \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661,

  i have n't seen anybody triggered that hard for quite a long time . . 
  wow those are some great games to give away !, 
  i would love to have mafia 3 . 
  i 've been a huge fan of mafia 2 , played it multiple times . 
  i would like to play mafia 3 , but it 's too expensive for me atm , and i do n't want to buy it via shady websites like g2a . 
  great giveaway !, 
  holy crap , i love this :d, 
  ~ ~ i would choose the [ htc vive ] ( https://www.amazon.de/dp/b01gg2fmv2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_iwdgybx9wnkjb ) , and while we are at it my gtx 760 would not handle that - so i would like a [ gtx 1080 ] ( https://www.amazon.de/dp/b01gcavsio/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_irdgybhtadd29 ) ( and maybe [ 16 gigs of ram ] ( https://www.amazon.de/dp/b00n9pvxjk/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_wxdgybcbbmf0h ) ) ! ~ ~, 
  edit : fuck this , my cpu is too weak also - and being on an 1156 socket , i need a new mother board as well ... time to pick together a pc !, 
  edit again : well , that [ escalated ] ( https://www.alternate.de/html/configurator/builder/loadsharedconfiguration.html?kind=pcbuilder&amp;id=a99a4a74836d7f0842a61bb62413081b ) quite a bit ... 
  ... do i need a 4k screen , too ? 
  very nicely done !, 
  how long did it take you ? 
  how many hours have you put in ? 
  nope , you 're correct . 
  just plug into the back of your graphics card ( you will see it while installing ) , that 's all you need to do , 
  do you have a link to that wallpaper ? 
  it looks like a mix of two of my favourite ones :d, 
  definately should try that , it obly recently got added to steam beta, 
  yeah , i was guessing so . 
  do you think upgrading parts makes any sense , or should i just throw out some cash in ~ 2 years and get a whole new rig ? 
  guess i will have to finish studying first - at least i know what to spend my first paycheck on !, 
  headset was only having sound on one ear , so i decided to take it apart and watch for loose contacts - there were none i could find . 
  then i decided to isolate the mic , as that was its sole purpose left anyways , and fucked it up :d so i had one working speaker left and used it as my new mic . 
  but it 's my birthday soon , so this is only a temporary solution !, 
  ha , thanks / u/automoderator - first time i am not missing my cakeday :d, 
  there you go :d, 
  yeah , i was also really surprised - but it could be a lot better too , 
  yep !, 
  got the closed ones , too - amazing for so little bucks !, 
  it 's literally just the speaker steippwd out of the headset and plugged into the mic slot :d, 
  the noise around was recorded way louder than my voice ( stuff like tiping on my keyboard etc ) so i used the tube to have the mic `` directed '' onto me . 
  no idea if that worked the way i thought , but it helped !,
