  amazing , especially for how little they cost . 
  depending on your preferences you also can get the closed ones , which i have too !, 
  us amazon link - the difference is on the piece pointing outwards from the head . 
  it does not have the little holes in it ( wich is `` open '' ) , so it blocks noise better ( and does not let the headphone sound out that much ) . 
  not very complicated , just if you prefer a bit more acoustic isolation , 
  i ca n't do anything against it , so i decided to accept it . 
  ca n't be that bad i guess , because most of my buddies ' accents are way worse ( i think ) :d, 
  thank you , 
  the superlux are still working !, 
  i also have the closed ones . 
  i will see what i can find , 
  i am surprised that i 'm getting understood to be honest !, 
  it 's comparable to those small built-in laptop mics i guess, 
  that does not even make sense, 
  fantasy borderlands !, 
  but `` blabla dont be a pussy , football is for real men if you dont like it play baseball ... '', 
  - fat guy on his couch , loving to see people 's lives ruined, 
  it 's not putting the contact out of the nfl , right ? 
  it 's just preventing mashed potato brains . 
  yeah , but most people would n't - it would not solve the problem , but reduce its impact . 
  be aware , do not adapt vocabulary - that could go quite wrong, 
  broooooforce !, 
  i am , in fact getting raped while submitting this comment . 
  but that 's how life is in germany - but you know that already , i guess ? 
  `` you had hitler , so we can get one too ! '', 
  yeah , i 'm not that sure if that 's what you should aim for, 
  does shit taste good if everybody eats it ? 
  all you need is a job offer basically, 
  edit : okay , a * good * job offer :d, 
  yes , you would have to get very lucky i assume . 
  but why should those want to leave after their `` victory '', 
  tell that to my 860 :(, 
  my father , who never played video games or anything just bought a big box of game cds ( no idea which one , it was just a vollection of games ) for me and asked me if i wanted to play on his office conputer . 
  first game i chose was motocross madness ( 2 ? ), 
  and that was enough for a year for me , until i discovered that other games could be fun too !, 
  well of course !, 
  google mal nach superlux reviews . 
  yes , handyvertipper , 
  even the same guy !, 
  i mean , why else would you name a team after the color of the hc 's head, 
  i 'm not sure if you 're just adding to the joke :(, 
  poor video, 
  the part of a train that has the engine in it !, 
  ( lokomotive ), 
  7910 - legends of grinrock sounded interesting to me , but i decided the other games were not worth it :d, 
  maybe you 're too smart, 
  we would if we could !, 
  yeah that game was win-win, 
  how bad were the 4xx ? 
  i still have an old 285 around , and i really noticed when i switched during january, 
  quickly , let 's all downvote that serious answer to an upvoted question !, 
  dyslexia or not , always let others re-read important stuff !, 
  also not k\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle ... 
  then fucking hire one or ask somebody who knows about it and pay him 50 dollars, 
  how do i change my flair to the cowboys ? 
  edit : where is my panthers flair lol, 
  imagine we still had norman ... all those flags !, 
  i think your pc is getting * bottlenecked * ... 
   they are n't cool, 
  that 's why i have mine, 
  a lot actually . 
  but your feet get sweaty too,

  has he more than one brain to get injured ? 
  okay seriously : do you then have multiple concussions ( is that possible ? ),

  you can flash another rom on it to make it able to be turned off . 
  no idea about the screens though, 
  panthers fan here , totally agree !, 
  you forgot that it 's an uneven year so the panthers will have a winning season !, 
  16:10 is 8:5 dude, 
  oh god i want those seats - they look so comfy !, 
  ... and you can play a whole level of super mario without screen pan !, 
  there was a giant door in portal 2 , shortly after you fell down - i loved the `` retro '' part !, 
  however , that giant door opened automatically and in an epic fashion - just to reveal a standard door . 
  i loved it .
