  how 's the blue metal one ? 
  i ordered my first spinner yesterday and thought that one would be decent to give it a try, 
  stealth spectre, 
  honestly , i want blacklights to return, 
  which makes me wonder why they do n't use their car as a bit of protection, 
  to be held closed in !, 
  last subs you posted in : overwatch and fifa . 
  so ... did you pay for these kids games ? 
  ceramic looks a bit like white plastic , if you 're looking for that, 
  i 'm up for fallout : new vegas , 
  thanks for the giveaway !, 
  the witcher 3 is missing in your list - so if you have not played it yet , goooo for it !, 
  your table is made for one of those big ass mats !, 
  uuuh , sweet !, 
  can we have a detail pic of that ? 
  2 weeks, 
  i ordered one for 10 bucks today via aliexpress , i will hit you up if they are any good !, 
  [ ... which is nothing like the fidget spinners you see today ] ( https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/445/804/fd249d8c794bd9552b9319d2597d9988_original.png?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;fit=fill&amp;bg=000000&amp;v=1493437790&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=aa259cd84a661e1f1bc5b6a0b4abe433 ), 
  also the patent ran out in 2005 . 
  the toy of the woman who claims to have invented it [ looks nothing like today 's fidget spinners ] ( https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/445/804/fd249d8c794bd9552b9319d2597d9988_original.png?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;fit=fill&amp;bg=000000&amp;v=1493437790&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=aa259cd84a661e1f1bc5b6a0b4abe433 ) and the patent lapsed in 2005 . 
  well , at least he can test-run it for me ... and maybe prices for gpus drop if vega ever gets released !, 
  edit : just looked at yours , very nice !, 
  love me some big brown wood !, 
  ... does it have a blower fan ? 
  i love metadrama, 
  very interested in trying your game out , when i have the time again, 
  i made a quick thing :, 
  oh damn :d another 1080p ? 
  what 's a reliable oc on a 7700k with a kraken x62 ? 
  a buddy of mine is getting that soon , and it would be a shame not to use that k. 
  sweet !, 
  i currently have one 1440p with a 1080p next to it ( which is way too much for my pc to handle , but just so nice to work with ) and would totally love 1-2 more screens :d, 
  i also love those dual-ultrawide setups which have them placed on top of each other , but i am not sure how well that would actually work for me , never tried it . 
  how do wallpapers even work with a setup like that ? 
  is it one big over all of them , or individual ones for each screen ? 
  ha , that seems just like ultramon , which i used while i still had windows 7 - i am now pretty happy though . 
  all i 'd still want is that if i maximize something on my 2nd screen , a strip on the left still remains what it was before ( like my steam friends list ) . 
  this is so frustrating , i tried tp get my so 's cat to spinning mine and all that dumbass did was trying to sniff it and hitting her nose ... twice . 
  alright , thanks !, 
  motherboard is an asus z270f if that helps . 
  grasshopper grasshopper !, 
  / r/nun, 
  maybe fixation while installing it , if you need your hands free you could just zip it to then add the bolts ? 
  i 'm in !, 
  ... and i still think `` stealth spectre '' would be a badass name for a future one :d, 
  i mean these are everywhere here , but sweing a store swlling only fidget spinners really surprised me . 
  i went in , and they had a lot of normal plastic ones for $ 5 , and some generic aluminium ones for $ 10 . 
  most expensive were some rainbow ones for $ 20 - some of which felt quite good actually !, 
  so it 's spinning pens all over again !, 
  - typed on a non-clicky keyboard, 
  i would love to enter , but live in germany - what if i paid for shipping if i won ? 
  also very interesting kickstarter !, 
  i just realised for how fucking long we have been in space . 
  and still , it is so fascinating, 
  hey , the bearings arrived today and i made a quick post , 
  unfortunately not , no, 
  the stainless steel bearings that came with my cheap spinners held up for around a minute , for comparison . 
  if put in my torqbar-clone , they spin for at least 2:30 minutes, 
  well , then you are paying to use the internet access you already paid for, 
  games are made for consoles and then get ported to pc , because it 's easier that way around . 
  that rewultd in waiting times , errors because of shitty porting and games bot being optimized for pc . 
  first time for me !, 
  our bus driver did the same with a fucking bus , and he definately was a giant dick lol, 
  i 'm gon na buy my buddy a cheap knife for cs go , he deserves it, 
  worldwide shipping 15 bucks - i guess that kinda ruins the fun for me :d, 
  wait , from the looks - should n't it be the other way round ? 
  thanks , time to dig through :d, 
  hm ... that makes sense . 
  at least more than a round earth, 
  this is a weird one, 
  gut , leon, 
  the ones carrying fruits on the left are peter pepper `` penis chilis '' , the tall ones which just started blooming are bhut jolokia . 
  the small ones on the right are ones i could not identify before planting , but they were around 5cm long , thin and pointy ( help would be appreciated ) . 
  check out c2dtog15 , it 's amazing for the screen and relatively unknown, 
  i would get it for a but cheaper through my father 's work , so i am considering one now that my laptop died . 
  it seems very usable to me , but i am really not sure which one would be best - the i5 8gb ram seems reasonable as prices skyrocket after that, 
  what are your main uses for it ? 
  great angle for a pic !, 
  damn , i love how that looks . 
  though , i could understand people laughing at that, 
  i would really love one of those gpus , as that is what keeps me bsck from utilising my 1440p screen and i really do n't have the cash to upgrade - especially as i would have to get a completely new rig . 
  with that gpu i might get another decent time out of my old box , and even incorporate it into a future upgrade . 
  thanks for the giveaway !, 
  okay then , i 've read quite a lot of stuff now , and i am ready to buy a printer - but which one ? 
  budget would be around 1000 $, 
  i want to print technical parts for university projects , stuff to fix broken things at home , fun figurines - an all rounder i guess . 
  print size should be at least 20 x 20 x 15 , preferrably 30 x 20 x 20 or bigger - but most important , i want a quality printer and quality prints . 
  i want it to be able to run 2 days without having to fear the house burning down ( though i think that should not be a problem in that price range ) . 
  here are the ones i consider :, 
  first off , the prusa i3 mk2s - it seems to be everybody 's love child here and is a classic - but will it live up to my quality demands ? 
  i know i have to wait for that one . 
  is it better to get the kit ?
