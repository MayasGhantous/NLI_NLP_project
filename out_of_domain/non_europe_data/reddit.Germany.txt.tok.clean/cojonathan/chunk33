  however all outputs but one seem inverted . 
  the code for all leds is simply turn high / low when a certain voltage is measured - how can this happen ? 
  i use the : thinking : emoji-thing a lot , so i made it a macro on my logitech keyboard - which since 2-3 days sometimes crashes the game for me and my mate , sometimes only one of us two , but nobody else ever . 
  hi guys , i just realized that you can get nfl 08 to be actually enjoyable on pc with mods ( which i completely did not think of - what a fool i am ! ) . 
  in the states , it is $ 10 on amazon - however , this is restricted to buyers with a us credit card and adress . 
  the only games available in germany are at least 50 $ for a physical copy . 
  does anybody have an idea on how to get around this buying region lock ? 
  i do not have friends in the states that could simply buy it for me . 
  are there other places where i can get a key for the game ? 
  thanks in advance for any help !, 
  and while op is at it he also rants about rule 4, 
  hi guys , i 've been reading a lot here in the past few days , and realized that many people have way more clue than i have . 
  so here is my system :, 
  ** ram ** : 8gb kingston ddr3-2000 ( holy crap , i payed 270 $ back then ), 
  ** cpu ** : i7-960 ( 4 * 2.8 ghz , which seems a bit low - but it seems to be capable of overclocking itself if stressed ), 
  ** gpu ** : zotac gtx 760 4gb ( how would that compare to newer generations of gpus ? 
  i 've upgraded from a gtx285 2gb which was mainly a heater and did not last long ), 
  ** psu ** : chieftec cft-600-14cs ( 600w seems enough ? ), 
  ** case ** : antec three-hundred ( yeah , that 's a case ), 
  ** storage ** : 2tb seagate barracuda ( i 've heard that it 's a miracle it is still working :d ) and a samsung 128gb ssd, 
  what are your thoughts ? 
  anything i should upgrade ? 
  or will i have to build a new station soon ? 
  i think my cpu-socket makes upgrading not that easy , is this correct ? 
  can/should i overclock anything ? 
  my buddy recently dropped his defective umi zero at my place for me to have a look into - it wo n't charge or connect to the pc ( it keeps getting recognized and then turns off again ) . 
  my guess is the usb connector of the phone is defective - or could it be anything else ? 
  also , where can i buy the part i need ? 
  can i repair that by myself ? 
  i once did the same thing on a galaxy s2 and had no trouble with it . 
  hi guys , i would like to get some lean-back rpgs to calm down before going to bed - i would take anything from old to new , preferrably cheap !, 
  do you guys have any favourites or suggestions ? 
  hi guys , i am a bit depressed reading about insane specs of new processors here without having the cash to upgrade , and while my one high-end system is now lower average i consider tweaking the last bits to make it a bit less shitty . 
  so the question is : is it worth overclocking my 860 ? 
  how far can i go with the stock fan ( not much at all , i know ) and what 's a cheap fan that would give me a worthy increase ? 
  also good tutorials would be appreciated , the ones i find are too in-depth for me as i do n't wamt to squeeze out the last possible mhz but just have a noticeable upgrade . 
  help would be , once more , much appreciated !, 
  i just did my first overclock ever , and made my i7 860 go from 2.8 ghz to 3.8 - because i got a scythe kotetsu from ebay for 20 $ . 
  i even set my ram speed higher ( from 1330mhz to 1900mhz ) - i did not even know that was possible !, 
  i 'm just posting this because it makes me happy that my cpu will now last 1-2 years longer , and all that for just 20 bucks !, 
  i 'm having an interview on tuesday and stazed my english skills as business fluent , so i expect to get tested . 
  please just write down whatever comes to your mind , it would help me a lot !, 
  i planted 15 ghost pepper seeds , all of which are now growing and are ready to get their own pots . 
  but what will i do with the resulting fruits ? 
  i guess i would like to make powder / flakes and sauce . 
  can you just air-dry them ? 
  how can i make sauce that 's insanely hot but without garlic ? 
  hi , i am playing with the thought of upgrading my gpu ( currently gtx760 4gb ) to a 1060 6 gb oc to finally make use of my 1440p screen . 
  my rig consists of an i7 860@3780mhz ( though i think about clocking it even higher as i am below 70 \u00b0 c under stress ) and 8gb of ram , and a 600w psu . 
  would my rig bottleneck such a gpu ? 
  or should i even consider getting a 1070 ? 
  hi , i just found some 12v led strips in the color of my pc so i thought i should hook them up . 
  question is : i have a spare 4-pin atx cable lying around in my pc , can i use just that ? 
  i guess that should be no problem right ? 
  i was only wondering , because every guide i 've read so far was suggesting using a molex-pin , of which i do n't have one lying around like that . 
  it is basically the same chip , but with 8 cores instead of 6 if i am not mistaken - however it costs quite a bit more ( about 520 $ vs 280 $ in germany ) . 
  is the big price jump worth the extra 2 cores ? 
  e : money . 
  i meant money . 
  i talked to a buddy of mine yesterday about thinking of getting a proper rig later this year , and that i was window-shopping until then . 
  he then told me he wanted to upgrade right now so i told him to send me his parts list and he could look at mine so we could compare . 
  he now ordered my dream rig and i even told him i would help him put it together - torturing myself . 
  on a side note , what would you change ? 
  it is meant to be for gaming/simulations/cad / 40 tabs in opera at 1440p 60fps . 
  i know the gpu is a bit overkill , but that makes it future proof - or does a 1070/1080 and getting an upgrade sooner make more sense ?

  i recently commented that i ordered some r188s from china , and immediately some people pm 'd me as they wanted to get to know how these were once they arrived , so i guessed i would just post it for all to see . 
  so [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xuz1mjb.jpg ) are the ones i tested , one being a full ceramic and one a hybrid bearing , tested with my cheapo spinner weighing about 18g without bearing and button . 
  the bearings can be bought on aliexpress :, 
  [ full ceramic for about $ 10 ] ( https://aliexpress.com/item/1pc-practical-r188-full-ceramic-bearing-1-4-x-1-2-x-3-16-zirconia-oxide/32804898377.html ), 
  [ hybrid bearing for around $ 5 ] ( https://aliexpress.com/item/high-quality-r188-r188zz-closed-silent-ceramic-ball-bearing-6-35-12-7-4-763mm-for/32805154813.html ), 
  i cleaned both before testing using alcohol , and then placed them on the table and spun as hard as i could . 
  results : both got my spinner to spin around 2 minutes - which is quite decent for that low weight and build quality of my spinner , i guess . 
  the full ceramic one was a bit louder , though , and cost twice as much for the same spin time . 
  both felt very smooth , without wobbling or scratching . 
  so i guess if you want to make a bit more out of a cheap spinner - go get that hybrid one !, 
  they took pictures of my group and me , but i have no idea where to look for us !, 
  hello ,, 
  living in germany we recently switched from dsl 16k to vdsl 100k . 
  testing in speedtests my dl is 114k and upload speed is 48k , ping is 9ms - so i assume it must be an error on my side . 
  i am connected through a router which i use as wi-fi-switch , connected to the main router - both fritz.boxes - i assume it has to do with those , but where to start ? 
  thanks in advance for your help and sorry if i missed anything out . 
  as the title says , my games started running in slow motion suddenly , which results in massive stuttering online . 
  now that i write this post i feel like even typing is laggy - is this my cpu / mobo dying or anything else ? 
  my pc is quite old and runs an i7 860 @ 3.8 with 8 gb of ram , and a gtx 760 4gb . 
  all on a gigabyte ga-p55-ud3 .
