  as late as 7,000 years ago , it was possible to walk from present day britain to present day france as the area where the english channel and north sea are now was then land . 
  similarly , it was possible to walk to denmark from sweden and to ireland from britain . 
  are there any accounts passed down generation to generation , even myths , about how and when ireland and britain became islands , separated from continental europe , or how danes and swedes became separated by water ?

  i work in retail . 
  i honestly love my job and love being able to help customers find what they 're looking for . 
  we are trained to greet all of our visitors , engage with them in conversation , discover exactly what they want , and let them leave with the products they want and a positive shopping experience . 
  when a customer comes in and does not speak english , they will not understand my greeting , they ca n't tell me what they 're looking for , i ca n't answer any of their questions , and they will leave unsatisfied . 
  about a month ago , i spot a couple looking at pressure washers . 
  i say hello and the young lady points at our honda model and shouts `` you give me this ! '', 
  i tell her we have it stock and let her know it 's a great model , but first offer her some accessories . 
  i show her the different soaps we have , which are made specifically for concrete , wood , or vehicles . 
  she says `` no soap . 
  i use to water grass . '', 
  i tell her pressure washers are n't used for watering grass and they would damage her lawn under the intense speed of the water . 
  i show her the sprinklers we have in the next aisle . 
  she throws a fit , saying she does n't want a sprinkler , but a pressure washer . 
  i repeatedly warn her that this probably is n't the product she 's looking for . 
  she buys it anyway despite my hesitation . 
  she returned it within a week , saying it was destroying her yard . 
  about a week ago , a family came in ; an elderly woman with ( i assume ) her daughter and granddaughter . 
  she says `` where lawnmower ? '', 
  so i walk her over to our lawnmowers and she says `` need button . '', 
  i show her our two electric models which have button start as well as a gas mower that has an electric button start . 
  i tell her the rest are gas only and are pull start . 
  she points to each one ( about 12 ) asking `` button ? 
  button ? '', 
  each time she asks the question , i tell her only the three i showed her have button start . 
  after ten minutes of impasses , we get a long line at the register and i have to help out the cashiers . 
  when i get back , the lady is standing in front of a gas mower saying `` you give me . '', 
  i warn her that this one does not have a button start and she will need to pull it to start . 
  she says `` i no pull . 
  bad shoulder . '', 
  so i show her the three models again which have button start and she says `` no no no , this one ! '', 
  pointing at the gas mower with a pull start . 
  i reluctantly go ahead with the sale . 
  she returns it the next day because it did not have a button start . 
  we offer credit cards at our store . 
  when someone signs up , they get $ 25 immediately . 
  so if you 're making a purchase under $ 25 and sign up for a card , that purchase is free . 
  a man comes in to buy a single part for his mower ( either an air filter or spark plug , i ca n't recall ) . 
  i let him know that if he signs up for a card , he can get this item for free . 
  he says `` yes . 
  you give me free . 
  okay . '', 
  i hand him the form , asking him to sign and date . 
  he refuses to fill out the form , but demands the item for free . 
  another associate hears his shouting and comes over . 
  she explains to him exactly what i 've been saying . 
  he leaves frustrated that he had to pay $ 7.99 or whatever the cost was . 
  we have a diverse staff at my store . 
  we have associates who speak spanish , french , vietnamese , arabic , serbian , russian , and other languages . 
  we do everything we can do be as welcoming of all people , regardless of their background , as we can . 
  but if a customer comes in speaking a language no staff members understand , it is nearly impossible to help them . 
  i feel pleased when a customer walks out the store , having had a great experience in our store , happy about the purchases they 've made . 
  i really feel bad when we get returns or when customers become angry because we did n't get someone exactly what they were looking for . 
  i used to have a landlady who only spoke chinese . 
  she would always bring her daughter-in-law or neighbor with her when she ran errands and she had the neighbor over to explain the rent contract with me . 
  it is always appreciated when a foreign customer brings a friend or relative in to act as a translator . 
  if we ca n't communicate , i will still do everything to serve you as a customer , but it may be difficult for both of us , and you many find your shopping experience less than decent . 
  but i place that responsibility on the customer , not the employee . 
  i should n't be expected to become fluent in 50 languages to help every customer that comes in . 
  but they should be expected to at least be conversant in english when they move to the united states ; especially if they own a home and are looking for lawn and garden equipment .

  i randomly had this thought , so i decided to google it and did n't get an answer . 
  i 'm thinking the most likely scenario would be a hit man getting hired to kill another hit man . 
  or maybe an accomplice killing an accomplice . 
  more far fetched could be a killer who lurks in a seedy area at night attacking another killer lurking in that same area . 
  if anybody has an answer , i 'm morbidly fascinated to hear the story . 
  here 's the link to the thread :, 
  a criminal expert on the podcast accused noted that there was a spike in active serial killers in the late 1970s . 
  the top commenter mentioned that this phenomenon lasted until the late 1980s . 
  the criminal expert suggested that these serial killers were the sons of wwii veterans who suffered from trauma and ptsd . 
  these fathers would have been distant , emotionally unpredictable , and prone to random violent outbursts . 
  this hypothesis states that this kind of father figure would create the home environment that could produce a serial killer . 
  my personal opinion was shared by another commenter who saw the post before i did . 
  the mid to late 20th century saw the rise of the interstate highway system and car culture , which gave killers the ability to travel from city to city , county to county , state to state with ease , speed , and anonymity . 
  however , it was also a time before mass dna databases , traffic cameras at most major intersections , and cell phones ( to both call 911 or catch a suspect on camera ) . 
  murderers had the means to commit crimes across great distances while law enforcement lacked the means to connect the dots . 
  so what do you think ? 
  does the ` children of wwii veterans ' theory hold up ? 
  how about the ` interstate highways without cameras ' theory ? 
  maybe a little of both ? 
  i 'm from seattle and i 'm moving to leipzig on the 16th . 
  my saxonian boyfriend and i will be celebrating our two year anniversary on the 25th and we 've already found an apartment in leipzig . 
  he has a job in chemnitz and will be working there until he can find a job closer to home . 
  i graduated unviersity in december and have worked as a sales associate in a department store the past 10 months . 
  i understand there are several different visas available for americans looking to work or live in germany . 
  the most likely one for me to choose would require me to apply for a work visa during my first 7 days in germany and allow me 90 days to find a job . 
  i have a bachelor 's degree in political science with a minor in german .
