  the article below mentions he is a regular at the bar where the interview took place . 
  [ i 'm absolutely not fat-shaming here ! ], 
  another prominent white nationalist is bill white , best known for defending the columbine shooters in 1999 and unveiling a swastika banner at a speech given by george w. bush in 2007 . 
  he was arrested for the second offense . 
  i mean no disrespect to people with bill white 's body type , but he is visibly overweight . 
  a photo of him doing a hitler salute shows some stomach fat rolling over his belt . 
  bayzle morgan , another neo-nazi , who was convicted in 2016 of murdering a 75-year-old las vegas woman , has the same body type as bill white and is covered in face and neck tattoos . 
  he has also been an abuser of various drugs , both illegal and prescription . 
  i will never understand anti-semitism , homophobia , holocaust denial , holocaust support , or many other disgusting things neo-nazis believe in . 
  what i would like to try to understand is how they adhere to an ideology that promoted the beauty of the ( white ) human body , physical fitness , health consciousness , and a revival of classical arts , while themselves being physically unfit , unhealthy , tattooed , and creating anti-melodic music . 
  are n't their actions and appearance defying the ideology they have ruined their lives defending ? 
  would n't it make more sense for neo-nazis to be drug , alcohol , and tattoo-free , compose classical music , and be in peak physical condition ? 
  alan turing is credited as the father of the modern computer . 
  his work was recognized and funded by the british government who saw the potential for his work to outwit the axis of evil . 
  if world war ii had n't begun , would turing 's work have received as much attention and funding ? 
  could someone else have developed similar equipment along a similar timeline ? 
  tim berners-lee is considered the inventor of the world wide web . 
  his work was influenced by cern , a nuclear research center in switzerland . 
  without world war ii , would there have been a rush to develop nuclear power ? 
  if not , cern might not have been created . 
  without cern , could tim berners-lee or someone else have had the capacity to invent the internet in the 1990s ? 
  without world war ii serving as a catalyst for turing 's work and nuclear energy development , could the internet not have developed until decades after it did in otl ? 
  sometime between 1994 and 2000 , i watched a movie ( or possibly a tv show or even a commercial ) on nickelodeon or disney or another children 's channel that had a green humanoid monster that walked on two feet and had pointy ears and sharp teeth . 
  i used to have trouble sleeping because of it . 
  i still vividly remember a scene where it was walking in someone 's yard and turned directly toward the camera and flashed its teeth . 
  i 've tried searching through episode descriptions of are you afraid of the dark ? , buffy the vampire slayer , the x-files , and similar shows that were popular during those years , but have n't had any luck . 
  i 'd love to re-watch this presumably low-budget , cheesy show and laugh at how it gave me nightmares . 
  i believe that slavery is one of the worst , inhumane practices one human can impose on another human . 
  i 'm glad memorials to slave owners and defenders of slavery are being removed throughout the southern states . 
  however , not only european-americans owned slaves . 
  chief seattle of the duwamish nation , emperor montezuma of the aztecs , and chief joseph vann of the cherokee nation practiced slavery . 
  there are two statues of chief seattle in the city of seattle , a statue of montezuma at san diego state university , and vann 's home now operates as a museum in rural georgia . 
  if america wants to completely condemn the practice of slavery , it should not only remove memorials to white slave owners , but also memorials to non-white slave owners .

  if you 've been on any right-wing conspiracy thread or the_donald or listened to your drunk conservative uncle rant , you 've heard about seth rich . 
  i 'm personally tired of all the fake news and partisan nonsense . 
  `` hillary killed seth rich '' has become the new `` bush did 9/11 . '', 
  i 've enjoyed this subreddit for the past three years or so because you 've all done an excellent job of sticking to the facts and finding the most rational and plausible series of events in mysterious cases . 
  people are quick to downvote any unverified claims and wacky theories like `` maura murray walked to canada '' or `` elisa lam was being chased by ghosts . '', 
  i 've posted before about a series of fires at orthodox churches in new york and australia , about the death of a woman from my area , and about the disappearance of a young boy in colorado . 
  each time , the thread was productive , polite , and focused on finding the truth . 
  that 's why i want to bring this case to this sub . 
  i 'm looking for a non-partisan , fact-based assessment of what might have happened to this young man . 
  here we go . 
  seth rich was born in omaha , nebraska in 1989 . 
  passionate about his faith and his country , seth started actively volunteering for the jewish community and democratic candidates at a young age . 
  in college , he interned for nebraska senator bill nelson as a jewish outreach coordinator . 
  in 2011 , he graduated from creighton university in omaha and then moved to washington d.c. to work as a pollster . 
  since 2014 , he had worked for the democratic national committee , where his primary responsibilities were analyzing voter data and helping voters find their proper polling place . 
  around 1:30 a.m. on the morning of sunday , 10 july 2016 , seth left lou 's city bar , less then 2 miles ( 3 km ) from his home . 
  it can be assumed he planned to walk home . 
  seth was shot twice in the back one block from his home between 4:00 and 4:20 a.m. seth lived in a neighborhood that had a somewhat high crime rate , so shootings and robberies were not uncommon here . 
  dc police and the rich family , however , do not believe any items were taken from him . 
  police were immediately on the scene to take the still conscious and breathing seth to the hospital , where he died later that day . 
  the death of the young , energetic 27 year old shocked his colleagues in the democratic party . 
  dnc chair debbie wasserman-schultz and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton both issued statements praising his hard work and expressing their sadness in the days after his violent death . 
  police say they have surveillance footage of two people approaching seth at the time he was shot , but this video has not been released to the public . 
  so why was seth rich killed ? 
  the most plausible theory is that he was the victim of an attempted robbery . 
  he had bruises on his hands , knees , and face , suggesting he fought back against one or more attackers . 
  a fight may have escalated to him being shot and the two attackers fled without taking anything . 
  in august of 2016 , wikileaks founder julian assange was asked about his sources in an interview with a dutch journalist and said : `` whistle-blowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks ... there 's a 27-year-old who works for the d.n.c. , who was shot in the back , murdered ... '' he is clearly saying seth rich gave wikileaks information . 
  but can assange be trusted ? 
  growing impatient to find the suspects , the rich family hired jack burkman as a private investigator . 
  in february 2017 , burkman told the press that he believed the russian government killed seth . 
  the rich family quickly fired burkman and dismissed this claim . 
  after being fired , burkman claimed rich was killed by a serial killer . 
  i ca n't find any comments from the rich family on this claim . 
  the family then turned to rod wheeler . 
  ( a quick flashback . ), 
  from january through may of 2016 , 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments were either leaked from within the dnc or hacked from outside the dnc . 
  these documents were published on wikileaks on 22 july 2016 . 
  among the most significant revelations were that the dnc was actively trying to sabotage bernie sanders ' primary campaign , that the party was rewarding wealthy donors with meet and greets with president obama , and that the dnc was demanding what topics were and were n't covered on msnbc . 
  in the aftermath of the leak/hack , dnc chair debbie wasserman-schultz and communications director luis miranda resigned their positions . 
  in december 2016 , the cia reported that they concluded the dnc was hacked by the russian government . 
  in may of 2017 , rod wheeler told the press that he believed seth rich was the person who leaked the thousands of documents to wikileaks , furthering julian assange 's allegation . 
  once again , the rich family distanced themselves from a private investigator they hired . 
  the dc police , the mayor of washington d.c. , and the fbi all dismissed wheeler 's and assange 's allegations . 
  however , former speaker of the house newt gingrich continued to promote these claims on cable news . 
  in july of 2017 , roger stone , a long-time friend and advisor to president trump tweeted that seth rich was the victim of a political assassination because he was the source of the dnc leaks . 
  although the family does not believe this and dc police have reasserted there is no evidence for this , the tweet re-energized conspiracy theorists . 
  to date , president trump has not commented on his advisor 's tweet . 
  so , the possible theories :, 
  seth rich was killed in an attempted robbery . 
  he was targeted for walking alone in the middle of the night in a rough neighborhood . 
  his being employed by the dnc was irrelevant to his death . 
  also , he was not the dnc leaker . 
  seth rich was killed in an attempted robbery . 
  he was targeted for walking alone in the middle of the night in a rough neighborhood . 
  his being employed by the dnc was irrelevant to his death . 
  however , he was the dnc leaker . 
  seth rich was killed by the dnc because he was the leaker and the dnc wanted to silence him . 
  seth rich was killed by the russian government .
