the fps is in fact a cause for this . 
  if you have low fps or your game is stuttering a little bit , you will be slower . 
  the game tries to smooth your movement and only allows actual movement - if you for instance run and have a 2 sec freeze , you wo n't keep running like in other games , but you will be at the exact same point , where the freeze began . 
  you can do this in the options or simply try out hud_scale `` x '', 
  if you use hud_scale `` 0.5 '' your interface will be scaled down by 50 % . 
  if the game is released in 5 days , i think formatting the gui and hud files will be possible . 
  maybe it is now , too , but i have n't seen a single custom gui yet . 
  with stock he meant weapon damage , because elemental guns still deal weapon damage and bonus elemental damage . 
  i did n't see that , because i opened the tab and responded quite some time later without refreshing , but thank you for the sarcastic idiotic response . 
  no , because i knew zer0 ca n't do that ingame , 
  who let the dogs out ? 
  people like you , pressuring him everyday , are the reason why he has n't spoken so much lately . 
  just chill and be patient , its holidays , let him relax . 
  he already gave a statement , in which he indirectly delays the game for an ** unknkown ** amount of time to create a better game . 
  [ for reference ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/157qzu/dayz_hive_is_down_i_need_your_help/c7k1irg ), 
  it must take a german again for people to realize that racism is wrong, 
  it 's not just something cosmetic or `` for the lulz '' . 
  in the right hands , taunt is a good psychological weapon , since your enemy sees , that he is taunted and in most cases this means , that the taunter will kill him easily now .

  control userpasswords2 is the exact same thing as netplwiz , but thanks for your efforts !, 
  i also can hand out two extra keys . 
  tried to get some for 2 weeks , but none came until today . 
  interested in buying a knife-wrench ? 
  it was changed in the end of open beta or somewhat afterwards , but it still happened a long , long , looong time ago, 
  there was a mod for this , but then it was implented . 
  i still have a channeling bar without a mod , so i 'm wondering why you dont have it . 
  are you on legacy hon or cis/garena/huehuehuehon ? 
  i guess the custom tiles, 
  thank you for this post . 
  i 'm playing pokemmo since i discovered your post 8 hours ago !, 
  soon as in soon \u2122 or more like soontour ? 
  and teleport using swords !, 
  irfanview is a very good option for image viewing . 
  its also free !, 
  mad cuz bad !, 
  both have their ups and downs , but lumen is no possible choice , because she was driven by revenge . 
  hannah understands him and feels him , but she is a killer , which ca n't be trusted . 
  debra is best for dexter - `` incest '' power !, 
  yeah , but he ca n't trust a killer , who poisons his targets . 
  this was also stated in the show . 
  what the actual fuck is steamrolling ? 
  for the non-germans : tail in german means `` schwanz '' , which can be interpreted as penis, 
  its dexter 's point-of-view . 
  are n't you watching the show ? 
  but one , who he can trust completly !, 
  poor boss probably got a huge dump on his head . 
  do you do this often ? 
  you might have a serious case of snortality . 
  i know that , because i trained a snorlax . 
  playing bubbles with stormspirit is so ridiculously op - you just ca n't die . 
  its nearly impossible to die except you have bad reactions or get nuked instantly . 
  i shed a manly tear for you ^ ^ , because ^ ^ you ^ ^ are ^ ^ not ^ ^ ghetto, 
  balls or gtfo - that would be great pickup line , dont you think ? 
  you picked up the shit she send you and shoved it in her face . 
  brilliant respond !, 
  poor guy , trying his best with an overly honest move, 
  you should only answer those , where you feel comfortable . 
  if a guy wants to know more , give him signs , that you are willing to tell him more . 
  no need to spoil all the private things to strangers , unless you are interested in them . 
  i prefer girls , where you can discover the secrets in a good talk , makes the girl more mysterious in the beginning . 
  i 'd still hit ler !, 
  try harder !, 
  no , i believe he meant simultaneous !, 
  so its easy for men . 
  i do n't think a woman can force a boner on a dead man . 
  not sure what 's worse : hating bacon or tongue-kissing your dog, 
  do n't use the bathroom mirror . 
  do n't make a duckface . 
  do n't take off your shirt . 
  do pick a setting , which kinda shows your interests . 
  you like going out for walks ? 
  take a picture in nature , maybe a park or forest . 
  make sure you are smiling . 
  i often use a b/w setting , so maybe edit your picture a bit for stylistic reasons . 
  do n't edit parts of your body , ergo no photoshopping away your beauty marks or such things . 
  hope this helps you !, 
  you are right !, 
  bacon helps you to wash your mouth from dog saliva !, 
  i 'm messaging with him , he 's a really nice person . 
  give this guy some upvotes , he deserves them , 
  this may help even more : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7buu_ujzvju, 
  sure , but it 's on every link now , even on non-spoilerish content . 
  harry is not the reason dexter kills . 
  harry is just the one causing dexter to kill certain persons with a specific codex . 
  [ s01 spoilers ] !!!, 
  in the first episodes you see , that harry found buried ( ? ), 
  animals and confronts dexter with that , who then admits his killings and said , that he did n't say anything to not disappoint them . 
  i still think she 's hot , though, 
  some proof : https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20978539/nsfw.jpg, 
  using opera + res, 
  yeah , that changes all into spoilers , but i could swear that not every thread was marked like this yesterday . 
  but i 'm not sure anymore : s, 
  no fucks were given that time, 
  well , that clears things up !, 
  / thread, 
  op , please deliver us some pictures . 
  thanks !, 
  you delivered !,
