  [ are you fucking sorry ? 
  you wo n't be going to hell because of being a rude ass douche . 
  i , however , will because of eating out your dead great-grandma 's huge ass while forcing your mother to suck off her own father .

  no - he spelled it the right way , 
  i do n't want to go on a feel trip today :(, 
  i can only imagine him putting on [ this face ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2ybxihi.jpg ) for atleast a month . 
  would make sense . 
  no player ever scored more than one hundred goals in a season . 
  if you take into consideration , that the game 's database can consist of over a hundred thousand players , those bytes add up quite a lot and reduce the save size . 
  / r/montageparodies, 
  funny , how the big 3 mobas all have this problem . 
  heroes of newerth , for instance , has practically close to 0 input lag . 
  out of all mobas i played , hon feels the best . 
  sadly the company behind it ca n't compete with the likes of valve , blizzard and riot . 
  i 'm sorry , but that does not make any sense . 
  since every player is affected by input lag , no one has more or less time to react . 
  it just delays every action . 
  the intention to slow the game for better viewer experience is also lost on me . 
  how does a viewer profit from inputs being delayed ? 
  [ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qypu-pcihg ) here a video that shows the difference between input lag in hon and dota2 .

  that looks like paint .

  dear bayern fans , i wanted to tell you this first . 
  i 'm playing here at fcb for 12 years now and i want to tell you : i renewed my contract for 5 more years for you . 
  long live bayern !, 
  let 's go guys , come on !, 
  you should get the firetv and install xbmc on it . 
  chromecast is n't bad either , but depends heavily on your pc/phone/tablet whereas the other devices you mentioned are working without other devices . 
  you should head over to / r/xbmc . 
  it 's a great solution for your needs and you should also checkout / r/xbmchub if you ca n't afford cable or premium channels . 
  i used to play on 1600 and ~ 4-6 without m_rawinput and 11/11 on windows . 
  it 's because i only use my hand and wrist to navigate . 
  my wrist is on the edge of my table and i only move my wrist to actually move my mouse . 
  edit : and i 'm not shaky or anything . 
  you would n't know that i 'm using such a high sensitivity when spectating me unless i sneeze or get scared . 
  or / r/murica, 
  such ruse, 
  not at all !, 
  my country was liberated in 1939-1945 , 
  germany, 
  no , you are n't . 
  france was indeed liberated in that time period . 
  he was injured for 9 days the whole season . 
  in 12/13 , where we won the treble , he tore a muscle in april and missed the rest of the season . 
  in 51 matches he had 4 goals and 9 assists . 
  counting only the bundesliga , he indeed had only 2 goals and 4 assists in 29 matches . 
  but he was playing a very good season . 
  the stats are `` lying '' . 
  he initiated many bayern attacks and had superb pass accuracy . 
  he is a pass machine with a great shot , but lacks in pace and defensive skills . 
  this . 
  do n't use your ssd for any media files . 
  an ssd 's performance do not improve any media playback . 
  use your ssd for programs and games . 
  false translation . 
  i 'm certain , that he [ g\u00f6tze ] knows , what is expected from him - and he will perform [ well ] . 
  he will reassure everyone , that we trusted the right person . 
  [ could n't translate this sentence word-by-word - same meaning though ! ], 
  he will be a big player at bayern , a very big player !, 
  so rummenigge did n't directly say that g\u00f6tze has to step up , but it goes in the same direction . 
  i did n't like the aggressive wording from goal.com there . 
  select your country on the right hand side and scroll down to your price range . 
  maybe add a few bucks to afford an ssd . 
  but please answer me why you did not just google this question ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it took me less time to search for a solution than it took you to create this thread .
