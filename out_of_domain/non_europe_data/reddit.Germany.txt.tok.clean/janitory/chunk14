  what a legend !, 
  not racist , just blind . 
  anyone with a good german stream ? 
  sky go is currently not working for me . 
  not safe for legs ? 
  the father is saying `` oh god '' because getting free ice cream was his childhood dream . 
  i like your name :(, 
  holo launcher hd, 
  if our boateng what ? 
  there was a clicking sound coming from the factory and franky 's ear heard/sensed it . 
  huh , feels like i already read something very similar somewhere today . 
   fuck you . 
  robben is the biggets diving piece of shit out of all of the barca and bayern players . 
  you ca n't poke at barca players for diving when robben does it twice as often . 
  i liked your team but you specifically , fuck you , your team is losing , bitch . 
  pointing to something else does not make the previous matter vanish . 
  i did n't take part in that discussion . 
  i know robben had his dives here and there , but most of his `` dives '' nowadays are embellishments . 
  when there is foul-worthy contact , you should n't be mad about the fouled player emphasizing the contact . 
  but ofcourse robben also dived , like prefaced . 
  i had the feeling that his mask really influenced his game . 
  he was very good today , but i watched him play so many times now and i can just sense , that he currently ca n't fully play his game . 
  furthering your point - if that is a straight red to him , what would be a flying dropkick to the oppenent 's face ? 
  maybe even instant execution ? 
  good catch , 
  lvg actually promoted him to the first team at bayern and can be quoted : `` m\u00fcller spielt immer ! '', 
  ( m\u00fcller will always play ), 
  this rule only applies if no signs are placed stating otherwise .

  germany here ( again ) . 
  it 's not a specific isp issue . 
  i 've read countless posts wondering why gfycat is so slow for a couple of weeks or even months now . 
  the optimum isp situation seems to be unrelated . 
  many europeans have problems , regardless of their isp . 
  if you need any information , i 'll gladly help , because i miss gfycat so much . 
  it 's the bmr you are refering to . 
  the tdee of a 6 ' 0 180lbs man in his twenties is ~ 2250 kcal/day sedentary . 
  his bmr is ~ 1800 kcal/day . 
  thank you for responding !, 
  every single gfycat ( except very small ones [ ~ 0.8 mb or less ] ) we try to load will be fine for the first 1-3 seconds and then start lagging . 
  it seems that a big chunk of data gets sent at the beginning and after that there is very little throughput . 
  http://gfycat.com/identicalcautiousgibbon for example plays fine until the first shots , then starts buffering like hell . 
  the whole clip took nearly a minute to finish loading , but after that plays fine again . 
  on desktop ( any browser ) and mobile ( chrome on oneplus one ) . 
  exactly the same behaviour . 
  plays fine until the satyr 's bolt hits tidehunter . 
  then it starts being choppy - 1 ingame second is 3-4 real seconds in the first playthrough, 
  yes , the loading circle is equivalent to the time bar at the bottom of the player . 
  tried using hola vpn ( usa ) - no change . 
  west germany , bordering netherlands and belgium .

  spdy = off, 
  thank you !, 
  it 's fixed since today !, 
  mind sharing the cause ? 
  thanks , ~ ~ obama ~ ~ klinsmann, 
  that 's very odd . 
  it literally did n't work for months and suddenly works flawlessly again . 
  tested it on multiple different networks and devices now , loads fine again !, 
  do n't want to be pedantic here , but that 's not correct . 
  * matchday 21 - both tied at # 1, 
  * matchday 22 - robben taking the lead, 
  * matchday 24 - meier taking the lead, 
  * matchday 26 - robben injury, 
  robben shot 17 goals in 21 matches played . 
  meier shot 19 goals in 26 matches . 
  robben also was on fire before he got injured . 
  it was very plausible that he would be topscorer , but there is no use to argue about if 's and when 's in football . 
  plot armor . 
  if you try to say it as a word , it kinda sounds like `` allahu akhbar '' - atleast with a german tongue . 
  snipars is kill, 
  nice me me, 
  i firstly encountered this in a cave in velen with a certain witch . 
  surprised me quite a bit . 
  to further your point , we do n't even know yet what happens with the dothrakis she meets while shitting non-stop . 
  yeah , but he thinks they might skip the dothraki stuff entirely . 
  dude , seriously stop it . 
  either you are the worst troll ever or you should mind your own fucking business . 
  who are you to think you know better about another person 's personal decisions than himself ? 
  troll or not , i 'm sorry that you are this way , truly sorry . 
  i hope you 'll realize that eventually . 
  a sorceresse 's beauty is n't an illusion . 
  they did reform their bodies to be beautiful . 
  i 'm interested , although imo the price is a bit high . 
  the fx-8350 costs 170 $ ( # 120 ) and is occasionaly on sale for ~ 145 $ ( ~ # 105 ) . 
  the mobo costs around 110 $ ( # 80 ) now , because it is quite old . 
  used to be around 20 $ cheaper for a very long time . 
  both prices are for completely new products .
