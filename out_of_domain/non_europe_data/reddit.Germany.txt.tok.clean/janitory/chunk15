  i took the prices from http://geizhals.de/msi-990fxa-gd65-7640-030r-a636413.html and http://geizhals.de/amd-fx-8350-fd8350frhkbox-a852989.html . 
  if you have n't found a seller yet and are willing to sell this for 150 $ shipped , shoot me a message . 
  i 'm living in germany . 
  thanks to the eu , it would be just shipping , no customs or vat . 
  160 $ and we have a deal . 
  more i really ca n't bear this coming month , sorry !, 
  no , to see dem gainz you have to chunk down 1.5 kg/lb protein down your throat everyday . 
  trust me , i 'm a nutritionist . 
  very understandable . 
  pm me if you change your mind . 
  ask the man himself , syrio forell . 
  o d a, 
  sure , go ahead !, 
   time is running up, 
  maybe that will come back and bite you in the ass now :p, 
  they somehow weasel themselves through and manage to stay up although the club was terribly mismanaged the last few years . 
  i 'm happy they were not relegated . 
  i like the clock !, 
  do n't worry , there is still rasenballsport leipzig , 
  i bought my sapphire 6870 for 30 $ , but you can easily get 50 $ for it . 
  the 965 is around 60-70 $ .

  indeed , but you ca n't stop the circle jerk . 
  for the night is hype and full of spoilers, 
  / r/soccer : totally reasonable suggestion -  getting downvoted . 
  no shit , look at the timestamps . 
  it was at -2 when i posted my comment . 
  duisburg is considered professional , you dummy !, 
   bayern 's lack of depth in the midfield, 
  huh ? 
  is schweinsteiger , thiago , alonso , martinez , kirchhoff , rode and lahm not enough for you ? 
  in my opinion it was good to sell him . 
  we had a buyback option afaik , but our midfield is so loaded , that he would maybe be competing for a backup spot even with 2-3 of the above mentioned guys being injured . 
  i 'm pretty sure we would 've held onto him , but he wanted to play . 
  there was no way to keep him sitting on the bench for 2-3 years . 
  even so , i think for the next 2-4 years we are in a good position with our defensive mid - i even forgot to mention alaba and gaudino !, 
  i 'm more worried about our wings . 
  only our left side has younger players ( bernat , alaba and kurt ) . 
  edit : jeez , also peh !, 
  to avoid confusion : only the fish is called pl\u00f6tze , the bug is called kakerlake . 
  gear 3rd ^ gear 4th = gear 81st, 
  the unit for tormund 's member is a constant equaling infinity . 
  he has a point . 
  before the euro crashed , the prices were unfair even with taxation . 
  just the typical foreign market cash grab . 
  gog does that . 
  `` if you end up paying more for a game than its standard us dollar price , we 'll refund you the difference out of our own pocket . '', 
  an american bashing foreign culture . 
  jesus , that 's hilarious and sad . 
  either you are a bad troll or i want to try what you were smoking . 
  looking at my last few comments :, 
  okay , so german football or football in general is american culture , got it . 
  one piece is also not japanese or anything , but truly murican . 
  german comedians , cabaret artists and musicians - hell , any artist , is an american in disguise . 
  the witcher story is totally not polish , also the embodiment of usa 's own traditional culture . 
  watching american tv shows makes all consumed cultural assets transform into american culture , i understand that now . 
  how could i not see that !, 
  for real though . 
  you bash foreign culture which formed your own culture . 
  just fyi , your roots are mostly european if you are caucasian . 
  and i never said that i do n't like what america has to offer culture wise , but you write so many delusional things making your comments hilarious . 
  the irony is killing me . 
  you should do the math before writing something like that . 
  when we bought martinez 1 $ was roughly worth $ 1.25 . 
  germany 's inflation rate in 2012 was 2 % , both following years even less . 
  calculate it yourself and you 'll see that this is n't a different story . 
  by listening to others and not doing your own research it 's easy to forget what is indeed true and what is n't . 
  i feared something like this would happen , when i read a couple of weeks ago that he still has problems with his ankle . 
  i really hope that he can overcome his injury . 
  actually , the source is still the sport1 message . 
  kicker refers to that in their own article . 
  indeed . 
  that 's the one . 
  yep , you 're right , they seem to have the same source though . 
  do n't jinx it , please !,

  personally i do n't know , but you could just ask them . 
  if you do n't want to reveal who 's asking , mail them anonymously . 
  getting an answer to such a specific question here in this small sub is pretty hard . 
  i googled this a couple of days ago and found a solution for it . 
  it 's literally the first link when you google for `` kodi mouse wheel volume '' . 
  enabler !, 
  hope this gets sorted out for you !, 
  good luck !,
