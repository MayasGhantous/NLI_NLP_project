  `` more or less , '' brienne answered . 
  septon meribald disagreed . 
  `` more less than more . 
  there are many sorts of outlaws , just as there are many sorts of birds . 
  a sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings , but they are not the same . 
  the singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord , but most outlaws are more like this ravening hound than they are the lightning lord . 
  they are evil men , driven by greed , soured by malice , despising the gods and caring only for themselves . 
  broken men are more deserving of our pity , though they may be just as dangerous . 
  almost all are common-born , simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war . 
  poorly shod and poorly clad , they march away beneath his banners , ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe , or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide . 
  brothers march with brothers , sons with fathers , friends with friends . 
  they 've heard the songs and stories , so they go off with eager hearts , dreaming of the wonders they will see , of the wealth and glory they will win . 
  war seems a fine adventure , the greatest most of them will ever know . 
  `` then they get a taste of battle . 
  `` for some , that one taste is enough to break them . 
  others go on for years , until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in , but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first . 
  brothers watch their brothers die , fathers lose their sons , friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they 've been gutted by an axe . 
  `` they see the lord who led them there cut down , and some other lord shouts that they are his now . 
  they take a wound , and when that 's still half-healed they take another . 
  there is never enough to eat , their shoes fall to pieces from the marching , their clothes are torn and rotting , and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water . 
  `` if they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm , they need to take them from a corpse , and before long they are stealing from the living too , from the smallfolk whose lands they 're fighting in , men very like the men they used to be . 
  they slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens , and from there it 's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too . 
  and one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone , that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize . 
  they do n't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they 're fighting for does not know their names , yet here he comes , shouting for them to form up , to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes , to stand their ground . 
  and the knights come down on them , faceless men clad all in steel , and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world ... 
  `` and the man breaks . 
  `` he turns and runs , or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain , or steals away in the black of night , and he finds someplace to hide . 
  all thought of home is gone by then , and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day , or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours . 
  the broken man lives from day to day , from meal to meal , more beast than man . 
  lady brienne is not wrong . 
  in times like these , the traveler must beware of broken men , and fear them ... but he should pity them as well . '', 
  when meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band . 
  brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows , and farther off the faint cry of a loon . 
  she could hear dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey , tongue lolling from his mouth . 
  the quiet stretched and stretched , until finally she said , `` how old were you when they marched you off to war ? '', 
  `` why , no older than your boy , '' meribald replied . 
  `` too young for such , in truth , but my brothers were all going , and i would not be left behind . 
  willam said i could be his squire , though will was no knight , only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he 'd stolen from the inn . 
  he died upon the stepstones , and never struck a blow . 
  it was fever did for him , and for my brother robin . 
  owen died from a mace that split his head apart , and his friend jon pox was hanged for rape . '', 
  `` the war of the ninepenny kings ? '' asked hyle hunt . 
  `` so they called it , though i never saw a king , nor earned a penny . 
  it was a war , though . 
  that it was . '', 
  i think you have mistaken right for left . 
  i do n't like his opinion on many subjects either . 
  but it 's one thing do disagree and having different opinions and a completly other thing to publicly call him out or even shame him . 
  i see his name mentioned more and more in a negative context . 
  it should n't be that way . 
  he played mainly at the left side before going to real , where cristiano was playing on the left side . 
  even at united he played half of his games centrally and on the left side . 
  he 's also left footed , that 's why he often does his rabona crosses , when he is on the right side .

  the [ / r/soccer post match thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3ea7ye/post_match_thread_panama_vs_mexico/ ) gives an interesting insight at what happened this match . 
  any decisions i refer to are linked in that post . 
  edit : added footage and clarified some sentences . 
  basically panama was about to win 1-0 and advance to the finals of the gold cup 2015 . 
  one of the first very odd and game-changing decisions [ is this red card against ] ( http://streamable.com/1g5d ) panama 's tejada . 
  [ a very questionable decision ] ( http://streamable.com/dpo4 ) in the last minutes of the game by the referee resulted in the match going into extra time due to the awarded penalty kick making it 1-1 . 
  [ another penalty kick for mexico ] ( http://streamable.com/7ibh ) was given in that extra time , making it 1-2 and ultimately mexico advanced . 
  even some mexico players were shocked and could n't really celebrate the win . 
  [ here ] ( http://streamable.com/sa64 ) you can see how panama 's players reacted right after the final whistle . 
  not linked above and somewhat relevant is [ the penalty decision ] ( http://streamable.com/5906 ) in the semi final match a couple of days ago - also pro mexico and also in the last possible moment right before the penalty shoot-out . 
  i tried to be as objective as possible . 
  my opinion on that matter is illustrated very well [ in this picture ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rfjb4sd.jpg ) . 
  it just reeks of match fixing and corruption . 
  fifa and concacaf are casting a cloud over soccer and as a huge soccer fan myself it angers me to watch this shit show happen . 
  penalty as in [ penalty kick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penalty_kick ) . 
  i edited my first comment and added all the replays , if you want to look at them . 
  the red card is very harsh . 
  that 's a yellow offense . 
  sadly i do n't have a replay of vela 's yellow card , he elbowed a panama player a couple of minutes before the red card incident . 
  the ref was very inconsistent and i really do n't know what to think about that cup anymore . 
  look at the space they created . 
  after the pass sequence , robben and schweini not only changed positions , but robben now has no opponent right beside him , whereas in the beginning the defending player tried to interfere with the play . 
  this allowed him to act more freely and deliberate instead of rushed and forced . 
  and they also gained time in which their teammates can change positions , free themselves from the opponent and/or make clever runs . 
  it 's like humans never walked the earth for thousands of years without shoes . 
  c o s t a, 
  they did n't even have the courage to own up to it and apologize . 
  and iran is evil ... yeah , sure !, 
  a country which has n't invaded another country unprovoked for centuries is so evil , that without a nuclear agreement the us would have to go to war with them .
