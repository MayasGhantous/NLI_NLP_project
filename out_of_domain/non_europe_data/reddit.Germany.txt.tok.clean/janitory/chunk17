  could scare away potential buyers who do n't realize that you are a mod . 
  just use a dark skin if white bothers you that much, 
  huh , that 's odd . 
  normally it should affect the whole display . 
  it certainly does with my setup ( kodi 15 on ouya [ cm11 ] ) . 
  get kodi ( formerly xbmc ) and configure [ free iptv ] ( http://tvip.ga/index.php ) . 
  it 's still rtl , but atleast in hd and watchable from your pc/android device/whatever you run kodi with . 
  i think i saw / u/rileyyyy mention in the ger-pol match thread that she is a girl aswell . 
  not that it really matters though , being a fcb fan is all that matters !,

  even if he acts like a big douche , / u/eaglezzz has a point . 
  he had the idea of a thread like this and you used his idea only a week after and acting like you came up with it . 
  i could care less about who 's idea was it first and what not , however you could 've atleast be open about where you got the idea from . 
  could be that you did n't think of eaglezzz 's post anymore and that you really came up with it yourself - would n't be the first time for a thread like this . 
  all in all , it 's a waste of time to argue about this . 
  * g\u00f3tz\u00ea, 
  what 's up with the eu servers ? 
  dude , use spoiler tags . 
  anime-only watchers do n't know that yet !, 
  no problem at all !, 
  everyone makes little mistakes , 
  sorry , it 's actually ruhmdeuter, 
  i saw that 10 minutes ago on sky . 
  i really want to know what the fuck happened there for the police to act like that . 
  i really hope we demolish them today . 
  i 'm curious how uefa will react and i really want to know why the situation escalated like that . 
   maybe bayern fans are the disgrace ? 
  do you know the full story ? 
  i highly doubt it . 
  tell me , what could those unarmed ultras have done for it to be okay to be beaten bloody ?!, 
  not surprising to read this from one of the most annoying bayern haters of / r/soccer . 
  so it 's okay for bystanders to be beaten because of some idiots there ? 
  i also do n't commend jumping to conclusions , but if someone beside you acts aggressively , it 's okay to beat you aswell , even though you held your arms up in surrender ? 
  i would n't want to punish the club for that . 
  that 's why i 'm curious how uefa will react in this case . 
  do you really think that everyone being beaten there was guilty of something ? 
  i might be guessing around , but atleast i 'm realistic and not exaggerating . 
  thank you based / r/lecutinsideman, 
  * cut * * cut *, 
  further down this comment thread i said that your club itself is n't responsible for the polices ' actions . 
  however , since it 's the greek police , i sure as hell want the greek team to loose heavily . 
  this is now his name . 
  our gimmick trio :, 
  kaiser franck , coman the bavarian and [ badman 's robben ] ( http://www.tz.de/bilder/2015/04/28/4954545/860137050-bayern-borussia-dortmund-choreographie-18003wwrfref.jpg ) . 
  i 'm in love with the coco, 
  s p a c e, 
  i 'm excited about this game , because we might see javi getting some minutes . 
  furthermore , if we win here , we might climb up to the 1st spot . 
  would be great , because i can finally shut up my bvb friends , 
  i would n't be so dumb and not wait until sunday . 
  maybe i 'll even do nothing until matchday 8 after we played both wolfsburg and dortmund . 
  but our time will come !, 
  some parts are way cheaper in the us than over here in europe . 
  they also sometimes have good sales , bundles and mail-in-rebates , which drives the price even further down . 
  also taxes , import fees and most importantly the weak euro alll have something to do with our prices being quite high in comparison . 
  nah , that 's a job for [ loddar ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p6kkd9fvji4/vcp9fulbnvi/aaaaaaaaan8/nmnjwvufdzc/s1600/lothar_matthaeus.jpg ) , 
  no , but i can sell you a rope . 
  jokes aside , very sad to hear that . 
  i really hope that you guys do n't crash now . 
  mostly pundit work at sky germany . 
  and yeah , effe 's wife was cheating on him . 
  strunz cheated on his own wife , who in return got together with effenberg iirc . 
  fc hollywood in action . 
  hey !, 
  easy there . 
  i take that as an insult !, 
  i 'm out of the loop there . 
  can you explain ? 
  may i drive your vulva ? 
  me not sorry, 
  ftfy,

  damn , i have n't seen your comics in a while !, 
  loved the old cs comics !, 
  this is n't about rivalry though . 
  just all derbies that were once in the bundesliga ( only 1 . 
  liga ) . 
  glad that you appreciate my small banter , 
  hm , this is a though one for me to decide . 
  i like to see them suffer , but it would be so great to have two additional goal festivals a season . 
  you are right , thanks !, 
  i did n't know that - added that info above . 
  open a new tab before you close the last one .
