  afaik there is no other workaround . 
  also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thef2iv4x4s, 
  his stuff is mostly german . 
  more than four, 
  bellamy , senor pink , pica , gladius , trebol , diamante , dofla,

  i predicted to my friends that whoever wins this game , will win it with a margin . 
  it would n't be a close call . 
  i would n't have guessed 5:1 , though . 
  more like 3:0 . 
  luffy should be, 
  is water drier than sand ? 
  is the moon bigger than the sun ? 
  is 1859 +1 better than bayern ? 
  can i also get 13 trillion a-levels at the age of 2 months if i believe in myself ? 
  the streaming service is called `` rtl now '' . 
  `` nau '' is what an idiot ( or non-english speaker ) would understand when hearing `` now '' . 
  they also got the rtlnau.de domain so that idiots can reach their streaming service anyway . 
  we scored 30 goals combined in the 6 previous meetings . 
  averaging that , we might see 5 goals again today . 
  me not thanks, 
  your haters need to chill with some more dank then, 
  that 's insulting towards retards . 
  your wish has been granted . 
  a failed celebration from two years ago in the bayern - braunschweig game, 
  i actually thought this post was on / r/soccercirclejerk . 
  it was only a little wound . 
  played the match and missed not a single session because of it . 
  it just looked hilarious and hurt a bit , i guess . 
  but when it happened i feared the worst . 
  fuck , i did that several times . 
  but not on first dates . 
  i was kinda proud , too . 
  though it did n't seem to be a turn off for them . 
  [ another goodie is this video \\ ( german \\ ) , a clip of a recent news segment .

  why do you all interpret his gesture as him acting innocent ?!, 
  he immediately throws his arms in the air with the palms facing the sky - an apologizing gesture . 
  the only thing he tries to do is avoid afterwards is the red card . 
  who would n't ? 
  he did n't mean to injure hahn . 
  yes , it was reckless and yes it was well deserved , but hating on him , for not wanting to be sent off , is ridiculous . 
  look when he changes his gesture . 
  as soon as the ref goes for the back pocket , you can see a change in his gesture . 
  we do n't know what he really meant , but jumping to conclusions and raising pitchforks is just wrong . 
  he 's just a kid and the media backlash is just crazy . 
  we all know that he did a horrible mistake and that he is truly sorry , so why beat on him even further . 
  injuries like this one happen so often , but i rarely see a reaction like this kid gets . 
  where do i misrepresent facts ? 
  and why do you think your interpretation is a fact ? 
  we both have different opinions about his reaction , but please do n't twist my words . 
  exactly , initially there was enough contact to go down , but he did n't . 
  as soon as he realized , he dove . 
  what a bummer . 
  edit : the angles on this gif do n't show the contact well enough . 
  if you had seen it live and the live replay ( sky germany ) , you would n't be questioning the initial contact being enough to go down . 
  he pressed down on his arm/shoulder with enough force , where it could 've been a penalty . 
  nevertheless , he did go on and just fell down after that - there 's no apology for that . 
  by the way , funny how i 'm being downvoted with exactly the same opinion on this situation as op bruvar . 
  must be the flair . 
  are you crazy ? 
  ca n't you read ? 
  i stated multiple times that he dove . 
  he could 've embellished contact , but he did n't - instead he fuckin took off like a plane . 
  where do i defend his diving ? 
  there was , else he would not have decided to jump off 2 seconds after it . 
  like the poster above said : it would have been enough for a soft call , if he fell by hasebe 's actions , but he regained balance and then tried to get a foul . 
  i , personally , would n't have given a foul there , though . 
  is n't it obvious ? 
  dogs lick , rabbits nibble . 
  maybe that alaba looks more like a monkey than himself ? 
  i do n't know though . 
  that 's even worse than having to listen to reif or rethy . 
  my condolences . 
  she could n't grab more without getting hurt - she has to spawn new limbs to grab them , which will get damaged anyways . 
  also , the anime gave you a wrong sense of time . 
  the fight was drawn out in comparison to the manga . 
   why the arbitrary point of 1992, 
  because the pl started that year ... 
   how relevant is what happened in 1992 to 2015 ? 
  football often has very dominant teams in various time periods . 
  just looking at the current standings does n't tell the whole story . 
  shhhh , that was in the past !, 
  it does n't matter , because just looking at a short time-frame in recent history is enough to judge the entire league . 
  no , it does not . 
  east and west germany have 43 winners together . 
  germany without the east part has 29 different winners . 
  12 different winners since the foundation of the bundesliga , founded in 1963 . 
  next time look up your facts before using them in an argument . 
  maybe bierhoff or koch . 
  i 'm rooting for loddar though . 
  roland ... \u00e4hhh [ rainer koch ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainer_koch_\\ ( sportfunktion\u00e4r \\ ) ), 
  yeah , sure . 
  whatever . 
  there is no point arguing with someone , who does n't know their facts and makes up silly excuses when faced with true stats . 
  [ here , count it yourself , if you want to ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_german_football_champions#total_german_football_championships_won ), 
  jfc , how can you be that dense . 
  then capitalize the letters to create a bigger word . 
  i have nothing to say, 
  while i agree with your view on this vfb fan , you should n't project his attitude on all vfb fans .
