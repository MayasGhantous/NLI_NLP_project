  no matter where you look , there will always be some idiots . 
  i 'm curious . 
  taking checkmatearsonists 's incorrect comment about some of our laws aside , do you think that those laws are weird ? 
  i , as a german , take them as granted and would really get some foreign view on them . 
  see , this is why i said that your comment is incorrect . 
  for example : you are comparing the hitlergru\u00df to just raising your right arm . 
  are you german ? 
  because i do n't think you know what you are talking about regarding censorship [ edit ] in germany . 
  where do you think many germans are pro censorship with the exception for nazi symbolism ? 
  not only are they an obvious response , but they were installed by the allies after the war ended . 
  those laws are seldom enforced though unless they are ( publicly ) displayed in a manner that sympathizes with national socialism . 
  i can understand your viewpoint though . 
  objectively talking , they should n't be outlawed . 
  but personally , i do n't need to see them get changed . 
  they are hardly relevant today and only get brought up by some online guys with an agenda against germany . 
  i 've never come across someone in germany , who talked about those laws in such a routine . 
  not even the very right-wing guys i know seem to care . 
  * sub-only chat, 
  it is indeed . 
  i do n't think that guy knows what he is talking about . 
  at least he shared his invite . 
  liga , etc ) ? 
  it 's from a flashback conversation with rayleigh during the dofla-luffy fight . 
  in it luffy tells rayleigh that his kong gun was n't enough for this one animal he fought . 
  yeah , but thiago was n't fouled . 
  alaba might just have been in pain from the foul . 
  use the northwind bomb . 
  if you invest some points into bomb count and fragments , your bombs will be insane . 
  northwind freezes all the shit , so you only have to deal with a single enemy at a time . 
  please do n't use quotation marks if you do n't quote the person directly . 
  this is so clickbaity . 
  robben did not say that they are n't friends - that was purely the editor .
