  he 's also forgetting that it was 0:0 for 77 minutes until messi bailed them out with his magic . 
  without alaba , robben , ribery , badstuber and an unfit martinez , it took a superb performance of messi to turn it into a win . 
  that says everything imo . 
  make it two ( ribery + m\u00fcller ) , 
   calciopoli plus four scudetti in a row makes for a horrible cocktail, 
  i know what it means , but it sounds like you are talking about food . 
  `` waiter ? 
  i 'd like a calciopoli and four scudetti on top . '', 
  `` a cocktail aswell , please . '', 
  it will be different from university to university . 
  i 'm on a elite university , where we are n't allowed to ask any question after beginning the exam . 
  we have 5-15 minutes in the beginning to read the exam and ask questions about the tasks , but that 's it . 
  after the initial comprehension-only related question phase , we are allowed to start writing .

  i 'm feeling dumb now .

  its the literal translation of the combined words . 
  and liga is league . 
  g\u00f6tze for pogba ? 
  sure , deal !, 
  i thought i was in / r/bundesliga and the atrocity is the double berlin in `` hertha bsc berlin '' . 
  different qualities , but badstuber is preferred to play as a cb . 
  martinez however can play cb well enough and also change his position to defensive midfield , where he is a boss , if tactical changes are needed .

  it was that and giving kimmich advice to improve because pep really believes in him . 
  pep hugged him very dearly after that . 
  sadly it leaves out the hug at the end . 
   ** / r/soccer and ** media : pep yells at kimmich after ** great ** perfomance, 
  ftfy, 
  quite disappointing to read this about pep from a barcelona fan . 
  he said in an interview after that `` gro\u00dfes kompliment f\u00fcr joshua . 
  ich liebe diesen jungen '' , which translates into : great compliment to joshua . 
  i love this kid '' . 
  and stating that he 'd like to take kimmich with him and also complimenting michael reschke , our technical director , for the kimmich transfer . 
  pep was very energetic , yeah . 
  and he was lecturing kimmich , sure . 
  but he is doing that , because he believes kimmich can make it big-time and because kimmich is immensly open for critic to improve his game .

  ricken !, 
  ricken . 
  shhh . 
  why focus on the facts and circumstances , when we could just patronize europe ? 
  come on . 
  you know this is n't true . 
  all these generalized statements here are disheartening to read . 
  some people here write shit , yeah . 
  but projecting it to all fans is just wrong . 
  also a very good shot which wiedwald barely saved . 
  oh my god , what a game !!!, 
  thank you , [ coman the bavarian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cqwczbd.jpg ), 
  holy shit , i was shitting bricks . 
  i 'm actually very decent with photo-editing myself , but i had 1 min time and thought it 'd be funnier this way :p, 
  to expand on this :, 
  on german pay-tv channel sky the scene of pep 's pep talk was shown and the moderator asked beckenbauer to guess what our coach might had to say . 
  beckenbauer answered this question with a joke - something along the lines of : when you do n't win this , then i 'll castrate you !, 
  in an after-match interview , m\u00fcller was then asked to comment on this joke of beckenbauer and went even further with the joke . 
  this thread title is clickbait and the article leaves out the context . 
  i hate sports `` journalism '' . 
  if you have a skygo account , here is the m\u00fcller part with introduction :, 
  what ? 
  i 'm well below 40k hp and challenging mode is a breeze . 
  it depends more on your positioning and tactics , less on your stats . 
  since you do n't believe me : [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ndvif ), 
  my gear is not that good , but i still have no problems with challenge mode . 
  power plant for instance is still tricky , but doable nonetheless . 
  yeah , shotguns oneshot me close quartered , but they are very exposed when rushing , which makes them easy to kill beforehand . 
  sadly , i do n't have friends on level 30 yet to premade with . 
  i 'm pugging all the time . 
  i do n't die very often - and even when i die , i have my support station up to revive me . 
  eben . 
  hannes is king, 
  k-l-u-k !, 
  k-l-u-k !, 
  they do add up , because germany did n't only take in syrian people . 
  do n't you want to just win ? 
  who cares for mankind and the greater good , when you can win ?!, 
  yeah . 
  it means that theres much suffering in the world , which we all should do something against , so that there is no reason to flee the homeland . 
  but we westeners caused many of it through exploitation , colonialism , wars - all to have prosperity or gain even more wealth . 
  if you are ill and go to a doctor , you do n't want to just rid yourself from the symptoms , do you ? 
  they 'll keep coming back unless you cure the illness itself . 
  5 years ago , no one would 've thought that they will end up like this . 
  exactly . 
  so many posts here on this sub which blindly follow some stupid headlines and articles . 
  [ here is the press conference , ] ( http://tv.dfb.de/video/pressekonferenz-zum-laenderspiel-deutschland-england/13701/ ) stop getting fooled by bad journalism . 
  first one was a joke from beckenbauer though , which the interviewer wanted m\u00fcller to expand on . 
  and this time he said it innocently - realizing what he said right after . 
  the g\u00f6tze hate is very strong ( im ruhrpott ) , he would never get accepted again by all fans . 
  two good friends of mine are bvb supporters . 
  both liked him and kinda want him back , but do n't think a return is a possibility , because of the fans .
