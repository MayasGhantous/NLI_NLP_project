  guys , come on . 
  the gomez decision is not the first ever wrong call , stop the salt and enjoy the game . 
  a couple of days ago he said he might return around mid-april during a tv visit . 
  he was asked if he might be an option for the return leg against benfica , his answer was roughly along the lines of : that 's a tight time frame . 
  i do n't want to promise anything , i 'll concentrate on my recovery and listen to what my body says . 
  i think he 'll play his first minutes vs schalke - so right after the second leg against benfica . 
   unsuccessful 3rd world teams, 
  unsuccessful ? 
  sure , in the past years . 
  3rd world ? 
  so ignorant to use words you do n't know the meaning of . 
  turkey is a nato nation since the first enlargement in 1952 . 
  they were a first world country even before germany became on . 
  g\u00f6tze better than messi confirmed, 
  he made it to an apple !, 
  praise the apples, 
  i share the same destiny as rizzles_7 . 
  i was forcefully removed from spreading the holy seeds of our apples . 
  but the growth will go on . 
  i was forcefully removed . 
  i 'm on my way back .

  tumorllc and apples will forever live in harmony, 
  do not forget / r/joinapple and / r/tumorllc, 
  / r/joinapple, 
  they lost a lot of points due to referee mistakes though !,

  even if it were 0.8 to 1 , it would 've been 60 less , not just 40 . 
  [ `` here 's jon-ny '' ] ( http://finalbossblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jack-nicholson-the-shining-heres-johnny1.jpg ), 
  our bench :, 
  i guess we will end up with something like this :, 
  as we have seen in the past , the line-up will be very fluid anyways . 
  the whole center part from centerbacks to our 8s/10s will switch . 
  sometimes martinez will be more offensive and the likes of kimmich or vidal might drop back , etc. 
  i do n't know about that . 
  martinez played very often on the center back position during his time at bilbao . 
  those guys saying he is a dm only and only pep threw him into a cb spot and so on , certainly do n't know anything about his time in la liga . 
   - finally , fujitora has to capture law and luffy in order to set foot in a naval base ever again , which he was hoping for . 
  do we already know which part fuji was hoping for ? 
  capturing law & luffy or not setting foot in any naval base for some time ? 
  i 'm a manga reader , but i do n't remember - the translations were ambiguous . 
  i know what he will do - but i was n't sure what he meant exactly with that sentence . 
  / u/gerrettheferrett pretty much explained the translation and why it could be confusing when you only see the literal meaning . 
  the quality is decent for a stream , but it has some lags . 
  and please do n't call it hd - that 's no where near hd resolution . 
  if you upscale 360p to 720p , it does n't become hd . 
  [ khan so jealous at that body ] ( http://media.newindianexpress.com/untitled-2.jpg/2014/01/01/article1976782.ece/alternates/w620/untitled-2.jpg ), 
  pretty good deal from barcelona . 
  even with a pay-out delay , reducing the actual worth of the contract ( inflation + interest gained ) , since it 's quite unlikely that he got so many boni activated at the end of the 5 years . 
  i wish they 'd do that in aachen . 
  our tsv has a bigger stadium than wolfsburg and we currently are a mid-table 4th league team . 
  what happened here is so crazy and tragic . 
  a decade ago bremen and aachen were playing the dfb-pokal final . 
  now , we ca n't even get back into 3 . 
  liga . 
  thanks , the german stream is nice , very good audio quality !, 
  sorry , but this is / r/worldnews . 
  you have to stick with the anti-muslim-narrative . 
  and please do n't post facts unless you want to see stormfront propaganda with cherry-picked and falsely interpreted statistics . 
  who should we trust more - some fucking tabloid rag or our club 's media director and our club 's official announcements ? 
  either way , what i 'm reading in this thread and in this sub in general about some of our players and staff is embarrassing . 
  i 'd be glad to help out with the player ratings , if there still is need . 
  i 'm decent with photoshop and creating rendered images aswell as setting up a voting page . 
  for a moderation position , however , i think i 'm not suited for , since not many people around here know me and a moderator should be atleast somewhat popular imo . 
  please be aware that it 's not my title - it 's taken from the article . 
  ancelotti is n't actually saying that we closed the gap due to our performances , but because of barca dropping form . 
  what 's interesting to me is that he believed barca was a sure pick for the title . 
  i might be looking through rose-colored glasses , however i do n't think it 's that clear . 
  bayern is on the same level as barca when in-form . 
  their offensive power is not really rivaled , but luckily offence is n't everything . 
  do n't forget us germans . 
  * football is a simple game . 
  twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end , the germans always win . 
  yes , we 'll see some alaba & ribery wing-action today !, 
  alaba martinez kimmich lahm, 
  if you want to see some warm-up and the game in hd ( german ) , watch the following link with vlc :, 
  the warm-up and impressional footage is currently on while the tv station shows their usual program . 
  `` real '' coverage with commentary starts at 20:20 i believe . 
  if you want to see some warm-up and the game in hd ( german ) , watch the following link with vlc :, 
  the warm-up and impressional footage is currently watchable while the tv station signal shows their usual program . 
  `` real '' coverage with commentary starts at 20:20 i believe . 
  exactly !, 
  i would 've loved for them to advance . 
  not because i like dortmund to win , but i like german teams to win . 
  the bayern hate in germany is ridiculous . 
  i 've got so many friends , who dislike bayern despite not even watching football . 
  just because so many hate us and they jump the bandwagon . 
  i 've even got a bochum friend , who hates us for reasons that are beyond logical . 
  the dumb statement that we are breaking the league by buying players from our competition and the whole g\u00f6tze situation . 
  also hating on lahm for quitting the national team after winning the wc , because `` he abandons us for the em '' . 
  soooo ridiculous . 
  but what we all should keep in mind is that the football fan culture is primitive , not logical . 
  i thought the whole world will turn muslim and speak arabic if we continue like we do !!!!!!!, 
  if he goes the route of coman , he 'll end up with us - which makes your pun even more fitting : the german word for icon literally is ikone .
