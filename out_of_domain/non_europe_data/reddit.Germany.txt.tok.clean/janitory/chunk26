  ... neymar neither, 
  when it comes to theon one has to ask `` what is left ? '', 
  instead of `` what was he stripped of ? 
  bild stating that he is indeed training already !, 
  i 'm so happy right now , 
  the beast has returned !, 
  [ the beast is back , bros ] ( http://49.media.tumblr.com/9bcd466bff716ad80708ea2383c576da/tumblr_n64gkadvbm1shuwvvo2_400.gif ), 
  he had multiple injuries , had problematic matches due to lacking rhythm , had to deal with shitty press and rumours . 
  very understandable statement after all the shit that has happened to him . 
  hopefully he does n't leave us , because when fit he is one of the best defenders and i rate him very highly . 
  heracles ` nnnnn !, 
  can you link me the cover story part or tell me which chapter it was ? 
  i missed that . 
  oh my god , i saw the beetle but did n't realize who was flying on it . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  also constant transfer rumours that we want to get rid of him . 
  jerome wo n't retire for a long time , he 's only 27 . 
  it 's very early to think about getting a future boateng replacement now . 
  5 years from now many things will be very different . 
   that 's shameful from ~ ~ bayern ~ ~ ** vidal ** . 
  ftfy, 
  what a ridiculous statement . 
  holding responsibility for a shameful act of an individual , where our own players ( like m\u00fcller just now in an interview ) distance themselves from ? 
  be reasonable . 
  it was a disgraceful act to flop like that after dodging , but it was disgraceful of vidal and not of bayern ... 
  a ) i agree , but i do n't think that bayern endorse this behaviour . 
  b ) that 's true . 
  bremen played decent , but was n't comparable to other oponents we faced already . 
  something was n't right today . 
  c ) yep , i can see that :p, 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  always appreciate the look of salty 1859 +1 .

  es ist grade mal april ... 
  messi for coman , ronaldo for costa, 
  * let the downvote begin, 
  yeah , because bayern is literally the bild posting up rumors to weaken dortmund . 
  it 's not like there are any journalists speculating , squeezing anything out of interviews , stringing together facts & reasons , stalking the individuals and looking up any information to link players to any future move . 
  no no no !, 
  it 's all a secret conspiracy of bayern !, 
  hmm ... 
  animiert in videoform : https://youtu.be/xnirynmpvdq?t=56s, 
  i 'm a fcb supporter lurking here ,, 
  thank you and many of you here , that you are reasonable in this situation . 
  thanks for realizing that it 's mats who makes the decision to leave and not bayern poaching your players to weaken you , if it were to happen . 
  more reschke than sammer, 
  aswell as robben and ribery ... 
  he was good once upon a time , i 'm glad he 's finally going to retire at the end of this season . 
   traditionell, 
  ( last edited 3 hours ago ), 
  he sure as shit has ambitions . 
  when dortmund and bayern would underperform like their `` top '' teams do , our league would be even more interesting . 
  look at how close buli teams are . 
  nothing besides top 2 will and hannover 's relegation will be decided until the last match day . 
  with 1 year left , 30m is a huge sum . 
  remember kroos ? 
  i 'd value him higher - not because of his performances , but because of his worth - and we got less for him from real madrid . 
  these guys paid 100m for ronaldo , 100m for bale and 75m for james and only 25m for kroos . 
  yeah , well ... you know . 
  that 's very untrue . 
  10 years ago dortmund was deep in debt , struggling to even survive . 
  their last top 3 position before 10/11 was 02/03 . 
  they re-emerged as a title challenger in 2010/2011 even winning the league . 
  this is his 7th semi final in a row . 
  he always reached the semis . 
  it 's certainly all down to the squads and not because he is a great manager and one of the best tacticans in football !, 
  they are all forgetting that the first leg was 0-0 until minute 78 and only messi bailed them out with 2 goals in quick succession which were ridicilously great . 
  the finisher was a last minute counter with neymar scoring . 
  all these people here seem to not have watched the game . 
  it could have been easily 0-0 if it were n't for messi . 
  that was n't pep 's fault in the slightest . 
  you ca n't fool the football gods with your false sayings . 
  just utter the words you truly believe , you heathen . 
  see the color difference in the middle ? 
  these are the pants of the person in front of zidan . 
  only zack would know that ... 
  i 'm onto you, 
  you ever heard of `` guilt '' ? 
  being the perpetrator of such an incident leaves deeper scars than any suitable punishment you 'd get by law , unless you are a sociopath , ofcourse . 
   guilt only works if the person is inclined to feel guilty , something which a disturbing amount of people lack . 
  every person is inclined to feel guilty when his actions or negligence caused another human being to die without them wanting it to happen - again : unles said perpetrator is a sociopath . 
   also , you can only guilt people after something bad happens . 
  it is n't going to stop it from happening in the first place . 
  people can fear guilt even before something bad happens . 
  and what do you want to do ? 
  punish people unfairly harder so that other people are scared ? 
  one 's punishment wo n't stop accidents from happening . 
  adam johnson, 
   stop this bullshit , most people here would give him rather to schalke than to you guys . 
  schalke are no title contenders , nobody here sees them as a threat . 
  what ? 
  no true/diehard bvb fan would want hummels to go to schalke instead of bayern . 
  only casual fans think so , because they are n't invested in the club and its ( fan ) culture . 
  nothing wrong with being a casual fan , but do n't project those opinions upon the whole fanbase . 
  e : https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/4gudan/hummels_is_allowed_to_leave_for_bayern_if_they/d2krouc, 
  nothing more to add , those comments do the rest for me . 
  and thanks for the downvotes - that 's easier than accepting the truth . 
  the timing is okay business-wise . 
  in the past bvb 's investors were annoyed that these transfer stories did n't reach them quick enough .
