  of course we wished he 'd be more efficient , however he was really good in the first season , the first half of the second season and the first half of the third season . 
  if he performs , he starts . 
  simple as that . 
  pep has no agenda against him - whoever thinks that is an idiot . 
  all his past performances get overshadowed by all this bullshit rumoring and interpretations . 
  we should only use it for the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of footballers though like,

  anyone watching the br broadcast ?

  he 'll make decent extra money off of those !, 
  danke david du worma !, 
  also the dfb pokalfinale on saturday - pep 's last game with bayern against bvb . 
  you shut your whore mouth . 
  seriously though , i neither hope nor think that ancelotti will suck in the league . 
  huh , that 's pretty wrong . 
  it was hamburg playing against bayern . 
  schalke were winning their game on their pitch while bayern conceded a late goal . 
  the late goal was announced at schalke and the fans stormed the pitch thinking bayern has lost making schalke the champions . 
  however , the hsv keeper at the hamburg - bayern game handled a backpass leading to a indirect free-kick . 
  hamburg stacked their wall into the goal and it was nearly impossible to score there . 
  anderson took the freekick and fired it straight into the goal - making bayern the champions . 
  the realization arrived a few minutes too late for schalke , but when it hit : oh my , their faces . 
  it was the first season i followed bayern . 
  thiago is nominated . 
  xabi has retired from the national team . 
  bernat was n't good enough . 
  martinez was and again is injured . 
  he does not deliver playing for peru . 
  one can argue whether it 's his fault for not scoring nearly as much as in his clubs or the rest of the peruvian team 's fault for not creating a lot of chances for him . 
  that 's why i prefaced both arguments with `` one can argue '' . 
  i 'm not the one able to argue this and there almost never is just one side to a story .

  ter stegen and leno have a little feud because both played in the same national youth teams and ts was always favoured . 
  there was also an incident where they had to share a room and started an argument because ts wanted to sleep but leno was talking on the phone . 
  recently leno said something along the lines of : why am i not starting for the u21 ? 
  i 'm starting for my club while ter stegen sits on the bench in barca .

  shhhh , better be quiet now or people might think that there is n't just only one club in germany with that practice !, 
  you basically traded castro with kampl though . 
  come on , man . 
  be objective . 
  maybe 's do n't matter . 
  you could argue in the same vein that you kept mainz from performing better , maybe resulting in also a better europe performance from mainz . 
  there really is no difference . 
  shhhh !, 
  dude , we do n't want to spread the hate . 
  centralize the hate to canalize the hate . 
   and if they were n't buying players from mainz , clubs from other leagues would . 
  mainz does n't have the resources to pay their salaries . 
  you could say the same for bayern and dortmund . 
  i think it 's hypocritical to defend the own club doing something while criticizing another club doing the exact same thing - even if there are different implications .

  but dortmund could n't match bayern 's salaries without compromising their wage structure . 
  now they can , and sure , they could match hummels salary . 
  but a transfer depends on more than 1 party . 
  hummels wants to go back to bayern , even if bvb matches the money . 
  other top clubs were interested in lewy and in hummels . 
  the g\u00f6tze signing is the only reason that people are again talking about this . 
  leverkusen : `` dis strange looking hoffenheim is extremly dangerous and could atak at any time , ve must deel vit it . '', 
   but if you look at the fact that he won the bundesliga three times in a row , ** won the german cup twice - hopefully ** - then it 's a good performance . 
  lewy sure is confident ,

  buddy , m\u00fcller is literally in the title :p, 
  if you had seen any footage before that you 'd know that lahm was arguing with pep to raise it and pep wanting lahm to raise it . 
  it 's always great to see people making opinions without context . 
  pep did n't want to , lahm convinced pep right before to lift the trophy . 
  also wow , how can you be so dense ? 
  did n't watch the games vs. barca , arsenal , roma , man city , atletico , juventus , dortmund etc , i guess . 
  had the same problem playing anub . 
  multiple games , can only remember it happening while doing camps . 
  why should they ? 
  they are attacking the camp with you . 
  but getting revealed ( red eye icon above your hero ) without any enemy doing something to reveal you , seems to be a bug . 
  real smashed us and were great that year , however they were n't that great after ancelotti left and before zidane came in . 
  barca is also arguably the best team in the world . 
  the semi final we had against them was very 50/50 despite our huge injury issues . 
  it was 0-0 til minute 78 in the first leg with great chances on both sides . 
  then messi happened . 
  the first game against atletico was decent . 
  the first half of the first leg sucked , but the second half was a great performance . 
  1-0 loss . 
  the second leg 's first 60 minutes was insane - many people said that this was the best and most dominant football performance they 've ever seen - even simeone said so . 
  we won that game 2:1 and were very unlucky to not advance . 
  it was n't atletico 's defence that made us drop out , but our finishing . 
  no other team managed to create that many chances against atletico . 
  this season we demolished the likes of arsenal , dortmund and wolfsburg with 5 goals , reached the semis despite playing against juve and benfica , who both won their league and a ( super - ) cup . 
  this is why we are ** arguably ** the best . 
  winning the champions league does not equal to being the best team . 
  even the very best are n't guaranteed to win the cl . 
  does that answer your question ? 
  not always \u2260 never, 
  probably because lehmann was playing for bvb during that time .
