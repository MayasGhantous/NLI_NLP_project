  our `` u '' is pronounced like `` you '' without the `` y | j '' sound . 
  think of words like foot or put . 
  to reproduce it , just say a long `` youuuuuuu '' . 
  the last sound you are making and holding is the `` u '' . 
  it 's similar to `` o '' , but your lips are tighter . 
  and if you were wondering how to pronounce jerome boateng in german :, 
   did n't ancelotti told him that he should go somewhere else ? 
  he told him he ca n't guarantee him a starting position . 
  that does n't exclude g\u00f6tze becoming a starter , he just has no guarantee . 
  if he plays well enough ( like his first season or the first half of his second and third season ) , he might aswell start . 
  ancelotti will use him , if he delivers , just like pep did . 
  to represent or not to represent - that is the question .

  a mountain with another summit is still a mountain . 
  why do you compare season ticket prices with club membership prices ? 
  being a member does not grant you free tickets . 
  you still have to buy a season ticket . 
   not good enough to play center back at the tournament . 
  the game in torino is a good example . 
  how about a counter-example : his games against dortmund , defending against micky , reus and obama ?

  the gsm buzz with them is so loud , i hate my friend for buying modmic so much , because of that annoying and loud sound . 
  gon na say that to my friend . 
  i hope it will help . 
  your phone is in constant contact with the nearest cell tower . 
  when your phone announces its location to said tower , you can hear the interference through most speakers . 
  this is called gsm buzz . 
  now , i do n't know why , but some microphones pick those interferences up - and when you are using voice-activation in a voice client , your mates will hear that sound . 
  and it 's ridiculously loud . 
  sure you can and that 's greatly appreciated . 
  if you know something about audio equipment and get a modmic , you 'll certainly slap a ferrite bead near the input to be safe , but most wo n't even bother , they bought this in the first place because it 's easy and hassle-free . 
  no , this is typical for the gsm architecture . 
  cdma does not pair with the nearest cell tower in the same way gsm does and that is why cdma does not buzz randomly , but still can as others pointed out in the comments below me . 
  you can get these at local stores for acoustics and electronic stores like radioshack .

  you do n't even have to calculate it yourself !, 
  just type in the size and price and min-max your pizza delivery : https://jeffkayser.com/projects/pizza-value-calc/, 
  no , but you can subtract the crust yourself if you deem it worthy . 
  it 's essentially just a calculation giving you the price per inch \u00b2 . 
  his example is confusing , but not wrong : a 2 inch pizza with 1 inch crust is just crust , since you have to remove the crust from both sides . 
  the 2 inch is n't the radius but the diameter . 
  a 3 inch pizza with a 1 inch crust has 1 inch for stuff . 
  it 's all hypothetical and really not that important . 
  indeed , fixed . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm normally not confronted with inches and just substituted cm \u00b2 with inch instead of square inch . 
  i watched him so much back in the day , but now i 'm just watching his youtube highlights - though i 'm always skipping the kripp nowadays .

  boateng matured tremendously in the last 4 years . 
  hopefully he will be our captain in the future . 
  o captain !,

  really depends on how you prefer to spend your money . 
  whether you want to pay full price or get it cheaper and whether you want bayern to get the money or a local shop . 
  okay , so we are not talking about the same jersey ? 
  then get the one you think looks better . 
  flocking the jersey is n't that expensive here . 
  if you want to save money , you can always buy them from a reseller like this one : http://www.ebay.de/itm/162070572169, 
  the kit costs around 60 $ there and flocking usually costs 10-20 $ .
