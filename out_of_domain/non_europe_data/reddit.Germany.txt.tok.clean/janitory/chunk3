  apparently you just put out english words and ca n't comprehend , what i was saying to you . 
  learning english does n't taint a culture . 
  i did not say that and you are implying that out of nowhere . 
  what taints a culture is choosing to adapt a foreign language , english in this case , into the everyday life . 
  if i 'm living in country x with language x , why should i bother to play games , watch movies/tv , read articles , etc in language y ? 
  ** not being able to speak english \u2260 choosing not to speak english **, 
  let the man play his games in the language he prefers . 
  some people will have problems with english no matter how hard they try and thus rather choose to speak , listen and hear their first language . 
   german attitude, 
  yeah , because it 's just a german thing to rather use the country 's official language rather than a foreign one , when it comes to daily life and thus not traveling or talking to foreigners . 
  maybe you did observe that i 'm somehow fluent in english and i 'm not talking german with you , am i ? 
  i watch my series with original dub , because i like it that way . 
  i also play my games in english , because of preferences , but i 'm not obligated as a foreigner to do everything the world has to offer in another language . 
  you are wrong . 
  the mechanics of a divine orb are quite different - you could roll the exact same stats again and thus it is 33 % and not 50 % . 
  well , you are fighting against elemental mobs with resists , i guess . 
  conductivity helps you there , but still they are more beefy than mobs without resists . 
  but where did you hit a wall ? 
  you stated , that you take long for clearing , but what is stopping you ? 
  this has to be true , otherwise it 's just sad . 
  did n't you expect that ? 
  and i would n't blame men in general , but rather people . 
  it took me way too long to get the joke ... but it was worth it !, 
  sorry to ask this noob question , but what 's the name of this rom ? 
  ah , good lord , that 's tremendous !, 
  thank you for that life-changing reallife-diminishing information !, 
  as a german i did nazi that cumming . 
  my cards are also stuck there . 
  i ca n't play anymore , because i do n't have enough players nor coins to play since yesterday . 
  so much better , even though there is no ut . 
  no comment inside yet !, 
  op is a faggot, 
  i 'm a pes player myself . 
  this year i did give fifa and fut a chance . 
  fut is amazing , but ea sucks as ever . 
  next year , i 'll stick to pes again . 
  also for the pc version of pes exists pesdit.com , introducing new leagues , kits , stadiums , players , faces , shoes , etc. 
  pesedit ignores the licensing and gives you a pes with all trademarked names and products . 
  op is referring to `` stark family children '' . 
  i will play pes again next year . 
  the only feature that pes does not have is fut . 
  the rest is even better or patchable . 
  after fifa and simcity , i wo n't give them money for some years . 
  the title is already quite fitting , because the german word for whale is wal . 
  it went * okay *, 
  now i 'm hungry . 
  hodor !, 
  you do n't fuck with muricans - ** muricans fuck you !, 
  opera has the same issue , but the newest version is downloadable through addons.opera.com . 
  [ the sidebar is n't up2date . 
  ] ( https://addons.opera.com/de/extensions/details/reddit-enhancement-suite-2/?display=en ), 
  sadly the configuration does n't automatically apply to the version downloaded through addons.opera.com :(, 
  u knuw nuthing , jun snuuuuuuuuuh !, 
  he cut off his hair to gain pace . 
  no one uses dante ? 
  dante is like david luiz 's brother . 
  you underestimate his ingame power . 
  just like war . 
  wait a second ... 
  the whole game had 3 offside goals . 
  it 's ridiculous, 
  i 'm pretty sure the information was leaked for money . 
  slightly cynical if you ask me . 
  fifflaren wants the d, 
  okay , let me rephrase it : do methods exist , which fool the server to believe you won the game , while the other party gets out of sync ? 
  [ i feel you , bro !,

  well , soccer has no room for cannibalism . 
  6 months/male/in your basement, 
  my rb is sprinting . 
  rt is dribble . 
  lb is for leaping the ball and lt gives effet . 
  maybe r3 or l3 . 
  i meant to say lift the ball over the keeper for instance . 
  sorry for the inconvenience , but the janitor is currently in me . 
  by mistake i read the first few words of the spoiler . 
  well , i also would n't have expected that to happen with youknowwho . 
  or just `` das phantom '' / `` the phantom '', 
  edgar davids, 
  dude . 
  stay faded . 
  the article just points out , that his manager says gomez has the strong tendency to leave the club , but the bayern management would only give him away for an appropriate price : `` we have a certain imagination [ regarding the price ] '' - rummenigge, 
  so he may be leaving , but there is nothing ultimately decided yet . 
  kill me today !, 
  op , this is not to be considered good advice . 
  this is actually the best advice !, 
  that bitch and the guys beating up the poor guy really piss me off . 
  i 'm contra violence , but that bitch deserved that slap . 
  fucking ~ ~ magic ~ ~ magnets !, 
  play some aoe ii, 
  it 's gramm ** a ** r , idiot ... 
  odd . 
  adler and boateng do n't have a strong link in that squad . 
  i like gw2 's music , but i like the ost of world of warcraft even more . 
  it has astonishing good ambient music . 
  [ here is the full classic wow ost ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbktn9wnoq ), 
  still mad because of g\u00f6tze ( and lewandowski ) ? 
  [ man , i ca n't see shit !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z75nrs3tv9y ), 
  as a bayern fan , i have to agree .
