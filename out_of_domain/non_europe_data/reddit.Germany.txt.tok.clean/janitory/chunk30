  cheating is not just hacking ... 
  they get tried as adults for severe crimes like homicide and rape . 
  no one younger than 18 gets tried as an adult for fraud or match-fixing . 
  the windows volume mixer ? 
  any . exe that gets updated gets its volume set to 100 % . 
  just change the ingame/app volume and leave it at 100 % in windows .

  i guess they wanted him to resemble [ bastian schweinsteiger ] ( http://www.wn.de/var/storage/images/wn/startseite/welt/wm-2014/die-deutsche-mannschaft/1586298-fussball-die-deutschen-spieler-bei-der-wm-bastian-schweinsteiger/50628612-1-ger-de/fussball-die-deutschen-spieler-bei-der-wm-bastian-schweinsteiger_image_630_420f.jpg ) , but no idea why they made snoo look like that . 
  i hope kimmich will stay at rb for the next game . 
  he plays that position better than every other option we had tried . 
  sure , but you have seen how much a good wingback can help the attack and neither h\u00f6wedes nor can or even rudy could create so many chances on that position . 
  he can defend well enough to play for us and his offensive qualities are superior to any other alternative in that position .

  shat on world class . 
  yeah , totally !!, 
  for instance , manu this season was such a joy to watch . 
  you can use the same argument for the other top leagues . 
  why do this `` league rankings '' i read on here almost always come from people who seemingly only watch a single league ? 
  yeah , you 're right in that point . 
  it 's your personal ranking regarding your preferences . 
  but at the same time the same point applies to my statement . 
  to me those rankings ** seemingly ** come from people with limited knowledge about other leagues . 
  on the first day in placement matches , i had this exact feeling . 
  after getting placed in 54 though , i had so many terrible players in my team . 
  and not the sort of just being not good at the game - no no no . 
  the type of players that are bad and start flaming the whole team . 
  could you respond with the conclusion of your discussion , please ? 
  i 'm very interested to know who of you both is right . 
  thank you !, 
  i do n't understand portuguese but was eager to know what you were talking about . 
  google translate is a mess when one wants to look for the exact meaning of certain wording .

  have you tried turning it off and on again ? 
  australians actually do pay more than us . 
  steam store prices for instance are higher than our prices . 
  games which cost 60 $ ( 54 $ | 80 kangaroo dollars , cost 60 $ ( 66 $ | 87 kangaroo dollars ) here in germany , but cost 80 $ ( 72 $ | 105 kangaroo dollars ) in australia . 
  our hardware prices suck and are often artifically higher than shipping , vat , etc would make them , but game prices are decent here , whereas australians have to pay huge margins . 
  khan ? 
  if you meant oliver kahn , he is not working for bayern . 
  he is working with the public broadcaster zdf as a pundit . 
  after writing my comment i noticed he 's german himself . 
  he just mistyped . 
  should have specified : most aaa titles like [ doom ] ( http://imgur.com/lcgt304 ) for instance or [ gta v ] ( http://imgur.com/irawz6f ) or [ fallout 4 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/adgtcav.png ) . 
  but the margin is still much higher . 
  not all games are more expensive , because not all publishers are dicks . 
  most smaller publishers are reasonable , but many big ones just want to milk the current situation . 
  that 's true . 
  i still remember reading about kahn and effe being bayern 's future management , but i have n't read anything about this for years now . 
  it would be great to see kahn again in m\u00fcnchen , but i do n't think that it will happen now . 
  [ this one ? 
  are you kidding ?

  sediansmomgivesgreatblowjobs, 
  edit : does n't work for me, 
  what ? 
  goal-wise , this was his best ever bundesliga season . 
  it 's the recent games where he was n't as effective as he used to be . 
  but it 's mostly the tactics that do n't fit his playstyle . 
  l\u00f6w forced m\u00fcller to play a certain way whereas guardiola and heynckes give him way more freedom to still be effective , but contribute enough in the team 's tactics . 
  m\u00fcller in this em was moving the ball around more than taking chances . 
  he was either playing wide or behind gomez/g \u00f6tze . 
  when he had his chances , he was out of luck . 
  all in all , he did n't play well in the em , but his season was very good , one of his best seasons to date . 
  nope , neuer is the better passer . 
  but saying this should n't take anything away from how great ter stegen is . 
  iran was democratic once until the us and the british fucked it up . 
  democracy will return there , no doubt about that . 
  the iranian people there are fed up with the regime and want a change . 
  the younger generations will shape the country sooner than later . 
  how about looking at the full three years instead of your cherry-picked `` actual facts '' ? 
  but first , let 's talk about last season . 
  pre-injury he played 4 out of 7 games fully and he was subbed in for each of the remaining 3 . 
  post-injury , he didnt play many games , because our squad was running smooth without him in a critical phase , where dortmund were still on our toes . 
  he was n't match fit and we did not need nor could we rely on him in that condition to beat our opponents . 
  he got enough chances after his dry spell , however he did n't deliver . 
  to criticize the benching of a player who did not manage to perform is unreasonable . 
  now that we 've analyzed your `` actual facts '' , let 's look through our `` rose-tinted memory '' :, 
  huh , was featured in nearly every single game , started the majority and played most of them for the whole duration . 
  surely not a regular player , just a `` squad player '' . 
  wow , all those comments under yours were deleted . 
  what did they say beside the obvious `` how ca n't you know that as a bvb fan '' or something like that ? 
  indeed . 
  and all you said does n't diminish what i said , but furthers it :, 
  he had many chances to show what he got , he delivered for a time and was played much . 
  when he was slacking , other players were put before him in more important matches . 
  whoever criticizes that has not played football himself or has no clue about formations/line-ups . 
  oh wow , that 's dark . 
  thank you for the information . 
  also you do n't have to know everything about the players as a fan .
