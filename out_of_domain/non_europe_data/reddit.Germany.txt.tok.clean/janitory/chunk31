  i should have put some `` bla bla `` s in the quote to make it more clear what i thought . 
  name your eevee `` rainer '' and it will become a vaporeon . 
  and no , this is no bullshit rumor . 
  have fun playing !, 
  an transaktion gebundene keys . 
  what you are basically saying is that every person in london has to follow the club in the city , which is geographically nearer to them . 
  what a ridiculous statement . 
  hmmm ... 
  yeah , seems right . 
  you ca n't really compare deisler to them . 
  he had a ton of injuries and mental health issues , his performances were great for us when he played . 
  not every jahrhunderttalent becomes a world class player . 
  for every neuer there will be a good number of failed talents like poldi or g\u00f6tze . 
  and that is n't something exclusive to bayern , it 's just fan rhetoric . 
  a poll where ? 
  ca n't compare them to the s\u00fcd . 
  they are a thing for itself . 
  nowhere near his brother , but atleast he also ca n't disappoint like his brother . 
  yeah , you 're right in that point . 
  however , you could do the same for many players that were hailed that great , left for a bigger club and kind of disappointed there . 
  i agree . 
  it sounded like you meant only bayern . 
  i misunderstood that . 
  that 's fundamental false statements for you . 
  no , he 's talking out of his ass . 
  the mass grave is being dug for the already dead `` traitors '' , because no cemetery wants to take them in . 
  the mayor said they will go to hell and that some people will curse their graves . 
  not that they are brought there to go to hell and no order to curse them . 
  surely shitty things to say as a mayor , but nowhere near the bullshit the op spouted . 
  when will you release more access codes ? 
  it 's the third day or so of you saying that the codes will release tonight . 
  thank you for the response . 
  i 'm just a bit annoyed because i checked all channels repeatedly in the last days because of your statements , staying up late and nothing came . 
  oh , removing the jewish part from his name to fit your narrative !, 
  it 's ali david sonboly . 
  is he also a jew because he is named david ? 
  oh my god . 
  check the profile , look at the clock symbol of the cover post . 
  it says `` added july 23 ** 2016 ** , 1:43 pm '' . 
  did he change his cover photo post-mortem ? 
  also , most iranians in germany are n't muslim . 
  in iran you have a hard time if you are n't officially muslim . 
  many people say they are , but they do not truly believe . 
  like i said , you believe anything that fits your narrative . 
  you should truly be more careful what you believe . 
  no side is always right . 
   and btw i take no sides . 
  being a retarded leftists saying ` those that commits attacks arent muslims ' is just as retarded as using full right arguments like calling for new crusades or some shit like that . 
  i agree with that . 
   i just make opinions based on what i know , if given all these attacks lately , europe should really do something with its muslim population . 
  specially with the new migrants ( those that came by the million and are n't even being investigated ), 
  my country , germany , took in the most refugees compared to any other western european country . 
  despite that , we suffer nearly no terrorist attacks compared to france and belgium . 
  it surely has a risk , but i rather take this risk and ultimately help millions of people than live in fear of some assholes who want us to live in fear & terror . 
   `` we regularly deactivate keys that were fraudulently obtained and resold . 
  in this case , we are currently investigating the origin of the fraud , and will update customers as soon as we have more information to share . 
  in the meantime , customers should contact the vendor from whom they purchased the key . '', 
   men do n't have to deal with that type of critical scrutinization . 
  no one is accusing wyman manderly or samwell tarly of being pregnant . 
  i hope you know that men also ca n't get pregnant . 
  to call sexism in this context is naive . 
  it 's not discriminating [ for the gender ] to argue about pregnancy or assume of someone being pregnant . 
  calling anything that is different between genders sexism does not further the feminist or egalitarian cause . 
  your second point is also quite naive . 
   to assume that sansa and ramsay could ** only be talking about a literal , physical product of rape ** rather than lingering emotional and spiritual damage is to undermine what it means to be a rape survivor . 
  when the theory was discussed on multiple subs on here , i literally saw no one out of hundreds of commenters stating that sansa 's pain could ** only ** mean that she 's pregnant , neglecting any emotional/psychological trauma . 
  the only one stating * that the * ** only ** * possible product of rape could be a pregnancy * is joanna robinson herself . 
  she 's using a strawmen 's argument to influence readers like you , who seemingly do not reflect what they just read . 
  hast anscheinend kein wissen \u00fcber das persien/dem iran der neuzeit oder den [ deutsch-persischen beziehungen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany%e2%80%93iran_relations#the_first_pahlavi_era_and_nazi_germany ) im letzten jahrhundert . 
  iranians are not arabs . 
  [ and iranians are more aryan than any german ever was . 
   it 's my kids who will have to re-conquer europe if this gets further out of hand . 
  a political stance like that enables the threat of radical islamism way more than open arms . 
  your goverment wrecked havoc in their territory , you are responsible for the crisis . 
  never forget that . 
  what the fuck ? 
  have you ever visited iran or know any iranians ? 
  you are an american and throw together all kinds of ethnicities into one pot . 
  you think they all share the same culture . 
  oh , the irony . 
  educate yourself . 
  iranian and persian culture is richer than the american `` culture '' and is not comparable to `` arabian culture '' . 
   yea , i 'm the ass hole , here . 
  good observation , comrade . 
  i have nothing to add to that . 
  not just someone . 
  it 's mila , who made the api which lead to most of the bots and maps . 
  many people are working together here : https://github.com/ahaaaaaaa/pokemongo-map - 185 contributors, 
  most others are either in it for the money or like to have their own go , want something less bloated or just have other ideals for the code . 
  dunno , works fine for me . 
  try adding www or just google for `` github pokemongo map '' . 
  it 's quite complicated for novices . 
  head to the wiki/help section for instructions on how tu use this . 
  simply put , the way all data is sent and received is not encrypted , but encoded . 
  thus with a little bit of knowledge , you can decode the data and write your little `` translator '' , the api , which encodes what you want to sent to niantic 's server and decodes what you receive from the server for you to use it .
