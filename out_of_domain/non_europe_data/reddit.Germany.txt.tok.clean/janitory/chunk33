  stern and rp-online are decent . 
  i think he that means they are n't good sources because of the time they were released . 
  it 's telling that chaosritter posts articles from january while there are way better articles released since then like this one from zeit :, 
  not only did a fuckton happen between january and now , he uses the stern and rp-online sources to give more credibility to his post and usage of fucking epochtimes .

  tsv alemannia aachen did in 2005 . 
  the year before they lost the dfb-pokalfinale to bremen ( 2:3 ) after eliminating fc bayern . 
  because bremen already had a spot for europe , aachen was credited with the uefa cup spot and managed to climb into the round of 16 , getting knocked out by az alkmaar . 
  huh , what about kruse , kramer and ( due to injury ) stranzl ? 
  they all were very integral parts of your team . 
  if they continue reaching atleast the semis and win it once , they will be regarded as top tier .

  nah mate , pep really wants to have 1000 dantes and a squad full of rafinhas . 
  pep just does n't want to talk about this stuff . 
  those questions do not interest him in the slightest . 
  if you ask him about tactics , his eyes will light up , but if you ask him how he feels about player x or manager y , he will just give some stupid positive answer so that he can move on to the next question . 
  das alte interview : https://streamable.com/cikw, 
  fucking hell , i was downvoted instantly for asking why he would choose koln over cologne or colonia if he ca n't type \u00f6 . 
  no solutions being found and nearly nothing new being tried regarding the tactical side . 
  we look so blunt . 
  if only we still had pep ... 
  tons of chances ? 
  they were mostly very bad chances . 
  3 shots on goal , that 's abyssmal . 
  yeah , i know that , that 's why i questioned tons of chances . 
  we had chances , but they  mostly < were n't good chances . 
  rafinha 's longshot , bernat 's longshot , a header by hummels and the m\u00fcller chance . 
  the rest were n't great . 
  sadly i 'm not living in the past , because the past was great . 
  i 'm stoked for the future , but we are talking about the present right now . 
   i get it , `` not winning '' is n't something we bayern fans are accustomed to . 
  most of our newer fans are n't , but i certainly experienced my fair share . 
  but that 's irrelevant . 
  we did not deserve to win with this mediocre performance . 
  if we had won , i 'd be happy about the result , but i 'd still be mad about the way we played .

  interesting idiom . 
  substituting m\u00e4nnchen for m\u00e4dchen is non-existant in our colloquial language . 
  if the ref clearly sees it , he will call it . 
  if he did not see it clearly and has to judge , he will take into account if the person is a known diver . 
  same story for any other diver out there , not just neymar . 
  well , he fucking is a filthy diver . 
  he also gets fouled harshly which is wrong , but that does n't mean he does n't dive .

  are you really asking why someone who spent almost 2 decades at the club is getting more money than a talented 24 year old , who was n't keen on staying anyway ? 
  i can understand where you are coming from , but no professional club that i know of handles their wages like you are proposing . 
  in addition to the athletic aspect other factors like loyality , marketability and identity are considered when deciding for a wage .

  i just got the notification and you are already getting downvoted , wow . 
  you are one of thousands of redditors . 
  some of them might be learning german or are interested in what the spoken words look like in text form . 
  if you are not interested in it , you can just skip the part . 
  `` macht '' is the conjugation ( third person singular ) of `` machen '' , which means `` to do '' and `` to make '' . 
  for instance :, 
  what you ** might ** have heard on the cd is `` macht '' - the german word for ** might ** ( like the might of a mighty warrior ) . 
  it 's the same coincidence like in the sentence above , however in german you can often easily distinguish those words from another since nouns are always starting with an uppercase and verbs do usually not ( of course there are [ many ] exemptions ) . 
  indeed . 
  literally it 's `` no joke '' or rather `` without [ a ] joke '' . 
  it 's a colloquial way of saying `` honestly '' or `` literally '' , when something uncommon happens .
