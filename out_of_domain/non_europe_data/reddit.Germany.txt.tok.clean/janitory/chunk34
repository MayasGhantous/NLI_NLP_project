  yes , it 's dutch for `` auch '' or also/too . 
  the general rule of thumb is that you use `` machen '' when you produce anything be it a cake , homework , a broken nose , worries , any feeling - anything really . 
  whereas `` tun '' is less flexible and the more literal translation of `` to do '' . 
  tun can sometimes be used just like machen . 
  what are you doing ? 
  -  was tust du ? 
  sometimes the word can also be more freely translated as `` to act '', 
  -  do n't act like that !, 
  the direct translation would be a playful `` do not do so . '', 
  im englischen sagt man ja tats\u00e4chlich `` if my grandmother had wheels she would be a streetcar '' .

  no , this is nonsense . 
  it did only work because it was so unexpected and due to overtime . 
  overtime increased the death timers and they could not counter bastion in time . 
  had they known bastion were coming or if they had more time , they could have easily countered him . 
  if he were any good , you 'd see him way more in pro plays . 
  but as it stands , he sucks for attacking except in some rare occasions like this one . 
  * roadhog hook, 
  * pharah rockets, 
  * ana sleep, 
  * junkrat spam, 
  * soldier 67 rocket + a small burst of hits, 
  * hanzo/widow, 
  * d.va matrix + any dps, 
  i could name you even more . 
  genji reflect puts the burden of defeating bastion on himself instead of you , the counter . 
  a decent bastion does n't get killed by it , but being stationary gets him killed without nearly a chance by anything listed above . 
  even then , the call came before the goal and may have influenced neuer 's reaction .

  roger schmidt said this to him when leverkusen played hoffenheim . 
  he was hyped up by the media and he delivered . 
  i think he is a really great coach with a successful career ahead of him .

  yes and no . 
  we payed around 7 million $ for him , which was a lot during that time for someone , who only became a mediocre back-up player . 
  we gained nothing back , because he left on a free transfer . 
  but atleast he did something compared to some others i mentioned . 
   4 ) it was helpful to prove that you germans will never change and that history did not teach you that presumption does n't always mean `` victory '' . 
  seriously ? 
  what a douchey thing to say . 
  still wrong though , since you would be stealing the money . 
  the printing is way more applicable . 
  exploiters did not take ap away from anyone . 
  those items were generated and added , just like printing money introduces more money into the economy instead of taking it away from a bank . 
  it has to matter , since you can find this `` argument '' in nearly every thread about rb leipzig - most of the time from someone , who does not even live in east germany or even germany at all .

   [ ... ] if two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches ,, 
  the following criteria are applied in the order given to determine their rankings :, 
   a. higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the, 
  teams in question ;, 
   b. superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in, 
  question ;[ ... ], 
  the confusing part for you might be `` among the teams in question '' . 
  only the teams on equal points are compared . 
  first head-to-head , then their goal difference of those head-to-head matches and so on . 
  that guy arguing with you seems to have a problem with simple logic .

  no , because schulz is an actual honest politician and not some orange-colored buffoon . 
  ask yourself : would you think the same way about this if he was canadian ? 
   this still is a form of censorship and whitewashing of history when it is done in this fashion . 
  at least extra history tried to address it before they made the videos . 
  only someone who does n't have a clue about nazi related laws in germany would say something like this . 
  for educational purposes and many artistic works ( except games ) the usage of nazi symbolism is allowed . 
  nothing gets whitewashed . 
  everyone learns about our past and knows why and where these symbols are forbidden . 
  i could use it in a caricature with zero problems , but i 'm not allowed to wear a swastika t-shirt . 
  it is indeed censorship , but not every form of censorship is bad or detrimental . 
  [ even the us is not a country with true free speech . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions ), 
  i do n't like that myself . 
  it is because video games unlike films are not considered works of art in the legal sense . 
  the last couple of years showed a movement towards more social acceptance for video games and gaming is becoming so big , that the legalities behind it are bound to change . 
  until then you can try to get the uncensored versions from abroad ( via vpn for instance ) or just patch it .
