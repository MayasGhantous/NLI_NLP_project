  it 's not forbidden to play or own these games , just selling them or advertising them is forbidden if they have no usk rating - which they most likely do n't get with nazi symbolism . 
  i think you meant adonis ? 
  aeneas is a trojan , an important person in roman mythology . 
  he is considered to be the ancestor of the romans . 
  adonis is the symbol of youthful beauty . 
  my mistake then . 
  i was a bit baffled , because i 've never seen anyone compare someone to aeneas ( online ) while adonis is commonly used . 
  getting downvotes for stating your valid opinion . 
  lol - this sub is pathetic sometimes . 
  i also did not have a problem with any of these . 
  some people are just bad at them , which is fine . 
  not everyone is good at everything , but instead of blaming themselves they try to shift the blame on lag or blizzard or whatever . 
   also , it doesnt reward greed , more work than anything . 
  yeah , sure . 
  tell that to the hard working middle class , while the rich are getting richer doing barely anything . 
  you do n't really think that they lift a finger themselves instead of hiring personal for that , do you ? 
  yes, 
   the game against bayern would have ended in a draw if they had n't been denied a clear handball penalty and red card on bayern 's martinez in the 85th minute . 
  martinez basically volleyballed away a header straight on the open goal . 
  [ bayern however did not get 2 penalties .

  because he is one big pussy . 
  and the winning goal was assisted by former leipzig player anthony jung . 
  it 's like every time he cuts inside , the defenders accept their cruel fate . 
  he just told you that it is fine to have these symbols in artworks . 
  video games are not considered art in germany and while i think they should be considered art , there is no big enough movement or petition or campaign to include them yet . 
  and it is not freedom of expression to draw some edgy nazi symbols . 
  neither is celebrating the atrocities of the nazis . 
  i 'm against silencing nazis , because that would be limiting freedom of expression , but prohibiting the use of nazi glorification is nowhere near what you are suggesting with your mental gymnastics . 
  so , should lies under oath also be protected ? 
  since they are speech and `` speech is still speech '' . 
   sure thing thats also why the justisminister wants to make writting `` fake news '' punishable with 5 years in prison, 
  are you trying to act informed by misspelling german words ? 
  because not only did you misspell the word , you also are spouting bullshit . 
  what he actually said is that if you ** heavily insult ** someone in public office , ** the current legislature ** sees it fit to punish you accordingly with ** up to 5 ** years of prison . 
  and he suggested that fake news and facebook/online posts in general should not be an exemption to this ** already-in-place ** law . 
  what you are doing here is literally fake news . 
  fuck you . 
   to answer your question , no i do n't know that . 
  the law he cites is n't followed on by a source . 
  the article talks about slander , but i do n't take news articles as law . 
  with that in mind , if he says the law says `` heavily insult '' then i have to assume he is reading it off from the law he refers to as i have nothing else to compare it to . 
  that 's a pretty lame excuse for not knowing what is being discussed and not bothering to research the topic yourself before participating in this discussion . 
  i did not cite any law , because it 's basic understanding that libel and slander are considered unlawful actions . 
  and it 's not my failure that you did not understand that `` heavy insults '' might be more than calling someone an idiot . 
  i did n't add the adjective for funsies . 
  it 's not only political figures . 
  it 's actually valid for everyone . 
  no matter who you insult that enormously for the law to apply . 
  if you are a public official ( police , most teachers , politicians , etc ) your superior is allowed to sue on your behalf . 
  that 's the only change to `` normal '' people in regards to slander/libel . 
  it 's not like the usa does n't do the same :, 
  it 's right that i did not deliver a correct translation . 
  it does n't change the fact that you are again ignoring the adjective . 
  i did n't talk about normal insults . 
  i added `` heavily '' , because i did n't have the exact translation in my head while typing . 
  it should have indicated to you , that there has to happen something more than a normal insult for the law to apply . 
   inadequate summation of a law, 
  so inadequate that i found the exact laws just by searching the words given by me in google . 
  and for fucks sake , why should i deliver a direct source about a law when i 'm translating what our justice minister said . 
  i was not citing any law , i was paraphrasing a person . 
  no , you are completely wrong with my motive . 
  i did n't want to educate the guy about the law nor anyone else . 
  i wanted to show that he is spreading false statements . 
  when person a says : `` apples are healthy ! '', 
  and person b tells everyone that person a said `` apples are shit !, 
  '' , then i do n't have to show you why apples are healthy , i just need to deliver you a source , in which person a said his statement . 
  not considered art de jure , of course :p, 
  then go tell a police officer that he is a disgusting pig cunt sucker and that you fucked his mom . 
  i 'm sure it 's totally okay for you to do that , right ? 
  we call them insults , you call them fighting words . 
  nobody bats an eye if you call someone an idiot or moron or asshole . 
  but everything has its limits . 
  and by the way , you might think that this is a garbage law . 
  but it is your country that fucking mutes nearly any usage of fuck in media . 
  so get real . 
  it 's not like we are afraid of any bad words and therefore sue anyone who uses them . 
  freedom in our sense stops where it would diminish the freedom of another person . 
  ugh , could you just shut up for once ? 
  your bias is obvious . 
  in every bayern thread today you posted bullshit . 
  do n't you get bored with your dumb attempts at trolling ?

  his father already had a secret deal with barcelona . 
  no way we could 've gotten him had we pursued further . 
  halt , stop !, 
  maybe now certain commentators can distinguish him from alaba . 
  i 'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life but thank you all for playing with me . 
  i too have proved my worth , odyn !,

  if these false champions will not yield the aegis by choice then they will surrender it in death !, 
  give up the aegis or die ! '', 
  lol !, 
  that 's total bullshit . 
  whoever told you this was either trolling you or bad mouthing germany for whatever reason . 
  ever heard of gamescom ?
