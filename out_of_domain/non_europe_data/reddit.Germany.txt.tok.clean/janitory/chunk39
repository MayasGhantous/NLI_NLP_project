  what does your mother have to do with this ? 
   government should never be in the business of thought/belief control . 
  teach people to become more critical , do n't start `` banning '' fake news , as merkel first started preaching . 
  you fail to understand the whole concept of `` fake news '' before the likes of trump and co abused it . 
  things that are objectively false , also called lies and falsehoods , posted with malicious intent should be banned . 
  if you grab a picture of a 31 year-old refugee from the internet and post it online with the caption : `` this guy registered as a sixteen year old . 
  cuck cuck cuck '' then yeah , that shit should be banned . 
  that 's defamation/libel and forbidden in this country . 
  and you ca n't teach all people to become more critical . 
  not everyone is smart enough to recognize propaganda . 
  that 's very unrealistic . 
  so , merkel and many other german politicans advocate against the spread of lies and falsehoods . 
  trump on the other hand calls anything fake that puts him into a bad light . 
  be careful not to cut yourself on those edges !, 
  and in which press photo op with another world leader was this taken ? 
  such a stupid comparison . 
  i do n't remember a single us president who looked even remotely that bad in a similar situation , do you ? 
  oh wow , i did n't know that you are retarded . 
  had i known then i would have explained to you why using a picture of an individual and combining it with an obvious , defamatory lie might be libel . 
  i also would have told you that your knowledge about your country 's justice system might vary from other countries ' systems . 
  and i would have explained to you in detail where you lack any understanding of ** fair ** liberty and freedom towards other persons , because a individual 's liberty and freedom can and should only go so far as to not diminish the liberty and freedom of another individual . 
  the situation i pointed out is a clear cut libel case , which is a criminal defamation , which is a fucking crime here . 
  how dense can you be to not even be able to read up on something after you got your ass handed ? 
  nice try , though . 
  just ignore any facts and points and keep on spouting bullshit .

  : thinking :, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  lose-lose-situation . 
  damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  consider this :, 
  club | points | goal difference, 
  team apple | 31 | +5, 
  team banana | 31 | +4, 
  team cherry | 29 | -2, 
  team date | 69 | +420, 
  the last matches to be played are apple vs. banana and cherry vs. 
  date . 
  team cherry is the team we look at for our matter . 
  they win against date 2:0 and get 32 points total with a gd of 0 . 
  club | points | goal difference, 
  team apple | 31 | +5, 
  team banana | 31 | +4, 
  team cherry | 32 | 0, 
  team date | 69 | +418, 
  however cherry ca n't get ahead of apple and banana at the same time since either one wins and gets 34 pts or they draw and both remain above cherry with 32 points tied , but better gd . 
  now look back at our image here . 
  it just considers the point total , but does not consider any other match-ups . 
  if club a loses , another club has to win , which this image does not count aswell for it 's placings, 
  the austrians trolled the polish by putting a red bar above their flag , forming it into another austrian flag . 
  poland restored themselves pretty quickly though .

  lol . 
  this whole `` relevant xkcd '' thingy is just another representation of selection bias . 
  and if i remember it correctly , he said this saturday at sky before the match against wolfsburg and did not mention mbappe as a possible target and furthermore , he even doubted that bayern are interested in him , because bayern does not look for a player in his position since lewandowski is contracted until 2021 and a player like mbappe would n't wan na be the benchwarmer behind lewy .
