  let the top nav bar be default , please . 
  pretty please . 
  the rest is neat , good work . 
  you should rephrase that . 
  they do not have the only decent football game . 
  if you ever played pes , you 'd know , that pes is the better game in many perspectives , but lacks licenses , which they ca n't get , because of nasty contracts between fifa and ea . 
  well , you both managed to fail at getting my joke . 
  i was trying to be the m\u00fcnchen fan , who does not know about bremen being in germany , hence the `` wat '', 
  [ you mean like this ? 
  glad you noticed , 
  just imagine our squad with him in addition . 
  [ the first one is the best one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nzcplsh.png ), 
  [ link to the original creator 's yt video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdqelkuv0fo ), 
  why does spherasports.com embed this video into their page without giving credits ? 
  the only man i know of , who could compete with him honor-wise , is fictional and dies in a lot of movies . 
  [ all the feels , man . 
  [ the turkish league might be included .

  i 'm hoping to be able to link emenike with drogba in fut for multiple anus raping . 
  lahm - martinez - dante - alaba, 
  [ thiago might have a fever . 
  i 'm so happy to see kroos and m\u00fcller play together again in the bundesliga . 
  thank you !, 
  to hide that they are botting/buying coins . 
  i was talking in general . 
  you already stated , that you did n't do it on purpose . 
  i spoke to ** several ** blizzard employees at gamescom today , who assured me , that the eu beta will begin in some days !, 
  not weeks or months , days !!!!, 
  sadly they do n't giveaway beta keys there , everyone has the same chance on winning one key by participating in the standard beta subscriptions ( unless you are a press member/progamer/famous streamer/obama ) . 
  edit : [ proof that i was at gamescom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pzz2c0l.jpg ), 
  i got the key chain by being in the hearthstone booth . 
  sure , wait a couple of minutes !, 
  i 'll deliver !, 
  there you go , updated the first post . 
  thought about including a picture of me and jessica nigri , but well , i did n't :p, 
  i should have made a video of it . 
  but you can trust me , i have no reason to troll the community of crackstone . 
  just because the downvote function can be abused , does not mean you should remove it . 
  what 's the point of voting now , if you ca n't filter out the good stuff anymore ? 
  people are more likely to upvote instead of downvote and i do n't like reading 10 jokes about something before the real contribution post appears . 
  i liked the css of this sub , but you are forcing me to turn it down , just so i can use reddit the way it should be used . 
  if you want your downvote function back , either go into your reddit settings and turn off subreddit styles , which will turn of the css of every subreddit or install [ res ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) , a browser plugin , which will also enhance reddit to your liking . 
  walker white, 
  g\u00f6tze did slow down to prevent an injury . 
  this is the only reason , that ramires was hitting the ball before him . 
  nice penalty , bro, 
  today you ; tomorrow me, 
  please do not hop on de train aswell . 
  crying about it does n't help , does it ? 
  just be patient like the rest of us . 
  maybe he is n't old enough to have paypal or a credit card . 
  they speak hochdeutsch . 
  to avoid confusion , hochdeutsch is regular german . 
  sometimes you can hear a slight bavarian accent or words , but it 's mostly hochdeutsch . 
  do n't choose the vote of the majority . 
  rather choose one person for the whole deck as a `` coach '' . 
  nice !, 
  but what about pc ? 
   your, 
  but where is obelisk ? 
  you forgot to mention the headbutt victim, 
  [ his brother michael played for bvb ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_rummenigge ), 
  he had an interview afterwards where he thought , that he missed , but his mates were jumping at him and the ball was in , so he was surprised and unsure what happened . 
  also he did talk to the referee , he just could n't say what really happened , because he was turning away mid-flight . 
  this is wrong . 
  there was a gap , which was ` fixed ' mid-game - shortly after the phantom goal . 
  a hole in the net is still a gap . 
  one string of the net was ripped apart and this gap made enough room to fit the ball . 
  sadly it is unknown whether the ball ripped it apart or the gap was present prior to the header . 
  there was a scene , where you could see him talking to the ref , but he forgot what he exactly told him . 
  he said , that he was surprised about the goal and was doubtful about it . 
  looking at his mimic and gesture ( of the ref-talking scene ) this seems to be the case . 
  the dilemma is that the goal was indeed allowed . 
  the referee had a perfect view , but was in doubt , because the ball was in the goal and the gap/hole in the net was not obvious . 
  his assistant also called for goal and simon rolfes , who had a shitty angle , was celebrating thinking it was a goal . 
  the german commentator ( sky ) also did not see it at first . 
  he just thought no one is really celebrating , because it was an easy goal and the game was already won . 
  i read that as `` minor hand-shaking '' . 
  why ca n't motorboating be the `` new hand-shake '' ? 
  which makes it even better !, 
  still wrong !, 
  in this case ` he ' is op . 
  the mentioned possibilities :, 
  * op + lil ' op + 3 offsprings, 
  * lil ' op + 4 offsprings and op as the coach, 
  clear now ? 
  - ricolla ( in the background  licola !, 
  see ya in an other life , brotha !, 
  paladin : consecration , equality ( + wild pyromancer ) , secrets, 
  mirror entity + ice block, 
  thank you so much !, 
  great work !, 
  do n't tell me what to do , janitor !, 
  it 's similar to getting called a hobo or freeloader . 
  considered an insult , but one you can easily laugh at . 
  i 'm german , can not confirm . 
  it 's pronounced as `` iron money '' . 
  i 'm sorry that people downvote you . 
  most germans indeed pronounce `` iron '' like `` eye-ren '' . 
  i just ca n't confirm , that everyone pronounces it like that - i certainly do n't .
