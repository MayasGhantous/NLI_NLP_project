  my heart is still racing . 
  what an incredible game . 
  you are like the opta of moronic drivel . 
   poor hopeful/positive bayern fans who thought it was an upgrade . 
  literally no one in their right mind thought this . 
  regression ins primitive . 
   even better those thugs are ~ ~ probably ~ ~ ~ ~ muslims ~ ~ islamists . 
  everybody believing or following islam is in general a muslim . 
  islamists are muslims who want everyone to follow the political islam . 
  see islam and islamism . 
  in witcher ? 
  you can put your groceries back into the cart and have all the time in the world to bag them [ at the large table/shelf ] ( https://unternehmen.aldi-sued.de/fileadmin/fm-dam/company_photos/us_presse/bilddatenbank_2016/filiale_verkaufsraum/_c_aldi_sued_filiale_kassenbereich_packtisch_72dpi.jpg ) right behind the checkouts . 
  it 's so that elderly or slow people do n't jam the queue . 
  guys , someone help this poor fellow . 
  these ramblings clearly indicate a stroke . 
  cool !, 
  the better question here would be : `` what about him makes him not a cunt ? '', 
  and 4th division now ... :(, 
   please , aachen fans , correct me if i 'm mistaken . 
  nah , it 's pretty on point . 
  the club recently declared bankruptcy , changed management ( again ) and signed some promising players . 
  maybe we 'll turn around now . 
  yeah , but dropping that far down happened in the last couple of years . 
  [ for reference ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/timeline/0420cb79e5a8a7bee36a5f371804ace8.png ), 
  one of the nicest stadiums i 've been to yet . 
  it would be the 11th biggest stadium in the bundesliga ( bigger than the likes of leverkusen and wolfsburg ) . 
  imo it 's pretty both inside and outside and it builds a great atmosphere if enough people are in it . 
  [ here are some pictures ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=tivoli+aachen&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  i only have selfmade pictures with me or family members in it , which i do n't want to share for obvious reasons . 
  it can seat up to nearly 33.000 people , but being in the 4th division the average attendance is just a 5th of it 's possible capacity . 
  due to the financial issues , the stadium no longer belongs to the club . 
  they sold it to the city of aachen for $ 1.00 ( yes , just 1 $ ) and rent it now in a staggered contract depending on their division . 
  the stadium costs $ 2m yearly in maintenance , which is why they had to sell it . 
  i really hope we can climb back up again . 
  i 'd love to be able to attend 2 . 
  bundesliga games again regularly . 
  the stadium is also located relatively near to the city ( 5 min drive from the city core without traffic ) with good public transit connections , which makes `` traveling '' there pretty much hassle-free . 
  kerkrade is together with germany 's herzogenrath ( near aachen , which is located at the be-nl-de border ) a so called twin city . 
  the border between germany and netherlands goes right through the city street called neustra\u00dfe on one side and nieuwstraat on the other side . 
  quite harmonic , really . 
  i dislike him . 
  he plays incredible football , but he is a rat on the pitch . 
  he embellishes to a huge degree while sometimes playing really dirty against his opposition . 
  he is also known for his dives . 
  and i 've heard that off the pitch , he is n't one of the nicest fellows to be around either . 
  and the cherry on top is the driver 's license affair . 
  just like timo werner showed this season : great player , but a cunt . 
  however it 's still sad to see him injured all the time . 
  real pity . 
  i think he is referring to [ manga spoiler ] ( #s `` gene manipulation by judge vinsmoke '' ), 
  \u2611 top reddit user, 
   the complete anti-thesis to a * stereotypical * german, 
  ftfy, 
  lol, 
  top kek, 
  / r/absolutnichtich _ iel, 
  adriano would like a word in this, 
  today 's the day, 
  everyone here crying that rb is n't selling because it 's a pl club asking and leipzig could therefore milk them , completely neglecting that ** rb does not want to sell and they do not need the money ** . 
  if you want keita , you have to spend a ridiculous amount of money to change the mind of that disgusting board of theirs . 
  some people here really need to get real . 
  stop making this a pl issue and recognize that this is one of the factors why the vast majority in germany does not want these corporations in football .

  he did not have hummels . 
  if you look at his tenure at bayern and actually look who had to play because of injuries , tactics etc you would n't argue that he is doing well just because of world class players .

  thanks for sharing !, 
  great photos . 
  i 'm german and deem this funny . 
  it 's slightly taboo , if at all . 
  you can crack your jokes and nothing will happen . 
  you wo n't go to jail for jokes . 
  you can crack jokes at hitler and nazis all you want . 
  you can also joke about jews and other minorities , but that 's ( logically ) seen as tasteless and is frowned upon . 
  fuck off to trumpistan . 
  * you 're , you moron, 
  ancelotti does n't even find place to put javi back in midfield , how could he make room for dier then ? 
  smells like bullshit to me . 
  nice copypasta , gon na use that in future . 
   internet edge lords, 
  du hast talent . 
  you could be worse off ... :(,

  i watched the interview and he is just saying that renato is moaning the most , but not late . 
  often late are vidal and sometimes costa according to him . 
  you mean all the terrorist groups that are from the region your country is bombing the shit out of for decades ? 
  you have it easy talking from thousands of kilometers away .

  feels like borderlands . 
  it has a huge borderlands vibe to it . 
  yeah , this should get some traction so that ethan sees this and can do something about it . 
  certainly no adequate dembele replacement , but considering how little time was left this window , this is a good signing . 
  dortmund 's offensive is pretty stacked now , if all players are fit , some will be pretty disappointed about their play time . 
  this is just sad . 
  this is one of the worst complaints i 've yet encountered . 
  deathmatch is a game mode that exists longer than most of the players playing this game .
