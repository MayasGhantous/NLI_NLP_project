  the best leftback in the world secured until 2018 - we are so spoiled !, 
  i just bought one - will post results as soon as it gets to me . 
  if it 's fake , then i get my money back anyways and if it 's not , then this is a pretty good deal . 
  there are people , who do n't do it on purpose and i guess your opponent might be one of them . 
  i 'm currently sitting against someone who deliberately bugged the game out , emoted `` the pleasure is mine '' and does not want to concede , because he would be dead next turn . 
  yeah , that 's the shitty part and i do n't want to defend that , but `` atleast '' he did n't do it on purpose and trolled you with an emote :p, 
  when u get a wizdom u will realize throwin dolla dolla bill y' all away isnt smart w / or w/o work brah, 
  lynnangel has a point and looking at your comments you might be the retard here . 
  you might have had several relationships with men that did n't work out , but you should n't give up on it just because of a few bad relationships . 
  you are n't considering yourself bi , so why do you think that this will work out better ? 
  but if you really want to find someone of your own gender , then i recommend online dating sites or `` gay bars '' . 
  no problem !, 
  glad i could help you , 
  did you just donate 100 $ worth of dogecoins ? 
  very kind, 
  wow, 
  so generous, 
  very noble, 
  i 'd love to own a black widow ultimate . 
  three of my friends have a black widow and i used those multiple times and i fell in love with mechanical keyboards . 
  i tried to save for one , which i failed to achieve to due medical payments . 
  getting one as a gift is not possible due to family problems . 
  130 $ is just too much for me ( student of a grammar school , living at home ) . 
  my current keyboard is a [ ocz alchemy elixir ] ( http://geizhals.de/ocz-alchemy-series-elixir-keyboard-verschiedene-layouts-a361189.html ) , which i bought 4-5 years ago for ~ 10 $ . 
  serves me well , but it has its bugs and problems . 
  maybe i can convince you with some nostalgy . 
  [ meet my nearly 8-year-old razer krait and razer mantis . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdxg9jj.jpg ) sorry for the blur and the stains , but well , the years leave its marks . 
  they served me well and i absolutely love the krait - so much , that even though the mouse wheel is [ broken \\ ( i had to cut it open , check for the blockage and glue it together , but the wheel still does n't want to glide up like it used to \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sbwcsai.jpg ) i did n't get a new one . 
  i tried to get my hands on a cheap naga from ebay , unfortunately the chinese seller was a scammer and i received my money back today  . 
  happy new year and thank you for giving us all this chance to win some neat gear . 
  i see it as an homage rather than an insult .

  i 'm german , living at the nl-be-ger border and no one i met in my entire life has that sort of accent except frenchmen . 
  you are achieving that , no doubt !, 
  they stretched that accent pretty hard though . 
  the only german i know of , that speaks in [ such a horribly bad accent is lothar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tp7hehx5s ) . 
  the video was good though , made me chuckle . 
  try to pronounce the th as the buzzing `` s '' . 
  no ms -  no ms powers -  no susano'o, 
  no , she resembles cat way more than a typical stark . 
  edit : cat says the same thing in the show and in the books , but keep ignoring that ... 
  what ? 
  i 'm saying that it should be cat instead of eddard marrying a frey to create such a creature . 
  yes , you can add thousands of server plugins , enhancing the gameplay and negating any sort of griefing, 
  still funny though, 
  play 1 game and you can get two jerseys off the ah . 
  shut up !, 
  [ button di gomez ] ( http://www.gomezbutton.it ), 
  i would gladly take it , if the price wont be too high . 
  i am still playing with my razer krait from 6 or 7 years ago , but sadly do not have enough funds to replace it with a new one . 
  if you want the mouse to have a owner who will take good care of her , then pick me :p, 
  it 's still in fifa . 
  pressing both analog sticks ( l3 + r3 ) will do it . 
  all those summer children downvoting you did not experience winter 's cold yet . 
  you have to fly through those stone rings up the stairs on the right side of the summoning stone . 
  the portal is not always visible , but nevertheless functioning . 
  how much do you want for the 560 gtx and/or mamba ? 
  \u30fd \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 \uff89 oj poured and candle lit , with this chant i summon kripp \u30fd \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88 \uff89, 
  it 's the same for flex . 
  thanks !, 
  did n't know that, 
  [ my most hated and most used celebration in fifa ] ( http://www.bz-berlin.de/multimedia/archive/00369/italien-balotelli_36999918.jpg ), 
  using your hand to push or shove is not allowed . 
  if he had used his body , then there would be no one arguing . 
  even poldi knew it was a foul and had a quite surprised look towards the referee . 
  it is known . 
  he was also responsible for aiding borussia dortmund during their huge debt a decade ago . 
  nice !, 
  i also have bought one , [ but with this picture . 
  ] ( http://www.unlimited-wallpaper.com/wp-content/gallery/sport-2/bayern-munchen-fc-football-logo-hd-wallpaper.jpg ), 
  or `` the valley that rides '', 
  why would you directly link to the gif , if the file 's already on gfycat ? 
  the possibility to watch the html5 version , which not only saves tons of bandwith , but also loads much faster than a gif . 
  so strong , this robert . 
  for people who ca n't access the livestream because of licensing issues ( germany , for instance ) , use [ proxmate ] ( http://proxmate.dave.cx ) for chrome ( and opera v20 + ) or firefox, 
  this requires decent show-writing . 
  and ie, 
  i 'm not sure why you are downvoted . 
  valencia risked injuring boateng with his action . 
  schweinsteiger was late , but rooney could have just jumped over it , but dived and caused schweini to miss next match . 
  ridiculous that people are defending rooney there . 
  if it had been robben there , then people would go apeshit over such a dive . 
  yes !, 
  thank you !, 
  i always liked vidic for being such a testosterone-filled monster , who fears nothing . 
  mandzukic brushes vidic 's jaw with his arm while jumping and vidic suddenly acts like a little bitch and holds his forehead . 
  that was just pathetic to watch . 
  all in all it was a great effort by both teams , but there were certain points in this game were i disliked both sides . 
  wow , such bias . 
  did n't you know ? 
  rooney never dives !!, 
  did you watch the game last night ? 
  i guess not . 
  welbeck shot the goal more than a second after the ref already whistled .
