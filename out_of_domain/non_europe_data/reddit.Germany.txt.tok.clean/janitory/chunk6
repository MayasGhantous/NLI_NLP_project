  he nearly shoved his foot into martinez face , he would not have gotten the ball , if he had not played with a high leg there . 
  remember the mandzukic yellow against vidic ? 
  that was pathetic playacting from vidic . 
  he holds his fuckin forehead after getting touched on the jaw/chin , not even hit , by mandzukic 's arm . 
  [ and you really think that rooney did not dive here ? 
  ] ( http://gfycat.com/immediatesharpindiancow#?speed=0.25 ) sorry , but then you are not worthy for further discussion . 
  he even looks to the fucking ref after throwing his head in the back , his hands in the air . 
  totti also spend a part of his youth career at roma . 
  he plays for roma since '89 ( age 13 ) . 
  it 's his 25th year playing for roma . 
  i was just adding further information . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you . 
  #get hyped, 
  i have res and i 'd love if that existed !, 
  i think people are exaggerating . 
  i 've read multiple times on / r/soccer now that we are just a bunch of divers and cheaters . 
  i want to hear the general opinion of other bayern supporters . 
  of course , we might be biased , but surely there will be objective opinions . 
  i like that theory . 
   downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you do n't personally like it . 
  think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you 're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion . 
  if you simply take a moment to stop , think and examine your reasons for downvoting , rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction , you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons . 
  do you think that saying `` rooney does n't dive . 
  just coz [ sic ] your players have a diving habit does n't mean other players dive aswell '' has contributed to the discussion ? 
  in my opinion it did not , so i downvoted him . 
  did i downvote his other posts ? 
  i disagree with him , yes , still , i just downvoted that one single post . 
  so please , brah , do n't confront me with the reddiquette . 
  do you even lift ? 
  martinez and schweinsteiger are likely to play due to both of them ( sadly : c ) missing out on the next champions league game . 
  got neymar  my best pull yet, 
  augsburg fought valiantly , augsburg fought nobly , augsburg fought honorably . 
  and augsburg deserved to win . 
  actually i 'm just hyped about game of thrones returning in about 30 hours . 
   `` rhaegar fought valiantly , rhaegar fought nobly , rhaegar fought honorably . 
  and rhaegar died . 
  i 'm already hyping myself to no-end , but sky also mentions it the whole time while i 'm following today 's bundesliga matches . 
  i know , but instead of having it in the quote itself , the contrast is now presented in the comparision of my comment and the referenced quote . 
  indeed, 
  mercy , my lord . 
  for every time it is falsely confirmed , the release date gets postponed by a day . 
  the people are n't different . 
  there is no raff the sweetling in the show and some of polliver 's show lines belong to `` book raff '' . 
  but the rest is different , sure . 
  i 'm just curious who will get mercy from her now in his stead . 
  see you at the ( currently ) 2043 hl release party on venus or mercury !, 
  [ quality hatemail ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr8ncmbfyvo ), 
  indeed . 
  and iirc bayern was 2:0 ahead in the second game , but threw the game .

  nice picture . 
  you two seem to be a very good couple . 
  hope you will have a nice future and i love that both of you can easily ignore/compensate the insults and jokes , 
  i think you 've misread something :p, 
  no problerino frappocino pepperoni, 
  i could write you a short tutorial , but there is an [ easier method posted here \\ ( step 5 \\ ) . 
  ] ( http://www.isunshare.com/windows-8-password/how-to-reset-windows-8-password-without-disk.html#method-5 ), 
  but just in case you do n't want to waste your time with that software , do this :, 
  step 1 : get a usb/cd/dvd with a bootable os ( ubuntu is a good choice here ) . 
  step 2 : access the bootable os on your win8 desktop by choosing your media drive in the boot menu . 
  to do this , press f2/f10/f11 or whatever is mentioned in the bios screen . 
  step 3 : use any file explorer and look for your windows partition . 
  should be very easy to find !, 
  go into the \\ windows \\ system32 folder and search for `` utilman.exe '' . 
  rename it into `` utilman.backup '' . 
  step 4 : stay in the same folder and search for `` cmd.exe '' . 
  copy/paste it and name the copy into `` utilman.exe '' . 
  step 5 : restart and boot your pc into windows8 - just remove the media drive again . 
  step 6 : now , when you have to enter your password , press the `` ease-of-access '' button , which enables features like onscreen-keyboard and stuff . 
  instead of eoa-menu popping up , you should see the command prompt . 
  step 7 : enter the following : `` net user '' . 
  you should now see three columns with text underneath . 
  look for the line where the administrator or main user account is listed . 
  look for the username listed in column 3 of that line . 
  step 8 : enter `` net user x y '' where x is the username and y is your desired password . 
  step 9 : login with your new password . 
  step 10 : ??? 
  step 11 : profit !, 
  edit : [ for the ubuntu part , click here ] ( http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install ) . 
  you do n't have to install ubuntu on the machine . 
  just click on `` try ubuntu '' and head to step 3 . 
  livestock ( sheep/cattle/chickens ) can only be obtained by trading . 
  you need a trading post . 
  now every couple of seasons a merchant will arrive at your trading post and offer you his stuff . 
  sometimes he has livestock with him . 
  the best way to buy them is by paying with firewood , since it 's cheap and easy to make and you will have plenty of logs around you , 
  i think you got something wrong there . 
  i do n't remember the correct phrasing used , but robert wanted ned to rule until his children come of age , but ned wrote , that the children have to be of his seed . 
  ned would likely have some lannisters sent to the wall for their crimes and removed their political influence in the king 's decisions . 
  and when he would have been done establishing this , i think he would 've named gendry the king . 
  you are right !,
