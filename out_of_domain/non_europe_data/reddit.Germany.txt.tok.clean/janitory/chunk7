  i totally forgot about ned 's letter to stannis !, 
  yeah , thanks for refreshing my memory !, 
  seems like it, 
  killing a monster on his wedding . 
  what a man !, 
  i ca n't even put this #hype into words . 
  reminds me of achilles, 
  wow . 
  the pokemon attack `` firestorm '' looks like the chinese symbol for fire ? 
  consider my mind blown . 
  the trial, 
  [ asos ] ( #b `` before tyrion chose the trial by combat , people were gathering for days in a court , where several witnesses ( including shae and cersei ) spoke about all the `` atrocities '' tyrion comitted . 
  the `` judges '' were tywin , oberyn and i believe the high septon . '' ), 
  [ asos ] ( #b `` highborns can demand to be trialed by combat and this demand can not be denied . 
  tyrion did not demand the trial by combat in the beginning , because there was no one who would have fought for him and won against gregor . 
  he did n't know that jamie has already arrived and , i believe , on the last day of trial oberyn came to tyrion 's chamber and offered to be his champion . 
  tyrion took that opportunity then and you know what happened next : / '' ), 
  [ asos ] ( #b `` you could say that , yes . 
  but you ca n't demand a trial by combat and during the combat demand a normal trial . 
  if you demanded any sort of trial , that sort of trial can not be changed . '' ), 
  anyone have a sky sports ( german ) stream except stadium-live . com ? 
  for some reason the stadium-live stream never wants to work on my line without constant stuttering , freezes and failures . 
  are you serious ? 
  how did you find that ? 
  such quality , amazing !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  first loss against dortmund was the very first ( non-friendly ) match of pep . 
  bayern dominated the game against chelsea . 
  man city was stomped in the first game . 
  bayern also missed a penatly against arsenal . 
  nothing what you mentioned had to do anything with luck . 
  maybe the uefa supercup , i 'll give you that . 
  but boy , you have to be a fool and mentally challenged to believe that what you just wrote . 
  then have fun rewatching or reading on what actually happened in the game . 
  [ here are the stats . 
  ] ( http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/season=2013/matches/round=2000456/match=2012139/postmatch/quotes/ ), 
  i 've never seen two people get so many ( deserved ) downvotes so fast !, 
  that has to be a record or something . 
  it 's refreshing to see both clubs being in-form again . 
  even though i liked hyypi\u00e4 , laying him off seems to be very good for the team . 
  also julian brandt is astonishing - the talent is strong in this one . 
  it 's visibly sprouting out of every of his pores . 
  there are several good ones . 
  dieter nuhr and volker pispers , for instance , are very funny , but they are cabaret artists . 
  here is a list of comedians . 
  half of them are decent . 
  and i 'm not talking about comedians like mario bart . 
  he may fill stadiums with his `` comedy '' , but those people are the same who watch rtl , read bild , etc. 
  do you also have a german sky stream again ? 
  if so , could you tell me how you find them ? 
  i 'm not sure whether you are trolling or truly this stupid . 
  do you mean lilly ? 
  people downvote you , because you assume that the `` startup managing change '' is the reason some things are not showing up . 
  that 's wrong !, 
  if they do n't show up in the startup tab , they also would not show up in msconfig on windows 7 . 
  check your autostart folder located in the start menu ( folder ) and check the registry ( regedit -  hkey_local_machine \\ software \\ microsoft \\ windows \\ currentversion \\ run ) . 
  the last resort would be to have a look in the task scheduler . 
  / u/aftli posted a decent program to use . 
  if you do n't find it there , look at the process family of the program in question . 
  with that information you can see , if another program listed caused it to start . 
   yamato is benjen/daario/coldhands / jaqen h'gar / syrio forel/azor ahai, 
  ftfy, 
  he is joking about the ` lack of competence in jogi l\u00f6w ' . 
  he thinks that l\u00f6w is a bad coach , since some of his approaches and decisions are against this redditors and ( some ) other people 's personal opinions . 
  i also would have done things differently , but i 'm not some retard who thinks he would do better as a national coach , because i 'm not training with them multiple times every day with multiple assistances helping me . 
  blah , blah . 
  he has such a great team , but ca n't work with them . 
  stupid circlejerk . 
  if it were so easy to win an international cup , then we would n't make a big deal out of them . 
  so much ignorance ... 
  how dare you !, 
  how did you fix it ? 
  i 've got the same problem . 
  by your logic , valbuena should be taller , not smaller . 
  again horrible refereeing which caused the game to go another direction . 
  thank you . 
  i ca n't comprehend how people are so stupid thinking that touching the ball the slightest before hacking down your opponent , who is in reach for the ball , is not a foul . 
  funny how people instantly reach for their pitchforks . 
  this seems to be some malware . 
  which apps and services do you have installed ? 
  hm , care to explain ? 
  the only thing that comes to my mind would be `` mein fella '' as in `` my fella '' . 
  [ scroll down for an audial presentation ] ( http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/fehler ), 
  u wot m8 ?!, 
  no need to apologize , i 'm used to it . 
  i can understand how you see similarities between f\u00fchrer and fehler , but as long as you stress the ` e ' in the first syllable , no german would associate what you are saying with f\u00fchrer , 
  he is faster than mertesacker , but not as fast as boateng . 
  yes . 
  h\u00f6wedes - boateng - mertesacker - mustafi/lahm, 
  boateng is actually very fast , he has the pace needed for being a rightback and actually played that position for multiple years in the past ( at hsv 08/09 for instance ) . 
  this would be a huge upgrade for me . 
  still using my sparkle geforce 9600gt w / 512mb . 
  how much do you want for it ? 
  i 'm about to study informatics , but i can spare a few euros . 
  ace, 
  your dutch flag seems odd too,
