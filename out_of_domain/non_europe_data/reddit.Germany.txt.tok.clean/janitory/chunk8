  i 'm not trusting anything which only states rumors . 
  if there is no evidence , there is nothing worth looking at . 
  as if pep would n't want to hold onto kroos . 
  he is exactly the player for pep 's and bayern 's philosophy . 
  pep might dislike the negotiations , but he likes the player and his playstyle . 
  too late, 
   trust me , if pep really liked kroos and his playstyle bayern would have given him a better contract . 
  which they did . 
  they offered him a better contract , but he wanted even more . 
  he wants to be payed like lahm & schweinsteiger - players , who played for our club more than a decade . 
  never did our board give some aspiring stars the same money than our loyal veterans and even the presence of pep wo n't change this . 
  i 'm pretty sure that pep understands the reasoning behind the board 's position in this contract negotiation and sides with the board . 
  edit : classy , downvoting me for my opinion ... 
  maybe you are the one without a clue ... 
  where do you have your numbers , sportbild i guess . 
  there are no definite numbers about g\u00f6tze 's deal , but 7m/yr ( basic wage ) is a often used number . 
  maybe with sponsoring and boni his numbers climb up to 10m . 
   7m $ or 10m $ doesnt really matter at that point . 
  you said, 
  never did our board give some aspiring stars the same money than our loyal veterans, 
  which is fucking bullshit . 
  g\u00f6tze obviously got a contract which brings him more money then kroos ' old contract gave him . 
  so according to you kroos is an aspiring star and g\u00f6tze a loyal veteran . 
  g\u00f6tze got his contract before bayern wanted to renew kroos ' contract . 
  and thats makes no sense . 
  you are talking bullshit . 
  and i didnt downvote you because of your opinion, 
  classy , downvoting me for my opinion ... 
  i got no problem with other peoples opinions , but you are talking senseless shit . 
  what the fuck is your problem ? 
  first of all , i did not direct my edit to you ? 
  why do you feel targeted ? 
  and now back to topic : i do n't see kroos as a loyal veteran . 
  if you instead of being so passive-aggressive just took your time to read my post , you woul 've realized that i was refering to lahm and schweinsteiger , who i even mentioned just one paragraph before . 
  i did not say that a star player would n't get more money than other club members , i just said that he would n't be payed the same as the top on our payroll . 
  thanks for being such a nice redditor and so lovely to talk to !, 
  way to embrace a friendly discussion . 
  do n't twist my words . 
  i never stated kroos as a loyal veteran . 
  again , i refered to lahm and schweinsteiger . 
  and no , i do n't agree with you . 
  i do n't see that kroos iy more loyal to bayern than g\u00f6tze . 
  and i sarcasticly thanked you because of the way you write - degrading and antisocial - not because of any downvotes . 
  imho you really need to work on your social skills and how to communicate with people . 
  it 's sad that just because i 'm writing stuff you do n't agree with and you think of as `` rubbish '' , that you ca n't maintain a neutral ground and thus have to switch to your insulting choice of words . 
  playtime for bayern :, 
  kroos 8 years ( 1 on loan ) - 3 years regular playtime, 
  lahm 19 years ( 2 on loan ) - ~ 10 years regular playtime, 
  schweinsteiger 16 years - ~ 10 years regular playtime, 
  so , no , for me he is n't a veteran . 
  and if he moves to madrid purely because of money reasons , then i do n't see him as loyal to fcb . 
  g\u00f6tze 's loyality to bayern is an uncertainty for now , but i guess ( and hope ) , that he will stay here for many , many years . 
  loyality in this case is a very subjective matter and this is purely my opinion , but yes , again , i see g\u00f6tze as more loyal to bayern than kroos at the moment , even if that might sound `` rubbish '' to you and other people . 
  you both are actually agreeing with each other , but talk past each other . 
  why do we even bother . 
  let 's get some cake . 
  do n't read the comments under the article . 
  i think i lost at least a few hundred brain cells just reading the first 10 comments . 
  wow , fuck that . 
  messi received that because of his reputation , there were so many better players who deserve this award . 
  fuck that ... 
  and this , my friends , is a huge case of blue balls . 
  the background should feature subtle silhouettes of multiple daggers . 
  this is not a confirmation . 
  these stars are called `` meisterstern ( e ) '' . 
  the dfl have n't yet decided to introduce a 5th star . 
  yeah , but it 's still misleading and acts like a clickbait . 
  just because bild is bild , you do n't have to copy their editorial style , do you ? 
  i thought so and i 'm glad you shared it , but please do n't use titles like that anymore . 
  you play with my emotions . 
  i do n't want him to leave :(, 
  turn down 4 ( 20 ) wot m8 ? 
  i r8 8/8 m8, 
  [ here buddy . 
  all the confirmed transfers of this transfer window are listed there . 
  rummenigge did not state that he will leave . 
  no confirmation yet . 
  he said that they do n't want kroos to leave on a free agent next year , so they are negotiating with real madrid for a potential transfer fee . 
  he may not leave yet - even if it seems very unlikely at this point , but there is still no confirmation yet . 
  if this trend goes on , then arsenal will have more german national players than bayern in the next wc . 
  i do n't get it . 
  edit : and i also do n't get why you are being downvoted . 
  well , you ca n't be a national player for two nations at the same time . 
  so arsenal will always have more dfb players than the usmnt as long as atleast one dfb player is in arsenal .
