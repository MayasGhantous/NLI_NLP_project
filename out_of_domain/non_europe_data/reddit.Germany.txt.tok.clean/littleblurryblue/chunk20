  there is no mind in our town . 
  is there anything else you can recommend ? 
  mate i think that person gave you a really , really biased reply ( for example , implying germany would ` rule the uk ' ) . 
  that 's really not what the referendum is about . 
  i 've been following this debate for months and i completely agree that it 's hard to find a non biased opinion . 
  i think that the people who want out have valid points but i 'm 100 % for in . 
  if you 're interested , i can type up a short comprehensive list for you tomorrow ? 
  i 'm mainly saying this in relation to the first comment implying that op would be following in the footsteps of his grandparents in deciding britain 's faith . 
  i just do n't see any need to make this about germany vs the uk , ww2 style ( there 's much more important issues around and europe 's history is much more complex than that ) . 
  of course i agree that germany is a big influence on the eu , alongside france . 
  i respect that not everyone is going to agree on the policies these countries have : but we do n't need to be the same to get along , do we ? 
  all i wanted to point out is that your argument seemed very against the eu and especially against germany when there is no real need for that . 
  i definitely will . 
  i 've got some stuff about it typed on my computer and will post it here tomorrow . 
  yes you 're right , it was only one point ( one example that i feel showed you 're very on the ` out ' argument and already convinced of your opinion ) , did n't feel like typing out more . 
  i respect your view by the way , i can completely understand it . 
  but i do think that the op deserves to hear that there 's a different side as well . 
  as i mentioned above i 'll post some stuff tomorrow as i 'm in bed now . 
  i 'm back . 
  this will be rather long so i 've broken it up into separate comments . 
  i know that you said you 're too busy to spend a lot of time reading up about the eu - so i will include tl ; drs after each paragraph . 
  however , if you do have the time to read through all this , i hope you do . 
  i tried to keep it as easy to understand as possible , with plenty of examples . 
  ** what is the eu ? 
  after world war ii , many european countries sought to strengthen the peace and support each other . 
  in 1993 , the european union was officially formed . 
  the uk joined its predecessor , the european economic community , in 1973 . 
  the eu started out as an economic community , but has evolved into much more - it is a group of sovereign states that , together , strive for a single market , stability and prosperity in europe . 
  it is the largest economy in the world and is unique . 
  the eu 's motto is ** `` united in diversity '' ** - it recognises its members ' differences and lets their voices be heard . 
  how does the eu work politically ? 
  the eu is made up out of a few branches - there 's institutions like the bank , the court and the parliament . 
  the parliament is directly elected . 
  the parliament makes decisions about the budget , the laws and international agreements . 
  the meps are voted in directly , the number is based on the size of the country . 
  the uk is one of the countries with many seats in the parliament ( 73 seats ) . 
  to understand what the eu stands for , let 's look at the ** four freedoms ** . 
  these are important principles of the eu - the free movement of :, 
  ** goods ** : when you buy , sell or ship things within the eu , there 's not customs or tax . 
  for example , when you buy something on amazon and it ships from a different country , or when you order homemade stuff from etsy . 
  ** capital ** : being able to manage and move money in all of the eu . 
  ** persons ** : you can live , work , study and retire in any country in the eu , without a visa , and with equal treatment . 
  as uk residents , your medical care in eu countries is free . 
  other bonuses include that you can move for work and take your family with you , and that there 's no roaming charges for using your phone abroad !, 
  even if you do n't go on holiday yourself , it is easy to see how this is a great benefit to the uk in general . 
  for example , it also means that if your kids go to uni one day , they can go abroad for a term . 
  or , if you fall in love with someone from a different country , it 's not a hassle to move in with each other . 
  no wait times for visas or being cleared to work like in the us . 
  awesome !, 
  ** services ** : as already said above , you have the right to work in any eu country - with the same rights as their citizens . 
  trades and cash-in hand jobs benefit from this . 
  this might not apply to everyone , either , but it 's huge for self-employed people and businesses . 
  ** tl : dr ** : the eu is a collective of states that started out striving for peace , democracy and a single market . 
  nowadays , it means that all people in the eu enjoy the same rights in every country . 
  ok , so now we have figured out what the eu wants . 
  single market , people having the freedom to go where they want . 
  it sounds pretty good - but is it perfect ? 
  no , it is most definitely not . 
  the world 's seen some really messed up stuff in the last few years - war , financial crashes , the rise of donald trump . 
  much like countries themselves , the eu has n't managed to deal with everything perfectly . 
  but does it have to be perfect ? 
  i do n't think there is a viable alternative to staying in . 
  i believe that the arguments for `` out '' are largely rooted in misinformation , in bigotry , fear or in doubt of things that are not affected by the eu . 
  instead of explaining more about the eu , let 's cycle through some common misconceptions !, 
  ** main points **, 
  ** `` it 's expensive to be in the eu '' . 
  the uk has benefited from a rebate ( ` abatement ' ) on its eu budget contributions since 1985 , so has successfully managed to negotiate a change to its contributions before . 
  the contributions by the uk ( # 9.4 bn 2016 - source obn ) sound like a lot - but you also have realise that this number sounds like a lot because countries spend a shit lot of money in general , more than people like us can fathom . 
  public spending for 2016 is estimated at # 759.5 bn , # 45bn alone of which goes to defense . 
  the eu spending is a drop in the ocean , especially since the eu also brings many benefits . 
  some of them can not be measured in money , others can . 
  last year , the uk received # 4.5 bn back directly from the eu , another # 1bn in research grants , and then there is important relations , cultural and educational benefits that ca n't really be put into money . 
  for example , uk trade with the eu is worth 400 # bn a year . 
  nigel farage likes to claim that the eu costs # 55m a day - it 's probably closer to # 25m a day . 
  the royal family allegedly costs 56p per day per taxpayer ; the eu would cost 39p per person . 
  it is down to subjective opinion if you find this kind of spend unnecessary . 
  ** tldr ** : the eu does n't cost as much as you might think - plus , the uk gets a lot of money and benefits back from the eu . 
  ** `` eu laws are sooo imposing '' . 
  ** tldr ** : many eu laws actually benefit the uk ( for example , worker protection , single market laws that keep energy prices low ) . 
  of course some people are not going to agree with these laws - but many are fair . 
  for example , employers might be unhappy about some laws ( minimum wage regulations , holidays , shorter work hours ) . 
  ** `` we have nothing in common with the continent '' **, 
  it 's a bit rude to group all countries in the eu together like that . 
  for example , german history is very unlike from greek history . 
  every single country within the eu is unlike the other . 
  at the same time , europe does have a shared history ( like germany attacking everyone , twice !, 
  ) , and , often , very similar cultural values ( we all love chips/fries ) !, 
  the eu 's motto is `` united in diversity '' because it recognises this . 
  ** tldr ** : nobody wants to make the uk like other countries in europe , because there is no typical european country . 
  we can all be together - but not the same . 
  ** `` my ancestors did n't fight for this country for it to be ruled by european countries '' **, 
  the uk is a dualist state - no international or eu laws are actually valid unless the government incorporates them into the national law . 
  that means that the uk does not have an obligation to act out all of the laws and treaties the eu passes . 
  ( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmeuleg/633/63304.htm ), 
  it 's worth noting that the uk has managed to get exceptions for a number of eu decisions - it opted out of the euro , opted out of schengen , and negotiated the expenses they pay multiple times . 
  and , in any case , the eu is very much a democratic organisation , with an elected parliament . 
  ( it 's not their fault that uk citizens decided to vote ukip in it ) . 
  ** tldr ** : the uk is not ruled by the eu - the parliament has to approve laws from europe !, 
  there 's actually a ton of examples of laws that the uk did n't want - and therefore did n't implement . 
  this shows that it 's possible for the uk to remain in control .
