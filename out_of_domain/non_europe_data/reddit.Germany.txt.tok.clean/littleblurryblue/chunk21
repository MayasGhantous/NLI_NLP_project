  ** immigration **, 
  ** `` we can only control immigration by leaving the eu '' **, 
  the uk and ireland are the only countries outside of the schengen agreement . 
  this is the eu law that had every other country abandon continental borders . 
  as an island , the uk had valid reasons to keep control of its borders . 
  however , this does mean that border control can not be used as an argument in the discussion about leaving the eu , as the uk is very much in control of their own borders . 
  the eu expects the uk to take in immigration - but reasons for and against that pretty in depth , and not worth getting into here . 
  ** `` the immigrants are benefit tourists from the eu '' **, 
  a really large chunk of immigrants ( 201k ) in 2015 were non-eu citizens . 
  the eu does not have any impact on whether the uk lets those people in . 
  the eu does allow eu citizens to travel to the uk without a visa : 180k came in 2015 . 
  101k of those had a secured job . 
  if you are protesting syrians , pakistanis and africans being let into the country , please direct your criticism to your nearest mp , but not the eu ( who is taking the brunt of the immigration in europe , anyway : germany has taken in more than 1mil asylum seekers . 
  turkey is n't even in the eu and hosts more than 2.5 mil asylum seekers ) . 
  ** `` immigrants are bad for the uk '' **, 
  the office for budget responsibility says that immigrants are important for paying taxes and that the industry needs them . 
  there are deficits in the job market , especially in really low-paying jobs . 
  the unemployment rate of british citizens is a really valid point - but it ca n't be blamed on the eu . 
  many people just use this argument to mask their fear of people who are different - because of their skin colour , religion or ethnicity . 
  ** tldr ** : immigration is a really heated topic that is used by lots of people to manipulate them into voting against the government . 
  also , fear and misinformation is a huge part of this debate . 
  in short , the eu actually does n't force the uk to let in immigrants - and eu migrants do not leave the uk in a negative , they give money back in taxes . 
  ** leaving the eu - and then what ? 
  ** `` as an alternative to the eu , we could become like norway , or switzerland ! '' **, 
  norway , not in the eu but in the eea ( european economic area ) still has to contribute to the eu budget - since they want to trade with the eu . 
  switzerland also had to form certain bilateral agreements - it 's not entirely certain what terms the uk would be able to negotiate . 
  ** `` but we would get good terms because the eu needs us ! '' **, 
  the eu , taken as a whole , is the uk 's major trading partner , accounting for 45 % of exports and 53 % of imports of goods and services in 2014 . 
  ( the house of commons , in brief : uk-eu economic relations ) . 
  open europe estimates that britain would pay 94 % of what it pays now - but it would not get a say in anything . 
  ** `` the eu is not where the most gdp growth is occurring . '' **, 
  that 's correct . 
  countries like brazil , china , india and russia are gaining economic power . 
  but being outside of the eu is not going to magically transform the uk into an asian superpower . 
  ** tldr ** : countries outside of the eu still trade with the eu and have to pay according fees to the eu . 
  the eu is britain 's most important trade partner , and would remain this if the uk was out . 
  that would mean that the uk would continue to pay fees ( albeit a few percent less ) : but it would lose any say in the regulations . 
  at the moment , the uk is able to vote on eu laws . 
  also , it is not clear if the uk would financially benefit from leaving or not . 
  ** conclusion ** :, 
  there is no definitive study of the economic impact of the uk 's eu membership or the costs and benefits of withdrawal . 
  nobody wants to convince you that the eu is perfect . 
  because it most certainly is not . 
  however , the alternative does n't really have any benefits - and while britain still is in the eu , there 's lots of room for negotiation and change !, 
  ** why should you vote ** ? 
  i know you said you do n't care enough , or know enough , or think you 're not affected . 
  with that attitude , you 're forgetting that your decision not to vote might seriously affect somebody else 's life . 
  it only takes a few minutes to read up on this stuff and make a decision . 
  it 's your responsibility to make a decision - not just a random decision , but one with reasons . 
  and if not for the sake of the relationship of the eu and the uk , consider to care as a decent human being : i 'm assuming you want the best for yourself and others and do n't have an agenda . 
  the people who scream `` out '' are generally louder than the people who want to stay in , because ( in my opinion , anyway ) a lot of the arguments for `` out '' are presented to the public on facebook , twitter , crap newspapers , reddit etc. 
  in a way that is nothing short of fear mongering . 
  there is always something to complain about , and it is easy to use the eu ( and immigrants ) as a scrape goat . 
  i am pleading to you : do not fall into that trap . 
  you do not need to be super into politics to realise that a lot of that scary stuff is trying to pull you into a certain way of thinking . 
  ** tldr ** : it 's a fallacy to believe that nothing will change if you do n't vote . 
  the `` out '' side is driven by a lot of angry , bigoted people and far louder than the in voice . 
  you would do your country a pretty big favour by doing what many wo n't : sit down and listen to the in side . 
  yes , it seems a bit daunting to care about all this stuff . 
  but i hope you 're going to vote . 
  glad you like it . 
  spent probably too much time writing it up . 
  agree - god , there 's so much extra info that deserves too be added . 
  its a very complex issue . 
  i 'm from germany and go to uni in the uk . 
  the unis can be world class , obviously ( oxbridge , cambridge etc ) but the general education on the school can be super mixed . 
  depending on your post code and your parents income you might not have a very good school to go to . 
  then there 's the fact that all of the school education is geared towards exams - kids study for the exam at the end of the year and forget all of it after . 
  after kids are 15 , they 're free to decide what level of education to pursue and i have to say that even a levels ( the highest level ) are vastly , vastly different from germany 's education . 
  i am sometimes shocked at the general knowledge of my peers - smart people , just seems like the system failed them . 
  on the other hand , i also have friends that went to high school in the us and have met people from there - would n't say that the us system in a direct comparison seems much better . 
  in a comparison to other eu countries , however , the uk does have a reputation of having a dodgy schooling system . 
  reading your comments like this makes me really feel for you . 
  i think it 's partly normal to feel that way * sometimes * - but it seems like you are genuinely feeling like you 're not fulfilled , even though you say yourself you 've got a life that 's filled with the stuff that makes other people happy ( school , job , partner ) . 
  some perspective : it took me a while to figure out what kind of stuff makes me happy . 
  i think it takes a while to get there . 
  it 's also tricky to figure out whether this feeling is due to your own personal happiness or if it 's the relationship . 
  i will say one thing though : i would n't stay in a relationship that made me feel this way . 
  i know you said you do n't want to break up because you 've got similar personalities and you 're comfortable - but is that seriously enough for you ? 
  is liking him enough not to break up ? 
  if you have any doubts whatsoever , then consider taking a break and seeing if you 're better as friends . 
  hell , take half a term to study abroad . 
  spend the next holidays apart . 
  in this post , a lot of people have given great advice about spending less time together and finding friends . 
  to a degree , it think that applies : happiness comes largely from within yourself , and may come from things you do n't know yet . 
  it also gives you more perspective on your relationship . 
  however - as humans , we do tend to put up with a lot of stuff that really is n't great for us , like college relationships ( saying this as someone who 's been with their partner since high-school ) . 
  in your post , you do n't talk about how you 're ridiculously in love with him , how much passion you once had , how he 's your best friend . 
  i do n't think idolising your partner is necessary , but it 's concerning that you are bored of each other imo ( it sounds like that to me , sorry if i 'm wrong ) . 
  if what you say is true and you only see each other for dinner and weekends , that 's actually not that much time . 
  i see my partner every day ( live together ) , and i would never , ever get sick of her . 
  i can not imagine being bored around her . 
  in short : sometimes it 's okay not to feel fulfilled , if you 're still figuring things out . 
  but to be honest , your relationship does n't sound all that fulfilling . 
  it 's up to you to decide what you really want and need and deserve in life , including your relationship . 
  in my experience with eastern european accents , they 're more likely to leave articles out ( ` pass me remote ' ) instead of randomly adding them . 
  i 'm german and i know that when learning english , adding ` the ' was something me/my peers did because german loveeees articles . 
  with more context , i can definitely understand someone being confused ( when you live abroad it gets a bit weird sometimes when you sleepily try to remember what to say ) . 
  i 'm just confused how french got brought into the mix . 
  what a quirky guy/gal !,
