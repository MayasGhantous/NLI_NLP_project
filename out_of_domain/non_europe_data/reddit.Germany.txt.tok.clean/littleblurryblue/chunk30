  your dog is adorable and super fun to draw . 
  [ quick sketch !, 
  also [ my instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  quite [ sketchy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0thkdgu.jpg ) , hope you enjoy !, 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  thanks !, 
  yay that 's nice to hear from a fellow artist , thank you !, 
  [ do you think the pumpkin said something mean ? 
  great pic !!, 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't draw kids that often , so i 'm glad it came out so convincing \u263a, 
  omg , so much great artwork in this thread !!, 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  i went [ a bit crazy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ffncy1.jpg ) with it . 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  glad you liked it , they 're good reference pictures !, 
  i actually only just realised there 's more than one . . silly me, 
  i use rgd to play around with textures and new brushes , sometimes the experiments work , sometimes they do n't !, 
  i do n't know if these kinds of comments are allowed but i 'd also like to add that imo it takes away from the spirit of rgd a bit when people explicitly state they 're essentially looking for a free commission . 
  at least it does n't motivate me ( as an artist ) to have a go at a picture . 
  i 'm here for fun , in an ideal world all the submissions and submitters would be here without expectations because that 's where creative magic happens . 
  just my 2 cents to maybe explain to op why people are n't taken on the picture , and i hope they find someone who will work out an arrangement !, 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  thank you so much for saying that , have n't seen this discussed much around here but i really feel this . 
  it 's a huge moral conflict for me , i do not advocate giving away art for free . 
  at the same time , i admit that i draw in my free time anyway and need references . 
  and i thought it 'd be nice to make someone smile by sketching them . 
  but i do n't like feeling like i 'm being taken advantage of !, 
  there 's too many people out there who do not value art as a profession . 
  sometimes i think this subreddit is n't helping : /, 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  great work !, 
  i could n't resist , such a cool pose . 
  the [ quickest sketch ] ( http://imgur.com/jsnvr4j.jpg ) ever !, 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  also [ my instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
   lighting in the picture will be automatically adjusted as per the day of the week, 
  that gives me an idea for another improvement : snapchat filters will be assigned to days across the week ( to ensure more submitters will post such unique looking images ) . 
  that will work really nicely with your rule !, 
  i love this so much !, 
  ( that caption is gold too ) . 
  here 's my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  i made a [ sketch ] ( http://imgur.com/gwdbf2v.jpg ) for you because this is adorable , great expressions . 
  my [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  you wan na know what 's funny ? 
  weeks ago i was looking for references to draw betty and veronica in those outfits . 
  i spent ages looking at low quality screengrabs to get them right and now here you come with those hi res photos !, 
  i zoomed in really far and [ i think i found a trace ... ] ( http://imgur.com/qv1dqvh ), 
  no problem . 
  it 's sweet that you have such a great relationship with your niece !, 
  just joining to say how cool this is , you did a great job framing it differently while still keeping the likeness . 
  i took some [ creative liberties ] ( http://imgur.com/kplfpkg.jpg ) with the background .

  love how honest the title is .

  [ something a little different ] ( http://imgur.com/6vw1nqa.jpg ), 
  [ insta ] ( https://www.instagram.com/lesleyimgart/ ), 
  thank you . 
  one of the things i believe in firmly is that less is more and the best way to improve an illustration is often to simplify it !, 
  i do n't know your dogs but they all look like fun personalities !!,
