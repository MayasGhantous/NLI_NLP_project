  [ try again ? 
  ahh thank you !, 
  that 's awesome to hear , 
  i love this sub a lot , it has given me so much, 
  i think u/autobottesla is pretty much bang on with their reasoning , so just to add my $ 0.2 , i also do n't think the rule needs any changing . 
  laws against pictures of naked children exist primarily to protect children who can not make decisions for themselves . 
  i 'd argue they 're the main thing that prevents the further sexualisation of children !, 
  sexualisation is about removing individuality , about rendering bodies into objects , about abolishing consent . 
  ( edit : i guess you could say that art can technically be seen as being a medium that objectifies any person that becomes a subject , but maybe that 's a bit too meta ... ), 
  but on to another topic - the april theme !, 
  i am super excited for that . 
  i think i submitted a gif as a response once and am excited about having a go again . 
  also up for helping anyone with gifs in photoshop if needed !,

  thank you / u/waffleandbear , 
  that 's the character katherine langford plays on 13 reasons why , so at least that part would make sense . 
  auschwitz is n't even in modern day germany, 
  haha exact same boat here . 
  even went into a microsoft store because i wanted to try out the new surface pro only to be informed that the pen is n't available yet . 
  that 's like the biggest reason to even consider buying one to me !, 
  people arguing about whether you used the right description and i just wanted to say great shot !, 
  really love this picture and how it tells a story . 
  just got my g4 today ( unlocked , 6.0 ) , am loving it except for this one thing . 
  i 'd grown accustomed to stock android emojis ( had a sony phone previously ) and lg 's emojis are just not doing it for me at all . 
  this has bothered me to the point of googling it for the last few hours , no luck so far . 
  i 've searched in this subreddit and have not found an answer , either . 
  do any of you guys know how i can change them ? 
  i 've tried installing different keyboards and while they may make it look like they 've changed the emojis , once i type them ( e.g. 
  on snapchat ) they turn into the lg ones again !, 
  rooting probably kills warranty ( i am not too sure ) , is there anything else i can do to save myself from this hell ? 
  hey , i really hope that someone has the time to read this , i would appreciate any advice so much . 
  i 'm in my last 2 weeks of university , with a lot of work to do , and my nerves are really worn down by dealing with this on top . 
  this is something i 've been caught up in for months , so it 's a bit lengthy . 
  enjoy . 
  my partner and i moved into a flat ( rented through an agency ) last december . 
  a note about the property : it is a flat , in a street with houses . 
  the flats have a different postcode from the houses , although the first line of address will appear similar ( same street ) . 
  upon arrival , found a letter from eon `` hi , we 're you 're supplier ! '' . 
  the letter used the post code that is not ours . 
  i called , gave my address details - the new and old postcode , to be safe - was told that the letter was a mistake as they could not find either address on their system . 
  i told them i did not want to be supplied by them anyway . 
  i made an account with scottish power ( including a direct debit ) . 
  i gave them my correct address , but also let them know that there was a second postcode that was mistakenly being used . 
  paid ca . 
  45 # a month for two months or so . 
  at the end of march ( when the bill does not go out of my account ) , i log into the account online , to see that it was closed . 
  okay ... 
  i call and am told that there is nothing they can do . 
  then , a bill from eon arrives , billing us 215 # from december - march . 
  i call and try to find out what is going on . 
  they insist that they have always supplied my property . 
  at this point , i 'm confused because i 've been paying scottish power . 
  it all unravels when i keep bothering the letting agency to help me :,
