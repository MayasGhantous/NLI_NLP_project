i 'd have no regrets either . 
  read something you want to learn about , dunno if this has scientific grounding ( ? 
  ) , but it works for me because i both fall asleep easier and remember the thing more vividly !, 
  `` i * think * we got away with the monkey nuts ... '',

  he grew up about 9 miles away from where i live !, 
  absolutely odd place , the s/w of england . 
  * ahem * i said grew up , i did n't say born at all .

  wednesday !, 
  - seriously , the germans got it nailed with ` mittwoch ' ( translated literally , mid-week ), 
  wensday saves so much time , or we could just say midweek as well - after all more people refer to saturday and sunday as just ` weekend ' , it seems to me anyway . 
  i currently work at a funeral directors ( ha !, 
  creepy enough already ) , but we 've had deceased people involuntarily spasm etc while handling them for preparation . 
  it 's always hilarious when somebody new starts , completely unaware of the sounds , movements and bodily actions ( yeah - ** that ** ) a deceased person can make and do . 
  texted me after i 'd had a fantastic weekend away with my family , turned up the next day to exchange stuff we 'd given each other . 
  gets all up in my grill everytime i deny her a fucking friend request . 
  petty-ass cunt . 
  mister freezes !, 
  ` arkansas revisited ' by brian jonestown massacre and ` home ' by edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros . 
  i hate how the lyrical structure and opening lines of ` home ' sounds like a carbon copy of ` arkansas revisited ' , given that it was released 8 years after ` revisited ' ... and that both bands are geographically close . 
  they were at the very beginning of the empire , i.e. 
  the 501st being the elite core of jango clone troopers who killed many of the jedi , but not long after ( cue a brief segue to avoid going into too much detail ) , the empire began hiring human men as stormtroopers because of difficulties with cloning ( i 'm not quite sure why ) . 
  this is evident in their lack of firearms training , accuracy , and general ` not as good as clone troopers ' personae . 
  therefore almost all if not every single original trilogy stormtrooper is a human man and not a clone , 
  only the strong survive . 
  crush the weak crayons . 
  clearly , nobody spoke of skukerman 's crimes ... 
  *** the eyes say it all ***, 
  if you had krieger 's technology at your disposal right now , what hypothetical creation could we expect to see sometime soon ? 
  too true , a simple ` my condolences ' or ` sorry for your loss ' with a firm handshake/hug/shoulder touch ( depending on how well you know them ) is all that needs to be done . 
  and do n't stick around for too long unless you 're family !, 
  never make it about yourself . 
  but it makes some mean chord shapes !, 
  definitely the stronger ( comparatively ) hand when i play guitar . 
  leave the cronut . 
  bring the donoli . 
  little wing - hendrix . 
  do n't really feel up to an explanation . 
  tl ; dr i had to remove and put a dead person 's brain back in their skull . 
  employee at funeral home/coroner 's office here . 
  seeing dead people is all well and good considering they 're often very very old and in one piece and ( usually ) not that messy . 
  but we 've had our unfortunate fair share of young deceased persons both on pick-ups and in the home . 
  unstitching a botched autopsy 'd head to put the skull cap back the right way around , for the person 's brain to fall out and land on our tray . 
  picked it up and placed it back on , obligatory pat of the brain , and cleaned up the deceased . 
  there 's plenty more weird shit i 've seen , some of which pales in comparison with the other stories on this thread , but that was the first time i ever saw inside a pretty-much intact human skull , and it will forever stick with me . 
  edit : misspelled a word, 
  it takes two - marvin gaye/kim weston . 
  just the lyrics and the strings , always gives me an upbeat feeling on rainy days - totally do n't dance to this though ... ^ totally ^ do n't ... 
  cup my balls , because zips and carelessness is awful, 
  a girl at our secondary school bore this atrocity , basically it 's a perfume/afterhshave brand name ; bleurgh . 
  not so much a food , but i wish we had wendy 's in the uk . 
  had a bacon ( ca n't remember the proper name ? ), 
  burger in ny two years ago ; it might not be anything spectacular compared to the fantastic gourmet buggery we have in england , but i fell in love with it straight away . 
  peach slices . 
  getting to give schoolchildren detentions willy nilly - and i 'm only just about finishing college . 
  die apokalyptischen reiter ; r + has already been mentioned , and are another favourtie german band , but dar are both hilarious and melodic, 
  [ badfinger - flying ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=89x1xjsxzi0 ) most people know baby blue from breaking bad , but this a side of the 7 '' single baby blue was on is absolutely perfect . 
  horribly fatalist at its core , but beautiful at the same time, 
  read a chapter of whatever 's on the go , then have a small glass of water and lights out, 
  hell no , it 's a waste of batteries and way too irritating,

  all spiders ' legs have a coating of may fine hairs on each . 
  imagine waxing that !, 
  sadly i peaked too soon before that . 
  i personally really liked it - my mates compared it way too much to the broderick one , but c'mon let 's be honest godzilla will always be godzilla , and how can anyone be disappointed at that ? 
  also the mutos were pretty fucking awesome , i 'd recommend you watch it !, 
  more of an audible `` oh fuck my bad '' than a heartfelt apology - i 'm a cunt . 
  thanks , stresemann . 
  just to add to this , here are the [ statistics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#statistics_since_1900 ) of germany 's population changes since 1900 . 
  anytime , enjoy !, 
  it was in hindsight yes , but i 'm on omeprazole currently and have had an endoscopy check for it - sadly this is the first time in 4 years where i 've had any form of reaction ( although the puke was n't the usual cyanide-esque foam type ), 
  other wives hate her !, 
  seems the most likely , flammable source would have been harder to completely cover them ( i 'm guessing ? ), 
  if this was the work of the deceased - hence the almost intact legs . 
  might i ask where this extract is from ? 
  wonderful , thank you very much !, 
  we can rebuild him !, 
  such a brilliant show, 
  may i ask what purpose the two men laying down would serve ( in the last two planes ) ? 
  ahhh , i see now !, 
  thank you for informing , 
  damn , that 's pretty freaky . 
  ` die eier von satan ' by tool is pretty hilarious in general - as a semi-fluent german speaker i fine the line ` say the magic words , zimzalabimzamdazalladozalladimba ' absolutely brilliant , whereas my non-german speaking friends think it 's some peculiar twisted foreign phrase . 
  apocalypse now , just for the opening scene . 
  it 's been re-run a few times in small london cinemas , but i 've never made it up in time . 
  hitler - the guy would go sleep at 2am , wake up around midday , do shit he enjoyed while other leading nazis did all the work , and bore people to death about the shit he 'd done that day which had interested him . 
  the perfect bohemian gamer life !, 
  exactly that , the opening lines are pretty much ` take a hundred grams of sugar and some eggs , then set the oven to 200 ' - along those lines .
