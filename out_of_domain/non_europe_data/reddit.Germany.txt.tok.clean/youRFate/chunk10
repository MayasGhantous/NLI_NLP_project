  but if it 's a decal then i think you are right . 
  what is that ? 
  does it go into your drain ? 
  we do n't have those things in europe i think . 
  sure , usually the guest adds the parmesan to his gusto . 
  nope , rag\u00f9 alla bolognese with beef , add some basil right as it 's done . 
  then grind a ton of aged parmigiano reggiano over it . 
  i literally thumbs-up 'd at my screen after reading this :d, 
  no , i use a 16gb class 4 micro sdhc by sandisk , no problems . 
  he just demonstrated that they work . 
  he will set them back up surely . 
  holy shit all that editing was annoying to watch ... 
  oo , that is the most normal thing in world i guess ... 
  maybe it 's a european thing . 
  i think all my neighbors have one . 
  we have a big underground one . 
  that van is the packaging . 
  wow , that intern had one hell of a job ... 
  the colors have been changed . 
  you can see that at the edged of the water . 
  the green mossy water is purple there . 
  also the substitution of green with purple has turned the murky water teal . 
  this image has been reposted here numerous times and every time has been identified as fake . 
  probably not the most quiet place on earth ... 
  exactly my first thought . 
  it is n't . 
  that 's why i used the improvised not equal sign . 
  i somehow ca n't activate the widget on my htc sensation xe ... 
  no illegal , but frowned upon , because if more people do it / r/pics temporarily turns into / r/lens . 
  i got a defense 2 chest and a key . 
  the chest contained a strange belt for axe . 
  how does one see this ? 
  from the uniform color distribution ? 
  here you go : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zfroqsgw_a, 
  i have no idea . 
  this is the first video that turned up when i searched on google ... 
  reopst, 
  reposting a comment from the video thread as a pic ? 
  shame on you . 
  real prosciutto is cut so thin it nearly melts on your tongue ... 
  when will it land ? 
  bad lighting, 
  they save on insulation and probably assembly time , since wire would require to be cut and the ends need to be deinsulated . 
  there are no gw2 discs . 
  every version you can buy only comes with a key , and code . 
  oh , did n't know that . 
  last time i checked they said no discs . 
  it also is n't mentioned on the overview of the ce on the arenanet page . 
  well , we 'll see , i prepurchased the ce . 
  also you do n't have to clean the magnet afterwards . 
  i actually snowboarded around those mountains , several times . 
  the tour is called [ sella ronda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sella_ronda ) . 
  i just recently discovered that my then ~ 7 year old logitech g15 had foil on the logo and the capslock etc lights ... mfw, 
  some wind and those metal rods scratch your paint job ... 
  just imagine some generic overly excited image macro , similar to [ this cat ] ( http://i.minus.com/i6yimct0rq1ei.jpg ) , only more human . 
  i believe she was in that lake where jellyfish do n't have stingers ... 
  that looks like a plastic cup & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i love total commander for that . 
  imho it 's much easier using the backtrack distribution and the aircrack-ng toolsuite ... 
  arp poisioning . 
  what i meant is that it is way easier to setup with backtrack since it comes with all the tools preinstalled and with modified wifi drivers . 
  there is a huge ski/snowboard resort : http://www.dolomitisuperski.com/ we stayed in campitello di fassa . 
  its super fun to snowboard there , and if you stay on the slopes your are perfectly safe . 
  i used pretty much these skills : http://gw2skills.net/editor/en/?fqeqnarywjqat7lbgb87jajfpf90jvhx8iffpma;tsaa2cooey8k4j7tunkptazqw2da, 
  corrosive cloude + enfeebling blood on a group of enemies . 
  then signet of spite on a central foe , followed by epidemic and feast of corruption . 
  after that pretty much any enemy has a ton of debuffs and takes a load of condition damage . 
  this has been posted a dozen times and has been confirmed fake . 
  telephone stuff is low voltage , that should not cause any problems . 
  it 's nuremberg ( engl . 
  / frz . ), 
  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974083653/ add me,

  i looks like he would easily be able to swing across that wall on the left like that ... 
  you still do n't own an altium license just because you have a machine that it is installed on ... 
  that is true for cars , but you did not purchase a license for the software installed on the pc . 
  thy are not allowed to sell the license and it is only applicable to the person that purchased it from altium . 
  the company you got the pc from did not own altium , they only have a license for it . 
  they can not sell you that license . 
  except if you go further , like for instance beyerdynamic, 
  i did the same thing , because the only online ce retailer for germany , 4u2play , totally fucked up the ce prepurchase . 
  they basically had them all sold already some weeks prior and it pretty much went straight from `` will be available soon '' to `` sold out '' on the prepurchase day . 
  my ce has just been dispatched and will hopefully arrive before the weekend . 
  i ordered my ce to germany and they delivered the codes via dhl . 
  from what i have read online i gathered that i got my code faster in germany than you guys got yours in gb . 
  i just got my email , but the tracking link only yielded `` your search did not find any matching tracking . 
  please refine your search criteria . '' . 
  does the tracking work for you guys ? 
  if we wait 3-4 more days this whole subreddit will be spammed with unboxing videos and images . 
  i do n't know of a really bad courier here in germany . 
  best one i know is fedex , i got a parcel from fort worth , texas to here in 36 hours and the delivery was free ( or rather payed for by texas instruments ) . 
  i do n't get what 's wrong either ... for about 10-15 ppl . 
  that would be the appropriate amount of pizza, 
  they exist in europe for a long time now . 
  they are called berner w\u00fcrstel and are usually also filled with chese . 
  [ german wiki link since no other language is available . 
  ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/berner-w%c3%bcrstel ), 
  same, 
  raw meaning iron ore or processed steele ? 
  any scientific quotations on `` for the skin of a newborn , this is essentially the same as pouring rubbing alcohol on an open wound . '' ?
