  also there is the faint possibility , that the numbers might change between calls to yaourt . 
  yes , but i have my terminal set up to keep only like 1000 lines of history . 
  with each of those 1000 suggestions having 2 lines that exceeds the history . 
  a boat is a hole in the water into which you pour money . 
  i am fully aware that i could do that , the post is more about the fact that this problem should n't exist in the first place . 
  i 've looked at the documentation and did n't find a way to limit that . 
  i then asked here , because maybe there is a way that i 'm just not aware of . 
  since nobody has presented a solution i might suggest this elsewhere now . 
  but maybe the number of output lines should be limited . 
  ah , that is perfect , thanks . 
  i tried it but it did n't work at first becaust i had n't set $ pager . 
  many langauges have a form of formal address . 
  for example in german you have * du * and * sie * , which are both translated to the english * you * . 
  they are in no way archaic and are used in normal every day speech . 
  you would never address a grown up stranger with * du * . 
  at the same time the word * sie * is also the german form of * she * and * they * . 
  nah , i 'll just move tmp to the filesystem , without any tmpfs . 
  then it wo n't depend on ram anymore . 
  also , the rpi has 1gb of ram , with 1gb of swap that does make 2gb . 
  wtf that volume, 
  build has been running for about 1.5 hours now , going fine so far . 
  memory usage never exceeds about 800 meg , i have 1 gb and 1 gb of swap . 
  i removed the tmpfs , so / tmp now sits on the filesystem . 
  as a representative of the church of emacs i feel offended . 
  yes , i always put my kindle on the table and read when i eat out alone . 
  to add a little more juice you could add a few cherry tomatoes roasted in olive oil . 
  have you driven a ` regular ' bmw yet ? 
  love the image . 
  hehe, 
  aww yes . 
  wagon life . 
  they actually used a 40mm l70 bofos dp gun . 
  see the [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mantilla-class_patrol_vessel ) about it . 
  [ cnn article ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/15/americas/argentina-chinese-fishing-vessel/index.html ) . 
  the 28 other crew members were apparently rescued by another chinese boat that was also close by . 
  i have n't played in a long time , last time was when the golden private jet came out . 
  can you now actually lower cars to the point where they are properly slammed without shooting wheels ? 
  afaik russia made it a requirement for import that smartphones that feature gps also need to feature glonass or be banned . 
  i guess they do n't really sell any serious volume of wine , and the provider of those weird racks might even pay the store to have their rack up and not sell any other wine . 
  not an x5 , only x1 and x3 . 
  and i think my 3 series handles even better . 
  are you sure they 're not tank track wheels ? 
  also usually they 're not in a hurry at night . 
  a player in my pathfinder group has 2 about 50mm size d20 . 
  if they polished it it would be nice . 
  not usually , no . 
  i do n't know where this video was taken , i guess somewhere in east-germany , where nobody lives anymore . 
  as a german i was angry at him for not staying in the fucking right lane when it was empty . 
  i use it the same way , but i 'd still recommend you update it , because the new [ typesetting engine and bookerly font ] ( http://www.amazon.com/b?node=11624010011 ) are beautiful . 
  you can download the updates from amazon and apply them via usb cable if you want . 
  the updates can be found [ here ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_bc_nav?ie=utf8&amp;nodeid=200529680 ) . 
  there is an amazing software suit called [ callibre ] ( https://calibre-ebook.com/ ) . 
  it 's free and works on windows , mac and * nix systems . 
  it can convert all ebook types for use with kindle and generally works beautifully . 
  if he ca n't safely drive that speed in the lane he 's supposed to be in he has to drive slower . 
  he adjusted the color levels , not the angle . 
  each of the five engines of the main stage had it 's own fuel pump . 
  each of those fuel pumps has 55000 bhp . 
  apparently lots of cruise ships stop there to take on passengers and supplies , according to wikipedia at least . 
  i see they interviewed patrick rothfuss . 
  most likely : owner trained him to do this by hiding treats under cups . 
  he 's now looking for those . 
  you know , there are more trees on earth than there are stars in the universe . 
  that is actually good , it does not talk about religion at all . 
  it 's better than the us one i think .

  i liked it . 
  we went late evening / night , and the lights of the city below you look nice . 
  i was there sometime arround 2004 i think . 
  i was kinda impressed by it . 
  lol , death valey . 
  we thought that drive was going to be somewhat adventurous , loaded up on water and gas etc. 
  then we drive in , after a while what doe we pass ? 
  a fucking 18 hole golf resort . 
  played minecraft when it was still a free development preview on the tigsource forums sometime in 2009 . 
  should be open on saturday though , right ? 
  that does not help with the problem of more and more rivers becomming a series of lakes instead . 
  the [ 99 percent invisible podcast ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/fish-cannon/ ) did an episode on the problems . 
  it does also talk about the salmon cannon . 
  there is going to be office and living spaces . 
  the whole project is called `` werkviertel '' .

  i would actually appreciate more chrome on that car . 
  i 'm glad op at least did n't go with black wheels as well . 
  uhm , vermicelli are thicker than spaghetti ... 
  finally an i8 that looks good . 
  only critique i have is that the rear tires should be lambo-level fat . 
  matte black also works really well on it , i do n't like it on a lot of cars . 
  yes . 
  do n't worry , all your hipster-geekness cann be serviced by one allmighty subreddit : / r/mechanicalheadpens /, 
  how do you get onto the island ? 
  it 's in no way about functionality . 
  form over function applies very heavily with this kind of tuning . 
  look at the car in the op , do you think it is faster than a factory fresh i8 ? 
  no way . 
  this is about looks only , and those tires look flimsy on a car with a body styled like a supercar . 
  part number is 52207118674 for black .
