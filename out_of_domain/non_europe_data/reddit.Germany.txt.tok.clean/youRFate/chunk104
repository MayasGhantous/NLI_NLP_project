  also , sharing artwork is fine , but if it is literally plastered with the logo of your corp then a discussion about it is warranted im my opinion . 
  good luck .

  really ? 
  i do n't get why some vegans try to make their food look like meat , now they even want it to sound like it . 
  just seems weird to me .

  germany here , i have never seen a toilet with any kind of crack at the door , they usually have seals . 
  below the stalls there is maybe half a foot open space , helps with cleaning .

  my ranger has a human bane bow as well as +4 favored enemy humanoid human . 
  i pretty much always cast gravity bow before fights as well . 
  this results in 4 arrows per round , each dealing 4d6 +11 , more if i have buffs . 
  ok , best way to get these to rotate on random ? 
  its more than 2 years . 
  no more spoiler tag required for that imho .

  uhm , as long as they are still open i 'd expect to get served . 
  edit : it is apparently unreasonalbe to expect service at an open business . 
  not here in europe , we like the chrome . 
  verlegen etc. 
  right !, 
  oh no , he does n't black out every single part of the car and then starts adding on carbon fiber like the rest of us creative geniuses ? 
  he has no taste and should not own a bmw . 
  but i was still amazed by the quality of the execution . 
  a is the grade , which is qualty . 
  you need to match the class first . 
  you can fit a class 5 power distribution in there . 
  it works like this : the number is the `` size '' of the part , so you should always get the biggest you can fit in that slot . 
  then you go looking for a good quality of that size . 
  i would advise so . 
  as far as i know you should swap the reactor first , and then get a power distribution that can handle the power the reactor spits out . 
  those are not rats , and if you think a rat could fit in there then i think you have never seen one . 
  all front loaders typically wo n't open the door until you tell them to drain the interior . 
  however , all of them also have an emergency unlock somewhere . 
  on miele machines it 's typically behind a flap on the lower left or right of the front . 
  oh , so i should go and find a system with a metallic ring instead of a metal rich ring . 
  well , it 's time to leave this system anyways , as i want to buy a cobra mk 3 now , but the station here does n't sell it . 
  a is best . 
  nice !, 
  we have already migrated to 60 herculis . 
  i was mining in 60 herculis . 
  i 'm at about 2.4 mio net worth now , time to swap the cobra for a type-6 . 
  i just purchased a type-6 , fitted with about 64 slots of cargo , prospector limpets , dual collector limpets and 7 bin refinery . 
  the powerplant can keep the two mining lasers going for longer than an asteroid takes to fully deplete . 
  seems to be working like a charm . 
  what 's up with the quotes around `` bizzarrini \u201e ? 
  it 's like reverse german quotes . 
  my current [ type-6 loadout ] ( http://coriolis.io/outfit/type_6_transporter/03b4b4e2e3b2e4c2l2l00030404042148c001p4.iw1-ka==.aw1-ka== ) comes in at around 2.9 mio cr and it 's one hell of a mining vessel imho . 
  op still not correct , he used an appostrophe ... 
  why would there even be koozies at a wedding ? 
  was it held at a trailer park ? 
  right , that 's planned after the next haul or so , when the money is in :d . you are right about that collector though , as-is i have to wait a while for the limpets to collect everything after i 'm done with an asteroid . 
  also , is there a way to tell limpets not to bring stuff i jetisson back to my ship ? 
  as soon as google keyboard detects automatically if i 'm writing in german , french or english i 'll switch to it . 
  it does look gorgeous , but i switch languages so often and while using the phone that having to press a button on the keyboard would be kind of annoying . 
  that looks lovely . 
  are the koozies used for cans ? 
  pardon my ignorance , but i 'd associate koozies with canned beverages which seem trashy to me . 
  all weddings i 've been to here usually take place at big restaurants or hotels that have a ballroom . 
  bevrages are always served in glasses . 
  i mostly jettison limpets when i brought too many, 
  angled towards each other ? 
  this seems weird to me , i like them further appart and angled out . 
  but what ever floats your boat i guess ... 
  heh , nobody there has ever been to switzerland apparently ... 
  prost !, 
  wtf is wrong with this video ? 
  they did n't show a single landing ... 
  i 'm currently mining away in my [ fairly nice asp explorer ] ( http://coriolis.io/outfit/asp/05b5b5e4e4a5e5c2m2m1212242406060003054b1rc002p4c5.iw18wq==.aw18wq== ) in 60 herculis , racking in about 1.5 mio / hour , sometimes more . 
  but i think i want to start looking at getting my lasers dirty and fight some bad guys . 
  my current net worth is about 13 mio , what would you recommend ? 
  my current plan is to keep mining until about 25 mio , then get a fully tricked out vulture . 
  on the other hand , i might want to get into combat sooner , but i think my profits would greaty diminsh thereby pushing the vulture further into the future ? 
  i 've since read up on it and i 'm planing to gut out my mining gear and turn my aspx into a pure trader . 
  might prove to be a nice break from mining and rack a nice amount of money . 
  having just found a nice new appartment without too much hassle ( in the end i had 2 to choose from ) i 'm going to share my secrets here :, 
  immobilienscout24 seems full of scammes and most places there are overrun mass-showings . 
  there i usually got a showing data for pretty much every appartment i applied to . 
  it 's important to read the full descriptions , some agents / landlords want to be contacted by phone only and will dismiss all e-mails . 
  also you can sometimes find the name of the agent / landlord in there , so you can personalize your application text . 
  for text applications include the following :, 
  * \\ # of persons moving in, 
  * pet ( s ), 
  * employment status, 
  * monthly household income, 
  * move in date,
