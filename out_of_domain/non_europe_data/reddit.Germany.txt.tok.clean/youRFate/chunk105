  # newspaper classifieds, 
  but what got me the place i ended up taking is the [ s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/ ) , a large and respectable newspaper . 
  they run housing classifieds on wednesday and friday . 
  i booked an ad stating what i was looking for and what i was willing to pay , the ad cost me about 30 $ . 
  after that i got quite a lot of calls with some very nice places . 
  i visited 5 that i found very promissing , 2 of them told me i could have the place . 
  friends of mine that used this have reported simmilar positive results . 
  # documents, 
  even if they do n't ask for it directly , you should always supply the following documents to the real estate agent or landlord if they invite you to a showing :, 
  * schufa report ( german credit score equivalent ), 
  * last 3 months of payslips, 
  * short cv , stating the most important things like no pets , non smoker, 
  * voluntary information disclusure form , called * selbstauskunft * . 
  some agencies will supply their own . 
  if you do not make money you are going to have a very bad time . 
  as a student you will porbably need someone to vouch for the rent . 
  if for example your parents vouch for the rent , be sure to bring a * selbstauskunft * about them as well , as well as their last 3 payslips . 
  # showings, 
  if you do get invited to a showing , the game is on . 
  now it 's all about first impressions . 
  be on time , if you know you ca n't make it , call them . 
  if you arrive late you can usually forget about getting that place . 
  dress appropriately , a nice button-down shirt goes a long way . 
  if you can , show up in your fancy bmw instead of on foot . 
  at the door , if the apparment has carpet flooring or simmilar , ask if you should take off your shoes . 
  once inside , important things to note are kitchen facilities , washing mashine fittings , is there a fridge / freezer included etc. 
  tell the landlord / agent that you like the place , and keep them in conversation . 
  at the end , hand over the documents you brought ( see * documents * section ) and ask how you will further proceed . 
  you might want to call them again a few days later to show continued interest . 
  there is a button to vent all your cargo immediately , is n't there ? 
  do railgun shots really have no range limit ? 
  idk really . 
  i 've never handed over anything , i 'll usually just submit to interdiction , boost and charge fsd . 
  i think it would just be a performance thing , not having endless railgun shots floating around in endless space .

  keep in mind , that at about 200ft . 
  in height you will need to install colored airplane warning lights ... :d, 
  keep in mind , that at about 200ft . 
  in height you will sadly also need to install colored aircraft warning lights on your new ham radio tower ... :d, 
  you should read up on what a muffler is ... 
  the only explanation i can think about is that our definitions of `` not overweight '' are vastly different ... 
  hotas support ? 
  they were both pledged to opposing military factions . 
  prepare to fight if you join powerplay . 
  the alps are no where near transylvania or even romania . 
  idk why they seem to be trying to brand the southern carpathians as `` transylvanian alps '' . 
  i think you should look into using a browser that has a kiosk mode , like [ surf ] ( http://surf.suckless.org/ ) . 
  you can set it to the website and disable users from doing anything else on the machine . 
  you then start it for example with ` surf - fk pvld.org/catalog` , meannig fullscreen kiosk mode . 
  it wo n't even have tabs or an address bar etc , it will only display the website . . that way you might be able to stop having to restart chromium . 
  i would also run the machine with a read only filesystem , on read only memory cards , so that users have no chance to screw up anything . 
  i have [ burton aluminum studs ] ( http://www.backcountry.com/burton-aluminium-stud-mat ) on my board as a stomp pad , close to the rear binding . 
  i like them , they are very grippy and the adhesive has yet to come off . 
  i cleaned the board surface with rubbing alcohol before sticking them on and pressed them on by strapping a wooden board over them with parallel clamps . 
   an telephone operator . 
  be sure to stay in that school for a little while longer :p, 
  all of europe has that in some form or another . 
  here in germany it 's every 2 years . 
  also , any modification to the car , like suspesion modifications , need to be inspected to be legal . 
  if you do n't have the paperwork for your wheels and suspension with you when the cops check you out you 'll have a very bad time . 
  i mounted them in two rows and perfectly spaced out , there may have been a compass involved in constructing the final positions :p, 
  i do n't want to know how you managed to land on your pad ... 
  is n't * pickerl * a word for pretty much every official adhesive seal in austria ? 
  we germans call the austrian highway vignette a * pickerl * . 
  last time i was at the t\u00dcv the flexible pipe connecting the turbo charger to the particle filter had a slight crack , but they let me pass with a fix it notice . 
  when i went there to get my wheels registered a small fistfight broke out , that was fun . 
  some old dude cut in line in front of a maserati driver , and the old guy hit the other dude when he confronted him . 
  t\u00dcv employees then told the old dude to wait in front of some other gate , which never opened in the hour i was there . 
  i hear it used like that a lot here in bavaria . 
  the car is a diesel , so it pretty much needs a turbo :d . 
  this will only damage cheap micowaves . 
  the damage is caused because with nothing to absorb the waves they all get absorbed by the magnetron tube , heating it up considerably and maybe even damaging it . 
  in high quality microwave ovens this is prevented . 
  berlin is north of london . 
  there are no bridges across the amazon river , the longest river on earth . 
  every part you want to add to safety relevant systems of the car needs to be certified for that specific car model . 
  i lowered my car and put different weels on , i needed about 30 pages of certifications so that the t\u00dcv would accept it all , and it 's a pretty tame mod imho , [ judge for your self ] ( https://i.imgur.com/0w0dd8a.jpg ) . 
  i maybe want to add spacers to the back , but that would require going back to the t\u00dcv to have it all certified again ... 
  help me build a vulture for fun pve combat :d, 
  my current build : http://coriolis.io/outfit/vulture/04a5a4e3d5a4d3c1e1e0m0c07-4a2b272566.iw19ka==.aw19ka==, 
  any suggestions ? 
  do i need a bigger frameshift interdictor ? 
  i , too , would have loved counter strike as a kid . 
  yes , power is kind of the issue . 
  i went with gimbaled pulse lasers , as burst or beam lasers draw too much power . 
  should i maybe replace one of the lasers with a projectile weapon ? 
  so you say 1a interdictor . 
  what about shield ? 
  biggest shield availabe , a grade ? 
  additional shield boosers ? 
  do n't build hotels , build as many houses as possible while you 're ahead , so the other 's ca n't build any because none are left over . 
  hilton hotels are n't really that expensive . 
  i was prepared pretty well and actually loved cooking boefre moving out , the only thing i never used on my own was a washing machine . 
  i had seen one used many times , but when i pulled out the little drawer for the detergent , there were three slots , labeld i , ii and some symbol . 
  i went back to my pc and did some googling before i returned to that machine . 
  also , in my fridge , there is a knob labled 1 through 7 , i did n't know if 1 is colder or if 7 means more `` cooling power '' . 
  but a good gas stove is so much better , cherish it . 
  i just use google keep for my shopping list , i can add stuff to it whenever i remember / think of something i want . 
  douse the interrior in oven cleaner foam , rub it down with a dish sponge .
