  in elektro - und informationstechnik . 
  a large number of them was probably planted using something like this [ automated mine layer tank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baysj2sv0gs ) . 
  i 'm guessing here , but i 'd say some form of timed arming system . 
  add the oil after draining them , not in the water . 
  also never rinse cooked pasta . 
  incredibly beautiful . 
  yes . 
  the control software for those drones is actually distributed via steam and has steam achivements for stuff like hitting your first taliban with a jdam . 
  maybe they will automatically replace every url with a short url ? 
  we had a kinda big party , one of the guests decided we needed cheeseburgers and asked around who else wanted some . 
  he then drove his van to mcd and ordered 80 cheeseburgers at the drive through . 
  the worker asked again `` 18 cheeseburgers , are you sure ? '', 
  he repplied `` 80 , not 18 . '', 
  that took quite a while , and took up a lot of space , since they would only put like 5 or 6 per bag . 
  but it was a glorious feast . 
  i 'd be really worried about people just scratching the car because they disagree with it ... 
  i mean , if it just went up in flames on it self that is a very good reason to have a meltdown in my opinion . 
  i think it 's very reasonable to expect a rental car not to spontaneously combust . 
  be a man and get some 0w-30 up in that beard . 
  the material goes to the sides . 
  there is less material in a blade the same size with a fuller than in a blade without a fuller , or the blade with the fuller is bigger at the same weight . 
  i 'm no blacksmith , but i guess it will alter the structure of the metal , maybe making it stronger in some way . 
  forged metal is typically stronger than a machined piece of the same weight and dimmension , because the structure of the metal is alligned with the form . 
  this is also the reason why for example forged aluminum wheels can be made lighter than their cast counterparts . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forging#advantages_and_disadvantages, 
  i do n't usually like corvettes , but that car looks nice . 
  also , where is that ? 
  it looks lovely . 
  nothing is ever by itself in japan , there will always be rice . 
  yes it is . 
  are you sure ? 
  as far as i know they use maker 's mark barrels . 
  i 'm pretty sure that is mentioned in one of the small documentaries about the distillery that are on youtube . 
  hd serien / filme / youtube unterwegs streamen etc. 
  hab momentan 50 mb/s downstream , 10 mb/s upstream , von congstar . 
  nah , blues feel different from browns , the tactile bump is more pronounced . 
  i like browns as an ok stubstitute for blues where noise is an issue , but i vastly prefer blues . 
  the old saying of `` something that is on one harddrive is on no harddrive '' is as important as always . 
  i was talking about this part :, 
   yeah blues actually have a part with only the purpose of making them louder . 
  that part is not just there to make them louder , that part is responsible for the crisper feel . 
  proper german beer benches have to hold up no problem to 5 guys standing / jumping around on them . 
  they typically look like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/narrentreffen_baerenthal1.jpg ) . 
  germany here , we have those in places where lots of men do lots of pissing , like in beer gardens etc. 
  modern ones look like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/a6j3uub.jpg ) . 
  sometines it 's also tiles instead of metal . 
  also build your house like a normal german house , e.g. 
  concrete basement , all masonery walls , strom proof tile roof . 
  then watch when a hurricane comes and your house is the last one standing , unaffected . 
  after that your company will probably be flooded with orders . 
  that is because they typically require a frame on the bottom that you have to step over . 
  for front doors that would be somewhat inconvenient . 
  ah , i love my proper european electrical intallations with lightswitches actually inside the bathroom , not outside . 
  not energy , but you are reducing their lifespan by letting them cool off and heating them up again . 
  same here , there were no snacks during the day . 
  we have breakfast , lunch , coffe and dinner , that is enough food . 
  snacks are for the evening . 
  i think that is totally reasonable and i do n't eat snacks before having had dinner . 
  i also typically do n't drink any soft drinks etc. 
  before dinner . 
  no pullcord switches here , never seen one in a bathroom . 
  depends on how old the bathroom is . 
  if it does not have a [ residual-current device ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/residual-current_device ) then they might be fitted outside or up high for fear of electrocution . 
  however , these devices are now mandatory by law for any rooms where water is present and have been for quite a while . 
  a nice anecdote our digital compression professor told us :, 
  back when he worked in the industry a company demo 'd their new system that was supposedly able to live encode video with some video compression algorithm , i forgot which one . 
  that was a big deal back then . 
  they had a camera set up in the conference room that recorded it , it then went through their box and was displayed live on some screen . 
  that setup ran as a demonstraion while they held their presentation and it worked fine , until someone knocked over the camera stand . 
  the sudden massive change in the picture crashed the compression hardware and the screen went black . 
  the german equivalent to that is `` g\u00f6bbeln '' . 
  bryleigh sounds like the sound people make while vomiting . 
  bored and annoyed from driving somewhere ? 
  drive faster !, 
  it is way more fun and your boredom will quickly go a way . 
  found the guy named bryleigh . 
  nice , now lower eeeeeeet , i can see in above the wheel ... 
  do you ride your teeny , tiny bicicleta to school ? 
  the german pronounciation of * minute * ( german for minutes ) is actually pretty close to the english pronounciation of * minute * . 
  i can wholeheartedly recommend all charging products made by anker . 
  their [ qi charger ] ( http://www.amazon.com/anker-wireless-powerport-charging-qi-enabled/dp/b00y839ymu?ie=utf8&amp;keywords=anker%20qi&amp;qid=1464613315&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1 ) is no exception , i use it daily with my n5 . 
  i have written a review mentioning it in the pro unlocker that unlocks sftp . 
  hahaha , prepare to have your view of subatomics shattered , introducing , [ the wave-particle duality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wave%e2%80%93particle_duality ) , which states that electrons are at the same time particles and waves , and exhibit clear properties of each form . 
  that reminds me of when whitfield diffie testified on newegg 's behalf in the tqp patent troll lawsuits . 
  this wonderfull exchange happened :, 
   `` we 've heard a good bit in this courtroom about public key encryption , '' said albright . 
  `` are you familiar with that ? '', 
   `` yes , i am , '' said diffie , in what surely qualified as the biggest understatement of the trial . 
   `` and how is it that you 're familiar with public key encryption ? '', 
   `` i invented it . '', 
  source : http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/newegg-trial-crypto-legend-diffie-takes-the-stand-to-knock-out-patent/, 
  that is true for the us , but here in germany , where w\u00fcrstel / wiener kinda come from , mechanically spearated meat is not widely used , as products containing it have to be labled and few customers buy products labled with * separatorenfleisch * . 
  it is mostly used to produce animal feed here . 
  really ? 
  i 've only seen it once in some really horribly cheap sausages . 
  even the supermarket store brand stuff does n't contain it . 
  to me it looks like hail shredded away all the grapes and leaves . 
  who needs lights when you can be * faster than light * !, 
  i 've used your app for a long time now , i 've tried pretty much every reddit app that came out out of curiosity , but i always came back to sync . 
  thank you for actively developing and supporting the app !,
