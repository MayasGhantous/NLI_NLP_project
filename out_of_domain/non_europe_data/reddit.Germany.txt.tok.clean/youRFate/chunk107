  i 've bought it a long time ago and by now it 's way beyond what i could reasonably expect to get for the 2-3 $ i paid . 
  love the update , the new animations make the app look even better .

  i read rothfuss ' * kingkiller chronicle * series before it , and found those quite lacking , herbert 's eloquence is very refreshing in comparison .

  we never had free plastic bags here in germany as far as i know . 
  the bags / u/rob3110 posted usually cost about 20c . 
  from my personal experience that very much depends on the location of the store . 
  when i 've been to shittier parts of towns people use way more platic bags . 
  in nicer areas everyone brings their own bags / backpacks etc.

  i made [ a post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ ) about this a year ago , my source was [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqr_r9qtryw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=658 ) on the motortrend youtube . 
  for those of you that ca n't see it , [ this picture ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hvwpety.jpg ) kinda clears it up , [ source ] ( http://jalopnik.com/the-bmw-i8-ate-a-porsche-911-1307154852 ) . 
  the pictures in the comments [ here ] ( http://jalopnik.com/the-bmw-i8-ate-a-porsche-911-1307154852 ) try to clear it up .

  kristall is a type of wei\u00dfbier which is filtered . 
  erdinger also sells kristall , see http://int.erdinger.de/beer/kristall.html,

  no waiter in a truly fancy reastaurant i 've ever been to used a tray for food . 
  how would you even serve food from a tray ? 
  set it down on the table and hand out the plates ? 
  using two-factor authentication on the same device as the token generator kind of defeats it 's purpose . 
  i really ca n't stand wil unfortunately .

  bitcoin checker seems ok-ish , but i do n't really like the look of the widget . 
  the very big title that says `` bitcoin checker '' on it is very much wasted space .

  was it something super common that you would reasonably expect every italian restaurant to carry ? 
  weird . 
  that said , i would assume that pretty much every italian restaurant has arrabiata on the menu , i can understand someone ordering it without even looking at the menu , but if you then tell them you do n't have it then they should just order something else ...

  well done !, 
  the [ wiki entry on finding a place to live ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) could be helpful . 
  good luck !, 
  something else i just remembered , parking spaces :, 
  most appartments that i checked out came with parking spaces with the price either included in the kaltmiete or in addition to it , which you had to take . 
  if your appartment includes a parking spot and you do n't have a car , do n't worry . 
  you can sublease that spot to someone else for usually 50-100 $ per month ( covered spaces , less for open-air spots ) . 
  also , if your appartment has [ duplex parking ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vnwnn9k.jpg ) ( pretty common here ) and you have the choice , always take the upper space , as any drippings from the upper cars , especially in winter , will drop on the lower one . 
  i 've tried lots of gins , but i still do enjoy the basic tanqueray a lot . 
  that and beefeater 24 , but those two are very different . 
  tonic wise i love thomas henry tonic , but idk if that is avaialabe outside of germany . 
  be aware that it is not really customary to have photos on your application in germany . 
  my goto is fairly classic : ice , gin , tonic , lemon wedges , and cubeb peppercorns . 
  i bought a whole thing of cubeb pepper accidentally a while ago when i meant to buy black peppercorns . 
  it 's actually a really cool spice if you find a good applicaton , and g&t is definitely a good one .

  there have been rumors that a chemical exists that makes urinating in a pool very visible . 
  they should develop that for real and introduce it . 
  i think shaming people that do it is the best way to stop it . 
  sync . 
  it 's a violation , but you do n't lose your license over it . 
  you 'll get a 100 $ fine and 1 point on your license . 
  also , driving in the left lane if you could have used a lane further to the right is also a violation , 80 $ , 1 point . 
  i do n't think repo men would be after an old car like that . 
  chanterelles are like the best thing that grows out of the ground . 
  sautee them with some shallots and flecks of bacon , deglaze with white wine and add cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche .

  ca n't wait until it 's fall again , they are so much better when they are in season and you can get them locally . 
  ok , i 'm new to this and i 'm dabling my hands in it on the kraken exchange . 
  i 've bought about 10 $ worth of btc @ 500 $ a few days ago and i 've put up a 15 % trailing stop order . 
  that means that once the price starts to drop 15 % from it 's latest high it will sell , right ? 
  right , so it works like i imagined it . 
  thanks for the example !,
