  i find that hard to believe . 
  this is very reasonable . 
  if someone would throw up in my bushes i would be less than pleased . 
  it 's missing the smell of the 2-stroke engine fumes, 
  well maybe something like ... releasing the game ? 
  i actually tested that last stress test and the fps did not differ at all for me . 
  seeing that the billboard is in english i would suppose that this is not located in germany . 
  update : nevermind , they just fixed the support article : http://en.support.guildwars2.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9054, 
  this has totally been shopped to appear way more saturated than it was . 
  even their teeth are red ... 
  wow , so much pseudoscience it hurts . 
  yea , like that 's gon na work ... 
  i was listening to doomsday by nero while looking at ops picture and thought of an art installation :d, 
  genius, 
  except that your feet go back and forth . 
  nice, 
  i love his old videos from when he started to live out there , building the road , building the spring dome , insulating the banana building and upgrading the house . 
  this is a lvl 70 event i think . 
  it 's in frostgorge sound, 
  that concept looks like it 's done by loewe , which is a expensive german entertainment brand . 
  are you in australia ? 
  if yes it 's probably gon na kill you . 
  it should just be 25 stacks per person attacking . 
  if 2 bleeder necros attack you you get double the damage . 
  just as 2 warriors attacking you deal 2x the damage to you . 
  i 'd go with the s65 amg , thank you . 
  i just read `` goodbye best friend '' and thought `` what a strange way to bury your dog ... 
  i 'm german and it 's actually `` ananas '' . 
  as far as i 'm aware the word `` kemanestraustch '' does not exist . 
  i understand german and i do n't get it ... 
  git merge / r/torchlight2, 
  git branch - d / r/torchlight2, 
  how many gears does a french tank have ? 
  * 5 : 4 backwards and 1 forward , in case the enemy comes from behind . 
  how many people does it take to defend paris ? 
  * no one knows , nobody has ever tried . 
  probably still less meat than on a big king xxl . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  is that common superstition somewhere ? 
  i know of ladder and mirror , but the umbrella one is not known here ( southern germany ) . 
  i have actually never seen such a thing in reality . 
  they see me rollin ' ... 
  i 'd go for a lenovo thinkpad . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but every camera i know of disables the red light during the shot it self ... 
  also : dynaudio speakers . 
  ... pretty much only in australia . 
  on newer backtrack systems you will fist need to stop the networking services or airmon-ng will not work . 
  the older backtrack came with scripts for that , but i ca n't seem to find them in bt5r3 gnome . 
  many perfer kde , but i wanted to give gnome a try since i had only tried it out briefly before . 
  i can totally see this picture become an image macro . 
  i 've seen this exact title before ... downvote until clarified . 
  found it : [ this guy did the same thing , but not with the same title . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wcwdp/i_guess_im_not_the_only_one_who_reddit_sent/ ), 
  not the same title , but the same location : http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wcwdp/i_guess_im_not_the_only_one_who_reddit_sent/, 
  yes , i found that aswell , but i was looking for the post i linked . 
  btw , if you want to search reddit use google with site : reddit.com , that 's what i used to find this . 
  maybe he is using it to record the sound ... 
  contacts . 
  my support guardian : http://i.minus.com/inkasj0rssxqm.jpg, 
  sorry , did n't hide the interface, 
  he is not doing anything to their computer , he only records and analyzes the packets they send over ** his ** network . 
  setting the bssid to the same value is no problem at all . 
  see for example the [ airbase-ng ] ( http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airbase-ng ) which comes bundled in the popular aircrack-ng suite . 
  i would however not recommend you to do this , as this might be seen as an illegal attack . 
  yes, 
  that 's when i thought you would add 2 hands ... 
  i call fake ... why would n't he have a proper wheelchair . 
  are you aware of free dynamic dns systems like [dyndns.org ] ( http://dyn.com/dns/ ) ? 
  you can get your own dynamicly updated hostname . 
  i use that to connect to my home network . 
  that is not how capacitive touch screens work at all . 
  you influence the electrostatic field with your fingers , and that change in the field is measured . 
  you do not close any contacts with your finger . 
  try this post : http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=how_to_crack_wep_with_no_clients, 
  i 've used one similar to [ this one ] ( http://i.minus.com/iwj8anx6vkinq.jpg ) , it has a rubber seal in the cap that is 100 % water tight , it never leaked . 
  probably an accurate description of that stuff ... 
  it 's easy if you start at the bottom ... 
  you can even stack them to \u00dcber\u00fcbermorgen and vorvorgestern, 
  btw , if you want to substitute and \u00c4 / \u00d6 / \u00dc you use ae , oe and ue , not just a/o/u . 
  most of all * hear * it in action . 
  how did it go ? 
  that is n't new at all . 
  that is just mhl , i have an adapter that looks exactly the same as the one in the picture ( except for the logos ) for my htc sensation xe . 
  that line looks shopped in ... 
  ok , thanks , 
  i was having some problems with me heels getting caught when i ride turns really low . 
  i 'll have to measure how wide my binding with shoes in it is then . 
  i 'm not that much of a park rider , i mostly ride slopes and powder , with the occasional jumps in parks if i come around them . 
  i 'll probably look into about 160cm then . 
  the blacklight is nice , but about 200 $ out of my price range , 
  so it 's probably gon na be a [ nitro thief 161 ] ( http://nitrousa.com/board/thief ) . 
  it never happened to me ... the fabric of my belt probably is too thick to do this . 
  here in germany that would probably only have destroyed the bathroom closet . 
  is n't it usually given as 9,8 ** 1 ** m/s \u00b2 ? 
  tanks for the advice !, 
  i 've read a guide on how to wax already , but i do n't own the equipement yet . 
  i plan on going for a trip soon so i wanted to know if i 'll be fine . 
  waxing stuff will be ordered soon . 
  that would imply you use all your lights for roughly the same amount of time , which seems unrealistic . 
  it just says that the rockets the palestinians are firing suck .
