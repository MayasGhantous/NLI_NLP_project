  really though ? 
  my friends and i have pretty much moved on from facebook . 
  i just twitter more often now . 
  how insecure can you be ? 
  you forgot copious ammounts of garlic . 
  most grilled squid i had in italy and croatia was usually filled with some delicious garlic based stuffing . 
  heimatsm\u00fchle , nothing even comes close . 
  i disassembled my cousin 's hp notebook once . 
  compressed air did n't fix the heat problems so i opened it up . 
  there was a solid mat of lint in the cooler , looked exactly like dryer lint . 
  i removed that , and also fitted the whole cooling system with fresh thermal paste . 
  after that it worked like a charm . 
  for audi i 'd say the original logo is this : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/bsg-zsg_horch.svg, 
  it used to be called horch ( german for hear / listen ) , later that name was translated from german to latin . 
  as a german i have to agree . 
  however , it would be even better with a full bodied red wine .

  das teil ( [ schaut so aus ] ( http://www.thomann.de/de/jo_ral_bubble_2a_586805_trompetendaempfer.htm?ref=search_rslt_jo+ral+harmon_162256_0 ) ) kam an , war total zerbeult . 
  interessant . 
  siehe [ head-fi thread ] ( http://www.head-fi.org/t/708756/asus-xonar-essence-stx-ii ) . 
  no , twitch installs arch linux was gold . 
  it got turned into a botnet slave a few times . 
  then they managed to install arch , and went ahead to intall dwarf fortress and play that . 
  oooh yes . 
  here in germany you can legally buy and drink beer and wine as soon as you 're 14 , if you are with your parents and they consent . 
  at 16 you can buy beer and wine by your self . 
  at 18 you can buy any kind of alcoholic drink by yourself . 
  holy shit , as a non-american that is seriously weird and fucked up to see something like this at a fast food restaurant ... over . 
  having religion shoved down your throat at a retail place . 
  over . 
  home ? 
  down ? 
  b\u00e4nder ? 
  that exists somewhere . 
  i 've seen somone that had it . 
  it comes with some holder for your belt that is probably magnetic or something . 
  he had the receiver on his hip . 
  it rang and he took the call by putting the receiver from his belt to his ear . 
  the big band i played in had an amazing version of the pink panther theme in our repertoire . 
  it was always a really big hit with any crowd . 
  it was also so much fun to play . 
  not true . 
  you can install some software inside the virtual machine to make the intergration with the `` outside '' more seamless , but you can definitely build vms that are not distinguishable from `` real '' pcs by software running in them . 
  change.org has never changed anything ... 
  that is how you get thrown out of the factory . 
  without your camera . 
  that is a matter you can then later fight over with their legal team and your lawyer , if you can afford one . 
  however , when you eventually get your camera back it wo n't have any of the film on it , that 's for sure . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it 's about filming inside a factory of some company without permission , of course they are going to take your camera . 
  try filming at the company i work at , i dare you . 
  armed security will have your camera within seconds . 
  yes , but the permission is only about filming a specific thing . 
   they had agreed before the shoot not to film certain things but kept trying to record them anyway . 
  in that case you 're breaching whatever permission you have . 
  oh , right , i forgot you were james bond . 
  never mind then , keep infiltrating . 
  best of luck . 
  side legends usually are n't double shot , as they do n't get worn . 
  that does not look like s\u00fctterlin to me at all . 
  it 's a kurrent handwriting . 
  ca n't you still do something like `` i lost my 2fa token , call me to resolve this '' or something ? 
  there surely is some measure in playce for recovery after your token get 's lost . 
  i , too , use the google authenticator app 2fa thingy . 
  i also have those backup keys printed out and stored safely . 
  i was just under the impression that maybe you could still recover your google account even if you lost all that . 
  you do n't have a charger in your car ? 
  how do you live with yourself ? 
  it has a lot to do with what kind of tire you use as well . 
  i switched from 17 '' to 19 '' on my e91 , but the tires were runflats on the 17 '' . 
  the 19 '' with dunlop sport maxx feel so much nicer to drive . 
  also , the 19 '' wheels are about the same weight as my 17 '' , because they have much finer spokes and are flow formed . 
  you have to buy high quality lambs wool . 
  those do n't itch . 
  if you buy xl eggs this is kinda common . 
  once had 2 of those in the same pack of 10 eggs ... 
  [ leatherman wave ] ( https://www.leatherman.com/wave-10.html ) im rucksack . 
  i hope that line is rarely used . 
  otherwise living or working there is probably annoying as fuck . 
  ab aufs re4 , sie and verhaftet !, 
  imho hamburgerei beats them burger wise , but only by a very small margin . 
  if you truly want authentic bavarian beer culture nothing beats [ augustiner at landsberger stra\u00dfe ] ( https://g.co/kgs/kdpck3 ), 
  also , key club ? 
  lockpicking ? 
  or grow up on a country where it 's free . 
  yay germany !, 
  or , you know , eat 3 times a day like a normal person ... 
  european cash system is nice in that regard . 
  transferring money inside the eu is free . 
  also , i do n't pay fees for withdrawing money here in germany if i go to atms that are part of my bank 's cash pool . 
  outside germany i get free cash at every atm if i use my mastercard . 
  if it 's not in euro i pay 1 % exchange fee . 
  yes , isuzu elf . 
  isuzu trucks are amazingly reliably and cheap . 
  if you need to move stuff around rural china , nothing beats an all wheel drive isuzu , especially since you can get parts for them at every corner , on the off chance that something should break . 
  the technology museum in speyer , germany [ has one on display ] ( http://speyer.technik-museum.de/en/spaceshuttle-buran ) . 
  when i applied for my master 's in ee at tum the questions were mostly aimed to find out if i indeed planned on going though with it . 
  i guess they do n't want applicant 's that throw the towel within the first semesters , as that 's very bad for their statistics . 
  there were some rudimentary questions related to my field as well , but nothing in depth at all .
