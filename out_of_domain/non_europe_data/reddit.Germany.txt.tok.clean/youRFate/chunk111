  to expand on that a little bit , they were very pleased to hear that i already had a place to live sorted out and that i had a student employee job lined up . 
  also , i brought a short cv and i had the list of lectures they offer printed out and highlighted some that seemed particularly interesting to me . 
  they appreciate if you have already made yourself familliar with how their master 's course actually works and which lectures in particular you want to partake in . 
  also , turbine engines are lighter than piston engines of equivalent power and are less complicated . 
  now i have that garden center smell in my nose . 
  i should really visit one .

  app ? 
  nitrogen suffocation is the way to go . 
  you just fall asleep and never wake up . 
  we call it cuba libre here in germany . 
  usually that implies using actual cuban rum .

   we walked in and i 'm dressed to the nines, 
  i really love that . 
  i often go to good restaurants i like for a quick meal , and some people consider them so fancy that they show up all dressed up like it 's their wedding ... 
  video of the shooter i just got on whatsapp ( higher quality than the twitter ones ) https://vid.me/n0lj, 
  as i child i vastly prefered pizza that had cooled overnight and was then heated in a microwave . 
  something about it being evenly warm with perfectly melty cheese just really appealed to me . 
  one with a rotating plate thingy . 
  does n't look like germany to me , the weird striped markes on the middle divider are not something we do here . 
  is it just me , or does it look like a bot like tombstone or icewave would rip all of the bots in the robot wars competition to absolute shreds ? 
  for comparison , minotaur 's drum weights 33kg and spins and 10000-12000rpm . 
  that might be a reference to slartibarfast 's spaceshipt [ bistromath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technology_in_the_hitchhiker%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy#bistromathic_drive ) from the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy series . 
  it looks like an italian birstro and is powered by the irrational mathematics that happen on server 's notepads in italian bistros . 
  they know what they are doing , and that was probably done inside one of the buildings where pretty much nothing gets out anyways . 
  also there is plenty of space around the labs before any public spaces . 
  that is n't agilent , it 's all r&s equipement . 
  i did not create this , i just got it linked to me . 
  afaik that signal generator alone is more than $ 20k . 
  hmm , maybe because it 's used . 
  also , i bet that gps stuff is an expensive software option , that you have to buy separately . 
  seeing as this was done in a lab that specializes in testing mobile phones , including their gps , you can bet that they have the proper licenses and shielding required . 
  also , this is munich , germany , not the us . 
  when you 're under the influence , with terry o'reilly . 
  so sleek , and those brakes , hnng ! . 
  also , i love that you kept the chrome in the grille . 
  so many people black that out and i think the chrome there looks so good . 
  good analysis !, 
  i did n't make this . 
  a colleague sent me the link . 
  loundest video in the world . 
  what 's up with instagram and twitter not having any way to controle volume ? 
  the symbol for gram is g , not gm . 
  not feeling it at all , put the chrome back in . 
  i prefer it without the badge well . 
  here in germany they ask you if you want the badge when you order a car . 
  many people order without . 
  nah , it 's seems to be a thing here in the subreddit though . 
  every 2nd post is some guy replacing their grille with some black version off ebay ... 
  i know ingress , i played it . 
  however , this is not spoofed on the phone , this is an antenna that sends actual gps signals to the phone , just like the ones it receives from the satellites . 
  if you turn off the wifi location thingy , niantic has no way to detect that this is fake . 
  verarbredet war 10:30 in der tiefgarage . 
  klasse support , gute preise , gute funktionen ( dynamisches dns , e-mail forwarding etc. ) . 
  over . 
  you 're confusing something . 
  the `` one click , one action '' rule only applies while you are in combat . 
  addons that work out of combat have always done more things with one click , like auctioneer added a ton of auctions at once . 
  maybe a vsync problem ? 
  try turning v-sync off . 
  fuck that . 
  if i 'm a master artisan whatever crafter i want to know how to make everything . 
  those are [ acai bowls ] ( http://www.josieloves.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/daddy-longlegs1.png ) . 
  can warlocks still speak demonic ? 
  makes your city look like a dump though . 
  i 'm glad nobody does that here in munich . 
  if you enjoy that style of car and/or videos head over to r/stance . 
  multiplayer when ? 
  would you rather have wow characters wear practical armor with closed helmets etc ? 
  i personally like the over the top fantasy look . 
  and that includes shapely females . 
  that is exactly why all those larp/re-enactment people look boring as fuck compared to the awesome over the top fantasy armors we 're used to from rpgs . 
  why is everyone in here whining about her boobs ? 
  the artist is good at drawing and likes hot women , nothing wrong with that . 
  also , that 's how she looks [ in game . 
  \\  45 minutes,

  linear alliance ? 
  the [ bad pet ] ( https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/badpet ) addon is nice for that . 
  it whispers the owner of taunting pets . 
  it does n't officially support legion yet . 
  does it work ? 
  you can disable the track pad on most laptops . 
  on my laptop it 's fn + f2 . 
  go to network settings and turn ** off ** `` optimize for speed '' . 
  are we just going to ignore the blatant misuse of the phrase `` burden of knowledge '' ? 
  it does n't mean `` having to know stuff '' . 
  it 's about having knowledge that depresses you and without which you would live a happier , more blissful life . 
  for fucks sake the ** gorilla ** is a reference to ** harambre ** the ** gorilla ** , you dense cunt . 
  park distance control ? 
  l'osteria has a few restaurants around munich . 
  you 'll get massive deliciou pizzas that easily feeds two people for 7-10 $ . 
  curl - l https://install.pivpn.io | bash, 
  yea , right . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.seancassidy.me/dont-pipe-to-your-shell.html ) for why not . 
  also the pivpn page might detect that it 's piped directly into bash and server different content then , possibly harming the target machine . 
  is it just me or is that front all sorts of bent up ?
