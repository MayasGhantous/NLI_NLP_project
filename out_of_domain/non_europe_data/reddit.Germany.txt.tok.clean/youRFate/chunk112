  those kidneys look very weirdly angled . 
  also the hood protrudes over the bumper and lights . 
  to me it looks like a shoddily fixed frontal collision . 
  look at [ this front ] ( https://i.imgur.com/0w0dd8a.jpg ) for comparison . 
  the fire mages in my group all did multiple million dps for the entire fight ... 
  i have a cash shop mount but i do n't get it mailed to me on new characters ... 
  glockenbachviertel is the magical place you are looking for . 
  shit 's lit . 
  all the oil filters i have bought for my e91 did come with a new gasket for the oil filter housing and the oil drain plug . 
  i always swap them when i change the oil filter , which is every time i change my oil . 
  what do you mean by `` i 'm 16 so i 'm not interested '' ? 
  at 16 we were all about beer and parties ... 
  have a look at our [ wiki article about finding a place to live ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) . 
  especially the part about the newspaper classifieds . 
  i found my current appartment that way . 
  however , my budget was a bit bigger ... 
  i 've been living here for a few years now , and i love my duffel coat . 
  imho a woolen coat is enough for even the lowest temperatures i 've encountered here . 
  i usually wear a wool sweater underneath it and a scarf to go with it . 
  if you do plan on spending a lot of time on christmas markets ( i know you do ! ), 
  it might be wise to bring somewhat warm boots that can withstand a bit of snow/slush . 
  the streets and walkways are usually cleared of snow every morning , but there will be puddles if it does decide to snow heavily . 
  however , it usually does n't snow that much until january so do n't worry too much . 
  yes , 40-60 kg per day for 2 years ... that 's a fit person 's weight each day . 
  master . 
  he needs a ~ ~ welded ~ ~ glued diff so he can really lay down the ~ ~ rubber ~ ~ plastic ... 
  i personally like that they focus on cars . 
  i 'm not interested in bikes . 
  i do n't think you need to inform hamburg of the move , munich will do that one you register there . 
  health insurance will be notified of your move by the city . 
  your bank you will have tell it yourself . 
  i love how the stair / ramp thingy does n't have any railings . 
  that was me writing my master 's thesis . 
  please go back to meme academy , you need to learn . 
  what type of pump is that ? 
  they at least all come with locking diffs and i think even a climb gear . 
  what do you mean , destroy the finish ? 
  you can always just polish it again . 
  i just googled `` tarabl '' and thought it was a type of game ... 
  you gon na want some gloves mate ... 
  perfect . 
  afaik they have very strict laws about companies that are not banks holding on to money for you . 
  samsung were not the first to do that , not by a long shot . 
  car is locked . 
  also , have fun running after a car . 
  a bunch of people surrounded the vehicle and attacked it . 
  you have every right to flee by running them over , they are even going to have to pay for any damage to the car . 
  amazing , i want one . 
  reading `` pre episode discussion '' got me all excited thinking a new season or something is already out ... 
  bmw cars do that automatically when you go in reverse , as long as you have the adjustment selector switched to `` left '' . 
  on mine is only goes left or right . 
  it 's in the manual , and yes , i 've read it . 
  ayyyyyyyyyy, 
  before complaining about anything font related , first install [ infinality ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/infinality ) . 
  that makes everything soooo much better . 
  same . 
  that is not an american thing . 
  here in germany we call ours that , too , but mostly after we finished studying there . 
  war bachelor of engineering fh , somit schon ingenieur . 
  when i buy xl sized eggs i usually get more than one double yolker per carton of 6 . 
  record so far is 4 in a carton of 6 . 
  i usually buy cartons of 10 , but the xl eggs are usually only avialble in packs of 6 , if they are there at all . 
  i sometimes buy them for the novelty . 
  the novelty of double-yolked eggs . 
  here in germany eggs are sold in [ cartons like these ] ( https://i.imgur.com/g0nkbtg.jpg ) . 
  they are also not refigereated here . 
  no need . 
  unwashed eggs keep fine at room temp . 
  some people still do , however . 
  edit : i just had a look . 
  on the egg carton i bought today it says :, 
  minimum shelf life until 11.10.2016 . 
  store at 18 \u00b0 c , keep refigerated at 4-12 \u00b0 c starting 5.10.2016 . 
  heat thoroughly after shelf life expiry . 
  yes , if you wash the protective `` dried slime stuff '' ( scientific term ) off the eggs they will spoil very quickly if not kept refigerated . 
  afaik they need to be washed by law in na . 
  it 's the outside , we do n't wash them , we just use them as-is . 
  his living room has a weird shape . 
  those floor tiles are in stark contrast to the rather modern kitchen counters . 
  i think it 's del , not just de . 
  the second one looks like fd or something . 
  harlaching here . 
  lots of big detached mansions , but still good subway connection and reasonably close to the heart of the city . 
  that is indeed somewhat laughable . 
  `` blau '' . 
  same vein : checking for new exam results on the university website . 
  remove the image during reboot . 
  good job and welcome to the arch crowd :d . 
  get a seedbox outside of germany . 
  i prefer emacs now . 
  i started using it because of the vastly superior editing modes for vhdl , python and latex . 
  i hope you removed your dogshit from that nice beach . 
  no need , google maps does that just fine . 
  imho it 's somewhat clunky to use . 
  why the down votes , they are obviously replicas of the bbs wheels . 
  if you have a bmw but ca n't afford a new badge then you wo n't have fun with your car for very long ... 
  what is under there ? 
  any more info ?
