  30 days . 
  started today , fresh from university . 
  germany, 
  only thing that counts in the end are logs . 
  details !, 
  is always pertty much identical with log data . 
  i found that recound slowed my pc to a crawl on big fights , details !, 
  uses a lot less resources and i ca n't really feel the differenct with it on or off . 
  so in my experience details !, 
  uses a lot less resources than recount while providing a lot more than skada does . 
  also it 's usually identical with log data . 
  fritz quadrata is my jam in wow ui fonts . 
  we got my grandma a new tv . 
  a short while after she asked since when ard ( german tv network ) was broadcasting from heidelberg . 
  after a lot of confusion on me and my dad 's part we figured out that the `` ard hd '' logo in the corner is what made her think that . 
  i have a master 's degree from tum in munich , one of germany and probably europe 's leading universities , and i paid between 100 and 120 $ ( $ 130 ) per semester . 
  muad ` dib is giving water to the dead . 
  yes , diesel turbos usually are around 2 bar . 
  the one in my 3 series diesel is on 1.8 bar stock pressure as far as i know . 
  beergardens will very likely be closed , save for a streak of unexpected amazing weather . 
  however , do visit a good beer hall . 
  the [ augustiner br\u00e4ustuben ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/augustiner+br%c3%a4ustuben/@48.1391151,11.5434739,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x410901f24f8d0417:0x1a2efa2cb8130a2a!8m2!3d48.1391151!4d11.5456626 ) at landsberger stra\u00dfe is in me and my friends ' optinion the best one . 
  it is n't well known with tourists and many ppl . 
  from munich frequent it because it has good food and very reasonable prices . 
  get in your car and drive around aimlessly . 
  i find that extremely calming . 
  bonus points if it 's raining . 
  you mean he denied a beautiful eagle a good meal and saved an animal that is considered a pest ? 
  lel backtrack . 
  ~ ~ use imap , it 's better . ~ ~, 
  edit : i have misread / u/jumpiz comment . 
  i thought he as getting his gmail-mails to his pc / device via pop3 . 
  however , he is talking about getting the yahoo mail to gmail via pop3 . 
  for this use case pop3 is actually superior . 
  yea , i misread / u/jumpiz comment . 
  i thought he was talking about getting his mail from gmail to his devices . 
  is that balcony open to the public ? 
  wrong thread ? 
  even better , post your own ad in the newspaper . 
  the ` little old ladies ' , as well as the wealthy appartment owners that just want to have a renter in there and not have any hassle will prefer to contact you instead of having tons of ppl contact them . 
  that 's how i found 2 very nice appartments which i could decide between  . 
  vote trump for the better comedy show !, 
  oh , i bet he has a lot of material . 
  i think a hillary presidency would be very depressing to watch , whereas trump would probably make me laugh a lot more . 
  we had casio calculators , they had a reset button on the back . 
  before exams we had to turn them face down on our desk , and the teacher would walk through the lines , pressing that button on every calculator . 
  the problem was , when you then turned the calculator over , the display said `` are you sure you want to erase all memory ? 
  yes/no '' . 
  that reminds me , during a class at university the professor 's presentation was interrupted by a popup stating `` hot sex bomb 69 wants to connect with you '' , someone had changed their device name to that and tried to connect to his wifi or something ( idk , no clue about mac books ) . 
  the prof hit cancel and said `` maybe we should connect after the class . '', 
  i know someone that does that often . 
  you can hear it through teamspeak as well . 
  his gf reads his reddit probably . 
  i liked the `` spend your first 2 months salary on stuff you want , then start saving '' advice a lot more , 
  i 'm german , university was about 120 $ / semester , i have no student loans . 
  but i agree , if i had debt i would of course first try to repay that before spending money on other stuff . 
  the full of swabians is a benefit in my book , but even as a swabian i have to agree that i do n't really like stuttgart . 
  bachelor 's degree takes 6 or 7 semesters , depending on type of university . 
  we have universities and fachhochschulen ( university of applied sciences ) . 
  the latter are easier to get into and more focused on practica or lab activities , but the degrees are not as prestigious as university degrees . 
  i personally did my bachelor of engineering at a fachhochschule , then my master of science at a university . 
  our university courses are typically specialized , i studied electircal engineering , focused on digital signal processing and fpga/asic development . 
  however , the master 's programme also forces you to take a minimum of i believe 3 courses from any subject but the one you study . 
  those do not count towrads your grade , but you have to pass them . 
  i personally chose marketing basics , business administration basics and meteorology basics . 
  as for job outlook , electrical engineers are always in demand , especially if you have a degree from a respected university . 
  to be honest , i do n't know that much about the american education system . 
  do n't you study one subject at university ? 
  do you just have general classes ? 
  i think this is different here because our school system is different . 
  at grade 5 students here are separated based on performance into one of 3 different school types , called `` hauptschule '' , `` realschule '' and `` gymnasium '' . 
  only if you complete your gymnasium education are you directly eligible to go to a university . 
  students from other `` tiers '' can also attend a university , but only after completing different requirements , like learning a trade first . 
  the gymnasium takes 8 or 9 years , depending on which land ( german state ) you go to school in . 
  there you get a general education containing humanistic classes , history , geography , sports , sciences like chemistry and physics , maths , music and languages . 
  you can pick certain classes , but there is a minimum of stuff you need to take , like at least 2 foreign languages . 
  you typically complete your gymnasium education at 19 years old by completing the [ abitur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abitur ) examinations . 
  nearly the same for me , but with morrowind . 
  every time i see elder scrolls mentioned , i get those awesome morrowind memories of playing it hundrets of hours . 
  i 've tried going back to it a few times , but i never stuck with it for more than an hour at most . 
   i ordered some gravy and it came out to me in the plastic pouch with microwaving instructions on it . 
  i 'm german and i do n't know what cracker barrel really is , i assume it 's a restaurant . 
  how would you microwave your gravy at the table ? 
  i honestly do n't understand how my teacher did n't know this . 
  they had used that same calculator for years . 
  good story . 
  also , ' is the appostrophe mark , not \u00b4 . 
  i once had to retake a biology test on blood vessels because i was sick at exam day . 
  teacher put me in the back/storage room and set me up at some desk there . 
  i got the exam , she left the room . 
  i look around and lo and behold , right next to me on the wall is a giant poster of the human body with all blood vessels named and some explanations on the different types of blood vessels . 
  one of the easiest tests i ever took . 
  in the same vein , [ the bmw i8 looks like it 's shitting a porsche ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ ) . 
  she , and i think not , she kinda hated me . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ck9fozk?context=10000&amp;st=iu9hg0wf&amp;sh=46fc21cb ) .
