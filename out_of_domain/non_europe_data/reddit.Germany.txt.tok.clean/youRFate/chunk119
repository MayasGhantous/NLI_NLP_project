  bought in 2013 i think , still working fine . 
  never broke a screen , 1 battery replacement so far . 
  that 's because spark downloads your mail to their server and pushes a notification if there is new stuff . 
  wait , is n't that monthly ? 
   ~ ~ people usually love evga ~ ~, 
  reddit is a huge evga circlejerk, 
  ftfy, 
  i drink a lot of wine , but i also find that most australian wine is screw top . 
  but i also drink a lot of french , italian and argentinian wine , and all of those use corks . 
  i 'd say 80 % of the wine i drink has corks .

  you can find it for less that $ 50 on amazon . 
  use it every day . 
  beef !, 
  what field are you doing your degree in ? 
  unpaid internships suck . 
  what are you on about ? 
  it 's perfectly aligned with the lines ... 
  all the internships i did were paid , also stem .

  google does parse your mails as far as i know . 
  i 've since moved my communication to [ posteo ] ( https://posteo.de/en ) . 
  the way i see it , if you 're not paying for it then you 're the product . 
  i did n't say i invented that phrase . 
  i accept it as a good view . 
  did you maybe tell them you were a * fellow * somewhere ? 
  i have also lived in a studentenwerk dorm for a while . 
  you have wired ethernet in your room which you can connect a pc to . 
  you can however also connect a router and create your own wifi if you want that . 
  i live in germany , i have never needed one . 
  our toilets have larger diameter pipes , they just never clog . 
  my grandpa always said `` only poor or stupid people are ever cold '' when we kids complained about being cold after not wanting to put on a hat or something before leaving . 
  use dry ice . 
  on 5 day festivals a chef friend of ours brought 3 styrofoam boxes filled with meat and beer cans , then filled with dry ice . 
  even after 2 days it was all still frozen solid . 
  he hacked away a chunk of what 's in the box , usually consisting of a can of beer with one or two steaks frozen to it . 
  he would then put the whole thing on the grill until the steaks fall off the beer can . 
  the beer is usually in a drinkable state at that point . 
  teure touristenfalle . 
  i love mine . 
  i heard people say it 's actually better than the wacom tablets , because it has better colors and it reacts faster to the pencil input . 
  also a lot more portable , those wacom things are heavy . 
  i do n't like that spark pulls your emails to their servers , then analyzes them and sends you a notification . 
  i do n't want my email passwords etc to be on some 3rd party companies servers . 
  i 'm going to stick with default apple mail for now . 
  afaik there is none . 
  you did a good job imho . 
  spark still gets to read my mail . 
  wtf .

  germany here , you can do what you want in that regard . 
  mumbai , it 's an appartment . 
  also , as far as i know the us is the only place where there are codes for stuff like that . 
  here in germany only electrical and heating systems like chimneys need to comply with some sort of code if it 's your own residental building . 
  the rest , like stairs etc , is up to you . 
  afaik that does not apply if it 's your building which you live in . 
  if you do n't rent it out or use it commercially you 're free to do as you please .

  the flaps in the wheel fender liner . 
  but oh so ugly . 
  i vastly prefer the weller stations we use . 
  i had that app as well , primarily because my grandma 's living room was next to my room and she recently got a new panasonic tv . 
  she sometimes struggled with the remote and turn up the volume way too high . 
  i could use the app to turn it back down . 
  once i wanted to play a youtube video on the downstairs tv , but selected the wrong tv . 
  grandma was very confused . 
  in school , one of the art rooms had this massive [ etching press ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tldjgbe.jpg ) . 
  basically it 's a heavy metal roller and a steel table that moves at the same speed as the roller is turning . 
  this machine was used to flatted countless school lunches to varying thicknesses of 1 to 5 millimeters . 
  just filter it . 
  [ block this ] ( https://block-this.com/ ) works amazingly well . 
  i do n't remember if it works in youtube though . 
  it does work inside other apps . 
  wow that 's sleazy ... 
  i should carry my diploma everywhere and pull it out in every discussion about anything electronics . 
  i 'm sure that would be great ... 
  if you loved rtc as much as i did , then [ this project ] ( https://openrct2.org/ ) might interest you . 
  it 's an open-source reimplementation of rtc2 . 
  it has co-op multiplayer . 
  i have been playing it with a buddy for 2 evenings now and it 's fun , albeit still somewhat buggy . 
  you will need some files from the original rtc2 , however you can [ get that on gog for $ 10 ] ( https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2 ) . 
  same , rtc + loopy landscapes addon . 
  those were two of the most copied discs i had .
