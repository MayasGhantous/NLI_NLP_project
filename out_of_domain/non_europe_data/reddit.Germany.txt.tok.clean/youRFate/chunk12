  one more question : when i looked at the base of my board i noticed 2 small `` defects '' , should i contact my shop and get it replaced or is it no big deal ? 
  [ defect 1 ] ( http://i.minus.com/iamhml6dxmp3i.jpg ) , [ different pic ] ( http://i.minus.com/ibet9ukp1vgkgj.jpg ), 
  [ defect 2 ] ( http://i3.minus.com/ihw4mgikitsy3.jpg ), 
  [ location of defect 1 ] ( http://i.minus.com/ibbs4iu23ktwav.jpg ), 
  defect 1 looks like it goes all the way through the clear p tex , but you ca n't feel it on the surface , defect 2 is only a small scratch . 
  luckily i do n't need planes to go boarding since in the middle of the alps in about 3 hours by car  . 
  i mount the board on top of my car in a snowboard bag . 
  someone already put it in here [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mckayla_maroney ) . 
  is it too cold ? 
  i do n't think 18 \u00b0 c would be low ... 
  our basement is n't moist , in fact , the room where the snowbards and skis are stored is part of the room used for drying firewood . 
  how does it compare to raspbmc ? 
  i 'd order http://adafruit.com/products/859 if i lived in the us , but i do n't want to pay international shipping . 
  depends on how `` get some eggs '' is designed to handle the absence of eggs . 
  the condition `` while you 're out there '' is not changed by the absence of eggs . 
  never heard that one , i like it , 
  they did , sort of . 
  leather gloves with chain-mail on the outside of the glove , since the inside is around the sword hilt anyway . 
  that way it does not interfere with gripping . 
  my best guess would be the [ reschensee ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/reschensee-panorama.jpg ) . 
  1080 beer cans , that would be $ 270 ( ~ $ 344 ) in [ bottle deposit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/container_deposit_legislation#germany ) here in germany . 
  yes , someone who spells `` mademoiselle '' as `` mademosel '' should not be trusted with providing fine fragrances . 
  but touchscreens rock with dry hands , 
  next time check steam rep first . 
  also keep trading stuff in the / r/dota2trade subreddit please .

  would n't latex be more viable than any wysiwyg editor if the document is really complex ? 
  found another one !, 
  i was n't talking about spreadsheets , you probably know that latex is not suited to do calculations at all , but it is a wonderful replacement for word . 
  if you know how to use it and have a good set of templates you will achieve perfect documents in a fraction of the time it would take you in word .

  are you german by any chance ? 
  my newsfeed is flooded with some stupid image of text that has about 10 spelling errors in 20 lines and every line ends with '' ... ! '' . 
  even some people which i usually do n't view as stupid fell for that one ... 
  i usually have a `` hardware '' , a `` software '' , a `` materials '' and a `` documetation '' folder . 
  the software folder has subfolders for the different mcus / fpgas / dsps on the project . 
  software and hardware folders each have their own local git repo , which solves the versioning and i use branches for different variants / experiments . 
  this way one git version snapshot on the master branch contains one fully working and tested software version for all programmable devices that works ( or should work  . 
  i usually also add the version of the hardware folder which this software folder version should work with in the commit message . 
  yes !, 
  that 's the one i was talking about . 
  i thought it had more spelling errors , though . 
  maybe it 's some really concentrated salty or mineral / sulfuric water where bacteria that eats corpses does not thrive . 
  a dead sheep without any blood / gore does not qualify as nsfl . 
  that is just about the least i would settle for in that situation . 
  sure about needing air ? 
  how would fishes rot then ? 
  but the bird thing sounds logical . 
  is it a mechanical keyboard or a `` normal '' one ? 
  on a normal keyboard you can just pull the keycap out , on a mechanical you should use a improvised keycap puller so you pull it straight , because otherwise you can damage your key switches . 
  blue switches , no macros , usb ports ? 
  [ daskeyboard ] , ( http://www.daskeyboard.com/ ) features all of those . 
  you can also order in in unprinted black keys , no white though . 
  if you use mx blues people will hear the sound of it , especially in skype where you ca n't set a voice activation threshold . 
  on teamspeak / mumble you can set the voice activation so that it does not activate if you only type , people will then only hear the keyboard if you type while you talk . 
  what 's wrong with that city ? 
  i 've just looked a the wikipedia page and it looks ok to me ? 
  from reading the other posts i 've gathered that you have a backlit mechanical keyboard . 
  those are most likely pcb mounted , that means you need to undersold the switches . 
  to do that you will need to disassemble the keyboard to get to the pcb from the backside . 
  then you will need to unsolder the 2 pins of the switch ( es ) you want to replace . 
  you usually do n't need to remove any leds or bridge wires . 
  then just solder the new switch in place . 
  i do n't know if you have any experience in soldering , but tutoraials on how to desolder through-hole components should be easy to find and it really is n't hard . 
  you will need a soldering iron , solder wick and/or a solder pump , solder flux and solder wire ( use flux-core wire and do n't buy lead free ) . 
  tutorials on how to disassemble your keyboard should also be easy to find . 
  if not just look for screws and remove all you can find . 
  they are usually hidden underneath rubber feet and model stickers . 
  are you using an nvidia card ? 
  try updating to the newly released beta drivers . 
  you are in a closed room with 3 lightswitches . 
  in the next room there is a lightbulb . 
  the goal is to find out which switch controls the bulb . 
  you may switch as many times as you like , but once you open the door to the room with the lightbulb you are not allowed to use the switches anymore . 
  all switches start out in the `` off '' position . 
  [ you switch on switch # 1 for about 10 minutes , then switch if off , switch on # 2 , open the door and examine the bulb :, 
  if it 's on , then # 2 is correct . 
  if it 's off and hot , then # 1 is the answer . 
  if it 's off and cold , then it was switch # 3 .

  thanks for the insight and happy cakeday . 
  no , those keyboards mostly are only pcb mounted , without the plate . 
  if you want to try this you should do it in the warpgate dome , since you get less damage there . 
  not in germany ... 
  i love how the grey car has the driver 's window open ... 
  oh , the blackwidow is plate mounted ? 
  i read somewhere that all back lit keyboards would be pcb mounted and i just believed it . 
  that is something that would take long to write here , any many people have explained it before .

  wow , his uniform was designed by [ atticus clothing ] ( http://www.atticusclothing.com/ ) . 
  one of the best places i have ever snowboarded at , 
  are you sure there is an edge on this ? 
  it might just be rough-cut into shape . 
  if you are in an office , do n't get the mx blues . 
  they will notice and they will probably be annoyed . 
  i just got my daskeyboard with mx blues and that thing is loud . 
  i also typed a lot on this keyboard , but so did i on my old one .
