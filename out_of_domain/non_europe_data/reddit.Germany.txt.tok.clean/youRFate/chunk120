  that , warcraft 3 and aoe ii . 
  you will need to get that certified if you do n't already have a valid certificate . 
  go to [ globetrotter at isartor ] ( https://www.globetrotter.de/filialen/muenchen/ ) . 
  they will give you the right kind of stuff for your shoes . 
  other than that , the timberland store near marienplatz also has the timberland leather care products . 
  die will was ?!, 
  meh , google maps does just fine . 
  kinda like the nexus 5 had , but not plastic-y . 
  being yelled at by a teacher that was mad over something incredibly minor has often made me crack up . 
  that has never ended well ... 
  the countless hours i 've played caesar 3 ... 
  alles cool . 
  that is the worst meat skewer i 've ever seen , wat . 
  if you dislike him , insist on him paying you the intrest on the kaution . 
  law mandates he keeps your kaution in an interst-paying investment , and he must give you your money back + any intrest generated . 
  it totally will , trust me . 
  if the race was longer or had any corners the 918 would have destroyed it . 
  logistics, 
  is that grille completely closed off ? 
  ah , my diesel has something like that as well , but it 's behind the actual `` grille '' . 
  like it . 
  i use mine with the apple smart keyboard , and when i put it down on the table i make sure not to put it on it 's back , so it does n't scratch . 
  for carrying it around i bought a felt sleeve [ like thise one ] ( https://www.amazon.com/inateck-13-13-3-ultrabook-carrying-protector/dp/b01d0vm2l0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1487405403&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=ipad+pro+felt+case ) . 
  i think the ipad pro feels amazing without a case and i do n't want to spoil that . 
  for example when i 'm on the couch reading comics on it i will use it without any case . 
  however , i do n't carry my ipad around outside often , it mostly stays in my home , i will only take it with me on longer trips . 
  if i carried it for example every day to work or university i would probably think about getting a back case . 
  maybe it has something to do with the longitudinal g of nearly 40 . 
  and yes , i did close it and let it do a full test run , did not change the values . 
  i even changed a tiny bit of track and had it test again , same results . 
  i should have a look at the g-force graphs to find that . 
  will do tomorrow maybe . 
  i did submit the savegame to the devs though . 
  right , my 60 % raises lots of questions already . 
  next step will probably an unlabled ergodox ... 
  same , mit [ moderncv timeline ] ( https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/moderncv-with-modern-timeline/prmmmvtvfxsn ) . 
  that is likely where the gangway is going to end . 
  this gate enables you to lock that and stop people from going on the ship that 's moored there ... 
  ofc not , the gangway is farther up than the waterlevel . 
  imagine something like [ this ] ( http://metallicladder.com/files/gangway_2.jpg ) , just longer and from a tourist boat . 
  meh , not really that expensive , original idea , cool item to have if you are a fan of the brand . 
  do n't see that much wrong with it . 
   deja vu , i 've just been in this place before, 
   higher on the street , and i know it 's my time to go, 
   calling you , and the search is a mystery, 
   standing on my feet , it 's so hard when i try to be me , woah, 
  my personal ranking of those cities :, 
  purely by if i 'd want to live there or not . 
  they even went the extra mile and purposely disabled the picture-in-picture feature ios has for all video apps . 
  it 's built into ios ' video rendering api . 
  google probably did n't want youtube to have a feature on ios that was n't possible on android . 
  because the 7700k eats amd alive in like every game ever ? 
  since the pixel phones are now about as expensive as iphones , i 'm going to give those a try , probably going to get a 7 + . 
  imho nicht normal . 
  sahne trinken = diabeetus monster habbit . 
  i would use my car . 
  best wishes ,, 
  when the farmer turned up i thought he was going to be mad at the trespassers , turns out he 's a nice guy , his wive even walking home so police can transport the 2 lost women ... 
  my 2007 bmw does that . 
  my 2000 merc did that . 
  i assumed every car did ... 
  it 's easy , have disposable income and love gaming . 
  i 've had a shitty pc all throughout university , i 've sworn to myself that that wo n't ever happen again ... 
  ... which is a good thing . 
  this so much . 
  as a lover of wc3 dota , i was hyped to the roof when valve announced dota2 . 
  and oh boy did they deliver . 
   forgot a textbook, 
  wait , they charge you if you do n't bring your books ? 
  very mini metro-esque . 
  case would not have been my first choice , but it 's your machine . 
  have fun with it !, 
  aaah , right . 
  running ` dig nas ` on arch returns the correct ip , but ` ping nas ` returns ` ping : nas : name or service not known ` . 
  fixed it , see post edit . 
  battlefield 1 . 
  code for : `` i 'm insecure with where i am in life and you look like you make more money than i do . '', 
  full flextime , i can come and go when i want in the 6 am . 
  to 8 pm . 
  window . 
  typically i will arrive some time between 8 and 10 am . 
  being able to just roll over in bed if you do n't feel like getting up already is great . 
  that is because it 's all dry white wine ... 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  of course it is . 
  siemens is like german ge . 
  basically some guy rants at the berlin transport company that he had to wait over an hour for a tram to arrive at rathaus sch\u00f6neberg . 
  the comany replies that that is actually an astoundingly short time , given the fact that there is no tram line there . 
  the only `` ya boi '' is asmongold . 
  those are probably for the wii mote . 
  on the topic of icloud drive , do you guys do backups in there ? 
  that seems to me like the ammount of space the requires would be quite expensive monthly ...

  depends on what kind of degree you have , but 40k sounds low imho . 
  `` let me just block the camera lens with my finger while the interesting bit happens '' . 
  afaik you need to have a lvl 55 character first before you can create a death knight . 
  at least that 's how it used to be . 
  depends .
