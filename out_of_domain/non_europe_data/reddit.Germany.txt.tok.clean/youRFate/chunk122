  reichelt and conrand have some stuff . 
  microcrontrollers , espeically cheap small suff like ftdi usb serial controllers and stuff like that i usually order off of aliexpress . 
  the truely great days of f1 were before the big reulations set in , so like until 1986 . 
  massive v10 engines with mental turbo setups producing up to 1350hp . 
  lotus even experimented using turbine engines etc. 
  i know it 's dangerous etc , but i really want a truly unregulated racing category , maybe give maximum size and weight and say it needs to be on the ground or something like that , but beyond that give the teams total freedom . 
  maybe even make them remote controlled or something . 
  which mod makes wipeout loadouts modular ? 
  ooooh , fancy . 
  got ta try that . 
  i have seen another post by that guy recenly , and they were only mildly interesting at best . 
  this is beyond fishy ... 
  i bet this is one of ops upvote alts , look at the history ... 
  edit : called it . 
  / u/datenginedoe looks like it 's one of his slave accounts , look at the history , like 10 posts , and several of those on puzzle vids of op ... 
  because the video is pretty meh imho . 
  i assumed it would be really interesting , being that far up , but it was kinda disappointing . 
  with a name like `` gyro puzzle '' i assumed you would have to do something cool like wrap a string around it and spin it really fast to unlock something inside , but no , you merely have to push on one of the things protruding from it ... 
  oh , damage control ... 
  with razer 's recent problems where keyboards and mice do n't work when their servers are down , you are not even that far off ... 
  where do you work with people with phds that does n't have a flextime system ? 
  we clock in / out when we come / go , and it tracks our hours . 
  if we work more than hour contracted hours we get overtime credit , if we work less it gets subtracted from our overtime hours . 
  you can come / leave anytime you want within 6am to 8pm and work pretty much as long as you want , as long as at the end of the month your overtime is n't that far negative . 
  i personally will typically work about 15 min to half an hour longer than i need to on regular days , so i have enough hours saved up to just take a day off spontneously if something comes up without having to use vacation days . 
  house of leaves much ... 
  this is a typical swabian sunday meal . 
  the beef is dry aged simmental beef , seared for about a minute on each side , then wraped in foil with some rosemary and put into an 80 \u00b0 c oven while i prepared the gravy in the same pan by first roasting some onions in there , then delgazing with red wine . 
  the gravy is further enhanced with some coarse mustard . 
  sp\u00e4tzle are in my opinion the best side dish ever invented . 
  they are a type of southern german egg pasta , which are in this case also home made . 
  the dough consists of roughly 1.5 eggs per person , flavored with salt and nutmeg , then kneaded with coarse-grained wheat flour ( you can substitute a mix of regular wheat flour mixed with semolina ) . 
  the finished product is then put into shape using one of various techniques : the traditional method is scraping a thin layer of dough off of a wooden board into boiling salted water , that is however a bit tedious . 
  other than that you can use [ a press ] ( http://www.loewen-urbach.de/swabian_spaetzle_maker.html ) or as i did [ a special type of grater ] ( http://www.wmf.com/en/spaetzle-profi-0608306040.html ) . 
  forgive the rushed photos and presentation , i was in a rush to get this into my stomach  . 
  or even cooler , when counting out , dim the lights and project the count down onto the arena floor in red , next to the robot . 
  noooo , it 's a triangle shaped personal financial growth opportunity !, 
  hint : if some form of job or financial investment opportunity has `` information sessions '' or any other active marketing towards you , somebody else is making the money with it .

  congratulations and condolences at the same time are in order ... 
  you do know about / r/mechanicalheadpens right ? 
  wine . 
  have you seen the pictures over at r/wine of people 's massive wine cellars ? 
  holy shit . 
  lol, 
  why do n't the teams make the axes sharp and narrow , so they pierce , like shunt 's axe ... 
   super nice car, 
  lol, 
  in that case a hammer would be better than an axe , more weight at the end . 
  in that case a wedge shaped weapon might be better . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that probably a heavier end would maybe make axe type weapons have more impact than they do right now . 
  as far as i can tell for a views perspective they seem to do next to nothing . 
  only thing i do n't like about it is that it has chapter support only on ios , not on android or the web player . 
  oh finally !, 
  you are never safe from bootstrap problems ...

  joey 's , a german pizza chain that recently got bought by domino 's , has a `` salami supreme '' pizza , which is a pepperoni pizza completely covered in it . 
  that is glorious but incredibly greasy from all the grease that comes out of the salami ( pepperoni for you americans ) . 
  i have not found a better hangover cure yet ... 
  m e t a c y c l e, 
  some podcasts i listen to now switched to reaper with ultraschall , which is a plugin / total overhaul specifically made for podcast editing . 
  however , i think it 's still not 100 % o internationalized and some parts are german-only so far . 
  reaper is n't , however , [ ultraschall ] ( https://github.com/ultraschall/reaper ) is . 
  it was literally the first legendary that dropped when i hit 70 in a rift . 
  so it does drop . 
  i know this does n't help ... 
  which other ring should i run ? 
  zuni or rorg ? 
  how do you most efficiently powerlevel someone ? 
  i play a wd and hit 70 yesterday , working on zuni set . 
  might have a buddy join into the fun next week . 
  how would i get him to lvl 70 the fastest ? 
  oh he does n't even need to be close to me ? 
  nice . 
  where did you get that portrait frame ? 
  edit : nvm googled it . 
  12.9 '' i hope . 
  in other news , i should visit an art gallery next weekend ... 
   i fucking love that project , so much creativeness , like some ~ ~ people ~ ~ bots `` drew '' van gogh 's painting , so cool, 
  ftfy, 
  most complex / pixel perfect stuff is made by bots that use lots of accounts . 
  right , making one myself was actually one of my first thoughts when i read about r/place , but then i remembered that the new diablo iii season started ... 
  thanks , but i think that should work out . 
  wear it to whimsydale and get enough socket stones for the entire season in one go . 
  [ why not both ] ( http://www.diablofans.com/builds/88831-zunitooth-zoo-build ) ? 
  that build looks cool imho , i 'm working towards it right now . 
  once i finally get a rorg i can equipe helltooth set components , i already have them stashed ... 
  i think this hybrid build has a lot of potential : http://www.diablofans.com/builds/88831-zunitooth-zoo-build, 
  should have removed the blue from the union jack for this one ... 
  from my experience , both spirit walk and soul harvest : languish are essential . 
  soul harvest : languish in combination with the sacred harvester and lakumba 's ornament is what provides a big chunk of this build 's survivability . 
  wtf , is it really common to knock on doors even if doorbells are present ? 
  nobody ever knocks on doors here , every house has bells ... 
  nachdem ich mir den [ 33c3 talk zum thema n26 ] ( https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-7969-shut_up_and_take_my_money ) angeschaut habe , kommt n26 f\u00fcr mich eher nicht mehr in frage . 
  that very much depends . 
  for example at bakeries the often hold out their hand for the money . 
  come to think of it , i have n't put money onto one of those dishes in like forever ... 
  i love this tune . 
  first heard it on hospital : we are 18 , i think .
