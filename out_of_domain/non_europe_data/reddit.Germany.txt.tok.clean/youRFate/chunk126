  bmw m4 convertible . 
  looks good , is fast , will get you girls . 
  targeting pod ? 
  oh wow i really do need to look into this update more . 
  do n't buy ships because of stats or something , buy a ship you like . 
  if you like the look of the kore ( it 's really cool ) buy that one !, 
  just buy the phone from apple , not your carrier , and you wo n't have bloatware ... 
  right , ios default apps . 
  i thought you meant carrier apps . 
  do a flip !, 
  this strut circlejerk is getting ridiculous ... 
  every ship that 's not a perfect sphere of glass will be criticised . 
  love your music !, 
  did n't know you 're here on reddit as well . 
  thank you !, 
  especially in a trading or exploration ship . 
  i can understand it on a fighter . 
  : / / / i want to fly my new cutlass now pls ... 
  try their [ wunderstation ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderstation-weather-from-your-neighborhood/id906099986?mt=8 ) app , i love it and it 's what i check the weather on every morning on my ipad, 
  i 'm using pocket casts because of the web player . 
  i can play podcasts on any pc and it 's synced with my progress on my ios and android devices . 
  honestly , the official ios podcast app is also decent . 
  google drive does , too . 
  i 'm looking into getting my first proper camera and for some reason i think nikon will be my choice . 
  i do n't really know what kind of photography i want to do yet , and realistically this camera will mostly be used on holidays . 
  my current plan is to get a d7200 , but i 'm still thinking about what lenses i want . 
  is the af-s dx nikkor 18-140 mm 1:3,5 -5,6 g ed vr kit lens actually something i as a beginner might put to good use or should i save that money and buy something else instead ? 
  from talking to friends / reading online i think that one of my first purchases would be a af-s dx nikkor 35mm 1:1,8 g , for the greater low light performance . 
  later on if i indeed use the camera and have fun with it i think i 'll get a 70-200 f2 .8 of some description . 
  now you may all tell me why it 's a bad idea  . 
   great choice of body, 
  i set myself a limit of about 1000 $ for the body . 
  the d7200 lies just shy of that . 
  i thought about the d7500 as well , but it 's nearly 50 % more expensive and the added features seem not worth the extra money for me . 
  as for the bundled lens , there is another kit available which comes with af-s dx nikkor 18-105 mm 1:3,5 -5,6 g ed vr , but i think the 18-140 seems like a straight upgrade to that and the price difference is neglible . 
  right , i will go with the kit for now , if i 'm at all into this i 'll probably get a tamron 40-200 f2 .8 next , wich is more than the body is that i 'm planing on buying . 
  thing is , i get the nikon lens a lot cheaper if i buy it in the bundle , i 'll only pay bout 120 $ for the 18-140mm , compared to abut 300 for the sigma . 
  i think in this case i 'll get the 18-140 first , and then later add on a prime , somewhere in the 30-50mm range , with f1 .4 or 1.8 or something . 
  expanding on [ my earlier question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nikon/comments/6cmg4l/weekly_rnikon_discussion_thread_have_a_question/dhvqnra/ ) about the camera itself , what other stuff should i buy immediately with my camera ? 
  based on what i 've read i think i need the following stuff :, 
  * sd cards ( probably 2x 64gb ), 
  * camera bag that fits a few additional lenses, 
  * nikon lens cleaning kit + giottos air rocket, 
  now what i 'm not so sure on :, 
  ** additional battery ** : i think an additional battery would be nice to use while the other is charging . 
  ** tripod ** : that is something i 'll buy later on probably , not necessary immediately . 
  ** lens hood / filter ** : i 'm reading conflicting stuff , some say it 's necessary , others say it 's more of a protection thing with not much true benefit . 
  is there anything i 'm missing that i would need to get startet ? 
  i was planing on having the 2 sd cards in backup mode , where everything is written to both cards . 
  more like `` dude '' . 
  was there oil on the track ? 
  bats are the best , they eat mosquitoes by the pound . 
  i 'd much rather have them than any kind of stingy insect ... 
  could be imported . 
  i 've seen the fuji instax printer recommended several times . 
  here is a clip of paul sanders talking about how it 's one of his favorite pieces of kit in his bag :, 
  oh , sorry , i missed the dimensions :d . 
  oh , did n't know that . 
  i thought all those people doing euro delivery were importing them . 
  i 'm from germany , so i do n't really know how that works over there :d . 
  also , buy a better tripod :p, 
  planning on getting one of those . 
  is the laptop area padded on all sides ? 
  i plan on carrying my 12.9 '' ipad pro in there . 
  from what i 've seen it should be high enough to carry a 70-200 f/2 .8 , right ? 
  i 'm about to buy a d7200 , and the lack of an articulated screen is basically the only thing i do n't like about that body . 
  the d7500 has an articulated scree , but it 's about 50 % more expensive and in some areas actually worse than the d7200 , so i do n't really consider buying that one instead ... 
   now , do n't get the idea that i know what i 'm doing - i do n't - but i 'm having fun and making money . 
  that is true for a lot more people in a lot more industries that you can or even want to image ... 
  thank you for that information !, 
  i have looked around and found out , that the newly announced hadley one will feature a fully padded laptop compartment . 
  it will also be slightly larger . 
  however , it 's about another 100 $ more expensive than the pro , so i might pass on that upgrade ... 
  that 's me after every lan-party we ever had . 
  2-3 days of basically non-stop gaming , then sleep for a day , wake up at some point and go figure out what time and what day it is . 
  something similar happened to me with an oral exam in one class . 
  the prof emailed us the exam times , but i forgot to put it in my calendar and forgot about that exam entirely . 
  i realized it at like 8 pm the day i was scheduled to take the exam , about 4 hours after my timeslot . 
  i emailed the prof and apology email , in which i did n't ask to retake it , i only apologized for wasting his time . 
  he replied that i could have a timeslot at the end of the exam period , 3 days later . 
  that was perfect as i also had n't even started learning for it . 
  i 'm german and we have something similar . 
  it 's basically registration . 
  you have to pay the semester fee and register to study each semester , if you miss that you have a severe problem . 
  typically the faculty will email you several times before the deadline if you did n't already register , so it 's kinda hard to mess up . 
  hnnnnnng jaaa !, 
  btw , kauf das : http://www.benjerry.de/sorten/salted-caramel-brownie-topped, 
  best thing about that line is that he apparently improvised it on the spot . 
  scohovfefe ? 
  digitalrevtv has a video that touches on that , it can be fairly easy , especially if you record with the camera 's built-in mic as well , then you can easily see the waveforms and line them up perfectly . 
  some software can even do that automatically for you . 
  just ordered a d7200 , plan on getting a 70-200 at some point , if i really do use the camera as much as i think i might . 
  the only correct answer . 
  if you were to expand this to 3 toppings , i 'd add garlic . 
  for a 4th i 'd add onions . 
  got a pair of timberland icon chukkas as my new `` bad weather '' shoes . 
  love them . 
  right , but your store knows which state it 's in ... 
  unless there are multiple cash registers that happen to be in different states that is no excuse at all . 
   lack of carbonated water .
