  naja , [ posteo hat ja auch die email-addresse aus dem verkehr genommen , die da als kontaktinfo angegeben ist ] ( https://posteo.de/en/blog/info-on-the-petrwrappetya-ransomware-email-account-in-question-already-blocked-since-midday ) . 
  this is kinda bad protection actually . 
  the stuff in there can easily bump the top and get damaged . 
  any camera bag would be better ... 
  also , you might want to keep your warranty cards at home , safely . 
  e\u1e9ezettologe, 
  also still rocking my n5 . 
  waiting for the iphone 8 though . 
  have a look at our [ wiki article on that subject ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) . 
   60k after tax will probably be 45k, 
  25 % taxes ? 
  hnnng i wish it was that low for me ... 
  i guess most people here just do n't use a `` protector '' in there , as the hot shoe is very sturdy , right ? 
  my d7200 did n't even come with one ... 
  however , it did come with a viewfinder cap to prevent light entering there , which i 've not even removed from the packaging yet ... 
  oo , wo n't the mirrors block the light anyways ? 
  ok , good to know . 
  i 'll put that thing in my camera bag into the `` assorted random stuff '' pouch . 
  it 's a nikon dk-5 eyepiece cap , it has a clip on one side to attach it somewhere . 
  but i 've upgraded to a peak design slide strap and i do n't want to attach it to that . 
  i think i 'd probably only need it when using a tripod , so i 'd include it somewhere in the carrying case of the tripod instead , once i buy one . 
  for now it 'll be safe inside the camera bag . 
  wow those colors are really cool . 
  how was this done ? 
  i have one and i like it so far , especially the flexibility you get from having those anchor point thingys , so you could have 2 on your body , and 2 on the 70-200 . 
  if you plan on buying the peak design , be aware that the orange/red version is a lot more vibrant and shiny in reality than the website makes it out to be . 
  i still like it , but the more flat , muted look on the website would suit me a lot better than the kinda metallic , reflective look it has in reality . 
  it 's not bothering me enough to exchange it , but knowing what i know now i 'd go for the black version . 
  also , i 'm not a subreddit :p, 
  be aware that imho the colours differ a bit from how they look on the website , see [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/6kfqog/lens_switches_keep_getting_accidentally_toggled/djlozwe/?st=j4jxnz0d&amp;sh=b59a6859 ) . 
  i 'm wondering why he did n't use dowel joints there ... 
  you totally can . 
  got told that as well once , a class that was considered hard , final exam , i ` m sitting in front of the exam hall , reading a book . 
  all the other people there were reading class notes in panic . 
  did pretty good . 
  thing is , i see girls on the street from time to time whom i would tell that , but not knowing them it would be creepy . 
  there are probably a lot more people who think that , but they just do n`t tell you . 
  also , easy exposure compensation set to auto reset . 
  love this . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  that made no sense at all ... 
  you should be able to do this no problem . 
  you might want to slightly overexpose the film , so set the digital camera ` s exposure compensation to +1 / 3 stop or something . 
  have fun !, 
  install any extension that allows you to swtich your browser ` s user agent . 
  set that user agent to ipad or some other mobile device . 
  now you can upload directly from your pc . 
  did you actually focus on her face ? 
  with a dof as thin as what that lens provides at f/1 .8 you have to focus on the face specifically , not just anywhere on the person . 
  that would not change the dof , but if the change in angle is large enough the the focal plane move behind / inside the subject . 
  for best results i ` d move the af point to her face . 
  i know how back button focus works and i use it . 
  the problem op has is not that he 's in the wrong af mode , it 's that he did n't unbind af-on from the shutter button half press , so he now has 2 af buttons . 
  that way , the camera will auto focus every time he half presses the shutter , no matter what he does with the back button . 
  to fix that he needs to go into the auto focus settins and disable shutter button af-on . 
  shutter priority is s mode , which has nothing to do with auto focus , it 's a setting you activate on the mode dial that assigns the command wheel to shutter speed , and the camera will balance aperture and ( if you want ) iso to achieve the desired exposure while using the shutter speed you selected . 
  being able to take a photograph while not in focus in af-s mode is a separate setting in the auto focus menu of the camera . 
  i do however agree , that af-c is the best mode to use when using back button focus . 
  if you 're using chrome , install [ this addon ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg ) . 
  then click the icon and select ios -  ipad . 
  that makes websites think you are browsing them from an ipad , and instagram will then let up upload pictures right there in the browser . 
  to get the normal webpages back select chrome -  default . 
  for firefox there are similar add-ons , for example [ this one ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher-firefox/ ) , have n't tried that yet , though . 
  i have 2 git repositories , one for the addons folder , one for the wtf folder , which i commit everything into once in a while , especially before large upgrades . 
  if i use an af-d ( or ai-s ) lens on my d7200 , can i , in a mode , use the aperture ring on the lens to set the aperture ? 
  or do i have to lock the lens to minimum aperture and set it through the camera ? 
  kind of a different question , but i just started playing again after some haitus . 
  last time i really played was during mythic progress in emerald nightmare , played destro then . 
  now i kinda want to get back into the game , but i do n't really want to lock myself into a 3 days a week raid schedule again , so i think i 'll go for a more casual approach , doing dungeons / mythic + . 
  for that , affliction is the way to go still right ? 
  what 's the best way to catch up on gear now ? 
  armory : https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eredar/baelsan, 
  right , but i kinda prefer affliction and am glad that it 's now viable , so i want to go that route . 
  to be fair , barking dogs are annoying as hell and i 'm glad there are strict laws about that here ... 
  got to hirmer and buy a bunch of olmyp shirts . 
  they will last . 
  dof not only depends on the aperture , but it also depends on focal length and the focal distance . 
  low focal length , which wide angle lenses have , increases the dof . 
  as you focus quite a bit into the scene , the focal distance is fairly large , also increasing the dof . 
  to find the ideal setting , research hyperfocal distance . 
  additionally , faster aperture lenses stopped down to the same setting as a slower lens thend to be shaper . 
  have fun with your new camera !, 
  i was incredibly sad when they got that one counter goal . 
  the humiliation would have been so much more perfect if they had n't gotten that . 
  i normally do n't watch football , but some friends got me to watch that , we went to one of the beer halls here in munich . 
  the atmosphere was incredible . 
  they are more restaurants than bars , typically with at least one large hall that seats a few hundred people . 
  however , they typically have smaller menus more focused on typical beergarden food . 
  fuck off , lol . 
  good on you for finding some consolation in that match at least ^ ^ . 
  very nice analogy . 
  that makes it feel a bit better , you 're right . 
   documentary, 
  german reality tv , 99 % staged ... 
  ah yes , pounding train rails with hammers , as is tradition . 
  the main difference is , that by adding [ help,nodead][@player] it will , if you have no mouseover target , try to heal the target . 
  if that is dead or an enemy , it will heal yourself instead . 
   airnef, 
  looks interesting . 
  can i get my d7200 to join my home wifi instead of having to connect to the camera 's wifi in order to download the pictures ?
