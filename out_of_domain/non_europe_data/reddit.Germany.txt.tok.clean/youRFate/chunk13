  i do n't feel any pain in my wrists ( i 'm not using a wrist rest at the moment , might look into buying one . ) . 
  if you want to get a new keyboard for at home , get the mx blue version , i love the loud typing sound . 
  i suppose the key on top does nothing ? 
  how do i figure out which kind of stabilizers i have ? 
  new mechanical typer checking in  . 
  das keyboard prof. s ( mx blue ) and i mostly wear vans of any kind . 
  i 'd call them rather conservative , since i 'm not wearing brightly colored / picture printed ones . 
  mechanical keyboard irc : the loudest chat room around . 
  your friend is aware that he will need a custom made pcb for this mod ? 
  thanks , sweet keyboard . 
  what 's an fcc id and why do you need it ? 
  i have a professional model s. 
  i 'll have a look in the `` manual '' ( 2 pages telling you how to plug it in ) tomorrow . 
  i probably wo n't open the keyboard though . 
  i have the mediakey version which is supposedly manufactured by ione in china ( maybe not though , since i have the iso layout german version ) . 
  yes , i read that drama about the ione manufacturer and the response from the rep , that 's why i wrote supposedly . 
  i 'll try to find out more tomorrow , since i 'm not currently on the pc with the das keyboard . 
  edit : meant to write allegedly , thought the words were the same . 
  i found no fcc id , but i found some information on the [ fcc page ] ( http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/help.html ) : the keyboard bears [ this logo ] ( http://i.minus.com/iftm8qjqbpnmb.gif ) on the back , therefore it 's not in the fcc database :, 
   equipment displaying this label would not be in this database . 
  the fcc would not have any record of this equipment . 
  it is declared to comply with fcc regulations by the manufacturer or importer . 
  oo the slide is called `` x-treme faser '' , that is n't german and does not mean `` douche rocket '' . 
  edit : wow , the woosh is strong in this one ... 
  the waxjob on my nitro was ok , but i heard the wax that they ship with is mainly for storing and so that the base does not dry out , not ideal for riding . 
  i just waxed my first sintered base today ( new nitro thief board ) . 
  it really feels different , the base feels totally smooth and you 'd think it ca n't hold any wax at all , but it took a good amount  . 
  i 'm actually think about waxing it again just before going on my trip next week , just for kicks . 
  that 's why my new one is gon na get a bumper . 
  switch to farnell . 
  or push enemies on cliffs / past you . 
  that depends on the type of bread , i 've conducted some testing on this subject myself . 
  would i be legally fine hosting all those third-party . el files on my github ? 
  i never look at the `` menu '' at cocktail bars , i just order what i want and expect the bar to have it . 
  i liked gangnam styl before the video was on youtube . 
  reading a funny comment and then stealing it for a post on his own ? 
  that 's a new level of op faggotry . 
  is that license plate legal ? 
  i ca n't read it from this angle and i think you should be able to ... 
  get an evaluation board with gpios , you can connect those to a breadboard easily . 
  i own a [ terasic de0 ] ( http://www.altera.com/education/univ/materials/boards/de0/unv-de0-board.html ) board and i 'm really happy with it , the altera cyclone iii on it is enough for pretty much any entry level project . 
  if you want more i 'd recommend for example the terasic de2 , because it features ethernet and audio interfaces . 
  there are also boards with higher performance fpgas that feature more les/slices and higher clock rates , but if you are just starting out , which i assume here , then you wo n't need that yet . 
  if you want something really cool get a [ xilinx zc702 ] ( http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc702-g.htm ) which have a xilinx zynq soc . 
  zynq socs feature a powerful fpga fabric and have a dual-core arm cortex a9 directly on-chip . 
  ca n't you just look for that using your workplace 's version control system ? 
  should be easier to look through his diffs from the last month or so that every piece of code had access to . 
  by stephen hawking himself . 
  i like your board . 
  why not just guild the sand/gravel door , if you have plenty space downward ? 
  yay for emacs hanoi mode . 
  that snow does n't look like snow . 
  nkro on my das keyboard professional s via ps/2 . 
  does n't corsair usually have ridiculously long warranty ? 
  you could probably get it replaced . 
  possible he just photoshopped it before he uploaded it ? 
  does n't that mark your game as modified , though ? 
  a pretty good balance between cost and io/peripherials is the [ altera de0 ] ( http://www.altera.com/education/univ/materials/boards/de0/unv-de0-board.html ) , which you can get pretty cheaply ( $ 79 for academic customers ) . 
  i got mine for 50 $ because my university order a whole crate . 
  you should state what operation system you are on . 
  on windows i use [ mingw ] ( http://www.mingw.org/ ) . 
  the other big alternative is the [ cygwin ] ( http://www.cygwin.com/ ) environment . 
  the big advantage of mingw is that programs compiled with mingw do n't depend on special dll files , whereas cygwin features the more complete unix toolsuite . 
  the compiler for c / c++ in mingw is the gcc suite . 
  if you want to read more on the difference between mingw and cygwin go [ here ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/771756/what-is-the-difference-between-cygwin-and-mingw ) . 
  what kind of ide are you using ? 
  notepad + + is not bad as an editor , but i 'd look into something different , since it does not feature any code completion , live syntax analysis or project management ( as far as i 'm aware ) . 
  you could either go the high level gui way and get for instance [ eclipse cdt ] ( http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ ) or [ code : : blocks ] ( http://www.codeblocks.org/ ) . 
  or you could go deep and learn one of the two classic editors : [ emacs ] ( http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ ) or [ vim ] ( http://www.vim.org/ ) . 
  there are other editors that are suddenly highly popular like [ sublime text ] ( http://www.sublimetext.com/ ) but i 'd rather not use any of those , since in my opinion they are like a watered down version of the classic editors . 
  i started learning to program using eclipse cdt and liked it , but later on i wanted something less bloated and more functional and chose emacs ( some might argue that is just a step further into that direction , but whatever ... ) and i really enjoy it . 
  if you 're still starting out then learning to use emacs / vim on top of learning to code for the first time might be overkill , so i 'd suggest looking into a widely used ide like eclipse , code : : blocks or even visual studio ( which you can get for free if you are a student ) . 
  on a different note : if you already know your way around a * nix operating system then i 'd recommend using one for programming . 
  all software you need for programming , be it compilers , editor plugins or whatever is usually way easier to set up and configure on a * nix system . 
  i use a fedora system ( [ fedora electronics lab ] ( http://spins.fedoraproject.org/fel/ ) ) for when i want to do serious work , my windows is more of my gaming / recreational operating system . 
  also it 's good practice to learn version management , as it really helps you with coding . 
  you can try out ideas without having to worry about screwing your code and you can always go back to what you had the day before or look up what you really changed since it worked last time . 
  i 'd recommend reading a basic introduction to [ git-scm ] ( http://git-scm.com/ ) as it is powerful , easy to learn and widely used .

  it 's customary to post personal stories on 4chan using the greentext styletag . 
  this indicates a thread where others are encouraged to also post related stories . 
  somehow similar to / r/askreddit . 
  the language is n't as offensive as possible ... 
  played ? 
  does curiosity have speakers ? 
  they will probably launch it with a new valve aaa title ... episode 3 anyone ? 
  where did you get them , custom made ? 
  i want one as escape key ... 
  sideshop trick : on heros that go soul ring first , like tinker or warlock , buy a soul ring recipie at start , you can get the other items from the side shop . 
  also : keybind quickbuy !, 
  when you 're about to die just mash that button . 
  or spawn them once before 0:00 to scout/denie runes . 
  make sure you do it eraly enough to resummon them when you need them to farm . 
  same goes for nature 's treants . 
  it 's none of your business if i silently use my smartphone with not too bright display during a movie . 
  i currently prefer reddit sync , 
  what 's that dark line that goes through the reservoir , that is connecting the 2 small buildings on either side ? 
  you can still buy banned games in germany , but stores ca n't have them on display .
