  have n't found anything like that in the camera 's options so far ... 
  sofort tr\u00e4nengas in den bus !, 
  you have n't lived until you have enslaved an erredar chaosbringer in the arcway that gives you a 30 % haste and dmg buff . 
  found a way :, 
  ` #showtooltip life cocoon `, 
  ` / cast life cocoon `, 
  it stops if you have a dead , friendly target . 
  otherwise it casts as normal . 
  i think you need to have auto self cast enabled for it to work properly . 
  if it does n't work i can fix it with a couple of extra conditions . 
  also , sports betting bureaus , and those shitty small `` casinos '' with the slot machines . 
  wow is on my 960 evo nvme drive . 
  what are loading times ? 
  it has paint chips on the hood , it 's definitely being driven ... 
  ok , next is a mobile messenger app please . 
  it 's zero based indexing . 
  it starts at floor 0 . 
  a house that only has the zeroeth floor still has one floor . 
  here we have the ground floor , and then we add the first floor above that . 
  it also might be more ingraind here , because we have different words for it . 
  the ground floor is the `` erdgeschoss '' , while everything above that is `` stockwerk '' . 
  orc warlocks look awesome imho . 
  those giant shoulders , hnng . 
  i played on a private server back then , so this might not haven been possible on blizzard servers , but :, 
  in karazhan , there are some hallways where concubines will control a few players . 
  on our server , you still had control of your your character , but the other raid members were enemies . 
  i got controlled , many of the raid members switch to target me to kill me for fun . 
  i , not wanting to die , hit that nice instant aoe fear button ( howl of terror ) . 
  all of the raid ran in all kinds of directions , aggroing everything , wipe . 
  die kosten normal so 20-50 $ rum . 
  mirrorless but keep the legacy mount ? 
  do n't think that will happen ... 
  [ toner ( nachbau ) ] ( https://www.amazon.de/bubprint%c2%ae-kompatibel-dcp-7065dn-mfc-7460dn-mfc-7860dw/dp/b005opnvny/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1499850151&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=2250dn+toner ) kosten 12-17 $ / 5200 seiten , halten jedoch nach meiner erfahrung sogar noch l\u00e4nger . 
  das aktuelle modell der serie schein der [ hl-l2340dw ] ( https://www.amazon.de/brother-hl-l2340dw-mono-laserdrucker-2400-schwarz/dp/b00luh8uhc/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1499850785&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brother+laser+mono ) zu sein , der hat jetzt auch wlan . 
  while world questing i wo n't turn the aggro ability off , unless it 's a real boss that i could n't solo myself . 
  wrong . 
  too many tanks care who 's taking some random mob . 
  if we 're not in a dungon or raid , it does n't matter if a tank is tanking or a hunter pet or a wl infernal . 
  go to any big city , gastro pubs that produce high quality burgers made with daily fresh local beef are starting to spring up everywhere . 
  here in munich i can recommend hamburgerei , burger und bier , and burger house . 
  i know nothing about the process it self , but ca n't you apply directly at the university instead of using uni-assist ? 
  in lightroom enable `` lens correction '' and `` remove chromatic aberrations '' , and you should be good . 
  you did switch the camera to manual focus , right ? 
  because if not you are turning the focus motor along with the focus ring . 
  ok , did n't know that . 
  i 'd probably stick with the d5100 until there is a really significant new development or until you want to switch to fx ( if at all ) . 
  if you do for some reason want a new body right now , i 'd consider buying the d7200 instead of the d7500 , as it has dual cards , ai-s metering and is significantly cheaper . 
  there is the tamron 70-300 di ld f/4 -5,6 which costs about $ 140 . 
  however , that lens does not have image stabilization which i think ins crucial in hand held shooting with tele lenses . 
  also , the auto focus is supposedly not that great . 
  tamron 's offering with vc ( vr in nikon terms ) is the tamron af 70-300mm f/4 .0 -5.6 sp di vc usd xld , which costs about the same as the nikkon af-p lens at about $ 450 . 
  however , that lens has been on the market for quite a while and you might be able to find it used or refurbished . 
  there are a few universities that are famous for certain fields . 
  do you mind telling us what you want to study ? 
  for anything engineering related it 's tum or rwth aachen, 
  economics is mannheim, 
  law heidelberg or lmu, 
  medicine heidelberg , lmu or humboldt in berlin, 
  however , if munich is not your thing , i 'd say stuttgart probably . 
  * balls, 
  that drone grip thing seems like the most necessary invention ever . 
  and why did they diversify it ` s boss ? 
  this has come up several times recently , there seems to be a disparity in the us , some people consider the `` burger '' to be just the patty , which is then aggregated into a sandwich with the other typical ingredients . 
  others see the `` burger '' as the whole ensemble . 
  eh , since i have my addons and settings version controlled using git anyways , adding elvui to that is easy , and i can update using a simple ` git pull ` . 
  they still have the code . 
  no problem there , only the website is down . 
  they did use git , but hosted on their own , not on github . 
  i install and update elvui directly through git . 
  depending on the van , you can likely drive it with the regular car license . 
  can you tell us what kind of van it is ? 
  i recently bought a load of polsilver blades ( excellent blades , i usually use feather , but these are great as well ) from a redditor that ships them in bulk , at 16ct / blade including shipping . 
  flickr is still used mainly by photographers , as you can easily manage your flickr collection from within adobe lightroom , it allows uncompressed images , and you can see metadata at a glace ( focal length , aperture etc. ) . 
  it 's somewhat dead as a social platform though . 
  nice thing is , if you manage your flickr account through lightroom , if flickr goes away you can easily republish it all on some other platform . 
  in addition , move the aperture lever by hand , look if the blades close evenly . 
  yes . 
  you can only charge the battery with a charger , not via data cable . 
  no , the connector is kinda special . 
  what kinds of exciting new firmware updates are there ? 
  i get it , twitch client makes managing addons easy , i use it , too . 
  but installing elvui is n't that complicated either , and with git it 's even less painful . 
  see the photo at , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usb#connector_types, 
  the nikon d7200 cable uses a uc-e6 connector at the camera , which is proprietary and non-standardized , meaning the nikon cable could have a different pin layout from some other uc-e6 cable you get from somewhere . 
  look at [ this nikon 6mm fx lens ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t9whtx2.jpg ) for a truly nuts front element . 
  that lens has more than 180 \u00b0 fov .

  for version controlling the addons , just go into the interface/addons folder , start up git , and git init in there , create a commit with all files . 
  before big upgrades , create a new version . 
  if your interface breaks and you do n't want to fix it right now you just have to check out the old version . 
  getting elvui in there is a bit more complicated , as elvui folder contains 2 subfolders , which need to be in the addons folder . 
  for that i cloned elvui directly into the interface folder , and symlinked the 2 subfolders in there into the interface/addons folder . 
  now you can update elvui simply by doing git pull in the elvui folder . 
  to version control the settings , create a git repository in the wtf folder . 
  adapter , obviously , not f-mount on mirrorless .
