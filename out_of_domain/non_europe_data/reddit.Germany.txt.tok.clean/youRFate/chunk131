  eh , even as a munich resident who loves it here i have to say that berlin does have quality of life , but in a very different way . 
  monocle 's quality of life survey 2017 ranked munich and berlin on a shared 3 ^ rd place . 
  it very much depends on what you want out of a city . 
  also , he 's going to visit for a few days , not move there . 
  in old wc3 dota days , the game mode would be indicated by a liste of parameters , that the host would enter in chat upon starting the map . 
  ap is all pick , sd is single draft , em is easy mode , meaning more gold and weaker towers . 
  lok ( from digital rev ) also had a great tip : when you want to take a picture of a subject fairly close , act like you photograph something high above them , maybe the facade of the building behind them . 
  then take the camera off your eye and in front of you , like you are looking at the picture you took . 
  actually you activated live view while looking up , and take a snap of them while it looks like you review your pic . 
  careful though , if you are too close they might hear the shutter ... 
  option 4 : delete the photo , but have 2 sd cards in backup mode  . 
   most cameras have 2 cards, 
  maybe in blessed nikon land , canon now not even has 2 slots on the 6d ... 
  in germany there is also the problem , that you ca n't publish pictures of you took of someone without their permission , even in public space . 
  if there is a clear main subject , you need that persons permission . 
  reset the d3300 to factory settings and try again . 
  if it 's still bad , send it to nikon for repair . 
  it 's a great camera that can produce image quality more than appropriate for a yearbook ... 
  i 've actually done the opposite last time i went to london . 
  the 4 eu counters had a giant line , the `` all passports , international '' counter had one person waiting . 
  went there with my eu passport , was no problem at all , caught the last bus from louton airport to the railway station . 
  meh , most bmw enthusiasts do n't like the us look ... 
  that is something that has been done many times here in germany , we call those lakes [ baggersee ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/baggersee ) which translates to `` excavator lake '' . 
  purposely flooded , usually depleted surface coal mines . 
  do n't back down . 
  they cropped the watermark , this is criminal infringement . 
  if they want cheaper photos , they have to negotiate before using it . 
  why is there a chunk of ice cream on top of your lens ? 
  regardless of where you study , i would try to get a student employee position at a company in your field of study . 
  as you already have a bachelor 's degree that will pay a lot better than unrelated jobs . 
  also the work experience will be relevant in your cv and you might even land a job there after you finish your master 's degree . 
  i did my master 's degree ( electrical engineering ) at tum and i now work at the company i was a student employee at . 
  is that for 35h or 40h / week ? 
  please also read out [ wiki article ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) on finding an appartment in munich . 
  it also mentions common scams . 
  buy the current issue of monocle magazine , read their quality of life survey , decide . 
  i have never heard aachen being described positive in any way , their only redeeming factor is the excellent rwth . 
  if possible , locate your breaker box and turn of the breaker for that room . 
  even better , turn of all breakers , then turn them on one-by-one , noting what they do . 
  keep all breakers off that do not power anything in your apartment . 
  i had a job as a student employee with a bacherlor 's degree in ee which paid a little more than 20 $ / hr . 
  be aware that you can usually only work up to 20 hours per week during semester , otherwise you lose your student status . 
  in that case it 's an ok salary , but not great , considering you have 2 years experience . 
  my fear is blowing the dust from the sensor into the af system , where you ca n't see it but it will negatively impact your af ... 
  i find it kinda hard to empty that battery in one day , do you go out multiple days without a way to charge it ? 
  i know where the af system is , but it 's possible that you blow into the mirror box , and thereby move the dust from the sensor to the af system , instead of out of the camera . 
  should have kidnapped him at the g20 summit in hamburg ...

  the most astonishing trademark is imho * adrenaline * . 
  you 've got a whitebox ? 
  excellent job regardless . 
  i instantly liked the absence of any significant shadows . 
  52mm is correct , it also says so on the bottom of the lens ( \u2300 52 ) . 
  18-55mm is the focal length , not the filter thread diameter . 
  still , the knife blade should be facing the plate ... 
  you can typically tell the camera to lift it up for cleaning somewhere in the menu . 
  that ` s what insurance is for ... 
  they look really nice , i have vmr v710 19 '' , which look very similar . 
  see [ this rather good writeup on quora ] ( https://www.quora.com/how-does-the-us-navy-rail-gun-work ) : the tungsten projectile has an aluminium casing , which is essentially vaporized during acceleration and burns . 
  you do n't give wowhead any login information , it redirects to battle.net login and then asks for permission to access the information it needs . 
  [ you can see here how the blizzard oauth api works ] ( https://dev.battle.net/docs/read/oauth ) . 
  you are n't . 
  you log into battlet.net and give wowhead api access to read some of the data it needs , they do n't get your login information . 
  many websites use a system like to for example to enable google login , called oauth . 
  they do n't get your login , they only get an auth token that grants them access to read some data from your account , see the edits i made to the post . 
  i like how they deliberatly drove by paddleboarders , just to showcase how much cooler this is . 
  looks nice , want one . 
  they would also be kinda cool without the motor , just do ride behind a boat . 
  did you also pin one of your characters ? 
  when you ` re looking at the character profile on wowhead , there is a pin button . 
  no , i mean liability insurance . 
  if i were to accidentally break your camera , my liability insurance would pay for your new camera . 
  read the edits . 
  firstly , wowhead does not get login information , they only get an oauth token to read data . 
  secondly , you can also import your character without giving them any access . 
  click the giant power button symbol to enable / disable ublock origin for the site you 're currently on . 
  also , on many sites that tell you to disable adblock you can get arround that by setting up [ reek 's anti adblock killer ] ( https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer ) . 
  last time this was posted somewhere the comments mentioned that the person was trying to replicate kfc , and kfc use pressure fryers , so that person apparently used oil in their pressure cooker and it went horribly wrong . 
  https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer#instruction explains it nicely . 
  you need a userscript addon , like tempermonkey or greasemonkey . 
  then install the user script . 
  then you have to subscribe to the filterlist for ublock . 
  nikon d5300 + af-p 10-20mm lens , since most of your work would probably be indoors and you want a decently wide angle . 
  if you can get a good price , a used d7xxx might also be a nice option . 
  right tripods . 
  but $ 80 wo n`t buy you anything that i ` d remotely recommend for professional use . 
  look at manfroto , gitzo or sirui , with sirui being the cheapest of the bunch . 
  siehe [ wiki ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hei%c3%9fschrauben-compound ) . 
  i still think that if someone takes over a plane with nail clippers he deservers the plane and it should now legally be his own private plane . 
  they let 5 year olds fly without parents , that kid needs to get over sitting a few meters away from their parents for a few hours ... 
  drink at least one liter of beer per day , eat a lot of meat . 
  ah , eugenics , i can support that in this case ... 
  aka romanesco ... 
  could also be duac, 
  what camera did you use ? 
  can you view the pictures in programs like the windows foto viewer ? 
  as you said they are jpegs , you should be able to edit them with any software there is . 
  i 've never tried view nx2 , but maybe that only supports raw ? 
  where do you live ?
