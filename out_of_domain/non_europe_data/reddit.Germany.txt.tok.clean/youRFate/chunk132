  there might be good local shops that rent out gear . 
  forewords, 
  oh , right , mostly i 'm interested in the differences between the w-1004 and the w-2004 . 
  they both can hold more then enough weight for my needs , but i 'm interested if the additionional stiffness still makes it worth going for the 2004 over the 1004 . 
  same for the e-10 and e-20 heads . 
  it has the tallest church in the world , and 4th tallest structure built before the 20th century . 
  sorry , trying too hard . 
  do you have a quality tripod already ? 
  right , i have a teflon pan i use for breakfast eggs mostly . 
  i 'm using ikea pans for that . 
  their nicer pans are still dirt cheap and last . 
  boss burger . 
  you meant u/not4fapping , there is no r/not4fapping ... 
  i 'm still in the process of finding out what i want . 
  sirui makes some nice tripods for fairly cheap if you consider their aluminium models . 
  other than that , feisol is still within reason even for carbon fibre . 
  if you want to spend real money ( 700-1500 $ ) then look at really right stuff or gitzo . 
  manfroto sits somewhere in between gitzo and feisol , but their heads do n't use arca-swiss afaik , so they 're out . 
  finding a place to live with just one week in munich is about as likely ask playing the lottery imho . 
  unless you plan to spend quite a bit of money ( 1000 + $ / mo ) this is going to be a a tough operation , especially since you need it so soon . 
  read our [ wiki article on the subject ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) , it should help you somewhat . 
  what the fuck ? 
  you ` ll pay less than 40 % taxes if you have ( i assume ) a partner and a kid . 
  other than that , 60k is ok but not really great , how much experience do you have ? 
  will your partner work as well ? 
  in that case shoot for at the very least 80k . 
  von nord-osten her \u00fcber die `` sandbank '' hinlaufen , kann man auf [ google maps ganz gut sehen ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/weideninsel/@48.124083,11.5686939,867m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x479ddf681415cec9:0xeffd6b6bb4b23a9b!8m2!3d48.124083!4d11.570861 ) . 
  i live in munich and during oktoberfest you will see a lot of confused foreign tourists standing at the theresienstra\u00dfe subway station ( which is close to the tum university ) , looking for the oktoberfest . 
  little do they know that the correct subway station is theresienwiese ... 
  dies . 
  german reality tv , i think it was frauentausch aka wife swap . 
  the husband told his new wife how to properly use toilet paper as she was using too much for his taste . 
  do a flip !, 
  that sounds really interesing . 
  but , 50mm on crop for street ? 
  would n't you want a wider lens ? 
  you 're holding your camera in a very weird way ... 
  meh , i think it 's still a shitty way to do business , $ 6k wedding package including album , but th album cover is $ 125 extra ? 
  just include that ... 
  you need to learn 2 things : how to get your camera to focus where you want it to , and how the aperture controls how much of an image is in focus . 
  to see the effect , set the camera to a mode ( aperture priority ) and take the same picture at different aperture settings . 
  the smaller the number ( e.g. 
  f/2 vs f/8 ) the wider open the aperture is . 
  wider open apertures produce shallower depth of field ( less stuff is in focus ) . 
  closing the aperture down puts more stuff in focus , but the camera gets less light , so it has to expose longer or use higher iso . 
  you should choose your favorite , maybe your 2 or 3 favorites , and only post those . 
  maybe even edit several of those fireworks into one shot . 
  kamp-lintfort does n't strike me as a city with an especially difficult housing situation . 
  you can read the nice [ wiki article on finding an appartment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) from the r/munich subreddit , most of it applies to all of germany . 
  as far as i know you also have the right to pay the deposit in installments , but many landlords wo n't like that , as they understandably prefer tennants that have money . 
  they will get to it , but they will work first-come first-serve , understandably . 
  only thing i 'm not fully comfortable with is that it interferes with my bag . 
  i 'm using a billingham hadley pro , which is also a shoulder bag , so now i have 2 shoulder straps . 
  having the bag on one side and the camera on the other feels a bit tight on the neck . 
  still have n't found the perfect solution for this . 
  i looked at the exact same tripod . 
  but i think i 'm going to go with a feisol carbon fibre tripod and a sirui head . 
  you could print them in the size of the screen , and tape it over the screen . 
  that is not that uncommon for large datacenters . 
  the supermuc computer in munich also provides heat to the other buildings of the lrz computing center . 
  see [ their website ] ( https://www.lrz.de/services/compute/supermuc/systemdescription/ ) for a bit more information . 
  haha was ? 
  meeeeh , there are cheap ink-jet compatible transparent sheets , for stuff like overhead projectors . 
  i 'd say carrying a computer on an outdoor shoot is more inconvenient . 
  i 'd also make the sign brighter and change the white balance on it , to make it look better . 
  i like how the aperture of the 100mm is crooked in the promo shot , 
  apparently it 's kinda normal for lenses to not be completely round at very small apertures . 
  the worst occurance of that i ever witnessed was a buddy of mine at a metal festival . 
  he had a maggi 5 minute cup of mashed potatos and saussage bits . 
  he tore it open , poured in cold beer , and then proceeded to eat it all . 
  that horrible grainy dried potato stuff with the large chunks of freeze-dried hot dog . 
  so incredibly disgusting ... 
  maybe also ask in r/denver . 
  good luck getting it back and i hope your flight was n't too boring without your books . 
  try using a polarization filter if it 's truly a problem , that might help . 
  the isar is really quite clean . 
  i do n't think you 'd get very far , the isar is faster than you assume from looking at it ( goes for most rivers ) . 
  meh , sky scrapers are immense prestige objects for companies , their cost is not rational in any way . 
  they will jump on this . 
  thomas henry bitter lemon . 
  right , that + the 35 should be good i think . 
  schau mal in unseren [ wiki artikel zum thema ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) . 
  anyone know what kind of camera he used to film this ? 
  for stills he had an exakta . 
  did he bring the glass for the windows along ? 
  or is it some kind of foil ? 
  i have a d7200 and i thought about taking it to work with me , but i do n`t know if i should . 
  there is n`t that much interesting stuff going on along my commute route , and at work i ca n`t take any pictures . 
  bought a hoya hd cir-pl last week , am happy with it so far . 
  no other tool comes close to [ photorec ] ( http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/photorec ) which is a frontend to testdisk . 
  yea right , hire someone because they modified some picture ... 
  based on one picture ? 
  he said :, 
   honestly they should hire you for that . 
  i find it hard to believe that one picture would be all it takes to get a job there ... 
  see , that is what i mean , you have a portfolio . 
  hiring someone based on one picture alone would be kinda weird . 
  musstest ? 
  read the wiki . 
  good luck , you will need it .
