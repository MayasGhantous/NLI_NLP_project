  42 hours a week is still a lot ... 
  sure , but here most higher education jobs have 35h weeks . 
  that is the zeller see , but you ca n't actually see zell am see in this picture :d . 
  normal ball hitch , used on small vehicles everywhere except north america . 
  meh , the fx kit lenses are decent apparently . 
  the rest of the show is the parody , but the intro is replicated as good as they can . 
  yup . 
  got a d7200 , love that camera . 
   to go south you must go north, 
  that quote is actually wrong , it 's the other way around :, 
   to go north , you must journey south , to reach the west you must go east . 
  to go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow . 
  has the [ cover of this season ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lf41nxi.jpg ) been discussed ? 
  it shows an ice dragon ... 
  where did you end up sleeping ? 
  meh , usually s-bahn is faster than cabs on that route ... 
  just because you say it 's not spam does not make it so . 
  you spammed it into tons of subreddits , so it is spam by definition ... 
  a billingham hadley large pro should do . 
  if you want more space , get a billingham 550 . 
  you can drink in public pretty much everywhere except the us . 
  try mup ( mirror up ) mode . 
  quiet mode still slamms the mirror up , but only lets it come back down when you release the button , at that point the picture is already taken , so it wo n't have any benefit . 
  arca-swiss is a standart type of mount which many companies use . 
  arca-swiss themselves make tridpods and heads as well , they are incredibly expensive though ( but also very good ) . 
  other companies makes compatible tripod heads and plates , [ for example sirui ] ( http://www.sirui.eu/en/products/stativkoepfe/gx-serie/ ) . 
  read [ our wiki article ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) . 
  that should cover the basics . 
  awesome . 
  their ipad app is n't optimized for ipad pro yet and seems kinda bad . 
  i currently use [ these awesome character sheets ] ( http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/ ) toghether with the [ goodnotes app ] ( http://goodnotesapp.com/ ) . 
  i always find that i do n't like apps like hero lab , i like to write additional stuff all over my sheets , which works like a charm with ipad pro , goodnotes , apple pencil and good pdf sheets . 
  also , i like to keep notes on the story which i just append on the sheet in the same app . 
  nice !, 
  one of those big packs lasts an eternity , and it smells nice . 
  i always buy those giant kinda old-school styled packs . 
  ca n't really help with that decisiton , but i can tell you that i love my d7200 . 
  ca n't you do timelapses and interval timed pictures in the camera menu ? 
  meh , they are all about money as well . 
  for a fee you can get back in and marry with a priest etc. 
  i use persil universal , but i live in germany , i do n't know if that detergent is sold in the us . 
  i also like know about we and nrj . 
  carbonated vodka is nice . 
  that depends on the lens . 
  for example , my nikon 35 1.8 g takes a lot more force than my 18-140 , probably because the 35 has a rubber seal at the back . 
  also , i do n't personally own a tamron lens yet , but i mounted one on my buddies camera , and it felt really loose in comparison to my nikon lenses . 
  is that a version of lol , or is it a screaming person with their arms extended skyward ? 
  aww yes , as a fellow giesing / harlaching resident i can attest to that . 
  i also really liked cafe centro , but they stopped delivering , i think they are changing owners / renovating . 
  81667 : you are very close to l'osteria am gasteig . 
  go there for pickup or use foodora for delivery . 
  they are better than most delivery services , i agree , but they are also kinda expensive . 
  do you actually need to money right now ? 
  i would probably refuse the $ 900 offer and keep at it . 
  i do n't know how to go about this , but you should enforce a zwangsvollstreckung . 
  the munich subreddit has a nice article about [ finding an appartment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich/wiki/apartment ) which applies to all of germany basically . 
  i think it ` s due to some law stating that if you put on an age statement , it can only be for the youngest component in the bottle , you ca n`t mention the ages of the other ones . 
   nor #trump neither #erdogan have #paranoia . 
  but both are man of god , on their very right tracks thanks to #metanoia . 
  locals maybe go there once to see it , but no local will go there on purpose , except for a few old peope . 
   * ( ( ( sonos ) ) ), 
  4 panel life ? 
  i 'd probably tell them to go there to see it , but to go somewhere else to eat / drink , like weisses br\u00e4uhaus , or tegernseer . 
  both of which are even closer to marienplatz than the hofbr\u00e4uhaus and have better prices and food . 
  you can set it to af-f ( i think ) and it will refocus all the time , but it 's not nice ... 
  usually you only get those after you are fully enrolled , all fees paid . 
  which university are you at ? 
  at both universities i studied at you could download them in their online portal after you paid your fees . 
  what kind of answer do they expect ? 
  just wanted to recommend that . 
  i think that 's the most i laughed reading a book so far . 
  that nikon d7x00 he 's using there is like $ 1000 without a lens . 
  looks a lot better than 99 % of the other m4s , which will also never see track . 
  seconded . 
  also , since their website does n't load right now , here is a [ google maps link to it ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/augustiner+br%c3%a4ustuben/@48.1391151,11.5456626,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1a2efa2cb8130a2a?sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjltmv_4_hvahxjulakhandanuq_biigwewcg ) . 
  the weather today and on saturday is pretty nice , so a beergarden is also an option . 
  also depends on where you stay . 
  is that the one where two people share a keyboard ? 
  i bet those would not be sold in russia ... 
  maybe also consider checking out the [ auto & technik museum sinsheim ] ( https://sinsheim.technik-museum.de/de/ ) . 
  if you are interested in cars , planes and technology it ` s well worth a visit . 
  receipts here are always printed , not written by hand . 
  no , your hausratsversicherung will pay for new stuff it it dies . 
  plug in everything you own !, 
  the nikkor 70-200 f/2 .8 vr ii is now cheaper than that lens . 
  is the tamron better than that ? 
  it ` s a lot newer but i would guess the nikkor has the upper hand in build quality . 
  edit : sorry , amazon was showing me used prices , as they did n't have a new vrii . 
  the vrii is about 500 $ more than the tamon . 
  do you carry a camera to work ? 
  that dof looks like it 's not a phone cam . 
  rice paddies are often terraced .

  photo by tuan guitare . 
  i 'm think i should maybe start doing that , too . 
  however , i 'd like a smaller camera for that , something like an x-pro2 ... 
  i do carry a messenger bag to work every day already , with stuff like headphones , water , umbrella , book etc. 
  in it . 
  might as well switch it out for my billingham , carry just the camera with a 35 , and pack the rest of the stuff from my work bag in there ... 
  this remids me very much of one of the random civilian buildings vom c&c 3 : tiberian sun,
