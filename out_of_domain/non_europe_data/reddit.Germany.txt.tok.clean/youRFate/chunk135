  reminds me of the razorbacks from the * daemon * and * freedom \u2122 * novels by daniel suarez . 
  nothing shitty about a product that people actually want as long as it actually gets made and delivered ...

  went with the classic [ tinberland icon chukka ] ( https://www.timberland.dk/shop/en/tbl-dk/men-highlights/men%ca%bcs-icon-chukka-yellow-chocolate-23061231 ) . 
  oled uses way less energy though . 
  its easier to use better sensors that have less noise at the same iso . 
  well , both , actually :  . 
  since school vacation just ended many people that do n't have kids are going on vacation now ( less traffic , less crowded , cheaper ) . 
  do the keys they gave you work ? 
  do you still have the copy of the contract they gave you to read ? 
  i would not worry too much . 
  sch\u00f6nes ding , super soundtrack , gibts nen [ sehr interessanten gdc talk dazu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4fnbmzsqry ) .

  i read about a guy that removed the protective mat from the base of a ski lift tower , draged it up the hill , and rode it down the mountain , only to crash into the exact tower he removed the mat from , and die . 
  [ darwin award link ] ( http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1998-15.html ),

  here both the dish and the vegetable are the same . 
  these look exactly like the sheets by [ marcus drowning ] ( http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc ) ... 
  you call the e36 the ugly stepchild of an e30 . 
  how often do you have power outages oo ? 
  the last one i remeber was years ago , and lasted maybe 5 minutes . 
  i ` ve never been without power for more than like 30 minutes in my life . 
   3-4 times a year . 
  only a day or two each time . 
  holy shit . 
  in that case i ` d have some sort of backup system as well . 
  if it ` s that bad , ca n`t you sue the power company if you have no power for more than like an hour ? 
  there was a south park episode on this . 
  sadly i have n't found any so far . 
  meh , that guy should be toast in like 2 hits , ship weapons should be immensely powerful against basically unarmored men ... 
  nah , i did n`t mean direct hits . 
  hitting the ground near someone should also just kill them . 
  that particle effect is something like vaporized ground , that should do it ... 
  lol . 
  sounds fun . 
  we have leasing plants in our offices , nothing to do there ... 
  if you want good running shoes , go to [ sport schuster ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/sporthaus+schuster/@48.1367468,11.5742878,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7c605cd0aa825ab8?sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjfuqqu-rpwahwlwbqkhumjdagq_biifjan ) near marienplatz . 
  they have a short track inside with a camera system for gait analysis and will sell you shoes that are prefect . 
  there are a lot of easy to google / low effort questions . 
  also housing / oktoberfest questions are often downvoted as they all basically ask the same thing . 
  yes , sometimes it is weird and i 've also seen questions that are downvoted for unknown reasons . 
  i mostly just downvote every housing / oktoberfest question . 
  i feel like a bunch of people would not damage the plane too much . 
  my english teacher told us this method : get in bed , put your hat on one of the bedposts , now drink tea with honey and whisky until you see hats on both bedpoles , then sleep .

  only 2 weeks of vacation for their employees ? 
  what kind of slavers are they ? 
  in the bill you can click `` details '' , and specify what type of material he 's allowed to use for this bill . 
  i started yesterday , but i 've found a lot of the processes to be quite similar to df , so i feel kinda at home . 
  yes , this works for every kind of bill you set , you can pretty much always choose which materials and qualities will be used , and you can even set a minimum skill level so untalented dwarfs do n't waste your precious material . 
  yes , still has a chance to zzt . 
  df is dwarf fortress , the game rimworld took lots of inspiration from . 
  still a lot better than having them out in the rain ( my first fort ) , or near a vital area where they destroy important stuff . 
  a man was in a hurry and ignored a red traffic light . 
  unfortunately a cop observed his delinquency and stopped him right away . 
  the man , who was also slightly drunk , knew it would n't end well if the cop further checked him , but he stopped anyway and slid his window open . 
  `` hi , can i have your driver 's license please ? '', 
  `` no , since i do n't currently have one , i lost it because i drove drunk . '', 
  `` sir , would you please leave your car !, 
  `` i 'm sorry , but if i did you would see the blood stains on my trousers . '', 
  `` what bloodstains ? '', 
  `` i just killed my girlfriend . '', 
  the cop takes out his revolver , points it at him , then he orders the man to open the glove box . 
  `` i wo n't do that , because then you wold see the .45 colt i killed my gf with . '', 
  the cop takes out his radio and orders backup . 
  `` now open your trunk ! '', 
  `` that 's where i 've put my dead girlfriend . '', 
  meanwhile , the backup has arrived . 
  the cop tells them the whole story , they immediately open the door and pull the man out of the car , thereby noticing there is no blood on his clothes . 
  when they investigate the glove box , they found nothing . 
  in the trunk there was only a six pack of bottled water , no trace of a girlfriend . 
  the cop comes back to the man and tells him `` the other cop told us you had a corpse in the trunk , what 's that all about ? '' - `` he also claimed , i drover over a red traffic light ... '' the man replied . 
  took me some time to translate that into english ... 
  fixed the linebreakes, 
  go 27th , go . 
  i really thought of sleeping a whole day , so i have to wait one day less ...
