  also , elitekeyboards state that their [ red double-shot esc keycap ] ( http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=access,cherrymxkeys&pid=cds_redesc ) is made in germany , does anyone know who makes them ? 
  maybe i can buy them here so i do n't have to import it from usa . 
  edit : another question : are there any red esdf keys available ? 
  ( i 'd use red wasd keys , but then i 'd lose the ridge on the f key ... ) . 
  ** this has been solved , esdf caps an esc ordered from wasdkeyboards . 
  aaand another question : i have a mx blue keyboard at home , and now i want a mecha for work . 
  i 'm thinking about getting a tenkeyless mx brown , because of the noise . 
  but are brown really quiet enough to be used in an office / lab environment , where other ppl . 
  are not far away ? 
  ( i assume they are still louder than rubber domes ? ), 
  i 'm looking for european vendors that sell kbc poker or noppoo choc 60 % keyboards with brown switches . 
  the other choice is the filco minila , but keyboardco does not have them in stock . 
  also i do n't like the layout with the small shift keys and arrow keys . 
  ** bought from kbtpure.com , got the non-backlit version with pbt keycaps . 
  after recieving my new keycap puller today i removed a bunch of keys from my german das keyboard professional s. i discovered that it does have the cherry mx style stabilizers on the spacebar , but filco style wire stabilizers on all the other keys . 
  now i have to get some lube and lube up the spacebar . 
  i do n't think the spacebar feels bad , but the spacebar on my kbt pure , which also has cherry mx style stabilizers , feels more responsive . 
  hi , i just made my first million ( or 1,5 to be exact ) . 
  i still only have the mercury ship i started out with and i do n't know how to go from here . 
  i feel like i need to invest in something now , but what ? 
  a second ship ? 
  stock market ? 
  trading software ? 
  my plan is to get a tl class ship and have my own trading empire . 
  or do i just need to keep trading , but with more expensive stuff , like weapons and ammunition ? 
  i made most of this money with space fuel and a jump drive , trading with the yaki pirates . 
  hi , a friend of mine is looking for new iems to use with his phone . 
  preferably they should have in-line controls and mic ( android ) . 
  he says he had some difficulty with them falling out so maybe sports in-ears that have that bar around the ear ? 
  budget would be up to around 50 $ , preferably even lower . 
  my parents are visiting this saturday , and we wanted to go to a beergarden for lunch or dinner . 
  which one would you recommend ? 
  we would like good food , maybe more variety than just haxn and hendl  . 
  budget is not much of an issue in this case . 
  hi , i have some questions :, 
  * what 's the difference between the rcs thrusters with 4 nozzles and the ones with 1 nozzle ? 
  which should i use where and when ? 
  * if i use solid fuel boosters , should i still use my main engine aswell for the first part or only fire it up once the solid fuel is gone ? 
  lmb and rmb of my g700 make problems ( sometimes doubleclicks , sometimes stops being pressed ) . 
  i play mostly mmos and moba games , therefore i like having more than the usual amount of buttons . 
  i like the big size and heavy weight of the g700 . 
  what i did n't like was the stiff cable , since i mostly used it with plugged-in cable . 
  mousepad is a steelseries 9hd , keyboard is a daskeyboard professional s. 
  i am thinking of buying either the g700 or the g600 . 
  what would you recommend ? 
  i have a germany qwertz keyboard and these keyboards have a deadkey for creating accented letters like \u00e2 or \u00ea . 
  but i want to remap that key to directly print a ' \\ ^ ' for programming . 
  right now i have to hit that button twice and then i receive the character 2 times at once , like so : ' \\ ^ \\ ^ ' . 
  is this possible ? 
  edit : oh , i would n't have had to escape in the title , 
  i just got my new [ saitek x53 pro ] ( http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/x52pro.html ) and i have a few questions about using it with arma 3 . 
  i disabled the clutch funcion of the `` i '' button on the throttle so i can use it in game . 
  problem ist arma does not recognize the button . 
  so i bound a key press on it , for example `` x '' to toggle auto hover . 
  however , when i press that button it sometimes turns auto hover off and back on . 
  can i change it so the button is only activated once when i press it ? 
  or is it possible for arma to recognize that button even if i do n't map a key press on it ( like the other buttons ) ? 
  also , arma does not recognize the throttle hat switch and the second hat switch on the stick . 
  can i change that ? 
  other than that i really like the x52 pro . 
  hi , i 'm not entirely new to the subject , but i recently decided that i want to take it more seriously . 
  up until recently i mostly drank the local stuff my parents bought , mostly lemberger / trollinger from the w\u00fcrttemberg region . 
  however , i recently moved to munich and i 've been trying stuff across the grocery store wine shelves . 
  i 've taken a liking mostly to cabernet sauvignons and merlots , but the grocery store mostly stocks the big brands like gallo and yellow tail , which i do enjoy , but i feel like i want to develop my taste further . 
  do you have any recommendations that i can get at big stores or should i find a wine retailer first ? 
  i 'm a student and my budget is somewhat limited , but i 'd say up to 10 $ / bottle is ok . 
  the store i usually shop at recently started stocking apothic red , which i quite like . 
  the best wine i recently tried is a northern italian cabernet sauvignon / merlot blend called [ rungg ] ( http://www.cantinatramin.it/en/1/93/collection-/classic-/classici-monovitigni-cabernet-merlot-rungg.htm ) by cantina tramin , which i got as a gift . 
  i do n't know if it 's relevant , but i have some experience in whisky , my favorites , among others , being laphroaig quarter cask and bruichladdich 's port charlotte series . 
  as for accessories , i already have a sommelier knive , some nice big wine glasses and an aereator / pourer which i got as a gift . 
  is a carafe essential ? 
  any other must-have accessories ? 
  i have a saitek x52 pro , and i got it to somewhat work : first you need to set the 2 round dials on the throttle to center ( 0 ) so you you stop looking around while walking . 
  then i changed the axis in the settings menu . 
  i also needed to invert throttle and pitch . 
  if you want the trigger to work you have to scroll down to `` weapons ii '' and set it there . 
  i still have the following problems though :, 
  * massive deadzones for which i have n't found a way to disable them, 
  * ~ ~ strafing can only be assigned to analogue axis in the joystick menu . 
  i would like to assign in to the hat switch on my throttle . ~ ~ update : see my post [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/x3tc/comments/1qpcdn/xr_joystick_hotas_thread/cdflj3v ) . 
  * i would like to set the zero point of my throttle to be at 25 % , not at 50 %, 
  * is there any way to free-look around using a hat switch ? 
  * clearing a setting that has a default entry , like looking around using the analog dials, 
  if you have any tips for me or the other joystick / hotas owners out there , please post them here !, 
  i 'm looking for a 10 '' tablet with a high resolution screen and lte , do you think the new nexus 10 ( if it will exist ) is going to feature lte ? 
  hi , does anyone of you know any dungeons & dragons groups in munich ? 
  i have n't played planetside in a while and would have to download massive amounts of updated to play it . 
  i recently bought a saitek x52 pro hotas and would like to know if it 's supported ingame . 
  if it is i 'd like to give planetside another go . 
  i 'm looking for a very robust , preferably metal / aluminum case that fits the common hand luggage size regulation for airlines . 
  hi , what 's your recommendations for food around the tu m\u00fcnchen ? 
  i do n't enjoy the food at the mensa all that much , so i started exploring all the restaurents around it . 
  i 've already tried the hans im gl\u00fcck and the sausalitos and the oliva d\u00f6ner place all of which are good , i can especially recommend going to suasalitos on monday , since they have 50 % off of all food then . 
  can anyone recommend a good asian fast food place around the tum ? 
  is he somehow sick ? 
  is there a cure for this ? 
  he gets both `` i 'm dying of starvation '' and `` i feel really full '' messages . 
  i switched to tinfoil for facebook , but it does n't have notifications . 
  iirc you can use facebook chat via any xmpp client , so is there a good one that supports facebook chat and does n't have those excessive permissions ?
