  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  what 's the best android app with which you can control deluge on a seedbox ? 
  i 've already found a really good ssh client : [ juicessh ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh&hl=en ) . 
  i have set it to mtp , but it does n't show up in my computer on windows 7 . 
  i can see it in device manager listed as `` google nexus adb interface '' under `` android device '' . 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
  ** edit : i have fixed it : i right-clicked the `` google nexus adb interface '' and hit uninstall , in the next window i checked `` remove device driver '' and let it do it 's thing . 
  then i unplugged it and plugged it back in again , now i see it under computer . 
  hi , apparently my origin account got hacked somehow . 
  what happened :, 
  a few days ago i got an email from origin that my password was successfully changed . 
  i had not used that account since about a month after bf3 came out , so that made me suspicious . 
  i went on to the origin website and tried to log in , but my password did not work . 
  so i used the `` forgot password '' feature and promptly got a link in my email using which i changed my password to a new , secure one . 
  however , my security question is now in russian ( google translator says it 's `` what 's your pet 's name '' now ) . 
  can i get origin support to change the security question without giving them the serial number of a game on that account ? 
  because my copy of bf3 is somewhere at my parent 's house and i ca n't get it right now . 
  i 'm also wondering how they got the account in the first place , the password was n't bad ( 8 character , alphanumeric ) and my email account is secure ( regularly updated password , two-factor authentication ) . 
  hi , i would like to synchronize savegames from an emulator between my phone and my pc . 
  is it possible to have google drive automatically sync the contents of a folder with google drive ? 
  see title , pushbullet for windows does not work on my work pc , the firefox integration does work , probably because i configured firefox to use the proxy . 
  the pc ( windows 7 ) has internet , can i share that with my phone over usb ? 
  the phone is not rooted . 
  watch necrolyte in game id 577807557 . 
  somehow he kills every hero with a combo of sticky napalm and shackle .

  what 's your advice , mainly concerning the build . 
  i do have a rhen ` lo flayer , but it 's not a good roll , i lose about 10 % dmg compared to my azurewrath . 
  my current build works well as long as i have enough mobs to kill . 
  however it really suffers if there are not enough mobs to take care of the cooldowns . 
  i can comfortably do t2 , t3 takes some more effort and i will die several times , but it 's still doable . 
  do you think it would be wise to switch to a build that uses sycophants instead of tribal rites ? 
  i have a bluetooth hands-free in my car , so i would like tasker to reply to every hangouts / text / whatsapp message that i 'm currently driving and they should call me instead of texting . 
  it should not reply to certain group conversations , as not to flood them . 
  it should be active when bt is connected and i 'm not actively using the device , so it does n't reply if i 'm actually answering . 
  as the title says , a friend and i have just bought it , but we ca n't get the multiplayer to work nicely . 
  we get disconnected each time we try it , we also switched to who hosts . 
  we both did n't alt-tab out . 
  update : we got it working by restarting steam . 
  we managed to play for several hours without disconnect then .

  6x6 heavy delivery truck, 
  data :, 
  * damage capacity : 600 points, 
  * mass : 10t, 
  attachments :, 
  * carriage, 
  * log cart, 
  * fuel cistern, 
  * garage carriage, 
  * utility attachment, 
  * cart with crane, 
  * crane support, 
  * medium log trailer, 
  * cistern trailer, 
  * garage trailer, 
  * utility trailer, 
  * frontal exhaust, 
  * big wheels can be installed ( slightly different driving qualities ), 
  which one do you prefer for which tasks , and why ? 
  i personally use the c-255 if the attachment i want to use is available for it , otherwise i 'll use the c-4320 . 
  for log transports i usually use the c-4320 with the crane + medium log trailer . 
  as for the addons , is there any advantage to the frontal exhaust ? 
  imho it only worsens offroad qualities , because you bump it all the time . 
  i 'm german , and i would like to acquire a domain in the style of * lastname.de * . 
  my lastname is very specific , only 2 families in germany have that name . 
  when i open lastname.de i get a generic advertising domain . 
  so i looked up who owns the domain on denic.de , which is the association in charge of managing . de top level domains . 
  the domain is owned by [ trademark unlimited inc. ] ( http://tmu.com/index.html ) which is based in a private home in florida . 
  what would be the best way to approach getting this domain ? 
  should i contact the `` company '' or would it be better to seek legal action right away ? 
  i plan on getting a new gaming rig sometime next year . 
  in the meantime i want to upgrade my current rig with a ssd which i will then use in the new pc next year . 
  my current choice is between the crucial mx100 256gb and the samsung 840 evo 250gb . 
  they cost about the same here in germany , with the samsung being about 10 $ more expensive . 
  i read many recommendations to go with the crucial over the samsung , mostly because of mlc vs tlc and because the crucial was substantially cheaper at the time of the review . 
  however , in most speed comparisons the samsung beats the crucial . 
  what would be your advice ? 
  my current system uses a gigabyte ga 965p-dq6 board which only features sataii , but that 's not too much of a concern since the ssd will be used in a whole new build in about a year . 
  i 'm looking for voip apps like teamspeak/mumble/zello etc. 
  that work with my car 's bluetooth hands-free ( bmw 3 series e91 ) . 
  does anyone have experiece with this ? 
  is it even possible , or does that only work for actual calls ?
