  hi , i just moved to a new appartment and practically across the street is a jacques weindepot , which is a chain of wine sellers in germany . 
  i 'm interested if they are any good or if they 're just a money grab for wanabe wine snobs . 
  anyone else comming ? 
  wan na meet up and have a beer there ? 
  i just ordered an xbox 360 controller for pc , and spintires is high on the list of games i want to play with it . 
  does the game have analog throttle and brakes yet ? 
  i know it did n't have that in the beginning . 
  any other cool new features ? 
  i maninly played the game shortly after release . 
  a friend of mine dropped her s3 and the screen broke . 
  she gave it to me so i can try and recover the photos from it . 
  phone status :, 
  * screen black, 
  * soft-keys light up when i press the big button, 
  * usb debugging not enabled, 
  * pin lock , 6 digits , i have the code, 
  * no sd card in phone, 
  * no sim card in phone, 
  * phone not connected to wifi, 
  my plan is to use samsung kies or just plain old windows explorer to get the files . 
  however , i need to unlock the phone for that to work . 
  i have a usb otg adapter so i can connect a mouse and/or keyboard to it . 
  however , i 've never owned a samsung phone , so i do n't know what i have to do to get to the pin entry field . 
  can anyone who has an s3 tell me the exact sequence ? 
  also , i 'm not sure if the touchscreen still works , any way to check that ? 
  edit : another idea , the phone looks like it did n't take all that much of a beating , maybe it 's just a disconnected cable inside ? 
  edit2 : i also have a mhl hdmi adapter , but from what i 've gathered i 'd need a special samsung one . 
  mine does not work with the phone . 
  in light of the recent events i 'd like to buy this historic issue . 
  hi , does anyone have any info on the config used in [ this ] ( http://dwm.suckless.org/screenshots/dwm-20120806.png ) screenshot from the [ example screenshot page ] ( http://dwm.suckless.org/screenshots/dwm-20120806.png ) of dwm ? 
  i 'm mostly interested in the color scheme and the status bar at the top . 
  i know this is not directly related to arch , but i think this is one of the best places to ask this . 
  i really like the ubermacht oracle , but every time i 've trackered & insured one in gta online it got replace with an ubermacht oracle xs after a while . 
  does anyone know if this can be prevented somehow ? 
  title says all i guess . 
  the key for the sneak peek also gave me 3 sneak peek passes for distribution among friends . 
  but i have no clue what the other key is for . 
  i tried buying a compendium in game , but when i clicked `` checkout '' it did n't load . 
  after closing dota i still have it in my cart on the dota2 store website . 
  i ca n't remove it from my cart and trying to checkout results in the following error :, 
   error, 
   there seems to have been an error initializing or updating your transaction . 
  please wait a minute and try again or contact support for assistance . 
   visit steam support, 
  anyone got that too ? 
  update : i could log into the account details page , and i saw a lot of failed transactions . 
  then i went back to the store and now it worked . 
  i really love the detailed models of the cars , but i do n't know of a way to really look at the details that are normally hidden under the hood and other body panels . 
  is there a way to remove them without just crashing into things ? 
  somewhat inspired by the semantic shift thread , this one is about words that originate in foreign languages . 
  my favorites which caused quite a bit of confusion while learning english are * pepperoni * and * entr\u00e9e * . 
  * pepproni * comes from the italian * pepperone * meaning bell pepper . 
  how it came to refer to salami in english is kind of weird to me . 
  this caused some confusion when i was in the us for the first time , trying to order salami pizza which is my favorite , but not seeing it on any menu , depsite several people eating it at other tables . 
  as i speak a fair bit of french using the word * entr\u00e9e * for the main course also weirds me out . 
  in french it refers to an appetizer , as * entr\u00e9e * translates to entrance . 
  as far as i know these trinkets scale to ilvl 715 on character level 100 . 
  you can see the 5 trinkets [ here ] ( http://ptr.wowhead.com/items=4.-4?filter=minle=800;maxle=800 ) . 
  are there any resources discussing their viability in the current raid tier ? 
  any way to simcraft them yet ? 
  i 'm playing warlock and i 'm wondering how to maximize my damage output in timewalk dungeons . 
  i 've noticed that the t18 4 piece bonus works well , as the chance for free chaos bolts as well as the cast time reduction are not scaled down . 
  for rings i use the ilvl 715 instead of the legendary , since it seems to scale a lot better . 
  as for weapon , i 'm currently working on getting the legendary staff , as i 've heard it scales nicely and it also has 3 gem slots . 
  which enchant would you recommend on that staff ? 
  does anyone know of any other very good gear for warlock or any other class really ? 
  the website http://www.in70mm.com/news/2016/hateful_8/index.htm does not list any screenings in munich , does anyone know if there will be any that are not listed there ? 
  [ removed ], 
  which enchants should i put on my weapons as enh . 
  shaman ? 
  currently i have mark of the bleeding hollow ( 500 mastery proc ) on both . 
  the stat priority is haste ( up to 50 % )  versatility  mastery as far as i know , but proc haste is undesirable according to many . 
  anyone know if mark of the shattered hand is better ? 
  [ armory ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/eredar/wynjin/advanced ), 
  i play a lvl 8 human ranger ( altered reign of winter campaign ) and have just gotten permission from my gm to switch to using an animal companion instead of my original choice of sharing my favored enemy bonus with the party . 
  most fitting , all though somewhat clich\u00e9 , is a wolf , so i decided to go with that . 
  now , to take better advantage of that i 'd like to replace one of my feats with the * boon companion * feat , so that my wolf is the same level as my ranger . 
  currently i have the following feats :, 
  * weapon focus : longbow, 
  * precise shot, 
  * point-blank-shot, 
  * far shot, 
  * vital strike, 
  * rapid shot, 
  i think i would best replace vital strike with boon companion , as i do n't use it often . 
  other than that , i 'm still not sure which feats my wolf should have . 
  i think * combat reflexes * and * friendly switch * would be very useful . 
  also , i read it 's possible to ride the wolf as it is a large animal after level 7 but i do n't think i want to ride it in combat , as i 'd rather have distance between me and the enemies and have the wolf in melee range tripping the enemies . 
  also , i would need some mounted combat feats to really be useful while riding the wolf , right ? 
  other than that , i might chose to ride it in non-combat situations . 
  edit : as for animal feat 3 & 4 i 'll probably use * narrow frame * and * lithe attacker * , as the large sized wolf would otherwise be severely impaired in dungeons . 
  however , i 'm not too sure about * lithe attacker * , as i 've not yet encountered a space smaller than one grid in width in our campaign . 
  any other useful animal companion feats ? 
  edit2 : * improved natural weapon * is probably the way to go instead of * lithe attacker * . 
  i 'm trying to build either [ openpht ] ( https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openpht/ ) or [ plex-media-player ] ( https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plex-media-player/ ) on my rpi2 . 
  changing the pkgbuild to include the armv7h architecture gets them to start it . 
  however , plex-media-player fails because qt5-webengine is apparently not available for arch arm . 
  openpht fails with some problems related to ffmpeg 3.0.1 , which i 've installed from extra . 
  when i let the openpht package build it 's on ffmpeg i get an error saying ` not enough space on device ' , although i have 12 gb of free storage and 1 gb of swap . 
  edit : i think my tmpfs for / tmp was too small , i 'll up it to 2gb and try again .
