  you have to specifically ask for them in stores . 
  online stores which sell them need to make sure that the customer is really 18 years or older , e.g. 
  by checking your id card upon delivery . 
  hi , thanks for the info , but i 'm gon na order the bindings elsewhere , since i live in germany . 
  thanks for all the suggestions , i 've just ordered a pair of green union force l/xl bindings . 
  why does n't your new one have the media keys ? 
  lenovo thinkpads have them and they are amazing . 
  have you tried using contacts ? 
  during holiday season it can take a while to get up there , since usually a lot of people want to go there and the lifts are kind of a bottleneck . 
  i would recommend you check it out regardless , though . 
  i can tell you how well motos fit in 2013 forces by mid this week , as soon as my new forces arrive , 
  go for renowned brands such as union , they are great and cost half of what for example burton bindings cost . 
  i just ordered a pair . 
  where 's your highback ? 
  oh , now i see it , it 's mounted far further down that i expected, 
  clean it up with a knife and some alcohol , then use epoxy . 
  if part of the core snapped epoxy is probably not gon na help . 
  yes , but my professional s has media keys , why does n't yours have them ? 
  i 've now mounted my ( old ) burton motos into the new forces , and they fit nicely . 
  i 've mounted the toe strap in the rear position , which is supposedly better for capped strapping . 
  to do that you need to remove the black bottom plate in this new version of the forces . 
  typical duck stances are -10 \u00b0 / 10 \u00b0 to -15 \u00b0 / 15 \u00b0 , but i would consider that pretty wide . 
  imho the difference should n't be more than about 20 \u00b0 -25 \u00b0 . 
  i personally use a forward stance of 15 \u00b0 / 25 \u00b0 as i 'm not that much a park rider . 
  generally you should not have your rear foot at a bigger angle than the front one . 
  your -12 \u00b0 / 15 \u00b0 stance should be ok , though . 
  you can experiment with that more as you progress . 
  also make sure to use a low/medium strength thread-locking fluid , so your screws do n't ever get loose . 
  helmet bonk , extra points if they drop afterwards . 
  heat it evenly until the wax starts to melt , then scrape . 
  i use a 2kw hairdryer for heating in that case . 
  just use an editor that can do the brackets for you ( emacs + auctex for example ), 
  what is nvidia gon na do with those ? 
  make their graphics cards slower ? 
  edit : what 's up with all those butthurt amd vs nvidia comments on this clearly humorous remark ? 
  that 's what i always wonder as well !, 
  in german we call what you linked as peperoni '' [ paprika ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/capsicum1.jpg ) '' , we usually only call the spicy ones '' [ peperoni / chili ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/charleston_hot_peppers_white_background.jpg ) '' . 
  and how they can confuse salami with vegetables goes beyond my comprehension . 
  i 've only had that with polyester blankets , wool usually does n't do that . 
  i am aware of the gpu market , but the setup for this pun was just perfect . 
  i now want pulsating lights in the base of my board , fast & furious / nfs underground style, 
  you should try x-posting this to / r/comics and / or / r/geek, 
  watch this : [ union set up clinic ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bvy8nrcg9c#t=115s ), 
  to move that toes trap on union forces you need to remove the additional plate on the bottom . 
  you are talking about the healcup ? 
  did you undo all 4 screws ? 
  you are actually obliged to clear the snow on the sidewalk in front of you house in germany . 
  post it 's is easy . 
  arial has diagonally cut t tops . 
  not opposite . 
  it points down , then to the left .

  tip for leveling : if you enter a new zone announce it in chat and ask if anyone wants to party up . 
  even 2 players is a lot more fun that solo leveling . 
  i always do this when i enter a new zone on one of my alts . 
  guild chat or http://gw2lfg.com/, 
  when you switch to text you do n't submit the link . 
  sorry to disappoint , but this image is n't real .

  usb has to actively poll your keyboard , that means it permanents keeps `` asking '' if something happened . 
  this can be a problem if the usb host the keyboard is connected to is already doing other tasks such as copying files to a flashdrive . 
  ps/2 on the other hand is interrupt based , meaning your keyboard instantly notifies your pc of an event . 
  also ps/2 provides more key rollover , meaning you can have more keys pressed at the same time and they are still properly registered . 
  i do n't know how this works for mice , though . 
  why would it not work in pdf ? 
  you can write a parser for . doc files or for pdf , it 's not that much difference . 
  you can also nicely setup such a scripted system with tex and pdflatex , which would be the better choice imho . 
  if he wants 100 pennies and pays $ 2 for he is n't exactly getting a great deal ... 
  i am fully aware that $ 2 is more than 100 pennies . 
  but op wanted pennies not dollars , so he would have payed $ 2 to get 100 pennies . 
  oo i think we are talking at cross purposes . 
  as i interpret it it would go like this :, 
  op gives bank lady $ 2, 
  -  op the game . 
  you forgot the \u00b4 . 
  i did n't down vote you , i just wanted to understand what you meant , 
  `` fun '' fact : in german it 's sojaso\u00dfe, 
  ... also being dangerously close to the vehicle in front of him , assuming they are not stopping at a red light or something . 
  she 's probably a redditor , too :, 
  sit in glass corner with awesome view - face away and use mobile phone . 
  it implies you are armed as well . 
  simply speaking :, 
  you capture the encrypted handshake when a device connects to the router . 
  then you can try and match that handshake with every key you try . 
  you do n't even need to be anywhere near the router once you captured the handshake . 
  you should not use the feet , they are bad for you wrists . 
  i 've seen an elderly woman wearing gloves very similar to [ these ] ( http://imgur.com/aa76mb6 ) . 
  that looks pretty bad , now far in does it go ? 
  somewhat , i just like that forward stance since i tried it out . 
  honestly , it does look weirder in the picture than it is , imho . 
  the right foot is at +25 , the left on at +5 . 
  also , i 'm still experimenting with my new bindings . 
  i had that typical -10 / +10 duck stance once , but the right side of my right foot started to hurt , because i constantly tried to turn it farther to the right . 
  ... and shop duty free . 
  we actually started out in samnaun ( the swiss part ) . 
  worst thing is , the players is n't even hosting the instance , it 's hosted on anet 's servers ... 
  oh , i somehow only linked the small version , [ here ] ( http://i5.minus.com/i26pxyegsgvsy.jpg ) is the big one . 
  r&s builds many devices in that case format . 
  have you ever used a agillent , lecroy or rohde & schwarz device ?
