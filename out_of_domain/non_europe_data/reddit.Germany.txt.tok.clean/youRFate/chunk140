  edit2 : oops , setting tmpfs to be larger than the ram is actually a bad idea . 
  need to get home before i can fix it , pi wo n't boot anymore . 
  i was going to install qt on my machine , so i did the natural thing :, 
  that however spews out about 1000 package candidates scolling past me . 
  the most interesting ones are the ones at the top , however i now ca n't scroll up far enough to see them . 
  is there a way to have yaourt heave somewhat like ` less ` , ` more ` or ` man ` , so it stops printing when the screen is full and lets me continue ? 
  piping it into ` less ` does n't help , as then i ca n't choose the packages . 
  this problem exists for many package names that are short or pacakges that are incorporated into a lot of aur stuff . 
  edit :, 
  the best solution so far is to set ` $ pager ` to ` less ` and then using ` yaourt -- pager ` . 
  this work well , it shows the search results in ` less ` and asks you for the number after you quit less . 
  i recently learned that the gin and tonic was invented by british soldiers in india , because the quinine water ( = tonic ? ), 
  tasted too bitter by itself . 
  the quinine water was consumed because it helped combat malaria . 
  do modern day tonic waters still contain an amount of quinine that would actually help against malaria ? 
  i did some tinkering with the galaxy map and came across the glusu system . 
  the a ring on the planet that has the locke hub in it 's orbit seems like a good choice . 
  so far i 've not come across any palladium or platinum though . 
  gold and silver seems abundant . 
  also the locke station space port is close by and so far sells everything i want . 
  i recently bought my python ( yay ! ) . 
  now i really like the idea of having turrets , so i mounted 2 burst laser turrets in the medium hard points , in addition to the 3 large burst lasers . 
  the problem is , i ca n't get the turrets to just attack on their own . 
  the only way i can get them to autonomously is to set them to `` target only '' , put them on secondary fire and fire them once at the target , after that they firet autonomously . 
  if i just set them to `` fire at will '' they never shoot unless i hold the button . 
  i know the target has to be red , i usually fire at them with my main weapons first , but the turrest just stay silent . 
  english : i need to register with the city . 
  according to their website there are 6 possible offices where i can do that ( see above ) . 
  does anyone know which of them has the shortest wait ? 
  i 'm looking for a file explorer that works well with sftp . 
  it must support key file authentication and download resuming . 
  right now i 'm using fx explorer . 
  i like it very much , the ui is very good and intuitive and it does support sftp with key file authentication , but it does not let you resume sftp downloads as far as i am aware . 
  it will simply start a new transfer to a renamed file . 
  anyone know a good alternative that does that right ? 
  [ removed ], 
  it 's been posted around reddit quite a few times . 
  it 's a parody of some other knife techniques video and it 's quite hilarious .

  ### build ready :, 
  i 'm planing to get a new fairly silent gaming machine . 
  it will for now be used for 1080p gaming with a montior i will carry over from my last pc , but in future new monitors and / or vr gear are planned . 
  the budget is around 2000 $ , but i 'm flexible in that regard . 
  i 'm located in germany .

  this list is missing the storage , as the new samsung 960 pro nvme ssds are not yet listed on pcpartpicker . 
  i will install a 960 pro 512 gb as well as 1 or 2 old hdds which i carry over from my old build . 
  audio hardware ( asus xonar essence stx ) will also be carried over . 
  what 's your opinion on this build ? 
  any feedback is very welcome , as i have n't planned/built a pc in years . 
  i plan on ordering that pc some time next week . 
  just for additional info , my current machine which i 'm upgrading from :, 
  * q6600 ( 4x2 .4 ghz ), 
  * 4 gb of ram, 
  * 256gb crucial ssd, 
  * gtx460 , 768mb, 
  this will be quite the upgrade ... 
  [ parts of new pc ] ( https://geizhals.eu/?cat=wl-711837 ), 
  os will be windows 10 pro . 
  my new machine is about to arrive . 
  however , the nvme ssd that i 've planned for this build ( 960 pro ) is not yet available for purchase here in germany . 
  so i will be using my old 256gb sata ssd for now . 
  as soon as the new ssd is available , i will buy one and want to then migrate my system from the old sata ssd to the new nvme drive . 
  will it work if i merely clone the drive over ( using dd from a live linux or similar ) or will i have to reinstall windows ? 
  i want to carry over the ssd from my old pc into my new pc . 
  because i still want to be able to use the old pc i decided to clone the 256gb ssd with windows 10 on it onto a 2tb hdd i have lying around . 
  as per recommendation from a few ppl i used macrium reflector to clone the ssd . 
  now , when i disconnect the ssd and try to boot the old pc from the hdd with the cloned windows on it i get [ this error screen ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tfqjksj.jpg ) . 
  translation from german :, 
   recovery ,, 
   the pc/device needs to be repaired . 
   required device is no connected or ca n't be accessed . 
   error code : 0xc000000e, 
   you need to use recovery tools . 
  if you do n't have a recovery medium , contact the pc-administrator or pc - / device manufacturer . 
  if i connect the ssd back it will boot fine . 
  i guess i will need a windows 10 installation disk to repair the cloned partition on the hdd ? 
  did i mess up the cloning process ? 
  going to bed for now , will check back here tomorrow . 
  ## [ album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lmgss ) ( excuse the mess , no time to tidy up when there is a pc to build :d ), 
  my last pc goes back to 2008/2009 and was very much showing it 's age . 
  i did upgrade it a little bit over the years , but still , it 's a mess . 
  i had framedrops even in games like wow and it just was n't really that much fun to use anymore . 
  now that i finally finished university i have rewarded myself with the gaming build of my dreams .
