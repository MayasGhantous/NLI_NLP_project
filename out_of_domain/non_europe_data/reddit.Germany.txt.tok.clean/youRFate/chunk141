  the pc will use my old ssd for now , until the samsung 960 pro nvme ssd becomes available here in germany . 
  for comparison , my old machine :,

  i have a main monitor that i use for gaming , and i have a secondary monitor off to the side where i have stuff like teamspeak / youtube / twitch.tv / irc open while i play games on the `` main monitor '' . 
  would plugging the 2nd monitor into my motherboard instead of my graphics card increase gaming performance ? 
  ( i7 6700k , gtx 1080 , z170x gaming 7 motherboard ), 
  i 'm using arch inside a virtual box vm . 
  the host is windows . 
  the network configuration in virtual box is set to bridge . 
  i have used this vm successfully for more than a year now . 
  then i updated virtualbox and now the network is causing some trouble . 
  when i start the vm i keep getting network debug messages on the login screen , about the adapter resetting every like 10 seconds . 
  after login the machine does not have a dhcp ip . 
  i 'm using systemd-network for dhcp , as i do successfully on several other machines that i run arch on . 
  this happens on every boot of the vm , however , i can fix the machine by doing, 
  sudo ip link set down enp0s3, 
  sudo ip link set up enp0s3, 
  after that all is fine and dandy . 
  the machine gets an ip from the dhcp and i can access the internet . 
  any idea what would cause that behaviour and how i can fix it ? 
  i could create a systemd service that does the ip link down/up stuff , but that seems like a bad way to fix that to me . 
  virtualbox version is 5.1.10 r112026, 
  arch is up to date , typically updated at least once a month . 
  # update / solution :, 
  as / u/bbq92 [ stated ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5ih8gg/arch_vm_network_showing_strange_behaviour/db9lszw/?st=iwrxdjpd&sh=cea0edc0 ) , the solution was to set the network adapter type to ` virtio-net ` . 
  this can be done using the command line as / u/bbq92 suggested , or in the gui unter settings  network  adapter type . 
  i just bought an ipad pro 12.9 '' and i want to buy a power adapter + cable for it so i can fast charge it . 
  i know that it 's possbile using the apple 29w charger + a usb-c to lightning cable . 
  however , i like anker chargers . 
  does anyone know if the ipad will fast charge using [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.de/anker-powerport-ladeger%c3%a4t-delivery-technologie/dp/b01c847nuk/ref=sr_1_5?ie=utf8&qid=1482397730&sr=8-5&keywords=anker+usb+c ) adapter with a usb-c to lightning cable ? 
  edit , update : i have since contacted anker directly , they said it 's not possible at this time . 
  is there a way to get signal on my ipad pro ? 
  i have it insatlled on my android phone , but i ca n't install the desktop app on the ipad . 
  neither can i install the regular ios app as it would unlink my phone from my signal account . 
  i 've recently bought an ipad pro and i think it could be a useful tool for playing pathfinder , maybe even a replacement for my paper character sheets . 
  i 'm currently using the [ character sheets by dyslexic studios ] ( http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/ ) which i enjoy using , but if there is something truly good on ios i would probably use that . 
  so far i 've tried [ rpg scribe ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rpg-scribe-pathfinder/id1121334119?mt=8 ) , which is good in some regards , but it lacks content , like feats from ultimate combat . 
  it also does ' t do quality of life stuff like calculating your attack bonuses when using feats like rapid shot and or point blank shot . 
  other than that it is probably an all right replacement for character sheets and it also comes with, 
  i 've also briefly tried the hero lab ios app , but it is n't optimized for the ipad pro retina screen at all , everything looks way too big and low resolution . 
  i also saw [ pfrpg rd ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pfrpg-rd/id488594793?mt=8 ) in the store , which looks like it could be a good srd app , but it does n't look like it provides any benefit over just using d20pfsrd.com in the browser appart from not needing an internet connection perhabs . 
  for general note taking and quick calculations like adding up damage i really enjoy [ nebo ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myscript-nebo-note-taking/id1119601770?mt=8 ) as it works beautifully with the apple pencil and can even do simple calculations based on scribbled numbers . 
  any other recommendations ?

  i 'm looking into buying a new monitor . 
  i 'm pretty sure i want a 27 '' , 1440p , 144hz g-sync monitor . 
  which one do you recommend ? 
  i really like the understated design of the dell s2716dg , but it 's fairly old now . 
  any good alternatives ? 
  system is a i7 6700k , gainward gtx 1080 , and 32 gb of ddr4 .
