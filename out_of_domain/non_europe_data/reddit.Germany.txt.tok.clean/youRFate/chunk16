  left windows = additional fn key is a really nice feature imho . 
  also , it has acorns instead of windows keys and a small squirrel on the enter key , i mean , how cool is that !, 
  yes , the '' ` ~ '' key is in kind of a weird position , but imho better than having it as a fn combination . 
  i really like the build quality and the pbt keycaps . 
  i have a new kbt pure pbt ( unlit ) . 
  it has the `` high '' frame that looks like the bottom one in your picture . 
  we have those in germany , at certain intersections, 
  afaik all the backlit versions have the low frame . 
  did you just repost this thread ? 
  i think n is the way to go , iirc you feel suffocation from co. 
  so they forgot to add j.d. 
  williams and then where too lazy to move the rest of the graphic to fit him in ? 
  my favorite german wheat beer is weihenstephan . 
  you will need a wheat beer glass though . 
  otherwise you really miss out . 
  demigod by behemoth, 
  here in germany bottled water is the main thing we drink . 
  but we have very high quality standards for mineral water and most germans like their water heavily carbonated . 
  the main difference is that the bottled water we buy is so called mineral water which is supposedly more healthy and tastes distinctively different from tap water . 
  probably the photographer , 
  it says gopro on the board , so it might have been a gopro , 
  and the latter is a pretty sweet band . 
  i have a kbt pure , which has a bitter shift than the race , but it 's still reduced size . 
  this is a non-issure for me , since i press that key on the left-most point anyways . 
  i just needed some time to adjust to my ~ character being right of the shift key . 
  hi , i have a esdf key cap set from wasd keyboards . 
  i do n't have this problem on my daskeyobard . 
  the e key fits in nicely with the others . 
  there is a slight hight difference between the sdf keys and ther other keys of row 2 , though . 
  but it 's marginally and i do n't notice it during normal typing . 
  look on the bottom of the key , they are labeled with the key row . 
  the w key should be labeled `` r3 '' , the others `` r2 '' . 
  you did push the key all the way down , right ? 
  because on pic 2 it looks like it 's not all the way on . 
  maybe there is a molding error on the key stem part of the key cap . 
  that was easy for me since i 'm an emacs user . 
  the logitech g710 + comes with orings installed . 
  i have never had a single problem with getting money out of my paypal account , what are you talking about ? 
  also the red color suggest the more premium stuff imho . 
  i also have the non backlit version with pbt , mine has a black pcb . 
  i bought mine off of german amazon . 
  but it looks like kbtpure.com has the same one ( amazon even copy-pasted the whole info from that page ) . 
  the `` reduced key travel distance '' makes me think they come with o-rings pre installed . 
  since they talk about tactile bump i 'm guessing it 's browns . 
  has anyone emailed them and asked what switch color it is ? 
  the first one is common sense here , it 's called parking brake in german , not emergency brake . 
  you are supposed to use it if you do n't park in a perfectly flat spot . 
  if they do n't have an arrow , then it 's the side where the gas nozzle is on the gas pump icon . 
  one of my favorite investments last year ? 
  $ 150 gw2 collector 's edition . 
  worth every cent . 
  i 've been drinking heavily carbonated mineral water pretty much all my life ( very common here in germany ) . 
  i only feel a slight cooling sensation on my tongue . 
  france , not europe . 
  an airplane going over the ocean has more influence the tides that this meteor could ever have . 
  it 's roughly 500 tons , that is nothing . 
  the iss is about 500t aswell , just for reference . 
  this will have about as much influence on the earth than a car on earth has on the moon . 
  browns do n't really click , but they are somewhat tactile . 
  if you go 200 apm in starcraft on a laptop and do n't use an external keyboard you basically just lost . 
  nice extension , i 'll definitely try that one out . 
  depends , if you have a * us ansi qwerty * , then no . 
  but i think the * iso qwerty * should work . 
  ( or all iso layout keyboards for that matter ) . 
  if you do n't care about labeling get a blank iso layout keyboard and use azerty settings on it . 
  for comparison : [ azerty ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/azerty_fr.svg ) , [ iso ( gb ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/iso_keyboard_%28105%29_qwerty_uk.svg ), 
  edit : you can get a full set of azerty keycaps [ here ] ( http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/105-key-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html ) . 
  just set the boxes corretly . 
  it will fit any iso layout 105 keycap cherry mx switch keyboards . 
  also the * us ansi qwerty * keyboards have different layouts around the enter key and miss a button right of the left shift key . 
  i think he does n't want to just swap the keys around , he wants to buy a new full azerty set and put it on a qwerty keyboard . 
  there is a qwertz ( german ) version . 
  the german layout is also fully iso compatible . 
  [ german amazon sells ] ( http://www.amazon.de/cm-storm-quickfire-tastatur-qwertz-tastatur/dp/b00ab7iwrk/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1366063370&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=cm+storm ) them , the picture is not correct . 
  yes , if it was n't reposted for the 100000th time ... 
  imho this really is n't world news unless someone got harmed . 
  ups does this here . 
  i got a notification asking me if i was home , the tuck whould arrive in 2 hours . 
  i could also postpone it to the next day . 
  look at your screen while typing . 
  problem sovled . 
  i think the loud part is the air intake / fan part . 
  you could locate that somewhere else and have it connected via tube or something . 
  more like, 
  while ( 1 ), 
  if ( light is dark ), 
  turn left, 
  else, 
  turn right, 
  i did something simmilar . 
  i arrived in london ltn , there was a big line on the european passport counters , but only like 5 ppl . 
  on a counter labled `` all international passports '' . 
  i figured `` all passports '' included my european one and went there . 
  worked like a charm . 
  how does, 
  while ( light is dark ), 
  turn left, 
  not send the command constantly ? 
  this one !, 
  that 's an enormous amount of people .
