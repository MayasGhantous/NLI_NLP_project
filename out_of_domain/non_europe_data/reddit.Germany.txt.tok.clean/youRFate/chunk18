  sorry , but i do n't want my car to smell bad . 
  deluge is great . 
  nice , i have to try those . 
  i have a windows partition for gaming and entertainment , and a fedora fel partition for work . 
  you should definitely get a decent soundcard . 
  using that kind of headphones with onboard sound solutions is not going to work nice . 
  look at the [ asus xonar essence stx ] ( https://www.asus.com/sound_cards_and_digitaltoanalog_converters/xonar_essence_stx/ ) soundcard , it has high quality converters and a nice , discrete headphone amp that can even drive 600 ohm headphones nicely . 
  this will save you the cost an additional external amp . 
  it 's also decent for gaming and even features the dolby headphone virtual surround . 
  you are easily terrified ... 
  yes , which is a shame . 
  there is a [ real budweiser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_budvar_brewery ) beer , but they somehow lost the trademark in the usa . 
  that would make the pizza even more soggy . 
  i know a place that has aluminium-foil lined pizza boxes . 
  the pizza stays warm , but becomes soggy as hell . 
  my local place makes nice pizza . 
  that place with the foil in the boxes on the other hand ... 
  i think the problem is , that they put the pizza in the box straight from the oven , while it 's still steaming . 
  and that steam makes the dough/crust go soggy because it can not be absorbed by the package in that case . 
  i just stopped ordering from that place . 
  it was n't really good anyways :d, 
  or , for that matter , wow itself . 
  playing it for the first time was a revelation . 
  if you are in germany , going slower than 180 km/h in the left lane should be a punishable offense . 
  usually it 's nitrogen , since you wo n't feel any asphyxation from it , you just black out at some point . 
  yes !, 
  i hate it when ppl just sort of point them upward instead of using the regulator dial thing . 
  i always have to rearrange them . 
  also : you do n't touch my mirror control , even if it looks like a cool litte joystick on the center console . 
  you do n't touch the mirror control joystick , you do n't open windows without asking first , you do n't dig around my glovebox . 
  and never tell me when to shift gears , ever . 
  if i 'm playing mp3s , you may change them , but only to stuff that is on my usb drive , and only in between songs . 
  if i listen to radio , you do n't change the channel . 
  my dakine porter messenger bag . 
  i 've used it from the end of my school time and all the way through university . 
  it holds my laptop and whatever i need . 
  i can totally recommend the [ asus xonar essence stx ] ( http://www.asus.de/multimedia/audio_cards/xonar_essence_stx/ ) , it 's a high quality sound card with a nice headphone amp using discrete op amps . 
  i 'm using it myself , although it currently only drives my sennheiser pc360 headset . 
  that card can nicely drive even 600 ohm headphones . 
  it has nice reviews on both head-fi and hydrogenaudio , and it 's a huge upgrade from my soundblaster x-fi go !, 
  pro ( not really surprising ) . 
  i do n't know the particular issue here since i 've never used itunes , but i generally recommend installing the open source operating system [ rockbox ] ( http://www.rockbox.org/ ) on sansa players . 
  it adds a ton of functionallity to the os and made my e280 a really nice music player . 
  turn up your speakers in some other room , 
  if you buy the card you might want to look into using [ these drivers ] ( http://maxedtech.com/asus-xonar-unified-drivers/ ) instead of the asus ones , as the asus ones sometimes have slight issues . 
  maybe some public fear mongering would get you what you want . 
  posters stating that those trains emit powerfull electromagnetic radiation in about the same band as mobile phones , but thousands of times stronger , would likely get a whole horde of people upset . 
  a really nice way to make a n bit multiplexer is the following :, 
  library ieee ;, 
  use ieee.std _ logic_1164 . all ;, 
  use ieee.numeric _ std.all ;, 
  entity mux is, 
  port (, 
  dout : out std_logic ) ;, 
  end entity mux ;, 
  architecture beh of mux is, 
  begin, 
  end architecture beh ;, 
  i just wrote this up and did not test this , but i 'm fairly certain it works . 
  if you have questions , feel free to ask . 
  the real question is which codec they use . 
  well , losless streams to mobile devices are beyond pointless , since the audio hardware in there is n't that good . 
  if you are really serious about sound quality you should probably have your own library of 24bit 48khz flac ( or similar ) files anyway . 
  just installed it , gon na try it tonight . 
  looks really promising !, 
  i have my phone plugged in over night . 
  i have never seen anyone use a check , but then again , i 'm from europe . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://what-if.xkcd.com/6/ ), 
  what 's the h for ?

  [ yea , fuck you too ] ( https://i.minus.com/ilymdipwyra7s.jpg ), 
  since the items are gone , can anyone tell me the price of the pyron flax pack ? 
  i consider buying it if it 's less than $ 10 . 
  if you want to write a \\ #hashtag on reddit , you need to escape the \\ # by using a backslash before it . 
  otherwise you get a underline . 
  that ticket is a instabuy for me . 
  especially if it comes with a courier again , that defense 3 wooly mammoth is the best :3, 
  ok , that settles it , instabuy , 
  audi offers a sun roof that partialy opens and has little fans that exchange the air in your car . 
  uses way less energy than ac , and your car is still a lot cooler . 
  they call it ` solar sunroof ' . 
  they should just put it in regular cans , you can open the bottom with a can opener . 
  in germany it 's still mostly called w-lan . 
  it will be back as soon as they reapply the fixed patch . 
  it merely does not exist in this rolled back version . 
  i often watch dotatv with the people i usually stack with . 
  when i was learning invoker i used to watch synd on player cam when he played him . 
  that 's what git is for . 
  a european example : berlin lies north of london . 
  but cuba libre means the will be slices of lime in it , whereas rum and cola is just that , rum and cola . 
  also cuba libre is made with cuban rum ( usually havana club ) . 
  at least it 's that way here in germany . 
  also , what 's your opinion on mojitos , and what do you order when you are at a bar ? 
  you can also say , `` oh , i 'm sorry , did the middle of my sentence interrupt the beginning of yours ? '', 
  razer , amd and ea, 
  hitachi is a giant corporation that makes anything from hard drives to oil tankers . 
  idk , i 'm just kind of a intel / nvidia fanboy , nothing rational , but the amd x1950 xtx graphics card in my new pc i got for christmas died one day later . 
  could n't use my gift over the holidays . 
  replaced it with a then newly released nvidia 8800 gtx , could not have been happier . 
  that was years ago , but i still hold kind of a grudge ,
