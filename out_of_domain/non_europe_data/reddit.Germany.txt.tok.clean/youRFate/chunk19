  i own a htc sensation xe that comes with beats headphones . 
  i 've recently switched from htc stock rom to cm 10.1 . 
  before the switch i was using poweramp with beats audio enabled , how i use it without it . 
  before the rom switch the sound without beats was really dull , now the sound without it is ok . 
  i really do n't like the beats stuff all that much , but i 'm using the headphones for now , because albeit not being great , they are ok and were `` free '' . 
  the difference of sound quality between my sensation xe with beats audio and my sennheiser pc360 connected to my xonar essence stx is so vast , you ca n't begin do describe it . 
  and the pc360 is a good pair of headphones , but not top tier . 
  i would watch f1 if they abandoned all rules , turning it into an engineering competition . 
  only rules like maximum size and you ca n't actively harm other drivers/cars , but none of the other crap . 
  if drivers were required , then they would lose the race by doing that . 
  remote or computer controlled cars would be a cool option , too , i suppose . 
  i use [ gosugamers ' gosubet ] ( http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/gosubet ) system to see upcomming matches , other than that i do n't really use other websites all that much ( for dota ) . 
  texas instruments : people think we actually make a significant portion of our revenue with calculators . 
  i always had my swiss army knive in my pocket in elementary school , secured with a small chain . 
  nobody was ever concerned . 
  i 'm also using poweramp and i have never had problems playing any flac files . 
  you can probably just plug your hd555 back into it . 
  it 's only a adapter from the bigger 6.3 mm trs plug that is attached to the cable of you headphones to a smaller 3.5 mm trs plug that is used in mainstream audio gear . 
  first , i recommend using [ these 3rd party drivers ] ( http://maxedtech.com/asus-xonar-unified-drivers/ ) . 
  also , did you change the bitrate in the windows settings ? 
  i found that breaks the bargraphs of the stock xonar driver . 
  that is implied , gg branches are the most cost-effective item , if you disregard `` special effects '' . 
  i have actually played a dota1 match with someone who bought 2 boots , a claymore , a stout shield and a helm of iron will and then asked which breastplate to go for . 
  he thought my mkb on drow was useless because she is ranged . 
  i explained a lot that game ... 
  bought in melee mode ofc . 
  if you want a bass-heavy pair of headphones i 'd recommend going for beyerdynamic dt 990 pro . 
  i 'm currently contemplating buying them aswell , as they have stellar reviews . 
  also they are pretty cheap for the level of quality they offer . 
  [ beyerdynamic dt 770 pro ] ( http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/dt-770-pro.html ) . 
  they are closed and very big , also they feature heavy bass . 
  you would need to flex your budget upward a little bit . 
  you would need to check if your source is capable of driving a pair of 250 ohm headphones . 
  edit : i just saw they are also available in 80 ohm . 
  [ beyerdynamic dt 770 pro ] ( http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/dt-770-pro.html ) . 
  they are closed and very big , also they feature heavy bass . 
  they are available in 250 or 80 ohm , depending on what source you have at hand . 
  there is also a dt 770 m version which is supposedly even more isolated , but i have read that they do n't sound very good . 
  that link is to the 250 ohm version , for which you should get an amp . 
  the 80 ohm version should work without an amp , but can be a bit quiet ( depends on what source you have ) . 
  i personally do not own a pair of beyerdynamics ( yet , soon to change ) , but i 've heard they can be a bit hard to drive . 
  generally higher impedance ( more ohm ) headphones + amp is considered to sound better . 
  i personally have a soundcard with a good built-in headphone amp ( xonar essence stx ) . 
  as for ath-m50 vs beyer , see [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1axiuy/final_decision_audiotechnica_athm50_or/ ) . 
  basically the beyer is more comfortable and sounds better , whereas the m50 is more portable . 
  sorry , as i 've stated i use the amp that is built-in on my soundcard . 
  the one amp that i see posted often as the to-go amp in he lower price segemnt is the schiit magni , but that thing runs for about $ 100 . 
  what is your current signal chain ( soundcard etc. 
  does anyone know what it really is ? 
  simply said impedance of headphones ( measured in ohm ) describes how much `` load '' the headphones put to the amplifier . 
  your headphone amplifier needs to be capable of driving that much load , so a pair of 250 ohm headphones needs a stronger amplifier than a pair of 32 ohm headphones . 
  a nice and more in-depth writeup can be found [ here ] ( http://www.head-fi.org/a/headphone-impedance ) . 
  a pair of 32 ohm headphones can be driven by pretty much all soundcards on their own , 80 ohm is where you start to need a headphone amp , and 250 ohm headphones really suffer without an amp . 
  generally , higher impedance headphones can be controlled more accurately and therefore usually feature more precise sound . 
  as for the weight , it says 380 grams , i think that is including cable . 
  concerning your edit : that amp should be capable of driving the 250 ohm headphones . 
  is there any data on when the 4.0 version will be released and what features it will have ? 
  i 'm currently looking into buying a 3.0 . 
  if you are in europe , you can buy several high end headphones at [ thomann.de ] ( http://www.thomann.de/ ) , they offer 3 year warranty for all products they sell . 
  they also have free shipping in germany . 
  yes , but my card is on the compatible list . 
  i like the sleeker look and the noise cancellation . 
  only thing that deters me is the warranty thing . 
  i 'll contact them if they would replace my 3.0 with a 2.0 if it breaks . 
  i have not seen superlux headsets before . 
  are those copies of beyerdynamic headphones with a microphone attached ? 
  not getting an amp will severely limit your choices , since you need to watch out what impedance the headphones have . 
  you should look for headphones that have 50 ohm or less of impedance . 
  also onboard sound will limit the quality to some extent . 
  the standard recommendation here are the ath m50 headphones . 
  i have not heard them myself yet , but i think they suit your needs , you should maybe look into those . 
  they are easy to drive because of `` only '' 32 ohm impedance , so they would work without an amp . 
  i do n't know the hfi-780s . 
  guacamole on hamburgers , best combo ever . 
  had that once at a hard-rock cafe and love it since . 
  i consider starting to watch it , where should i start ? 
  i 'd say eclipse with pydev if you really want a ide , or one of the 2 big editors ( emacs or vim ) . 
  i 've seen a post in a thread like this where someone had `` foreigner '' tattooed in japanese on his shoulder . 
  looks promising . 
  my dt 990 pros are in the mail , have to collect them from the post office later , ca n't wait :3, 
  what happened to them ? 
  i just bought a pair of [ beyerdynamic dt 990 pro ] ( http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/hah/headphones-and-headsets/studio-and-stage/studio-headphones/dt-990-pro.html ) headphones . 
  they are very high quality , over the ear , open headphones with great bass . 
  i have not recieved them yet , i will pick them up at the post office today . 
  important : do you have an amp ? 
  the 250 ohm version of these needs some amplification . 
  the 32 ohm version is part of the * edition * series , not the * pro * series . 
  the pro series cheaper , the edition series is supposed to look nicer . 
  but there is a 80 ohm version of the dt 990 ** pro ** , which costs the same as the 250 ohm . 
  post office was closed when i got home from work : / , gon na pick them up today . 
  can you give us some more information :, 
  * do you want to use them at home or on the go ? 
  * what source do you want to use them with ? 
  * do you have an amp ? 
  * what kind of sound to you like ( flat or dynamic ? ), 
  i went to a university cinema yesterday and they showed an ad called `` super sexy cpr '' , go google it , 
  ok , just got them . 
  first impression : the treble is really dominant , fixed that in foobar 's eq , will get a better eq some time in the future . 
  really nice bass for listening to dnb , but not overflowing , they are really fun for jazz and metal as well . 
  also they are amazingly comfortable .
