  ehm , you know the `` president '' of germany is a woman , too right ? 
  imho it 's his own fault . 
  police told 'em to leave like for hours and they did not . 
  he got a unlucky hit by a waterthrwoter , but he was not even supposed to be there . 
  connect to nerd.nu :1337, 
  blast it with piss . 
  i remapped it to b in order to fit my wow inventory key ... 
  yo dawg , i heard you like lara croft ... 
  uhm your mine shaft is becomming smaller as you go deeper , you should have built that staircase always on the same row of blocks ... 
  nice !, 
  right after building it was spammed with a 2 trees high layer of trees which were removed my operators ... using fire !, 
  that was one hell of a fire !, 
  oh then i was mistaken . 
  but i was there when it occurred and there was a hell load of confusion ... 
  does not work here ... 
  now all we need is someone to add a small n or somethink in a skin pack and we have a win , 
  [ here you go ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thong_%28clothing%29#c-string ), 
  [ relevant . 
  sorry , i do n't remember the source , but it was posted here before . 
  tineye did not return the desired results . 
  how ? 
  this is a binary 4-bit to 7 segment circuit , if you have a way to do this easier tell me . 
  upvote for liking electrical engineering , i can tell you it rocks . 
  [ vhdl ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vhdl ) that would rock so hard if anyone did a converter ... 
  and we need an option called `` ultra gore '' : , 
  my winamp does the job ... 
  but you can not change the audio device it uses , it will always use the default one [ ] ( / fu ) [ ] ( / futext ), 
  i have to cite [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thong_%28clothing%29#c-string ) article again i guess ... 
  creator here , it 's pretty messy inside since i made it from scratch , might do a `` clean '' version for explanation if requested , but the concept is pretty simple ... 
  why ? 
  like this it 's hard to explain how it works ... 
  you cant see a single piece of redstone form where you operate the lock , alle the circuits are hidden . 
  ( in this case i left a entrance for demonstration , normally i would block it with obsidian ), 
  obsidian saves  , also he could just destroy the door ... 
  that would take longer than it takes to build the lock though ... 
  there is one , i figured it out some time ago , but i do n't have a phone with a cord anymore ... 
  afaik it represents the position mark on top of a potentiometer volume control , since old radios were turned on by turning the volume above 0 . 
   oops !, 
   this account 's public links are generating too much traffic and have, 
   been temporarily disabled !, 
  pretty neat , but the problem with this lock is , that the combination does not reset it self . 
  i might do a video sowing my version which i had built in 4 and 8 bit versions on c.nerd.nu , if requested , but it takes a bit more space ( but can and will be completely hidden ) . 
  sure , but in my version it resets automatically as soon as you enter the building . 
  here in germany i really have no limit at all :  25mbit/s dsl here . 
  i , too , am cancer free . 
  now i would like to have my upvotes please . 
  that is about synonymous ... 
  having a full inventory saves your life , but also prevents you from stealing anything important :d, 
  @op : obvious troll is obvious ... 
   '' [ ... ] rotated the square-shaped shreddie by 90 degrees , [ ... ] '', 
  wrong subreddit ... kinda ... 
  but i bet the scholars over at / r/shittyadvice might have a solid and elaborate solution for your problem . 
  that would cause them do have different levels of brightness due to the fact that different colors have different voltage drops . 
  i love the microchip eval kit in the background , 
  electrical engineering & information technology student here, 
  oops , you are right ... , 
  also , you can tell it is in fact parallel by looking at the poles of the battery , there are way to many connections soldered there for the leds to be in series . 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  i 've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can . 
  can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that ? 
  my guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want , it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like . 
  it 's just common sense . 
  edit : oops that other guy was faster ^ ^, 
  squidward tentacles !, 
  this is the / thread comment , came to post it , 
  he probably took a screenshot and photoshopped the results in ... 
  also , combining 3 dyes to a new color should reward 3 dyes of the new color . 
  but there was also [ this incident ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_hollywood_shootout ) where the robbers wore armour that the police was not able to penetrate . 
  megadeth did a song about it ( `` 44 minutes '' on the 2009 's `` endgame '' album ) . 
  black chainsaw, 
  i think you should not have controlled it that way . 
  hooking it up to a 4-bit binary decoder would be coole . 
  symbols would then reach from `` 0 '' to `` f '' using only 4 swiches for imput . 
  but cool for a first project nervertheless . 
  was n't that `` cpu '' just an ripple-carry-adder ? 
  or does it have real cpu features now like instrucktion sets , addressed memory and selectable functions ? 
  problem with that is you would need to have a really constant frequency generator for the clock ... 
  hmm i think all corresponding segments would light up , since i guess the outputs of the switches are just all wired up to the right segments , and 2x logic high will make it light up . 
  your suggestion would incorporate some xor like connection in there ... 
  i guess the frequency generator would be greatly impacted by the performance of your game ( fps drop = clock freq . 
  drop ) and therefore the clock would never be exact ... 
  i might be able to help you with this , just pm me ^ ^, 
  [ original source of gif ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr-e47fi3mg ), 
  much better , especially the reaction of the staff , she places the gasoline spigot back in place and walks away ... 
  yes i watch them since he announced to reddit that he will start a let 's play ^ ^, 
  considering he probably wants to hook up several computers we should have several thousand watts of power ( about 350w-500w per pc ) , that would lead to at least around 100a , which is pretty much ... 
  imho the fastest way is to fill it with planks and light them ... 
  you build the glass outline underwater ( which will be filled with water then ) and fill it out with wood plank blocks . 
  then you take cover and light the wood . 
  i would still think it is superior to the sand method even if the giant fire was be the only reason ^ ^, 
  yea i just got my altera / terasic de0 board ( cyclone iii fpga ) , so this could be usefull , 
  more like : `` good luck , hi reddit ! '', 
  is there a mirror somewhere ? 
  i do n't like to log in via facebook ... 
  what type of fpga and eval board do you use ? 
  edit : ah ok i thought you were asking about fpga design information . 
  i have not yet designed pcbs for fpgas and i have only used altera devices so far ... 
  i have a [ qnap ts-110 turbo nas ] ( http://qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=136 ) w / a 2tb hitachi deskstar 7k2000 drive and this nas rocks . 
  i use it for file access from anywhere , e.g.
