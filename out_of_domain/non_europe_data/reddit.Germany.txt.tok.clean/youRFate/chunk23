  would n't lauching one probably break you house ? 
  yeah , read that title again . 
  i know what they are for , i just wanted to make a pun about the lends getting bloody when fighting someone ... 
  apart from the joke , this is actually a great way for woodwind instrument players to practice steady airflow . 
  ` van ' is not a german nobility particle , the german one is ` von ' . 
  [ tastypctv ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/tastypctv ) , her name is lauren , and if you are into custom gaming pcs , watercooling etc. 
  you 're in for a treat . 
  that depends . 
  the pro version is available in 80 and 250 ohm , the edition version is available in 32 , 250 and 600 ohm . 
  best for those sources would be the 32 ohm , but the edition series is a lot more expensive for no real benefit . 
  also those sources would not drive to to the full potential , not even close . 
  if you use them at home , why would you want on-ear ? 
  on-ear puts pressure on your ear and is no where near as comfortable as over-ear headhones , especially if you wear glasses . 
  dt 770s are really comfortable , but they would require an amp , especially if you want the full bass response . 
  i heard the q701 is a bit light on the bass , i do n't think they are the suited headphones for more modern music . 
  analog hameg hm 203-6 oscilloscope . 
  about 30 years old . 
  if you do n't want to buy an amp and still want bassy headphones i 'd recommend the v-moda crossfade m-100 . 
  they have a really low impedance of 32 ohm , which will work fine without an amp . 
  if you get an amp then i 'd recommend the dt 770 pro or dt 990 pro, 
  braun was really famous for their design . 
  what 's the thing in the top center ? 
  that looks amazing , i want to have that open at work now . 
  coleman tents are really nice , i would get one , but since i use mine on several metal festivals i just ca n't justify buying an expensive tent . 
  mods used :, 
  * [ ** kw rocketry ** ] ( http://kerbalspaceport.com/0-18-1-kw-rocketry-overhauled/ ) contains the bigger tanks and engines, 
  * [ ** mechjeb 2.0.8 ** ] ( http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/12384-plugin-part-0-19-anatid-robotics-mumech-mechjeb-autopilot-v2-0-2 ) used to plan and execute maneuvers, 
  * [ ** subassembly saver/loader ** ] ( http://kerbalspaceport.com/subassembly-saver-loader/ ) i designed the lander and the lifter separately and put them toghether using this mod, 
  things i would change for the next flight :, 
  * lander does not need that much rcs fuel, 
  * more parachutes , dropable lander engines, 
  * fuel was pretty tight , maybe refuel the second stage before leaving for mun, 
  * take a rover to mun,

  the moon orbiting kerbin ? 
  do all the different docking ports dock simultanously ? 
  for on the move i 'd go with dt 770 pro , since they are isolated . 
  depending on which version you buy you should invest in an amp , though . 
  the dt770 is a bit bassier : http://www.headphone.com/buildagraph.php?graphid[0]=713&amp;graphid[1]=963&amp;graphid[2]=&amp;graphid[3]=&amp;scale=30&amp;graphtype=0&amp;buttonselection=update+graph, 
  i would personally sugest the dt 990 pro , since they are more comfortable than the dt 770 pro ( open , less clamp ) but have the same if not even better sound . 
  how are they allergic to launch clamps ? 
  i have n't yet tried to attach launch clamps to them , i always had srbs around that i attached them to . 
  do you have a portable amp ? 
  if you do i 'd recommend beyerdynamic dt 770 pro . 
  is that $ 400 including amp or is that separate ? 
  do yu have an amp ? 
  if not you should probably look into it , as most high-end headphones require amplfication . 
  for maximum comfort full-size i can really recommend beyerdynamic . 
  love my dt 990 pros . 
  iirc that is n't just a keyboard , that 's the whole music computer . 
  i really like it . 
  i slightly toned down parts of the treble ( ~ 8khz ) , now i dare say it 's perfect . 
  they have just the right amount of bass for me . 
  listening to good metal like megadeth is really fun on these , but they are also great for jazz or classical music . 
  they are nice for dnb etc. 
  aswell , but i like to listen to that kind of music on a system that has a subwoofer , so i can feel it . 
  the leds are in the switch housing , but they are separately soldered to the pcb ( the legs stick out the bottom of the switch ) . 
  on a different note , i do n't like desktop mics , especially if you use a 5.1 setup during the day you will get echo . 
  have a look at the modmic . 
  i use the xonar essence stx as well and imho it 's a sound solution . ^ pun ^ ^ intended, 
  do n't buy beats , go for klipsch . 
  i use the beyerdynamic dt 990 pro with it , and i really like that combo . 
  it 's about a 50/50 deal here in germany , all fast food place ( mc donalds , bk etc. ), 
  ask you if you want ketchup or mayo with your fries . 
  how many soldier do you need to defend paris ? 
  nobody knows , since no one ever tried . 
  you say properly , but they are reversed !, 
  for the love of god , remove that protective foil from the silvery bits !, 
  i just ordered a modmic 3.0 , which is directional and has passive noise canelling . 
  i 'll report back as soon as it arrives . 
  afaik the mmx300 is a dt770 edition 80 ohm with an attached mic . 
  bitch had it comming . 
  as far as i know the earpads are not easily swapable . 
  beats is the starbucks , different recipies for popular drinks , the consumers think what they sell is a real latte macciato and disregard the real deal . 
  sage goes in every field . 
  ah , k . it looked like was plastic foil on the silver parts that say `` k240 '' . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i fail to see how a editor saves a project ? 
  could n't you have used any other editor ? 
  ah , so because of syntax highlighting etc. 
  i though you meant some thing other real editors like vi or emacs could n't do . 
  what source did you use the dt770 with ? 
  even the 80 ohm version will hugely benefit from an amp . 
  in germany they are allowed to stop any car at any time without any suspicion . 
  they also regularily make use of this . 
  i have been stopped once so far and had to do a universal drug test . 
  no problems and it was all done pretty quickly . 
  that 's a reference to the game borderlands 2 . 
  i personally would use mini xlr , as it locks in place . 
  liability insurance should have covered that ... 
  german here , i stand proud . 
  minus is my hoster of choice for that , no file size limit . 
  i was just worried it might come out on it 's own , for example the spiral cable on my dt 990 pro is heavy enough to unplug a 3.5 mm jack . 
  it 's been a regulation in germany all along . 
  germany here , no refills at mcdonals , bk or subway . 
  fried chicken blends better with their food than burgers do , i guess . 
  care to explain what problems you 've run into ? 
  i like you project , 
  the dt 770 are considered to be quite power hungry , so they will probably not live up to their full potential without an amp . 
  i think the one pro will be better if you plan on using it without an amp .
