  really ? 
  i could barely hear it ... 
  you can also upload the full quality pngs directly to minus , 
  i hope there is a slartibartfast reference somewhere along the coastline . 
  =d , rather . 
  i wear relatively bulky glasses myself and i 'd recommend open back , over-ear headphones . 
  open back headphones usually do n't care for isolation at all , so they do n't apply as much clamping force . 
  also they usually have softer cushions . 
  an example would be the dt 990 pros i currently use . 
  full-sized headphones do n't usually have mics and button accessories . 
  if you wnat those i 'd go for in-ears ( iems ) . 
  etymotic produces high quality iems that have control buttons and mics . 
  i do n't think instrumentals are royalty free per default . 
  exactly what problems do you have with the glass desk ? 
  i use one myself , and i would n't like covering the nice glass look with something . 
  i use a steelseries 9hd for my mouse . 
  is you keyboard sliding ? 
  you could maybe improve it 's feet , mine does not slide ( das keyboard ) . 
  in the city i study there is a turkish fine foods store that also has a d\u00f6ner kebab booth . 
  baked-to-order flat bread , fresh meat and salads , best one i have ever eaten . 
  next time use a hoster that can support that resolution . 
  if imgur did n't compress and crop images it would be pretty much perfect . 
  but as-is i prefer minus.com . 
  made by * giuseppe sanmartino * in 1753 , it 's located in the * cappella sansevero * in naples , italy . 
  sorry if i 'm not informed , but why do n't you use satellite ? 
  here ( germany ) if you do n't like to pay for cable you just get a satellite dish . 
  they have hundreds of free channels , many even in hd . 
  bales of hay are actually pretty heavy . 
  a 1,2 m x 0,7 m x 2,5 m bale of hay weights about 420 kg . 
  he should really change that ... 
  does n't the chlorine harm them ? 
  also , cat hair on books ? 
  what about allergic people ... 
  there is also no branding on the image ... 
  no , there is actually a reason for that with guinness . 
  the cans contain a so called [ widget ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/widget_%28beer%29 ) which creates the signature foam consistency . 
  the bottles nowadays usually lack that widget . 
  why is it that coal bags are the only thing that sewn shut like that ? 
  i think i 've never seen any other product packaged like that . 
  according to the end credits he made it himself ... 
  if i was being overtaken by a road train i would rethink the speed at which i am going ... 
  i really like [ torx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torx ) , everybody started to use them pretty much exclusively here . 
  i have never seen a robertson screw in germany . 
  transparent lego space logo ( too big for imgur ) : http://i2.minus.com/i8zeqycbk7l7h.png, 
  source : http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=3960099, 
  it 's on display at the [ deutsches museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsches_museum ) in munich . 
  i highly recommend visiting it . 
  15khz is neither above the nyquist limit of a 44,1 khz cd recording , nor is it above the human hearing spectrum , so it should probably even be present in mp3 versions . 
  the frequency is 15khz , that is perfectly audible ... 
  agreed , bad title , 
  i usually try to only use the big docking ports , they are a lot more stable . 
  beautiful, 
  the probably huddled together out of fear while it was still flying and died on impact . 
  those have got to be the worst buttons ever . 
  yep , 
  fun stream , keep it up  . 
  ^ ( except for the part where you say brb and never come back , but nvm ), 
  oh , then i was afk longer than you were , the stream was down for me when i came back . 
  maybe i would have had to reload it ... 
  wow , that was simply beautiful . 
  i bought the album after the video because i liked that song , 
  the lego space image can be found in my [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kspflags/comments/1iovuc/kingdom_of_w%c3%bcrttemberg_colors_and_the_old_lego/ ) over at / r/kspflags, 
  i have learned manual docking since the release of 0.21 by building [ this thing ] ( http://imgur.com/a/paabd ) . 
  it 's faster and uses less rcs than mechjeb . 
  despite that i 'm still going to install mechjeb again mostly for the statistics and because i like smart a.s.s. 
  and the translatron . 
  i do n't like fully automatic autopilots anymore . 
  jet engine exhausts have always fascinated me . 
  i relly like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/j58_afterburnert.jpeg ) picture . 
  [ direct video link without the blogspam ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41u78qp8nbk ), 
  we have one that has two of those handles . 
  the upper one is for the blades , the bottom one is for the powered wheels . 
  remoulade would not fit the heinz line , as a real remoulade is not a homogenous sauce , it contains herbs and sometimes pickles ( at least in germany ) . 
  it 's like some kind of refined mayonaise , with fresh spices and herbs added . 
  i do n't mean to offend , but i 'm curious as to how one manages to lose a chair ? 
  katamari damacy . 
  i do n't like the white outline around the kerbals , makes them look like cardboard cutouts . 
  imho you should have added docking ports between the return vehicles and the station , so you can replenish them . 
  cover the outside in quantum struts , 
  a + + , would let jeb pick again . 
  fyi , the aerospike does not need or use air intakes . 
  i like them . 
  i like everything that kills as many of those annoying cicadas as possible . 
  ultimate gaming combo imho . 
  laphroaig quater cask , that 's where it 's at . 
  tbh , i personally do n't thing it 's that peaty . 
  to my taste ardbeg ( which i also love ) is peatier . 
  here the sandwich comes wrapped in paper at subway ... 
  a couple of friends did something similar . 
  they put an old central heating radiator [ like this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/household_radiator.jpg ) on top of an oil drum with fire in it . 
  they use a garden hose pump with it . 
  works too well , they have to turn it off after a while or the pool gets too hot . 
  also the pool is made from hay bales and heavy duty plastic foil . 
  looked like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ejnr7az ) , but we did n't have digital cameras back when we did that ... 
  rural southern germany here , 
  i love how it says `` fineart america '' in the picture ^ ^, 
  it probably should be ` luftwaffles ' , as there is no h in ` luftwaffe ' . 
  this is n't facebook . 
  all of those have individual a/c units ... would n't it be a lot more energy efficient to install central a/c systems in the first place ? 
  german here , i 've only ever seen those in italy ...
