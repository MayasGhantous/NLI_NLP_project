  the toes trap issue depends on your boots . 
  also , when one of my straps broke the rep apologised and sent me two ( ! ), 
  replacements free of charge . 
  could not be happier with my forces . 
  i have the neon green , but i want to swap one with somebody so i have one green and one pink ... 
  / r/shutupandtakemymoney is the bigger one . 
  i hope you kept it plugged in ... 
  i hate the idiom `` the early bird catches the worm '' , and i always counter it with `` but , the second mouse eats the cheese . '', 
  can it create bibtex/biblatex entries ? 
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/ gives you all the help you need . 
  most people on my campus use messenger bags / big laptop bags . 
  i ca n't tell you how true that is . 
  i own a w202 and i think i have more rust than steel by now . 
  $ 10 to replace the food and repair the damage from breaking in + a night of sleep ? 
  yeah , that is the epitome of cheap . 
  edit : i get that noodles are not expensive and that they maybe did n't destroy anything , what i was trying to say is that if i did something like that i 'd leave a lot more than $ 10 , maybe about the equivalent of a hotel room with breakfast or something . 
  i hope you are aware that geneva is not in germany . 
  yes , but it should n't say `` software '' beneath it , this is clearly a hardware matter . 
  reuters is pretty good aswell , usually . 
  do n't forget :, 
  * plushy dice dangling from the rearview mirror, 
  * cheap walmart seat protectors , do n't want to ruin those seats, 
  * badly applied carbon fiber look foil on the hood , alternatively matt black, 
  * sticker of a guy peeing on something, 
  * monster energy sticker, 
  * shocker sticker, 
  * fake air intakes on the hood, 
  * air freshener, 
  * clear or smoked rear lights, 
  * stick-on led daytime lights, 
  * evil headlight eyelids, 
  * blue tinted fake-xenon hid headlight light bulbs, 
  and they both look like the mercedes [ e-class ] ( http://imgur.com/3bwgamt ), 
  just because wingspan sounds cooler and some sports people use it does n't make it the correct term , 
  this is one of my favorites so far :d, 
  could have put the integer declaration into the loop statement ... 
  i 'm 23 and i do n't like it , but i have n't tried it in a while . 
  but honestly , i do n't want to . 
  i see so many people practically addicted to it and i live fine without it . 
  that bird would not live to see another day if that was my car . 
  a piece of toast with a slice of chester cheese . 
  topped with a spash of spiced tomato sauce , 2 slices of pepperoni and some processed shredded cheese . 
  that room is too small for those speakers , but the speakers themselves are not that big ... 
  what 's the asteroid hangar ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but you ca n't upgrade your hangar unless you get a bigger ship ... 
  and then start complaining about the view asap . 
  i would say , without knowing more about it yet , that the cutlass would outperform the 325a and possibly the hornet . 
  you could also transfer the money to someone who wants to upgrade and have them give you the cash back . 
  many people are complaining about the visibility from inside the freelancer 's cockpit . 
  basically , two of the struts are right in the field of view and that causes differentiating opinions . 
  you could also melt you freelancer , add $ 70 more , and get the rear admiral package , 
  only the aurora cl has more cargo capacity than the 300/325 . 
  and as far as i know there is currently no way to buy a aurora cl . 
  idk . 
  the cutlass has a the same amount of guns as the 300 series + a turret and it is probably more maneuverable , having more thrusters . 
  also , the hornet that is currently available for sale does not come with the turret . 
  seeing that i think the cutlass would be a hard competitor to both of them . 
  this picture strangely shook me , like i knew that place , then i asked my parents about it and they told me we were then when i was a child and looked over that edge . 
  i would just cut the back corner of that lid, 
  are you a subscriber or how do you have access to that information ? 
  [ their website ] ( http://www.savaitaliano.com/ ) , it states they are located in amarillo , tx . 
  their menu does look pretty nice and not really expensive . 
  also :, 
   10 % off food sales with military id, 
  is this a thing in the us ? 
  i 've never seen something like that here . 
  i have never been to a restaurant where they did the ` x. 95 ' thing . 
  does such a place really exist ( apart from fast food places ) ? 
  why a new name ? 
  sava italiano sound pretty nice imho . 
  `` this album is empty '', 
  i think i 've never seen it here in europe . 
  germany, 
  germany, 
  it 's neither , it 's just a made up name i think . 
  the french word you men is probably * \u00e7a va ? 
  * , which translates roughly to * how 's it going ? 
  this is law here in germany . 
  i was really confused in the us , where every place states prices without tax ... 
  germany, 
  if you want your original content , but with the 325a , do the following :, 
  * reclaim you 325a for store credit in [ your hangar ] ( https://robertsspaceindustries.com/account/pledges ), 
  * buy the [ arbiter - lti ] ( https://robertsspaceindustries.com/store/168-arbiter-lti ) * package from the pledge store , ** make sure you apply the store credits during checkout !, 
  * you should now have the 325a including alpha & beta access and all the other goodies what came with your bounty hunter package . 
  ** link might not work if you are not a veteran backer *, 
  the old digital bounty hunter - lti is still available for $ 65 [ here ] ( https://robertsspaceindustries.com/store/132-digital-bounty-hunter-lti ) . 
  the arbiter - lti package is only $ 15 more expensive . 
  why are you stuck ? 
  you can always add $ 10 more and get the arbiter - lti package . 
  there is , quite literally , a huge [ burning man ] ( http://imgur.com/lbzgcwd ) . 
  ... 5 ) and it 's been reposted a thousand times . 
  1 ) go to germany, 
  2 ) order legal beer at 16 ( 15 if you have your parents with you and they consent ), 
  i do n't care about if it 's true or not , i just hope a lot of people believe this stuff is actually in all pools , everywhere . 
  in germany the have separate cabins and no one can come in with you / look at your ballot . 
  it 's all very secretive . 
  that guy looking at the lady 's ballot is really weird to me . 
  you would n't wear a shirt over it , i guess ... 
  a spreading infection from an unexpectedly dirty telephone . 
  finally !,
