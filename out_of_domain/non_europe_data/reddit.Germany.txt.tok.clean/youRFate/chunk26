  ca n't wait until i can use my unlimited data while on vacation in some other european country . 
  that triangle thing is called a [ penrose triangle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penrose_triangle ) , and it was most likely photoshopped in there , not achieved through any physical lens modification or similar . 
  it looks to me as if they cut out the different sides of the penrose triangle from the original foto and replaced it with the same photo , just shifted in a different direction for each face . 
  nice , but imho it looks even nicer without the black outlines . 
  that 's not the point , the post is about the handwriting being particularly good , but there are some flaws , for example the small n :, 
  in `` syngar '' it looks normal , on the end of `` skogen '' it looks like a small u, 
  could you elaborate further or is it a secret project you do n't want to share publicly ? 
  germany here , get on my level : http://i.imgur.com/jzgz6zn.jpg, 
  the picture would n't load while the modem is still negotiating the connection ... 
  i 've nerver bought a printer that did n't come with a cord . 
  i 'm in germany , all printers i have ever bought for myself or for friends and family came with power cord , usb cable and lan cable ( if it 's a network printer ) . 
  i 've bought epson , hp , brother and canon printers . 
  it 's nice to have cord even thought the printer is wireless , since most printer software transmits the wireless essid and key to the printer during setup via usb , so i do n't have to set those on the small fiddly printer screen ... 
  if i was you bf you would be receiving that sweater in the mail withing the next week . 
  i get `` i like your glasses '' sometimes , it 's nice . 
  can i get this in high quality anywhere ? 
  i 'd like to print it for out conductor . 
  it speaks for you society if even your lowly warriors can read/write ... 
  maybe that 's the child-friendly version of it . 
  tornado of souls on rust in peace . 
  also it probably reached the correct age and deliciousness . 
  they are actually the same dog , the one in your picture just uses conditioner . 
  is n't it customary to order 1 pizza per person ? 
  at least that 's what we do ... 
  do n't forget [ this beauty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/edux7tz.jpg ) . 
  does n't seem to have worked very well ... 
  i 'm going out on a * limb * here , but you are german , are n't you ? 
  why does the smart say you 're a dick ? 
  does it have a bad reputation in your country ? 
  there are several ships like that . 
  the smaller ones are the drake cutlass and the misc freelancer , which both have a crew of 2 , but can also be used alone , but probably less effectively . 
  the rsi constellation has a crew of 4 , 1 pilot , 2 turret gunners and 1 for other tasks that are not yet detailed . 
  and then there are ** really ** big ships like the bengal carrier , that can have a crew of several hundred players . 
  more details on the currently confirmed player obtainable ships [ here ] ( https://robertsspaceindustries.com/ship-specs ) . ^ ( i hope this link works without an account ... ), 
  755 is the maximum crew , i do n't think it requires even 10 % of that to be fully operational . 
  imho they count the pilots of the ships in it 's hangar as crew . 
  there has been some talk about rio jobs , like assisting navigation / communication / weapon systems etc. 
  also there are 2 additional `` captain '' seats on the bridge of the constellation . 
  citing rob irving :, 
   `` just to clarify , i was asking if sc it self will use complex systems such as the ones we see in modern flight sims when it comes to detection and firing solutions and guidance . 
   thank you '', 
    designopotamus | robirving said :, 
    in a word , yes !, 
  according to jump point the top gunner is standing . 
  there are definitely 2 gunners . 
  the only gripe i have with that is that it looks like the pilot ca n't get up from his seat and roam the ship . 
  other than that i 'm super stoked to see it released . 
  page 21 :, 
   the bottom gunner is in, 
  a more seated position than, 
  the standing pose of the, 
  top gunner ... 
  also you can see him standing on page 19 and 20 . 
  the jump point magazine is only available to rsi subscribers . 
  every movie longer than 2 hours has an intermission in all cinemas i 've ever been to ( germany ) . 
  they have the same name in german and many other languages . 
  they are called `` champignons '' here . 
  nope , champignon in german is not just mushroom . 
  see the [ german wiki ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/champignons ) , champignon refers to the * agaricus * family of mushroom , which contains the button mushroom . 
  the german version of the linked article , which refers specifically to * agaricus bisporus * is named `` zucht-champignon '' , which translates to `` cultivated-champignon '' in english . 
  champignon means mushroom in french . 
  the german word for mushroom is `` pilz '' .

  i find bitkinex to be superior to cuteftp . 
  it can also do segmented sftp with as many concurrent connections as you like . 
  careful , if you 're not an original backer then the pirate pack does n't contain the game / alpha / beta !, 
  all is well then  . 
  i 'm `` only '' a veteran , and originally i wanted to upgrade to pirate from bounty hunter , but then i realized that i did n't have a game package anymore . 
  so i decided to buy an additional arbiter package because i really like the 325 as well  . 
  thanks doge, 
  wow,

  for some time i used songs i like as alarm tunes . 
  had to stop doing that because it makes me hate my favorite songs ... 
  wow i 'm really impressed . 
  if you 've ever driven a 30 \u00b0 banking in an off road car you would never think a bus could to that . 
  edit : i 'm aware how the physics of stability work . 
  what i meant to say is 30 \u00b0 feels like a lot even in an off road car , i would not have thought a double-decker bus would be capable of that . 
  i know about physics of stability , but thanks , 
  did n't planet earth say the floor is entirely bat shit and overcrowded with bugs ? 
  boot the kaspersky rescue disk/stick . 
  that should solve the problem . 
  that 's sunglasses sloth . 
  should have changed it to `` you 're '' , just to mess with people . 
  this is glorius . 
  imho you would need a docking collar for that , not just a docking port . 
  you would first need a size adapter , as the 300i has a docking port that is a lot smaller than the lift of the conni ... 
  could someone that owns the constellation and the freelancer put a video together that showcases the new features ? 
  maybe they are cheap to get because of this ... 
  i read `` frags '' and was really confused ... 
  the constellation is arguably better for trading and exploration than the freelancer .
