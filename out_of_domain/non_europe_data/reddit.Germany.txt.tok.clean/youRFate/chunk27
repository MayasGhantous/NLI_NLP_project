  sitting in someone elses car and it is apparent that they have downloaded all the music on their mp3 radio / ipod / whatever from youtube . 
  the distinct sound of compressed mp3s somehow drives me nuts . 
  probably true , especially if you exchange the stock tr5 with tr6 thrusters . 
  truth is , nobody really knows anything , but boy do we like to speculate !, 
  that being said , i would n't sweat it .

  says the freelancer owner :d . i really like how emotional everybody gets about their ship of choice . 
  i think he 's talking about the steam coming out of the train whistle , no the smoke from the firebox . 
  that train definitely has a worse carbon footprint than any modern passenger airplane .

  it is doing less damage than air travel in general , but a jet would be the more environmentally friendly way of travel non the less . 
  fuck people who try to hop on in the last second , after the driver said `` please stand back '' . 
  repost from only like 2 days ago ... 
  that looks like a lot of effort for something you could have written in a small amount of behavioral vhdl .

  i know , xcusemewtfudoin editied his comment to say,

  so now it 's for you to decide if the op of the whole thread or the op of this comment thread is the bundle of sticks . 
  in munich not so much , the police are pretty anal about it . 
  what 's the problem with veal ?

  / r/cheeseburgers, 
  guacamole is the single best thing you can put on a burger , ever . 
  cement and powdered sugar . 
  the quater cask has more wood and slightly less peat imho . 
  have n't tried the 18yo yet . 
  i really like laphroaig , but my latest acquisition is a bruichladdich port charlotte heavy peated 10yo , and i really love that stuff . 
  do n't worry , i had peaty and smoky flavors confused for the longest time . 
  imho the peat is more the boggy , herbal taste , like moist leaves or other decomposing plant matter . 
  the port charlotte has some heavy fruity notes mixed with it , adding some sweetenes . 
  upgraded my pirate pack to digital pirate . 
  no problems . 
  auchentoshan and bunnahabhain are also fun . 
  also , nobody pronounces caol ila right the first time ^ ^, 
  imho the scotch with the most camp-fiery taste is ardbeg . 
  it is n't the most peaty , but it has the most smoke of the whiskys i 've tried yet . 
  even though this is nicely done , a aurora is not a raise compared to a 300i , 
  i really want a x52pro , but it 's sold out in europe ... 
  if you decide to do that please contact me , 
  yes i have seen some of his videos . 
  glad to hear that even scottish people sometimes get them wrong  . 
  you know the wrong men . 
  believe me , you do n't want an l85 . 
  i would first fix that moldy looking wall there before i 'd put any food in that room ... 
  i 've seen tons of smart cars parked like that in rome .

  i 've recently watched a cool documentary about those russian nuclear-powered ice-breakers . 
  one of them dragged a freighter along because that way that freighter saved fuel and the dual nuclear reactors just do n't care ...

  good luck with that ... 
  that already exists , it 's called squadron 42 , 
  that watch is most definitely not real gold . 
  as far as my understanding of metal detectors go they can detect any electrically conductive metal , so they should be able to detect all metals , since they are all more or less conductive . 
  easy . 
  scrape your message in with any metal object . 
  his website actually looks professional . 
  i think only original backer pay less . 
  the buttons on the stick work except for the pinkie trigger and the second hat switch . 
  even though i deactivated the shift modes for it it 's still not recognized in arma 3 . 
  only when i bind a keypress to it , but then i have the same problem as stated above , when i press it once the action is activated multiple times .
