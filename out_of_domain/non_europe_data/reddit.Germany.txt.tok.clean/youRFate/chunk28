  haha , my sarcasm meter just exploded :d, 
  it works in other games , like dcs world . 
  dcs world recognizes all buttons on the stick and throttle out-of-the-box without having to do change any settings . 
  this is not at hofbr\u00e4ushaus , this is a tent like they we on oktoberfest . 
  it 's the [ hofbr\u00e4u ] ( http://www.hofbraeu-muenchen.de/ ) logo , wich is the beer made by the hofbr\u00e4u brauerei ( brewery ) that was originally in the hofbr\u00e4uhaus . 
  the hofbr\u00e4uhaus nowadays is a restaurant owned by hofbr\u00e4u . 
  yes because the hofbr\u00e4uhaus sells hofbr\u00e4u beer . 
  trust me , i live in munich . 
  it says `` this video is not available '' when i try to watch it . 
  does it work for anyone else ? 
  not this discussion , again ... :d, 
  aaah now i want a retaliator ... must ... resist ... buying, 
  the billy boy one is intentional , as billy boy is a condom manufacturer . 
  many people on that are just walking backwards ... 
  does nobody here have hands-free calling in their car ? 
  being in germany this is n't illegal . 
  my old , used merc maxes out at about 135mph / 215 kmh . 
  citing the $ 25 million goal :, 
   hitting this goal will also allow us to increase the number of remaining alpha slots . 
  idk about placing my hotas on it , as mousepads are generally designed to be low-friction , but i do n't want my hotas to move . 
  also suction cups probably wo n't work on the mesh/fiber material they are supposedly made of . 
  hangover is called ` kater ' in german . 
  rigol is agillent 's low end branch , so they should be of decent quality . 
  that being said i have mostly used rohde & schwarz analyzers , which are beyond excellent . 
  i was actually astounded when i realized that berlin is farther north than london . 
  website is down for me , what did it say ? 
  i guess some form of cryptolocker ? 
  what you call entr\u00e9e is in total contrast to the original french meaning of entr\u00e9e . 
  an entr\u00e9e is not the main course , it 's the first course , what you would call a starter . 
  better construction , dual spring system , nicer design, 
  the lithosphere is the outer crust of the earth ( the ground ) . 
  lithobreaking is a pun on aerobreaking . 
  if they release a 10 inch tablet with their amazing screen and lte it 's gon na be an instabuy . 
  first - 1 star, 
  is n't typing on it a little awkward , when it 's fully vertical ? 
  would you post your setup ? 
  i 'm pretty interested in getting one myself . 
  if i were to start from scratch , roughly how much would i need to spend to get a ` real ' fpv ( go pro and all ) ? 
  having just looked up those monitor googles i really want to build one with 2 cameras and occulus rift support , 
  how about using a circuit breaker ? 
  those are designed for a lot of power ( 230v ac , 16 amps here ) and the slim line ones certainly do n't weight more that 50g . 
  really ? 
  parks and recreation, 
  it is a very pretty and fast device , i have used several that belong to people i know , only thing that stops me from buying it is that it does n't come with any mobile data options . 
  i do n't want to tether it to my phone and thereby drain the phone 's battery really fast ... 
  even if you ca n't use the rift to it 's full potential while in the air , you could still record stereoscopic 1080p footage and watch it on the rift later , i bet that would still be awesome . 
  you 're right , transmitting 1080p ( 2x1080p even ? ), 
  at 60 fps requires large amounts of energy or the range will be severely limited . 
  getting the head tracking to control the camera should n't be too hard . 
  in germany it 's illegal to call yourself engineer unless you have at least a bachelor 's degree in a relevant field . 
  every french kid gets one from their grandpa at some point , just like every german and swiss kid gets a swiss army knife . 
  i 'm german , i got my first swiss army knive when i was 12 i think . 
  i also got a leatherman wave in ' 99 . 
  i have the swiss army knive in my pants pocket and the wave in my laptop / study bag . 
  i 'm german , so i do n't have an opinel , 
  that there is no almighty `` god '' of whatever sort anywhere that judges over people or controls their fate . 
  nice of her to tell you . 
  i bet your beard grew a millimeter the second you heard that . 
  i 've never accidentally hit that key . 
  but i agree , if you do n't speak french it 's kinda useless ... 
   so is ctrl + ** s **, 
  ftfy ^ all ^ hail ^ glorious ^ emacs ^ master ^ race, 
  yes the military suddenly deciding : `` you know what we need ? 
  not submarines with ultra advanced weapons , we need huge melee fighters ! '', 
  hat no reason at all . 
  they could have just done the following :, 
  * take the ridiculous amount of resources needed for the jaeger project, 
  * build a humongous garbage disposal made from the god-mode sword material right above the rift, 
  * collect infinite stream of resources from the shredded kaiju, 
  depends on the country . 
  in germany you have 2 weeks to return any bought item and you do n't have to state any reason . 
  it has to be undamaged / not showing sings of use other from you inspecting it . 
  it 's also law that mail order businesses have to pay for the costs of any return . 
  i also use a modmic and i love it, 
  nspire cx cas . 
  get on my level . 
  how do you check if an ethiopian girl is pregnant ? 
  hold her against a flashlight . 
  i have the wolfram alpha pro app , but you ca n't use that in any exams . 
  ca n't use that in exams , also i prefer python with scipy and numpy, 
  we are not allowed to use anything non - permanent to write exams . 
  minus allows 2gb per picture and does not scale them . 
  try arma 3 , hint : it 's fucking awesome . 
  that 's how arma 3 does it, 
  what is the game played at around [ 24:50 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=cbthcehprra#t=1431 ) ? 
  8/8 , would show her my pointer . 
  that code gives you 20 % off of [ pretty much any game in their catalog ] ( http://blog.playfire.com/2013/11/20-off-in-november.html ) . 
  i bought the civ v dlcs with it . 
  on a very much related note : gmg25-sgi75-s2zj9 will give you 25 % off of starpoint gemini 2 [ and a bunch of other games ] ( http://blog.playfire.com/2013/10/get-arkham-origins-season-pass-for-25.html ) . 
  he 's matching [ uri ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uri_scheme ) s , not [ url ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uniform_resource_locator ) s. urls are a subset of uris . 
  i owned one and you are right , actually both you and the guy above you , i also constantly checked my pockets . 
  your microcontroller wo n't be fast enough to interface with pc ddr2 , it probably hasnt even got enough i/os . 
  i have interfaced with ddr2 ram before , but we used a pretty fast fpga . 
  you should look into much slower ram , or even better use sd cards . 
  that will give you valuable knowledge . 
  i honestly look forward to it . 
  i 'd post one of those ` dis gun be good ' gifs , but i 'm on mobile . 
  mondays is jam session at jazzbar vogler . 
  i think it 's satire , but they never break character / delete all posts that break character . 
  i only order shoes online from brands where i know which size fits me .
