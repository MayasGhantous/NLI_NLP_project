  seeing that i 'm pretty brand loyal when it comes to my sneakers ordering them online is n't a problem . 
  i think it works in all big cities . 
  here in munich it 's also normal behavior . 
  fuck that , i wo n't stand if there is an empty seat somewhere . 
  i guess you just suck at putting them on, 
  the tv would still have to support hdcp encryption for it to work . 
  i actually like that , adds more immersion . 
  i have attended slaughtering pigs often throughout my childhood , and it 's an experience i would n't want to give up . 
  which is still small compared to many other modern games . 
  my bank updated the policy of my mastercard , so i get free money at every atm , even in other countries . 
  however i now have to pay a small monthly fee for it ... 
  yep, 
  we got 500 free pages / semester , and they stacked up . 
  i still have like 3000 free pages at my old university . 
  commenting to put this on my to-watch-list . 
  thy should make ftl 2 with co-op multiplayer , similar to the [ space alert ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_alert ) board game . 
  every android phone i know can do this out of the box , why would you need an app for that ? 
  is weather bug largely us only or would it also be viable in europe ? 
  i 'm still looking for the perfect weather app for me ... 
  munich 's subway system has mobile internet . 
  probably his blog or his email or his linked-in . 
  genuine question : what 's the difference ? 
  have n't tried it on my dads nexus 5 , but on my mother 's nexus 4 and my htc sensation xe it worked out of the box . 
  what 's `` target capable '' ? 
  wow you seem to be really passionate about thrusmaster 's products . 
  i have a saitek x52 pro hotas and i have looked into the software briefly , it also has advanced scripting capabilities , but i did n't dig into it yet . 
  i might get into it a bit more once x-rebirth is released . 
  idk what people dislike about twisty sicks , i personally really like have 1 more axis , and i can easily move all 3 axis independently ... 
  be careful to really get the digital pirate , not just the pirate pack , as the pirate pack does not contain a game package . 
  if you get the digital pirate from a veteran backer , be sure to still buy at least a $ 5 skin or something , so you ge the backer rewards . 
  i have both , the arbiter and the digital pirate , and i 'm way more excited about my cutlass than my 325a . 
  ca n't wait to really have it in game and in the asteroid hangar that comes with it . 
  right now i 'm contemplating if i 'll buy a starfarer once they come on sale again ... must ... not ... spend ... so ... much ... 
  [ release countdown / timezone conversion ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=136&amp;iso=20131115t12&amp;msg=x-r%20release ), 
  i currently do n't have any sources for this on hand , but that 's what i 've been told . 
  you replied to the wrong one , i already have a cutlass , 
  this is not the right place for questions like that . 
  you should head over to [ stackoverflow ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/ ) . 
  get what.cd account, 
  never pay for music again, 
  we should really push a thread on / r/games or / r/gaming to promote this . 
  it 's available on [ steam ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/2870/ ) and set to unlock at approximately 12:00 gmt [ timezone conversion / countdown ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=136&amp;iso=20131115t12&amp;msg=x-r%20release ) . 
  it 's singleplayer and more immersive . 
  also it 's possible to build up your own trading empire with space stations that fabricate goods etc. 
  their youtube channel has some pretty cool sneak-peeks at some game mechanics . 
  i accidentally liked to the german version of the website , [ english version ] ( http://www.egosoft.com/games/x_rebirth/info_en.php ) . 
  edit : wo n't correct the error , otherwise that comment below would be way out of context ... 
  i would really like it if it was partial , like the crew compartment of for example a starfarer has gravity , but the loading bay does n't . 
  maybe you can remote control your capital ships like you were on board . 
  personally i 've always been on board of a m6 class ship and let the capital ships be controlled by ai in the previous x games . 
  it sounds fun to pilot a capital ship at first , but it just so sluggish and unmanauverable that i gave it up and zipped though the battlefield in a smaller craft . 
  any word on the polo shirts ? 
  the playership looks like it 's about m6 + class right ? 
  having multiple crewmembers and some space to walk around in . 
  psa2 : it has just been released and unlocked on steam !, 
  i bought mine on steam the day it became available , it was 10 or 15 % off back then . 
  dammit , i hope they release a patch until i get home ... 
  i have the same hotas , turn the 2 scroll wheels on the throttle into the middle position , as looking if for some reason bound to them . 
  does anyone know how to unbind a function ? 
  also , does anyone know how to remove the huge annoying deadzones from the joystick ? 
  if you want the trigger to work you have to scroll down to `` weapons ii '' and set it there . 
  also , see my newly created joystick / hotas post : http://www.reddit.com/r/x3tc/comments/1qpcdn/xr_joystick_hotas_thread/, 
  it did recognize my x52 hotas , i created a thread for that : http://www.reddit.com/r/x3tc/comments/1qpcdn/xr_joystick_hotas_thread/, 
  did n't try that yet , you 're right . 
  on the x52 pro ? 
  my throttle works fine . 
  did you center both of the rotary dials so they do n't register as an input when you try to assign the throttle ? 
  mapping my throttle hat to wasd in the software did n't work . 
  i then manually edited the inputmap.xml file . 
  i changed the starafing keyboard commands to the following :, 
  i found out how to use the throttle hat for strafing ^ yay . 
  edit your inputmap.xml file , found at documents \\ egosoft \\ x rebirth \\ \\ < random numbered folder  \\ inputmap.xml . 
  find the lines that say :, 
  and change them to :, 
  this works with my x52 pro , if you have a different hotas you might have to change the button names for the joystick . 
  see [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/x3tc/comments/1qpcdn/xr_joystick_hotas_thread/ ) for some fixes to joystick/hotas related problems !, 
  ca n't help you with that , i do n't have pedals . 
  i did something similar , i mapped strafing to a hat switch on my x52 . 
  i made a post [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/x3tc/comments/1qpcdn/xr_joystick_hotas_thread/cdflj3v ) about how i did it . 
  in order to find out how the button is called map it to an input that accepts joystick buttons first . 
  as for firing : scroll down further , you will find another set of mappings for weapons where you can map triggers buttons etc. 
  any information on this thing ? 
  looks interesting . 
  winter is comming , so i got myself, 
  [ h&m dufflecoat ] ( https://www.hm.com/gb/product/15673?article=15673-c ) + [ scarf ] ( https://www.hm.com/gb/product/17842?article=17842-a ), 
  [ fred perry kingston suede sneakers ( navy ) ] ( http://www.fredperry.com/footwear/mens/kingston-suede-plimsoll-b3128.html ), 
  give bruichladdich port charlotte heavy peated 10 y. a try . 
  but then people would probably freak out and say `` facebook analyzed my post , privacy ... '' . 
  as a german this is likely to massively improve my speeds , 
  or germany . 
  i recently bought a decent laser printer , so much faster and more reliable , could n't be happier . 
  i 'm a student and i print a lot , so i got a black and white laser since it 's cheaper per page and has a lager toner . 
  if anyone is looking for a good and relatively cheap laser , it 's a brother hl-2250dn , it comes with lan print server and duplex unit . 
  for color photos inkjet is still hard to beat , but the sharpness and blackness of laser-printed text is really nice . 
  if you need an alternative , i switched to foobar 2000 as my audio player years ago and is great . 
  same . 
  i basically want a nexus 10 that can do lte . 
  if anyone starts selling that before google then google lost . 
  it really depends on what toner you use .
