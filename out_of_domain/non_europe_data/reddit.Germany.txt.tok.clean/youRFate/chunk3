  university , scheduled backups , media streaming via dlna / upnp ... 
  2 of my friends have the same one now and we love this thing . 
  if you want more drives bays , just have a look at qnap.com . 
  mose awesome thing about them i have ever seen are the two gyroscopes aboard the iss . 
  the iss can be turned by trying tilt the gyroscopes , but actually the iss will move , not the gyroscopes . 
  the source was a yt video which i can not find right now , but might edit it in . 
  not available in your country ... 
  screenshot = karma , selfpost = no karma ... 
  only shows a blank map for me, 
  i would have stopped it after 1 minute , but the portal song prevented me from doing that ... 
  see also : http://lmptfy.com/, 
  i also had problem with quartus , but installing only the one component i needed ( cyclone iii ) instead of all fpga families solved it . 
  it also depends on what hardware vendor you will be using . 
  i use a altera de0 board , therefore i use quartus . 
  also , i use vhdl instead of verilog . 
  why downvote him ? 
  he is right . 
  nighly builds would rock . 
  what i love about my printer is the automated document feed on the scanner and the duplexer on the printer for fully automated double sided print . 
  i would recomend atleast to get a scanner with automated document feed , since i use that feature like all the time . 
  edit : it 's a hp photosmart c7200 series, 
  most of them are really nice , except the one or two where the pov ist not high enough , keep it up ( literally and figuratively ) :d, 
  that is what i was about to post . 
  i was really astonished when i realized it was not already the top comment , but ctrl + f before posting revealed it , 
  does not work for me ... 
  edit : [ this link ] ( http://www.ustream.tv/machinima ) works though ... 
  genius . 
  i personally prefer the pc360 since they are open and imho the velours is more comfortable then the `` leather '' stuff on long sessions . 
  i have tried both headsets ( the pc 350 only 2 weeks though ... ) . 
  also the immense size of both , the pc 350 and pc 360 , makes them ulta comfortable compared to the other , mostly too small , headsets . 
  watch the `` coe 's world '' videos ( i do n't remember in which one you will see it ) . 
  the storage room in their lodge is epic . 
  it also uses sign posts to `` hold '' the chests . 
  i could try to make you one as soon as i have time again ( by next week probably ) since i am currently writing the exams of my 4th semester . 
  also i have improved it in many ways in the meantime . 
  [ here is a 8bit version in smp ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/e4k8k/this_guy_made_an_8_bit_security_code_system_on/ ) which i did . 
  edit : also , would a logic gate plan be sufficient or do you need a block-by-block plan ? 
  finally someone who knows percent !, 
  ok i 'm back from snowboarding and i will supply you with the diagram in the course of next week . 
  btw . 
  with 4 bit you only have 16 ( 2 ^ 4 ) possible combinations . 
  do you also have flickering blue screens in the stream ? 
  edit : i think they fixed it . 
  ... provided they have energy, 
  i am studying electronics and information technology and people like you are my heroes . 
  ... from ppl . 
  in different parts of town, 
  when you need a bunch of utilities , e.g. 
  for setting a machine back up just use this : http://ninite.com/, 
  i can do that , too !, 
  but i find it pretty usefull , because when i do it it reliefs pessure on ears ( e.g. 
  when descending a mountain fast ) . 
  ok done , [ see here ] ( http://www.abload.de/img/image1vcnm.jpg ) . 
  it 's just a quick drawing but i hope it is understandable . 
  if you have any issues with it just tell me i hope i can help . 
  i also always thought it was special ... 
  gravel is my weapon of choice when building or in the morning after chillin ' on a pile of dirt ... 
  i would suggenst double tracks , so players can travel in 2 directions simultaneously, 
  it 's gibberish ... 
  problem in this case is probably that they are climbing upward in the lavablade , causing the string to burn . 
  yay notch is into electronics , maybe some new redstone functionally up and ahead ? 
  i can not fill that one out since i have never actually used ics . 
  only fpgas and \u00b5cs . 
  on which lp ( s ) is this track ? 
  it 's cool but the yt sound quality is just unsatisfying ... 
  gomtv totally sucks . 
  not only do they make you download some shitty player to watch the streams , they also make you register . 
  and after all of that even the highest quality setting is far from hd ... 
  eidt : i would be totally ok with ads , external player and even registration if they would in return provide full hd ... 
  its actually # 11 . 
  or hack their router and do this with their wifi ... [ i 'll just leave this here , educational only , of course . 
  i live nearby :d, 
  i have bought it , but i do n't know how to start a vietnam game ... 
  i have found it in the meantime ... it took about 30 minutes after the puchase for it to become available . 
  it 's solved now . 
  the problem was , that in the first 30 minutes you could puchase it , but not use it ( at least we 4 guys here had this problem ) . 
  [ this fuckin pencil !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80k7jl1o8lc ), 
  woah nice , we need / r/scienceporn for stuff like that ... 
  was this exhibited at gamescom germany at some point ? 
  i think i have seen it there ... 
  try slaves shall serve by behemoth on demigod . 
  i still do have a 4 digit phone number ( with a 5 digit regional prefix though ) , but here in germany you keep your old number until you end your contract . 
  i did not have this bug , so it does not seem to happen in all cases though . 
  lol yes this one !!, 
  [ if you ask a bot , use one that knows math ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6%2f2*%281%2b2%29 ), 
  put * machine * on * box * ... not only * mind * = blown :d, 
  i would say the inertia of those particles is not such a big force , and compensating it is , compared to compensating the centrifugal force next to light speed , like no deal for the magnet array . 
  i once burned part off my fingerprint off , when trying to correct the shape of glass that i just melted ... 
  so you decided to repost ? 
  met-art set ... 
  our class did not . 
  this should be the top comment ... i was expecting it to be someone saying something along the lines `` why not use stray cats and dogs '' ... 
  it actually is a swiss ship and a swiss airplane , also the ship is carrying the plane , it can not take off from that ship though . 
  also : here is the verification that they do have some sort of navy : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_switzerland#naval_patrol, 
  you may now proceed and enjoy my submission . 
  does anyone have up-to-date netbook processor market share data ? 
  i would be interested how fusion compares to atom lately . 
  ** this !, 
  that thing is posted at least once a month , the exact same image !,
