  not on my watch . 
  for those who ca n't read it :, 
   khai was running around yelling `` seal of command fades , i cast seal of command , i cast holy shock . '', 
  he then punched a boy in the mouth and yelled `` hammer of justice !, 
  if you do n't like the campaign please do n't link to it . 
  you 're just giving it more traffic . 
  i got the character sheets directly off of the wizard 's page and noticed some odd behaivor when printing it . 
  the reasons is that the `` black '' they used is not fully black . 
  is there a better version of these ? 
  i 'd buy the current nexus 10 in a pinch if it had lte ... 
  idk , i just walk past them , why bother talking if you do n't want to give them anything anyway ... 
  posting so i can find that at home ... 
  just change it ... 
  you can also abbreviate it as '' & c. '' if you want . 
  which is going to be a lot more expensive than buyin a cheap tourist gift one ... 
  car paint is stronger than you would think . 
  if there was absolutely no visible damage i probably woud have been reasonably cool about it , too . 
  the real question here is what was on the t-shirt . 
  of course you would think that . 
  fiber optic submarine communication cables still carry electric power in them aswell , since they need to have an optical amplifier about every 100km . 
  still no joystick dead zone fixes :(, 
  thanks , 
  it 's $ 500 , in what way is it better than [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/saitek-ces432100002-02-flight-cessna/dp/b0058faeas/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1385304486&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=saitek+yoke ) $ 180 yoke , except for the force feedback gimmick ? 
  there is no force on maneuvering thrusters ... 
  you think that 's a small bug ? 
  try asic design . 
  i 've not yet abandoned the nexus 10 , but i 'm on the fence of doing so . 
  what will you be going for ? 
  pc 10 is my favourite whisky right now , i 'll have to get another bottle soon ... 
  correct . 
  what 's the difference between a clarient and a piano ? 
  the piano burns longer . 
  no , that might imply them crashing instead of staying in the air indefinitely . 
  kind of ruins the pun . 
  word of advice , get yourself a decent laser printer . 
  so much less frustration !, 
  could n't go back to those crappy inkjets with bloated software that take hours in order to be ready to print . 
  i like my flow like i like my emacs : solarized . 
  i have been using kuru toga pencils for several years now , and i absolutely love them . 
  but it 's kind of hard to get them in germany . 
  do you know of any retailers in germany / europe ? 
  that eraser also looks really good . 
  get one by esge , the swiss company that invented them . 
  they are sold internationally under the brand name bamix . 
  looks well built , but i really do n't like the look of the grip area . 
  thanks , those look nice , even though they 're not metal .

  why would i not ? 
  i am looking for a case that 's small enough to be kept as hand luggage so i do n't have to check my luggage in . 
  oh , you 're probably right , i did n't think of that . 
  i just saw some really rugged looking aluminum cases at the airport and thought i 'd get me one of those , 
  i ordered on ebay from japan , free shipping !, 
  but it 's gon na take a month to get here or so . 
  it 's still just a lump of metal flying through the air , just somewhat faster . 
  fun fact : if you dial 911 in germany you end up at porsche . 
  that was fast , 
  i ca n't fathom how op did n't use this for the title ... 
  i really dislike the x65f 's force sensing stick . 
  i 'd rather wait for the new x55 to come out , it has the same awesome split thorttle , but paired with a conventional stick . 
  most high quality joysticks , like the x52 pro do n't really have noticeable deadzones . 
  the force sensing creates other problems :, 
  you do n't know if you 're at the maximum of the axis , or if you could get a little more input by pushing even harder . 
  also it 's nearly impossible to activate an axis independantly , especially true for the twist ( yaw ) axis . 
  in addition to that it 's nearly impossible to rest your hand on the joystick in the center position without generating some sort of input , unless you have the force sensing set to react really insenstive . 
  apart from that , what i really like about the x65f is that it 's all metal , the throttle handles , the buttons , the whole stick which gives it a really high quality feel . 
  however , the concept of the x55 looks like it uses the same molds for the stick and throttle as the x65f does , just with different bases , whicht might just make it the perfect hotas . 
  i 'd totally be in if i did n't have midterms next week ... 
  as a general rule , if you have that much luggage , just have it delivered to the destination by a cargo carrier of you choice , like dhl oder fedex . 
  they usually have special services for luggage like dropping it off at the hotel registration . 
  also , are you the `` famous '' ashex from a certain tracker ? 
  thanks , i 'll try the luise some time soon . 
  also i forgot to mention my favorite italian place around here , possibly in all of munich : bobby 's at gabelsbergerstra\u00dfe 38 . 
  nice small restaurant with amazing pizza , have n't tried anything else there , yet . 
  tum , we have midterms in some lectures . 
  smart , open-source bee hives ? 
  have the software hippies gone too far this time ? 
  this comment works on several layers , it could either reference the famous team natus vincere , known as na'vi , or it could refer to the na ` vi in the movie defending their ancient . 
  having a lanyard hang out of you pocket was cool like 10 years ago . 
  it 's only 7,99 $ , or am i missing something ? 
  what quality do they offer ? 
  how about more obscure/underground artists ? 
  to add onto that , this is not true for dvds , which have ( top to bottom ) : a printed lable , a layer of plastic , the layer with the information and another layer of plastic . 
  there the data layer is near the `` bottom '' , but still protected by a thin plastic layer .

  i need one , where can i get them ? 
  [ some old favorites of mine from the dawn of insanity wolf on 4chan ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lqn9r ), 
  look at those differential gearboxes !, 
  sweet , but there 's an error on page 10 : the pcb is not made from silicon , it 's either fiberglass or ceramic . 
  the actual silicon sits in the middle under the heat spreader . 
  dynamical systems, 
  i think pea coats are shorter , though ... 
  your university seats have cushions and armrests ? 
  link to a track that uses it , 
  they also spoke to you !, 
  not on that hat , but it also has a little 2 axis analog stick on the thorttle . 
  it 's bound to mouse by default , but that could be changed or the thrusters mapped to the ` mouse ' axis . 
  is that stick analog ?
