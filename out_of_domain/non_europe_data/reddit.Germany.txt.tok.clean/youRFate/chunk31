  i really like my feral box , what 's your isse with them ? 
  the downtime during migration ? 
  i get 3-5 mb/s via sftp on my home connection , i use lftp with pget , works like a charm . 
  are you sure you are using the multi segment feature of lftp ? 
  you need to use ` pget - n = n * file * ' , or ` mirror -- use-pget-n = n * folder * ' , where n is the number of connections you want to use , i typically use 10-20 on large files . 
  i ssh into my nas and let it download via lftp . 
  you can also go the other way around and have your seedbox directly upload finished torrents to the nas . 
  i 'd like to write a deluge plugin that lets me do that from the context menu in the deluge remote client . 
  2gb full hd movie ? 
  have fun with that bitrate . 
  smells like public tracker crap rip . 
  gets the holiday spirit going !, 
  / r/perfectfit /, 
  i fucking love all your stuff !, 
  i always order one of the biggest pizzas on the menu , so i 'll have leftovers for the next day ... usually that does n't work as intended . 
  do n't use github , since it 's public only ( unless you pay ) . 
  you should n't publish your bachelor or master 's thesis before you hand it in . 
  i 'd recommend [ bitbucket ] ( https://bitbucket.org/ ) , they offer free private repos . 
  other than that i have to agree , latex + git is probably the best way to write imporant documents . 
  worked perfectly on mine and you have the added bonus of easy synchronization between different machines / locations . 
  learning latex takes someone with coding experience not more than a few hours , but it will save you a lot of time and frustration in the long run . 
  i pretty much do n't use word anymore . 
  latex has so many useful themplates for everyday use , for example formating letters perfectly including address in the address window of the envelope . 
  i could never leave any protective foil on anything . 
  i just have to remove it . 
  i ordered mine yesterday , in germany . 
  will i get an updated one or are they still shipping old versions aswell ? 
  really depends on the country though . 
  here in germany lte/4g is already heavily rolled out and working . 
  the government is really pushing to get lte coverage on the countryside and in less densely populated areas since regular broadband is n't always available anywhere . 
  when the light comes on on your dashboard . 
  i see snapseed mentioned often here , so i wondered if it 's a google feature , but it 's on the shop from a non-google developper , but there is also a google help page about it . 
  what 's the deal with it ? 
  on cyanogen you can do it by swiping down on the right edge with 1 finger . 
  google + 's new * auto awesome * feature can do this automatically for you , if you take multiple shots of the same scene . 
  on windows 7 it 's one of the defaults , 
  first create the two pieces without the outside thread , screw them together , then cut the outside thread . 
  while it certainly is a nice scene , the picture itself is rather grainy ... 
  [ request ] simple flashlight app , no ads , clean ui, 
  do you mean this one : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colinmcdonough.android.torch, 
  this one only gives me a slightly white overly on the screen , does not turn on the camera led . 
  edit : i just found out there is a version of this app called torch led : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colinmcdonough.android.torchics this one works with for me . 
  my old phone had hardware buttons and cm installed . 
  i used to have flashlight on hold home button while phone is locked . 
  i might look into your solution since it sounds somewhat similar . 
  it would provably make my day to randomly discover this on my mirror . 
  i usually buy my coke like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eacme8p.jpg ) . 
  i keep a case of those in my basement where it sits at about 15 \u00b0 c. 
  i also keep a few in the beer fridge . 
  the glass bottles are a nice size , so you can drink from the bottle if you want to and since they are a lot smaller it does n't go stale . 
  empty boxes would be folded flat . 
  nice !, 
  the snorkel is in the black plastic thing on the left a-pillar . 
  you can see the red cap on it in some shots . 
  it 's similar to [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/abejuid.jpg ) . 
  some modern off-road cars even have them completely hidden . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/enyyjwk.jpg ) is nearly the exact same car , with a snorkel in the same location . 
  that diffusor is probably the best thing ever made . 
  what happened there ? 
  how many connections are you using ? 
  what setup do you use on your box for the https downloading ? 
  nice . 
  this is the next gangnam style . 
  called it right here . 
  if anyone is interested , it 's the `` citta del mare hotel village '' in terrasini , sicily , italy . 
  [ tripadvisor link ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.com/hotel_review-g652028-d244523-reviews-citta_del_mare_hotel_village-terrasini_province_of_palermo_sicily.html ) . 
  i really like the concept . 
  there are only a few users here in germany , but it looks like there are a lot in italy , any reason for that ? 
  your monitor does n't get more pixels just because youtube offers a higher resolution ... 
  where ? 
  is there any word on when / if they will make that available to other languages ? 
  the voice commands work fine in german , but no ` ok google ' for me . 
  if i change the device language to us english it stopps recognizing german voice comands . 
  thanks !, 
  i looked at moves , but that seemd bloated . 
  i really like the minimalistic pedometer app . 
  what is the point of card uis ? 
  i 've seen them beeing pushed a lot , for example it 's also an option in reddit flow . 
  the way i see it it 's just a way to waste screen real estate ... 
  looks great !, 
  somewhat related question , does anyone know if i can setup the today widget so that it opens business calendar instead of the regular calendar app ? 
  if that is possible i might buy it . 
  just installed the free version to try it out , but the widget is missing in my list of widgets ... 
  it 's not bloated as an app itself , it just has features that go above and beyond a pedometer . 
  i would totally support that guy . 
  yeah , if you touch your mouse while using emacs , please start again . 
  nice , did n't know microsoft offered that . 
  that 's illegal in many countries , germany as well . 
  nexus 4 did have that sticker . 
  you can just take it off . 
  i put mine on the invoice and filed it with my other warranty stuff . 
  somehow i needed to deactivate subreddit style to downvote this ... 
  also , in cm you can swipe down in the top right corner to directly go to toggles . 
  imho the ` set home ' button should be where it is , since it basically saves the navigation coordinates of your home planet , but it should come with a confirmation window that asks if you really want to overwrite your old home settings . 
  i 'd be carefull , they might lose those accounts when they switch schools , and then they 'd probably lose their agents with it . 
  i 'd just create google accounts for them . 
  orcs sound badass and strong , would n't call them that ... 
  only in the so called '' [ gymansium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gymnasium_%28germany%29 ) '' , the highest of 3 tiers of schools of secondary education , which only about 30 % of the pupils reach . 
  german and english are mandantory in every school here , on gymnasiums you have a 3rd language of your choice , mostly latin , french , spanish or old greek . 
  the real one is a german ad : http://i.imgur.com/5tvnliu.jpg,
