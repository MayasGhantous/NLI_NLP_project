  you could make that in a pinch ... 
  i 'd actually love to hang out in that cozy house during a thunderstorm . 
  you called ? 
  should have worn a c-string ... 
  i do n't live in usa , so i ca n't order it . 
  you 're in a pretty shitty tracker if you do n't max out you home connection ... 
  why ? 
  that subreddit needs to exist as long as people share atrocious pictures as the on in this thread . 
  if anyone , people who make pictures like that must die . 
  buy the pro series , it 's cheaper and even more bifl . 
  i love my dt 990 pros . 
  and on the off-chance something would break , beyerdynamic is known for having spare parts available even after ridiculously long times . 
  can anyone tell me in which timezone it 's gon na be 10 pm ? 
  created [ this ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=archer+season+5+premiere&amp;iso=20140113t22&amp;p1=179&amp;am=30 ) event time announcer for people in different timezones . 
  nice , but the girl needs to learn how to pose properly  . 
  if you are in germany , install this browser addon , automatically unblocks all youtube videos : http://www.unblocker.yt/, 
  that add-on might still work for you . 
  wow , that 's major bullshit . 
  yeah ... pretty sure you ca n't steal her ipad ... 
  s/he said `` ever want to get it back '' not `` wait for her parents to come get it '' , so i think steal is more appropriate here ... 
  i do n't think the kind of helicopter parents that buy their 6th graders ipads would cause them too much grief if they had to pick it up at school ... 
  went from sensation with cm to nexus 5 so i 'd get updates at least for a while ... 
  is there a reason why you ca n't order a nexus in any benelux country ? 
  why would your faculty block connections to google servers ? 
  i regularly use eduroam and it works fine at my university . 
  nothing . 
  it 's made for that purpose . 
  it 's officially designated as a `` tobacco spice herb grinder '' . 
  we have regulations for this in germany , maybe you can do something about it , too . 
  here you can get fined if your dog barks for longer than 10 minutes between the hours of 13-15 and 22-6 o'clock , or exceeds 30 minutes of total barking in a day . 
  or sell it for a shit ton of money , probably . 
  there is an app that supports youtube in hd :, 
  many people ask about camera replacement apps , especially for the nexus 5 . 
  what 's your opinion on neo hybrid vs slim armor ? 
  wow your n5 is really ugly now ... 
  is it possible to only allow it to download when in wifi ? 
  saved, 
  imho the premiums have more of a high-end looking styling for home use , while the pros are something you 'd find in a studio ( as the names imply ) . 
  also , i use mine together with a [ modmic ] ( http://www.modmic.com/ ) 3.0 as a headset for gaming , so i sometimes wear them for very extended periods , and i pretty much do n't feel them on my head anymore . 
  so comfy :3, 
  `` only '', 
  i 'm on art and my whatsapp works perfectly . 
  [ taken from the caf\u00e9 on top of my university , stitched and enhanced by google auto awesome . 
  also , what 's the best way to share a photosphere here ? 
  that 's not samsung exclusive . 
  all android devices with nfc can do android beam , which sbeam is based on . 
  yep , just dice it into small pieces using the universal tool of all cooking : a good sharp chef knife . 
  i hope you are not serious ... 
  the magnetic field you can observe around the lense of the n5 is n't for attaching a magnetic lense , it 's part of the optical image stabilization ... 
  boot into bootloader ( hold volume down when turning the phone on ) and check the hardware revision that 's being displayed . 
  revisions are : rev_10 ( october ) , rev_11 ( november ) or rev_12 ( december ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.3g.co.uk/pr/dec2013/google-nexus-5-gets-design-changes.html ), 
  i think you have to put the linkme thing on a line of it 's own . 
  not totally sure though , as the bot constantly gets updated . 
  there are at least 2 versions out there . 
  i have rev_11 , which one do you have ? 
  even more interesting : what things that you would expect to work but they ** do n't ** work ? 
  * what are my current coordinates, 
  * what 's my current altitude, 
  * when does the next bus leave, 
  * order me a pepperoni pizza, 
  * hangout with * name *, 
  * what 's on tv tonight, 
  * navigate to * contact name *, 
  * where is north / east / south / west, 
  * i need a ride / cab / taxi, 
  do you have more ? 
  ok jarvis does n't work for me for some reason ... 
  me and my neighbor each had one , we built super robots using 2 controllers . 
  they usually did n't work at all . 
  it was awesome . 
  verdana is a sans-serif . 
  if you plan on printing whatever paper you are writing you are usually better off with a serif type font . 
  if you want true bifl headphones with really good acoustics go for beyerdynamic dt [ 770 ] ( http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/hah/headphones-and-headsets/studio-and-stage/studio-headphones/dt-770-pro.html ) / [ 880 ] ( http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/hah/headphones-and-headsets/studio-and-stage/studio-headphones/dt-880-pro.html ) / [ 990 ] ( http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/hah/headphones-and-headsets/studio-and-stage/studio-headphones/dt-990-pro.html ) pro series . 
  you will most likely need an amp with those . 
  the one in my sink drains slower than my tap adds water ... 
  i recently saw [ this ] ( http://www.iwc.com/en/collection/ingenieur/iw5900/ ) watch by iwc schaffhausen in person . 
  whan an amazing piece of engineering . 
  browsing the complete design files of any highly integrated microprocessor gives you that overwhelming feeling of never ending levels of complexity . 
  my uncle has one and he sometimes shows me some pictures he took with it . 
  i actually think it 's a nice feature .

  ok , i 've just installed [ transdroid ] ( http://www.transdroid.org/ ) , but i ca n't get it to connect to deluge . 
  both the web-ui and the deluge client work on my pc , so i have the correct passwords , ports and ips ... 
  imho that series is so old now , it 's ok to publicly spoiler it . 
  unless it 's from the books and past where the current season is . 
  i 've written to transdroid 's support , we worked it out . 
  it had something to do with my webinterface being on a sub domain . 
  they have excellent support , i promptly donated them a few euros . 
  make sure you use wpa2 with aes , not tkip . 
  i have the ultra hybrid , and i 'll apply the screen protector that came with it today . 
  will report back . 
  i need to watch this . 
  unless you have a case on it apparently ... 
  it looks like the camera flash is the only light source in the room . 
  were they having a dinner in the dark party or something ?
