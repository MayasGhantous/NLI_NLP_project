  alcohol , water and menthol . 
  edit : as some have pointed out this is of course oversimplified . 
  / r/shittyhdr , seriously , this is probably the worst picture i 've seen here ... 
  [ just for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7n5epym.jpg ), 
  ... posted by someone who was pooping . 
  here , have some of these : \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0, 
  what if someone has colored icons in the status bar ? 
  no , i 've had apps on my kit kat that were n't white . 
  kaspersky security for example ( just tried it out ) . 
  saved, 
  what 's the legal situation on those ? 
  in germany the bus would be at fault here ... 
  also , hanlon 's razor . 
  does n't fit nicely here in germany . 
  a border cuts right trough munich ... 
  there are several portals inside our company area . 
  you need to work there to get to them . 
  i do n't want it on play music , i want my files on my device so i can play them with power amp . 
  i turned off usb debugging . 
  i really like this , but i found it funny how he wanted to demonstrate the sketch app using a pencil and then could not re-size that beard with his pencil , 
  if you like gew\u00fcrztraminer then look at the stuff [ these guys ] ( http://www.cantinatramin.it/en/1/8/winery.htm ) make . 
  it 's the tramin winery , tramin as in the region in south tyrol where gew\u00fcrztraminer comes from . 
  because it was in the fucking 1970s ... 
  ah the physicist 's constants : \u03c0 = e = 3 . 
  for those not realizing what a hammerhead has to do with a nexus 5 , hammerhead is the codename of the device ( [ see first line of wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nexus_5 ) ) . 
  having said that , i still think that boot animation looks kind of tacky . 
  have you tried turning it off and on again ? 
  ( seriously ), 
  this is n't really a nexus 5 specific question . 
  i 'd recommend you check out / r/tasker , it 's a really good subreddit . 
  yep , no one believes me that it 's actually a good movie ... 
  your new version caused [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ypl3rwh.png ) on my nexus 5 , i have it disabled right now . 
  but is it identifiable who is there ? 
  all they can see is the exact air pressure in your house . 
  maybe for reporting data in remote locations where no one reported in a long time . 
  is there any place in germany where i could use it ? 
  edit : i think you need the [ google wallet app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel ) for that , which ca n't even found using search in the german play store . 
  the official [ google wallet app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel ) ca n't be installed on my device due to my location ( germany ) . 
  i can use google wallet online and for paying in the play store , though . 
  is it called `` window/transistion/animator animation scale '' ? 
  i have a bluetooth hands-free in my car , but i do n't want bluetooth to run all the time . 
  so i set up tasker to activate bluetooth for 5 minutes after it loses connection to my home wifi . 
  if i take the car it will connect to my hands-free and keep bluetooth on , if it does n't detect my car within 5 minutes it turns bluetooth back off . 
  no hard feelings , mistakes happen . 
  some more context on this :, 
  the phone is a nexus 5 32gb running stock android 4.4.2 with art . 
  i noticed when i got up that there was a new version of pressurenet , so i started it and looked at the fancy new graph . 
  then i left for work , playing some ingress on the way . 
  a few hous later , at work , i noticed that my phone was pretty warm , so i unlocked it an saw that nearly a third of the battery was gone . 
  that 's also when i made that other post . 
  i also noticed that none of my sensors reported any values in [ cpu-z ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cpuid.cpu_z ) , so i restarted the phone , thereby fixing it . 
  looking at `` my data '' in the app showed me that the pressure sensor had sometimes stopped working in the last week , see [ this screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6imdbk8.png ) . 
  if you need any more info feel free to contact me on reddit . 
  that was left to right ... 
  it 's obviously `` reaperteddy '' . 
  as far as i know it can stop you from getting automatic system updates . 
  you will have to flash them yourself and thereby probably have to wipe the phone with every update . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  you can reset the tamper flag , see the post by that other guy . 
  you can get the full factory images for all nexus devices [ here ] ( https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images ) . 
  maybe your device was unlocked and google recognized your snoring as `` ok google '' and searched for stuff all night ... 
  that 's why you use posix time , which is a continuous number that always increases . 
  dumpster was a trademark aswell . 
  me and a gaming buddy of mine would always text each other at 13:37 in whatever gaming messenger was used at the time . 
  that 's pretty common actually . 
  the french even have a three staged equivalent to ` bless you ' . 
  it goes like this :, 
  1 . \u00e0 tes / vos souhaits : to your wishes, 
  2 . \u00e0 tes / vos amours : to your loves, 
  there is even a wikipedia article about different responses to sneezing in different languages / cultures : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responses_to_sneezing, 
  the student id of my university , where i study for free , doubles as a public transport ticket . 
  it only works during certain hours , though , but upgrading it to a full time ticket is only like 100 $ / semester . 
  the public transport system here is supberb , i can go from any place in this city to every other place just by using public transport at any time of day . 
  how do you delete things from your amazon history ? 
  i sometimes ordered gifts on amazon back when we used a family account and wanted to hide them ... 
  now we need someone to code a map view like this for google maps . 
  that was my conclusion aswell . 
  maybe he pirated it ... 
  picked that one up from cheryl in archer ... 
  public tracker pleb ... 
  germany here , i 've never seen a school that has a school uniform or any form of dress code . 
  i know a few french girls who never wear pants , ever . 
  simply because they deem them un-chique . 
  we were n't allowed to do that either . 
  tip : many sites have rss and do n't advertise it . 
  in firefox just do right-click -  page info -  rss to find them . 
  at the technical university i 'm at it feels like every 3rd person has one ... 
  i 'd recommend ditching mx player for diceplayer . 
  linkme : diceplayer, 
  while it 's not traditional , it 's still a long way from a pornodirndl . 
  use a trash bag as a glove , then turn it inside out . 
  you 're welcome . 
  you would have to dispose of them aswel ... 
  how far inside is it ? 
  l8 bursters have considerable range ... 
  add `` ram/cache cleaner '' to that list . 
  i think being a offensive a possible is the goal here , so you totally should mention his name . 
  maybe make a pun on mlp , like muhammad little penis . 
  3gb/mo for 15 $ here ... 
  does n't come with a phone , though .
