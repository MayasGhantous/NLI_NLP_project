  someone sell me high quality prints of this . 
  now !, 
  i 'm really happy with my hl 2250-dn i got myself for university . 
  it 's a printer that just works . 
  perfect time to get a proper keyboard then !, 
  head over to / r/mechanicalkeyboards !, 
  that 's not german ... 
  nice of you to reply to such an old post , but i 've already got glypher , 
  do you still know the original title of it ? 
  the last one was called `` the cutting edge '' . 
  why does he feel like it was his spot ? 
  maybe the woman was waiting just like him , but on the other side of the spot ? 
  this reminds me of the [ old times ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cp4h16e.png ) . 
  back then we did n't even have shift to crouch-and-not-fall-off . 
  no its whiskey . 
  there is a big difference . 
  we have these on german keyboards as well , they are used to compose french accents like \u00e0 \u00e9 \u00f4 . 
  we do still have the ' button , though . 
  however , people still sometimes use the wrong keys for apostrophes , and the default direction of the accent on our keyboard is the one he used . 
  best thing is , to type my comment on my phone i had to enable french input in swiftkey . 
  different gens is maybe wrong , but there was a revision . 
  you ca n't really see it , probably because it has it 's own small metal shielding , but it 's in the top part , left and down from the camera , where you can see the square array of small dots , that 's the ball grid array where it 's soldered to the main pcb . 
  what about the different hw version strings in the boot loader then ? 
  there are people that have the old rev_10 , and most have the new rev_11 . 
  you obviously robbed the wrong place ... 
  what kind of bluetooth devices are you talking about ? 
  headphones ? 
  what kind of in-app purchases does this game have ? 
  edit : i ca n't start it , it immediately crashes . 
  i submitted the report to the developer . 
  edit2 : just read it 's not compatible with art . 
  now i 'm kind of sad . 
  i hope they get it running soon . 
  they state that it currently does n't work on art , but they are working on it . 
  idk about the fast food chains where you are , but here we always have a paper sheet on the tray , onto which i pour my mayonnaise . 
  the gt-r is one of my favorite supercars . 
  would n't you miss all youtu.be links ? 
  i have the slanted round one and i 'm using it with my nexus 5 in a spigen ultra hybrid case . 
  it works well , the sticky rubber pad generates enough friction of it to stay on nicely . 
  it also charges pretty fast . 
  the only gripe i have with it is that i ordered the white charger , and the plastic is so thin that the leds inside illuminate the whole charger instead of just the holes they are supposed to glow through . 
  it 's also perfectly quiet , no buzzing / beeping noise . 
  when i first got it i did n't realize i had to remove the plastic foil that covers the sticky rubber pad on the top and on the feet , therefore my phone kept sliding off . 
  if you have any questions regarding that charger just ask . 
  this is how we 've always done it . 
  i 'm german . 
  xposed is a framework that only works on rooted devices . 
  you could try this : http://www.nowsolved.com/how-can-i-sync-podcasts-between-my-android-phone-and-my-computer/, 
  hangouts only uses sms if you do n't have the other person on google + . 
  please add a space after periods , your text is hard to read . 
  he should really release it as a podcast , so i can grab it with pocket casts . 
  or is there a way to do this that i 'm not aware of ? 
  i 'm really used to doing that from german . 
  thanks for correcting me , it seems i have to re-evaluate some of my gramar . 
  edit : dammit i did it again . 
  i read android.holy , and also thought it was an app first . 
  then i realized it 's airdroid not android . 
  i do n't want an additional podcast , i just want the videos he already does to be available via pocket casts . 
  hi , thanks for the answer . 
  i have been told there is a way to add a youtube channel as an rss feed to pretty much any podcatcher , i 'll look into that then . 
  oh , i actually did n't try that yet . 
  i really like the current logo actaully ... 
  we have some power attenuators at work which contain beryllium oxide ( inside a solid metal case ) , but we recently got a warning to never open any of them and evacuate the lab if one breaks . 
  there are 3 types of radioactive decay : alpha , beta and gamma . 
  the stuff op shows is undergoing nearly exclusively alpha decay , with some beta decay happening . 
  most of the stuff he showed undergoes alpha decay , meaning it `` sprays '' fairly huge alpha particles about , which are basically helium cores . 
  since they are ( relatively ) huge they collide with pretty much anything and quickly lose energy , a few centimeters of air or a sheet of paper fully blocks them . 
  if they do hit your skin they ca n't penetrate it and only influence the top most layer of the epidermis , which is basically dead skin . 
  the second sort , beta decay , emits electrons or positron . 
  while they are smaller than alpha particles by orders of magnitude , they are still pretty big . 
  they can traverse gases like air pretty easily , but solid objects like a few millimeters of aluminum can shield them effectively . 
  like alpha particles they can only damage the outer layer of your skin . 
  and then there are gamma sources . 
  gamma rays are extremely penetrative electromagnetic radiation , look at [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jblwi2o.gif ) of a metal truck trailer being scanned using gamma ray imaging , notice how it even makes the strong and solid metal parts where the axles are connected look translucent . 
  these rays penetrate your whole body and damage dna throughout your whole body , leading to cancer . 
  in order to effectively block you will need a fairly thick layer of lead . 
  the time it takes to make the image is pretty short , so while it is still very unhealthy it probably wo n't inevitably lead to cancer . 
  that 's amazing :d, 
  you can always +1 your armor . 
  other than that , the ring of [ endure elements ] ( http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/endure-elements ) or [ sustenance ] ( http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/rings/ring-of-sustenance ) and a [ cloak of resistance ] ( http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-resistance ) are nice to have . 
  i liked the old one better as well ... 
  still prefer the old one, 
  now all they need is a pc client so i can listen to podcasts while working on a pc and still have them synced with the app . 
  i 've used ok google on the subway and some other pretty loud places and it works like a charm . 
  i really want that , but it absolutely has to be waterproof to some extent . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : on the xda link it says i need to be rooted for that to work . 
  you know that you can also tether your computer to your phone by usb , not only by wifi ? 
  however , by default this can only share your phones connection to your pc , not the other way around . 
  / u/fuckingbrugesyo has posted a working solutionm , though . 
  cell and bluetooth both are vastly different from anything that could be called wireless lan . 
  wireless and wired lan use the same protocol ( ip ) for data transfer , just with different physical layers ( ieee 802.11 vs ieee 802.3 ) . 
  the phone is already capable of tunneling ip traffic through usb , since you can easily share your phones internet with a pc via usb , just the other ways is currently not implemented . 
  but as / u/fuckingbrugesyo has posted , it 's possible . 
  this has nothing todo with being linux , you can transfer the ip protocoll with any [ physical layer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physical_layer ) you want , as long as both sides understand it . 
  see [ iso/osi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osi_model ) model . 
  someone just pointed me in the right direction , see here : http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus5/comments/20t41m/is_it_possible_to_share_my_pcs_internet_with_my/cg6h2tp, 
  the standard german tongue twister ( zungenbrecher in german ) is * fischers fritz fischt frische fische , frische fische fischt fischers fritz . 
  for those wondering : they do n't use nfc to transfer audio ( which would be riddiculously impractical ) , you simply touch your phone to the headphones and it uses nfc to negotiate a bluetooth connection . 
  yes , i got that from the video , but i first clicked the post because i thought `` nfc for audio connection ?
