  that sounds interestingly crappy ... '' , so i posted this for people who come to the comments before watching the video . 
  is there a way i can get all of these , maybe as a pdf/epub/mobi so i can add them to google books and easily read them on my phone ? 
  because i would like to start reading them , but that way i could easily keep track of where i was . 
  edit : i just created a pdf of dateline : sesen 1-8 , you can find it [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/aokm69 ) . 
  i will create epub and mobi soon . 
  the official forum thread can be found [ here ] ( https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/115044/dateline-sesen-in-epub-pdf-format ), 
  saved on my `` to read '' list  . 
  i actually created two google keep lists a while back , one for book recommendations i get called `` to read '' , and one for movies / series called `` to watch '' . 
  they are great !, 
  pretty much any bakery here in munich has stuff like that . 
  daily fresh bavarian beef , never frozen , cooked medium . 
  salad mix , tomatos , caramelized onions , cheese and mustard-cucumber-chudney . 
  and they have a selection of nice fries sauces , i chose honey-mustard mayonese . 
  cheese , caramelized onions , arugula , mushrooms , guacamole . 
  it 's the [ hamburgerei ] ( http://www.hamburgerei.de/kcms/index.php ) at briennerstra\u00dfe 49 , not far from the tum . 
  that 's a fairly normal price for munich . 
  burger was 8,30 $ , + 1 $ for the fries + 3,00 $ for the beer . 
  just out of curiosity , what do you plan on doing with them ? 
  i ran out having like 5 fries left , so you 're kind of right , 
  do you have a monitor with more than full hd resolution ? 
  it 's a very convenient tool . 
  i use it for shopping lists , todo notes and the lists i mentioned above . 
  what field are you studying ? 
  i have never seen a middle aged woman in class . 
  then again , i 'm in ee master 's so there are n't at lot of any type of women ... 
  that one hyperactive moron sitting in front of you permanently twitching his foot up and down , making your desk vibrate ... sometimes i seriously consider just jamming my pencil in that persons neck . 
  that sign says `` picnic launch '' , i think what they meant is lounge . 
  that 's probably a flip chart board . 
  who thinks it 's a good idea to use dailymotion for this stream ? 
  nobody ever uses daily motion by choice . 
  the only times ppl . 
  use it is when you google something and their link pops up before youtube . 
  they should just use twitch , which i see as an awesome gaming streaming service which constantly tries to improve it 's infrastructure . 
   livestreamer http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1b1h6o best, 
  [ cli ] [ info ] found matching plugin dailymotion for url http://www.dailymotion.com, 
  / video/x1b1h6o, 
  error : unable to open url : https://api.dailymotion.com/video/x1b1h6o ( 500 server error : internal server error ), 
  edit : fixed it using this url : http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1b1h6o_the-alliance-vs-team-virtus-pro-dota-2-champions-league-playoff_videogames, 
  you should add python to you path environment variable . 
  while you 're at it , also add c : \\ python27 \\ scripts . 
  then download the pip installer and run it . 
  then you can install livestreamer and rtmpdump . 
  i just did it and it took like 5 minutes . 
  after adding stuff to your path variable you have to restart the windows cmd prompt for it to take effect . 
  you seriously complain about the quality of a photo on a platform that crops images to 612x612 ? 
  why even bother at that point ... 
  idk what the problem is with your phone . 
  i have art since i got my nexus and i do n't have problems with it . 
  my phone is so fast that i doubled the animation speeds because apps start in fractions of seconds . 
  are you maybe using xposed or a launcher that does not support art ? 
  it 's probably more of a `` adorable flight attendant speaking in a german accent , thus making the accent seem adorable too '' kind of thing . 
  i prefer the interface of dice player . 
  they have been sold in germany for a long time now , or are they any different from the cards i can buy at nearly any supermarket which give me play store credit ? 
  i just found it out . 
  the problem is that shackle deals damage in 0.1 s intervals , and sticky napalm ads a fixed amount of damage to that ( 10/15/20 / 25 ) . 
  so it kills you in seconds . 
  does anyone have the stream url that works with livestreamer ? 
  edit : found it :, 
  livestreamer hds://mlghds-lh.akamaihd.net/z/mlg7_1@156787/manifest.f4m best, 
  exactly this . 
  i would n't be able to take them down because dad made such an effort , but i would despise them having those messages on them . 
  that makes them super lame . 
  it 's time to switch to r ( u ) torrent or deluge . 
  i ca n't recommend sumatra pdf enough . 
  it 's lightweight , small and blazingly fast . 
  who would be excited about and iphone * 4 * ? 
  best thing is i can subscribe to my lesson schedule in google calendar , so i always know when and where which class is . 
  they even update it automatically if anything changes . 
  the reason do do this is because you connect the prositive first . 
  when you then connect the ground it might spark , and if the battery is somewhat deteriorated there might be flamable gases near it , so it 's saver to connect it to a grounded piece of metal which is n't nescessarily next to the battery . 
  see , my approach is , if the distance is greater then the length of my car , i 'll drive . 
  both mine and my parents ' car ( both mercs ) have a bolt sticking out about 30 cm away from the battery which is labled with a '' - '' sign . 
  * go into vibrate mode with media volume at 0 when i 'm near university or work . 
  * when losing connection to home wifi , turn on bluetooth for 5 minutes . 
  if it connects to my car 's bluetooth in that time , leave bluetooth on , otherwise turn it back off . 
  next one i want to develop when i have time :, 
  when connected to home wifi and on qi charger ( nightstand ) , check if pc or laptop is running ( means i 'm awake ) . 
  if pc or laptop is running , turn on all notification sounds . 
  if pc and laptop are both off , turn all notifications off , except for alarm . 
  i can recommend the app 500 firepaper by chainfire . 
  it changes your wallpaper ever few minutes ( configurable ) to a top rated picture from the photography community 500px . 
  you can select which categories it should pull the picture from . 
  this is relevat to you question because you can disable the paralax effect ( wallpaper moving slightly ) in that app . 
  linkme : 500 firepaper, 
  that 's just a funny saying . 
  actually i use the subway most of the time . 
  probably ping it . 
  i have a 60 % at work , it 's a [ kbt pure ] ( http://i.imgur.com/heipvjn.jpg ) ( image form google , i have some custom caps on mine ) with pbt key caps , mx brown . 
  i love it , one of the best purchases i 've ever made . 
  i use emacs for pretty much every thing i do , i compile from within the emacs shell ( eshell ) , use it 's directory manager ( dired + ) etc. 
  other programs i use , such as matlab ( eww ) have configurable key maps , matlab even comes with an emacs mode . 
  other than that , you can just hit fn + number key to get the f keys , which is arguably even faster , since you do n't have to stretch your fingers up . 
  it even lets you customize the keymap further , i set the left windows key to be an fn keys aswell , and remapped the capslock key to ctrl . 
  but wait , there 's more !, 
  it has several toggles , like fn + spacebar turns the right win , alt , ctrl and shift key into arrow keys . 
  there are more , but i do n't use the others often . 
  note that mx brown swtiches are still louder than membrane keyboards , i put o-rings on mine to further dampen the sound , now it 's really quiet , the rest of the sound is easily drowned out by the background noise of all the lab equipment . 
  yes , but as you say , you have to up your game to next level editors like vim or emacs to really use 60 % efficiently . 
  the combination of 60 % + emacs or vim is made in heaven . 
  the pipe key above enter is standard us ansi layout .
