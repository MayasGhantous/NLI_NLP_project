  actually , what that keyboard has taught me is that i should n't be afraid of layout changes . 
  i went from [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tsrvfdy.jpg ) layout to [ that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/heipvjn.jpg ) one , and i still switch between them several times a day , and it 's no problem at all . 
  however , i still prefer the 60 % one for coding , simply because the special characters used in most languages are more conveniently placed . 
  the settings are under file -  preferences -  keyboard -  shortcuts . 
  and on my machine there is only `` windows default set '' and `` emacs default set '' , as well as options for importing or downloading additional ones . 
  i can only recommend trying it . 
  as stated above , i went from [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tsrvfdy.jpg ) layout to [ that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/heipvjn.jpg ) one , and i still switch between them several times a day , and i have no problems at all . 
  i was sceptical at first , too , but i found that i can adopt a lot better than i expected . 
  want layout were you using before ? 
  i changed one thing : i swapped y and z , because that difference is just annoying ... 
  i really hope they do release the steele band version they have shown aswell . 
  i much prefer stainless steele watch bands .

  oh a bank run , that 's gon na be fun ... 
  i have ' t been in any military , but i have been told this gem :, 
  some guy avoided having to greet a high ranking officer in the street by crossing to the other sidewalk . 
  the officer noticed this and later asked him why he did n't greet him to which that guy respoded with `` i did n't see you '' . 
  the officer decided the poor guy should stand in front of a window for a weekend to train his seeing skills . 
  would n't you have to unlock be bootloader first , thereby wiping the device ? 
  getting a flight there and paying admission is surely more expensive than whatever nexus device you get there , right ? 
  i would pay premium to get the ones with hellfire missles . 
  not , that 's not the official name , it 's a pun on brazilian online games writing huehuehue instead of lololol . 
  brynden tully is missing from the infographic , i 'd argue he is an important character , too . 
  is n't he described as beeing a little shorter and a little more corpulent ? 
  at least that 's what i always imagined him like ... 
  what 's yellow and ca n't swim ?

  well spotted !, 
  cheese is n't even nearly that expensive . 
  parmigiano reggiano ( pdo ) , which is n't a particularly cheap cheese , for example is about 30-50 $ / kg , that 's about $ 20 - $ 35 / lb . 
  it 's about on par with good beef cuts . 
  what did it say ? 
  but they are really so much nicer than the competition in both appearance and chocolate quality . 
  tbh , you ca n't tell the difference in many reddit posts ... 
  link to the original thread ? 
  i like to think she 's just fallen over from laughing after realizing her mistake . 
  which is only fast is you are american . 
  anything under 50 mbps is last century . 
  vlc does not directly change anything on the soundcard , it just increases the volume if the audio that goes to the soundcard . 
  i use repligo reader pro , which i got when it was on sale , it works pretty good , but i do n't really look at too many pdfs on my phone . 
  cola bottle full of balsamico vinegar :d, 
  that is actually a perfect comeback . 
  it 's like a version of facebook that 's usefull instead of annoying . 
  i like to use it as a tool , not a recreational website . 
  crocs are considered horrid in germany , but i still see ppl wearing them . 
  leopard 2 is one of the most advanced tanks . 
  leitz 5549 stapler . 
  german made , all metal . 
  better to use than those normal stapler that stand on your desk , indistructible and has a big magazine . 
  [ imco triplex ] ( http://i1186.photobucket.com/albums/z373/edcgear/imco%20triplex%20super%206700/p1010034.jpg ) are even better , imho . 
  the one after kit kat needs to start with l , though ...

  i just looked them up to see what they are , as i see them mentioned on reddit quite a lot . 
  looks like something straight out of guild wars 2 . 
  i 've seen multiple people chug liter bottles of vodka , nobody ever died ... 
  why not just use exponents ? 
  display, 
  having the explonent in bold / color to show the difference . 
  or they could just allow interface mods like in wow so we can all do it the way we like . 
  we could also go full engineering and use a logarithmic scale , call it dbhp :, 
   20 * log10 ( 19231847 ) = 145.68 dbhp, 
  if you use steam a lot , set steam 's language to english , it will automatically install all games in english .

  i still have the old verison on my phone . 
  the jpeg is strong in this one ... 
  i also have that on my phone and on my car mp3 player . 
  the pictures look very compressed or upscaled . 
  how well does this work with a pattern lock ? 
  i assume i do n't have to be rooted , since it 's not mentioned on the app 's playstore page . 
  does it integrade well with k-9 mail ? 
  i get that it ' kinda nice , but that looks so incredibly tacky and ugly , who designed that ? 
  wow , those are awesome !, 
  they are not the full blown german manufactured mmx 300 , they are chinese oem products with design licences from beyerdynamic . 
  i would n't care if star citizen exceeds 100gb . 
  sure , but i/o problems only occur if you try to load too much of those files at the same time , which would not be the case with that audio , since you wo n't need to many streams of it at the same time . 
  the problem with arma are the huge maps where the game has to load a lot of models in a short time , for example when you fly over several cities in a fast aircraft . 
  it still auto played for me like 2 minutes ago .

  we are not paying substantially more taxes than you guys , we only use them better . 
  did you ever tell your dad ? 
  was n't the free dns only for non-commercial use anyway ? 
  thanks your for nicely wording my opinion on 99 % of all kickstarters . 
  i will use this as a relpy to everyone trying to get me to pitch for the next vapoware hype . 
  `` klingelputzen '' in german , literally translated `` cleaning the door bell '' . 
  why would they call it `` wienerschnitzel ? '', 
  wiener schnitzel is breaded veal : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/wiener-schnitzel02.jpg,
