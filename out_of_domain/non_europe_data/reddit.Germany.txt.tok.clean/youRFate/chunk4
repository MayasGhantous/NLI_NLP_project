  i will check you guys out , as soon as my gw1 acc has been reopened again ... ncsoft support is currently not responding . 
  that is the standart reply to this sentence , and it has been posten millions of times here an on 4chan . 
  you can just copy paste it form [ here ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/has-anyone-really-been-far-as-decided-to-use-even-go-want-to-do-look-more-like ) next time you are confronted with that sentence ... 
  you do n't need to do that ... assuming it is set to use a internal timebase it is not possible for the curve to go backwards like it does on the `` thumb '' . 
  ( i.e. 
  there ca n't be 2 voltages on the same point in time ) . 
  also , looking at the power switch and power led , you can tell that the scope is turned off . 
  anyway op , have an upvote for the idea . 
  yes , now [ look at it form behind ... ] ( http://www.blogcdn.com/kr.engadget.com/media/2009/06/2008-12-06crvd-3.jpg ) . 
  that is bloody old technology . 
  you are way better off with [ this baby ] ( http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/monitors/ls23murhb/za ) :, 
  * cheaper ( 3500 $ ), 
  * much higher resolution ( 5760 x 3240 ), 
  * you can also curve it, 
  * bigger screen, 
  created by sheltering suburban mom . 
  as much as i love minecraft , i have to say it will never and with no texture pack meet my `` standards '' for graphics . 
  i love to play it , but i accept the graphics the way they are because i can not make a sufficient improvement . 
  i think you forgot :, 
  * meindl shoes, 
  * the north face clothes, 
  * deuter backpacks, 
  * ortlieb water proof packages ( for canoes etc. ), 
  * garmin navigation gear, 
  * edelrid ropes, 
  * katadyn filter systems, 
  feel free to correct me / discuss . 
  oo i have never had to do this and have never heard of anyone doing this ... maybe german toilets are somehow more capable ... 
  i like my women like my newspaper , thin and can take a few punches . 
  looks promising , but there is no 1.6 version , right ? 
  if you have a close look , the bed is 1 block away from the window ... 
  the server is pretty private , only i and few friends play on it . 
  the only real danger is someone mining it form below :d, 
  sry this is a private server which just me and a bunch of friends play ot ( yet ) . 
  we will soon have a massive hardware upgrade , maybe we will make it public then . 
  aaah skye , home of talisker , one of my favorite whiskys . 
  oo here in germany most fast-food companies put the lid on the drink for you , i always get it closed or one lid next to it on the tablet . 
  are there ppl who use anything else ? 
  here in germany i only see wood charcoal at the stores ... 
  lol yes , our calcs hat a `` reset memory '' push button on the back , so we had to lay our calcs upside down in front of us and the teacher pushed those buttons ... but when you turned them around again the screen said `` do you want to reset all memory , y/n ? '', 
  they seem waterproof , judging by the end of the video . 
  he puts it in the drink at the end .

  i do n't see anything wrong with a big company buying ad space to help fighting breast cancer . 
   1.7 is still nowhere near done . 
  if people want , we could do a piston-only release and push the adventure stuff up to the next update . 
  do it , yes !, 
  you would usually use a xor for that , so you can also deactivate it from either side . 
  truth tables :, 
  y1 | y0 | z1 | z0, 
  means , with xor you change the state of the output signal every time you change the state of one of the input signals . 
  with nand you have a problem :, 
  you would start with both switches on , once you change the state of one of these , the bridge would extend , but when you then flick the other one it would still be extended . 
  edit : added table , do n't know why it is so spacious , though . . 
  no problem . 
  the most convenient way to build a xor is , imho , [ design d from minecraft wiki ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/redstone_circuits#xor_gate_.28.e2.8a.bb.29 ), 
  yes here in germany every bigger store has them , and it 's pretty good beer . 
  yay for the idea of the 2 repeaters on top of the building to power both `` foward pistons '' . 
  i always used torches below the floor and redstone on the roof . 
  now i can finally build a 2-wide 3-high piston door . 
  thanks so much :d, 
  edit : [ done ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/iglzp/3x2_piston_door_finally_a_tall_door_info_in/ ), 
  how does he push up those empty spaces ? 
  it would be soo evil if someone sneaked on your roof and replaced the glowstone with tnt ... next time you want light you get tnt-enlightment ... 
  based on [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/igfw3/how_to_make_a_secret_2x2_door_with_pistons_in/ ) , i made it 1 higher , changed the side-power inputs and added the torches to power the lowest piston . 
  you have to set the timing on one of the top 2 side-repeaters a bit longer than the other 3 on that side . 
  it 's fairly easy ... if you want i can upload the schematic or the world . 
  the image sensor still can in no way compete with the ones built in `` real '' dslr cameras . 
  it 's not about megapixels , it 's about chip size . 
  also you lack decent flash and professional digital systems . 
  finally i would imagine the handling to be a bit dodgey compared to a dslr which you can grip without having to fear klicking somewhere on the touchscreen . 
  well at least he now as a electric fence defense system :d, 
  nice amps !, 
  you call messing with my redstone frindly ? 
  have you ever built a fairly complex redstone system ? 
  that has been posted yesterday ... you repost very fast . 
  ... that belong to / r/earthporn . 
  thanks , 
  point 2 of your reply is true for brand-new submissions , but seeing it already hat several upvotes my downvote surely would n't have had the same effect than my post did . 
  please do n't take my post as an offense , but that pic was fairly popular yesterday ( i think 3 oder 4th rank of / r/pics ) and i asumed you wanted to punch some more karma out of it by submitting it again . 
  sincerely -- ~ ~ ~ ~, 
  link to pic on fb ? 
  i want to like :d, 
  there is no better sound than radial plane engines ... 
  yes , because [ teracopy ] ( http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php ) is considerably faster , especially if you are copying loads of small files . 
  and it does crc checks . 
  i play on a private survival server with 2 friends , we build everything collaboratively , and since the server is way overpowered we nearly never have any lag . 
  we have 1 house with 3 beds for us and are now building our giant castle . 
  well we do plan on making the server somehow public ( inviting some ppl . 
  from reddit / the internet ) but before that we would need to secure some things ( lwc , a bit of griefing protection etc. ) . 
  we would like to have it publicly visible , but only trusted `` builders '' can change anything . 
  the problem is , that once the server is publicly visible it has to have some griefing protection and membership / password system . 
  i think many of the lmmo ( low member minecraft online : dd ) server admins are too lazy to secure their servers properly . 
  i would certainly push some pictures up into that subreddit . 
  we could also incorporate that list of servers which can freely be visited into such a subreddit . 
  our server will and does already feature some nice redstone stuff since 2 of the 3 players are studying electrical and computer engineering . 
  showing that stuff off to the public would be really cool , 
  it 's just a scan of the dvd cover . 
  it 's ( with ) sterling silver !, 
  :d ( the `` with '' is really suspicious ),
