  same . 
  they really should use the torrent protocol , i could add some pretty bandwidth to it ... 
  works with cortal consors in europe . 
  also r too close to d, 
  that 's gon na seriously fuck with your suspension ... 
  what 's the advantage over a classic rv ? 
  it 's cramped , it does n't have a toilet , you have to be outside to cook , you ca n't even get into the storage compartments without opening the boot . 
  you can get a small rv from adac for the same price , cheap rental services should be even lower than that . 
  but what 's the advantage over the predator just getting a regular goat ? 
  the fainting ones still have to be fed etc. 
  reminds me of a piece of the [ compact muon solenoid ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/cms_silicon_tracker_arty_hires.jpg ) , which is a detector at the lhc in cern . 
  the engine is not part of it , it 's attached , and i belive so is the fuel tank . 
  same , my dakine porter bag has carried books and laptops from and to university pretty much every day for nearly 5 years now , still going strong . 
  i did n't read the `` gaming '' in there first and wanted to go all filco on your ass , but it 's fine like this . 
  if your keyboard does n't require fancy lighting or macro keys then i 'd recommend filco or kbt if you are into smaller keyboards with nice control layers . 
  i recently ( 2 pairs ago ) switched from vans to fred perry . 
  while i like the look of the fred perrys more , the vans are more comfortable . 
  @ # $ % would like to disagree with you . 
  oh , you might be right . 
  i just assumed that from his other comment :, 
   it has a stack node on top and on the bottom . 
  so i thought the engine was attached to the bottom stack node . 
  that rule is not unwritten . 
  it has a usb connector , how you connect that to your pc is left to your imagination . 
  if you are talking about the wireless ones , then you need this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xbox_360_accessories#wireless_gaming_receiver, 
  no , capslock + 12345 also gives ! @ # $ % . 
  using the number row , not the numblock . 
  just try it out , i just did this on 2 separate computers and keyboards . 
  i have one , they are very high quality . 
  windows 7 on both machines . 
  one keyboard has us layout , the other german layout . 
  i just found out that it does n't do this if i switch my keyboard to us layout . 
  i also had it happen on an actual us keyboard at work , but that keyboard has a funky layout and maybe that 's the reason . 
  do you have any alternative to the european [ parking disc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disc_parking ) system for controlling parking times ? 
  iirc it took about a month to get to germany . 
  they get shipped from some asian place . 
  you have us sidemarkers active , you need a car coder to remove them . 
  oddly enough , many people here in europe have them coded in . 
  i personally do n't like them either . 
  i 'd be in on hirschgarten . 
  it 's a really nice beergarden , perfect for hot summer days . 
  would even fit the letter requirement . 
  yes , at 20k it 's either used or cheap . 
  same , i 'm a student and i bought a used bmw , 6 yrs old , 80k km . 
  yes , but those were n't new . 
  what i was saying is that 20k would be cheap if it was a new car . 
  yes , i was saying that 20k would be cheap for a new car . 
  yes , there are tons of inexpensive cars , that does n't change the fact that most of them cheap compact class cars . 
  how do you determine if an ethiopian woman is pregnant ? 
  hold a flashlight against her stomach . 
  did n't know that one before , bravo . 
  at least he 's honest . 
  it stated working for me after i installed wifi_tools . 
  i only pacstrapped base-devel , missed base . 
  after the chroot i had a incomplete system , did n't know i could just exit back , had to reboot and remount the partitions ... 
  dope , add an air ride . 
  sorry , but that 's hot . 
  now it only has one wheel drive , but form over function is pretty much the essence of stance so i guess that car fits right in . 
  my only concern would be that the horn seems to be very loud it 's might damage her hearing . 
  very nice !, 
  ever so slight rolling shutter effect on the wheel hub , other than that it 's perfect . 
  i just wondered : if you are from a state which does not require a front license plate , do you still have to mount one when you drive to one that does require it ? 
  very smooth , love the whitewalls . 
  i 'm new here , why do people hate on vossen ? 
  nice work !, 
  did you put the wiper in that position for the photo or did you actually mod it to stay there ? 
  i would really love rally style lights with this . 
  i think they are side air inlets . 
  what 's the advantage of tanking it at an angle ? 
  if it 's high enough to hit the bottom of you car it is still going to ? 
  fartalker is exactly the translation of the older german word for telephone : fernsprecher . 
  it 's not really meant as a seat , but if someone decides to use it anyway it 's still better to have a strap for it . 
  my car is more expensive than deer . 
  imho even if insurace covers it , it 's still too much hassle compared to just buying the meat . 
  probably a dota2 player / enthusiast . 
  proper . 
  if it 's a general lee then the doors have to be welded shut . 
  nothing is worse on a car than a tow hitch , imho . 
  in german we call them `` bauernhaken '' , literally `` peasant 's hook '' . 
  first of all , lacie does not make hard drives , they make cases into which they put drives from different manufacturers . 
  if you are storing data professionally then you should preferably get a good file server case , for example look at qnap 's [ professional ] ( http://www.qnap.com/i/en/product/items_by_series.php?ca=1 ) or [ semi professional ] ( http://www.qnap.com/i/en/product/items_by_series.php?ca=3 ) series . 
  they offer reliable and fast controllers , fail safe dual power supplys and professional * nix based operating systems . 
  they usually use raid 5 , which means the system will not lose any data if a drive fails and will keep operating . 
  this provides availability , but you need to have a secondary backup solution . 
  remember : data which is on one hard drive is on none . 
  as for manufacturers for the actual drives , i personally favor hgst , they have been bought by wd , but afaik they still develop and produce on their own , and have always been ahead of their competition , quality wise . 
  salami ( what you guys call peperoni ) , champignons , extra cheese and garlic . 
  yes , the best addition to a steak or burger . 
  i just love it in combination with beef . 
  is there an explanation what it needs all those permissions for ? 
  contacs , camera , microphone , etc. 
  also , if they congest london then uber also ca n't operate . 
  if they want to strike , fine , but congesting the city is illegal and a dickmove . 
  they should be fined and maybe lose their licenses . 
  it says it 's available in munich , but i can only select black car in the app . 
  the blog post is a year old , maybe they stopped the service again ... 
  when using bluetooth headphones you are bypassing the amp of the phone entirely . 
  edit : sorry misread `` both headphones '' for bluetooth headphones , somehow . 
  i personally only use in-ears ( shure se-215 , 20\u03a9 ) with my phone , for anything else i 'll use an amp . 
  even if they are loud enough , many phones amps will distort under the load and lack in some areas , most notably bass .
