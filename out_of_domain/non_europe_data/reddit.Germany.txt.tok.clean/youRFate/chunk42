  this is not news , i 've seen this last year . 
  it would be cool if sdr-touch could access the radios in the phone , without the external rtl2832u . 
  i do n't own full-sized headphones which could concievably be driven by a n5 . 
  i have only tried a friends pair of sennheisers with my phone and was underwhelmed . 
  i have a pair of beyerdynamic dt-990 pros which i use at home , but they are 250\u03a9 , so even with tweaked gain the nexus is not gon na drive them nicely . 
  also , they are open headphones , so they would probably annoy the shit out of people on the subway . 
  sweet , metal top panel . 
  yep , just got the app because of that . 
  it is n't a taxi service . 
  they do n't get to use the taxi stops and lanes . 
  it 's a private chauffer service which just happens to have a nice and intuitive way to call them up . 
  i use beyer dt 990 pros with a modmic 3.0 ( the old prototype one ) . 
  i could n't be happier , it works nicely and the noise cancellation is good aswell . 
  i have recorded my self to test the sound quality and it 's decent . 
  only the touch or is the display on all the time aswell ? 
  if you bottom out , try o-rings on browns . 
  i use a kbt pure with .4 mm rings on it , they make it more silent and reduce key travel . 
  you 're the pretender !, 
  * turing, 
  alternatively you could use location based on cell networks . 
  i had one fwd car , and 2 rwd since , i love driving rwd in the winter . 
  if you have good winter tires and know what you 're doing , then you can easily drift every corner , provided there 's no traffic . 
  sure it 's safer , but i sometimes like to drift corners . 
  i rarely get sms , mostly hangouts and whatsapp , so that would be important . 
  i 'd suggest using the u6 to universit\u00e4t and walking from there , that 's probably the closest . 
  i might join you in the early evening . 
  stupidly awesome !, 
  next level . 
  vi is a text editor . 
  how do you like the das 4 ? 
  is there a review on the wiki somewhere ? 
  the keyboard you are typing on right now is with 99 % probability a rubber dome . 
  that 's probably just newegg doing some seo to get people to notice it . 
  i enjoyed the subtle hate at opera for trying to look more and more like chrome :d,

  the meat at hans im gl\u00fcck is a disaster . 
  i have n't tried burger house yet . 
  thanks !, 
  i really looked through the wiki and did n't find a link to reviews on the `` how to navigate the wiki '' page . 
  right , i heard that , too . 
  still need to go there sometime . 
  you have sports seats but not heated ? 
  did n't know that was possible . 
  and now it was deleted ... 
  was that in mp ? 
  email spammers should be hunted down by drone strikes . 
  no it is n't . 
  if he ca n't be safe without being loud he should stop riding that thing . 
  i 'm glad we have strict rules on that noise in germany . 
  he means jpg compression artefacts . 
  if they ca n't be safe without being incredibly annoying the yes , they should be banned . 
  annoying others for that arguably small bonus in safety is extremely selfish . 
  i always check my blind spot when changing lanes . 
  and yes there are some loud ones here , but i hope they all get caught and lose their license . 
  ok after restarting steam on both machines we managed to play for 2 hours , then we found this : when i have him on winch and then select a different target for a different winch on my truck , the game crashed . 
  also , multiplayer saving !, 
  demae ramen , by the same company ( nissin ) , is superior . 
  the company is called nissin . 
  in germany [ tesa ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/tesa ) has the market in an iron grip . 
  we even call sticky tape `` tesafilm '' . 
  * disposal, 
  check with your landlord for wires / water / gas lines in the walls before drilling . 
  we got it working , see my comment below . 
  see my other comment , we got it working and played for multiple hours straight . 
  but gas , water etc. 
  nowadays water is often in plastic pipes so they are hard to detect . 
  also '' [ drum ] ( http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/drum ) '' is the colloquial form of darum . 
  i hear it all the time . 
  i 'm swabian , but i currently live in munich . 
  loading on logs , there are areas other than the marked `` lumber '' area where you can get logs , but you have to load them manually . 
  also loading logs back on after my truck falls over . 
  sometimes it 's useful when getting stuck , as it 's really quite powerful . 
  oh , i have n't really tried the orange one yet , i always thought it was more of a street vehicle . 
  the text is buggy , there was a post about it . 
  iirc what they really mean is only use one vehicle and move none of the others more than 20m . 
  bonus : a cool variant of the kraz i just found : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/bulgarian_excavator_on_kraz-truck.jpg, 
  dat carbon dome strut . 
  last time i flew with ba i got as much free alcohol on board as i wanted . 
  had a couple of red label & cokes . 
  maz 535 with long log trailer , towing a 255 with short logs loaded . 
  put steering in auto and set it to accelerate instead of pulling . 
  where do you live ? 
  reminds me of croatia , or some other south-east european country . 
  probably for barrel cleaning . 
  it has a different wiper on the picture in the left and the one in the middle . 
  also i 'm pretty sure the on on the bottom left is a picture taken on a yacht . 
  i want to visit porto at some point . 
  actually it 's yugioh . 
  freedom !, 
  the word is la ** s ** er . 
  get some beyerdynamic headphones and a modmic . 
  they are more comfortable than not wearing headphones at all . 
  she sets it to that . 
  obese feminist detected . 
  not a real , it 's cg . 
  please give me a dedicated pen digitizer . 
  tablets are useless at university without one .
