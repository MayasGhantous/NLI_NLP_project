  omg do n't make me miss that show even more . 
  ca n't wait for the next season . 
  that 's why they wrote `` doubled '' instead of starting an amount , got ta be sensationalist . 
  airbags use pyrotechnics to deploy and can cause some burns . 
  also those are way to many letters . 
  also there is a break between the city prefix and the number where the official seal is attached . 
  also we do n't have a german flag on the plate , that 's armed forces only . 
  for reference , [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/kfzmod.png ) is what a current german license plate looks like . 
  the seal depends on which state you live in , the inspection sticker is only preset on the rear plate . 
  on top of that , you ca n't have umlauts ( \u00c4\u00d6\u00dc\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc ) in the right part of the plate , only in some of the region codes . 
  it does not have to be fake , you can have any letter combination made at any license plate shop , but you would n't get an official seal on it , so it 's never valid . 
  see [ vehicle registration plates of germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_germany ) . 
  also , that license plate does not follow german standard , see [ my post below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/28u2db/saw_this_at_the_park/cier10y ) . 
  that poster is french ... 
  are you from n\u00f6rdlingen ? 
  i 'm from a town not far from there . 
  check your local legislation first , here in germany you need to have automatic height adaption and a headlight washing system in order to legally mount hid lights . 
  by how much is that lowered ? 
  i have the same interieur , that leather is just gorgeous , i think mine is the same color , or a tad darker . 
  oh another case of bmw jealousy . 
  most of them have hands-free installed , so what 's your reasoning ? 
  did n't know those could break ... 
  do you plan on lowering it ? 
  my e91 is on h&r springs , i do n't exactly know how much lower it is because the previous owner installed them , but the ride is still reasonably comfortable . 
  i do n't like to discriminate based on car brand , rather on car type . 
  i do n't like suvs and i hate bus drivers . 
  just got it in germany , i 'm with a small regional contractor that uses the o2 network . 
  there is also viral , which allows you to use all qualities . 
  linkme : viral, 
  that 's weird , it did allow that when i first installed it , also when you search for `` viral pro 1080p '' you find lots of mentions of that on the internet . 
  i wonder why they removed it ... 
  sounds like your mulf2-high has gone bust , that 's the module that controls those things . 
  do you have bt hands-free ? 
  if yes then that should also have stopped working . 
  that 's kind of strange , but maybe it 's only half broken or the cables have given up . 
  would the mist from the wiper jets be fine enough so the diesel could be ignited ? 
  it 's not that easy to get diesel to burn . 
  does n't every automatic have this ? 
  it 's really usefull if you go down a steep hill and you want to use the engine to brake . 
  i like the guy with the extinguisher and a smile on his face :d, 
  hot, 
  my 2007 bmw uses the second system you described , i can push the gear lever to the side to enter ds mode , then i can push it forward / backward to shift up / down , i can shift into any of the 6 gears the car has , displayed in the instrument panel as m1-6 . 
  the maximum gear feature sounds nice , unfortunately i do n't have that . 
  the models with bigger engines also feature a cruise control where you cen set your desired maximum speed which will not be exceeded . 
  the car will brake using the engine as long as possible , then it will use the brakes , however that is only avilable on the 6 cylinder and bigger models . 
  i 'm from germany , where automatic transmissions only recently became a ` thing ' . 
  my new car is the first car i had that 's automatic , but i can switch it to a manual mode like you described . 
  it will let me changes gears ` manually ' , however it will still change gears when i hit the rev limit or when it would otherwise stall . 
  i pretty much only use that mode for going down hills and moutain passes or when i 'm bored . 
  all in all i 'm pretty happy with the automatic transmission , it 's relaxing in stop-and-go city traffic . 
  the natural enemy of / r/stance . 
  if they are too high then i 'll do that , too . 
  but i 'll use a different store next time . 
  shure headphones come with pouches , so you cats would not see wires , if you pack them pack in the pouch each time . 
  yes , i personally did n't like the bmw museum all that much , i preferred the mercedes one in stuttgart . 
  as far as museums in munich go , go to the deutsches museum , it 's one of the biggest technology exhibits there is . 
  do n't . 
  replacing all chrome with black does not make it better , you need some accents in there . 
  also using upvotes for polls or or asking for upvotes in general violates the reddiquiette . 
  wow hot , 
  you can grill at the flaucher . 
  we have done that many times . 
  germany here , i bought a used 320d ( e91 pre facelift ) , first registered 11/2007 , 50k miles , for about $ 20k . 
  it 's in pretty much pristine condition and has just about every option there is . 
  that depends , if the weight is measured uncooked , then 4oz is quite a lot . 
  the first thing after the maintenance has been taken care of are those wheels , they are atrocious . 
  that place he 's at actually looks dope as fuck . 
  i 'd love to watch missile launches from there . 
  luckily my car is low enough so nobody could crawl under it :d, 
  those side reflectors are only required in the us . 
  maybe that e90 was a european version . 
  we do n't have those reflectors here in germany .

  i 'd probably have done the same , it 's not like gloves have n't been invented yet . 
  what strategy did you use ? 
  i 'd probably have started with pressure washer from the top . 
  i have a n47d20 , which apparently shares the timing chain problems ... 
  because everything else is slightly out of focus and grainy . 
  also the lighting on the plant looks very uniform , whereas the rest is somewhat spottily lit . 
  reading the title i first thought i was in / r/stance . 
  the headlight covers are the best thing about this car . 
  the is always scaffolding at neuschwanstein , pretty much every castle hast to constantly be repaired / maintained . 
  please remove that apostrophe , it 's wrong in that context and really bugs me . 
  other than that it 's a really nice idea . 
  are those your cars or did you rent them ? 
  forklift simulator next !, 
  upgrade your stereo . 
  did that in my previous car , installed a sony radio with built-in bluetooth hands-free and usb . 
  do you have a source for the analog audio through usb data lines ? 
  i find that pretty hard to believe . 
  you can get a good sony stereo with bluetooth and usb audio for about $ 200 , a lot cheaper if you buy kenwood or similar . 
  there is only one d\u00f6ner place in freimann , [ family d\u00f6ner ] ( https://maps.google.de/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;cid=1609813220694043918&amp;q=family+d%c3%b6ner&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ufk2u82-b-al4gtepigyaq&amp;ved=0clsbepwsma4 ) . 
  it 's not the best , but it 's better than average , plus the owners are very friendly people . 
  also it 's on the road between the freimann subway station and the josef-wirth-weg dorms . 
  pretty much any d\u00f6ner sells garlic sauce , you just have to ask .
