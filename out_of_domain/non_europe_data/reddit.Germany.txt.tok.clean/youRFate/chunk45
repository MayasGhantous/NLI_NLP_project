  yes , the k ( kilo , 10 ^ ( 3 ) ) and m ( mili , 10 ^ ( -3 ) ) cancel out ( 10 ^ ( 3 ) x10 ^ ( -3 ) = 10 ^ ( 3-3 ) = 10 ^ ( 0 ) = 1 ) , so you 're left with ampere-hours , i was just correcting / u/midnightclub543 's post . 
  yes , that 's why i was correcting / u/midightclub543 , using kmah makes no sense at all . 
  it 's like those isps which advertise 100000 kb/s bandwidth instead of advertising 100 mb/s or even better 0.1 gb/s . 
  oh and while we 're talking about correct units , using [ kib / mib / gib ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mebibyte ) would be even better . 
  oh , did n't read the comment which said it was during oktoberfest . 
  in that case you could probably get a cheap hostel for that money :p . 
  i 'm german , and i can assure you that j\u00e4ger is mostly used as an alcoholic drink here as well , most commonly consumed when you plan on getting completely wasted . 
  no one i know uses it as cough syrup . 
  i never said it was n't a cough syrup , i just said probably nobody uses it like that anymore . 
  full circle , beautiful . 
  those are excellent pictures of an excellent car . 
  sometimes it 's ok to beat up paraplegics . 
  is it the guy with the red hat ? 
  he looks like a major douche . 
  care to post the lineup ? 
  anyone famous at all ? 
  hope you still had a good time , the location looks lovely . 
  edit : found the [ line-up ] ( http://www.rockwavefestival.gr/el/line-up/ ) , i do n't know any of them , looks like mostly local bands . 
  your pet can . 
  [ i just had to try it ] ( http://gfycat.com/peacefulblondbuckeyebutterfly ) , can confirm amusement . 
  was looking for some jungle , found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgqg-qsespe ) ( congo natty feat sista mary - nu beginingz ) and fell in love .

  i 'm usually not mad about wasting a little food for a joke , but come on ... 
  so much . 
  and then they say `` loud pipes save lives '' . 
  if your vehicle ca n't be safe without ruining the ears of every one you pass i 'd rather see you dead . 
  i have to say from what i 've experienced so far , we are pretty blessed with the general driving style on the autobahn . 
  however some people just ca n't judge speed , for example on a unrestricted 3 lane , two trucks are passing each other , the faster one going about 100 , i 'm coming in on the middle lane , cruise control somewhere between 180 and 200 , set my blinker and go on the passing lane to overtake them , then some idiot , usually in a minivan or suv , who has been going the same speed as the trucks for a while , decides this would be the perfect moment to also try and overtake them . 
  i have hit the brakes hard , and when i flash my light at them all they think of it is `` another asshole bmw driver '' ... 
  cooling pc water coolers , building fridges for the car , chilling batteries during high current charging . 
  mostly cooling stuff , because heating can be done a lot easier and more power efficient . 
  use steam voice chat it works surprisingly well . 
  i do n't get it , how do you play without them having it ? 
  do they play pirated copies ? 
  gotcha , yes they should add voice chat . 
  the one in dota 2 works nicely . 
  oh yes . 
  one more week here , but 4 exams in 5 days ... 
  cooking something and it turns out amazing . 
  i do n't get grainy vision , but sort of like overlays of colory clouds , mostly when my eyes are tired and the light is dim . 
  also when i close my eyes when they are tired . 
  it looks like nebulas . 
  here in germany the cartons are aluminum foil on the inside . 
  they are called [ tetra pak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetra_pak ) , and many things are sold in them , like juice . 
  i love this , i 'm also an avid day dreamer , so maybe that 's related . 
  wow , i want that on my car . 
  looks like buds for shure in-ears . 
  my dad used to say `` only poor or stupid people freeze . 
  '' , german proverb , does n't translate that nicely . 
  there is no mercy on that front . 
  i had an exam at 8 a.m. today , at tu munich . 
  omg yes , new gaming computer parts . 
  it 's not about the peeling it self , it 's about the implication of being able to play games for a while . 
  if i upgrade i usually set aside some days for gaming after that , like right after exams . 
  or when it 's been hot all day and you 're trying to study . 
  i just heard thunder and i ca n't wait for the storm to arrive . 
  not to me it is n't ... 
  they 're gon na need a lot of white flags for all of them ... 
  [ the actual police cars of the listed countries ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3qmi5 ) . 
  why would they capitalize `` price '' ? 
  imho they released to try and compete with the porsche cayenne , which has been a sales hit . 
  does it actually say anywhere that it 's his dads car ? 
  maybe he worked before / during college and earned it , or it was a gift . 
  i 'm a student and i own a bmw which i payed for with my money . 
  i have the bmw sports suspension + h & r springs for lower ride and i love both the ride and the looks . 
  gravel is bad for the paint , use water or ice . 
  get yourself a climbing harness with 2 carabiners , the towers should have latching points all the way up . 
  i still ca n't figure out the `` lan uve '' part . 
  something like `` do n't move '' would make sense , but i do n't get what she wrote there . 
  that has got to be the least official looking letter ever faked . 
  oh they do . 
  also the little hops the woman does back to the car , wtf . 
  pre-fl is best fl . 
  hot shit . 
  there is actually a look in between :, 
   x6 m : s63b44 , 408 kw ( 555 ps ; 547 hp ) @ 6000 680 n \u00b7 m ( 502 lb \u00b7 ft ) @ 1500-5650, 
  not all that shabby . 
  i personally do n't like suvs , but to each their own . 
  those badge numbers really do n't mean all that much , for example the 2006 + 325i is a 3.0 l engine . 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bmw_n20 ), 
  saying `` hellrot red '' is kind of redundant , since hellrot means bright red already . 
  you forgot the `` i '' after the g , it 's `` eyg ** i ** pt '' . 
  it also says so on the blue sticker . 
  it 's kinda nice that person made it more visible . 
  it 's actually common to stretch the tires for looks , it 's not because it would n't fit otherwise , it 's because the wheel is the important part , not the tire . 
  i personally think this ride height is spot on , but opinions like that are not too common in / r/bmw ... 
  that 's part of the look .

  why would you do this to that poor e36 . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  i can put them back up with the lock key on mine . 
  mine closes them when i hold the lock button , was not coded . 
  then get out of this sub . 
  nice . 
  why did you only use 2 bots on one end ? 
  also , [ time to add some camber to it ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a7/61/e6/a761e6220701a38b6e6f20e6ebf2cef4.jpg ) . 
  there 's also the i8 ... 
  what 's in the cold weather package ? 
  i 've never heard that before . 
  alufelgen just means aluminum wheels in german , it 's probably not a manufacturer .
