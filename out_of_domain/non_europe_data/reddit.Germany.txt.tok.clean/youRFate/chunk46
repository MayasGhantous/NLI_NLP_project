  i stand corrected but i will uphold that it 's a pretty silly name . 
  11/2007 , but i 'm in germany , maybe that 's the reason . 
  yes , i 'd count that as a win as well . 
  it still has the resistance logo in the top right , it 's an abomination !, 
  vossen are overpriced crap . 
  see http://truth-about-vossen-blog.tumblr.com/ . 
  basically they charge what you usually pay for forged wheels but sell you cast wheels prone to breaking . 
  that 's a specially marked bmw parking zone . 
  read your manual !, 
  what brand of car is that ? 
  i think i 've never seen that badge . 
  is there no mandatory exhaust fume inspection in the us ? 
  you have n't seen a mercedes in a while , have you ? 
  no matter how historically correct it might be , that helm is beyond ridiculous . 
  what does `` natural cut '' imply ? 
  did they come out of the ground already cut ? 
  i can see why it might be practical , i was just commenting on the appearance . 
  i did n't make this , i just found it on the webs . 
  the `` rd '' on the first one is lighter than the rest , did they try to scrape it off and then went `` whatever , let 's just roll with it '' ? 
  bitter ford owner detected . 
  rekt . 
  wow , i never realized `` changing '' and `` hanging '' only differ in the c . this just blew my mind . 
  what 's a nipmobile ? 
  derogatory term for asian cars ? 
  what wheels are those ? 
  this confused me for a while , because in german , the `` rad '' which usually translates to `` wheel '' means the wheel + the tire . 
  the english `` wheel '' meaning just the aluminum/alloy part translates to `` felge '' in german . 
  random fact : on the european version it go to 16 \u00b0 c , which is roughly 60.8 f. 
  sidenote : hella is a german car light manufacturer . 
  i hope you never have to drive in the alps . 
  oops , it says it right in the title : x, 
  hardware clock in the bios or attached to it . 
  keeps accurate time as long as the bios battery does not run out . 
  would n't call my bmw an ecobox . 
  stop looking at cars and consume more talisker . 
  people in germany were advised not to eat mushrooms and game from the forests because of potential exposure . 
  are you german ? 
  the `` et '' stands for `` einpresstiefe '' , the english equivalent would be offset . 
  tbh i do n't like those alimunium wheels . 
  what size are they ? 
  would be a nice thing to upgrade , the bmw wheels are heavy , you can get quite some handling benefit if you fit lighter wheels . 
  that 's the next thing i 'll do on mine . 
  i currently have [ bmw style 158 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qi6a2mp.jpg ) wheels , which are 17 '' . 
  since my summer tires are pretty much done for , i decided to use these wheels for my winter tires and buy 18 '' aluminum wheels next summer . 
  i 'm still trying to decide between enkei [ tsp6 ] ( http://www.enkei.com/tsp6.shtml ) , sparco [ assetto gara ] ( http://www.ozracing.com/car_wheels_var/sparco%20wheels/25188/sparco/assetto%20gara/40390.aspx ) or sparco [ pro corsa ] ( http://www.ozracing.com/car_wheels_var/sparco%20wheels/25188/sparco/pro%20corsa/563457.aspx ) . 
  currently i think i 'll get the assetto gara ones . 
  sparco wheels are nice and manufactured by oz . 
  if you decide to fit leds then you need to have the bulb check coded out or they will flicker when the iginition is on . 
  `` if it 's stupid and it works it is n't stupid ! '', 
  [ for future reference ] ( http://www.bmwarchiv.de/e-code/index.html ), 
  are the new keys significantly larger than the e90 keys ? 
  i do n't have any problems fitting my e90 key in my pockets . 
  oh , did n't other countries used that as well . 
  i just google 'd it and it does indeed come from the german `` einpresstiefe '' , weird that everyone adopted that . 
  if you are with any major university you will have free access to pretty much all scientific resources . 
  i do n't have an m3 , but i have a e91 with sports seats and they also have this . 
  i use it to keep stuff in all the time . 
  that is so minimal , why do you all hate on it ? 
  people like to hate on camber here , idk why . 
  just accept it that some people here are a bit backwards . 
  they also hate lowered cars . 
  i just thend to ignore those haters here and go to / r/stance if i want to discuss that kind of car . 
  where does that mirror placement come from ? 
  i 've seen it on quite a few stanced cars , mostly jdm cars . 
  does it originate in racing ? 
  sweet . 
  / r/bmw would have a field day with this ... 
  smoked headlights ? 
  that would never fly here :d, 
  what 's up with your camera ? 
  also , clean it before you take pictures !, 
  we have done this as well , but we made 3 deep holes nearly all the way through and poked into the sides from those holes with long tooth picks so the vodka could seep in . 
  then we added 3 bottles of vodka . 
  then after 2 days we cut of the top , shredded the inside with ice portioners and dumped the rest of the vodka in . 
  it was pretty epic . 
  at least it 's not a yard sard . 
  i can tell who just joined the mumble / teamspeak server by the sound they make adjusting / unmuting their microphone . 
  that would actually be pretty cool . 
  best effect if you have a nice stanced car . 
  less than $ 200 would be an unreasonable assumption imho . 
  i 'd probably spend up to $ 300 on it . 
  do you know how it 's connected to you phone ? 
  bluetooth or wifi ? 
  if it 's bluetooth , can my phone connect to the watch the my car 's hands-free at the same time ? 
  yes , with audi the real-deal is now called rs instead of just s. 
  any sources that are not google-translated ? 
  we have done some video processing on xilinx [ zynq ] ( http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000/ ) socs , which consist of a dual-core arm and a fpga fabric on a single chip . 
  our university uses [ zedboard ] ( http://www.zedboard.org/product/zedboard ) development boards for this , they are pretty nice . 
  with that board you can also easily evaluate the speed gain when you outsource parts of the algorithms into the fpga . 
  you can also combine this with xilinx 's hls c-to-hardware snythesis toolchain since you get vivado licences which are devices locked to the board . 
  always powerslide . 
  that 's only an update , meaning the update does not need more permissions that the app did when you first installed it . 
  spotify does actually need [ quite a few permissions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zmltfvx.png ) , however nothing too bad . 
  also , why is your font so wonky ? 
  do n't say that too loud on reddit :d, 
  op back , i have n't contacted you yet , but i will . 
  sorry about that remark about the company being shady . 
  edit : just sent you an email via your webpage . 
  op is back , see my comment below . 
  i have now contacted him to see if we can work something out .
