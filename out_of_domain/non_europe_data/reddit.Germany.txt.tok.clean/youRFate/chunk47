  beyerdynamic master race reporting in . 
  there nearly half a meter of space below that trailer , hardly slammed :p . they should have cut wheel wells out of the trailer and lowered it to a few centimeters , that would be dope . 
  germany reporting in , speed limit 85 ? 
  that 's cute . 
  wait , she is trying to recruit people for her pyramid scheme while she 's at work ? 
  you should probably talk to her boss . 
  you 're saying i should n't buy a moto 360 smart watch as soon as it 's released ? 
  you ca n't convince me !, 
  i hope you are talking about paulaner weissbier , their other stuff is barely tolerable . 
  and as far as weissbier is concerned , paulaner is merely average imho . 
  nice , enjoy dat torque . 
  i personally do n't like the x-drive that much , since it costs performance and the car rides higher . 
  look at the acceleration figures on wikipedia , the xdrive is about half a second slower than the non xdrive with the same engine . 
  i 'm aware of that , but we have unlimited roads . 
  is it just me or are those colors way off ? 
  the light blue is even missing . 
  he 's not obliged to fix it . 
  if the damage is assessed he 's eligible for the money that repair/replacement would cost , but he does n't have to fix it . 
  i do n't know about the us , but here you would get an estimate from a [ t\u00dcv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technischer_\u00dcberwachungsverein ) certified expert witness if you think they are trying to cheat you . 
  personally i would always have the damage fixed by a dealer if someone else broke something on my car , do n't want to risk a sub-par repair job , and i want to have it in the exact same condition as before . 
  what 's that slot that looks like a tape deck ? 
  h&r is a great choice . 
  i have never seen a clogged toilet in a private home , or have heard of anyone having problems . 
  toilets are connected to dn 100 piping here , how are they connected in the us ? 
  do n't buy one of those all-in-one blocks . 
  all you need is 1 chef 's knife ( classic french or santoku ) , 1 paring knife , and 1 bread knife . 
  if you are willing to shell out a some money for serious knifes i 'd recommend kai . 
  i personally use zwilling ( j.a. 
  henckels ) twin pollux series knifes , they offer great value for money . 
  i personally use their [ 7 '' santoku ] ( http://www.zwilling.com/en/artikeldetails-mediabox/items/2987,30748-181-0.html ) for pretty much everything . 
  while you 're at it , get a cutting board , i 'd recommend getting end-grain wood . 
  you can buy a thinner , cheaper board and still have it sit stable by putting it on a wet kitchen towl . 
  edit : also i 'd recommend getting a [ microplane zester ] ( http://us.microplane.com/microplaneclassicserieszestergrater.aspx.aspx ) , it 's great for grating many things such as parmiggino cheese , garlic , nutmeg , ginger , citrus zest and many other things . 
  buy hilti . 
  is latin that uncommon in the us ? 
  in germany you learn your second foreign language in * gymnasium * ( somewhat equivalent to us high school ) , usually the choices are latin or french , so there 's quite a lot of people here who have at least a basic understanding of latin . 
  i myself chose french . 
  i 'll probably make it soon , 78 to go , 
  if i understand correctly vtec kind of like vanos , but crappy ? 
  tigers weigh up to 857 lb ( wiki ) , and they are nearly pure muscle . 
  also the paws expand somewhat under load giving the tiger extra grip . 
  you would probably need quite a few people to win this . 
  i do n't like to see the food i payed for as an adversary , i 'm more inclined to enjoy it as much as possible , but to each their own , i guess . 
  i live in germany and both , my old merc and my new bmw did this . 
  it 's also ticket able in germany , and quite expensive . 
   prices starting at $ 1,250 per wheel . 
  nice . 
  horn, 
  i think that term comes from diablo players . 
  i do n't know about yours , but in my car it 's like this : phone is connected to car via bluetooth for calls , but every other sound comes from the phone speakers . 
  i listen to music via the usb audio interface of my car , which plays music from a usb drive . 
  when i get a call my car switches to bluetooth so i can take the call via the steering wheel controls . 
  car is a 11/2007 bmw . 
  there 's also [ 500 firepaper ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.firepaper.fivehundredpx ) by chainfire . 
  it downloads the top photos from 500 px , which is a big photo community . 
  you can select which categories you want the photos from and you can tell it to only download new photos over wifi . 
  i have it change my wallpaper every 5 minutes . 
  if you add poweramp support i 'm going to buy it . 
  a real-leather phone back would be a cool thing . 
  i could actually see that beeing very durable , shock absorbing and nice to hold . 
  does it only work with guitars , or can you use it to tune wind instruments as well ? 
  i 'd love to be able to tune my trumpet with it , i currently use [ waves - tuner ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cohortor.gstringsng&amp;hl=de ) for that which works great . 
  orchestra shift is crucial , as many orchestras do n't tune a ^ 1 at 440 . 
  are there any more pictures from the back of the watch ? 
  on the moto website it looks like it might me glass , which imho would feel pretty good on my wrist . 
  id on the wheels ? 
  you should also consinder x-posting this to / r/stance . 
  there is a smart car outside my workplace that has red painted calipers in the front , and red painted drum brakes in the back . 
  that looks beyond shitty . 
  it 's also plastered with stickers from tuning companies , but as far as i can tell no parts from these companies are actually used on the car . 
  solid bmw driver parking space , should probably have parked perpendicular to the wall for maximum blockage , though . 
  usually you can have the vin checked in the big bmw forums , but it usually takes a few days . 
  i do n't plug my phone into the usb port , i have a usb flash drive in the usb port of my car . 
  tip for american tourists visiting stuttgart : if you dial 911 there you end up at porsche headquarters , not the police . 
  police is 110 in germany . 
  what 's worse about that than leather car interiors or leather shoes ? 
  some area codes are only 2 digits , munich is 089 for example . 
  so much . 
  i do n't have room for my big tv in my student apartment , i 'm currently very underexposed to advertising . 
  that is a feature i really want , i use headphones that do n't have a mic , and i 'd love to be able to have sound via the headphones and talk into the watch . 
  i have the animations on my nexus set to double speed and it 's still perfectly smooth . 
  whatever phone will eventually replace my n5 will have to be able to also pull that off . 
  i would recommend going with the new version : http://www.amazon.co.uk/12000mah-portable-external-technology-smartphones-black/dp/b00cezbkto/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1407322660&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=anker, 
  the biggest feature is that it detects what kind of device is connected and always signals the device to use maximum charging current . 
  this way it is able to charge all smartphones and tablets with their maximum possible speed . 
  that might be a problem with the metal band , since they usually do n't open fully , so it would need to go round the back of the charger . 
  trollhunter was way better than expected . 
  call him reek , it rhymes with leek . 
  you are perfectly correct . 
  i was kind of startled why the `` woosh '' was missing , until if found it buried in the folded comments . 
  i 'm satisfied with the overall quality of the roads here in germany , then again , my lowered car with stiff suspension probably would n't survive 10 miles in brazil . 
  you can always find places to study at tum or lmu . 
  harry klein , bobbeaman, 
  i also like to angle my right mirror slightly downwards , so i can see where the curb is when parallel parking . 
  my new car even does that automatically when i 'm in reverse . 
  a very bad problem in germany as well . 
  many people have incorrectly adopted using an apostrope for possesion and sometimes even plural . 
  the worst thing about this is many people here use \u00b4 or \\ ` instead of ' . 
  i constantly see abominations like `` conny \\ ` s firs\u00f6rsalon '' , even on professional store signs . 
  [ celeriac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celeriac ) however is amazing .
