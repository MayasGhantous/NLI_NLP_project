  it 's just straight conversion from euro to usd . 
  here in germany tax also varies per land ( state ) , but retailers are required to show the total price on every item . 
  `` i sometimes do n't answer direct questions . '', 
  hmm do you think this will run on a gtx 460 @ 1080p ? 
  oh , also some of them get murdered by accident as they try to run away from the `` locals '',

  if there was a movie about lolcats killing teenagers i would watch it . 
  they make much more than that ... ti is one of the biggest microcrontroller companies . 
  i did and i will . 
  in games like battlefield 2 i actually inverted the controls on planes and helicopers , but not in cars and on foot .

  another cool phone number : [ porsche ( stuttgart ) ] ( http://www.porsche.com/germany/dialog/n90/contactandinformations-locations/locations-porscheag/ ) has the phone number 911 , provided you live in stuttgart and thus do not need the prefix and you do not want to call a specific perso so you do not need the suffix . 
  ( it 's an allusion to their famous car series porsche 911 . ),

  i think this is [ asdex upgrade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asdex_upgrade ) at the max planck institute for plasma physics , munich , germany . 
  i do n't see what 's nsfl about this one though ... 
  looks right in firefox 8 , but also no movement here ... 
  additional note : if you try to start the dead car while the wires are connected beware of the following :, 
  if the dead car is a diesel and the working car is a gasoline car make sure you have really heavy gauge cables with heavy clamps , because you will have a strong current flowing to the diesel car since the start up process of a diesel needs more energy . 
  if your wires are too thin or the clamps suck they might melt causing heat , which is bad near flammable batteries ... 
  also it should be generally noted that cars with a bigger engine need higher currents and should thus have heavier cables . 
  additionally if you use the method of starting the recieving car while connected you should activate something that draws a lot of current in the recieving car before removing the cables after you successfully started the car . 
  suitable are for instance heatable windows , lights , seat warmers etc. 
  this prevents voltage peaks that can damage the recieving cars electronics when disconnecting the cables . 
  if you want a really cool tactical looking bag , get this one : http://www.511tactical.com/all-products/bags-backpacks/business-tactical/rush-delivery-messenger-bag.html,

  fyi , vans do n't usually have a logo on the bottom , they have a very speciffically structured sole . 
  morrowind had then , if i recall correctly ... 
  sorry , fixed, 
  i cheated with clairvoyance :d, 
  why did you remove the cpu in order to change the heatsink ? 
  since laser typically has a verry narrow spectrum , which is set somewhere in the visible spectrum of humans , ( otherwhise you would not see those lasers bare-eyed ) it should , in fact , not be visible in infrared spectrum . 
  they can not carry an unlimited amount . 
  device , not device . 
  i think the current abstraction of what is precieved as an `` interface '' in technology shifts . 
  more and more of the interfaces are no longer defined by hardware ( keys ) but by software ( layout of the buttons on the device ) . 
  eventually this will lead to a completely uniform way to use technology because when all of the hardware has advanced so far that it is possible to put it in any case the only thing left that needs physical space is the human-to-technology interface which might get somehow standardized on the hardware side ( touchscreens , only the software differs anymore ... ) . 
  i usually go for hava club 3 for 10 $ / 0.7 l, 
  try uni `` kuru toga '' mechanical pencils , their tip rotates while writing so that you always have whis `` fresh edge '' which makes your written stuff ( especially math ) look so much cleaner . 
  also they are cheap . 
  i 've got the same issues , g700 on steelseries 9hd pad . 
  perfectly clean , i also get this in wired mode ... 
  just about everyone here , because often someone over 18 to gives his drivers liscence to s.o. 
  else and uses his personal id card himself . 
  also drivers liscence is not a viable proof of age here ( officially ) . 
  nope , it would be possible ... you do feed energy into the system ( in the form of trees to cut ) . 
  this is not about the forums , this is about battlelog platoons , to which you only have access if you own the game . 
  i have a d-link dir-655 and do not have a single problem with bf3 .

  it worked in bf2 and it works now ... 
  it 's a flame thrower , it throws flames ... the german version is n't absurd at all ... 
  his name actually is the word `` geschirrsp\u00fchlmaschine '' ( dish washer ) spelled wrong . 
  edit : chilicheese5ever was right , it 's `` geschirrsp\u00fclmaschine '' ( typo ), 
  there actually are more subways than mcds . 
  actually it would be : `` it sp\u00fcls geschirr '' , as `` geschirr '' is dishes , `` sp\u00fclen '' is to wash dishes and `` maschine '' is machine . 
  you are by bavarian law allowed to do that in every beer garden . 
  well , he should have put a propper barrier around it ...

  i 'm german and i have never used the imperial system , luckily , 
  sorry , but it is also not compatible with mine : `` diese app ist nicht mit ihrem htc sensation xe with beats audio-ger\u00e4t kompatibel . 
  yep , figured that right after i submitted the post :d, 
  you might wan na xpost this to [ / r/adporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adporn ) , 
  if that app works anything like the tools supplied with aireplay-ng of the aircrack suite then you should be able to drop clients even if you are not authenticated in the net . 
  that might be because they produce `` dirty '' dc voltage , meaning it conains ax components of some sorts . 
  if you have one , hook an oscilloscope to them and you should be able to see that .
