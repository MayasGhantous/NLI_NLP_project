  yep , that 's the markusturm in rothenburg . 
  my dad told me a story , a buddy of his failed to greet a high ranking officer and was called out on it . 
  he said that he had n't seen the higher raking officer . 
  as a punishment he did n't get weekend leave and had to stand at a window for the weekend to practice seeing . 
  why does your conference room have a subwoofer ? 
  i posted it here about a week ago , see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/2egxo3/the_feeling_of_selling_your_beloved_bmw/ ) . 
  couch surfers usually do n't admit people during oktoberfest . 
  also you are very late in your planing . 
  you will probably have to shell out quite a bit of money if you want to find an accomodation now . 
  yes , the bar should pop up at the comment , not at the top of the screen where i have to stretch my thumb . 
  those are there in case your brakes fail , as this is going downhill pretty steeply . 
  see [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/runaway_truck_ramp ) wiki article . 
  we have those on steep downhill stretches of the autobahn as well . 
  rtorrent master race checking in . 
  anything below about 20 % vol . 
  ( about 40 proof ) is legal at 16 here in germany , 14 if you are in company of your parents and they consent . 
  at 18 you 're free tro drink whatever you want . 
  r/bmw is ok , however they are obsessed with plasti-dipping every bit of color/chrome on your car , so it 's uniformly black all over . 
  imho that looks incredibly tacky . 
  i found that r/bmw is n't all that hostile towards lowered cars anymore . 
  it loads infinitely for me as well . 
  just do this : http://www.fitmywheels.com/fitmentdb/manufacturer/infinity, 
  you can add the manufacturer to that link yourself . 
  images load very slowly here , maybe use an external faster hoster like imgur . 
  i 'll add my bimmer once i put the new 19 '' wheels on it next summer . 
  i usually recommend it for all x-drive models . 
  because they are even higher than the normal bmw . 
  most people buy the xdrive for the added traction , be it on snow or on normal roads , not for the off-road capabilities . 
  therefore lowering them is perfectly sensible . 
  the camber in ops photo is minimal , imho . 
  it 's only called mercury , there is no mercury involved in that watch . 
  yep , go ahead and study liberal arts . 
  [ you are now aware that the rear end looks like it 's trying to shit out a silver porsche 911 . 
  full credit goes to [ motor trend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqr_r9qtryw ) 's review which made me aware of that . 
  the review itself is n't all that great , he just notes it at the very end . 
  i 'd honestly rather buy an m5 and a tesla . 
  best of both worlds . 
  or if it had to be a hybrid i 'd go with the porsche 918 . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqr_r9qtryw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=658 ), 
  javelin has that as well and is far superior to firefox on android . 
  nice car , that interior looks well maintained !, 
  you do n't what ? 
  yes i 've seen one here in munich as well , looks gorgeous in person . 
  but i did n't know about the porsche at that time ... 
  it 's not a gt3 though , nor is it on fire ... 
  hybrid actually . 
  it has a 1.5 l 3 cylinder 230hp petrol engine and some powerful electric motors . 
  aka opel vectra over on the mainland . 
  yes , i was half expecting a bmw damage control down vote brigade . 
  at least i would have blamed that if the post did n't take off . 
  yes , i gave credit [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ck9ap2v ) . 
  sorry buddy :d . be sure to tell all your coworkers . 
  yes , but that 2l/100km is only at the start , when the hybrid batteries are still full . 
  the porsche 918 is also rated at 3,1 l/100km , because the nefz allows them to start with fully charged batteries , and the course is pretty short . 
  yes , the original 8 series is sexy as fuck . 
  i 've given credit [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ck9ap2v ) . 
  i linked right to the end . 
  the review is a lot longer . 
  porsche without c would be porshe ... 
  yes , when i first saw it at iaa i thought they would never release something like this . 
  but they did , props to them . 
  yes , but that 's removing the s , not the c. . . 
  yes , i cited the source somewhere in the comments . 
  watered down lemon juice . 
  are n't there any regulations regarding sunlight and view obstructions ? 
  you could n't pull that one off in germany ... 
  i 've been to a bar in germany that had these one meter high cylinders with a tap a the bottom . 
  they contained about 6l of beer and sat on a little stand so you could comfortably tap your beer . 
  you would order one for your table and a couple of glasses to go with it . 
  they have pretty big storage on board , so they can harvest quite a bit before they need a truck to empty out . 
  probably a narrow boat ramp . 
  pharmacies were selling cigarettes in the us ? 
  that 's kind of fucked up . 
  and taking up 4 seats for 2 persons . 
  what is this , a pizza for ants ? 
  uhm , why not just change them at your bank ? 
  do n't you guys have a hoa ? 
  that would probably be the one thing you could use them for ... 
  it 's always in yellow if you start the ignition without starting the engine , same on my e91 . 
  imho you should delete those us sidemarkers . 
  what wheels are those on the z ? 
  you need to escape the \\ # by putting a \\ \\ in front of it . 
  if you want \\ #stancenation you have to write, 
  \\ #stancenation, 
  is that maybe the standard height ? 
  `` because racecar . '', 
  those are the exact words the german defence minister used when he ordered these . 
  you can wear whatever you want with `` police '' written all over it in germany , only the use of the word `` polizei '' is restricted . 
  of course i 'm serious , i 'm german , we are always serious . 
  somehow i picture you as the f\u00fcnke family from arrested development . 
  i know reddit does n't like burger king much , but i love the big king xxl . 
  it 's my favorite fast-food chain burger i can get here ( germany ) . 
  so glad we do n't have that here . 
  i have bought only about 10 books during my studies , all of them because i wanted them , not because somebody made me buy them . 
  the most expensive one was probably about $ 40 . 
  should have downloaded [ 7-zip ] ( http://www.7-zip.org/ ) , does every thing winrar does and more . 
  and it 's open source . 
  you need to watch more top gear ( uk ) before you decide to buy any more cars . 
  is it a smart car then ? 
  yes , but they also state that alfas will break down at every possible moment .
