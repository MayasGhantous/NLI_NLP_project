  they still look nice , though . 
  my driving school car was an alfa 159 , 2.4 l diesel , manual , and it was quite fun to drive . 
  just highlight all of them and right-click on any file . 
  also , use better trackers , split downloads are for plebs . 
  how about ride sharing portal where you merely split the gas money ? 
  think of it like this . 
  hers your wheel/fender now, 
  with camber its like, 
  with spacer its like, 
  fixed the linebrakes for you . 
  german engineer here , hi . 
  either reddit did not understand you comment or you were visited by a swarm of angry nurses ... 
  you ca n't eat wei\u00dfwurst after noon !, 
  if it 's a car show and they rented the parking lot then they can decide where to park , the markings do n't matter in that case . 
  it 's an old german plate from berlin which is no longer valid , they were in use from the 1960s to the early 90s . 
  there is a very nice overview and timeline on the german wiki , see [ here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kraftfahrzeugkennzeichen#zeitleisten ) and expand `` eu-mitglieder '' . 
  you have to pretty much contact every listing that matches your criteria , and probably broaden your criteria . 
  it 's hard to find something in a specific area , it 's hard enough to find anything at all . 
  he deleted his commend , could you rephrase what it said ? 
  peugot pepper grider , microplane zester , good knives ( currently only zwilling j.a. 
  heinckels , since i 'm on a student budget ) . 
  my anaconda do n't - !, 
  do n't wear the handkerchief . 
  which model year are you going for ( [ e21/e30/e36 / e46/e90 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/bmw3er.jpg ) / [ f30 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/bmw_330d_touring_m-sportpaket_%28f31%29_%e2%80%93_frontansicht%2c_5._oktober_2013%2c_m%c3%bcnster.jpg ) ) ? 
  i can really recommend the 2l diesel engine , love it in my wagon . 
  177 hp , 350nm of torque is a reasonable ammount of power for a 3 series imho . 
  the new headlights look seriously slick . 
  you need to be carefull though , maybe you park somewhere where it will get damaged by lowering . 
  e90 has hydraulic steering , in the normal variant it 's engine-driven , in the active steering variant it uses an electric pump . 
  however , the e90 is not a current model anymore as it has been superseded by the f30 series . 
  painting parts of the headlight interior is a new one for me , love it though . 
  the wheel base is the same or only marginally longer , iirc . 
  i have always owned wagons , they are more practical and look better imho . 
  that 's going in my gif collection . 
  that 's some very nice luggage . 
  those plastic cases look like pelican or hprc , and that victorinox mountaineer bag is also very nice . 
  where are you passing ? 
  if you pass north of munich , [ this real , - warehouse ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/real,-+sb+warenhaus/@48.1949599,11.5998334,16z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sreal!3m1!1s0x479e7415349b0571:0xb7e03dcf1f6347f6 ) has a beverage market that sells weihenstephan and it 's easy to reach from the autobahn . 
  if they should be out of stock for whatever reason , there is a [ v-markt ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/real,-+sb+warenhaus/@48.1949599,11.5998334,16z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sreal!3m1!1s0x479e7415349b0571:0xb7e03dcf1f6347f6 ) right next to it that also has a big beverage section . 
  you could of course always just stop over at the [ brewery ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/bayerische+staatsbrauerei+weihenstephan/@48.3950778,11.761021,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x479e6b195e0e5f49:0xdab97f05c84e152 ) itself . 
  my new mx100 is on the table in front of me , will be installed once the backups have finished . 
  i 'm coming from a hdd as well , but i use the opportunity to upgrade from windows 7 to 8.1 , so i 'm doing a clean fresh install . 
  i have so many steam games installed that i do n't play right now , also i want to install certain games on the ssd and some on the hdd , i 'll just do it over . 
  80mb/s fiber , so downloads are a breeze . 
  have you been to the deutsches museum in munich ? 
  i have n't been to speyer yet , but it 's on my list . 
  i 've been to sinsheim several times . 
  i also want to check out the flugwerft schleissheim and the transport museum which both belong to the deutsches museum . 
  i live in munich as well , so i 'll probably find time for that soon . 
  now i want this as my alarm , spoken by samuel l jackson . 
  i speak french , you clearly do n't . 
  that screw driver would probably evaporate . 
  every major car manufacturer has already done this . 
  hey , at least his flight is probably free !, 
  why do n't you split up ? 
  you go to michaels and he goes to the book store ? 
  do they have working engine animations etc ? 
  he has a \\ #antiair sticker on the windscreen , i think he does n't want air . 
  good , let the rub flow through you . 
  yes , but they should really be chrome . 
  why have nice wire wheels and then hide them ? 
  the juke is probably the ugliest car that has ever been produced . 
  i 'm in munich right now helping with this . 
  we just brought up layer 4 . 
  we 're at 6 layers now . 
  now 10 . 
  you do n't study at tum do you ? 
  i think i 've seen you . 
  would hang on wall / 10, 
  oh yes , we need a drifting league . 
  can you stance spaceships ? 
  you did n't get the thread title . 
  it 's meant for things where you thought it was not a phase , but it really was . 
  do you have a red light on the bottom of your rear view mirror ? 
  if not then you do n't have alarm . 
  it flashes when your car is locked . 
  needs more poke in the rear , other than that it 's nice . 
  good luck then !, 
  be sure to update us if it worked out . 
  the winerack is gone already ? 
  shame . 
  i like what they do . 
  one more reason why cafe kosmos is awesome . 
  well , there 's always a couple of people with signs stating where they want to go near the autobahn ramps at studentenstadt . 
  none of them wanted to go in my direction so far , else i would probably have picked them up . 
  however , i do agree that blablacar is a better alternative , i recently registered an i will offer my longer routes there . 
  yes , there are a lot of hitchhikers here , they are usually at the autobahn ramps near citiy exits . 
  so far none wanted in my direction or i would probably have given them a lift . 
  i will start offering my route on blablacar soon . 
  you are in the wrong subreddit ... 
  are there any wide body kits for the r8 ? 
  i think you could really improve it with some rocket bunny or liberty walk body kits . 
  i doubt they are more than 19 '' . 
  mine flashes every few seconds and keeps doing so until i unlock it again . 
  why ? 
  i use it all the time . 
  if someone says something like `` let 's meet at 6 '' , then `` k '' is a perfect , quick to read confirmation . 
  if i feel generous with letters i 'll even use `` kk '' . 
  nice tucked stance on this one . 
  kind of mesmerizing .
