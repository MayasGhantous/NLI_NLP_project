  that 's how we dry our firewood , but we split it first . 
  best way to do it would probably be to prepare them when you saw the wood for chopping and then letting them dry with the split logs . 
  we have a roofed wood pile in the garden , one stack behind the extended garage roof and the finished wood for one winter in a separate basement room . 
  we do n't use it for cooking but we have a masonry heater ( german kachelofen , classic green tiles , looks somewhat like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sdryvhw.jpg ) ) that feeds into the living room and the kitchen and can be fired from the hallway . 
  we have full central heating , but it 's somehow a nicer heat and atmosphere , if that makes sense . 
  that was a marketing campaign by the outdoor outfitter [ mammut ] ( http://www.mammut.ch/ ) . 
  still very cool . 
  that depends on the type of lab . 
  if contamination of the stuff inside the box is the main issue , then it 's pressurized with filtered air to avoid anything getting in . 
  if you work on hazardous stuff then the air is sucked out through filtering systems , thereby creating a slight vacuum , so no dangerous stuff can get in the room around the box . 
  * days, 
  groundhog day reference . 
  wow, 
  i think it depends on the card itself . 
  just give here a copy of [ rfc 5321 ] ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321 ) . 
  they are . 
  quote from the megadeth song '' \u00c0 tout le monde '' . 
  nice , will deploy this some time soon . 
  does it only eject disc drives or does it also eject hard drives ? 
  edit : it checks for cdrom drives . 
  idk if it works for dvd or blueray drives . 
  that wo n't harm you ... 
  can you get shadowbanned from a specific subreddit ? 
  i thought it was just the admins that do that and it 's site-wide . 
  can moderators see what shadowbanned people write ? 
  / r/bmw . 
  all the others are inferior . 
  ^ just ^ kidding ^ but ^ bmws ^ still ^ rock, 
  every one in computer science starts counting at 0 . 
  what credit card is it ? 
  problem is , at wot my car will keep on accelerating until it reaches about 150 mph . 
  also , my peak torque is at 1750-3000 rpm ( diesel ) . 
  if you are fine with speding quite a bit of money , the best address in munich is a rather unique one called [ tantris ] ( http://www.tantris.de/home.php ) , you can give that a visit . 
  is it ? 
  looks normal to me ... 
  i like how they took several german color names and just omitted the umlaut instead of correctly substituting it by adding a ` e ' after it . 
  mintgr\u00fcn would be mintgruen , not mintgrun . 
  i like the e90 cup holders , they hold german standard 0.5 l beer bottles perfectly . 
  it 's a turbocharged 1.5 l 3 cylinder that already produces 228 hp . 
  i doubt a supercharger would get significantly more out of that ... 
  i 'm genuinely curious : i 'm trilingual , should i ever have children , what 's the best way to teach them all 3 languages ? 
  switch languages each day ? 
  i still have quite some time until that gets relevant ( probably , you never know ) , and i 'd probably consult some sort of expert on that matter . 
  video not available . 
  but the festival is stuttgart is not called oktoberfest , it 's called cannstatter wasn . 
  i think this joke went over the heads of many . 
  linking to that sub is the reddit equivalent of giving someone a card like that . 
  do you know the difference between a cult and a religion ? 
  there is someone at the head of a cult who knows it 's all just made up bullshit . 
  in a religion that person has died . 
  why do n't you just go to work early ? 
  do n't you get overtime ? 
  i use blues at home , browns at work and i really like both , but if i had the option i world use blues at work , too . 
  i just love the sound , it 's so relaxing to me . 
  sweet i always thought we should do more with that data . 
  why would you want to see the empty stash ? 
  did n't datamancer die ? 
  if you want to hashtag on reddit you have to add a \\ \\ before the \\ # . 
  so you would write, 
  \\ #kotlfails, 
  and it would produce, 
  \\ #kotlfails,

  i 'm gon na write a bot for this comment someday ... 
  blademail is viable too , if you have the hp to survive it . 
  60 fps video . 
  yes , but if you submit the same link then you get the `` other discussions '' links at the top where you can see where else this link has been submitted . 
  my guess would be the spider attached a lot of spider silk to the rock , and the spider silk contracted when it hardened/dried and it thereby pulled the rock off the ground . 
  in that case guinsoos is also only viable if you catch her before she triggers the bkb . 
  oh right , i had forgotten about this mode . 
  it was really fun . 
  i do n't think it 's even a 335 , look at the front brake discs . 
  it looks like he 's still about a meter away from the bike , so it 's probably ok . 
  the pilots of the blackbirds makes it sound like these are the only pilots and there is only one plane . 
  there were several planes and a lot of pilots in the blackbird program , until in was retired in 1998 . 
  the last flight of a blackbird was in 1999 . 
  it 's actually in slovenia , see the other comments . 
  lidl can be found all over europe , and has become very present in eastern europe in recent years . 
  ce is in this case the city of [ celje ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celje ) . 
  german firefighters are typically dressed black with neon green reflectors or orange with white reflectors . 
  radiators in cars ? 
  i 've never seen that . 
  however , i can just tell my car to use the vents in the foot area and / or at the windscreen if i do n't want direct air . 
  very nice , new phone background . 
  maybe i 'll even cause some heart attacks on the subway with it :d, 
  in germany artificially colored whisky has to be labelled as such . 
  even some single malt is coloured using sugar coloring . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://what-if.xkcd.com/6/ ), 
  you could have probably just omitted the tape and polished the surface . 
  all the packaging tape does is compensate the rougher surface . 
  for refence , [ here ] ( http://runawaybrainz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/audio-crystal-cmoy-freeform-headphone.html ) is one of the cooles epoxy projects i know of . 
  dict buy them an / / / m belt if they do n't drive an / / / m car . 
  i would feel stupid wearing it . 
  wow please uninstall dota and never come back to this community . 
  they are the best part about those robots . 
  i 've seen this before , but still : what sorcery is this !,
