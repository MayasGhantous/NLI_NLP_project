  it used to stand for motorsport , but nowadays it stands for marketing . 
  i really like my e91 320d . 
  177 hp , 350 nm is plenty power and it pretty much needs no fuel at all . 
  those will go on my wagon next summer , but i 'll get them in hyper silver . 
  i love those actually . 
  probably flux . 
  i say that 's the right way to do it . 
  tum is financed by german tax payers for german students , so every one without german or eu citizenship should pay . 
  it 's ibuypower , a really bad manufacturer of pre-built `` gaming '' pcs . 
  i also like to cruise around at night playing ingress in my bmw . 
  i might need to install a smartphone mount just for that . 
  do n't drive around with the fog lights on if there 's not fog , makes you look like a moron . 
  no , they need it because they would be fwd without the awd , but a bmw is rwd . 
  i bet that one was n't a pc issure , na ` vi paused on purpose . 
  learn to type please . 
  start anti-poaching tourism for gun nuts . 
  bait the poachers with elephants and then have some overly armed rich guys shoot them . 
  tum student here , this slide is not on the main campus in the city center of munich , it 's in the building for mathmatics in the garching campus . 
  the slides are curved following the formula z = y = hx ^ ( 2 ) / d ^ 2 where h is the height of the entry points and 2d is the distance between the entry points .

  is this a reference i do n't get ? 
  it just looks like she was photographed without noticing , and she was carrying the banana skin because she did n't want to litter the cave ... 
  of course . 
  there are even burlap sacks provided so you go faster . 
  i think that would stick and slow you down . 
  reminds me of megadeth album art . 
  this kills the plant . 
  lorde lorde lorde , i am lorde , lorde lorde lorde , ja ja ja lorde . 
  e60 ingress cruiser , i like it . 
  did you put any ingress stickers on ? 
  at first i wanted to put a sticker [ like this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lcuauip.jpg ) on my rear bumper , but i just could n't do it . 
  i do n't see the slightly bigger shield capacity and the holding cells being worth the $ 50 upgrade from my digital pirate . 
  i wonder if they could hold on at autobahn speeds . 
  i saw a documentary where they were driving somewhere in the african savannah and found a wire snare . 
  the guide said they need to cut it up and discard it asap , because if you are caught with a wire snare in that region you will be executed , no questions asked . 
  well that 's not really that bad . 
  i never turned on any printer in my office , they are all always on standby and i can just print over the network . 
  i 'd shoot that goat if that was my car . 
  also , what 's up with that ferrari 's exhaust pipes , they look they belong on a honda or something , way to small and not chrome enough . 
  what 's special about this ? 
  any license plate joke i do n't get ? 
  is that serious ? 
  that 's on purpose ? 
  i have been on that edge . 
  it 's perfect . 
  e90 xenon hid headlights are sexy . 
  also , pre lci has the nicer front by far ( imho ) . 
  ftfy, 
  is that modified ? 
  that camber is for looks only . 
  did you even look at the pictures ? 
  he placed a 64gb micro sd on it . 
  follow the auto moderator advice , install deluge , it 's better . 
  or go full master race and run rtorrent . 
  i really like the chrome accents above the kidneys . 
  how does vivino compare to cellar tracker ? 
  very nicely written article , another quality onion release . 
  maybe that was caused by her kneeling on the ground * for some reason . 
  that 's my first thought as well . 
  i ca n't recommend [ cantina tramin ] ( http://www.cantinatramin.it/en/1/84/collection-/classic-/classici-monovitigni-gew%c3%bcrztraminer.htm ) ( tramin , trentino alto-adige/s \u00fcdtirol , italy ) enough , it 's where the gew\u00fcrztraminer grapes are native . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  i play ingress , i 've met about 20 nexus 5 users alone while playing ingress . 
  also , if you design a specification always initialize the crc with ' 1 ' , because if you initialize with ' 0 ' it ca n't distinguish two data sets that differ only in leading zeros . 
  the more you know \u2122, 
  that is n't possible in germany . 
  you always need to have 2 plates , and they need to go the same , ofc . 
  you found the cure to depression , spread it :d, 
  is that a drit road connecting those houses ? 
  where is this ? 
  i `` only '' have the professional hi-fi with the twin subwoofers under the front seats . 
  but i only use that for music , i do n't pay ingress with sound . 
  yep . 
  if you want to donate hair , do n't donate it to locks of love , find a different company . 
  24 , but the rest is correct . 
  also the main beer content of that fridge is not stout beer , it 's only a few guiness , the rest is german beer . 
  i also like to cook , but you ca n't see that in this picture since i usually only do that on the weekend . 
  the only stuff left from that is a bit of parsley and a stump of parmiggiano reggiano . 
  i 'm not actually a bavarian , i only live in bavaria . 
  does n't bread keep better outside of the fridge ? 
  good eye on the tegernseer , best beer imho . 
  i 'm swabian , but i go to tum in munich . 
  it came with the fridge . 
  it 's a rather nice fridge from the german premium manufacturer `` liebherr '' . 
  i think it 's more made for white wine/champagne . 
  it 's similar to [ this model ] ( http://www.amazon.de/liebherr-cpesf-k%c3%bchlschrank-k%c3%bchlteil-gefrierteil/dp/b00aqgyv1w/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1413491985&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=liebherr+comfort ) but not exactly the same . 
  i will probably remove the glass panel above it so i can stack beer on the metal thing . 
  i do n't like to stack beer on the glass plates as sometimes a beer drops down when you remove one of the bottom ones . 
  edit : [ found the exact model ] ( http://www.liebherr.com/hg/en-gb/region-de/products_hg.wfw/id-1555116-0_31281-2 ) . 
  since it fits 750ml wine and champagne bottles very well it should do nicely with your beer sizes . 
  shamless plug for / r/guesstheasl where ppl . 
  post their fridges or similar and other people then guess their circumstances . 
  actually putting the engine at the top does not make it fly more stable , in fact quite the opposite is true . 
  this is known as the [ pendulum rocket fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pendulum_rocket_fallacy ) . 
  oh come on . 
  i missed the last one and i 'm not in munich on the 21 . 
  nice car but i really do n't like the interior . 
  many people in the german bmw communities recommend changing it at 100 000 km . 
  they recommend going to a zf service point since it 's cheaper than at a dealer but still very high quality work .
