  imho it harmonizes nicely with the wheels and other trim . 
  it 's not tacky if it 's balanced . 
  here ( germany ) you fail inspection if any load-bearing part ( suspension , frame ) of your car shows any signs of rust . 
  `` objects in mirror are losing . '', 
  engines are waterproof .

  i just imagined ron swanson saying that . 
  now i want to own a dog and only talk to it in my most serious voice . 
  just use cerberus for tracking and save the resources from that nonsencial anti-virus app . 
  if you get angry with the gross thing istead of just being grossed out by it . 
  that really bothers me as well . 
  we use si-prefixes for everything , even grams when going down ( miligram etc. ), 
  but nobody ever uses megagra , or gigagram , why is that ? 
  i just thought posting some helloween on halloween was a good idea :d, 
  idk , but the way he is sitting down just looks like he 's on the toilet ... 
  literally . 
  335 has exhauts on the left and right side . 
  he has the one-sided performance exhaust , so it 's a 325 or 330 . 
  i , too , advocate adding acid to the water supply . 
  [ gentle manne of leisure ] ( https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvlfa.jpg ) did it in 1814 . 
  conde nast is moving in there . 
  they own reddit . 
  edit : used to own . 
  it could also be the wagon , but i hear they are like unicorns in the us . 
  i think you took a wrong turn somewhere ... 
  the control unit is in the trunk , the antenna is below the light selector . 
  the mic is in the ceiling unit . 
  in europe only the uk drive on the left side ... 
  you really should n't install hid without auto leveling . 
  sorry did n't think of those as they do n't exist in europe . 
  i think you understood me wrong . 
  your should only use headlights that have a auto-leveling system when you use hid lights in them . 
  it means they automatically adjust their height when the car is under different loads so you never blind anyone . 
  in some area those systems are required by law , but most retrofit kits do n't have that feature . 
  what ? 
  let him have fun . 
  or megadeth , fits their sci-fy cover style very well . 
  i had a rambus pc . 
  that ram really was seriously fast . 
  no it does n't . 
  there is a wire harness that runs in the lower left door frames . 
  it splits off underneath the steering column . 
  one part goes up through the a pillar and to the roof center , the other part is attached to the antenna . 
  also there is a optical fiber connecting the module in the boot to the control module in the front . 
  if your have usb audio then the usb connector in the center console is also connected to that wire harness as it also uses the module in the boot . 
  i had bluetooth retrofitted in mine and i watched / helped the guy do it that 's how i know that . 
  also , i do have idrive , but i 'm sure it 's the same .

  traffic and parking . 
  i just got back from shopping and stopped next to the house i 'm living in to unload stuff . 
  you 're not allowed to park there so the trash cans can get emptied , but they do n't get emptied today . 
  nontheless , when i came back from unloading some woman was furious how i could park there . 
  it was like i killed her dog or something , but it 's just a minor traffic violation . 
  i generally feel that more people percieve every minor violation or inconvenience i cause as an outrage , even more so since i switched to bmw . 
  people just assume bmw drivers are assholes , i guess . 
  i personally use a x52 pro hotas , so i also use analog collective control . 
  the throttle has a little bump in the middle telling you when it 's centered , but that 's also not 100 % accurate . 
  that 's not a problem , though , as i usually apply about -10 % collective on the final landing approach anyways . 
  i recommend going in zeus mode and fly around using any helo you like and land in more and more challenging places . 
  if you fuck you you can just spawn a new helo anywhere you want on the fly . 
  at first i accidentally bound the sideways axis of my joystick to `` turn left / right '' instead of `` cyclic left / right '' . 
  that changes the behaviour and uses pedal input when you try to bank at low speed . 
  until i changed that i also had troubles landing safely . 
  now progress on to behemoth and you will reach your final form . 
  love it . 
  german here . 
  i 've never used a check in my life ( 24y ) . 
  i usually just open a multiplayer game for myself . 
  sometimes some friends join and hang out , trying out different mechanics . 
  even in 2004 nobody used them anymore . 
  it 's a b6 , not a b7 ... 
  holy shit , i 'd probably die if i got to drive that . 
  but it would be so much fun up until that point :d, 
  i did n't find it all that hard , granted i 've only really tried it with the m900 so far . 
  it 's actually a greentext originally : https://i.imgur.com/dggvgkf.png, 
  how do you attach boats to a pickup ? 
  you can lift vehicles even if players are in it . 
  did you try unbinding the mouse from the free look directions ? 
  he would probably have hung himself in a hotel room somwhere in vegas if he 'd lost . 
  how is the spoiler attached ? 
  is it just like glued on ? 
  you could order any e90 without idrive . 
  if you like military games and want a more analytical , less arcade approach try out arma 3 . 
  it 's the best military sim i 've ever played . 
  behemoth, 
  i 'm of the elusive `` metal & amp ; drum 'n base '' taste . 
  why ? 
  this is not really a flattering photo of it , but i like the [ k\u00f6nigsplatz ] ( https://i.imgur.com/b7k7qyn.jpg ) since it contains a bunch of statues in display cases . 
  [ geor-brauchle-ring ] ( https://i.imgur.com/x4vbsdu.jpg ) also looks quite nice . 
  this picture also demonstrates the subway trains . 
  never played that one , but seems similar to [ forsaken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forsaken_%28video_game%29 ) , which is quite a bit newer , though . 
  for future reference , dubai is not a country . 
  hong kong kind of is , but it 's also part is china . 
  \\ #justbeyerdynamicthings, 
  is rocksand the americanized version of feinstein ? 
  what 's your religious belief then ? 
  oh yes , i know someone who 's wife insists wifi harms their childen , so they ca n't have wifi . 
  i see it partially the same way . 
  imho it 's a good sign if the advanced flight model gives an advatage to hotas users , but with the advanced flight model disabled i think kb & mouse should be a viable option .
