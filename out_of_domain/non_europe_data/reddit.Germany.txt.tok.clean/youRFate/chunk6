  actually the problem lies within the youtube app . 
  this is just a workaround . 
  no , you wo n't see it with a multimeter . 
  also , if you decide to look at it with an oscilloscope , make sure the charger is under load , e.g. 
  charging something , because it might look fine while it 's idle . 
  watch this : http://www.scope-of-the-art.com/en/touch_the_future/ it 's also windows based . 
  hint : you probably ca n't afford it . 
  what 's up with that qr code in the lower left corner ? 
  could n't scan it , would have to pump the brightness way to high ... 
  edit :, 
  `` super secret qr code ... photo by ace winterrowd ; c2012 www.ydafs.com '', 
  my screen is a bit brighter since it 's my gaming pc , and i was just walking back to it and thus viewing form a distorted angle ( from above ) . 
  i used photoshop to drastically increase the brightness of that part of the image and scanned it off the screen with my android phone . 
  wtf , 80 $ per month ? 
  is that common in the us ? 
  do you at least get the phone for free then ? 
  what flatrates are typically included ? 
  what distance are we talking about and what is in between sender and reciever ? 
  this is relevant to your question 1 . 
  also , how important is latency ? 
  would it be possible to check for a on/off signal only a few times a day ? 
  which would mean you permanently send the signal ( assuming power consumation in the sender is not relevant ) and only pick it up like 10 times a day . 
  you could also have a look at the [ ti ez430 chronos ] ( http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/ez430-chronos ) which features ultra low power consumption while having an rf transciever ( ti cc430 soc ) . 
  what do you think , how far are we away from a working aircrack suit on android without external hardware ? 
  how do you find out if a ethiopian woman is pregnant ? 
  hold her against the sun . 
  some restaurants get frozen foods packed in styrofoam packages with dry ice as coolant . 
  any news on that one ? 
  will sense 4.0 come with the ics update for my htc sensation xe ? 
  i sure hope so ... 
  pretty much anything turn based , like for example civ . 
  yes , but given the high current flow an opamp based solution would not prove to be easy ( for example shorting them over the coin ), 
  the torch looks shopped over the original torch ... no refelctions of any sort on it and no sparks in the foreground over it ... 
  also there does n't seem to be a wall between those `` stalls '' , which would be even more uncomfortable ... 
  japanese toilets would like to have a word about that ... 
  gameboid , which is not on the market . 
  idk , but it looks like a party i would have loved beeing at ... 
  wow , that sure was one hungry cat :d, 
  i have the same . 
  while it is a really good router , it lacks 2 things :, 
  * it 's not supported by dd-wrt firmware, 
  * it does not support ipv6, 
  hmm , that fw ist not compatible with my hw revision , since i have the first one . 
  dd-wrt would be nice for all it 's added functionality , like vpn server . 
  if you have line-of-sight you could do it via wireless lan :, 
  * 2x http://www.amazon.com/alfa-weatherproof-performance-reflector-wireless/dp/b004k2i70e/ref=sr_1_10?s=electronics&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1330974444&amp;sr=1-10, 
  * 2x http://www.amazon.com/alfa-waterproof-outdoor-wireless-integrated/dp/b003ilwrli/ref=sr_1_20?s=electronics&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1330974494&amp;sr=1-20, 
  179,96 $ ( excluding shipping , cables etc. . . ), 
  warning : that wireless lan adapter is 2w ( = 33dbm ) , with that 24dbi antenna you are at about 57db , which massively exceeds the regulations here in germany , you 'd have to check that with your local legislation ... 
  oops , i assumed 500m , you 're right , for ~ 150m a salad bowl would probably do ... 
  yes , at this short distance he probably does n't even have to traverse property he does n't own so installing some fiber should n't be too much of a problem there . 
  it just usually is easier to mount 2 dishes than to get all the permissions to lay a cable from a to b. 
  also , are there any available 802.11 ad/ac devices yet ? 
  nope it is n't , neither is it a great beer . 
  source : i 'm german . 
  you 're obviously being downvoted by reddit 's smart driver comunity ... 
  or pc 360 , which i prefer for the comfort and better sound quality, 
  i can tell you it 's great :d, 
  that is synonymous with saying `` it feels good '' . 
  question is why are endorphins released . 
  not available in your country ... 
  last line should have been : `` emotional systems checked , unit ready for shipping . '', 
  not yet here in germany ... 
  my htc sensation xe on 2.3.4 takes screenshots with powerbutton + homebutton ... 
  juicedefender ultimate can also do that, 
  i think i could never use used in ear headphones ... 
  when i drove to italy my carrier politely informed me of the following : data usage : 15 $ / 200kb ... 
  i do n't think that would make any difference now ... 
  i do n't get it ... 
  hmm at that price we europeans could really consider ordering from amazon.com instead ... 
  you can use this : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modaco.thedeck.android.app&amp;feature=more_from_developer, 
  updated version of tweetdeck, 
  what external amp would you suggest to power high quality headphones ? 
  i 'm fine with google wallet , since i already use it for the android market ( aka google play now ) , but i would n't register to a social network since it seems unnecessary ... 
  could be camera artifacts from the sudden strong exposure . 
  no , there is no need for physical video game shops . 
  i would if i would n't just have gotten my sensation ... 
  except those do n't have stingers ... 
  http://ebookee.org/ is good for technical books, 
  hmm now all they need to do is to actually release the ics ota for my sensation ... 
  still watiting ... 
  do want . 
  juice defender can do this , at least in the ultimate version . 
  i can only confirm this problem , me and 2 friends have the same problem , and it makes that tutorial really hard . 
  i also like how the designer just wrote `` car logo '' on the top instead of putting the logo resembling a car there ... 
  then tell me how the huawei is more popular than the iphone ? 
  i mean , the huawei sure is the better phone for poweruses , but if it is a popularity contest , that seems off . 
  relevant : [ retro hardware : n64 dd [ youtube ] ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zwbzbesrsi ), 
  nope it 's fraud , but nobody does anything about it . 
  edit : downvotes , really ? 
  even the german wikipedia states that oktoberfest customers lose about 4.8 million $ each oktoberfest because they receive less than the 1 liter of beer they payed for . 
  did you enable hardware acceleration in firefox ? 
  who says the bus was n't empty ? 
  probably the finger of the camera man shutting the camera off ... 
  i think it should be analyzed how the gender difference is in different cultures that have a completely different letter systems , e.g. 
  arabic or japanese . 
  in the ultimate version you can select a threshold of used bandwidth over which it will not shut down the connection . 
  unlimited speeds represent !, 
  my htc could do screenshots on gingerbread by power + home button , not sure if lg has that though ...
