  what ever method or device you use for opening , it should never penetrate the bottom of the cork . 
  just tried it , i hear a really faint little pop on mine , quieter than when the camera focuses . 
  do you consider putting bmw center caps in non-bmw wheels cheating ? 
  i will be putting [ vmr v710 ] ( http://www.vmrwheels.eu/vmr-wheels-v710/v710-8-5x19-et35-5x120-72-6-hs.html ) wheels on my car next spring , but i like the look of using bmw center caps . 
  oh yes , winter increases the amount of curves that i take sideways by about 80 % . 
  before anyone asks , yes i run winter tires ( continental wintercontact 225 on bmw styling 158 wheels ) and i only drift when i want to . 
  netflix knows that you 're into stance . 
  i use a create of old parts for that . 
  recently someone needed something from it , i panicked for a while , but they put it back . 
  kicad is actually pretty good , it 's well worth the time it takes to download . 
  you have been banned fom / r/subaru . 
  try the non-gif version : http://www.gfycat.com/enchantingwaterloggedcutworm, 
  what 's so bad about dsl ? 
  i can get 50 mbps dsl here . 
  for comparison : for my bmw the headrest is about $ 230 , including leather . 
  cloth ones are about $ 150 total . 
  all of india has starving poor people , but they have golden buddahs everywhere . 
  all i want is one golden gaben , but immedieately that is * `` too far '' * and i should give it * `` to charity '' * . 
  fuck this , i want a golden gaben . 
  plenty of them here in germany . 
  no , please do n't . 
  the chrome is so much nicer imho . 
  is that brace stock ? 
  a nice silver bmw lettering in the center would make it perfect . 
  mechanical means it uses cherry mx switches , right ? 
  yes , i 'll go there alone as well . 
  let 's have a few beers and listen to awesome metal there !, 
  germany here , automatic is still a niche thing here . 
  most cars are manual and most people order manual . 
  [ augustiner br\u00e4u ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustiner_br%c3%a4u ) is the oldest brewery in munich . 
  it 's in business since 1328 , and it 's one of the most consumed beers here . 
  they have never done any radio , tv or print advertising . 
  they have n't even changed the bottle label in 20 years . 
  how does it work out which one is the illusion ? 
  that looks really nice . 
  i used to wear vans all the time , but recently i prefer fred perry . 
  they are also sturdy and comfortable , and i like the style more . 
  i like my women like i like my newspaper : daily fresh , thin and can take a few punches . 
  i do n't really see the point , it 's not like the munich subreddit is flooded with events . 
  somehow the worst for me is the front emblem facing the wrong way . 
  are you having a stroke ? 
   * good , * probably , * is , * relatively , * fbs , * are n't , * the right thing , * mean , * engravers , * stupidness, 
  also , it should be `` the second beast is probably wounded now '', 
  yes , it 's a beautiful place . 
  without it df would be unplayable for newcomers like myself . 
  i have accepted that there is a sub for everything , however , every now and then i 'm still surprised . 
  kein problem . 
  come at me bro . 
  nope , no clue about russian . 
  they usually accept bills up to 50 $ . 
  you can also pay with credit cards ( mastercard , visa and diner 's club ) as well as eurocard . 
  in addition to the post above , most braking is done by the front wheels . 
  as for brand , i have been using continental wintercontact on multiple cars , and they were always very good . 
  they usually win the tests by stiftung warentest ( independant german consumer organisation ) . 
  also , most of those fancy designer corkscrews seriously suck . 
  some even only work if you drill them all the way through the cork . 
  i 'll keep using my waiter 's knife , thank you . 
  shame , i 'm at a concert on the 13th . 
  i live in giesing as well and i would have loved to try out that brewery . 
  edit : i just realized you want to meet at 3 pm , that should be prossible . 
  one of them did die . 
  the other barely survived . 
  edit : i stand corrected , they did survive . 
  aww ... 
  moore 's law itself did not stop happening , the transistor count is still rising exponentially . 
  however , we did stop increasing the clock frequency for power and heat reasons , following the breakdown of the dennard scaling . 
  because of that the most substatial improvements in computation power are currently gained by improving the microarchitecture , most notable example was the introduction of the core 2 duo cpus by intel . 
  this is following a rule called pollack 's rule . 
  how so ? 
  yes , multicore processing is only an example of improved microarchitectures and therefore improved instruction sets . 
  the phenomenon you are talking about is formulated in pollack 's rule , which describes the increase in effectiveness . 
  interestingly , clock speeds actually went down by a consierable ammount after the p4 and are only now reaching the same level again , and only in enthusiast cpus like the intel extreme edition series . 
  depends on how much you already know . 
  the basics are what a [ microarchitecture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microarchitecture ) is and how it works . 
  it 's important to understand that not only the clock frequency is important , but also the ammount of instructions per clock cycle , and what those instructions can do , e.g. 
  can it do a full multiplication per cycle or only an addtition . 
  if you want to learn practically you could learn how to write assembly code and do some optimization on it . 
  [ raspberry pi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raspberry_pi ) computers lend themselves nicely for this task , since the [ arm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arm_architecture ) instruction set is relatively easy to understand . 
  if you want to learn about [ moore 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moore%27s_law ) itself then the wikipedia article is a good starting point . 
  also , the [ list of microprocessor architectures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microprocessor_chronology ) as well as intel 's own archive of architectures called [ intel ark ] ( http://ark.intel.com/ ) are interesting sources on the history of computing . 
  yes , there is definitely a hard limit on transistor size minimization , but there are other ways to increase the number , maybe we will at some point figure out how to effectively produce more than one layer of transistors and interconnects on the same wafer . 
  if you look at a wafer , we are currently only using a incredibly thin layer on the surface , and several overlayed layers of metal for interconnect . 
  there is a massive ammount of wafer that is not actively being used . 
  it 's a tip of the iceberg kind of situation . 
  there are some examples where more than one layer is used , for example by stacking a second chip on top and bonding it through holes or by flipping the top one over and connecting the metal layeres . 
  however , the real challenge is to build 3d circuit structures in a single wafer . 
  that 's a very old german joke translated to english , see https://i.imgur.com/sfw39i3.jpg . 
  you sure that low is fake ? 
  why would anyone have streched tires like that without properly slamming the car ? 
  i come from a place near n\u00f6rdlingen , that red house is actually a pretty awesome pizza place , a buddy of mine used to bartend there . 
  if i lived somewhere colder than here ( germany ) then i 'd get a heater installed . 
  a friends e60 has that installed . 
  it heats the whole cars , all snow / ice thaws off and it nice and cozy inside . 
  it 's also good for the engine , it never has to do a cold start . 
  i do n't know what they are called in english , but it 's not one of those electric block heaters where you have a plug in the grill , it uses fuel and heats the engine coolant , which is also connected to a radiator in the car 's interior . 
  there are original bmw variants , or after market versions , sold for example by webasto . 
  eu mandates a 2 year waranty , free of charge , for anything you buy . 
  eu citizen here . 
  all retailers are forced to grant you a 2 year no questions asked waranty on anything you buy . 
  if anything does not work as advertised within that period they are bound to repair it , replace it with a working unit or give you a full refund .
