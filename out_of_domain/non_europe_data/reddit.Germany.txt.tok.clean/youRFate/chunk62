  this question came to my mind after a friend showed me his [ renault laguna keycard ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bafypps.jpg ) . 
  the hole for the keyring is on the end which you have to insert in the slot . 
  see my [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2npoze/what_is_a_design_so_obviously_flawed_that_you_can/cmfpay7 ) for an example of what i meant . 
  another example is swapping bulbs on my bmw . 
  high and low beams are somewhat ok , you have to turn in the wheel all the way , then you can open a small flap in the fender liner and access the bulbs from there . 
  however , in order to change the parking light you need to remove the wheel and the fender liner . 
  and then you need special bulbs for them which are about $ 30 each ... 
  i think this is the retorfit kit for the e46 http://www.realoem.com/bmw/showparts.do?model=al71&amp;mospid=47634&amp;btnr=64_1178&amp;hg=64&amp;fg=95 . 
  iirc there are several versions , some have a remote control , others have a mobile phone installed that you can call to start the heater . 
  i also do n't know if there is a version for cars with gasoline engines for the e46 . 
  i know there are both variants for later cars . 
  all in all i 'd probably go with an after market solution for an e46 , as they probably have more advanced control options . 
  this feature has ben available in europe since for ever , for cars of pretty much every manufacturer . 
  and webasto has been selling after market kits for pretty much all cars . 
  it 's especailly popular with diesel cars because diesel oil is easily and safely burnable for heating and diesel engines start having problems starting when it 's cold , especially older engines . 
  another nice feature is if you have start/stop system the heater stays on while the engine is off , for example at railroad crossings . 
  i love bass ... that 's why i use beyerdynamic dt 990 pro headphones . 
  bass with surgical precision and an impact like an 18 wheeler . 
  maybe we should post in / r/metal shortly before the gig . 
  are those vmr v710 ? 
  i plan on getting those for mine as well , next summer . 
  come on , all the cool things happen when i 'm not in munich . 
  the most likely thing to happen is that the road will be closed until the beavers did their thing . 
  beavers are incredbily protected here since they are somewhat of a rare species . 
  that 's not a straight razor , that 's a shavette . 
  it looks like a straight razor , but it uses a replaceable blade . 
  what 's wrong with those bbs weels ? 
  very nice car , but this subreddit does n't really share that view ... 
  if you did n't already you should x-post it over to / r/stance , it will be appreciated a lot more there . 
  what worries me is that that emergency key looks well used/worn . 
  that 's not really a good sign . 
  also , does that type of spare key only come with 5 series cars ? 
  my 3 series does n't have one . 
  are you missing a lug nut on the front wheel there ? 
  i think you should look into new wheels before investing in any suspension modifications . 
  i 'd recommend looking at enkei or sparco wheels , they will fit your car nicely and you can get them at a bargain price point . 
  problem is your nicer wheels will probably be wider than your steelies and will probably have a different offset . 
  there 's a cool subreddit for stuff like that , companies trying too hard to fit in . 
  i just forgot it 's name ... 
  i like the stuff from [ andeluna ] ( http://www.andeluna.com.ar/ ) . 
  especially the malbec 1300 . 
  looks like a9 , north of munich . 
  he did n't use any helicopters . 
  tires not streched enough , not enough camber . 
  just to add to that list . 
  also , the stance crowd usually spends quite a bit of money on the cars and modifications , they would n't be caught dead with a fake m. 
  part numbers for your color should be 51419150340 , should be around $ 10 . 
  it 's labled 18 in [ this diagram on realoem ] ( http://realoem.com/bmw/showparts.do?model=vu51&amp;mospid=50501&amp;btnr=51_5835&amp;hg=51&amp;fg=50 ) . 
  i 'm a bit confused , but i think 18 is the structure inside the handle , and the clasp listed directly below 18 is the part you are looking for . 
  my 2007 2l diesel bmw does about 150 mph . 
  my 1999 2l gasoline merc i had before it did about 135 mph . 
  i wondered whey they did n't surround his car with cop cars the second he stopped . 
  nobody drove past him , they all stopped behind him . 
  actually it happens more then you 'd think . 
  just do n't drive when every body else is driving . 
  oh autobahn , you maddest invention of us germans , please never change . 
  not nearly all men pee sitting down , even if there are signs up . 
  source : me and all of my friends . 
  when i drive home and it 's not overly full i 'll just put it on cruise control 180 km/h and wait until i 'm home . 
  yes , i 'm that guy on the left though . 
  very nice gunfire . 
  that 's called `` germany '' . 
  best robot ever . 
  it even won at least one fight !, 
  that 5 series front is just beyond savage . 
  i love it . 
  that thing looks like it eats audis for breakfast . 
  somehow the accents in your post are shown as black diamonds with question marks , probably some encoding problem . 
   premier secret confi\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9nus, 
  should display nicely . 
  yes , same for me . 
  i use hair wax and hairspray every day . 
  the next moring i have to shampoo to get all the old product out . 
  antonio stella bottom tile . 
  talisker was my introduction to island single malts . 
  after that i went on to trying all the awe inspring stuff from islay . 
  it 's glenlivet and ardbeg uigeadail , you actually managed to misspell every one of those words ... 
  appart from that , nice first review . 
  nice review , however , there is only one r in ardbeg . 
  in the beginning it was glenfiddich 12 -  glenfiddich 18 -  talisker 10 -  ardbeg 10 -  laphroaig 10 , then it all became fuzzy :d . 
  which mpc do you prefer ? 
  do you use mpc-hc , mpc-be , or something entirely different ? 
  also , i have pretty much the same interior , brown dakota leather and silver trim , looks grogeous . 
  is that a us import or why does it have the yellow side markers ? 
  mine are clear . 
   a dude ... ** my ** keychain, 
  i found the guy . 
  happy birthday !, 
  this is the # 1 weird thing about the us for me . 
  being excited about drinking beer at 21 . 
  here you call legally drink wine and beer at 14 . 
  germany . 
  we can have wine and beer at 14 , when in company of parents and they consent . 
  at 16 we can have beer and wine whenever we want , without any parents . 
  at 18 all alcohol , including all kinds of liquor , are legal . 
  german here , every bar in rural baden-w\u00fcrttemberg and bavaria has one , but nobody has it on the menu , you have to ask for it . 
  i have a white one and i love it . 
  i would be very sad if i had to send it in for waranty and they would send me a black one back . 
  that one has actually been in this sub before , but it 's really awesome . 
  i like both , except for the bmw emblem with changed colors , that 's utter blasphemy and the car should be taken away from them .
