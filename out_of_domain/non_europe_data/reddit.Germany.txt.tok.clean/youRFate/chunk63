  it 's like hanging a green and yellow us flag . 
  munich , anyone ? 
  the manufacturer of the right movement is obviously [ iwc schwaffhausen ] ( http://www.iwc.com/en/ ) , the watch is one of the portuguese chronographs . 
  the one on the left is by [ audemars piguet ] ( http://www.audemarspiguet.com/en/ ) , it 's a minute repeater movement . 
  is there no 2l diesel engine in the us ? 
  i have the e91 version of that engine , 177hp , 350nm . 
  it 's more fun that i thought , and it uses less and cheaper fuel . 
  there some more info on the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blautopf ) . 
  it looks small but its nearly 70ft . 
  deep . 
  it also feeds a historic [ hammer mill ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zu4q2py.jpg ) . 
  the water colour depends heavily on the illumination , but it 's always unusually blue or [ turqouis ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6qqplxz.jpg ) . 
  what 's yellow and ca n't swim ? ... an excavator . 
  why not ? ... it only has one arm . 
  our front door can be locked so that it requires a key to open . 
  it has a pretty complicated mechanism , when you just close it like usual it will extend a whole lot of bars into the frame , but they all come out when you push the door handle inside . 
  however , when you lock the door with a key the bars extend further and the door handle is completely blocked from moving . 
  the german translation of `` escalate '' is `` eskalieren '' , but the etymology is different . 
  we did n't derive it from escalators , we took it from the french word `` escalier '' for stairs , and it 's a lot older than the english counterpart . 
  only wild ones or also total camels ? 
  as in , does any country have more camels than australia , not resticted to wild ones ? 
  for those wondering , it 's one of the mounting points on [ this plane ] ( https://i.imgur.com/9pikzwa.jpg ) . 
  real cooking knives are never toothed . 
  the only serrated knives that get used in professional kitches are bread and sometimes cheese knifes . 
  in general you only need two knives in a kitchen : one classic chef 's knife or a santoku and one small knife . 
  that should be enough for cooking any meal . 
  on top of that there are a few specialty knives like bread knifes or long and finely bladed boning and filleting knives . 
  i 'm on a student budget , so i got a zwilling j.a. 
  henckels santoku knife for general cooking , as you can get them fairly cheap and they are of decent quality . 
  oh , i just created a separate thread by accident . 
  see you at the concert !, 
  anyone else comming ? 
  oops , i just realized [ someone else has already put up a thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metal/comments/2p47ax/any_m%c3%bcnchen_metalheads_going_to_be_at_the_vader/ ) . 
  not really . 
  jumping off a building you 'd hit 100 km/h after 2,832 seconds , assuming there is no air resistance . 
  there are quite a few cars that are faster than that . 
  i always wanted to get reddit silver , thanks for making that dream come true :3 . 
  i actually just calculated it . 
  km/h to m/s is really easy , you just divide by 3.6 . 
  then divide that by earth 's acceleration , which is about 9.81 m/s ^ 2 . 
  yep , i 'm psyched as fuck . 
  update : just came home from the gig , it totally killed . 
  especially arch enemy and kreator . 
  i just wished arch enemy would have played more from the older albums , but oh well ... 
  cool , looks incredibly responsive . 
  tip : do n't like the `` giant '' version , that 's just the original gif . 
  link the webm version : http://gfycat.com/lazylastingborer, 
  it 's a lot faster . 
  that wing ties the whole thing together . 
  i actually ordered a xbox 360 controller yesterday for an unrelated game . 
  i bought dark souls at some steam sale in the past and have n't played it yet . 
  this is perfect timing , i download the beta build over night ( slow internet right now ) . 
  i 'm kinda hyped . 
  / r/arma would dominate everything . 
  that cat is at least as confused as you are . 
  in german the word are spelled the same , candle wax is spelled `` wachs '' , growing translates to `` wachsen '' . 
  i think you 're making a joke , but if you 're not :, 
  retro here stands for retrograde , meaning in the opposite direction of the velocity vector , aka slowing down . 
  my controller has since arrived and i can confirm both analog throttle and brakes on the current release version . 
  i am , however , i 'm currently powering through transistor , amazing game !, 
  the very definition of vip slate . 
  and then there is / r/truegaming ... 
  electrochromic mirrors save the day . 
  also , i use the rear fog light to signal them , sometimes they genuinely just forgot . 
  this and the 80s speed metal butterfly . 
  care to explain ? 
  i seem to have missed that . 
  ouch . 
  the start garage is not unlocked and you ca n't unlock it since there are no other garages ... 
  i uncloaked the whole map , the only unlockable trucks are the jeep and the 7310 . 
  yes i 've noticed that , too . 
  however , i was playing hardcore so i could n't rescue to it anyways . 
  / r/etymology is that way :d, 
  austria , not australia . 
  how is it racist to wear mock-indian clothing ? 
  it also is n't racist for thousands of tourists to wear a bad mockery of the traditional bavarian clothing to oktoberfest each year . 
  it 's black red gold , the black is on top or on the left . 
  see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_germany ) for further details . 
  do n't leave a black bar between red and gold , it looks silly . 
  it 's really easy , just throw all the sd channles out of your channels list in your tv . 
  bam , only hdtv up in this bitch . 
  i wo n't have 7l displacement though , either . 
  martin sonneborn , one of their editors , stated :, 
  which translates to :, 
  reacting to satire by suing , canceling subscribtions or shooting kalashnikovs is regarded as unrefined in the scene . 
  our compassion is with our french colleagues . 
  this could never have happened at titanic , we only have 6 editors . 
  yes . 
  if they make it a 7l v12 and put an amazing suspension in it they can call it / / / m7 . 
  oh yes , this is awesome . 
  give me an m3 that looks like that . 
  that car is offensively ugly . 
  they are truly gorgeous . 
  i do . 
  you want some ? 
  do n't mind the photos , i want to murder that road with my car . 
  we have stuff like this for luggage on several train stations in germany . 
  you can even get you luggage back at a different terminal somewhere else in the station . 
  i 'm currently playing it for the first time . 
  when i noticed i can just unmount that very op gattling turrent and carry it around , still with infinite ammo , i was sold on the game .
