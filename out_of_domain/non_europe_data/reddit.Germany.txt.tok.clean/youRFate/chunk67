  do n't connect all the smaller roads directly to the highway . 
  i accumulate the traffic onto 4 or 6 lane roads , then merge them using highway roundabouts and then connect that to a highway exit . 
  my next plan is a bigger residential area with an elevated highway though it . 
  probably 2 exit points , i plan on using these [ texas u-turn ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405917643&amp;searchtext=texas ) highway intersections for that . 
  i really like [ this design ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405917643&amp;searchtext= ) on the workshop . 
  seems to work really well and does n't use a lot of space . 
  i also have a [ highway winding thorugh the city ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dajscap.jpg ) , but it 's not as scenic as yours . 
  yes , they seem to pick up enough speed . 
  also , if you have any input as to why those dams do n't work i 'd be happy . 
  i 've tried removing the water pumps in front of the , but that did n't help either . 
  very beautiful . 
  my sports suspension would like a work with you . 
  swabian currently living in munich , i have yet to find a bakery that makes decent prezels . 
  you can also play it online [ here ] ( http://pyx-1.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/ ) . 
  on a two button jacket you only ever do the upper one . 
  on three button you do the middle on , and optionally the top one , but never the bottom one . 
  those square buttons are the shit . 
  i do n't really know the reason , but you look like you do n't know what you 're doing when you do that button . 
  legend has it it 's because of a fat king , see [ here ] ( http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/04/02/art-of-manliness-suit-school-part-iii-a-primer-on-suit-buttons/ ) . 
  it has to be there , but you do n't use it . 
  all jackets are designed with that in mind an will usually get weird kinks if you close the bottom one . 
  sorry , i 'm german , and the way i posted it is established fashion in europe and therefore law . 
  doing up the bottom button is very much a faux-pas here . 
  6-lane one way roads are important . 
  they have about the same traffic capacity as a high way . 
  a really good way to transition from a highway into a heavy traffic area is to change over to a 6-lane one-way road that gets distributed to a few points in the area . 
  then you can go to smaller one-way roads or even two way roads . 
  same for exit , collect the traffic onto 6-lane one-way roads and then transition into a highway . 
  an example is [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/aayklyx.jpg ) high density living area i built yesterday . 
  or [ this ] ( http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/543021014061082372/4d874dfa1e73c4ef9873124a08461ae11234d231/ ) heavy traffic industrial zone ( needed to upgrade the intersection to the highway on this one , though ) . 
  you can get a lot more info in efficient high-capacity connections between highways and districs in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/citiesskylines/comments/2ys06h/traffic_management_simulation_gaming_the_game/ ) amazing post by / u/mitchells00 . 
  see [ the wiki article on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pumped-storage_hydroelectricity ) . 
  it uses the dam like a massive battery which is charged when the demand is low . 
  i love stack exchanges , [ can you tell ? ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6mniju7.jpg ) . 
  both of them are originally from the workshop , but i adapted them quite a lot . 
  i can tell you which they are once i get home . 
  edit found it :, 
  the left one is [ this one ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405963607&amp;searchtext= ) which is probably my favorite . 
  you can extend the 2 lane roads into small local collectors ( not fully usable , as people using them are restricted to certain directions , might change that at some point ) . 
  the other one is [ this one ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405861061&amp;searchtext=stack ) but i do n't like that one as much . 
  the shared off-ramps for both directions can bottleneck . 
  the 6 lane roads are a way to slow down highway traffic to a speed where it can disperse into a district . 
  cars move slower , but have more space to do so , so it balances out . 
  yes , i have updated the merging lanes to full highways for more capacity , someone made an asset for a very similar exit , see [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=407565692 ) . 
  sorry , but that picture has been confirmed fake . 
  i feel like the minimum height for pedenstrian paths is excessively high to begin with . 
  could easily be reduced to 75 % or even 50 % . 
  the one you linked is used in the left background . 
  the one in the foreground is actually a very similar one , but not that one . 
  the one i used in the foreground is no longer on the workshop , probably because it had the exact same name as the one you linked . 
  oh , she 's a orange drafter , probably a superchromat , too . 
  she probably just has naturally blue eyes , which is a sign of being a superchromant . 
  does n't have to actually be a blue drafter . 
  also , just as a precaution : no spoilers plx , i 'm only in book 2 , about half way . 
  germany here . 
  we did the same thing , previous student drove to my house , i got in the driver seat and drove the other student to his home . 
  does n't matter , sexy as fuck . 
  funfact : zf stands for `` zahnradfabrik '' , which means gear factory . 
  nice . 
  pre lci looks so much nicer than lci imho . 
  you should maybe restore your headlights , it gives the whole car a very fresh and new look . 
  agreed , if it is that low it would need camber in the rear , because that wheel is tucked in too far . 
  i did . 
  he was just making a pun . 
  same here in germany . 
  he would get a hefty fine and would have to pay for you to get your clothes cleaned . 
  that is a really old quote , originated in the 80s in some usenet group . 
  the wheels need to be wider , like lamborghini wide . 
  maybe rocket bunny or liberty walk will take care of that at some point . 
  fuchs is german for fox . 
  it 's a fairly common last name . 
  m\u00f6hr is probably a last name as well . 
  that 's a honda , nothing expensive there . 
  it 's amazing , you just need to be sure that the meat is fresh . 
  if your beef is high enough quality you 're fine . 
  all really good burger shops here serve their burgers medium or medium rare . 
  every good gastro pub style burger place does . 
  going over that with a pressure washer must be satisfying af . 
  what 's going on near the left edge there ? 
  looks likes ome weird shopping side effects . 
  it 's voil\u00e0 , not viola . 
  a viola is an instrument . 
  you can keep your sarcasm , i personally appreciate being corrected as english is n't my first language . 
  she hit da floor ( she hit da floor ), 
  volkswagen is already singular and plural . 
  the x52 also has screw mounting holes . 
  you can see them in the picutre , top left an bottom right . 
  i have a glass table , the suction cups of my x52 pro stay put . 
  same here . 
  mine is frosted glass , but the frosted , rough surface is on the bottom , the top is perfectly smooth glass . 
  the suction cups work really well there . 
  i love them really runny . 
  i like them prepared such that a skilled veterinarian could still rescue them . 
  i wore exclusively vans sneakers up until a few years ago when i switched to fred perry . 
  i did listen to quite a bit of sum 41 . 
  i love they way they did it on my old merc : https://i.imgur.com/37xmzpp.jpg, 
  the metal spring on the right is made in a way that it doubles as a cap holder when the flap is open . 
  you can see it in action [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xpc7sbw.jpg ) . 
  slightly different model , but same principle . 
  i bet you drive a pathetic kia and that 's your coping mechanism .
