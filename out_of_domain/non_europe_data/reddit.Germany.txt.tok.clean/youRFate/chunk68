  they do actually work . 
  fun fact : it 's one of the so called [ meteora monstaeries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meteora ) , a monsatery complex after which the linkin park album is named . 
  also , the one you linked is actually the varlaam monsatery , not the holy trinity monastery . 
  while not tiny , it 's still a small car . 
  wrong subreddit . 
  you can determine that using the very nice website http://www.willtheyfit.com/ . 
  be careful though , enkei wheels are big in the jdm scene , so they most likely have the wrong bolt pattern , as bmw uses 5x120 , which is pretty uncommon . 
  did you noticably lose power ? 
  2 miles ? 
  why do n't you just walk ? 
  or use a bike ? 
  i like how it says '' [ ... ] educate in the proper parking etiquette '' but then shows a picture of how not to do it , whithout stating what is wrong . 
  whatever it is , you better ride in there or i 'll honk until you do it . 
  if you buy easter bunnys , only buy lindt gold bunnys , they are the best . 
  actually , here in germany you have to use the bike lane if one is available . 
  also the stress of being honked at and the general disdain for bmw drivers like me will probably get them more aggravated than i am in that situation . 
  maybe it 's like a mass driver and accelerates the round using electromagnetism . 
  it is cracked . 
  do n't let them talk you into hating those . 
  i personally love them and i 'm disappointed everyone someone blacks them out . 
  do you even know what hellaflush means ? 
  in case there is any confusion on your side , [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ufowun8.jpg ) is what i 'd consider hellaflush . 
   could n't find mfcti116.json under addons/custom, 
  also , under multiplayer there is a server list , but when i try to join it says joining servers not implemented . 
  submerse the tube fully , block one end with finger and pull that end out and put it in the second container . 
  there you go . 
  wo n't work in that case . 
  same here ... 
  e91 master race . 
  except that female chicken are n't really good as food . 
  you can use them to make stock , though . 
  the design template was syoss , was n't it ? 
  installing ram is still not hardware hacking . 
  \\  complaining about 500 mb . 
  have a look at [ this mod ] ( http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=26449 ) which adds targets in the hud . 
  kind of a shitty blog post . 
  no pictures of the inside , and only 5 lines of text . 
  there is more text in the ads than in the body of the post . 
  apart from that , right next to the church is the `` asam passage '' , a small passage lined with shops and several nice caf\u00e9s and restaurants . 
  if you visit the church you should definitely stroll through that passage . 
  that 's not stance , i can see into the wheel wells . 
  report over to / r/stance if you want to find out what real stance is . 
  i agree that a fair share of rice gets posted there , but usually there are enough good examples without sorting for top . 
  ebay body kits are a menace , but rocket bunny or liberty walk make awesome stuff . 
  also , that car is n't bad , i just would n't call a stock suspension `` stance '' . 
  every gas pump i 've ever been to here in europe had that . 
  but if you look at the picture , it looks like the car is indeed not being filled . 
  what better conditions can you even hope for ? 
  go for it and enjoy . 
  i 'd say 15 years is plenty . 
  wtf is that faggotry ? 
  that robot ( the platform , not the laser weapon ) was developped by jamie mantzel , who 's a really cool guy . 
  see his youtube [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/jmemantzel/videos ) . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  png is newer than jpeg . 
  also , it is widely used , it just serves a different purpose . 
  png only does lossless compression , that means it does not lower the image quality , whereas jpeg does lossy compression , thereby achieving smaller file sizes at the expense of quality . 
  if you 're a bit flexible on the prices i can recommend [ robimack ] ( http://robimack.de/ ) robert is canadian , and afaik all of his team speak english as well . 
  there probably was something insanely interesting off to the left side . 
  imagine the winde suddenly picking up ... 
  someone did n't pay off the building inspectors . 
  uhm , the rest that is in there should be in there ? 
  it 's part of the socket . 
  let me just ... slide over . 
  which part is it ? 
  looks pretty normal to me apart from the tip thing that you have aparently already removed . 
  i have one of those at home . 
  in the bottom picture they put in the floppy the wrong way arround . 
  ah then it was a misunderstanding . 
  i thought by, 
   i already took out that small tip, 
  you meant you took that thing out already . 
  always loved that track . 
  got me into the invisible eps . 
  there are a lot of them here in europe , but we still judge them harshly and think they are very uncool . 
  existing while wearing a fanny pack . 
  it 's true for germany , we call them mongos . 
  why is the xenon hid projector red ? 
  that is tacky as shit . 
  i love the omission of the wheels making them look hellaflush . 
  do n't try to make this personal , i merely insulted your choice in headlights . 
  also , i do enjoy my diesel very much , thank you . 
  i mean , i was n't very nice , but that 's just because i personally really do n't like them . 
  but i remembered i have seen something similar and enjoyed it , [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/efhjcbe.jpg ) . 
  but i think it just blends in nicer with the whole over-the-top racecar theme there . 
  you can set it up to be interruptable by ctrl + c. 
  you ca n't really pump water through a jet engine ( execpt for [ wet takeoffs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_injection_%28engine%29#use_in_aircraft ) , but that 's not really much water ) . 
  they inject water into the exhaust stream . 
  you can see the tank [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/apke5i0.jpg ) . 
  the tank worked exceptionally well . 
  there is a documentary called fires of kuwait , i think you can watch it on youtube . 
  you are on the wrong tracker my friend . 
  any self respecting private music tracker will ban you for transcodes . 
  you have never been to germany . 
  beyerdynamic is where it 's at . 
  i 've read they make headphones with vibration motors in them to simulate bass . 
  the audio engineer that had to implement that decision probably hanged himself . 
  how did it open the door ?
