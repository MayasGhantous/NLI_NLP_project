  why ? 
  saved , since i 'm on the phone, 
  i would recommend this beast of a router : http://www.buffalo-technology.com/en/airstation-nfiniti-highpower-giga-wireless-n-router-access-point.html, 
  you received them with a htc product , only natural that htc has to handle the warranty . 
  does the uk ce and the german ce use the same region ? 
  does the uk have the same region as germany ? 
   @khaarne box is eu only . 
   8:29 pm - 10 apr, 
  i hope you can revisit that one sometime in gw2 ... 
  problem ist , here in germany every retailer only had physical boxes , except if you order directly from arenanet . 
  they do n't have ces, 
  i also bought from zavvi , since 4u2play totally failed . 
  oh right , forgot about gamesload . 
  i can do this , too . 
  it 's awesome when i go snowboarding the altitude is rapidly changing . 
  since when is 7 a valid substitution vor v ? 
  7 is t. 
  that ulti sounds so god damn powerfull ... boom !, 
  lifestealer used to have only passive skills and 1 active ultimate . 
  also , mantasytle used to have manaburn and was awesome with phatom lancer ... 
  problem is , it 's currently offline in germany , for 14 hours now !, 
  same here ... 
  i learned never , i repeat never buy teabags . 
  you can get full cut tea even cheaper and it is so much better . 
  my tea dealer jokingly told me that the stuff in the tea bags is what they scoop of the floor after making real tea . 
  how long you leave the tea in depends heavily on the sort of tea , genuine green tea for example is only steeped about 30 seconds at pretty low temperature of roughly 70 \u00b0 c. 
  i think it is just plain wrong that we have to resort to that kind of thing . 
  i and my friends payed for a game that was advertised with multiplayer , but the multiplayer just does not work . 
  i personally will never again pay for any civilization game if they just keep ignoring this issue . 
  if you look at game series as old as starcraft or age of empires , they have perfectly working netcode , and they are real time ... a turn based system like civ should be way easier to implement in multiplayer . 
  arenanet has stated that the files are hosted on amazon 's ec2 service , which provides a fuckton of bandwidth . 
  yep , downloader says 650kb/s , network monitor says 3,5 mb/s, 
  the old launcher is downloading a new client , not updating the old one . 
  did anyone try to stop resume the download ? 
  the bar starts anew , but the . dat file continues to increase in size . 
  i hope it does it right though . 
  i 'll upload my checksum as soon as it finished downloading . 
  is it just me , or are the forums completely empty ? 
  maybe that single person is the only one stealing the others stuff ? 
  you should check for webgl hardware acceleration in your chrome , you need this . 
  nope , found he difference . 
  how do i activate this `` synchronous mode '' ? 
  3 friends and i are probably gon na join . 
  definitly need a high quality recording ... 
  you have to bind screenshot hd to a button in the menu . 
  my necromancer has a one handed [ axe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fvkyn.jpg ) that [ folds itself ] ( http://i.imgur.com/reyvv.jpg ) when unused . 
  also it has moving gear parts . 
  warning , bigpicture mode edit : imgur scaled them down , full resolution here :, 
  nice , what class is this ? 
  the first time i saw the great imperial smelter my mind was utterly blown ... the black citadel ist just epic . 
  i would imagine that they will at some point let us thest some higher level areas , since they require testing aswell . 
  maybe next beta we 'll start at lvl 30 . 
  probably not . 
  the game has a hd screenshot feature , which takes screenshots at ~ 4x your resolution . 
  you can bind it to a key in the key binding settings . 
  nice , but you should have waited for daytime i think . 
  also , does the game support this or did you stitch them together manually ? 
  one word : wikileaks, 
  nope , no rule changes . 
  source : i 'm german . 
  ** phone : **, 
  htc sensation xe ( europe ), 
  ** rom : **, 
  stock unbranded android 4.0.3 ( htc sense 3.6 ), 
  ** suggestions/issues ( might add more as i test it ) **, 
  * no icons for skills and traits, 
  * dropdown menu text is in caps, 
  * thief misspelled, 
  * in the starting view you can click the `` browse '' tab although there are no other tabs . 
  * build generator would be nice . 
  * some apostrophes show up twice . 
  [ screenshots ] ( http://minus.com/mbqipbsji7 ), 
  if you have any requests for special screenshots / tests on my phone just tell me . 
  looks promising so far . 
  edit : thief now spelled correctly in this post ... seems to be a complicated word :p, 
  nice work !, 
  tipp : if you want to upload full resolution pics use minus.com , they allow up to 2gb per image . 
  uhm , i think you uploaded the wrong version ... the one on minus is lower resolution than the one on imgur . 
  maybe you only linked the wrong version of the minus map . 
  nope , not for me . 
  the link is : http://i.minus.com/j5ehltmjskayv.jpg and it 's only 900x900 , even the imgur one is bigger . 
  would you share the folder link so i can check ? 
  yea that 's it !, 
   sweet map, 
  problem probably was that it was your image , so you got redirected to your folder view of it , but other users only get the 900x900 from the old link . 
  it 's actually good for big images , since it allows images up to 2gb , also the interface is quite nice . 
  eclipse is an ide , not only an editor , and eclipse is awesome . 
  50/2 ,5 mbps , 29 $ , no limits :d , slow upload sucks though ... 
  it does count , it 's fire if i remember correctly . 
  yes , if all you want to do is find out where north etc. 
  if you want to locate yourself on a map you should also lern how to align it with landmarks and then calc your position . 
  this feature has already been announced for the official gw2 mobile app . 
  [ screenshots ] ( http://minus.com/mf23xy6zc ) , hosted on minus for maximum resolution . 
  ... and imgur scaled 'em down :d, 
  looks like a pink garbage bag . 
  50ct also work in all of the 1 $ carts . 
  but as a german i am so used to returning the cart anyway that i probably would even do it if there would be no money slot . 
  well , let 's build our cathedral right here in the air ... 
  from my experience the chips are far more robust than the fin array in the socket ... 
  they do n't need to be refrigerated , a not too hot place like a cellar or pantry should suffice .
