  it is very much preset on pc . 
  when driving high-end cars that can spawn you will see a lot of those . 
  try driving an ubermacht oracle , or an infernus or an comet around the streets . 
  you will see a lot of them . 
  get the karin rusty rebel . 
  cheapest car in game ( $ 3k online ) and has a lot of customization .

  spiders have 8 legs , flies are insects and have 6 .

  ~ ~ we have civil partnerships which grants equal rights , marriage is a church thing that does not have any legal implications , if the church does not want it , then it 's their problem . ~ ~, 
  edit : apparently i was wrong . 
  i was under the impression that civil partnership and * standesamtliche ehe * was the same . 
  apparently it 's not , and i 'm surprised that we do n't have * standesamtliche ehe * for gay coulpes . 
  i was under the impression that civil partnerships were standesamtliche ehe .

  wagons are the best . 
  love how the coloring in the headlights and the side markers matches the wheels . 
  listen to [ this ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-gruen-effect/ ) podcast to learn more about malls , their invention and their decline . 
  just get a carrera 4s , also has awd and it 's a true porsche . 
  it looks to me like the car is dirty and the guy has just brushed away the dirt with his hand so the sticker would stick . 
  there is no excuse to ever key somebodys car . 
  doing so should be punishable by death . 
  are you austrian ? 
  i 've only ever head the sentence `` beim salzamt beschweren '' from austrian people . 
  i currently live in bavaria and have never heard it used here . 
  step 1 : take off the protective foil from that display . 
  also , that dev will probably make him pay a hefty bonus for the source code , if hes smart . 
  you do not need to use it and you can click `` do n't show again '' . 
  it 's a feature steam does an many non-valve games , since with some of them you have to enter the cd key separately in the actual game itself . 
  oh , the autistdox . 
  all i use it for anways is clicking on an image -  share -  imgur to upload it directly from my phone . 
  edit : apparently you ca n't do that anymore with the new app . 
  any alternatives ? 
  edit2 : [ opengur ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kennyc.open.imgur&amp;hl=en ) does have the feature . 
  what the hell , you are right . 
  they seem to have removed that . 
  as posted below , that does not work anymore . 
  yes , i just uninstalled the app and switched to [ opengur ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kennyc.open.imgur&amp;hl=en ) . 
  yes , but not from outside the app . 
  the big thing before was just selecting the photos in your gallery and then using the share function to upload them . 
  fitment on point . 
  it even has a german style plate , but with a text on it that is in that form not possible in germany . 
  beer can actually be bought at 14 in germany , if you are with your parents and they consent . 
  beer and wine can actually be bought at 14 in germany , if you are with your parents and they consent . 
  otherweise it 's 16 for beer and wine , 18 for everything else . 
  got the same engine ( n47d20 ) in my e91 . 
  what i 've heard the 177hp generation is less prone to the timing chain issues , however , be wary of your particle filter . 
  the car does not have adblue and therefore has problems burning it clean especially if you drive short distances a lot . 
  that being said , i like the engine . 
  fun to drive and does n't use a lot of fuel . 
  probably even more so in your 1 series . 
  that 's a nice parking lot . 
  yea , it 's called the `` white employers network '' , or linkedin . 
  it somehow really bothers me that there are markings on the bottom of the speedometer and the rpm meter although the needle can never get there . 
  also , that big ass clock in the instrument cluster ? 
  wtf , did they not find anything useful to put there ? 
  they now do that . 
  my merc had a digital one , my parents ' merc also does n't have an analog one . 
  well , it was n't really leds blinking in your face , it was an lcd display . 
  the current model 911 turbo does that . 
  ~ ~ my guess is [ vmr v710 ] ( http://www.velocitymotoring.com/wheels/v710/ ) . ~ ~, 
  scratch that , they are [ bola msh ] ( http://bolawheels.co.uk/bola-msh/ ) . 
  incredibly simmilar , though . 
  i just ordered a set of vmr v710 for my e91 . 
  my only worry is that my standard brakes might look a bit puny behind those 19 '' wheels . 
  yea , and drill the rotors my self . 
  that 's not going to make the rotors bigger , though ^ ^ . 
  i 'm pretty sure in says vossen inside the wheels , you can see the sen. 
  sick . 
  how much did you have to modify the front to get those 265 wheels in there ?
