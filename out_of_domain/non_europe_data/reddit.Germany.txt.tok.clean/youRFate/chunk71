  i so wanted that bmw m3 with the bikes on the roof rack to have `` stiftung warentest '' livery . 
  that would have been the best ad ever . 
  they literally are some of the best , even some gold medal holders . 
  the problem in the animation is that the thread passes all the way around the bobbin , therefore the bobbin could not be attached anywhere in the animation . 
  all mercs have the wiper control integrated in the turn signal stick , which is also the stick for the highbeams . 
  bascially , merc only has one stick on the left , except if you have cruise control , that 's on a separate stick . 
  german : bmw has them on the right , merc has them integrated into their single stick which is on the left side . 
  have n't driven wv or audi in a while , but i think they have the wiper stick on the right . 
  was on all cars i 've used so far . 
  just blacklist 0sec and immerse in sonarr . 
  problem solved . 
  yea , he was kinda unsatisfying . 
  i want him to have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4y7ztznkc ) level of bad-assery . 
  i was so sad that that staple of trash fights was missing . 
  i have the same board , can really recommend it . 
  we got it even cheaper than that , when our university ordered in bulk . 
  however , i can also crecommend the de1-soc . 
  got mine for free after attending a free afternoon altera seminar at a conference that was being held at university . 
  anyone who knows bmw will see its a 335 from the exhaust setup . 
  do i hear s65 i8 ? 
  that would be an awesome build . 
  it even has limited slip diff and recaro seats . 
  it 's like they wanted it to be tracked . 
  it 's also used in [ foreign beggars & alix perez - deng feat . 
  riko dan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zd9pkvhksc ) . 
  love that track . 
  edit : updated link , had the clean version linked - . -, 
  prodigy also used it i think . 
  original video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ntjf7d036w, 
  imagine how cool it would be if that watch was the key . 
  like you have to pop it in there to start the car . 
  that is the star constellation [ leo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leo_%28constellation%29 ) . 
  the leds in the headlights are arraged in that way . 
  ca n't space them too much , german t\u00dcv is really anal about that . 
  can really recommend them . 
  i love that license plate . 
  non games just see a normal license plate , ppl . 
  who know what it means always love it . 
  it 's the stadard body kit . 
  the car has the sports suspension and is lowered on h & r springs . 
  pre lci has the advantage of lager wheel wells . 
  getting this size to fit on an lci would be troublesome . 
  also , on a it switches to internal circulation when sensors detect unhealthy air outside , e.g. 
  when sitting in a tunnel . 
  i could probably space the rear out a little further , but i 'll see about that . 
  her actual name was nicole , but they rename her when they found out she had tourettes . 
  those things probably scratch up the paint really bad . 
  just imagine all the sharp magnetic dust attached to those magnets ... 
  i can wholeheartedly recommend [ robimack ] ( http://robimack.de/ ) . 
  robert is canadian , so language should not be a problem . 
  can we talk about them just stealing the debian logo and flipping it ? 
  i think there is still something missing . 
  i 'd probably love to have that as a print on a wall . 
  are you planing on painting the front bumper ? 
  learn to use units for fucks sake . 
  idk , ppl can figure out how mililiters relate to liters , why not mah and am . 
  stuff like that just really bug me , isps do it to with stuff like `` 16,000 kb/s '' . 
  noticed that with bmw , some people here get the us sidemarkers coded in . 
  that bothers me as well , i think i actually posted about it a while ago . 
  also , for liters we use hektoliter , but not like kiloliter , or megaliter . 
  is project cars woth it if i do n't own a wheel , only an xbox360 controller ? 
  there is always / v/dota2 . 
  wrong game ^ ^ . 
  yes , gta car meets are real and fun , see / r/gtav _ cruises . 
  he probably just found the [ list of oldest companies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_companies ) on wikipedia . 
  ismaning itself is a quite beautiful village , and the restaurant/beergarden `` zur m\u00fchle '' is nice . 
  other than that you 'll probably just commute into munich by s-bahn . 
  see / r/bodyweightfitness for exercises you can do without equipement . 
  close , translation :, 
   you will see , even if you have difficulties understanding us we will be delighted to repeat ourselves to help you !, 
  we appreciate the effort it takes to learn a language . 
  have fun in montr\u00e9al !, 
  source : german that learned both english and french in school . 
  my french is a bit rusty , but i 'm using duolingo to brush it up . 
  if you had told me in 5th grade that at some point i 'll be using an english website to learn french i 'd have called you mad . 
  dogs are usually well trained here , i.e. 
  sitting down on the floor when using public transport , no barking . 
  if they arent people will judge you hard . 
  that is actually the first verse of our national anthem . 
  however it is not used . 
  we only sing the 3rd verse . 
  did [ something simmilar ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sy6rp3e.png ) with a lightly different version of the logo about a year ago , see [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kspflags/comments/1iovuc/kingdom_of_w%c3%bcrttemberg_colors_and_the_old_lego/ ) for the other template . 
  if you want to play a game with graphics of about that level that features the 1m , get project cars . 
  that is a nice rack of wood you got there . 
  split it yourself ? 
  yes . 
  the new patch that has been announced will fix a problem with wrong default tire compound on the f1 , maybe that is the issue . 
  i like how power mirrors are exciting to you . 
  seems more like you accidentally took the right turn . 
  i usually sprinkle them with a little olive oil and then put them straight in . 
  very nice , but nothing will ever come close to the mother of all porsche body kits : http://i.imgur.com/w136lpi.jpg, 
  whatever you do , do n't fuck with somebodies car . 
  yes , the 335d wagon . 
  i see many do euro delivery anyways , so you can also get teh 335d , right ? 
  nice , got them on my [ wagon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/29nzdnt.jpg ) but i got the wheels and car colors the other way around :  . 
  lci is actually 2008 . 
  sorry , production of the lci started september 2008 in europe . 
  released 2009 in the us . 
  i personally just do n't even bother with it . 
  there is a cleaner in the appartment building i live in , $ 1.50 per shirt , washed , ironed and stiffened .
