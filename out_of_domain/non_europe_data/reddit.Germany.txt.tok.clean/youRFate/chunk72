  i throw that on the usb stick in my center console and let the oem dual subwoofer 3 way audio system in my car take care of the rest :  . 
  the wave was not intended , surfing there was not allowed until recently , since it is dangerous because of undercurrents and underwater boulders behind the wave . 
  in 2010 the city of munich acquired the area from the state and officially legalized surfing there . 
  they also added some stuff on the left bank so the wave is there year round , even if there is not much water . 
  surfing there is still incredibly dangerous and there are signs stating something like experts only . 
  for more info see the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eisbach_%28isar%29 ) . 
  that is the standart colour for them in europe . 
  after all its the way you ** should ** be going during a fire . 
  it also contrasts nicely with the red fiery stuff . 
  i makes great noise , is quite fast and actually nice to drive . 
  do n't forget to increase the turbo boost in your garage beforehand , makes the car even slightly more mad . 
  they should just add an airport runway or something like that . 
  i think it should only change the maximum psi . 
  the title font is the real problem here . 
  it mixes upper and lower case letters . 
  well played . 
  let 's buy them and open an arma themed paintball resort . 
  alcool is french for alcohol . 
  someone did something similar , but with ~ ~ natrium ~ ~ sodium , and he flushed it . 
  it apparently took out a wall in the basement where the pipes run . 
  i 've commented on the other one , it also happened at my school , with sodium . 
  apparently took out a wall in the basement where the waste water pipes run . 
  that bathroom was closed for a pretty long time . 
  i live in giesing as well , i have been waiting for a rather important letter my parents sent me for over 2 weeks now .

  and the [ daily mail article ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3143368/the-terrifying-hotel-world-welcome-skylodge-three-transparent-pods-clinging-400ft-cliff-peru-scale-sheer-rock-face-reach-them.html ) this is lifted from . 
  also op [ posted the gif ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/3bwh14/peruvian_mountain_side_hotel/ ) to / r/gifs at the same time , get your pitchforks . 
  it 's that an aftermarket roundel or is you color balance way off ? 
  but the people who post oc to reddit do . 
  liechtenstein is spelled incorrectly , i 'll turn my pitchfork against you !, 
  forgot to add , dough was store bought : / . 
  i like square pizza since i can use the space in my oven better . 
  also some shallots on the right half . 
  i added the basil leaves after baking it , since they would just burn otherwise . 
  i find pressing them into the hot cheese right after baking makes them tender enough . 
  i think i 've got the cheese mix down for now , next step is getting my own dough going . 
  what i always find is that mushrooms lose a lot more volume that i assume , to give you an idea [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kablvge.jpg ) ( not the same pizza as in the op ) is the ammount of mushrooms i add which works out to about [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/03ricvf.jpg ) after baking . 
  looks like they add another layer of sauce on top of the cheese , like deep dish but not as thick . 
  definitely has a distinct borderlands vibe . 
  they could probably skim quite a few dead fish off the surface after that . 
  the screws need another set on top , rotating in the other direction , both driven by hydraulic motors .

  what is this , north korea tube ? 
  well , icewave has the blade all around , tombstone only on the front . 
  if icewave hits tombstone in the back / wheels it 's gg . 
  see what happened to the team whybach minibot when nightmare hit it . 
  i think that explosion was it 's gas tank popping . 
  on of the old housebots had an angle grinder mounted to it . 
  they had problems with it for a few seasons , but then it kinda worked . 
  it also had some jaws to hold the other bot in place . 
  i really enjoy the destruction they cause . 
  i hate fights where nothing major breakes . 
  i thought there was a neato robot in the box , so the other guy had to destroy one of the bots he built :  . 
  i enjoy spinner bots because they cause a lot of destruction . 
  i hate fights where nothing breaks . 
  ideally a fight would end with one robot entirely shredded to pieces . 
  mvp . 
  mount [ this ] ( http://www.stihlusa.com/products/cut-off-machines/professional-cut-off-machines/ts800/ ) horizontrally to the front , add some kind of grabber so the bot is not just pushed aside . 
  there is a video of something similar where they drop dead cows in it that had mad cow disease . 
  i like that the broccoli disappeared while baking it . 
  ca n't get that for that old car though . 
  i 'm not serious ofc . 
  looks good , could probably have stayed in the oven a bit longer though , looks a bit soggy . 
  what i meant is back when that car was sold there was no m package for it , it was called performance back then . 
  so that badge is not installed from the factory . 
  ok , never seen that here in europe . 
  are you sure those people are not just calling it that ? 
  right , if they fight weapon against weapon i also think tombstone would get the better end of it . 
  last time i read about them vossen wheels were regarded as bad quality , is that still the case ?

  nope , see forum posts like [ here ] ( http://www.myg37.com/forums/vendor-comments-reviews-feedback/231235-vossen-experience.html ) or [ here ] ( http://5series.net/forums/e60-parts-accessories-mods-22/seeing-lot-negative-comments-about-vossen-how-you-e60-owners-liking-them-135247/ ) . 
  apparently they are not forged , which is kind of a let down at that price point . 
  i 'd go with hre , adv , rotiform or forgestar over vossen any day . 
  where in europe ? 
  we use roof tiles usually .
