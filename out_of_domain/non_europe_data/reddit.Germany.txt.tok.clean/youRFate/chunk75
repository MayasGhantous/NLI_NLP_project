  yes , maybe manually ground the scope to the same ground your pc is grounded to . 
  i got the same trim , really like it . 
  what 's up with your shifter know , that 's not standard , right ? 
  now get the sports steering wheel with the matching trim  . 
  [ mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/keow6xb.jpg ) , not the best pic , but you get the idea . 
  tires are 235 35 19 dunlop sport maxx . 
  might add some spacers to the rear next season . 
  pic 2 is sick . 
  a whole bunch of software was installed on a nas and the machines loaded that from there . 
  also all of the students home directories were on there . 
  during project week a buddy of mine figured out that the permissions were weird and we could change them for all accounts , including admin . 
  so he removed all read and write permissions from everyone and clicked apply to all , and made it apply to all subfolders . 
  it took a while , but eventually ppl started to complain that software crashed and that their data was gone . 
  also all of the client machines in the whole school would not boot anymore . 
  that e90 is on point , though . 
  oh it so is . 
  air filters . 
  you can see they fit in the side dome on the hood that is vented on the front . 
  aka `` look at how many scythes i have '', 
  that is the [ kleine eisbachwelle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eisbach_%28isar%29 ) . 
  there is a [ bigger wave ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/eisbach_surfen_1.jpg ) further up the stream . 
  people surf there all the time , all year round . 
  it is illegal to surf there , however that is not enforced , the city even modified it to make it somewhat safer . 
  that guy really remins me of bubbles from trailer park boys . 
  there is also the antergos crowd . 
  use latex . 
  i used [ tex live ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tex_live ) with [ texlive-localmanager ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tex_live#texlive_local_manager ) as a latex distribution . 
  my editor of choice is emacs , and i used emacs with the [ auctex ] ( https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/ ) mode to write several papers and other large documents , including my bachelor 's thesis . 
  on a related note , using latex has the added benefit that the document sources can be nicely version controlled , for example with git . 
  putting your paper in a private git repository is a nice way to secure against data loss , and having versions is a nice way to find out what went wrong when your project suddenly stops compiling . 
  texlive-localmanager is missing ... 
  i find amazon.de has the best prices , usually substantially cheaper than retail . 
  they are a official birkenstock seller . 
  it 's kina weird , op has posted normally , non brand-affiliated stuff up until now , and now spams hydrox content . 
  did the account get sold , or how does that happen ? 
  macbeth ? 
  yes , speeding is n't really expensive here . 
  they focus on dangerous stuff instead like not enough distance from the car in front of you . 
  that can easily cost you your license . 
  get a pair of [ shure se-215 ] ( http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones/se-earphones/se215-sound-isolating-earphones ) or higher . 
  they have over-ear cable design and expanding foam earpieces that wo n't fall out . 
  ah , i see you are building evidence for you neighbors lawsuit over your dog barking too much . 
  my white nexus 5 is still a head turner , people constantly ask what kind of phone that is . 
  worst yahoo promotion account ever . 
  so blatantly a sales bot . 
  seems like it automatically posts news to raise karma when it is n't advertising stuff . 
  do n't even bother . 
  i live here and i do n't either . 
  i 'm not a native bavarian so i wo n't dress like one . 
  shirt + jeans or whatever floats your boat is fine . 
  got the same mousepad , it 's very good . 
  seelseries 9hd . 
  why would you have a freezer at the office anyway . 
  i like the `` at this time this fridge will be completely emptied '' policy . 
  it 's actually one of the only times i like some kind of zero tollerance policy . 
  i need that in my life . 
  anyone got a clue how much power that thing outputs ? 
  that thing looks like enraged ragnaros . 
  edit : did some googling and professional wok burners like that are in the 200,000 - 300,000 btu/h range , so about 60 - 80 kw per burner . 
  anyone know which addon he 's using so he does n't have to click through the mission reports ? 
  how dangerous would that be , like driving there in the evening , white german kid in a bmw ? 
  i have to agree with / u/panzerpatallion . 
  just because the albums are also released on casettes is not a reason to use that format anymore . 
  sound quality is just so much better with a proper format . 
  wash them on max heat ( 95c ) , and let them air dry until hard . 
  best towels ever . 
  they are a bit scratchy , but they are the most absorbent thing known to man . 
  hint , normal people can do all these things . 
  nah , the moto 360 really is n't big . 
  most chronographs , like breitling etc , are bigger . 
  die funktion hei\u00dft [ 6in4 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/6in4 ) . 
  git : ` rekt ' is not a git command . 
  did you mean this ? 
  you stomped it and it did n't die ? 
  you stomped it wrong . 
  that does not include the 5 series i assume . 
  5.11 gear rocks in general . 
  love my rush 24 backpack . 
  it 's an american thing only . 
  yes , that 's the biggest gripe i have with my wireless charger . 
  do you use sleep as android ? 
  do n't link polygon , they 're a shit show now . 
  citing their article about rock band 4 :, 
   a few of my more effervescent , more gregarious , more alive colleagues in game journalism are on stage `` rocking out '' to the killers . 
  we are on the rooftop of a pricey hotel in santa monica , at a press event organized by rock band 4 's developer and publisher harmonix . 
   i 'm standing at a safe distance , drinking fizzy water , eating puff pastry canapes and chatting to another colleague about politics in the philippines . 
  i 'm having an ok time . 
   i 'm supposed to be focusing my attention on rock band 4 , but there 's more chance of ferdinand marcos leaping onto that stage than there is of me mounting the boards , swinging a guitar strap around my neck and yelling `` whooooooo . '', 
  from the same article :, 
   all video games are stupid , of course . 
  that guy ca n't even be arsed to test the game . 
  also , politics in the philippines , are you kidding me ? 
  i obviously wo n't link the article so they do n't get more traffic . 
  some podcast brought that to my attention , do n't remember which one . 
  i use the money i get from the google opinion rewards . 
  blatant promotion account , shitty video not addressing any details . 
  get out of here . 
  anyone played rising force/rf online back when it was still online ? 
  edit : apparently it is still online , thought they shut it down a while ago . 
  such a satisfying sound .
