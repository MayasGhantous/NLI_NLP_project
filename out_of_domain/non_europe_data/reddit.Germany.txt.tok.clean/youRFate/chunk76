  nice rendition . 
  keying a car is a malevolent act of jealousy with no personal benefit . 
  his neighbor should be killed for that . 
  we do n't need those kind of people . 
  nice bmw badge above the plate ... 
  germany here , our attics have boarded wooden floors for storing stuff . 
  we have both attics and basements . 
  the basement contains rooms that are used , for example washer / dryer room , workshop , firewood storage , freezer room , central heating room . 
  in the attic we store stuff that we do n't access often , like old furniture . 
  even the garage has an attic , where stuff like roof racks and or winter tires are stored . 
  could come in handy . 
  it 's not about thanking op , it 's about saying ` kind sir ' , which is too neckbeard to be used seriously . 
  i think they gave them away on reddit , too . 
  still , a lifetime license is a lifetime license . 
  if you do n't plan on honoring that do n't give them away . 
  they fucked up in my book . 
  i 'm just going to assume op does n't know what dnb is , but still , cool video . 
  my main hit 100 about 2 weeks ago , i have got the reps just from doing tanaan dailies . 
  apparently it has been removed , see [ here ] ( http://www.tukui.org/forums/topic.php?id=31897 ) . 
  but it was very shady , elv is definitely playing it down . 
  he even had checkin comments for the code of the backdoor saying `` hahahahaha '' , `` new toy '' , `` too fucking evil '' and `` too evil even for my standards '' . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2jhlzv/psa_elvui_has_a_backdoor_and_how_to_remove_it/clc59yp ), 
  that guy is definitely shady , but i like the ui so i 'll use it for now . 
  i also appreciate that i can just pull it from his git repo , so i can update it automatedly . 
  if only all my addons were available as a repo so i could update all of them with a single ` git submodule update -- recursive ' . 
  $ 70 is normal shirt price , low volume hand made in a first world country ? 
  try $ 300 + . 
  you hearthstone into your garisson before logging out , because you want to assign follower missions and work orders before you leave . 
  kinda remind me of a alfa 159 . 
  idk about the ' 16 ' in the grille , should have gone with a white ` eb ' there imho . 
  to be fair , the hhr is not much better . 
  live rear axle with a watts linkage is what google turned up , so the handling is probably a big no . 
  the square brackets go around the text , the round ones arround the link . 
  that and the scene at the power plant , how nobody has ever questioned the loop of power lines . 
  waking up with pizza is a win situation in my book ... 
  $ 3.33 for all that food ? 
  i did that only once on a smaller scale , i got a coupon for a free small pizza with every medium or lager pizza , so i ordered a large + small . 
  i put the small in the fridge for breakfast the next day . 
  bk does have good fries . 
  what 's a kd ? 
  ah i 've read a lot about that stuff on reddit , but i have n't seen it abbreviated as ` kd ' . 
  i do n't think they sell that here . 
  if you 're interested in how that works , [ aussie50 has a teardown of one ] ( https://youtu.be/ngpv6vpkxfg ) . 
  you just reminded me of this : [ chase & status : time ft. delilah ] ( https://youtu.be/lwp9vvketma ) . 
  edit : wrong sub , that song is dnb . 
  also , short pants and not wearing sneaker socks . 
  i like the blade , do n't like the handle . 
  because he is world renowned for his unconventional architecture , for example the [ guggenheim museum in bilbao ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/guggenheim-bilbao-jan05.jpg ) . 
  you could probably read this drive with a compass and a pice of paper . 
  i know , this comment thread is about the la auditorium . 
  uhm i did n't change my comment . 
  did you maybe mix up comments ? 
  my hourly wage as a student employee is even higher . 
  it also depends on if you already have a degree . 
  i 'm in ee , and i already had a bachelor 's degree , currently studying for my m.sc . 
  the 20 hour / week limit is usually enforced so your main occupation is still legally student , and at least at the company i 'm at it only applies during semester . 
  during semester break you can work pretty much as much as you want . 
  as far as workload goes , the hours are completely flexible , so i can fit it in my schedule however i please . 
  also , during exam time i usually took a week or two off , the money you loose can easily be complensated by working full time during semester break . 
  of serious versions i really enjoy the one by barbara booney : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gap6wfs6_-w, 
  if you ever get stranded on a lonely island you need to team up with that guy . 
  he 's rushing the tech tree hard . 
  when the other people there slowly figure out how to fell a tree that guy is probably working on his 22nm semiconductor fab . 
  there is a swabian ( german ) saying along the lines of `` only the poor and the stupid are cold '' . 
  as a kid you get that thrown at you all the time if you complain about being cold , because we were not poor so it 's our own fault for not wearing more clothes . 
  edit : by popular request : the swabian is `` frieren tut es blos arme und bl\u00f6de . 
  '' , [ spoken ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s1kwqfhdpzpb ) ( sorry for the quality ) . 
  my 2007 bmw has bluetooth , plays mp3 from usb flash drives and has an aux in .

  i 've done that a long time ago with a screenshot of my warlock for a forum signature . 
  there is a software that does it , you just feed it a pack of the wow icons with you can get online . 
  fixed, 
  my limited understanding of meteorology says this is a cold front . 
  if you want to know more about it 's history and how it came to the us , watch [ this begin japanology episode about abalone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8u_g7v0zou ) . 
  the real question is why the printer is configured to be it 's own network instead of a client in his normal wifi . 
  if he configured it correctly he should be able to use the printer from his normal internet wifi . 
  thank god it 's not a bmw , our image is bad enough as-is . 
  are n't waves wide though ? 
  i imagine there 's plenty of room for two . 
  for me the graph plugin for skada caused immense fps drops and micro stutter . 
  invite a friend , grind dungeons for about 2 afternoons , enjoy your new lvl 90 . 
  repeat . 
  tell him to grant levels on a 3rd char . 
  boom 3 new lvl 90 characters . 
  breaking news : rationales denken wiederlegt rassistische hetze . 
  it 's darkmoon faire right now , at least there are some players in tb now . 
  he probably was outdated . 
  warlocks used to stack haste , and felhunter was formerly able to purge debuffs from the player . 
  yes , the portal is right below tb , but sometimes ppl go up there . 
  for example i was doing the tailoring daylie for which you need some coarse thread and some dye . 
  did n't find a vendor on the faire grounds so i went back and up to tb . 
  there were about 10 ppl in the main square . 
  the available missions are the same on all your characters . 
  can be stressfull sometimes , but it is engaging . 
  also i still struggle getting good dps on trash encounters where the mobs do n't live long . 
  love my b/w brother hl 2250 dn . 
  bought it when i started studying for printing scripts etc. 
  has n't let me down since . 
  i think he means pouring glue under it so it ca n't be pressed .
