  super famicom :p, 
  there appears to be a blue bane , probably somewhere in the waters . 
  guildwars 2 has that . 
  i see that all the time . 
  eredar eu ( german pvp ) . 
  12,748 alliance , 210,754 horde . 
  that actually looks very nice . 
  would n't even lying down requrie them to power the muscles that hold the ribcage in shape ? 
  that 's not really german . 
  wtf are you on about ? 
  that does n't even make any sense . 
  for startes , there are no ticket scanners here . 
  also , deutsche mark was abandoned in 2002 . 
  you can buy the shattrath missive : http://www.wowhead.com/item=122412/scouting-missive-shattrath-harbor, 
  i 'd recommend blabla car , as they are international . 
  if you 're setting up an account you can use that for more than just germany . 
  they are heavily photoshopped / filtered . 
  as for the tent i 'd go with augustiner-festhalle , hacker-festzelt or ochsenbraterei . 
  yes , but you only need the one you can buy for http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=9564/securing-draenor . 
  yes , but you only need the one you can buy for http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=9564/securing-draenor . 
  i know it 's missing the question , but i can honestly recommend you try to use it cli-only . 
  that will give you a good understanding of what is really going on . 
  i recommend binge-listening to everything by vision recordings ( noisia etc. ), 
  and hospital records . 
  hijacking this : i also plan on replacing my battery . 
  the original lg part costs about 8 $ so it 's a no-brainer . 
  however , i 'm wondering if there are better options available . 
  are there compatible batteries with bigger capacity ? 
  i 'm fairly confident that i could pull that off no problem , but i was looking for a drop-in replacement as anything requiring modificaion is imho not worth the extra effort . 
  i probably wo n't be using this phone for that much longer anyway and might sell it at some point . 
  some of them are for mail , for example the student dorm i lived in got a crate of mail delivered at night into such a box , then in the morning some person came and sorted the mail into the individual mailboxes . 
  [ rote sonne ] ( http://rote-sonne.com/ ) is an electronic music club near stachus . 
  you forgot the hacker tent : students and party . 
  yes , i 'm going to install the regular battery , but the lg g2 mod is not worth the effort imho . 
  nah , they are quite fancy even here in germany . 
  look up their prices and compare with something like siemens or aeg . 
  they are absolutely worth it though , superior build . 
  the stanced one looks so much smaller . 
  also , the stock one has different wheels on the front and back . 
  now i really want to build a lego machine that does that . 
  that 's just going to make him buy a cactus next . 
  ras syndrome . 
  emacs , you heathen . 
  you can be invited to the game by someone that already has an account . 
  you get a free starter edition account that is limited to lvl 20 , so you can try it out . 
  if at any point you feel like you enjoy it you can then go ahead and buy the battle chest ( all addons up to but not including the latest one + 1 month game time ) for about $ 15 . 
  the player that invites you gets some bonus if you buy game time later on . 
  see [ this page ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/game/recruit-a-friend/ ) for more information . 
  as for the latest addon ( warlords of draenor ) , here it was cheaper to buy a physical copy off amazon ( got it for $ 24 i think ) . 
  that does not include the additional month of game time that you get when you buy it off blizzard , but you can get game time cheaper from 3rd party sellers . 
  bmw e90 320d ( n47 engine ) stock boost pressure is 22.5 psi . 
  mad cringe confirmed . 
  now imagine that done with a real sports car that does 1-100 in under 6 sec and whose production code is n't literally `` fart '' . 
  really love this whole album . 
  the continuous mix on cd2 is perfect for driving imho . 
  my biggest gripe is that the drums are behind the rider . 
  how would he even play them ? 
  horses with drums always have them in front of the rider . 
   2nd grade, 
  i 'm getting old ... 
  no , what gets me is that there are people here that were in 2nd grade when bc came out . 
  i was in 8th grade when classic wow was released . 
  the first characters i played are older than you \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  it 's kinda weird in that video . 
  it sort of slides forward and when he really hits it it 's [ definitely in front of him ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkswlxz.png ) . 
  it would be so cool if the / mountspecial animation for kodos was playing the drums . 
  wrong legion buddy . 
  i put mine in the opened ash tray . 
  my nexus 5 fits perfectly into the e91 ashtray . 
  also , if you extend that thigh rest you have a wine bottle holder . 
  taken from [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/2bjwvl/m3_drivers_might_appreciate_this_technique_for/ ) post . 
  not to throw salt into your wounds , but the sports package seats with the pneumatically adjustable seat width are one of my favorite parts of my car . 
  you made good choices in life . 
  i hope you did n't have too many drams of talisker . 
  `` gewinde '' is german for the thread on a screw . 
  the word you are looking for is `` thema '' , which translates to topic or thread . 
  germany here , manuals are the norm here , auto is the exception . 
  driving lessons and exams are conduction on manual cars . 
  do those servers come with data ? 
  that does look like there is some support involved . 
  i think to build a self supporting arch you need tapered building material so it kinda locks in place . 
  as a german , those plates are very cringy . 
  the german flag on the side is n't used here and has never been used like that . 
  also we do n't just throw random umlauts in words . 
  also we ca n't have just any words on the plate , it 's always city code - some letters and then some numbers . 
  see [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_germany ) for a history of german plates . 
  you can get real plates with custom lettering here and they are a lot cheaper . 
  idk about shipping them to wherever you live though . 
  a set of 2 is about 20-30 $ . 
  i really like the \\ #golfkriese , which applies to both the gulf crisis and the vw diesel scandal :d . 
  well , there is [ this thing ] ( http://www.m-power.com/_open/s/varlink1.jsp?id=2655&amp;lang=en ) . 
  i see a lot of people eating them alone . 
  real winner is whoever sold that paperwork for $ 16 . 
  one of my favorite things about org mode is using orgtbl mode in source code files to quickly insert table explanations into long comments . 
  that 's a fair price for a piece of great design . 
  somone swapped the complete drivetrain , engine and suspension from an m3 into an e91 touring . 
  that one is really nice , but i like ops picture a lot more . 
  go with the nicer headlights ( xenon hid ) , they transform the look of the car a lot and they are a lot better during night time . 
  if you plan on driving a lot i personally prefer the sports seats , they are in my opinion a lot more comfortable . 
  park distance control is probably also something i 'd see as essential , maybe that is stock now , idk .
