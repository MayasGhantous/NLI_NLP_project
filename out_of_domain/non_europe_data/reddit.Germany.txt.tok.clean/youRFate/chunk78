  then it would also be `` bayrische '' and `` motoren '' . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  the bmw subreddit liked you post , it has a positive score and a lot of positive comments . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/3m4yqb/installed_kw_clubsports_new_wheels_on_my_e92_m3/ ) . 
  seriously nice work on that oem + grille . 
  looks like a stock option . 
  also , what wheels are those ? 
  they are mad . 
  they probably just did n't smoke it right . 
  all expenses paid und tisch reserviert . 
  gigi d' agostino , nice throwback , thanks for reminding me of that song . 
  that is actually normal here in germany . 
  if you want it cut you specify that separately . 
  it 's also the norm to eat one pizza per person , that whole slice culture does n't exist here . 
  there are videos of it , it does not lay it automatically , there are usually 2 or 3 people on it laying the stones on some sort of conveyor belt , the machine then transfers it to the ground . 
  shamans ' healing rain is so visually unappealing . 
  it has an extremly low-res ground texture and barely visible rain over it . 
  a glypth that adds a strom cloud over it or something like that would be really nice . 
  it is tbc timewalk , as / u/lcgifford has said . 
  see [ this events calendar ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/events ) for reference . 
  i think it 's not even sold here . 
  they do , but no 4 cylinder . 
  currently only the 4 cylinder diesels are known to be affected . 
  porsche does have diesel versions of the cayenne , panamera and macan . 
  mercedes e class is the standard taxi in southern germany . 
  here in munich it 's hard to find others . 
  they do for their own commercials . 
  not any gear slot . 
  there are not baleful off-hands / shields . 
  there was a video by him linked a few days ago i think . 
  i also watched all his videos since then , probably like op did . 
  wow the narrator is annoying , and the first thing said is not correct . 
  gold is no where near the softest metal . 
  every 3 and 5 series comes in wagon form . 
  my first thought was `` what kind of camera is a canon in d ? 
  oh yes , one of my favourites . 
  that one prompted me to get all invisible eps . 
  me_irl is leaking . 
  do not buy that gear before lvl 100 . 
  it is scaled down and does not scale when you level up . 
  i tried it on my mage and was somewhat disappointed . 
  oh , i did n't read that , i just assumed it would work : / . 
  does n't matter , going to try and get the mage to lvl 100 before the event ends . 
  i 'm the opposite . 
  bumper case from day 1 . 
  have n't dropped the phone once in nearly 2 years . 
  thinking about maybe risking using it naked , since i really like the look and feel . 
  lol leaf springs and drum brakes . 
  i 'd call it a tribute , not a parody ... 
  best drone ever . 
  annoying and unfunny . 
  that name is hilarious . 
  seconding this . 
  they have very large pizza for a good price and the restaurants are beautifully decorated . 
  if you like that sort of animation you need to play guild wars 2 . 
  it has a ton of stunning art in that style . 
  the next time an 18 wheeler passes you you should overthink why you are blocking traffic . 
  there is no reason to drive slower than 18 wheelers do ... 
  i have to admitt , i 'm german , here trucks have a general speed limit of 80 km/h and have to be limited to maximum of 90 km/h . 
  cars are usually allowed 100 km/h on normal roads and are unrestricted on the autobahn . 
  some exceptions apply and there are stretches of the autobahn that are also limited . 
  in general trucks are limited to slower speeds than cars here . 
  as long as it 's a real / / / m , go for it . 
  [ reminds me of this ] ( https://youtu.be/nk2wviksh_m ), 
  i head about that wireless issue . 
  press down pretty hard on the center of the back cover . 
  there is some connector there that does n't snap in if you only snap in the latches on the edges . 
  uhm , i think you are in the wrong sub . 
  also that account looks to be specifically made to advertise this ? 
  here in bavaria we call horseraddish `` kren '' , pretty close to the spelling of that name . 
  the german version of that page has more info . 
  also , just googling `` krehn '' in german google yields a ton of people that go by that name . 
  also , the name `` krenn '' has it 's own [ wiki page ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/krenn ) , stating it also comes from `` kren '' ( horseraddish ) .

  in affliction spec my dps seems to be ok , but i 'm really struggling with destruction .

  what would you propose ? 
  less haste / multistike , more crit ? 
  that would certainly impede my affliction spec , would n't it ? 
  i hope asking the same twice is n't against some rules .
