  amory :, 
  what would you propose ? 
  less haste / multistike , more crit ? 
  that would certainly impede my affliction spec , would n't it ? 
  thanks , that 's what i feared . 
  well , off to the training dummy it is . 
  when i see that blue bmw cca thing at a glance , my first thought is it 's a hartge logo . 
  then i 'm slightly disappointed . 
  thanks !, 
  looks like a great resource , i 'll review that tomorrow . 
  good job . 
  dps is apparently really easy on a paladin tank with 4pc t18 . 
  had a tank in auchindoun heroic yesterday that did 100k dps on the first boss . 
  that is single target . 
  he says he 's not concerned about that , but then again he posted [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/advertiseyouryoutube/comments/3p8u9x/i_could_really_use_some_subs/ ) asking for advice on how to get subscribers . 
  same , asus xonar essence stx soundcard , windows 10 , uni xonar drivers . 
  i somtimes get a short , lound static hiss when starting wow . 
  oops , disenchanted the helmet . 
  hope another one drops . 
  price zombie is a neat bot that pulls price stats from amazon . 
  there are no good or bad classes currently . 
  all classes can be viable in current raids , on some classes some specs are preferable to others . 
  for choosing a class i can recommend you go with what you feel like playing , what seems fun to you . 
  you can make every class work . 
  shamans are viable as healers and dps , and both in pve and pvp . 
  you are aware that uabtodd was being very , very sarcastic ? 
  it 's people reading the new tab and downvoting low-effor posts and non-related content . 
  like your post for example . 
  i like my warlock , and the requirement to switch between destro and affliction depending on the encounter makes it all the more interesting . 
  in general i was not talking about fun to play , as that is very much subjective , but more in terms of viable in a `` progress '' raid . 
  progress being quoted as this addon is pretty much over . 
  very powerful xenon flashes should do the trick . 
  how is it surprising that bus is the cheapest ? 
  it 's the least comfortable and slowest of the common long distance public transport options ( bus trains and planes ) . 
  my last journey by bus was stuttgart < -  paris . 
  the bus was eurolines . 
  that bus did not have electricity , wifi or anything invented in the last 20 years . 
  legroom was pretty non-existant and the toilet did not work . 
  that was probably my most miserably travel experience by far . 
  i very much prefer long distance trains like the german ice , french tgv or the austrian \u00d6bb railjet . 
  those trains have far more comfortable seating , usually offer full outlets and tables for laptops and always have wifi . 
  also you can get up and walk to the restaurant / bar when you do n't feel like sitting in your seat anymore . 
  also , managers that prefer bus ? 
  any manager i ever talked to only travels by business / first class airplane and limousine service . 
  choose one . 
  really ? 
  i find their helles ( untergiesinger erhellung ) is pretty consistent and i like it . 
  to add to that , for tum you need certified copies of stuff like past grades . 
  just copying them yourself will not work . 
  i start to belive there is a weisses br\u00e4uhaus marketing team in this sub . 
  every thread that is even remotely connected to food that place gets recommended . 
  i know it 's good , i 've been several times , but it 's just a disproportional ammount of mentions in here . 
  we do n't really have liquor stores here . 
  just go to any decent super market , they 'll have it . 
  the edeka i usually shop at has a nice variety , they even sell good single malt like laphroaig . 
  the food at hans im gl\u00fcck is rather disappointing . 
  of the burger places here i 'd recommend the hamburgerei or one of the burger houses . 
  just get [ rapid environment editor ] ( http://www.rapidee.com/en/about ) .

  you did n't by any chance listen to [ 99 % invisible podcast 's episode about lawyer ads ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/call-now/ ) ? 
  i listened to that today and now i see your post , baader-meinhoff phenomenon hits hard . 
  if you have n't listened to an episode of that podcast yet , you should . 
  it 's probably my all-time favorite pod cast . 
  it 's 30 min episodes of high production value that tell a story usually about a little known design curiosity . 
  i agree , while i like that rapid ee exists , i would like even more if i did n't need it . 
  not if you 're lucky with your t18 bonus :  . 
  germany here , could you ship some here ? 
  that specific episode talks about the regulations on lawyer ads , how it differs massively from state to state and how it was completely forbidden for a long them . 
  it then finishes with an interview with lowell `` the hammer '' stanley , one of the attorneys that does those over the top ads . 
  in general they have episodes about very diverse topics , from stuff like the [ apparently famous pdx airport carpet ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pdx-carpet/ ) to stuff like [ the sunshine hotel , new yorks last `` skid row '' hotel ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-sunshine-hotel/ ) . 
  i 'd recommend just going to their [ episodes ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/category/episode/ ) page and clicking on something that seems interesting to you . 
  each of the episodes is about 30 min long . 
  that 's not really the same . 
  liquor stores sell pretty much only alcoholic drinks , and that is their purpose since other stores ca n't sell it . 
  here every store can sell any kind of alcohol it wants . 
  just a heads-up , gifting soap is kind of a `` you smell bad '' move . 
  as in before they were teleported to the starting zone ? 
  when you enter new zones , make sure you two choose the same buildings there , as the buildings decide which quest lines you will have . 
  cheapest would probably be ride sharing services , like blablacar . 
  other than that , if you still have time , you can see if you can get a cheap ice ( high speed train ) ticket . 
  some months in advance you can often get a deal as low as 20-30 $ . 
  personally i 'm not a fan of bus travel , but there are a ton of services to choose from , and that could be nearly as cheap as ride sharing . 
  i 'm sad that guy did n't drive onto the road . 
  would have loved to see him eat shit on tarmac . 
  any opinion on raspbian vs arch arm ? 
  is this official ? 
  did you license them ? 
  it does n't actually say `` rick and morty '' on that page , but he said it here , and it 's an official social media account of that seller . 
  congratz on getting married !, 
  got my dsi yesterday , but normal , ilvl 690 . 
  also got my t18 chest in warforged normal . 
  dsi ilvl 690 is , according to simcraft , still better than the 705 chipped soul prism from kazzak , but only by about 200 dps .
