  just be carefull not to stain the vinegar , only use fresh washed cutlery to grab one from the bucket and do not put your hand in it or it will become murky go bad in just a few days . 
  looks really promising , but right now i 'm sceptical if a 70 $ device can hold up to the promised performance . 
  the micro sd card still works , 
  i might try that out , but i doubt it , the connector springs sat pretty accurate and hat sufficient pressure on the card . 
  edit/update : you were right :d . i crammed the pieces into an usb socket on an external usb hub and when i was satisfied i plugged the hub into the computer and : [ it works ] ( http://minus.com/lsm5mwkslmncb ) . 
  updated the album with some new pics . 
  now i 'll try it with a bigger card . 
  also that capacitor becomes amazingly hot ... 
  edit2/update : i tried it with [ a 16 gb card ] ( http://minus.com/lbwj9dwdgf7qw8 ) , but it does not work . 
  edit3/update : i plugged the working 8gb card into a microsd/sd adapter and strange things happened :, 
  i now only see 1 file on the card named `` usbc\u00e1 \u00d6 . '', 
  which is 1,26 gb in size , but when i view the details of the card in windows i see 1,2 gb free , 6,19 gb used ( which is correct ) . 
  that controller seems to be using a strange file system/encoding . 
  since [ it now works again ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/tzaov/my_low_profile_usbstick_died_so_naturally_i/c4qzi4h ) i will try it out with a 16 gb card . 
  i did some research myself and the heat does in fact not come from the crystal , but the whole things heats up really fast . 
  this is probably because usb supplies 5v , but sd cards use 3,3 v and this device probably just uses some resistors to lower the voltage . 
  also [ i reassembled it partially ] ( http://i.minus.com/ibkqwebqzntem0.jpg ) and will probably tomorrow try to analyze their strange file system / file encoding . 
  the card that was in the device is 8gb and works . 
  i will probably analyze the filesystem tomorrow . 
  microsd cards are pretty cheap nowadays . 
  i [ partially reassembled ] ( http://i.minus.com/ibkqwebqzntem0.jpg ) it so it would be a cool reader . 
  problem is that it uses a [ weird format ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/tzaov/my_low_profile_usbstick_died_so_naturally_i/c4qzi4h ) , see update 3 in the linked post . 
  luckily i had no important data on it . 
  i can just pull the card out and plug in a different one . 
  yes , it 's probably some weird custom format . 
  sorry , but electronics do n't work like that  . 
  if you have a given voltage at the input you know how many ampere will flow through which resistor . 
  having more ampere available will not cause more stress to a design which only draws a fixed current . 
  oh , and it 's resistor . 
  i think i heard of that before , but i have no idea on how common that is . 
  thought about it , but did not yet do it . 
  maybe if i have some time tomorrow i 'll attempt it . 
  edit : the usb stick part seems to have stopped working , the led lights up , but windows only recognizes it as i looked inside that file and it was empty and prompts me to insert a medium . 
  i then put the card in my microsd/sd adapter started checkdisk recovery on the card.it fixed some errors and , corrected the size of the usbalsfkj\u00f6lvkaj\u00f6dlf file to 0b and created a folder with recovered files named file < numbe  . chk . 
  if i rename those to mp3 and they play fine , so they are the recovered music files from the card . 
  i did not yet get the rest of the usb stick to work again though ... 
  does this activate on steam ? 
  you do . 
  my monitor is connected via a dvi < -  hdmi cable to my gtx460 and has an audio out that works . 
  if you like old print adverts you will love [ this ] ( http://books.google.de/books?id=ok8xtrhowscc&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_all_issues_r&amp;cad=1&amp;atm_aiy=1950#all_issues_anchor ) . 
  it 's every `` popular science '' magazine starting in 1870 for free . 
  it 's built in , i see it as `` nvidia high definition audio '' . 
  it 's a seperate sound device . 
  and , i have 3 seperate of those since the card has 3 outputs ( 2x dvi , 1x hdmi ) . 
  basically my graphics card has 3 built in digital-only sound cards . 
  i 've tried both , the 350 and the 360 and imho the 360 is more comfortable for longer sessions and sounds better , so i bought a pc-360 . 
  be careful with this . 
  the multiplayer is broken as hell and you will get random disconnects . 
  also resuming from a multiplayer savegame has not once worked for anyone of me and my friends . 
  this is by no means news , it was posted in / r/android months ago . 
  my friends and i bought it when it was on sale last time in anticipation of some cool 4 player matches , but turns out those wo n't happen any time soon ... 
  same here in germany , 
  sorry , i do n't think i fully understand the question , but it 's also illegal to drink alcohol before 16 . 
  15 if you are accompanied by your parents and they allow you to . 
  it actually is n't bad , if you like pilsners . 
  afaik collector 's editions are limited to 1 purchase per customer , at least in the stores here . 
  but i do n't know for sure , i did n't buy diablo 3 .

  on whiteside ridge it worked pretty well , [ here are some screenshots ] ( http://minus.com/m2olwj6hz/1g ) . 
  maybe he will cast ... 
  imgur scaled them down to 1.920 px \u00d7 1.080 px . 
  use [minus.com ] ( http://minus.com/ ) for full resolution screenshots . 
  i will upload mine from this bwe as soon as i come home . 
  those clipping issues and underwater problems are a known bug in the high-res screenshot feature . 
  nice pictures though . 
  even with the magnifying glass it does not go to the original resolution , since imgur crops and crompresses images . 
  check for your self . 
  original resolution of hd screenshots taken from a 1080p monitor is 7680x4320 , but imgur compressed them to 1920x1080 . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.minus.com/icsocbpqiel7k.jpg ) is an example of a full resolution hd screenshot . 
  can you chose other weapons ?

  thanks for the insight . 
  how long did 1 run take you on average and did you find the paths to be balanced in time consumed and difficulty ? 
  i only tried the path with the asura , but my group failed to get past the point where he set up the 2 essence collectors due to lack of coordination . 
  i opened 4 or 5 boxes , each of which contained a key . 
  that is the most useless piece of hardware i have seen in a long time . 
  and it does n't even look good .

  the picture is grainy , the colors are blurred into each other , most noticeable on the tree . 
  also the over saturated red looks ridiculous . 
  the building is nice , the picture ... not so much . 
  please post your minerals in the comments of one of the 100000 mineral pictures that currently roam / r/pics .

  there is no way that cat spread them so perfectly even . 
  could you do them in a higher resolution for different phones , i would like to have 960x540 , most beautiful imho is the divinity 's reach one . 
  you are right , 540x960, 
  thanks ,

  we sometimes call narrow and steep stairs `` stiegen '' .
