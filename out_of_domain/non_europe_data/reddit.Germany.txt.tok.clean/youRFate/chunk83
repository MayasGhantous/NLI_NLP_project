  scryer tier was perfect for doing that fall damage achievement . 
  just do it with other people . 
  fastest way is to find someone with a 2 person flying mount and unlocked draenor flight . 
  and the archimode trinket does a hilariously broken amount of damage . 
  only problem is in 5 man dungeons you have to turn around so the boss hits you in the back just to trigger that trinket . 
  brilliant . 
  which expansion was that created for ? 
  might have to give that to our guilds ' druid class leader . 
  how about [ mmo champion ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5290-legion-class-preview-series-druid ) ? 
  the cata timewalking event is on the ptr , not on the normal realms . 
  which trinket combinations do you prefer for which bosses ? 
  also , we do prefer seraphim over holy shield , right ? 
  if you want to take a look at some logs , [ here ] ( https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/wkjrh2ynkmxwglfn ) are some from the twink raid i tanked ( pala is my twink , i main wl ) . 
  i was not using seraphim back then , but i have since switched . 
  name is tathmo , [ armory ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/eredar/tathmo/advanced ) . 
  the wallet goes in the wallet hatch , left of the steering wheel . 
  it 's part of the package that also contains the cup holders on the e90 . 
  wagons are something completely different . 
  sav is a term invented by bmw for their suvs . 
  nope , my car is pre-lci as well . 
  forced induction excells most at high altitues , when compared to na engines . 
  that is why a lot of aircraft engines were turbo charged . 
  also , why do you have a heckler & koch sticker on your car ? 
  you really should add wheels that fit the widebody , those arches need to be full to the brim . 
  this just looks empty . 
  also , you need a few degrees of camber to make it look right . 
  i know these are audis , but [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/n54dr4d.jpg ) is the fitment you should be going for imho . 
  asked the other paladin as well , here are my questions :,

  also , i like your flowchart :d . 
  i usually do :, 
  alias ls = ` ls - h -- color -- group-directories-first ', 
  this makes the changes from the first one propagate to my other variants of the ls command . 
  have a look at my mog [ here ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/list=8358895/eu-eredar-baelsan ) . 
  i think the green really fits with the green destro fire , but the somewhat grey/blue also fits with my affliction spec . 
  the robe , waist , hands and shoulders are t14 hc , head is from archimonde . 
  now all i need is the green staff from mythic archimonde ... 
  i always go with allahu akbar , this works on a surprising number of people . 
  let me see ... bmw . 
  nah , door compartment is filled with a pack of gums , a pair of gloves and the here mandantory safety vest . 
  phone goes in the ash tray in front of the shifter . 
  the wallet compartment [ looks like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4dkg6xr.jpg ) ( not my car , google image search ) . 
  thank you for the advice . 
  i might spec into holy avenger , but i heard that only really becomes usefull once you have the legendary ring so you can always use that in the ring phase . 
  some people on the german e90 forums have done that , but it is an astonishing amount of work and involves cutting the hole in your dashboard yourself . 
  nope , my friend 's e90 pre lci has it , too . 
  yes , it looks like this : http://i.imgur.com/4dkg6xr.jpg ( not my car , google image search ) . 
  i actually found this , whithout the color and group switches , in the default . bashrc of the university pcs . 
  i really liked it so i started using it on all my machines . 
  thanks , that helps a lot !, 
  instantly made a copy . 
  yes , that 's something that i noticed a lot while reading neuromancer . 
  they are in this very futuristic world , but they still use landline phones , nobody has cell phones . 
  also , the cyber world is a green grid . 
  well , just let your raid lead use it then ... 
  iskar has a glaive like skill . 
  affliction warlocks go oom , but all they have to do it hit life tap 2 times and the mana is full again :d . 
  get dbm , it will tell you stuff like `` you are standing in shit you should ' t be standing in '' or , `` the other tank has 3 stacks of whatever , taunt now '' . 
  generally , you might want to whisper the other tank at the beginning , tank bros is a real thing . 
  if the tank you end up tanking with turns out to be a dick , do n't be discouraged , that is rather the exception , just try again . 
  i see myself as a somewhat experienced tank ( tank is my twink , but still , i 've tanked my fair share of hfc runs ) , and i still usually whisper the other tank on the rare occasion that i join lfr . 
  usually just to say hello , or to shittalk the rest of the group :d . 
  also , if you want more to read up on , you can visit the weekly [ tanking tuesday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3atanking%2btuesday ) threads here . 
  yes , but many lte base stations deliver the data to some other place via directional antennas like in the gif . 
  aur uses git , and git checks the file integrity itself . 
  no need for md5 sums here .

  you can see both my specs in the armoy , for affliction i swap unblinking gaze for my heroic fotds . 
  sadly i do n't have a gsr yet . 
  i will have the legendary ring next week ( if i 'm not extraordinarily unlucky , need 3 tomes ) . 
  from looking at other wls i 've so far gathered that i should probably try to get more shadowburns in while on destro . 
  also , my immolate uptime is n't as high as it should be . 
  my openers could also be higher , but that has , at least in part , something to do with the large fps drops i experience on pull . 
  i 've tried disabling just about all of my addons , but that did n't help either , i think my machine might need some upgrades . 
  feel free to ask for advice as well , if you feel like i am qualified to answer  . 
  when working on progress you will be swapping between affliction and destruction depending on the encounter . 
  for starting out i 'd recommend destruction , as it is the more versatile of the two specs , i.e. 
  you can do decent in every fight with destro , but some fights are just bad for affli . 
  for guides i 'd recommend [ furty 's destro guide ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1731435-6-2-furty-s-destruction-warlock-guide ) and [ astrothug 's affliction guide ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1828134-6-2-affliction-warlock-guide ) . 
  both of them also frequent this thread afaik . 
  furty has a section on trinkets in his [ guide ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1731435-6-2-furty-s-destruction-warlock-guide ) . 
  basically what i get from it is if you do n't have a gsr and the fight is not suited for fotds then you should probably go dsi + unblinking gaze of sethe . 
  we played horde on a private pve server , and friend of mine created a guild named `` rogue trainer '' . 
  he then used that exilir that makes you look like a night elv , went to darnassus , kited that rogue trainer in the basement around a corner and killed him . 
  then he stood in his place , waiting for a poor soul to right click him , therefore being flagged for pvp . 
  i was on another rogue , stealthed , nearby . 
  in wow ( bc ) we would go into the nagrand arena ( world pvp area , everyone in there is ffa ) with 3 ppl , one of them a warlock . 
  then we would invite random people into our group , port them there , kick them from the group and kill them over and over again . 
  thanks for the review !, 
  as for doomguard , i was under the impression that saving it for the bl / tw phase was the best way to maximize it 's output ( we use bl in the infernal phase , once the second nether group comes back up ) . 
  using havoc on infernals and shadowburning archimonde did n't even occur to me yet , thanks !, 
  also , sorry about the german logs , but our raid lead uses german wow so they turn out german . 
  they also sometimes confuse me despite me beeing german , as i 've always used english wow clients . 
  thanks for the feedback !, 
  i 'm using the weakauras from [strongauras.com ] ( http://strongauras.com/ ) and i really like them , oomm is a weakauras wizard :d .
