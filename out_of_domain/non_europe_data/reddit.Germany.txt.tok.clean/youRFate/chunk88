  while you 're at it , might i suggest the elusive [ hockey puck method ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki9fgoe_lbc ) ? 
  using it you can lower your car to the absolute maximum for just a few bucks !, 
  yep , so good . 
  i 'm currently rocking the * predator * title , but * overlord * would be accpetable as well . 
  yup . 
  a few people of our guild got 725 items form mythic dungeons . 
  oh people do mind that . 
  if you want to build a 710 + group you 'll have to set the minimum ilvl to 710 , which you ca n't do if you do n't have it yourself . 
  apparently the t17 2pc is really nice with demo , see [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3w7t4s/timewalk_minmaxing_bis_gear_broken_gear/cxu11dy ) in a thread about tw bis i made yesterday . 
  great compilation of tw gear information , thanks !, 
  i personally do n't really feel like respecing to demo , so i 'll use destro instead . 
  would they find out if he does n't tell them ? 
  how does that stack up to arkinventory ? 
  get the addon postal , you can use it to automatically empty your mailbox , or to empty a certain type of mails . 
  just come to the inn on the upper floor at the shrine of the two moons , that 's where all the cool people hang out . 
  easiest method is to get the addon [ premade group finder ] ( http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-group-finder ) and setting it to scan for groups named * xemirkol * . 
  maybe include some common misspellings etc. 
  that 's how me and two other guild mates got the title on the same day we got jungle stalker done . 
  do n't forget to create a group and wait for a little while if you actually find him yourself . 
  that 's also the method i used for getting the rarespawn mounts ( bloodhoof bull , sundhide gronnling etc. 
  aka the `` let me put some cool stuff on my desk and hope people comment on it '' thread . 
  that 's why we alwas busted out a transmog mount before we started archimonde . 
  got ta get all those new items transmogged . 
  they recently capped the mount scaling . 
  that said , legendary ring activation does make you quite a lot bigger . 
  i did n't actually run as many as i had planned to , but it was fun eitherway . 
  no mount for me either , though . 
  bought the armored bloodwing from the store as a consolation because it is currently 50 % off :d . 
  i 'm rocking the bloodwing on my undead warlock . 
  my current transmog does not fit it all that well , but i still love it . 
  not at home right now , and i 'd have to first clear off some stuff . 
  do n't worry , the beyerdynamic headphones make up for all the mess in the world . 
  do n't downvote him , this is true . 
  stuff like that is why i prefer the credit card touch screen order terminals which pretty much every mcd here in europe now has . 
  i 'd go for febreeze . 
  i had that for real once . 
  i went to bed kinda late and had that lingering feeling that there was something else that i had forgotten about . 
  i checked my calendar in bed , and realized i had a presentation due next day . 
  i finished it that night , had about 2 hours of sleep and then aced the presentation . 
  this does not help in alleviating my procrastination , as it furthers my `` i can get away with anyting '' feeling . 
  fun fact : if you dial 911 in germany you 'll end up at the headquarters of porsche . 
  useful fact if you 're ever in germany : the emergency numbers are 110 ( police ) and 112 ( medical emergencies , fire department and police ) . 
  it 's not an emergency number , probably as it 's too easy to butt-dial or to be dialed by an error in the old analog phone systems . 
  it 's not in use . 
  there still are some older 3 digit numbers around . 
  actually , you will probably have to dial the stuttgart ( 0711 ) area code in front of 911 , unless you are in stuttgart . 
  amg engines sound so lovely , that 's probably why i love the pagani cars so much . 
  the amg v12 in the zonda r is most likely one of the best sounds on earth . 
  calctape is on the play store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.sfr.calctape&amp;hl=en, 
  likely still torrent . 
  well , it does require pata negra ham ( $ 50/lb ) , beluga caviar ( $ 3,200 - $ 4,500 / lb ) and black truffles ( $ 500 - $ 1,000 / lb . 
  ** wew bursche **, 
  i personally would keep the ones inside , just because i 'd guess they are hard to remove , but i 'd remove every m on the outside of the car if it 's not an m3/4/5 / 6 . 
  is it just me or are those wheel arches waaay too large to be filled ? 
  my left ear enjoyed this . 
  oh , i really need to go there . 
  13 : magazine swag . 
  i 've never waited longer than maybe 20 minutes for lfr on my dps . 
  i 'm on eredar eu , horde . 
  there is an addon called multishot that does this for many major events , like boss kills , achievements , levelups . 
  aww it 's got the corsair gaming tramp stamp . 
  still a nice kb , though . 
  eredar ( eu ) has about 95 % horde and is quite populated , so there are always people around . 
  recently i 've visited warspear on alleria-eu , and it was just empty . 
  on eredar warspear is so full of players it kinda kills my framerate . 
  nah , the door is just open so you can see the hand reaching in through the mail slot . 
  i 'm on eredar and i like it here , it 's a pvp server , but nearly not alliance here . 
  needs gearing and a flywheel . 
  [ watch this ] ( https://vimeo.com/68830569 ) . 
  it 's a really interesting 18 minute documentary about the history of different aspect ratios . 
  tarantinos new movie is shot using ultra panavision 70mm cinematography , without any digital processing . 
  peel off the damn plastic you lunatic !, 
  yep , he bought 2 islands and built a house boat from fiber glass . 
  he 's currently laying the foundations for the adventure builder fortress there . 
  he bought 2 islands and built a houseboat . 
  he 's currenlty working on building a dock and some sheds on one of the islands so he can start farming there . 
  bmw keys have been charging in the ignition for several generations now . 
  pizza hut does all you can eat , i think every sunday . 
  there are a few preset keywords in cross realm assist that you can use in your description which prevent the addon from joining that group . 
  i think `` nohop '' is one of them . 
  users can of course disable that so the addon still joins those groups , but most do n't even know it 's there . 
  the upper grille in the front looks kind of bmw-esque . 
  pretty sure that was a [ bombardier 415 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombardier_415 ) which is pretty recent ( introduced 1994 ) . 
  would n't the totem only reflect one tick of the ground aoe though ? 
  is there a list somewhere with stuff i can cheese with that totem ? 
  i 've been using a g600 for about 2 years now . 
  i love the button placement and the size of the mouse , since i have kind of big hands . 
  i personally do n't like the naga either , since the buttons on it are not that easily distinguishable . 
  i use the side button for spells and actions that i do n't have to use that often , but that i still need quick access to , mostly spells that are on a longer cooldown . 
  i also like the mouse in non-mmo games . 
  in dota2 i have the inventory slots bound to the side buttons of the mouse . 
  in arma 3 i have different combat stances bound to the mouse . 
  also , the 3rd mouse button is useful in shooters , if you set it up to lower the mouse speed while holding it . 
  this can give you a precision advantage for example when sniping . 
  also , logitech customer support ist just plain awesome . 
  the left mouse button on my original g600 started becoming wonky after about 2 years , but after contacting logitech they sent me a new one , free of charge . 
  you can click the mouse wheel on logitech mice sideways . 
  i always bind lower / increase mouse dpi to left / right mousewheel click . 
  the download will be about 20-25 gb regardless if you buy the discs or not , as the content on the discs is so outdated wow probably wo n't even use it . 
  if you know anyone that plays wow in your area you can copy their installation , for example using an external hard drive or a big thumb drive .
