  we used to do that all the time back when internet was still slow where i lived . 
  i personally think wowhead is really easy to navigate and you can get to where you want quickly . 
   out threating our warrior, 
  oo i play a prot paladin as a twink and whenever i tank together with our main tank warri i really struggle keeping aggro , as he regularly does 50-60k + dps on bosses . 
  i 'd rather have him turn off righteous fury if he comes too close in aggro . 
  the archimonde trinket is riddiculously good on tank paladins and taking it off would make him lose a significant part of his dps and hps . 
  well , the schuko is the german system , we usually know what we 're doing , engineering wise . 
  truck work shops usually have workshop pits , that thing would n't work there either i guess . 
  oh wow , house of leaves looks gorgeous . 
  i 'll have to buy it now . 
  i can only imagine what people on the subway will think . 
  if i saw someone reading that and i did n't know what it was i would definitely ask them about it . 
  / thread, 
  thanks for the list !, 
  you know op edited them in to hide the names ? 
  i bet that is not actaully a machine . 
  there are people in there , i guarantee it . 
  ordered that yesterday as my holiday lecture . 
  that one was required reading for my abitur . 
  it 's acutally quite interesting if you work through it with your teacher . 
  i am , in fact , a german engineer , so i can freely criticize our trade . 
  that is how it works ... 
  i so hope the left front wheel is a different colour . 
  that would finish it nicely . 
  i 've had many beers from breweries that are older than that . 
  copy & paste my reply from the last time this came up :, 
   i 've been using a g600 for about 2 years now . 
  i love the button placement and the size of the mouse , since i have kind of big hands . 
  i personally do n't like the naga either , since the buttons on it are not that easily distinguishable . 
   i use the side button for spells and actions that i do n't have to use that often , but that i still need quick access to , mostly spells that are on a longer cooldown . 
  i also like the mouse in non-mmo games . 
  in dota2 i have the inventory slots bound to the side buttons of the mouse . 
  in arma 3 i have different combat stances bound to the mouse . 
  also , the 3rd mouse button is useful in shooters , if you set it up to lower the mouse speed while holding it . 
  this can give you a precision advantage for example when sniping . 
   also , logitech customer support ist just plain awesome . 
  the left mouse button on my original g600 started becoming wonky after about 2 years , but after contacting logitech they sent me a new one , free of charge . 
  probably could have crushed the car with pliers / disassembled it some other way . 
  once you got the axle out it should be removable . 
  hmm , i would have tried washing the hair and dumping half a bottle of conditioner in there . 
  i bet you could pull them out when the hair is wet and loaded with conditioner . 
  the front of my car looks better . 
  yep , that 's me . 
  i always back into spots unless i know i will need to do a lot of loading / unloading . 
  c-n c-p c-f c-b . 
  i really ca n't recommend [ union bindings ] ( https://www.unionbindingcompany.com/ ) enough . 
  they are an awesome company and their bindings are rock solid , look amazing and - best of all - ~ ~ are reasonably priced ~ ~ ( edit : they are more expensive than i remember them being ) . 
  i 've had my union force bindings for 3 years now and never had anything but fun with them . 
  also , if you shop does it , order them in different colors . 
  i 'm still kinda sad the store i bought them at would n't send me one neon green and one neon pink binding ... 
  lastly , if that is important for you , they are owned by c3 wich is a small company that also owns capita and coal . 
  by buying from them you 're not supporting the big companies like burton or technica that are hated by some . 
  me and a buddy once created a guild named < rogue trainer  , used an orb of deception and went to darnassus . 
  there we pulled the real rogue trainer behind the corner and killed him . 
  then one of us would stand in his place . 
  when a low level ally right-clicked the rogue trainer to learn spells they would attack and therefore be flagged for pvp , and we could murder them . 
  a lot of fun was had , especially since they did n't realize we were two and had full s4 pvp gear , so the ` reinforcements ' that eventually came also succumbed to our daggers . 
  this was back in tbc when pvp gear was extremely strong in open world pvp against pve equiped players due to resillience . 
  i 've never witnessed this much woosh in my life . 
  i heard the lightbringer series is acutally better than the night angel trilogy . 
  ca n't comment on that myself as i 've only read the lightbringer books , not the night angel ones . 
  i bought both these books as a reaction of reading the `` books you ca n't read on a kindle '' thread . 
  ** house of leaves , by mark z. danielewski **, 
  do n't really know what to make of it yet . 
  the jonny truant parts are a bit long winded and the character does n't seem that interesting , i 'm more intrigued by the house part of the story . 
  ** s. , by doug dorst and j.j. abrams **, 
  so far it 's more engaging than house of leaves . 
  i read them in paralell , as on the one hand i seem to enjoy s. more so far , but it 's a bit unwieldy to read on public transport with all the stuff that could fall out , also i do n't want to damage it . 
  finished the ** the wise man 's fear , by patrick rothfuss ** over the holidays . 
  while i agree they are consistently interesting without winded passages i have to say the whole series seems like generic cookie-cutter fantasy to me . 
  the books just keep on piling up stories of how great kvothe is with seemingly no real purpose to it . 
  that all being said , i will still read * the doors of stone * once it 's released as i am interested to see if there is an overarching plot and if there is , how it all ties together . 
  the classic here is `` eingelegte kellerstapfeln '' which roughly translates to `` pickled basement stair steps '' . 
  before there was flying in tanaan i 've helped to unstuck many players , especially in the iron harbour , using my warlock gates . 
  i 'm building an equipement set specifically for timewalking to maximize my dps there . 
  this makes it kind of bearable . 
  also , iirc the next event is wotlk , which is my favorite , and they added pit of saron . 
  however , this will only work if you wl has some destro gear and know how to play destro . 
  for the infernals you can get a lot of damage into them once archi is below 20 % if you farm up 3 embers , place havok on an infernal and then use shadowburn on archimonde 3 times . 
  [ vogler ] ( http://www.jazzbar-vogler.com/ ) is my recommendation for jazz bars in munich . 
  jam session every monday , that 's when we used to go there . 
  valor for 795 ring . 
  i also want to get the remaining 4 cm gold runs done . 
  i 'll probably do the timewalking quest on some more alts , mainly for the chance to get a timereaver . 
  it used to , but it does n't anymore . 
  the player health is most likey [ unit frames improved ] ( http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/unitframesimproved ) . 
  if you mean the raid frame / healing addon that should be [ vuhdo ] ( http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/vuhdo ) . 
  maybe try the [ archimonde belt ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=124200/demonbuckle-sash-of-argus&amp;bonus=0 ) . 
  you need to kite him during power overwhelming . 
  that said , i did it as a healer with a ilvl 650 monk tank and using cooldowns we managed to kill him without kiting . 
  spirit link totem helps a ton there . 
  somebody that 's very engaged in the culture surrounding sneakers and usually owns many pairs that he/she regards highly . 
  awesome !, 
  now do [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uajo4qn.gif ) . 
  or daimler . 
  sooo many of them driving around here in munich , but i 'll never get tired of that sound . 
  also maserati 's grille ornament is just plain badass . 
  the problem with the i8 is , it looks like a supercar , but it does n't have supercar performance . 
  it can in no way compete with the other hybrid supercars ( porsche 918 , mclaren p1 , koenigsegg regera , ferrari laferrari ) . 
  even a performance sedan like an m4 will absolutely wreck it .
