  use [minus.com ] ( http://minus.com/ ) for uncompressed screenshots . 
  here are my uncompressed high-res screenshots :, 
  * [ stress test ] ( http://minus.com/mf23xy6zc/1g ), 
  edit : the storage space on minus is limited to 10gb per user . 
  if you use [ my invitation link ] ( http://min.us/rq2jfba ) you 'll get 1gb extra and i also get 1 more gb of storage ( but i think 10gb is enough anyways ) . 
  i 'm currently using 700mb of 11gb , so i think i wo n't run out of space ever . 
  added you in steam , i hav 2 keys , want dota invite for a friend . 
  saw it used for some gigapixel shots somewhere , so i thought it would be good for high res gw2 screens , since it allows images up to 1gb per file and does not compress them . 
  food that gets advertised by it 's price usually is n't the best to be found ... 
  i love how paintitgold clearly called him xbox on several occasions during the finals ... 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/ ), 
  i still have mine , 
  sorry for my ignorance , but putting some fat in a pan , heating it up and then putting the bacon in does n't seem hard to me , i do n't see where it could go wrong . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://machineofdeath.net/ebook ) , good read . 
  oh , so you 're the `` i burned the salad '' kind of person , 
  go somewhere far from big cities , the sky will look more like this that you ever imagined . 
  it 's not that hard ... 
  same as [ this ] ( http://i.minus.com/i3r9p5i8w9dbm.jpg ), 
  you can listen to tobi in dotatv . 
  i would imagine the box was originally on the back of the motocycle ... 
  well , if the table has a rough surface it could create unpleasant scratching sounds without a coaster . 
  the beef gehts done in 1 minute ? 
  also the carrots a probably still hard if they are this chunky . 
  the seychelles are the most beautiful islands ever imho . 
  we have these here in germany , too, 
  in that case , it looks fine , 
  does n't matter , just keep going . 
  no one can ever stop you . 
  nope , sorry . 
  i drove under it when it was nearly finished once , and last time i was there it was finished . 
  here is a corresponding wikipedia article btw : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnbr%c3%bccke, 
  nr 8 and 9 looked better before imho . 
  brace yourselves , origin is comming !, 
  they would if apple would have stuck to the usb standard instead of requiring special chargers which do n't output more power than most phone/tablet chargers , but signal to the ipad that it should now charge . 
  you do realize that that in ops picture is a standard usb socket where you can charge just like every phone ? 
  4th of july has been the date of the city festival here in lauchheim , germany since 1248 . 
  also some kind of new nation celebrates something there i heard ... 
  you should n't have to buy your own jacket ... :d, 
  if you weight about 50 kilo ... 
  as far as i 'm aware it is customary that charge-only usb sockets signal their power rating to the device by applying a certain low voltage difference to the data pins . 
  apple somhow has different values for those , that is the reason they are not compatible to other brand 's chargers . 
  which spells are generated how can be seen here : http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/invoker#invoked_skills_summary, 
  i do n't know if it 's the fact that i 'm currently on a laptop instead of my normal keyboard or if it 's the tool , but ingame i 'm a lot faster than with your tool . 
  still great idea , i thought of making something simmilar some days ago . 
  i guess the reason is that ingame i think of which spell i want and immediately invoke it , while with your tool i first have to look which spell it wants . 
  improvements :, 
  * i think some visual indicator on correct spells would be cool , expecially when i get the same spell twice in a row i sometimes think i got them wrong . 
  generally , invoking the same spell twice in a row should not happen inagme . 
  * cool would be if you could display the spells that are currently invoked ( both ) and require the user to `` cast '' the spells instead of just invoking . 
  if i still have that spell i do n't have to invoke it again . 
  * you could not only ask for spells , but also health regen , attack dmg or speed , so players have to go qqq/eee/www , just like ingame after you invoked a spell you go back to the currently preferred orbs, 
  * also : rebindable keys , since many people do n't play invoker with these keys , and legacy keys are totally different . 
  that one is more configurable , but reading the spell name , really ? 
  ctrl + f `` steam '' , was not disappoint . 
  if anyone else still has n't played it , i also have a spare copy to give away . 
  there is skype for android , and many phones do have arm based chips . 
  got mine today :d, 
  trade already completed . 
  why ca n't tobi stream ? 
  but epi is cool , too , 
  i think that is ribbed plastic tubing . 
  guldwars2 also did this rally nicely . 
  they even have standard windows window buttons in the top right corner to minimize , make windowed and close . 
  seriously ?? 
  you took a picture of a tweet that has already been posted here , then added vintage photo effects ( this is where it becomes really wtf ) and reposted it here ? 
  you are the cancer of reddit today . 
  i think your definition of `` medieval '' is off by several centuries ... 
  sure , but those houses are not medieval . 
  a mouse lags a bit , but a keyboard does the job really nice . 
  sadly i 'm having problems connecting my android phone as a remote . 
  i 'm running raspbmc rc3 . 
  youtube 1080p also runs smooth as hell . 
  can anyone explain to me what he is doing wrong there ? 
  should he be wearing a uniform or something ? 
  you do realize , that the bow and the arrows are only computer renders , do you ? 
  it 's `` lense flare '' . 
  it 's `` lense flare '' . 
  no , it prevents certain insects from climbing it . 
  both enabled an working from a web browser , but the app says it ca n't connect . 
  it even works from the phone 's browser ... 
  yes . 
  it only works on lan since i did not forward the port . 
  but since i only intend to use it from here i do n't need to forward that port . 
  yes , i can access the interface via a computer and even from the browser of my phone . 
  just the app does not work . 
  since i 'm connecting directly in my lan i use the lan ip of the raspberry pi . 
  if i use the hostname of my network i would be redirected to the webserver of my nas . 
  oh , right :d . but to my defense , wikipedia states that `` lense '' is also used sometimes . 
  that looks really similar , since i even have the same router . 
  i will look into that probably this weekend , since i 'm currently preparing for some exams , but thanks !, 
  i will let you know if i fixed it . 
  also : [ ogre club ] ( http://www.dota2wiki.com/images/f/f8/ogre_club.png ), 
  / r/rainbowbar, 
  / r/metacirclejerk, 
  / r/metametacirclejerk, 
  those are probably only empty exoskeletons . 
  actually many of them . 
  i actually love it when spaghetti are so soaked in parmesan that the cheese pulls strings when eating them . 
  that was just way too much of a setup ... 
  it 's probably being towed by a towing truck , not a decaled truck of some sort .
