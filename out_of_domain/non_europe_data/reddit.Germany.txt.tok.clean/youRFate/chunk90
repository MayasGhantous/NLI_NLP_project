  and then there is [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ ) problem with it ... 
  i remember using the taunt + divine shield trick whenever i tanked him back in wotlk before i had raid gear . 
  later in wotlk progression with a fully icc geared tank you 'd merely have to pop some minor defense cooldown . 
  we tanked him against the wall near the cave exit so you would n't be sent flying through the room at all . 
  still working on dragonwrath , but i got myself some random old staff with bis stats and sockets , a helmet with a meta socket , a int-on-use trinket and some other gear with sockets . 
  this alone pushes the dps in tw instances significantly . 
  oh , thanks !, 
  i still have to do cm gold there , this might help . 
  aww yes , and that axe looked bad-ass back in the day . 
  yes , but some gear scales differently . 
  mostly older gear with lots of sockets . 
  those do n't get downscaled and you can stack up a lot of additional stats . 
  for example the staff i use in timewalking has roughly 50 % more int as my heroic edict of argus when both are downscaled in timewalk . 
  in addition to that , set boni also do n't become scaled down and can provide large benefits . 
  interesting . 
  now i want to simcraft it for an affliction warlock ... 
  [ item on wowhead ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=133485/unspeakable-secret&amp;bonus=615 ) if anyone is interested . 
  somehow the midweek mending thread is still stickied , we do n't even have the thursday loot thread yet ... 
  hi , 13/13hc , 5/13mythic wl ( [ armory ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/eredar/baelsan/advanced ) , destro gear ) here , thought i 'd give you some advice until the firepower thread comes up :, 
  ok , some analysis from the log / u/ruxir linked :, 
  * you did n't sacrifice your imp , it attacked the boss throughout the fight, 
  * you did n't use soulburn : haunt even once . 
  having a high uptime on haunting spirits is important . 
  * you could have used dark soul misery more often , especially you should use it during bloodlust, 
  * you did n't use your doomguard . 
  use it during bloodlust, 
  generally with affliction you should know that it is very good on some bosses , but it does n't perform very well on some others . 
  i play affliction on iron reaver , hellfire council , zakuun , velhari and sometimes on archimonde . 
  for the other bosses i play destruction . 
  i can really recommend [ this ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1828134-6-2-3-affliction-warlock-guide ) guide to you , it 's very in-depth . 
  the only part i do n't fully agree with in that guide is the recommendation to favor mastery . 
  that is good advice if you want to use one set of gear for both aff and destro , but if you build 2 sets then you should favor haste for affliction . 
  you can actually train the council fight there pretty nicely , as there are usually 3 raider dummies . 
  try to keep agony , corruption and unstable affliction applied to all 3 of them . 
  for council-type fights ( multiple bosses , present most of the time ) you want to start the fight differently that you would on a single boss encounter . 
  for multiple bosses you start by precasting soulbun : haunt and unstable affliction . 
  then you apply agony and corruption and use the 2 remaining soul shards to spreads those dots to the other 2 bosses . 
  then it 's a game of keeping them ticking , especially agony . 
  for council you wo n't use a lot of drain soul while you have 3 targets as you 'll be busy keeping everything dotted and keeping haunting spirits up . 
  use [ this guide ] ( http://puu.sh/keyvt/2b55237fbd.jpg ) , it tells you everything you need to know . 
  he 's still playing classic . 
  i think class tinket is fine on council . 
  you wo n't be using drain soul a whole lot while you still have 3 targets , but you can still keep up agony , corruption and unstable affliction on all bosses . 
  on destro class trinket is imho only viable on fights where you mainly work on the boss , without many ads . 
  for most destro fights i prefer unblinking gaze of sethe . 
  also , against demon bosses orb of voidsight + dsi outperform the other trinkets in both specs . 
  it actually is n't bad . 
  by that logic lfr gear would be the best gear ... 
  you forgot raiders that have specific timewalking gear and have run the content when it was current . 
  they carry the team but are easily disgruntled when people do n't play the boss mechanics or use the old shortcuts properly . 
  13/13hc , 5/13m wl here to answer questions until someone qualified arrives  . 
  [ logs ] ( https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/11177430/latest ) | [ armory ( currently destro equiped , i have 2 sets ) ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/eredar/baelsan/advanced ) | [ bis list and spec / trinket discussion ( 2nd page ) ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzvpebsi5duhxqzswi7ew1dnprkhuhuvz-ab-k3w3t8/edit?usp=sharing ), 
  i play both destro and aff depending on the fight . 
  if you find anything worth improving in my logs ( i 'm sure there is quite a bit ) please tell me . 
  i play aff on mythic countil , 89k dps is n't the best but can still be improved ofc . 
  might get higher once we get the fight to farm status , we only started progressing on mythic a few ids ago . 
  also , to get the really good parses on council you have to get the dmg buff , but who gets that is random . 
  for tracking immolate i juse use the nameplates . 
  usually you do n't have that many targets that you have to keep immolate up on . 
  as for class trinket , on destro i only use that on fights where you mainly hit the boss , since building up those stacks on ads usually wo n't happen since they die so fast . 
   you want to run supremacy over sac on this . 
  interesting , what 's the reason for this ? 
   class trinket imo makes 3 incredibly annoying, 
  what 's your solution there ? 
  different trinket or only dot 2 bosses ? 
  right , have to try that next week . 
  any tips for getting 20 stacks in the vision at killrog ? 
  made it to only 14 last time . 
  we single-target killed a few of the weak imps as they spawned , once enough mobs were there i switchted to f & b and started aoeing the mobs . 
  i use that trinket all the time while playing aff so i 'm kinda used to it . 
  on my [ best parse there ] ( https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/drx9adjzlmhfk4kw#fight=9&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=19 ) i had imho pretty decent dot uptimes on all 3 but it only added up to 89k dps , with 726 ilvl back then . 
  i probably mostly need more practice because i only started `` properly '' playing that fight like 3 kills ago , before that i basically tunneled on gurtog . 
  swapping specs is pretty fast , you might only miss a few trash hits . 
  and before a boss is pulled there should be sufficient time for that anyways , as the raid lead will always wait for everyone to be ready . 
  in case of lfr , try wiping the raid while still maintaining a high enough dps so nobody wants to kick you / suspects it was you . 
  priests have good potential here . 
  for example on archimonde you can pull the 2nd tank into the nether banish , so that archimonde starts hitting random dps players . 
  another favorite of mine is placing a summoning stone and having a mage place a portal to ancient dalaran in front of it , then yell `` help port '' . 
  nah , that one is better suited for pug groups . 
  well , i 'm not the mage ... :p, 
  hmm , have to try that . 
  i do n't really think there is enough time to keep dots on all 3 bosses and refresh haunt with drain soul . 
  have to spend some time at the targeting dummies it seems . 
  is there a way to get the targeting dummies displayed in the boss frames of my interface ? 
  because that 's what i use to keep track of the dots on council . 
  iskar is definitely a candidate , since there it even works well on the adds since they live fairly long . 
  other than that i 'd say kilrogg is a definite candidate to further push the damage after you get out of the vision . 
  raid lead did some change ups last time , i 'm on first vision duty now  . 
  still have to get used to it , but it worked fairly ok for the first time ( 14 stacks ) . 
  the heal one . 
  do you see the stacks of tires ? 
  the cage ? 
  the removed windows ? 
  that is a driftcar , not a stanced daily ... 
  i would n't call human bone unpredictable ... 
  for a second there i thought they bought [ kraus-maffei wegmann ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/krauss-maffei_wegmann ) , which is a different , but related company that builds pretty much all modern german military vehicles , such as the [ leopart tanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard_2 ) and [ boxer afvs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boxer_%28armoured_fighting_vehicle%29 ) . 
  i like to imagine they wanted to buy kmw , and are now severely disappointed to find injection molding machines instead of tanks . 
  not to impose , but are you 725 + yourself ? 
  there are many groups that actually do require the `` correct '' ilvl , but a lot of people do n't see them since their own ilvl is n't high enough . 
  all they see are the `` fake '' groups where it says 725 or something in the title , but the req , is 712 or whatever .
