  this creates a selection bias of sorts , where people are lead to believe that most groups what require high ilvl are `` fake '' , since those are the only ones they see . 
  as i 've asked [ above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/40be3h/found_this_abomination_of_a_premade_in_lfg_today/cytz0e5 ) , are you 710 + yourself ? 
  because if you are n't then you ca n't even see the `` real '' 710 + groups as groups with ilvl requirement higher than your current ilvl are not shown in the group finder . 
   the issue that they run into is all the agility classes blow their sustained aoe out of the water, 
  with enough mobs a wl using fire and brimstone will cap every meter . 
  during bc ( no dual spec back then ) one of our guild members had two druids , named the same , just one of them backwards . 
  one was specced heal , the other tank . 
  i contemplated doing the same yesterday after 28 wipes . 
  but we did get to the first feast phase with everyone alive :d . 
  that only depends on how long the mobs live . 
  destro wls can go on indefinitely , as the mana wo n't ever run out , and and with enough mobs you cap on ebers with one aoe incinerate . 
  the aoe incinerate is only for ember generation . 
  what does the damage is the aoe chaos bolt . 
  i do n't think it would take 60 seconds to pull ahead , and , with enough embers beforehand i think even the initial burst would n't be that far off . 
  is there a way to get 36 training dummies ? 
  i 'm curious now . 
  oh , cataclysm , interesting . 
  i 've never seen anybody run that in hfc , and i have to admit i 've not done a lot of cm ( 4/8 gold ) . 
  aoe chaos bolts do burst hard , and with enough targets you can alternate between aoe incinerate and aoe chaos bolt wihtout dropping out of fnb . 
  you 're trying to kill xemirkol , right ? 
  i used the addon [ premade group finder ] ( http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-group-finder ) and set it to scan for groups named * xemirkol * or * predator * . 
  i eventually found someone that had found it , joined the group , used the thing and was there with him . 
   backwards numbers and fucking triangles, 
  top kek, 
  the most burtal thing back then was the pvp gear . 
  someone in full s4 could kill groups of pve geared players , simply due to the way resillience worked back then . 
  pair that with the warlock soul-link build that made them extremely tough to kill and capable of damaging many players at the same time and you have a lot of fun in open world pvp . 
  [ fx file explorer ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx&amp;hl=en ) ( free ) with the paid [ plus upgrade ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx.rk ) supports ftp and even sftp with private key authentication . 
  it 's imho the best file explorer with a very good interface . 
  do n't really like the garisson , it 's gotten a bit better yesterday when the shipyard spewed out a bis mythic trinket with a socket slot . 
  previously i was n't very lucky with the shipyard mission chests ... 
  if you want a ilvl 680 group for mythics , make one . 
  if i want an ilvl 730 group for mythics , i make one . 
  what exactly is the problem here ? 
  on my twinks i also make the groups myself , it 's a lot faster than trying to find a group when you have low ilvl . 
  you have obviously never done tw with a group of tw geared people . 
  all of the tw instances can be facerolled with enough dps , no need to do any interrupting or ccing . 
   triple legendaries, 
  the legendary ring is actually very bad in tw . 
  the ilvl 715 epic ring before the leg is a lot better . 
  the legendary ring active effect gets scaled to 1-1 .5 % extra damage even on a 795 ring , so does the explosion . 
  which 3 legendaries would a player wear then ? 
  weapon , cloak and ? 
  i just read the footnotes as i go . 
  sometimes when the ship of theseus is especially tense i 'll read a few pages of if before i turn back and read the notes . 
  soul swap copies the dots , it does n't remove them . 
  additionally , the debuff is on you , so it does n't matter what you deal damage to , the tank always gets his share . 
  the others failed to note that you can easily log yourself . 
  go to https://www.warcraftlogs.com/ and register an account . 
  then download their uploader tool . 
  in world of warcraft , in the system -  network options turn on ` advanced combat logging ' . 
  this enables more detailed logs . 
  then , when you want to log a fight , just enter ` / combatlog ` in chat . 
  this will generate a file named ` wowcombatlog.txt ` in the ` world of warcraft \\ logs ` directory . 
  logging is disabled when you log out or enter ` / combatlog ` again . 
  you can then upload the logged fight to warcraftlogs using their tool . 
  here is an example of a log ( hellfire council ) : https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/drx9adjzlmhfk4kw#fight=9&amp;type=damage-done, 
  you can see how well each player performed or analyze why you were n't able to kill the boss . 
  you can even watch a replay of the fight using the ` replay ' button . 
  i 'd help , but i 'm on eredar eu , horde . 
  hmm . 
  the best !, 
  is n't that just watered down slide oil ? 
  if you mix oil with water it looks white-ish . 
  i 've been doing \\ # 6 for a while now . 
  imho burger king food is far superior to mcdonalds food . 
  we gave a lot of shits . 
  the gomtv player was one of the biggest pieces of shitty / shady software that i ever intalled anyhere . 
  it 's actually pretty big for a shitty room . 
  my college dorm was smaller . 
  note , this is client side . 
  i just tried putting that option in my sshd config and it would n't eat it . 
  i just skimmed it and saw the advice . 
  idk why but after reading the title it was just in my head that it was a server side exploit , so i did n't even consider putting it anywhere but the sshd config . 
  french use them , too . 
  the automatic wipers in my car are spot on . 
  i like them , they 're similar to the [ vmr v710s ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uowsbgk.jpg ) i got . 
  that type of wheels just seems to suit bmws so well . 
  also go brake more , your rotor is all rusty . 
  laser also has no z in it . 
  inside ? 
  afaik , glacier does n't use tape drives , it uses a [ maid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-raid_drive_architectures#maid ) aka * massive array of idle disks * made of custom low-rpm drives . 
  on request they then move the data to an array of hot drives for download . 
  personal theory here , but maybe the microbes are introcuded in some other way ? 
  could it work if the child ate somd dirty sand or something like that ? 
  oh yes . 
  i 've also stopped using the cheapo airlines that fly you to airports in bumfuck nowhere . 
  the last straw for me was my trip to london from munich . 
  i flew there using monarch , landing in london-louton . 
  the return flight was like 25 $ more , but it was british-airways from heathrow to munich . 
  the rail ticket from louton to kings-cross was about 13 $ iirc . 
  also , ba was much more accomodating , for example they put excess hand luggage into checked baggage for free , monarch billed the unlucky individuals who had 2 pieces instead of one a hefty 60 gbp . 
  also we got a `` meal '' and free drinks on ba , even alcohol . 
  it 's interesting , as it 's one of the few movies shot in super panavision 70 . 
  that is a format closely related to the ultra panavision 70 format that tarantino used for his new hateful eight movie . 
  basically they are very wide 70mm film formats . 
  mundarten ? 
  those are some very nice wheels . 
  my beyerdynamic headphones have a 1/4 plug , but it 's a screwed on adapter . 
  if i had n't read that somewhere i never would have known .
