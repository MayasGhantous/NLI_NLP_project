   jokes on you .

  ftfy, 
  if you wall-mount it you could cut that part out and mount the disc separately , to make it look like it 's floating . 
  you definitely want to play destro in 5-man instances . 
  affliction is useful on some of the bosses in hfc , later on you 'll find yourself switching between aff and destro depending on the bossfight . 
  if you 're interested , i ca n't recommend these two guides for the specs enough :,

  baleful gear actually has a chance to be 695 . 
  for gearing up , [ wowhead ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/guide=3700/gearing-up-for-the-6-2-3-grove-warden-mount-and-heroic-archimonde ) has a nice overview on the different ways to get gear . 
  probably not in the spirit of the thread , but i 've been asked where i got my armored bloodwing many times . 
  most people are kind of disappointed when they learn it 's a shop mount , as was i , but i just really love it 's looks and i 've wanted a bat for my undead wl since forever . 
  finally caved and bought it this christmas when it was on sale . 
  originally only dwarves and humans could be paladins . 
  i use it in pve , before every bossfight there 's a little shuffle to make sure i 'm on absolute max range . 
  this is done so i do n't pre-pull during my opener . 
  it 's actually funny , you can see most destro wls do it before a bossfight , since we precast at about 5 seconds before the pull , relying on the immense travel time of incinerate . 
  you can actually optimize that , by precasting sb : h so that it hits exactly on pull ( start casting haunt ~ 3 sec before pull , stand on max range ) . 
  you then have time to precast unstable affliction so it also hit exactly on pull . 
  then you sb : ss the boss . 
  this makes it so you have a full pandemic duration of unstable affliction on the boss , so you can keep drain-souling slightly longer in the initial burst phase . 
  refer to [ astrothug 's awesome affliction guide ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1828134-6-2-3-affliction-warlock-guide ) . 
  you can actually optimize that further by also precasting an unstable affliction so you 'll have a full pandemic duration of that , see my [ above comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/41mdc0/should_i_apply_haunt_first_or_after_i_apply_my/cz3uxoz ) and [ astrothug 's aff guide ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1828134-6-2-3-affliction-warlock-guide ) . 
  this usually happens if multiple people apply at the same time . 
  once you have a tank and a heal you often get about 5 dps applying at the same time . 
  once you accept 2 of them the others see it as refused . 
  i 've been refused several times myself and my application ilvl is 734 . 
  nowadays i mostly make the groups myself . 
  hit it , it stacks . 
  usually the ring will also be used with bloodlust , and you will use your doomguard . 
  that way you will get as much damage in the ring as you can . 
  i like to make sure i have haunting spirits up freshly right before bl or refresh it right as the ring is used , and then i like to dump all my remaining soul shards into the ring with haunt . 
  during bl and dark soul you will usually get back those soul shards pretty quickly . 
  yes , i keep 2 shards for when i need to refresh haunting spirits . 
  all above 2 is fair game for pushing dps . 
  you still might want to hold on to that 3rd shard and use it when you have a trinket / enchant proc etc. 
  when you hit 4 shards you generally just dump a haunt it , so no nightfall proc is wasted . 
  exceptions would be stuff like iron reaver , you can consider stacking up to 4 shards for when he comes down , so you can quickly reapply everything . 
  on multi target fights you can use excess shards to apply haunt to multiple targets . 
  and if you have 4pc t18 bonus and dark soul is up you can refresh that haunt using drain soul . 
  you generally do n't have haunt up all the time , since you do n't have enough soul shards and you do n't have ds up all the time . 
  but with t18 4pc you will have haunt up on at least your primary target all through ds . 
  no , as of 6.2.3 it can actually drop at any ilvl between and including 650 and 695 in 5 ilvl increments . 
  you can use an empowered apexis fragment to upgrade any baleful directly to 695 , but if you 're lucky you do n't have to . 
  see for example [ in this wowhead article ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/guide=3700/gearing-up-for-the-6-2-3-grove-warden-mount-and-heroic-archimonde#baleful-tanaan-jungle-loot-650-705 ) :, 
   however , new to 6.2.3 , baleful tanaan loot can start off at any ilvl between 650 and 695 , in increments of +5 ilvls . 
  the chance to get a particular ilvl decreases as the ilvl increases -- getting an ilvl 695 item will be rare . 
  i have gotten a 690 myself , several people in my guild got direct 695 items , also , there was a thread here where some guy opened like 200 and counted the results , he also got one 695 . 
  just because you did n't get one does n't mean it does n't exist . 
  edit : [ found the thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3t88zd/i_used_164_baleful_tokens_after_the_patch_heres_a/cx4j0dd ) . 
  these exist . 
  they make a thin sheet of ice and shred it as you push the button . 
  these exist . 
  they form a thin sheet that is pushed into a shredder as you press the button . 
  they can produce that as fast as it 's fed into the shredder . 
  if you are into software development i recommend you do the same thing i did , and version your interface and wtf folders using git . 
  that way i can revert back not only my installed addons but also all the changed settings should an addon version upgrade go awry . 
  you can also install certain wow addons that offer a git repo as submodules and update them automatically , for example elvui . 
  is it known what that floating skull is that demo warlocks get ? 
  i 'm a wl and i 've been building a set as well . 
  for a cloak , i 'm pretty sure you can buy one that has mastery / crit and a red socket in og . 
  other than that , be sure to get a helmet that fits a meta gem . 
  also , use the ilvl 715 pre-legendary ring instead of the legendary , as the legendary ring only amplifies your damage by about 1 % in timewalking . 
  you 'll also need a trinket , there is one that has static mastery and on-use intellect which i macro 'd to my dark soul . 
  for the other trinket i use the desecrated shadowmoon insignia , which is also static mastery and has an int proc . 
  which spec do you want to play ? 
  i 've heard demonology is actually good in timewalks , but i do n't want to respec so i 'll stay destro there . 
  i meant lore-wise . 
  does that thing have a name ? 
  a history ? 
  edit : found it , it 's the [ skull of the man ` ari ] ( http://legion.wowhead.com/item=128943/skull-of-the-manari&amp;bonus=0 ) . 
  for trinkets i use [ soul casket ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=58183/soul-casket ) and [ desecrated shadowmoon insignia ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=124228/desecrated-shadowmoon-insignia&amp;bonus=566 ) . 
  i got a lot of advice from [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3w7t4s/timewalk_minmaxing_bis_gear_broken_gear/ ) i created a while ago , especially [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3w7t4s/timewalk_minmaxing_bis_gear_broken_gear/cxvdx6k ) . 
  i ca n't find the cape right now , i 'll update this once i get home . 
  for weapon i currently use some mastery staff with one socket from firelands , but i 'll have to see if the current stage of the legendary staff i have might actually be better . 
  always go big dick . 
  always do as much dps as you possibly can . 
  pre-pot on trash pulls in random heroics ? 
  do n't mind if i do . 
  found the cape , it 's [ nanoprecise cape ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=77098/nanoprecise-cape ) sold by [ jamus ` vaz ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46556/jamusvaz ) . 
  german here . 
  street view is allowed and rolled out in some cities , but then a law was passed that allowed everyone to request their home / building to be removed from the pictures . 
  google then processed all those requests for the existing street view areas and probably decided not to bother with capturing anything else . 
  ich werde mir wohl dieses system installieren : http://www.amazon.de/blackvue-dr650gw-2ch-autokamera-dashcam-dash-cam/dp/b00mgmljzk/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1453229602&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=blackvue, 
  the on in the picture obviously needs service ... 
  rhinestone eyes is also very good . 
  aww yes , finally a place to circlejerk over my beyerdynamics , my mechs and uni kuru toga roulette pencils . 
  eidt : oh , they are talking about fountain pens , not mechanical pencial . 
  i got a lamy fountain pen as well :d, 
  does mnet still to the idiotic 100mb/s down stream but only like 5mb/s upstream thing most german isps seem to love ? 
  i 'll switch to a fiber provider once i can get a reasonably priced 100/100 or even better a gigabit connection . 
  i 'm on congstar 50/10 as well . 
  the problem with youtube can easily be fixed by circumventing telekom 's content delivery network . 
  you can do that easily and for free by setting up a ipv6 tunnel , for example with [ hurricane electric ] ( https://tunnelbroker.net/ ) or [ sixxs ] ( https://www.sixxs.net/main/ ) . 
  what i like about congstar is that they do n't force you to use their own modem , they provide you with the pppoe credentials and offer to sell you a fritz box at a nicely reduced price point . 
  i have heard very good things about them , especially their customer support . 
  i had o2 for a while here , and during that time the provided o2 box router died 3 times and had to be replaced each time . 
  it does not like it when you max out the internal switch for an hour , it becomes really hot and dies a while later . 
  also , setting up anything like port forwarding with that router is a royal pita .
