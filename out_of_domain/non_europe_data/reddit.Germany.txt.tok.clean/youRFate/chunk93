   especially , since you can not get anything like that if you are living outside of the larger cities . 
  meh , my parents live in a 3000 people village and have 100/10 from one of the cable providers , and that 's around 35 $ . 
  i especially do n't get why they 're doing it with fiber . 
  afaik peering is less expensive if you have balanced inbound / outbound traffic as oppsed to heavy inbound traffic as those isps sure have due to those speeds . 
  according to the wiki article , it does sell a lot when it 's on the menu , but it 's profit margin is very low compared to other products . 
  well , except for the gold snoopy award of course . 
  gogs is really nice , runs well on my raspberry pi . 
  or when the logo freezes shut . 
  well , it 's technically correct . 
  the 1893 * benz patent-motorwagen victoria * , which is bascially the 4th itteration of the first car in the world , did have a reverse gear . 
  the ford model t , which was introduced in 1908 also had a reverse gear . 
  i installed it from aur , yaourt did everything automatically . 
  i think all i had to do was change the pkgbuild so it built on the armv7h architecture . 
  i would n't even limit mode of propulsion . 
  just get some sort of check point system that they have to go through and make it so they need to stay above the road at like maximum 1m distance . 
  i really love arch on the pi . 
  love it . 
  * atem * is german for `` breath '' . 
  just thought i 'd let you know . 
  the takeshi kovacs books by richard k. morgan have a terrifying adaption to that . 
  in those books , the human mind can be transfered from body to body electronically , i.e. 
  if you die your memories , personality etc. 
  are transfered into a new body . 
  this is done using an electronic storage device implanted in the neck / base of skull called the stack . 
  however , you can also load someone into a virtual world . 
  there you can torture them over and over , and that at an accelerated rate . 
  so in 5 mintures real time you can torture someone for months on end in virtuality . 
  pens , keyboards and headphones , so / r/mechanicalheadpens is the perfect sub for me !, 
  yo mama jokes . 
  they were incredibly popular here in germany , although we have a somewhat different format . 
  my favorites :, 
  * / yo mama if armwrestling for returnable bottles behind aldi . 
  * / yo mama pushes childern off their bikes and smells the saddles . 
  * / your mom falls in love on parship every 11 minutes . 
  ( parship is a dating site that advertises with the slogan ` every 11 mintues a single falls in love on parship ' . ), 
  if you find yourself do that often , have a look at [ mp3fs ] ( https://khenriks.github.io/mp3fs/ ) . 
  it 's a fuse filesystem that you can mount and you 'll see all your flac files as mp3 . 
  then , when you access a file it 's converted on the fly . 
  i had something similar . 
  i was driving at night , it was foggy , and i came to a large intersection , but the system seems to have malfunctioned , as all the lights were flashing yellow . 
  i approached carfully , there was no other car in sight , but i wanted to have a close look before crossing . 
  at that moment i noticed that my music was perfectly in sync with the flashing street lights , i had my perfect little midnight rave . 
  you do need a * nix system for that to work , though . 
  there is no fuse for windows . 
  however , if you 're like me and you have your music on some kind of network storage then that is surely * nix based . 
  i 'd write that on the note . 
  i do n't really like btrfs . 
  my next storage build will use zfs , for the nice snapshoting features . 
  if you like mp3fs , there is also one for rar / zip files called rar2fs . 
  it shows all compressed files as uncompressed , and when you access them it uncompresses on the fly . 
  even works for multipart archives . 
  do n't run an av on your phone . 
  that said , do n't run an av on anything , it 's all snake oil . 
  for long term stable systems like a nas i prefer freebsd , which , coincidentally , natively supports zfs . 
   be warned , fellow master racers !, 
  do n't buy from razer ~ ~ if you expect the warranty to be honored . ~ ~, 
  ftfy, 
  i watch a ton of stuff while playing wow . 
  those books are really great with a great pacing . 
  go buy the first one , you 've got nothing to lose but so much to gain . 
  the first one is called altered carbon . 
  have fun !, 
  what ? 
  why have i not been informed ? 
  that is just on the surface . 
  it will go away as soon as you brake once from moderate speed . 
  do n't worry about it , it 's perfectly normal once the car stood for like a week . 
  [ never forget ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ ), 
  wow , so garish . 
  i started equiping my shaman for enhancement . 
  it 's incredibly fun . 
  compared to my pve warlock i have a lot more buttons to press , but i 'm starting to handle it well , using tons of macros :d . 
  tic tac toe is solved . 
  you ca n't lose if you start and follow the optimal strategy . 
  refer to [ this chart ] ( https://xkcd.com/832/ ) . 
  my favorite scene is when [ they are in the power station and realize that one of the high voltage lines is just going in a circle , leading nowhere , but the staff there just accepts that whichout questioning it . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  even better is concrete architecture in grey weather . 
  yay brutalism . 
  there 's always / r/books . 
  oh , interesting , he uses flat versatility and haste procs . 
  thanks for that !, 
  yet daggers and fist weapons still ca n't be x-mogged ... 
  i remember i also struggled with it when i freshly hit 100 . 
  but destro is so much about knowing when to keep embers , when to build them and when to dump and on whom . 
  also proper havoc and shadowburn usage . 
  i did it again at some point just to see if it truly was hard , and it 's a breeze now . 
  he probably bought it because the legendary ring is really bad in timewalking , sincie it scales to about 1 % extra damage . 
  the ilvl715 version however works fine and is a very good ring with the flat int proc . 
  it took me way longer to become good at destro than it did with affliction . 
  imho you need to play a lot of destro to get a real good feel for the embers and havoc . 
  [ this guide ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1731435-6-2-furty-s-destruction-warlock-guide ) is probably one of the best guides there is for destro , helped me a lot . 
  [ and here ] ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1828134-6-2-3-affliction-warlock-guide ) is the equivalent for affliction . 
  i know , i specifically did n't write `` you always win '' . 
  i 'm not norwegian , i 'm german . 
  you could probably have used the item recovery function , right ? 
  viral marketing for narcos ? 
  i do n't know where i heard this analogy but i love it :, 
   saying global warming does n't exist because it 's cold right now is like denying that the titanic is sinking just because the side you 're on right now is currently 500 ft in the air . 
  or something along those lines .
