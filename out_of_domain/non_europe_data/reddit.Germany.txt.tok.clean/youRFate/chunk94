  meh , i felt the same way , but then i had a looked in the statistics , and the bg win rate was damn near 50 % . 
  there are stairs in the picture ... 
  the tiny portion actually does n't matter for gif , as the full image is stored for each frame , reagardless which content changes . 
  in video formats like gifv cool stuff is done like only storing the parts of a frame that changed . 
  well , [ minidisc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minidisc ) did it and they were awesome . 
  i know , gifv depends on implementation , but it usually detects the browser support and uses webm or mp4 . 
  the vp9 coding format used in webm is actually pretty good and can compete with h. 264 in terms of quality depending on settings , but is usually more tuned to filesize . 
  the older vp8 that 's somtimes used is worse than h. 264 in terms of the size/quality relation . 
  interesting , i did n't know gif could do anything other than just store a series of full images . 
  maybe the gifv wrapper on imgur detects that the gif is already very small and does n't bother transcoding it to webm/mp4 . 
  i play in a concert band and we sometimes play at funerals of ex members or supporters . 
  that song is used often , along with schubert 's ave maria . 
  those two songs alone have probably created many galons of tears ... 
  i know , that is cool as well . 
  still , it 's a disc in a protective enclosure , the same could have been done for cds or dvds . 
  yes , you chew them until you sucked all the honey out , then you spit out the ball of beeswax . 
  it 's delicious . 
  mach ein reichtangle draus . 
  trailer park boys . 
  julian would probably send cory and trevor though ... 
  vici , not vice . 
  unless it 's a reference i do n't get . 
  that would be true for a true video compression algorithm . 
  with gifs however this is usually ^ 1 not true , as they store each frame individually as a full image , not doing any correlation between frames . 
  1 exept in a special mode which / u/openglados mentiond [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/42r2co/bet_you_cant/czchlg8 ) . 
  sachse detected . 
  need more despressing beautiful music ? 
  listen to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bosoux_d8y ) . 
  druid and shaman is also good , druids can fly and shamans are invisible and as fast as mount in ghost wolf if they use the book . 
  also shamans can walk on water . 
  ! link me : 500 firepaper, 
  app that automatically download wallpapers from the photography community 500px . 
  you can set categories and it will load top photographs from those categories . 
  at least on mythic imho iron reaver is the hardest boss until gorefiend . 
  you can also do just / pull with dbm now . 
  get the bad pets addon . 
  the addon is also nice for tanks , it will whisper anyone who 's pet has a taunt on to remind them to turn it off . 
  yes , you need [ book of flight form ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=114842/book-of-flight-form ) that drops from elites in ashran . 
  h\u00e4lt super . 
  since it 's an older generation , the i does have quite a bit more power than the d does . 
  when buying the diesel , the models from 3/2003 on have about 20 more horesepower and about 20 nm more torque . 
  the full version is called [ full tilt !, 
  pinball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_tilt!_pinball ) . 
  during a school exam here we all had to lay our casio graphical calculators in front of us , back side up , and the teacher went through the ranks with a pen and pressed all of the `` reset '' buttons on the back of the calculators . 
  problem with that is , when you then flip the calculator around it says in the display `` do you really want to reset all data ? 
  yes/no '' . 
  you hit no and you 're gucci . 
  once you overgear archi hc you can tunnel him just fine . 
  did a pug archi ring upgrade on hc and we had 2 affliction wls just tunneling the boss for a quicker fight . 
  average item level of the group was 732 . 
  mmmh , proper page construction that actually leaves room for something like that . 
  xbox 360 controllers also have 2 vibration motors .

  maybe it 's scruff of the neck is somehow pinched making it go limp . 
  the concept of measuring heart rate using the camera is nothing new , there have been apps that do this for several years . 
  that 's nothing new , my old car built in '97 had that . 
  it seems there is not much progress on the smart wiper market ... 
  fasching is coming , with all it 's glory and all it 's horror . 
  the 8800 was soo good . 
  i built my new pc around that time , however , i went with an ati x1950 xtx . 
  luckily that card died within the first 2 weeks , i sent it back and got a full cash refund . 
  with that i bought an 8800 that had come out that week , could n't have been happier . 
  the title is `` kid 's carnival is war ! '' . 
  it plays it on the fact that the picture resembles a war zone , with a shell-shocked soldier ( toddler in bee costume ) looking over the scene . 
  this theme is expanded upon by user / u/gifnarr in his brilliant photoshop : http://i.imgur.com/5ysbksn.jpg, 
  i 've been using these for about 4 years now . 
  i started with the plastic version and got a metal one when it came out . 
  i got them from a seller directly from japan , i think they were about 5 $ each . 
  make sure to get a good lead was well , [ the nano dia lead by uni ] ( http://www.amazon.com/strength--uni-ball-0-5mm-hb--original-description/dp/b00u6uqk7q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1454503284&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=nano+dia ) is my current favorite . 
  as for erasers , i really like the [ boxy erasers ] ( http://www.amazon.com/mitsubishi-boxy-black-eraser-ep-60bx/dp/b01525yfxk/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1454503326&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=boxy+eraser ) also by uni . 
  all of these seem very expensive on us amazon , i 'm in europe and i got them shipped from asia with free shipping for a lot less than half those prices ... 
  i noticed that when you draw longer lines with the kuru toga pencils that kind of defeats their purpose , as they only rotate when you set them down . 
  if you draw long enough lines without lifting it it will also become dull . 
  i really love them for doing math since it 's all so clear , legible and easy to correct mistakes . 
  for writing text i usually use my fountain pen . 
  rwd in the snow is really fun , as long as you have good tires . 
  here in germany snow tires are mandantory in winter . 
  i 'm running continental winter contact , and i really like them . 
  get regular tires for the summer . 
  if it does get snow in your area get a separate set of winter tires , a/s tires suck both in winter and summer . 
  the michelin tires are very good , but they do n't last that long since they are kind of soft . 
  i personally run dunlop sport maxx in summer and continental winter contact in winter . 
  as i 've said , they are fairly soft which is why they have such a good grip . 
  they will probably be gone at 30k miles so you 'll need to buy new ones at that point regardless . 
  that should n't smell like anything . 
  get your ac cleaned . 
  ac should n't smell like anything . 
  get the condenser cleaned , mybe it 's drain pipe is clogged . 
  badger smells not that great tbh . 
  i got a badger hair shaving brush and at first when you get it wet it smells overpoweringly . 
  you have to soak it in lather and let it dry several times , then it smells amazing . 
  ugh , my paypal account is a list of pizza deliveries at this point . 
  i 've managed to tone it down to once a week though . 
  i do admit i like their products a lot , but i 'm not asociated with them in any way . 
  were they forged or cast wheels ? 
  ah , very similar . 
  it seems usefull . 
  that said , since i started using a mild screw adhesive when mounting the bindings i 've not had any more problems with it becoming loose . 
  it 's not . 
  you have to place the piece on top of top of the tower .
