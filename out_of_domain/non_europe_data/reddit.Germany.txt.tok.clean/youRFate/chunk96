  is it meant for smuggling , as it is somewhat armed ? 
  edit : oops , just rememberd it 's for fuel and refining . 
  disregard this post . 
  good job , you fail at being born . 
  oh , did n't know that . 
  might have to switch to de cecco then . 
  at the very least their wiki page does n't have a `` controversy '' section . 
  just started that one a few days ago . 
  oh , i see you went for the `` spoiled milk '' colour option . 
  hang in there and enjoy the ride , at least it sounds great . 
  not hating on your taste , just curious , but why do most americans seem to love black grilles ? 
  is it because chrome is more associated with older cars / muscle cars there ? 
  like , does the chrome look `` dated '' to you , or less aggressive ? 
  i personally love the chrome around the grille on bmws . 
  not really the size of cities . 
  assuming a top current microachitecture like the qualcomm kryo , which uses structures down to 14nm in size . 
  the human eye can see structures as small as 0.1 mm . 
  this gives us a scaling factor of 7142.8 . 
  assuming the device is about 6 inches in diagonal we get a new diagonal size of 42 857.1 inches , or about 0.7 miles . 
  why do you assume a 10 ^ 8 scaling factor ? 
  see my [ post here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/45bkhi/whats_something_we_take_for_granted_every_day/czx8uch ) for my assumptions . 
  what year was that and where ? 
  my brother b/w laser printer has been nothing but fantastic so far . 
  low printing cost , network and duplex printing , and a small , unobtrusive , no-bullshit driver . 
  it also fits about a full ream of paper , so i do n't have to constantly refill paper . 
  google has the reminder portion built into android and it works very nicely . 
  for phone functions i use tasker , for example mute phone when at university , turn on bluetooth when i leave home . 
  oh , i had that . 
  we usually added additional books to peoples bags . 
  one classroom had a closet full of heavy atlases . 
  we packed peoples backpacks and gym bags . 
  many only noticed it when they changed before pe , so there was a big stack of atlases in the locker rooms as well . 
  also , in one of the art rooms there was a big pile of rocks , part of some art installation . 
  many of those also went into people packs when they were n't paying attention . 
  my favorite part about the art room was the etching press . 
  it 's this big metal roller press with a moving table . 
  we would steal other peoples lunch and put it tough the press at a very thin setting , thereby creating somewhat pizza like substances from sandwiches . 
  germany here . 
  first of all , only the priest gets wine here . 
  but that wine is real wine . 
  lies [ diesen ] ( https://www.gq.com/story/the-last-true-hermit ) artikel !, 
  i 'm talking about the roman-catholic mass , not the lutherian curch . 
  during mass you only receive sacramental bread , but no wine . 
  the priest does his whole spiel with the wine and bread , and drinks from the wine . 
  the wine used has to be real wine , see [ this wiki section ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sacramental_wine#catholic_church_norms ) . 
  i 've head the lutherian protestant churches sometimes use grape juice as a substitue though . 
  idk , i just copied what / u/kingofeggsandwiches wrote . 
  meh , i do n't like their phones , but their ssds and monitors are ok . 
   magst du sausage parties ? 
  hehe, 
  do n't judge , 
  make one wheel a different color . 
  like orange or pink . 
  that means they are shadowbanned . 
  get one foot out of the binding , stand in the start area in line with the lift , the free foot on the pad . 
  grab the bar , put one end in between your legs and hold onto the thing with both hands . 
  then just let it pull you , keep your board flat and let it do it 's thing . 
  then , while the bar digs into your thigh making the ride uncomfortable , contemplate why you did n't go to a resort that only uses chair lifts . 
  i prefer to take one foot out , since it gives me more flexibility while waiting in line and when getting out of the lift . 
  that point was mostly meant as a joke , there are many smaller resorts that only have surface lifts , but are still fun to ride at . 
  also , those are usually cheaper . 
  if the wheels turn in the direction the arros indicate that car would go backwards . 
  this bothers me somewhat . 
  other than than i love it . 
  my first car had 64 . 
   hdfdg, 
  [ serfauss , fiss and ladis ] ( https://www.serfaus-fiss-ladis.at/en ) are all very nice , connected to an extremely nice resort . 
  see [ this ski map ] ( https://www.serfaus-fiss-ladis.at/pdf/pistenplan-en.pdf ) for details . 
  [ kitzb\u00fchel ] ( https://www.kitzbuehel.com/en ) is also very nice , but somewhat more expensive than serfauss / fiss / ladis . 
  in switzerland i 've been to [ tschuggen ] ( http://www.tschuggen-belalp.ch/ ) , part of the [ blatten belalp ] ( http://www.belalp.ch/en/ ) resort , which is a village half way up the mountain , located at the middle station of the cable car . 
  the resort is smaller than the two austrian resorts i linked , but should still be enough for beginners . 
  dolomites are a very nice region . 
  with the [ dolomiti superski pass ] ( http://www.dolomitisuperski.com/en/ski-area/dolomiti-superski ) you 'll have access to all the connected resorts giving you 1200 km ( 745 miles ) of groomed slopes . 
  i 've been there about 4 weeks total , and it is one of my favorite skiing areas in the alps . 
  for loding i 'd suggest [ wolkenstein ] ( http://www.valgardena.it/en/val-gardena/villages/selva-gardena/ ) , [ canazei ] ( http://www.fassa.com/en/canazei-alba-penia/ ) , [ corvara ] ( http://www.altabadia.org/en/italian-alps-dolomites/villages/corvara.html ) or [ arabba ] ( http://www.arabba.it/en/home/1-0.html ) . 
  if you have any more question about resorts in the alps , i 've posted some more recommendations [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/4644vc/most_picturesque_and_quaint_ski_village_in_europe/d04e821 ) or just ask , i have been to most of the big resorts in the alps , as i live close by . 
  when walking home alone , drunk , at night , i sometimes run instead of walking , if nobody is watching . 
  i should develop an app that you take a photo of a crowd of people with , it then checks every face against facebook 's database and labels each person with age and relation ship status . 
  for a premium fee you 'll get the names and profile links . 
  only problem would be to get facebook to cooperate . 
  [ this episode of the 99 % invisible podcast covers it nicely ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/best-enjoyed-by/ ) . 
  wow i would die working there . 
  babies are annoying as fuck if they are n't yours . 
   painful semiannual follow-up treatments with your docto, 
  my dentist visits have only been somewhat painful once , and that was when i got my wisdom teeth removed . 
  might also be about the m4 gts . 
  i guess many real cheeses would just dry out if sliced and left out in the open . 
  some irrelevant youtuber that caused a minor youtube stirrup when he had some kind of flame war with h3h3 productions ( antoher youtuber ) . 
  the only thing that really came out of it is the phrase `` xxx is playing chess while yyy is stuck on checkers '' . 
  actually they work like garbage trucks . 
  you build a snow depot and the trucks do the rest autonomously . 
  romania has 20 % vat , germany has 19 % . 
  the differenct is n't that big ... 
  getting slapped ? 
  deck that bitch . 
  problem solved . 
  this high five was brought to you from the offices of arcsine , an architecture and int\u00e9rieurs firm in beautiful , downtown oakland california . 
  it asked me about a year ago if i was interested in books where i could change the outcome of the story . 
  recently they announced special interactive books for smartphones : http://theprimeversion.com/google-is-publishing-unprintable-fictional-books/, 
  google truffle finder app incoming , calling it now .
