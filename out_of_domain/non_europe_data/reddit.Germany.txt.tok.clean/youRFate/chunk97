  same . 
  what i like about trams is that you can have them go on roads through the neighborhood , then leave the road and directly cross to other districts , avoiding traffic-plagued interconnects . 
  had to build like 5 of those by hand yesterday . 
  thanks !, 
  do you know if there is a way to get a one-way tram on a two way street ? 
  i 'd like to build a one way loop for turning on a two way residential road . 
  very nice . 
  i enjoy the cozy atmosphere and the feeling of it being in some hidden cellar . 
  the only critique i have is the candles around the symbol , they look like they are floating . 
  they do n't have shadows and are n't interacting with the ground in any way . 
  they do n't cast light either , especially compared to the candles on the wall . 
  they sort of look like a pasted-in afterthought . 
  according to wikipedia they are tentacles . 
  do n't down vote him , he 's right . 
  that girl is flat af . 
  i 'd say 3 rings is enough . 
  what is there in ring 4 that could interest tourists ? 
  hmm do n't see any camber there ... 
  [st.suckless.org ] ( http://st.suckless.org/ ) . 
  ancient ? 
  the 360 is n't that old , newfag . 
  that was so sad to wach , i feel really sorry for him somehow . 
  it 's black and white laser , so not that expensive . 
  it 's on both sides , too , since it 's a duplex printer . 
  oops , i had a quick look at the sidebar but did n't spot the rules button . 
  well , will probably be removed then . 
  also , shoutout to the awesome character sheets from [ minotaur.cc ] ( http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/ ) . 
  provided your printer does n't fuck up they are the nicest character sheets i 've used so far .

  up\u00df . 
   if the initiative rolls are done correctly, 
  anything special to consider in that regard ? 
  the only times i 've used vital strike is when i did have to move during combat which was n't often or when the enemy had very high damage reduction and my normal attacks did n't really damage it . 
  one more thing : the wolf , being large , will have a pretty good chance of tripping enemies it attacks . 
  is n't that sort of a disadvantage for me as a range player as the enemy gains a +4 bonus to ac that way ? 
  can i circumvent that ? 
  right , good call . 
  so the wolf would be better off supporting our melees . 
  yes , i 'd argue that a wolf would always trip an enemy if it can , as it is very advantageous to it 's own attacks . 
  something else , i 've just read the [ page on natural weapons ] ( http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#toc-natural-attacks ) . 
  the wolf only has one attack ( bite , 1d8 ) . 
  as such , i should apply 1.5 x it 's strength modifier to it , right ? 
  it 's formated a bit weirdly on the page as 1-1/2 . 
  oooh , that 's nice . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll keep that in mind for next time i gain a feat . 
  ok . that will go down to 1x str on level 9 , as the wolf then gains multiattack and therefore gains a secondary natural attack , right ? 
  ok , that 's strong . 
  the wolf has 24 str ( 13 natrually , +2 from animal companion , +8 from being large and +1 from the stat increase on lvl 4 ) , so that 's +10 on damage rolls . 
  far shot was actually really useful in our last encounter , as we set up our ranged camp more than 300ft . 
  away . 
  i 'll probably get clustered shot as my next feat . 
  i also do n't want to completely rebuild my character all the time . 
  it 's a weighing station in a produce department . 
  you put on your produce , press the correct button and a sticky label with your price comes out . 
  that is exactly why we ca n't have nice things . 
  we had something like this on the road that lead to a part of campus , right past the caf\u00e9teria . 
  we sat there watchting about 15 cars crash . 
  it was slippery af and went downhill . 
  we tried to walk up but it was n't even possible on foot . 
  a audi quattro tried to get up , but after the inital momentum ran out he slowly slid back down , all 4 wheels spinning . 
  it was afterwards determined that the city had to pay for all the accidents there , since it negleted it 's road maintenance duty . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  the [ wikipedia article about that light house ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigeon_point_lighthouse ) reads very strangely . 
  for one , they have written all the numbers in the text as words followed by numbers in parentheses . 
  also the parts about the event where the original lens was lit were reworded kind of strangely . 
  also , there is an exclamation point in the text :, 
   the walkways are severely rusted , as are the major binding ring bands at the base of the tower !, 
  which is very weird for an encyclopedia entry . 
  nice try . 
  i had a thread yesterday about my ranger and animal companion . 
  you can find it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pathfinder_rpg/comments/470lqh/ranger_advice_which_feat_to_sacrifice_for_boon/ ) and there is probably some useful information there that you could also use . 
  that 's an urban legend . 
  every recycling company website ever lists pizza boxes as recyclable . 
  it 's a thing . 
  here in germany it 's called * korea * . 
  when we were in rome during high school we drank loads of it . 
  we bought those 2-3l ( ~ 100 fl.oz . ), 
  cheap merlot bottles , went to mc donalds and got the biggest coke available , drank half and filled it back up with merlot . 
  then we would usually chill on the [ spanish steppes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_steps ) with hundrets of other 16-20 y.o. 
  tourists . 
  holy shit , how did n't his parents kick his teeth in for screaming like that ? 
  usually a full loaf is a bit much for me . 
  i start eating in the middle , so i can push the halves back together so it does n't go stale as fast . 
  usually it does go stale before i reach the heels , so yes , i usually do n't eat them . 
  and yes , i know i could freeze half of it , but i do n't want to go through the hassle of thawing bread when i just want a quick slice for something . 
  edit : i should add that i 'm talking about sour-dough brown bread , not your american white bread stuff . 
  delivery pizza .

  i wonder what message is encoded in the window pattern ... 
  ** s t a n c e n a t i o n **, 
  go to your kitchen , get a tea spoon , fill it with olive oil , eat it . 
  that is something that i 'd generally recommend you do with everything that you use in cooking . 
  you ca n't balance flavors if you do n't know how they taste individually . 
  i know the end of the youtube link by heart . 
  is that natalie dormer or am i drunk ? 
  berlin lies north of london . 
  when crossing from the atlantic to the pacific in the panama canal you go from west to east . 
  i recently had a revelation when i realized that the first thing to get thrown in a new trashbag from a new roll of trashbags is always the packaging of said roll of trashbags . 
  i find that somewhat relevant to your shredder story .
