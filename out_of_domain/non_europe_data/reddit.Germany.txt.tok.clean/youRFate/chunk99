  when i read a book i sort of have a imaginative movie running in my head , i do n't really see the book anymore . 
  [ dieses video ] ( https://youtu.be/kv7na02lfqs ) zeigt den kompletten prozess . 
  when i started college i bought a brother hl 2250dn black/white laser printer . 
  best investment ever . 
  it 's a network printer with a duplexer unit and it just works . 
  a replacement toner for 5600 pages is 15 $ . 
  it 's an older model . 
  just search `` brother black white laser '' or similar on amazon and see what the new models are . 
  really ? 
  i enjoyed his smugness very much . 
  the two characters are kinda of dumb for trying to get an isda without researching the required capital first . 
  i thought once a block touches the table or floor you lost ? 
  how is it even allowed to have anything like that on your vehicle ? 
  does n't it completely fuck up pedestrian crash safety ? 
  that 's what you get for measuring in cups . 
  nice . 
  do the new [ munich trams ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/baureihe_t_backside_%28retouched%29.jpg ) next pls  . 
  it 's a siemens avenio . 
  measure everything in liters / milliliters / deciliters ? 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cup_ ( unit ) for conversion factors . 
  i have actually read the whole manual of my car . 
  learned a few interesting things . 
  temporary art instalation . 
  schaut den avatar an , troll much ? 
  there should be one set of cutlery per course . 
  this is sub-standart . 
  his city is called stormwind fallacy ... 
  tupperware does n't melt in the microwave . 
  what are those front skirts ? 
  ah , so you placed your artisan good machines in your barns ? 
  nice idea !, 
  do you know if they stay there when you upgrade the barn ? 
  also very annoying is when you picked up the eggs and then want to get hay from the dispenser to feed them . 
  `` do you want to eat this egg ? '', 
  not i do n't want to eat that egg , fuck you . 
  could you put one of those in the greenhouse ? 
  have you tried the beta version ? 
  i think removing ghost trees was in the patch notes . 
  they should allow you to plant sugar beets and refine them into sugar . 
  do stone walls still deteriorate ? 
  i wanted to build my coop and cleared the ground there , but my cat decided to take a nap there so i could n't built it . 
  had to go back and shoo away the cat before i could place the coop . 
  any source / confirmation on this ? 
  different question : i seems like grass was more likely to produce hay in fall than in summer . 
  can anyone confirm that ? 
  x-post from / r/de . 
  the small subtext reads `` the 30 years before that were somewhat boring '' . 
  ich habs mal ins / r/bmw subreddit kreuzpfostiert : https://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/49cuzk/in_light_of_bmws_100_years_anniversary_today/, 
  op asked for new apps . 
  i love pocket casts , but it 's by no means even remotely new . 
  i love the sneaky little `` but we are 30 years older '' subtext . 
  i had it open all fall , my chicken are at about 2-3 hearts and have produced eggs most days . 
  i know , i posted the actual translation in [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/49cuzk/in_light_of_bmws_100_years_anniversary_today/d0qr5o3 ) . 
  i have literally just uploaded it to another thread , see it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/49d8mn/more_congratulations_to_bmw_this_time_from_porsche/ ) . 
  translation :, 
   ** the future presents us with large challenges . 
  we face them with driving pleasure . 
   porsche bows to 100 years of moving automotive history and congratulates bmw cordially . 
  [ pfost auf / r/bmw ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bmw/comments/49d8mn/more_congratulations_to_bmw_this_time_from_porsche/ ) . 
  damn , should have gone . 
  maybe should have gone there after work . 
  i posted that joke to reddit , about a year ago . 
  see [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2fhjte/this_is_a_bmw_i8_it_looks_like_its_trying_to_shit/ ) . 
  i 've already posted that . 
  the title is :, 
   ** thank you for 100 years of competition . 
  the subtext reads, 
   the 30 years before that were somewhat boring .

  der hat seine angel falschrum ... 
  if you go there be sure to take a selfie and post it to reddit , like the guy that went to that restaurant in switzerland . 
  the only proper way . 
  i guess it would also catch a lot of hair that would usually just go down the drain without getting stuck . 
  probably also has to move the horse , right ? 
  where do you live if i may ask ? 
  someone never having been on a train is very weird to me . 
  yes , but when moving the coop you have to reset the home location of all the animals in it as well . 
  i 'd wager you have to do that for the horse so it know where to be reset to . 
  you could always put it in window mode for that . 
  i guess / u/concernedape probably did n't initialize the random number generator correctly ? 
  that 's something that should be easily fixable by generating better random numbers . 
  in music class we had to do a presentation on well known jazz/blues musicians . 
  a buddy of mine got assigned b.b. 
  king . 
  he wrote a fake article about him on stupidedia.org ( unfunny germany fake wikipedia ) . 
  then he based his presentation off of that and presented it in music class , citing the website as the source . 
  the presentation started out with `` b.b. 
  king was a plumber in atlantis and was the reason the city is now sunk '' . 
  the whole class was laughing their asses off . 
  the teacher had a look at the fake wiki page and remarked `` it 's called stupidedia , stupid is english for `` dumm '' , that page is not to be trustes as a source . '', 
  he got to redo his presentation . 
  i would n't store it at all , i 'd generate the loot when the geode is opened , using good random numbers . 
  what 's `` violin case '' in spanish ? 
  fixed . 
  thanks . 
  one could also argue that it whould be `` sheer driving pleasure '' , as that 's bmw 's tagline in the us , where `` freude am fahren '' is the german one . 
  it 's saying it can be ** up to ** this wingspan and ** up to ** this size , but stating the average weight . 
  it 's like saying humans can be up to the size of andre the giant , but on average only weigh 132 lbs .

  heh , a buddy of mine did kinda the opposite .
