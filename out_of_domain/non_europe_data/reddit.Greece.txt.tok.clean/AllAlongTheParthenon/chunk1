... because spelling `` caterpillar '' will be no trouble at all . 
  golden dawn is far more extreme than front national is . 
  no doubt , fn is a right-wing , populist party , with racism embedded in its doctrines . 
  however , golden dawn is straight up nazi , pogroms , assault sections , and salutes included . 
  front national is closer to the greek party laos , which was the 3rd party in greece - up until they participated to a government , that is . 
  you are right . 
  however , approval rating is especially important in greece , where the clientelistic nature of politics prevents a lot of people from voting someone other than whoever their interests are tied to . 
  street appeal takes on another meaning . 
  of course they hate jews . 
  and btw there is more to being nazi than just hating jews . 
  also , hitler also `` simply '' wanted germany for the germans . 
  the foreigners did not bankrupt the country by claiming welfare . 
  that is beyond false . 
  oh , `` a couple hundred million foreigners '' ? 
  edit : hitler also wanted a bit more than germany, 
  the sysytem you are referring to is aristocracy ( greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 aristokrat\u00eda , from \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 aristos `` excellent , '' and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 kratos `` power '' ) . 
  turns out it 's not that great . 
  because the credentials are decided by the elite in power , amongst many other things . 
  6 ) [ gary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gary_glitter#legal_history ) is a pretty bad glitter . 
  magnets kill cancer . 
  just do n't tell 4chan . 
  actually , it is a rule which , even if not explicitely stated ( and it usually is , beit in laws , army manuals or other sources ) , applies to every army in the world . 
  this is true for any country that has ratified the geneva conventions . 
  it also applies as international customary law . 
  finally , and interestingly enough , it has also been applied * before * the signature and ratification of the 1948 geneva conventions , as it proceeds from the nuremberg trials after ww2 . 
  this is a noteable exception to the essential criminal law rule , * nullum crimen , nulla poena sine lege * ( meaning basically that a person can not or should not face criminal punishment except for an act that was criminalized by law before he/she performed the act ) , as the persons condemned in this trial were actually obeying legal authority .

  back in 2004 i discovered my phone had a feature which allowed the recording of the phonecalls i had made - something like pressing the `` 1 '' button for a while . 
  by listening to what i had accidentaly recorded , i also discovered my phone had a similar feature for calling the police . 
  so i heard a butt-dialed recording of my butt-dialed call to the police , which i made * while having sex * . 
  luckily it sounded * very * consensual . 
  btw , it turns out that the ( french ) police also turns on voicemail if you dont actually say somethng for a while . 
  so i actually ... 
  * tl ; dr * listened to a butt-dialed recording of a butt-dial to the police of me and my gf having sex as recorded by the french police voicemail, 
  so this is the guy they are looking for ? 
  i will never understand nazis . 
  ( it 's like derp but for kittens ), 
  ( get it ? 
  get it ? ), 
  wow . 
  thanks , man , way to not generalize . 
  what would you refer to your fellow countrymen as , should you take the worse of them as standard ? 
  perhaps exactly the same . 
  thanks . 
  our country is pretty awesome , and still absolutely safe . 
  the police is filled with dickheads , but that 's only an issue should you be in one of the very few dodgy areas of athens . 
  greece is in no way comparable to karachi . 
  athens is pretty much as safe as london , and maybe more so . 
  someone had to say it . 
  tourists are not actually getting beaten by police . 
  immigrants , yes . 
  leftists , yes . 
  greeks , yes . 
  but tourists ? 
  first i ve heard of . 
  not claiming in any way it is n't true , i just think they confused him for one of te above-mentioned usual victims . 
  as an ex-smoker , i find that ex-smokers are the least tolerant people to smoke . 
  i vowed myself to never be * that guy * and to only annoy smokers by telling them stuff like `` i m sorry , i do n't have a light , i quit '' and by constantly making them say i am awesome for quitting . 
  perhaps i am that guy after all . 
  this ca n't be true . 
  too dangerous . 
  you guys are going about it all wrong . 
  the thing to do is to establish `` late mondays '' : going to work at 12:30 on mondays . 
  that way monday is not that bad , you get a chill week start and you boost your economy with an extra day of going out . 
  it 's on my agenda for when i get to be in power . 
  this also means that the german commander there was n't a total arsehole either , as he did n't just kill everyone . 
  had to be said . 
  please remember , when you read news like these , that ( besides immigrants in greece of course ) the greeks are the ones who suffer from the way the greek police behaves . 
  nazis are not known to be nice to people who disagree . 
  saying greece is a shithole implies it 's filled with shit . 
  you are insulting a country , a nation even , not a state , by saying greece is a shithole . 
  you are insulting greeks as well . 
  greece is not a shithole . 
  greece is actually pretty awesome . 
  most of us manage to keep our heads up in the midst of all this . 
  most of us - and by far !, 
  - would never vote for golden dawn , and are feverishly against it . 
  as far as i can remember , there has been police that works hand in hand with the fascists . 
  the police was never really purged of the people who had worked with the dictatorship ( 1967-1974 ) . 
  and even before that , the police was known to work with fascists , amongst other things to commit political assasssinations ( cf. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grigoris_lambrakis#assassination ) . 
  however , it 's on a whole new scale these past few years . 
  perhaps not to the point where it was before 1974 , but we 're getting there . 
  as a greek living in greece , i also confirm this . 
  so you basically smoked pot with the school director . 
  just say it . 
  if it did n't cause sympathy towards nazis , i would be perfectly fine with this . 
  ca n't mess with tradition, 
  you obviously do n't live in greece . 
  or you never go in downtown athens . 
  perhaps you have never witnessed a pogrom . 
  perhaps you do n't know that the police never ever does anything against them . 
  i might have gone a bit over the boundaries of , say , sanity with my comment , but boy did these scumbags have it coming . 
  not voting for them is not enough . 
  prosecuting them does not work , and exposes the person going against them to violence by gd members . 
  the police does nothing against , if not effectively protects , gd . 
  bombing anyone and threatening human lives is never good . 
  i should not have said that i d be fine with it . 
  you are probably aware that minor bombings with no victims happen rather frequently , and never against gd offices . 
  that book .
