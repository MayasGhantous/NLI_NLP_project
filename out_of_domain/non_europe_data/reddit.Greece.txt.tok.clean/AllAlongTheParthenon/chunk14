  to the best of my knowledge , it is a requirement for all eu countries . 
  you do n't actually have to pick it up in person , you can sign an exousiodotisi and have someone pick it up for you . 
  ask for it next time you go . 
  it is illegal for them to send it to you by the mail . 
  special photograph fee ? 
  you can bring your own , provided they match the specifications you can find online . 
  thing is , if your passport is rejected by the police , you have to submit an application again . 
  which would be more costly . 
  the consulate is playing it safe for you , but it 's up to you to decide . 
  from what i understand , the fingerprints being taken at each renewal is a requirement that stems from the eu regulations . 
  it is illegal to keep your fingerprints on record outside the case of criminal proceedings , as they are personal data . 
  they make you go to this photographer because they know that he knows the format and there will be no technical issue which would cause your application to be rejected , and make it necessary for you to go to the consulate again . 
  guys if you have issues , complain . 
  send an email with the specific issues you faced . 
  you will be able to vent where you are supposed to vent and , at the very least , they will have to fill in more paperwork . 
  so many things never change because people do n't report their issues and just say '' \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ... '', 
  i lived in paris for a while . 
  ca n't say i did n't have to go 2-3 times to get the job done , but it was n't * that * bad . 
  ah yes , few honorary consulates do a good job, 
  that was just for the inauguration . 
  fun fact : it 's not finished yet . 
  well , he is even more in a position of power now than he was before . 
  he is the president of the united states . 
  people who negotiate with him will want something from him . 
  that does n't necessarily mean he will get what he wants , though, 
  the king . 
  how is that disrespectful ? 
  to me , using his name as a synonym for what he called `` the holy sacrament '' is not disrespectful , but i see where you are coming from . 
  i am fairly confident bob started smoking weed as a young rude boy , long before religion came into play . 
  probably because getting high is enjoyable in itself . 
  anyways , i promise i wo n't call weed `` bob marley '' in front of you , 
  lol the r/historyporn 's top comment is, 
   was the communist part really needed for the title ? 
  well played , u/white _ space_christ for spreading the \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430, 
  that 's what i thought too , until i discovered it 's the best palate cleanser ever . 
  awesome at any kind of tasting . 
  relevant nasreddin hodjah joke :, 
  hodjah sees christians signing themelselves . 
  asks them wtf they are doing . 
  christians answer `` what , infidel , do n't you know ? 
  this is the sign if the cross , by which we honor the death of our lord and saviour who died on the cross, 
  hodjah bursts into laughter . 
  christians ask him '' why do you laugh , infidel ? '', 
  hodjah answers , laughing to tears : '' sorry , but what would you be doing if your lord got impaled ? '', 
  god i love 16th century humour, 
  it is on poppier side , yes . 
  turkey violates greek airspace every day , btw . 
  and if you consider fir violations , then it 's all day every day , baby . 
  `` drop it drop it '' was `` traffic blocking '' , lol . 
  you would have made it so much easier by saying it was on the same riddim . 
  edit : from memory :, 
  traffic blocking,

  if you were in the dance in the late 90s-early 2000s , no way you can forget it, 
  or to the internationale [ ( chinese tv show version ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzld5rxkeua ), 
  dancehall artists will still have a backing band when playing live , even if the original riddim is 100 % digital . 
  that is , i believe , a matter of tradition and of expectations when providing a live show . 
  the studio version will be , however , very much digital . 
  this is the case for all major reggae artists since 1985 . 
  it is more an issue of i who is the producer : from king jammy 's or king tubby in the later years , to daseca or john 2 , 100 % digital riddims are the overwhelming majority . 
  artists ranging from wayne smith to sizzla , buju or vybz kartel and busy signal have been on them . 
  basically any well-respected artist since the late 80s will have at least some fully digital tracks . 
  but i feel you are referring to a roots reggae sound , based on the good old skank and the one drop , rockers or stepper drum patterns . 
  check out , as mentioned earlier , productions by jammy 's and tubby in the late 80s , penthouse records in the 90s , or digital dub like bush chemists and the rest of the uk digital dub scene for obvious examples . 
  was n't a head of state though . 
  only presidents and kings are heads of state . 
  brb , investing in some `` free di gangsta ras '' t-shirts . 
  it 's pretty much safe to walk anywhere in bangkok . 
  watch out for the rain though . 
  r-sonic were awesome . 
  it helped that they were produced by frenchie , who went on to become a proper dancehall producer . 
  fun fact : he is the son of a foreign french minister of education . 
  i have n't read it , but reading about it makes me want to . 
  steffens is probably the definitive author on marley . 
  i d love to see his narrative in one of the most influential artists of the 20th century . 
  especially if it broadens the perspective from the usual hagiography , and puts the person in context and perspective . 
  i 'd definitely recommend [ `` a brief history of seven killings '' by marlon james ] (, 
  https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/brief-history-of-seven-killings-marlon-james-review ) for a brutal account of the jamaican context of the era . 
  it 's fiction . 
  and while we 're on the topic of books , [ helen lee 's `` the first rasta '' ] ( https://www.amazon.com/first-rasta-leonard-howell-rastafarianism/dp/1556525583#productdescription_secondary_view_div_1502777628481 ) is a must-read if you 're interested in how rasta comes into play,

  well you 'd have to go get a member card and then queue for the tickets when they come out . 
  or try going to the stadium like 45 ' before the game and get tickets off a scalper . 
  go by the ticket booth . 
  you may have to wait a bit , but it could/should work . 
  a person has been arrested for a facebook parody group mocking geron paisios , a monk reveered for his `` prophecies '' . 
  the group ran under the name geron pastitsios . 
  pastitsio is a greek pasta dish ( hence the picture from the facebook page showing the monk with a big plate of pasta ) . 
  this can only mean one thing :, 
  the arrested person is a martyr of the church of the flying spaghetti monster . 
  you can help #freegeronpastitsios,

  since romans worshipped essentially greek gods , were there significant differences between the greek versions of the myths and the roman ones ?
