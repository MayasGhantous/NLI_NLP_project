  it will make thessaloniki even more interesting for you . 
  do it . 
  as an ex-smoker ( two and a half years smoke-free , yay for me ) living in a country ( greece ) where people still smoke mostly everywhere ( because f * ck laws and other people ) , i must say i am impressed by how much smoke seems to annoy you people . 
  i spend all my nights out in smoke-filled rooms and noone seems to mind the smoke . 
  and i know non-smokers dont stay at home . 
  also , for the number of potheads hanging around here , the cigarette-hating seems weird . 
  pobably not the same people ? 
  thanks for minding other people , smokers of reddit . 
  minding other people is awesome . 
  thanks for not exagerating , fellow non-smokers of reddit , we breathe exhaust fumes all the time when in the street , and it 's probably worse . 
  also : caps lock everywhere , reddit content translations with comic sans fonts , greeklish ( where you write in greek but using the latin alphabet ) , golden dawn 's nazis all over the greek interwebs ( news sites ' comments sections , any non-customized youtube homepage and so on ) , so much conpiracy theory because we re so awesome but they keep us down ... 
  some intense stuff . 
  i like you too . 
  have an upvote and a nice day . 
  i was eleven and went to watch `` the crying game '' with a friend . 
  i had no idea what the movie was about and , being 12 , did n't pick up on any of the clues along the way that could 've warn me about what was about to happen . 
  at a certain point in the movie , forest whittaker starts making out with the girl , she undresses ( at which point my friend and i are very enthousiastic and giggling like two 12 year olds about to see a sex scene at the movies ) and bam - a dong . 
  the way my penis went from standing guard to flaccid immediately ( i think it even tried to crawl back inside me ) made my non-gayness rather obvious to me . 
  not that i thought i might be gay , but i do n't think anyone can be really certain about their sexuality at age 12 . 
  go to up northeast to [ zagorohoria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagori ) in epirus . 
  beautiful stonebuilt villages . 
  really gorgeous nature , the beautiful [ vikos gorge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikos\u2013ao\u00f6s_national_park ) . 
  you wont regret it . 
  where is he wrong ? 
  just curious, 
  this is the convention on genocide ` sdefinition of genocide :, 
  `` in the present convention , genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such :, 
  ( a ) killing members of the group ;, 
  ( b ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ;, 
  ( c ) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ;, 
  ( d ) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ;, 
  ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . '', 
  you can therefore * technically * have genocide on a small scale , as intent is the key element . 
  are n't you supposed to wish people a happy whatever-t-is they 're celebrating ? 
  personally , i 'd wish e.g. 
  a happy ramadan to a muslim even though i am not one . 
  anyways , the point is , if people wish you a happy whatever , they wish you a happy time period . 
  getting offended does make you a bit of a grinch ( get it ? 
  get it ? 
  a grinch ? 
  you could definitely argue this , as it could indeed fall under ( c ) . 
  edit : just to be clear , i 'm not saying it would hold up in court , i 'm saying it could be argued . 
  \u0391\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 is indeed more poetic , however it is `` seas of freedom '' and not `` free seas '' . 
  you 're not seriously trying to get a text analysis out of me now are ya, 
  all right , this should be interesting . 
  two questions :, 
  i live in greece . 
  on the `` what to watch '' page , there are always videos from the neo-nazi party golden dawn 's channel . 
  always . 
  every day . 
  even if i log on through a proxy , or through the incognito tab . 
  why ? 
  would you let that happen in the us ? 
  why not have the organize by upload date feature ? 
  newer to older ? 
  not by date , as in today , yesterday etc. 
  obviously question number 1 . 
  is the one i d really like you to answer . 
  pretty please . 
  i bet he regretted this favor to mussolini . 
  you do need it . 
  but you can find the small , hand-held models , pretty easily ( eg [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hic-brands-that-cook-005/dp/b0002kzunk ) ) . 
  you must have kept the milk cold .

  i love how ninja just come and dont care about diddy , how he actually goes on and turns his back to him . 
  its a different level of showmanship . 
  it is entirely capleton . 
  there is no other deejay on the track . 
  actually , sizzla is on none of the [ `` liberation '' ] ( http://www.riddimbase.org/riddimbase/query.php?category=riddim&amp;id=916&amp;page=1 ) riddim series . 
  btw morgan heritage are produicing this .

  also , you ca n't hear his voice . 
  ps : do n't you guys miss live horns ? 
  wikipedia was wrong . 
  [ but i corrected them .

  if you want lust the capital sin , go for \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 . 
  if you want lust as in , say , lust for life , go for \u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 . 
  \u039b\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 has a negative connotation whereas \u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 doesnt . 
  according to [ riddimbase ] ( http://www.riddimbase.org/riddimbase/query.php?category=riddim&amp;id=3767&amp;page=1 ) as well as my personal knowledge , this is the only tune on the riddim . 
  self-titled riddim , then . 
  you might be entertained by a remix by italian remix kings kalibandulu that i can only find on mixes right now . 
  try [ this album ] ( http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-biggest-dancehall-anthems-1979-1982-mw0000661408/releases ) for early dancehall . 
  rough and rugged but not boom-boom digital dancehall . 
  btw dancehall is not rap , and there can be singing . 
  it 's not about the topics either btw . 
  dancehall is sound system music , more stripped than its roots counterparts , less attached to consciousness . 
  the main difference is that dancehall was played in jamaican dances ( as in the infamous skateland ) and not in concerts . 
  yellowman is the king of dancehall ( no matter what beenie man says ) , and his carrieris almost exclusively based on analog riddims . 
  came up with everything , spread it everywhere , got none left for us,

  you are alone on this one . 
  spend two days in athens . 
  then you must go to santorini because , well , it is spectacular . 
  maybe try a couple of other cyclad islands , milos is a bit far but has gorgeous beaches , tinos has the prettiest villages ... for how long are you staying ? 
  santorini is always listed in the places-you-must-see-before-you-die lists , so dont miss it . 
  no , it 's about the imminent conquest of the planet by alien superdinos .
