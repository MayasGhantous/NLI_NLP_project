  you americans have streets named after numbers . 
  numbers . 
  and not too many ideas were taken when this was decided . 
  then any bombing of cities would be genocide . 
  clearly , this has never been seen as the case . 
  from germany to vietnam , to afghanistan ( the soviet attack , to keep this from being controversial ) , civilian populations have been targeted . 
  and noone spoke of genocide - and it makes sense . 
  not to say these are n't war crimes . 
  as soon as you do n't respect the essential principles of necessity , proportionality and discrimnation , you 're in war crime territory . 
  genocide is not an umbrella term for violations of humanitarian law . 
  it 's a specific violation . 
  using it too often makes it lose its specific weight and makes other humanitarian law violations seem unimportant . 
  tl ; dr : genocide has a specific definition , not a generic term for attacks against a civilian population, 
  genocide is a specific violation of international law . 
  ethnic cleansing has no legal definition . 
  this is a very interesting legal question in the field of international law : the criterion of `` overall control '' v. `` effective control '' . 
  basically the international court of justice requires for an action to be directly ordered by a state ( effective control ) in order for that state to be held responsible for it . 
  it is a very stringent criterion , but it is the one in use . 
  for more : [ this ] ( http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/18/4/233.pdf ) is a pretty good article on this legal aspect . 
  if you feel like reading legal articles , that is . 
  it is * precisely * what the court did in the us v. nicaragua case of 1986 . 
  to the best of my knowledge , no other decision has gone further in rejecting state involvement since .

  4 of [ this summary ] ( http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=367&amp;code=nus&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=70&amp;k=66&amp;p3=5 ) to see what i mean . 
  however , one must bear in mind that , to an extent , the court can not avoid taking politics into consideration in order to produice decisions that reflect - and especially that impact - international affairs . 
  they have to take politics into account just like a civil court must take society into account . 
  i might have misunderstood your earlier comment . 
  what i wanted to say is precisely that : the intent must be to destroy the entire persuasion , to use your term ( and for lack of a better one ) , not `` just '' to kill the entire civilian population of one city . 
  the serbs argued - not irrationally - that they `` only '' killed the adult male populations , because their goal was to take out the potential fighters , not the entire bosniak population . 
  not saying i agree with their analysis , just saying it is interesting from a theoretical point of view . 
  in effect , if you take out all male members of a persuasion , you prevent it from reproduicing itself - amongst other things - and therefore quite clearly commit genocide . 
  this !, 
  please address this !, 
  it must be answered !, 
  and if you have an extra second , i would like to know your opinion on crepes . 
  i lol 'd , but it 's a bit more complex . 
  for example , the court went out of its way in order to show it had competence to hear the case , when it clearly did n't , thus pissing off the us greatly . 
  so it was n't * too * friendly to the us . 
  note that the contra pop up at unexpected places , i.e. 
  [ the iran-contra affair ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93contra_affair ), 
  i think you 're giving too much importance to the `` invitation '' . 
  `` invitations '' were common in the eastern roman empire - and in medieval europe as a whole . 
  the sack of constantinople was decided - at least according to my sources - for financial reasons way above any other , as entirelyalive puts it above . 
  and constantinople was probably the richest city in europe at this point . 
  and the eastern roman empire never recovered . 
  damn you crusaders !, 
  more than the hierarchy , it was the people of constantinople that rejected the submission to the catholic church . 
  constantinople still remained the richest city in europe at the time , as shown by the wealth spread though its sack . 
  the empire was in rough shape indeed , thanks to the angeloi . 
  damn you angeloi !, 
  in my humble opinion , they went to constantinople because of venetian pressure , not because of any `` invitation '' . 
  but that is a loooong conversation and probably highly subjective , i.e. 
  depends on your sources and your personal take on the subject . 
  lighters . 
  i smoked for 13 years , never bought one . 
  these things go around enough . 
  i still have a pack of them somewhere . 
  they pay for sex past . 
  it 's called children . 
  sure , but who 's chairing ? 
  you may post it again and i will upvote it again . 
  athens is pretty awesome all year around . 
  might even be better in january . 
  in late january , we usually get good weather for 2-3 weeks so you might even have great weather . 
  its a 4 million strong city , so attractions , restaurants etc will be open . 
  some tourist shops might be closed ( even though i doubt it ) , but you wouldnt be missing out . 
  as for riots etc , predicting the future is usually tough , but in any case , it would take something of a much bigger scale than we 've had so far for you to not be able to avoid it . 
  actually , you would only see things of the kind if you actively tried to - i dont think tourists have ever been `` caught in a protest '' .

  you probably were thinking of an artist but hey - butchers come first . 
  also , whoever decided to request his services . 
  can you disagree with your government 's views deeply and still be an american ? 
  i know , i know , it 's different being a member of a nation and one of a church . 
  however , my point is that you can disagree with the hierarchy and still consider yourself a part of the structure . 
  also , it is my impression that seeking coherence in a bling-covered church which professes poverty is pointless . 
  and getting too technical about it as well . 
  american football is fancy padded rugby . 
  proper football is god 's gift to sundays . 
  nuff said . 
  just had to say that he plays for aek , a club with fans who are known for their antifascist ideology . 
  their main supporters club issued a statement saying that he is unwanted in the club . 
  goddamit now they 'll ask if we have fridges in europe . 
  shot through the god, 
  and you 're to blame, 
  btw , the influence of the eastern roman empire ( aka byzantine ) architecture on islamic architecture is [ a well-known fact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_architecture#influences ) . 
  mind you , islam is a far more tolerant religion than it is made out to be . 
  actually , the respect of the other monotheistic religions is dictated by the quoran . 
  the quoran is much stricter than the bible , though , and how out-of-date it is is all the more obvious . 
  inb4 the old testament is super precise, 
  edit : also , `` subdude '' is an awesome term, 
  same mythology . 
  local variations , but same mythology . 
  pluto was widely used by greeks , however . 
  that 's not a protest . 
  it 's a flashmob . 
  the term `` mithridatism '' is still quite commonly used in greece metaphorically , meaning the process of slowly getting used to bad things and accepting them . 
  the process of slowly accepting that your personnal information is commonly shared on the web is mithridatism, 
  just look how much fun people were having before they started watching concerts through phone screens !, 
  greek here .
