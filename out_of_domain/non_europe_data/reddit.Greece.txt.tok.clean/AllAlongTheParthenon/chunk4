  not very likely that it will . 
  although we do have too much of that ignorant scum around . 
  edit : `` ignorant scum '' refers to gd members and sympathizers . 
  in my mind , this was obvious . 
  an `` impotent country '' you say ? 
  pretty far from the truth . 
  greece has been spending a far too big portion of her gdp on her army for far too long to be called `` impotent '' . 
  let 's just focus on the fact that greece wo n't attack her neighbors for many other reasons besides `` impotence '' . 
  this is because it has shrunk because of the crisis . 
  it had been [ above 3 % of a larger gdp in 2008 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/world/europe/08iht-letter08.html?_r=0 ) . 
  also consider that there had been a [ 7 to 10 ratio ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/100223/greece-military-spending ) for a number of years between the us military help awarded to greece and turkey respectively . 
  it also remains the [ second country in the eu regarding military expenditure as a percentage of the gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#european_military_expenditure ) . 
  i therefore insist that `` impotence '' is by far an overstatement . 
  please see [ my answer below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1clidn/28_migrant_workers_working_at_a_strawberry_farm/c9hr098 ) . 
  indeed it does not . 
  still , it is far from impotent . 
  what i am saying is that impotent is by far an overstatement . 
  indeed . 
  however , note that budgets alone dont go to war : where would afghanistan stand ? 
  check out the greek resistance against nazi occupation when there was widespread famine , or especially the italian-greek war of 1941 . 
  and greece has a solid foundation . 
  overall , i insist that impotence is a huge overstatement . 
  i understand that , from a us perspective , anyone without nuclear capacity can be seen as such . 
  history has shown otherwise . 
  but basically , greece wo n't go to war with fellow nato countries or eu member states or countries for which it is one of the principal investor , which pretty much rules out its neighbors . 
  which renders this debate largely moot . 
  also , greece is pretty awesome . 
  there are quite a few of us that could find jobs rather easily abroad , and choose to sacrifice a better paycheck in order to live here . 
  if you have a job , and you get paid , on time , then yup , awesome . 
  overall , i see that you consider that there are two kinds of countries in the world : ones who have chances of success as the agressor in a world war and impotent ones . 
  i disagree . 
  as for `` my point '' : military capacity , be it in hardware or skilled men , did not disappear because of the economic downturn . 
  greece still has the army , and the weapons . 
  getting important military aid does show that you rely on foreign support . 
  guess what ? 
  so does , say , turkey , the `` juggernaut '' . 
  not in the top 5 of gross spenders : indeed , not anymore . 
  does that make it an impotent country ? 
  how is its chances of success as the agressor in a world war the context ? 
  the context is [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1clidn/28_migrant_workers_working_at_a_strawberry_farm/c9hnx83 ) . 
  i disagreed with the use of the term `` impotent '' . 
  i did n't say greece could take on the world . 
  if this is what you understood , my apologies for not being clear enough , i guess . 
  say that you live in athens . 
  athens is overall not gorgeous ; however , the area around the acropolis is beautifull . 
  walking around it is something i never grow tired of . 
  there is something to be said about living next to historical landmarks . 
  also , in the rather long summer , every weekend is a chance to jump on a boat and go to an island , or visit the mainland , both definitely being amazing . 
  besides the people ( not that we are somehow a magically unique country where everyone is nice and polite , that would be far from the truth ) , the food ( most definitely ) , and the climate ( getting just enough winter to value the summer is awesome ) , the nightlife is also great . 
  but as a greek who has had his share of setbacks , do whatever is best for your future . 
  usually , the judges decide . 
  same as the us . 
  * lato sensu * and in the us . 
  in most democratic systems , the government * stricto sensu * is the prime minister and the ministers , what you would refer to as the executive branch of the government . 
  there is a huge difference between if the government ( the administration ) decides what constitutes free speech , and if the judicial decides . 
  in the us , the judges decide how far free speech goes , e.g. 
  in the decision regarding the westboro church above . 
  my point being that the courts have to interpret what constitutes free speech in the us and hate speech in canada . 
  yet again , i insist : `` government '' used as a synonym of `` administration '' is an american specificity . 
  and an interesting one at that . 
  in british english ( and that of the commonwealth of nations ) , a government more narrowly refers to the particular executive in control of a state at a given time [ 2 ] '' [ ( wikipedia ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government ) . 
  do note that `` the commonwealth of nations '' refers to pretty much the entire english-speaking world but the us . 
  also note that , outside the us , `` government '' * always * refers to the executive branch , without even including the head of state ( the queen in the commonwealth nations , the president of france , etc. ) . 
  even if you take the root of the word , the greek '' \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 '' , the term '' \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 '' refers to what i have just described . 
  and it seems pretty clear that in the context of, 
   why , the government decides !!!, 
  you know , that 'll never go wrong . 
  this is what was meant by government . 
  please also note that i answered with reasonable arguments to someone who has just said that `` you are wrong '' and that other answers are `` really stupid '' . 
  this might have been a wate of time . 
  dude , you had to be there . 
   i have n't ever seen a cheque from the local souvlaki joint when i order takeaway . 
  ... not saying it should be necessary , but if you let it slide and never * ask * for it , you 're not helping . 
  the reason why public servants do n't get fired in most countries is because they used to be fired every time there was a government change. , in order for the new government to put its people in their stead . 
  just sayin ', 
  take any serious book on greece or the region ( i recommend stavrianos , * the balkans since 1453 * ) , any somehow serious book and you will see that the public sector has been bloated basically since the late 19th century . 
  it 's not the 80s socialist government 's fault ( although they did have a heavy hand ) , but a more general problem in greece , a much older one at that . 
  it 's when there is no legitimate objective which can be reached by the specific legislation . 
  i expected something harsher after i read your first line . 
  my idea of it is that something is legitimate if it serves public interest . 
  i understand how this is a very broad way of defining it . 
  however , flexiblity in decision-making is necessary , i.e. 
  allow for different policy-making options . 
  tax-cuts may benefit the economy , but they also may be a way to help specific interest groups for e.g. 
  nepotistic reasons . 
  i get the feeling that this is what you were saying . 
  what i meant to say is that one could start by getting rid of the measures which strikingly do not serve public interest . 
  and there are enough of these ones already . 
  pantheon , dude ? 
  well we got new ones now . 
   ( yes , but my family sold you the property your ass is currently living on and have been forth e past century . 
  have a little respect . ), 
  so your family sold them land a century ago and you demand respect for that ? 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't follow . 
  please keep in mind that this is a sensationalist article written by a journalist trying to oversell a situation, 
  i live in greece , i go to exarchia all the time , i probably have witnessed sisa use ( hard to tell what 's in these bowls ) , and i would just like to say that it is not as common in athens as the article portrays it - the journalist basically writes that there are no sources save for some junkies . 
  also , athens is not the hellhole of decline it is made out to be . 
  there are n't sisa or smack users ( smack is much more common ) on each square - on some , specific squares or streets , yes - but in no way as many as the user describes . 
  athens is actually a pretty awesome city to live in , provided you have a job ( which is unfortunately not the rule ) . 
  things have been far better , sure , but keeping the focus on the worse neighborhoods ( exarchia not being one of them , exarchia is great , free self-made , with a strong community spirit ) of a 4 + million-strong city is not providing a realistic picture .
