  tl ; dr sensationalist paper is sensationalist . 
  no biggie . 
  did n't do as many drugs as i should have . 
  has n't this been covered by joey in [ this ] ( http://www.fanfr.com/scripts/saison4/friendsgeneration2.php?nav=script&amp;version=vo&amp;episodescript=414&amp;w=768 ) episode ? 
  this is just begging for 4chan to raid it, 
  they have , it won the cannes festival prize , and it 's called [ blue is the warmest color : the life of adele ] ( http://www.imdb.com/news/ni54518979/ ), 
  tour of the island is a must . 
  also last time i went there i ate at a tavern in polonia ( i think it was called gialos ? ), 
  which was a few cuts above the rest . 
  awesome beaches all around the island . 
  i mostly agree with what you guys are saying . 
  however , there is one thing that needs to be said : these guys went there to be offended , but the movie was specifically aimed at offending them . 
  and fair enough , trying to offend is rightfully is protected by free speach , but it still not the nicest thing to do . 
  you guys are all upvoting a movie about how multiculturalism is an epic fail . 
  multiculturalism isnt an epic fail , it is a massive win . 
  people living together in peace - as it happens 99 % of the time - is the biggest win of all . 
  the single biggest achievement of mankind . 
  if you believe multiculturalism is the issue , then i have an essential disagreement with you . 
  anytime by bounty killer . 
  also what a day by tanya stephens . 
  ... and of coutse turn the other cheek . 
  upvote is the new forward, 
  as reggae was - and to an extent still is - a 45 oriented music , i would recommend finding good compilations , and going from there . 
  the greatest reggae compilation in my opinion is `` arkology '' , dealing with the work of lee scratch perry as a producer . 
  then i d recommend the channel one history ( vp records ) and the greatest dancehall anthems 1978-1982 ( greensleeves records ) to cover the relevant time periods . 
  the whole `` reggae anthology '' series by vp records is pretty great . 
  steering around capleton , sizzla and buju means steering around arguably the best reggae and dancehall of the 90s . 
  [ praise ye jah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cndhlxvoozs ) , [ jah jah city ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kv4mfhipvm\u200e ) and [ murderer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvfpu87hws ) stand amongst the heaviest tunes in reggae history . 
  so there 's your dilemma to face ... and a common one amongst reggae fans . 
  the unbearable lightnes of being , by milan kundera . 
  not all reggae is roots , but not all music is reggae . 
  sublime do have a reggae influence , but it is arguably not their main influence , and definitely not the genre they belong to . 
  they re more akin to , say , nofx than barrington levy , even though they nodd to his songs often . 
  more than how much i disagree with you , what shocks me the most is the tone you seem to use . 
  had an empty soft plastic bottle of lighting alcohol . 
  wondered if i could make a flame enter the bottle . 
  realized it might cause something loud . 
  went into a closet to make sure if it did get loud , my parents would n't be alarmed . 
  i pressed the air out of the bottle , sucked the flame in . 
  the bottle popped open with a bang . 
  20 years later , my ears still buzz . 
  bwoy , you have an opinion , not knowledge , and your opinion is understandable ... for a high school kid that has never touched the edge of a 45 . 
  you dont know much , but hey , at least you are very cute when you re all self-assured . 
  i could pinch your cheeks . 
  disagree . 
  the significant stuff tends to be the stuff we remember . 
  otherwise , backstreet boys , take that , spice girls , ace of base et al. 
  would be the things that come to mind when thinking of the 90s . 
  because countries do n't bring their own citizens - let alone armies or governments - to court on war crimes charges . 
  no , it 's because countries do n't bring their own to court for war crimes . 
  it is true that there was no international legal instrument prohibiting bombings during wwi . 
  however , when it comes to the legality of the use of nuclear weapons , the international court of justice issud an [ advisory opinion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_court_of_justice_advisory_opinion_on_the_legality_of_the_threat_or_use_of_nuclear_weapons ) according to which , basically , the use of the bomb would be internationally illegal and constitutive of war crimes . 
  if , however , the survival of the state was threatened , then well * there 's no way to tell *, 
  as for war crimes the us or other countries have comitted since , they have not - for the most part - been prosecuted due to the lack of an international criminal court and of international cooperation . 
  well there 's the international criminal court but the us does n't care . 
  ** tl ; dr bombings were n't illegal , the use of nuclear bombs now is , please join the icc , usa **, 
  have fun reading [ eric hobsbawm 's * the long nineteenth century * trilogy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_long_19th_century ) !, 
  went tzatziki w / you in athens a couple years ago . 
  question : arent you afraid of over-bros ? 
  as in making music which is too bro-ey ? 
  as in bro-step ? 
  am i making sense ? 
  is anything really ? 
  it called me a pretty girl . 
  they would 've brought freedom , but only americans can bring freedom . 
  late too the party , but :, 
  - thought, 
  - through, 
  - tough, 
  - though, 
  are all spelled the same but have no common pronounciation . 
  wtf english ? 
  girl you know it 's true - milli vanilli . 
  `` together we 're one , separated we 're two '' . 
  nuff said . 
  a few months later :, 
  1 . indeed , nobody is . 
  but it would be more like the us surrendering them . 
  and 2 . 
  indeed it is n't . 
  it is rarely in the interest of the most powerful to submit to the rule of law . 
  that 's not the point i am trying to make . 
  a few months late : not talking about the test ban , but about the icj 's ruling on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons . 
  the use of nuclear bombs is clearly against many principles of international law . 
  and if its use is completely legal , then what 's everybody 's problem with iran ? 
  i would say that the rule is : because that 's what we 've been calling them . 
  fun facts :, 
  we , greeks , go as far as refering to france as gaul and switzerland as helvetia , because we 're old school like that . 
  we also call ourselves hellenes . 
  there is no good reason to us being called greeks , besides the rule i mentioned . 
  however , we had called ourselves romans for the better part of the last two millenia , and still colloquially do . 
  the turks still refer to the - nowadays tiny - greek minority in turkey as romans ( rum ) , as opposed to us greek nationals , whom they call ionians ( yunanistan being `` the country of the ionians '' ) . 
  ionia is what we called asia minor . 
  so there you go . 
  edit : a typo . 
  also : formatting is a bitch . 
  yes . 
  but you refer to yourseves as suisse , or schweiz . 
  no swiss ever called himself a helvet . 
  ir a confederate helvet .
