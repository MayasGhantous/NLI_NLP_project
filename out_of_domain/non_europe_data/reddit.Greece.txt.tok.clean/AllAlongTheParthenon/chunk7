  there 's a lot of bashment on the one here , mostly 90 's stuff , but also a few tunes from the noughties . 
  of course , there is a proper warm-up with big tunes from the 7o 's and 80 's as well . 
  it 's a matter of tradition . 
  there 's a roots segment , a badman segment , a female dj segment ... 
  but yeah , mostly bashment , so prepare to bogle in your living room , your bedroom , your garden and/or the rooftop . 
  up to you . 
  53 tunes in 68 minutes , because life is too short not to . 
  trying to figure out how to fix this . 
  if anyone has a clue , let me know . 
  try reaching out to american high schools in greece . 
  or high schools in astoria . 
  i have never heard of anyone playing lacrosse in greece though . 
  nope , greeks are def not latin . 
  not a latin language , not catholics . 
  what about a subpoena ? 
  so you are on a sizzla x bobby digital posting binge then . 
  not a bad choice . 
  not my kind of scene , but there is a buttload of techno events . 
  astron in psyrri and senza have techno every day . 
  there still is a vibrant psy trance scene , but all i can tell you for sure is that there are trance parties pretty much every weekend during the summer on strefi hill in exarhia . 
  electro is n't that big that i know of . 
  edit : try to link up on fb or something with a guy called dark elf . 
  he 's a mate and a trance dj . 
  he should know . 
  it was a recreation of the mythological seduction of leda by zeus . 
  so not * that * weird i guess . 
  fyi the headscarf is pretty traditional in most eastern european countries , in the balkans and throughout the middle-east ( which is religeously quite diverse ) . 
  that ` swhat women wore in my grandpa 's greek small village . 
  whoa - sorry , american friends , i ve been appropriating your culture since i was a baby , wearing blue jeans , sneakers , flannel shirts and the like . 
  please let me know if i should revert to [ this ] ( http://www.emmakayonline.com/uploads/5/8/3/7/5837372/8178470.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://world4.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ottoman-empire-costumes-52.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/190/flashcards/305190/png/11332300873289.png ) or [ this ] ( http://www.nashvillescene.com/imager/parthenon-symposia-series-the-archaeology-of-ancient-greek-dress/b/big/2365032/ebe6/ancient-greek-clothing-2.jpg ) in order to not appropriate any culture which is n't mine . 
  cultures who live together influence one another and inspire each other . 
  when you use something you like from another culture , it 's a mark of respect and even admiratioit.assigning quasi-ethnic uniforms that are not to be shared seems incredibly backwards to me . 
  at least that 's how i see it . 
  an answer worthy of mfa !, 
  thank you kind sir . 
  they must be pissed about the outcome of the greek elections . 
  a good opportunity to see how r/reggae feels about homophobic tunes . 
  splashing , dashing , restless sea, 
  jeez guys . 
  what is wrong with that color ? 
  you dont need to wear super dark suits all the time . 
  especially during daytime . 
  even more so during the summer . 
  if hedid n't wearit with a black tee , but with a white shirt and tie , op could pull it off in a formal environment . 
  i think . 
  of course it might be much for it . 
  so ... like a gateway forum ? 
   yes there were greeks who remained in turkey , and continued to speak greek , but those were overwhelmingly muslim greeks . 
  overtime these muslim greeks , have come to define themselves as turks . 
  there were more than 100 000 orthodox greeks who remained in istanbul until 1965 and the [ september events ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom ) . 
  today only about 2000 remain . 
  i am sorry , are you saying that the majority of the above mentioned more than 100 000 orthodox greeks were muslims ? 
  who are you talking about ? 
  from what i understand , the easterners considered themselves hellenic incontradistinction not with roman , but with barbarian . 
  isocrates actually prided athens by saying that hellene had become a cultural , and not an ethnic , affiliation , already in the 3rd century bc . 
  roman was a citizenship , not an ethnic affiliation , and was granted to all free citizens of the empire through the edict of caracalla in 212 - to most hellenized easterners before that . 
  hellene was also used in contradistinction with hebrew by paul - who was a jew , a roman citizen and an easterner . 
  so , again , not as an ethnic affiliation . 
  very early on in christian history , hellene was used in contradistinction with christian - already in the 2nd century ad . 
  i guess what i m trying to say is that easterners may have referred to themselves as both hellenic and roman , or as both roman and christian but not hellenic ( because they were christians , not because they werent of hellenic culture overall ) , a long time before rome fell . 
  alexander and philip considered themselves greek . 
  that is not to say they didnt consider themselves macedonians . 
  just as spartans considered themselves as hellenes and spartans . 
  are you saying that the more than 100 000 orthodox greeks who stayed in istanbul after 1923 , as per the lausanne treaty , converted to islam ? 
  i am sorry but it seems to be what you are saying . 
  and it is so wrong that i cant believe you are saying it . 
  so i might be misunderstanding . 
  you may be confusing self-identification as hellenes and as a distinct people . 
  you are right in saying that orthodox , greek-speaking ottoman subjects ( so most people belonging to the rum millet ) considered themselves as romans , not greeks ( hellenes ) , until the end of the 18th century . 
  however , they were conscious of not being turks . 
  they were conscious of belonging to the same group , of being rum , of being distinct from , say , armenians , and finally of being part of the \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 as they called it . 
   in the late 5th century ( not 6th ; i was wrong there ) we start to find priscus ( second-hand reports of priscus , mind ! ), 
  talking about the easterners as romans , and using the phrase `` the eastern romans '' . 
  that seems to be the earliest extant adoption of the term . 
  if i am not mistaken , it was the first distinction between eastern and western romans . 
  i believe both were just referred . 
  as romans before . 
   i wonder if this is why being `` roman '' became a thing after the split , and especially after rome fell . 
  `` roman '' was no longer just a citizenship , it was an ethnic identity that was up for grabs : and for people living somewhere like , say , syria , it may be that becoming `` roman '' was a lot easier than becoming `` greek '', 
  i know this one !, 
  by then , hellene had become an insult , meaning pagan . 
  so noone wanted to be a hellene ( greeks never called themselves greeks , still dont ) . 
  the church has hymns ( still sung ) about the err of the hellenes and the wrong ways of athens , etc. 
  sources are many , i ll just go with why byzantium by helen arweiler glykantzi, 
  thanks , that is very interesting !, 
  was the use of the term \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 exclusive from other , geographic identifiers ? 
  because from what i understand , ethnic identifiers were n't really in use in the roman empire . 
  there were cultural and geographic identifiers , and later ( ? ), 
  religious ones , all of which were used as such . 
  can we really talk about ethnic identifiers , if that is the case ? 
  everything i have read points to the opposite direction . 
  it would make sense that after two centuries of having everyone be roman citizens , the inhabitants of that part of the globe would be globally referred to as romans . 
  but i m still not sure you could say they considered themselves as ethnically roman . 
  grammys have n't been relevant for reggae in a while . 
  i d rather have the reggae grammy canceled at this point - obviously the judges have no clue about reggae . 
  after what has happened so far , i hope we ll teach em a lesson . 
  but no xorri ? 
  they just need to apply the fucking rules instead of making a show out of it .
