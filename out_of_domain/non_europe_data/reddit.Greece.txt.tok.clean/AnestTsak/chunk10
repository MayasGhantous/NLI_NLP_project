  i have lented my copy of tee to a friend so i ca n't check but i think esm\u00e9 bans the kids from doing some things because they are out , right ? 
  i know elevators are out , but they will be hard to draw as a small icon . 
  just put the three orphans and maybe olaf too , though he did n't turn out very well as you said . 
  what if s02e01 starts with some scenes that have already filmed in which the kids go to the school and meet the quagmires , nero , carmelita . 
  then , halfway through the episode , there 's a time skip , in order to explain why they 've grown older ( with a montage of their life there ) and jumps to when olaf arrives ( which they will film next year ) . 
  what i 'm saying is all of the scenes they 've filmed are n't actually in season 1 but they are in season 2 . 
  i also think such a time skip should allow sunny to grow older ( maybe not as older as the actress playing her will grow , but she should grow a bit in order to be able to walk in book 7 ) . 
  there 's no confirmation that the scenes with the quagmires involve the baudelaires . 
  maybe at the beginning of an episode of tww or tmm they could have the first scene be another fire , where we see duncan and isadora escape it . 
  it seems random at first but will have meaning when we see season 2 . 
  or maybe even follow the ( two ) triplets ' life after the fire until they go to the academy , in short scenes during episodes 5-8 . 
  and then , in season 3 , we see that same fire scene , however we also see quigley escape this time . 
  i 'd say it 's after the puttanesca dinner , right before he slaps him . 
  there are more hints to beatrice being their mother even in the earlier books . 
  the wide window , chapter 8 :, 
   i have seen many amazing things in my long and troubled life history . 
  i have seen a series of corridors built entirely out of human skulls . 
  i have seen a volcano erupt and send a wall of lava crawling toward a small village . 
  i have seen a a woman i loved picked up by an enormous eagle and flown to its high mountain nest . 
  the ersatz elevator , chapter 2, 
   `` i 've never had an aqueous martini , '' violet said , `` but i 'll try one . '', 
   `` ah ! '' jerome said . 
  `` you 're adventurous !, 
  i like that in a person . 
  your mother was adventurous , too . 
  you know , she and i were very good friends a ways back . 
  we hiked up mount fraught with some friends -- gosh , it must have been twenty years ago . 
  mount fraught was known for having dangerous animals on it , but your mother was n't afraid . 
  but then , swooping out of the sky -- '', 
  really ? 
  it works for me . 
  it 's on facebook . 
  really ? 
  i ca n't do something about that , it was only uploaded on facebook . 
  it 's on the official `` a series of unfortunate events '' account ( the one for netflix ) . 
  however when you go there it 's not there in the timeline or the `` videos '' page . 
  i found it because someone shared it to a private group about the series . 
  now , i know the official account posted it because if i tap on the name of the page that posted the video , it leads me to that exact page , but then i ca n't see the video . 
  it 's a shame because there 's some new footage , i.e. 
  the baudelaire mansion after the fire . 
  if you 'd like i could send it to you in a message ( messenger automatically sends the whole video when you send a link and i 've already sent it to a couple of people so i know it 'll work ) . 
  if anyone is interested , pm me your account . 
  i 'm not sure i understood what you mean , but the members of the troupe did n't pop up when it was convenient . 
  olaf just had one of them with him every time . 
  in trr the hook-handed man was diguised as dr. lucafont , in tmm the bald one with the long nose was disguised as foreman flacutono etc. 
  yes , and the members of the troupe are some of the flat characters . 
  a few of them kind of get a background story in the later books but it would be still better had they had character development since the first time they appeared . 
  might be because the children were scared of them and ignored their actual personality though . 
  i considered leaving / r/strangerthings and / r/westworld when the shitposts started but right now there 's nothing i would rather see than shitposts on this sub . 
  i 'm afraid it 's not going to be popular so such posts will calm me down . 
  i have n't read the vn . 
  when/how/why did rika stop time ? 
  thank you .

  ** edit : ** collider : http://collider.com/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-review/ - \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 very good -- damn fine television, 
   [ count olaf ] 's the eternal thorn in the baudelaires 's side , obsessed with laying his hands on the massive fortune willed to the children by their parents ( who may or may not appear , perhaps or perhaps not played by a pair of familiar faces -- netflix demands we remain coy ) . 
  that confirms it - will arnett and cobbie smulders [ will play the baudelaire parents ] ( https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/will-and-cobie.jpg?w=612 ) !,

  huh ? 
  i thought it was nick urata . 
  flashbacks . 
  your spoiler tag is n't working . 
  when and for how long do the quagmires appear ? 
  that 's okay . 
  i saw the other reply so i figured it 's about charles . 
  thanks !, 
  some reviews claimed that the actors of violet and klaus did n't act very well - is this true ? 
  how good are they , let 's say , compared to the stranger things kids ? 
  metacritic : http://www.metacritic.com/tv/lemony-snickets-a-series-of-unfortunate-events-2017, 
  do you think the especially picky fans will like it ? 
  ** edit : ** actually . 
  two more questions and i 'm done . 
  do you think it could get a nomination in any category for the emmys/golden globes ? 
  and is the incredibly deadly viper as small as we saw in the trailers or was that not its final `` edition '' ? 
  some watched the first four episodes and some the whole thing . 
  the best part of the series is books 8-13 . 
  be sure to continue with book 5 after you watch the show . 
  no , they are not `` the worst '' , because they * are * actually good . 
  it 's just that the next ones are better . 
  if you do n't want to , do n't read any more , just watch the show if you like . 
  yeah you 're probably right . 
  i remember listening to that asoue podcast and they once had a guest who said he wants everything to be exactly as it is in the books . 
  meaning , no vfd hints in the first season etc. 
  i think i 'm going to be satisfied but the only thing that will probably bother me a little is the amount of comedy it 'll have . 
  not that i 'll complain , i mean , it wo n't be surreal even if it 's pure comedy , it will just be a different take on the mood of the story . 
  i prefer drama though . 
  i 've never watched the show but i 've always wanted to . 
  can i participate in the rewatch or will there be spoilers for me in the comments ? 
  thanks . 
  then i 'll do it alone . 
  thanks for the answers !, 
  btw [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/dhyxlzhudou ) ( at 1:11 ) is the viper in the trailer , which some found quite small in size . 
   `` the books have a specific ending , '' says sonnenfeld . 
  `` what we would need to do is abandon the last book , or even two books . 
  and we would need to figure that out pretty quickly because we already have a blueprint for the series . '', 
  do n't they even dare mess up the penultimate peril !, 
  if they really need to to add extra stories , they should do it between books 9 and 12 , since books 5-9 have been prepared for season 2 . 
  although 3 seasons feels like a short series ( it is more than enough for asoue though ) , i personally prefer that only stick to the 13 stories . 
  where is this pic from ? 
  i do n't have netflix so i ca n't see any of these : / i 'll wait for the trailer to be uploaded somewhere else .
