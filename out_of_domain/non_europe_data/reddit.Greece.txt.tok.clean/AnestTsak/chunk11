  yeah that actually sounds logical . 
  just do n't let that plot twist be the beatrice one ... 
  i ca n't remember which , but a few reviews mention that a new side plot is added which solves a question that was not addressed in the books . 
  i think that this is about jacquelyn and it refers to the question of why did n't any ( competent ) volunteers try to take the orphans away from the trouble . 
  oh there has been a lot of promotion , [ trailers , interviews , websites etc. 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoue/comments/4nxhil/everything_we_know_so_far_about_the_netflix_series/?sort=top ), 
  i ca n't remember in which trailer this was , but i am 100 % sure that in one scene klaus is the one holding sunny . 
  i 'll look for it later . 
  you should have the more major characters , so no jerome or carmelita . 
  in order of importance these are the ones you should have :, 
  esm\u00e9, 
  i think these 6 are the best choice . 
  the specials are always part of a season . 
  + ** series 1 ** : -, 
  + ** series 2 ** : the christmas invasion, 
  + ** series 3 ** : the runaway bride, 
  + ** series 4 ** : voyage of the damned, 
  + ** 2008-2010 specials *** : the next doctor , planet of the dead , the waters of mars , the end of time parts 1 & 2, 
  + ** series 5 ** : -, 
  + ** series 6 ** : a christmas carol, 
  + ** series 7 ** : the doctor the widow and the wardrobe , the snowmen, 
  + ** 2013 specials *** : the day of the doctor , the time of the doctor, 
  + ** series 8 ** : -, 
  + ** series 9 ** : last christmas , the husbands of river song, 
  + ** series 10 ** : the return of doctor mysterio , * 2017 christmas special *, 
  * the 2008-2010 specials and the 2013 specials basically each make up a mini season on their own but could be considered parts of series 4 and series 7 respectively . 
  you 're actually right . 
  and i was referring to the official information indeed and what you said is true . 
  especially episodes like last christmas which should have been in s8 . 
  really ? 
  some time ago i noticed that the first teaser ( the one with lemony ) has the same music with this [ fb featurette video ] ( https://youtu.be/v8aycm6wbhi ) ( around 1:05 ), 
  but it has been a great year for television anyway , i.e. 
  westworld , stranger things , so the lack of doctor who could be replaced . 
  mary 's gon na become mr robot ... 
  how did sherlock not recognise his sister ? 
  why did n't he recognise his sister ? 
  what . 
  omg you 're right . 
  they are standard music tracks used by many shows for the trailers only ... 
  anyone can use it . 
  that track was n't in the fb movie and it wo n't be in asoue . 
  i think . 
  when the final scene began , before she even said anything suspicious , my sister said : `` she 's the one who visited sherlock ! '', 
  and i laughed at her for mixing those two actresses up but then she was right and i was shocked . 
  meanwhile , my deduction skills can be seen by how i was screaming `` she 's moriarty ! '', 
  while she was taking her contact lenses off . 
  this is the video they had released a few days ago , only this time it 's not square . 
  really ? 
  i did n't even notice ... 
  which ones ? 
  it 's pretty negative , but !, 
  will arnett and cobie smulders * are * the ones who were in that photo and the ones who will be at the center of the side story !, 
  vanilla flavored desserts is still not working though . 
  we learn 2 new things :, 
  + daniel handler 's cameo role will be `` fish head salesperson '', 
  + shirley gets a surname , `` st. ives '', 
  really ? 
  i did n't catch that when i saw it . 
  where is this from ? 
  oh thanks , did n't know that . 
  damn , how did that happen . 
  sorry , but i really disagree for the most part . 
  i love both book series and i ca n't imagine how anyone would say that olaf 's final scene had more impact than snape 's . 
  while snape had hints of a backstory even since the philosopher 's stone ( how james had saved his life some years ago ) , and then in books 3 , 5 and 6 , olaf was a pure villain all the way through the penultimate peril , when the death of his parents was first mentioned ( correct me if i 'm wrong on this ) . 
  the only thing that made the audience not hate him that much is he was pretty funny . 
  even with the reveal at the end of the end , i really do n't think anyone should like olaf ( nor snape , of course ) , but yes , he does have more sides than we thought he did . 
  and i think harry potter does a better job at making snape a controversial character since the beginning ( harry was sure he was evil while dumbledore and most adults trusted he was n't ) . 
  now , the real olaf of harry potter is of course voldemort , who is a more one-sided character than both mentioned before , and he 's the type of villain who does n't get a backstory to prove he 's good in some regard , instead he gets one to reveal how he turned out evil ( in the half-blood prince ) . 
  but , excluding this character , in the end , character development is more of a thing for harry potter and not asoue . 
  i want to add that i prefer asoue and i am a snape hater , but, 
   i mean unlike harry potter , the rest of the thirteen books did build up olaf 's character rather nicely so there were always the major hints that something was there , something tragic , something great , but you were n't quite sure . 
  is just wrong . 
  that never happened , he was a one-sided villain up until the 12th book perhaps . 
  they did n't , their guest gabe saw the first four to write a review of them . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.theperiodictableofawesome.com/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-review-tptoa-podcast-05/ ) is the podcast !, 
  the theme song is legit . 
  well i think the longest episodes are white christmas and hated in the nation ( 90 minutes ) . 
  san junipero is around one hour long . 
  ** edit : ** actually , white christmas is 75 minutes . 
  the entire world will get it at the same time ( when it 's 8am gmt ) . 
  ** edit : ** * if * you get it at all . 
  where i 'm from , not all netflix originals are available , but this one is . 
  they 'll probably reveal it 's not them in the last episode and they 've been trying to trick us . 
  sorry for bothering , but i have an important question . 
  do we learn beatrice 's identity in the first season ? 
  a friend of mine is currently reading the books for the first time , and she 's on hostile hospital . 
  i do n't really mind her seeing the whole `` parents may be still alive '' story the reviews have talking about even though that one starts in the books around the ninth book , but if the beatrice plot twist comes up early , i 'll tell her to wait until she 's finished the books . 
  thanks for the response !, 
  actually i just talked to her and she told me she has decided on her own to wait until she 's done with the books . 
  i 'm 16 and i first read the books around when i was 8-12 . 
  nope , it 's been confirmed that season 2 is books 5-9 ( 2 episodes each ) and season 3 episodes 10-13 ( again , 2 episodes each ) . 
  the length is perfect and if they are stretched to 3 episodes or more , it would be a disaster imo . 
  season 3 will be 8 episodes . 
  both the director and nph have confirmed it , as neil sounds like it 's quite exhausting so he wo n't do more than 26 episodes in total . 
  wow . 
  i think the two people at the end of the episode are going to be kit and dewey . 
  they forgot about bruce . 
  daniel handler around 27:00 !!, 
  we 'll see him in tss , that 's why , but i do n't mind either . 
  so will anrett and cobie smulders 's characters have 3 children ... are they really the baudelaire parents ?
