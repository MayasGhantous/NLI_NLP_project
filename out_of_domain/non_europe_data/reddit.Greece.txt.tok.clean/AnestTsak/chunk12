  `` call me ishmael '' oh god . 
  oh you 're right !, 
  i could n't think of anything else , i even imagined they might be lemony 's parents . 
  someone said they might be the quagmire parents . 
  oh they had a different ending !, 
  well at least that 's better than mr poe sending them to work at the mill . 
  they died in the fire that made the quagmires orphans . 
  that was perfect . 
  in the show it 's obviously his wife though . 
  it 's only in the books she 's his sister . 
  i just finished ... 
  so good !, 
  what is hdr ? 
  the actor who plays the hook-handed man is from swaziland . 
  well , actually , that 's * not * how daniel handler envisioned mr poe . 
  he did n't provide any character descriptions for most of the characters , not even the baudelaires , so that each reader could feel closer to the characters . 
  so , for example , a black kid could imagine the baudelaires as black . 
  there had to be illustrations , and the characters in them needed to have a race , so by making everyone white in them , there were no differences between the characters . 
  the only other way would be to make everyone yellow or something as if they were legos . 
  thanks . 
  not that the rest of the seasons will be relased on a friday the 13th , but these are the months that have one in the next 4 years :, 
  + october 2017, 
  + april 2018, 
  + july 2018, 
  + september 2019, 
  + december 2019, 
  + march 2020, 
  + november 2020, 
  no , you do n't understand . 
  if they made every character a different race , people would notice it . 
  if you see a picture of a black person and a white person , you * will * think , `` that 's a black person '' . 
  if everyone in the picture is the same race , you just ignore it , you wo n't go `` they are both white '' . 
  and anyway , did you really want everyone in the show to be white ? 
  she said `` wait until the readers of the daily punctilio read * that * !, 
  '' , which makes me worry they are going to merge her character with geraldine . 
  that 's a relief !, 
  i imagined her as rita skeeter too but only regarding her personality and the way she moves and talks . 
  i 'm my head she 's got long red hair . 
  okay then . 
  just one more thing . 
  what is the time period of the show or even the books exactly ? 
  yeah , probably . 
  well , if you watch the show and then read the books , you will lose all of the references , because they are the kind of lines that sound natural to newcomers and go unnoticed , so you wo n't have a `` ohh that 's what that was ! '', 
  moment reading the books . 
  i suggest you read the books first , but honestly you 'll enjoy it the same even if you do n't . 
  i like how mr poe does n't really give a fuck about the children at the beginning of the episode , he only cares about his job . 
  he 's even worse than in the book . 
  also , i am surprised jacquelyn disappeared after episode 4 , i thought she would have a bigger role , though she 'll probably appear in the next season . 
  also , a difference in the next season will be that the quagmires arrive at the school at the same time as the baudelaires , and i guess they might even share the orphan shack !, 
  ** edit : ** i rewatched the last scene and stayed for the credits . 
  sara canning is credited as `` jacquelyn ( dolores ) '' . 
  when was the name dolores even mentioned ? 
  was i not paying attention ? 
  i thought jacquelyn last appeared in episode 4 . 
  something else i noticed in the credits is dylan kingwell played both duncan and quigley , which will work since they never share another scene together from now on . 
  `` the incomplete history of secret organizations '' . 
  ** edit : ** oops . 
  we did n't see the last word of the title until episode 2 . 
  i just saw this comment was on episode 1 . 
  not a huge spoiler though . 
  did you finish the season ? 
  just keep watching . 
  that 's right , thanks . 
  there were exactly 5 henchmen even in the books . 
  thanks , i only knew that ishmael was named after some character from moby dick , but i did n't know any of the other stuff you said . 
  yup . 
  have n't watched it yet . 
  but the appearance yes . 
  true , but it 's still a bit strange he would send them to a non-relative . 
  [ book spoilers ] ( #b `` though sir is vfd right ? '' ), 
  i 'm not sure on the details on all of this . 
  i 'm pretty sure the reason they did it as such in the show is for it to stop being repetitive ( guardian after guardian after guardian ... ) . 
  / r/savebrendan, 
  in greek the word `` partner '' cant be translated into a word that means both the meanings that dh intended . 
  so when i first read the greek translations when i was younger i did n't understand what it implied ( it was translated into the greek word for partner meaning `` associate/colleague '' , obviously ) i do n't think i would have anyway though . 
  wait till episode 7 . 
  completely original !, 
  nph wo n't agree to do more than 26 episodes in total . 
  he said so in an interview . 
  and in the show , one of the kids says `` i wonder what that means in latin '' . 
  the baudelaire siblings are the only ones who can understand her . 
  yeah i noticed that as well . 
  yes , and possibly of the whole show . 
  i have the greek versions and things that are as detailed as the sebald code are probably not there . 
  but the books were translated pretty well in my opinion . 
  when lemony starts a sentence with `` there is an expression that says ... '' and then proceeds to explain this expression which usually has a metaphorical meaning , the translated text either translates this non-existing-in-greek expression , or , in case it sounds too silly translated , translates it to an already existing one with the same meaning . 
  the v.f.d. 
  initials are \u0395.\u0391.\u03a0 . 
  in greek and mean '' \u0395\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 '' , as for the other meanings of it , they try to keep the same meaning even though it 's often hard . 
  for example , `` village of fowl devotees '' is '' \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a0\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd '' , which means `` district of predatory birds '' . 
  ** edit : ** i saw another comment say the french one has a different eye logo for their respective letters and i want to add that that also happens with the greek one , though only once , in the first illustration of the carnivorous carnival . 
  the rest of the illustrations use the standard insignia from the original editions . 
  all books will be 2 episodes each , season 2 is books 5-9 and season 3 books 10-13 . 
  the last books will not be adapted into 3 episodes . 
  barry sonnenfeld , neil patrick harris and daniel handler have said so . 
  it 's been confirmed that, 
  + season 2 : books 5-9 ( 10 episodes ), 
  + season 3 : books 10-13 ( 8 episodes , * not * more for the last books ), 
  if i recall correctly , no . 
  the baudelaires translated for them and then the quagmires said that they 'll try to learn sunny 's language as well .
