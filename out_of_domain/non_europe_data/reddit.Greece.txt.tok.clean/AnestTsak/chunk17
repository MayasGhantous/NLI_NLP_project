  no , it 's what the other comment says . 
  we 've only seen this logo in pictures like [ this ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bezu9zgtrb4/ ) posted by members of the production team . 
  i 'm not sure where the picture you posted is from though , maybe a fan made it . 
  i have n't seen it but if you look at the list , you 'll see that there are maybe more person of interest episodes in the top 150 than there are of game of thrones and breaking bad . 
  also look [ here ] ( http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt1839578 ) . 
  almost every episode is above 8.5 and the majority is abobe 9 as well . 
  mad men is around spot # 30 , with a 9.3 and the sopranos is much lower , i think it has a 9 . 
  also , what about no . 
  what would she gain by stating a fake birth date ? 
  the flashbacks never happen again after the pilot . 
  the only really gruesome scene of the show is at the beginning of episode 5 but that 's all . 
  the link is n't working for me ... has the video been deleted or is it just me ? 
   with emmy season in full swing , netflix successfully petitioned the academy to allow the series to compete as a comedy , despite its hour-long episodes automatically qualifying it as a drama . 
  that 's good news !, 
  it might actually win something now !, 
  are n't there any examples after season 6 ? 
  like death in heaven ? 
  you could say it has something in common with twd since both are set in a post-apocalyptic world . 
  they confirmed tony hale is jerome and nathan fillion is jacques . 
  i think having a character do something as dangerous as what violet did on screen would encourage children to do the same and no amount of `` ever `` s would help change their mind . 
  it 's different on screen and on page . 
  though they could just have that happen in an entirely different , less dangerous situation and lemony would then be able to say the `` ever `` s. 
  i 've only seen him as buster in ad so it 's hard to imagine him playing a normal human being but i just found out he has 2 emmys so i trust them with this casting choice . 
  as long as his character is as different as possible from buster . 
  why is it so hard to understand that some people intentionally avoid any kind of promotional stuff ? 
  it 's quite the wise thing to do with this show since we 've gotten used to information leaks and trailers spoiling important future plot points . 
   sleep no more, 
  is gatiss making references to his own episodes ? 
  the tardis translates what they say . 
  question is , why is it translating when it 's not even there ? 
  http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/alpha_centauri_ ( the_curse_of_peladon ), 
  it 's not like anyone in this post complained about being spoiled ... perhaps op does n't mind if he stumbles upon a spoiler , but just happened to manage not to be spoiled about future episodes so far ... 
   he stays in contact with pip and squeak, 
  how do we know this ? 
  huh , i never noticed that . 
  killer pencil was absolutely terrifying and one of the episodes i always remembered clearly years after that ( before i started rewatching the whole thing anyway ) . 
  when that closet opened i always shat my pants ... 
   first , right before nora screams yes from the pod, 
  who said she screams `` yes '' ? 
  nope . 
  there 's no real answer to what she actually screams . 
  that would ruin the schr\u00f6dinger 's nora the writers wanted to achieve , with both possibilities ( nora lying or not lying ) on the table . 
  if you want to reference nora screaming `` yes '' you need to say '' * if * we assume she screamed ` yes ' ... '', 
  htgawm was sooo good on season 1 . 
  now it 's just hilariously bad and there 's no one that can stop it from running forever . 
  only if you 're caught up :, 
  [ spoiler ] ( #s `` so , wes died . 
  we were waiting for them to announce who the killer was for months , right ? 
  the writers sure knew who it was , they could n't have just killed of one of the main characters for shock value . 
  turns out that 's what they did . 
  i read an interview of karla souza ( laurel ) where she was basically saying that she and peter nowalk ( writer ) were discussing who might have done it a few days before the finale table read ( wtf ? ), 
  and she was like , what if it 's the father ? 
  and peter agreed and put that in the script . 
  he did n't have a clue who did it when he killed him , there was no plan about where tho story was going . 
  wes died for nothing and what pisses me off more than that is that he did n't find out about rebecca , a death that was , too , completely pointless . 
  it 's like season 1 was written by completely different people . '' ), 
  i totally agree but i wo n't stop watching . 
  it could have been a great mini series , but since they started adding more and more , i hope we get 10 more seasons just so that i can see what they might do next to keep viewers hooked ... 
  looks like technical boy got his front teeth back . 
  so she also became black because of having sex with kevin ? 
  just how powerful * is * that cock ? 
  i think op believes the machine existed before the departure ? 
  the visceral fantabulous debut one has the wrong link . 
  i think he means that he likes the lumic ones better because the classic ones look pretty bad ( when it comes to their appearance ) . 
  he 's not a god but even if he was , the arab one would be in mecca . 
  what we see is the american gods . 
  the jesuses ( jesi ? ), 
  we saw were n't the only ones on earth , just the american ones . 
  there 's a white jesus in europe too , perhaps a differential one in each country and also a asian jesuses in asia . 
  they did n't travel from there just to attend easter 's party . 
  they were in america already . 
  damon confirmed the finale takes place in the same reality the rest of the series does minus the international assassin episodes . 
  so what we saw happened while they were alive . 
  and the baby really is jill 's . 
  ** edit : ** iirc the baby was white but if laurie was pregnant with john 's baby it would n't really be , right ? 
  why is it a struggle to accept it 's jill 's ? 
  [ spoiler ] ( #s `` something i do n't understand . 
  why do you think the tilda swinton thing becomes more likely because of what you said before that part ? 
  not that i mind it being true but i do n't get what it has to do with the refusing regeneration bit '' ), 
  what about the magician 's apprentice and the witch 's familiar ? 
  the bells of st. john , the doctor 's daughter/wife and the rest mentioned in this post do have something to do with the episodes but who is the magician 's apprentice ? 
  clara ? 
  she was n't the main focus of the episode . 
  is she also the witch 's familiar ? 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  i see . 
  i think it 'd be great !, 
  but very unlikely though . 
  to be fair the illustrations also showed her do what she did in the movie/show . 
  i see . 
  also i could never picture what she did with her hair when she tied them up so it might actually be impossible to be shown on screen or it 's just me who was confused . 
  how did it happen with ten ? 
  [ sure he is .

  do n't think what you mean is devros either . 
  you * would * mind that and i would say that 's okay . 
  but you ca n't say that every straight man would mind it just because you do . 
  not minding it does n't mean getting a boner because of it . 
   he 's probably still waiting as we speak .
