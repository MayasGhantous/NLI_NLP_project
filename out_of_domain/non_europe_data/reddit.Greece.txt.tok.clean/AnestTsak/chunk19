  because of this , i do n't think it was he who planned their deaths but it was definitely arson and not an accident . 
  i do n't think this is mentioned anywhere . 
  it really is n't ... 
  i 'm like 99 % sure . 
  lol i posted these two days ago but the post never appeared apparently . 
  5 specials . 
  really ? 
  i need to watch that part again then !, 
  thanks , 
  i agree that it could be good . 
  what i 've learned this year is that adaptations can be good even if they are n't faithful to the source material in every aspect of the story ( after watching a series of unfortunate events ) . 
  good thing we did n't get this one instead then . 
  you 're probably pissed off he 's voiced by a japanese actor in the anime , are n't you ? 
  c'mon it 's not that bad . 
  you 're right about everything you said but surely cersei getting haircuts off-screen is not `` skipping character development '' ... plus , she also did that last season as well . 
  lol the first i heard of the word wights is when i went on reddit after the latest episode . 
  you can argue this : they 've never told us in the hp universe that whatever happened , happened . 
  so while hermione 's time turner does work like in lost , the time turners from cc do n't . 
  it 's not a universe where only one of the two can happen , it just depends on the specific device they use . 
  still trash though . 
  i 'm dumb, 
  what was the christmas carol rumour ? 
  oh sorry i 'd heard of that but i thought op was referring to some rumour that fans had around the time the * episode * a christmas carol was going to air . 
  my mistake . 
  where were these hidden all this time, 
  according to some articles i found it is indeed her ( cristin ) !, 
   they were both in season 2 of fargo as well but i 'm not sure their characters ever met . 
  how ? 
  nph said that but i doubt it is true . 
  if it is the most expensive show on netflix i 'd like to know what all the money was used for . 
  / r/natureisfuckinglit, 
  i watched this the other day and this is exactly what came to mind . 
  why do you keep writing nora in capitals ? 
  they 're not initials, 
  the title of the video said season 2 at first . 
  i did n't even type it ; i clicked `` suggest title '' . 
  i did n't notice it when i posted . 
  he asked to have his family back or something similar , damon said so . 
  no way they 'll release it two months after filming ends . 
  last time it was 6 months . 
  also , how can we avoid the cold feeling in our mouth in order to be able to do those things ? 
  i would like to ask if `` the whole story '' dvd set for region 2 includes all the special features ( those for each season and the ones that are exclusive for `` the whole story '' ) . 
  around 21:00, 
  i was wondering , where did the [ vfd symbol ] ( http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.13514370.7340/fc,550x550,white.u1.jpg ) appear in the books ? 
  i have the greek versions ( which include all illustrations ) and i never noticed it anywhere . 
  thanks . 
  i have noticed that the higurashi special arc `` utsutsukowashi-hen/reality breaking arc '' only has 3 chapters available in english . 
  acording to its [ amazon description ] ( http://www.amazon.co.jp/%e3%81%b2%e3%81%90%e3%82%89%e3%81%97%e3%81%ae%e3%81%aa%e3%81%8f%e9%a0%83%e3%81%ab%e6%80%aa-%e7%8f%be%e5%a3%8a%e3%81%97%e7%b7%a8-%e8%a7%92%e5%b7%9d%e3%82%b3%e3%83%9f%e3%83%83%e3%82%af%e3%82%b9%e3%83%bb%e3%82%a8%e3%83%bc%e3%82%b9-149-3-%e7%ab%9c%e9%a8%8e%e5%a3%ab07/dp/4047139963/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&qid=1438971313&sr=8-1&keywords=9784047139961 ) , the tank\u014dbon edition contains 154 pages , howerver the three chapters which can be found [ online ] ( http://mangafox.me/manga/higurashi_no_naku_koro_ni_kai_utsutsukowashihen ) only have 99 pages together . 
  can anyone help ? 
  could someone who has the japanese volume translate ? 
  also , [ here ] ( https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e3%81%b2%e3%81%90%e3%82%89%e3%81%97%e3%81%ae%e3%81%aa%e3%81%8f%e9%a0%83%e3%81%ab%e6%80%aa_%e7%8f%be%e5%a3%8a%e3%81%97%e7%b7%a8 ) is the japanese wikipedia article about the story arc , could someone translate the [ '' \u5358\u884c\u672c '' ] ( https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e3%81%b2%e3%81%90%e3%82%89%e3%81%97%e3%81%ae%e3%81%aa%e3%81%8f%e9%a0%83%e3%81%ab%e6%80%aa_%e7%8f%be%e5%a3%8a%e3%81%97%e7%b7%a8#.e5.8d.98.e8.a1.8c.e6.9c.ac ) paragraph ? 
  might help . 
  thanks . 
  could someone translate a paragraph from a [ wikipedia article ] ( https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e3%81%b2%e3%81%90%e3%82%89%e3%81%97%e3%81%ae%e3%81%aa%e3%81%8f%e9%a0%83%e3%81%ab%e6%80%aa_%e7%8f%be%e5%a3%8a%e3%81%97%e7%b7%a8 ) ? 
  thanks !, 
  i noticed many people were asking about the mother 's total screen time but no one had really done it so i decided to do it myself !, 
  8x24 | something new : 23s, 
  9x01 | the locket : 3m 22s, 
  9x02 | coming back : 1m 55s, 
  9x08 | the lighthouse : 1m 26s, 
  9x09 | platonish : 2m 49s, 
  9x13 | bass player wanted : 7m 14s, 
  9x16 | how your mother met me : 19m 24s, 
  9x18 | rally : 1m 48s, 
  9x22 | the end of the aisle : 1m 19s, 
  9x23 | last forever - part one : 5m 3s, 
  9x24 | last forever - part two : 8m 24s, 
  ** total screen time : 63m 27s **, 
  edit : i 'll add the mother 's appearances before episode 8x24, 
  3x01 | wait for it : 11s, 
  3x12 | no tomorrow : 4s, 
  5x12 | girls versus suits : 2s, 
  7x17 | no pressure : 13s, 
  8x13 | band or dj ? 
  8x20 | the time travelers : 1m 31s, 
  so , including the mother 's appearances in flash-forwards in seasons 2-8 , we have a total screen time of ** 64 minutes and 58 seconds **, 
  for some reason , short stories featuring james , sirius , lupin , peter and lily ( sometimes snape as well ) are really popular on tumblr . 
  they 're also really annoying !, 
  ( : the thing is , we know nothing about these characters , apart from what we learned in ootp ... 
  so why do n't fans just make up stories about the trio ??? 
  ( or even about the next generation ? 
  since people do n't want the story to end really ) . 
  [ example 1 ] ( http://incorrectmarauderquotes.tumblr.com/post/136712159249/james-evans-youre-my-co-head-youre-eventually ), 
  [ example 2 ] ( http://plagiarisedmischief.tumblr.com/post/136682353328/james-i-know-a-shortcut-lily-you-dont-know ), 
  [ example 3 ] ( http://questionsofmuggles.tumblr.com/post/136721955895/what-are-other-peoples-theories-for-why-peeves ), 
  [ and the worst one of all , which made me make this post ] ( http://prismatic-bell.tumblr.com/post/136728554896/goldentruth813-27snowflakes-rowena-on-broadway ), 
  most magical beings have been explained as representations/personifications of people or objects . 
  these are :, 
  * beatrice is actually sayo . 
  * bernkastel is probably ikuko 's cat . 
  * the seven stakes of purgatory ( asmodeus , beelzebub , belphegor , leviathan , lucifer , mammon , satan ) are inspired by the servants in the mansion ( asune , berune , benon , renon , runon , manon , sanon , respectively ) . 
  * the goat butlers are the personification of random opinions in the future , all of which want the island 's tale to be a tragedy . 
  * the chiester sisters ( i.e. 
  00 , 45 , 410 , 556 ) as well as sakutarou are actually maria 's toys . 
  * ronove is actually genji . 
  * virgilia is actually kumasawa . 
  * eva , ange , battler and maria are obviously eva , ange , battler and maria . 
  * gaap is the personification of the idea that `` things often vanish '' . 
  * erika could be the `` anti-fantasy persona of ange '' , according to the end of the manga ( only implied ) . 
  * featherine is actually the witch form of ikuko , or both ikuko & tohya .
