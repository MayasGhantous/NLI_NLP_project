  in greece there is no sex ed , ever . 
  only biology lessons about reproduction . 
   the 6 ' 2 figure, 
  i thought they used the metric system in russia . 
  it 's 1.88 m, 
   the whites were descendants of europeans who had created a majestic civilization . 
  the former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements . 
  this reminded me that i do n't know anything about african cultures . 
  could someone suggest some major ones ? 
  i only know about the ancient egyptian . , 
  i 'm pretty sure * that * is supposed to be the mistake, 
  that 's really deep bro . 
  that happens in greece too . 
  why is greek colored the same as german ? 
  they never showed this in my country . _ . 
  dude , this is not deep , it 's real . 
  can someone please eli5 ? 
  i see , thanks , 
  is there any way you could find it ? 
  edit : [ i found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/himym/comments/220v1w/the_story_of_tracy_and_ted_all_the_mother_and_ted/ ), 
  jesus is one in a minion ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  i know . 
  there was nothing closer to attica ( next is northern cyprus , which is n't a country either ) and i just wanted to make this . 
  it 's not an administrative region , but it is n't part of central macedonia either . 
  it 's different in many ways though . 
  for example , there is no equivalent of the pope in mount athos ( the patriarch is in istanbul if i 'm not mistaken ) . 
  also , there is no mayor or anyone responsible for the area apart from the greek state and the eastern orthodox church in general . 
  the biggest difference is that mount athos is the most sexist place in the world , since it is * illegal * for woman to enter it . 
  i would consider as * countries * the following :, 
  * the 193 un members + the vatican and palestine, 
  * greenland and french guyana, 
  * taiwan , kosovo and the sadr, 
  however i included south osettia because it was the closest one . 
  i have no idea . 
  originally greece was split in * geographic regions * based on traditions and history . 
  even then , * kythira * ( the island you are referring to ) was considered as part of the ionian islands . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/greeceregionsenglish_corrected2.png ), 
  the [ greek geographic region of macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( greece ) is based on history and traditions . 
  i do n't see why both ca n't keep the same name . 
  there is the republic of macedonia and right underneath it the region of macedonia . 
  the greeks are arguing that fyrom was never in the ancient macedonia , ( which is really stupid , since the ancient macedonia was all the way till asia ) , but even so , i do n't see why they ca n't choose this name . 
  i 'm greek and every time i say something like this , people look at me angrily . 
  edit : apparently i ca n't put a link that contains a parenthesis . 
  the correct link is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( greece ), 
  i know , right ? 
  luxembourg is * so * irrelevant !, 
  six . 
  ep1 ) the magician 's apprentice, 
  ep2 ) the witch 's familiar, 
  ep5 ) the girl who died, 
  ep6 ) the woman who lived, 
  ep7 ) invasion of the zygons, 
  ep8 ) inversion of the zygons, 
  did n't he appear in the name of the doctor too ? 
  at the beginning of the episode , when clara says `` i blew on this world on a leaf . 
  i 'm still blowing . 
  i do n't think i 'll ever land '' . 
  it 's actually almost 23,000 km ^ 2 larger than nk . 
  i see , thanks . 
  is there any downside in samsung galaxy j5 ? 
  everything seems great , even the price . 
  should i get it ? 
   learning an endangered language can bring back the dead, 
  ok then . 
  i finally found the place to ask this - is timothy a girl 's name too ? 
  whenever i find a guy named timothy it feels weird because i think i 've heard it as a girl 's name , but i ca n't really recall any examples . 
  ( i do n't live in an english-speaking country ), 
  he said china !, 
  [ again !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdrfe9i8_hs ), 
  i swear i saw this picture with you and your friend photoshopped out of it on facebook 10 minutes ago ... 
  edit : [ i found it ] ( https://www.facebook.com/jennalouisecolemanpage/photos/a.139874609471413.26194.139811049477769/787757508016450/?type=1 ), 
  oh wait ... their expressions are different , they were probably taken from another picture , but still , it looks photoshopped . 
  [ proving you wrong ] ( https://youtu.be/-u3jrs-uhuo?t=2m30s ) . 
  that way 2 christians die . 
  oh right ... 
  it 's just that the creator probably ment that reading it and then not doing anything means ignoring . 
  that 's so deep . 
  it 's a video . 
  hold on , i 'll check if it 's on youtube . 
  edit : nope . 
  it 's not . 
  why ? 
  some people also just find it disgusting and they think this is a reason to be against it . 
  it 's not like all atheists are n't homophobic ... 
  guys i 'm not good at this ... can someone explain what the creator ment ? 
  or is it just some random pictures to make the images more annoying ? 
  did they just say `` shit '' on doctor who ? 
  at the beginning , when that guy died , the girl said `` you messed up the controls on that shit '' or something like that . 
  this episode reminds me of * the impossible planet * / * the satan pit * and * 42 * . 
  nice . 
  wow . 
  next episode seems perfect . 
  it 's not a ship though . 
  it was an underwater station on earth . 
  scotland , i think . 
  what happened ?? 
  ... but she had n't passed yet . 
  she was there .
