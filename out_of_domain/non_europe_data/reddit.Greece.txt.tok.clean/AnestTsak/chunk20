  * cornelia and gertrude were explained in twilight by erika , willard or the goats ( not sure ) . 
  i ca n't remember what they were ... ( does anyone know ? ), 
  however , there have been some characters that ( i think ) have n't been explained . 
  these are :, 
  * dlanor, 
  * zepar and furfur, 
  * willard, 
  do you have any theories about what those could represent ? 
  a teacher told me about a movie she has watched but she ca n't remember what it 's called . 
  a swedish doctor goes to an african country to help people and there he meets a cannibal who likes to rape pregnant women after he has killed them . 
  meanwhile his wife ( who is a doctor as well ) hires a filipino babysitter to help her raise her child . 
  what is this movie called ? 
  basically something like what doctorwhotv.co.uk is for doctor who . 
  this is how it could be done ( assuming each episode lasts approximately 45-65 mins ) :, 
  ** season 1 : books 1-5 **, 
  * episode 1 : tbb chapters 1-4 . 
  it ends with the baudelaires crying after the dinner . 
  it should have a lot of filler moments with count olaf . 
  * episode 2 : tbb chapters 5-13 . 
  * episode 3 : trr . 
  * episode 4 : tww . 
  * episode 5 : tmm chapters 1-5 . 
  ends with claus having to go see dr orwell for the first time as the orphans are that the building of her office is shaped like an eye . 
  more of the life in the factory is seen and more characters are introduced . 
  * episode 6 : tmm chapters 6-13 . 
  * episode 7 : taa chapters 1-7 . 
  ends with count olaf forcing the baudelaires to run all night , while they 're wondering why he 's doing that . 
  * episode 8 : taa chapters 8-13 . 
  the quagmires revealing the initials v.f.d. 
  would be a nice cliffhanger, 
  ** season 2 : books 6-10 ** ( esm\u00e9 joins as the fifth main character ), 
  * episode 1 : tee . 
  * episode 2 : tvv chapters 1-8 . 
  ends with the baudelaires seeing zac dead . 
  * episode 3 : tvv chapters 9-13 . 
  * episode 4 : thh . 
  * episode 5 : tcc chapters 1-6 . 
  the baudelaires find madame lulu 's archives . 
  * episode 6 : tcc chapters 7-13 . 
  * episode 7 : tss chapters 1-7 . 
  quigley reveals his identity . 
  * episode 8 : tss chapters 8-13 . 
  ** season 3 : books 11-13 **, 
  * episode 1 : tgg chapters 1-8 . 
  the baudelaires notice the medusoid mycelium in sunny 's helmet and the queequeg gets captured by the carmelita . 
  * episode 2 : tgg chapters 9-13 . 
  * episode 3 : tpp chapters 1-6 . 
  the episode focuses on what each of the orphans discover in the hotel . 
  * episode 4 : tpp chapters 7-10 . 
  ends with dewey getting shot and the trial about to start . 
  * episode 5 : tpp chapters 11-13 . 
  * episode 6 : te chapters 1-5 . 
  ends with kit 's arrival at the island . 
  * episode 7 : te chapters 6-11 . 
  * episode 8 : te chapters 12-14 . 
  what do you think ? 
  i do n't think this has ever been asked , at least in the last year . 
  i would say :, 
  the penultimate peril, 
  the end, 
  the slippery slope, 
  the vile village, 
  the carnivorous carnival, 
  the hostile hospital, 
  the grim grotto, 
  the ersatz elevator, 
  the austere academy, 
  the bad beginning, 
  the miserable mill, 
  the wide window, 
  the reptile room, 
  ( though i love all of them ),
