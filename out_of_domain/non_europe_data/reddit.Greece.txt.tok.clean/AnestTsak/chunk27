  i want to watch a german show with german subtitles and my teacher said tatort is quite good . 
  but it literally has 1000 episodes , so what should i do ? 
  could i start with the newest season and when it 's done go see the previous one etc. 
  [ removed ], 
  the beginning of the song [ `` resistance '' ] ( https://youtu.be/tpe9usffxri ) by the band muse sounds a lot like the hbp soundtrack piece [ `` dumbledore 's farewell '' ] ( https://youtu.be/nlnqd707fnw ) . 
  i tried googling it and i have n't found anything useful . 
  are the two connected in any way ? 
  on page 95 of the ua we see a picture of sailors and their names are stated under it . 
  one of them ( in the third row ) is called sailor scieszka . 
  could he have any connection with jacquelyn ? 
  i noticed this a while ago but i was n't sure if someone else had posted it already . 
  ** edit : ** also i meant `` una * u * thorized '' in the title ... 
  this can be done by reading a chapter and then watching the corresponding scene ( or the exact opposite ) . 
  just follow the time stamps i have marked for each episode when you 've read that chapter . 
  note that it would be best if you 've already read the books * and * watched the show at least once . 
  ** the bad beginning **, 
  + episode 1, 
  + chapter 1 : 01:15 -09:07, 
  + chapter 2 : 09:07 -21:20, 
  + chapter 3 : 21:20 -33:48, 
  + chapter 4 : 33:48 -47:28, 
  + episode 2, 
  + chapter 5 : 01:15 -14:17, 
  + chapter 6 : 14:17 -19:22,
