  [ it was n't long before 9gag stole it ] ( http://imgur.com/7rbjyds ), 
  this is an old tumblr post . 
  downvoting . 
  the first one is 85-89 % maronites and the second one is 90-99 % . 
  `` cis '' is short for `` cisgender '' and i think it 's pronounced `` sis '' . 
  it means when someone 's gender matches their biological sex . 
  cabin in the woods is n't a horror movie ... 
  i thought it was ethiopia ... 
  nick offerman and aubrey plaza . 
  how old is rigsy supposed to be ? 
  the time lords, 
  clara 's theme is playing . 
  guys , it 's over for her . 
  screwdriver ? 
  what 's the spirit thing that laughs ? 
  but ... 
  even according to christianity the picture is still pretty wrong ... 
  the creator probably thinks that `` unplanned '' = `` not aborted '' . 
  the birth of jesus is supposed to be part of god 's plan , thus making it not unplanned . 
  also , so people think that women who abort babies might be carrying baby jesus ? 
  this pic was really stupid . 
  2012 had 366 days tho . 
  wow , very open-minded of you !, 
  but it was n't really clear . 
  sorry i do n't know much about poland . 
  you do n't make any sense . 
  maybe [ this ? 
  ] ( https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4338168/1/enough ) idk . 
  ** edit : ** [ also relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/2v3yw8/poster_calls_james_potter_a_rapist_and_someone/?sort=new ), 
  that 's my point actually ... 
  the way james is shown in those fanfictions seems out of character from what i pictured in the books . 
  thanks everyone  i guess i will just not read the fanfics xd, 
  what do you mean ? 
  no but for some reason netflix is n't available there . 
  i see , thanks !, 
  all of the eastern mediterranean sea is covered in spots . 
  did they die in the sea ? 
  that 's what i meant . 
  i confuse the two words even in my first language . 
  you 're right , thanks . 
  wow , that 's a lot !, 
  thanks , 
  hey op , i 've got bad news for you . 
  you spent 3 months making these , only for 9gag to [ steal your post ] ( http://m.9gag.com/gag/arabmw2?ref=fbp ) . 
  was it a child labor joke ? 
  i thought it was a `` chinese people are smart '' racist joke . 
  alan rickman ; _ ;, 
  they have n't announced best actor , actress , director and picture yet . 
  \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 leo take my energy \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  yeah but 10 seems the younger of the two because * the doctor * is younger . 
  so river does n't mean that his face looks younger . 
  it 's not based on a book . 
  the existing book is a hogwarts textbook with no plot . 
  the movie plot is completely original . 
  struck by lightning, 
  what happened ? 
  sherlock , breaking bad , lost , how to get away with murder , and game of thrones are all far better than shameless . 
  maybe htgawm is n't as good , but what about the others ? 
  i eat pizza slices using a fork . 
  sorry , i meant to say : something like what doctorwhotv.co.uk is for doctor who . 
  i see . 
  how is ancient greek an easy language to learn ? 
  its syntax can kill people . 
  the image is crooked . 
  these are actually pretty tasty . 
  because he 's still the showrunner for series 10 . 
  his last episode will be the christmas special of 2017 . 
  moffat is going to do the 2016 christmas special , series 10 and the 2017 christmas special . 
  that 's when he 's leaving . 
  chibnall will start writing in series 11 ( 2018 ) . 
  what is that one greek island in the aegean that is catholic ? 
  we know exactly how many times she regenrated . 
  the first one was in new york in `` day of the moon '' and the second one in berlin in `` let 's kill hitler '' . 
  that 's all of it . 
  we see the original melody [ regenerate ] ( https://youtu.be/q0rg5k-fojq ) in the end of dotm in an alley . 
  later [ when mels regenerates ] ( https://youtu.be/za_znwhch4q ) in lkh she says : `` last time i did this , i ended up a toddler in the middle of new york '' . 
  so she was referring to the one in dotm . 
  it was staged . 
  that 's how . 
  what the fuck , op . 
  nothing has been confirmed but i hope they do n't change a lot of things . 
  also , the austere academy is the best one to have as a season finale . 
  the vile village is a great season finale indeed , though i do n't think books 5-7 could be one season on their own . 
  they really have very few things happening . 
  the ersatz elevator for example could never be stretched to three episodes . 
  [ astoria . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  [ from what i 've heard it happens during the play 's plot but we never see the actress . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  wait , how ? 
  can someone explain to me why the play on tuesday was not considered the premiere ? 
  why is the 30th of july the premiere when the first performance was this week ? 
  the reptile room , the wide window , the miserable mill , the ersatz elevator , the hostile hospital and the carnivorous carnival could never be more than 1-2 episodes . 
  be realistic . 
  at least the plot is pretty epic . 
  exactly how long was each part ? 
  also could someone who was actually there say whether they liked it or not ? 
  also , guys , just enjoy it !, 
  we all know that the only real canon are the seven books .
