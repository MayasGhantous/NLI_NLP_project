  pottermore , the play and the fantastic beasts movies are just extra stuff because j. k. loves us and wants to make more money . 
  thanks !, 
  i still like it , however it is n't one of the best imo . 
  lrgo harry finaly gets a nice haircut !, 
  you should add never tell me the rules !, 
  why ? 
  yes , i enjoyed the last half of the series more than the first half . 
  there 's a link in the description . 
  2004 , before the book series had even ended . 
  malina weissman ( violet ) is 13 . 
  emily browning was around 15 when they filmed the movie . 
  the thing is that if they want to make a series with multiple seasons they will need the children to still look like children as the seasons go by . 
  if the series has 3 seasons and the actress playing violet is 15 in the first season , she would soon be an adult . 
  also am i the only one who thought jim carrey was great ? 
  though i think he would n't be able to kill shirley off . 
  you 're welcome . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  2 times the whole show and 3 times the final season . 
  you should try them actually . 
  they 're pretty tasty . 
  what ? 
  they are . 
  food is food and also do n't discriminate based on minions . 
  i 'm talking about the candy . 
  the minions still suck and i would feel better eating the candy if they were n't printed on them . 
  mods take care of this post . 
  please delete it . 
  oh ok , thanks !, 
  i 'll edit that out . 
  though i do n't see why everyone keeps saying that it 's confirmed that the first season will only feature the first four books . 
  i hope they have the austere academy too . 
  is there a source ? 
  i see , thanks !, 
  ravenclaw/horned serpent !, 
  please can someone tell me exactly how the pukwudgie is pronounced ? 
  thanks !, 
  what is the background we have on ilvermorny 's sorting ? 
  no , he said that her name was crossed off because she became a mother . 
  sorry , at first i thought you meant that the reason was an accidental line on the wall . 
  you 're welcome , 
  thanks , 
  you 're welcome !, 
  it 's too soon for esm\u00e9 . 
  we know the first season will also have the fourth book ( and i hope the fifth one as well ) . 
  a ) rose . 
  in my opinion it is one of the worst episodes on nuwho . 
  i found the plot was too dumb and also everything about plastic mickey was cringey . 
  b ) my favourite one of series 1 is tec/tdd so this is the one i 'd like to see win . 
  but i also would n't mind dalek . 
  c ) rose , aol/wwt and bt . 
  these are the ones fans often hate but i think aol/wwt was okay . 
  dalek , fd , tec/tdd and bw/tpotw will probably stay . 
  d ) it is definitely a good idea !, 
  i usually like to see the tennant specials and the 2013 specials listed separate from the series , but i think for this game you should list them as part of series 4 and 7 . 
  and the rest of the christmas specials as part of the series that comes after them ( thors is series 9 though ) . 
  wow , people hate father 's day so much ? 
  i remember that in the second episode the doctor and susan were confused about why it was a police box in a way that clearly implied that it happened on that trip . 
  why do you think skyler was a bitch in the final episodes ? 
  in the first seasons she was a bit annoying to me because i found walt 's actions reasonable and also because of the thing with ted . 
  in the last season i actually hated walt a lot so i loved her for being against him . 
  i 'll rank each series 's episodes separately because all of them is pretty hard . 
  the ones in bold letters are my all time favourite ones and the ones in italics are the really really bad ones .
