  ( off-topic ) to evangeline : what are your favourite episodes and seasons of lost ? 
  actually i think nick 's golden buzzer counts so it 's 5 golden buzzer acts . 
  how did bw/tpotw get eliminated when it only had 47 % ? 
  it was the last round so it has to have at least 50 % . 
  sorry i meant that ( at the time i commented ) you mentioned at the top of your post that it had 53 % but on the bottom that it had 47 % so two different numbers . 
  no it 's not . 
  why are bookstores open on sundays ? 
  is it just where i live that they are closed ? 
  especially on midnight ... 
  play .
