  if someone could make numbers 5 & 6 clearer ... 
  that 's not the same helen . 
  years after they broke up john found a call girl with the same name/using the same name to bare with his loneliness . 
  wait , how does it answer walt ? 
  but it does n't explain why he was n't in the flashsideways . 
  but it was after they died so it was n't exactly an alt reality either . 
  fair enough . 
  link ? 
  v i n c e, 
  because it 's a play , i do n't think such details matter . 
  the only arcs that can be done in such way are watanagashi-hen and meakashi-hen ( which are n't completely the same , e.g. 
  the way keiichi and shion meet ) . 
  the others are not related with each other in any way ... 
  do n't forget lupin ... 
  we should have a thing similar to / r/breakingbad 's, 
  v i n c e, 
  for things like this . 
  how is it pre-existing content ? 
  i had n't read the whole article and i thought everything was gon na be original . 
  yes i totally agree with you . 
  so what ? 
  those are already in the correct order in the anime , manga and visual novel . 
  op wants to rearrange some arcs . 
  i think a lot of time has passed between hatsubushi-hen and the later arcs since hanyuu was only able to revive rika for a few months by the last arcs , however in himatsubushi-hen she went back 5 whole years . 
  i 'm not sure about some of these . 
  a lot of things happened in the 25 years between 1995 and 2020 , so some events we do n't know about led to her being the headmistress . 
  snape was a potions professor , why would n't he be ? 
  or maybe voldemort let him teach dada . 
  perhaps in the evil reality , during the battle of hogwarts or before ( probably during , since everything before that happened in a similar way to the original timeline ) snape showed harry his memories and he told ron and hermione . 
  though snape could have altered his memories so idk . 
  i think what happened is neville did n't kill nagini because he 's dead and so when harry defeats voldemort in the great hall , voldemort escapes and uses the horcrux . 
  at some point later he kills him . 
  i agree with what you said . 
  i 'm probably forgetting something , but why do you believe he is bi ? 
  i 've finished the series and i hope you do n't feel that this is a spoiler , but i do n't think this whole thing ever comes up again . 
  that 's true , i had never thought about rika in the flashbacks . 
  you 're right . 
  then it becomes very complicated and op 's question is n't illogical after all ... 
  my biggest fears :, 
  + it does n't get a second season because they might delay the production a lot so the children become too old . 
  + something that will probably happen : they do n't manage to bring back one or more of these characters because of the actors ' schedule . 
  + bruce and carmelita for the slippery slope, 
  + phil for the grim grotto, 
  + justice strauss , charles , sir , nero , mr. remora , mrs. bass , jerome , mr. lesko , mrs. morrow , geraldine julienne and hal for the penultimate peril, 
  it 's her left eye . 
  this is a very late response but about the job thing :, 
  in many places gay people are n't protected from getting fired from their work because of their sexuality . 
  though it 's true that straight people are n't either . 
  when we talk about laws regarding this issue we mean that no one should be able to get fired because of his sexuality . 
  * any * sexuality . 
  the thing is , we usually refer to this by mentioning gays because it 's not like straight people are going to get fired because they are straight . 
  but if this was ever to happen , they should be protected as well . 
  * equal * rights , not * more * rights for gays . 
  so , the law that should exist is a law that protects every sexuality , not just homosexuality . 
  i seem to have misunderstood what i thought your post is about . 
  what is your unpopular opinion exactly ? 
  well , i 'm 16 ... 
  i 've seen plenty of movies but i generally stay away from the ones that have the reputation of being `` bad '' . 
  john wick and poltergeist do n't have that reputation . 
  it is the `` bombinating beast '' . 
  you should read atwq , the books deal with lemony 's childhood in vfd . 
  he probably has a chance to go if he fills in a new application . 
  after she finished with harry potter she was on the tv series downton abbey which ended last year . 
  neville is a herbology professor . 
  i think it 's not clear what snape was in the alternate timeline . 
  i had a few more in mind to include , like the dismal dinner , but i did not know about that one !, 
  thanks  i 'll add it later . 
  it 's not complete yet !, 
  yes and he also has some other music as well !, 
  but i 'll add it later . 
  ... are you sure he did ? 
  i ca n't find info about it anywhere ... 
  there are many authors in the list but not him . 
  i see . 
  it 's weird that it 's the only place he is mentioned . 
  perhaps there are even more books he contributed to but he is n't mentioned in their description ...
