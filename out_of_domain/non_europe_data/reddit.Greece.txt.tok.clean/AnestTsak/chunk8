  you 're welcome !, 
  i think he means :, 
  eleven : amy 's choice ? 
  ( though it 's not really eleven ), 
  twelve : hell bent ? 
  ( or kill the moon ), 
  well the others are different from each other as well , for example the gba one . 
  i just do n't want my list to be very long ... 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll probably remove the jim carrey website ... 
  what site do you think i should use for movies ? 
  i have goodreads for books though that one is n't always reliable as well . 
  i know imdb is n't the best site ... 
  this is what i 'll do : i 'll have the netflix site for the series and i will keep the imdb one for everything else ( since there 's a lot of false info for the series there ) . 
  and i will add the film 's website at the bottom of the post . 
  does anyone know the name of the actor at 0:55 ? 
  the one frank calls debby . 
  i 've seen him somewhere before , maybe even on shameless and i do n't remember him . 
   12 hour movie, 
  the whole series lasts less than 8 hours . 
  i think snicket wrote these down when he was young , perhaps as the events were happening . 
  his writing style is very different , he does n't even define words . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about ... what exactly is the book on your bookshelf ? 
  i found a couple of such books on www.fantasticfiction.com . 
  imo they do n't belong to the list ... 
  i always thought it comes from babe . 
  well actually , no . 
  the others * did * have an excellent surgeon . 
  his name was ethan . 
  yeah that thing seemed odd to me . 
  why would he send him . 
  what ? 
  in greek there 's no letter for `` j '' so we combine the letters \u03c4 ( t ) and \u03b6 ( z ) and use \u03c4\u03b6 ( tz ) instead . 
  yes , they both find out at some point but i do n't want to spoil anything . 
  one of them finds out very soon !, 
  i * think * the reason he refuses is never made clear but it could be something like the first thing you said . 
  not the second . 
  keep watching and stay away from reddit until you finish !, 
  what are you asking ? 
  yes , there are 62 45-minute episodes so the whole series lasts around 45 hours . 
  2790/60 = 46.5 though the episodes ' duration is not exactly 45 minutes . ), 
  the series took place in less than a year but i think dh should have made it much longer so i agree with you, 
  that was kind of a plot hole , since books 8-12 took place in less than two weeks but they are often described in a way that suggests it was longer , i.e. 
  the kids notice that mr. poe looks older , even though they had n't seen him for 2 weeks only . 
  sunny went from bite baby ( vile village ) to excellent cook ( slippery slope ) in 6-7 days . 
  i thought about it again and it could have taken place in 2 years ( minus a few days ) if we suggest that violet and klaus 's birthdays were a few days before their parents died and that the kids ignored one sunny 's birthdays/it was n't mentioned by the author . 
  i will probably make a timeline on this sub soon . 
  each of books 7-12 takes place in less than 3 days because the narration does n't really skip anything ; we are the children wake up , do stuff and then go to sleep . 
  also every book starts where the previous one ended . 
  i was listening to the movie 's soundtrack ( again ) while studying earlier today and for the first time i noticed one of the tracks was called `` verisimilitude '' and i wondered what that could mean . 
  i now saw your comment and it was creepy how you answered my question . 
  season 2 will probably be longer than season 1 . 
  stranger things ( netflix ) season 1 ; 8 episodes , season 2 ; 9 episodes . 
  i hope they 'll do something similar with asoue . 
  however , i 'm still a bit sceptical about 2 episodes per book . 
  i can imagine tbb and tmm , and in some extent tww being 2 episodes long , but i believe trr would actually need * less * than 1 episode even . 
  it probably has the shortest plot of all . 
  i think that in the last episode , the baudelaires will go to prufrock and meet them and then the season ends . 
  that way they can explain why the baudelaires will look older in season 2 , because they were at the school the whole time . 
  but why would olaf be so many months late in finding them ? 
  [ \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 ] ( http://lyk-ekkl-neapol.thess.sch.gr/ ), 
  i 'll edit that , i was n't aware there was a vancouver , wa . 
  i know , there 's a few other things i have in a list but i 'm too busy to add them !, 
  :p i will soon . 
  all netflix shows are like that !, 
  so i guess they 'll have to release it on friday the 13th of october 2017 !,

  it was actually mentioned in the vile village , which came out 3 years before the movie . 
  also avi lake as isadora and dylan kingwell as duncan . 
  they posted on instagram that they have been filming even though they should n't appear in the first season . 
  it 's not a remake , it 's an adaptation of a book series . 
  i know about all these , i have a list of some other things as well but since school started a month ago i have n't had the time to update . 
  perhaps i 'll do it today or in the weekend !, 
  sorry are you joking or are you just stupid ? 
  i must have watched the trailer over 100 times but i ca n't understand exactly what count olaf is supposed to be saying ... can someone help ? 
  all i understand is `` joy , joy , happiness , my fortune ( s ? ), 
  _________ ( change ? 
  that 's probably it , thanks !, 
  why ca n't people understand this ? 
  fantastic beasts is not an adaptation of anything . 
  it has nothing in common with the book except for the title . 
  they are not squeezing anything out of anything . 
  the story is completely original . 
  nothing in common with the book . 
  that 's like saying tolkien squeezed 3 lord of the rings books and countless companion books out of the hobbit . 
  the greek one is not very wrong , but it sounds weird . 
  i think only google translate could do something like that . 
  '' \u039c\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5 \u03a4\u03b6\u03b5\u03c6 '' ( me lene jeff ) is the best way to say it and it means `` they call me jeff '' . 
  '' \u03a4\u03bf \u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a4\u03b6\u03b5\u03c6 '' ( to onoma mou einai jeff ) is also correct and it means `` my name is jeff '' . 
  though this one would sound a bit weird if someone actually said that irl . 
  the occasion in which this could be used is when you write a letter to someone you do n't know and you want to introduce yourself in it , i.e. 
  the mayor or something . 
  awesome episode !, 
  can someone explain to me what the title of the episode means ? 
  thanks , that 's what i thought it was . 
  just always wait for 3 `` credits '' ( idk how to say it ) to appear and then there 's usually an extra scene .
