  4 ) thanks a lot man !, 
  hey dank i really feel sorry man to hear about it !, 
  i think you should fight this as soon as possible !, 
  and i also think that many people here will be more than willing to help you ( me included as i had a friend of mine going through this ) . 
  we could all suggest sime ways . 
  for example i think it would be nice if you keep a journal ( irl or in this post or whatever ) which you 'll update frequently writing your struggles . 
  reading your own tough words might actually be healing for you, 
  tbh i do n't look up to anyone . 
  i just like people who started from nothing and became something !,

  supporting a team is never about the titles . 
  it 's all about the good and bad momments . 
  being a champion is easy for a fan , but you show your devotion when your team struggles . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.espnfc.com/story/1417650/aek-athens-relegated-after-points-deduction ) happened to my favourite team in 2013 . 
  it only made me a more hardcore fan !, 
  a bruise or two ... 
  salut to this guy !, 
  chalcedony maybe ? 
  great looking crystals !, 
  :d mine are not that good-shaped, 
  turan made a huge mistake when he was transfered to barcelona . 
  he had his spot in at . 
  madrid and went there knowing he will always warm the bench . 
  huge mistake in my opinion . 
  hiis career is on free fall, 
  yes i know . 
  and that 's why it bothers me . 
  anyway it was his choice , also atletico made some good money out of him so who cares ? 
  thankies mods !,
