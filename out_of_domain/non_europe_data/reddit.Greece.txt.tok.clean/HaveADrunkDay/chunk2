  bought cs on summer sale ' 16 . 
  got 125h bbut no medal yet !, 
  cheers to you mate !, 
  yeah . 
  i 'm not i a hurry anyway :p altough it 'd be nice to get one , 
  i 'll go with dc . 
  not that i hate marvel , but imo dc is more mature . 
  it 's characters are not black or white . 
  also , they put more depth on their storylines ( used to ) and now that rebirth event has me all pumped up . 
  what did marvel do instead ? 
  civil war - the sequel . 
  i mean , come on marvel !, 
  no imagination at all : / i want both of them to be great though , because more competition = more great stories !, 
  dis good !, 
  keep up !, 
  i lol 'd, 
  that 's a baseball dive !, 
  mlb should hire him .
