  ? people are putting items on market either because they are bored of them or because they earned them from bets . 
  you got a nice argument right there.elaborate more next time because now you look like an idiot . 
  so you would buy a treasure and risk even more money if you it will become marketable in one week?sorry dude ... i wouldnt be the idiot that will make everyone happy.its not about the 10 dollars ... its about egoism . 
   a good language to study, 
  as a student i am trying to choose my 4th language and russian is one of my options but these sanctions destroy the market . 
  only greeks are awesome guys.i am awesome . 
  the funny part is that generally in russia they have a high percentage of english speakers.i dont understand why in dota you rarely see someone speak . 
  for invoker , qop and sf i watch [ keiser ] ( https://www.dotabuff.com/players/86761682 ) ... this guy is actually crazy . 
  ~ 7k mmr, 
  well ... in lane he will be good if he max his missile and spam it but with maxed missile he will be useless for his own team . 
  you are unable and unwilling to read the comment above yours . 
  dota is way harder than lol.even in this subreddit people admit it and probably thats the reason they chose lol ( because its more casual ) . in order to be able to speak about dota and make a post like this you need hundreds of games ( when i say hundreds i mean more than 500 ) and to watch a lot of pro games.otherwise you are just a scrub who played 10-20 games and you think you understood something.you didnt understand shit and you dont know shit . 
  stay in lol ... 
  or vice versa . 
  what is this ? 
  what material is this blue thing ? 
  so , you want to invest money in dota and you pick one random tier 3 american team?in europe there are 4-5 tier 2 teams without sponsor ... 
  dude ... if i count what valve does right and riot does not you will start wondering why you play this game . 
  if you are willing to learn the game then play ... i have to tell you that is way more complicated than league.good luck ... 
  the thing is that we dont expect the patch but the notes.moreover , with the new engine we dont know how things work ... 
  10 hours ago was 7 am . 
  if in your country its 4pm now that means that 10 hours ago was 6am . 
  dire has advantage in late game.early / mid game radiant wins . 
  muh maths kappa, 
   too smart for that, 
  and he comments . 
  literally retarded . 
  wtf do you even mean with rng ... 
  what valve does right and riot does not ? 
  1 ) heroes/champs are free, 
  2 ) game is not p2w, 
  3 ) replay system, 
  4 ) proper engine ( muh adove air ), 
  5 ) sandbox mode, 
  6 ) coach mode, 
  7 ) custom games, 
  [ read this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a5tnk/riot_isnt_sitting_on_their_hands_but_it_certainly/ ), 
  as for difficulty dota is a much deeper game and everyone in this subreddit knows it.one of the reasons they stick in lol its because its casual and it doesnt need 500 + games to say that `` now i start to understand something '' . 
  i play both games.dont be idiot ... 
  vp fucked some musican asses . 
  judging by his last games with his new team ... yes . 
  [ game 1 ] ( http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1993292092 ), 
  [ game 2 ] ( http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1993385716 ), 
  anyway ... the downvotes speak from the selves.you are just a lol fanboy . 
  `` lol is not pay to win '' . i died ... masteries , runes , unbalanced heroes/champs that you have to pay to use is the definition of p2w morron . 
  i agree with you . . when i started to watch pro games back in april i didnt know shit.i didnt even know what `` 322 '' was.we need a guide . 
  its 6 am now in seattle ... rofl.icefrog is still sleeping ... w8 him to wake up , drink his coffee , go to the office , masturbate and then we will get the notes . 
  what happened ? 
  you can buy ip that can be used to buy runes though.normally let 's say you made 200 imbecile points in one day.buy a peasant booster for 5 bucks . 
  now you made 500 imbecile points in one day.you just spent 5 bucks for 300 imbecile points . 
  cash was just used to buy runes . 
  can u understand that noone says that dota is a better game?i say like all normal people that dota is a more difficult game.it is on you what you will choose.if you want a casual game you will choose lol , if you want something difficult that requires thousands of games and hours of watching pro games to say that you start to learn then you will play dota . 
   because nobody stacks there, 
  found the 1k mmr guy, 
  shadow demon rocks if you got a beastmaster/invoker/kunka / +1 hardcarry . 
  best combo ever . 
  dont look my last 10 games ... it wasnt me, 
  [ 61 % by the way ] ( https://www.dotabuff.com/players/290401090/matches?date=patch_6.85b&amp;hero=&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=europe%2fminsk ) even with them, 
  yeah i suck at him ... i am trying to learn es and visage these days . 
  i dont play 10 games per day in lol ... when i play lol ( rarely ) i will play 1-2 games . 
  i am from the phone at you made me fucking search for explanation from lol players here you are . 
  lets see a list of differences :, 
  - lasthitting is way way harder , although you end up being able to do it , you have to consider that the attack animation for each champion is different , and missile speeds for the ranged attacks are also different . 
  also the damage you do is comparable to minions , while in lol its significantly higher . 
  - there is also denying , lasthiting your own low hp minions to deny xp/farm from your enemy, 
  - forget about using any skill to kill minions until at least 15 mins in the game , skills cost like half your mana , and the regen is relly really low, 
  - towers do little damage , 2 heroes can easily dive you even if you are full hp . 
  also they dont stack damage like lol towers . 
  - mage abilities dont scale ( there is aghanim but that is another history ) , so most of the mages are good at early game , and at late they are just used to cc and block others . 
  - you can miss ranged attacks against heroes which are in higher terrain than you, 
  - farmed carries become insanely strong, 
  - the jungle is full of strange mechanics like making its monsters chase you until you reach your own minions so that your minions help you kill them , so you can change the equilibrium of the lane and your enemy wont get farm/exp . you can also make the monsters chase you and if the monsters are not in their original place by the xx :00 seconds ( where xx is minutes ) then they respawn again and you have 2 sets of monsters so you can farm more.also , if you put a ward or any other unit in a respawn place of monsters , they wont respawn . 
  - there are lots of items with activables that completely change playstyle , items that makes another hero or urself change position.one item can completely change the game and your position . 
  - cooldowns are longer and there is no cdr , so you must not waste your skills for nothing . 
  - the abilities of the heroes are overall more complicated , there are almost no abilities that are just a gapcloser , or just damage , they usually have many effects , so you really have to know all abilities to play against them . 
  - ranges and aoe are massive compared to lol, 
  - you can destroy trees in the map , effectively changing terrain in the middle of a fight or to juke the enemy heroes . 
  - they dont care much about some comps being op , or just synergizing too well , so you may end up facing a combination of heros in lane that just obliterate you , and there is nothing you can do unless someone comes help . 
  - you have to start with many consumables and regenerative items , because hp/mp regen are abyssmal, 
  - more mechanics like the heroes take quite some time to turn around or they get kind of stuck after casting their spells , so you have to cancel the animation , the field of vision isnt symetric , so if you are in a higher place you others and they cant see you but you can . 
  - you lose gold based on your level when you die, 
  - backdoor protection unless you have creeps nearby, 
  - the meta is different.heroes / champions do not have one role but can have many making it difficult to guess what the other will play ( for example silencer can play mid or carry or support ), 
  - the laning meta also varies.you can play 1-1-1-2 or 2-1-2 or 1-1-3 or 1-2-2 . 
  - there are hereoes/champions that require insanely mechanical skills like meepo , invoker , earth spirit , chen , enchantress , visage , wisp , broodmather , chaos knight , natures prophet , phantom lancer , naga siren , beast master.all these heroes can not be able even to be programmed in lol due to lack of a good engine . 
  there are lot more , but i dont have time right now to state them, 
  well i dont agree with the guy but there are also plenty reasons to do not avoid meat . 
  when did you stop ? 
  edit : kisses to mama merkel . 
  this game will never be perfectly balance.it is just impossible . 
   one hits everyone, 
   pa flair, 
  # i am blind ... i cant see shit.only doom 's dick.welp !!!, 
  # where are the fucking notes .

  but this is a shitpost ... its a [ disasterrrrrrrrr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3elxglltpp0 ), 
  valve trolled us . 
  we are waiting for a new patch ( new heroes , balance changes etc ) and they just posted a picture with the name of the update ( 6.86 ) without the patch notes .
