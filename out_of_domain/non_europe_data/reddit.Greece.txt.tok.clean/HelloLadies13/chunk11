  valve is trolling ussssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss for the first time . 
  this is an announcement of an upcoming patch . 
  it 's literally nothing because it 's a running joke whenever we get a new , small , bugfixing patch , without new content , such as new heroes . 
  prior to this , this sub was/is full of shitposts avaiting patch notes , so i hope you can understand the excitement . 
  also , there was nothing wrong with this patch , it just that it got stale and we want things shaken up a bit with new balance changes !, 
  show me your pretty ass !!,

  we get patches every 3-4 months . 
  go waste some money on champions , go beg riot for replay , voice communicator , sandbox mode , custom games and a bit debt in your game and then come talk again.almost all of us have played league ... its the most shitty game of the world with a company that is literally draining your wallet.i still remember the [ crying ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a5tnk/riot_isnt_sitting_on_their_hands_but_it_certainly/?ref=search_posts ) of lol community . 
  sincerely ,, 
  the voice of logic . 
  dude ... go find a real girlfriend and stop wasting your time on tinder.fucking virgin nerd . 
  nerd faggot because i am 20 years old student and when i have time and no money i play dota ?? 
  ? if you had girlfriend you virgin faggot you wouldnt be on tinder everyday.ugly bitch ... 
  edit : omg ... your post history is full of nsfw subreddits.yeah you are not virgin ... 
  so more advantage for radiant ? 
  that excitement ... i was going out with my guitar as i child.always only with one friend to get more money.now , the last time i was excited it was when i met my ex or the first day at uni . 
  v\u00e4nligen mr \u00f6dla, 
  he said plz mr lizard in greek . 
  one moment ... 
  i am a dota player that plays lol ( rarely ) because it is more simple and casual.if you implement the 1 ) ,2 ) ,4 ) you just make the game reallyyyyy more complex.if you want a more complex game play dota.many people here chose lol because its more casual.dont ruin the beauty of the game . 
  thx . 
  to the top we all go !!, 
  / r/all we are coming !, 
  we got new patch !!, 
  so how did you choose wk flair ? 
  hahahahahaha, 
  every 3-4 months vavle releases a new patch with major updates ( new heroes + map changes + buffs/nerfs to heroes/new items etc ) . this is one of them . 
  there is one more farming camp.its huge !!, 
  we are top tier now !!!, 
  or not ? 
  not after the rework . 
  he is not a carry anymore . 
  warlock was not decent . 
  yes because lol is the only game that has these features ... 
  i am not mad ... even your subreddit knows that dota is a better game and valve a better company.proof [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a5tnk/riot_isnt_sitting_on_their_hands_but_it_certainly/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a38ti/dota_2_just_released_their_custom_game/?ref=search_posts ) . they just play lol because its an easier game . 
  btw about your item we already have skills that do this.with this logic lol completely stole all the stuff from dota ( which is in one way true ) . 
  btw , go pay for some champions mate ... i am sure that maybe riot will add a bit more depth in your game if you give them some more billions , 
   bad players, 
  if you play with them you a re bad too tho ... 
  how is he a carry ? 
  arc warden is not a carry ... his damage is not that strong.he is not even good enough for mid.he is 4th . 
  we are not jealous rofl ... i was playing lol for 1-2 years.if i was jealous i would be back . 
  people are playing lol because it just came earlier than dota 2 and because dota has a huge learning curve that requires 500 + games and many hours of watching pro games to even starting to understand . 
  why dont you ask the lol players for example and stop saying bullshits that you dont even understand ? 
  you havent played dota 1 clearly , 
  i wont argue with you.lol is a good game for players that want something more casual than dota and more difficult than hots.dota is a good game for players that want something difficult.thats the gameplay differences . 
  now your client sucks , you dont even have replay system etc. . . and you pay for champions.better go play smite . 
  ~ ~ if i wanted double midas i would get ld that can split push , he is more tanky etc. . . ~ ~, 
  yes you are right ... anyway i might be wrong but i dont think that we will see him in core position.tag me , bag me and i will eat one condom if he does . 
  you havent play dota 1, 
  by the way when did you play dota 1 ? when you were 10 years old?because according to reddit you are still a child . 
  anyway ... good night.as i said lol is a good game for casual players.dota is a more complex and if you had brain you would understand that all these things you mentioned above as `` bad '' things add depth to the game.its common logic . 
  i told you that you didnt play dota 1 because u are still a child according to reddit.expect if you played with pros when you were 10-12 . i dont play dota for 5 years.i started dota last year ( and i ve played a bit dota 1 before ) after i played lol for 1,5 year . 
  good luck with your life . 
  oh gosh ... why i even bother ... ?? 
  ? here is the prof that you are a [ kid ] ( http://prntscr.com/9epko3 ), 
  by the way ... its fan to have a friendly `` fighting '' for a game but dont speak like that to people you dont know.i am 20 years old and i am not virgin.also i study economics and yes i dont have a job and i am from a poor country like greece.i can buy champs but i prefer to do not because as a student i prefer to drink extra beers . 
  the reason that i am saying all these to you is because when you grow up and leave your house and start to see how is the life when you leave alone you will see that judging people and whole nations is really bad . 
  good night kid.i wont answer to you again.stop acting like an asshole . 
  all heroes are slower you fool.it doesnt change anything . 
  this survey is useless ... i answered `` too soon '' everywhere . 
  i was thinking about that too ... anyway . 
   happy little trees are you fucking kidding me, 
  he read this and after a while when he read about the double regen he said `` oh its awesome '' . 
  so you agree with him or not ? 
  if i wanted a simple game i would continue to play lol or go to play hots and smite.i came to dota because it has more depth and its more complicated . 
  noone will pick void ... 
  nop ... probably tomorrow but we dont know for sure.if you can not wait download the test client try some stuff . 
  its 7 gb ... go [ here ] ( https://steamdb.info/app/205790/ ) and press the green button, 
   i just really want to expand my moba library . 
  thinks in dota doesnt work like that.dota requires too many games to even starting to understand whats going on.if you are here for 1 week then you wont learn anything . 
  dota is the most complex moba out there.if you are not willing to learn then dont play . 
  awieubnugtbawghbawuhbegawgeawega its hear hype, 
  his e is a joke ... seriously . 
  `` man is but a glimmer ; and he :, 
  c ) ** fades away **, 
  ** man is but a glimmer ; and he fades away like the wind . 
  holy shit spartan ... dont do this to your self.leonidas would be ashamed . 
  max q first and put 2 points on e then start maxing w and e together . 
  i ve never been to lp ... guess why ... 
  because i dont call the others shitstrains.you deserve lp . 
  because its difficult.if there was a line between difficulty in mobas it would be like this :, 
  moreover , it has better client , features than all the others and you have all champions from day 1 for free without ip boosters for runes , thats why.if you want something more difficult than lol then try it and otherwise do not.it requires too many games to even starting to understand what is going on.if you are willing to do that play . 
  it is ... you can play custom games.i didnt get why its not enjoyable.the most enjoyable games are the first you play because u are shit and u dont care about that . 
  where did you see the superiority?we just say that dota is harder and league is more casual.even in league 's subreddit people agree with that.its up to you what u want . 
  so dota is not bigger than hots and hon in china?thats why it has the largest price pool even in this shitty event . 
  this [ crossfire ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/20/crossfire-tencents-top-earning-free-to-play-game-youve-never-heard-of/ ) ? 
  this is from 2013 only for the chinese server . 
  i am pretty sure it was the biggest patch in doto.at least you got your santa hat kappa, 
  or in the enemy team .
