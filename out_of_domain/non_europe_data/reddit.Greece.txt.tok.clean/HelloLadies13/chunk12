  it will be 3:30 in the morning here.i will act like you didnt deliver . 
  no logic gaming wo n't have invite to qualifiers.madara and spartan left the team.moreover i believe that alliance will have a direct invite, 
  lmao i can do perfect eul combos without script as most invoker players.just play more invoker and you will get used to it.you do n't need script and do n't be so sure that your opponent had a script . 
  you ca n't do anything . 
  one andy salad plz, 
  i love the trolls, 
  oh gosh ... to all the 15 years old kids : do not listen to this guy.you will never be a pro . 
  even if you are 7,5 k + mmr it doesnt mean you will succeed.there are many pubstars out there that left school/college and earn 5-10k per year from tournaments.it does n't pay off . 
  lmao ... i was stomping in very high skill in unranked but i still calibrated at 3,5 k. . . ranked is way more difficult . 
  at one point i was playing with 4,2 k guys and i had 70 % winrate.that means that i was 300 mmr away from the maximum calibration.there is a huge difference . 
  like hots looked like but it is dying even some months after it 's release ? 
  hahahahahahahaha !!, 
  yeah leave the game ... its obvious that you are not better than the people you are referring to.if someone is toxic i just mute him and i do n't rage back.you do ... you are toxic too . 
  you lost 325 mmr in 3 days because you are bad ... 
  it 's the same like every other online game.have you played l2 , cs , cod , lol and these types of games?if the only contact you have with online gaming is eu 4 then i am not surprise . 
  try to learn 2-3 heroes at every position ( mid , carry , support , roaming support , offlane ) and also learn which heroes counter them.you need to be able to have a good hero pool that will be increasing with the passage of time.learn what items to buy and in which stage of the game your hero is strong ( early , mid , late ) . youtube videos can help you !, 
  you dont have a replay system and you want ability draft ( it exists in dota 2 for years now ) . riot has fucked up your minds . 
   league, 
   mechanical, 
  yeah ... in dota most of your items will require to press a button to use them.lets not speak about meepo etc , courriers etc. . . 
  what is your point exactly ? 
  aaa there is a sign ?? 
  ? ouf ... i thought that we are taking advantage of your history in order to boost tourism . 
  ok if it belonged to his relatives then that 's why.got it !, 
  yeah ... lifting is very difficult.i am pretty sure it requires cheat to do it !!, 
  ! also stealing is really difficult too ... i mean how can u press one button?there is not such thing in dota ... 
  they should n't . 
  no ... you are delusional and think you deserve more than what you are.i was calibrated at 400 mmr and know i am 3k5 . i keep increasing my mmr . 
   when i 've done this again , people have complained at me for wasting my mana and cds on people and that it 's not worth it . 
  in dota u need to go back as less as possible.if both you and the enemy go back it does n't really worth it.you need to use ur skills smart and take advantage of situations.for example hit the enemy when he is near creeps in lane so if he attacks you the creeps will hit him and he will lose much more hp than u will.this is a very common way to deal with the enemy offlaner in laning stage . 
  all these only of you play core position.if you play support spam ur skills and go back.it is worth, 
  hello ... just do n't play mid.play safelane and u need to be able to judge what itembuild you will get.if the enemy has a really early push/fight lineup ( sf , dp , shaman , dj etc ) do n't go bot , go treads and drums.then go bf and blink -  deadalus.if they got many disables and you are not lower than 3k prefer manta over linkens because your enemies wo n't be idiots.when you see many melees you can go skadi as well and do n't be afraid to buy bkb when they have too much burst dmg . 
  the biggest mistake of es players is that they go full damage without thinking.moreover always use your remnants and do be afraid to farm !!, 
  ! the hero is a god in early game/late game but trash in mid game.dont be afraid to sacrifise your team in order to gain the most from mid game . 
  i am only a 3,5 k scrub but i got 70 % wr on es at only 40 games . 
  here is everything you need to know -  [ welcome to dota you suck guide ] ( https://purgegamers.true.io/purge/welcome-to-dota-you-suck/ ), 
  fuck your luck ... good luck tho.just believe !, 
  me too ... cant see the brackets, 
  biblethump ... what was the score?was madara 's dick too big ? 
  old london conspiracy https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdl_rfxpqu, 
  i hope invo took fb ... you would be hyped :p, 
  how is steak and adfinem doing?soz i am from mobile, 
  thx for your posts, 
  ok now let 's make 31 more posts for all the other teams . 
  its completely the same . 
  ** all pick ** -  gif 10 bans !!, 
  ! seems right, 
  greek here ... lol is insanely big and that 's why dota is not so much.cs is a fps . . lol does n't affect its popularity . 
  learn to read stats plz ... it does n't say that.lmao, 
  lmao ... you ve never played dota ... 
  you are doing pretty ok !!, 
  ! 56 % wr is pretty good for a new player !!!, 
  the easiest way to improve is to watch pro games or very high mmr pubs!watch the game from the perspective of the player you are interested ( carry , support etc ) and watch his movements , farming patterns . 
  your last hitting needs to be improve too !, 
  ! when you play carry/mid you need to have over 50lh at 10th min !!, 
  ! also learn to judge what items you will take based on your enemies.for example if you play ember and the enemy team has orchid then you need to take manta.if the enemy team has orchid +2 -3 more disables you need bkb . 
  map awareness is also important!watch the map all the time and if you see many heroes missing hide because they probably coming for you.learn to always click on enemy heroes to see what items they are going to . 
  that hurts ... lmao, 
  20 % of dota 's players are from russia.now imagine that dota has a bigger player base than cs.you got your answer, 
  well there is something wrong then.russia has 15million active players in steam.cs has sold 28.000.000 copies from the day it released and has 350.000 average daily players.it is a bit hard 8 million of them to be from russia.isnt it ?? 
  ? on the other hand dota 60.000.000 people have downloaded dota without counting china ( 15 % of playerbase ) and has 560-600 .000 average daily players ( without counting china ) . if you take into account that 20 % of dota 's player base is from russia then there is something wrong with the site . 
  hey ... we are normal people like you . 
   paok, 
   fight turks, 
  does n't make sense ... / s, 
  many asthmatics live in athens ... you will be fine but it 's true that the air has a poor quality.if you are european you will have free medication so you can count on it . 
  welcome to greece, 
   its seriously the 1 thing we are missing in this game, 
  i died . 
  i drive the last 4 years without a licence ( poor student -  dont want to give 600 euros ) ... thats freedom . 
  yeah ... when i finish uni i must waste 1 year of my life to go to the army otherwise i must pay 6k euros.then , if i want to have a proper job i must go to work abroad.fuck my country ... 
  what ? 
  i ve been ... i remember paying 2-3 euros for 500ml water . 
  do you want to feel the atmosphere of diretide ???

  the third leg of halkidiki is less crowded than the other two but has beautiful beaches.you can go there.otherwise you can go at the second one but you must plan your vacation a little earlier and not in mid july-august . 
  greek here ... you both say the same thing with different words . 
  i was talking about hades and tartarus.you are right too i was talking in general.i ment that hades and tartara are in the same place . 
  do you have any idea how many bugs lol has ? 
  i would say avoid athens.come to thessaloniki ... the town is pretty big ( 1,5 million people ) , cheap food , crazy night life and the rents are pretty low ( 180-220 euros for an student apartment at the center ) . i cant guarantee that you can find work tho anywhere in greece.you wont have problems with racism at all ... 
  if you want a smaller town corfu and rethymno are perfect . 
  avoid heraklion unless if you dont mind to live at one of the ugliest places in greece.if you want to live in crete chania and rethymno are the best options . 
  even the map has changed ... good luck adapting :p, 
  i didnt know that taking powerhouse position , making war at irak and afghanistan and fucking with middle east ( military and economically ) causing the terrorism we see the last 15 years are good things.good job m8 ... you got it all right !!!, 
  by the way us is even responsible for 7 years of junta in my country that caused tortures , deaths and exiles . 
  i am from greece actually ... imo since 1946 i dont think anyone has done worse things than us . 
  what ? 
  well , russia and china didnt invade irak and didnt kill 1,5 million people by lying to people about hidden nuclear weapons.sure they ve done many similar and bad things but not even close to what us has done.dont get me wrong ... american people are good guys.they just happened to live in a very strong country.if it wasnt us it would be someone else.i dont get why people get so sensitive when someone tells them that their nation has done bad things.its not like they did ... 
  you went for the gas ... we know , we all know . 
   stop acting like ** we ** just went to iraq just to murder people . 
  that 's not what happened . 
  i am pretty sure u can invite her but she cant, 
  wealth usually means houses ... you dont want to own a house in greece ... believe me . 
  houses are pretty cheap compared to what they were before 7-8 years and the market is completely dead.the thing is that we have a tax called [ enfia ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/enfia-tax-greece-new-symbol-austerity-2014130124545458507.html ) which basically tax your house at the price of 2007 . if you house back was worth 300k euros and now 150k euros , you will get taxed at the old price . 
  well if u think that dota has 12 million unique month players and china is the 10 % of dota playerbase according to steam then dota is not top 5 . 
  this is a myth ... their 3rd party platform is connected to steam api, 
  dota 2 harder than eu 4 ?? 
  ? are u kidding me ??
