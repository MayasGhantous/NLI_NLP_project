  ? nothing is harder than eu 4 ... 
  i am guessing that you mean schools like the schools that are popular in ireland/malta that you go there for holidays and you also learn the language.this concept is not popular in greece but you will find something ... i hope . 
  well , every human is different ... its not like we are growing up in a product line.there is no `` culture '' in these things ... just talk to him ... if he is not on the same page he will tell you.if you met his friends tho it probably means that he already thinks that you are in a relationship . 
  well , i wouldnt meet the girl i fuck for fun to my friends unless if it was coincidental ... but as i said every human is different . 
  4k guy here that had this attitude.if you afk 20min farm there is no problem.i do it too ... the thing is that almost in every game there are 2-3 situations where you can tp and take 2-3 kills.if you see that situation and u stay afk farm then yes ... you are idiot and you dont improve.thats what raised my mmr.to be able to recognize opportunities in the game better than the others.think about it.you tp and you win the early team fight or you stay afk farming and you lose the early team fight . 
  it sucks tho ... its p2w and with graphics of 1,6 counterstrike.it was popular in europe before 4-5 years.i was playing it my self.it sucks ... 
  just because many people play it doesnt mean its good ... 
  elaborate ... 
  i assume that he made the account in source 1 but never played with it.the accounts that are transferred from s1 dont need to reach level 50 trophy.they need less games for some reason . 
  he just never logged in dota or logged in for 5 mins or something.he owned the game from his previous account so he didnt have to . 
  socialism has nothing to do with communism dumbass ... lmao.political awareness = 0, 
  spetses or ydra is the island with the rocky beaches?i am confused and can not remember :p, 
   austerity was the only real choice, 
  not this kind of austerity tho ... even imf said `` sorry , we fucked up '' ( noone believes them ) 3 times until today .

  yeah so sick ... he just did what every visage player does . 
  go study maths plz , 
  25 * 800/55 ,09 / 100 = 3,6 mmr per game . 
  you got 5,09 % chance to really win 25 mmr .13,7725 is just wrong . 
  edit : this is at 800 games ... you got 60 % winrate at ranked games but only 160 . that means that it will be more than 3,6 but not 13,77 ofc ... around 5 mmr per game .

  it is much more common because they are the 15-20 % of dota player base you dumbass . 
  chinease streams + nearby regions that are the 10 % + of playerbase are not on your list.that makes the possibility even bigger . 
  moreover , because its `` in '' for russia it doesnt mean that other regions dont have boosters.they just dont stream.i mean ... how dumb can u be ? 
  dude ... you really did a this whole post and said nothing.you need to stop the speculations.you are the one who must give clues that the ratio between russian boosters/people that pay them and the rest is  1 . you cant so stop acting like you can.saying that they stream a lot is not a clue . 
  yeah dude ... you are right at everything.the clues that you gave are so clear ... you counted all the russian boosters and all the foreigh boosters and divided them with the percentage of playerbase.good job ... 10/10 . 
  good night .

  we are fucked tho ... 
  tsipras did a lot of damage but the debt was already unsustainable from the very beginning.the imf 's predictions were wrong all these years damaging the economy way further than what was expected . 
  i personally believe that the only way to solve the migrant crisis is to fix the problems at their countries ... but that requires help and coordination not only from the eu but from turkey , russia and us .

  just wanted to add some things to / u/corsair78 's answer . 
  noone is getting loans anymore ... 
  we have no money because pensions have been cut by 40 % , we have 25 % unemployment ( 50 % at young people ) and wages are shit . 
  how about to come and live here with the 300 euros that a young person takes when he works and get paid `` under the table '' ? from these 300 euros pay the 200 for rent . 
  thx for reminding me why i dont open this sub.people here are fucking delusional ... omg . 
  mhm , how about to make the complains to your government?i didnt ask for 300bn bailout.you gave them to save your banks back then , while having [ the knowledge that the debt is unsustainable . 
  ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis ), 
  no you are wrong.back in 2010 papandreou asked for referendum and guess what , he was forced to resign the next day because `` there was no time '' according to europe.you are still missing the point tho ... the complaints to your government that knew whats was going on.moreover , complain more to imf that [ fucked up ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-admit-mistakes-greek-crisis-austerity ) even more . 
  i guess you didnt know all that because the brainwash is strong with fucking generalizations like `` greeks are lazy '' . 
  i am not ... i provide evidence about the fuck up of europe.i am pretty aware that my country was doing really bad for the past 40 years.but this crisis ( of the last 6 years ) is not only our mistake.you can see the links for example . 
  i am saying that it would be better to make the debt back then sustainable with a debt restructuring.it would be less painful for europe.now , you got an unsustainable debt that europe has fed with 300bn . you are on the same point ... either you write off the debt or you let greece go bankrupt.the difference is that you lose way more . 
  seriously , if we had go bankrupt back then we would be better than if we go now.we had 25 % more gdp.it would be a disaster for europe tho ... 
  yeah ... and all italians are thieves , all germans are nazi etc. . . 
  dont even bother ... 
  / u/bank _ holidays believes that all greeks live with their parents , that there are jobs but we refuse to work , that we are all tax invaders and that we have ferarris hidden in our garage .
