  you need to keep in mind that the majority of greeks know that its mainly our fault that we are in this position . 
  the thing is that the last 6 years europe just made the situation worse.you will probably know that we are not allowed to implement any economic policy without europe 's permission and troika is our `` unofficial '' government . 
  i will give you 3 links that i keep for situations like this [ 1 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-admit-mistakes-greek-crisis-austerity ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis ) and [ 3 ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/154409/article/ekathimerini/business/secret-imf-documents-reveal-extent-of-concern-about-2010-greek-bailout ), 
  if you read these links you will understand that something is wrong about europe.i believe that noone had the balls back in 2010 to fix the greek debt by restructuring it because it would be a political suicide.so , they gave some huge loans from which the european banks got out of red . 
  today after so many austerity measures the economy can not survive.the unsustainable debt will lead us to the same situation as in 2010 . either you restructure our debt ( which now will be way more costly ) or you kick us out and losing the biggest amount of money . 
  when you hear `` reforms '' , they are mainly raises in taxes , cuts in pensions ( have been cut by 35-40 % already ) , cuts in salaries and barely any reform that will decrease the corruption etc.we dont even have collective bargaining in greece . 
  again , most of us ( i want to believe ) know that it is our fault but ... the last 6 years europe just fucked us even more . 
  sorry for my englenski . 
   and do n't apologise for your english , it 's miles ahead of my \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac !, 
  i am not sure if this is a compliment :d, 
  just saying that xcalibur was top mmr too when he joined fnatic.badman can play spectre at top level as xcalibur could play tinker ... i agree with that.what about the other heroes?would you risk it ? 
  pretty sure notail mentioned on an interview at the major that xcalibur was bad because his heropool was too small when they asked him about badman . 
  w33 was playing more than 1 or 2 heroes.he improved a lot the last 1 year.bulldog plays all offlaners decently but top tier 4 heroes ( ld , brood , np , beast ) . 
  if you are going to make changes seriously pick madara and spartan from af , kick artstyle and dirtyra and pay for their russian courses.you got two players that play 2 years together and have way more experience than badman.that 's just an example ... pretty sure you can find something less risky . 
  eh ... you already have 500 games + . its not like when you have 10 games that the system can not recognize your skill potential and put you one game at very high skill bracket and the next one at normal bracket.wins doesnt matter that much for the system.kda , stacking , movement , wards and smoke as support , lh/s etc matter way more . 
  yes and they did the right thing.there is no way to be a 4k invoker when you play at 2k mmr because you compete with 2k mmr players . 
  ftfy, 
  or not ... ^ ^, 
  stay away from rares !!, 
  hello ,, 
  i study in thessaloniki myself so you can ask me whatever you want.i doubt that you will have a problem speaking english.thessaloniki is a big city full of young people and the huge portion of the population speak english relatively well apart from the old people ofc . 
  the cost of living is really low.you will be able to find a student apartment in the centre for 150-200 euros.thessaloniki is also famous for the cheap food so if your family has an average american income you will be able to live like a king.you wo n't be able to find a job tho because there is 50 % unemployment at yoing people . 
  if the university of your choice is aristetoleio then i must warn you that the facilities suck !!, 
  ! of course the quality of the teaching depends on what you are studying.in addition if you will go to university of macedonia the facilities are really good . 
  if you want to do not look like a muritard ( xd ) do not speak aboit politics and do not call fyrom macedonia.search for the name dispute in google!if you can avoid these two things you will be gucci ... 
  yeah ... i am familiar.its a very good college and i have friends that went at high school there and now they are studying at some of the top universities of the world with scholarships.you may here someone say that the college is only for `` rich guys '' but that should n't worry you as an american . 
  i never understood why americans keep saying this `` europoors '' . many european countries have way better living standards than us.you can say that for eastern europe but definitely not for the northern countries . 
  obviously you dont know what living standard is.no offense ... just saying . 
  thats what un says and noone takes their stats seriously . 
  living standard is defined by education quality , cost of living/salary , safety , atmosphere etc.you are obviously searched for un 's definition which is completely wrong and every decent economist/sociologist in the world doesnt take it seriously because its a joke . 
  in countries like denmark , norway and sweden its impossible to be homeless ( expect if you are a drug addict or you actually want to be ) and you dont spend the rest of your life paying debt if you get sick because health is free.crime rates are way lower and unemployed people take massive help compared to us etc. . . 
  moreover , population doesnt matter because we are talking about percentages . 
   a season system which will refresh annually and those who want to push boundaries of mmr can play non-season ranked . 
  no thx ... ranking system is fine.moreover , imagine if you have to play with 8k players at the beginning of every season.the huge majority of people are where they deserve to be . 
  moreover , people will create smurfs and sell them if this happens because in order for the system to work valve should reduce the number of games needed to play rank .150 games are way too much and not everyone can reach that number quickly.if someone plays 150 games/6 months he will be pissed with the system . 
   listen here useless scums after wow 's 2nd expansion they introduced dungeon finder system that allows you to select role before you queue . 
  agreed ... but then get ready to cry for the queue time . 
  3 ) agreed . 
   doens ' t judge people for what they choose to spend their money on . 
  what?when did i judge someone for what they choose to spend their money on?plz read what i wrote . 
  dude ... plz stop with this nonsense.gdp per capita has nothing to do with living standards.you just overturned yourself ... look what you said above about qatar . 
   standard of living refers to the level of wealth , comfort , material goods and necessities available to a certain socioeconomic class in a certain geographic area . 
  the standard of living includes factors such as income , quality and availability of employment , class disparity , poverty rate , quality and affordability of housing , hours of work required to purchase necessities , gross domestic product , inflation rate , number of holiday days per year , affordable ( or free ) access to quality healthcare , quality and availability of education , life expectancy , incidence of disease , cost of goods and services , infrastructure , national economic growth , economic and political stability , political and religious freedom , environmental quality , climate and safety . 
  the standard of living is closely related to quality of life . 
  thats the definition ... the worldwide definition , the definition that is in my uni 's books and everywhere in the world . 
  un 's method of counting the standard of living is a joke and completely incomplete.thats what i was saying ... but the definition is standard . 
  actually , i am not even sure what you mean with this, 
   standard of living has nothing to do with health insurance or drug addiction or home size . 
  noone said that.i was just saying that only homeless drug addicts can not have a home in countries like sweden not because they chose to do it but because the country doesnt give them . 
  are you 10 ? 
  no comment ... 
  thats definitely me when i am driving . 
  pay denbts lazy corrupted mothafackas !!, 
  i guess living in europe let you know both worlds ( nba and euroleague ) . you would be surprised if you knew how many nba players come here and cant make a shoot and vice versa.euroleague and nba are different worlds . 
   wish he kept playing for the national team longer, 
  true that ... but i dont know if he could make it at 2012 when he was playing 35/40 min.it was a sacrifice ... a tough one i guess . 
  well . . i was hoping that someone could remember his name from this [ game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d1wjzv50lo ) . we had a good generation back then ... now we count on greek freak :d, 
  hmmm , he had a significant injury and did a surgery in the abdomen and thats why he retired from the national team quite early ( which is an important thing here because there are not contract terms from clubs about national teams ) . this happened in 2010 and other than that he has some injuries now and then but after 1-1 ,5 month he is back like he never left . 
  hahahahahahaha ... true that.jokes aside panathinaikos and olympiakos have really rich owners at basketball.before 4-5 years they had 35mil budget each which is pretty huge considering that diamantidis is paid 2,500,000 / year and he is the best pg in europe.panathinaikos could easily be a very decent team in nba with the 2005-2009 rosters . 
  the strange thing with these owners is that they put money without taking anything back.if you win euroleague you will only take 1mil euros ( from the next year the money will be way more tho because fiba threaten euroleague that will make a fiba league in europe ) . the owners of panathinaikos ( it goes from family member to family member ) have put in the team more than 300.000.000 and havent take anything back.money laundry or pure love i guess . 
  pretty sure that every olympiakos fan will tell you that he didnt deserve that money.he took so much money and he just played good only the second season.with that money you could take 2 first class players and take euroleague ( you get my point ... ) . especially the first year was a complete disaster ... 
  well...25-1 in greek league and the participation in the greek cup is not something spectacular because only panathinaikos and olympiakos have money : s . in the first year he was not good at all ... thats the truth.olympiakos could take any player even from panathinaikos with that money.for example he could make the proposal to spanoulis one year earlier and take an athletic center to back up schortianitis.theodosic , papaloukas , milosevic and schortianitis carried the team the whole year . 
  i love discussing this too but imagine partizan and red star belgrade fans , panathinaikos and olympiakos fans and all turkish teams ' fans together.it will be a shitshow . 
  i study in thessaloniki ,, 
  cheap life , crazy nightlife and the universities are 10 mins from the center on foot.as / u/gramdom said stay away from politics until you find good friends that you feel comfortable to talk.i mean this shouldnt be the first matter of discussion you have a with a stranger.other than that people are friendly or they just dont care .

  hmmm ... i was expecting some kind of anger towards us and your government.thx for the response !, 
   being weirded out about paranoid americans afair, 
  i mean ... who could possibly believe that wikileaks could make a deal with bolivia and leak that snowden was on the plane.so smart but i wouldnt believe it either :p, 
  i cant tell if this is sarcasm or not . 
  i am still not sure if you are trolling me . 
  if you are not can you elaborate why this would be a proud moment for any country ? 
  what is weird about this organisation is that the old squad ( ad finem now ) decided to leave on its own.something bad probably happened because usually players dont leave an organisation to form a team without sponsors ( golden boys ) . who knows ... 
  yeah that was i thought !!, 
  ! then i realised that i was wrong.thx , 
  edit : \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5 [ \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+11 ), 
   however , i do n't even have a chance to disagree or discuss with the decision they made but only get an apologize ( i 'm sorry ) from the manager . 
  he didnt agree ... he was forced to agree because he didnt have a choice . 
  you dont understand or you are just a fnatic fangay.we are discussing if the rule `` both players must agree ... etc '' can be implemented in reality because its obvious that net didnt want to be a sub but the team forced him.what he could say?fuck you all of you , i am comming in manilla ? 
  '' . thats what `` i force someone '' means.net got invited in manilla because he was the primary player ... not mushi.the team basically screwed him and he couldnt do anything about it . 
  the conclusion is that teams can screw players even after the roster lock which shouldnt happen . 
  \u03a4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b4\u03c9 http://www.thepressproject.gr/article/94327/o-giorgos-tragkas-sta-panama-papers, 
  yeah i saw your dotabuff ... its obvious that you are not that comfortable yet . 
  * focus on improving your last hitting.you play carry and 23lh/10mins is not that good.generally you need to have 40 + / 10 mins which is decent considering you will have a relatively bad lane due to your bracket . 
  * play different heroes so you can learn all of them.when you join a game its good to know what your enemies can do . 
  * play different roles so you ll know what to expect from your teamm8s and your enemies.a support can be really strong at early game but start to fall at late game for example . 
  * focus on pushing.in your bracket people are wandering without doing anything.push , go roshan and if you are behind just farm.farm everything !!!, 
  * if you truly want to become better just watch some tournament games on youtube or pro players from their perspective.there is the watch tab in game and you can go there to watch a very high skill game to see whats going on . 
  * whats more important tho its to play the game.whatever i said will be useless if you dont want to play.if you play 1 game per 10 days its fine but dont expect to become better.just play for the luls  !!, 
  ! map awareness and general knowledge of the game come with experience . 
  this man knows vodaphone . 
  well , if you want to escape santorini , milos , mykonos , corfu etc and you want something in the mainland i suggest a tour at peloponnese.nauplio is probably the most beautiful city of the mainland.you can rent a car and go to epidauros and why not watch a performance there.you can also go to mykines ( actually this is a must !, 
  ) . finally make a daily trip from nauplio to sparta to see mistras or go to athens  . 
  peloponnese has so many places to go ... 
   the survey also showed that the proportion of 12 to 17 year olds who smoke daily has increased from 2.5 % in 2010 to 3.4 % in 2013 , a huge rise of 36 % in a population which has itself increased in the same time frame . 
  considering the whole point of plain packaging is supposedly to stop children taking up tobacco , that should have been the real story here . 
  the standard of journalism seen today on this issue is pretty dire .
