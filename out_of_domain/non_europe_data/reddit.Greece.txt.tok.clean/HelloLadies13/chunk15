   he is awful at balancing . 
  who is better ? 
  name one . 
   due to decreased crowds . 
  not ... lefkada is a really popular destination.if you reallyyyy want to relax i suggest ithaca from ionion but there is a lack of nightlife . 
  i am not from athens so i cant tell about what to do but you have to visit acropolis and the acropolis museum.its a wonderful experience.for bars etc. . . tripadvisor will do the job . 
   a purely voluntary organization which ** we are free to leave ** whenever we want, 
  / u/santorinichef is your only hope . 
   attention-whoring, 
  elaborate plz : s, 
  [ here ] ( http://prntscr.com/bb3td4 ) is mine ... i think i overestimate navi but anyway . 
  greek is a difficult language to learn ... it will be hard ... !!, 
  h \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf [ \u03b5\u03b4\u03c9 ] ( http://www.hunters.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/edessa.jpg ), 
  modern movies : [ little england ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3253650/ ) is quite good.i like [ xenia ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3186946/ ) too . 
  [ dogtooth ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379182/ ) if you like a bit shocking movies and you should watch the new film of that director called `` the lobster '' ( only the director and 1-2 actors are greeks tho ) . 
  modern series : the best modern work of greek tv is without doubt [ the island ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1708523/ ) . other than that , [ sto para pente ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491739/ ) is a really good comedy too . 
  i study in thessaloniki.the area you want to be is [ this ] ( http://prntscr.com/bg6fk3 ) one.other than that , you must visit the [ `` kastra '' ( castles ) ] ( http://www.kanokratisi.com/files/kastra-thessaloniki.jpg ) drink a coffee there and enjoy the view.you must also visit the [ `` agios dimitrios '' ( saint dimitrios ) ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctpxqxlcjgxiyqitj-ma1k8wl1edrm4bgatdvowvymhqdnhhj7c ) church and pray that the catacombs are open.for shopping `` tsimiski '' street is the place to go.after that walk at `` agia sofia '' and `` aristotelous '' square and also at the port.i wont tell you where to eat or drink because i am student and i usually prefer cheap places.you can always use tripadvisor to search for other places to visit like `` rotonta '' etc. . .

  i agree with that ... but fortunately or unfortunately now you are in . 
  from now on , do you believe that the damage will be that big that exiting is n't worthy ? 
  you will always depend on eu at many things . 
  i think we all agree on that . 
   i do n't think it will have that big of an impact for the world, 
  i hope you are right but i do n't agree with this statement . 
  i believe that a brexit will disintegrate eu , the biggest economy of the world . 
  then again , of course no one knows what will happen . 
  do you believe that even from your perspective , as pro-exit , that there is a possibility things to get much worse ? 
  yes , but switzerland did n't join eu from the first place . 
  that 's a big difference . 
  you did n't get my point . 
  if economics were not bonded with politics then you ` ld be right . 
  we are living in a world that one article of `` the economist '' or a simple word from a politician can charge or grant millions or billions of pounds at one country . 
  mario draghi literally save the euro back in 2008 by saying `` i 'll do whatever it takes to save it '' . 
  unfortunately or fortunately politics matter . 
  if britain leaves , eu investors will disappear and the stock market will fall . 
  why ? 
  because it 's the first time someone left the eu and that creates a lack of stability . 
  euro will have problems too and that might creates problems everywhere . 
  obviously , maybe i am overreacting but leaving from eu is not the same as if you had never join . 
  / u/gorat , / u/merhandus , / u/stamts - you are officially mods of / r/nerdnation, 
   no im verry unhappy with eu . 
  pretty much most people but that does n't mean that `` brexit '' is good . 
  they shot themselves on the foot actually . 
  the worst part is that they left for the wrong reasons . 
  the campaign of brexit focused on :, 
  a ) immigration, 
  b ) national sovereignty, 
  which is all misleading . 
  britain is n't part of the schengen and moreover , the immigrants that they receive are mostly educated youngmen-women from greece , romania etc that have a positive impact on the economy . 
  as for national sovereignty , brexit voters will be disappointed when they see that if they really want to be part of the single market ( if they dont , it will be an economical suicide ) they have to obey at european regulations and laws anyway . 
  eu sucks , but brexit only make things worse . 
  instead of trying to change the economical and political policies they ran away . 
  the impact will be huge , not only for them but for everyone . 
   she said that in greece , most people do n't consider it to be cheating if the guy in a relationship just has sex with someone else . 
  no , she is lying . 
  there are people all over the world that have this kind of `` open relationships '' but its definitely not a greek thing . 
  the outstanding majority does n't like this behavior . 
  if you are not ok with this you should leave her . 
  lol ... 
  actually , noone listened . 
  its a proposal . 
  moreover , the stadiums already exist from 2004 . 
  they just need a small renovation and with the right planning the idea will have positive economical impact because you do n't have to spend billions on new stadiums etc. 
  most have been maintained . 
  faliro , elliniko ( basketball field ) , oaka , batmiton stadium will be a theater for 8 more years , taekwondo is still in use , the olympic village accommodates 2500 families etc. 
  [ what do you want baby ? 
  greece is as safe as any other european country . 
  there are dangers of course but it 's probably way safer than india . 
  what you have to do is to be certain that the job and the company/hotel or whatever you applied , exist . 
  check websites etc and you will be absolutely fine . 
  you will have fun here and it will be a wonderful experience . 
  for starters : erotiko - mitsias , mitropanos - se anazitw sti saloniki , xilouris - itane mia fora, 
  athenians are dumb as fuck ... thats why / s, 
  rethymno and chania are the cities you want to be . 
  other than that elafonisi is one of the most beautiful beaches ( and has bitches ) in greece . 
  heraklion is ugly and you should n't visit it except if you want to see the archeological museum . 
  the palace of knosos is a must too !!!, 
  do n't forget to go at sfakia to try sfakianopita when you visit the south part of the island . 
  agios nikolaos and spinaloga are really popular destinations too but they are too far from you . 
  get ready to eat and drink well !!, 
  i switched 1 month ago after 4 years of 1pack/day . 
  i have n't smoke a single cig since i put my aio in my mouth . 
  the trick is to find a flavor you like more than cigs . 
  the first week i vaped the relax flavor from eliquid france ( tabaco base , coffee , biscuit and vanilla ) and i continued with similar flavors the next weeks . 
  i ve already dropped at 3mg and i really feel proud of myself . 
  before i started vaping i thought that i ld never be able to quit cigs or lower my nicotine . 
  put an `` un '' before reddit on the url so its `` unreddit '' . 
  i m not sure if you can see shadowbanned or only deleted comments tho . 
  i didnt see the `` not '' . 
  sorry gia ta greeklish alla den exw ellinika auti ti stigmi :, 
  hello guys !, 
  is the hate between ** people ** from israel and palestine real or medias are magnifying the reality ? 
  1 ) it sucks , 25 % + unemployment , cuts in pensions/salaries every few months , private sector is getting fucked with new taxes over and over again , 500.000 greeks have left the country since 2009 ( 1/20 of the population ) and the debt is unsustainable ( which means that without a debt relief/restructure we will default ) . 
  2 ) this one . 
  we call ti `` horiatiki '' ( \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 ), 
  3 ) corrupt , self-serving,
