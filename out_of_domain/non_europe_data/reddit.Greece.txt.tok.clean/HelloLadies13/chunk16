  4 ) athens is really ugly . 
  you should go there only for a few days to see the monuments . 
  spend the rest of your vacations in some islands . 
  * they hate palestinians , they like greek music and they sing loudly at concerts . 
  * eh ... i dont really know . 
  i think as a nation with really strict policies and society . 
  * dont really know . 
  there is a very small minority that believes that the `` jews are to blame for everything the world is facing '' . 
  these people usually vote the golden dawn ( facists ) . 
  * they have 7 % -10 % of the votes . 
  most of these i think are due to the bad political and economical situation . 
  i want to believe that a large portion of those voters are just uneducated people and not nazis . 
  * i havent, 
  * greeks love or hate varoufakis . 
  there is no middle-ground . 
  i personally believe that he is an extremely good economist and i agree with most of his views ** but ** a really terrible politician . 
  * yeah greeks are very religious . 
  * they are maintained of course . 
  they bring money to the country ... 
   . . as long as you do n't have a local person to guide you around . 
  true that .

  we learn a lot of ancient history ... mostly greek tho . 
  we dont learn about china etc. . . 
   if greece had control over its currency it would just default and go back to the 1950 's with even less geopolitical power ,,

   educational, 
  i think the biggest problem for many people is not the name but the fact that you name airports under alexander 's name while it 's not possible to have any connection with him due to the fact that your ancestors came in balkans literally 1 thousand years after his death . 
  even if you name the country `` northern macedonia '' which is i think a very good solution for both sides nothing ld be solved . 
  personally , i dont give a shit even if i find it quite scary because it 's a hint of what propaganda can do in any country . 
  i got flashbacks . 
  relax from eliquid france ... yeah ... i know that murica does n't have that juice . 
  you guys are losers xd, 
  so , i am a student and i had a shitty job at a factory this summer . 
  so the night of the turkish coup attempt i was working from 10 pm to 6 am . 
  the coup attempt started at 2 am ( greek time ) . 
  noone had internet expect one guy who was a bit of an idiot . 
  he told us that the attempt was successful and that there was a draft from our military as a response . 
  everybody lost their mind . 
  they thought that we were going to war . 
  some mothers were calling their children crying and stuff like that . 
  there is a greek saint that told the following prophecy : `` when the war will start , turkey capture some islands and at the third day they will retreat . 
  the friend from the north will come ( russia ) and help us , and we will take constantinople back '' . 
  so one idiot reminded this idiotic prophecy to everyone and they started to pray . 
  keep in mind that we were only 10-20 students + 80 uneducated people that have n't left their village for their whole lives . 
  it was depressing ... 
  3 months without cigs ... i feel you bro .

  i hate you . 
  4300 euros a month ? 
  dude ... this salary is insane for greece . 
  you can live quite confortably ( have an apartment in the center , go out 2 times a week ) with 1/4 of it . 
  how much do you pay for your house ? 
  moreover , i know that you are kidding but it is very common for greeks ( or was ... ) to ask a lady to come and clean the house once every two weeks or something . 
  she can cook too if you want . 
  they usually get around 25-30 euros for each visit . 
  #### vape nation,

  we did it ... !, 
  [ you do n't get the memes bro .

  thank you for posting this . 
  i [ wrote this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4d4upv/dimitris_3d_diamantidisa_european_legend/ ) about him a long time ago . 
  the team also made a documentary about him . 
  incredible player and person . 
  in greece there are 200.000 + vapers ... i really doubt that only 18.000 smokers swithed to vaping in uk the last year . 
  by the way , i just received a vape mail from this cheap as fuck juice company . 
  i hope i want die ... 1 pound is too cheap . 
   they just recently cut healthcare services for smokers and those that are morbidly obese , so i can see a lot of professionals switching for job/insurance related issues . 
  they didnt ... that was a proposal which is not even serious . 
  it violates the constitution and probably human rights in every way i can imagine . 
  moreover , in europe healthcare is free , so people pay taxes for it . 
  you ca n't deny healthcare to someone that has paied for it his whole life . 
  they delay surgeries for non-life threatening things . 
  still , they might be able to do this for a bit , but when the case go to the court , they will for sure lose . 
  this is a group of hospitals by the way from what i understand . 
  i was stucked at the news about the proposal . 
  i did n't know they implemented it . 
  rofl ... that 's unfair for the brits . 
  can someone tell me the difference in flavor and vapor between power mode and bypass mode ? 
  is it safe to vape it at a pico + serpent mini setup with a hg2 battery ? 
   eli5 : if race is not a valid concept for categorizing humans , why do we still use for it things like censuses and surveys ? 
   how is it a social construct ? 
  can society brainwash a white guy into turning black ?
