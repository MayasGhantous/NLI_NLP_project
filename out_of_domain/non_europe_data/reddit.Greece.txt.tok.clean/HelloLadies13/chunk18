  that 's not the case for some mods . 
  better charge the pico with your usb and not with a 5 bucks charger . 
  this is the pico 's charger analysis . 
  it is very good and more trustworthy than a 5 buck charger that you do n't know what it is made of and how good it is . 
  not every external charger is good ... there are plenty of shitty ones . 
  i do n't think they should forget dual coils . 
  i bought a serpent mini and after 3-4 days i built a dual coil on a tsunami without even a kit ... i always build with the classic , old , `` stick '' . 
  building is actually pretty easy after the first time . 
  i am talking about velocity decks of course . 
  you will get a couple of hot legs the first two times but after that everything is sweet . 
  yeah ss316l builds at 2,5 m. 
  the tsunami is 0,34 ohm and the serpent 0,54 ohm, 
  hmmm ok ... i thought you get more vapor but less flavor . 
  thanks !, 
  i meant that i use the same wire :d, 
  can confirm !, 
  i was 1 pack/day smoker . 
  i started with 6mg on aio and after 1 month i dropped at 3mg easyyyyy . 
  now if i smoke 6 mg on my tsunami or serpent mini , i will die .

  i will change the glass ... i hope that will fix it . 
  i am not sure if what i feel is a crack . 
  xd anyway ... i changed the glass and i will see what will happen . 
  i am pretty sure i pressured the glass a bit the day i bought it , maybe that 's it . 
  thanks !, 
  damnit man ... i feel you . 
  it does n't leak to me from the airholes tho . 
  it leaked the first time because it was my first build . 
  it is pretty frustrating to feel the juice on the glass tho . 
  it is pretty nice otherwise ... 
  you are actually right about this part . 
  i cleaned up the area and it does n't leek anymore . 
  i am not sure if that was the problem or the glass tho . 
  maybe both xd,

  quote from my book :, 
  you must be fun at parties . 
   but not enough to fill the pockets of every public servant in greece , not enough to satisfy us . 
  they gave loans , not free money . 
  moreover , the money are going back to the their banks , not to our pockets . 
   we have n't been able to steal as much as we want from the europeans instead . 
  how is loaning equal to stealing ? 
  japan and us are biggest thieves according to your idiotic , braindead theory .

  you wo n't find it at restaurants very easily . 
  people springed from there make it at home . 
  it requires a bit of effort and most people do n't know it anyway , so probably that 's why it 's not easy thing to find . 
  you will have more luck finding it at armenian restaurants for example .

  i found it at a greek forum . 
  many people are ordering from there and since it 's a greek brand they ld probably knew if they were fake .

  sorry for my poor english ... i hope you will get my point . 
  ** lets talk a bit about the background of purchage **, 
  every purchage we do its an investment at the game.an investment that most of the time gets devalued immidiately.we buy a treasure chest which involves some bundles and a pretty small chance for something expensive.if we are extremely lucky we can earn profit by earning the expensive thing at the first 12 treasures pretty much.this is why we invest ... we hope that we can earn profit at the marketplace.what if valve could let us earn a profit after some months/years without the fear of money loss for the company ? 
  ** the idea **, 
  lets assume that there is a mechanism that everytime a treasure realises , it secretly decides when this treasure will expire ( from 1 day to 2 years for example ) . noone will know.only valve.after that time there will be an almost stable number of the hats that this particular treasure involved at our inventories.then valve can raise the price of these hats at the market putting a minimum price 10 % -50 % ( the numbers are random ) over the price ** of the treasure ** . the minimum prices will depend on the number of treasures that the players have bought.if the treasures are too many the price will get the minimum xx % boost . 
  * why over the price of the treasure ? 
  well , the point is that the players that bought a treasure can be rewarded in the long run.if you put the minimum price over the price of the bundle in the market-place your investment is still devalued and moreover noone guarantes that in long-terms that the price wouldnt rise . 
  * why there will be an almost stable number of hats ? 
  simply because until the treasure expires many players that owes the bundle will have deleted the game , their account will be lost etc. . . 
  ** lets assume that the first treasures expire and valve put a minimum price that is xx % over the price of the treasure **, 
  probably for the first months the price will be completely stable at the minimum price.this will happen because of the big number of bundles and that the people will be unwilling to buy something that got a boost recently . 
  after some months or probably years the price will take a bigger boost.why is that ? 
  * the bundles will be more rare : everytime a new player joins the game every item becomes more rare unless if you can buy it from the ingame market.the items on the blackmarket are constantly decreasing for the reasons i wrote above .
