  if you add the new players and the bundles that have been lost because players which had the bundle left the game etc ... you understand that the bundles will be more rare after some time . 
  * the new guys wont know about the boost and the old guys will forget.ok , this probably sounds stupid but this is how the market trends are working.go back to 2012 and imagine that someone tells you that the dragonclaw will cost 100 euros.i am no sure that you could believe him.there are many examples and i am sure that you can find your own . 
  ** what can make the bundle stay stable at the minimum price : **, 
  * the beauty of the product.if the product is ungly dont expect it to rise.this is up to developers . 
  * the uniqueness of the product.if the bundle is one more np 's bundle dont expect is to get a boost . 
  ** there will be a consequence for valve and a chance to gain profits **, 
  ** consequence **, 
  * problem on the market : there will be many players that will can gain a small profit which can develop at a big one.this depends on how many bundles the players have and how much their price have been boost.this profit can simply give some free games.nothing that valve can handle and of course this is happening already with every item on the market that gets a boost.so there is no big deal . 
  ** the chance for valve to gain profits which will affect the price to get a boost out of the minimum one **, 
  lets assume that 1 week before the treasure will expire valve using his marketing skills annouces the fact and the idea of the boost.the purchages will take a big boost for these 7 days . 
  the problem is that as much treasures will be gone the xx % boost of the price will get smaller and the time that the bundle will snap out of its ' minimum price gets bigger because of the bigger quantity of product . 
  ** this idea can not work with arcanas and the very rare items of the treasure **, 
  * arcanas : the money loss for valve will be huge, 
  * very rare items : probably the price will devalue . 
  this is the idea ... let me know what you think and if i missed something . 
  hello from greece ,, 
  before 5-6 six years i saw a movie about the berlin wall.if i remember correctly there was a snitch of easter berlin who was teaching how to distract infos.meanwhile , there was something like an `` anti-wall organization '' which was planning something about the drop of the wall . 
  the snitch knew about it but somehow didnt fingered them.so , he went to jail and at the end of the movie one member of the `` organization '' wrote a book that was dedicated to him . 
  well , i tried to remember as much i can : s, 
  soz for my terrible english . 
  just this ... it will be fun :p, 
  we are 3 guys and we are need 2 more.the roles will be decided after some matches.we want to play to some amateurs tournaments and have fun .

  [ link ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/gaming_paradise_2015 ), 
  do you agree with this ?? 
  ? my opinion is that teams that hasnt show anything should not get invited until they show some potential from some qualifiers.i am pretty sure that there are many teams out there that deserve it more ( unless if noone else wanted to go ) .

  hello , the wikipedia of this game is completely garbage ( sorry dear wikipedia ) and i wanted to make some questions . 
  1 ) most of the time when i win one war i got rebellions constantly.whatever i do they dont stop.i increase the stability , change the culture etc but the rebellions wont stop.what should i do ? 
  2 ) i dont understand how the trade works.the only thing i learnt is to sent ships in order to increase my income . 
  3 ) i played a game as aragon and after i conquered navara and lost half of my troops i also lost all my manpower.is this a common thing ? 
  thx, 
  ~ ~ btw what is this paradox you all mention ? ~ ~ holy shit i am so dumb . 
  just wondering if its my mistake because i see complains only for other servers . 
  a little backstory : everyone thought that this is the correct house until the mayor of thessaloniki revealed that it 's not and that he is looking for it.he also said that there are 2-3 houses that can be the real ones but there are not any proofs.there might be a possibility for the house to do not exist today . 
  so after reading all these i was wondering why that place still attracts so many people.any thoughts ? 
  cheers, 
  this post is a career resume of the one and only : ** dimitris diamantidis ** . 
  he announced that 2016 will be his last year as a basketball player and that 's why i decided to do this.he is not michael jordan or magic johnson but he is definitely a legend for the european basketball.sorry for any mistake . 
  [ dimitris diamantidis ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qfsefy3.jpg?1 ) is greek and started to play basketball at the age of fourteen at kastoria . 
  in 1999 he was transferred at iraklis and played there for 5 years.since then he is playing for ** panathinaikos ** . 
  he is 6,5 ft/195lb and mainly plays as pointguard but he also has the ability to play shootingguard and pointforward . 
  the acronym `` 3d '' means `` dimitris diamantidis defense '' . 
  dimitris diamantidis is not an athletic player.in fact he is exactly the opposite.his jump is not that strong and he never dunks.his speed is mediocre and what makes him stand out is his unreal basketball iq , the ability to shoot under pressure and his wingspan.he is a player that can do the best out of every situation and make his team-mates better . 
  #### the master of assists, 
  diamantidis is ** all time 1st assist leader ** at euroleague ( 1146 assists ) and greek basketball league , and well-known for his court vision . 
  he has 4,5 assists at 21:34 min per game at euroleague games . 
  his strengths are the [ alley oop ] ( http://imgur.com/oahloxi ) and the [ no look ] ( http://imgur.com/dthacyz ) pass . 
  fun fact : this talent has made him an expert at boosting the average points and career/wallet of athletic centers ( examples : mike batist , stephan lasme , james gist ) . 
  some more assists : [ ( 1 ) ] ( http://imgur.com/fgpn8l0 ) , [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://imgur.com/se3aliq ) and the [ 1.000 assist milestone short video of euroleague ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqy14fr5nm ), 
  #### 3d ( dimitris diamantidis defense ), 
  there is no doubt that diamantidis is one of the greatest defenders of all time in europe . 
  he has already won the title of ** euroleague best defender ** 6 times ( 05,06,07,08,09,11 ) . he is also the ** all time 1st steal leader ** at euroleague , averaging 1,64 per game and ** 11th at rebounds ** ( 1st between peripheral players ) averaging 4 per game . 
  his long arms and his height makes him capable of pressuring every position in the court . 
  he can block [ centers ] ( http://imgur.com/rm7juyx ) , [ steal the ball in the air ] ( http://imgur.com/8oqjjtr ) ( yeah ... this guy that loses the ball was childress.he obviously came in greece for holidays because he was awful for the 20mil/3years contract he had ) and [ steal + pass ] ( http://imgur.com/fjwys2o ) for the assist with comfort.these abilities make him an ideal defender for pnr or pnp . 
  his defense has won panathinaikos [ championships ] ( http://imgur.com/njmmo3o ) and countless [ euroleague games ] ( http://imgur.com/wkfuvpj ) over the years . 
  #### the clutch shooter/late game monster, 
  if you are a soccer fan , diamantidis is the person that will score at the last second of the game.if you are moba fan , diamantidis is the late game `` carry '' that will bring you the victory.if you are just a basketball fan , diamantidis is the player that you would like to give the last shoot of the game . 
  the temperament of this player along with his sufficient shooting talent make him an unbelievable clutch shooter even if he has only a decent 37,4 % at 3 point shoots in euroleague.the examples are endless : versus france at the semi-final of [ eurobasket 2005 ] ( http://imgur.com/7bespky ) , [ versus barcelona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rugdgm7mge ) , [ versus barcelona again ] ( http://imgur.com/6ifffvo ) , [ versus malaga ] ( http://imgur.com/dmhef8t ) , [ versus sienna ] ( http://imgur.com/oxletkm ) , [ versus barca again and again ] ( http://imgur.com/kuxrsix ) and the list can go on for ever . 
  #fun facts, 
  * the first coach of diamantidis told him that if he is willing to work really-really hard he can be an average player at the greek first or second league . 
  * he always says that he never had a proposal to go to the nba but some of his team-mates have said that he had proposals but he wouldnt go.he answered , `` i know my capabilities and i am not fast enough and i am not that athletic to go to the nba.probably this is the ceiling for me '' . 
  * since he announced his retirement everytime he does a bad play the whole stadium is [ screaming his name . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/jc8jht_usxg?t=4 ), 
  * everytime he must answer a question in english he will start in greek unconsciously . 
  * diamantidis is the victim of the wannabe john cena , [ campazzo ] ( http://imgur.com/1ynr8xh ) . 
  ( ok ... thats not so funny ... or it is a bit ), 
  * diamantidis is the favorite player of greek freak ( obviously he might has changed his opinion after 2 years in nba ),
