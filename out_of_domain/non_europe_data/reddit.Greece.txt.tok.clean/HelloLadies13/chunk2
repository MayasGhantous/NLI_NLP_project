  i didnt write it because i supposed it was obvious.i know that the european propaganda is huge and speaks about [ lazy greeks ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) or that we only blame the others but this is not true at all.we give europe the blame that they deserve.they force us to take a huge loan in order to save their banks and the government back then accepted it ( not ... it actually felt and the next one accepted it ) and they promised that we will get out of the crisis within 2 years.it didnt happen.thats why i can blame them.but its not that i dont blame greeks or greeks dont blame them selves ... lol . 
  you speak about collective services and all these stuff when the public sector was reduced by 35 % in 2 years and now we dont have enough doctors , teacherand taxmen ( and you want us to fight curruption ) . 
  do u know that there is not collective bargaining in greece ?? 
  ? do u know that 1 million people have undeclared job ?? 
  ? do u know that my boss has the right to do not pay me ( 1 million people in greece havent been payed for over a year ) . all these is because of the imf and your leader 's decisions.the greek labor market is as disorganized as it can be.the measures that imf took were opposed to the human rights and the greek constitution . 
  dont even bother ... there is no solution or salvation.you can consider us as dead people . 
  in fact we will vote for [ the proposal of the institutions ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=710473 ) but they threat us that we will must leave the euro if we vote no ( this might be a bluff ... i am not sure ) . 
  depends on the enemy team . 
  i go mek , s & y , bkb , skadi , dmg if my team has weak dmg, 
  or euls , blink , bkb for early pickoffs,

  bloomberg ***************, 
  personally i will vote no because we already know that without a debt reconstruction we will have new negotiations soon for a new memorandum.moreover , i dont believe that they will kick ass from ez but even if they do at least i wont be afraid for new austerity measures every 5 months knowing that i will never grow for real . 
  the medias are literally terrorizing people to vote yes.unfortunatelly i believe that the result will be 60-40 for yes ... i hope that i ll be wrong . 
  tomorrow :, 
  oxi ( no ) -  7:30 pm at syntagma square, 
  nai ( yes ) -  7:30 pm at kalimmarmaro, 
  really ?? 
  nationalism ??? lol ... !!!, 
  well ... 4,5 million greeks are already under the limit of poverty.where do u live exactly ?? 
  maybe worse ... 
  * 30 % unemployment, 
  * almost 50 % of the population under or at the limit of poverty, 
  * huge taxes, 
  * 1 million people have 1 undeclared job, 
  * 500.000 ( 1/20 of the population ) havent been payed for over 8 months and still working . 
  thats what 500.000 people did since the begging of the crisis but we are 11.000.000 :p . if we all leave then the country is dead for sure . 
  for example , i am 19 years old.i study economics.when i finish the university i will probably search for work abroad . 
  lord gaben loves us and will save us ^ kappa, 
  lol ... this post is full of bullshits, 
   clown, 
  was wolfgang a clown when the imf 's report came out and his bullshits that the greek debt is sustainable demolished ? 
  ? i clearly remember him at january to say that the greek debt is sustainable while varoufakis was screaming that it 's not . 
  varoufakis is maybe a shitty politican and diplomat but you cant deny that he is a brilliant economist.the problem is that greece these years need only deplomats.varoufakis should be a minister when he could act alone without the imf-europe above his head . 
  imf was wrong from 2012 when they wanted 0 % growth and we had -3,7 % growth.from that time everyone knew that we are going to need a new bailout.europe promised one debt relief back then but as the time was passing they were taking back their words . 
  its not a secret that every economist knew it.did you hear what nsa said about angela and how she knew about the situation since 2012 ??? 
  moreover your link is not reliable ... its an opinion blog.i cant find you 300 that say the opposite, 
  as for varoufakis you can see his work.unless if you do n't believe krugman but the chairman.i am pretty sure you just never read anything about him . 
  shame on you that you do n't come to greece.we are waiting for you.we are ready to spend our ~ ~ precious ~ ~ non existing money for a ticket . 
  dota fans that are waiting at the atm, 
  with precious i mean rare :'(, 
  spend 1 today to go at elafonisos . . it 's an incredible beach.dont stop at heraklion ... it is really ugly.go at rethumno for a coffee , at chania for a fish and then at elafonissos . 
  schedule for 1 day . 
  not same here , windows 10 preview, 
  eh ... you actually delete everything.if i remember correctly there is a folder with your old files but you ca n't open the programs etc. . . 
  just to mention that i ve got the preview the last 3 months ... w8 for the official release in a few days.maybe you will be able to keep your files . 
  well ... thats true . 
  noone goes to ladadika anymore ... valaoritou is the new trend . 
  if you like mountains and nature go to [ edessa ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?q=edessa&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoamovchmih4udhsx-xgivqluuch2kdam5&amp;dpr=1 ), 
  its 1,5 hour with the bus from thessaloniki . 
  you ve got a nice fetish ^ kappa, 
  show some love to the underdogs . 
  mvp vs cdec grand final . 
  hello ,, 
  1 ) if you are from europe you should better play at west server and put the language on english.you are new and when you will start playing ranked games you will see that it becomes better . 
  moreover ,50 + minutes games are a usual `` phenomenon '' . to make things better play on west server and use your mic to communicate and lead your team to teamfights.otherwise it is obvious that it will take a lot of time until the game ends . 
  3 . depends ... some times 10 secs and sometimes 5 mins . 
   yes pubs are often about 50 minutes because people ca n't finish because they 're horrible at all brackets . 
  or because the game is awesome and everyteam is equal ... but usually because they are horrible :p, 
  yeah !!, 
  ! thats it !!, 
  ! thx you very much.well ... i am not sure if i am asking a lot but i cant remember the name of another one . 
  again , before 5-6 years it was another movie again in easter berlin with a woman that lapsed into a comma when he saw her son at a demonstration against the wall.so when he woke up the wall had been demolished but her son was afraid of a new comma so he tried to make everything look like before . 
  yep ... thats it !!!, 
  thx you m8 !!, 
  me too bro ... i just love all the underdogs.i dont cheer for any team ... only under certain circumstances for the least loved ones . 
  time to buy a buga to his wife :p, 
  with underdogs i mean that noone thought that they can win the ti or even better beat secret.by the way , the link shows the popularity not how good a team is right now.for example the only team i support is lc because they are from greece.they are not even in top100 but their rank were 13 in europe and 27 in world according to gosu . 
  who is bandwagoner ... ?? 
  ? i ask seriously ... 
   n0tail made me do it biblethump, 
  on the c9 flair ... 
  when i got lag ... 
   pl has no counter, 
  are u kidding me ?? 
  i am bored to explain how wrong you are . 
  careful ... he may steal your spot . 
  are you 50 ? 
  yeah right ... 
  dont put two empasis on '' \u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 '' . noone use it ... it will be obvious that you used gt even if they know.add '' \u03bc\u03b5 '' also :p, 
  if you want to say `` we want to see you all again '' you must say '' \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 '' . 
  you wrote `` i want to see you all again '' . 
  [ here is the channel you need ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/purgegamers ), 
  well ... the video has many mistakes that i didnt have the time to fix.anyway ... 
  no there is no such thing in dota.the game is completely free . 
  my opinion is that you shouldnt buy the comp ... you can get everything with less money after 1th of september that the items are becoming tradable .

  shit ... i hope they will not kick all greeks and completely change their roster :(, 
  [ sniff :( ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6fcpyad-lk ), 
  i think keyzer or dawn or asuna ( hell ... he changes many names ) is pretty good player too ... 
  which one ? 
  edit : ah ok ... i just noticed the flair :p, 
  captain is spartan ... 
  if i wanted duration on fight i would buy skadi.its fucking decent on gyro . 
  i see that you are from greece ... thats why.we can not make exchanges with companies that dont have account in any greek bank . 
  yeah thats true ... you can have a bigger arena only for the finals.key arena was full only at the final . 
  4-5 for us 2-3 for europe i guess . 
  tell us a story about fear dude if you were close to him ... with which girl did he used to get fucked with and plz tell us that she was fat ... it will be awesome !!,
