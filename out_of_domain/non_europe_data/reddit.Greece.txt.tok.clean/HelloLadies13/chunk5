  i ve got the same feeling for the radiant tier 1 middle tower.i mean we were able to put ta 's ulti on the edge of the highground back to source 1 . now you must put it on the stairs . 
  ps.maybe i dont remember correctly . 
  gyro doesnt need nerf . 
  qop is one of the most balanced heroes in the game.lol ... 
  whatever dude ... thats my opinion.he is getting rekt by most carries in late game.obviously his mid , early is strong but there are so many heroes that kick his ass . 
  wow ... you gave the answer on ur own ... in this meta.overall , gyro , particularly as a hero doesnt need nerf . 
  slark , sven , qop , clinkz , am , lifestealer ( yeah dont complain ... lifestealer vs gyro is good ... overall he sucks ) . . tusk hurts his ass too . 
  in late game even one pl with proper build can kill gyro easy . 
  add lina and bloodcyka and you are ok.every early bkb carrier can kill him ( slark and ls simply ignore the rocket ) or high nuke dmg . 
  no ... you just dont know to play against him . 
  omfg ... i will go buy some right now . 
  yeah its the patch ... he blinked 3 times into 5 enemies with qop without any backup but lets blame the fucking patch . 
  cretans love guns ... hahaha ... dont worry they use them only at weddings and funerals tho.moreover , they love their tourists and they dont hurt them.if you see someone with gun dont run away :p, 
  they are famous for their pot too ... , 
  zoniana is not even the most `` hardcore '' cretan place ... mylopotamos is top , 
  [ \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf 2013 ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65958/the-dramatic-reduction-in-the-greek-public-sector-277095-positions-axed-in-three-years ), 
  that means that your opponents won so dont complain.its not the reborn ... 
  what did he say ? 
  lol :p, 
  they are too obsessed with this tiny + io combo ... 
  they won empire ( 2-0 ) and nip ( 2-1 ) so you shouldnt be mad ... they performed better than the other teams.that 's esports ... 
  what is your mmr ? 
  virgin guy ... 
  bkb + shivas before octarine and u win ... 
  no ... are u sure u cant play rank ?? 
  ? i was level 8 in the old client and now with 8 level from the old client +8 level experiance trophy i am able to play ranked.they added a strange system that its not understandable yet . 
  in lane when i go q-e i will add first 1 point in w and i will cast alacrity for harass ... you waste 1 point at w until u take the double forge but i think the difference in cs is huge.what is ur opinion ?? 
   that playing invoker at my first 60 games was a good idea . 
  relevant flair , 
  get ready to spend hundreds just to play all heroes and buy ... runes and something like that to be able to play as everyone else.hahahahhahaha, 
  not even close.the cumbacks in this patch are soooooooo many and its so easy to cumback . 
  thats why its more balanced.because everyplayer can pick an `` op '' hero.in 6.83 if your team had troll and sniper the enemies wanted to surrender.moreover there are many more counterpicks and counteritems than in 6.83 . the 6.83 was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more imbalanced . 
  694mb for these ... ?? 
  ? where is the invoker buff ?? 
  happened before 18 hours ... 
  front page . 
  gyro is debatable ... in late game he pretty much loses but yeah ... probably ... 
  wp too plz :(, 
  he said in twitter that `` techies is not a scripter '', 
  [ 100ms from greece ... ] ( http://prntscr.com/8hvpfv ), 
  what u mean ? 
  yeah ... this happens if you had already some levels in old client ... i dont know the analogy tho.i was 8 level on old client +5 level on trophy and i was able to play ranked.i ve tried this with a new smurf and it doesnt let me play ranked ... i need 50 level the experience trophy . 
  i am confident in my smurf with 80 % winrate and 4,5 kda but i am still in normal skill :( i dont know what to do anymore . 
  bye bye lesh pickers !!, 
  if he nerfs a bit lesh , lina , bounty then you have a new meta ... 
  [ am-i bet you look good on the dancefloor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlrowcskz34 ), 
  i scream at the mic `` ladiesssssssssssssssss '' ... rip teamm8s . 
  pick am and pray that ur team wont feed that much until u are ready to 1v5 . you can split push really easy . 
  do you have the language marked on `` english '' ? it works for me in europe . 
  i was 2k6 mmr and now with my smurf i play on high skill-very high skill bracket . 
  unfortunately the system doesnt follow your improvement and vica versa ,, 
  youtube, 
  i hope you are this jakiro that instead of buying wards/courrier went for agha . 
  it was high-skill but i dont know what mmr ... we already had position 3 wr . 
  i know, 
  dude ... the respawns are killing me more.i just roll cigarettes everytime i die . 
  my boy !!, 
  who told you that i was playing oh high-skill bracket ... ?? 
  ? i had 50 % winrate on 2k mmr . 
  absolutely !!, 
  if you like tanks play bristleback.undying is strong at early game but without farm ( that usually doesnt have ) is easy kill in mid/late game . 
  rip eyes . 
  relevant flair , irrelevant name ^ ^ now, 
  lets flame icefrog !, 
  all players from greece are in `` athens '' chat.when i put my hometown its ok but when i relogin i ve got only the `` athens '' chat again.plz volvo ... 
  i play sf/ta/es / qop mid ... viper and od must be good too.i think tinker must be decent too . 
   creeps arent even worth killing anymore, 
  i died, 
  replay bug probably . 
  ember as in 6.84 :p, 
  yeah ... now you can get killed by your own teamm8s that write `` thx boys '' to your enemies when you survived with 10 % hp and he kills you . 
  rat is an option when you are back or your heroes are mobile.you dont start a game and say `` ok we will rat '' ... ofc you will fight first . 
  my girlfriend says that when we touch our dick in public its weird and disgusting . 
  hahahahahahahaha ... i meant we -  guys . 
  you dont understand it ... you just do it.to `` fix '' the position.every man has done this way more than once in his life . 
  north european sandals confirmed . 
  explain plz !!, 
  can confirm ... it was awkward.i was last hitting with ta and in the same time i was pushing back the courrier . 
  i could control it but someone could control it from the enemy team too . 
  with volkswagen car ??? 
  do u understand english ? 
  i thought that the system understands that i dont deserve to be there ... my kda/lh etc suck ... 
  this bitch is smart and these fucking kids are so damn idiots ^ ^ ^ ^ + virgin, 
  you will find many toxic faggots ... just mute them . 
  sheever doesnt have enough viewers because i guess that she disabled the donate/popup button so kids can not make fun with her tits etc.its not that they dont have experience ... its that they want to have this kind of fun where they can ( internet ) . if they cant ... they dont watch . 
   i can see she 's someone who could do nothing more than part-time jobs and perhaps if i could n't do anything besides serving at a cafe and had a pair of boobs , this could be an option . 
  not smart , just something that came up since streaming has risen up the past 5 years and she hopped on the moneytrain . 
  well , i am greek as she is i can assure you that you cant do anything more than what u said even if you have 35 degrees.unemployment is 60 % for young people ... i wouldnt be surprise if she has 2 degrees and 15 masters.but obviously morality doesnt exist for her .

  too old . 
  1 . agreed, 
  2 . it is called internet, 
  3 . agreed, 
  4 . play meepo , invoker , chen.the difficulty in most dota heroes is the decision making not the gameplay ( example : enigma blackhole , sk 's ulti , dark seer 's ulti etc. . . ), 
  5 ) reborn, 
  6 ) internet, 
  7 ) if u are 2k mmr . 
  rofl . . hots and lol are much easier for example because u literally spam skills ... heroes are pretty similar and extremely connected to their roles.you dont see nothing else ... there is no meta , there is no items that can make the difference.in dota ,1 item can change the whole game.thats why its harder . 
   well ive played hots , csgo , halo , and many other online multiplayer games . 
  go to csgo subreddit ... they are complaining that dota community is less toxic.ofc u will meet idiots ... like you do everywhere in internet.dont fool yourself .
