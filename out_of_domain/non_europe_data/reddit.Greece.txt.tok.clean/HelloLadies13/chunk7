  ? i smoke too and just enjoy it ... in 10 years i will say the opposite but now i am fine with it.it doesnt matter if its 2015 . i mean living in china or eating fry potatoes is harmful too . 
  it is waste of money for my student wallet but ... you dont know how it feels like to wake up and in the morning and smoke a cigarette with your coffee . 
   3rd world kid,

  i will help you by giving you my upvote but you have to promise me that you will upvote my post too when i ll need to go at valve 's office to learn about their virtual economy and wright a report for my uni ^ ^ kappa, 
  the headline was correct.it was not a clickbait.just ppd is an idiot and this attitude `` people should unfollow `` etc is just shitty . 
  how old are u and you havent seen this movie?its classic . 
  classic movies arent necessarily old . 
  i created a smurf to get out of 400 mmr bracket.then i calibrated at 2,5 k and went up at 3k and stayed there.then i created a new smurf and now i am 4k . unfortunately the game doesnt follow your improvement and vice versa . 
  shut up smartass ... 
  this is reddit ^ ^ kappa, 
  goddammit op ... i felt so bad for you and suddenly i am anxious about my girlfriend that we are 2 years together . 
  gosh ... dont even answer to her calls.she doesnt deserve a shit.this situation might saved your heart.imagine if you ended up together ... 
  dont do this to yourself ... 
  it depends on the family but i ~ ~ debt ~ ~ doubt they will have any problem.we are not in 1950 anymore :d, 
  edit : that mistake tho ... 
  rofl dude ... its not a big deal after all.she saw your dick and ... ?? 
   nearly half of my own cousins and relatives have married non-greeks, 
  how dared they ??? 
  [ burn them !!!, 
   while based in reality, 
  is it ?? 
  i hope op 's girl is not ur sister ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ sure ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ kappa, 
  spartan says that you talk like that all the time . 
  didnt get the bounty . 
  i truly believe that the real reason new heroes are not realised is balance.i guess its pretty hard to balance 1 hero among 100 + more . 
  i think there a huge difference between wc3 dota to dota 2 ... 
  why you are the only one that i got [ this ] ( http://prntscr.com/8w1idx ) option ? 
  casters dont need to be 7k ... 
  or because u are a kid ... 
  dont be so sure 6k scrub ... 
  we are reddit . 
  do you have this thing ?? 
  i am sure you can find many live streams ... [ here ] ( http://www.time4tv.com/2011/09/espn_04.php ) is one.it starts in 30 mins i think . 
  5:30 am here ... i am sick and i cant sleep and because i cant sleep i am drinking coffee ... give me vod plz . 
  with vod for gold, 
  dude ... i dont know how u grew up but what u said is a massive bullshit . 
  `` 6 million dollar ice vortex '' compared to `` 6 million dollar echo slum '' . 
  nah ... ppd wasnt even close to the fight ^ ^ kappa, 
  tickets are too expensive . 
  i am writing from my mobile ... what happened in the series ? 
   we really need a season system, 
  some people spent thousands of hours to reach 5k + mmr.they are not gon na like it and for many of them these goals ( 6k-7k-8k ) is the reason they keep playing the game . 
  the inflation is for everyone ... it doesnt matter if we see 20k mmr players.the system will be balanced all the time . 
  it will make things shit ... imagine these 7,5 k players to play with 4,5 k mmr players ( because this is the maximum you can get ) . yeah ... great world for everyone . 
  you dont understand what i am saying ... 
  hahahahahaahahahaha ... ok ... now i understand why u are so obsessed with this recalibration.you obviously dont know how the system works.the hidden mmr ( which is calculated by your normal matches before you reach the level 50 xp trophy or level 13 on source 1 ) plays the crucial part for the calibration.not the 10 games.so you must play 130-150 games for your mmr to be accurate . 
  no its not ... you cant expect millions of players to play 10 games and have an accurate mmr . 
  oh ... you get my point ... thats why recalibration will never work . 
   really it depends on the game . 
  if you can contribute most by staying in a lane and pushing it with forge spirits , sunstriking to assist ganks by all means do it , but you will have much weaker team fights , ganking and counter initiation , far less mobility and lack ghost walk for initiation/escapes . 
  dude ... at 10th level u add a wex and u got the meteor combo ... its not a big deal.moreover qe invoker ftw because ... kunka , sd , invoker , beast master combo . 
  u get a blink or euls and u fix your mobility . 
  riot wasnt so big company.the timing made lol so popular . 
  thx u for this ... i didnt know that.i hear everywhere that riot was a small company without budget that managed to make a game with a huge community.fucking liars . 
  obviously he plays support . 
  ur dotabuff says that you are improving.slowly ... but u are improving.just keep it up.try to watch the map all the time , stack/pull/buy wards as support , stack alone if u play core and try to do not spend ur time walking around without doing anything.the last one is the main problem of players in ur bracket.they just sitting without doing anything.when these moments come and u realize that u are walking 2mins without doing anything important go back to jungle/lane and farm . 
  probably technical ... they fixed them yesterday for 10 mins but they went down again . 
  yes ... he is 7,5k-7 ,7 k the last week but i think that he already plays dota professionally for about 1,5 year so he already has some experience . 
  so true ... i was on very-high skill bracket and i had 70 % winrate and suddenly first calibration game at 3k !!, 
  ! wtf, 
  they threw so many games ... how can u not feel bad?they actually needed 2 games out of 4 to qualify and they managed to throw all of them !, 
  `` ladies and gentlemen , i lost ... we all lost . '', 
   fixed some memory leaks . 
  are u retarded ? 
  my reward for a good day 's work is sex with my gf ... god.some people are just lucky ... 
  i think first it was eul then guinso then guinso + neichus ( assistant ) + icefrog ( assistant ) then guinso left and then it was neichus + icefrog ( icefrog was assistant again ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/icefrog ), 
  eul was before but i dont know if he worked with guinso . 
  ps.the title is wrong then ... icefrog was developing with neichus :p, 
  ~ ~ nop ... neichus replaced guinso ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ well ... the source i put says things a bit different.anyway ... who cares . ~ ~, 
  nop you are right ... 
  i switched from lol to dota 2 years back ... i ve spent 10 dollars ( for the last compendium ) since i ve started dota.fuck riot and his p2w game . 
  i dont like or hate anyone ... i dont even know these guys.they might rape children after games ... how am i suppose to know ? 
  130 games ... like the old client . 
  [ this is better ] ( https://twitter.com/d2cleague/status/659815318924210176 ), 
  yeah ... i am studing in thessaloniki ... you will be ok.i know many students with the same budget as yours.i personally spend 70-100 euro per week but i am wasteful.many times i am bored to cook etc and i take from outside and i am also a smoker . 
  if you have any question send me a message !, 
  us took 250.000 refugees in 2014 and has 320.000.000 population.germany has 80.000.000 population and expecting up to 1,500,000 refugees in 2015 . 
  rekt, 
  actually even if i am not german , germany needs refugees for economical reasons.germany 's population is in rapid decline and thats why u need refugees.but taking so many in 1 year is obviously not efficient because they need time to adjust in the society . 
  i am not german ... my country only pushes refugees to you so maybe you are right :d, 
  it wont happen in 2 years ... it will probably need 1 generation.but obviously they will adjust with the passage of time.it happens all the time to many countries.in greece which has 11.000.000 population we took 500.000 albanians back in 1999 and now their kids know very good greek and go to uni etc and their parents are working too ( or used to ) ... 
  800.000 is an old forecast, 
  what you are going to do ?? 
  ? offer 2k-3k euros more/year or u will force it by banning condoms ?? 
  ? you know that you cant change the decline like this eh ?? 
  germany needs low-skill workers ... moreover there are millions of muslims at every country in the world that are adjusted very well . 
  just wear garters or whatever he likes , become sexy , cook something and then give him his gift.i love dota too but i dont want my girlfriend to give me a `` dotagift '' . 
  if you know he will like it ... then search [ the valve store ] ( http://store.valvesoftware.com/ ), 
  ~ ~ yeah...4-5 months ( depends on the trade period ) . gorgon doesnt know how to count obviously.he seduced me . ~ ~, 
  gorgon knows how to count obviously . 
  / u/ftg _ air seduced me ... 
  edit : if you dont like it i can remove the thread.i just learnt it from you and i thought that it will be right to show the source even if i could just copy the photo .
