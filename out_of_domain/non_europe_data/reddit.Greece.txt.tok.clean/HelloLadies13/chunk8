  well ... life is pretty good especially for a student like me but gosh ... the city is freaking ugly . 
  coming from / r/dota2 but i like to read lol drama because i was playing 2 years ago.if time is that problem why riot do not remove the surrender button?the feeling of a `` cumback '' is incredible.sorry if this is an ignorant question tho ... 
  on the otherhand i can understand why riot does not.in my mind lol is a game that it is adressed to more `` casual '' players than its rival ( s ) that do not want to spend 50 + mins for a game even if it will be incredible.so , even if there are some people that do not like the surrender option noone is sure about the majority and most importantly ... these people that do not like it are used to it.if they implement the change the reactions will come for sure from the `` casuals '' but now noone is reacting so hard . 
  slark has 54 % winrate in comp games.he is pretty decent atm.although he is also pretty situational . 
  he has 60 + matches in comp games this patch ... he is close to veno.i am not saying that he is the strongest hero atm but he is relevant . 
  they obviously realized that it can not be accurate.you can not be 4k sf while you are 2k mmr because the conditions that you play are the conditions of 2k mmr.well ... i didnt explain it very well but u get my point . 
  holy fuck ... tobi 's casting is so hyped !!, 
  nop you cant.the kda , the gpm/xpm on your last 20/30 games are counting in games with players of you correct mmr.so , if you play sf on 3k overall mmr and the system counts that your sf is 4k its not accurate because your stats are on 3k mmr with weaker gameplay conditions . 
  you dont understand ... this `` xx % over of your mmr bracket '' can not be fucking accurate for the reasons i say above.you created your stats from your correct mmr bracket !!, 
  ! if you play with with the `` correct+xx % '' u will feed !!!, 
  now u get it why your theory is wrong ? 
  yes ... get away like that : `` you dont understand '' ... maybe you understood that you are dumb . 
  what i ve noticed about blitz 's casting is his `` must '' words :, 
  `` realized '' and `` recognized '' are always there with this order at two different sentences, 
  and when someone asks him something he always starts with : i mean ... 
  where were you when 200 kids were murdered last year at pakistan and 1.000.000 unarmed people died in irak ??? 
  stop with these wannabe humanitarian actions ... 
  ok ... now i am pursued that we , as west , are not getting humanitarians only when something happens inside our countries . 
  dont fool yourself ... hundreds of people are dying everyday in syria and we dont give a fuck.dozens of people are drowning everyday in aegian and we dont give a fuck . 
  isis is our creation and we have to understand it if we want to fix it.from the very beginning of european colonazations we only give shits to other nations and we take advantage of their resources.we refuse them the right to education and these are the results . 
  the young boy from iraq who saw her unarmed mother to get killed will come to you and fuck you.i dont get why you are surprised.we pay our sins ... unfortunately . 
  well , it was a wrong example i suppose but my point is still relevant . 
  mid viper pickers ... wafewafwaefwafeaw i hate them so much !!, 
  he is a caster you dumb , not an analyst.holy shit ... 
  csgo has only the majors ... thats why . 
  csgo has 1,3 million with china ... because noone plays csgo in china . 
  with 50k-150k prizepools.some top dota teams wouldnt even attend to many of these tournaments . 
  but still less players even tho csgo is a monopoly all over the world expect china and brazil.i dont understand what is your point . 
  noone said that i am defender ... i am just saying facts.how exactly csgo has bigger player base in the west when steam charts ( where chinease players doesnt count ) show that dota is constantly ahead ? 
  where the hell do you find these numbers ? 
  i dont know man sometimes the csgo hardcore defender pisses me off ... 
  its a method to prevent players to grow really fast.if you are 7k5 + you see many of these games because if you lose you take a -45 in your ass and if you win only +5 . with this way you cant grow really fast . 
  call (325)\u00a0658-7750 ... they will help you . 
  hey asshole , i am not the creator of this method.your complaints to valve . 
   first player who has n't got his e-sports million from single tournament victory . 
  read it one more time ... maybe u will get it . 
  where the fuck do they give free condoms ??? 
  i must waste 3 euros/per 2 days for condoms . 
  shit ... now i hate my country even more .

  i thought that she has a cigarette in her nose . 
  i dont ... 
  i been in turkey twice ... they are nice people and even if some people dont want it , there are many things that connects us.of course there are people that hate them tho . 
  if you would like to see more greek series i suggest [ the island ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1708523/ ) . i am pretty sure that there must be english subtitles because the book is popular not only in greece . 
  from movies i suggest [ little england ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3253650/ ), 
  you will find english subtitles for all of these ... 
  no love for windows phone :(, 
  because windows 10 are awesome even on preview.moreover , as someone that used both android and ios for his whole life i can assure you that wp have bigger life expectancy than android . 
  in the end its all about what software the user likes.i was sick of android and bored of ios but for a strange reason i loved wp.i know the store is not that big but i got everything i want right now .

   laxos said the some 400 such desperate cases he found may be `` nominal compared with the thousands of other sex workers operating nationwide , but they never existed as a trend until the financial crisis . '' he said greek women now account for 80 percent of the prostitution trade in greece . 
  dude ... the song that i adore from the latest album is arabella ... the lyrics , the music ... gosh.i can hear it all day and i think that if i ever find a girl with this name i ll fall in love because of the song .

  dude ... go play cod and when you leave your basement you will understand how is the real world . 
  2 ) there is no maximum level in dota ( or wasnt ... now i think there is but it takes years to achieve it ) . ypu can play ranked games after you achieve level 50 exp trophy.so you need around 120-130 games so the system can calculate your mmr . 
  normal bracket :0 k-3 ,3 k mmr ( the huge majority is within this btacket ), 
  high bracket :3,3 -3,7 k mmr, 
  very high skill bracket :3,7 k +, 
  3 ) read [ this ] ( https://www.dotabuff.com/learn/lol ) and then read [ this ] ( https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide/ ) guide carefuly.its the best guide atm.youtube videos to learn about dota [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/purgegamers/featured ), 
  bf is fine ... but dont get mom . 
  if you had levels from the previous client.a new account in reborn needs 50 level trophy,
