  this azubu is killing me . 
  your hero build on wr is wrong.i suggest maelstorm only if you play against phantom lancer.otherwise rush agha , blink , bkb or daedalus ( or mkb if you play against butterfly/pa/void etc ) . practise last hitting and play more heroes.you need to get to a point that you will know what every hero does and how to play against them . 
  for starters play zeus , viper , wraith king , sniper , cm , lich , ogre , phantom assasin and dragon knight.before you choose check a youtube video for the best skill build , item build . 
   ** far ** left, 
  is this a joke ?? 
  varoufakis is closer to center than far-left . actually syriza is not a far-left party ... its a left party.communists are far-left . i know who varoufakis is because i am greek and he was also my teacher for the first semester last year at the university . 
  his ancestors will be ashamed.he should wear a fucking spartan armor ^ ^ kappa, 
  if its me i did a mistake ... my last kda was 4 . fix it :p, 
  people were barely picking huscar last patch vs lesh and storm and now that even after a huge nerf he is been picked slightly more you want more nerf ? 
  if you are interested in the solutions he gives read [ this ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/modest-proposal/ ) . 
  i would appreciate a post like this for diamantidis.he will retire at the end of the season and he is a legend for the european basketball . 
  thx for this great post by the way !!, 
  my opinion is that xcalibur destroys nlg.most of the time he gets raped at mid ( and i am not talking about the times he plays tiny ) . even if he plays qop/ta he losses mid all the time and then he cant come back.i hope the next patch will favor him because the rest of the line-up is pretty good . 
  madara is playing carry all the time for the last 1 year.he only plays qop mid sometimes at his pubs.he will be wasted in mid . 
  i had a nice comeback today at one of my games after losing safelane . 
  thx u. . . i enjoyed both games and i subscribed to your youtube channel . 
  fu = fuck you not friend you by the way :p, 
  now you know greek.we use this word at every sentence . 
  that reminds me my relationship with my ex.i am gon na meet her tonight again . 
  `` it feels that i only go backwards baby ... '', 
  i am surprised noone mentions the battle of constantinople . 
   with giustiniani 's genoese troops retreating into the city and towards the harbor , constantine and his men , now left to their own devices , kept fighting and managed to successfully hold off the janissaries for a while , but eventually they could not stop them from entering the city . 
  the defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in constantine 's section . 
  when turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate , the kerkoporta , which was left open , panic ensued , and the defense collapsed , as janissary soldiers , led by ulubatl\u0131 hasan pressed forward . 
  many greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families , the venetians ran over to their ships , and a few of the genoese got over to galata . 
  the rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered . 
  the greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the ottomans . 
  it is said that constantine , throwing aside his purple regalia , led the final charge against the incoming ottomans , perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers . 
  on the other hand , nicol\u00f2 barbaro , a venetian eyewitness to the siege , wrote in his diary that it was said that constantine hanged himself at the moment when the turks broke in at the san romano gate , although his ultimate fate remains unknown . 
  the legends say that the first turkish flag was remained there by mistake after the death of the turkish soldier that managed to raise her.after that , greek soldiers that saw the flag started to retreat and constantinople fell .
