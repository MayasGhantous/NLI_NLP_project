same to me . 
  game appears to my library but i ca n't purchase it . 
  you can cancel the transaction from the account settings though . 
  the offer ends in 45 min . 
  hope it gets fixed by then . 
  edit : offer ended and now i cant buy it in the previous price . 
  the transaction was automated canceled after the offer ended . 
  in top left menu on steam / view / settings / account / view account details ( top right ) / and then go to store transactions . 
  i try to buy the game from browser but same thing happens . 
  it says it is working and then i get an error, 
  `` your purchase may have been completed , but there was a problem checking on the status of this transaction . 
  please check your account status page or your email for a confirmation receipt . '', 
  still no email . 
  does anyone know how long does it take ? 
  i got booted from game and then couldnt reconnect . 
  i restarted dota and then i went in the game with 6 people afk . 
  game was n't scored . 
  we were winning the teamfights and killed the ancient when reconnected . 
  same happened to me before . 
  one player of our time didnt want to wait and got abandoned . 
  i crashed arround 6-8 times again when finaly managed to join game but was abandoned as i said . 
  it 's just a new feature on reborn . 
  play 2 games simultaneously . 
  your turn other mobas !, 
  i switched from 8.1 to 10 and my laptop is faster and solve a problem with memory leak . 
  one friend that switched from 7 to 10 told me 10 is better . 
  in chrome go to their facebook profile with their account and do right click / inspect element on their picture and change the picture link to a inappropriate picture . 
  change their name too to something funny . 
  this is only visible to you and a simple refresh of the page will get it where it was . 
  there is a same option in firefox i think, 
  random comment passing by, 
  thanks for giveaway op !, 
  anything !, 
  if you send something in sequence of \u03c0 they cant understand that is \u03c0 even if they use decimical system like us . 
  they have to have the same time measurement to calculate that sequence like imagine they have same clocks but one second to them is more than one second to us . 
  there is a computer science student and a football player and neither he has a girlfriend . 
  i can find match now, 
  total war : rome ii, 
  my laptop has intel core i3 @ 2.4 ghz and 4gb ram 1366 * 768 res and i switched from windows 8.1 to 10 . 
  it feels smoother now . 
  you should give it a try . 
  i have n't experienced with windows 7 but a friend of mine that switched to 10 from 7 told be 10 is better . 
  defense of the anci-ents, 
  so close . . 
  i want to gain weight ... not kidding i am very slim . 
  i suggest it if you like puzzle games that require thinking . 
  after finishing the single player and co-op missions download `` portal stories : mel '' from steam with more difficult puzzles and a story . 
  you can play custom maps too from workshop singleplayer or co-op . 
  what is the way to reach that stage then if it is not intetional ? 
  thank you !, 
  game that scared me when i was young : penumbra overture . 
  and game i want : resident evil 6, 
  open cmd and do ping 192.168.1.1 ( or whatever your router 's ip is ) - n 100 ( or something higher to make a lot of pings ) to test if it 's your wifi example : ping 192.168.1.1 - n 100 . 
  check if ping goes high or you have packet loss . 
  i have this problem with my wifi and its about 1 meter near me and i use cable . 
  a lot of routers can ping ips . 
  you can login on your touter to ping an ip like 8.8.8.8 to see if it is your network problem . 
  it maybe your company 's problem or your area problem . 
  well i am going to say pizza . 
  is the username based on geographical location ? 
  maybe it resets after a day 1440 ( 24 * 60 = minutes ) and to anwser the questions you must login with the username that has the anwser to the question . 
  if we find ip 's over the globe they maybe have username with a steady offset so we can awnser the questions fast . 
  edit : the number jumped from 650 to 70 so it doesnt reset to 1440 . 
  questions were locked again, 
  edit 2 : if on question 3 number 96 means possible directions he maybe going to direction 64 which is the stage which equals to an angle of 240 degrees . 
  edit 3 : if my assumption is right and we start a degree like in math he goes south west . 
  there are restaurants called planet . 
  maybe that 's the anwser 4, 
  confirmed, 
  entered !, 
  i found some cheap games in steam that i liked . 
  ** risk of rain ** : a 2d platform game where you control a character shooting things and passing levels by killing monsters and bosses . 
  you can collect money and powerups . 
  you unlock more characters and powerups by playing more . 
  it 's the same conecpt as bindind of isaac . 
  ** reprisal universe ** : a strategy game with pixel graphics where you are the god using powers , transforming the land and guiding your people . 
  i randomly discovered i when i was typing something in chat and pressed enter to send it while my game was ready . 
  if you want to find the top comment change the rule and give the key to the comment with the most comments . 
  people are downvoting the other comments so their 's win but you cant remove comments from other comments . 
  when i play competitive , sometimes in the warmup round i kill my self all the time so i can buy again nades . 
  i take smokes and smoke all the spawn place . 
  i have a key bindind to kill so i can put more smokes . 
  probably because it does n't fit under a shelf with the bigger dimension it has than the other consoles.i agree a companion cube console would be cool to have . 
  `` bind j kill '' in console without '' and just buy smoke , throw , suicide repeat . 
  if someone complains about low fps or something you better stop doing it . 
  warmpu doesnt have impact in the game but beeing a douche in your team before the game starts is bad . 
  i do n't know . 
  i never tried it in the last months . 
  i think when you hit jackpot you take all the money the machine has that are a portion of previous bet . 
  usually jackpot is a lot of money and 80 $ for jackpot for the 100 $ the woman bet are very low . 
  it looks like how one starts levitating and others be like `` i want too '' and start flying and shit and colide with each other . 
  the kamikazi : he has the c4 , goes firsts alone and dies, 
  the exterminator : he is the one that thinks you win the game by killing the enemy team . 
  as ct you have control of the c4 by killing the carrier ( kamikazi ) in b. 
  better go rush those terrorists in a and die . 
  as t you know b site is clear . 
  let 's go to a, 
  thank you !, 
  thanks for giveaway, 
  did n't maintenance used to last more than 10 minutes ?
