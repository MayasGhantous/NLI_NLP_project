  so for total we have 10450 more points for 2016 ti battlepass . 
  but having a quick look on the quests you can see there are more 800 points quests on 2017 than in 2016 . 
  also the 2017 has 43 quests vs 45 on 2016 ( achievement still shows 45 btw ) and in 2017 you can get more points from team waggers . 
  also we need to wait to see what the slark thing is which is every week . 
  i think on average even if you get less points from achievements you can get more points from other ways . 
  so by giving 1 gold to treant trees you can know that you killed a treant tree wtihout having sentry nearby, 
  i think someone said it last year to make an io arcana portal themed with io beeing a companion cube . 
  i have i3 4000 hd and 8gb ram and now i have 60 + fps on immortal gardens on lowest settings and 60 % scale . 
  i didnt immortal gardens since long time ago cause it was unplayable . 
  didnt try playing a game though . 
  only on custom game with 2 bots . 
  csgo had a big update today so i do n't thing they gon na release it the same time with it . 
  maybe they release the campaign next week, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6dd794/spotted_a_matchmaking_abuser_in_my_last_solo/ i spoted one few days ago . 
  we got matched again yesterday and i saw the abuser is on 16 win streak dominating most games which makes me think he is paying for a smurf to boost his acount . 
  if he played that good he wouldnt need a bot to win a game . 
  he is also using the bot to win low priority games . 
  valve could make a system like csgo overwatch where algorithms can detect if a player is feeding on purpose and those matches get watched by overwatched players . 
  if an account is feeding and gets suspected to be a bot then valve can ban that account and maybe reverse the ranked and low priority games . 
  superhot thanks a lot, 
  same, 
  tic, 
  ( code ), 
  toc, 
  we did the same when we took orb from the west . 
  then we went to the north and took the other one . 
  you can open the gate with one orb apparently . 
  yea it can open with one by puting the carier on both places . 
  it is probably a bug . 
  i got my first drop at 17th-18th game and it was the 15 % xp bonus artifact, 
  legion got arcana while neither team sees it for most of the game . 
  they probably determine which players get the relic before they even roll cause it 's more fair to everyone . 
  each week exactly 10 players get a relic . 
  you also need to play 3 games per week to show that you are not inactive so you can guarantee that you are going to play the game and get the relic if you are the winner . 
  i remember last year we could predict the qualifiers winners . 
  not sure about invites, 
  why do banks charge for chargebacks the receiver and not the sender ? 
  is there a logic behind that ? 
  thanks a lot !,

  i lost 26 mmr in a game after disconnecting in picking phase . 
  a player that picked a hero disconnected first . 
  i coudlnt reconnect but my internet was fine . 
  after it connected it imidiately randomed me a hero as last pick and i got an abandon . 
  rip 26 mmr, 
  skywrath ultimate ( mystic flare ) aghs upgrade doesnt double cast any other skill 's besides skywrath 's skills . 
  he won with antimage so statistically in those matches he has 100 % lose rate with support and 98 % or something lose rate with cores so he should be playing core . 
  some people say they got no rares by opening 30 treasures + . 
  if that 25 % chance was same for the levels 10-30 then there is 1 - ( 1-0 .25 ) ^ 20 = 99.68 % chance to get a rare . 
  95.41 % to get a very rare and 49.23 % to get a extremely rare . 
  maybe coordinator had some delays and didnt update the escalating odds on time and people opening a lot of chests in a row opened them with the same chance as having opened 0 . 
  i never got any rare or higher by opening arround 15 t1 12 t2 and 9 t3 in this battle pass . 
  opened treasure achievement wasnt working at start and also coordinator was having problems . 
  maybe there was a delay between servers registering the amount of treasures opened so when opening a new treasure it counts it as has opening none . 
  it was taking 5 minutes to log in to coordinator so i am not surprised if there was delay registering the opened treasure amount to servers, 
  just make the extra treasures tradeables and not the normal ones, 
  just wait till they leave the after game chat then . 
  yea even if your speed is higher than the playback rate sometimes it buffers and stops . 
  with youtube that doesnt happen, 
  triggered, 
  good luck everyone !, 
  55 % upvoted and upvotes are 20k over downvotes . 
  wow, 
  they could give it to top 1 % predictors . 
  it got another update 5 minutes ago . 
  should n't it need some hours to get tested before they make the main update ? 
  how is that only 280 mb ? 
  the other one was a lot bigger . 
  same thing happened . 
  we had a person speedrun the previous map and then he came back to find us . 
  after that we bought a shadow amulet hid the players to the buttons and then activated the level so all buttons got completed at the same time . 
  one of those probably made the door not open . 
  can confirm . 
  we opened it with shadow amulets while standing on it and activating the quest after we stand on it . 
  someone made this a bit later https://imgur.com/a/1gi3d, 
  wasnt ixmike using bots too to get out of lp ? 
  did he got banned too ? 
  i tried playing some custom games like power multiplier x20 or wtf + and i cannnot connect to server that hosts the game . 
  i get these logs .
