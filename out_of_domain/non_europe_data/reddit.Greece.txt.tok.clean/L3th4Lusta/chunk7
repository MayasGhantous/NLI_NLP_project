  the one with the flowers as trees . 
  sold it in market imidiately and bought a csgo key cause i was n't playing a lot of dota back then . 
  i regreted that decision . 
  just noticed the price fell 1.60 $ so it was a good investiment it seems . 
  not for the challenge but looks nice . 
  change the 16 and 8 to 2 ^ n to see something cool .

  i took the battlecup levels and leveled up but if i open the points log it says i am 15 levels bellow . 
  555 borderlands : the pre-sequel, 
  i see a lot of people took this game from the bundle . 
  steam level 21, 
  pokemon go level : 12 ? 
  got 5 ? ewi-lb3 ! b-3n0gx lol wtf didnt expect that . 
  was very lucky, 
  the darkness ii, 
  i thought it was a battlecup thing . 
  wanted to use it on the battlecup but had the same effect . 
  i guess they are ascii code symbols . 
  045 is probably the - so 17 chars with 2 of them ' - ' should be something like xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx, 
  also undying with od that maxes essence works good too . 
  you need some mana items on undying though to get inf mana . 
  [ life is strange soundtrack - to all of you by syd matters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driww4hxv34 ), 
  i like how a lot of them are pictures of similar sounding things like meld = meld . 
  done, 
  i did n't recieve points either . 
  last weeks i got my points after 2 days i think and weird thing is they do n't appear on points log . 
  no treads switch in a lot of blinks or ults 9/10, 
  tell us the format maybe ? 
  i saw a streamer playing tiny . 
  he tossed a player that died mid air and then insta buybacked . 
  he returned to the tiny cause he was still in air when buybacked . 
  they can remove the gold bonus , delay the gold bonus by 5 minutes or make your team vote if they want random in team . 
  a lot of times last player randoms and he gets bad pick . 
  thanks !, 
  when will you chose winner ? 
  the bureau : xcom declassified, 
  it not even showing an update link on update link page . 
  i guess they will add it soon . 
  btw the patch is very big 900mb . 
  does it alsoe have anything else in it ? 
  edit here are the updates from steam dota 2 news . 
  * fixed omnislash jumping to elder titan 's spirit, 
  * fixed guardian greaves not regenerating heroes who are hidden ( i.e. 
  disruption ), 
  * fixed bloodstone suicide not working during ball lightning, 
  * fixed spell effects not working properly when first appearing while cast in fog of war, 
  * the dota 2 window now flashes when you enter the hero picking phase, 
  * added a new option to bring dota 2 to the foreground when the hero picking phase begins, 
  * fixed various recent bugs with cosmetic items, 
  * fixed announcer not working during hero selection, 
  * reworked pudge and lina 's russian voices, 
  * rerecorded several lines for russian voices : shadow fiend , legion commander , default announcer, 
  * added several russian language voices : alchemist , anti-mage , bloodseeker , bristleback & bristleback announcer , crystal maiden announcer , doom , earth spirit , earthshaker , ember spirit , keeper of the light , meepo , nyx assassin , omniknight , phantom lancer , riki , slardar , templar assassin , ursa , witch doctor, 
  could you buy immortal treasures at previous ti 's ? 
  if the only way to obtain treasure is by levels then there will be less rare owners than previous rare so the price will go up . 
  when i first installed from 8 it took more than that to completely install . 
  i think 6-8 hours . 
  dont remember exactly, 
  enter, 
  you can also trade cards but they have no icons or names on them . 
  just random trading i guess ? 
  let 's see current price in market its 0.38 * 0.85 you win from seeling = arround 0.33 * 15 = 4.95 . 
  you can buy 11 levels with that . 
  i guess i made a big mistake by opening all my packs and buying more from market : / . 
  anyone that wants cards ? 
  you can trade them but you cant see what you are trading.they appear as cards without any info of player or tier . 
  no , i only saw the inventory and is bugged . 
  make cards drop in games so the card price drops in market and in game drop makes the game more fair to those with high level accounts . 
  you shouldnt gain the same levels of battle pass by selling your cards as the top winners of cards game . 
  also selling cards make the game unfair . 
  if every player keeped their cards everyone will have 15 good tier cards . 
  if some people sell their cards then those people wont contest to the card playing . 
  the people who bought the packs will have more than 15 good tier cards and will make it easier to the top 10 % . 
  rocket league,
