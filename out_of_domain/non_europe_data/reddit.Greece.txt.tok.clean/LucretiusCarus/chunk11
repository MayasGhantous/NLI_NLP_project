  he 's referring to the feast for the dormition and assumption of the virgin . 
  it 's a big deal in greece and there is a 40 day fast before it . 
  a lot of people just cut meat for the last week or so , and most do n't even bother . 
  not all animal products , not all the time.meat is usually withheld only for the last 2-3 days . 
  fish , honey , is ok . a lot of people will also eat cheese , eggs , butter and honey . 
  most young people do n't bother at all . 
  oh my god !, 
  that 's the true streisand effect !,

  * fly , you fools !, 
  * st. friedrich at the benedictine abbey in melk , austria , is presented in a reclining pose and holds a laurel branch as a sign of victory *,

  damn i am wasting my life !, 
  if i recall correctly , mozart went as far as * lacrimosa * . 
  everything beyond that is sussmayr, 
  we do know that some bronze statues were gilded , and that almost all of them were polished to a high shine , actually resembling the fleshy tones of human skin . 
  they held shields ( now almost completely lost ) with their left hands . 
  you can see a bit of the securing device ( * ochanon * ) midway between elbow and wrist ( or , even better , here http://i.imgur.com/jcd9zwr.jpg ), 
  under * miscellaneous * in * options * you can find an option to synch positions using either google drive or dropbox . 
  have n't tested it yet but it should work . 
  * i regret nothing ... *, 
  in this case though the gold sheet is very thin . 
  there was probably a wooden hilt that 's now dissolved . 
  also , these daggers are considered ceremonial due to the fragile nature and the extravagance of the materials . 
  i bet he 's on tumblr . 
  i can practically see * `` chromekin '' * in his tags . 
  of course it is . 
  along with mayonnaise and pluto ( the planet ) . 
  no worries . 
  there 's an even more impressive hilt from mycene , done with cloissonee technique , that recalls some earlier egyptian artifacts . 
  [ the photo does n't do it justice . 
  the blue and red are much more vivid ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t8cavhh.jpg ), 
  i knew it !, 
  how shitlordian of me . 
  i will unplug my chromecast in shame ... 
  you could have tortured her in so many ways . 
  you could have told her you want to read `` war and peace '' or `` finnegans wake '' or even `` atlas shrugged '' if you were a sadist . 
  a very interesting painting , certainly an exception among greco 's portraits . 
  some scholars attribute it to tintoretto or even anguissola . 
  so , now we see what 's / r/insidejorahshead, 
  wow !, 
  i 'd love to watch oliver , zaltzman and colbert in the same episode . 
  and pedophilia . 
  never underestimated the power of the phallus ... 
  `` what was wenger thinking ( slurp slurp lick ) sending walcott on that early ? '', 
  jesus won first . 
  it started with an interesting premise and ended in a trainwreck . 
  have you tried [ trigger ? 
  ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher ) combined with the lockscreen plugin , it took me just 2 minutes to configure and it works flawlessly . 
  i am still on kit-kat , but i have used it in lollipop on another device . 
  the eyes in these types of statues where made separately and the fixed after the metal casting . 
  usually they had precious or semi-precious stones forming the pupils . 
  in the case of the ( older ) charioteer of delphi the eyes are made of colored glass . 
  that is also true . 
  the white marble ideal is a renaissance invention . 
  in the greek and roman originals the marble was polished and painted in every detail . 
  sometimes traces of colors remain in statues that were buried soon after their creation and in most cases you can see the outlines of the colored areas as they have a different relief or texture ( due to differences in weathering ) . 
  here http://imgur.com/a/izzom are three reconstructions . 
  the funeral stele of aristokles , the head of a warrior from a pediment in aegina and a relief from the alexander sarcophagus . 
  my pleasure . 
  as for the username , it 's my job after all . 
  there is speculation that the portrait represents the cynicaphilosopher bion the borysthenite . 
  but since it 's fragmentary and there are no inscriptions that might always be an enigma . 
  they were . 
  but it was customary for philosophers , thinkers and old men to be depicted as bearded . 
  the clean-shaven style only became popular after alexander the great, 
  these are ceremonial daggers . 
  the four gold disks are the nail heads that connected the blade to the perishable handle ( usually gilt wood or ivory ) . 
  there is no hole for a spear shaft . 
  by this standard i am the most virtuous man in the planet . 
  i just got it .

  got the same email and have the unlocked edition ( xt1053 ),

  are you equating abortion with murder ? 
  i thought that was a myth . 
  i agree , vermeers output is tiny ( less than 40 paintings ) compared to rembrandt .

  any chance of a next installment ? 
  maybe a few years in the future ? 
  it was n't a girl . 
  i would suggest '' \u03c6\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03ac '' [ horrible ] instead of '' \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 '' , but otherwise the translation is spot on .
