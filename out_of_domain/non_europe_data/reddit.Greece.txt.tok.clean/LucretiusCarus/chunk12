  i actually have a nook hd + ( 9 inch screen ) running lollipop 5.1 right now . 
  it 's great , considering it shipped with 4.0 . 
  that 's evolution in action !, 
  though i love the selfie stick the promotion is here https://pages.motorola-mail.com/motorola-promotions/, 
  in regards to the movies , they do n't need the money and they probably saw what happened to the hobbit . 
  but the real work of tolkien continues to emerge thanks to the work of his son . 
  children of hurin is a great book and of course we have christopher to thank for the silmarillion and the history of middle earth . 
  share the [ load . 
  i 've been doing that for the last two years . 
  i am down 25 kilos ( from 105 to 80 , my `` normal '' weight ) and i never went hungry . 
  steak , bacon and eggs almost daily . 
  amazing !, 
  you are correct . 
  there are some stylized nautili amongst the corrals , too . 
  exactly . 
  pottery eggs . 
  they were even called '' \u03c9\u03b1 '' `` eggs '' in ancient greek . 
  if i remember correctly these are exhibited in the kerameikos museum . 
  speed limiths it 's the reason i moved to here maps . 
  i wish !, 
  still waiting for my 2013 soak . 
  got the mail and everything but nothing yet . 
  my favourite is [ a black comedy ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/a-black-comedy ) . 
  `` two years after defeating voldemort , harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather . 
  together , they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery , thievery , and generally antagonizing all their old family , friends , and enemies . '', 
  very well written and laugh out loud funny . 
  also , [ nightmares of futures past ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/harry-potter-and-the-nightmares-of-futures-past ) seems to be back from the dead . 
  not complete but i think it 's worth it . 
  seconded !, 
  even though the color palette is usually muted , the cinematography is amazing . 
  i really love the scenes in hannibal 's office . 
  that would be amazing . 
  both actors aged a bit and they could easily play in the two `` lost '' seasons . 
  to be fair , the lack of google services was only one of the fire phones problems . 
  i think the at&t exclusive and inflated prices contributed more to the lack of sales . 
  these rolls need their own bras . 
  it 's like she 's melting . 
  to be fair , you 'd need to be fairly muscular to handle her mass . 
  i do n't want to imagine the mechanics of sex . 
   `` looks like i 'm safe to eat that ** second ** helping of chips tee hee '', 
  ... so innocent . 
  the same applies for the dodecatheon of ancient greece . 
  and i am sure people still worship isis , ra and the rest . 
  lots of times these types of pointy jars were hung from walls with strings . 
  hey matt , i love the desktop app , but the mobile app does n't see my computer , though chrome ( and the app ) is running . 
  could it be that my pc/server is connected to the router via ethernet ? 
  no adblocks are running , can cast from my desktop ( and use the phone app as a remote ) . 
  will check the router next . 
  i ca n't even hate you for that speed . 
  it 's just pure envy . 
  it was the multicast thing . 
  it was blocked by default , works great now , thanks !, 
  1 ) create a `` tube '' of molten multi-colored glass strips around a metal hollow rod . 
  2 ) twist and blow to create the pattern . 
  that 's an early photo , before it was restored . 
  in the photos below is shown over the golden * larnax * that contained the bones of the deceased . 
  a lot of his interviews for the time he hosted tds were fluffy promotions . 
  he looked a bit uncomfortable in those . 
  in contrast , his work with snowden and the cia guy was excellent . 
  * i believe you *, 
  hannibal . 
  only two seasons so far , but the quality is astounding . 
  rome comes a close second . 
  reminds me a bit of * chuck * ( a guilty pleasure , do n't judge ) . 
  that show had three or four final episodes . 
  yeah , he came in greece for easter . 
  i was looking around for my favorite ginger mop of hair but sadly i did n't run into him . 
  a close up [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/anoafam.jpg ) . 
  as displayed in the `` iasis '' [ exhibition ] ( http://iasis.cycladic.gr/en/ ) of the museum of cycladic art . 
  that type of decoration was applied to the face , not inside the mouth , especially in a place that was not visible . 
  it follows very closely the root and the curves of the teeth to be something purely cosmetic . 
  in the exhibition you can actually see that there are two pieces that are wrapped around four teeth each . 
  it 's not something that 's fallen there by chance . 
  per sidebar submission rules , human remains should be tagged as such . 
  it 's an amazing photo . 
  the dead lay in the light , the living stay the shadow , a ghost figure moves in the background . 
  moony looked a lot like the werewolves in dog soldiers , though they were more hairy . 
  how dare you famptastic vaptomimer ? 
  another photo [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u4dpmoc.jpg ) . 
  the red-figure frieze around the neck of the animal depicts participants in a symposium reclining on couches . 
  i did that to my tablet earlier . 
  it was face down , is not equipped with sensors and the cover was closed . 
  i am not very smart . 
  never let her go . 
  greco adopted the venetians use of color combined with the exaggerated perspective of the cretan school . 
  the result was the most idiosyncratic painter of the spanish renaissance . 
  i always loved his skies and the modeling of the faces and the hands . 
  they were extremely widespread . 
  clay is cheap , the head was easily made in a mold and the limbs were free-formed . 
  they were , essentially , mass produced . 
  same for me . 
  only came up after the latest update ( the one with the totally unusable interface ) . 
  i would love to buy a n1 . 
  are there any news for a release in europe ? 
  why though ? 
  because of the design ? 
  could apple really have a case ? 
  well , given that tablets have reached a high level of maturity , i find it difficult to imagine a different way of designing a slab with only the buttons and the speaker grills as differentiating points . 
  maybe i am just naive though , but the only really `` different '' tablets were the nook table/color/hd series , with the gimmicky corner cutout . 
  also interesting , in the same photo , is the glass case full of iron crosses .
