  any idea where thy come from ? 
  the - ex piece is cropped from a larger painting of gerome . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollice_verso_%28g%c3%a9r%c3%b4me%29 ) are some details, 
  the first one is ugly as hell though . 
  exactly . 
  should be something under `` settings '', 
  i love them . 
  you nailed his style and created credible modern sequels . 
  please show us more . 
  same here . 
  i always think my drawings are incomplete and i probably overdo them . 
  a bit more info [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apollo_sauroctonos ), 
  phonograph is beautiful . 
  i wish play music would get some cues from it . 
  from what i can see it was crafted from a different piece of marble . 
  maybe the original was damaged and it was repaired some time in antiquity . 
  when the statue was reassembled and restored they did n't see fit to equip it with a new penis . 
  it was in the papal collection and , at times , the popes had weird ideas about propriety regarding statues . 
  i do n't own one but i played with a friends . 
  he uses the kindle app and k9 for mail . 
  i google around and found [ this ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2560857 ) list of supported apps on xda, 
  no problem , whatever works for you . 
  i think there are simpler mail clients , you can ask around xda , the community is great there . 
  every account on reddit is a bot except you . 
  burgers grilled !, 
  correct . 
  google holds it locked down . 
  there was a movement towards modesty in art after the counter-reformation of the 16th century . 
  though it was mainly enforced by the addition of marble or metal fig-leafs some popes took a more `` proactive '' stance painting over the nudes in the last judgement and , presumably , castrating statues . 
  i have n't seen that last one from a credible source and a quick google turns up many results , but nothing conclusive . 
  the greeks usually buried their valuables in times of danger or upheaval . 
  sometimes they did not survive to retrieve them . 
  bad for them , good for the archaeologists !, 
  these are staters , weighting ~ 8.5 grams each . 
  they were minted in the reigns of alexander the great and alexander arrhideus , when the purity was very close to 24k . 
  also , these come form the site of the sanctuary of artemis , so they were probably owned by the sanctuary - or a very wealthy individual . 
  amazing finds . 
  thanks for the links . 
  they are about 750 grams of gold with a current value of ~ 25000 euros . 
  but , if you consider their value as antiques , you are looking at ~ 4000-5000 euros per coin . 
  the lot could fetch up to half a million, 
  well , there was a big heist in the corinth museum 25 years ago but the artifacts could not be `` moved '' and we recovered them in miami ( of all places ) . 
  but coins may be easier to move, 
  it 's so well written ( and directed ) that i needed to try osso buco after hannibal cooked that muralists leg . 
  i got lost in the sequels . 
  some were good but the last ones were really contrived, 
  almost touching . 
  reminds me of the passage in dh . 
  harry wakes up at grimmauld and finds ron and hermione sleeping next to each other and their hands are very close . 
  he wonders if they slept while holding hands . 
  there are ways to correct minor damage but michelangelo did n't really bother . 
  he abandoned his * [ risen christ ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cristo_della_minerva ) * in santa maria sopra minerva because of a vein of darker marble and he smashed to pieces one of his last [ pietas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_deposition_\\ ( michelangelo \\ ) ) because of similar difficulties . 
  the fact that his rejected works are considered masterpieces says something about the artist . 
  i dont ' think so . 
  he might have lost a little weight , but nothing shocking . 
  that 's correct . 
  leonardo was genial , always well-dressed and had the manners of an aristocrat . 
  michelangelo preferred dealing with stonemasons and laborers than popes and dignitaries . 
  his clothes and face were usually dirty with dried pigments or stone dust and his appearance was not really indicative of his genius . 
  that said , he was also in the centre of a philosophical cycle in florence , wrote poetry and he could argue theology with papal representatives . 
  \u0392uried with a [ gold mask ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rioxsud.jpg ) over her face , [ gold earrings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fh81igt.jpg ) , a [ headband ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kexjpmd.jpg ) over her hair and a necklace of gold beads . 
  her dress was fastened with silver pins , terminating in gold orbs in the shape of poppy capsules . 
  [ rosettes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hpoyguq.jpg ) and other gold ornaments were sewn on various places of her dress . 
  also [ buried ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g3x0pvn.jpg ) with her were a large number of clay figurines , a silver phiale and bronze vessels . 
  not really sure . 
  given that is an official excavation photo i would guess they removed the arrybalos before they found the burial and replaced it in photoshop for the sake of completeness . 
  archaeology is amazing . 
  not just for these `` flashy '' discoveries but also for the anonymous people that left few traces behind them . 
  i remember holding a neolithic clay figurine once . 
  there , on the surface , you could barely see the faint fingerprint of a human that lived , loved and created art 7.000 years ago . 
  it 's the anciend method of [ granulation ] ( http://www.cycladic.gr/frontoffice/portal.asp?cpage=resource&amp;cresrc=1325&amp;cnode=55&amp;clang=1 ) . 
  it was used extensively in greece since the minoans and gave spectacular ornaments from the classical period up to the byzantine era . 
  not his grandmother ( she died a century before his grandmothers time ) , but possibly a member of the [ family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argead_dynasty ) . we are not sure how was amyntas i related to alexander iii ( the great ) , since there was a large upheaval during the years after the death of archealos i , resulting in 8 kings in six years . 
  amyntas iii was the grandfather of alexander iii and his wife eurydice had a spectaculer [ tomb ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rntqobe.jpg ) in aigai . 
  unfortunately it was looted in antiquity , but her [ throne ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rmxvkwr.jpg ) survived . 
  ( i really hope it 's not too convoluted ), 
  nice suggestion . 
  i will dig some info and post it later . 
  placed against the [ back wall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5fbygnl.jpg ) of her looted tomb it 's one of the few surviving representations of ancient thrones , complete with a [ marble ottoman ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l4cixyu.jpg ) . 
  the marble plaque on the seat is the lid of the urn that rested on it and it 's now overturned just outside the frame . 
  the armrests and back are supported by [ sphinxes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tv6eism.jpg ) and dancing [ female figures ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ulmhxg.jpg ) . 
  on the back there is one of the few surviving classical paintings , depicting [ pluto and persephone ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pay7mwt.jpg ) , the lords of the underworld , on a quadriga . 
  almost every detail of the throne , from the [ floral decorations ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wzmzy4z.jpg ) to the frieze of [ griffins and lions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wahdllx.jpg ) is painted with bright colors and liberally gilded . 
  the [ back wall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mmzwrxe.jpg ) of the tomb , in the form of a facade , gives a very good idea of the original use of color by the ancient greeks . 
  never turning into gaudy , it [ accents ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mmzwrxe.jpg ) specific details , giving a restrained lively rythm . 
  the tomb was looted in antiquity , but the thieves did n't really prosper - for long . 
  two skeletons found inside the tomb are probably the losing side of an argument that broke over the sharing of the loot . 
  [ done ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/artefactporn/comments/34zgpn/the_throne_of_eurydice_alexanders_paternal/ ), 
  my pleasure . 
  it 's a fantastic artifact and a great pity that it 's not exhibited . 
  it 's still inside the tomb , inaccessible to visitors and scholars . 
  it 's certain that it was created specifically for the tomb , that 's why i wrote `` representation '' . 
  usually the furniture - even of the high quality - was made out of wood . 
  disturbingly perfect ? 
  these are indeed the original colors . 
  keep in mind though that the exposure to the elements ( bright sun , rain and snow ) of greece would mute them , as you correctly state , over time . 
  even statues that were buried shortly after their creation ( as the [ acropolis peploforos ] ( http://www.oberlin.edu/images/642/05-3092.jpg ) display these faint colors . 
  well , if you made your furniture out of stone , and sealed your apartment for a few millennia , i bet we would find something interesting . 
  given that we lack knowledge of their clothing , every [ reconstruction ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-saidakytbq0/vhg-3d90d6i/aaaaaaaanv4/t7zwkibl1zu/s1600/amphipolis_01.jpg ) would ultimately be tenuous . 
  there have been some cranial/facial reconstructions though .
