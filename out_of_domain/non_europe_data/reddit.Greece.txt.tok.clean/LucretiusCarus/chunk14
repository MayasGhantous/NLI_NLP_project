  three come to mind . 
  [ philip ii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hlgonp2.jpg ) ( alexander 's father ) , the [ rich athenian lady ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d2p3bbm.jpg ) , and a [ girl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/myrtis ) that died from a plague in athens during the peloponnesian war . 
  it was certainly a source of inspiration , but the copies that survived seem rather bland . 
  the varvakeios athena is the best of them and still lacks the grandeur and mobility that 's associated with pheidias . 
  thanks . 
  i was lucky enough to see it in person and it has indeed the feeling of a holy place . 
  now imagine it illuminated by torchlight , with the glittering shapes of valuable vessels and other artifacts as the descendants leave , sealing the doors behind them . 
  thanks , my pleasure . 
  the copies ( i.e. 
  the [ pergamon athena ] ( http://www.my-favourite-planet.de/images/middle-east/turkey/pergamon/berlin-pergamon-museum_dj-14062009-0283-2b_athena-parthenos.jpg ) , the [ louvre copy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/athena_parthenos_louvre_ma91.jpg ) , and the varvakeios statue ca n't convey the feeling of the original for two reasons : the difference of the material and the difference in scale . 
  the original was polished ivory and gold and 12 meters high . 
  this scaling down presented the copyists with a lot of problems in the detailing of the statues they produced . 
  the amazonomachy depicted on the outside of the shield is often ommited or reduced , the nike statue is almost always missing - or in the case of the varvakeion just a few centimetres high , and the griffins and sphinxes of her helmet are greatly simplified . 
  the small number of copies is also telling . 
  lesser known statues have survived in greater numbers . 
  as for phideias ' style , it 's true that he did n't direct every carving of the parthenon , but even the worst work on the pediments or the frieze ( the metopes are certainly a mixed bag ) surpasses the quality of the best parthenos copy . 
  it 's certain though that there was a central planner for the whole sculptural program . 
  plutarch attributes that role to phidias ( though the word he used , * episkopos * , could be interpreted in a lot of ways ) and there seems to be an underlying theme behind the themes of the frieze , pediments and metopes , even though it was a huge collaborative project . 
  the * mobility * is a mistake of my fat fingers on my tiny phone . 
  should have been * nobility * , as attested by the sources . 
  and it 's really not athens worshiping but just an observation . 
  the copies have the cold quality and ( sometimes poor execution ) of the roman workshops , sometimes simplifying or modifying the original for their own aesthetic ideal . 
  to get back at your original point , the parthenon statue might have been admired but certainly not copied enough , at least in sciulpture ( there are a few magnificent coins and engraved gems ) . 
  from the phedeian works the promachos was a lot more popular - together with the amazon he is attributed to him . 
  discovered in the necropolis of patras , the skull wears a crown formed by bronze wires and painted clay flowers . 
  the dead were usually wore wreaths made from real flowers but there are a few examples of these impressive wreaths . 
  decoration . 
  sometimes these areas were also engraved , or gilded . 
  some helmets had holes or appendages for various attachments ( feathers , ribbons , horsehair crests ) but these were higher , usually on the top . 
  it 's not really about respect , since they had no problems removing and exhibiting artifacts from other nearby tombs . 
  it might have to do with the weight , the size and the state of conservation though , given that the pigments are very fragile and it would require huge effort to move it without damaging - if that 's even possible . 
  the three i mentioned are based on the standard forensic reconstruction methods . 
  but they should be judged in a case by case method . 
  philip 's and lady 's bodies were cremated , so there is a level of uncertainty , as the bones warp under intense heat . 
  the simple burial of the little girl preserved the bones better , so her appearance is more accurate . 
  as for actual depictions , sadly , greeks did n't really develop intividual portraits , either in sculpture or in vase painting . 
  they had `` generic '' types , i.e. 
  [ old man ] ( http://media.lanecc.edu/users/plunkettm/moodle/art-202/images/hellenistic/laocoon.jpg ) , [ general ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/stele_warrior_bm_gr1905.10-23.1.jpg ) , [ heroic dead ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdg53a5r9e1rgfuxjo1_r1_1280.jpg ) , [ poet ] ( http://ancientrome.ru/art/artwork/sculp/figure/anacreon/008.jpg ) , that varied mainly in the slight aging of the head and the attributes of each . 
  as for the portraits of the dead , you may want to look into the fayum panels that were painted during their lifetime and placed over their mummies . 
  these are stunning examples of painting , and give us an idea of thei original appearance . 
  i would read that . 
  you are right , it was the context . 
  included in the burial was a mirror and a jar with cosmetics . 
  i think it 's a combination . 
  the vivid red circles in the centers of some flowers seems to be the standard hellenistic red glaze , while the various colors ( pink , blue and green ) of the petals seem to have been applied after the firing . 
  * any day now *, 
  i think 14-17 but i am not certain . 
  [ the best revenge ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/the-best-revenge ) has snape made aware of harry 's situation with the dursleys . 
  he get 's involved and mentors harry form this point on . 
  complete - and there is a sequel , too . 
  i 'd think that petronius would have used a lot of them in satyricon . 
  the english translation i red a while ago certainly did . 
  are you using the stock software and reader ? 
  where are your books stored ? 
  could it be a microsd failure ? 
  is this behaviour restricted to pdfs only , or you also have problems with epubs ? 
  so , it 's not storage related . 
  are these files dmr 'd in any way ? 
  if your books were bought from a web store they would be encrypted and an update might have broken that . 
  you are using the nook app , correct ? 
  tried going in settings and clearing its cache ? 
  can you use another reader ( ezpdf is a good one ) to see if you can access them that way ? 
  i had it and hated it from the first moment . 
  russian , right ? 
  the greek version of kolyva is made with boiled barley , sugar , baked flour , raisins , sesame , cinnamon and nuts and it 's delicious . 
  oh , well , who needs sleep anyway ? 
  damn !, 
  i always enjoyed hannibal with a nice , juicy steak and feta stuffed mushrooms, 
  that needs just an inspirational soundtrack and a grave voice and it can easily double as an american election speech . 
  tell me about it !, 
  i had to import mine . 
  thankfully it did n't get caught in customs . 
  if i remember correctly they shops in greece asked ~ 350 e for the 16gb model . 
  i got it with 300 for the 32gb and motomaker . 
  i think that might have been on purpose . 
  she was extremely nervous and ready to flee . 
  i did not make the connection , just cringed at the amount of work needed to scrub blood out of hardwood floors . 
  it 's not easy . 
  nothing overly murderous . 
  i am pretty sure she will be fabulous at it . 
  so , just oral ? 
  i 'd read that . 
  that 's just a soak for germany and france . 
  they are going for a full roll out `` soon '', 
  i think it 's a good choice , especially for the prices i see around . 
  the screen is great and the battery life is rather good . 
  it still gets me ~ 5-6 hours after 2 years of constant use . 
  cm12 .1 is fairly good for a tablet of that age ( [ amaces ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/nook-hd/development/unofficial-cm12-1-nook-hd-hd-2015-04-08-t3078260 ) is doing gods work over at xda ) with very few minor bugs . 
  yes , only the hand wave was removed, 
  after he walked out of the house i just stared at the screen . 
  and then the airplane came up and i was floored . 
  where did you get it from ? 
  thanks !, 
  i 've had this in my sights for a while . 
  * bud lime light, 
  * putin, 
  that was exactly my first thought . 
  the series , though cut short , was amazing . 
  any chance of a movie to complete the story ? 
  '' \u039b\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 '' is my first hunch , though [ \u03b6\u03c9\u03ac\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ] ( http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=zwa%2fgria&amp;la=greek ) can be translated in a different way as `` reward for life saved '' .
