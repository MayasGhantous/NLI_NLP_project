  in this case the above phrase could be translated as '' ( the one that is ) redeemed/ransomed out of a life reward '', 
  not sure , my guess would be \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03b2\u03ae = \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c1\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 / \u03b1\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 , depending on what you mean with `` forfeited '' . 
  \u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 [ `` major non-nato ally ( mnna ) '' ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/review/1999/9901-02.htm ) \u03cc , \u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc . 
  is it just me or there is something weird with jesus ' right shoulder ? 
  seems to be very high in relation to the head and the other shoulder . 
  that was my first exposure to post rock music and i am still hooked . 
  east hastings is a masterpiece , ~ ~ when ~ ~ even in its abbreviated form . 
  yes , the band opted out of the ost though they let them use the track . 
  as for gybe , my personal favorites are * f #a #oo * , * slow riot for a new zero canada * , and * lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven * . 
  another great band , a silver mt. 
  zion , has also released amazing albums , although they incorporate haunting vocals . 
  * horses in the sky * and * he has left us alone * are truly great albums in their entirety . 
  the most american of all numbers ... 
  mr nye is in ... 
  this design is amazing . 
  i am still tempted to buy one to use as a second device , even though i do n't really need it . 
  well , tomb i is right next to tomb ii . 
  you have probably seen the reproduction of the fresco with the [ rape of persephone ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hdgmnpxrcbm/ttnurfnmmpi/aaaaaaaafxi/1o1hqplbh7k/s1600/persephone+and+plouton.jpg ) somewhere in the museum . 
  no , from what i can recall , based on the pottery , that burial is 25-30 years earlier . 
  and she had a very interesting life . 
  that 's exactly what john oliver said in the nerdist podcast . 
  he was working at the daily show at the time . 
  it 's not the same !, 
  please , please tell me that the `` 23 % '' is a nod to the increased vat !, 
  edit : a word, 
  indeed `` poly '' : many `` nesia '' : islands, 
  the plot thickens ... 
  and it was glorious . 
  i love this director . 
  value added tax . 
  one of the measures the greek government has to enact in order to get financial help from the e.u. 
  is the implementation of this higher 23 % tax tier for a lot of products and services . 
  well , sala\u00ec , one of leonardo 's assistants , created a nude counterpart , the [ monna vanna ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/monna_vanna.jpg ), 
  yep . 
  arms too short , face too blocky , hideous all around . 
  the name of the rose , by umberto eco and the thought gang by tibor fischer . 
  it 's not just the friezes . 
  the whole arch has been rebuilt and you can see the new members of smooth , unweathered marble . 
  as for the missing parts , they were either carried away by collectors , destroyed or they were not found by the time it was rebuilt . 
  nope , muggleborns are wizards and witches from completely unmagical parents . 
  hermione is one of them . 
  for the kids on the books it does n't matter . 
  the idea that non magical people , muggleborns or halfbloods are inferior is one of voldemorts core ideas . 
  harry crow, 
  it 's sad that this was written, 
  the broken pediments were designed like this , you can deduce it from the presence of decoration on all sides . 
  but part of the fiezes , pillars and columns are modern . 
  the same could be said about wealth or skin color . 
  they are different , not superior . 
  the characters do n't believe they are inherently better than the muggles . 
  only the `` bad guys '' believe in racial/magical/blood superiority . 
  there are three options under settings/mobile networks stream quality . 
  you can choose between lower/normal/high, 
  i usually stop reading . 
  you should n't . 
  despite its flaws it 's well written and the premise is intriguing . 
  i did n't like it , but i get the following . 
  i will bring a bottle of chianti and the fava beans . 
  miss america, 
  prisons, 
  infrastructure, 
  net neutrality, 
  the snowden interview, 
  all fifa related episodes, 
  and the gecko trilogy, 
  ` say something ' was glorious , especially the extended youtube version . 
  the parody of the british pink bus was also amazing . 
  last week tonight had an amazing run so far , hope it will continue strong for many seasons . 
  i think the first image is how pi is represented in scientific journals . 
  i 'd go with this . 
   afaik skysaber is the same person as perfect lionheart, 
  kill it with ( fiend ) fire, 
  i remember rons cheeky question in an astronomy lesson in the gof ;, 
  ` can i have a look at uranus , too , lavender ? ', 
  my niece never had that problem on her moto g2 . 
  she used here maps though . 
  thanks !, 
  i had n't caught that wink . 
  a great tribute . 
  in the greek army conscript lore `` back pains '' were a guaranteed way to skip a few days . 
  a doctor friend told me they are not easy to verify if you play it convincingly enough . 
  i red the books first and i still ca n't really match the descriptions and ages to the characters in the show . 
  stannis and cercei seem closer but arya , ned and baelish are very different in my minds eye . 
  dan has a lot of self deprecating humor though . 
  isaac is just whiny . 
  and as john pointed , that 's the elite 7 % that got selected to this university . 
  the future leaders of the country, 
  yep , i thought there was correlation between abstinence only teaching and increased teen pregnancies and i was sure it would be addressed . 
  so , something like atap ? 
  is she wearing a refugee tent ? 
  it can easily house four . 
  * i do n't believe you *, 
  that one made me laugh out loud . 
  oh , is the jesus ? 
  i thought that finally someone found waldo, 
  it 's worth it to watch the whole thing , but that particular bit is [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/spqxifdylzg?t=381 ), 
  i lost 25 kilos just by counting calories and staying below my set limit . 
  i do n't count or log everything anymore but i have a pretty good idea where my limit is and i am still at my goal weight . 
  that stuff should be taught in schools . 
  very nice , thanks for sharing .
