  if i remember correctly we only have two complete heads from the parhenon pediments , and fragments of two or three more . 
  the rest are forever lost . 
  that 's not * that * difficult . 
  it 's almost impossible to brick it ( believe me , i 've done stupid things to it ) . 
  ask around xda and you 'll manage to fix it . 
  was mirasol ever commercially available ? 
  i remember watching some prototypes but nothing recently . 
  damn , that was great, 
  in that episode ( around the 45.50 mark ) he talked about a complaint he got from the palace , because he set the queens speech to `` i believe i can fly '' in a radio show . 
  does anyone know where that was ? 
  i think it is late classical , early hellenistic , macedonian , but ca n't seem to find it anywhere i looked . 
  its weight is measured at 0.469 g. 
  yes , it is a thunderbolt and possibly the letter a or \u039b . 
  there is a possibility to read the letter \u0399 above the thunderbolt . 
  mantano reader premium . 
  it was great for two years . 
  then they added ads in the paid version , the interface is the same since gingerbread and , since the last update , if i try to change the theme it crashes and wipes my shelves ( not the actual files , just the anotations , highlights , library etc ) . 
  the devs never responded . 
  you do n't need them to come back to life . 
  peter pettigrew , one of the worst characters , was a gryffindor . 
  marietta edgecombe , a ravenclaw , betrayed the d.a to umbridge . 
  partially kissed hero , by perfect lionheart . 
  it 's got every cliche , it 's badly written , there are plot holes that could fit a solar system and the most self-inserted powerful!competent!sexy!master!harry ever . 
  everyone else is oc . 
  and yet , there are 14,901 reviews and 8,098 faves . 
  there is no hope . 
  [ less tabloid , more photos ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/232773/spoydaia-arhaiologika-eyrimata-stin-pylo-vrethike-arhaios-tafos-polemisti-toy-1500-ph#ixzz3phsqzdep ) ( in greek ), 
  that 's a very calm cat . 
  it 's a beautiful word , and now we get to use it in a sentence . 
  the x5 pro looks nice for the price . 
  any chance of the camera being decent ? 
  not bad , as expected from a 5 mp budget phone . 
  bonus points if the rape was committed by a black , trans , fat , lesbian . 
  it seems that it was broken , but most of the pieces remained in situ ( probably on a burial ) , so it was easily reassembled . 
  in the left side you can see an undecorated part that was probably added by the restorers in order to complete the vase . 
  glass conservation is brutal and delicate work . 
  you can easily damage the material and it 's usually very brittle . 
  google art project has mapped the interiors of some large museums . 
  it ca n't be compared with a visit but it 's enough to give a glimpse . 
  a nice example is the [ acropolis museum ] ( https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/asset-viewer/acropolis-museum/iwfupqvij1qdva?projectid=art-project ) in athens . 
  moana manley would be a glorious porn name . 
  `` cultural anthropology on online networking communities '', 
  i 've been there . 
  my 16gb card could only hold 4 . 
  sold by amazon \u00ae . 
  they sent me a new one but i lost a bunch of photos . 
  hope your recovery program works mate . 
  do n't forget the nook color . 
  it originally shipped with 2.3 and the guys over xda are currently working on a marshmallow version . 
  tell her that she is welcome to cancel , without a refund . 
  your amenities were listed and she either did n't pay attention or she wants to scam you . 
  either way , not your problem . 
  in case she leaves a bad review contact airbnb and take actions to have it removed . 
  the modelling of the hands is nothing sort of amazing . 
  wow , the `` greek '' segment is equally funny and infuriating . 
  people need the truth !, 
  it 's a synonym . 
  * \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7 ( psyche ) * would be a more accurate translation , as pneuma translates better as * spirit *, 
  i have the hd + and use it for the same things . 
  the screen is superb and it 's easy to install the latest cyanogen version of lollipop . 
  the dragon also looks good but the resolution is lower and the screen is larger so the displayed books and photos might look better on the hd + . 
  keep in mind the nook does n't have a camera . 
  probably a couple of billions, 
  locked content ? 
  even in the native software you can sideload your movies , books and music . 
  if i remember correctly it comes with play store out of the box . 
  as for the process of installing a new rom everything you need to know is [ here ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2062613 ) but it does require some study . 
  someone who is not expecting sex . 
  that cup is glorious !, 
  i want one !, 
  ( but probably janice went and licked them all ), 
  nice . 
  unfortunately they do n't ship in my country . 
  it 's very good , a lot better than [ mine ] ( https://goo.gl/photos/j8qj3mpdl8uxusvs9 ), 
  thanks . 
  i use a folded a4 page as a kind of ruler . 
  otherwise my lines go all over the place . 
  edit : like [ this ] ( https://goo.gl/photos/tnr4fqtrg6k6tgiea ), 
  play something [ appropriate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq9jbh2lx1i ) for her, 
  `` soon '', 
  also , no cooker hood to absorb the steam/smells . 
  we all do , buddy . 
  i rape myself daily . 
  that 's probably the abbreviation of the city the coin was minted . 
  ah , fatlogic from an equality committee on the aristotle university . 
  so refreshing to see such a contradiction . 
  shhhhh . 
  we do n't speak its name !, 
  exactly , i once made the mistake of accepting an older couple without any reviews ( they begged me for my place as all the hotels were full ) . 
  they were expecting a `` hotel experience '' and even wrote that in their 2 star review . 
  to add insult to injury , they were noisy , dirty and demanding . 
  never again . 
  that 's a red flag on its own . 
  i have refused entry to a guy that used `` a friends '' profile . 
  wow , that 's unbelievable . 
  these people sound horrible, 
  i gave an old lady i had just met my taxi money ( there was a bus strike and ii was broke ) and walked the 7 kilometers back to my place . 
  i am reading all the stories above and i must say , at least you got the money back . 
  people lost pets , houses , cars and xbox 's . 
  only acceptable in iceland or parts of norway .
