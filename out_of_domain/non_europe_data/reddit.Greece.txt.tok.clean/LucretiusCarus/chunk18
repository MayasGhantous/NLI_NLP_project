  i love the fact that they are all vicars . 
  that sly smile ... 
  i have taken paleography in college but the only large words i can make out with certainty are '' \u0391\u03a1\u0395\u03a4 [ \u0397 ] \u03a3 '' in the middle , `` eika\u03a3 \u0395\u0399\u0394\u03a9\u039c\u0395\u039d '' in the line under it and '' \u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a1\u0395\u03a3\u0391\u039d\u03a4\u03a9n '' two lines under that . 
  fragmentary texts are hard . 
  it gets easier with practice . 
  have you checked the [ oxyrinchus project ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qn1mwyv.jpg ) over at [ ancient lives ] ( http://www.ancientlives.org/ ) ? 
  it presents you a fragment of an ancient papyrus and you can help transcribe it with a virtual keyboard . 
  some fragments are tiny , but occasionally you get a large block of text . 
  that 's a very good looking cat . 
  needs more figs , some pearls , that weird black lettuce thing , an artistically draped octopus and a scull . 
  with hannibal you can never be certain . 
  `` hannibal follows several trains of thought at once without distraction from any , and one of the trains is always for his own amusement '', 
  '' \u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc '' is not ancient greek . 
  i think there is a prophet named naum in the bible but the greek word is derived from '' \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 '' . 
  he was amazing there . 
  have n't seen him since , though . 
  yep , awesomebooks spoiled me . 
  i have close to 40-50 books i have yet to read and i still buy more every couple of weeks . 
  my postman was pissed at me for a looong time for all the heavy packets he was forced to carry . 
  i have dialed it down since . 
  `` labda '' is indeed a ball ... in the hungarian language . 
  i am not sure about the distinction between the ancient labda and the modern greek lambda . 
  as far i can tell the only thing that changed is the name of the letter and not its pronunciation . 
  yep , exactly . 
  i thought romney was considered a moderate governor . 
  he was `` forced '' to go far into the right to win the nomination . 
  it 's iconic and otherworldly , i love it . 
  fouquet shows an exceptional talent here , especially on the [ portrait ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/jean_fouquet_006.jpg ) of the donor and his patron saint . 
  from what i understand this way of depicting the virgin was intentional . 
  she is supposed to be above the human condition , a symbol of perfection . 
  the breast should n't be a vision of lust but of motherhood and purity , it 's there just as a token . 
  the artist simply painted the preconceived notions of a perfect beauty ( small waist , small round breasts , high neck and round face ) of his time . 
  btw , lots of artists had limited understanding of the female anatomy . 
  michelangelo 's [ dawn ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zsxdp8.jpg ) in the medici chapel is a nice example . 
  there were some people ( nearly invisible ) in the background , but yeah , it lacked the cathartic feeling of the book . 
  i would love to get '' [ man in a golden helmet ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/mann_mit_dem_goldhelm.jpg ) '' , even if it is not considered rembrandt 's any more . 
  in a word for word translation it reads `` fl ( avios ) eusevios egdikos ( from the ) city ( of ) nakoleon ( as a ) dedication with helena , decorated '' . 
  a less accurate translation is `` flavios eusevios egdikos from the city ( or suburb ? ), 
  of nakoleon and helena decorated ( this floor ) as a dedication '', 
  horrible placing aside , they also misspelled `` elimination '' . 
  total clusterfuck . 
  it 's nice to see that this proud tradition still goes strong, 
  is n't everyone ? 
  praise be !,

  took me a little to find the inscription . 
  but why is there a woman holding a sword higher on the blade ? 
  meanwhile , he is not pretending to be a devout spiritual christian , divorced from the material world . 
  thanks !, 
  i did n't even see the scales or the blindfold at first . 
  i 'd love a link , too , if it 's possible . 
  you can get one of the cheap amazon fire tablets and install cyanogen on it . 
  there is a tutorial [ here ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/orig-development/rom-cm-12-1-2015-11-15-t3249416 ) . 
  from what i see it 's fairly stable . 
  or maybe the deck is in a safe . 
  redditors love their safes . 
  he is a free elf now !, 
   but you , when you pray , go into your inner room , close your door and pray to your father who is in secret , and your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you . 
  it 's not . 
  the guy is a scammer . 
  he just got mad that people finally called him out . 
  he is glorious !, 
  i think the top comment sums it up nicely . 
  the guy promised to deliver an operating system based on android . 
  he got $ 70k in donations in kickstarter . 
  he did n't delivery anything he promised , as he was planning to copy an existing platform that was developed for a time by intel . 
  after that failed , he copied android x86 , another already existing platform , and tried to convince one of the main developers to do all the hard work he could n't deliver . 
  chris price ( u/chrisprice ) is the scammer , the guy behind `` console os '', 
  starship troopers ? 
  teach me your ways , master !, 
  the most metal of them . 
  to be fair , zeus had anal with a lot of goddesses . 
  and this is indeed a nice sketch . 
  i thought there was a distinction between the biological sex and the social gender of a person . 
  the former is the one you are born with/as the latter is the one that 's imposed on you or created by you . 
  am i remembering the whole thing wrong ? 
  why would a ( transwo ) man go all through the pain , the stigma and the difficulties just to invade the female spaces ? 
  are they so delusional ? 
  and maybe in latin ?

  keep in mind that cbp bridge that gray space between post rock and progressive rock .

  the same superstition exists in greece . 
  even my gran remembered that from her youth in the 1920s .

  i love the little handshake at the end , just before the closing of the gates .
