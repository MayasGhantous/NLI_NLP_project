  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/stmtaq6.jpg ) is one of my first `` decent '' attempts . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  i was trying to emulate the style of old etchings where there is always a shade of some kind , even subtle . 
  i 'd love to work on it a bit more but time was running out . 
  that 's the correct way to spell it if he is greek or has greek ancestors . 
  i am guessing he is pronouncing it that way because the `` normal greek '' way to pronounce it is difficult . 
  i think in this instance is justified . 
  the difference is minimal , only affects him in official papers and its done to help other people . 
  it would be more difficult to try and correct everyone that mispronounced his name and in fact would be one of those people the meme seems to target . 
  welcome to the dark side . 
  we have cookies ... 
  and incest , lots of it . 
  the remix ultratablet is a very nice piece of hardware and the reviews look good . 
  there 's also the remix mini , a small android-based computer that needs only a keyboard , mouse and monitor . 
  i 've ordered one just to set it up for document editing and web browsing . 
  i was trying really hard to . 
  thanks . 
  in a roundabout way . 
  price promised to create a platform that would be able to run in already existing intel-based systems . 
  the guys that built remix os tailored it for specific hardware and later ported it to some well known tablets ( the nexus 9/10 ) and some other chinese brands . 
  and that segment was n't even false . 
  oliver showed that there is a wage gap , but its caused by men being in higher positions than women . 
  but people see the title of the segment and bring out the pitchforks . 
  i think it easy when you have a stable base to build your system on , right ? 
  the guys at remix wrote a lot of code to create a stable windowed build . 
  price expected the android ia project to do that for him . 
  when that failed , he turned to android x86 . 
  and the drama begun ... 
  ouch, 
  having 2 perfect x chromosomes is ableist you scum !, 
  you should have at least three minor mutations . 
  samantha bee ? 
  she had some very good segments in the daily show . 
  i hope her new show goes well . 
  cakes , pasta , sugar and other high carb foods are vegeterian . 
  this does n't make them healthier than normal food . 
  yep , i 've reached acceptance . 
  i can finally watch the next season knowing it will spoil the plot . 
  the series is at a point that has caught up or even passed ( in most cases ) the latest book . 
  anything we see in the next two seasons will spoil the storylines of the last two ( ? ), 
  books , even though there are some differences and points of departure . 
  amazing !, 
  and [ tv spoiler ] ( #s `` gendry . 
  he is still out there rowing his ass off '' ), 
  yep , it 's impossible to avoid spoilers , unless you live in a remote cabin without any kind of contact with the outside world . 
   he is still writing, 
  that 's debatable . 
  if he is important to the story he will probably stumble on [ book spoiler ] ( #s `` brienne at the inn in the crossroads or to the brotherhood without banners '' ) . 
  if not , we may not see him again . 
  the show does n't even air on greece and yet everyone has seen it by monday evening at the latest . 
  as long as i do n't have to slog through another feast/food description , that 's ok by me . 
  the timeline of his deadlines is all the evidence i have . 
  earlier this year he thought he could finish be halloween . 
  at halloween he thought he could finish by new years . 
  now he says he has lots more to write and re-write . 
  the deadline now is not even set . 
  it feels like a regression . 
  i think in the books his wife and shireen are at the wall . 
  granted , it 's been a while since i 've read them . 
  great recommendations , thanks !, 
   he 's stubbornly trudging ahead instead of adapting his plan, 
  he is a real life stannis . 
  that 's actually a minor story arc in `` the thought gang '' by tibor fischer . 
  a perpetually procrastinating philosophy professor finds himself chained to a radiator by his editor , in order to write a book that he failed to deliver . 
  i am pretty sure that a lot of casual readers will prefer to wait for the books to be written before committing to read them . 
  i was going to buy the next book immediately , in order to beat the spoilers of the sixth season . 
  now i will enjoy the series and wo n't bother with the books until martin finishes . 
  never let her go . 
  your wife is a treasure . 
  very well done . 
  i love the shadows . 
  google docs is a godsend for documents that are not overly complicated . 
  it 's the three stages of ` mirin, 
  appreciation, 
  admiration, 
  it 's not . 
  the title and the content are clickbaity . 
  ! remindme 6 days remix, 
  statics maybe ? 
  it 's almost the same word in greek ( statike ) . 
  are you george r.r.martin ? 
  because that would explain the delay of * winds of winter * . 
  if i remember correctly it 's a study for the angel on [ the virgin of the rocks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/leonardo_da_vinci_-_virgin_of_the_rocks_%28louvre%29.jpg/1175px-leonardo_da_vinci_-_virgin_of_the_rocks_%28louvre%29.jpg ) in louvre . 
  but ... but ... they were * very * butch !, 
  they were probably dressed in greasy overalls , with lots of glitter and glow in the dark dildos . 
  sounds a lot like \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1 ( moushouna ) . 
  in northern greece it 's used as another word for the face of a person . 
  yes , i am sure . 
  that 's also the way i 've heard it in serres , kozani and florina . 
  exactly . 
  assholes are useful . 
  cruz is useless like nipples on a breastplate . 
  i do n't know how to feel about this . 
   but do n't be shocked if the next moto flagship does n't say `` motorola '' anywhere on it, 
  my 2013 moto x does n't say `` motorola '' anywhere on it either . 
  it only has the logo in the dimple and the start animation . 
  i am just looking forwards to the next models , as long as lenovo keeps the course it started with the 2015 pure . 
  the latest moto x costs $ 400 . 
  the latest iphone starts at $ 749 .
