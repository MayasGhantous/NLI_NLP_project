  ` but i am content . 
  till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria '', 
  as a greek , you have my upvote ... 
  can anyone guess which news channel she was watching ? 
  like bluetooth ... 
  greeks wore beards until the 4th century b.c. . alexander the great was the first major figure not to wear a beard and this set a trend that lasted through the hellenistic period to the roman empire . 
  i always had the same question . 
  in greece the presents are supposed to be brought by saint basil , whose feast day is on january 1st - so it kind of makes sense . 
  i thought it was the same for the rest of the ( christian ) world . 
  i feel you brother . 
  i remember onlyfaintly i was bullied . 
  all the rest are in some deep dark hole . 
  thank you . 
  they are perfect !, 
  fight-fight-fight-fight !, 
  all hail sauron !, 
  if reading is your primary concern , i 'd suggest the hd + . 
  bigger screen - but not cumbersome - and higher pixel density than the hd or the nexus 7 . 
  grilled pork tenderloin filled with cottage cheese and feta , served with grilled vegetables . 
  i ate this treasure at the little restaurant in the museum of byzantine culture of thessaloniki . 
  pure heaven, 
  stories like the above make me think i must be the most boring tennant ever to walk the earth . 
  magnificent !, 
  thank you !, 
  you are a lifesaver !, 
  works fine for me . 
  as a greek , i can confirm that . 
  though the recent austerity measures ripped whole sections of the safety net , i am at least sure that if i get sick or have an accident my insurance will cover it . 
  also , if you have worked for 12 months you can receive unemployment benefits for 6 months and keep you insurance . 
  the benefits are n't much but we manage . 
  that man had it rough, 
  - it 's food !, 
  - with wings !, 
  -- get it !, 
  to be fair to the lunies , they also killed doctors who provided abortion services . 
  i 'm thinking of ordering this [ one ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/b002npc0rg/ ) from amazon . 
  it 's fairly basic but it should suit you fine . 
  thank you for the suggestions . 
  i thought the bigger size could be handy for family gatherings and friends , but maybe you are right . 
  my plan was to coock meals for 2 days and use th leftovers for sandwitches . 
  but , as duncan suggested above , i might go for the smaller size . 
  sadly the amazon.co.uk is a bit light on the programmable slow cookers . 
  i thought that i 'd do exactly what you suggest , but now i 'm thinking of a smaller size . 
  thanks for the input !, 
  i finally went for [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/morphy-richards-accents-48703-searing/dp/b00888x526/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top ) morphy richards model . 
  it 's smaller but adequate to my needs and the aluminium pot seems to negate the need for another pan for browning . 
  thank you all for the advice !, 
  thanks . 
  i 'm really excited . 
  i think my first will be pork shank with beer sauce and mashed potatoes . 
  i do n't think it has to do with time but with the mindset and the method . 
  usually grave-robbers are interested in valuables , archaeologists on information and context . 
  we also tend to be more respectful towards the remains . 
  two months ago ( mid november ) a new dam started filling in northern greece , burying 21 sites , ranging from the early neolithic to the byzantine periods . 
  i worked there for three years and i 'm sure we did n't salvage even 20 % of what could be salvaged with proper funding . 
  it killed me watching the water rise and drown walls , buildings , tombs . 
  [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkqred0t5k4 ) of the early bronze age cemetery of the logas elatis site , filling with water . 
  maybe the unexcavated areas can be recovered , provided they wo n't erode with the periodic rise and fall of the waters . 
  i 'm afraid most excavated areas will be destroyed . 
  in the [ photo ] ( http://imgur.com/svxa1ug ) you can see , submerged just below the surface of the water , part of a megaron-type building . 
  the simple earth and stone walls are not going to last long underwater . 
  they do n't always know the risks of sex . 
  as i understand sex ed in the usa is centered on abstinence , leaving procreation aside . 
  as far as i can see in the usa many ( mainly religious ) people equate abortion and birth control , as if they 're the same thing . 
  is this the case or jon stewart 's been lying to me ? 
  i 'd start with the geometry , shape and material , then move to construction techniques and last i ' d describe the `` content '' the shape of the face , the way the hair is designed , and then move to the specific parts ; forehead , eyes , nose , mouth and cheeks . 
  is there a problem with me that any time i see the word `` frothy '' my mind goes instantly to santorum ? 
  caravaggio 's paintings of the aftermath of the battle are amazing depictions of torture human souls . 
  interesting . 
  i always thought that images of the saints were exclusively place on the walls and that christian floor mosaics were mostly abstract or natural motifs . 
  agree . 
  you do it once , using a proxy and from then on you are free to use it . 
  wrong , you should never say yes , . 
  after the question has been asked , turn and look at her , pause for two seconds and then say `` no '' . 
  just that . 
  at least sixteen . 
  the story of my life ... 
  sargent 's [ painting ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/singer_sargent,_john_-_atlas_and_the_hesperides_-_1925.jpg ) is also a very nice variation of the theme . 
  a matte screen protector might conceal it a bit if it 's not too prominent . 
  `` oh my god , it is full of stars ! '', 
  thanks !, 
  i was thinking of browning it first and broiling it afterwards . 
  i 'll make an experimental batch tomorrow . 
  it seems so in most cases . 
  you can also use a class 10 , provided it 's fast in small-file read/writes . 
  [ here ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2062613 ) is a thread with all the info and files that you need to root your nook hd + . 
  if you 're just interested in running the most apps with the least hassle i 'd suggest in simply rooting it . 
  i rooted mine ( i use it right now with bacon reader ) and with nova launcher i do not miss anything . 
  rooting the hd let 's you install the play store , gmail and other apps that b&n did n't want you to have access to . 
  nova launcher is an alternative home screen that you can use if you do n't like the `` stock '' b&n experience . 
  bacon reader is just an app you can use to browse reddit . 
  i am not sure if you can connect a wiimote to the nook but most bluetooth controllers work fine . 
  from the link it seems that stargate will be initially available for iphone , but i guess there will be an android version sooner or later . 
  in that case , rooting your phone will enable you to install it . 
  as for gta 3 i see that i can purchase it in play store but is $ 6 . 
  i could find it in the usual places but it will take some time . 
  i can tell you though that asphalt 9 and 7 are running great !, 
  other games i enjoy on the hd + : cogs , jelly defence , osmos , temple run , spirits , world of goo , plague , heavy gunner , and many others . 
  but did the balls touch ? 
  kiddin aside , it 's a terrible part of the world .
