  the concept was present in [ ur ] ( http://io9.gizmodo.com/5805358/the-story-behind-the-worlds-oldest-museum-built-by-a-babylonian-princess-2500-years-ago ) by 600 b.c. 
  it would n't surprise me to discover that egyptians had similar institutions . 
  where is that from ? 
  thanks , i think i only saw the first . 
  we need to go deeper ... 
  oh , they did , multiple times . 
  there is even an expression in spanish `` calatrava te la clava '' , translated as `` calatrava drinks your blood '' . 
  \u039d\u03bf , just italian . 
  there was a news report in greece last year about large cost overruns , and delays in many calatrava projects in venice , new york , valencia and athens . 
  the phrase was translated from spanish to greek but i am not sure about the accuracy . 
  nice !, 
  it 's surprisingly good . 
  i got one for my sister . 
  she just wanted to do some basic document editing , youtube , browsing and facebook . 
  a chromecast costs ~ $ 30-35 but has limited ( passive ) use . 
  i have one and i love it . 
  but for $ 30 more you can have a basic functioning android system with all the functionality of the chromecast . 
  the way the song goes it reminds me of the classic '' [ \u0393\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9 \u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9 \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxobd108iry ) '', 
  it translates roughly as ;, 
  everyone goes round and round, 
  manolis stands in the middle, 
  hands and feet are on the line, 
  everyone sits on the ground, 
  and manolis on a stool, 
  do it . 
  go in tvtropes , research and create the most ridiculously cliche story you can . 
  super!dark!harry , magical cores , basilisk wands , unbreakable vows , marriage contracts , ice queen of slytherin , herm ** oi ** ne , weasley bashing , dumbles , gred and forge , friendly goblins , drako in leather pants , orgies ( lots of them ) , harems ( yes , plural ) , sexy!snape , expandable chests , lord hadrian potter-black-peverell and seer!sexy!luna . 
  instant fave . 
  the longest series i 've read is the linkffn ( innocent ) and its sequels . 
  all of them come at ~ 820k words . 
  a great fic . 
  the single longest fic is linkffn ( prince of the dark kingdom ) . 
  amazing characters but the author plateaus a lot . 
  at this point , does it even matter ? 
  just sit back and enjoy the ride . 
  why not go directly to the remix ultratablet ? 
  granted , it 's larger and the build quality might be lacking but it 's a gorgeous tablet , the keyboard is included , and it 's rather cheap - at least compared to the pixel c. 
  `` wrestling '', 
  the statue is hercules and cacus by bandinelli in florence , close to michelangelo 's david . 
  by the way , benvenuto cellini had a really low opinion of this statue and referred to the muscles as resembling `` a sack full of melons . 
  i think he also pointed that if you shaved his hair the scull would be really distorted . 
  can i somehow disable the emojis on swiftkey ? 
  i never use them anyway and they have a tendency to pop up in random times . 
  it does . 
  moon reader 's text-to-speech is amazing . 
  coupled with the british voice in google 's text-to-speech settings it 's almost like hearing an audiobook . 
  well , some guys did that already . 
  it 's '' [ performance art ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/delusionalartists/comments/42zbg5/brazilian_performance_artists_explore_each_others/ ) '' . 
  ** nsfw of course **, 
  came here to say this . 
  fantastic movie . 
  first thing i thought . 
  he will be missed . 
   renting a apartment will cost about 300-400 but if you want one room with a bathroom you can get one at 200-250, 
  depends on the place and the kind of the apartment . 
  my sister owns a 2 bedroom apartment ( built in the '80s ) in kalamaria and the rent is at 250 . 
  prices go higher near the universities and there are a lot of places with high rent prices just because it 's conveniently close to the center . 
  \u03a7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ce \u03b5\u03b4\u03ce \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf [ swiftkey ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&amp;hl=en ) . 
  very interesting . 
  where is it now ? 
  the rugby match , right ? 
  hot lips had some amazing lines there , too . 
  did you miss the carrot ? 
  consider yourself lucky . 
  or just innocent . 
  i 'd eat that . 
  to get your id you will have to wait for the fifth thursday of a random month , got to the middle of nowhere , wait for a couple of hours and give the secret handshake . 
  or , just be wealthy . 
  i had forgotten that scene . 
  not only that , but only some fragments of the hands , shoulders and breast are original . 
  everything else is a reconstruction . 
  museums and archaeological sites are free on the first sunday of each month . 
  food is also very cheap , provided you skirt around the touristic tavernas . 
   a blue doublet slashed with red, 
  basically [ this ] ( http://realmofvenus.renaissanceitaly.net/yourgarb/2009/erika-mark-unknownman.jpg ) but with the red color of the shirt showing under all these slashes . 
  [ mannerism , ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/584/flashcards/7702584/jpg/descent_from_cross-14bc4cd3c1958337bed.jpg ) right ? 
  that looks like vandalism . 
  as far as i know he only signed the pieta . 
  [ gravitysays_i ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy1h6bqtgd4 ) have some great tracks . 
  they are greek and strongly influenced by electronica but they definitely worth a [ listen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxjkn7zqijc ) . 
  do n't forget eco 's work on semiotics and art history . 
  his * interpretation and overinterpretation * is a masterpiece . 
  i am also enjoying his analysis on the commentaries on the revelation of beatus of liebana . 
  for the south is darker and full of terrorists . 
  awww his little tie is draped over the rope !, 
  same here . 
  lost 30 kilos , never felt better , never went hungry . 
  bloodwork is good and i am starting gym this week . 
  thanks !, 
  i wish i knew it was that easy . 
  i lost a decade of my life being fat . 
  i also agree about the gym . 
  you first have to change your diet and the way you eat - and stick to that change . 
  gym can compliment the weight loss but , unless you spend a lot of time in there , it is usually not enough . 
   there should be a movie about the british royal family , and they should cast whoopi goldberg as queen elizabeth , atonio banderas as prince charles , lucy lu as princess diana , and paint their skins white so that they could look caucasian . 
  but that would never happen . 
  i 'd pay good money to see that film . 
  let 's dispell once and for all with the fiction that barack obama does n't know who he is doing , he knows exactly who he is doing, 
  the next best [ thing,
