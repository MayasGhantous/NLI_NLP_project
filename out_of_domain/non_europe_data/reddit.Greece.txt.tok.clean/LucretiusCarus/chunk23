  and they taste amazing . 
  yes , extracting the oil requires a special press . 
  we use a processing facility nearby and they keep some of the oil as payment . 
  roman ? 
  or greek ? 
  i did the same , with three shoots , three months apart . 
  the [ result ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j0qg1jl.jpg ) is not really satisfying . 
  thanks !, 
  correct . 
  you may be able to shorten it a bit more to ' \u03be\u03cd\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf ' , without changing the meaning too much . 
  i am thinking that maybe the spirit of the quote could be given with the standard '' \u03b6\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2 '' . 
  would that be too far ? 
  that seems a solid advice for every site . 
  i am now interested in his answer about the president of [ ubeki-beki-beki-stan-stan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmkvtfeeft0 ) . 
  this is my favourite italian expression . 
  payment for electricity ? 
  that 's absurd . 
  everything is included in the price and you never exchange money directly with the host . 
  these scammers are getting ballsy . 
  send him the link to the [ motorola selfie stick ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rennhojbj-i ) and tell him it 's a package deal, 
  `` terrorists target innocent children '', 
  `` the terrorists were using encrypted iphones '', 
  not yet , they forgot their c4 in the school bus . 
  harry was still a horcrux . 
  even with every other artifact destroyed voldemort would be able to eventually come back . 
  this is what lured me to archaeology . 
  the ability to work and find artifacts that were part of ancient lives is amazing . 
  sometimes it 's the tiny things . 
  just today i noticed a couple of fingerprints in the the glazed surface of a hellenistic vase . 
  that fingerprint lasted for more than 2000 years in a fragment of an everyday object . 
  it 's absurd . 
  i loved that movie as a teen . 
  time to rewatch . 
  it was 2500 years ago . 
  if they still did it , there would be a problem . 
  it 's happening in pakistan and other muslim countries right now . 
  at some point he has to know all this ~ ~ is ~ ~ ` mirin is fake , right ? 
  well , roman men used to do that . 
  women did their business in the privacy of their homes . 
  hewi , lewi , dewi in greece . 
  never thought it would be different in other countries . 
  the fountain . 
  and make essos pay for it ... 
  also very good in * vicious * with jacobi and mckellen, 
  but if someone is standing close enough to ring the bell you will probably get a fish-eye view of a crotch . 
  `` oh , it 's john ... and he is happy to see you '', 
  and they are probably sparkling in the sun , too . 
  all that glitter . 
  dog soldiers . 
  there are some photos of the interior of the shop in a post [ above ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;pb=!1s0x89c25ba87a49448d%3a0x409f85da790a18a8!2m5!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i100!3m1!7e115!4s%2fmaps%2fplace%2fhungry%2bghost%2bcoffee%2bshop%2f%4040.6764748%2c-73.9716371%2c3a%2c75y%2c259.61h%2c90t%2fdata%3d*213m4*211e1*213m2*211sc6jfigzduizbewsk2dnyww*212e0*214m2*213m1*211s0x0%3a0x409f85da790a18a8!5shungry%20ghost%20coffee%20shop%20-%20google%20search&amp;imagekey=!1e2!2sz-gjfbah-ahqhp3gp6fkug&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewikxvv6w5tmahuu-gmkhvzlb4iqob8ijqewdg ) . 
  it has 4 tables . 
  so they allow people to sit for extended periods of time with just a `` coffee and a cookie '' , they lose potential customers that are not entitled snowflakes . 
  so , is this the obama of cats ? 
  and sparta, 
  simon schama 's * power of art * series . 
  amazingly done and insightful . 
  the first one reminds me of a [ kore ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/kore_heraion_samos_louvre_ma686.jpg ) ( greek clothed female standing statue ) from the island of samos, 
  you can . 
  have you tried [ this ] ( http://support.jide.com/hc/en-us/articles/216405567-how-to-run-remix-os-for-pc-on-surface-pro-3 - ) guide ? 
  you will probably need a fast usb 3 drive though . 
  i think the base garment follows the general form of the greek [ chiton ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uwng1lz.jpg ) but it can also draw inspiration from the early 20th century long gowns . 
  it 's amazing either way . 
  goodbye horses ... 
  that last bit was purely an invention for the film . 
  in the books gandalf simply takes the items that belonged to frodo and sam and tells him to vanish . 
  that 's the crux of the problem . 
  they do n't want to stop eating the ~ ~ y ~ ~ quantities eat when they were fat . 
  they might follow a fad diet for a little while and then complain that `` diets do n't work '' when they start overeating again . 
  it is very hard to think that you might need to change your entire lifestyle in order to lose weight - it was for me until my gut started hanging over my belt . 
  i remember a relevant passage in the books but not in the series . 
  the greeks , too . 
  [ this ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/727/22249920340_3703085baa_k.jpg ) is the doorway of a wealthy residence in athens, 
  it was built on the 1840 's and the decoration is inspired by ancient greek imagery . 
  the swastika was a favorite motif since the 8th century b.c. 
  ellaria is also an oathbreaker . 
  she had sworn to follow doran and his plans in the aftermath of her failed assassination attempt towards myrcella . 
  was n't myrcella also a guest when she was poisoned ? 
  i agree . 
  she was nominally in dornish soil ( or sea ) but i doubt show ellaria gives a damn . 
  she is already kinslayer and oathbreaker . 
  it 's a pity the show took an interesting character from the book and twisted it into something absurd and illogical . 
  yep , the venues were ready on time , it was the security concerns that skyrocketed after 11/9 and ended up costing 10 times more . 
  and in the end the security system did n't work properly so the army had to step in and offer additional security . 
  i did n't check the subreddit before playing the gif and for a bit i thought he would be as cool as mason when he [ lost ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kplbcly.gif ) his drumstick at live at pompeii . 
  this was more amusing . 
  it 's a habit . 
  when i am recording dates at work i have to follow a certain pattern and it 's very difficult to switch , even for something as iconic as ~ ~ 11/9 ~ ~ 9/11, 
  yep , in order to download anything from my works access to jstor ( historical and archaeological papers ) i have to contact my supervisor who opens a special vpn that expires after 5 minutes . 
  it 's way easier to open sci-hub and be done in seconds . 
  ecumenical . 
  yes , i might have seen that episode yesterday . 
  he did have a * small * loan of $ 1.000.000.000 from his father . 
  something is weird around the lips . 
  he also had to follow colbert . 
  the guy ca n't catch a break !, 
  his skit with boehner was also great . 
  his deadpan style reminded me a bit of norm mcdonalds delivery , though obama 's jokes are way better . 
  mcdonald had the gift of making bad jokes sound amazing . 
  exactly that !, 
  you do n't need a facebook or twitter account , just phone the previous supervisors .
