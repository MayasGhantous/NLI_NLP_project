   this is good meat . 
   feed it to the hounds . 
  edd is the biden to jon 's obama . 
  i was half-expecting roose to be wearing some kind of armor under his leathers . 
  he is smarter than that . 
  this specific clip starts around 1.53.10 . 
  it 's even worse with sound . 
  the closest word i can think of might be * \u03be\u03b5\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 * , but i doubt it 's something that would look good in a tattoo, 
   http://i.imgur.com/hevhxun.jpg\u00a0 spartan mother and father bidding their son farewell before he leaves for battle . 
  maybe this is where they would 've uttered the words , `` with it , or upon it '', 
  very nice photos , the one i quote is mislabeled though . 
  it seems like a standard classical ( around the middle of the 4th century b.c ) grave stele from athens and the standing , mostly missing figure is definitely a woman . 
  no problem . 
  lots of these sculptures are in most archaeology textbooks . 
  this [ statue ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bemmzjw.jpg ) is thought to be a roman copy of a lost greek original depicting protesilaus , the first greek to land in trojan soil and the first to die . 
  maybe we could split the cost on a bulk order ? 
  i also want a swedish wife . 
  your parents have no leg to stand on when it comes to age differences !, 
  * brought out by the sea * . 
  but it 's a word that you 'd also use for any kind of garbage that can be found at the seashore . 
  what is dead may never die !, 
  amazing . 
  i had never though of that !, 
  the moto g3 is a very good ( and relatively cheap ) device . 
  my nephew is a fisherman and he swears the waterproofing on his is amazing . 
  it seems that the process did not affect the victims bodies . 
  moaning myrtle , hapziban smith and riddle sr. were all used for the ritual but their bodies were not disfigured or mutilated . 
  jk was referring to the process pettigrew used to create a rudimentary body for voldemort in albania . 
  i am copying from a comment below, 
   there are two things i think that are too horrible , actually , to go into detail about . 
  one of them is how pettigrew brought voldemort back into a rudimentary body . 
  'cause i told my editor what i thought happened there and she looked as though she was gon na vomit . 
  and then the other thing is how you make a horcrux . 
  well ... there is a fan theory that bertha jorkins was pregnant when she was captured . 
  make of that what you will . 
  he felt the point though . 
  and then the rest of the dagger . 
  karl rove was still insisting even at the day of the election that romney was going to win ohio . 
  [ megyn kelly had to go interview ] ( https://youtu.be/9twur0jcavk ) their `` decision desk '' that gave the call for obama .

  my friends are furious . 
  `` food and the eternal quest for sustenance is an ecumenical experience through the millennia of human existence . 
  tell me john , shall we order pizza or gyros ? '', 
  the symbol on the obverse looks like a cornucopia to me . 
  edit : also , the double line of text on the right of the symbol reminds me a bit of the coins of the seleucids . 
  just a hunch though . 
  ey had me fooled for a second . 
  there is also '' \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac \u03bf\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 '' as a shorter version of the above,

  droid activations starts at 30 seconds in . 
  i am not sure about germany , but , as a general rule in the eu , the manufacturer is responsible for the insurance for two years after the sale . 
  not really . 
  if you buy a laptop or a phone and it stops working after 1,5 years you can have it repaired or replaced without charge , provided you did not directly damage the device . 
  so , falls and water damage are not usually covered , but everything else is usually included . 
  i am referring to this [ law/regulation ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm ) . 
  under this i was able to replace two hdds ( one that developed bad sectors , one that started to overheat ) , headphones with damaged cords and even a whole laptop that started to restar just before the two year limit . 
  the seller can offer additional services ( i think these are more common in the us ) that can cover damage caused by the owner usually covering shattered screens or water damage but these are in addition to the mandatory minimum . 
  i see . 
  we get replacements for up to two years and they cover everything that 's not `` obviously '' the buyers fault . 
  that 's obviously not covered . 
  one way or another you have to pay extra . 
  not all damage . 
  usually shattered screens and water damage are considered the users fault and are excluded . 
  it 's my fault . 
  in my country we use the same term for insurance ( by a third ) party and warranty ( by the manufacturer ) . 
  i also believe that few people choose to buy an additional service and these are mainly the people that choose the high end devices . 
  drop some large rocks , plant a few cacti , throw in a few snakes and some scorpions and you are set . 
  they should have done something about jesus , too . 
  he is showing a lot of * porn shoulder * . 
  the music was glorious .

  in modern greek is * \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9 * ( pothi ) and it can refer to the whole leg . 
  it comes from the ancient greek * \u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 , \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2 * . 
  maybe tormund tried to `` steal '' her to prove he is worthy ? 
  the saudis have already desecrated the place by themselves . 
  they destroyed the [ original layout ] ( http://www.beautifulmosque.com/postimages/old-kaaba-pictures-28.jpg ) and [ built highrises ] ( http://i.imgur.com/82jidgd.jpg ) on the hill where the medieval fort used to be . 
  i would settle for the complete george rr martin . 
  exactly . 
  i just ate a spinach , lettuce and tuna salad for lunch and the total carbs were under 3 grams . 
  there are a lot of vegetables that are low in net carbs - you just have to pay attention to the labels ( or any nutrition app ) .
