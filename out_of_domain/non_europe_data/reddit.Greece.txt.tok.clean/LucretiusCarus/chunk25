  same for me . 
  east hastings is a masterpiece . 
  that movie got me into post-rock . 
  fuck the children, 
  why should jaqen h ` ghar be involved in my sex life ? 
  umi super is going to be released soon and it looks promising . 
  stock android marshmallow , fingerprint reader , 4000mah battery , 4 gb ram , sd card and all metal build . 
  ca n't comment on the authenticity of the watches , but the [ painting ] ( https://p3.liveauctioneers.com/1124/81661/42355803_2_l.jpg ) in the urania is by the minor italian artist fabio fabbi . 
  there is a similar greek saying . 
  `` we build as if we are going to live forever and eat as if we are going to die tomorrow '' . 
  lenovo is always a prime target . 
  could be regional ? 
  i heard it a lot growing up in serres . 
  that 's `` deranged millionaire john hodgman '' , right ? 
  always loved [ this photo ] ( http://algoxy.com/psych/images/wtccoreshilouette.jpg ) of the old trade center . 
  you can really see the structure behind the fa\u00e7ade and appreciate the engineering aspect . 
  it 's [ traditional ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8ep94smk_eg/urf795-z3si/aaaaaaaajzy/fass3ptwaqy/s1600/fight-in-shade.gif ), 
  dozens !, 
  is there any other way ? 
  i would suggest rembrandt . 
  he looks a lot like the old [ rabbinical figures ] ( http://www.codart.nl/ul/cms/news/800/large/1.jpg ) he used to paint . 
  i am working on a museum collection that used paper tags since the 60 's . 
  the amount of missing , unreadable and misplaced tags is mind boggling . 
  give me a sharpied artifact anytime , it 's what we transition to anyway . 
  and of course we never write directly on the artifact . 
  i first apply a transparent paraloid solution , then i write on that surface and then i seal it with another paraloid layer . 
  removal is easy with just some acetone . 
  i am pretty sure its the same method they used one the dagger . 
  it 's even worse when you find a labeled item that was n't in the catalog and you have already given that number to another item . 
  i am guessing erection problems . 
  it 's something you could be expected to hear in the colbert report . 
  you are correct . 
  i think he used henna . 
  the plot thickens !, 
  that 's really interesting . 
  the price is great but the camera is rather meh . 
  he is also risking diabeetus . 
  the most american of diseases . 
  truly god 's gift !, 
  ( * theodoros * , the greek version of the name comes from * \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 + \u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd / god + gift * ), 
  also amazing in vicious !, 
  * `` did you see what she was wearing ? 
  he would have made a great severus snape . 
  i am kinda hoping they will just go with gendry in his little boat , never to be seen again . 
  this is amazing , the amount of coordination between the guys on each `` floor '' must be crazy !, 
  and then , the little spiderkids climbing up . 
  the [ athena ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fdyzfye.jpg ) from the pediment of the archaic parthenon is depicted the same way . 
  excellent review !, 
  i am between this phone and vernee 's apollo lite . 
  do you have any insight on the apollo ? 
  i am an archaeologist and i really do n't know how i would respond to someone claiming that the world is 6000 years old . 
  just yesterday i was handling a neolithic pottery fragment roughly 7000 years old and that 's not even the oldest one i have seen . 
  you have to be hugely ignorant to believe this idiocy . 
  she was amazing in the newsroom . 
  has she been in anything of comparable quality ? 
  i love how the first kittens hind legs twitch every few seconds, 
  i remember her briefly as a daily show correspondent . 
  she was also good , but left too soon to leave a mark . 
  cercei 's dress was amazing . 
  she wore her own kind of panoply and she killed all her enemies ( and many more innocent bystanders ) . 
  and have him redo all the dorne scenes . 
  although the writing was more to blame there . 
  i think in the tower of hand fire she used alchemists to guide and contain the flames . 
  on the other hand , the explosion at the sept was uncontrolled and she possibly wanted the maximum amount of destruction . 
  do n't forget margaery 's . 
  that silvery flowing gown was perfect . 
  pious and modest , yet totally in her nature . 
  we never had a montage for lancel , right ? 
  granpa was poisoned by his enemies, 
  leroy did a pettigrew, 
  poisoned by their enemies . 
  it 's the [ obama double standard ] ( https://vimeo.com/channels/493367/39115241 ), 
  and the paper . 
  he has the pest paper , no questions about it . 
  the spaceship has landed !, 
  this is amazing . 
  - hey dad , i got a b my report card !, 
  - but it 's not an a , is it , son ? 
  and full of errors !, 
  she is a far better person than i am . 
  if someone told me all that bullshit i would have been furious . 
  unemployment in greece is stable at 25-26 % . 
  there are no riots ( yet ) but if it was 42 % the parliament would be on fire . 
  you are right . 
  things are bad . 
  not venezuela bad , but prospects are grim . 
  it 's funny in a way . 
  the current populist government was encouraging riots , strikes and roadblocks when they were in opposition . 
  now that they are in power they think that demonstrations are a danger to the constitution . 
  not just the columns . 
  there is a slight curvature to the steps that transfers to the entablature and the pediments . 
  also , the facades are not entirely vertical but lean slightly towards the interior . 
   big bang theory '' with no laugh track,

   vincent van gogh as tywin . 
  the dutch painter ? 
  ah , i see it , thanks . 
  i have it and i do n't suggest it . 
  lots of users ( me included ) have lost access to the sd card and teclast has done nothing to help . 
  a few weeks ago they even pushed a windows update that bricked the entire tablet .
