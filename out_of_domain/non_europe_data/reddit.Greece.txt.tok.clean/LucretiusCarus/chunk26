  if you are willing to risk it , go for it . 
  just do n't expect support from the company , or any updates . 
  it seems more similar to mannerism , something around [ pontormo ] ( http://www.gailsibley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/jacopo-pontormo-1.png ) or [ greco ] ( http://history.hanover.edu/courses/art/elgrtr.jpg ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://dp88pot7smo43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bearded-man-e1430923554819.jpg ), 
  it 's his `` come-hither '' look . 
  i really hoped that they would cast [ mads mikkelsen ] ( http://66.media.tumblr.com/216b79ff6e8f2b242b6ccdd4af7c29ef/tumblr_mpp0c5idvu1rggtjlo1_500.jpg ) for the role . 
  he proved he can act the psychopath . 
  this is delicious . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  i ordered a cubot note s for my niece and i had i it for a little in my hands . 
  clean android ( still 5.1 but with the latest security patches ) , huge 4000 mah battery , 2 gb of ram , 16 gb in internal storage , msd support and a decent 5.5 720p screen . 
  the camera is almost decent in good light and really shitty in low light situations though . 
  not bad if you just use it for facebook , music and light games , especially for $ 60 . 
  i ordered from geekbuing . 
  it was the same price with the aliexpress stores but with the additional cover of paypal . 
  it took one day to process and ship and ten days to reach me in greece . 
  you can check kimovil.com to see what store is cheaper , plus you can usually find coupons and promotional codes for additional discounts, 
  the apollo lite is listed at kimovil as having wifi ac . 
  they confirmed that in the forum , too, 
  and 30 years of supreme court justices approved by the heritage foundation . 
  ten points to griffindor !, 
  the fountain . 
  the effects are timeless and the acting is spot on . 
  `` of course there are no poor people in the usa . 
  just temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '', 
  i think the quote is attributed to steinbeck , but i could be wrong . 
  i am more impressed by the fact that two guys , one on the left and one on the right , stand on delicate spindly-legged tables . 
  he might be an ios user . 
  oh , i know . 
  i have inherited some furniture from my gran and i am sure they can withstand a nuclear explosion . 
  solid wood and cast iron are practically immortal , if properly maintained . 
  you must be mistaken . 
  these ridiculous lines were never spoken . 
  like a high school girl that did n't get the car in the exact color that she wanted for her 18th birthday . 
  this is actually restoring some faith in humanity . 
  born under a bleeding middle class . 
  born amidst salty tears . 
  exactly . 
  it was [ hippodamus of miletos ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hippodamus_of_miletus ) that set the foundations of city planning in strict orthogonal grids . 
  he was responsible for pireaus and rhodes , but his influence reached the romans as well . 
  disclaimer : i am not from athens , just a visitor . 
  there are some nice places but overall the city is indeed ugly . 
  i would suggest the pedestrian streets under the acropolis ( makrygianni , dionysiou areopagitou and apostolou paulou ) . 
  from what i remember you have the acropolis on the one side and a lot of beautiful neoclasical and art deco buildings on the other . 
  plus you can visit a lot of museum on the way ( the new acropolis museum , lalaounis jewelry museum , kermeikos museum , benaki museum of islamic art ) . 
  i also like kypseli . 
  there are a lot of tags and graffiti , but the mid-century buildings give a sense of what athens was before greed took over . 
  this is great !, 
  my new desktop background, 
  ouch !, 
  no , it 's from the shores of croatia, 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/croatian_apoxyomenos_louvre_n02.jpg ) is the whole statue . 
  a magnificent artifact . 
  is it just me , or the chest is really high ? 
  it seems a bit unnatural . 
  is n't there a point where the author spends chapters rambling about the ideal city ? 
  and ranting about bows and arrows being better than guns ? 
  a [ strigil ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/strigil ) . 
  athletes used oil to cover their bodies before exercising . 
  after their time in the palaistra and before the bath they used a curved blade to scrape the grime off their bodies.the name of the statue directly translates thar action ( the one who scrapes ) . 
  it was also probably designed to be looked [ from below ] ( http://www.worldfortravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/liberty-statue.jpg ) and at a distance , so some features were exaggerated in order to be visible . 
  the tres got him, 
  i red the name of the rose at 13 . 
  the first 100 pages were hard and lots of the rest went straight over my head but i focused on the murder mystery aspect and got through it . 
  i revisited it in high school and was blown away . 
  i thought they usually just pick a desk . 
   i 'm pretty sure each of the adult obamas has more education than trump 's entire family . 
  i am pretty sure that extends to sasha and malia , too . 
  samantha 's responses were amazing , after the initial sock . 
  `` aww , you think cars will be lined up around the corner ? '', 
  maybe an [ abstract ] ( http://www.rca.gr/files/cca/nikos-alexiou-puli-a/1_507.jpg ) but characteristic mosaic pattern ? 
  it comes from the [ iviron monastery ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_soadu_uof8a/r62ev6ufkwi/aaaaaaaabwu/rixeyqdr4pc/s1600-h/alexiou_end+2007_page63-15.jpg ) on mount athos , but the pattern is found from the early christian times and is still used in byzantine iconography . 
  so , `` no realz , only tweetz '' ? 
  what a tortured thought process . 
  i am certain there is a fanfiction of this already . 
  and if not , will soon be written . 
  what has romney ever done to deserve this fate ? 
  `` we have carefully compiled a list of highly competent women entrepreneurs that we can consider ... . '', 
  or a de chirico [ painting ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/63/41/2c/63412cf7008be938493d857dadea4c2f.jpg ) . 
  it will be interesting to see the autopsy they are going to perform for this election . 
  i bet the creature on the table will look like something from an alien movie . 
   trump 's statement on turkey . 
  or trump 's statements about not defending allied nato countries . 
  [ here ] ( http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pennsylvania-could-be-an-electoral-tipping-point/ ) is a good writeup . 
   western pennsylvania is driving the state 's rightward drift -- its voting patterns now resemble greater appalachia 's more than those of the philadelphia suburbs . 
  once dominated by steel towns and union democrats , the region has reveled in a fracking/natural gas boom that has more recently experienced a downturn and has revolted against epa regulations . 
  obama 's infamous `` bitter clingers '' remark in 2008 did n't do democrats any favors either . 
  his hannibal was amazing , especially the finale . 
  if anything , he improved on the material . 
  i ca n't wait for american gods, 
  have you been to the_donald ? 
  in the two plates they are in the shape of a heart . 
  i am not sure if it is sad or pathetic . 
  a rock , probably . 
  i ordered one , waiting for delivery . 
  and the other republican in the panel claimed that hillary can be bought because she accepted donations ? 
  why no one reminded him that donald is also fundraising ? 
  sure , i will do a mini review when it arrives . 
  alexis is usually the short form of alexandros . 
  most men use the short form , but women use alexandra or aleka .
