  ( so sorry ! ), 
  thanks obama, 
   if vaccinations really do cause autism then donald trump is a posterboy for the flu shot . 
  damn , that 's perfect . 
  i think mine was from the father of the dead muslim soldier : `` mr. trump , you did n't sacrifice anything '' . 
  it was chilling . 
  safe spaces , safe spaces everywhere . 
  ginsburg and roberts are in their late 70 's , right ? 
  i know they are appointed for life , but they might choose to retire at some point in the next 4-8 years . 
  ah , yeah , i was thinking of breyer . 
  i think hayes [ said ] ( https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/753967524820185088 ) it perfectly . 
  also , cleopatra is closer to us than she was to cheops . 
  egypt has a huge historical span and it 's a pity some people want to reduce it to a bunch of stereotypes ( `` we waz kangz '' ), 
  you will be hard pressed to find a country that has n't known terrorist activities ; france , germany , russia , norway , uk , ireland , greece , spain , italy , turkey , etc. 
  we can also expect the gold winners to be milked for their semen and shot in the head after the games . 
   does not get old, 
  well , it will get old , eventually . 
  and then trump will jump to the next 13-year-old . 
  and the `` this is much easier to get a purple heart '' comment . 
  `` reduce spending '', 
  proceeds to fire an insane amount of bullets on a ... river ? 
  `` then we will fight in the shades '' . 
  leonidas in the flesh . 
  desi was amazing . 
  and her baby is indeed the cutest . 
  you ca n't put a price in freedom , buddy . 
  it 's the same for hillary . 
  she just has to not fuck up . 
  her campaign should be just retweeting all the stupid stuff trump says . 
  both have brown people , checks out . 
   its maybe their first time they read ~ ~ a scientific paper , of course they understand nothing of it . ~ ~ anything other than the terms and conditions of the latest toy . 
  i think that 's a bit more accurate . 
  sometimes it [ backfires ] ( http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/__new/n_hardball_4dukakis_131118.blocks_desktop_large.jpg ) , though . 
  and it is messy as hell . 
  the two soldiers on the chest look more like hobbits than human . 
  and are the supposed to be coming out of the sea ? 
  before the coverup it was just a cheesy tattoo . 
  now its a clusterfuck . 
  they even had the same ( slightly ) claustrophobic glass room !, 
  the venues at the hellenikon olympic site were supposed to be reused/remodelled after the olympics . 
  sadly no one planned anything so the only venue still in use there is the basketball stadium . 
  the rest will be incorporated in foster 's [ master plan ] ( http://s28.postimg.org/y0povlwml/masterplan_composite_hellinikon_2.jpg ) for the redevelopment of the whole area . 
  it 's like his super secret plan to defeat isis . 
  why share the details and let barack hussein obama take the credit ? 
  we have the best bots, 
  to be fair , it 's the only gymnastics they will ever excell at . 
  [ eiffel tower !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbhjrbf0n6c ), 
  make johnson great again !, 
  heresy !, 
  it 's christine and the queens . 
  nice to meet you mr. trump !, 
  i am certain trump has no idea what ` pay for play ' is and he probably believes ` quid pro quo ' is a kind of fried shrimp . 
  yes , first impressions matter . 
  in the most recent ( i think ) keepin ' it 1600 podcast , the two former obama advisers stated that the media questioned obama about his first mediocre debate , even after the second . 
  all trump has to do is just stay on message for once . 
  aka `` mar ' a lago '' . 
  i still remember that devastating [ daily show episode ] ( http://www.cc.com/video-clips/i58xmo/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-worst-responders ) that stewart did with the first responders when the senete republican filibustered the zedroga bill . 
  long story short , the gop used the 9/11 when it was convenient , and promptly forgot it when it came time to support the victims in any way beyond platitudes . 
  joke comment for sure . 
  he would n't say ` biographies ' - too many syllables - he 'd say ` books ' . 
  when was the last time denmark invaded a country on the other side of the planet ? 
  for most of us ( greek here ) war is not not really on the menu . 
  damn , some of the zegna paisley ties look amazing . 
  but i could never pull the style off . 
  those troops were not drafted guys ( like us ) but career/permanent personnel . 
  nice try though . 
  i know . 
  and if there was , the public might be less supportive of starting so many wars . 
  yeah , but with proper latin . 
  something like `` qua re agere non potest , stercore ego facio '', 
  any source or stats on the claim that illegals were committing voter fraud ? 
  this election will fuel a fuckton of polisci phds . 
  and movies , probably . 
  i am pretty sure the delusionals of the alt-right would try to spin it was into another hillary conspiracy to take down the 2a . 
  agree . 
  i still use my 13 moto x as a secondary device for the gym and car gps . 
  i think it 's the best designed device i ever held . 
  and i still have n't found a replacement app for the active display notifications . 
  not really . 
  i use viber and line in the gym and downloaded data in here maps in the car . 
  exactly , the only data i use is wifi when my playlists or maps synchronize . 
  i did not buy a second device , i upgraded and i did not want to leave it in a drawer . 
  same as tax returns ? 
  she could also claim she was being `` sarcastic '' . 
  i hear good people saying that 's a valid excuse now . 
  she leaves the donald to torpedo his campaign . 
  she does n't have to do anything as long as the d has twitter access . 
  literally or sarcastically ? 
  quantum politics : you can only be sure about the wording of a trump statement , not it 's veracity . 
  pesky persian problems ... 
   finish race on his own terms , w / pals at his side . 
  the `` thelma and luise '' strategy . 
  [ correct !, 
  ] ( http://www.penhook.org/vase3.jpg ), 
  i 've seen almost every episode since 2009 but i think it 's the first time i see a guest run away from the set . 
  weird . 
  i am guessing these two are interconnected . 
  they had ( for obvious reasons ) had to cut a lot of smith 's interview so they added the first half interview with gyasi . 
  but then they went over the 20 minutes so they cut the last part of desi 's segment .
