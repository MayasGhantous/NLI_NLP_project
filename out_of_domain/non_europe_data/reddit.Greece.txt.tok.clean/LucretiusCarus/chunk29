  it also has the exact same problem in regards to the sd card . 
  better stick with something that will at least offer some support . 
  same story with christodoulos , the late archbishop of athens . 
  he rallied for years against the `` cursed enlightenment of the west '' , yet when he was diagnosed with cancer he went to the us for a liver transplant . 
  he was the worst hypocrite . 
  how time flies ... 
  in a way i think a close race ( or the perception of one ) might be more beneficial to the dems in the endgame . 
  they can argue that `` every vote counts '' and turn up their numbers , increasing their chances of taking back the senate . 
  you 'd be [ surprised ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/08/02/16/dabiq-15-kitten.jpg ) !, 
  apparently kittens are a part of [ the public image ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-kittens-honey-bees-dabiq-propaganda-recruits-photo-soften-image-terror-a7168586.html ) . 
  kittens and beheadings . 
  facts do n't really matter , did n't you get the memo ? 
  garbage , the hands are too big . 
  really , if your contract has ~ ~ anti-defamation ~ ~ non-disparagement clauses but not payment specifics , maybe ask about it instead of blindly trusting trump to come through . 
   she 's on the run from the cops or something, 
  wait , what ? 
  `` willies , willies , i love willies ! '', 
  i hate and love this election cycle . 
  he also gives money to his foundation . 
  the same foundation that bribes attorneys in various states to drop lawsuits against his `` university '' . 
  he was marvelous in hannibal . 
  i lived every minute of his screentime in the show . 
  i could blame it on my fat fingers but i am leaving it . 
  the last fifteen minutes of the season finale i felt i was really in the set with the actors . 
  [ here ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/295273-trump-i-would-shoot-at-confrontational-iranian-ships ) . 
   when the gop presidential nominee laid out his plan to modernize the military during a friday night rally in pensacola , fla. , he took an off-script aside to address his posture toward iran . 
   `` with iran , when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they should n't be allowed to make , they will be shot out of the water , '' trump said to loud cheers . 
   rally-goers could be heard shouting `` shoot them '' as trump wound up . 
  it seems she waited for labor day to pass . 
  same with press availability . 
  trump was being sarcastic . 
  or maybe not . 
  trump 's razor : if it sounds like it was said by a hillbilly in the 50 's , but with the vocabulary and the syntax of a 7-year-old , it was probably said by trump . 
  it 's ironic that he called hillary `` trigger happy '' [ two days ago ] ( http://www.kxlf.com/story/33041014/donald-trump-says-of-hillary-clinton-shes-trigger-happy-and-unstable ) . 
  his next remark makes it a bit clearer :, 
   `` putin laughs , believe me , he laughs at our leaders and takes us to the cleaners again and again , '' he said . 
  `` yesterday , we had a plane , he had jets circling the plane . 
  they were as close as 10 feet away -- taunting us , toying with us -- just like iran . '', 
  gustav eiffel was responsible for the structural engineering of the supporting framework . 
  the whole thing was assembled in his workshop first before it was dismantled and packaged for transportation . 
  it 's not just a sculpture , it 's a feat of engineering . 
  from the transcript of his commander in chief debate, 
   lauer : so is the plan you 've been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan ? 
  but when i do come up with a plan that i like and that perhaps agrees with mine , or maybe does n't -- i may love what the generals come back with . 
  i will convene ... **, 
   lauer : but you have your own plan ? 
   trump : ** i have a plan . 
  but i want to be -- i do n't want to -- look . 
  i have a very substantial chance of winning . 
  make america great again . 
  we 're going to make america great again . 
  i have a substantial chance of winning . 
  if i win , i do n't want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is . 
   lauer : but you 're going to ... 
   trump : ** and let me tell you , if i like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals ' plan , or the generals ' plan , if i like their plan , matt , i 'm not going to call you up and say , `` matt , we have a great plan . '' this is what obama does . 
  `` we 're going to leave iraq on a certain day . '' **, 
   lauer : but you 're going to convene a panel of generals , and you 've already said you know more about isis than those generals do . 
   trump : well , they 'll probably be different generals , to be honest with you . 
  i mean , i 'm looking at the generals , today , you probably saw , i have a piece of paper here , i could show it , 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today . 
  that 's not speaking to a level that makes your points understandable to a wide audience , that 's what happens when you put a thesaurus through a mixer . 
  or when you have nothing substantial to say and make up things on the fly . 
  i think it 's a variation of a standard rove tactic `` take your weakness and hurl it at your opponent '' . 
  but for this to work you 'll have to hide or minimize your weaknesses . 
  trump is projecting them like giant bat signals for all to see . 
  i have it for three weeks now . 
  [ camera is mediocre ] ( http://bbs.vernee.cc/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1160&amp;extra=page%3d1 ) in good light and very bad in low light . 
  an ota update removed the 4k video capability and throttled the cpu because of overheating problems . 
  it also seems that the aperture is wrongly advertised . 
  exif shows it 's 2.2 and not the 2.0 vernee claims . 
  when i first got it it had an antutu score of ~ 92.000 but after the update it 's close to 85.000 . 
  battery lasts for a day and ~ 4 hours of sot . 
  the fingerprint reader is extremely hit or miss ( mine recognises 1 in 5 ) . 
  [ in a lot of cases ] ( http://bbs.vernee.cc/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1134&amp;extra=page%3d1 ) the plastic around the screen develops small cracks . 
  there is an official forum [ here ] ( http://bbs.vernee.cc/forum-40-1.html ) but vernee does n't really responds to bugs or problems . 
  lots of people face connectivity issues and battery drain . 
  mine seems to not have this problem . 
  i have used a lot of different camera apps . 
  it 's not just a software problem , the hardware is shitty . 
  no problem . 
  i am pretty sure there are people that have none of my problems and some that might have more . 
  the gist it 's that you get what you paid for and it seems that one of the corners that was cut was the camera and fingerprint sensors . 
  on the plus size , vernee has committed to release the source code in order to facilitate independent development ( their thor already has cyanogen running ) , so some of the problems might go away . 
  also , the screen and the metal body are rather good . 
   well-done steak, 
  you mean taco bowl . 
  the hill in the photo is not the acropolis ( [ where the parthenon iiiiiis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdvd4fhc_k8&amp;feature=youtu.be ) ) but lycabettus , the highest point in athens . 
  it 's lit up because there are pathways to the peak where you can have one of the greatest [ views ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6yfpg3a.jpg ) of athens . 
  the odyssey and illiad , medea and antigone , the foundations of geometry , architecture , sculpture , logic , mathematics , physics , cosmology , philosophy and literature , just to cover 2 centuries in ancient greece . 
  * the taking of the ball *, 
  it 's a magnificent sculpture , even for a copy . 
  as for the color of the marble , it was probably painted in antiquity though it 's true that the reddish foundation would give additional depth to the surface . 
  if i remember correctly the original was attributed to a pergamene artist . 
  they are written as bullies in * the lie i 've lived * . 
  but the most annoying aspect is the cheesy `` twinkspeak '' that seems irresistible to most writers . 
  that 's almost worse , `` oh brother of mine '', 
  * fans himself *, 
  his vp also . 
  a perfect fit . 
  the former . 
  i have no problem with silent communication or glances that lead to deductions , it 's the gred-and-forge-the-sentence-completers that grinds my gears .
