  reading news about middle east and afghanistan reminds me of dystopian science fiction . 
  i bought this one three weeks ago . 
  i cooked 6-7 meals and all turned out great . 
  the metal pot is perfect for those recipes that advise searing the meat before cooking . 
  plus i do n't have to worry about cracking the ceramic ware that most other models have . 
  very good !, 
  i 'm sure it will suit you just fine . 
  i just finished cooking a chocolate lava cake and it 's delicious !, 
  i really do n't care if it 's by a pupil . 
  it 's fucking perfect !, 
  the warm reflection of the gold and the cool glint of the gorget are painted perfectly . 
  it 's almost a study in textures . 
  to be fair though , would you ever leave , if you had his money and his houseboat ? 
  sure !, 
  [ here ] ( http://hellolittlehouse.com/2012/10/slow-cooker-choc-lava-cake/ ) it is . 
  just divide every quantity by half and you 'll have yourself a nice dessert . 
  also , check [ this ] ( http://hellolittlehouse.com/2012/10/slow-cooker-lemon-blueberry-blondies/ ) out . 
  the city [ helike ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helike ) in ancient greece is reported to have vanished in a flood with all the statues , temples and buildings visible under the water . 
  also the aegean sea in general is full with ancient shipwrecks that are still unexcavated . 
  i ' pretty sure pericles never uttered the words in the last pic . 
  even better with vinegar and some finely chopped fresh dill and basil, 
  source : i am greek and grew up making this stuff . 
  thank you - and good luck to you too . 
  in my case it 's the stupid cravings that spoil any progress . 
  and of course my line of work ( i am an archaeologist ) that usually thwarts any diet that requires highly disciplined/measured meals . 
  usually i go for fatty/salty foods . 
  typically any leftovers from my lunch would be my after-dinner delight sometimes though i go for a chocolate or sweet snack bar . 
  very nice !, 
  i really like your cross-hatching . 
  any comments ? 
  thanks !, 
  i just watched your videos , you are right , we really look the same ( even down to the [ beard ] ( http://imgur.com/k7pg8z0 ) ) . 
  very well made , too !, 
  thank you again for the encouragement . 
  in greece ? 
  we were obliged to build 15 new stadiums for all the imaginable sports the ioc included . 
  also , the were the first olympics ofte 9/11 and some countries ( usa , uk , aus ) threatened to boycott unless we bought a 2 billion security system - that never really worked . 
  that horse-dancing thing they introduced in 2004 . 
  it 's less prominent in the [ original ] ( http://i.imgur.com/onxp5nj.jpg ) sketch by nikolaos gyzis . 
  yes , even though there were suitable venues that could cover most of the events , the ioc demanded new stadiums be built for fencing , basketball , badminton , table tennis , wrestling , shooting , softball and baseball ( along with some others i ca n't really remember ) . 
  most greeks nowadays remember only the [ opening ceremony ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qlatmzdxxog#t=457s ) and tend to forget the costs . 
  i thought that was voluntary , based on the religion of the individual . 
  not really far . 
  i do n't really have much free time , so my most recent stuff are mainly doodles that may at some point be transfered to a more finished state . 
  you are right about the depth - i prefer statues because i can play with the shadows , giving the impression of perspective . 
  i 'll try to increase the contrast a bit . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  most of them are done during an excavation and drawing class at college . 
  the teacher would bring a replica of a well-known museum piece and we would try to sketch it in 1-1 .5 hour . 
  only the first ( the angel ) and the ninth ( the female head ) were made in my free time . 
  the first is based on a gyzis preparatory drawing and the head is a copy on a sketch by michelangelo . 
  i 'll try and scan some . 
  thank you , and yes most of these are indeed based in ancient greek sculptures . 
  most were made during a class in college ( excavation and drawing ) that emphasized mainly the technical aspect of the work ( in situ measurements of monuments or artifacts , but sometimes the teacher would bring a replica of an artwork from the university museum of casts and leave us free to experiment . 
  some of my classmates worked mainly with volumes and shadows , i followed a more linear approach . 
  two or three times we were escorted to the nearby [ archaological museum of thessaloniki ] ( http://amth.gr/index.php/en/2011-08-04-07-34-45.html ) where we left free to choose and draw a piece from the collection . 
  edit : i forgo a letter, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll try to find some time to draw again . 
  it 's been more than a year since i made anything more serious than a doodle !, 
  yeah , i really love this sculpture . 
  is one of the [ horses ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/jane_sanders/8325123887/ ) of selene ( the moon goddess ) from the east pediment of the parthenon, 
  thank you joey . 
  i 'm on the third day ( not really sure if i 'm actually on keto yet ) but most of my cravings seem to fade/subside . 
  nice idea !, 
  i 'm new to keto and i 'll definitely use this one tomorow . 
  thanx !, 
  most of them are made with a variety of pencils ranging from a mechanical .035 with hb graphite to the supersoft 8b . 
  i try to keep the same width but i usually fail in that regard . 
  the only consistency in my stuff is the direction of the hatching . 
  i rarely cross-hatch . 
  i 'm also on day three and today i confirmed i 'm in keto !, 
  i ca n't really smell anything different in my breath but this could be because i brush my teeth a lot during the day . 
  i know , my mouth feels a bit `` tangy '' in the last two days . 
  well spotted . 
  also , hands . 
  i never thought drawings of that style could be perceived as offending material . 
  sorry if i caused you trouble . 
  thanks !, 
  thank you for your comment , i definitely see your point . 
  in my latest stuff i tried various degrees of cross-hatching but i find it very inconsistent . 
  the dots or stripped graphite also seems messy to me . 
  i just supposed you worked in the bible belt . 
  have a great life !, 
  you are my hero !, 
  keep going !, 
  in the display of the bust in the neues museum it states that it was probably made that way . 
  i love how the transition from the mouth to the cheeks is rendered and the perfect dimples in the corners of fer lips . 
  the [ greeks ] ( http://www.ascsa.net/image?id=frantz%3aimage%3aat%20363;size=full ) had a real problem with this . 
  i just had a plate of slow-cooked beef with greens ( peas and carrots ) . 
  delicious and nurishing . 
  for breakfast scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon and for dinner a light salad with tuna and lettuce . 
  i know , but i do n't have anything else planned in my carb intake for today . 
  tomorrow i ' ll prepare some broccoli . 
  sounds a bit like the `` chase in moria '' soundtrack from lord of the rings . 
  looks yummy !, 
  is there any alternative to the almond flour ? 
  from what i understand the american medical system is perfect ... when you are healthy . 
  your insurance companies cover only a small portion of the bill and the hospitals even try to get the credit cards of the patients before they are even treated .
