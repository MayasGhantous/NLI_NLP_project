  so courage ,, 
  wow !, 
  at this point they are competing in the special olympics . 
  ... but not * that * sarcastic . 
  i think there was another proposed bill , in response to forced ultrasounds before prescriptions for plan b , that required prostate checks for viagra recipients . 
  he is [ moving his hands a lot ] ( http://theweek.com/speedreads/648817/donald-trump-apparently-counts-giving-speeches-part-exercise-routine ) on the rallies , so there is that . 
  the guy who wants to shoot the iranians for making rude hand gestures and wants to use nuclear is n't a war monger ? 
  i was like that during the first season ? 
  by the third season i was having my meals ( usually steak ) during the show . 
  fuck , that was unsettling . 
  what made me squirm was the season 2 opening , with, 
  spoiler, 
  spoiler, 
  spoiler, 
  the guy slowly detaching himself from the human mosaic . 
  spoiler, 
  spoiler, 
  spoiler, 
  you could argue that the debates are a job interview . 
  he went unprepared , erratic , combative and uneducated . 
  he should n't get a second interview . 
  nope , the next one will be forbes, 
  the east pediment depicted the birth of the goddess athena . 
  pausanias visited the temple and described in general terms the subjects , enough to know that the rest of the gods were present . 
  we can safely assume that the voluptuous reclined figure must be aphrodite , so that the figure supporting her from behind could be her mother , dione . 
  as for hestia it could be a process of elimination - she does n't seem to fit in any other surviving figure . 
  gatherings of gods have a long history in the iconography of greek art , present from the earliest black-figured vases to the late hellenistic creations . 
  it was an effective way to represent the different qualities of the divine aspect and possible to execute in many mediums , from the grand scale of wall paintings and sculpture to the smaller scale of vases and everyday objects . 
  there is a fence , but i am sure it is open for a few hours every day , depending on the season . 
  usually it 's 08.00-20 .00 for spring and summer . 
  tur is amazing . 
  she still follows trump around despite being targeted by him . 
  i think it 's the site of the temple of [ artemis orthia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanctuary_of_artemis_orthia ) , a cult with roots in the dark ages . 
  unfortunately little survives beyond the foundation of the temple . 
  far more impressive is the medieval city of [ mystras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mystras ) , located very close to modern sparta . 
  there are people that believe that sandy hook was staged . 
  their grip on reality is tenuous at best . 
  no worries !, 
  it 's an amazing experience . 
  sadly only the [ palaces ] ( http://www.exploresparta.gr/tourism/tnedirfsp/uploads/2014/04/sights_of_interest_churches_monasteries_of_mystras_031.jpg ) [ of the ] ( http://www.exploresparta.gr/tourism/tnedirfsp/uploads/2014/04/sights_of_interest_churches_monasteries_of_mystras_011.jpg ) [ despots ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8388/28969532212_436c79be81_o.jpg ) are restored and only some of the [ houses ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8143/28818323916_7e01932966_b.jpg ) but the [ many ] ( http://www.exploresparta.gr/tourism/tnedirfsp/uploads/2014/04/sights_of_interest_churches_monasteries_of_mystras_081.jpg ) [ churches ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8221/28969583432_3ef6a9093c_k.jpg ) , [ monasteries ] ( http://www.exploresparta.gr/tourism/tnedirfsp/uploads/2014/04/sights_of_interest_churches_monasteries_of_mystras_061.jpg ) the [ frescoes ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5005/30032750711_9e5305abda_b.jpg ) that decorate them are magnificent . 
  if you are also interested in living in a medieval town , close to sparta is the small island of [ monemvasia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monemvasia ) , that is largely unchanged for the last 400 years . 
  nobody is better than [ mason in live at pompeii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kplbcly.gif ), 
  and what a terrifying vision !, 
  i got a really weird attenborough vibe . 
  almost like a description of a mating dance . 
  bill maher is reasonably sharp . 
  most of the time . 
  very nice !, 
  what is your equipment and setup ? 
  thanks for the details . 
  to minimize the camera shake you can use your timer to 10 seconds - it should be enough . 
  your iso is also a bit high . 
  since you use a tripod a value of ~ 200 should be the top . 
  i would also suggest a black background for the silvers . 
  it makes them [ pop ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9tprkdi.jpg ) !, 
  no problem . 
  for the black backgrounds i usually use the aperture mode , with the iso at 200 and the ev at -2 or -3 depending on the light ( i only have natural lighting ) . 
  it takes a few tries to get it correct but it gets easier with practice . 
  and expecting their first kid , right ? 
  i do n't think you could buy much . 
  it 's probably a bronze drachm , the equivalent to a days wage . 
  also , greeks at that time did n't have sugar ( they used honey ) or the tea varieties we use today ( they did have chamomile though ) . 
  a painting from an esteemed artist , let 's say apelles , was worth more than a years wages and could be bought only by the aristocracy of the time . 
  it 's not really expensive , more like $ 30 . 
  bronze coins like this were produced by the thousands and lot 's of them have survived to these days . 
  silver coins go for a lot more and gold ones are usually damn expensive . 
  source : work in a museum and have evaluated lots of coins that were brought by people finding them in their fields . 
  will it be even weirder to learn that in the original greek it means '' ( the one who is ) fond of horses '' ? 
   interested in how he grabs this . 
  by the pussy . 
  he grabs it by the pussy . 
   one giddy clinton ally put it this way :, 
   `` this is what we call irony ... a guy who really loves f -- ing , you know , he basically just f -- ed himself out of the race . '', 
  that should be their new slogan . 
  he also talked to birds . 
  there is anothere excellent piece by [ 538 ] ( http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-clinton-field-offices/ ) describing the differences between hillary 's and trump 's gotv operations with references also to romney and obama . 
  at this point i am willing to bet it will look more like the snl cold open than even to the previous debate . 
  `` and do n't get me started on king david ! '', 
  damn , sorry , fixed . 
  he also told kasich to rally behind trump if he wanted a chance to run again in 2020 . 
   bill kristol is going to drive him out of town with a flaming trident . 
  i love this imagery . 
  ... and he bought them furniture . 
  found the archaeologist !, 
  nature has ... uh , a way of shutting it down . 
  i hope , for her sake , that she took the money up front . 
  because we now know what donny does to contractors that he thinks performed unsatisfactory . 
  their live podcasts are always amazing . 
  especially when cohen ( i think ) has to do the sponsors live . 
  the reaction to his `` shipstation '' in the previous to last episode was hilarious . 
  i winced a bit when i saw the claws ready to extend . 
  you are correct of course . 
  i always mix names , i do n't know why i even bother . 
  it 's the dada curse all over again !, 
  it was the same with the leaked tax returns . 
  ~ ~ wapo ~ ~ the times was n't the only one who had them but they were the ones that tracked down his accountant at the time and confirmed the authenticity of what they had . 
  you are correct , of course . 
  mixed my sources . 
  it 's on chapter 15 of [ griffindors never die ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/gryffindors-never-die ) . 
  a rather good fic .
