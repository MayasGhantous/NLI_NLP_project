  it looks ancient . 
  well , he just wanted to spread the joy around . 
  good luck from greece !, 
  learn from our mistakes and do n't elect shitty populists that promise they know how to fix everything . 
  well , he is not [ lying ] ( https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/trump-melt-final.jpg ) . 
  and the supreme court . 
  definitely try cooking . 
  it 's extremely rewarding . 
  interesting . 
  `` peristeri '' is the greek word for `` dove '' . 
  it 's the first time i 've seen it latinized like this . 
  depends on how much the dems are willing to filibuster or fight for policies that a large number of voters see as unnecessary . 
  i would read the shit out of this book . 
  they were highly polished and sometimes gilded but i do n't think they would ever paint them . 
  sometimes differently coloured metal was used for certain body parts : silver for teeth and eyes , reddish coppers for lips and nipples etc. 
  pence might actually be worse . 
  trump is a loudmouth who changes his time depending on the moment . 
  pence is a hard core ideologue . 
  a [ caravaggio ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/caravaggio_-_la_deposizione_di_cristo.jpg ) in the flesh . 
  to frame will for a string of weird murders . 
  it makes sense in context, 
  if the previous nooks are an indication this one will be rooted in a matter of days . 
  the original software was indeed a lagfest . 
  i am using the marshmallow rom from the good over at xda and it runs extremely well . 
  the `` says who '' guy ? 
  there is a handy guide [ here ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/nook-hd/general/install-cyanogenmod-12-1-barnes-noble-t3211119 ) for lollipop and [ here ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/nook-hd/development/marshmallow-nook-hd-hd-t3239269 ) are the files for marshmallow and nougat . 
  i believe the marshmallow is the most stable builds for the time being . 
  i work in a museum . 
  the struggle is real . 
  it does n't look like a webcam . 
  there 's a strong shadow an the couch behind him that 's normally a telltale sign of a flash . 
  `` economically anxious '', 
  he should check with ivanka . 
  i love lapis artifacts . 
  also , / r/mineralporn, 
  relevant [ it crowd ] ( https://youtu.be/ojjd3vmgzne?t=66 ),

  i can almost hear the purring . 
  there is a ( partial ) backup in the [ bibliotheca alexandrina ] ( http://www.bibalex.org/en/project/details?documentid=283 ) in egypt . 
  it covers the years up to 2007 . 
  she had the amazing line `` i have n't been fucked like that since grade school '' . 
  everyone is the heir to a most ancient and noble house . 
  potter of course is also the peverell , gryffindoor and black houses . 
  also , every 12-year-old is suddenly speaking and acting like churchil . 
  because you need them to guide lord hadrian potter - peverell-slytherin through his inheritance test and to his family vaults , where he can read his parent 's will and see the myriad ways foomblydor screwed him over . 
  the only goblins i liked were the ones in the sum of their parts . 
  bloodthirsty and openly hostile , they bide their time until they can exploit their opponents weaknesses . 
  yep . 
  it became very fluffy , very fast . 
  also , despite the title , there is very little danger but lots of hugs and crying . 
  there is also a weird `` alpha-beta-submission '' thing going on that made me really uncomfortable at times . 
  * ye ' r a grower , harry !, 
  a good one, 
  * print screen intensifies *, 
  it 's even better with sound . 
  not sure about championships but this shit should be at the next olympics . 
  they look so fluffy !, 
   anthropocene, 
  i think he uses * anthropogenic * with the original greek meaning of man-made . 
  and a book of [ hitler speeches ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-donalds-big-book-hitler-speeches ) , apparently . 
   god does n't exist . 
  [ careful now !, 
   bring little damien to disney, 
  please tell me that 's his real name name !, 
  as if a smartphone had sex with a tesla car over duarte 's cold dead body . 
  the arches remind me a lot of the [ merida museum ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ntpuyzr.jpg ) by rafael moneo . 
  that sweater is the best . 
  it looks unreal . 
  and i kinda want to know how the meat tastes like . 
  that 's a large part of the plot of `` partially kissed hero , right ? 
  i think that his stories are ample evidence of a previous stroke . 
  clockwise , starting at the top :, 
  abraham wants to sacrifice isaac ( genesis 22:10 ), 
  god appears to noah ( genesis 6:14 ), 
  jacob 's ladder ( genesis 28:12 ), 
  moses and the burning bush ( exodus 3:2 ), 
  [ source ] ( http://www.artbible.info/art/large/379.html ), 
  there were boobies on die hard ? 
  i bet is the same intern that 's responsible for hangouts for the last three years . 
  `` what are you , the eagle or the goat ? '', 
  it 's the current trend in qarth . 
  i am using it with google 's text-to-speech and it 's amazing . 
  now we just need some experienced professionals to capture this magic on video . 
  i remember the first cyanogen rom i installed on my nook color . 
  it had some minor bugs but it was so much better than the stock software . 
  it started from gingerbread and now runs lollipop . 
  plus 2 years backpacking through europe . 
  what is a bbc ? 
  yes, 
  oh , good thing i did n't google that , then . 
  i love kahn 's buildings . 
  they look timeless . 
  for me it was the nose eating scene . 
  truly disturbing yet i could n't look away . 
  i 'd suggest artemisia gentileschi and her [ judith and holophernes . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/judith_slaying_holofernes_ ( artemisia_gentileschi ) ) . 
  she is not very well known or popular but she was one of the first women to gain recognition for painting and extremely talented . 
  what to you use remix for ? 
  i thought of getting one just for word , excel and some light internet use but at this point is a bit old .
