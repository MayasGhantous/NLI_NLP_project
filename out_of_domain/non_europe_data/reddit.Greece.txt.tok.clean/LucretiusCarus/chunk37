  that 's extremely impressive . 
  the point is that it was made in antiquity ( more than 2200 years ago ) and was one of the pinnacles of greek sculpture . 
  after it 's discovery it heavily influenced the sculpture of the time and it 's still admired for the daring conception and realization of the artist 's vision . 
  do n't forget that some of the city 's worst characters were his pupils . 
  [ alkiviades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcibiades ) and [ critias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critias ) did him no favors . 
  she really wingardium leviosaaaa-ed him right there, 
  cut it out hermione !, 
  he is the male equivalent of ann coulter . 
  of course `` it 's not the role of government to dictate to businesses what they should pay '' . 
  the real role of any republican government is to dictate if a woman can have an abortion or get birth control .

   because they hit me also when i do something wrong ... 
  has he ever admitted being wrong on anything ?

  at least jen knew she was shit and went to moss for help - it even worked for a while !, 
   here 's what it looks like on the inside cut in half,

  ( did i miss the joke ), 
  pornography ( in various formats ) has [ been ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3956/15363187929_1b7be9c068_o.jpg ) [ around ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3939/15363784947_1847c9c2d8_o.jpg ) [ since ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/634/21829496981_37cc258ea6_k.jpg ) the [ antiquity ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/69716881@n02/32460447650/sizes/k/ ) . 
  nowadays it 's just more accessible . 
  any day now , just wait !, 
  it 's ok , his son is going to handle `` the cyber '', 
  not just then cast , but the format as well . 
  i believe he would have been better in a show similar to bee 's full frontal . 
  he seems close to ivanka . 
  some people say a bit * too close *, 
  kudos for your patience , it 's not always easy with older folk that are well-meaning but set in their ways . 
  and i bet the apple pie was amazing . 
  nope , op has a chin . 
  also , no adidas tracksuit . 
  disgraceful !, 
  the well was dry by then . 
  the athenians were n't idiots to poison the city 's water . 
  unpresidented, 
  unsubscribed . 
  this spamboting shit has gotten really old . 
  maybe she 'll be the `` new female hitchens '' , now that poster-boy milo is on the shit list . 
  a new paradox is born : achilles and the donut . 
  yep , and the athenian agora was also largely build over with inferior structures , after athens diminished in size and its past glory was lost . 
  the sites of delphi , pella , knossos , bassae and olympia were also lost and rediscovered with the aid of foreign archaeological schools after the greek war of independence . 
  they used the same `` archaeological expedition '' concept during the french intervention in the greek war of independence . 
  the [ published monographs ] ( http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/blouet1831 ) are amazing in the quality of their surveys and measurements , especially since some sites and churches were damaged in the later years of the war . 
  why was it demolished ? 
  the photos look amazing !, 
  his * bloody sunday * also employs shaky cam to a great effect . 
  the movie leaves you with a pit in your stomach . 
  he [ referenced ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sweden-fox-news-2017-2 ) a terrorist attack that supposedly happened in sweden , based on a fox news story, 
  the dali atomicus was [ edited ] ( https://fstoppers.com/film/story-behind-1948-photograph-dali-atomicus-143353 ) though . 
  they removed the wires that suspended the chair , easel and the stool . 
  extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . 
  it 's up to trump to provide them . 
  a petulant child with a magnifying glass . 
  the 70 's were a different era ... 
   asoiaf is one of the very rare instances where the video version has actually transcended the books , in my opinion at least . 
  both are n't without their faults mind you , but the show does quite a few things a lot better than the books . 
  i will never forget or forgive the whole dorne travesty . 
  it was illogical , inconsistent and contributed nothing to the plot . 
  it also had some of the cringiest lines of the series so far . 
  the lower half is excellent , but the upper part is a bit spotty on the place the arches meet the base of the dome . 
  looks half-finished . 
  a very interesting theme !, 
  one case i can instantly recall is the vienna university paintings that klimt was contracted to create . 
  his vision was not really in sync with the current academic trends and his paintings were rejected . 
  in the end , klimt rejected the commission and fought a battle in the courts to keep the three paintings . 
  in a further twist , the paintings were confiscated by the nazis and destroyed when they set fire to a castle as they retreated . 
  only black and white photos remain of on of the most unusual paintings , [ jurisprudence ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/jurisprudence-final-state-1907.jpg ) . 
  the subject here seems to be less about the law and more about the revenge that the three erinyes inflict upon the man that 's consumed by the monster while justice looks uninterested from the top of the painting . 
  i have seen worse performances . 
  it rarely goes well , does it ? 
  although i have to admit it usually results in some highly amusing videos . 
  it is a sad story , especially since the painting were removed to the castle for their protection . 
  the only hints we have of their original coloring is an [ oil sketch ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ftigmkn.jpg ) that led to a partial reconstruction of the figure of [ hygeia ] ( https://i.imgur.com/a9ocv95.jpg ) . 
  it 's interesting that the model seems to be adele bloch-bauer , his longtime friend and possibly lover . 
  her well known [ portrait ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portrait_of_adele_bloch-bauer_i ) was luckier in surviving the war , although it was seized by the nazis . 
  it was not restored to its rightful owners until 2006 , after a protracted legal battle . 
  adele had her portrait done twice by him and was also depicted by him as [ judith ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judith_and_the_head_of_holofernes ) , another depiction of rightful vengeance . 
  my pleasure . 
  looted artifacts is a particular interest of mine - the nazi plunders are a major part of it . 
  unrelated to the theme of justice or law but presenting a cautionary tale to the museums and the market of antiquities is the story of the [ getty kouros ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/statue_of_a_kouros_%28c._530_bce_or_modern%2c_getty_villa_collection%29.jpg ) , an over-lifesize statue acquired by the museum in the 80 's for 8 million $ . 
  the provenance presented turned out fake , the statue was not published or even photographed before , even though it was supposedly discovered in the thirties and , most damning , it combined artistic traits of various schools and eras of greek archaic sculpture. , something that everyone with two eyes and a passing knowledge of the subject noticed at once . 
  but , supporting its authenticity was the patina on the surface of the marble , something that at the time was not thought possible to be imitated artificially ... [ until it was ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/arts/art-absolutely-real-absolutely-fake.html?pagewanted=all ) . 
  also , a partial kouros , with modern tool marks and large similarities to the one in getty was also surfaced in the market in geneva . 
  right now pretty much everyone knows that the marble is fake , even the [ museum labeled it ] ( http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/10930/unknown-maker-kouros-greek-about-530-bc-or-modern-forgery/ ) `` circa 530 b.c or modern forgery '' , before removing it from the galleries . 
  the museum gambled in the acquisition of a unique piece of art based solely on scientific rather than artistic criteria , accepting the forged papers without due diligence in order to avoid returning it to greece , the most probable point of origin and outdo the other major museums of the world . 
  it lost , badly . 
  * extreme vetting !!, 
  the mariners revenge and especially the infanta are among my all time favourites . 
  but i rarely hear anything else from them . 
  i think that * i just shot john lennon * and * salvation * are equally good . 
  but the video clip for zombie is a masterpiece . 
  i would cuddle that cat for hours . 
  the word comes from the greek * \u0393\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 * , and defines someone that excercises in the nude , as it was the default in ancient greek cities . 
  so , every use of the word gymnastics is wrong from an etymological perspective . 
  it 's from an exhibition done for fun ( or to show off new moves ) after the real competition was finished . 
  oh , i am terribly sorry u/creepyphotographer !, 
  * \u0395\u03c3\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 * was mainly used to mean a grid of metal bars . 
  it 's other meaning was a lot rarer .
