  not just `` somewhat inbred '' . 
  shamelessly copying wikipedia :, 
   like many habsburgs , philip iii was the product of extensive inbreeding . 
  his father , philip ii , a product of marriage between first cousins , married his niece , anna of austria , herself the product of a cousin couple . 
  philip iii in turn married his first cousin once removed , margaret of austria . 
  now , imagine that , but with dinosaurs of the same size . 
  geese are not to be fucked with . 
  i was expecting a tiny dickbutt at the end . 
  i did , and it 's magnificent !, 
  from what i remember from high school , we use the same symbols as you ( but \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 for angles ) , with the addition of \u03b5 , \u03ad for lines and their parallels . 
  i do n't think i ever had a problem that required more symbols than the ones we have available . 
  despite all the efforts of my maths teacher and the strong disapproval of the ministry of education . 
  while i liked geometry to some degree ( heh ) i drew the line ( heh heh ) to anything more advanced than third degree equations . 
  maybe he was economically anxious . 
  not just as a fortress but also as a gunpowder store . 
  morosini and his cannons demolished almost 1/3 of the building and wrecked the marble decorations he tried to remove . 
  my father is the same . 
  the night before his cancer operation he called me to tell me about his money hiding places . 
  after the fourth spot i had to pause and grab a pen and paper . 
  thankfully he made it through and i never had to go up to the roof or down the basement and search for boxes full of money . 
  beautiful coin . 
  what is the reason of the discoloration around the head ? 
  thank you for your reply . 
  i had no idea that the effect was desirable . 
  i recently photographed [ some ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xlsm6x4.jpg ) [ coins ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0mlqmrb.jpg ) for an exhibition catalogue and the conservators had removed every trace of the grayish natural patina i had seen before . 
  `` burn the witch ! '', 
  they hated hillary and obama and wanted lower taxes . 
  the republicans did what the democrats refused and voted for their `` lesser of two evils '' . 
  even the party establishment folded one by one like origami assholes . 
  my parents , generally well-meaning and adjuster people , tried to tell my sister that `` sex is only permissible after the wedding '' she calmly countered the she was born five and a half months after my parents married . 
  people are usually blind to their own hypocrisy, 
  yeah , i get that , the are the product of a different age and mindset , but from what my sisters told me they never got `` the talk '' from my mother , nothing about contraception , just `` the naughty place is only after the wedding '' kind of bullshit - as if this was ever enough to stop teenagers from bonking . 
  my father is cut from the same cloth , i did n't get the talk either . 
  my best friend and i were give the talk by his father when i was at his place to play nes . 
  fun times . 
  it was super bomberman and yes , it was as awkward as you described . 
  it 's afternoon in russia ... 
  strikingly similar the the [ parisienne ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/the_parisian%2c_fresco%2c_knossos%2c_greece.jpg/1048px-the_parisian%2c_fresco%2c_knossos%2c_greece.jpg ) , from knossos , but a century younger . 
  requiem was finished by another composer and the parts by mozart really stand out . 
  the one in the center is contemplating murder, 
  it looks like a blown-up figurine rather than a large scale sculpture . 
  it 's also in remarkably good condition for an underwater terracotta . 
  i have the same model and it 's shitty . 
  the pins are very loose and there is a noticeable bend to them . 
  but i got what i paid for ... 
  - let me ring a komrade real quick, 
  - * hey steve , what time is it in moscow right now ? 
  you already have the joker in charge , ca n't you just make up your mind ? 
  at first they stayed in place fairly well but after two months it has gotten a bit loose in the ends . 
  there is no other locking mechanism . 
  * who knew ? 
  but was he a strong no , or a maybe ? 
  [ or maybe a potential maybe that became a no ] ( https://youtu.be/0upitqt9m9g?t=441 ) ? 
  they control both the house and the senate , they should be able to pass it on their own . 
  what a shameless liar . 
  i do n't think its pins are long enough to trace the more curvier shapes i am dealing with . 
  the [ grave stele ] ( http://www.minervaclassics.com/thebes_warrior_01.jpg ) of mnason , a warrior that died in thessaly 2500 years ago , survived and is still on display in the local museum . 
  his music was ahead of its time but the war really sucked . 
  these people are convinced that there is a secret agreement between millions of climate scientists , all working together to convince people that the climate is changing for some nebulous and nefarious reasons . 
  but they ca n't even imagine that oil companies might be doing anything wrong . 
  yep , especially the camera . 
  it was hard to get decent shots even with good light . 
  i 'd love to read something like `` fifty shades '' narrated to the style of procopius . 
  looks like an old style kitchen hood . 
  fuck , i am old . 
  when i was 9 i was afraid of fridges because of the flying teeth leeches that were released from one - i think it was a scene in the junkyard . 
  nightmares were had . 
  35 , and grey just started appearing in my hair . 
  i had the same reaction when i saw [ one ] ( http://www.enma.gr/ht/images/f_floor211.jpg ) in the numismatic museum of athens . 
  unfortunately , photography was not allowed for the specific display so i only have the official museum photo . 
  yep , let 's leave the suspected gang member be the head judge on his gangs trial . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  hey , show some respect for judge jeanine !, 
  the heartstag displayed at the capella palatina in the third season . 
  not so much for the display itself as for the subsequent `` unfolding '' . 
  because it has my contact details without my permission . 
  sure , you can opt out , but when another one of your contacts installs it you have to do it again . 
  they can go fuck right off . 
  shhhhh , do n't let anish kapoor hear that or he will demand royalties . 
  i am an idiot and just thought they were framed posters over the bed . 
  if i were in their shoes my resentment and bitterness would have the power to open a black hole and destroy the solar system . 
  same here . 
  it 's one of my counterarguments to a friend who claims that half of the wall is filler . 
  you just replace billions by thousands and ascribe everything to * god 's mysterious ways *, 
  imagine having to explain that to your significant other . 
  `` i swear honey , i did n't cheat , it was the koala ! '', 
  interesting details on the lannister sigils on the windows of the throne room . 
  they were seven pointed stars beforehand . 
  it seems cercei has supplanted the religion . 
  there were some in the early middle ages . 
  the local aristocracy and clergy did n't like it . 
  it did n't end well . 
  and if it was , it was n't for long . 
  * pieta with sequins *, 
  at this point , i am thinking that a simple back rectangle would have looked better . 
  how is the battery on your phone . 
  and do you use the e-ink screen ? 
  [ yep ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7f/07/ab/7f07ab7b0ea3676fa6d7e5a9dcb154d1.jpg ) . 
  she was also great in her interactions with will . 
  i was usually watching it the next day during dinner so i had the whole fancy meal going on : asparagus with bacon , juicy steaks , saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and the likes .
