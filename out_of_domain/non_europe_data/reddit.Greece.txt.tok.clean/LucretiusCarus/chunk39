  i swear it tasted better . 
  impressive !, 
  thanks for the details . 
  attaboy, 
  and what is wrong with his eyes ? 
  we did , they were all over the net . 
  also , this photo is not from the site of the attack but from the graveyard . 
  notice the fresh tombs in the background ? 
  the father is sitting on his children 's grave . 
  i am using a 7010 right now . 
  not bad for basic office stuff , but damn , it gets slow sometimes . 
   a ) on this subreddit ?

  are these enough ? 
  i am sure more photos from russia will surface soon . 
   b ) do n't see what the rest of your comment has to do with . 
  alright , sure , it 's still propaganda . 
  you mentioned that ypu did n't see photos from the attack on england or russia and ai pointed out that it was not a photo from the attack but rather the aftermath . 
  see the relevance now ? 
  dude , you stated that there were no photos of these attacks here on / r/pics . 
  i gave you evidence that they exist and now you want them in the thousands ? 
  are you going to move the goalposts any farther ? 
  same here . 
  one the one hand it 's nice that greece does n't have the most fucked up government anymore . 
  one the other , usa , and by extension trump , has the capacity to fuck up the entire planet . 
  as if the age of consent bothered these people before ... 
  my watch . 
  it belonged to my grandfather and my dad passed it to me on my 18th birthday . 
  it 's the only thing i have from my grandfather and i am terrified of damaging it, 
  nah , i bet the blood was super easy to clean out of the armrest . 
  i bet united wo n't even send him a cleaning bill . 
  that last view of the merging conveyor belts looked like something out of a sci-fi movie . 
  an oddly tasty sci-fi movie . 
  why , is melania uncooperative ? 
  i am sure we do n't need him to get any ideas . 
  '' * hmmmm , tell me more about the ovens , what is the optimal temperature ? 
  nobody knew wars in the middle east were going to be so complicated , right ? 
  the date comes from comparable artifacts that come from dated contexts . 
  as for the survival , it definitely comes from a grave , possibly looted somewhere on greece . 
  but not before a good bloody * holmgang . 
  the alternative explanation claims that it refers to the balustrade in the harbour , where the hookers waited for the sailors to disembark . 
  it 's weird , especially since alexander is all over greece . 
  britta almost britta'ed it right at the end . 
  it better be . 
  i love that album !, 
  the proportions are really weird . 
  the woman 's head is tilted so awkwardly that it appears that it has the same length as the man 's fingers . 
  yes, 
  same with greece . 
  also , our last lifeline . 
  the linked video had 44k likes . 
  let that sink in . 
  reminds me of the trump voter that was flabbergasted when ice deported her ( illigal ) immigrant husband . 
  * `` but he said he would kick out the bad ones !, 
  you might be interested in * the borgias * . 
  jeremy irons as pope alessandro was a delight . 
  pity that showtime cancelled it after the third season . 
  whatever it is , i am sure the germans have an unpronounceable word to describe it !, 
  cersei with a glass of wine , i love that they got her trademark attribute . 
  * strong christian values , a pillar of the community * , etc. 
  i doubt i will ever be as happy as this dog was at that moment . 
  but it 's the transgender people using bathrooms that 's the real threat to the society . 
  * think of the children !, 
  morality * at fox * . 
  talk about oxymorons . 
   vaginal attachment style : removable ( stock insert ), 
  i wonder why ... 
  so , why is the dark side of the moon really bland , compared to the one facing earth ? 
  it 's the `` you forced me to be a nazi by calling out my bullshit '' method . 
  or * a serbian film * . 
  a friend of mine thought he going to see a doc about the war . 
  thankfully he did n't bring his girlfriend along . 
  the books are decent . 
  not high literature but i enjoyed almost all of them . 
  the first two books are certainty the best of the bunch . 
  no french allowed !, 
  * ^ unless ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ praise ^ ^ ^ ^ lepen . 
  i think she 's only heavy handed only when it comes to for-profit publications . 
  she does n't seem to care for the tonnes of fanfics that 's on the net . 
  the non laminated screen and the shitty trackpad are deal breakers . 
  also , chuwi is not the most reliable chinese company out there . 
  we do have the best bots , do n't we ? 
  if trump wants your opinion he will give it to you . 
  for 400k i could make a pretty good case for satanism and/or cannibalism . 
  anyone would, 
  after watching clips and reading the similar stories here , i am having a newfound appreciation for my regular , boring , conservative parents .

  begins his point ; something about the nuclear, 
   look , having nuclear, 
  immediately gets distracted by talking about his uncle , who is relevant ... for * reasons * . 
  also i think trying to imply that their shared genetics means trump himself is also very good , very smart . 
   my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer , dr. john trump at mit ; good genes , very good genes , ok , very smart , the wharton school of finance , very good , very smart, 
  goes on a digression within a digression about how republicans are automatically seen as stupid , and democrats as smart .
