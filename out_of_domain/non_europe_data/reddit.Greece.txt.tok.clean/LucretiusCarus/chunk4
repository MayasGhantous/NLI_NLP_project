  it 's insane , given that the facilities and the doctors are mostly above average that a 20 % of the population does n't have access to healthcare . 
  his previous submission states that it is almost 6 months of progress .

  i have a very similar body type and i 'd love his results .

  in ancient greece men knew how to swim and did so for pleasure or work . 
  menander reportedly died by drowning in the piraeus ' harbor . 
  also , etruscans seem to have enjoyed diving , as shown in a relevant tomb [ fresco ] ( http://seecmadrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/paestum-nadador.jpg ), 
  grilled pork steak . 
  i bought recently a george foreman grill and i love the flavor and the texture of a thick steak , with just a little lemon , paprika and fresh oregano and thyme . 
  yes we can !, 
  [ i 've lost 12 pounds in ten days .

  modigliani 's prices shot through the roof after his death . 
  relevant username ? 
  beef stakes are not really popular in greece , so i ca n't really understand the appeal , but could n't you broil it in the oven ? 
  his lawyer came out today on a greek tv station , proudly and irately stating that the prison guards were cowards and that `` you do n't shoot a man on his road to freedom '' . 
  the page you link has all the required information .

  very good !, 
  i really like the strong lines . 
  the neck seems a little too long though . 
  yes , and lots of it !,

  for your second question : it 's really difficult for a non-greek to work in a greek excavation . 
  the money usually comes from the state and there are many formal requirements to even apply for a position . 
  most foreign archaeologists are either graduates from greek uni 's or work for a foreign archaeological institute . 
  as for # 3 , my biggest problem is heat , and to a lesser extent the dust . 
  most excavation in crete take place usually in the summer with the temperatures sometimes exceeding 40 degrees c. 
  pretty much , yes . 
  the pine resin added to the wines of thasos probably created a white wine similar to the modern retsina, 
  great !,

  minoans , then ? 
  by 1600 b.c. 
  their leaders had four-story buildings , with internal plumbing and waste disposal systems . 
  correct !, 
  they used hot wax and resin combined with mineral or organic colors and applied it with brushes or spatulas . 
  sure , but the pyramids are relatively simple structures . 
  that 's great !, 
  i love it when technology really helps people . 
  the root of both words is common . 
  both are derived from narcissus , the man that was so enamored with his own reflection on the surface of a lake that he starved himself . 
  apollo then turned him into the flower . 
  she did n't abort a child , she aborted a mass of cells .

  every sperm is sacred ... 
  sometimes condoms break and even the pill might not work . 
  chill, 
  each sperm contains the genetic information of the person that produced it . 
  it would n't matter . 
  i prefer abortions to the army of teen moms that are clearly unprepared to care for a human life . 
  so , is this about the money ? 
  and what if he wants it and she does n't ? 
  why should his opinion on the matter be considered when it 's her body that will take the strain of a pregnancy . 
  i 'm pretty sure that most unwilling fathers would gladly pay for a quick abortion than a lifetime of child support . 
  i have great affection for [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xowltko9lfg/r8ckcpb_dfi/aaaaaaaaacu/7bmhoa-b6ay/s1600-h/100_5436.jpg ) little guy , on of my first ever finds . 
  it 's a part of a byzantine glazed ceramic bowl , dated around the 13th century a.d. 
  the sad part ; it 's really not . 
  they were pretty common at the time . 
  my really remarkable find is a late neolithic [ ~ 4500-4000 bc ] bone figurine of a bird ( owl , eagle or a hawk ) , with decorative incisions and eyes of an intense blue color , probably lapis lazuli . 
  still unpublished , so please do n't circulate it . 
  they were a common middle class item . 
  the were certainly abundant at my dig . 
  the preservation though is very good . 
  we later found more parts of the same bowl . 
  serres , greece , at a small village in central macedonia . 
  really ? 
  where was this ? 
  it 's a byzantine ceramic glazed bowl from the serres workshop . 
  it belongs to the late phase of the glazed byzantine ware as shown by the use of both paint and incision . 
  a weird mix of symbolism and surrealism , done with a realistic technique . 
  take a look at my little [ office-nest ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w2c8lzz.jpg ), 
  so , say 2016 to be sure ? 
  you do n't want to go there , believe me , it 's a shitty place . 
  sugar !, 
  i was at my sister 's making coffee . 
  pre-keto i took it with less than a half-teaspoon and i absent-mindlessly reached for the sugar . 
  it was only for a moment though . 
  yep !,
