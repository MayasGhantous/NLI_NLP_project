  which is why he has to beat the drum about his credentials to get anyone to believe him when he says he has the best words . 
   you know , if you 're a conservative republican , if i were a liberal , if , like , ok , if i ran as a liberal democrat , they would say i 'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world -- it 's true ! -- but when you 're a conservative republican they try -- oh , do they do a number -- that 's why i always start off : went to wharton , was a good student , went there , went there , did this , built a fortune -- you know i have to give my like credentials all the time , because we 're a little disadvantaged, 
  returns back to the point he started on ; something about the nuclear deal . 
  except he wanders off topic again very quickly . 
  i think he wanted to say `` it would have been so easy to < get a better deal , more concessions , or something  '' but skips tracks in his brain to talking about `` these lives '', 
   but you look at the nuclear deal , the thing that really bothers me -- it would have been so easy , and it 's not as important as these lives are, 
  throws in another aside which at least reveals why he ever mentioned his uncle ; apparently the uncle once said something about the nuclear . 
   ( nuclear is powerful ; my uncle explained that to me many , many years ago , the power and that was 35 years ago ; he would explain the power of what 's going to happen and he was right -- who would have thought ? 
  back sort of on topic , presumably the `` these lives '' earlier was referring to the prisoner release that happened alongside the nuclear deal , which he wants to call out as more important than the nuclear deal itself because it has more direct impact on the lives of those specific people rather than high-level political wrangling over nuclear material . 
   but when you look at what 's going on with the four prisoners -- now it used to be three , now it 's four -- but when it was three and even now , i would have said it 's all in the messenger ; fellas, 
  gets distracted yet again ; just happens to have used the word `` fellas '' while he was trying to insinuate something about the quality of the negotiators , and that led him back off-topic and deciding to throw in a little jab at the iranians for their treatment of women, 
   and it is fellas because , you know , they do n't , they have n't figured that the women are smarter right now than the men , so , you know , it 's gon na take them about another 150 years, 
  and we 're back to his * actual * point , that those wily iranian negotiators are just too good , which is why the nuclear deal was `` bad '' , in ways that are left unspecified . 
   but the persians are great negotiators , the iranians are great negotiators , so , and they , they just killed , they just killed us . 
  tl ; dr : looks like he set out trying to say `` we no good at make nuclear deal , i make good deals '' as he so often has , but repeatedly fell off topic to talk about his uncle , prisoner exchange , iranian gender ( in ) equality , and how people assume republicans are n't intellectual heavyweights ( because i mean , what on earth could have ever led to * that * impression ? ), 
  for maximum t_d triggering , neville should have hillary 's face . 
  they would be so torn between hate and glee, 
  that was quality drama . 
  i love the fact that you can pinpoint the date with accuracy , like an archaeologist using coins or inscriptions . 
  you know , we will need a photo of the dog , you ca n't just tease like this !, 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5308q3/_/d7ounqu ) a link to an old thread . 
  in short , the guy promised a giveaway , did n't deliver even after repeated contact and bitched and moaned on twitter about ungrateful people and mocked a lot of his followers that criticized him . 
  at the left/right : '' \u039f \u0393\u0395\u03a9\u03a1 / \u0393\u0399\u039f\u03a3 '' ( the name of the saint george in greek ) . 
  ( i implore you to be a fervent guardian in battles ) . 
  my byzantine archaeology is a bit rusty , but these pendants usually had space in the interior for a holy relic ( bone , blood , oil , myrrh ) . 
  granted , this is an object probably worn by nobility but it follows the same concept . 
  it 's real . 
  the cloisonne technique uses thin gold wire on the flat disk to create borders that are filled with colored enamel . 
  another example is [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:medallion_st_demetrios_louvre_oa6457.jpg ), 
  you are a lifesaver , thanks !, 
  i still remember the delightful [ story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anarcho_capitalism/comments/3ucp8y/i_was_beat_up_by_left_anarchists_in_greece/ ) of the ancap that tried to preach to the hardcore anarchists of athens , greece . 
   they pulled me out the door , it was up three floors , and basically drug me down the stairs on my back . 
  it hurt really bad and ** i remember yelling `` you 're breaking the nap '' and things like that . 
  `` stop initiating force against me ** . '', 
  if it 's made out of ivory then the it was by default a very expensive toy . 
  most of the ancient greek and roman dolls were made out of wood or terracotta , like [ this one ] ( https://greektoys.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/plaggona.jpg ) . 
   at the end of that war there was a massive population exchange in which all of the `` turks '' were evicted from greece and sent to turkey and all of the `` greeks '' were evicted from turkey and sent to greece . 
  it 's also interesting to note that the deciding factor for the exchange was not the national identity but the religion . 
  there was a large number of native turkish-speaking orthodox citizens and greek-speaking muslim citizens that found themselves moved to a country where they had no other connection besides religion . 
  * [ twice a stranger : how mass expulsion forged modern greece and turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twice_a_stranger:_how_mass_expulsion_forged_modern_greece_and_turkey ) * is a great read in the matter of the exchange . 
  c u l t u r a l, 
  ( am i doing this correctly ? ), 
  i would also keep my distance , imagine the levels of damage they would they inflict if they are that dangerous to themselves . 
  he will fold again , like the other times his integrity was on the line . 
  one of my favorites !, 
  also , kevin mckidd in his first tv appearance !, 
  to be fair , joe usually cut in after the first 15 seconds of her argument with a long tangent about his days in congress . 
  we are on reddit , it 's a given . 
  you are probably correct . 
  my reading was influenced by modern greek . 
  ca n't you use a free vpn service to access wikipedia ? 
  i have a friend in istanbul that swears on tunnelbear . 
  it 's only 500mb of data per month but it 's enough for text heavy sites . 
  just the name already puts it above allo , duo and android messages . 
  i do n't even need fallback sms , just give me something stable that combines the best stuff from hangouts and the rest . 
   have you even asked yourself why ? 
  being able to climb two floors or walk for a mile without stoping to catch my breath is a good start . 
  i was fat in the past and after losing 30 kilos i ca n't even understand how i could stand living like that . 
  a tiny , hobbit-sized one . 
  [ better ? 
  that 's an obvious connection , so it must a false flag planted by the obama deep state \u2122, 
  unexpected lotr ? 
   are still sexy with a belly, 
  no we are not . 
  source : my belly, 
  you know , it took some dedication but it 's damn satisfying to be able to buckle the jeans in their intended place and not the dreaded over/under the belly . 
  also , somehow the junk looks bigger . 
  his * curry * brings all the girls in the yard,

  the whitest group to ever white . 
  the guy demanded a loyalty oath from the director of the fbi ... for him you are either with him or against him . 
  i would stay away from vernee . 
  they still have n't fix a lot of bugs ( or delivered the updates they promised ) for their older devices, 
  that 's kushner 's job . 
  solving the middle east and fetching dessert . 
  maybe , just maybe , these people should watch/listen/read some reputable news sources instead of relying on a comedian that delivers 30 minutes of content once a week . 
  saying that uncensorednews has a slight bias is like saying that the_d is a tad eccentric . 
  unless someone more reputable comes up with something substantial , i 'd disregard it . 
  donald trump = marina abramovic confirmed !, 
  the g series covers the lower/mid range spectrum and the z series the upper/flagship levels . 
  this model seems to slot somewhere in between . 
  possibly better than a g5 + , not as good as a z play , and the price should reflect that . 
  if karma/god exists then it should be cancer . 
  it 's all fun and games until you find a mouses entrails in your favorite shoe . 
  like a present from a fluffy demented godfather . 
  `` this is why trump won '', 
  and i think they really believe it . 
  remember when trump spoke to congress and every talking head had orgasms about his `` presidential look '' ? 
  i wonder what the would say now . 
  somethingsomething seth rich somethinsomething dnc, 
  somethinsomething benghazi, 
  somethinsomething emails, 
  somethinsomething pizzagate, 
  i bet the shoe salesmen were giving them the stinkeye . 
  awwww, 
  maybe they 'll deploy some emergency shrubbery to hide behind . 
  the even sadder truth is that his nutjob followers will try to spin this as a winning negotiation tactic or mainstream media lies . 
  or both . 
  ... and it was not the mouth . 
  . . and that 's how marcel died .
