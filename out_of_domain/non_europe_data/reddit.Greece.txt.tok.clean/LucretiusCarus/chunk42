  belief is power , even belief you 're not consciously aware of . 
  that 's exactly the point that media made in her amazing scene with tech boy :, 
  * '' ... people believed ... and now there are starmen waiting in the sky '' *, 
   if one of those statements is true , the other must be false - they contradict each other in a lame attempt to cover all bases . 
   it 's a common trait of narcissists . 
  ah , the `` i did n't do it and if i did it was your fault '' defense . 
  they were n't exactly hiding it . 
   george rr martin is also pretty much non-existent outside of writing for the world of westeros . 
  but it is very very large and i have not noticed a dip in his quality , only his speed . 
  i think the last two books were bad ( crows worse than dragons ) . 
  not by a very large amount , but in sharp contrast with the first two books . 
  yeah , the guy needs an editor . 
  he passed the point where a reader can follow the action long ago . 
  i should n't have to read any book while talking notes or with the wiki open in order to remember the hundreds of characters and houses . 
  some people have too much time . 
  this is amazing . 
  but how is the circle in the center connected to the rest ? 
  get in touch with [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/6gklhv/2000_piece_pure_white_puzzle/dirbwao/ ) guy to really create a tiny personal hell . 
  to be fair , we were wondering that a few years ago when the most watched network was attacking the then president for wearing a tan suit , ordering dijon mustard , installing `` islamic prayer curtains '' in the white house and having `` terrorist fistbumps '' with the first lady . 
  america is weird . 
  nice , there is a lot of planning in this , the inside-out edges is also a nice touch . 
  i would probably nope in the first two hours . 
  and just now i noticed that he 's giving you the finger . 
  your dad is amazing !, 
  i love the fact that the show explores and expands the characters and their backstory . 
  i think it 's a rare thing to have a successful book-to-screen transfer but fuller has managed perfectly . 
  especially as this week 's `` coming to america segment '' was both faithful to the book and integral to plot . 
  it 's not like he actually sabotaged her , she just lost his protection when she took her new life for granted . 
  yeah , it 's not like the hobbit , where a relatively thin volume became a three-hour-movie behemoth with a bonus interspecies love triangle, 
  i think it has parallels to the aeolian capital but with a different evolution . 
  no , be fair , you can also claim to be lester holt and he will incriminate himself . 
  7 out of 13 and that wine bottle thingy does not belong anywhere near an asshole . 
  it was done to pope formosus during the aptly named [ cadaver synod ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cadaver_synod ) . 
  early christian church is fascinatingly weird . 
  realistically , it probably tastes like trumps bunghole . 
  as if trump ever read plutarch , or even knows who he is . 
  `` plutarch ? 
  no that 's wrong , it 's pluto and it is a planet and a dog , believe me ! '', 
  obama had class . 
  that 's something money ca n't buy . 
   the plan is to split calculator into home and business edition, 
  that 's patently false . 
  it will be four editions , one for each basic operation ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ) . 
  the more advanced stuff will be exclusive to pixel 2 . 
  snarky stuff aside , i really like its evolution . 
  i do n't feel the need for other calc apps anymore . 
  hannibal wore floral suits and ties and somehow made out look cool af . 
  of course the whole cast had amazing outfits , especially alana and bedelia . 
  i had to disagree ( and for the record i did n't downvote you ) . 
  i think her reversal , after being broken by hannibal , and her detached and cold presence was completely natural . 
  and she made a perfect couple with margot . 
  that 's why they get `` bone spurs '' !, 
  a tiny discount hitler . 
  there is an interesting article in [fivethirtyeight.com ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-making-europe-liberal-again/ ) fivethirtyeight.com that shows that support to donald trump led to right wing parties failing in europe , to the point that opposition to trump seems like a credible strategy for liberal or left wing parties . 
  i will never go there , but damn these titles are amazingly bizarre . 
  not sure about that . 
  my personal favourites , in no particular order , are : adolf twitler , benedict donald , cheeto benito , fuckface von clownstick , short-fingered vulgarian , and trumplethinskin . 
  but what is the endgame ? 
  if they were to meet i 'm pretty sure she might notice that !, 
  and , just to be sure , lawyer up . 
  i am not sure any ambitious attorney will be willing to be known as another robert bork . 
  as long as it does not copy the personality of the writer . 
  otherwise it will start churning out wildcards nonsense and touring for conventions . 
  i was already noping at the first `` small '' one . 
  fifty shades of prey, 
  she could have said that she and her friends stole apples from the neighbour 's orchard and it would have been relatable and endearing . 
  instead , she went full jesus . 
  united by their love of cargo shorts !, 
  a first saw her in [ anatomie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187696/ ) but i fell in love with lola run . 
  she is great . 
  that 's delusional . 
  i love how d has the body of captain america , the eagle wrench is also a nice touch . 
  and the tie is too short . 
   trump may very well be america 's caesar, 
  that 's insulting to caesar . 
  the dude was a military hero , brilliant strategist , orator and writer . 
  sure , he caused the downfall of the republic but at least he and his successor were accomplished . 
  it took me a couple of seconds to realise that the `` footsie '' that fell by 200 points was the ftse . 
  shadow 's stare combined with wednesday 's grin were perfection . 
  i am sure / r/malefashionadvice is ready to burn me in effigy . 
  i repent and humbly ask for forgiveness ... 
  and most of all , republican !, 
  usually they do n't use glass surfaces to avoid ugly reflections . 
  also , some museums have literally too much valuable art . 
  i mean look at [ this room ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get2/i0000qdawt3bjbnq/fit=1000x750/caravaggio-bacon-18-of-40.jpg ) in the villa borghese . 
  the three caravaggios and the bacon probably worth close to a billion dollars and they are not even protected by a rope . 
  that 's * silence of the lambs * with a slightly different cast . 
  not true , i look equally ugly in every camera . 
  my only hope is that oil painting is going to have a comeback . 
  that 's adorable . 
  i can imagine the reaction to the `` would you like to fuck me ? '', 
  scene - if she made it that far . 
  just to be a part of history, 
  it 's not so much about you ( solid red or solid blue ) but purple voters and districts that could be swayed by a carefully crafted message . 
  slow down hannibal !, 
  nope . 
  colorizebot, 
  agree , not bad at all . 
  merci , brussels !, 
  has there ever been a better ending of a series ?
