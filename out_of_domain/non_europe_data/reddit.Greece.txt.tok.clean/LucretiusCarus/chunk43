  i think hannibal comes close , but this is just perfect . 
  no , the french were salty . 
  maybe it could be heard by the [ dog supreme court ] ( https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/20/7014955/john-oliver-dog-supreme-court-last-week-tonight-free-public ) . 
  colorizebot, 
  my cat tilts her head in exactly the same way when i scratch under her chin . 
  i 'd expect that from gorsuch or alito . 
  ginsbourg would never !, 
  i think he made it himself as part of his tailor training . 
  and / r/sadcringe . 
  at this point you are going to end out of border , assuming this debacle goes on for the full term . 
  you made me look twice . 
  nicely played . 
  it 's excellent !, 
  you 'd better tweet it to bryan fuller for more exposure . 
  lots of people only consider glass or metal as premium materials , but the soft plastic of the 2013 moto x was fantastic . 
  the wood options were also great . 
  that family tree definitely looked less than a line and more like a circle . 
  and yet , the swastika on superman 's chest is weirdly off-centre . 
  the squirrel , obviously . 
  there 's a criminal lack of photos of huge guys with tiny do ~ ~ n ~ ~ gs in small leather studded carriers . 
  edit : unfortunate typo . 
  the difference is that photorealism was not a goal in the renaissance . 
  they painted having varying ideas of what the painting should look like . 
  exact imitation of nature was not a goal but some painters got very close to realism anyway ( caravaggio 's [ fruit basket ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8x9yphc.jpg ) is a famous example ) . 
  my sister recently put [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bnkhdmy.jpg ) in her wall . 
  it 's not even her own cat . 
  hidden depths, 
  the smile when he realises what is going on . 
  it 's surprisingly accurate , given that the source text misses the accents that differentiate a lot of homophonous words . 
  oh , this is amazing , and weird . 
  i just tried on the translate app . 
  it correctly translates \u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9 ( with or without the accent ) as `` pelt '' , bit it 's reverting to * tomato * if you add any kind of context . 
  subtle, 
  menage a tr\u0153uf !, 
  he calls him '' \u03c8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 '' , in the greek army slang it means `` small fish '' but the algorithm probably considers it a typo . 
  that was the central theme of * fatherland * . 
  extremely unsettling book . 
  is this the story behind [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tlr7u67.jpg ) photo ? 
  where is a microwave when you need it ? 
  obama disappoints again !, 
  more like he said , then denied it , then denying ever saying anything , then accusing someone else of saying it and finally admitting it on twitter/tv . 
  i hate that not only i know what it means but that it also the opposite of * yandere * and that the difference can be shown by the shape of the eyes . 
  tvtropes has destroyed me ... 
  cm 7 on the nook color . 
  completely transformed the device . 
  without the clunky skin it was actually a solid device , still use it in my kitchen . 
  the developers also managed to enable the bluetooth chip and overclock the processor . 
  updated to every android version and the madmen even managed to run nougat on it !, 
  i love the fact that it 's a different kitten every time . 
  praising jesus , quoting reagan and hitting on someone . 
  the fox news trifecta . 
  yeah , we are on a list now . 
  400 years of evolution from [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/ac.kleobisandbiton.jpg/220px-ac.kleobisandbiton.jpg ) point . 
  what do you have in mind as the 2d work ? 
  because we only have tiny percentage of the paintings that were admired and even these are usually roman copies . 
  the [ rape of persephone ] ( http://ancient-greece.org/images/ancient-sites/vergina/large/17.jpg ) in vergina is a great surviving example . 
  this guy kegels, 
  the vase paintings were greatly constrained by the medium and the necessity of large production . 
  and even though they were traded extensively it 's interesting to note that neither greek nor roman writer 's considered them worthy of mention . 
  and even with the restrictions , some artists made true [ masterpieces ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/690/flashcards/6176690/jpg/red_figure_amphora_by_euthymides-148f73d99b930e13d59-1497d30f5fb124f1650.jpg ) . 
  xperia neo v. not bad when it came out but lagged horribly after a few months of use . 
  the 500 mb of internal storage did n't do it any favors . 
  you have to share this video with his friends , preferably on his birthday . 
  a nice reminder of the past on the threshold of his future . 
  plus the ribbing he 'll get !, 
  it 's the same with photos and videos of statues of paintings in museums and galleries . 
  just relax and enjoy the art and the details , you can find countless photos of the artwork in the web and usually in far better quality than that of a shitty photo sensor in minimum light . 
  have you seen * hannibal * ? 
  ( the series ) there ate some rather great ideas for the whole family ( and using the whole body ) . 
   claudia ruiz told wday-tv that her nephew had told her he wanted to do the stunt `` because we want more viewers , we want to get famous '' . 
  well , he got his wish . 
  and a complimentary headstone . 
  my parents visited my new place . 
  while i ~ ~ at ~ ~ was at work , my mum seran wrapped anything with buttons or keys : my pc keyboard , the remote , the cordless phone , a random calculator she probably found in a drawer while searching for the wrap . 
  the answer to my bemused questions was exactly the same . 
  the involvement of the stag hints to possible evidence of baratheon treachery though . 
  safe , as long as the artwork was cloaked in a suitable mythological or religious subject . 
  you could get away with `` susanna and the elders '' but not with `` nude woman being perved by two old men '' . 
  `` and for good measure , outlaw australia and be done with it '' . 
  and greeks . 
  it 's no unusual for a barbecue to last for 6-7 hours . 
  why change a winning recipe ? 
  polonium worked wonders before . 
  an obese geriatric with three failed marriages to trophy wives , 3 failed children from said marriages and narcissistic tendencies ? 
  i was invited to a christmas dinner with my italian roommates family . 
  it was pretty much what you described , a neverending gossip exchange with excellent food . 
  we ended up sleeping in random couches because there were no cabs by the time everything finished . 
  it depends . 
  according to / r/conspiracy , the most convoluted answer is the correct one , so , shadowbaby stannis it is !, 
  flunn knows where the bodies are buried . 
  this is staying blue . 
   they did not want to hide the tile work inside the stalls from view ... 
  what is wrong with these people ? 
  why even bother with doors then , just leave it all open , army style !, 
  no problem . 
  to be fair though , this specific work is rather tame and it 's late enough that it probably would n't cause any trouble anyway . 
  closer to the counter-reformation things were a lot more risky . 
  caravaggio had lots of problems with his commissions , even though the subject matter was religious . 
  he caused scandal when he used the body of a drowned prostitute as a model for a painting of the [ death of mary , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_the_virgin_ ( caravaggio ) ) , or in another case the [ painting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madonna_and_child_with_st._anne_ ( dei_palafrenieri ) ) of mary , anne and christ was removed from the church because the treatment of the subject was deemed unseemly . 
  roughly in the same time the nudes of michelangelo 's last judgment were covered by absurd loincloths and the church started a tight control of what was acceptable .
