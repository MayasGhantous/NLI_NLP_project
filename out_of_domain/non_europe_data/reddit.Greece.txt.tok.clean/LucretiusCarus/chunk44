  the best summary ever [ written ] ( https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/asoiaf-what-are-your-thoughts-on-rhaegar-targaryen.473137/#post-29471143 ) about rhaegar, 
  the best thing rhaegar ever did was dying to robert 's hammer on the trident , in his first ever real battle , like the bitch he was, 
  he exchanged the car for * one * of the summer houses , i bet he did n't really need to hurry . 
  and the other the one is john oliver 's dad . 
  edit : stupid typo, 
  i have this weird feeling that i am now on a list somewhere . 
  oh , my god . 
  it even has a watermark . 
  what a load of bullshit !, 
  \u00a1 marco !, 
  all the couples were great bu the last dudes take the cake , especially when he closes his eyes '' * oh yes , that 's the stuff . 
  also , fuck texting while driving , i was almost run over by a moron who violated a red light because he was sending a text . 
  any day now , right ? 
  he is also great in vicious . 
  '' * this video contains some illustrations that some people might find disturbing * '', 
  oh , bring it on . 
  excellent artist though , it must be fascinating to discover something unexpected like this . 
  i loved the deadpan delivery . 
  oh , you 're in for a treat !, 
  amazing series , c even if it 's somewhat short . 
  i loved fuller 's interpretation of hannibal as lucifer observing and corrupting humanity . 
  and damn he could cook !, 
  i agree . 
  this might be appealing to most , but for me it really breaks my immersion .

  oh , cool , i love my music with a side of cancer !, 
  * you seein ' this shit ? 
  still using my motox , albeit only as a work phone . 
  the form factor is fucking great , the screen holds up well and with a replaced battery it is enough to last for two days . 
  the best device i ever owned . 
   step 1 , put writing asoiaf on hold ... 
  done !, 
  next to elizabeth lawrence , obviously . 
  and to really make him squirm he should be also close to hugh jackman . 
  is it me , or his hair has now a lot more gray , compared to the first few videos ? 
  he was killed by hermes who freed io as commanded by zeus . 
  to honor him hera created the eyes in the peacock 's tail . 
  there is a great eco passage in * how to travel with a salmon * :, 
   what these people do n't realize is that rockefeller does n't need a portable telephone ; he has a spacious room full of secretaries so efficient that at the very worst , if his grandfather is dying , the chauffeur comes and whispers something in his ear . 
  the man with power is the man who is not required to answer every call ; on the contrary , he is always -- as the saying goes -- in a meeting . 
  even at the lowest managerial level , the two symbols of success are a key to the executive washroom and a secretary who asks , `` would you care to leave a message ? '', 
  it 's the all the avocado toast that 's keeping me down . 
  who has time to set and clean everything in a setting like this ? 
  of course , i forgot nothing is hard if you do n't have to do it yourself . 
  some people are just dealt a shit hand . 
  at least he was with family , but man , if there was a dude that deserved to see his kids grow up it 's him . 
  give them an extra hug from an internet stranger . 
  i have the same complicated relationship with broccoli . 
  and have at least one more chin . 
  * triggered !, 
  it 's like their love for states rights , until said states want to fund planned parenthood or allow the consumption of marijuana . 
  and their love for very specific parts of the constitution . 
  * there-there *, 
  meanwhile , i am just happy to see the [ rio-antirrio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rio%e2%80%93antirrio_bridge ) bridge !, 
  incidentally , a fucking feat of engineering science . 
  yay , greece !, 
  wealthcare is also an apt description, 
  cure cancer and aids . 
  but can it be deep-fried ? 
  that a major plot poin in * [ freedom ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8488830-freedom ) * . 
  amazing book btw . 
  yep . 
  the pricing should be interesting . 
  take a look at * kill decision * too . 
  it deals with a nightmarish scenario involving autonomous drones that could perhaps become reality sooner or later . 
  his books are a bit dystopian but ( unfortunately ) he seems to be in the right track . 
  and nicer ambulances !, 
  in my mind he is somewhere in dorne , enjoying lemon cakes . 
  someone deserves to be happy in this series . 
   `` there was no ` second meeting ' between president trump and president putin , just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner , '', 
  yeah , just a brief one-hour conversation without transcripts or non-russian witnesses . 
  nothing to see here folks !, 
  well , not with * that * attitude ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i hear the weather is wonderful this time of year in novosibirsk, 
  the green artifacts are bronze , and it seems it was used on the decorative bits of the chariot . 
  the weels are made of iron but the spokes connecting them to the center were probably wood . 
  enjoy your new phobia !, 
  it 's a climbing snake . 
  australia for sure . 
  i love it . 
  at what point the titles can be considered deliberate trolling ? 
  `` if it is legitimate rape the body has ways of shutting it down '', 
  brought to you by the beautiful minds of todd akin and kellyanne conway . 
  with a blurb by melissa mccarthy, 
  i have the exact same tool and it 's very poorly made . 
  the needles are very thin and end up overlapping when force is applied . 
  it also allow losing its flexibility after 6 months of use . 
  in the end , you get what you pay for . 
  and among the bushes, 
  it seems it 's the paws of a hind leg . 
  i wonder how they 're going to rationalize this once the day passes without any `` locked up dems '' , just more trumpian clusterfucks . 
  what about tiffany ? 
  whe only saw her in the pilot and she 's absent ever since . 
  has she done a benjen ? 
  is tiffany coldhands ? 
  we need answers !, 
  in the past it was 100 % naked buff dudes , as it was amoral to use women . 
  as a result , a lot of artists had a very * sketchy * knowledge of the female body . 
  that 's exactly the etymology of the word !, 
  the paintings and drawings are tolerable , even great in some cases .
