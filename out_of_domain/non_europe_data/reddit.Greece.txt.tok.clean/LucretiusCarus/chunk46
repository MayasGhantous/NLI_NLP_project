  no worries . 
  the got the whole series from my numismatics prof who had set it as a task for his undergrads . 
  they saved my ass countless times . 
  let me on if you need anything else . 
  chromebooks are geared towards productivity and they tend to be weaker compared to similarly priced tablets . 
  if you are interested more in multimedia you might be covered by the asus zenpad 3s 10 . 
  ] ( https://www.pcmag.com/review/349729/asus-zenpad-3s-10 ) it seems to be a solid device for 270 $ . 
  if you wait two weeks or so you might find a better deal in a lenovo tab4 10plus thas supposed to come out mid-august . 
  it 's like a facehugger approaching in slomo, 
  the dolphin looks extremely pleased with himself ... 
  ( ... and the dead fish of course ), 
  from what i see , it has a detachable keyboard on a hinge . 
  it should be able to move on the hinge without disconnecting from the dock , so it 's possible that you have a defective device . 
  check for any obstructions in the connecting parts and try to clean around the connecting pins and the port in case there 's something there . 
  have you considered a [ yoga book ] ( http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/lenovo-yoga-book-1327416/review ) ? 
  it comes with android or windows and has a digitizer that according to all reviewers is wonderful . 
  the downside is that you ca n't draw on the screen but on the glass of the keyboard . 
  otherwise , a samsung might be your best choice . 
  any day now ... 
  they do n't lie ? 
  and if a mistake passes through , they either correct or retract . 
  if i remember correctly , this ( and many other pieces ) were restored by loose beads . 
  it 's possible that the reconstruction is not entirely accurate . 
  he is cute and he knows it !, 
  time worked so differently 6000 years ago !, 
  careful with that edge . 
  the statue just got 10 feet higher !, 
  what object permanence ? 
  the only rational explanation for his behaviour would be a lack of it . 
  can you do a mini review ? 
  how do you like it so far ? 
  how is it battery wise ? 
  do n't forget `` the healthiest tennis [ player ] ( https://365.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3ox5sobmbpldihyy8_ji1dvjdafc_0t5uiabeekruje1.jpg ) to ever tennis '' ( is tennis a verb ? ), 
  nice , thanks . 
  i did n't know that it has a vibration motor . 
  that 's great . 
  i will probably get the 8 plus for my parents and the 10plus for myself - if it ever becomes available . 
  i think it looks good . 
  it does n't seem to be much bigger than the n7 , it just has slimmer bezels . 
  even a robot takes better selfies than me . 
  there is a weird idolization of the original moto x. 
  at the time there were so many expectations for the `` secret google x phone '' and the reveal left a lot of people unimpressed , especially the camera and the `` only 720p '' screen in a time where 1080 was becoming the norm for flagships . 
  impressive !, 
  silver , weight : 12.53 gr . 
  found in amphipolis , macedonia in late classical to early roman context . 
  any help , even in a general direction is greatly appreciated . 
  perfect , thank you . 
  in retrospect , i ca n't believe i missed it . 
  not sure what you mean by that . 
  i have the phone and whole the ergonomics and software are amazing , the camera and speaker were mediocre . 
  the high price also did n't help . 
   lube , patience , gravity . 
  that sounds like the depraved brother of * eat , pray , love * . 
  paul ryan must have the gold in this . 
  what do you mean , i only take my scientific facts from daily mail , naturalnews.com and rob schneider !, 
  it just needs some olive oil , feta cheese , basil and cucumber slices . 
  also , a soupcon of balsamic vinegar if you 're into this thing . 
  yep , but it is mediterranean . 
  we call that * choriatiki * , i.e. 
  village salad, 
  lenovo tab4 8 plus, 
  that sweet relief of death ... 
  strong manbun game !, 
  some of them even lasted for at least 25 scaramuccis !, 
  or , it was just rushed shitty writing . 
  it has happened before . 
  venus was at the louvre , if you want to be racist , at least get your facts straight !, 
  so , it took at least two months to arrive , and half of them were lost in transit ? 
  amazing the low point of view really pays off . 
  though i doubt anyone would clean blood off the blade with their own garment . 
  agreed !, 
  she was a goddess there . 
  imagine trying to breathe with that corset . 
  nice , thanks for the info . 
  and , possibly , chromosomes . 
  this is great !, 
  i really like the depictions that are not based in the show actors . 
  he also wanted a firm hand to control those crownland lords with suspect loyalties . 
  a nice solid wall in front of it . 
  simple and elegant . 
  it 's an excellent exhibition , really make you re-evaluate the ancient sculptures and the evolution of the aesthetic ideal over the centuries . 
  the chios kore in the photo is a nice example , as the [ original ] ( http://theitalianviking.com/link_assignments/2_greek/1002_chios_kore_1.jpg ) preserves a lot of the original colors . 
  * not today !, 
  well , it is in the east and does employ shadow assassins . 
  not sure what you are talking about , that show had four great seasons and then it ended . 
  eight inches of snow, 
  it was very prominent a few years ago , mostly in forums and sms messages , as early os 's did n't properly support the greek encoding out of the box . 
  it 's now almost gone , but a lot of people now in their 20s grew up with that thing . 
  i 'm in the same boat , i really liked their hardware but i could n't stand the software . 
  this is making me very happy . 
  just like the flaming zombie bear . 
  great visuals , poor plot . 
  they just did n't know what to do with winterfell and the characters while danny , jon and cersei were warring in the south . 
  they took the [ holy wisdom ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/aya_sofya.jpg ) church and transplanted it on the [ meteora ] ( http://meteora.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/meteora_panoramic.jpg ) not a bad idea , but the execution could be better . 
  probably just looking for warmth . 
   in a dark corner of a muddy trench that smelled like rotting ~ ~ fish ~ ~ semen . 
  the beres were a nice touch, 
  but you see , they were distinct . 
  there was the one with the spear , the one with the lasso and ... the third one , i guess . 
  was n't alexander also in true blood ?
