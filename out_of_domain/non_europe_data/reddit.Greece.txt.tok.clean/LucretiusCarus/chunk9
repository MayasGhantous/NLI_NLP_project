  if i remember correctly , sinan restored a part of the building . 
  beans really kill the lamb, 
  damn . 
  a waffle would probably be preferred . 
  the google keep widget is easily on of my favourites . 
  i ' d love to find a good one for contacts but most seem meh . 
  there was a redditor yesterday with a moto x with a 1mm gap between the metal and the leather . 
  ahem, 
   matthew 5:17 ; do not think that i came to abolish the law or the prophets ; i did not come to abolish but to fulfill . 
  18 `` for truly i say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the law until all is accomplished . ... 
  sure it 's culture specific but jesus ' coming did not cancel the old testament . 
  then why are christians stil citing leviticus to condemn homosexuality ? 
  if `` all is accomplished '' then the ot would not matter right ? 
  remember , the ten commandments are a key part of the ot and christians in the us consider them valid and in effect . 
  are you sure you understand your bible ? 
  \u0391 7.500 year old shard of a neolithic vessel . 
  i am an archaeologist and it was a chance find in the last day of the excavation . 
  i forgot it in on of my pockets and only found it long after . 
  i was permitted to keep it because we found tons of this kind of pottery . 
  cancer on my fathers side , alzheimer 's on my mothers . 
  boy , i really do n't want to see the winner in my case . 
  an album of additional images [ most of these not oc ] can be found [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rudub ) . 
  the cuirass and helmet are made from iron with some gold attachments . 
  iron with gold ivory inlaids were also used for the sword . 
  the wooden scabbard has disintegrated and only the ivory decorations remain . 
  the greaves are gilt bronze and one of them is a bit shorter than the other , maybe to accommodate a battle wound . 
  the shield is easily the most majestic of the whole display . 
  originally there was a wooden frame on which there was a surface of gilt leather . 
  in the centre there is the pair of achilles killing penthesilia , the queen of the amazones , framed by added ivory , glass and gold decorations, 
  not sure . 
  a typical greek shield would weigh around 8-10 kilos . 
  the one above was a ceremonial shield , only used for short periods of time . 
  depending on the type and thickness of the wood base they used it could weigh a lot more , without significant effect on the bearer . 
  yes , in the on-site museum in [ aiges ] ( http://www.aigai.gr/en/explore/museum/royal/grave/of/philip/aiges/vergina ) , greece , the ancient capital of macedon . 
  alexander 's tomb was located in alexandria and there is no mention of it after the 4rth century a.d. , so it 's either lost or looted and destroyed . 
  yeah , it 's pretty amazing . 
  it 's actually one of the very few intact macedonian tombs that have been discovered and it created quite a stir in the field . 
  the vast majority of the royal and elite tombs were looted even in antiquity . 
  the detail on the gorgon , especially the scales and feathers is amazing . 
  great preservation too . 
  both . 
  olympia was a vast deposit of votive offerings from the greek world . 
  the top has four statuettes reclining on the shoulders of the vase in various relaxed or tensed poses . 
  on the main part , there is a frieze presenting the sacred marriage of ariadne and dionysus , surrounded by satyrs and maenads . 
  friezes of animals , snakes and vines adorn every other surface . 
  additional info [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derveni_krater ) . 
  it 's important to note that there is no trace of gold in the vessel . 
  the color is due to the high amount of tin in the mix . 
  sorry for the low quality photo . 
  as you can see , the exhibition designers went for the `` dramatic '' effect . 
  it 's very impressive to see in person but it does not translate very well in photos . 
  mantano reader or moon reader . 
  the former is cleaner , easier to use , the latter is very customizable . 
  yeah , unless they need medical treatment or pensions . 
  then they have to haul themselves up by their own bootstraps . 
  the hypocrisy is staggering . 
  who knows ? 
  maybe some of his belongings are in some museum , just unrecognized . 
  * not completely . 
  we have a lot of the artifacts , some written material from the clay tablets on pylos and thebes , architectural remains , tombs and echoes of the era in the homeric cycle . 
  two young men , dressed only in tunics attack a lion with sword and spear . 
  the artist used black , white , grey , red and brown colored pebbles to achieve the illusion of polychrome . 
  well , when you have abs like these guys ... 
  nice !,

  two young men and their hunting dog have captured a stag and they are ready to strike . 
  a strong wind from the left unfolds their garments and blows the * petasos * hat from the hunter on the right . 
  the artist signed his work above the figures with '' \u0393\u039d\u03a9\u03a3\u0399\u03a3 \u0395\u03a0\u039f\u0397\u03a3\u0395\u039d '' `` gnosis created '' . 
  it 's one of the finest mosaics of the hellenistic world . 
  go home marge , you are drunk . 
  these are tritones , minor gods of the sea , companions of poseidon and his wife , amphitrite, 
  yeah , that 's the nook color ppi , back in 2010 . 
  a pity , b&n used to have very good devices , only crippled by the software . 
  i still use mine for e-mail and some light gaming . 
  i am pretty sure the guys over at xda will manage to port the l eventually . 
  ... and a tablet that 's supposed to focus on reading and ebooks . 
  with a 149 ppi . 
  the original nook color , released in 2010 , has 170ppi . 
  barnes and noble dropped the ball here . 
  i think i love you !, 
  '' \u0391\u03a1\u03a4\u0395\u039c\u0399\u0394\u03a9\u03a1\u0395 \u0395\u03a5\u03a8\u03a5\u03a7\u0399 '' under his portrait meaning `` have a good soul artemidore '' . 
  what a beautiful object !, 
  i would extend that to the mother . 
  she just let her kid get thrown out . 
  disgusting parents . 
  the fact that the bible frequently contradicts itself does n't really helps this argument . 
  you could justify pretty much everything , depending on the gospel or the apostle you 're quoting . 
  exactly . 
  good guy christian ; actually follows christ !, 
  it was the only way to approach leda . 
  in another episode he turned into a golden rain and got into danae 's chambers . 
  this is a [ fayum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fayum_mummy_portraits ) - style portrait . 
  these paintings were late hellenistic or early roman and rediscovered in egypt in the 19th century . 
  you can see a lot of important pieces in most major museums . 
  a pinterest collection can be found [ here ] ( http://www.pinterest.com/ellenjayebenson/fayum-mummy-portraits/ ) and a flickr collection [ here ] ( https://www.flickr.com/groups/1117481@n24/ ) . 
  devious ... 
  my pleasure !, 
  a lot of these panels look eerily impressionistic . 
  some of them resemble works by gustav klimt with the combination of gold leaf and realistic portraiture , but for me they are people that lived and loved almost 2000 years ago . 
  and now they live forever , as it was the artists intend .
