  please do more !, 
  1 ) i suppose warriors are pretty easy and straightforward , but there is no foolproof calss ( inb4 d/d ele ), 
  2 ) in pvp your gear does n't matter . 
  the stats comes from the runes and amulets , so the cost is practically 0 . 
  3 ) the thread you linked covers the bacics pretty well . 
  imo there are no more tips to give . 
  just play , you 'll only learn by experience . 
  me too ... 
  but i 'm not sure i want to find out ... 
  sw chest trains ... you 'll have more obby shards than you 'll ever need in no time . 
  [ here 's a list with many of them !, 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kf00vvuarducmmmpreprccr-dwrdyccuboly58r-rw/edit#gid=0 ), 
  for the ice bow you can discuss it all you want , but the nerf was needed . 
  it was just way too powerful , simple as that . 
  as for the zerk meta change , i 'd say it falls on anet to deliver . 
  if groups manage to complete the raid using current meta builds , the whole `` we 're getting rid of the berserker meta '' thing will fall apart . 
  i guess i did n't word my post correctly ... what i wanted to say is that if it can be done efficiently with current meta builds ( i did n't mention `` best players '' ) , then the meta wo n't be able to change so easily . 
  key word is efficiently . 
  but it 's does n't matter , the beta is only a week away so we 'll know soon enough . 
  i have noticed that i never get masterwork or better cloth head armor from loot bags/chest . 
  am i the only person this happens to ? 
  oh another keyboard warrior who has n't tried the class recently !, 
  servers only matter in wvw now . 
  in pve and pvp we are all thrown in the same instances regardless . 
  now , with the change in how the population is calculated , you wo n't be able to transfer to a full server fir quite a while , so your best bet is t2 or t3 ( again , servers only matter in wvw ) . 
  lastly , f2p accounts can not transfer . 
  however i think you can whisper/mail one another if that matters . 
  we are not allowed to advertise guilds here . 
  you can check / r/guildrecruitment , [ this section ] ( https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/lookingfor ) of the forums and keep an eye on the in-game map chat . 
  sigh ... 
  better luck next time ... 
  it is tomorrow yes . 
  they discussed it briefly on the twichcon stream , but we do n't have the full notes . 
  you can find they ones they showed on dulfy 's site . 
  [ they 're looking into it apparently ] ( https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/pvp/queue-s-broke/first#post5542139 ) . 
  it 's too early to tell what 's going to happen . 
  but , you can make the set and change the stats whenever things become clear . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/mystic_forge#ascended_equipment_stat_change ) is how you change the stats using the forge . 
  queensdale . 
  it is an actual build ... specifically [ this one ] ( https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/thief/wvw-build-ghost-thief-ganking-zerg-diving/first#post5400415 ) i believe . 
  the are a lot of ways to counter this , but yes , the first few times you come across it , it can seem ridiculous . 
  edit : credit for the build goes to / u/decodecritical, 
  you ca n't do that in this sub . 
  try / r/guildrecruitment and [ this section ] ( https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/lookingfor ) of the forums . 
  [ this one .

  no new dungeons . 
  a comet was supposed to hit europe ? 
  `` louie , i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship . '', 
  well , i have no idea why , but that line has always stuck with me . 
  being a handsome billionaire in my 20s, 
  elaborate on this cum box , please . 
  and like that , the cycle continues . 
  the problem with p/p is that it lacks utility . 
  no aoe damage , no evade skill , slow aa etc etc. 
  while it can work in pvp and wvw in some occasions and it can be fun in open world pve , you will never be able to clear dungeons or raids with that set . 
  no ... d/d simply offers more than p/p in every aspect . 
  [ here ] ( http://metabattle.com/wiki/metabattle_wiki ) and [ here ] ( http://intothemists.com/ ) . 
  also check the forums . 
  update your drivers and if that does n't fix it try repairing the client . 
  i 've dropped hundreds of gold in the forge gambling and never got a thing ... 
  one day i throw in four random rares for a forger daily and out comes dusk . 
  such is life . 
  you can only get one key per week per account now from the lvl10 story . 
  but in any case i 'd go with tomes . 
  you will only get to do one key run and not a `` couple '' . 
  as for tomes , i have no idea if you can use them to level masteries , but they are very easy to get while the scrolls are not . 
  so i 'd rather use tomes . 
  same thing happened to me . 
  now i ca n't log in at all ( ca n't access the forums either ) . 
  2 per rank up . 
  been playing full zerker staff/sb and while at first i had some issues , i got used to it pretty quickly and now everything 's back to normal . 
  you just need to be paying a bit more attention to your surroundings . 
  yeah , som works really well . 
  maybe the new marauder stats will help even more with staff builds . 
  hmm , you do n't say ... 
  if you take staff with som and heal on crit ( cs line ) , you 'll find thinks way easier , even with full berserker stats . 
  also , the new marauder stuff might be of great help . 
  true , you do n't need it . 
  it just makes things more comfortable i guess . 
  though since i switched my armor to marauder , channeled vigor works better . 
  we are not having any issues like this , but i 've heard other guilds are experiencing the same . 
  so since it 's a known bug , i guess you can only sit tight and wait . 
  you do n't necessarily need any experience for this , since this `` dungeon '' is very easy and very very short . 
  but i 'd advise you to treat like any other dungeon lfg post , meaning look for ads that state things like `` all welcome '' , `` fun run '' or something along these lines . 
  [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kf00vvuarducmmmpreprccr-dwrdyccuboly58r-rw/edit#gid=0 ) is a list with many if not most of the gw2 realted youtubers !, 
  rngesus please grace me with your favor . 
  trinkets --  weapons --  armor is the right order . 
  read through [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/3r8e1p/a_problem_ive_noticed_with_guild_halls/ ) op . 
  chrome remote desktop is not built for this sort of thing and so i 'm pretty sure it ca n't handle it . 
  try using something a bit more dedicated to gaming . 
  as for the ping/stuttering issues , the host might be running just fine but you have to factor in the added delay between said host and your vm . 
  there should be a `` guild hall '' button in the top right of the guild panel . 
  not yet it seems . 
  iirc about 20-25 . 
   so as someone who does n't care about skins, 
  peasantry . 
  oh , i did misread your comment ... 
  sorry about that . 
  but to answer your question the most i 've manged to find were 6 pods .
