  there are probably a couple more and i was thinking of trying to track them down with a few friends this weekend . 
  flair checks out . 
  shhhh . 
  if it 's not an official retailer then just do n't buy from them , no matter how `` legit '' the site might be . 
  they are not . 
  you can find the official retailers [ here ] ( https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers ) . 
  i now use marauder gear with berserker trinkets . 
  works like a charm . 
  have you considered joining [ [ teef ] ] ( https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/thief/teef-a-thief-forum-guild ) ? 
   the world seems so empty, 
  that 's what lfg is for . 
   i joined several guilds , never managed to bond with anyone on them , everyone seems on their own business and very distant . 
  look for a guild that suits you , instead of joining guilds just for the sake of being in one . 
   there 's not an open pvp world where you can battle , own or get owned and go back for revenge . 
  wvw is a whole gamemode dedicated to that . 
  my guilds have friends and enemies and feel like families . 
  you just got ta look for one that fits your needs . 
  log in , do chores , and pray for a good drop is what we do here like any other mmo . 
  your problem is that you 're trying to compare two very different mmos . 
  i used to play lineage2 as well many years ago , and it has nothing to do with gw2 . 
  once you get used to both the class itself and the difficulty in hot , you should have no problem with running full berserker stats . 
  now with that said , you can try the new marauder 's stats ( been using them in wvw and it works pretty great ) . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vzaqjawvn8mblphlobgobkmifycb7csc6qzfwsylulbeayaa-trsbqbzuzgzucghdbwv2fu6lpdbt4bakq1f0wraaaxaaa-e ) what i 'm running with ( with marauder stats ) . 
  no base professions , but also not many daredevils and berserkers . 
  fear not brothers , one day we will rise again ( maybe ) ... 
  entering . 
  thank you for the giveaway !, 
  finally make my incinerator . 
  rust and bone, 
  low effort top level comment ? 
  simple stuff !, 
  relax by eliquid france with my plebian set ... too good . 
  something in this post !, 
  i second / u/fubae 's recommendation . . eliquid france 's juices retail between 9-11 $ here in greece for 20ml and their flavors are pretty amazing . 
  also all the liqua stuff . 
  thanks !, 
  interesting . 
  i was thinking of taking the next step and getting into the whole rta thing with either this or a goblin mini . 
  but i see my fears about wicking are in fact real ... 
  i might just sleep on it a bit more . 
  thanks !, 
  debt colony checking in !, 
  cat . 
  awesome !, 
  good luck to you all !,

  grats man !,

  ~ ~ someone correct me if i 'm wrong , but iirc austria has disallowed cross-border sales . 
  so , probably you ca n't buy anything from outside the country . ~ ~, 
  edit : scratch that , apparently they do n't ship outside the uk in general . 
  i find using the 0.5 ohm coils and removing the mesh , greatly improves flavor . 
  [ this atrociously colored juice ] ( http://imgur.com/qc28wjn ) and some relax by eliquid france . 
  after deciding against buying an rta , would a tsunami or velocity be a good start to get into rebuildables ? 
  edit : the aforementioned `` atrociously colored juice '' tastes as bad as it looks . 
  new book smell and fresh bitter coffee . 
  do n't buy that . 
  i 'm still amazed at how bad it is . 
  25 days later by after-8 ( i know ) ... 
  it 's just too good despite the name . 
  best of luck people !, 
  this is great !, 
  thank you !, 
  storm forming in the house, 
  smell of banana and chocolate, 
  europe , why are you so expensive, 
  [ fasttech ] ( https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10020403/4347601-authentic-kamry-k1000-plus-e-pipe-starter-kit ), 
  [ gearbest ] ( http://www.gearbest.com/starter-kits/pp_293585.html ), 
  then your only option is to find it somewhere within your country i 'm afraid . 
  some `` 25 dasy later '' by after-8 ( has become my favorite ) . 
  i finally took the plunge and ordered my first rda , which is the new limitless 24 one ( suspiciously cheap ) . 
  hopefully it 'll work out . 
  have you ever tried asking if they stock pg and vg at a regular pharmacy ? 
  because ours do !, 
  so my limitless rda arrived today . 
  my first rda after months of thinking about getting into rebuilding . 
  the whole thing is so amazing , i regret not buying an rda sooner !, 
  enjoy !, 
  i 'm a total beginner ... 
  currently using the coils that came with my limitless 24 rda , which is my first step into rebuilding . 
  bought the thing two days ago and i 've already put my tanks aside . 
  one week in with my first rda ... 
  i love this thing so much more than my tanks . 
  still have trouble getting the wicking right , but i guess it 's a trial and error thing anyway !, 
  i got my first one a week and a half ago . 
  oh man how i regret not picking one up sooner . 
  you 'll love it !, 
  you can use the 0.5 ohm cubis coils . 
  try removing the mesh for a bit extra flavor . 
  25 days later by after-8 with my rda . 
  almost two weeks after i got it ( tis my first ) , i still giggle like a child when messing around with builds and wicking and stuff . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/oqrpc ) still very new to this but slowly getting better . 
  i you mean the flair , you can edit yours by clicking the option at the top right of the page ( right above `` frequently asked questions '' ) . 
  first actual dry hit . 
  fresh wick at 60 watts ona 0.2 coil . 
  it was really really bad . 
  let 's do this !, 
  good luck to all !, 
  the limitless 24 was my first rda ( got it about a month and a half ago ) and i borrowed a velocity clone from a friend .
