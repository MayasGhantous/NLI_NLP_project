  in general though , you 'll be just fine . 
  looks nice even with the ultem cap , which i 'm not a fan of . 
  would love to give it a try though !, 
  810 huh ? 
  did n't know that , thanks !, 
  but i love mine for what it is . 
  a nice , cheap cloud machine !, 
  plus , i always prefer my flavor a bit weaker than most . 
  what most call `` good , strong '' flavor , usually just makes me nauseous . 
  vince 's tips ? 
  will look into it !, 
  thanks a lot :d, 
  heh , how i wish i could vape only 4-5ml a day . 
  i ordered me a wismec neutron . 
  time for some fun experimenting with that series deck !, 
  actually it is !, 
  but also [ here 's ] ( https://www.sportarena.gr/el-gr/eur/gr_nt_basketball_kits/gr-national-team-basketball-kits?product=26481 ) the practice one , with his actual name on it . 
  cat . 
  cat . 
  til there 's a magical place called cheesecake factory !,

  i got my awesome nc2 !, 
  likes :, 
  does everything i want it to do . 
  is cheap af . 
  the little plate you flip to change between parallel and series is a bit flimsy . 
  the way they implemented the wismec logo . 
  overall 8.5 / 10 , i 'll buy a second one since i really ca n't be bothered with screens and watts and tc and all that . 
  demon killer wires . 
  so , their stuff somehow ended up everywhere here in greece . 
  do n't know how they got marketed that hard but it happened . 
  out of my own miscalculation , i ran out of wire one night and the only thing i could find was dk 's `` alien '' wire , which cost me 12 fucking euros for 15 feet . 
  so i begrudgingly buy it , as i had no other choice , get home and get to building . 
  well shit , it 's just a claptoned ribbon wire . 
  cut to a couple weeks ago when a friend gave me one of dk 's 8in1 coil wheel thingies . 
  some are decent like the hive ones , but even the basic claptons and twisted ones are trash . 
  so yeah , no more dk for me . 
  edit : just to be fair though , the 8in1 thing costs about 12-14 euros and it has 48 coils total . 
  so i guess maybe it could work for some people ? 
  or maybe as a backup or something . 
  not a bad deal , but still not for me . 
  joyetech seems to suffer from the batch curse , similar to smok . 
  my cuboid lasted a year without a hitch , until i killed it by accident . 
  well apparently it was from a `` later '' batch . 
  i fail to understand how this shit keeps happening with , seemingly , half the companies in the industry . 
  fix your shit people !, 
  when you hype up a device for weeks or , even worse , months before release and it ends up being trash , only to be met with a `` well get one from a later batch dumbass '' , i sure as hell wo n't be buying from you again . 
  i ca n't speak about their notch coils since i have n't used them ( or any notch coils for that matter ) , but if they work for you and you like them , then that 's great !, 
  the whole thing 's subjective anyway !, 
  went from 18 down to 6 and then to 3 . 
  natural progression as i now only use drippers !, 
  your hotel will sure have free wifi , along with most bars/clubs/coffee shops and town squares . 
  now for the prepaid packages , head on over to r/greece and check the sidebar . 
  there is a specific wiki entry for that !, 
  i completely agree . 
  i 'd also add bluetooth functionalities and huge touch screens for me . 
  like , what the hell were they thinking ? 
  cheers !, 
  good luck everyone !, 
  my neutron rda from wismec . 
  it 's very airy and flavorful and cheap . 
  but that series deck configuration is what does it for me !, 
  also , when i just wish to fog up the room or annoy my friends , i use my limitless 24 . 
  not a picture yet , but rather a question . 
  why the fuck do companies still continue putting completely shit hex screws in their rdas ? 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( https://imgur.com/a/iqajz ) my neutron in desperate need of new screws . 
  simple fused claptons for today !, 
  price and build quality . 
  features are secondary . 
  first true smartphone was an htc wildfire s !, 
  [ tcf ] ( https://www.thechosenfew.eu ) is located in bulgaria iirc . 
  great site !,
