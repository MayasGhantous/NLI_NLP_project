  they are a favorite in the diy communities here in greece as well . 
  i was comfortable after 4-5 builds . 
  never use a coil jig , just my screwdrivers . 
  but it took me weeks , if not a couple of months , to figure out the wicking side of things . 
  they are the same name . 
  ioannis is just the formal way to spell/say it . 
  yes . 
  what i meant is , giannis ' name is officially ioannis as well . 
  i 'm trying to find something similar in english but i ca n't , sorry !, 
  edit : perhaps william to bill , is a somewhat close example ? 
  sure man . 
  it was just quicker at the time !, 
  oh yes !, 
  good luck all . 
  once again , i got ta say . 
  why the hell ca n't we move away from those shitty hex screws . 
  jaybo , i 've been through two sets already dammit . 
  `` why did they have to ban 100 + mg nicotine . 
  i 'm not a noob '', 
  my `` rainy day '' stash . 
  just a simple strawberry cream thing . 
  it 's 41 degrees out for the 4 day straight , so no chance of me going anywhere and the only shop that does juice deliveries has run out of everything . 
  send help . 
  how expensive nicotine was about to get . 
  serves me right for not stocking up . 
  look into the zelos kit by aspire . 
  great mtl , low power setup . 
  the alien is a bit too much if that 's what you 're going for and pretty far from a starter kit ( imo at least ) . 
  almost every vape shop in both countries you mentioned has it . 
  the last podcast on the left \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 my dad wrote a porno . 
  good luck everyone !, 
  awesome !, 
  so , one of our companies here in greece , made a tzatziki concentrate for some reason i 'll never understand . 
  it is as bad as you 'd expect . 
  i 've fucking hate everything and everyone ( myself inlucded and on the top of the list ) , for years now ... a lot of times i just wish i could go away and just stop having to give a shit ( like dr.manhattan going to mars or something ) ... people say , life is beautiful and full of opportunities and i should be glad for it , but no , fuck them ... just some context in order to avoid unnecessary drama : im in my mid twenties , self-harming and suicide are out of the question ... 
  i just felt like i needed to say this to someone . 
  hello . 
  after my laptop died , i needed a pc an a hurry and on a tight budget that could handle editing and gaming fairly . 
  so i bought on a deal an a8-6600k apu , along with a sapphire r9 270x ( 4gb ) . 
  now with the apu , the graphics card can not reach it 's full potential . 
  so can a bit of overclocking help , or is there any other way ? 
  thanks in advance .

  one fateful morning , while taking part in a giveaway on the glorious pc master radio , me and other brothers were asked to go to an online peasant gathering place and spread the word of gaben . 
  and while pondering on how i could achieve my goal , i came up with an idea ... and the idea was to descend to the peasant abyss . 
  their irc chatrooms ( * shudders * ) . 
  thus the_ambassador was was born , spreading the word and trying to make them see past the deceit , the lies and the denial that plagues them . 
  but in a peaceful manner , for i did not want to see them as enemies , but rather as potential brothers in the arms of the pcmr . 
  so here 's what i said :, 
  along with the link i sent them : http://i.imgur.com/ecxgwi6.jpg, 
  my efforts were not received well . 
  lot 's of ass fucking and insults were thrown against me . 
  but some of them replied well and with humor . 
  maybe , just maybe , there is hope for some of them and these people need our help to take the leap . 
  am i done ? 
  what was just an idea to enter a competition sparked something inside me . 
  the_ambassador will live on !, 
  peacefully and with facts spreading the word of our lord in the far corners of the internet . 
  but you can help too !, 
  there can be more than one . . we can be legion . 
  you too can assume the glorious name and do our lord 's work with one condition : be nice to them for they are lost . 
  it 's only the beginning ... more to come . 
  edit : spelling .
