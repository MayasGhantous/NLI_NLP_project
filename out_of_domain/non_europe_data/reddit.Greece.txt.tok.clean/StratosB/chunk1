this one is from a bbc documentary . 
  found some videos on this :, 
  ~ 2min video of the op : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxl8f-eioim, 
  some copepod flashing ( probably from the same documentary ) : http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p006v478, 
  and some captured ostracods demonstrating their defence mechanism : http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p024m0s1, 
  the first one is a flatworm . 
  the second is probably an annelid worm ( oligochaeta ) . 
  ( * greetings from greece . 
  i am a biologist , currently doing plankton research in hcmr , age 29 . 
  * ) i do n't know how things are in canada , but imho aiming for a research career to make money is absolute insanity . 
  going down this path , high initial time investment , mental fatigue and a very competitive environment for advancement should be expected . 
  doing this under the pressure of reality can bent even the most stubborn . 
  starting a well planned small business should yield much better results and overall income ( and possibly be less risky as a life investment ) . 
  if you can somehow utilise your love for science in your business , the better . 
  puny humans think they have the power to destroy the earth . 
  * on a more serious note : * we are ( possibly ) able to ( at best ) destroy our way of life as we know it . 
  life is extremely stubborn when it comes to surviving . 
  and yes , living under caves up on remote mountains , with an average life expectancy of 30 years and scavenging for bits of technology over a nuclear wasteland , is still surviving . 
  environmental dynamics and environmental management are a different thing . 
  the one is a `` state '' and the other is an `` act '' upon a `` state '' . 
  similarly , surviving and quality of life are two totaly different things . 
  it 's a given that you ca n't aim for quality of life without . . surviving . 
  it 's important to discern our `` beliefs '' from the facts when we assess environmetal dynamics , and it 's also important to know the impact of our environmental policies , so we can ensue effective management . 
  the real question is ** which world do you want to live on ? 
  ** life will find a way . 
  with or without us , with or without our management . 
  but if you are unable to plan and dream for the future properly , the future will take care of that for us . 
  and it wo n't be in our favor ( as a human civilization . . probably . . imo ) . 
  we have a rough view of what 's to come , and it 's ugly . 
  only pondering just for the impact of a dramatic climate change will have on immigration can make you feel dizzy . 
  we are talking probably for hundreds of millions . 
  it 's not that i disagree with the view that capitalism has the potential to destroy our way of life . 
  i strongly disagree though that it is the only , or even the major culprit in our case . 
  capitalism has a certain way of dealing with the conficts of interests . 
  if there is a need , it creates a market . 
  if there is no need , it creates one ( that 's another discussion though ) . 
  but removing capitalism as a factor does not exempt interests ( and the frictions they cause ) . 
  politicians have always been `` shortsighted '' on matters that require longterm commitment . 
  here is where i believe capitalism creates a problem . 
  there is active pressure from the already established energy market that makes it almost impossible to sustain a robust policy against them . 
  that is unless you replace them with another market . 
  and to replace the almighty `` fossil fuels lobby '' with another lobby . . 
  you are in for a rough ride . 
  any kind of lobby though is and will be profit driven , which eventually creates more conflicts of interests between them and parts of society . 
  make no mistake , the rising companies that promote renewable energies , ** are ** lobbing and they are looking to serve ** their ** interests . 
  basically is an endless spiral of stupidity , that makes me say `` fuck this . 
  i do n't care anymore . 
  do whatever you want . '', 
  can you describe where you found it ? 
  was it attached on the vegetation seen in your photo ? 
  as fetus , you describe the organism as a whole , or is somewhere `` in '' there , that ca n't be seen clearly ? 
  is there some kind of spine formation on the sides of this `` fetus '' ? 
  one more question . 
  in the third picture , the circular formation is a mouthlike openning with cilia ? 
  am i seeing that right ? 
  also , what shows along the axis is the spine formation ? 
  alright !, 
  i believe those are some kind of tunicates ( maybe salps ? ) . 
  they are in poor shape , probably dead ( they are kinda big to be salps though ) . 
  maybe someone that knows the local sea fauna can tell us more . 
  what you call a heart , is their nucleus , their `` head '' equivalent . 
  i do n't really lean toward salps either to be honest . 
  [ not the bees !,

  [ stop arguing on a false basis . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_operations ) there is a reason we use ( simple ) rules as these , it 's to avoid confussion . 
  you are , and maybe rightfully , but on the wrong basis . 
  the reason the order of operations exists is obvious ( it 's there to solve a problem ) . 
  the order of operations not being communicated properly , or being ( feeling ) counter-intuitive is a legitimate discussion on an educational basis . 
  maybe that was the subject of the debate . 
  * ktel ( greek : \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac \u03a4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03b9\u03c3\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u039b\u03b5\u03c9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , `` bus common income funds '' ) is the main intercity public transport bus service in greece . 
  it is a cooperation of 62 regional bus companies , usually named after the regional unit they serve , e.g. 
  ktel imathias for imathia . 
  ktel was founded in 1952 . 
  the ktel companies provide 80 % of all passenger transportation in greece . 
  [ 1 ] interregional transport , e.g. 
  to athens , is provided by most of the ktel companies . 
  * ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ktel_ ( greece ) ), 
  other smaller private companies/individuals exist , but they mostly cover specific routes , or are hired for a group of individuals to serve as their transport for a specific period of time or route . 
  most of those drivers are basically freelancers ( as far as i know ) . 
  i just wanted to add that this happens because after a threshold in density difference , water does n't mix ( in case it was n't obvious ) .

  true . 
  nice . 
  adding up to that , there is a political aspect regarding muslims in greece . 
  there exists a big muslim minority in thrace ( northeastern continental part of greece ) , which is under strong political influence from turkey . 
  as a result , the thracian autonomic movement finds strong support among the muslims there , who other than that just stick to themselves and do n't cause any trouble . 
  this fact creates some anti-muslim feelings ( which are mostly anti-turkish to be honest ) and mainly in the local greek non-muslim population of thrace . 
  other than that , there are the fasists of golden dawn and their supporters who just . . hate everyone .
