  shit got real . 
  thats a. . tricky question . 
  the anti-american feelings are mainly evident in leftists in greece . 
  this is due to the catalytic support of the american goverment over the military coup d'etat in 1967 , an event that triggered such a backlash that led president clinton in a public excuse for the matter ( [ source ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/21/world/clinton-tries-to-subdue-greeks-anger-at-america.html ) ) . 
  how america pursued its interests in the area was . . questionable to say the least . 
  it 's important to note that greek anti-american sentiments are over the american goverment , not the american people . 
  now , the golden dawn , as a typical braindead racistic mishmash , prey over weaker racial/sexual minorities , people with no power to fight an angry mob , people with no `` fancy '' ( for their tastes ) racial identity . 
  many of their supporters also sympathize with the notion of a new junta . 
  they also despise leftists and the prior greek leadership that signed the memorandum of agreement ( whom they deem as traitors ) . 
  the criminal activity of golden dawn has ceased at the moment . 
  they are laying low because their leadeship is being prosecuted . 
  true . 
  it 's unlikely we will have a transition to a new currency in such a sort time . 
  even if we do , euros will be fine for at least the first 6 months from the transition . 
  . . and we have nothing better to do when in unrest , than . . banging rocks , right ? 
  those projects you describe have already been in a stalemate , because , although mainly funded by european funds , the greek contribution to the budget ( a requirement for the eu funds to be capitalised ) has effectively ceased . 
  that 's no new issue . 
  non the less , i believe a terminal breakdown of negotiations would bring various problems to the table , like eu refusing to distribute funds and/or refusing to recognise greece as a schengen member , forcing greece out of the eurozone . 
  those tools of extortion will need to be devised though cause there is no such framework statutory in ez ( unless the ez leaders somehow grow rational and stop this madness altogether ) . 
  as a consequence , i 'm very concerned about science funding , which is almost solely funded by eu funds . 
  [ the true greferendum dilemma . 
  we 'll see how far the extend of the eurocrysis can reach . 
  one can only wonder . 
  survival of the fittest . 
  europe is no longer fit for the situation at hand . 
  adapt , and survive . 
  persist , and perish . 
   the juncker stuff says - the eu did not want to cut pensions , also they would support a program to support the poor - eu wanted bigger defense budget cuts - they wanted an effective system to collect taxes - and get rid of tax exemptions for ship owners . 
  sadly , for mr juncker , both proposals are written and published ( not that the greek proposal is any better ) . 
  mr juncker said , `` do n't commit suicide because you are afraid of death '' . 
  so our choices are suicide or death ? 
  that 's no dilemma .

  those pieces of rock almost brought war against the two countries . 
  those rocks where just the spark . 
  there is too much fuel left in both our `` hate buckets '' . 
  it 's stupid . 
  it always is . 
  after a point passed , politicians are incapable to do anything . 
  it spirals down quickly out of control . 
  there was too much public involvement , with journalists from major media participating in `` national activism '' and spreading public outrage . 
  the american involvement , although a bit late , was catalytic to relieve the tension . 
  voutsis said 20m ( about 50 % the cost of the previous elections ) . 
  i guess we 'll pay somewhere around 20 to 180m . 
  * follow your heart . 
  seriously ? 
   we are looking for talented , energetic , people who want to make a difference in this world . 
  dat standard overused punchline though !, 
  no worries mate . 
  our quarrel was never with the people of europe . 
  it 's politicians and the politics imposed that fell sort of expectations .

  * wake me up when september ends . 
  from the latest proposal ( [ source ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-5270_en.htm ) - see attachment ) :, 
   privatization, 
   * the board of directors of the hellenic republic asset development fund will approve its asset development plan, 
  which will include for privatisation all the assets under hrdaf as of 31/12/2014 ; and the cabinet will endorse the, 
  plan . 
  * to facilitate the completion of the tenders , the authorities will complete all government pending actions including, 
  those needed for the regional airports , trainose , egnatia , the ports of pireaus and thessaloniki and hellinikon, 
  ( precise list in technical memorandum ) . 
  this list of actions is updated regularly and the government will ensure, 
  that all pending actions are timely implemented . 
  * the government and hradf will announce binding bid dates for piraeus and thessaloniki ports of no later than, 
  end-october 2015 , and for trainose rosco , with no material changes in the terms of the tenders . 
  * the government will transfer the state 's shares in ote to the hradf . 
  * take irreversible steps for the sale of the regional airports at the current terms with the winning bidder already, 
  selected . 
  privatizations were n't even the cause of the breakdown in negotiations . 
  greek side had already agreed to them . 
  there was a difference of about 500m ( 8.5 b instead of 8b ) , and the implacability of troika to accept some alternative measures . 
  super . 
  check it , heraklion-thessaloniki . 
  ofc . . 
  * disclamer : i 'm going to overreact . 
   how do greek citizens see the options ahead of them in the referendum . 
  like someone pointing a gun in your face and asking you `` do you to die now , or sometime later ? '' . 
  so we put all our strength in one last slap . 
   what they mean for their future, 
  mass migration along with middle eastern refugees . 
   what do you anticipate the result will be, 
  * my only semi-serious response * 51-55 % for either yes or no .
