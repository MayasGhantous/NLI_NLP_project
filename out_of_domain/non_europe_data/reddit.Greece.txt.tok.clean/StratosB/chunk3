  iama biologist researcher , currently working in hcmr and am voting `` no '' . 
  also , our workers union has recently taken openly a position `` against the old and any new memorandums that further devaluate research and work conditions '' . 
  but you do n't see that in the media . 
  * hcmr ( hellinic center for marine research ) is a public institution that does marine and inland waters research , in the sectors of genetics , fisheries , oceanography and marineculture . 
  i was n't aiming to be agreesive . 
  i 'm just stating , that what is circulated in the media , is not always ( * it 's rarely , actually * ) true . 
  i also want to state , that we , as those being involved in research have ** everything ** to loose in the case of an ez exit . 
  but it 's also a fact that through the last couple of years everything is crumbling around us , and continuing following this beaten track is certain doom for research in greece .

  after that , we wait ecb 's answer to ela extension for the goverment to act accordingly . 
   while the debt greece has amassed is created by and can be payed off by greeks that live now . 
  i 'm sorry , but [ 2054 ] ( http://crisisobs.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/economist_3.png ) does n't sound like `` current generation '' to me . 
  moreover , ridiculous primary surlplus targets were assumed for those goals to be reached . 
  and the real culprits wo n't pay a dime . 
  it 's always the `` usual pack mules '' that carry the burden . 
  that goes for european taxpayers too . 
  a private debt was converted to national with the greek national reform programs .

  i see what you did there . 
  stop terrorizing foreign people . 
  they believed helen louka is an average middle aged woman . 
  i wo n't be surprised they 'll take you for an average greek reddit user . 
   it 's actually financial racketeering , fuck them . 
  too busy getting fucked by them . 
  picturesque like the summer sunset !, 
  we will block the sun for ages !, 
  feel the power of our savings !, 
  `` you know nothing , john varoufakis . . '', 
  * thrusts dagger *, 
  `` for the eurozone . '', 
  i wo n't try to convince you about anything , i just wanted to point out that greece pushing the rest of the europe , as perspective is a bit . . skewed . 
  also , syriza is not the cause of the problem , it 's the effect . 
  austerity brought syriza to power , and it 's not because it is a good choice , it 's either syriza or the nazi party of golden dawn or the greek communist party . 
  people craved for a change , syriza was just a bet . 
  a bet trying to halt the imminent destruction that further austerity would bring . 
  non the less , europe 's inability to deal with its problems is monumental . 
  instead of trying to find a long term sustainable solution , we throw racial `` arguments '' to each other to satisfy our internal audience . 
  the proposal offered as a `` take it , or leave it '' deal , would effectively cause the collapse of the goverment . 
  it would n't pass from the greek parliament . 
   maybe one of the flaws was letting countries into ez too easy, 
  it was ( maybe it still is ) . 
   maybe grexit will actually fix some of these flaws, 
  you do n't fix something by breaking it . 
  the `` problem '' with euro is that once in there is no way out . 
  if countries are allowed to leave the eurozone at will , the whole existence of euro is under question . 
   that does n't mean that the flaws ca n't be fixed , and that a grexit will spell the doom of eu and/or ez, 
  eu is riddled with flaws , but it 's working its way out of them , although at a very slow pace . 
  the problem here is that there is no longer time to take the slow road . 
  a grexit might be a `` solution '' , but it will be far from the optimal . 
   greece should focus on what it can control - its own policies and government, 
  the greek goverment ca n't make its own policies without having the `` ok '' from troika . 
  that by itself creates `` frictions '' when `` radical '' ( as they deem themselves ) leftists try to compromise with `` strict '' neoliberals . 
  nothing ( and that 's a problem ) . 
  but they also have their hands tied until they have an agreement . 
  greece has to come to an agreement with its creditors , one way or another . 
  it ca n't progress forward otherwise . 
  also we are equally vulnerable to mob mentality , like any other country . 
  rallying for, 
  * 100 % vat forepayment for self employed ? 
  * 13-23 % vat for hotels and restaurants ? 
  * 23 % vat in canned and processed food ? 
  * firesale of every public asset that can bear a profit ? 
  * effectively killing the greek pharmaceutical industry ? 
  * ( you get the point ), 
  we did have those .

  23 % was asked on the proposal that led to referendum . 
  because we are speaking tourism , neighbouring countries must be taken into account if you want to stay competitive . 
  turkey for example has 8 % . 
  the 13 % ( which will probably be the target percentage for an agreement ) was the vat level for accomodation for some years before , when the previous goverment took the decision to lower it because it actually had adverse effects on income . 
  a 23 % would simply kill the tourism industry . 
  no we did n't . 
  unless you are refering to restaurants ( which , i am not ) . 
  the 23 % vat increase will be on canned/processed food for general consumption , typically all the edible stuff you can buy from the supermarket . 
  that 's a direct cut on the income of the poorest greek people and a measure actually proposed by the greek goverment , not the institutions . 
  also , trying to fight rampart tax evasion when on the brink of bankruptcy , is a bad joke . 
  i have no idea how it would actually work , but it would be on the line of `` what was your income last year ? 
  gim me an extra 23 % beforehand , and if you gain less this year we 'll give you the difference back ( someday ) '' . 
  it 's a joke , it will create myriads of problems , and it will be a major setback for future investments . 
  it is clearly a measure for gaining cash fast and a very bad one at that . 
  also , you do have to pay vat , even if your invoice is n't payed in time in greece too . 
  it 's been like that for years ( i think ) . 
  / r/greece would never be the same without you .
