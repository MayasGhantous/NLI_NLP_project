  we are waiting to see how the debt relief will be carried out , so we can judge if all this was ultimately for nothing . 
  stay tuned . 
  they probably considered a couple of alternative plans . 
  their reaction as of now , tells me that non of them is considered even close to sucking up the austerity pill ( for a develpment plan and a debt restructuring ) . 
  a transition to drahma , under the current conditions , would be in a state of panic and uncontrolled defaulting . 
  printing and organising a new currency can take months , and you 'll still have to continue negotiating with creditors for defaulting terms , minimize the permanent damage to your economy for not having a working banking sector and , somehow , manage to cover pensions and federal sector payments .

   after the greek financial crisis and bailouts of greek banks in 2012 swiss-luxembourg based efg group , the then owner of eurobank , was told to separate the greek bank from the rest of its business . 
  in july that year eurobank was deconsolidated from the group and the shares sold to the greek latsis family and was renamed eurobank ergasias ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurobank_ergasias ) ) . 
   efg group would transfer 43.55 percent of its 44.7 percent stake in the greek lender to nine younger members of the latsis family , a major shareholder in eurobank which made its fortune in shipping , the bank said ( [ source ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/23/us-greece-eurobank-idusbre86m09x20120723 ) ) .

  let me copy a question i 've made in the video , that has been bugging me for a while :, 
   suppose we go past a supermassive black hole 's event horizon ( for the sake of being confortably far from the singularity ) . 
  now , assuming that the event horizon is not a special place in space ( as in some recent theories that treat it like a firewall or a fuzzball ) , would we be able to escape the black hole by ( somehow ) `` applying '' negative curvature to spacetime ( imagine it like a modified form of an `` alcubierre-like '' drive ) ? 
  * ignoring the various perils one might meet before entering a black hole . 
  let me clarify a bit more . 
  i am aware that it 's probably impossible to answer such a question without accounting for certain assumptions ( i 'm interested in those too ) . 
  take the `` application of negative curvature '' as in `` progressively flattening '' . 
  what would be the result of such an `` application '' on the geometry of the black hole ( does it collapse ) ?

  check out jeremy england 's theory from the physical perspective ( [ lecture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91d5uaz-f4 ) , [ paper ] ( http://www.englandlab.com/uploads/7/8/0/3/7803054/2013jcpsrep.pdf ) ) . 
  what he is basically proposing is that life is an arrangement of molecules capable of converting work energy in a warm bath through a process that is thermodynamically more efficient in dissipating heat than radiation , which can arise simply through entropy . 
  it really widens your perspective .
