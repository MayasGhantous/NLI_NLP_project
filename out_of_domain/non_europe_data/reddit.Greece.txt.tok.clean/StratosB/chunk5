  awkward ( the first thing that came to mind ) . 
  the correct answer is : `` we ca n't get a reliable estimation with just two observations '' . 
  then you proceed into making assumptions about carole 's reading habits and provide any logical answers that derive from that . 
  assuming carole 's reading patterns follow the normal distribution and the numbers provided are in either end of the distribution , is as good a guess as any . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the book might be ending in 30 pages . 
  edit : i 'm actually terribly wrong . 
  do n't upvote me .

  it seems they deliberately use `` provocative '' phraseology to promote their view . 
  there is some serious `` cause/effect '' confusion throughout the piece , as well as drawn analogies taken quite literally . 
  all in all , the paper explains how can we employ already developed learning algorithms to come up with intuitive answers to complex evolutionary problems , which by itself is very interesting , but is lost through the overdrawn analogies . 
  you are correct , but the actual paper does indeed overdraw its analogies , to the point it seems they deliberately used exaggerated wording . 
  the result , sadly , is that the actual point ( how we can employ already developed learning algorithms to solve complex evolutionary problems ) is missed ( for example [ this piece ] ( http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-evolution-might-be-more-intelligent-than-we-think-it-is ) totaly misses the point by overemphasizing on the `` intelligence '' aspect ) .

  an interesting article that seems to tackle the core of the problem :, 
   [ ** logical pre - and post-selection paradoxes are proofs of contextuality ** ] ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07850v2.pdf ), 
   * matthew f. pusey , matthew s. leifer *, 
   * if a quantum system is prepared and later post-selected in certain states , `` paradoxical '' predictions for intermediate measurements can be obtained . 
  this is the case both when the intermediate measurement is strong , i.e. 
  a projective measurement with luders-von neumann update rule , or with weak measurements where they show up in anomalous weak values . 
  leifer and spekkens [ phys . 
  95 , 200405 ] identified a striking class of such paradoxes , known as logical pre - and postselection paradoxes , and showed that they are indirectly connected with contextuality . 
  by analysing the measurement-disturbance required in models of these phenomena , we find that the strong measurement version of logical pre - and post-selection paradoxes actually constitute a direct manifestation of quantum contextuality . 
  the proof hinges on under-appreciated features of the paradoxes . 
  in particular , we show by example that it is not possible to prove contextuality without luders-von neumann updates for the intermediate measurements , nonorthogonal pre - and post-selection , and 0/1 probabilities for the intermediate measurements . 
  since one of us has recently shown that anomalous weak values are also a direct manifestation of contextuality [ phys . 
  113 , 200401 ] , we now know that this is true for both realizations of logical pre - and post-selection paradoxes . 
  sadly , i do n't have the background to evaluate its contents . 
  backup complete !, 
  polyploid speciation would like to disagree , 
  oh , i 'm not even remotely sure . 
  i just take every chance i get to mock them . 
  there is nothing to discuss with people that deny fundamental human rights on the base of race/religion/any-other-retarted - reason . 
  a discussion with two sides that have such basic , fundamental ideological ( ? ), 
  differences , is a void discussion . 
  it 's like trying to discuss with a religious person on the basis of `` suppose there is no god '' . 
  surely you can discuss other things , but trying to reach a common verdict regarding humanitarian issues with people that believe the solution is `` let them drown like the dogs they are '' is not going to get you anywhere . 
  btw , i was specifically refering to golden dawn , not the german nazi party and its horrific history or the implications of a neonazi ideology becoming prevalent again in europe . 
  first , the supposed `` coup '' against gd has nothing to do with me believing anything . 
  there was a murder case that led to gd being prosecuted as a criminal organization that also unearthed their various other criminal activities and shaddy practices , including murder of migrants , weapon stashes , human trafficking , selling `` protection '' , organization of military campuses , `` recruitment '' of young people from schools . 
  second , there is a difference in me being hostile on rasist ideology , simply because i believe that it is fundamentaly wrong . 
  they do n't run the risk from me denying their right to believe in anything or their right to live/prosper/reproduce / etc. 
  i ca n't say that for myself from their point of view . 
  if you support human rights , you support them for everyone without question , and i quote, 
   human rights are rights inherent to all human beings , whatever our nationality , place of residence , sex , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , language , ** or any other status ** . 
  we are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination . 
  these rights are all interrelated , interdependent and indivisible ( [ source ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/pages/whatarehumanrights.aspx ) ) . 
  and this obviously includes the people who believe and spread racist ideology . 
  our `` weapons '' against those people are our arguements and our tolerance . 
  again , gd is not ( and will never be ) like the nazi party in germany . 
  please take a moment to read the other replies , cause i 'm tired of repeating myself . 
   first of all i 'm not supporting gd . 
  at all , they are nuts . 
  i did n't form the impression you were supporting them , but i got plenty of flak for my crude joke , so i had to be thorough . 
   my point was actually that if we can go after these people for being incompatible with our values we can go after other groups for the same . 
  ofcourse we can and we do , and it can be contructive as long as it 's done in a civil manner . 
  but trying to argue constructively with an agreesive , provocative , knife bearing man is madness . 
   sure they were caught for various crimes but that was the result of investigation not the cause of the investigation . 
  the cause was political . 
  there certainly was political will behind the prosecution , although they are not being prosecuted for their political beliefs ( and they ca n't be ) , but for their criminal activities . 
  whatever the reason , gd now has a solid base of 600k ( + ) supporters and is an ominous reality of greek politics . 
  this base will not disolve by the leadership 's imprisonment . 
  the defeat must be social and political , which seems highly unlikely in the short future . 
   hardcore right wing middle eastern values are not compatible with our own . 
  hardcore * anything * is incompatible by design . 
  islamofasists are currently the most dangerous type of fasists . 
   if you 've only ever spoken to that type i understand why you would think `` they are just like us '' . 
  they are * humans * like us . 
  they do n't share the same values . 
   there is always a chance they will absolutely refuse to . 
  in small numbers it is manageable because they become immersed in our culture .
