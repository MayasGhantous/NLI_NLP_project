  too many and that never happens ... 
  i think you underestimate the culture differences and the problems of trying to integrate too many at the same time . 
  it 's literally never been done . 
  the whole recent history of the modern greek state is literally a history of non-integration . 
  christian priests secretly preserved and taught the language and history of the former byzantine empire for over 300 years under the othoman empire . 
  the situation in france is a recent example of failure in integration , despite the pass of three generations . 
  a successful integration is not a trivial matter . 
  and everything we do to this point is repeating the same mistakes of the past , over and over and over . 
  we are clustering all those people together , with no real prospect , let them fend for themselves , which means they will go by there own laws and ideals and try to enforce them . 
  there are no easy solutions . 
  the flux of migrants is so big it 's impossible to stop . 
  there is already an adaptive market for human trafficking in each step of the way . 
   they literally scream at my friends parents saying they ruined his son and that he will never be the same and that they do n't even know if they should consider him family anymore and so on . 
  good ol' people and their cemented brains . . eeeh , ideals . 
  i initially thought this episode was too serious . 
  and then adam proceeded to perform a reverse squat . 
  just remember to keep equal distance from both stars , so as you get grilled evenly . 
  best regards ,, 
  your local space cannibals, 
  currently unemployed and with little luck on finding a temporary job ( until funding resumes in research ) without a friend 's friend recommendation . 
  every job ad , no matter how mundane , requires a good amount of previous experience . 
  there is little you can do outside your area of expertise . 
  time passes , while the thought of migration matures . 
   how likely do you think it is for golden dawn to rise to power ? 
  it 's not like there is no possibility of a xenophobic and/or ultranationalist movement ( or coup ) coming to ( or seizing ) power , but it probably wo n't be gd . 
  maybe . . 
  lol xd, 
  it 's the typical drill since the last six years . 
  politicians `` fiercely '' negotiate with the creditors , drawing red lines and stuff , and a month or two later the worst senario that has been propagating through the media comes to fruition . 
  this time it 's the sweeping reforms in the pension system that finally broke the last straw for the vast majority of people , including the vast majority of the middle class , doctors , engineers and small to medium size buisness owners . 
  the fact that even employers went into strike , led to the biggest rally since a long time before . 
  and we have n't even been talking about the extra fiscal messures that need to be implemented in order to ensure the required primary surplus , necessary for dept repayments . 
  tl ; dr : nothing improved . 
  infact most signs lead to things becoming a lot worse .
