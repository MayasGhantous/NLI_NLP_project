   since 2009 , eupedia also has a dedicated section for genetics focusing chiefly on european population genetics , historical genetics and genetic genealogy , as well as related fields such as prehistory , archaeology and anthropology . 
   at eupedia we consider that the knowledge of history is essential to understand the complex ethnic , cultural and linguistic patchwork of the modern world . 
  retracing the ancestry and ancient population movement in europe and its interactions with other regions like west asia or north africa provides valuable insight into what it means to be european today and what common heritage europeans share with their neighbours . 
  understanding the diversity of genetic variations in society and how numerous historical migrations shaped our genes and identity is one of the most potent ways to eradicate xenophobia and dispel myths about racism . 
  homogeneous populations have nothing to do with specific alleles chosen to specifically observe such differences as the ones presented here . 
  there are genetic loci which you can observe much more recent differences even ** within ** populations . 
  unless you believe some random gene that codifies a random transcription factor in a random cascade of a metabolic process , or even worse a random change in a literally random locus on the genome satisfies the racial criteria . 
  as far as i am concerned , such interpretations are baseless and unscientific . 
  the labels are n't that misleading if you are using them to define groups of people in a historical , cultural setting to map their interactions . 
  interpretations such as the `` greek gene '' or the `` roman gene '' are misleading .

  as long as you stay true on scientific methodoly , everything will be fine ( eventually ) . 
  everything is tied to the debt assessment , from voucher funds , to science funds as well as construction funds . 
  on top of that there is the usual bureaucratic stall . 
  last time it took them a year to get organised in order to start accepting applications , and procedures did n't normalise until the very end . 
  there is no reason to expect it will be any different this time . 
  you can , but it will cost you a 24 % extra . 
  it happens . 
  you ca n't run from the inevitable .

  bring us some freedom and fresh trump memes . 
  i would n't call xanthi or komotini `` small and isolated communities '' , but whatever fits your views i guess . . 
  you really have no idea what `` scarcely populated '' means in greece . 
  xanthi and komotini are municipal capitals . 
  they are by no means `` isolated communities '' . 
  the fact that now a significant muslim minority operates in athens simply urges more the need for well organised infrastructures with state appointed imams so we can minimize the influence of radicals and foreign interests . 
  edit : stop looking at wikipedia and spitting numbers . 
  most of the `` cities '' there are indistinguishable from athens . 
  just jumping in to say that as far as suffering goes , the debate is still open . 
  pain and nociception do n't require a central nervous system in the form of a brain . 
  it 's a very complex issue , initially approached philosophically and anthropomorphically which does n't really help to resolve it scientifically . 
  however , in at least the last 60 years , there have been significant advances in our understanding of animal suffering , which along with public initiative led to the legislation of standard rearing practices for farmed animals in order to minimize their stress , pain and suffering during every farming procedure . 
  as a byproduct of this , we 've also got better quality products . 
  * edit * : also , the matter of sentience is an open debate . 
  according to [ avibase.bsc-eoc . org ] ( http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?lang=en&amp;p2=1&amp;list=howardmoore&amp;synlang=el&amp;region=griizk&amp;version=text&amp;lifelist=&amp;highlight=0 ) there are four owl species in zakynthos , * athene noctua * , * otus scops * , * asio otus * and * asio flammeus * . 
  scroll down to strigiformes , click the links of the species and listen to their recordings . 
  see if you can identify them this way .

  edit : at least we agree that such high youth unemployment severely impacts the growth prospects in the long term , and something needs to be done about it . 
  who cares . 
  it 's a fact . 
  period .

  get over it . . 
  and yet we have no clear plan or prospect for the future . 
  let 's just try to change that , shall we ? 
  if you hated the roads in athens , you 'll love the roads in the rest of greece .

   i think euler 's formula is always ** presented poorly ** . 
  it usually presented as `` here 's this unintuitive result , and ** here 's this bland proof ** . '', 
  the question is ** the result ** , which is ** not answered via a proof ** . 
  it comes ** out of nowhere ** , and ** people just have to trust us ** , which is ** unmathematical ** . 
  it 's ** thrown at you ** , with ** no motivation ** and usually for just the shock value . 
   what ** we should do ** is have it be the ** answer to a well-motivated question ** . 
  it should be the answer to `` what value should a complex exponent have ? '', 
  the greatest thing about america is that people like you ( aka of foreign descent ) can identify and are accepted as americans . 
  there is no other nation on earth like this . 
   who can blame them ? 
  nd slowly drifting into anti-memorandum mode is like that bad nightmare that persists after you waking up a dozen times due to it , yet you keep getting back to sleep only to wake up a few moments later . 
  point by point :, 
  * political instability in greece is due to foreign originated policies that governing parties ca n't relate and claim as their own , which alienates the electorate base driving them to smaller parties or abstention . 
  with that being said , proportional representation * is * more prone to stalemates than first past the post , while still preserving a two dominant party system . 
  elections in greece are rather frequent , but that 's due to governments resigning earlier for strategical reasons . 
  * in proportional representation the exact percentage of the total votes each party gets directly translates to the same percentage of the parliamentary seats . 
  so , regarding proportionality , it 's a much fairer system than fptp . 
  most countries though have a modified form of proportional representaion , for example a lower percentage threshold a party must pass to be eligible to parliamentary seats ( very frequent , greece has a 3 % threshold ) , or extra seats to the first party so it can form a government by its own . 
  * as of 2015 , greece uses a * closed list * system . 
  we can argue that the open list previously helped the most popular and/or with the most screen time mps disproportionately , leaving out more capable mps , but in reality having * some * control over the seat drafts proves to be better . 
  for example , with an open list mps have to actually think what they are voting in the parliament if they want to be re-elected and a closed list gives too much power to the leadership of the party . 
  * this , i do n't really know . 
  * these are handled in party , the electoral system has nothing to do with it . 
  mps going rogue was a frequent occurrence mid crisis , which lead to expulsions from the party and them either resigning from their seats or staying as independents . 
  * this is a matter of opinion . 
  the 3 % threshold exists mainly to prevent parties that bear foreign interests get into parliament . 
  further segmentation of the electorate base has also been argued for preserving the threshold at that level . 
  * there are no parties in favor of the fptp . 
  there are the members of the broader left ( and some smaller parties ) that favor a pure proportional system , and the more conservative members ( on that matter ) that favor a modified proportional system ( like the current ) that can guarantee a powerful government . 
  * yes ( statistically speaking ) . 
  not the technicalities , ofcourse . 
  * negligible . 
  it is n't really enforced . 
  * i believe you must still be 18 to be eligible to vote . 
  other than that i 'm not really sure . 
  young people in general tend to explore alternative parties . 
  if you ask me , the older people are more of a problem since they tend to vote stereotypically like soccer partisans . 
  * one example , i 've already provided is the transition from open list to closed list .
