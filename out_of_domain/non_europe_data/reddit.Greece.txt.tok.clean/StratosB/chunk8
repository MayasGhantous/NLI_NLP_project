  syriza also passed a new electoral law during the summer . 
  for a new electoral law to get passed , it just needs to be voted by the half +1 mps ( 151 ) and it goes into effect on the second following elections ( or the following if it gets 2/3 of the votes ( 200 ) ) . 
  the electoral system is defined by the constitution to be proportional representation , so if another system is to be employed , a constitutional amendment must take place , which is a whole other matter . 
  no referenda though .

  i 'm not really sure the greek people should bare the majority of the blame , but they bare the entirety of the * adaptation * . 
  the `` greek people '' though are not a uniform entity to assume total responsibility .

  greece is a free market . 
  it has no saying on it . 
  greece abides by the rules of the common market of european countries dictated by the eu .

  i think it is failing from day-one , and i am not a `` retarded brainwashed syriza fanboy '' . 
  the same view is shared by plenty prominent world class economists , who are also not `` retarded brainwashed syriza fanboys '' .

  i know mate . 
  but let 's not assume facts and discuss on a false basis . 
  i believe we should first dispel prejudice with hard evidence , and then discuss the serious concerns regarding mass immigrations ( irregular or not ) .

  exactly . 
  what anyone thinks or believes is irrelevant , because we have plenty of economic figures proving that gdp plummeted by 30 % , public debt skyrocketed to over 180 % , unemployement went through the roof over 20 % , imports collapsed , consumption collapsed , private debt went red by 40 % , private assets shrinked by 30 % , etc ( i can do this all day ) . 
  absolutely brilliant success story , i tell ya .

  he was actually teal . 
  direct descendant of \u0395\u039b from alpha centauri , who have bluish hue skin due to slight differences in the diffraction index of the atmosphere of proxima centauri b ( know as nova atlantis in \u0395\u039b ) and proxima centauri 's light spectrum composition . 
  he was also 10 feet tall ( short by \u0395\u039b standards ) .

   agree one hundred percent greece needs to grow up and reform, 
  if you kept only this , it would be somewhat acceptable . 
  all the other are deplorable paternalistic bullshit , mandated as somehow legitimate policies over the shoulders of an entire nation .
