  this is really nice of you to give away such a nice pc op !!!, 
  i 'm in , ca n't pass up this great opportunity for free parts !, 
  no lewding, 
  when you find something cool online but it costs $ 4.99 for the full version, 
  tbh civ is a great game for relationships . 
  my gf and i play civ v every week for the whole night . 
  it 's so fun cooperating and kicking the ai 's ass together !, 
  yea i was testing for iron ions , so i just added small quantities of thiocyanate at a time . 
  you 're welcome to try it out , but i sure would n't !, 
  ssd masterrace, 
  pok\u00e9mon ? 
  i would n't really categorize that as a city building/management game but okay . 
  well that 's what you get for using bing !, 
  do not disrespect the wednesday frog, 
  op sorry about your dented case , if it makes you feel better , i scratched mine while installing the graphics card because apparently there were screws underneath . 
  yea the non window side is bad . 
  to add to that , a few months back i was cleaning and put the thing on it 's side , only to discover i forgot to unscrew the wireless adapter and cracked one of the antena . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af it happens to the best of us . 
  thanks fam , forgot this sub existed lol, 
  yikes , at least nothing was damaged inside, 
  thank you , i laughed my ass off at this . 
  magical ringo powers out to good use lmao, 
  i 'm a simple man , i see greek flag with byzantium and i upvote . 
  so i have a few original editions of beatles albums , but as they are so old and delicate , i almost never play them . 
  i 'd say buy the anniversary edition if you do n't already have a copy . 
  also if you 've been searching for it for a while , the chances of finding an original without scratches is slim . 
  if you have the money , definitely but keep in mind that beatles albums are usually a bit more than other bands . 
  it 's really up to you my dude but i would get them new before investing in original copies . 
  i physically cringed . 
  my god how could someone be that self unaware and awkward ... 
  i see someone is a regular of r/beatles ... 
  `` saudi government allegedly funded a dry run of 9/11 '', 
  those are rookie numbers . 
  ### build help/ready :, 
  ** have you read the sidebar and [ rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules ) ? 
  ( please do ) **, 
  yep !, 
  ** what is your intended use for this build ? 
  the more details the better . 
  mostly gaming , but also planning to use it for some coding and 3d modeling if that makes a difference . 
  ** if gaming , what kind of performance are you looking for ? 
  ( screen resolution , fps , game settings ) **, 
  modest 1080p , of course glorious 60 + fps , game settings anywhere from med to ultra ( if the monitor allows it ) . 
  also , i play lots of strategy games , so fast loading time is definitely a must , though that i7 should cover that . 
  ** what is your budget ( ballpark is okay ) ? 
  $ 1300 - $ 1500 , the lesser the better, 
  ** in what country are you purchasing your parts ? 
  ** post a draft of your potential build here ( specific parts please ) .

  btw this is n't all my parts , just the important ones . 
  ** describe your problem . 
  list any error messages and symptoms . 
  be descriptive . 
  i have an hdmi cord that i as going to use to connect to my monitor to the gpu , but when i do so , i get a `` no signal for a few seconds , then it goes to sleep . 
  the monitor , that is . 
  ** list anything you 've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem . 
  i 've tried using the onboard intel graphics , but that too does not give any display to the monitor . 
  this is probably really bad , is n't it . .
