  how are you going to move your money abroad with the banks closed genius ? 
  ehh you are right .

  well if i save you do i get a freebie ? 
  audio functionality test initialized . 
  designation : constantine xi palaiologos . 
  mission : the liberation of constantinople , greece . '', 
  the games are available also in gog so you are simply wrong . 
  my nigga ? 
  they have legal ways to be paid for their work , while ensuring the quality of what they are selling , going through paradox as a publisher and for q&a . 
  as a ~ ~ costumer ~ ~ customer you should be worried where you give the money you get from * your * work . 
  however you have to factor competition from other tourist areas . 
  turkey is directly competing with greece , particularly because euros are so powerful compared with the turkish coin . 
  airports are not a good indicator because they are monopolizing the flow of tourists through them .

  you question is completely relevant !, 
  there is an option ( just look at your files ) , so the game will pick it . 
  its just a ui bug . 
  so you would be ok if brad pitt or johny depp ( or some other great looking guy ) had relations with a 15 girl ? 
  gender switching is very good on clearing things up . 
  morals change and then the laws . 
  but until then you have to follow them . 
  while i believe sometime the law is interpreted too hard ( jailing an 18 year old because he had relations with a 17 in some states ) generally it is good if you think the alternatives . 
  most is the key word , its totally unreasonable . 
   more childish and entitled, 
  til i learned desperation , depression , foreclosures and the fiscal stability of a whole country f [ or the next 15 years ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed ) is * entitlement * . 
  in germany he will have full payed vacations , maternal leave for women , a proper infrastructure and security and many more social bonuses . 
  i think others are the slaves . 
  budget vs lives trumps lives . 
  here it is people , right in the open for all to see . 
  european ` solidarity '' . 
  the hypocrisy is that when tsipras call out germany for the reparations and debts , with the exact same arguments he was an amoral asshole that steered grudges . 
  but when greece does it , everyone is a fu ** ing technocrat yuppie . 
  and and ignorant one also , because they should know that unless there is a solution , they willnot get any money in the end . 
   food , medical care , schools , soldiers , they all cost money and either you have them or you dont - there is no middle ground . 
  we will not have any if we default . 
  and that 's a fact it will happen unless a viable solution is found . 
   really , as greek citizens , dont you feel ashamed of yourselves ? 
  i am ashamed that the huge bailouts where given from eu taxpayers money only to save private organizations , including the european banks , one of the major causes of this shitstorm , strapping the greek state with even more debt only for it to be presented as a gift . 
  if you have failed to see this , you are doomed and the eu . 
  such a same . 
  they are stealing your money right in front of you and you applause them . 
  not even the russians are that indoctrinated . 
  americans are notoriously orthodox in their views . 
  you are forgeting a lot of pilgrims moved there to get away from what they considering a watering down of religion . 
  i am guessing he is inspired from this [ painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/paul_delaroche_-_ejecuci%c3%b3n_de_lady_jane_grey_%28national_gallery_de_londres,_1834%29.jpg ) with the same subject . 
  the awakenings , i know about them . 
  i just pointed out it existed from the birth of the nation . 
  i do n't think they are so orthodox apart from specific matters . 
  do they they have movements like creationism and stuff like that where they literally interpret the bible ? 
  being religious a lot , is not always sign of orthodoxy . 
  reddit highfive !, 
  yup . 
  actually that sounds more like the no camp . 
   `` pitiful '' , `` meaningless, 
  i like the quotes . 
  apparently you had heating this winter ? 
  if you do n't like it gtfo . 
  sorry i thought you were greek . 
  samaras is the leader of the opposition . 
  so he is essentially [ this .

  take the leap of faith . 
  i read a * lot * for guardian these days . 
  since it is essentially split in the middle between a leftist view but also very very europhile , they ca n't find true balance for its reporting . 
  so you will have extreme articles like this one , we must not also forget ** guardian was the one that published the imf report about the debt ** . 
  from the crazy things i saw in ftimes and other european newspapers , guardian was generally good . 
  generally . 
  source ? 
  and yet here we are . 
  last hope . 
  there where always people like this . 
  macedonians let them pass unimpended ( lol ) . 
  and later spartans used persian gold to build ships to take on athens ( double lol ) . 
  it happens all the time mate . 
  stage 1 : complete, 
  stage 2 : ... 
  the majority of greeks believes that . 
  we do n't want to fight europe , but find the best solution for everyone . 
  ignore the trolls , most are bitter they got thrashed .
