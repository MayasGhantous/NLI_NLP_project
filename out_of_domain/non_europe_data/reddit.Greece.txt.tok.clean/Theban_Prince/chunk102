  [ greek ] everyone believes that , even the creditors . 
  its not a numbers problem , but a political problem . 
  [ greek ] ... offered to a government that had connections with big tax evaders . . 
   as a russian it never ceases to amaze me how many people in europe think that it is a legit news outfit . 
  [ greek ] you should have watched the `` pro-european '' media during the previous week . 
  rt would win pulitzer awards compared to them . 
  this is part of the ` no fiscal union ' problem . 
  there is no central authority to check , plan and implement union wide policies . 
  eu sends money , but it is upon the local governments how they are going to manage them , with disastrous results for greece and its old corrupted elite that pillaged it . 
   truth is that greece , one way or another , brought this to ourselves, 
  [ greek ] ** very ** debatable . 
  for 5 years troika was dealing with the same corrupted elite without flinching ( despite nd proclaiming the exact things syriza is doing now before elections , but forgot when he got elected ) , but when syriza came into power they where outraged , demanding publicly a change of government . 
  [ greek ] absolutely none . 
  the general population knew there was small time evasion and corruption in the government , but the extent of the problem was unknown . 
  well russia is banging europe 's door again ... 
   would they accept a total debt write off and funding in exchange for a military occupation by the eu with the eu now running greece , enforcing tax dodger 's by military force ? 
  from the demonstration they just had highly unlikely :p, 
  [ greek ] yeah if the german military with the greek police arrested the big tax evading sharks , and the politicians that fudged the books to get to the eurozone , it would be the first time in history to be happily received in a country . 
  then we would pay our taxes because we would be scared shitless we will have a panzer checking our income statements . 
  but instead of that , from the greek perspective , you were and are endorsing them . 
  [ greek ] everyone agrees with you , even the creditors . 
  however north european public is so poisoned right now they will never accept a debt restructuring . 
  [ greek ] this was declined by the previous greek government ( s ) who had and has strong ties with the russian-style corrupted magnates . 
  guess why they did n't accept . 
  from syriza i think if they succeeded on getting a debt relief and then come back with 20000 tax agents on the plane , people would be jubilant in the streets . 
   or if they have been swept under the rug by the political class . 
  [ greek ], 
  considering universities were/are also notoriously corrupted ( temps , tenures and research grants are given based on strictly political ideology ) , take a wild guess . 
  the whole game was rigged from the start , an unholy coalition of politicians with a bunch ( 4-6 ) of `` entrepreneurs '' that controlled media , construction companies , football clubs , shipping and any other heavy industries in the country , completely dismantled whatever few checks and balances were left , while the majority of the population was happy the `` eu provides '' . 
  imagine 90 's russia with billions of eu subsidies coming in unchecked . 
  it was a fucking bloodbath . 
  when shit finally hit the fun , only the common citizens lost everything , fair or unfair gains , while that alliance still lived and thrived under a troika that tried to supposedly fix the country cooperating with * them * with flawed financial plans that where structured mostly around saving the euro and placating a poisoned european public . 
  while waving the finger that the people need to be disciplined . 
   and thereby convoluted what at the outset was an economic question . 
  it was n't , it never was , just a economical problem and this is what europe does n't get , and unless it does tomorrow , i think we are done with it . 
  as for tsipras playing the media campaign , he did n't dig up the two forgotten past prime ministers that fucked the country up and * one of whom actually signed the swaps with goldman sachs * , and presented them in bombarding television ads urging us to ` say yes to europe ! '' . 
  it was fucking pathetic . 
  people discuss a lot that the ` yes ' shenanigans gave a solid 10-20 % to the ` no ' themselves . 
  fake squids dude . 
  eu official made a lot of overt remarks , particularly the last days . 
  schultz was decried today in the eu parliament by leftists and greens for his comments . 
   that 's weird, 
  welcome to troika policies , greece 2015 . 
  they accepted the closure of almost all tax agencies offices in the country further gutting the already half-dead , overloaded system . 
  because public workers are bad okay ? 
   the deeper problem ( sadly ) is that in many eyes , the greek govt lacks credibility . 
  yes , there is a different government , but there have been many different governments since the 90s and not much fixed . 
  actually there was only one , pasok with very brief breaks when it was under nd . 
  both utterly corrupted and only lost power to syriza this january . 
  you will never teach dogmeat to not cross force fields , so just give up on him . 
  see the [ shame ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-02/eu-parliament-president-tells-greecetime-another-puppet-government ) with yourself . 
  this was during the previous week , but more covert remarks were made the last six months . 
  this is * the european parliament president about a sovereign nations government * . 
  imagine if these remarks were about the french , spanish or german governments . 
   if only you could create some kind of agency , that is ** independent ** , and tasked with collecting taxed, 
  this is the problem . 
  the officers where appointed based of their political affiliations , with obvious corruption . 
  this did n't change at all in the last 5 years , and i did n't see troika denying a esfs extension trying to enforce their will , despite doing it for multiple reason\u03c3 in the past . 
  only demanding public workers let off , inducing a lot of tax agents . 
   as always , the institutions wanted results , not specific actions . 
  considering they ` corrected ' the greek proposal with red ink like a teacher does to a children 's essay , i will say you must not have an idea what is really going on . 
  you cant imagine how much . 
  greek media used it to grow distrust towards the eu . 
   we do not need to give you our money , you can come up with proposals all you like , if you pay for them yourself . 
  so now you can dictate whatever you want ? 
  decide please kthx, 
   go be poor somewhere else ... 
  well we will probably go to putin i guess . 
  it will be really nice to have russian frigates and missiles systems in the adriatic , close to rome and a spitting distance from berlin and benelux . 
  or why not have a refueling base for the russian fleet who wants to project power in the eastern mediterranean sea ? 
  maybe it will be even more fun to use those euro presses to create a few billions of ` greek ' euros to mess with the currency just for some shits and giggles . 
  wait , i just heard a new greek [ airline ] ( http://ru.ellinair.com/ ) opened in greece where stewardess need to speak english and * russian * along with their booking website . 
  i cant guess * why * . 
   yeah , you should learn how to speak russian , and you will learn what it means to disappoint uncle vladimir . 
  well since frau merkel led us to [ this ] ( http://www.grreporter.info/en/humanitarian_crisis_greece_deepening_medecins_du_monde_warning/5337 ) what can it be worse ? 
  i mean there are already people dying or about to die here , what worse can he do ? 
   you can not print or issue new euros , because nobody trusted you to begin with, 
  [ oh we can ] ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/article51289.html ) , we have some nice presses right here ready to get pumping . 
   if you do not like the eu or imf to come to your country and tell you what to do , you will love the `` little green men '' russia sends . 
  meh probably not , but we will have great fun eating popcorn by the sideline as eu is unraveling like the inflated bag it is . 
   but you will find out when you try to do it , just like your government found out what happens . . 
  we are already having a blast with it . 
  [ they ] ( http://www.cityam.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_article_body_image/public/main/articles/tsipras-putin-april-2015-1024x640.jpg?itok=6f_-i5bx ) certaintly do . 
  [ greek ] no , every country has its own tax and all other agencies , so we cant use a common acronym ( this is one of the reasons we are at this mess by the way ) . 
  i use irs because tsipras want to create a new agency modeled after that , since the one taht exists now is marred with inefficiency , and bound to each finmin , meaning political appointments -  corruption . 
  the eu hilariously did not allowed him to do so while screaming ` thieves '' . 
   but irrational plans have never stopped the greeks , eh ? 
  some have noticed a big delivery of ink and paper from canada , months ago . 
  they probably been printing since january . 
  with the instability that exists now , it could crumble everything . 
  buy bye germany , russia did it again !, 
   nobody will care . 
  [ uncle putin ] ( http://photos.vanityfair.com/2015/01/29/54cab4dfb8f23e3a03152aef_image.jpg ) does . 
   and the eu is pretty safe from the greek mess , so you can have a blast with your 50 $ a day while the rest of europe continues with normal life, 
  ohhh is that reassurance ? 
  everything okay over there , [ i am sure ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/why-does-merkel-look-so-tired-pics/ ) ... 
   and then you will still be poor . 
  glorious russian [ gas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgas%e2%80%93alexandroupoli_pipeline ), 
  and [ moneys ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/?s=russian+tourists ) are already pouring in . 
  ohh you would look at [ that ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-military-agreement-in-cyprus-2015-2 ) , rumors about a russian base in a eu member . .
