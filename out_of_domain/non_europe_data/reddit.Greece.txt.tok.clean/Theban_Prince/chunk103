  i wonder who that country really is ... 
  you know what , i hope the eu will become a real state , so their history books will always write how they lost 131,957 km2 of europe and its 10th founding member , without firing a single shot , mostly because they where arrogant , well-pampered pricks . 
  talk about national shame . 
  yup . 
  this . 
  its hilarious seeing finnish/scandinavian reservation and glumness colliding with extreme greek flamboyancy and crazy . 
  also maybe a good indicator why we cant find a solution to our problems . 
  that is the most funny thing i have seen the last months !!, 
  do you know the term [ village idiot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/village_idiot ) ? 
  well she is that , on a country level . 
   the army would be better served if conscripts only stayed for 1 or 2 months of training real training . 
  weapons , etc. 
  and then left . 
  all the ` jobs ' conscripts do in the army is bullshit with no usefulness whatsoever . 
  i concur with your proposals . 
  i would n't mind a short term service structured around guerrilla warfare and survival . 
  learning to march in unison for three weeks like it is the 1917 is stupid in modern warfare . 
  dude , we are complaining that the rest of europeans are ignoring our viewpoint . 
  do n't be an ass when one of them chooses to come over here and spent time to listen . 
  if he was sure , he would n't ask at all . 
  sources ? 
  in the 17th image you forgot courier from f : new vegas . 
  edit : also great post !, 
  if you think this is about the eurogroup or some loans anymore , you are confusing what is happening . 
  the real proposal will be presented to the nations leaders . 
  the video clips definitely looked like the old westwood fmv in red alert . 
  particularly in the 9:00 mark . 
  thats their selfcreated problem that stems from failed diplomatic , political and financial decisions that left no space for movement . 
  they will get eaten alive by their electorate . 
  podemos is 50 % -50 % with the government in the polls for the first time . 
  italy is asking for a marshal plan towards greece ( very loaded name ),

  i expect him to get permission to establish it , but with north european advisers included in its management . 
  good . 
  a lot od debts are actually the ` bailouts ' . 
  example are the imf we just defaulted , and we want restructured . 
  there is austerity , and then there is austerity . 
  its not a magical word that fixes everything . 
  killing the hotel industry was outright stupid , and good for tsipras to draw the line . 
  because i dont know about euro or not , if we lose the tourism we are dead , in or out . 
  fuck eu if this happens . 
  it was an ultimatum for political reasons and everyone lost control after that . 
  1974 called , it says there is always room for a `` peace operation '' between nato friends . 
  ... [ zip ] ( https://youtu.be/18wqxc3xmmy?t=1m48s ), 
  yep . 
  they are blocking anything because tsipras is from far left and made quite a ruckus . 
  he accepted 95 % of troikas proposals before the referandum , and 99 % after he proclaimed it . 
  wake up and call your goverment now before this turns into disaster of epic proportions . 
  even the us is openly taking a position right now . 
  if russia does indeed helps greece in a grexit we are both fucked . 
  pretty much . 
  truth right here boys . 
  hear hear !,

  an american called them out precisely on this . 
  you have n't seen so many down votes for years . 
  ( by the way sorry for fighting with you in / r/europe the previous months ), 
  i believe it will be a pause and/or extension , so no more huge loans , expect a minimal required for the immediate survival to repair the recent damage . 
  however even this may not pass . 
  this is turning to a new / r/cringe ... 
  `` but the euro is stronk and dumping your most unstable member will be good for it '' ... until another member has issues in 10-20 years when the market turns into recession again . 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  and even the eu might be too weak right now . 
  china and any consequences worries me a lot . 
  i have no idea how some global politicians continue to plan for only 2 years ahead . 
   theban_prince is leading a coalition against / u/arathian . 
  my father has one and he is alive . 
  its about deaths * and * injuries in car crashes . 
  considering they are pretty robust so they do n't deteriorate so fast , its not that impressive they are so common . 
  about the restaurant harassment by the ` sellers ' in front of them , that happens only in major tourism areas , ( like plaka ) . 
  if you see it anywhere else in your travels , avoid like plague . 
  please you and any other get informed before coming here and lecture . 
  tsipras has asked for army cuts . 
  yeahh . 
  tsipras ( supposedly ) dumped him on creditors request . 
  what did you expect ? 
  smart man mason . 
  well that was dumb . 
   since many shops refuse ( which is illegal ) . 
  um that 's false . 
  banks do n't issue credit card machines unless you have sufficient transactions . 
  since credit/debit cards are not really commonplace yet , a lot of shops really do n't have that option . 
  he is the local insane troll . 
  we keep him around as a pet . 
  while a finnish death metal was playing a ` rains of castamere ' [ cover ] ( https://youtu.be/f2x6uvllude?t=1m22s ) in the background . 
  they are making us a favor . 
  nokia and the russian sanctions that hit the lumber industry hard . 
  `` but but , austerity is working !, 
  you will all become little germanies soon enough !, 
  um it was ? 
  greece wanted to rise the income tax of the real wealthy ( 500k + ) but the creditors blocked it ... 
  beats me . 
  nothing makes sense anymore .
