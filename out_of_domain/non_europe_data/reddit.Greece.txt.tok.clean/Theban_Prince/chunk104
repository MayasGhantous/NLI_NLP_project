  over 20 years !, 
  oh my god !, 
  it is * definitely * this game but it was in yellow/black , do n't know why . 
  possibly different version . 
  thank you !, 
  one of the oldest brain inches of me . 
   dragon quest vi, 
  i think it might be part of the dragon quest series , but i am not sure . 
  definitely 2d sprite thu. 
  ding ding ding we have a [ winne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgptldt-zsy ) r !!, 
  your reply is the usual inane `` dont scare the poor capitalists away '' do have * any * idea what level are the taxes in n.europe ? 
  market doesnt work like that unless you are a highschool libertarian . 
  i dont know what you ar talking about , but they wanted to rise the tax from 2.2 % ( same as the 50k bracket ) to 4-6 % . 
  i think you dont know what i am talking about . 
  and belgium has a 33 % corporate tax . 
   rise the income tax of the ** real wealthy **, 
  it was for personal income . 
  and then you got * me * confused . 
  but the proposal i was talking about was about personal income . 
  one common antisemitic rhetoric was that jews lived by taking advantage of the pure europeans . 
  i have heard this a lot about greeks . 
  i think the major collapse of center left in almost all europes is one of the roots of our problems . 
  as a fellow federalist , the core of the issue is that we do n't have enough centralization . 
  when fiscal policies are negotiated as treaties between nations and parliaments ( where there can be an ` aggressor ' and a ` defender ' designated by politicians to use for internal consumption ) these things are to be expected . 
  we either have to move backwards ( dissolution of the eurozone , keep eu as a free trade zone ) or forwards ( cede total fiscal policy to a central authority ) . 
  it happened , but it did n't end well ... 
  can confirm , freddo is distinctly greek . 
   i think they should just further abstract it to where you pay for a `` transport capacity '', 
  this is how it was done in ck1 . 
  not only they are shit ( economy wise ) the balkans are moving towards eu full speed ahead . 
  the only one left is turkey . . 
  the movie takes place during the 40s dude . 
  it is a problem with the localization file , there are ways around it . 
  the original ending is a cliffhanger , so i preferred the movies, 
  um he respected cities that surrendered to him instantly . 
  if they put up a fight he would burn them to the ground like it happened in thebes and tyre . 
  it was a common strategy throughout history ( the mongols also used it ) . 
   my co worker has also said no one ever pays the said amount . 
  if you do they will look at you weird . 
  haggling is very rare expect in flea markets like monastiraki . 
  everywhere else ( restaurants , clothes shops etc ) the amount is usually the one you have to pay . 
  ask for official receipts please !, 
  it could have been better . 
  the whole story was a bit of ` meh ' . 
  * paging x-com . 
  ehh no . 
  the `` stereotypes '' are appropriate for the time and place as far as i remember . 
  it just the story was kinda boring with shallow characters . 
   macedonians to be greeks , they considered them to be slavic . 
  yes but do you consider native americans as irish immigrants ? 
  because this is what he is saying . 
  and now you are going to link me one of the rare sources that said so , demosthenes and his colleagues , staunch rivals of the macedonians who where trying to slander them for political reasons . 
  next thing you know , we will take stalinist propaganda at face value . 
  i suggest you realize that spaceships ! = fantasy scifi . 
  as a greek , i had the luck to experience this in [ more ] ( http://www.oneman.gr/gynaikes/hall_of_femme/article2023173.ece/binary/w620/vana_barba_.jpg ) [ situations ] ( http://www.oneman.gr/gynaikes/hall_of_femme/article2023171.ece/binary/w620/vana_barba_2.jpg ) [ than ] ( http://www.oneman.gr/gynaikes/hall_of_femme/article2023177.ece/binary/w620/barba.jpg ) just one movie . 
  so i could be more impartial . 
  i think they are very very cheap to produce ( especially those that are close to the big brother format vs survivor ) compared to profit . 
  i believe it was just a fad . 
  seeing women as delicate gentle flowers that need the males !, 
  attention and care to be complete and safe is not exactly egalitarian . . 
  because they are good at it . 
  of course its not a fraud unless the money are undeclared in your tax statement . 
  * that * is the major problem with money moving abroad since it is difficult for the tax agency to access banks of a foreign nation to check your account . 
  they did n't surrender to the romans , because there was n't a central authority to do so , and romans fought both with epirus , macedonia and other city states until they destroyed a good portion of them ( like corinth ) . 
  other city states allied with them against their local enemies , until they found themselves losing more and more power towards their roman `` allies '' until they where essentially puppet states and/or annexed . . and i am sure greeks did n't willingly surrended to the ottomans . 
  you are forgetting the part where the allies essential dropped support towards the greek army because they voted against their interests , and some even helped ataturk to arm its army . 
  not that this absolves the idiocy that was the greek anatolian campaign , but there are more in to the story than that . 
  you where making assumption based on an interpretation of the law . 
  however since the law is not like that , your argument ca n't stand . 
  a better argument is why the law is not exercised as it should , but thats something quite different . . 
  or you know , the easiest reply to the fermi paradox , we are like a small undiscovered tribe in the middle of the amazon that have only explored the few hundred miles around them and declared they are the only humans on the planet . 
   and it would take around 1 million years to completely explore the milk way and setup satellites and stuff in each star system, 
  by what measure did you reached this conclusion ? 
  um hypatia was killed because of her supposed political ties with orestes , a christian himself . 
  not just because she was a woman with knowledge . 
  indoor heating and plumbing was available since the late antiquity . 
  romans had floor heating for gods shake !, 
  `` dark ages '' is also a discredited term by most historians . 
  while some parts of europe suffered from wars and plagues , in other places like asia or the middle east `` civilization '' pretty much kept going . 
  the eastern roman empire stood strong for at least another 600 years building things like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hagia_sophia ) . 
  the [ islamic golden age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_golden_age ) is also a high mark of that time . 
  you have a very romanticized view of history . 
   the collapse of the roman empire is associated with decreased population , increased mobility , and declines in settlement . 
  this collapse did n't cause those , the empire collapsed * because * of that reasons . 
  its the other way around . 
  the empire was weakened due to gross mismanagement and frequent civil wars , that caused depopulation , diseases and disruption of the culture from the immigration waves that used the unguarded borders ( since the legions where undermanned or away to fight for the civil wars , as it happened in britain ) that started a death spiral of the old centralized empire in the west . 
  and even then it kept going pretty strong in the eastern part for centuries unabated with the same relative standard of living ( constantinople had * 500.000 * residents at 540 ) . 
  only the western part `` suffered '' and at best for a couple of centuries . 
  if you consider the `` world '' france , britain , spain and italy , then yes you can claim that there was a `` global dark age '' . 
  but no one takes it seriously . 
  seriously . 
  space is fucking [ huge ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/nasa-hs201427a-hubbleultradeepfield2014-20140603.jpg/657px-nasa-hs201427a-hubbleultradeepfield2014-20140603.jpg ) ( those are not stars , but * galaxies * ) . 
  saying extraterrestrial life does n't exist simply because * we * have n't seen any so far is anthropocentric and frankly , inane . . 
  that is simply great . 
  a ) radio signals dissipate in very short distances outside the solar system , now imagine in a galaxy or or a galaxy * cluster . * . 
  the time of the existence of a civilization does n't equal stable and linear progressions in its `` expansion '' . 
  wars , famine , splintering , religion , culture can cause various reasons for a curb in the spread , such as expansion in a localized way ( tall ) vs spreading ( long ) . 
  and that totally ignores that we simply do n't have the necessary technology to detect anything ** yet ** . 
  we might be like that tribe without a tv receiver . 
   once a species becomes interstellar , there is almost nothing that can stop it .
