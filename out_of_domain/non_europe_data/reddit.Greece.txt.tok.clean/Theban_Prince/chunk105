  from there , they would continue to spread exponentially . 
  this is entirely speculation . 
  you are ascribing animal drives , ( growth and expansion is inevitable ) to probable civilizations we have no idea what culture or history they have . 
  or that the technology they use is simply undetectable from us with our present instruments . 
  or that by chance of luck we simply have n't see them because space is big and it has n't uniform distribution of the necessary conditions for galaxy spanning civilizations . 
  in general we know * so * little yet , that thought experiments like the fermi paradox are ignorant at the present age . 
  the `` soot bomb '' could be dark or black colored gmed algae ? 
  however , with gmed ~ ~ algae ~ ~ lichen you can clean up a lot easier afterwards . 
  just make them unable to survive past a certain temperature , and you have a self regulating heating system plus a base to build a more complex eco system . 
  graphite and real soot will require huge amounts of energy to clean and/or move if it is required in the future and they have no further uses . 
   since they said thor 's rep was already there but let him in anyway . 
  but durkon is not invited anyway . 
  it makes sense to have a thor rep there instead of him . 
  he is there to get resurrected , not to attend the meeting . 
  however , whispering inside the * circle of truth * . . really roy ? 
  / u/rskyhawk172 states there is a limit to the debris allowed , so there is n't any gameplay reasons to limit your debris , only roleplaying . 
  / u/brickmack reminds that you can * turn off * the debris * limit * ( * all * debris stay ) , so you can have gameplay * and * role playing reasons . . 
  since i guess this is heretical angron , does n't that mean his nobility is minimized ( if not extinguished ) while his rage amplified ? 
  i thought daemonic corruption ( particularly ties with khorne ) worked like that . 
  i thinking post-herecy ( as it was in istvaan 3 ) he would lose any sense of nobility in * any * situation . 
  he was prone to rage even before ` falling ' , but what i am asking is that after turning to the ruinous powers he would lose any ` good ' aspects of his character . 
  well , shit . 
   in addition to this , they had already decimated a huge chunk of '' `` europe 's '' army . 
  there was never a `` european '' army to decimate . 
  sources ? 
  any specific battle where the armies where under unified command ? 
  so wait , the destruction of a disorganized and fractious hungarian host ( that even came close to winning ) is considered `` decimation of the * european * armies ? 
  creepy = / = shitty, 
  its obviously a sculpture . 
  its art potential is subjective of course , but from a mechanical standpoint its not shitty . 
  for an art sculpture that puts ( creepy ) aesthetics over efficiency , i can live with that . 
  you can see purpose built robots in this sub failing spectacularly . 
  low performance in a specific area is a farcry from tumbling and flopping like a suffocating fish . 
  ehh hoi+eu+ck are their flagship titles so they would be more reluctant to do so than a new ip like runemaster . 
  imagine if blizzard canceled legacy of the void after it was announced . 
   [ 1000mods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7zxgbj8c0c ), 
  technically he is correct . 
  the metric system was created during the french revolution . 
  one significant part of the revolution was the paris ... ** commune ** ( * dun dun dun !, 
  this is one of the best i have seen for a long time . 
  can we get a sense of scale ? 
  and for some reason i have the urge to dig up and play [ warlords 2 ... ] ( http://www.freegameempire.com/img/cache/games/warlords-2-deluxe/screenshot-4.png ), 
  putting the luna back into the lunatic . 
  your answer about the eagles is the one you have in your flair ? 
  i think we should consider the first 18 years the trial period . 
  on adulthood , a police officer will come , put a gun in your head and ask `` do you wish to continue , yes or no ? '' . 
  mah liberty achieved !, 
  however your theory does n't hold truth because the eagles helped both in the battle of the five armies and saving gandalf from orthanc . 
  and gandalf and the rest of the mages are maia send to middle earth with the single support the wart against evil . 
  the real * reason * is that unless the valar themselves directly interfere/fight sauron , after the last alliance no power existed strong enough to enter mordor by open force . 
  the whole point of him choosing the hobbits , walking by land , crossing through moria whats secrecy and subterfuge to confuse sauron , and this was repeated again and again in the books ( they hunted gollum for years because he knew too much ) . 
  using the eagles to get close to barad-dur with so many spies around middle-earth would be a death sentence , and would expose the real intentions of gandalf , to destroy the ring in mordor , instead of using it ( as sauron presumed ) to boost minas tirith . 
  remember that frodo and sam probably accomplished what they had to do because they ditched everyone else and managed to pass undetected . 
  i am guessing they are minimizing the time at sea because of costs . 
  as far as i know , personnel must be on a ` seaworthy ' position ( serving on an active ship vs a land installation ) for a certain percentage of years dependable on their specialty . 
  maybe they changed that ? 
   to * bee * bothered by it, 
  fading will create issues when you are inside the house and part of it is faded due to zombies directly outside that can cause you issues on walking around . 
  from what i gather , its not only ops fault . 
  the model has a head like she is the sister of [ sloth ] ( http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2010/4/7/96598_md-celestine,%20celestine%20the%20living%20saint,%20sisters%20of%20battle,%20witch%20hunters.jpg ) . 
   just like mojang is doing with minecraft, 
  and squad with ksp . 
  `` i did n't think this through ( about becoming prime minister ) '' is the underlying message . 
  particularly the one with dogs next to them . 
  they are sweet pet lovers that want to help you !, 
  [ eagle released !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/bhitpttg888?t=5s ), 
  a couple of weeks ago one of them got killed when the taser did n't connect and he attacked the police officer . 
  such a shame . . 
  i think elected is the operative word here ? 
  he is elected to as a vp not as president so technically this is not covered here . 
  what makes you think he even * has * a license ? 
  ehh it felt like an episode from the twilight zone . 
  i love scifi and post - apocalyptic , but i gave up after a couple of episodes . 
  too much walking dead vibes, 
  `` ohhh my clearly brainwashed brother is there along with 2 giant battle robots , you are a coward father for not wanting to save him!i want to go alone ! '' . 
  maybe it gets better ? 
  killing a lion was not the end of the world , but sometimes individual cases can be the focus point for the big underlying issues . 
  compare with rosa parks that was the catalyst about the civil right movement . 
  if you discuss that incident individually , a woman simply moving to a different seat in the bus is insignificant . 
  however her case was just a focus for the discussion and struggle about the overreaching major problems that effected millions of people , for serious issues like education , work , basic human rights etc. 
  cecil is simply the symbol of the ongoing debate about the unnecessary damage to the environment , the state of africa post colonialism , the complacency of the west that it has fixed its imperialistic tendencies and many more . 
  you can agree or disagree about those parts , but to counteract our argument , the shitstorm did n't start simply because cecil was a cute critter . 
  the issues were there , just the lion was one high profile case . 
  you can discuss how the majority of the public sometimes need a symbol like cecil to rally behind it , but this is how human nature and society works . 
  relevant username . 
  gut wrenching lines that ring true to a lot of people . 
  then they dismember blue blooded alien clone robots while drunk in an english pub . 
  superb . 
  the protagonist from casablanca had a fiery relationship with the leading lady . 
  for reasons ( spoilers ! ), 
  they separate and a few years later they meet again in casablanca and rekindle their romance , but the previous reasons still exist and create issues . 
  the protagonist acknowledges , that but says to her `` we 'll always have paris '' . 
  i have heard they got bootlegged copies in the black market before the fall of the iron curtain . . 
  edit : have you read so many idiotic comments around here that this ** ( / s ) ** is obligatory ? 
  really ? 
  the thing is , this will never end . 
  even if we lived long enough to experienced these things then something else would come along to wait for . 
  imagine if we where in the 80 's and we discussed about portable phones and affordable personal computers . 
  progress never ends and eventually you are going to miss stuff .
