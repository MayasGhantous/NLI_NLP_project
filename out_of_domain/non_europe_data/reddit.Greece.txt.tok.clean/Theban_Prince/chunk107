  go to black flag expecting a great pirate game with some ac elements in and you will have a blast . 
  go expecting an ac game with pirate elements and you will be disappointed . 
  cwuster or ava ? 
  well the consequences in real life of incompatibility between people is more difficult to handle than online . 
  the same digital wall that protects trolls , harassers and conmen on the other hand allows you to maybe try and come in contact with people that you usually would n't . 
  and he delivers !, 
  it is nice to have a follow up of what happened . 
  good to know that from some random comment to people can have a great time . 
  to use another analogy from football , you are claiming that because a referee did n't notice an offside ( that did n't led to a goal anyways ) next time a team can bring 12 players and nobody will notice ? 
  hyperbole much ? 
   palais justice, 
  the buildings in the photos are not the same as those you [ see ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@50.8380508,4.3520955,3a,75y,337.48h,77.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s69lxghz85dlujcbyfgmk-w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) in direct line from there to atomium . 
  so i am guessing not . 
  yep that seems more likely . 
  the whole `` scavenge material from toy cars to real cars to build a settlement '' is a direct copy paste from [ this ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/36922/ ? ), 
  the modular power armor is another one . 
  i just hope the modders get at * least * a credits mention to put on their resumes . 
  i know that . 
  however a icredit mention like `` inspired by '' or any other , no stings attached , legal way to mention a modder would be respectable . 
  at least the guys can use it on their portfolios . 
  i told that dawg oedipus to not trust the stuff pindar gives out . 
  they are too strong for him , but no , '' he is the baddest dude in thebes '' , and now he talks with lions that have human heads asking shitty riddles and shit . 
  and even worse when he is trippin ' he cant keep his dick in his pants . 
  one of these days he will do something that he will regret . 
  he could control the lightsaber with his mind . 
  that would be awesome , and a light saber fight and a nod the ot where luke does it in the wampa cave , albeit limited because he is not in the same level . 
  this submission gets the / r/insidejorahshead 's seal of approval !, 
  when school starts in america ? 
  oh come on , so far star wars looks pretty good , as is the marvel universe . 
  disney is a huge conglomerate that has produced a lot of ` adult ' films under the touchstone brand . 
  its simply ignorant disney = gon na stamp mickey everywhere . 
  just saved ( ? ), 
  a dead horse from getting yet another beating . . 
  this is actually the main reason . 
  countries are building huge infrastructure mega projects that are used for just one month and then discarded . 
  having the olympics in one place mitigates that since it would be reused again and again ( and possible attract other big sports venues between the olympics since the infrastructure can be used interchangeably ) . 
  align orbits ( using ascending or descending nodes ) . 
  burn prograde or retrograde until your orbit gets a flyby  5km . 
  keep burning pro or retro to refine the flyby distance as closer as possible . 
  when you reach that point start burning to equalize the relative speed between vessels to zero ( set the opposing vessel as target from the map ) . 
  now use your rcs to aproach to the other vessel and dock . 
  what people find hard to realize is that you have to essential find ( or more realistically , create ) an intersecting point where the vessels are as close as possible and at * that * point you have to synchronize the orbits by slowing down or going faster . 
  like the gta : sa train mission with big smoke , you have to find the sweetspot in speed between to moving vessels . 
  nah do n't worry they are building their own dedicated [ theme park in spain . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20141218/spain-to-get-worlds-only-smurf-theme-park ), 
  so if we see a photo of michael jordan , johny depp or madonna nobody is going to comment on their careers or make jokes about them ? 
  neither am i. 
  if the prequel trilogy did not exist , the bar would be too high . 
  now , after emo vader , jar jar , racist caricature aliens and the wreck of political thriller smashed up with slapstick comedy , i think i will at least enjoy the new movies . 
  you know he is n't doing anything exceptional right ? 
  he is shooting those arrows on man-sized targets from 1-3 meters away ( 3ft-9ft ) . 
  it would be surprising if he * missed * . 
  there is a debunking of him from a pro archer floating about . 
  look it up . 
  the see though part is not as transparent as you think without the bright camera flashes . 
  i never said said he claimed he was a pro archer . 
  i claimed that what he does is not remarkable . 
  at all . 
  from 6ft i had a bullseye with my third arrow the * first * time i got my hands on a bow . 
  in 10 years i should be able to compete at least in a local level . 
  as an archer in combat , if you have to shoot so close you already are dead . 
  typical battle ranges where at hundreds of meters depending of the type of bow and the archer . 
  so he has a bit of showmanship and a video editor . 
  thats a bard right there . 
  half way down , its a liberals wet dream . 
  after the midpoint , he wants the state to perform colonoscopy to anyone deemed dangerous in any way . 
  who the fuck gave him gold , because none of the usual suspects apply to this . 
  when i hear or read the term `` gamers '' as a specific title for a certain counter-culture , ignoring the millions of others who partake in this activity yet they do n't fit the stereotypical caricature i cringe so fucking much . 
  i think the most realistic right now and feasible would be auto generated bases and outposts with auto defenses , like the npc ships we already have , with a lot of goodies in them . 
  maybe the npc ships spawn from certain planets with outposts ( mining ships from mining oupost planets ) and move towards certain other planets based on type . 
  so you can either raid the npc ships , but will get a small bit of the loot , or you can attempt a surface assault , but this will require more planning because the bases will be very heavily defended and you will not be able to attack with huge ships due to gravity , but the loot will also be way way better . 
  bonus points if the engine can handle surface to orbit warfare and vice versa . 
  have npc small outposts with aa defences defending the bigger bases , who can shoot your ships , with a lot of power but slow ( or only target over a certain mass ) . 
  so you can use a light raider/blockade runner to attack the outpost and bypass those defences ( with limited inventory for loot ) , or bring a heavy battleship to pound them into glass from orbit . 
  her though process does n't make sense in any level . 
  even if the falcon was not tamed but wild , she would have attacked a bird that simply did what was natural for it . 
  or does she think only bad humies kill and eat other animals ? 
  in conclusion , there is absolutely no case where her actions make any sense at all . 
  in your same thought process , [ c-3po and r2-d2 had visited ancient egypt and interacted with the inhabitants or waldo was killed in pre-colombian america and got thrown in a mass grave by the mayans ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/easter-eggs-movies_n_5985844.html ) . 
  they are called easter eggs . 
  nobody takes them seriously unless they take an active role in the script . 
  the last stand of thermopylae was 300 spartans , 700 thespians and 400 thebans , and helots * may or may not * participated . 
  the most `` heroic '' sacrifice is not that of the spartans , but of the thespians , who where the entire military force that city could muster , yet it sacrificed it so the rest of the army could withdraw . 
  for pop reference , from the movie 300 , thespians are those greeks the spartans belittle for not being professional warriors when they first meet on their way to thermopylae . 
  how ironic . 
  and yet they had a society that mostly compares with modern day n.korea . 
  militaristic , strict , no freedom of movement , immense xenophobia , stale by design , and ultimately weak , that only got saved from athens due to [ the plague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plague_of_athens ) and ironically , [ tons of persian gold to build a decent navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spartan_army#spartan_navy ) that allowed them to achieve the decisive victories in [ sicily ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_expedition ) and [ aegospotami ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aegospotami ) . 
  and then the thebans [ fucked them over in their own game ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_leuctra ) . 
  by the times the romans had fully conquered greece , [ sparta had turned into a theme park a la disneyland , where wealthy romans could visit to witness imitations of the agoge and the old spartan customs . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_sparta#2nd_century_bc ), 
  it not as ironic as you think if your read how pederasty worked in ancient greece . 
  teenage boys where not considered fully male , and since adult men had the responsibility of teaching them everything from sex ( not love ) to war , it was ok to , ehm , have their way with them as active partners . 
  however , having erotic * feelings * for another male or hell , if they took a passive role in the relationship , it was very very looked down upon and considered a disgrace . 
  that is the core of the accusation leonidas uses based on this context . 
  the focus of the slur is not on the ` boys ' part but on the ` lovers ' part . 
  see my [ other ] ( https://en.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3hxoih/til_only_two_groups_of_people_in_sparta_could/cubrjdw ) comment about that . 
  suddenly , warheads !, 
  considering the spartans and greeks in general influenced the romans , and in effect a huge part of `` western society '' , that `` retarded civilization '' forms the roots of the one you have now . 
  lycurgus , the spartan statesman that created the core of what we consider the stereotypical sparta , is one of the very old law scribes a lot of states copied from in later centuries . 
  modern military regiments either by design or by accident follow a large part of the spartan agoge to the letter .
