  do n't get me started on the athenians and their ( sometimes idolized ) democracy . 
  he does not contradict what i say , he just points and provides further context . 
  of course the line was hypocritical , and that makes it even * more * funny for those who know how greeks usually dealt with their political rivals . 
  political slander and propaganda was really really common at the time , probably at the level ( or worse ) that we have now . 
  [ alcibiades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcibiades#sicilian_expedition ) for example was ( probably ) wrongly accused for destroying religious symbols , and he was tried in what even then was considered a kangaroo court ( unsurprisingly , he never attended his trial , but escaped in transit ) . 
  [ phidias and aspasia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phidias ) where accused for improper conduct ( a conveniently nebulous accusation ) from enemies of pericles . 
  phidias died in prison . 
  since the greeks took great pride on the prestige of their progenitors , the slur `` barbarian '' was flying all around trying to discredit political opponents , most infamously with alexander the great , who was accused as such by [ demosthenes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demosthenes#first_philippic_and_the_olynthiacs_.28351.e2.80.93349.c2.a0bc.29 ) of athens , an orator/demagogue who tried to rile the athenians into opposing the macedonians . 
  `` sycophant '' is also a greek word . 
  no north korea is militaristic , strict , with no freedom of movement , immense xenophobia , stale by design , and ultimately weak . 
  yeah i got it . 
  just hammering the point home given the chance . 
  i was discussing semantics , ( that the burden was in the * lovers * part not in the * boys * part ) he was discussing context . 
  from the rest of the novel , if you ignore some modern graphic elements , he has really captured the greek style of storytelling and obviously , exaggeration and pure ` propaganda ' of certain elements , including battle prowess , manliness , greeks vs barbarians etc. 
  so maybe even accidentally because he presented the general feeling so well , he got the line correct in multiple levels . 
  he is not contradicting neither validating my view , so who knows . 
  another word that provides a better example how hypocritical greeks where in their politics was ( \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03b9\u03b6\u03c9 ) midiso , witch means `` working with the persians '' , witch was so common slur to throw around towards persons , families or even whole cities that became a verb meaning traitor in general . 
  the hilarious part is that almost every single city worked with the persians at one point or the other , and mind you , quite overt . 
  so like the `` boy lovers '' , `` midiso '' was again an activity that almost everyone took part into it but still was used for slundering your opponents . 
   i 'm not sure what you 're getting at with this one ? 
  that the ancient greeks , along with `` hypocricy '' they also left us with the `` sycophant '' ( in its more original , political meaning ) , and other nice words describing the truth being twisted or even diregarded , usually for political reasons . 
  true , and if germany had survived and was allowed to continue its social and , more importantly , technological stagnation it would either had to relax its style or get left behind eventually . 
  well the american culture is a mix of greek/roman democracy and ideals with a * lot * of biblical influence ( with a good mix of humanism to create some schizophrenia in an entire nation ) so i hope you are not from there . 
  that sounds pretty the typical first weeks and couple of months of a major online release to be honest . 
  there are even dedicated online games in the pc that fix things up months later . 
  i am not saying that 's ok in all situations , but its not simply because it is a port . 
  no , but considering eggs atrocious because you do n't like one aspect of them yet your entire diet consists of them in any form sounds kinda hypocritical . 
  the aspects you hated were n't exclusive part of the spartans , but almost the entire greco-roman world for thousands of years . 
  further , pederasty as we classify now ( sexual relations with a minor ) was really common up to the industrial revolution . 
  it difficult to let it go the issue you applying modern morals , a human subjective construct , on cultures and civilizations you possibly cant even understand . 
  but i guess i will get over it because it is a glaring example of lack of education . 
   their influence on athens ' development alone is worth some high praise . 
  err what ? 
  spartans defeated athens and broke it , dooming it to never have any chance to regain its fromer glory , while the spartans with their xenophobia simply withered in time and became irrelevant . . 
  meh i could n't care less about the movie . 
  it was mostly a pop corn flick with nice shutouts for those who know their history , like that line . 
  if you * truly * have a bachelors in history yet you still have that mindset , then either your professors failed , or you simply did n't payed any attention . 
  i am guessing this is the level you stopped ? 
  i hope so because going for a phd will either be hilarious or tragic . 
  or both . 
  as for the veiled personal attack it was so predictable and low you need a shovel to find it . 
  no i do not condone their actions in the present world . 
  however i understand the whole context and do n't judge them as i would judge contemporary actions . 
  yep , it took me a long time , but i finally felt what other commenters in this subreddit claim a lot : pure physical stiffening and body reaction to that cringe . 
  hit a nerve there buddy ? 
  feels kinda awful when you make assumptions about someone or something without knowing it fully , does n't ? 
  thanks mr katakouzinos . 
  typically unless you are one of the * very * rare people with equal footing , you do n't refer them with their full titles ( it would get tiresome pretty fast ) neither with their names ( it could get you shot ) but with other honorific titles/styles ( your majesty , your highness , your holiness etc ) depending of position and gender . 
  there are many for [ royalty and nobility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_and_noble_styles ) , even for lower `` ranks '' , and they are still used . 
  as far as i know and remember ( mostly from [ thucydides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_peloponnesian_war#empire ) ) after the persian wars the two most dominant powers that emerged was sparta and athens , with the athenians the ones that vied to expand their `` empire '' as much as possible . 
  the delian league was originally constructed as an anti-persian alliance , that the athenians later used as their personal `` fief '' , to simplify a bit . 
  the spartans gathered their own alliance as * a response * to that , and in the beginning kinda reluctantly . 
  so its the other way around , * athens * tried to expand ( might have to add that one of the reasons the persians even invaded was because athenians where creeping in and trying to free the ionian greek cities from the persians , so this was a very old movement ) . 
  most of what we have for democracy , middle class etc comes from * them * and who knows how powerful they would had become and how far they would reach if the spartans had n't stopped them . 
  maybe an empire like rome ? 
  instead , the spartans after they defeated athens , they mostly retreated to their borders and their old ways , getting so stale that after the thebans ultimately took their only advantage , the land war supremacy , they simply sunk into obscurity . 
  one reason the macedonians never conquered them was n't only that it would cost too much , but also the gains would not worth it either . 
  they have became irrelevant only 100 years later . 
  if i may pitch in , the most essential stuff is that it has uniform color . 
  otehrs suggested to paint the claws and bony structures a different structure , but i do n't know , you can try something else since that is a staple with tyranids . 
  but you have to change something , no biological creatures is this uniform in its colors , it looks like plastic statue instead of a living creature . 
  gandalf turns from grey to white not only because he became more powerfull ( he actually unlocked more powers to interfere , he was n't given more ) , but to signify he took the formal position of saruman as leader of the wizards from the valar when they send him back from the dead . 
  he became what saruman was supposed to be , to roughly quote the books . 
  saruman 's robes for example in the books actually have a multi color hue on top of the white when he is utterly corrupted either by choice , or they have some magical connections with the wearers intent . 
  i perfectly understand what you say . 
  no , especially when you visit a country or place for the first and only time , and you are kinda strict on budget and days , its perfectly normal to go full mainstream and touristy to get some condensed picture of the place , or simply do n't see anything and slob in beach all day . 
  its * your * goddamn vacations . 
  * however : *, 
  are you going to be obnoxious and smart ass about it ? 
  claim you experienced the true hawaii/caribbean/greece to your coworkers/friends ? 
  or god forbid , be critical of the place towards the locals ? 
  i hope her sentence includes a girl outside her bars repeating and pressuring her to `` do it '' 24/7 . 
  but she will never be able to , even if she wants it . 
  michelle obama 2016 . 
  the tears will reach critical mass and cause a pandemic of libertarian deaths by extreme internet whining . 
  my muscles contract just by noticing the url . 
  never reached that point . 
  i noped at the `` you are really going for sloppy seconds ? '', 
  mark . 
  so there was even the tiniest possibility he could be charged ? 
  he cant even pronounce eratosthenes correct ... 
  its an optical illusion due to the atmosphere ( no really , they used this to explain the common example of the slowly disappearing sailboat in the horizon ) like the [ fata morgana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fata_morgana_%28mirage%29 ) or water in desert . 
  how do we know the atmosphere even * has * the ability to distort images ? 
  science !, 
  why does * this * mainstream science applies but * not * the one about the round earth ? 
  who the fuck knows !, 
  it was the jews !, 
  even if it was n't insured they could not charge him . 
  if he was hurt from the fall , he could actually sue * them * . 
  its entirely the fault of the museum . 
  we are talking about masculinity , not humanity . 
  thats not a problem with taxes , but budget management . 
  usually corruption is the problem , and that issue has multiple reasons to combat . 
  yup . 
  you can really see that the accident really derails the whole thing . 
  its tragically ironic , since without the accident he might not even finish the series . 
  there is breaking the fourth world , and then there is exploding it with c4 , and throwing the wreckage into the marianas trench . 
  at the time tactics was hated by the community because they where eagerly waiting for fallout 3 by interplay , that never came , and instead got a squad based tactical game witch was very unfriendly towards the established lore . 
  however , as years passed , the game was judged more clearly at its own merits , and it was found a very good one at what it does . 
  it might not be the best fallout game out there ( that will always be fo1 of course !,
