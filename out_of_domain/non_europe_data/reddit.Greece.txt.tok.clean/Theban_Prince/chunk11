  tactical victories did not win the strategic game . 
  pyrrus , hannibal , napoleon , hitler learned that the hard way.i think they got the gambler 's addiction , where initial victories followed by losses , made them raise the stakes higher and higher to recoup , until they went all in and lost everything.hmm i wonder if there is any research about that comparison . 
  i think it 's the american perception of both world wars , that france `` got its butt kicked '' until ~ ~ america turned up ~ ~ ussr fucked up the germans so much that saved everyone 's `` asses '' . 
  tell that to the others . 
  never wage land war in russia.unless you love mud baths . 
  i think you just described the most successful leaders in history with the same words . 
  just replace `` gays '' with oligarchs , gauls , christians , nobility , jews , capitalists , communists , terrorists and you just described pericles , caesar , diocletian , napoleon , hitler , stalin and a couple of us presidents where they used a `` scary enemy '' to get more power in their respective states . 
  seems it should be included in a `` how to become a leader 101 '' course . 
  cant.he has a tile between his ears . 
  the turks came from central asia . 
  when i come up with a situation that i dont know what roll i should do i simply roll a 20 and add an ability/skill that makes sense . 
  since dnd next seems to be based on this , i think it is a good way . 
  any leader that gets his state at a better position is great.ethics have no place in politics unless you get trouble for that.if hitler had keep europe under his grip , the holocaust would have no meaning if europe was under germany 's hegemony . 
  of course . 
  is cavalry police any good?while it looks awesome , is their anything they do better than police in motorcycles ? 
  edit : this is not sarcastic , it is a genuine question dummies . 
  spaces.have.been.declared.enemies.of.the.state.your.glorious.leader.the.period -----  . 
  so they are kept mostly for honorary reasons?because i think motorcycle police would do the same with less costs.not being a smart-ass , i am really asking . 
   not just us , not just presidents , and not just a couple , unfortunately . 
  well i did wrote a multitude of leaders from different eras and civilizations.i wrote a couple of unspecified us presidents , because i dint want to start a meaningless debate . 
  i know everyone would read in my words different presidents at different times . 
  uhh maybe you should re-read my comment.and there are no villains in politics.nor heroes . 
  from what i read from wikipedia ( hardly a 100 % genuine source ) he with some of the co emperors where the fiercest prosecutors.if you have better sources i would love to read them.i should have put nero instead . 
  i have no experience about the subject , so i am here just to ask so i learn something . 
  is n't `` promoting '' you company based on these forecasts a bit like false advertising?i mean if you are stating that your product will make 200 million $ , and does 20 $ , if it can be proved that was because of bad design/bad moves from inside the company intentional or not , used for lawsuit ? 
  i do n't know what yordles are . 
  i do n't know what they do . 
  but it doe n't matter , i will look for them , i will find them , and i will kill them . 
  i have yet to see a political leader being elected/chosen with the motto `` everything is awesome guys , we should stay as we are '' . 
  you can start with the [ propaganda machine ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/propagandamachine ) article.i bet you can find your road from there < [ evil laugh ... ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/evillaugh ) , 
  he was n't actually.he came from way eastern . 
  so he di n't wage war in asia . 
  asia waged war on them . 
  well i guess he used the `` internal enemy '' card instead . 
  well since they are the leading country economically , culturally and military , they are going to get the most flak for any mistakes.not that alway correct.but it is not always wrong either . 
  sounds reasonable.however i still think it would be too costly for a city to * introduce * a cavalry police.alas , because it would be awesome . 
  see the comment above about unopened games.as for the low price , they also know those games are trash and they are n't going to offload it unless it is a 6 year old or a grandma . 
  thank you for wasting your time explaining things to me.so nintendo on this case is safe ? 
   i still think leaving out the scouring of the shire was a disappointing decision, 
  i loved the scouring because you see the hobbits have left the shire as somewhat comic characters and return as bad ass heroes , and they need no man , elf or wizard to save them anymore . 
  however i thank both god and the valar when the movie ended without it . 
  reintroducing a villain that was defeated in the second movie , reappearing tertiary characters from the first movie , and a whole plot from anywhere after some very lengthy farewell scenes would be so so cruel for me , even worse for people that have not read the books . 
  your will to do something is not tied with your ability to do it well.remember the `` epic fail '' meme ? 
  my players where in the middle of a country size , dangerous marsh in a dungeons with the levels deep in the earth.even if they got out from the dungeon , they had weeks of cold , muddy trek ahead of them . 
  uhh cool runnings was based on the real life jamaican bobsled team . 
  [ lost girl ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1429449/ ) . oh so , so much . 
  [ plot coupon . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/plotcoupon ), 
  warning.tv tropes ahead . 
  i feel yada yada ( ing ) really breaks storytelling . 
  it is somehow telling the players `` this area was made only for you and your quest . 
  there is no reason for it to exist or we to take any further notice of it '', 
  let me translate this to you :, 
  ** `` paradox interactive had enough with the evw devs.we will not give them a cent more , but because we are afraid you are going to accuse * us * for pulling the plug , here , try it , and if you think it deserves it , you can pay instead of us '' **, 
  so you love throwing a [ red herring ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/redherring ) at them , congrats !, 
  its impossible to create a story without tropes.remember , tropes are not cliches . 
   `` you take some hours to climb out '' and giving the players an out-of-dungeon teleporter . 
  one ( i think ) breaks willing suspension of disbelief , it is simply the dm saying ` ok guys lets wrap it up '' . the other uses in game reasons and lore for a fast forward.you and your character skipped the boring part . 
  i really try hard to imagine how you could create a fantasy story with a big bad and plot coupon.everyone ( even the demons ? ), 
  is morally grey?or every session is just a string of unconnected adventures ? 
  does this mean evw is the first game to become a zombie?i mean , it is not entirely killed , but also it did n't go live . 
  you gave me some good answers here.one of the best so far.thank you !, 
  uh sorry but when someone is in his mind just , that doesnt mean he is just.some rapists think they have a right to abuse `` she/he deserved it '' . that does n't mean the are `` neutral '' . 
   why on earth would this happen just because the party stole the ruby from the snake idol ? 
  it was a gem that had deformed the dungeon around it in perverse ways by half opening a portal to another dimension and merging the two realities together.the final fight of the dungeon happened right above the gargantuan black hole/gate between planes , and when the players got the gem , the malformed dungeon collapsed . 
   so anyway , if the pcs penetrate all six levels of a dungeon in my game , yeah , they still have to get out , and yeah , there could be random monsters , leftover things they did n't kill , untriggered traps , hazards along the way , etc. 
  i 've got no problem with the pcs dying from carelessness as they retreat from a dangerous area . 
  on the other hand , i would n't just arbitrarily add more monsters or dangers just because they cleared the place out, 
  so what happens if they are 2 months travel inside a marsh , 6 levels deep in a 90 % empty dungeon?with no supplies left?and dead tired from the marsh monsters and hazards ? 
  i would love that game more than ~ ~ ever ~ ~ any gsg.such a pity . 
  i think you are confusing `` script '' with story . 
  [ my face when i first saw the jaegers . 
  [ toilet humour , forced catch-phrases , toilet humour , a bunch of 50 year olds naked , toilet humour . 
  ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m83tks6fjr1rys4czo1_500.gif ), 
   and if they 're two months from supplies , they forage or starve . 
  or they figure out how to teleport home on their own , using their resources and not dm fiat . 
  yo do realise * anything * that happens is dm fiat.right ? 
   or harder ; in editions with save-or-die , there have been a number of big bad guys or monsters who have died on round 1 without acting , and i 'm fine with that . 
  yet sounds so anti climatic.and random . 
  i could actually keep going but i 'll pass.what i * am * going to do is wager that when you first started playing dnd , baldurs gate had groundbreaking graphics . 
  however how you act during a war truly shows your alignment.a village militia defending their homes is good.a village militia that plunders and burns the enemy 's village for vengeance is not good no matter what the justification . 
  dnd is not the real world where every single person is a multifaceted being.dnd by definition is a storytelling game , where the story contains only roles ( villains,heroes,anti-heroes etc ) . yes you can make a morally grey villain.but unless you want your party to stop playing and start a philosophical discussion hat never ends , you have to give them a reason to kill something . 
  but plot hooks , no matter if they are single ( rail roading ) or multiple ( sandbox ) are the story!unless you entertain all those players with completely random scenes ( now you fight a white dragon in the desert!now a leopard in the steppes!now you contacted red death!why?fuck if i know ! ), 
  every time , you * are * using a story , thus tropes.when a plot hook fires , you are doing the same thing like everyone , you simply do n't force the players down a single path . 
  you can stop using your telephone , pc , tv , console.you can go live in a small town in the middle of nowhere with none or very few sec cameras around.you can pay only with cash , and close every bank account you have.what you fail to understand is , that even if we are monitored right now , nothing happens.in soviet russia during the 50 's you would get a knock on your door at 4am ... 
  but if the pcs find a guy just when he tortures/rapes , then ** they ** are the villains of the story . 
  uh guys it is obvious : a fantasy ( stteampunk ? ), 
  gsg with random starting maps . 
  unless most of the 10 % lived in a relatively close area , most of human technology would regress to middle age levels in the span of a few years.really specialized technology will be the first to go ( in you example , oil rigs , require constant maintenance and resupply plus training of new personnel due to old age/death ) . 
  power would be the first to bucckle followed by clean water.medical assistance will fail due to scarcity of resources , so more people will die from common diseases ( say hello to cholera ! ), 
  thus even less workforce to sustain roads , buildings , powergrid etc etc. 
   in australia, 
  of course . 
  greetings mr schwarzenegger.the only thing i want to add to this conversation is that you are one of the few celebrities that really gets internet culture , and he uses social media to their true potential : come in contact with your fans , be honest ( no pr guys behind the whole ordeal ) and keep in touch repeatedly , not just once because you want to promote your job . 
  thank you for being even more awesome , and i believe you get a lot of celebrity points with this . 
  well if you fed any starving person ( as in starved to death ) * any * diet that overloads their weakened system , they will probably have to throw up and lose even more energy.this happens with dehydrated people also . 
  i think you have to edit the save game also . 
  they might even let you join and convert , which probably makes for awkward family ~ ~ dinners ~ ~ sacrifices afterwards .
