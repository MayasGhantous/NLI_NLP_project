  elves can literally chill out , sing songs and write poems 90 % of their time . 
  this is precisely the result of what i said . 
  they did n't cast any specific spell on that bread , but it was so excellent crafted from farming to baking that it was `` magical '' . 
  a young one ? 
  how do they explain seasons , solstices and equinoxes ? 
  anyone with clear of the view from the sky can see the difference of the sons apogee as months pass . 
  it reminds me early 90s crpgs , particularly the realms of arkania series or eye of the beholder . 
  this is great , congratulations !, 
  fabulous, 
  vpn is not punishable . 
  while there is a pressure to create laws to block it , it is still a grey area . 
  hey thanks for the suggestion !, 
  poe 's law goes both ways . 
  mars is an irradiated desert already . 
  if dropping nukes in selected positions increases the atmosphere then it will actually * lower * the total radiation received . 
  please learn more before you form an opinion . 
  what math are you exactly talking about ? 
  that there is a serious [ radiation ] ( http://www.space.com/24731-mars-radiation-curiosity-rover.html ) on the surface of mars or that there is a possibility that if enough [ co2 is released from the deposits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terraforming_of_mars#carbon_dioxide_sublimation ) ( with various methods proposed , which include dropping frigging asteroids ) that exist on mars it is possible to create a `` benign '' greenhouse effect to make the atmosphere more dense ? 
  breaking bad is a series that you have to watch until the end to form a proper opinion . 
  the script was structured around the premise that it will conclude on the final season . 
  and the first season is considered the weakest . 
  i aint saying you are going to love it , but you will have a better opinion . 
  did i forced you in any way ? 
  i may failed in english there , i meant full opinion instead of better , and i was trying to explain that you might be missing something but this is not reason for you to get pissed . 
  the planet is * already * so irradiated that life will probably not exist for at least a meter beneath the surface ( see article ) . 
  this includes the atmosphere and the soil . 
  some nukes will not make a difference ( for comparison , we have detonated at least [ 2400 nukes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_weapons_tests#totals_by_country ) in earth for tests ) . 
  the point is to start a chain reaction that will self perpetuate and release the vast majority of the co2 by the gradual heating of the planet , not detonate a bazillion nukes . 
  is it feasible or efficient , particularly vs other proposed methods ? 
  this i do n't know . 
  is radiation a problem ? 
  nope . 
  you ca n't get infection ** s ** if you get cleaned daily , and it takes a bit of time to become smelly after showering depending on your activities ( chill out in a cool office vs work on a farm under the summer sun ) like , you know , the rest of the body . 
  edit : according to some apparently i did n't have a penis for the last decades . 
  and nobody admits that the * everything * is done so we can have fun skirmishes all week . 
  i found father accidentally few hours in the game . . 
  actual conspiracies do exist . 
  this is the reason almost every country has an espionage and counter-espionage agency . 
  but real conspiracies end in coups , assassinations , intel gathering , guerrilla support etc. 
  usually for national and sometimes private gains , and less in illuminati-lizards-jews controlling the world via kattie perry music videos . 
  eventually they get exposed , willingly or not , or else we would n't even have this discussion . 
  it has been suggested that `` weird '' conspiracy theories are actually supported by agencies to `` mud the waters '' so the real , mundane conspiracies can get less attention . 
  precisely . 
  the nsa scandal was a prime example of this , since it was detected by some people years ago , but the crazies hijacked the narrative and discredited it . 
  yeah because i asked them to change the entire development road map for the next two financial quarters while proposing - nay , * enforcing * them - to apply mechanics so complicate and far reaching they might need to create another subsidiary studio to implement it . 
  it could be turned off by the system when tidi kicks in . 
  i was thinking the same like damage notifications that fades after a bit . 
  definitely not a clickable window . 
  pretty much . . 
  that is also something i wanted . 
  yeah like that , outside the normal game play time when you are in warp the first time . 
  tidi could disable the system automatically . 
  billboards could work in tandem . 
  if you changed your entire daily game habits because of shitposting you are going to have a bad time both in eve and reddit . 
  have you ever thought about playing dnd the two of you ? 
  it can be a bit awkward but doable , particularly if you are more story focused instead of fight focused . 
  we are pretty much done with got spoilers so we will be fine . 
  the message can be tied with the presence of billboards in gates , so it will require player input to be active ( build/purchase a structure and anchor it ) . 
  so there will be even less spam . 
  plus enemies can kill them . 
  are you the collective consciousness of 50k + players ? 
  have we become a hive mind ? 
  communism , kabbalah , masons , jews , templars , satanism , catholicism , the whore of babylon , revelation passages . . 
  if you play a conspiracy/christian fundamentalism drinking game with this video you will be dead by minute 5 . 
  people also leave out the possibility that machiavelli wrote `` the prince '' as a sarcastic parody/criticism on how the local italian nobles ruled , [ particularly the medici family in florence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_prince#interpretation_of_the_prince_as_political_satire_or_as_deceit ) . 
  there is a chance its one of the oldest examples of poe 's law . 
  true , its up to the devs to decide on what scale they want personification vs immersion . 
  i am sorry but i think that ( mostly apparent ) ftl travel is theoretically possible with some maths , but so far we had 0 indication that the required phenomena exist . 
  the * correct * conspiracy answer to this is :, 
  `` they do . 
  they also do it through vaccines , water chlorination , cancer `` treatments '' , ebola , wifi and katty perry music videos . '', 
  they use different chemicals to catch everyone . 
  they are planning to subjugate ( wifi , chem trails ) those that they need to use as slaves and the rest are to die to keep the population under control . 
  and you seem to think that all these group are independent , when in reality they work for one group only : the * jews **, 
  ^ * or ^ the ^ `` fake '' ^ illuminati ^ jews ^ that ^ hitler ^ knew ^ about ^ and ^ tried ^ to ^ fight , ^ according ^ to ^ some ^ jewish ^ conspiracy ^ theorists . 
  ^ no , ^ really , ^ even ^ for ^ jews , ^ the ^ jews ^ did ^ it . 
  for you and others , this ( kinda infamous ) [ film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikqxu-5jw60 ) seems to be the main inspiration for the s.p.e.c.i.a.l. 
  videos . 
  one of a kind rhetoric people !, 
  next year baby . 
  biblical greek were spoken at least 500-400 years later dude . . half a millenium . 
  for comparison , 500 years ago we have n't even explored the americas apart from some coasts and and some people that where born in the byzantine empire could still be alive . . 
  its considered a very fringe movement , hardly some thousands . 
  they got some exposure the last 10 years mostly due to the overreaction of some hard core christian elements , particularly when they where trying to establish a proper temple . 
  um can someone explain to me something since i am not from the us ? 
  how the police officers are in the right getting * inside * someones house while he repeatedly asks them to leave and asking for id for no apparent reason ? 
  is there not a law that requires a minimum distance from your place you are not obligated your id ( some countries in europe have 200m distance ) ? 
  and while what he said was insensitive and crass , its hardly `` disturbing the peace '' or something unlawful . 
  just because someone is a `` sovereign citizen '' does n't mean the police is automatically the good guys all the time . 
  edit :, 
  since i do n't like to talk out of my ass , i searched the wisconsin law :, 
  '' ( 1 ) whoever , in a public or private place , engages in violent , abusive , indecent , profane , boisterous , ** unreasonably loud ** or otherwise disorderly conduct ** under circumstances in which the conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance ** is guilty of a class b misdemeanor . 
  [ source ] ( http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/947/_4 ), 
  he was yelling during an arrest , that can definitely be considered disorderly conduct according to this . 
  further :, 
  ( 2 ) terry and this section apply to confrontations between the police and citizens in public places only . 
  ** for private residences and hotels , in the absence of a warrant , the police * must have probable cause * and exigent circumstances or consent to justify an entry . 
  ** reasonable suspicion is not a prerequisite to an officer 's seeking consent to enter a private dwelling . 
  [ source ] ( http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/968/24 ) . 
  since ( 1 ) is true , they had the right to enter .
