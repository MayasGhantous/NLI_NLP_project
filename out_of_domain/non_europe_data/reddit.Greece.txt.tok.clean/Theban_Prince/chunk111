  *** guy is guilty . 
  he was inside his property from the start , as far as i know yelling critical things towards the police is not illegal , and unless they actively see a crime committed they ca n't barge in a property . 
  and he was arrested not for the yells , but `` obstructing the justice '' for failing to provide an id inside his garage after the cops entered it . 
  well is is definitely someones property . 
  would n't they require to check up with the owner ? 
  if the guy was the owner and did not provided them with evidence for that then it would be suspicious behavior . . but they did n't got him for that . 
  he was not in public place like a road , he was inside his property , literally inside the building . 
  for example , if the door was closed would it be okay for them to barge in and ask for id ? 
  he was in no way interfering with their arrest ( unless spewing stupid things is somehow preventing them in their cognitive abilities somehow ) , recording is legal as is calling them nazis . 
  what i am seeing is 4 cops abandoning the arrest for no reason than to check for the guy for 10 minutes in his property because he pissed them off . 
  what if you stop the music ? 
  because he stopped screaming the second they started walking towards him . 
  i would understand a reprimand here , but an arrest ? 
  can a officer ask for your id by entering your house just like that ? 
  what if he was screaming from a balcony , would it be ok if they broke down the door to ask him for one ? 
  if he was doing something unlawful by screaming they do n't need to arrest him for not procuring his id ( and leaving the ares of the previous arrest btw ) . 
  if he does not , entering someones house and asking him for an id for no probable reasons is ok ? 
   he was in his garage with the door wide open , i would hardly call that entering the home . 
  so if you have your door house open its okay for them to enter ? 
   they would go up to his room and ask for id , if he did not answer then i 'm sure they could make a 15 minute phone call get a warrant and have the building engineer open the door and not cause property damage, 
  i agree , however in this case they did not do that . 
   he was pretty much detained , they attempt to id him , if you were to walk into your home and lock the door it would be the same as if you were on the street detained and started walking away , so they could with reason forcefully enter the home as he is now pretty much running from cops in a sense , i 'm not sure if evading is the correct term in this instance , and make the arrest and tack on additional charges, 
  the first cop was already inside his house when they started talking , and proceeded to detain him . 
  they didnt explain or make clear they are detaining him before he got in , but after 10 minutes after they entered . 
  from what i saw the cops got pissed , entered his property ( while he specifically said them not to ) to talk with him , got pissed more , asked for his id and when he did not provide one then they arrested him . 
  even if he is required to have his id so close to his house ( that none bothered to reply if it is the case in the us , compared to europe where you are required to have it further than 200m from your house ) they are in the wrong for entering his house without a warrant ( and no person in apparent danger ) in the first place . 
  with the same mindset , i can get arrested if ask `` what is going on '' from the opposite street if i see cops . 
  this is not the same . 
  the ( apparent ) owner was here . 
  unless he committed a crime * before * entering the house ( which still requires a warrant afaik unless there is danger ) or they have reasonable suspicion that a crime is committed they can not enter a house , open doors or not , and even worse when the owner is there to clearly ask them to leave . 
  since he is in his house and not in a public place he does n't need to present his id . 
  so why did they arrested him ? 
  for been an asshole ? 
  well sorry but this is not illegal . 
  again you are using an example that this is not in any way similar to this case . 
  beating your wife and having her calling the cops is pretty clear reasons for someone to enter your house ( since the danger is clear ) . 
  screaming stupid things outside your window is not . 
  if you have sources proving that you require to have and present your id even inside your property without a crime commited , please provide a source . 
  what crime he committed ( obstructing is laughable , disturbing the peace is very debatable since he immediately stopped but surely not arrest worthy ) , and even if he did , is that a crime that allows them to enter without a warrant ? 
  this simple questions is what i am talking about that nobody answered with any real info . 
  i did not say it is not ancient , but [ it evolved at least 100 years later , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koine_greek#origins_and_history ) after the conquests of alexander , and possibly more . 
  also the biblical texts in greek form and the byzantine religious songs appeared a few centuries later ( and we cant ignore the possibility that those also evolved even further the 1000 years the roman empire became predominately christian ) . 
  that 's a lot of time for a language to evolve . 
  as for what you hear in this video , keep in mind that they are not greek native speakers , so their unfamiliarity and foreign accent make things worse ( like how when a foreigner might speak modern greek and can sound awful if he is not experienced ) and your surprise because it is not what you are used to hear , mostly the \u03b1\u03b9 sound which was pronounced \u03b1 , \u03b9 instead of \u03b5 as it is now . 
  so yelling stupid things is an arrestable crime that allows police to enter your house without a warrant , then demand your id ? 
  to be clear , is this what you are saying ? 
   when given the ** lawful ** command to present id you can be arrested, 
  i have yet to see any source where a police officer can use a citeable offence or otherwise to enter your property ** without a warrant ** and then demand your id . 
  you keep saying that its lawful yet no source , while i specifically asked about that . 
  this is where the argument hinges . 
  you are literally making shit up . 
  but me well , i can actually find some info :, 
   common actions that do not constitute disturbing the peace may include :, 
  engaging in horseplay ;, 
  simply embarrassing someone ;, 
  merely annoying someone ;, 
  accidentally bumping into someone ;, 
  ** giving someone a gesture such as the middle finger , ( sometimes even against a police officer ) **, 
  however , if a person 's non-violent actions are likely to incite violence or public disorder , criminal liability may apply . 
  - see more at : http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/disturbing-the-peace.html#sthash.uh758ors.dpuf, 
  ** he could give the middle finger to them and they could not touch him . 
  i am actually a regular here and i pretty much enjoy as shit seeing morons spew bullshit until they get their asses arrested . 
  that does n't mean that when i see police behaving in debatable matter i will ignore it , just because the arrested is a stupid asshole . 
  or did all police officers suddenly turned infallible ? 
   certainly does n't understand the law, 
  you have no provided any law , just your opinion ( it * was * a crime so they arrested him , because . . ) . 
  when you do so , i will be more than ok to agree with you . 
  the crime he committed is highly debatable . 
  the only issue they can accuse him is the sound level of his voice , but since he stopped ( `` because he was scared '' is irrelevant ) , i find it highly unlikely he is going to get charged in a court . 
  and calling someone a nazi is totally legal . 
  then, 
  they did not make it clear he is detained . 
  since he was n't detained , he is free to go anywhere he pleases unless he is told other wise . 
  then, 
  3 . they enter his house without a warrant . 
  unless you present me with any source that says differently , police can not do that unless there is clear danger or he has already outstanding warrants . 
  in other videos you will find police officers getting kicked out by some wacko 's grass even when they are there to present court orders . 
  then, 
  4 . they demand an id inside his house , when i repeatedly ask what is the law in the states since in europe you have to be further than 200 meter to be legally obliged to do so . 
  * even * if all previous conditions are true , they cant charge him for that . 
  they could ( might ) arrest him for disturbing the peace , but not for obstructing justice ( which they do so ) . 
  well `` common sense '' does n't equate legal status . 
  sources , sources ... 
  he was not disrupting the peace , and even if he did stopped doing so and he does n't require to have his id inside his house . 
  even if they could arrest him for part a ( debatable ) they ca n't ' arrest him for the id issue, 
   so yelling across the street , which is very loud and disturbing , is not disturbing the peace ? 
  you really think his neighbors would n't be disturbed after hearing the word nazi multiple times screamed outside ? 
  also are houses the safe zone now ? 
  are you saying if i am suspected of murder i just need to walk into my house and they cant interrogate me or ask me for id ? 
  good to know . 
  the law about peace ( that i actually had to read ) is dubious at best . 
  while yelling can be considered such , it is usually when you incite violence or you repeatedly do so even when you are told to stop ( neither is the case ) . 
  even then , courts tend to kick cases out as unconstitutional . 
  him yelling `` nazis '' is irrelevant since calling someone `` nazi '' is not illegal , he could screaming the `` my little pony '' intro . 
  second , not all crimes are equal , not all give the same rights to police officers . 
  if you are suspected for murder , a ) there is usually * already * a warrant issued and b ) if you might have killed , there is the logical suspicion ( as defined by law not out of our asses ) that you might do so . 
  yelling is not the same . 
  next thing you tell me is that police can enter my house as they please because i was jaywalking then entered my house . 
  at worst they could ring and ask me to come out , if i refused they could escalate and get a verbal warrant and * then * enter . 
  then they could charge me for jaywalking * only * , because when they asked to come in they did n't have a warrant .
