  these procedures did * not * happen in this case since they immediately entered his house because they where simply pissed . 
   i swear you people have no idea what you even stand for but you all defend each other with your last breath . 
  you people ? 
  is it easier to label me as a part of a certain group ( which i am not , because i find `` sovereign citizens '' arrest hilarious , * when * they are legal ) so it is easier to handle my criticism or even discuss?my opinion , right or wrong , this is very disturbing of you . 
  yup , he is guilty . 
  well you could have said so before , that wasted hours of arguments and some burned karma . 
  used to work in hotels . 
  a girl was moving 200 coffee mug plates stacked on top of each other on a room service table ( notoriously unreliable ) . 
  amid 200 guests in the lobby of a five star hotel . 
  alone and without no visual in front of her . 
  the audiovisual technicians had placed up cables in the floor , covered with plastic so not to trip someone , but enough to forcibly stop a cranky room service table with 200 precariously placed stacks of plates ... 
  the situation was so hilarious , particularly how 200 conference attenders stopped * everything * and turned to look at her in silence , compounded with her crying like a poor little girl , that the supervisor actually gave her 10m break to calm herself while the housekeeping girls was busy gathering the pile of broken platexplostion . 
  she was fine and not fired , mostly due to her obvious remorse . 
  mind you she was not fired . 
  i might had something to do about it by immediately going to the supervisor and telling him `` she seems to be in terrible , terrible shock about what happened , maybe you can calm her down , she is actually crying '' and her being very lucky , because said supervisor was the most cool of the bunch . 
   he is , however , an asshole . 
  oh nobody argued with that !, 
  however , that particular law is broad enough for officers to arrest him . 
  afterwards , courts have been known to dismiss cases or give a slap in the wrist , but the officers dealt probably within the legal framework . 
  remember that they are supposed to resolve situations , and he was n't simply calling them nazis while they passed by the road , it was screaming during an arrest . 
  it would be nice if we could find a followup . 
  nobody is clean in this crime .

  can someone explain to me what the hell that nestor was doing there ? 
  it does n't sound right in this video anyways no just some reasons , but the specific reasons i said . 
  and since what sounds `` melodic '' is subjective to the listener , your teacher made no sense . 
  they did n't participate at all in the main action , they appeared after the fight to catch stragglers . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  returning player , and a lot have changed . 
  i feel sad for my compatriots , because some of them are so desperate for some hope they are clutching for anything to believe from . 
  definitely not a cult . . sih . . 
  it will be probably more close to submarine warfare . 
  in space , its really easy to hide if none knows you are there , but very very difficult if they detect you even once . 
  so ships will more focused on making as much possible damage in the shortest time and bail out before counter attacked ( armor is useless in space ) . 
  spaceships will probably be designed and equipped under the utmost efficiency , since even if you have some fantasy energy source , total mass of your ship will always take effect in maneuvers etc. 
  `` fighters '' will be used , but probably will be drones . 
  a big ship can hid itself in some point in the solar system and launch drones , to perform attacks in safety . 
  piracy while it seems unrealistic , could be doable , because while space is big , some points while get more traffic . 
  gravity wells for assists like jupiter will be really common travel places to shorten travel time and conserve fuel . 
  definitely gf . 
  it is like you were there . . 
  since most creatures have at least a rudimentary nerve system , pain is a given . 
  while `` emotions '' and their existence depends on the type of animal ( and its debatable if they feel ) , it has been shown that different chemicals either natural like those produced by pain or inserted do interfere with the functions of even `` simple '' creatures ( see research with different chemicals like caffeine in spiders ) . 
   fb is a big deal here, 
  yup , definitely highschool . 
  they are fucking over * some * aids patients . 
  is this somehow better ? 
  seriously we are overflowing with content . . gf guys !, 
  no moa cormorants to pick off the scraps this time ? 
  shame . . 
  you little kmwhore i saw you doing that and tried to take you down before we pulled off . . 
  lucky you i did n't have any more drones :d, 
  drake is the ak-47 of eve . 
  it might not excel like other expensive stuff , but almost everyone knows how to use it , cheap , reliable , and in decent hands can do some pretty good damage . 
  yeah i am really sorry i dont have to train for 1 year for 1 ship just so i can make a difference . 
  this is way beyond eve . 
  if it was n't eve it would be football , your friends , action movies , your mother etc. 
  just pay attention that this is really happening and you are not externalizing/rationalizing your faults on the other partner . 
  i think what are they implying is that xcom will start with pretty basic technologies , not that they will not get anything later in the game . 
  during a class discussion article they stated that during the end game they want the player to feel they surpassed the aliens . 
  ~ ~ you can either buy or loot a radio ( usually a dead mutant will have one ) . 
  use it in front of the gate . 
  i think it requires a speech check . 
  if i remember correctly you can use a electronic lock-pick , or explosives . 
  but do n't take my word on that . ~ ~, 
  use katja . 
  you can recruit her from the followers of the [ apocalypse library in boneyard . 
  ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/boneyard_library ), 
  rome pretty much entered greek politics in the role of the protector of the south city states versus the dominating macedon kingdom . 
  however , after beating macedon repeatedly , they became increasingly autocratic towards the greeks leading to the [ achean war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achaean_war ) . 
   if you 're uncomfortable starting at the bottom and working your way up, 
  actually that 's the whole set up of games like wow . 
  you know , its called `` leveling '' and `` grinding gear '' so you can bash newbros in chat ( or so i am told ) . 
  are you sure * you * are n't the one playing the wrong game ? 
  i agree , it appears that they are trying to make clear that no `` progress '' from the previous game will follow through , xcom will start almost from step 1 , like they lost the war in march . 
  you are correct . 
  i got confused with the tape that drops . 
  she is not tandy from shady sands , but katja from boneyard ( see the link i posted ) close to adytum . 
  the library you find her is a bit off , i do n't blame you for not knowing it , i actually missed it entirely in my first play through . 
  you have to go left a screen from where the blades bar is to find it ( not world travel ) . 
  she is going to be a [ girl in black with punk hair ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/katja ) , might be difficult to find her amid the rest of the npcs . 
  hmm weird and probably a bug ? 
  as i said i have n't used katja a lot to know the proper procedure . 
  fixt has some issues with breaking your game ( like causing the entire junkyard to become hostile if you choose to attack the skullz via speeacch ), 
  trying rising/buffing your lock pick skill and definitely * using * the * electronic * lock pick ( not the regular ones ) on the door , failing that , use explosives . 
  as a final advice , even if bodies disappear , the items are usually left in the floor/dirt . 
  choose `` highlight items '' in their options and see if the tape is somewhere around . 
  if those do n't work you are out of luck :( . 
  yeah , dynamite was kinda a suggestion of last resort , i was half sure it would n't work ( but remember my advice if you play f2 . . ), 
  good luck now , and i hope you have a great time !, 
  you really seem to have experience with `` theme-park '' mmo games . 
  that explains your teenager attitude and the `` hur dur noobz '' i guess . 
  can you get back to those games please ? 
  if you love eve so much let it go man , the quality will get a noticeable bump . 
  what do you mean debit card ? 
  you mean bancontact , so you cant use it for online shops ? 
  simply get an online debit card like viking card minimum deposit 50 euros + 3 charge . 
   i mean a foreign card without the security numbers that allow you to make online purchases . 
  yup that is bancontact . 
  [ i use this ] ( https://vikingcard.com/en/ ) for purchases online for two months and so far no problem , but i tend to fill up the minimum amount i am going to spend for security .
