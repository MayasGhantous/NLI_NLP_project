  the race that captures you is irrelevant , its they who follow that are the problem , and they are one and the same . 
  warbands that follow papa nurgle can turn you into a giant enslaved pustule of pain , tzeetch can bestow `` gifts '' that will turn you into a insane grotesque abomination , and slaanesh marines will do pretty much the same depravities as the dark eldar , or turn you into a living sculpture . 
  and if you get moved to the eye of terror , where time kinda breaks down , your difficult times can last an indeterminate period of time . 
  so your `` safest '' bet is to get captured by khornate marines , and either get slaughtered or worked to death for the war machine immediately . 
  everything else that has to do with chaos is literally hell . 
  i liked that reference . . 
   i say i am shy and i dont speak on comms, 
  somehow gets leadership positions . 
  you are not going to reach a top position in a half decent corp via texting , much less a null sec alliance . 
  i am not challenging the possibility that he is a spy , but that ama was probably 99.9 % bullshit . 
  this is eve * and * reddit after all . 
  * even * if it was n't , when you scrutinize the info he gave , they are essentially worthless , and only useful to instill unnecessary suspicion . 
  ehh experienced leadership will give no shits about his ama . 
  it happened to me . . by the technician in the pc store i was , to check what was wrong with mine ... 
  they also wanted to charge me 400 $ because windows were corrupted due to a failing disk . 
  in reality the gpu was a bit out of the socket and they have n't seen my ssd drive ... 
  guilty as charged . 
   eve,

  light ( and its waveleghts ) are the same in our universe . 
  they might have eyes that see different waveleghts than ours ( like some animals do ) but seeing entirely different colors is impossible . 
  but hey will probably have different names for colors or color groups !, 
  ask an ye [ shall ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/18/article-2632020-1df8d89500000578-501_634x900.jpg ) [ receive !,

  i suggest you take a good look on the video posted in this comment section . 
  the guy is a dangerous asshole . 
  `` do n't let the facts get in the way '' people are missing the point . 
  the great fact here is that in this time and age , you can easily find the resources to start learning almost any skill . 
  after a while , if you are passionate for that , you obviously are going to follow through and try to build stronger bases with additional , more pro ways . 
  the internet provided the starting point for careers or hobbies people did not had easy ( or cheap/free ) access previously . 
  you can start * getting * into programming , music , web development , journalism and now even frigging olympic sports essentially in a few days if you really want to . 
  and that 's fucking insane . 
  you actually agree totally with me . 
  as i said , past a certain point , you need more than youtube videos if you want to progress . 
  what i said is great is that you can * start * doing something for free or dirt cheap . 
  its the like a car accident where just two people died but hundreds slow down to check out blocking the road . 
  i think this is a given . 
  you can establish `` roads '' ( probably cleared dirt paths ) and you can have self driving cars going around . 
  there is no reason not to it that way , but that will require to have some significant infrastructure there that needs regular going back and forth ( like two colonies or mines ) . 
  it will result in less humans needed , and human needs tons of resources . 
  a self improving ai . 
  it would invent everything that has been posted . 
  or nuke us, 
  but it would definitely change our lives .

  some of the coins are from the time of the ottoman empire . 
  the weird signature on them is the sultans one ( [ tughra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tughra ) ) . 
  if you can have a clear view of it , since every sultan added a little bit in the signature to make it his own , you can find the time it was printed . 
  i have found one or two of these and they are practically worthless . 
  the golden with the eagle on appears to be a twin of [ this ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/germany-circa-1888-nurnberger-spiel-und-rechenpfennig-game-counter-jeton-/321880906620?hash=item4af198db7c ) , german jetons used for games or counting . 
  one of the tombstones has a [ cross patee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross_patt%c3%a9e ) on it , a predominately western christianity symbol from the middle ages . 
  this means it could be after the the fourth crusade ( 1204 ) or in an area where westerners lived , like the enclaves of constantinople . 
  edit : based on the location provided , i am more inclined to believe it is actually a [ bolnisi cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bolnisi_cross ) , a georgian christian symbol that predates the cross patee and actually inspired it . 
  the rest of the items are a mishmash from various eras ( and i am guessing various locations ) , and to be honest , very illegal and unethical to be in private possession . 
  the myst series are considered the epitome of the `` puzzle '' adventures that dominated pc gaming during the 80s-90s . 
  myst 1 was actually the biggest selling game * ever * until it was dethroned by sims 1 in 2000 . 
  i suggest you start from myst 1 , they have actually produced an updated version with better [ graphics ] ( https://www.gog.com/game/real_myst ) . 
  tremendously atmospheric game . 
  and be prepared to get ** very ** frustrated , but be patient before you run to some guide in the internet . 
  those games where designed under the assumption that you will get stuck in places for long with no help ( or internet !, 
  ) , and using a guide shortens them considerably , and kinda defeats the point . 
  if i remember correctly , the 8.1 windows keys where tied to his hardware , so when he changed it he * could n't * reinstall it . 
  welcome !, 
  the guy actually claimed that he gets major alliance 's leadership positions , while staying silent in coms because he was * shy * so none can recognize his voice . 
  apart from any newbie still in school systems , nobody believed him . 
  holy fuck the acting was frigging horrible . 
  particularly from that kid . 
  `` we have a couple of surprises for him '', 
  warp to 70 from anomaly and use sentries . 
  when frigs spawn target them first and kill them with sentry drones in 2-4 secs . 
  problem solved . 
  you did n't lose all you skill points down to 900k , you lost usually a level from a trained skill , usually a lvl 5 . 
  lets see , giant ( fire-breathing ) ant invasion , two wannabe larp superheroes , peter pan homage , republic of dave , inbred hillbillies in the swamps , aliens from mars attacks , moira ( and ghoul moira ) . 
  come on that game was fucking ridiculous . 
  pretty much . 
  that game had nice set pieces but one of the worst bethesda scripts you can find . 
  they had a post apocalyptic aircraft carrier . 
  they could turn it into a creepy main dungeon like the glow from f1 . 
  or they could turn it into the main base of a major enemy like the `` smokers '' from waterworld . 
  but no , it was a fucking boring quest hub with 20 forgettable npcs . 
  it was one of the selling points for me . 
  oh believe me , i remember the carrier concept art . 
  i think fallout 4 will be a mish mash between assassins creed 3 ( americanitis everywhere ! ), 
  and fallout 3 with some major mods tacked in ( modular power armor , colony mod ) . 
  its the only one i have no intention of buying right away . 
  everyone was discussing that you had the guts to show up on the way home . 
  ehh liberty prime was good , i think its one of few points where they got the balance of 50 's camp and awesomeness , even if it was kinda lame from a game play point . 
  i am very worried because it seems the script will be more `` direct '' , for example your character will be a specific guy a la mass effect . 
  in addition with the bethesda lackluster scripts that we discussed , this can be a major problem since you cant `` go and do your thing '' that makes the main quest more bearable . 
  if it was made by obsidian instead of bethesda itself i would be totally onboard . 
  now i am very reserved . 
  skyrim on release was very lackluster in the story department . 
  at this time i think you should try it with some major mods , especially if you add `` hardcore '' mods that add dangerous enemies and survival aspects . 
  it reminds me ( a bit ) the old 90s rpg . 
  i had the suspicion this was a `` springtime for hitler '' scheme . 
  now i am sure . 
   the republic of ireland should secede from the eu , rejoin the uk . 
  so secede from the eu and then rejoin it the next day ? 
  the * corrupted governments * of greece and spain .
