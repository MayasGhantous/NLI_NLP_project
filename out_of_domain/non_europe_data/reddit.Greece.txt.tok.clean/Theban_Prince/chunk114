  its not like millions of people made a secret pact to trick the eu . 
  but i am guessing we are okay accusing a baker for not being familiar with the union procedures , and economics to catch them , but eurostat officials and eu legistators get a pass i presume ? 
  as / u/technically _ art said , head to vault 15 to pack up . 
  the radscorpion cave is very difficult to do alone and immediately . 
  hire ian , and try to keep distance from any enemies . 
  if you can get a shot and move away from their range its perfect , but if you cant , simply use all your aps to move and let him take shoot them to death . 
  if they attack ian , do the opposite . 
  you probably dropped the gun by the way , and afaik items persist for a very long time . 
  in the preferences there is an option that when ticked highlights all items in the world in a yellow outline , use this to help you find it . 
  give her the news is a calm and protective way : it does n't make sense . 
  its two proper greek words , but both the grammar and meaning are wrong . 
  if your ancestors where english , chances are you are related with an english monarch , even if it is your cousin 145 removed from the early middle ages . 
  if your french roots go back enough , there is a good chance you have ties to the english throne through the french royalty . 
  they didnt kill each other for centuries over nothing . 
  and you might have two royal bloodlines instead of one !, 
  pretty much . 
  so you can pick what bloodline you wish !, 
  theban royalty tends to end bad . 
  what really drove it home for me was when i visited the british museum . 
  in the base of one of the babylonian gates ( might be the [ winged lions ] ( https://idkpal.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_3325.jpg ) ) there is a puzzle game etched in the stone . 
  the tiny inscription next to it informed that it was a `` board game '' that was probably etched in the statues by two bored gate guards . 
  and there , in a tiny spot in the midst of the typical grandeur of kings tombs , treasures and war spoils we usually equate with `` world history '' was the proof that before classical athens , the romans , the medieval empires , before leonardo da vinci and the industrial revolution , before the internet , there where two bored dudes slacking off and playing games to pass time . 
  just as we do . 
  and he is the poster boy for / r/badhistory threads . . 
  first , its eurocentric . 
  the arab , eastern roman empire and chinese regions where keeping up , and lot of things that got `` rediscovered '' during the renaissance where actually things that passed though those areas to western europe . 
  secondly , it is totally ignoring that even then , europe had a decent rate of `` advancement '' considering the situation . 
  as for religion and its role they totally ignore the invasions from the east , mutliple civil wars , plagues , that happened before and during those centuries . 
  the [ crisis of the third century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_of_the_third_century ) for example probably played a great role in weakening the roman empire , yet had no major religious reasons . 
  i would not have direct knowledge about that , but for me , it seems that plagues simply had more ways to spread . 
  [ the plague of justinian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plague_of_justinian#origins_and_spread ) ( bubonic plague ) exploded because of the byzantine trade infrastructure , and stopped the last chance the roman empire for reunification . 
  [ on another instance of the bubonic plague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_death ) , the mongols brought it to crimea , and the genoese trade spread it from there to the rest of europe . 
  to me , in a macro scale , seems that expanded trade routes either due to a strong far reaching empire ( byzantium ) or a marine republic ( genoa ) was what allowed plagues to spread so much . 
  as for curing it or containing it , i hardly think any knowledge that existed before or then , religious influence or not , would matter . 
  it used to be scary for me , but then i realized * you * will have no knowledge of it , you will feel no pain or remorse . 
  its brutal for your loved ones . 
  i think rust creates pores where the bacterium can thrive , so you have better chances to get sick by a rusty nail than a new one .

  there are no civilian airplanes simple peasants like us can ride dude . 
  all of them are fake and used to spread chem trails and anyone you ever known that claimed he had traveled in one was simply under the effect of the chems . 
  yeah men , its those lizardjews that produce them . 
  i for example never moved to brussels , its all a chem sideffect . 
  tourism is doing great all these years ( and rhodes is already a tourism destination ) . 
  the problem is with other parts of the economy . 
  what the fuck where they thinking ? 
  apart from the whole slapstick comedy idiocy , they where trying to call back one of the most awesome scenes of the original trilogy , the battle with the balrog , and fucking shit all over it . 
  what, 
  apart from the official books and material ( like the codexes ) , the [ lexicanum ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=lexicanum&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 ) wiki is a nice place to start . 
  paging / u/gschizas . 
   we dont know yet what is gon na happen to stations once citadels come into their own . 
  um you do n't know ? 
  [ ccp has being clear that stations and poses will get out of the game in phases . 
  ] ( http://cdn1.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/67008/1/transition2.png ), 
  unless they fuck this up or leave it halfbaked ( granted both results are not that insane for ccp ) there is absolutely no need to have three types of structures that have similar functions . 
  you are taking this a lot more seriously than you should . 
  its a joke . 
  yeah , after citadels are released and some time will pass so they do n't break everything . 
  you do know what `` phase out '' means , do you ? 
   we are also not going to *** remove *** existing structures instantly without a transition plan . 
  [ dev blog ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/back-into-the-structure/ ), 
  while they have n't signed any contracts ( because wip ) its pretty much obvious to everyone they will take out outposts in the game sooner or later . 
  apart from the whole developing hassles such as handling code and models for two identical systems for years , citadels will never catch on if outposts keep existing ( indestructible stations vs destructible citadels ? 
  hard choice / s ) and all that work will go for nothing . 
  i am not saying that ccp might not leave them half baked ( incarna ) if they fuck up , but their intentions are pretty clear . 
  my original comment :, 
   ccp has being clear that stations and poses will get out of the game in phases, 
   `` we are also not going to remove existing structures instantly without a transition plan . '', 
  is english not your primary language ? 
  you stumbled in a conspiracy theorist/holocaust denier . 
  pretty common sight in / r/conspiracy . 
  move along , nothing to see here . 
  he is an archeologist , but since in the sow they meet civilisations stuck in different historical eras ( minoan crete , pharaonic egypt , classical greece etc ) hes is essentially used as a anthropologist . 
  kinda how paleontologist alan grant in jurassic park was essentially turned into a zoologist due to his experience . 
  did you miss the lines where according to the protagonists '' the goa'uld kept the abducted humans from * advancing * their civilization '' ? 
  they say this at least 10 times per season . 
  or that most advanced civilizations like the nox do n't give advanced technologies to the humans because they are not `` ready '' for it as a culture ? 
  i am not saying that is true in the real world , but the show definitely uses that theme all the time . 
  as for daniel , indeed archaeology is a part of anthropology , but in the show ( especially early seasons or even more in the original ) it is pointed that from studying remnants of those cultures he is suddenly a `` field anthropologist '' experiencing what he studied first hand . 
   `` you 're us or you 're primitive . '', 
  what . 
  are you trying to pick a fight when there is n't one ? 
  i never said or implied that . 
  the show heavily structures itself around ** technological ** differences ( a spaceship is better than a chariot ) , not cultural or ethical , and i never said it did . 
  you absolutely read too much into my comments . 
  take a break mate and get your unbased hostility somewhere else . 
  is this so difficult to understand that i was talking about a imposed stasis on all levels and primarily technological ? 
  lets say we transplant an ancient greek city in another planet and leave it free to its own devices . 
  that city * will * evolve different technologies , morals , ethics and culture in general as time goes by . 
  i * never * said they are going to evolve into a * better * version , because morals are subjective . 
  this is something you pulled out of nothing . 
  the only think they will * probably * do better is technology . 
  which you can quantify and compare in quality ( spaceship vs chariot ) . 
  in the show * however * , the goa'uld effectively stumped any progress ( where they could ) by force . 
  that does n't mean the humans where `` barbarians '' but you can agree that no civilization would stay exactly the same for 4000 years unless it was * imposed * . 
  it was the equivalent of a human zoo . 
  you did n't even understand what i was talking about , yet you jumped on me . 
  for weapons yes , but armor no unfortunately . 
  this was implemented in fallout 2 . 
  however , you do n't need to * trade * anything . 
  you can pickpocket your followers and move stuff between you and them at will .
