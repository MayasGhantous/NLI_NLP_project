  they will never break the action no change opinion/become hostile to you . 
  free beasts of burden !, 
  yeah same here mate . 
  you trying to hammer a point home that i * agree * with from the start . 
  this is because 2d technology had reached a plateau by that time . 
  if you compared 2d games from the start of the 90 's to the end of the decade , the difference was quite extreme because the technology was advancing by leaps and bounds . 
  3d technology is reaching this point , and games have a longer shelf life concerning graphics . 
  for your example compare [ morrowind ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/e/ef/mw-npc-caius_cosades.jpg/600px-mw-npc-caius_cosades.jpg ) ( 2002 ) with [ oblivion ] ( http://images.uesp.net/7/7f/ob-npc-areldil.jpg ) ( 2006 ) and [ skyrim ] ( http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/11032-1-1330077199.jpg ) ( 2011 ) . 
  oblivion is good even now , and skyrim still looks great when it has the same age as morrowind had from oblvion release . 
  it was a more deep game considering world , style and game mechanics , but the technology of the graphics representation is quite better . 
  this irked me a lot more :, 
   just bought into an 18-year-old `` startup '' that has struggled to advance beyond its first big hit . 
  while ccp definitely had blunders when they tried expanding their portfolio , just because you are not google or ea does n't turn you into a `` startup '' . 
  ccp has been very stable and successful in its niche . 
  especially if you consider that eve is a few months older than the * original * [ call of duty ] ( http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2810041088/tt0382590?ref_=tt_ov_i ) . 
  how many aaa mmos had survived that long again ? 
  pretty much . 
  nah they do n't because we kinda [ fucked them up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_leuctra ) and showed them how `` elite '' their hoplites trully where . 
  love from thebes . 
  and ... stork ? 
  really dude . 
  if someone there is pissed with the caldari please at least tell us . 
  minor trivia : in modern greek the wordm '' [ tragelaph ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hircocervus ) `` and its derivatives is used for this occasion : something so tragic yet extreme/weird that it crosses the line and can get funny ( i.e. 
  that doctor was so bad he actually got discount offers from undertakers ) . 
  if you are using fixt there is major bug with skullz . 
  if you get in any kind of fight with skullz * in the hotel * the whole town flags you as hostile . 
  i do n't think there are ways to circumvent this since the other way to take them out is to pass speech tests with the girl on their front door ( the one from inside the motel lobby , no the one on the side of the building ) . 
  however i think the bug turns her also hostile before speaking to her . 
  if it does , your only solution is either to restart ( what i did because perfectionist ) or simply not complete that particular sidequest . 
  the major things to do in junktown is to bust doc morbit , get dogmeat , bust gizmo and the skullz . 
  so if you have done 3 out of 4 you should be good to simply move on . 
  almost all games up to 6 where focused around visiting collecting the necessary plot coupons from the 8 shrines dungeons and cities to open the final dungeon . 
  they had a great back story and `` feel '' for the time , but the gameplay could become tedious . 
  the vast majority of books are the same in every game , so you did n't missed much . 
  it should neve be possible to live in highsec indefinitely . 
  highsec should get a lot smaller and a lot of high sec systems should turn into a lowsec hybrid style of regions . 
  maybe concord covers your ass only in gates and stations , but you are on your own if you get outside those safety zones to mine or pvp . 
  this is not a case of a `` 1/32th irish '' . the guy has irish parents and it seems he regularly visited ireland for long stays . 
  if we can use the term irish american in a serious tone then this is the one . 
  just a head up !, 
  ask for a map screenshot next time . 
  it will be good for the rest of us to learn where was it , and makes it proof from photoshopping . 
  `` exploring '' in mmos does include usually inaccessible areas . 
  well that thing in the sidebar is worthless . . 
  living in brussels for only a year , so i will not say i know their politicians by a long shot . 
  but i strongly suspect that al that fuzz is because belgium dropped the ball with the whole paris attack , they are kicking the overdrive to seem that they are serious . 
  the firefox extension masked this by showing it was posted in / r/cringe . 
  it worked so well !, 
  i think they only option to `` join '' the khans is to give up tandi after she is abduct her . 
  apart from maybe changing the end scenes there is no other in game acknowledgement if i remember correctly . 
  in a more serious tone we get a lot of sockets closed . 
  i am writing this while re logging to be honest . 
  edit : and another , 
  to be there is hell , as others had said , and not the `` war is hell '' kind but `` omfg when this is ever going to end '' kind . 
  however after that you get to say `` i was there '' to newbros plus your killmail usually looks so green you think you have colorblindness . 
  once or twice per year is prefect ( for fights like b-r ) more than that will burn you out pretty fucking fast . 
  [ inherit the earth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6evzjdxcom ) ? 
  if it is not it would be nice to say how where the animal presented ? 
  anthropomorphic ? 
  other suggestion might be the wolf/lion series ? 
  your crit is * probably * the reason . 
  i had cases even in vanilla fallout where i accidentally killed a friendly npc ( or god forbid a brahmin ) and the rest turned aggressive . 
  try the fight once more . 
  i know it can be tedious but . . 
  i always considered that fcs essentially they switch to a rts gameplay . 
  with some soldiers that are more dumb than an ai . 
  the addition of a top down camera with the new patch is not a coincidence . 
  idea :, 
  ccp releases a scifi rts based on the gallente-caldari war era . 
  they can even act as publishers instead of developers !, 
  the final assault on a citadel could go either way , either blow it up or assault with legio and take it over for yourself . 
  its not that horrible . 
  pretty much . 
  he almost forgot to say that pandemic * horde * is a pet of the pandemic * legion * , one of the oldest and most powerfull alliance on their own . 
  and they still run because `` we did n't want that system anyway '' . 
  we have been spammed repeatedly with that copy pasted shit for at least a month now in r/eve . 
  they run . 
  they do reach the same points at the same time . 
  but for some frames the first one is entirely missing and then appears at the same spot as the others , creating the illusion that it is slower . 
  its actually `` california/movies law '' in reddit . 
  [ for most of the us states the age of consent is lower that 18 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_the_united_states ), 
  your are in a big hall where hundreds of people smoke and ventilation is not that great . 
  what do you think ? 
  except paradox games . 
  there you can get a tiny glimpse on how foreign policy , along with domestic politics , where intertwined to effect your long term goals as a leader of a state . 
  ad hominem only works when you are using a personal flaw that has nothing to do with the debate/opinion at hand . 
  not when it does . 
  examples :, 
  `` i think we need to restrict our spending as a state '', 
  * `` nobody hear this guy , he used to be a nerd at school '' - ad hominem *, 
  `` i think we need to restrict our spending as a state '', 
  * `` yeah but back when you where minister of finance , you actually authorized more spending for the military '' *, 
  since in this case he is voicing his opinion about the state of a community , getting to know how he behaved as part of this community , and most importantly if there are past grievances that might effect that opinion , it is not an ad hominem . 
  well good job , now he is . 
  the missions do n't check what ship or modules you use , only that specific requirements are met ( mine me some ore-buy it from the market ) . 
  i have done tutorial missions with a goddamn tengu . 
  do the egyptian :, 
  thats on of those idiotic arguments . 
  a human will probably not have the reaction time to save * anyone *, 
  also nobody who know just a single thing about programming , would ask that quesrion because nobody programs like ( school bus  car ) .
