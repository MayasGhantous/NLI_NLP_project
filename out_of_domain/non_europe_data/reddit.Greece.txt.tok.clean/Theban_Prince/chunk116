  it will programed to handle driving responces and calculation thousands of times faster than a human . 
  * which means 99 % of it will never need the choice anyways , especially if the bus is also computer driven . 
  * even 1 % of failures will probably be on par of human accidents in destruction ( but very very rare ) . 
  its like wanting to take off the driving wheel because sometimes it causes heavier injuries than if you dint have one there . 
  he is already inside that bubble , but i get what you mean . 
  however they will propably instateleport . 
  hey dude dont just stand there by the wall , join the party . 
  they have mortal bodies . 
  or yoda already knew he was coming from ben and `` crash landed '' luke 's x-wing right next to him . 
  or its simply both a narrative the moves the story along . 
  the starkiller base is obviously using the rakaata 's sun harvesting technology that was used to build the [ star forge ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/e/ea/starforgesucksgas-kotor1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20050611215331 ) from kotor1 . 
  we would actually leave them open with about 5-10 $ change in it . 
  most break-ins in my city where from junkies so we hoped they will not trash the place until they find any valuable , and instead take the easy target and scram . 
  it worked . 
  plus they have the manual . 
  its an inside joke . 
  if he knew things will leak in reddit he would use / s, 
  if you watch the video with sound , insted of the gif , the dog is `` crying '' instead of growling . 
  npc stations will still exist in high/low/npc space wont they ? 
  ok let me repeat that . 
  in npc stations that 90 % of the highsec players use you will still be able to walk in stations . 
  in citadels you will not , ** but ** citadels will mainly replace poses that are non `` walkable '' anyways . 
  the only wis capability that will be lost is from * player * built space stations in null , and that percentage is not that big . 
  however what it is perfectly clear is that its development is dead , and some time in the future it will probably get taken out ( and shot ) in the least fanfare possible . 
  there are various option to deal with him . 
   seeing game of thrones ' budget breaks my heart a little every time i think of the potentially 3 lost seasons of rome . 
  same here . 
  i think it is appropriate to use `` it was ahead of its time '' for rome . 
  the problem is they byzantine empire mostly collapsed after getting invaded by the turks again and again and internal strife . 
  in all my games i have never seen a successful turk invasion mostly due to the aforementioned blobassids . 
  that apparently are pretty content staying best neighbors with an christian empire . 
  it seems both could be true , since romans also used [ cataracta ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cataracta ) . 
  yet we are talking about a king here , so de facto is irrelevant . 
  depending on how strong was monarchy at that place , elsa could do whatever the hell she pleased , defacto or not , since in kings the de jure aspect of kingship is the most essential . 
  especially if it comes from god . 
  just read all about kings and queens that never bothered to govern , ever . 
  [ it depends ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acquired_taste ) on various reasons who can handle or not . 
  the most common si to have come in contact wth the smell/taste at a very young age . 
  there has been multiple monarchs in real life ( [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_ii_of_spain ) ) that they literally could not tie their own shoes , yet the institution of monarchy still was extremely strong . 
  absolute monarchy was a bit like having a literal `` god '' dictating laws . 
  they where untouchable and populations suffered extreme hardships and bad management until they had enough and rebelled ( usually backing a nobleman that he himself was noble probably with claim to the throne aka also a `` blood blood '' . 
  i did not say he was a good king , i said that he personally was still untouchable from any repercussions . 
  his nation , obviously not so much . 
  he was at best a regent . 
  regents have tried to usurp the throne multiple times in real life , and usually a civil war ensued since there where a lot of people that considered kings unmovable , even if they where bubbling idiots that spend all the nations military budget in wenches and ale . 
  well since it is glaringly obvious they copy pasted the european monarchies of the 17th and 18th century , its not a strech to assume the rest . 
  in the times of absolute monarchy , the king would never be accused for treason against the state since he was the * embodiment * of the state . 
  the frozen monarchy is pretty vanilla , so its irrelevant if the royals fucked goats or had magical ice power , they could not be accused of treason . 
  at best they could be replaced with a noble * that had right to the throne * . 
  you could * not * circumvent hereditary rights , thats the whole point of monarchy . 
  oh no what hans tried to pull out has be done multiple times in real life history also , but never with treason ( as we perceive it now ) as a reason . 
  and yes there are cases wher ethe pretender called `` divine '' rights to launch their attack . 
  there is a reason the pope , gods direct representative in earth was so strong in politics . 
  read the sidebar before posting . 
  `` take the fiction to its logical conclusion '' or you are going to have a bad time here . 
  hans could accused her that she was a douvle headed jackal . 
  however ge had no right to lock her up and only took advantage of the panic to stage a coup . 
  he did n't died at will . 
  some of the previous numenorian kings tried to hold on to life with any means possible , even allying with sauron and sacrificing people to avert their death . 
  what he says here is that * when * his time comes he will not try to postpone it in any way . 
  the historical context of the previous kings matters a lot in this one . 
  at first i thought this was a sci-fi post-apocalyptic anime inspired rts and i was fucking stocked . 
  then i saw the generic health bars and i understood what it really was . 
  for shame . 
  hah i thought kylo 's character was * heavily * influenced by joeffry with a mix of rots anakin . 
   do n't worry guys he 's way too far to get us with that flamethro -, 
  ftfy, 
  i dont know where these guys live but in etterbeek the whole process took a month tops , including the visit from the police officer , and since applications where done with appointments , we waited mostly 30 mins or so . 
  the only wait we did wa to receive the id at the end , bit since the process was instant oit was good . 
  obviously depending on the commune . 
  `` are you cherry picking your religious obligations !, 
  then you are not a true believer at all ! '', 
  i have never understood that argument in reddit atheism . 
  believing in god = / = religious practices . 
  you can have one without the other . 
  also you have people to check out if you are following your religious practices properly . 
  we call them * priests * . 
  not `` random redditors '' . 
  there are christians `` heresies '' that had different views on christ 's divinity and such . 
  also catholics and orthodox do n't have such a strict view of the bible for example . 
  religion is a complex issue and `` christian '' does n't equate the crazy american protestant offshoots . 
  you explanation pretty much reads as a tl ; dr version on why people do n't like it i would guess . 
   oh right , lots of it has to do with cultural norms and shit that is just fun or personally enriching . 
  you know , a big part of what religion is to many people . 
  pretty much . 
  because reddit atheism only knows the fundamentalist protestant ofshoots and medieval catholics . 
  in reality there are other parts that do n't have the same biblical literalism . 
  orthodox for example consider the old testament mostly a story of `` how we got there '' since christ came and fulfilled it . 
  the thing is , what you describe is a core happening of christianity , not an abnormality . 
  hell * paul 's letters * discuss these things . 
  technically it is the major reason why we have priests and the church , to `` guide '' the faithful . 
  if you point this to a christian his reaction will be `` duh ? 
  however you cant call one a `` fake believer ' when it is so integral . 
  that was my main point of contention . 
  you can call it whatever you want ( and i will probably agree with you '' but not inconsistent with belief and religion . 
  if the documentaries from nk do n't exaggerate shit , they do that . 
  workers in factories do stand attention while they listen to patriotic songs just before start working . 
  ahh cholera , the soldiers best friend . 
  make everyone feel badass when they shit themselves to death . 
   striped stockings .
