  it depends a lot on why the planet is `` hot '' in the first place . 
  if it is sunlight , others suggested either a space shade or increasing the reflection of the planet . 
  however , an extreme greenhouse effect due to a peculiar atmosphere could also be the case ( like [ venus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venus ) in real life ) . 
  so you could also terraform the atmosphere into gasses that either escape to space easily and/or do n't cause a greenhouse effect . 
  when did greece had a colony ? 
  ancient greeks colonized [ half the mediteranean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonies_in_antiquity#/media/file:ancient_colonies.png ) . 
  hardly `` one '' . 
  the only other other cases i can think could be [ tarpon springs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarpon_springs,_florida ) or [ new smyrna beach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_smyrna_beach,_florida ) in florida but those could hardly be considered colonies * of * greece . 
  yeah after a little [ digging ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/number-of-colonies-of-european-countries-map/ ) that map is utter bollocks . 
  apparently he comprised the map from [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_former_european_colonies ) list . 
  a list that counts 1/3 of italy and dozens of city states as * one * greek colony . 
  and totally ignoring the rest of [ the frigging mediterranean and black sea . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonies_in_antiquity#/media/file:ancient_colonies.png ), 
  check my [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/43azlh/total_number_of_colonies_of_european_countries_in/czgydo8 ) to op . 
   such highly civilized country such as armenia , libya ( 2012 ) , israel , bhutan , tajikistan and greece . 
  i really hope this is not sarcasm . 
  the stars there will have minimal difference ( if any ) from the ones we see from our backyards . 
  why waste time and/or recourses to take a picture that has zero value ? 
  for serious , scientific imaging of stars , we have * dedicated * tools for that , like hubble . 
  and we finally havea winner !, 
  ehhh the imperial reforms have very . . peculiar translations . 
  for example , `` reform * nomikos * law '' translates to '' reform * law 's * law * '' can you send me a list wat you where trying to say ? 
  ** publish the [ eparchikon biblion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/book_of_the_prefect ) ** : emperor gets -10 % building cost and + 1 diplomatic relations , and states get -10 % building cost and +33 % better relations over time ( meaning you burn ae faster ), 
  [ ** reform the tagmata ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tagma_%28military%29 ) : emperor gets +5 % discipline , and the member states get +15 % cavalry combat ability , and -15 % cavalry cost, 
  ** [ expand the juris civilis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpus_juris_civilis ) ** : emperor gets -1 unrest and +2 % missionary strength , and member states get -15 % core creation cost and +2 % missionary strength . 
  ** [ update the leges rusticae ] ( http://www.britannica.com/topic/farmers-law ) ** : emperor gets +10 % tax modifier , and the states get +10 % trade power and +10 % tax modifier . 
  [ ** dissolve the sygkletos ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_senate ) : emperor becomes hereditary and gets +1 yearly legitimacy , and the member states get +1 yearly army tradition, 
  [ ** appoint megas logothetes ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megas_logothetes ) disallows internal wars , and emperor gets +33 % relations over time , and states get +5 % discipline, 
  ** establish the themata ** * power of regional titles reverts to the emperor aka more centralization *, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autokrator ) ** : * as augustus proclaimed himself autocrator and turned himself into the ultimate ruler of the roman empire , its only understandable that this could be done to affirm your ultimate power and tie yourself with the roman empire of old . 
  there you go , i did my best to provide background , sources and some explanation . 
  most of the are highly ahistoric of course , but they do make some sense in context and the results they give . 
  if you have any questions go for it !, 
  i am just going to wait here fot the top debunking comment . . 
  this argument is thrown around a lot here and its old , tired and nonsensical . 
  `` no longer historical accurate '' includes from william losing that battle of hastings to ancient greek amazons from space taking over the byzantine empire in the name of ariadne and declaring space jihad to the norse . 
  i wonder what option people would prefer for the game . . 
  he is confused and thinks that the `` republic '' at the time was the same as republic today ( aka direct democracy . 
  ) , where all citizens vote , so you have to pay notice to their problems . 
  gravity falls !, 
  true , true . 
  liberal democracy perhaps ? 
  the empire that was centrered at constantinople stayed roman , vestigial senate , latin speaking and all jazz for centuries after the fall of the western part . 
  there even was an emperor that yried to bring back polytheism !, 
   they duped the entire country . 
  looking back , it should be the biggest scandal of politics in the last 80 years . 
  it all got lost amonst all this huge steamy smelly pile of shit of `` jet fuel cant melt steal beams '' conspiracy theories . 
  i mean , you have officials all the way to the president admitting that they they mislead an entire nation into war that has cost thousand of lives ( many more than 9/11 ) ** under false/constructed evidence ** pretty much a similar way of how a false flag works , and nobody gives a fuck !!, 
  ye the eastern roman emprie . 
  what u/shart _ gremlin posted above is also the case for most , if not all the sports that are based on judges . 
  they are not judged like it is a song contest reality show , it is very very technical . 
  there is a limited pool of routines , and all of them are done in a very specific way so it can be pretty clear how good they are at it . 
  imagine if you where a pro jumping jack judge . 
  you have very clear guidelines about the perfect jump , the hands should be totaly parallel in down position while have a palms length distance . 
  now imagine you have been doing this for a deacade . 
  how acurate you thing you would be ? 
  hell my mother was a figure skating fan , and after a couple of years she could understand if an athlete wa doing good or not . 
  and she hasent even been close to a skate ring in her life !!, 
  technically , those sports can be judged by a * single * judge , but to avoid the caveat you fear is why they have multiple . 
  ehh new vegas tried a lot . 
  i mean none of the endings are good , only slightly worse . 
  if they had time to flesh up the legion even more with quests it would be more obvious . 
  repopulation of rebelious populance in the other side offucking nowhere has happened since at least the roman empire, 
  yeah , they had the tendency to leave you be unless you created a ruckus . 
  then you where fucked , cough jerusalem cough corinth cough . 
  yep !, 
   basically , do you think we are good because of cash or because you truly mean it .

  its hilarious when i read bad comments about cabin in the woods and sucker punch and all their glorious 4th wall annihilation that people missed . 
   but the director wanted to make some sort of `` statement '' and kicked his audience in the nuts . 
  you might even say ... that he * sucker punched * them ? 
  it s an urban myth . 
  you could n't get mew in any way unless you participated in some nintendo pr stunts in the 90 's or traded with someone that already has it . 
  there are ways to get it him i think , but not that one . 
  op titles suck . 
  the issue with that thread is not prostitution per se , but the rampant sexism `` i just need women to fuck , and if they dont give it as easily as possible i will take from a prostitute '' . 
  apparently marriage and dating exist only so they can fuck , and since they can fuck without those hassles due to prostitution `` escorts are the best thing in life '', 
  i dont think he ( or most of the commenters ) chose to get out of the dating pool voluntary since they sound extremely bitter . 
  so i dont think they will stay out for long and not try to get back , and probably hurt someone . 
  they do n't need to dive down , there is [ special machinery on ships that `` pull '' the cable up to the surface ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qtk5wnq9e ) e . so they only need one special boat with mechanics and a glorified crane . 
  not exactly bank breaking venture for a country or a big company . 
  so edgy .

   invest in an independent expert for the `` etats des lieux '' . 
  do it !, 
  if she is weird about the blankets , you will have a lot of issues with the contract !, 
  if it is total , then it is on the cheaper scale , but not extremely . 
   terry nichols , who was involved with the oklahoma city bombing , identified as a sovereign citizen, 
  was n't mcveigh also pretty much an anitgoverment nut ? 
  if you mean an ( apparent ) greek couple enters a greek taxi in greece driven by an egyptian ( ? ), 
  then yes the title is accurate ... 
  also fake as shit . 
  hilariously , this is a good case of applying downvotes . 
  you are supposed to dowbvote comments that dont add something to the discussion / they are irrelevant , which * is * the case with this one , and not to `` punish '' . 
  however everyone ignores that , and even reddit itself is constructed based on this perception ( profile user karma available for all to see ) and they only pay lip service . 
  because for every single one of those you mention there are hundreds , possibly thousands of smart , hardworking motivated people that simply did n't have the luck to see their products/creations etc take off . 
  and these people might not only miss their chance of becoming a zuckerberg , but be even barely or even below the poverty level . 
  pointing one of those guys is like pointing someone that won the lottery . 
  it can happen to everybody , but the chances are minuscule . 
  i am not discretion their hard work , i am just pointing out that there are thousands of equal hardworking people but without their luck .
