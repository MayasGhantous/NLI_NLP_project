  hard work + luck  hard work, 
  insert `` we did not invade to conquer the people , we invaded to liberate you from you corrupted and oppressing regime '', 
  do you really realy think they are not dozens , maybe hundreds of products that are worth the money ? 
  really ? 
  zuckerberg is a fucking insane genius that create the perfect website ? 
  no of course not . 
  he was insanely lucky to create a social media platform with just the right parameter , at the perfect time ( when internet was finally becoming mainstream ) and the perfect place . 
  you know , like the lottery . 
  facebook is n't something extraordinary that other people could n't build ( or even may have already build something similar , but whereat so lucky ) . 
  applying a genius/hardworking label * retroactively * is very very bad . 
   more importantly for old landed families it was more important to maintain the family name and estate than it was to be fairest-of-the-fair to all the children . 
  because most of the medium to low leadership in sma are cool dudes , that have done quite a decent job , especially the last year . 
  then you got a guy in high positions with illusion of grandeur , going chest beating all over the place , antagonizing every non-imperium single entity in eve , witch hunting and bulling in alliance alienating the line members , and generally being a normal autistic eve player . 
  we have seen it again and again , an alliance going to the gutter from a guy that everyone is afraid to `` right click-kick '' until everything collapses . 
  its depressing experiencing it from the inside . 
  such a shame . 
  precisely the face that keeps coming in my mind these days . . 
  i think my butthole clenched so hard from the cringe i might have registered gravity waves . 
  crusader kings has a mod that more than captures the feeling . 
  its the closest we will get on a decent game of thrones game that truly captures the feeling of the series . 
  including ofcourse , incest !, 
  oh my god this is embarrassing . 
  hey as i said , it on the cheap , but not extremely or impossible , depending on the area and age of the building . 
  it gets saved by the ardennes . 
   what are they , nazis ? 
  since the ` muricans that froth about `` no freedom of speech '' europe are usually saying this by being fixated in germany 's holocaust denial laws , yes , i would say there is a good chance they are nazis . 
   well you can fit a good chunk of europe, 
  ahem ... a good chunk [ of * western * europe . . ] ( http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/8/8a/europe_regions.png/540px-europe_regions.png ), 
   some died , some were found and raised to become the primarchs and were eventually found by the emperor . 
  none died before they where found . 
  the only two primarchs we have no information for are two that had their existence and information completely wiped by the imperium history after they where found and had reunited with their legions . 
  this is exactly what happened with the euro referendum in greece this past summer . 
  almost every single media outlet and politician ( active or not ) of the last 30 years supported the `` yes '' campaing rabidly . 
  as a result , voter distrusted and moved to `` no '' in droves ( 60 % + ) . 
  funny is it was irrelevant , they still got the `` yes '' version . 
  how did this [ abomination ] ( http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/05/12/12/the-shard.jpg ) was ever approved then ? 
  valinor is not the afterlife , is a real tangible place , only far away and hidden from men . 
  for elves its the place where they chill , and where they were appeared if they died ( in the halls of mantos specifically ) since they cant leave arda , ever . 
  humans cant go there , alive or dead , they spirits leave this universe and none knows where they go . 
  while i agree with pretty much everything you say , speaking a slavic language 1000 + before any slavs appeared in the area might be a bit anachronistic . 
  also , if ( and it is a big if ) they ever spoke another language , it was many generations before alexander , and probably not in the urban centers . 
  because they where the ringbearers and it was given to them as an extraordinary gift , so the damage from their physical wounds ( and the psychological from the rings corruption ) be healed . 
  notice the * only * frodo and sam are allowed , and not merry or pippin . 
  what do you mean metaphysically ? 
  my point is that it is not lets say , another dimension or the equivalent paradise , but a part of the real world of middle earth . 
  the only metaphysical thing is that there is a `` magic road '' leading to it . 
  if i understand your quesrion correctly , since we where a small team ( or worked completely alone ) i have done both ( developing and then administrating the pages , support ) . 
  i dont know how great is the difference in bigger projects in every day tasks but i am guessing that an admin pos would be more preferable . 
  sounds pretty much what i have been advised before and i have done it , thats why i have built some stuff . 
  however at present i dont have the cash to `` quit my day job '' and these means a lot less time to expand my knowledge / build staff . 
  and i dont feel good about the quality of the work i have already to present it . 
  i mean take look at [ this ] ( http://www.gbiniou.com ) ( sorry for the auto music , clients request ! ) . 
  this is not presentable !, 
  so i need something to give some basic knowledge , even outdated , and i can expand on this . 
  i am in the usuall catch 22 i need experience to get a job , cant get a job without experience . 
  only worse !, 
  syntra looks good from a quick look on their website !, 
  i would love to be on the dev sidee of thing then , but if what you say its true , the managing sound easier to get into considering my previous knowledge and education ( management ) . 
  network administration doesnt sound my cup of tea from what i have read . 
  i have actually run it through the validator , so i know how problematic it is . 
  it has various things that i would not do so again , mostly using artisteer to generate the template , joomla and of course the flash banner , that took me a couple of months to make because i had to learn flash animation from scratch . 
  if i made it today , i would probably take the chance to use bootstrap and build the various modules with jscript and/or html5 . 
   but he would n't know if it was useful info he 's taking in or not . 
  pretty much what worries me !, 
   although , corn of the knowledge of good and evil has a nice ring to it , do n't you think ? 
  ehh it sounds a bit corny tbh, 
  umm both your reasons are very very minor in the great scheme of things . 
  one of the greatest issues everyone misses with the retaking of constantinople is what the fuck we are going to do with ** [ 14 fucking million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul ) ** turks currently residing in or around the city . 
  * this is almost one and a half the entire population of greece . 
  i think you can turn on item outline in the preferances , it might help . 
  hoo boy , while individual soldiers cant be judged just by the uniform they wore ( compared to the ss for example ) wehrmacht was also very very [ bad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht ) . 
  ] ( https://www.pixoto.com/images-photography/people/street-and-candids/grumpy-old-men-9367625.jpg ), 
  ehhh i think the quality of this pun thread has hit rock bottom . 
  if you cant adapt , you ca n't survive . 
  with a trout . 
   the only slaughter that happened was in cities like thebes, 
  he fucked the place so hard , there is a part of the modern city that has a name that is a derivative of `` fire '' , supposedly the location that alexander ordered the fire to start that obliterated the city . 
  exact same situation . 
  terrifying . 
  [ `` the comet sighted '' event exists at least since eu3 ] ( http://images.dealzon.com/europa-3-random-event-comet.png ) , and it even then it had different options with the same results -1 stability . 
  gameplay wise i presume it exists to throw a wrench in very stable countries , or completely disorganize countries on the tiping point . 
  its the equivalent on rolling 1 in tabletop games ( remember that eu originally [ was a tabletop game ! ] ( https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4102/europa-universalis ) ) . 
  so its existence is * not * just a joke and it was moved to eu4 as other aspects did without anyone really commenting on that at first , . 
  it has reached an in-joke status with the community in the last years , because we can share our common reaction when that fires , and it is never good . 
  like other games have infamous villains or enemies that their respective communities collectively adore/hate/adorehate , pd games will obviously have events in that role . 
  paradox acknowledging that and the community with a small event is a nice gesture imho . 
  there was a huge probavilty the soviets would invade anyways a couple of years down the line . 
  not a normal fan of tolkien will hold a grudge for you . 
  tolkiens book are celebrated just as why black asnd white silent films are celebrated : they where breaking new horizons , and where outstanding for their time . 
  but i would not take my date into one . 
  same situation with dune . 
  i think the best case to read those is young , before you had te to read their more modern equivelents . 
  what is so difficult ? 
  [ there you go . 
   nothing but space, 
   michael richards, 
  its like racism does n't go away if you simply change the word . 
  the underlying hate simply moves on tainting the word . 
   only difference is , ussr was far too pragmatic, 
  i do n't think you realize how close we came to nuclear war at some points .
