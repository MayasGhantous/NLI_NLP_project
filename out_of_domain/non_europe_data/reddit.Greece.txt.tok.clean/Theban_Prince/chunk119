  most infamous was the [ b-59 incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_b-59 ) during the cuban missile crisis , where only * one * out of three people stopped a nuclear weapon to be fired . 
  [ we had other close calls ] ( http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-cold-war-close-calls ) . 
  considering even a very limited nuclear exchange includes dozens of cities with millions of people vaporizing instantly , yeah . 
  if we are now scared about terrorism , nuclear war is soul destroying horrifying . 
  because if the people with the `` kick '' button do n't want to leave the imperium , there is not much you can do , even if the vast majority of the line members want to , which is not necessary the case , i dont think a lot of people want to help or at best not impend tishu , horde mordus etc . 
  and we cant leave sma because we have people we want to fight next to . 
  sma is two alliances in the same body : one part that goes from the medium management to the line members and believes that sma is a real alliance , and try to work based on this assumption , and a second `` alliance '' that is mostly the higher ups that believes that there cant be any sma without the goons . 
  i want to see frickng dynasty relations . 
  that simple think will change the entire game and make the retarded coalitions go away . 
  lol, 
  everyone wins . 
  mind you not an american , so not sure how it works , but is n't irs a federal level agency vs state law . 
  meaning since there is n't a federal law banning online gambling , you should pay your taxes so you do n't get busted in that level ( undisclosed income ) , but if you get caught by the * state * you will still face prosecution ( banned online gambling ) ? 
  irs will not prosecute you for breaking state level law , but i think if you get prosecuted by the state in the future they * can * request the forms you send to irs , providing evidence ? 
  socialist democracies = / = communism, 
   the imperium may very well split . 
  this is already the case , the answer is if it will continue and how much , and that depends on how the war goes and the perception of it . 
  depends on what level you are at . 
  in an alliance , the higher ups move and think on a strategic level , deployment of armies , logistics , propaganda , manpower , morale etc as they would do in a * multiplayer * ( big distinction ) grand strategy game . 
  mid level people , like for example most of the fleet commanders ( people that lead the fleets ) play like it is a real time strategy game , where situational awareness , knowledge of units ( ships ) stats and abilities , quick reaction and the ability to move groups of units * in perfect position can mean victory or defeat . 
  for the low level guys , which is the vast minority of the players , everyday is an rpg experience ( grinding , `` levelign up '' ) , with some mountain and blade ( in space !! ), 
  situation when they join big fleets , in which they are another face in the group and they usually spam buttons trying to kill the designated target before he kills them . 
  ** if those groups of units had the ai of ( usually drunk/high ) nerds dicking around playing a video game . 
  pretty much what pisses me off with all this glorification of co2 . 
  they have been allies with goons for how many years now ? 
  yet when shit hits the fun , they bail . 
  they did n't bail out earlier , they did n't bail out after , they did it at the most crucial moment to save their skin . 
  so from my perspective , if the whole war have n't happened co2 would have stayed in cfc for a long time racking up isk under papa goon protecting them . 
  yet if corporations bail out of their alliance when they hit a rough patch they are called `` highsec pubies '' that do n't have the guts to defend their space in pvp . 
  double standards a bit ? 
   but sma are dead . 
  this is a personal war . 
  sma will be fine if certain individuals get a certain bag . . 
  yeah but river decided to back him up with a lot of chestbeating so he is in the crosshairs also . 
  and biomassing * after * you alliance has took a beating kinda defeats the point . 
  eratosthenes * already * knew that earth was round . 
  he used that experiment to calculate the friggin * circumference * of the earth . 
  he was also '' . . the first to calculate the tilt of the earth 's axis . 
  additionally , he may have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day . 
  he created the first map of the world incorporating parallels and meridians , based on the available geographical knowledge of the era . '', 
   give your old beautiful place like the one you saw in the pics, 
  ehh at the time a lot of those places where either very old houses from the 19th century ( renovation of historical building was n't a thing at that time ) in the center of athens and a lot of other areas were still as they where from the smyrna refugees . 
  we did n't destroy that * much * , athens was unfortunate to hugely expand at a period when that style of [ architecture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) ( among others ) was in fashion . 
  it does exist , but also a [ lot of cities around the world have that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/height_restriction_laws#europe ), 
  or the same groups will reform in the first three days , and keep doing what they did in a matter of weeks . 
  the greatest upheaval would be in nullsov since people would scramble to take over space , but apart from major points of interest like the north right now , the rest will pretty much stay the same . 
  tl ; dr you can wipe the isk and skills , but the meta is still there . 
   ~ ~ pride ~ ~ winet killed sma, 
  ftfy, 
  kyle will always be a valued guy because he left with his head up . 
  you stole from random dudes on your way out . 
  so stealing is ok if the other guy is insured ? 
  huh , the more you learn . 
  what everyone is missing is how easy to lockdown systems is , with the grand example of tishu 's campaign in fade . 
  when people are not allowed to rat/mine/do their thing for weeks or months they are either are going to move to greener pastures or to stop playing altogether . 
  after that , adm level drop and the systems are easy pickings especially with the manpower drain . 
  at the start of the camping , sma was fielding 100 + fleets easily and fleets standing down for not enough pilots was unheard of . 
  things were quite the opposite by january . 
  since i done see even one duplicate , i think it is a demo by a specific group where each one got a role . 
   tbh i do n't think sma put any effort into trying to counter the camping they just hoped they would get bored and go away . 
  we agree on that . 
  for your other points , i think they are only temporary solutions and in limited camping situations . 
  if you have a dedicated enemy that can keep this for weeks/months this is not going to work particularly since they can field unknown numbers ( one day you get dropped by 20 bombers other day by 2 , next day it is 40 blops ) and choose when and how to engage freely . 
  [ i think you will enjoy this version .

  dude all propaganda aside , almost all the big alliances in game had scummed , kicked small groups to oblivion for fun , extorted renters and distorted the truth . 
  its how eve online is played on that level . 
  just none of them had done it on the level of mittani or more important , being so open and smug about it . 
  [ this ] ( https://galanoleykoblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/15/%ce%ba%ce%af%ce%bd%ce%b7%cf%83%ce%b7-%cf%80%cf%81%ce%bf%cf%82-%cf%86%ce%bb%cf%8e%cf%81%ce%b9%ce%bd%ce%b1-%ce%bc%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%b1%cf%83%cf%84%ce%ae%cf%81%ce%b9-5%ce%b7-%ce%bc%ce%b5%cf%81%ce%b1/ ) post * refers a description mentioning the 23st regiment ( and its creation during the draft ) in a battle in northern greece during the [ balkan wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_wars ) in 1912 when a coalition of balkan states defeated the ottoman empire . 
  however , you mentioned that the photo indicates the place as [ chios ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chios ) , so i am guessing the regiment was stationed there after the balkan wars and ww1 , and was in transit to asia minor for the [ greco-turkish war of 1912-1922 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_%281919%e2%80%9322%29 ) , which ended in disaster for greece . 
  this uniforms of the time in this image and [ this photo of the era ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0f/20/7b/0f207b53c2807c40c801ee0e13f1f98d.jpg ) match a lot with the one you have compared with the ones during ww2 where the greek army used [ quite different uniforms ] ( http://ww2greece.wargaming.info/images/troops01.jpg ) , particularly the [ combat helmets ] ( http://combathelmets.blogspot.be/2010/10/greek-m-34-39-combat-helmet.html ) . 
  ** mind you , that blog is a far right click bait shithole . 
  however the annotations of the transcript indicates they copied from another source , probably a military history book , unfortunately they have n't provided which .

  ick . 
  what we learned from this :, 
  river will kick 5000 members out instead of winet . 
  edit : that is outdated , more have left . 
  well , it took only one . 
   player 3 has joined the game <, 
  hence , why the mechanic is named `` time delation '' . 
  [ you are not the first to make that thoughts . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simulation_hypothesis ), 
   a hellenic identity did not supplant their roman identity until hundreds of years after constantinople was conquered . 
  eh what ? 
  while the nationalism exhibited during , before , and after the 1821 independence war of greece ( on par with the times ) indeed has no direct connection , culturally the residents of the empire self identified themselves culturally as greeks many centuries before the fall , and [ as * political * descendants \\ ( romans \\ ) of the roman empire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_greeks#self-perception ), 
   if you traveled back to ** 1444 ** and asked a resident of constantinople what `` culture '' they were , they would respond '' \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 '' ( roman ) . 
  `` eustathius of thessalonica disambiguates the distinction in his account of the fall of constantinople in ** 1204 ** by referring to the invaders with the generic term `` latins '' , encompassing all adherents to the roman catholic church , and the `` hellenes '' as the dominant population of the empire '' [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_greeks#revival_in_the_meaning_of_.22hellene.22 ) . 
  so no , you are completely wrong . 
   i expect that only concord could beat everyone . 
  the empires and concord do n't think so . 
  they are actually more than happy when capsuleers are shooting each other in the face for some remote systems all the way out there , instead of realizing their combined power could bring all of eve into its knees easily . 
  remember that capsuleers can use their star based economy and immortality to just , keep , coming , while empires have to protect their planets and when they die , most of them stay dead . 
  umm you argued . 
  you said that the depicting the culture as `` greek '' at the timeline is incorrect , while i showed you that no , greek or hellenes was used 200 years * before * your date to describe the culture , along with romans . 
  its pretty understandable that paradox would use the synonym that would not confuse players in its maps , but its completely correct and historical . 
  i absolutely love most of the short stories / [ chronicles ] ( https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/ ) and they are quite plenty . 
  from books i have never read one unfortunately . 
   destruction of thebes,
