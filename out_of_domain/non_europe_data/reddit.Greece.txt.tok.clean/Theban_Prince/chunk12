  there is always gravity in our solar system , and it is always a lot . 
  ability to create trade nodes?maybe ? 
  that sounds about right . 
  all you need to do now is get some zoroastrians in your family , and you have the epitome of awful family dinners . 
  whoa whoa whoa ... i am getting back to arkania !!!?? 
  wooohoo !, 
  welp there goes my sleep.thank you very , very for this grand prize !, 
  now how about you create a game called kingdoms of aventurine : sword of fate ( wink , wink ) with that beautiful looking tactical combat engine and retro hand drawn 2d graphics?but then you will have to find somewhere to store my heart , because you will have it . 
  aahhh we greeks.even our punishments revolve around dicks . 
  can you imagine going to the grocery store and see everywhere pages of your face with your new boyfriend/girlfriend ( that you like , but things are still a bit awkward between you too ) . 
  can you imagine opening a cold one , relaxing on the couch turning on the tv , only to find yourself looking at picture of your house and yourself , as you walked that morning to the grocery store looking like shit.you are in situations where you are dead tired and edgy , or you need to go to the bathroom real fast , or you have your date waiting for you , yet you have to play along with some fans you met in the street or someone will call you a snub . 
  holy shit this could be a horror film , yet for some people is their daily routine . 
  i never understand why people say that because vic 3 might be close , a converter has no reason to exist.first of all , there is 0 news about vicky 3 . even if it was announced now , it would need close to a year to release.so i do n't understand why they do n't make a vic2 converter.they could use the new substantial fanbase of euiv to sustain vicky 2 and build awareness for viky 3 ( if and when it comes ), 
  / u/lightsbane replied [ perfectly ] ( http://en.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1vvugi/brothers_if_you_do_this_it_reflects_badly_on_our/cewdk96 ), 
  i have n't played the new expansion , but surely the randomized landmasses create random trade nodes and roads?right?so it is doable to somewhat customized them . 
   or you were ~ ~ bad and ~ ~ not entertaining ... 
  you do realize this is satire and op is possibly ... you know ... a liar ? 
  `` game '', 
  [ this is a tagari ] ( http://www.tlife.gr/files/image/news/2011/ianouarios11/10-01/tagari4.jpg ) ( \u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9 ) . 
  it is a bag that was worn during the previous centuries so it is considered traditional garment.however during the 60s-80s and beyond , left leaning university girls wore them because it was not a `` masculinist , capitalist , '' bag like , say , a louis vuitton.usually accompanied with bad personal hugiene.bonus points if the `` tagari '' had the [ communist newspaper ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/el/d/d8/rizospastis-1946-09-01.png ) inside . the fun part is those girls when they have grown up would ditch the tagari for the mentioned luis vitton in a heartbeat . 
  from what i gather , they choose the really awesome and those that are so bad that its `` funny '' and `` hilarious '' to ridicule.this leaves out a huge range from simply `` bad '' to `` mediocre '' to `` good voice , bu it wont bring viewers '' . from his comments , he sounds like either `` mediocre '' or `` good voice '' . still way better than mine of course, 
  its a *** fucking parody ***, 
  nice , another dlc i do n't need to buy . 
  could they create a trade dlc?a baron/adventurer/mercenary / holy order dlc ? 
  of course not.we have to get elephants fighting aztec warriors in the streets of paris . 
  edit : down voting because i kill your buzz.nice . 
  crusader kings : a grand `` historical '' strategy game . 
  because i would prefer to stay its own game . 
  i love sengoku that does the same with feudal japan.but this game is called crusader kings.it is centered around europe , christianity , islam , knights , trebuchets and all that jazz.there are dozens of areas where they could improve the game ( still wishing to santa for a semi rpg expansion to come out ) yet they decide to add stuff that while nice , do n't make any sense.imagine if you played hoi iii and by the 7th expansion , ww2 took 10 % of your playtime.this is how i feel . 
  this expansion would be awesome for euiv by the way.asia needs some love . 
  i know most people will grumble `` just dont buy it '' and i will agree with them , but i am just saying my opinion same as guys that are screaming `` awesome '' in the other comments.so do n't downvote me to death . 
  there are dozens of times where i have pulled something seemingly ahistorical , yet i was surpised to learn that it either happened , or it was possible to do so.when i tried playing england , i had conquered almost whole of france , and i was `` yeah right '' . then i learned for the [ angevin empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angevin_empire ) and was pleasantly surprised.elephants in paris thu ? 
  yeah i know they had a lot of crusading knights there . 
   i do n't think they 'll open up baronies , holy orders or mercenaries , and adventurers would be difficult to pull off because you 'd have to lose all of your land and then be given a way back from it . 
  it 's possible , i guess , but i ca n't think of a fun way to pull it off . 
  same as patricians.instead of your mansion , you could have your camp where your soldiers stay , and you could improve it with training circles , treasury caravan , wooden watchtowers , camp followers etc etc.you get money from contracts , same as patricians get from trade posts and pagans from raids , or if you are holy order from `` banks '' or even the same looting mechanism ( mercs where notorious for this ) but only when you siege.a new casus belly would be broken contract ( like it already happens in the game ) or even better betray employer.a mechanism infamy like decadance could be used for chances to get employed/get attacked . 
  add a ton of personal events ( you had a fallout with your sergeant in arms !, 
  ) . it would be awesome !, 
  most of the great dynasties started from pretty low beginnings . 
  plus the aplpeal of the game is to trying to become the bigger fish count -  duke -  king -  emperor.adding another step would be nice . 
  but not crusades . 
   ere was actually the instigator of the crusades , so, 
  tried to keep themselves out of it as much as possible . 
   many if not most nobles did n't involve themselves in, 
  if richard i of england , philip ii of france , frederick i , alexios i komnenos and many many other powerful kings are just some noble minority then i must page some historians . 
  you mentioned islam.well islam is in the game because it is the main opponents of the crusades.it would have no place if it did n't . 
  thank you . 
  lets see ... i know about a dozen to twenty . 
  maybe even more . is that a nice sample ? 
  but i guess rajas of india : elephants in paris sounds better . 
  mongols are the exception . 
   the gameplay was ~ ~ devised ~ ~ stolen later . 
  i am sorry but angry birds was castle crashers with different textures.they did n't make it sleek , they did n't make it polished . 
  and while jewel puzlle games has its own genres ( [ zuma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuma_\\ ( video_game \\ ) ) comes to mind ) castle crushers was a unique creation . 
  yeah crush the castle series.i was deprived of sleep writing that . 
  i think it was the best from the trio of summer sci fi of 2013 . 
  after earth was fucking boring to death , and elysium was so heavy handed i think it broke my ps3 . 
  i did n't say it was a good movie.all of them disappointing me on way or another.at least elysium and oblivion are watchable.after earth has bad honor to be one of the movies that almost put me to sleep.the other was black dahlia, 
  i did n't put pacific rim in the line up because it was n't a generic sci-fi movie like the others.it has a special place in my heart.i think it is going to be one of these movies where 10 years from now we will say to each other : `` how did people back then thought it was n't awesome ? 
  '' . it did n't even got an oscar nomination for special effects for christs shake . 
  i think a corp just ceased . 
  apparently the lone ranger is better ; /, 
  so the console scores are more inflated = less value because there is n't that much diversity and competition.in the pc even the mighty minecraft gets 9 . 
  this is a ** good ** situation guys . 
  the same reason the first diablo , the first doom , tomb rider , the first mario , ultima online , world of warcaft etc etc are held at such high regard : they where genre creating products , that when they first come out changed the landscape of gaming . 
  minecraft was the first completely open ( huge ) world game , now you see dozens of block building games , but minecraft was the first to polish and pioneer the `` do what the hell you want '' game.it was also one of the first indie games to become a mega-hit . 
  so that helped the whole indie scene much , proving that small teams can make nice games.it was also one of the first games to utilize the early access system ( the it was called `` i make this nice game , can you help me quit my day job '' system ) . 
  i am sorry but from what i read , they wished for you to see * them * as nice guys , not their actions . 
  for example : the lich fireballs an orphanage . 
  while the wish stops you from killing the lich for doing that , it does n't stop you from putting out the fire/saving the orphans right?and then say to your lich '' oh hey dude , i know you did n't meant harm , but i had to put the fire out , because , you know , orhans . 
  i bet you do it by accident because you are such a cool bro '' . if they kill an innocent , you ca n't stop them , but you can heal , raise them . 
  and finally i think your god would be really pissed with them for forcing his paladin do/ignore such things . 
   and was a semifinalist . 
  what did the other kids do?build a rocket for the moon and brought back moon rocks?because this is the only way anyone could top getting a private interview with the first human being in another planetary body . 
  first of all i will try to find shelter and food.monasteries / churches where as always good places for the homeless.i would probably do n't need clothes since what i am wearing ( black cotton pants/cotton hoodie ) do n't look out of place , but i would had to probably rip/cover any tags.while i know pretty good english , its not my first language , and ye olde englishe would probably be worse ( bonus point : y was used instead of `` th '' ) so i would say that i am a poor traveler from greece running away from the ottoman heathens . 
  then i would either probably get some back-breaking job to the monastery/local lord , until i get better with the language/learn about the world around me ( who is the current king?that will help me pinpoint some issues coming.i think at 1500 it was henry vii so i will try to get protestant/anglican as fast as possible , and leave any city if the local peasants get unruly . 
  ) . of course this will force me to be a serf , meaning i ca n't leave from where i work , ever . 
  so then i will try to get close to nobility , by finding a servant job in the local manor , a very prestigious job for peasants.my present studies ( hospitality industry ) will help me with that and my knowledge of reading even better . 
  next stop , becoming someones lover.since i would be a pretty tall healthy male in his mid 30 's by then , with good health , i will fuck my way to the local noble.then i will try to give some solid advice.is the local lord supporting the boleyn 's ? yeah that 's good , but you should probably ditch them after the second miscarriage.or is not henry but mary on the throne?you should probably help that bastard , elizabeth to get the throne.if i get the family to be supporters of the successful kings/queens , they will get more titles/power , and me will get even closer to the top.my goal would be to get an advisory position to the king . 
  now comes the fun part . 
  i can continue if you like . 
  so what project won?do you remember ? 
  the psychological trauma lingers you.whenever you try yo use a normal dev you are scared the gang-drm will happen again . 
  when you try to discuss it with others , they tell its your own fault , you wanted it with your slutty personality , you forced those publishers to do that for their own security . 
  so , to feel better , you turn to find devs in bad neighborhoods.you start to enjoy devs in back alleys , with flashy pimps like p-bay hooking you up.you know it is illegal , and sometimes the devs are sick , or not able to do the job , and you are tired of p-bay 's political arguing , but what you are going to do?at least you are not violated . 
  well by definition , only people with close genetic code will stay the same ... and the virus could be still there so any offspring they had that are far removed ( like second cousins ) will still get mutated . 
  the joffrey trait . 
  he more like octavian augustus actually . 
  hey i was once a peon.while most looked down on us , on meta level it is a good starting point to shed your carebear neuroses.most could n't handle 0.0 but for others like me it helped.my peon corp is now part of the big game . 
  you cant speed things up.but what he means is that you can get a role in a fleet pretty fast , and make some decent amount of money in about 2 months . 
  eve is not a level based game where a 80 lvl player has ginormous advantage over a 10 lvl.also bigger is n't better , battleships for example that take some months to get into properly , can get killed by a small team of 1 month old players with 1/10 the cost in ships.its not what you drive , but how and when . 
  you have a pc space/exploration/economy `` simulator '' with some of the nerdiest and most hardcore fanbase in gaming history and make a pay to win , generic , fps game for a soon to be obsolete console . 
  what could be possibly go wrong ? 
  an enemy turncoat in a very high position obliterated one of the ( then ) biggest alliances in eve , bob , in one night.he auto destroyed ships , opened their `` lands '' to attack and gave access to forums where vital information was held , more importantly how the higher ups were looking down upon the lower members . 
  about wis. . how would you feel if it was implemented now , after a couple of years of expansions focusing on the spaceship part of eve and with no aurum fiasco ? 
  it could be , i found it kinda boring.however from all the spin-offs eve could get this is the most bizarre . 
  in 2000 years some future archaeologists will find the fossilized remains of that pier and he will be puzzled for their purpose.then they will notice that the sun lines up perfectly 2 times a year and they will propose the place was a holy temple where we used it as a calendar and to commemorate the two holy days of our religion . 
  games like dust make me sad.when i play game that are obviously money grabbing clones or pay to win scams , i just do n't care.however dust had so much potential if done right.it could be eve on planets , blowing other mmofps out of the water , and give as an avatar based game in the eve universe way better than the aborted fetus wis was . such a same .
