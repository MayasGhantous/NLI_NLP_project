  12/335 never forget . 
   he viewed all the races of middle earth as we see animals, 
  so melian was a zoophile , the equivelent of jane goondal marrying a chimp ? 
  wtf ? 
  umm do they realise that pyramids are the most basic shape you can build right ? 
  technically it is a huge pile of stone . 
  there are way more intricate designs mere centuries after the pyramids . . 
  alien invasion stories are fantastical retellings of real life invasions ( or fear of ) . 
  one of the first ( if not the first ) alien invasion stories , war of the worlds , was actually a different spin on the `` foreign nation invades england '' genre that was very popular at the time . 
  also in the books he draws direct parallels between the alien invaders and british colonialism . 
  so your british raj comment was on point perfectly , it is integral part of the genre . 
  i see no reason why you are getting downvoted . 
  i only answered with factual information about your train of thought . 
  it actually made * more * sense instead of coming to earth for water . 
  and they where n't aliens per se , i think they where actually rogue ais . 
  they could be malfunctioning von neumman probes . 
  if you see natural elements like leaves , and curves , [ its art nouveau ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/musical_instrument_museum_exterior.jpg ) . 
  if it is more bombastic and `` simpler '' in [ small details ] ( http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5515/6241/e58e/ceba/3f00/012a/medium_jpg/wikipedia_user_marduk__times_square_building_rochester.jpg?1427464749 ) witch exaggerated basic geometrical shapes , its art deco . 
  obviously there might be overlap sometimes . 
  / u/jordanledoux conceded wayy to easily . 
   the objective is to help ecosystems rebound back to their pristine state ,, 
  what is a `` pristine '' state ? 
  sahara used to be lush a few millennia ago , now it is desert . 
  which one is the default `` pristine '' state ? . 
   than if they were influenced by natural variation alone, 
  ecosystems will never be the same as they where , or how they are now . 
  humans are part of those ecosystems , that we change them is only natural as other species do ( if way slower ) since essentially we * are * a natural variation . 
  we want to preserve them as they are now because its only for our future well being . 
  case in point. , a small thought experiment . 
  if we found a way to be sure humans can survive and prosper as they do now , under different harsh conditions , * why * we should care about the environment ? 
   pristine , by definition , is relative to human involvement - that is , a pristine state is one that mirrors the ecosystem without any anthropogenic influence, 
  and ofcource , this distiction is made and judged by none else than humans . 
  so * we * judged that * we * are something other than a natural part . 
  even the definition of ecosystem is a pure human construct . 
   so what if we want to preserve them now for our future well-being , among various other reasons ? 
  it is unlikely in the near future that humans would be able to prosper independently of the environment ; we depend on the environment for literally every resource we use . 
  we should care about it because the condition you have described is not readily possible yet , aside from other subjective or personal reasons, 
  we are already transforming an entire planet . 
  terraforming is a very viable situation in the next centuries ( technically its possible already ) . 
  another viable solution is genetic engineering , human modification by machines , laboratory produced food et al. 
  this and more are not science fiction prepositions , they already happening . 
  so it is possible we can break our bounds from this planet and maybe even expand to another one . 
  if we do so , lets say in the next 100 years , is it bad to nuke every every square inch of earth , and if yes , why ? 
  there are two sides in this debate . 
  one side has thousands of medical professionals from multiple countries and organizations , the other side has b-grade/has been celebrities and hearsay from moms . 
  could there be complications by some vaccines ? 
  * highly improbable but not impossible . 
  will i look to learn about it from random people ? 
  no , i am not dumb as a brick i will wait from the pros . 
  * its infuriating when people lump together `` vaccines '' when in reality there are a lot of differences on how things work for each disease . 
  its like discussing about drugs and lumping together chemotherapy and paracetamol because they are both `` drugs '' . 
  if i slapped a random kid everyone would be okay if the father punched me . 
  but a guy scaremongering in national television potentialy endagering the lives of thousands of kids ? 
  nah we dont want to be barbarians . 
  i am with you dude . 
  are you arriving or leaving ? 
  at some point in the levels there are geiger counters . 
  use them to see how really bad you are . 
  also i think that if you get irradiated past a certain amount , you dont die immdietly , but ou do die a bit later . 
  i really wished the chinese chick in the series was a eastern roman princess instead !, 
  it would make much more sense , maybe set up how the norse learned about the empire and hint how the varangian guard started and so much more !, 
  not showing the ere at the hight of its power is such a loss . 
  are you using fixt ? 
  it has some big bugs . 
  can you please tell me exactly your actions ? 
  damn . 
  well , that makes dawn of the apes way more plausible . 
   fuck , even ancient egyptian women are depicted with clothes on . 
  meanwhile in the opposite side of the sea ] ( http://www.dollhousebettie.com/images/b/blog/posts/auto/36/r/minoan-palace-scene.jpg ), 
  friendly tip : they all refer to the cooking way , however they are not the same thing . . 
  soon ^ ^ tm, 
  all player owned stations . 
  unless they complete change very core aspects of the game like npc agents and skill book seeding i do n't see npc station going away . 
  there is a specific version of the xl that is way better than the base one , and i think it costs a lot also . 
  only one can exist in eve at anytime . 
  this could be a pices of tile as others suggested , or it is a left over piece from a a stone block that had been cut in slices . 
  i have seen many of those from marble . 
   in gorilla warfare, 
   nor is the current dynasty related to the normans . 
  this is not true . 
  she can actually trace her linage all the way back to [ william of normandy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/descent_of_elizabeth_ii_from_william_the_conqueror ) himself . 
   i am christian and i do understand the points they make ,, 
  what points they make that have remotely any christian connection ? 
  can someone point me what scriptures they use to think that ? 
  is this ... is this a snl skit ? 
  this is so vanilla its cute . 
  pretty much . 
  when you have scat porn , midgets , really hardcore stuff like dudes choking girls , crossdressing midgets , diapers , midgets with diapers , seeing cartoon japanese girls get fucked is pretty vanilla . 
  its the opposite , eve at the early years had total crew in teh description . 
  then for some years they got silent and kinda brushed it off , and then they brought it back . 
  you crew does n't target/fire your turrets , but it probably does small time maintenance , moving ammo from the cargo to the reloading area , kicking fedos out of the airlock and other fluff . 
  also capsuleer ships require a * very * small percentage of crew compared to a normal ships . 
  imagine if for a real life aircraft supercarrier , instead of 5000 + crew you only needed 200 . 
  from my viewpoints it like it how sharks have tiny fish that live on their skin and teeth . 
  finally it has n't been 9 years , there was a chronicle describing the results of a crew members travel ( or the disastrous result of ) with a capsuleer ship that came around 2011 or something . 
  no it was not clear skies , it was one of the official short stories `` chronicles '' that are available even now in the eve website, 
  edit : it was this [ story ] ( https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/all-these-lives-are-fit-to-ruin-1/ ) . 
  from the chronicles coming right after that give fluff for the pi and incarna mechanics , i am guessing it was published somewhere around the 2010-2012 range . 
   some people even seen fallout : tactics as a bad game, 
  that game has been mostly vindicated for its own merits .
