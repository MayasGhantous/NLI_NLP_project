  she had no real proof that * all * predators are reverting on their primary instincts ( even the doctor that is with the captives says she does n't really know what is going on ) yet she immediately jumped to conclusions , she treated predators exactly how others treated her and broke the city in the process . 
  pretty understandable she felt guilty . 
   grandfather paradox . 
  grandfather paradox is not a paradox if every time travel is on a separate mirror universe . 
  nope . 
  you have two universes : the original one , where your grandfather survived and one where you killed him . 
  that why we call it multiverse . 
  in theory you can travel between the two ( one where your grandfather is dead and one where he is ok ) at will . 
   how are you arriving at there only being two ? 
  if that was the case , then it would be infinite , not just two . 
   and how do you propose getting back to the starting point ( your universe ) ? 
  if i had a semi realistic answer to that , i would have discovered time travel . 
  however , in this hypothetical game , if you are able to select the time and place so you are able to kill you grandfather , then you have the power to choose where you want to go precisely . 
  you can visit both timelines at the present time . 
  since you originally went from universe a to universe b , there is no reason not to be able to ho from universe b to a. 
  your staring time has no spexial value in this scenario like in the movies . 
  why would it need to be a completely different universe ? 
  if the multivrse theory applies to our universe with our rules , so you can travel , the it should apply to universes with identical rules , no ? 
  might not be very scientific , but i would describe that stance as it is understood in the vast majority of the animal kingdom , as the `` come at me bro ! '', 
  stance . 
  what doez time dilation and speed of light have anything to do in our theoritical hypothesis ? 
  we are not discussing if time travel is possible from a mechanical point of view , we are talking about paradoxes . 
  pardon my mistake then . 
  parallel universes . 
  your blowtorch doesnt budge because it is essentially a gas cloud on fire . 
  its composituon is not rigid enough . 
  with enough material it will exert force ( purely in theory ) . 
  depending on the composition of lightsabers blade ( plasma ) i think not , but we also need to take into account the forcefields that hold the plasma in place , that probably have effect when interacting with materials . 
  so yes . 
  so you are offering an alternate solution for the grandfather paradox . 
  i think he means the opposite . 
  in europe if you punch a wall your hand is going to have a baaad time . 
  the vast majority is stone or poured cement . 
  stone houses are more common in northern/western europe where earthquakes are very very rare . 
  in comparison , greece , which has tectonic activity on par with japan and california the huge majority of buildings are built with reinforced poured cement . 
  i am not an electrician , but from what i have seen they have pvc pipes in the walls placed there in the initial contraction . 
  yes if you want to change something it is a pain in the ass . 
  in greece for example , these are the typical [ buildings ] ( http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c94/gm2263/athens%20skyscrapers%20and%20modern%20architecture%206/athensskylinelowrises-fromhiltonhotel-small1000x.jpg ) you will see . 
  there is a reinforced steel skeleton ( example [ here ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-wxmlvu6eu/vbm3du59-2i/aaaaaaaab7y/klik7-fesxa/s1600/construction%2btiny%2bhouse%2bconcrete.jpg ) , notice the protrusions on top ) and on top of it they pour cement with [ big cranes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owp08r4yhvk ) . 
  the walls between support pylons are set with bricks , and then cement ( or another insulating material that is equally hard , but the english word escapes me ) is plastered on top of them . 
  a good example is this [ photo ] ( http://greece-estate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/128702.jpeg ) so you can get a picture of how they are set up . 
  they can vary from multilevel buildings or single independent houses . 
  greece has frequent earthquakes so its enforced by the law to build like that . 
  just in 1999 [ a fairly big one hit right next to athens .

   biggest power in new eden is a third party gambling website ... 
  and for me that is sad . 
  life is not an actiin movie . 
  if you shoot someone in the leg they will either bleed to death or at best lose that leg . 
  especially with assault rifles . 
  for ghandi it worked because in real life most people feel bsd when a dide gets whackef . 
  in eve that is the only reason you play the game . 
  or you know at worst taser him ? 
  just not 15 times . 
  because it is money made ouside the game , pure and simple . 
  you skill training queue , your pvp skills , your corp recruitment skills , your logistics organisation , endless time trying to find the best fit are irrelevant . 
  the only thing you need is a sucessfull third party app and you won eve . 
  it is not that it doesnt require work to set up one , but that is mostly out of the game . 
  the ultimate triumph of the meta game , pay to win on an alliance level . 
  edit : this not a pro goon viewpoint by the way . 
  it would be sad if it have happened to pl , test or any other alliance andd that uses in game mechanics to curve their own personal victory, 
  umm this is not real life thu its * game * no matter the buzzwords . 
  if you want a rl comparison , would you be ok if your favorite team/player lost lost to a completely untrained dude because he found a way to bend the rules ? 
  if eve is a life simulation , i am talking about someone that uses powers * out * of the simulation . 
  oh shit my cloakk has failed ! 1, 
  this not a critism about how hard or easy is the game . 
  tell me something , if i went and bought a bunch of plexes with real $ to pay a merc alliance to win a war for me , is it pay to win yes or no ? 
  why do you even bother to reply ?

  ehhh dude , during the black death period most of the people felt they where living the apocalypse . 
  not the '' its coming guys in 2012 ! '', 
  but that it had actually started and in progress . 
  you cant get more dark and glum from that !, 
  ehhhh i would prefer to never knew . 
  it felt so taris . 
  mraning i busted my balls only for the end to be tragic .

  the '' * all * the predators * might * be turning bad '' is what matters . 
  she had no idea if this is the case since her opinion was based on hearsay , from a criminal . 
  15 people is far from a solid sample , and even if it was , its not her job to describe what is going on . 
  this was an official press conferance . 
  every word is under scrutiny ( and she knew it , hence her anxiety ) yet she was blabbering about things she had absolutely no idea about ( she is no doctor , period ) and voiced personal opinions . 
  and it was total chaos as a result . 
  even if she * was * right , spreading panic is hardly what a decent police officer wants to do . 
  what made me angry about that scene is why noone stopped her and felt as a shoehorned conflict for the plot . 
  which in retrospect made perfect sense based on who is the big bad of the movie . 
  do you know tv tropes ? 
  i hope you dont because i am at a point tgat i am watching something but get distracted because i cant wait for it to finish * so can read about it there * . 
  its an addiction . 
  yep !, 
   italy was unable to defeat yugoslavia, 
  ehh you mean greece right ? 
  edit :, 
  [ greece was at war with italy for 5 months ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-italian_war ) since october 1940 . 
  italy along with germany declared war to yugoslavia in 2th of april 1941 and concluded the war by april 17th . 
  5 months versus 15 days .
