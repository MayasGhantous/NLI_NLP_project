  singed : a concerned greek . 
  erebus is latin , not english , ever . 
  in greek it would be erebi . 
  yes you are right.i stand corrected . 
  usefull info of the day : any ~ ~ big ~ ~ huge explosion will create a mushroom . 
  hah , while your quotes are correct , actually there is a greek plural word to erebus : erebi / ' \u0395\u03c1\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7 . 
  i ca n't think of a english word describing it , but is is close to `` cold darkness '' . 
  source : i am greek . 
  however advocating for them will increase public awareness and help governments / corporations to fund research for them without a social stigma . 
  `` we want to divert funds for thorium reactors research '', 
  `` reactors?like , * nuclear * reactors ? '', 
  `` well something like that but - '', 
  `` fuck no ! '', 
   if the potential for something 's failure exists to a point that it could wipe out an entire civilization, 
  what?how?nuclear meltdowns are creating dangerous areas around them and create higher risks for cancer in a large area , witch is terribly shitty of course . 
  but even if all rectors went meltdown it would n't end civilization by far.nuclear rectors are not nuclear bombs . 
  i would like to add that both major nuclear accidents chernobyl and fukushima happened due to human interference.in chernobyl they run a drill with inexperienced personnel , turned off major systems and then ignored the alarms screaming.in fuckusima it was the bad planning of the reactor.if you build your emergency generators below sea level * right next to the ocean in a tsunami prone area * , you deserve to get strapped in a uranium rod and die by radioactive burns . 
  have you see the fatalities caused by co2 inhalation and ratiation from charcoal factories?even if nuclear incidents did happen ( which are n't , the only major was chernobil that was almost a deliberate accident , since they did every single think wrong , ) they would be still better.and you are confusing nuclear * weapons * ( submarines ) with nuclear energy . 
  thats ... not actually true.a true money sink is something that destroys production i.e. 
  pirates , 0.0 warfare etc. . . 
  turning cash into items still keep the money into the system unless they are destroyed . 
   sorry , no . 
  nuclear power is used to propel submarines . 
  the latest one that sank was the kursk ( sp ? ) . 
  sorry , no.nuclear reactors are used in submarines because the subs carry nuclear weapons , and the reactor allows them to stay underwater almost indefinitely , so they have better chances to survive a nuclear war and deliver their payload.hence , nuclear submarines and their reactors are weapons.nuclear weapons are * bad * . plus the total nuclear subs that have sunk are about 8 , and none have created, 
  however nuclear energy for civilian use are a good crutch until the alternative sources of energy are mature enough for us to use them in full effect.as for npr , i have no idea what that is , since i am a european . 
  a pretty respectable source thu : [ 1 ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/ ), 
  when you take those items , you have 3 options : either storage them somewhere forever ( money sink ) , use them , and have a chance to lose them ( money sink ) or sell them to make money ( not a money sink ) . 
  i am actually living in the balkans ( greece ) and my gf has to get theroid examinations this week.it is nothing serious , and quite possible not connected to chernobyl but there is a slim chance.so there you go.i still fervently support nuclear research and development . 
  [ it is . 
  however tapered glass is not common in shops.becasue it breaks too easily . 
   tempered glass is stronger than nontempered glass, 
  yup , my bad . 
  i imagine the genie feels used from every mortal.i alway saw an analogy of women that are sex slaves . 
  if you freed one , i do n't think, 
  thank you sex would be an option . 
  i think he meant memories outside of matrix, 
  honey * has * anti bacterial properties . 
  canis majoris roughly translates to big dog . 
  according to ghost , appropriate name for a huge star . 
  i am going to be that guy.when you are firing missiles towards a planet , you should point them towards the behind of the ship ( retrograde ) instead of down . 
  then they will have to shoot the missiles in front of the ship . 
  it can be done without hundreds of americans.a double agent from a us agency inside al qaeda could plan and use the organization to execute it , without al queda even knew it was used.the genius is that either if they succeeded or failed , it was a win win situation.if they failed , the agencies would get a boost for stopping a major terrorist act in us soil.if they succeeded ... well . 
  i think i created a new conspiracy theory . 
  yeah.kerbal has ruined a lot of scifi . 
  hard scifi is even worse , like gravity for example ( why all the stations are in the same plane ?!, 
  he actually described my general strategy for winning the game.send the huge evil tiger to the village to depopulate it , the send fireballs from heavens to finish the job . 
  then the creature curse hit and raged quit . 
  remember never to kiss you in the cheeks . 
  worse than take it away.it made it the exact opposite of what you tried to make it.you wanted a huge * black * * angry * ** tiger ** ? here is your ^ fluffy ^ ^ rainbow ^ ^ ^ kitten instead, 
  i got mine 2 years ago at 26 . 
  2 years earlier than my father did . 
   104 miles, 
  holy shit dude !, 
  actually it sounds awesome . 
  come to europe man . 
  next time you take a 106 mile trip it will be considered an exotic trip . 
  [ you can literally travel between 4 countries for almost half the driving distance . 
  sure.if you understand why i created this subreddit and not be a douchebag . 
  not possible.they are all dead . 
  odysseus , instructions unclear , used real horse . 
  well according to homer , the vast majority were slain by the greeks and some few like cassandra were taken slaves.so nobody would answer in the halls of troy after the horse have done its job . 
  i did n't say it was rubbish , it was actually pretty much the best looking space movie since space odyssey , but that made the faults much more glaring.if i am watching star wars i am not going to worry my mind with inclinations , relative speeds and other serious stuff , they have aliens playing bagpipes for christ shake !, 
  it is really not that harder than other hobbies . 
  what really makes her extraordinary is a ) a good camera b ) a good eye for photos c ) good grasp of photoshop and d ) she is gorgeous.its not about time , its about knowing what you are doing . 
  pretty much . 
  i like your kind of hippieness . 
  most hippie kind of people would actually have the `` people take resources like food , consume them , and all we produce is nasty sewage '' as a mantra . 
  can you imagine how dangerous and dirty this area would be?we are talking about almost total darkness for most of the day , heavy smog and countless nooks where illicit operations would thrive.blade runner would be a documentary . 
  vikings did n't wear helmets with horns ^ sorry ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ guy ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ awesome, 
  the zombie craze has n't died down for the last 40 years.it ebbs and flows . 
  if the sequel is a fresh take in the zombie genre like the first one it will be good.i f not it will bomb . 
  these painting shows a society that * really * ignores the word `` efficiency '' . 
  i doubt they have prioritized electric engines that much . 
  if you feel god , i knew he was talking shit from the start . 
  these places look hardly like they were made by an exterior designer with organic solutions in his textbook.they are huge blocks of stone and a little bit of glass . 
  at least they use a somewhat proper name , considering it is from the dutch language . 
  we are called in a completely foreign language for god 's shake ( greece ) . 
  define `` independent thought '' . 
  i do n't quite understand what you are saying , but i have the suspicion that you have heard others saying something about the quality of the camera.are you telling me [ this camera ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/kodak_disposable_camera%2c_front_view_-_img_0992.jpg ) would take the exact same picture like [ this camera ] ( http://froknowsphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/d4_50_1.4_front34l-992x1024.jpg ) ? 
  of course , training also matters a lot . 
  i am not a downer , neither i tried being smart ass . 
  i thought it was obvious actually !, 
  these buildings are inefficient , no matter what you want to call it.the energy requirments to ventilate , light , clean and operate ( i cant imagine the building costs ! ), 
  one of these monstrosities would make the energy footprint of burj khalifa look like a hand crank generator . 
  and that , is not speculation . 
  thank you for finding a great answer for me . 
  i would also like to add that the original artist loves to make smog filled steampunk dystopias . 
  obvious [ here ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/350/4/7/dark_satanic_mills_by_peteamachree-d350rz8.jpg ) . so kudos to the artist that communicated with me with zero words . 
   it can be anything, 
  uhhh exactly . 
  i have to see utopias everywhere?i am not criticizing the work i am merely stating the obvious.show me a painting with [ a beautiful shiny city ] ( http://74fdc.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/1-vegetalcity.jpg ) and i will go on with it !, 
  my newborn : / r/gifscritics / . 
  a place where you can post reviews about any work of art , but here is the catch : your review must contain a gif/picture detailing your feelings about the work . 
  its pretty empty right now , and yesterday i think i approved a 12 year old for mod ( hardly roger ebert , i know ) , but it has potential for some nice debates . 
  bonus points : i need mods.i you feel you like it message me.first 3 to mail me with a coherent message will get mod status , no questions asked . 
  maybe it is like the force prophecy about the one bringing balance to the force . 
  hey if the previous [ pope was him ] ( http://deathandtaxesmag.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/557736_422637897752228_201900393159314_1897599_1199028185_n.jpeg ) , then the current one is luke ? 
  or maybe peter , i do n't know . . 
  you can count on me , [ / r/no context !,
