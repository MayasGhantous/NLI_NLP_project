  so while that rule might prolong the game somewhat it helps fix that inherent problem . 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4y64t5/family_game_night/d6lgcc3 ) comment further down explains the imbalances of the game and how players tha know them can exploit them . 
  sorry to rain on your parade , but as other have pointed out , the weapon he uses is an exaggerated [ blunderbuss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blunderbuss ) . 
  the quiver and arrows are in his back because he uses other weapons as well . 
  despite that problem with your theory , my own head canon from now is that he started bullying belle and her father and name calling them , ( contest theory or not ) . 
  he seems a pretty straightforward jock/bully stereotype , so its easy to assume that he would be the first to make fun towards things he cant understand ( belle 's reading and her fathers inventions , you know , science/geeky stuff ) . 
  the town people followed , but without maurice they might not be so condescending and vitriolic with the family and maybe even support them . 
  the video even supports it because he is the one initiating the song , and the bystanders follow . 
  this dude looks a lot like girl , even for his age . 
  are we sure `` he '' was n't pulling a mary reed ? 
  avatar is not hard sci fi by any definition of the word . 
  war between germany and the soviets was inevitable and both countries knew it . 
  hitler considered the main battle was versus the russians , instead of the west . 
  both iwo jima films are great . 
  flags of our fathers is not that groundbreaking because it is about the us side that has been done a lot . 
  90 % died in the grear waror its aftermath . 
  roaming bandits , slavery and even canibalism are pretty commonplace and most of the world is still irradiated on some level meaning good luck not dying in your 40s by cancer . 
  or simply a bad cold because medicine is not existent . 
  nuclear bombs are scary yo !, 
  spore had the exact same reception as no mans sky . 
  it was one of the first instances of coordinated online brigading . 
  older players see this present debacle and simply see it as another day in a pattern that have been there for at least a decade . 
  daikatana , spore , the first years of duke nukem development , fable etc etc. 
  this is ( neo ) colonialism and always existed . 
  what we have now is markets from places that just 100 years ago where controlled by the west ( china , india , s korea ) and more in the future , like certain countries in africa if stability increases . 
  this a direct result of globalisation , since technology , expertise and materials are easier than ever to move around the planet . 
  i think it is implied that he didnt do * all * those stuff alone but some where done by guys in his unit and he participated/witnessed them . 
  you forgot one major point . 
  they think they caught the murderer . 
  those pieces of paper will prove she had an accomplise , reopening the investigations and interogations . . 
  she had flaunted from west point and wanted to drop the rest of her responsibilities to go to amsterdam . 
  i can see a strict military general letting her 1 year in jail so she can get her head straight ( not that i agree ) . 
  it was always like that , even in ancient times . 
  athletes were rewarded by their cities , even moreso since a win at the time had political/propaganda value since most of the participants were at war with each other more often than not . 
  think the usa-soviet duel of the 80s , only with all the teams participating . 
  ancient athletes where what we would consider today professionals . 
  they received a lot of rewards from their home towns , and by the roman era they would make a living by going to various cities and their tournaments and living with the monetary rewards they received . 
  do n't confuse the * ideal * of the olympics with reality . 
  humans are humans . 
  some sources :, 
  yup . 
  in real life [ he was way better ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_blithe ) than how we was portrayed , he was a career soldier until his death ( he died in 1967 , not 1946 as stated ) participating in the korean war . 
  his story is the most major historical inaccuracy in the series . 
  nobody should blame the soldiers for the reasons you gave but ambrose , or even worse the series makers since they focused an entire episode in a 10 part series , should had double checked . 
  fifth element and cabin are not parodies . . 
   probably because the roman ** s ** ~ ~ empire , ~ ~, 
  ftfy . 
  the empire was n't too friendly for the first 200 years . . 
  he is sarcastic . 
  ve should deal with them !, 
  a fairly well known individual in the sub , an american with `` greek inheritance '' ( shudders ) he is spewing american right wing shit ( tsipras is a commie that has turned greece into a peoples republic ) which are hilarious because they are completely disconnected by the greek political reality . 
  the error is discussed for the series mostly so not 50 years old because they could easily verify the story . 
  its more aggravating because he is not a secondary character , but a protagonist in one of the episodes and gets a `` what happened to him card '' rubbing the mistake in the face . 
  i think they had to compensate his widow also , so not exacly without consequences . 
  its a very good story for sure , but since it was based in a real life person maybe they should have found another guy . 
  blythe re-enlisted two more times , participated in veteran gatherings ( he died after visiting one in bastogne ) and was a silver star recipient . 
  [ clean wermacht myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clean_wehrmacht ), 
  [ wermacht war crimes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht ), 
  they are becoming a lot more common these days . 
  same in hoi 2, 
  molyneux during lionhead overhyped his games to the stratosphere , but if you forgot that , they where pretty good games . 
  black & white and fable while not the second coming they where promised werent a waste if money by themselves . 
  compare with spore and from what i understand nms that are bad games by theselves . 
  seriously this is so surprising !, 
  i had the same idea like you , but clone wars made it way better . 
  the clones did not take a consious decision between republic and jedi , they were literally mind raped to betray and kill their friends . . 
  distance penalties for vassal are such a simple answer . 
  you should be able to minimise it if you focus enough time/resources , but it should not be easy to rule jerusalem directly from iceland for example . 
  also relations ( like vendettas ) between dynasties instead of coalitions . 
  you captured and castrated the karling king of italy that was loved by the family ? 
  now the kings of w. and e. francia are pissed if and allied with a casus belli against you . 
  they cann have similar ammo pouches like the scottish , since historically they were carried by greeks also , and some where even costumised/decorated . 
  edit : its the [ palaskes / \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 ] ( https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;ei=p7_av5nbach0uphmm7ag&amp;q=\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1+\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7&amp;oq=\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1+\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..33i160k1.12298.18524.0.19442.9.8.1.0.0.0.293.1678.2-7.7.0....0...1c.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..1.6.1243...0i19k1j0i22i30i19k1.xzpirac73mo#imgrc=u31dt4g_sgoifm%3a ), 
  just let anyone try play ck2 without any dlcs . 
  the game now is essentially ck 2.5 +, 
  this is the e.t. 
  of our time . . 
  its very good when used to populate large not so interesting areas in between the focused , hand created areas or the world itself is a gameplay tool ( minecraft ) . 
  its a `` backstage '' thing that can truly enhance certain games , but not a feature of its own due to blandness . 
  i said it as a praise . 
  however i think the hardcoded part of the game is already showing its age and limits on how `` deep '' the game can change ( contrast eu4s random maps for example ) probably because it was the first game with this dlc scheme and they didnt expect this longevity . 
  thats the battle of asakai . 
  yeah because video games where unheard off during the 80s . . 
  sith are by the vast vast majority dark side users . 
  the dark side is inherently evil . 
  no its not another side of the same coin , its a pervasion of the `` light side '' , and default state of the force . 
  so dith force users commit evil just by using their powers . 
  finally the jedi * exiled * the dark jedi . 
  its the sith that rebuilt empires again and again trying to come back on top using war and massacres . 
  justinians plague may have been one case . 
  justinians plague devasted the eastern mediterranean regions in 541 . 
  but they are not the ones tha can make a decition, 
  the children of hurin reads like a greek tragedy . 
  yeah usually ancient tragedies had bittersweet endings , * at best *, 
  i have read it , but i dont remember the difference ? 
  i would like to point about the nato issue . 
  two times turkey and greece had clashed while being both nato members , in cyprus and imia crisis . 
  in cyprus it was a war in all but a name , and the us did not intervene . 
  it is not far fetched to think that us or the eu allowing fyrom claims to get a hold , even as a diplomatically grey area , to punish an insubortinate greece . 
  well it had clear elements of both , along with germanic stories like the ring of nibelugen .
