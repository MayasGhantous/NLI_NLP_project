  since tolkien was a master of all those , we cant know for sure i guess . 
  well it had clear elements of both , along with germanic stories like the ring of nibelugen . 
  since tolkien was a master of all those , we cant know for sure i guess . 
  a theater piece would be way better . 
  an opera perhaps ? 
  the belgian revolution started after a succesfull play in the theater agitated the populance . 
  so you have a real life example !, 
  stranger than fiction and all that . . 
  for me bundy will always be al. 
  what you may have is a condition where some people break electronics just by being there ( in phone now so u cant easily link it ) . 
  since it happens only in your house , it is possible some material there is causing you to get static electricity ? 
  he may well became a prince of a new state the was created by the genie ( maybe around that oasis ? ) . 
  however alladin is `` dethroned '' by jaffar before we see more of it , nullifying the wish . 
  or he simply created a lot of wealth like the cold coins and made him recognised royalty without land ( read about heralds in feudal europe ), 
  the eu countries have full on * indepedence * . 
  they can pack up and leave at any time ( see uk ) . 
  i would definetely read about a road trip between the nerdy professor and snarky agent in fantasy creature infested america . 
  keep the dragon as a big reveal thu !, 
  picturing a crusader during the 700s is like picturing a musketeer during the battle of agincourt . 
  vlad the impaler had nothing to do with stopping the ottomans , their highest point was the siege of vienna . 
  these are basic things this pile of shit gets wrong . 
  i dont think that sounds as cool as you think . . 
  the factions chose their colors based on the most prevalent nebula colors in their systems ? 
  thanatos/charon has the same issue . 
  we greeks dont care . 
  the game is definetely easier if you are ruthless . 
  most games have the vast majority of their sales immiedietely after release like movies.so they definetely getting their money . 
  the problem is if they wish to finish the game and hope to get money from that in the future , the negative reviews maight hurt them then , or the contrversy might be used as free advertising . 
  it all depends on how they want to play it out . 
  the really common practice of preorder says otherwise . 
  unfortunately there is at least [ two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_air_lines_flight_401 ) [ cases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_salak_sukhoi_superjet_100_crash ) where the pilots ignored/didn ' t hear the warning sound . 
  the first images look like a reskin of the gog launcher , galaxy . 
  the island has multiple connections to the mainland . 
  i think its not a strech to think most of `` secondary '' characters commuting from there is a stretch . 
  op where are your bites concetrated ? 
  if they are from waist and down , especially in the legs and they are itchy they might be fleas . 
  if it is explain `` in-world '' then it is acceptable ( `` christof is a control freak character and insists all his actors stay in set 24/7 '' for example ) . 
  however do you have a source ? 
  in mid 90s a cd drive was considered an expense like a mid level graphics card is today . 
  something `` extra '' that you would use for specialized functions and not something you would add to mundane use machine ( an office pc for example ) , but not cutting edge technology . 
  by late 90s they have become common , and by early 00s they where a default device . 
  i would much prefer instea a eu army that takes orders only from the eu itself . 
  if it is ever created i would not pay for another force that is under the us thumb in nato or wait for the clusterfuck that is the un . 
  european nations already contribute there anyways . 
  `` body armor '' is a more generic term meaning any protection used to shield the body . 
  bulletproof vest is a specific line of equipment that can be included in the catch all term `` body armor '' . 
  bulletproof vests are generally vest like attire that offer protection versus bullets . 
  some have problem protecting against otehr types of attack , like for example a knife , others do n't , depending on the material and technology they use . 
  they are good protecting against lower calibre bullets like those fired by most handguns and they give better chances versus larger calibre bullets like those from rifles * if * there is a * lot * of distance between you and the shooter . 
  however in sadats and mubaraks case , where they where sprayed in a range of mere meters they would make zero difference , especially considering the technology the time . 
  new vegas was cut mostly because consoles couldnt handle it . 
  you can restore in all its glory ( an it is one ! ), 
  in the pc with a mod . 
  they got 18 months from bethesda . 
  18 . months . 
  and then they got shafted from a big bonus because the contract clause needed a specific metacritic score and they missed it by 2 points . 
  `` hey look , a 10mm smg !, 
  i will give it to ian to cover me better ! '', 
  contracts are not emotional , humans are however . 
  like how i feel emotions when consider it a dick move to at least not negotiate for a portion of the payout . 
  or when i skip bethesda games when i am looking for something to buy . 
  an airburst has * less * fallout , not * no * fallout at all . 
  it is still deadly and damaging in the long term for thousands . 
  edit :, 
  from nevada test , 22k will have cancer related issues * apart * from thyroid cancer , who number into the tens of thousands . 
  additional nbci research about increased thyroid cancer chances . 
  i love that movie because it is the closest we will ever get of a holywood adaptation of a french/belgian school comic . 
  if you liked that movie and its style i strongly suggest check to find one amongst the hundrends that exist , from sci fi to noir to full on drama . 
  i would like to clarify as a `` successful '' adaptation . 
  valerian definetely looks promising but until released we cant know . 
  did you see the spread of fallout ? 
  do you know how much increases the chances of various cancers and others problems in the long term like miscarriages or births with genetic defects ? 
  i suggest you get back to reading :, 
  chernobyl had at * least * 200k people receiving a major dose of [ radiation ] ( http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/backgrounder/en/ ) . 
  from nevada , 22k will have cancer related issues apart from thyroid cancer , who number into the tens of [ thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/downwinders#nevada ) . 
  additional [ nbci ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426666 ) research about increased thyroid cancer chances . 
  they do , check my reply to kaarous, 
  while they removed the jukebox , where you could choose the next music track from the soundtrack you wanted , the old music is back into the game and you can choose to switch between old and new in the options . 
  `` below the asteroids '' was and is the official unofficial song of eve !, 
  between two experienced players there is no trust because they know the game and how is played . 
  new players are for the vast majority taken care off and protected way more than other games . 
  one of the biggest alliances in the game right now is based on taking new guys in and helping them out . 
  what you buy or do n't buy is irrelevant unless you post some sources . 
  you know , like i did . 
  from your job description that you do n't forget to repeat , i will guess that you think i am one of those `` nuclear power is literally satan '' dudes . 
  i am far from it . 
  however minimizing the health effects is dangerous and shady . 
  even those 5 * thousand * had major operation to remove the thyroid cancer . 
  it can be a major burden in their lives both for the health and their financial state . 
  and that 's the absolute minimum number of effected with absolute minimum of effects . 
  while that is true , the staying power of some of those corps/alliance shows that the players are enjoying their game . 
  except for all those times that they literally all did . 
  those are the exception . 
  isnt in some stories explained that some of his most wackiest powers possible due to a latent psychic field ? 
  when you are trained to save people that are getting drowned , you are told to grab them from behind because from their panic they might grapple you and get you underwater . 
  so its pretty understandable for the little bee to do the same . . 
  twd in a nutsell :, 
  * pompous backround music *, 
  ** rick : ** ok people , i know i whined and brooded for 2/3 of the season about what happened in the last one , but enough is enough !, 
  we are going to get our shit together and be badasses !,
