  we cant do that !, 
  we might have survived situations that make syria look like a kindergarden food fight , but we are still good people !, 
  ( = dumb cliche zombie survivors ), 
  * random/stupid plot point disaster happens , fan controverial character dies '' *, 
  ** sec . 
  characters : ** oh naw rick , you was right !, 
  lets kick some ass !, 
  ** designated psycho villain : ** yeah about that ... 
  * proceeds to curbstomp the protagonists using contrivided coincidences , plot induced stupidity , and deux ex machina that includes either blocking every single road in half a state in the middle of zombie hordes , or a fucking fully armed and fuel abrams .

  it could be a way to access higher stories of buildings in cases you dont want a permanent structure like a ladder . 
  so not a batman hook , more like a way to attach/detach rope sheet from below . 
  but v is not invisible ? 
  tesla might been a have great scientist ( might ) . 
  a great human being though ? 
  ehhhhh ... 
  hey i saw your post !, 
  and i think you are right !, 
  i strongly suggest you try earthbound to get that itch fixed . . 
  damn yeah it is starboynd . 
  vaginal intercourse has less chances to transmit the disease vs anal . 
  this means that women and men that focus on that ( meaning , the vast majority of the straight couples ) have less chances of contacting the disease , making the virus not that widespread . 
  oh god . 
  deer puns . 
  not worth a buck . 
  google was the same when they had the search maturity levels as bing has , but they removed them 2-3 years ago , along with any result that could be found without filter . 
  isnt giving preferential treatment to a specific company over others quite an example of `` crony capitalism '' and anathema for complete free market supporters ? 
  i thought texas became an indrpedebt state at first so not to antagonise mexico further until the us were ready politically to go all in ? 
  i was teasing him . 
  this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hliurd7d1q ) will probably blow your mind . . 
  its soul crushing when your entire day is spent under the grey caves of cheap knock offs of brutalism . 
  i have read somewhere that as time passes the chances of at least a limited nuclear war slowly approach 100 % . . 
  and that why it is nice to have the infrastracture itseld owned by the city and/or state . . 
  yeah after 9 times removed you are not considered even a vit relared . . 
  watching anime is not socially accepted ? 
  you mean the genre that had spawned various adatation , translations and even a couple of ( horrible ) theatrical releases from most major studios and networks ? 
  i think the olympic torch relay with one runner standing next to the one he is supposed * to * give the flame instead of next to the one that will guve him the flame is more appeopiate in this particular case no ? 
  the extreme `` fandom '' is looked down upon . 
  anime in maybe more mainstream in the west than what is thought to be in japan . 
  its black with red detail . 
  its a widow . 
  i definetely dont want to remember your worts . 
  and that will probably be the case ic we ever built self improving ai . 
  they will not fear us or hate us , they will ivnore us all together . . 
  triggered . . 
  wait isnt that the case right now fo most major mainstream titles ? 
  there is a video circulating in this thread about a us apache that does the same , in the mountains , over people , and not in excessive but for shits and giggles . 
  cell phones are like the wheel . 
  we did a lot of stuff without it , but after inventing it we simply cant go back . 
  the thing is , what amount of that price goes to the dev and what goes to the producer , advertiser and all the third parties . 
  piracy in the case of music has shown that the only peopke that lost money where the execs , while creators got both recognition and payed for the work . 
  it actually exploded the `` indepedent '' scene since now you can bring your idea in to the market whithout needing a third party to finance you and either interfere or outright deny your idea because it is not aaa `` marketable '' . 
  i am far from a piracy advocate , but the situation is not as clean cut as it seems . 
  with the weird shit they where cranking out , they where bound to hit technologies that had * potential * . 
  however they consistencly failed to capitalise on those and in other areas they had to play catch up like in their tanks . 
  germany was not the technological powerhouse it is thought to be , even in the start of the war where for example french armor was superior . 
  ohh i know !, 
  i just wanted to keep it simple since when someone says `` germany was a science paradise '' they probably have learned history from cracked or reading titles from til . 
  when irons plays in a dodgy movie , especially adaptation , i am more worried . 
  the man has taken some peculiar decisions for the paycheck ( dungeons & dragons , eragon ) . 
  surprisingly the names aristotle and socrates are not-that-rare given names in greece . 
  plato on the other hand is inexistent.so you would be made fun even in the original language . 
  not in modern greek it isnt . 
  and a lot of ancient greek names had `` nickname '' explanations like philip , alexander etc etc. 
  you can see it with other group of names too , where some greek gods are commonly used for names ( demetra , hera , athena , aphrodite , ares , dyonisos etc ) while others ( zeus , poseidon , hephaestus ) almost never . 
  yep this sounds like kafros . 
  no substance or counter arguments only personal attacks . 
  its not that common but it exists . 
  but way more more common than other like thrasybulus for example . 
  being a white supremacist libertarian troll and a loser are not exactly exclusive ... 
  do you think it would be possible to have a wallpaper with `` get the stick '' ? 
  maybe with a tiny sketch of teh dino with his determined look ? 
  we do have the ability , and not technicaly . 
  its just very * very * expensive to start . 
  while resourses are available here for a miniscule fraction of the cost . 
  the gold on the ships that usually look like giant dicks you mean . . 
  i think you are using to much prose , but i agree with what you saying . 
  i think video `` games '', 
  have a great potential to tell a lot of stories , yet none has taped in to that because they are still considered light , childish entertainment . 
  lets take the holocaust for example , can anyone think of presenting it in a video game ? 
  the press would go fucking ballistic . 
  yet when [ another ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maus ) ( at the time considered ) `` light '' entertainment did it , in comic form , it won a fucking pulitzer . 
  i wonder when video `` games '' will finally break their mold , and possibly get into a similar `` underground '' phase like comics did during the 60s and 70s . 
  is this the `` my immortal '' of r/badhistory ? 
  actually this is how i found out the video . 
  i am learning french and i regularly google new words to read about them . 
  i googled fretiller and i found this video  . , 
  you are welcome !, 
  see what those evil marijuanas do to our children !, 
  look !, 
  look . 
  it was hilarious how transparent it was , especially the rush before the citadel release yet i felt very sad for all the newbies and their comments here that jumped on the wagon of the `` righteous '' . 
  it felt like witnessing the children 's crusade live . 
  i know what game you are talking about . 
  you only saw a rectangular piece of the map in isometric , with maximun 4 arrows around it in the cardinal position correct ? 
  this is what escapes me so far . 
  i do n't remember if the battles where turn based or real time .
