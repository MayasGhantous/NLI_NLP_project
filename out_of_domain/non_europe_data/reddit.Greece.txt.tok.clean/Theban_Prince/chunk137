  well that seems like a nice alternative to r/retrofuturism , where if you point out that the things presented in old magazines or videos have been done one way or another or you point they simply are not practical you get downvoted to hell because `` muh flying cars '' .

  i do n't think most jedi had any chance of survival , in the temple or not . 
  the vast majority where either directly in the front lines or supporting the war at some capacity , so clone troopers where close at hand . 
  even if some where not close by , the temple and its archives fell completely at the hands of the emperor , meaning he could find the missions and locations of the rest . 
  its doubtful many survived , and the total break of communication meant they had no idea what exactly happened or who survived to link up with them . 
  i do n't think the emperor expected to get all the jedi in one fell swoop but having a dozen or so jedi surviving from hundreds is definitely a success in their eyes . 
  of course , two of the surviving jedi 's did link up one way or another , and trained a charismatic young pilot from tatooine that kinda ruined their plans , so in hindsight it might not been so successful . 
  elves are hardcore immortal . 
  even if they die , they wake up in the halls of mantos . 
  this is not a name for the afterlife , but a real place in valinor . 
  i am not aware of the rules and regulations of the us army so my question might help both of us . 
  as far as i know , ahdh or asthma are not possible to get completely cured , while other problems can . 
  does the us army offer medical support for * other * fixable medical conditions ? 
  do recruits that are up for the operation can totally skip `` physical fitness '' forever or they simply postpone it for the duration of the therapy ? 
  if they postpone it , how different is from other medical operations ? 
  do you have any sources or indication on how many of the people that are eligible will prefer the minimum years under contract , and even then how much common is renlistement ? 
  maybe the army has accurate data that this is a cost effective way to get people in the army . 
  another similar case is the people that join just until the army pays for a higher education . 
  apart from the lost year , how different is this ? 
  if this was rl he would have been charged for manslaughter ... 
  1 % of 10000 means only 100 jedi , with varying levels of power and training . 
  a 99 % success is outstanding and more than i expected . 
  um , he was fighting with the wookies and a clone army . 
  they actually tried to [ off ] ( https://youtu.be/tcuuiketjjo?t=4m7s ) him but yoda been yoda defeated the clones . 
  obviously not if he was rl stone giant but perhaps a worker moving rocks . 
  [ law ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/homicide-murder-manslaughter-32637-2.html ) . 
  so you do have examples that other cases of the same severity take less time ? 
  is there any indication that this medical case is given way more time than it should be ? 
   i think maybe it 's hard for civilians to understand this part . 
  you have someone on your `` books '' as we say , they are filling a slot in a position in your unit , they go get their treatment and are gone for a year , you do n't just get someone to replace them for that year , that slot stays `` filled '' and you just have to pick up the slack for a year while that person does their transition because you have a job that 's not being done , but the bureaucrats in dc see the position as being `` filled ' because your soldier is technically filling that spot . 
  this sounds a legit grievance but it does n't seems to have anything to do with this particular operation , but operations as a whole . 
  while i would guess its more severe when it in the army , it is definitely not unique to it . 
  private industries will get really hard pressed to employ another employee when they have another one still in the payroll but not working for medical reasons . 
  also i digged a bit around , [ this ] ( http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2016/2/03/military-health-plan-may-cover-some-transition-related-care ) and [ this ] ( http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/08/21/tricare-now-covering-transgender-treatment-options.html ) article suggest tricare are only covering medication and counseling for now , the operation themselves are ( for now ) forbidden . 
  edit : i would also like to point out that medicare [ covers ] ( http://www.transequality.org/know-your-rights/medicare ) hormones and operation . 
  so for me it seems that the changes are simply the military medical catching up with widespread civilian medical packages , not a touchy feely unique case . 
  i still do n't know the situation . 
  lets say you have a medical situation that is treatable , lets say myopia or something similar . 
  this is something that you can fix before joining the army . 
  does the army covers those kind of operations ? 
  edit : it [ does ] ( http://advancedvisioncare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/us-military-approves-visian-icl-implantable-lens-for-correction-of-myopia-in-active-duty-personnel.pdf ) . 
  so , um , what exactly is the difference ? 
  both are treatable in very limited cases and require way way more time than 1 year with high chances of leaving permanent disabilities . 
  a majority are outright death sentences . 
  nowhere near comparable to sexual corrective surgery where you know that unless something goes horrible wrong , you are going to have your soldier afterwards . 
  he was given multiple examples and links that point his view is flawed ( for example that you can join the army with myopia , and afterwards you can ask for coverage fro surgery or pregnaacies ) . 
  he upped the ante that cancer and hiv are also able to be cured , should the army take them in ? 
  make of that what you will . 
   not comparing those to gender dysphoria but if `` treatable '' is the standard for admission then we need to readjust our admission standards . 
  cancer and hiv are not treatable , at best they are survivable . 
  even if you have the problem with admission standards , that does n't mean sexual corrective surgery is a unique case by any means , and you need a different cmv post . 
  so you are comparing and saying that eye surgery , pregnancy and sexual change operations with prostate cancer , breast cancer or aids are * equivalent * in medical severity . 
  do i really understand you correctly ? 
  also your other point of contention was that they are not part of the team as they are recuperating and the rest are taking up the extra work . 
  however the 1 year that really annoys you is about physical fitness tests , not doing their duties , right ? 
  then why bring them up ? 
  since you admit they are not the same in severity your words, 
   `` but if `` treatable '' is the standard for admission then we need to readjust our admission standards . '', 
  have no point in this discussion except nitpicking . 
  do i have to become merriam-webster and explain the difference between `` treatable '' myopia and `` treatable '' cancer ? 
  do i have to explain the difference between a paper plane that `` crashed '' and a space shuttle that `` crashed '' ? 
  yeah i agree i should n't waste my time anymore . 
  technically after death your body is not yours anymore . . 
  its like a contaction of the muscle right where the heart is right ? 
   and every once in a while we pull 'em out and throw them a party, 
  can someone call the cops ? 
  these troublesome kids have been going at it since 2013 !, 
  [ this ] ( http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/ ) might be an interesting read for you about an extreme example . 
  it all three . 
  some people never told her that she is horrible , she ignored the ones that did , and the show allowed her to enter the stage for ratings . 
  first of all , turkey is geographical in europe ( thrace ) . 
  second of all , it has affected the political and cultural background of europe way more than say , iceland or switzerland . 
  while it might clash with the rest of the european union members , saying that turkey is not part of europe is stupid . 
  pretty much , yeah ... 
  why get scared ? 
  i mean , there are other technological stuff that we used to not have , but now we cant make without : sterilisation , drugs , transportation , safe pregnancy methods etc etc with electricity the most essential . 
  as with all tools , the abuse of phones depends a lot to the person holding them . 
  there are a lot of young people from the bush era still . 
  the best argument i have heard so far was `` meh '' . 
  its also interesting to see approval ratings from the time the presidents where active and then they are followed by later polls after their time has passed . 
  its rare for the general feeling to change . 
  you also forgetting the italians breaking austria . 
  its a white guy going to study in asia . 
  of course there is going to be kung fu . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rshdjzruh_0 ) is a fucking protest . 
  now i know why they called themselves the [ tea party ] ( http://grappenhall.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vintage-afternoon-tea-grappenhall-community-centre-500x383.jpg ) . 
  they are skeleton due to decomposition . 
  the preserved mounted head in whiterun is an indication that the corpse stayed the same long enough fir them to keep it . 
  an interesting note about this poster . 
  it caused the vogue magazine controversy when [ their first page photo shoot ] ( http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/gems/destroy-this-mad-brute-lebron-james.png ) with lebron james ( accidentally ? ), 
  payed homage to it . 
  game of thrones was akways hugh fantasy . 
  the problem is tge characters dont realise that . . 
  but used to have dragons and magical races and they knew about it . 
  and in essos you had people that can change their faces and sorcerers running around . 
  only people in westeros felt like that . 
  its like calling middle earth low fantasy because there hobbits lived far away from the wizards and sauron and had a vague ( if any ) idea of their existance .
