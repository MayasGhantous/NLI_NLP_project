  no my strategy is that those things are identical as an action , but we judge them differently based on ethics . 
  because ethics are a human construct and aribtrary . 
  yeah instead of `` doing '' i wanted to write `` winning '' . 
  thats what you get when you reply absentmindly . 
   ** you ** were able to think, 
   ** you ** had an idea, 
   ** my ** moral stances and ** yours **, 
   ** nature ** does n't give a fuck yo . 
  the concept of justice is meaningless outside of human society . 
  and even between human society there exist various interpretation of what justice is . 
  for us hitler was a monster . 
  for most of german society pre 1945 he was a savior . 
  for the rest of the universe he just existed . 
  lets take the animal example . 
  in asia eating and skinning dogs , is considered normal . 
  in the west that would be horrifying . 
  in italy they eat horses . 
  that would be atrocious for the rest of the western world . 
  but everyone there eats cows . 
  that would be disturbing for the hindus . 
  meanwhile , followers of [ jainism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jainism ) think they are sharing the planet with 7 billion murderers because they believe every single living thing should not be killed , even ants . 
  quite arbitrary is n't it ? 
  people tend not to wash their hair every single time they shower , especially with long ones . 
  hmm , i watched the movie yesterday in netflix and i definitely remember the emperor saying `` the on of skywalker must not become a jedi '' or something similar . 
  there used to be societies that cannibalism , human sacrifice and pederasty where the norm for * thousands * of years . 
  they thought those actions where outright good , as much as we ( including me ) think thiae are evil actions . 
  justice , morality and right and wrongg are completely fabricated objects for specific societies for a specific time and place and enviroments . 
  i am sorry that disturbs you , but what you consider moral exist only for a small part of our history , and even then not everywhere . 
  ethics exist only where we allow them . 
  the problem was the reapers , they where too much op . 
  how can you defeat a huge army of superbeing that can destroy worlds and are spread all over the galaxy in the span of 1 game ? 
  it was the titles fault . 
  it should have been `` former prime minister '' . 
  but he knows a hoe that dumped 4 dudes because they had an average penis !, 
  that should be a good control group to form an opinion no ? 
  having a magic nurse at hand more so i think . 
  someone linked the direct passage from the book . 
  the suspicious thing for the construction workers was n't the temperature , but the shape , since it was n't proper for creating big glass panes . 
  there are lever that uses with his free left hand and he can free his right hand by letting go the contraption , so i am guessing its should not be too difficult . 
  yeah the whole point is that the guy that will throw them will retrieve them and give them back to you . 
  however there is a caveat in that , the only people that will not avoid you as a weirdo for being in a pokemon costume in your 30s + are your best pals , and they will in all probability stuck the pokeballs in your pants . 
  0/10 would not wear, 
  oh there would be a greece . 
  greece-marfin inc. 
  half of his list read like a rant from a `` 80s kid '' to those `` goddamn millenials '' . . 
   he went back to his phone . 
  he was probably concetrated to that and got startled . 
  you forgot to point out that surviving vigilantes would probably get shot by the incoming police . . 
  i do n't think you know what the word vigilante means . 
  or that you cant help anyone with your hands up . 
  or what we even talking about . 
  it will never be enough . 
  flat earthers and conspiracy theory believers that like to fuss about `` evidence '' and `` science '' when in reality their communities are structured around an almost religious/cult like mentality . 
  the malp takes various reading mere seconds after it translates . 
  best case scenario you bought yourself some time before a tauri or a tokra ship pays a visit to check what you are trying to hide . . 
  no seriously , i also came for the salty kanye posts and i dont even know the man or his songs , i am just intrigued from the hatedom !, 
  this looks like something taken right out of a hayao miyazaki [ movie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/howl%27s_moving_castle_\\ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  i actually liked the movie because it broke some alien invasion cliches and it had some homages to war of the worlds . 
  spoilers ahead : the aliens where pretty realistic ( for this type of movie ) . 
  they have a legit reason to waste time to invade earth since humans and high intelligence is the only natural recourse unique to the planet . 
  the use of wetware cpus was pretty unique and refreshing angle also . 
  they where also invincible , as interstellar civilizations should be . 
  finally war of the worlds inspirations : the whole `` we are trapped in a building and we are getting irritated with each other while observing the aliens harvesting humans '' is a major part of the book , as is a valiant , last ditch but ultimately ineffectual attack from earths military forces . 
  even the ending could be this , since it is the aliens ( possibly ? ), 
  defeated by the same thing they harvested . 
  the protagonist becomes a corrupted part of the machine , you know , like a * virus ? 
  i do n't remember the characterization , but i think it was a bunch of spoiled brats ? 
  it worked for me , they where some random dudes , not the old fashioned random guy turns hero . 
  i am `` white '' yet i am not anglosaxon , protestant not even an american . 
  does this mean i am easily offended only based on skin color ? 
  ehhh not too bad . 
  i remember reading a `` best of '' commend about sanders , his refreshing arguments and why he is destined to lose either as an independent or as a dem nominee at least 3 years ago . 
  remember the whole lebensraum and cleansing the ` inferior races '' the germans had going ? 
  well the japanese where running a similar racket . 
  its exactly the same shit as the `` red pill '' and `` incels '' . 
  the entire establishment , society socialism is magically stopping all of them from becoming a modern ( sane era ) howard hughes/hugh hefner hybrid and they have zero personal faillings . 
  what thwe other dude is trying to tell you us that unless something extremely extraordinary happens that kills all their sources of revenue in the same short time , valve still has at least years to chill and rack up the money . 
  its not impossible to fuck up obviously when the time to cjange does come eventually ( see kodak and nokia ) , but thay point is far in the future for now that any prediction is moot . 
  until someone gets pushed down the slippery slope by the peer pressure and starts shooting people . 
  post ww2 the only metric that matters is the airpower . 
  with air superiority both enemy land and navy forces are sitting ducks . 
  the two countries are on par in numbers and with maybe a slight quality advantage for greece , so its a close call game that will be decided on leadership and preparation levels , something that we cant speculate . 
  there are militia people with issued guns in these areas and the islands are full with army bases and outposts , listening stations and permanent patrols of navy frigates , airforce squadrons and coast guard . 
  please dont reply on something you have no idea about . 
  just [ read ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a3%cf%8d%ce%bd%ce%b8%ce%b5%cf%83%ce%b7_%ce%95%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%b7%ce%bd%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%8d_%ce%a3%cf%84%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%8d_%ce%9e%ce%b7%cf%81%ce%ac%cf%82?wprov=sfla1 ) before you speak . 
  scroll a bit down for a full list of hqs , divisions ( national guard and regular ) in kos , limnos , samos , crete and others . 
  there is also english version if you dont speak greek , which i doubt . 
  thats what you get when you learn history from cracked top 10 lists . 
  nah right now they are just in the open . 
  republicans are stereotypically anti democratic and reactionary all year long . 
  i have the stinking auapition it was an alt account of op . 
  the guy appeared in this thread without any way of knowing it exists . 
  yugoslavia was a patchwork of ethnicities and religions with orthodox serbs the most dominant on\u03b5 . 
  in the 90s an independence/rebellion war started from those groups with serb dominated authorities trying to stop them . 
  eventually it devolved similar to a civil war into a clusterfuck of militia , paramilitary organizations , atrocities etc until nato stepped in . 
  assange and wikileaks have jumped the shark a while ago . 
   most of those islands are demilitarized according to the treaty of lausanne , ** there are no army bases on this islands ** . 
   i know ** the greek military has a presence on these islands . 
  ** obviously . 
  `` so full of shit . '',
