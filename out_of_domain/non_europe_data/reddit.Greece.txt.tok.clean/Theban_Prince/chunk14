  it would n't be cool !, 
  it would be shitty !, 
  stop enjoying yourself , that 's not allowed ! '', 
  i never said that or anything close to that . 
  my original comment was actually describing how would possibly feel to live in those paintings ( something that the original painter also intended to portray ) . and living in the blade runner world would be the epitome of cool . 
  shitty yes , but cool ! . i ** love ** post-apocalyptic !, 
  well in the real world these buildings are simply * impossible * to build . 
  thats the real downer . 
  but if ( excited if ) they where build , they would be the bastard child of gotham from the original batman movie , the city of matrix and a mix of blade runner.if that is n't cool , i do n't what is . . 
  its an invalid comparison.unless you find the average life expectancy for the termites , your are compering apples with elephants.for example , if we took 1 termite that lived 50 years and 3 termites that lived for 1 year , the average life expectancy of termites would be 13.25 years , hardly the 48.35 years of the central african republic .

  edit : before the scientists descent on me , i know the maths for life expectancy do not work that way.i am comparing an average with an upper bound ( as / u/ghost29 said ) in the context of the thread . 
  it would be remarkable compared * to what * ? to elephants?no it would n't . it would a big object compared to big objects.to apples ? 
  * then * its remarkable.you have to know what , where and how you compare to have any sense , at all.a better example of flawed comparison , is since * some * whales have more teeth than an average tiger , deers are more likely to get killed by whales.it does n't make any sense . 
  time to crush the party and any expectations . 
  this is either fake from op or the original author wrote it for giggles and means nothing . 
  nobody noticed it does n't have a time on it?so whoever found that piece of paper should get on the cafe for 12 hours and do what?chant the code word non stop until the correct guy hears it?scream it at random intervals?paint it on the fucking walls?and what happens if various people read the note?is he going to pay them all . 
  i call bollocks . 
  so?termite queens , termites , wolves , bigfoot , unless he compares 2 different average life expectancy numbers he is false . 
  i will copy paste a reply i gave about that just a sec before :, 
   it says something when the average life expectancy of your country is less than the upper bound lifespan of a termite , at least that 's the gist of it . 
  that 's a conclusion if i ever seen one . 
  the original commentator and some others after him took two irrelevant data , compared them incorrectly and draw/implied invalid statements ( life in some countries of africa is so bad a bug could outlive you ) . '', 
  and yet , i would still be wrong.if the input data are false then the end data are also false.simple as that . 
  sigh, 
  ... here we go again . 
  but those crowed security lines ... jesus they are sitting ducks.i think it is a matter of time before something goes boom there . 
   the metre has been defined as `` the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of, 
   1/299 ,792,458 of a second . 
  we use the light itself to get a meter.not just any light , the light . 
  but you can use sunday churchgoers too i guess.if you want to be a barbarian . 
  can someone explain to me why people bother with conspiracy theories and secret societies , when the `` evil '' that manipulates our society is so open?between these dozen companies you would find deposed governments , suppression , bloody revolutions etc etc all in the name of profit , not for a secret agenda.it does n't have to be the goddamn templars behind , just old people in suits.and that is more scary than the illuminati or the lizard people because apparently we ca n't handle some greedy old farts . 
  unfortunately i have reached that exact conclusion independently after discussing with lot of conspiracy believers.the dreadful thing is that right now in my country , europe , citizens from all over are so easy to grab on conspiracies and scaremongering and even worse stereotyping , something that we especially should had left behind forever . 
  holy shit , i tried to see one of their videos , i think we have the kings of / r/cringe here . 
   not as widespread as european football ( soccer ) fans stabbing and fighting each other over their petty club rivalries . 
  meh , most of the times the team leadership is behind this , and even then it is people from the fringes that participate on those fights . 
  this guy got it . 
  he is still alive . 
  `` well hello there my ... ( lustfull breath ) ... liege.i see you have been ... jousting a lot '', 
  also how it could [ go down .

  i do n't know the caliber ( but quite possibly yes it should represent a battleship 16 '' ) but it is definitely a naval artillery firing . 
  like [ this schematic ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/iowa_16_inch_gun-en.svg/800px-iowa_16_inch_gun-en.svg.png ) and [ this real life photo ] ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3445/3897613364_ee8784e6e4_o.jpg ), 
  way better than gravity . 
  the jack reacher movie pretty much deals with this case also.it is out right stated actually . 
  i gave over 70 % to charity.even if i find some better deals , i would prefer the humble bundle . . 
  he is talking about the neutral alliances , the grey areas of the 0.0 map . 
  i wish they started limiting the skill actually.i think it is an outdated system.there are already ways to different the novice form the expert player without arbitrary requirements . 
  sorry i was at work , plus i am winning at eve for the last 2 years . 
  its nice.tom cruise is not good for jack reacher ( a memetic badass / mary sue ) . 
  i recommend it as a secondary choice if you ca n't find something you really like to watch ( or as i say to my customers , a back up movie ), 
  it is really a spin off from his dark tower series and the hearts is atlantis book ( itself another dark castle spin off ) . 
  `` an asteroid is about to hit our planet.it will be an extinction level event '', 
  i know most people here are posting sentences that would bring terror in a more personal and immediate way and are also unfortunately more possible to be heard than mine . 
  however i would like to defend my choice . if this sentence was spoken it would bring utter terror to me because , well , that 's it . 
  not only for me , or my immediate family but pretty much everything . 
  new york , london , rome , iraq , my neighborhood , all the members of my family , my friends , your friends , every single historical place , every book , movie , video game , tv series , reddit , your wife sleeping next to you , well humanity at its whole , will be utterly and permanently cease to exist . 
  from all the apocalyptic dangers , this one is the most destructive.we have chances , even if they are slim , to survive a nuclear war , a global plague or a solar flare . 
  but throw a huge enough rock at us , and we will have * zero * chances of survival.and not only that but we will be literally disappear from this universe . 
  and this is not a sci fi scenario.is as real , however unlikely ) as a car accident , or cancer.and it is way , way worse . 
  `` i have a meeting today , which color tie is better ? '', 
  `` umm ... the blue . '', 
  `` nahh i prefer the pink '', 
  `` uhh the pink sir ? '', 
  `` yeah , like the slip you are about to get '', 
  you have unwittingly tortured dozens of innocent employees.have a nice day . 
  well then unless you are a person of authority ( boss , cop , judge ) or potential harbinger of bad news ( doctor , judge , irs agent ) then using the `` it has to be in person '' line is not that bad . 
  unless you use a sulky voice all the time . 
  being a marketing ploy is not inherently evil you know . 
  `` hey marketing dept , he haev to create our new 2015 marketing campaign '', 
  `` how about we use an almost underage looking model in sexy lingerie , rolling on our product and cocaine , while a voice over is screaming racist stereotypes ? '', 
  '' how about we help that guy that has an online following keep the car of his youth or even better create a fund for some charity and actually make people live better as a plus '' . 
  for some reason i read your comment in eric idle 's voice . 
  hint : do n't use it on these list of persons :, 
  your parents . 
  you sibling . 
  your boyfriend/girlfriend . 
  you supervisor if you work on a nuclear plant . 
  something that will make you crack up!at first i wrote about being a nuclear missile officer calling your supervisor , but i changed it to a nuclear station because i thought it would be too complex for someone without any nuclear warfare knowledge . 
  what are the fucking chances ? 
  and the lord spake , saying , `` first shalt thou take out the holy cap . 
  then shalt thou count to three , no more , no less . 
  three shall be the number thou shalt count , and the number of the counting shall be three . 
  four shalt thou not count , neither count thou two , excepting that thou then proceed to three . 
  five is right out . 
  once the number three , being the third number , be reached , then lobbest thou thy holy ketchup towards thy food , who , being naughty in my sight , shall snuff it .

  if i , while on a dinghy , could throw a grenade inside while a door was open and kill the command staff , nobody would call out the architect for creating a weak point in the bridge but [ all these guys ] ( http://aviationintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/us-carrier-group.jpg ) for being unable to stop a 28 nobody from wiping out the command of a whole carrier group.unless i was a fucking space wizard of course .

  the lack of majestic m\u00f8\u00f8se tags is disturbing . 
  i guess it does . 
  but like in my example , if the carrier finds itself under direct attack , then everything have gone to shit anyways . 
  and in star wars people tend to forget that the attack was a desperate one , on par with the kamikaze attacks the japanese used against usn carriers during ww2 . 
  the only difference would be if a japanese pilot had magic powers and flew his plane all the way to los alamos and crashed it on top of the nascent nuclear program . 
  that is what luke pulled . 
  we have a grammar nazi of the year nominee people !,
