  you took false equivalency to a while other level . 
  what you are saying , is a guy that is afraid about his basic human rights is the same like someone that , according to his own words , is interested in a few * small * percentages of the economy , because '' they both care '' . 
  i mean just your language is at least 1/3 french . 
  your queen has german lineage . 
  your economy , mainly city , is a major player in europe and vise versa . 
  but yeah uk is has way more differencea than say , denmark with greece . 
  what cganges they did that contradict the game ? 
  i mean korriban exists in disney canon with a slightly different name . . 
  i think you need to replay the games . 
  lightsaber worthy crystals on exist only in very specific places and they are quite unique . 
  the dantoine jedi temple was built specifically for this . 
  its the same as the illum crystals that exist in disney canon as present in clone wars . 
  have you even played any of the games ? 
  the basic color crystals were of the same kind . 
  you could just add additional ones and mostly for gameplay bonuses since it was using the d20 system of rules . 
  as for the color that is based on the person , kotor 2 had a crystal that changed affinities based on the persons `` aligment '' . 
  never the less its a detail so minor compared to having a * whole planet * that looks exactly the same as the game , and featured prominently in the finale . 
  according to you , if we ever saw a moon shaped space station called derth star in a game , that fires blue laser to destroy planets , its not the same one with the movies because there it fired a green laser . 
  from what i know , the tzars claimed the title as a continuation of the byzantine empire , based on a marriage the russian king had with a byzantine princess . 
  is it possible tzar comes not from the latin caesar , but the greek \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1 , that means the same ? 
  the catholic and orthodox faiths dont have `` bible is literal '' in their * official * doctrine and consider that the * new * testament suprasses the old . 
  they number hundrents of millions of people . 
  but you know , edgy narrative . 
  the anchor is not just an employee , and he has live feed with the director that never stops coordinating him . 
  this would be the last person out of the loop . 
  the kkk celebrating in the streets was a hoax . 
  but if it is a setup by the channel itself they did vet him , no ? . 
  i mean , who in what position planned it ? 
   but that 's beyond the point : people who are deeply racist are happy that trump . 
  you just need to go stormfront to find out that 's true . 
  oh i know it !, 
  however there are a lot of shit flying around ( including a photo of a supposed kkk celebration march that was people that had flags ) , so check and double check . 
  trumps supporters are gobbling every thing they see , no reason to be the same . 
  the vast vast majority that i know off follow this particular thing ? 
  that is not a weird protestant offshoot in the bible belt of usa ? 
  i mean , even the catholics are mellower than usual these days and their priesthood is way more intrusive in everyday life ( masturbation , safe sex , abortion ) than the orthodox one . 
  the ** new ** testament . 
  ** new **, 
  the whole point of * christianity * is that christ came , fulfilled the ** old ** testament ( contract ) that god had with the jews and made a new one . 
  it in the fucking name mate . 
  pretty basic stuff you can [ research for christianity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_views_on_the_old_covenant#catholic ) . 
  have you ever thought that is the other way around ? 
  that the most bigoted , most resistant to change and most oppressive will use , embrace and yell their religion so they can support * also * with it their hate ? 
  i mean , you have so called `` religious '' extremists from christians to [ buddhists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buddhism_and_violence#regional_examples ) , religions with no connection in beliefs . 
  maybe those people want to oppress and hurt and simply use god as another flag , when they could ( and do ) use something else like nationality , color of skin , gender etc. 
  of course , i must admit religion is one of the most easy to subvert so you can create `` others '' . 
  you cant easily accuse a new yorker ( that you envy ) that is a chinese agent , but you can easily manipulate an aspect of faith to call him a `` heretic '' . 
  it means contract or promise . 
  the word in greek ( \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b7 ) is the same as the one we use for a will , for after death . 
  there is a link i posted . 
  it explaind how churches see that . 
  * i * am not judging them , but the main church authorities so your `` true scotsman '' kunda falls apart . 
  the church , that its main job since its inception is to define what makes or not a `` true scotsman '' . 
  hell they decided which documents are valid or not , the same documents * you * try to use in your arguments . 
  christian churches * exist * for that reason , to preserve and interpret the word of god.you copy paste arguments that i meet all over reddit and feels like parroting without knowing even basic stuff about the role of the church and priests . 
  oh my god so much hostility.maybe beliving in something that preaches love will help you out . 
  except using false arguments , since appeal to authority is not false in a structured organisation like religion that has an authority specific for that job . 
  its like going to court and ignoring the judge because he is appealing to authority . 
  aquinas only said that the old testament is without sin , which kinda is assumed if it was the word of god . 
  but ofcourse you ignored the whole text about the three laws , to try and find something to support your biased views . 
  its called cherrypicking . 
  american protestants are a minority on christanity . 
  and where in the 10 commandments it says gays shoould be killed , or anything about kosher ? 
  something that i have to reply again and again . 
  the people that decide what goes and what goes on are not the believers betwern themselves , but the central church authorities since paul and peter . 
  i find it annoying that people attack a belief without knowing even basic stuff . 
  i myself is an agnostic but i know that christianity is consistent at least internally . 
  for a so called `` sceptic '' sub , people name called me and used internet arguments . 
  marvelous . 
  i started this whole discussion about how people willfully ignore the existence of thousands of mainstream catholics and orthodox and you bring up protestants to prove a point . 
  yes called `` fucker '' is the epitome of a skeptic argument . 
  or a reddit user has more deep knowledge of the christian dogma than thomas aquinas . 
  sure buddy . 
   the old testament call for guys to be stoned , so all christians are bigots that follow those rules . 
  me : the catholic and orthodox doctrine says that the old testament is not law anymore . 
   not every christian follow the doctrine . 
  so all christians are all marching in lockstep on what the bible says about gays , but not all following the doctrines of the church . 
  i cant even . 
  the papal kights are larping as greek hoplites ? 
  achievement unlocked ? 
  i cant stop snickering as i imagine some hoplite dudes having a lambada standoff with some persian dudes . . 
  persian dwarves sound a lot like the `` dwarves '' of the elder scrolls games . 
  totally awesone mush up in both cases though . 
  if franz ferdinand had survived , war would happen anyways . 
  austria was itching to get serbia , and was looking for a pretext to do so . 
   history is full of examples of early-adopters of technology defeating the old strong empire and becoming the new strong empire . 
  can you give an example please ? 
  i am dumbfounded why are people celebrating his words . 
  ignoring the climate change denialism that becomes official , he wants to scrap sls midway , one of the biggest if not * the * biggest project of the decade , with a generic `` deep space exploration '' buzzword inserted to sugarcoat it . 
  well how are they going to achieve that without a new payload delivery system ? 
  to me it sounds like a complete neutering of nasa missions for a decade at least . 
  someone please tell me i am wrong . . 
  they are nowhere near that capability as far as i know . 
  hence the neutering . 
  which one ? 
  germany definitely looked france and russia as enemies and austro-hungary as an ally . 
  the only country that * might * behave differently would be uk , but that meant ignoring germany going through a british guaranteed belgium . 
  the whole europe was like a house rigged with mutual exploding traps . 
  yah i missed that . . 
  both in america and europe the center right is goint into polemics that fan the flames of faschism .
