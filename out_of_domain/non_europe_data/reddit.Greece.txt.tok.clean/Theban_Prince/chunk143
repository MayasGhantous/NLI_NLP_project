  maybe convice wizards to finally make some crpgs again based on it ffs . 
  you are forgetting the part where poverty was caused by the focusing of the economy to war because from day 1 they where encircled by hostile reactionary states that invaded them . 
  and that state of emergency got highjacked by individuals that turned into a `` communist '' dictatorship . 
  that final part is not unique to communism . . 
  owen was his step brother that met for a few hours when he was fully grow wheb he found out that his mother was captured . 
  after finding her , he got off the planet ( that hated ) . 
  there was no connection with tantooiine after that . 
  can you post a photo of the greek letters ? 
  greek letters are used a lot in mathematical equations . 
  ** ominous latin chant intestifies **, 
  i am sure i have seen something similar , i think in this subreddit also !, 
  in the final dungeon , if i remember correctly , you fill up with down spells and just teleport to the codex . 
  you are wrong . 
  reality did change , the kids parents never went to the ski trip . 
  it is never stated that what they are experiencing is a fault of their perception . 
  the game just resets the time . 
  you are adding additional complexity to the script from nowhere . 
  the kids remember them . 
  notice the constant [ aside glances ] ( https://youtu.be/ktuwvzra8ew ) they are giving and the big smiles when the parents arent looking . 
  but all four have to play idiot because there is no way to explain how they know each other . 
  they probably woke up at the same date and time * they * started the game , in 1995 . 
  there is absolutely no evidence that what what experience is a premonition , and it doesnt even make sense . 
  the game can open huge portals at another whole dimention where allan survived for 30 years at will amd without strain . 
  time traveling is impossible why exactly ? 
  as a greek , it felt like that for the last 5 years , and a lot of europeans where into it . 
  i find it refreshing and very funny that with immigration , brexit and the usa election , that high and mighty , knowitall atittude has being turned against groups that gave it before . 
  during the soviet invasion , they got support from the west . 
  nato never went total war on them because burning down whole cities and villages from 50k feet was not the reason for the invasion , but the defeat of a goverment and the part of the population that supported them . 
  however that makes it difficult defeating them since they can melt away to the general population and wait for a better time to strike . 
  its the m.o. 
  of all partisan movements . 
  is it a circlejerk when you are masturbating solo ? 
  as a greek that * actually * has lived in another western country : we are western by far . 
  in a daily life you would be hard pressed to see a difference between say , a belgian , an italian and a greek . 
  there are differences in culture obviously , but not that great compared to say a greek and a korean or an arab . 
  i do n't want to break our oratory masturbation , but reproduction between `` nationalities '' using the ottoman empire was not that great as you would imagine , not that its did n't exist . 
  the greek mainland at the time was comprised of small semi-isolated villages and small towns , and usually had uniform population and kept to each other . 
  on the other hand , its completely irrelevant since culture and religion played a more important role . 
  ehhh if the lions dont get him or his friends they ( and their children ) will die . 
  its not unique either . 
  i have seen it floating in the internet once or twice . 
  it is stupid because prussia uniting germany or the french revolution did not erase their previous history as states . 
  if we kept the same thinging the us should count at least after the incorporation of the western territories or even the civil war . 
  one example . 
  thousands of websites use various google apis from maps to search engines . 
  just this can net a humongous amount of info while most people would fail to realise you are using a `` big mainstream webpage '' . 
  in reality , by having backdoors in done dozens of companies they could theoretically scan a huge percentage of it , and we are not even discuss about isps and web hosting companirs.the promblem is that i dont know how they would be able to analyse this humongous wave of data per second . 
  same . 
  ohh kevin spacey is playing a timid supporting role ? 
  yeah that is not going to last . 
  also the first scary movie . 
  on the other hand , its a good getway for noob corps to go out and take the plunge of nullsec . 
  after a while they can join an alliance as full members . 
  eu : rome was as close as we get . 
  something something ad hominem . 
  we can map the climate for thousands of years ago with various methods , ice cores , soil samples fron deeper on earth , glacial markings on the terrain and many many more . . 
  in predator 2s defence the higher ups noticed very quickly ... 
  arent big hips also an indication of birth whith less complications ? 
  how us intervention led to ww2 ? 
  i think the us where actually the one askibg for more leniency for in the versailles treaty ? 
  the kings of modern greece did more damage to the country than every enemy combined . 
  you are forgetting the vikings and the grand heathen army . 
  or the danish empire . 
  or the swedish empire . 
  or the deluge in poland . 
  scandinavian countries ( huge if ) they are more friendly , it is from the 19th century or so . 
  i think that counts as part of the `` offensive technology '' . 
  the only one i have an objection is the 100 dynasty , since it will be out of the players hands and luck based . 
  he also looks pretty [ awesome ] ( https://yt3.ggpht.com/-cglbu6kdei8/aaaaaaaaaai/aaaaaaaaaaa/pi679mvyyyu/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg ) , while chuck , [ well ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/chuck_norris_may_2015.jpg/220px-chuck_norris_may_2015.jpg ), 
  its the equivalent of `` i am working on '' in english , as in improving , expanding a skill ? 
  for example `` i am working on my accent '' means you are trying to improve it . 
  wait , not from the us so i am trying to understand.so the whole she-bang about clinton was that she used a personal unsecure server for sd mails , and she ** potentially ** compromised them . 
  but they have someone appointed that have been proven that he * did * leaked sensitive info , serves a sentence for that and ... nothing ? 
  the actuall play presents both men and women as lustfull . 
  in the end men cant take it anymore , so they agree to talk peace ( something not as easy to imagine today due to their values , so it is presented as exceptional ) while there are women in the camp that the others have to keep an eye out all the time as not to break the vow of chastity because they miss their man . 
  depending on how high is , it could be stand for a shower curtain that opens like a semi circle . 
  ** babies ** are a dna mix of two people , essentially created by them , just , you know , using the old fashioned way . 
  because there is no mention . 
  time would be relative in the a matrix , it could be a perpetual 1999 as you said . 
  darkcity like reset would happen periodically . 
  we call them `` investors '' or `` high level management '', 
  many countries dont have the `` first past the post '' system . 
  particularly in parliementary democracies where coalitions are frequent it is common to have top elected parties with 43 % of the vote for example . 
  as a centrist , ideologies on paper are quite different . 
  however alot of them when applied in real life will spawn `` purist '' movements that frequently believe they are the tru keepers of the flame . 
  it has happened from religions to political movements to sports teams . 
  yep . 
  no argument there . 
  being a moderate in your beliefs and opinions is accusated as being indifferent or that you are a `` fake '' . 
  but i belive that impartiality and being able to distinguish that some matters are too complex for dry cut `` solution '' based on your chosen doctrine is a very hard thing to achieve and requires constant self vigilance . 
  i was just pointing out the differences between systems . 
  33 % election result for the us system might seem low , while for the german system might be in the usual ranges for a winning party , so the nazi party could be considered that it won the elections depending on the usual percentages . 
  no need to get triggered !, 
  well from all the racists calling others to `` get the fuck out of my country '' he was oh so slightly less of a hypocrite . 
  the nazi party , with hitler as their leader , won enough percentage to be the first party and successfuly formed a coalition to govern germany . 
  the nazi party , with hitler at its helm , won . 
  its is the same as present day angela merkel ( 41 % in the last vote and part of a coalition ) and alexis tsipras with syriza ( 35 % and part of coalition ) and of course , other countries . 
  is it simple enough ? 
  so the republican party or trump won the election ? 
  so you are going to ignore that a ) the two systems are dufferent and pecentages need context and that b ) trump was the official * republican * nominee ?
