  you want the survivors to achieve things and build stuff , but after a certain point they are too safe and the story stops being about survival so they have to destroy it so drama can exist , and most importantly , budget . 
  so they force the protagonists to do completely dumb things , again and again so they can lose all and start over . 
  but after a while it you become apathetic . 
  `` oh they found a secure base of operations , i wonder if it will last for more than half a season until a cotrived coincidence , someone suddently behaving with the iq of an amoeba or a new overpowered villain out of the blue will wreck it . '', 
  at some point they mention they practice genetic modification for radiation , so you can explain the good looks based on that . . 
  season 2 is pretty much fallout : the series . 
  especially fallout 2 . 
  the station themselves where big enough to warrant security . 
  and by season 3 they are out of ammo despite finding more on earth and never participating in any major war . 
  there was proof actually presented that mcdonalds had received multiple complaints from the customers but ignored them because that temperature is the `` best '' to drink coffee . 
  you are doing the bear 's work my friend . 
  the ring would be found eventually since it has power of its own to effect its destiny on how it moves and who it calls . 
  examples are dropping out of gollums hand and the ambush that killed isildur . 
  thats one of the reasons they cant simply drop it into the sea . 
  somel of them appear in clone wars in greatly expanded and they are very seasoned warriors and generals . 
  so they are not just wise . 
  or you messing with him caused him to swallow . 
  but you will never be sure ... 
  . . schrondingers dog ? 
  its never stated , but tom bombandil is n't affected not due to his age but because he is something completely different that anything else in middle earth or even arda itself . 
  it could be eru , or the spirit of nature . 
  the point is that his age is not his defining characteristic . 
  the ring did affect the watcher . 
  thats the reason it grabs frodo immediately , the ringbearer himself , because it was calling for it . 
  i think it is mentioned in the appendices ? 
  and sauron and his armies would definitely overpower the watcher given time , when even the fellowship managed to battle it until they could run away . 
  the ring does have the power to influence where it ends and its chances of bring found . 
  remember that we have already an example of it being lost in a many * many * times more vast body of water , the river aduin , and was found pretty fast . 
  same with getting dropped by gollum , it happened in a way that someone found it in mere hours , in the dark and labyrinth bowels of a friggin mountain . 
  the guardian 's small lake would be a simple matter for sauron himself and its soldiers scouring for it . 
  the ring abandoned gollum at its own will and betrayed its bearer since he wasnt sauron . 
  it happened with isildur also after the ambush . 
  it is stated many times in the books and the appendices that the ring does that . 
  where fate intervened was that instead of a mountain goblin , it was a hobbit from far away that found it . 
  2500 years is absolutely nothing for a specific ring to be found in the ** biggest ** river of the world . 
  i am going to drop a ring in the amazon and tell me if there is any chance if someone finding it . 
  and you forget that it is stated that the ring is as weak as sauron is , and it starts affecting its fate and calls all evil more stronger as time passes and its creator call it . 
  there have been numerous new age cults during the 60s and 70s . . 
  detective columbo was pretty rad back in the day i hear . . 
  wait i am confused , ireland is part of the british isles no ? 
  they went deep when the last alliance layed siege to barad-dur for years until sauron got out and was defeated . 
  barad-dur was torn down , and while they didnt colonise mordor itself , the builted watchtowers inside the borders to look into it . 
  the tower that the orcs use as a base to take the paralysed frodo after shelob is actually one them !, 
  as for the orcs , while no targeted effort was done to wipe them out , it was thought ( and it was ) that they got trashed so hard at the war and being leaderless that they wont trouble proper society for a long long time . 
  its the reason isildur decides to take the long way home and with a small defence force because he thought no orcs would dare to get out of their holes . 
  but he didnt know the ring can call saurons servants . . 
  '' and [ saruman ] deemed that the ring , which was sauron 's , would seek for its master as he became manifest once more ; but if he were driven out again , then it would lie hid . '', 
  the ring was laying low as sauron was weak . 
  as his strength was rising , it was trying to get back to him . 
  hence why it didnt bother to be found until it was time . 
  only then , fate highjacked its plan with frodo . 
  `` yet many have thought that the ferocity and determination of their assault on isildur was in part due to the ring . 
  it was little more than two years since it had left his hand , and though it was swiftly cooling it was still heavy with his evil will , and seeking all means to return to its lord ( as it did again when he recovered and was rehoused ) . '', 
  the ring was calling the orcs towards isildur in gladden fields since it was still strong . 
  but as for throwing it away , that was obviously wrong . 
  these rings have a way of being found '', 
  furthermore , during the council of elrond they debate that even the friggin ocean itself will not suffice to hid the ring . 
  but a small lake some hundrend meters across in an orc and goblin infested territory , with sauron knowing the general area they went by will surely stall him for a bit . 
  geographical terms are not neccesary tied only to political terms . 
  see americans and the americas . 
  the british isles indeed include ireland and was called like that before * great * britain or heck england existed . 
  but he didnt say he was british , he said he was 100 % british * isles * . 
  and i am confused why wales or scotland will jave issues being called british as the nationality since they are part of great britain ? 
  being called english on the other hand . . 
  actually some of the most famous uses of greek fire was the destruction of the arab fleets besieging contantinople . 
  i gave you direct passages from the books , even one that outright states that if the ring wants to be found . 
  you proceed to ignore even the clear , simple and short passage about how the ring was outright calling the orcs at gladen fields and spew assumptions and imaginations . 
  i am gave you sources , you are the one that has to provide some . 
  you simply pull stuff out of your head contradicting the writer himself . 
  ahh thank you !, 
  apparently at least [ once ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-happens-when-lightni/ ) a year . 
  so its not that extraordinary considering the weather in the video . 
  no idea . 
  `` hear the preachers '' sounds like a greek colloquialism/idiom literally translated to english , but nothing comes to mind . 
  edit : its literal , they want to hear the sermons from the radio . 
  the last sentence i think it depends on context , that the klan later burned down the old people 's house , which is `` story for another time ... or ( sarcastically ) , the same as the present '' since the writer draws lines between kkk supposed `` philanthropy '' then and the present day golden dawn 's `` philanthropy '' that its only for show . 
  outstanding . 
  are you guys serious ? 
  we are talking about space * pirates * and nobody thought about the ultimate pirate ( black ) [ beard ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/pirates/images/9/9f/blackbeardfountain.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121116204419 ) ? 
  because the wording was all over the place that made even basic stuff dubious . 
  excellent translation in greek and plausible , except a tiny tiny error . 
  yep when they try to escape the big concert . 
  she corners them with it in the sewer , and belushi sweetalk their way out . 
  she hugs her claiming he never forgot her , and when it is apparent they are on the clear he immidietely drops her like a bag of potetoes and they proceed to gtfo . 
  going dogmatic `` far left '' i think will stifle discussion in a place that is already considered a small safe haven from the mainstream of reddit . 
  ** triggered **, 
  the clone wars , with all its deaths , pain and hatred all over the place also helped hiding him . 
  i am assuming a dark force led , oppresive , galaxy wide empire would also diminish their senses even if he wasnt actively trying to hide . 
  i dont remember the animatrix scene exactly , but i think its not a problem with death , but that he is not usefull anymore . 
  agents have no issue when their host is shot to the head with a desert eagle , so they probably dont want to jump to someone that is dying because it will be a short lived transition anyways and/or the body might me handicapped for chasing . 
  after they saved leia and escape with the millenium falcon , vader asks if the tracking device is on board . 
  its how they found out yavin iv because lea would not break even after alderaan . 
  if they killed everyone it would kinda defeat their plan no ? 
  leia had to survive because it she was the only one that knew where the base was . 
  so when she was with the group they would not do their best in danger of killing her , like the tight corners of the cell bay . 
  and they need to lrt the pilot , that they dont know who is , alive to get her out . 
  they have more chances to simply let anyone get out except one that has to die , a jedi that they easily corner and unsuprisingly kill . 
  i assume on what happened on scene . 
  you assume quite more complex stuff out of vapor . 
  plus the dual cockpit is the same from the hind .
