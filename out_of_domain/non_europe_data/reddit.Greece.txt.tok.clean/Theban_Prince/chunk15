  `` civilian '', 
  when a monty python 's joke devolves into a grammar and linguistics debate . . 
  ... actually they would love this . 
  now i will have to write `` the lack of majestic m\u00f6\u00f6se tags is disturbing '' a hundred times . 
  that does n't make sense actually ... bug ? 
  nice trick . . 
  a good character would find a way to not kill the priest and save the country.if their is no other options , it is the dm fuck up for shoehorning the pcs not an alignments issue . 
  what about people that buy it so they can burn it ? 
   when half the talent in your country is willfully sidelined ( women ) , ethnic minorities are almost nowhere to be found in the national or state legislatures or positions of power anywhere , and , in the case of japanese-americans , even shipped off to internment camps during world war ii under fdr 's orders , and elite universities deliberately institute quotas for jewish , catholic , and black students if they admitted them at all , and the upper echelons of power are occupied almost exclusively by white christian men , there is no conceivable way to argue that the u.s. was '' a relative meritocracy . '', 
  we 're miles ahead of where we were then and we 're still not a meritocracy . 
  you do realize that at that time those minorities where ** persecuted ** , ** gassed ** and ** burned ** in the rest of the world , and people where pushing for that to happen to the us ,, 
  right ? 
  is it me or does that the mail looks like it was written by two different people ? 
  the part from `` dear christian ... ... couple of videos '' looks very aggressive compared to the `` well please ... . our relationship '' part , i do n't know if it is the photo , but it looks like a different font also . 
  i have noticed that some games have tied cards with achievements so i do n't think it will work for everything . 
  well , he clearly demonstrated that he can take care of a pussy . 
   absolutely , but there 's no grounds to argue that the u.s. was a meritocratic paradise at the time , and certainly not in comparison to the present day . 
  certainly , but i do n't think the previous commenter used extremes like `` meritocratic paradise '' . he simply stated that relatively with the socioeconomical status of the 30 's ( and not a present day comparison ) fdr made things better , especially compared with the other solutions of the time , fascism and stalinist communism.context makes all . 
  because youtube and social networks as legitimate source of information , revenue and marketing during the 10 's can be compared with the internet during the 90 's . most execs in the gaming industry right now are over their 30 's ( some are pushing 40 's ) so they have lost connection with what is relative to the younger ages.they know social media are hot , and they are going to try to use them , but they really do n't understand how they work , same as execs perceived the internet during the 90 's . 
  yes , that is why he is using past tense `` most people no longer ** had ** a problem with it . '', 
  he simply said that fdr chose the best solution at the time :, 
   '' the us remained a ** relative ** meritocracy '', 
  i think what he is trying to say is that , while us might be a better place now than during frds time , it would be even better if reagan have n't chose the `` neo-liberal road '' . fdr chose the masses , reagan chose the aristocracy . 
   maybe ... but i work in online retail which you would think would have a worse version of this effect , and our managers and executives are extremely aware of and push constantly for exposure on new media . 
  this is exactly what i said.every marketing exec worth a single penny would push hard for new media promotion . 
  that does n't mean everyone understands it . 
  i can imagine a marketing meeting going like this :, 
  `` we must create a youtube channel where we can put our cliche storm ads and payed actor videos where they `` prefer '' our products . 
  everyone in the market is on it so we must also do it . 
  what ? 
  a youtube `` celebrity '' wants to get an interview?tell him to fuck off and get back to his basement ... . 
  ... he made a parody video criticizing our product ? 
  send him an intimidating cease and desist mail , its not like anyone will care . '', 
  takes the term `` risky click '' on another level . 
   the problem is n't that they 're ** `` lol old '' ** ; it 's that they were never gamers / tech people in the first place . 
  they did n't fall out of touch . 
  they were never in touch in the first place . 
  i never used that kind of language . 
  and a lot of people in the gaming industry right now grow up during the 80 's and 90 's , and they * were * gamers and early internet users , but this market moves so fast right now you lose touch in 5 to 10 years . 
  i am 28 , and i already know that i am becoming irrelevant.for the late millennials , as might as well be 50 . 
  the funny thing is that facebook and twitter are starting to age , or at least they are at their prime.in 2-5 years the online landscape will be quite different . 
  probably a hybrid between facebook ( ease of use , pleasing ui ) and reddit ( instant info , customization ) . 
  edit : fixes, 
  i would give you some \u03c1\u03b5\u03b4\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4 denarii if i could .

  i transliterated . 
  the proper ( modern ) greek would be \u03a1\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4 . 
  the denarius is nsfw ... romans even had naughty coinage ? 
  plutarch was using reddit during the 2nd century?talk about a hipster . 
  ( i still do n't get what you are trying to tell me.either plutarch or modern the eta is wrong . ), 
  that cunnus , the praefecti annonae , is holding back again ... 
  yeah ... my 3 ( high school ) years in latin can go cry in the corner today.they had their only chance after 10 years and they fucked up . 
  typical karlings . 
  for most of my games it goes periodically.one good karling unites most of the titles , he survives the initial civil wars , kicks ass in europe , then he croaks , cue endless karling slaughtering each other.repeat ad auseam, 
  yeah i just read that . 
  but as i said it was a transliteration to be more easier for foreigners to understand the joke . 
  however , the generation you are describing is already maturing market wise.it will be only some years before they lose connection with nascent trends in the new media , and the marketeers will be in an even worse situation.in normal markets that happens after lots of years , maybe decades.according to my opinion that is already happening , that is why they are ignoring youtubers . 
  gentes minores here.you can suck my c\u014dle\u012b . 
  just do n't kill me and parade me in front of the romans.other than that you can do whatever you like mr.octavian . 
  the cell is becoming a movie , and john will star on it ... with samuel l. jackson?did i died and went to heaven ? 
   we 've been through that .

  if a teacher doenst know it , talk about a `` forgotten war '', 
  well that is exactly why they built the city on the island in the first, 
  place . 
  how do you think a single city became so powerful and surviving so many centuries?being on an island and a naval power so most enemies said `` eh does n't worth it , just fuck it give me some ducats . '', 
  i think they are [ pretty awesome and practical ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/1090220895_1/-font-b-cargo-b-font-font-b-capri-b-font-short-for-man-cotton-zipper.jpg ) for a hot day without resorting to shorts .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ what ? 
  i will have to explain orbital mechanics when i am far from qualified to do that . 
  ok first lets try orbit and what is it . 
  orbit is achieved when an object has enough speed to run completely around the earth . 
  imagine if you have thrown a rock towards the horizon , and every time you throwed it farther and farther ( and no air existed to slowed it down ) . 
  eventually the rock will go so fast that will go all the way around the planet and never fall down.it has achieved orbit.you can practice that also with a rock tied to the end of a string and turning it really fast with your hand.as you turn it faster , then the rock will make better and higher cicles . 
  so lets say i explained orbit ( i doubt it ) . well when a space ship is in orbit ( as i explaied , running really fast in one direction ) and launches a missile , the missile will have the same speed like the spaceship.to get it to the planet you have to slow it down , so it can fall back to earth , so the best option is to go opposite ( so , backwards ) the way the spaceship is going . 
  hope i explained something . 
  i was about to edit the comment that venice is using the `` british doctrine of we-are-an-island-fuckoff-continental-peasants '', 
  so the epitome of reddit ? 
  damnit dude , i just left the shop i work that is named exactly like your username ( seve ) after the worst day ever.just as i was finally calmed , i got a single message , from you ... damn you coincidence god !, 
  the horror ...

  the trailer picked my interested because i am not a comic book fan . 
  for some reason i got a lot of european comics / 5th element vibes from the video . 
  i cross fingers this is not another boring superhero movie .

  the time added is usually 1 to 3 minutes per half . 
  while you can pay a ref to add a couple of mins , he ca n't to go over board , because people will become suspicious . 
  so you have 2-3 extra mins . 
  however that time is extremely limited for a team , particularly a losing one , to turn a game . 
  while it has happened with goals on the last sec , it is very inconsistent to regularly corrupt refs for that . 
  `` gifting '' refs for arbitrary penalties however ... 
  my guess is that we 'll see it 2016 ~ ~ maybe late 2015 ~ ~ with euiv and hoi iv converters , if we 're lucky .
