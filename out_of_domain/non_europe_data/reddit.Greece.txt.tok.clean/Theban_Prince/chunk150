  just scream in quenya `` i want to talk to the leader '' repeadetly as you run . 
  the pilots will respect your lotr nerd power and the great sound of this foreign voice so much they might even allow you to touch the controls !, 
  because it is a videogame . 
  in real life you make your survival top priority , and even then you die . 
  in eve its a mild inconvieniece so why spare a second thought ? 
  yeah . 
  the european commenters accept his wrong conceptions and ask for the guy to chill out . 
  no need to . 
  friendly jabs aside , i do n't think anybody really believes in the `` canadians are always the nicest people '' stereotype . 
  one guys says that europe should replace nato with an eu army , since you have stronger ties with your neighbors than with transatlantic areas . 
  nothing really crazy , even if you do n't agree , especially considering the netherlands , have very strong trade ties with germany for example and people hop of the surrounding borders all their time . 
  then the canadian tells him to go fuck himself because nazis . 
  totally reasonable . 
  he owns that fault thouht and he was being polite in general . 
  and he made that comment after the canadian was a dick . 
  yeah no , you told him to go fuck before he made that mistake . 
  yo we are not going to take your head !, 
  just having a bit of fun because your comment was quite similar with some americans . 
  everyone has a bad day now and then . 
   part of the building permit process is getting the work inspected and approved, 
  assuming this is in the us, 
  man if venus de milo is considered vuglar by anyone they will have a baaad time in any greek museum . 
  little dicks and tits everywhere !, 
  also , pornography . 
  taking pictures , keeping pictures and selling pictures are three difderent actions . 
  its like someone * reselling * photos . 
  well i feel we have no winning side in this one . 
  both are terrible . 
  they do n't see a human being . 
  they see a [ weak subhuman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dehumanization ) that used underhanded tactics to steal and oppress the real humans . 
  would you feel bad if it was a tick removed from your skin ? 
  this is how they see it . 
  similarities with the present are , surprisingly , ** not ** coincidental . 
  the question was rhetorical . 
  its irrelevant what we think , but its imperative to understand how human being conditioned themselves to do what they did . 
  i used the animal analogy because the nazis specifficaly compared the jews to animals like rats in their [ propaganda ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/fe/90/85/fe908596a9051c633b32ef3fca88b05f.jpg ) . 
  blame them !, 
  how is a fallacious argument exactly ? 
  i was talking about dehumanization . 
  animals are commonly considered inferior to humans , or at least it is a easy symbolism that it can appeal to most . 
  case in point , dehumanizing propaganda [ from ] ( https://northstarguide.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/madbrute.jpg ) [ various ] ( http://media.brainz.org/uploads/2010/03/propaganda/anti-jap8.jpg ) [ places ] ( http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c24/improvedarchie/eliminationist.jpg ) and times use them . 
   they themselves have been dehumanized . 
  true . 
  propaganda loves creating group mentality , hence the [ uniforms ] ( http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/images/hitler%20youth%20on%20parade.jpg ) , the [ symbols ] ( http://iranpoliticsclub.net/photos/nazi-girls5/images/nazi%20german%20girls%20cheering%20for%20hitler.jpg ) , the illustrious [ gatherings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tqcdxbc.png ) , the synchronous [ actions ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/m/img/14495-700x.jpg ) , the [ military parades ] ( https://youtu.be/3rcuaxrq8_i?t=2m12s ) of soldiers that look like clones . 
  hell even language is subverted . 
  because it crushes individuality , it is essentially peer pressure at maximum levels , you are not a human being that takes his own decisions , but you are part of a huge group that does what it want , and you are just a tiny part of it . 
  so you do n't hold responsibility ( or so you believe ) because * everyone * is complicit . 
  yes it is terrifying . 
  even more so because everyone can fall for it at any point . 
  even me , even you . 
  because next time they will not use the same symbols or enemies , and they will first appeal on your primal fear for your loved ones , the same feeling that makes us go beyond even our survival instinct when the need arises , like when fathers dive to flames to save their kids . 
  what if someone or even worse , some subhuman * thing * was danger for your loved ones ? 
  where would you stop to protect them ? 
  and if you feel ever remorse , you have your coworkers , your neighbors and your friends beside you to support you . 
  well apparently you can , considering thousands of soldiers not only humiliated but * executed * millions . 
  propaganda is not magic , it does n't absolve them from their actions . 
  but it definitely helped something that was already there . 
  well germans didnt exterminate like these guys seem do . 
  they exterminated methodically , with plans , logistic and assemply lines . 
  they were clearing the world from a dangerous pest . 
  like mosquitos . 
  just some guys played with the soon to be dead suhuman . 
  if thsy have the mentality to exterminate his whole village down to the children , a `` tease '' is not that bad to them . 
  they spend an entire episode with multiple `` thrilling '' escape chances . 
  that you already know they are going to fail . 
  yep . 
  the wheel just goes round and round crunching the weak . 
  as i write this lines and when you read them , someone somewhere is murdering , abducting , raping , and/or torturing someone . 
  and as he does so , he definitely has a `` valid '' justification in his mind . 
  there is absolutely no relevance that she is an ex-gw poster . 
  the people calling her out are justified . 
  she thought a bunch of virgins will fawn over her while preaching sympathy . 
  pretty low behavior . 
  yep . 
  just confining this in the photo context . 
  i would bet the guy is working on a restaurant cuisine . 
  sensei8 , oa abd bubblegum have made me very averse of the `` netflix original '' brand . 
  marco polo was one that made me hopefull , but then i found this thread . 
  to me it seems that netflix , trying to sten the problems of right is tryibg to flood with its content . 
  and it is trash . 
  dont want to spoil your circlejerk , but if we go with the old fashioned meaning of `` retarded '' , for example persons with down syndrome , its statutory rape . 
  but more power to you !, 
  they almost wiped out the indigenous people and they where lucky that have only two neighbors , one is a underpopulated and the other faces internal problems for centuries . 
  they havent won a single war where they led ( korea was a stalemate , vietnam , iraq and afganistan have failed ) unless it was a tiny country like panama or had most of their other great powers in their side . 
  can you give me sources please ? 
  also those are not necessarily equal with being able to give sexual consent . 
  there are cases of teens being given certain legal rights premptively , but that doesnt mean they can go and do porn . 
  it is unfortunately , impossible due to game engine . 
  its not possible . 
  planets are a completely diffent thing than ships and kerbals . 
  you can change parameters before the game loads but not in real time . 
  plus some goverments cover dental exams and operations . 
  i am not aware of this mod , but again i doubt it unless it changed a huge huge part of the engine . 
  planets in ksp are `` terrain '' something that behaves quite differently that the rest objects and it is usually hardcoded . 
  same way an adult cam have full powers but still suffer sexual crimes when there is sexual imbalance ( prisoners for example ) . 
  all these ofcourse are different in each juristiction and country . 
  i am guessing the figure he saw there would try to strike him down but nothing would happen . 
  the point was for him to let the fear ( that feeds the dark side ) for his life go and be calm . 
  its how he achieves his victory in the exact same ( only real ) situation at the end of the trilogy . 
  it means `` christ has came back to life '' .
