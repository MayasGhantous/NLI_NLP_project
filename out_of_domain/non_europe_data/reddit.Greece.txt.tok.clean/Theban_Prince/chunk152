  thing is , it got muddled by a constructed ideological argument that causes a shitstorm for even basic sane gun control . 
  in all seriousness with an / s at the end of your comment . 
  you might have been taken seriously because the `` african built only mudhuts until the white man brought them civilisation '' is a [ legit racist argument ] ( http://i.imgur.com/86ttd.jpg ) . 
  in defence , it would be like ea making a fifa game where everything , running , shooting etc happens automatically with a sinlge button . 
  meaning `` what the fuck where they thinking neutering a core concept of the series ? 
  travel east at first . 
  talk with anyone that doesnt have a generic name or a special description when looked at . 
  the vast majority of the quests are selfcontained in the cities you enter and get them . 
  small guns , gifted and speech are a must for a new guy . 
  90 % + of the mechanics are the same in fo2 and the areas are more bigger so you can get lost way easier . 
  that was i am trying to say , it was * that * bad . 
  its the same reason we still talk about, 
  `` showgirls '' or ed wood in cinema . 
  this one is pretty light and inclusive to be honest . 
  it portrays iranians and chinese as human beings . 
  quite rare . 
  well its a culture shock but until you understand how the game `` works '' then it is quite easy . 
  most games of an era use similar mechanics because they know that players are familiar with them from other games . 
  for example , before and during the fallout era it was usually assumed that plot relevant npcs would be indicated by their placement and description mostly with generic npcs have simple or no routines . 
  nowdays with intricate ambient routines like skyrim and visual differences between every single character you need quest markers . 
  jumping to the old way can seem confusing until ypu get how it works . 
  the hints i have were some basic stuff to get started . 
  fallout is a suprisingly linear difficulty game . 
   have n't had much experience with full fascism, 
  or they have been right in the edge for decades , sometimes tasting the waters , and now they simply jumped . 
  remember the red scare ? 
  the jimmy crow laws ? 
  the trail of tears ? 
  banana republics ? 
  heck everyone forgets `` company towns '' for the blue collar americans themselves . 
  at least other empires did n't have a bullshit `` freedom for all ! '', 
  fake paint over them . 
   depose your leader . 
  oh dont worry you already done that in 67 . 
  or at least you `` officialy '' held a `` neutral stance '' when a european democracy and nato member became a brutal dictatorship using the us gladio plans . 
  dont worry , they cut up their way out and run as fast as the could all alone . 
  and after theater night no less !, 
  the official full name of the greek state is republic of greece . 
  we invented the goddamn system . 
  ** take a wild guess what that word is . 
  umm defcon 2 is pretty high . 
  like `` start fueling the birds and praying to whatever god '' high . 
  oh you indeed are slow . 
  and i cant find a single job because all of them are bilingual . 
  if you are searching something like that r/imaginarylandscapes and the whole network or r/imaginary has very similar stuff . 
  pretty much . 
  there nude photos/cards at the time people used to trade around . 
  thats . . the exact meaning of heroic . 
  unfortunately it was very inaccurate . 
  they found themselves dropped all over the place . 
  this gif should be used in classes for first perceptions and reasearching further . 
  unlock the requirment of having a title or game over aka landless characters . 
  that would open up theocracies , baronies , full on mercenary bands and a lot of mod potential . 
  i think a lot of the last dlcs ( inventories , societies , etc ) are pointing to that since it fixes the one major problem of landless characters : not a lot of things to do . 
  yeah i remember , it was mostly a word play , 
  what happens to a story driven web comic that you have been making for 10 years and you get a decent income out of it and the story ends ? 
  distance in feet dhould be divided by 3 though , 
  wait , i know its fake , but the son was an adult , he bought all these games himself , has graduated for only three months and had a ( somewhat '' ) legit idea ( game streamers can make money ) . 
  i would burn that shredder down . 
  balance a not when both sides of the force are balanced . 
  similar when cancer is not a valid alternative to healthy cells . 
  anakun brought balance when he killed the emperor , not when he went all darth . 
  he cant see you immedietely . 
  the ring makes you more visible byt uts nit a tracking device . 
  and aragorn , if he was carrying it in the last battle there is no nedd for him to wear it until the last minute . 
  true . 
  i really wish dnd switched at some point . 
  but then it might feel weird !, 
  feet sound like made up measure unit from a campaign setting !, 
  then how can we measure how deep you are ? 
  it cam actually reach a meltdown stage . . 
  if you can do those why not do them already ( except the side stories ) when the ip is in fashion and selling ? 
  however the story has to end at some point no ? 
  that will cause a drop of viewers . 
  has anyone you know got sucked in by mlm scums ? 
  it feels exactly the same . 
  if you are close , de valeras in flagey might showit also . 
  and has some mean burgers . 
  unfortunately i am swamped and i dont know shit about rugby : /, 
  the gallente industrials have a huge nose for cockpit . 
  once you see it . . 
  as u/beatleboy62 said , what we experienced here in greece is that the numbers of sports ( and oufsource number of facilities ) have become grossly inflated . 
  the football stadiums ( that most of them actually preexisted and were just renovated ) the basketball stadiums etc are still frequently used . 
  the beach volley or softball stadiums on the other hand . . 
  the biggest drain though was security , it cost about 1.2 billion alone . 
  finally greece had already a very healthy tourism , and the olympics did n't open new markets that much . 
  since you love castles , you should know its not one , but a palace made to look like one , 
  it appears nerfs have transitioned to the [ new canon ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/nerf ) pretty much unchanged . 
  so apparently the stinky space lamas are not bloated needless expansion to get left behind , but old republic , korriban and revan ? 
  yeah fuck that noise . 
  yup . 
  exactly that . 
  but olympics always had a lot of security concerns since they have already been targeted before 9/11 ( munich , atlanta pipe bombs etc ) . 
  problem is security was handled by companies that already had huge connection with domestic corruption ( like [ siemens ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9502146/debt-crisis-greek-government-signs-330m-settlement-with-siemens.html ) ) possibly inflating the costs even further . 
  well scratch that , after writing the block of text i thought to google `` one legged fairies '' intead of the one i wwas using before `` one legged devil etc '' . 
  the book is a very famous one in brazil , and its called [ `` o saci . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saci_\\ ( brazilian_folklore \\ ) #in _ popular_culture ) '', 
  yes they have skirted a around around it a lot , but did n't come out right and tell it , and that leads me to argument `` nuh nuh thats not korriban that morraband '' anytime i start a discussion about it . 
  i do n't think castles like that ever existed in medieval times . 
  they where really a crucial military asset and quite costly to pay for vanity things .
