  i had the exact same vision , belkar shanking her from off panel . 
  and then asking in a serious tone `` what ? 
  yeah i did n't want to go there but if you dig a bit the vast majority of the right wing conspiracies have jews behind them . 
  i dint say conspiracy theories as a concept originate from the 1970s only . 
  the protocols of the elders of zion , the fluoride in water/anti vaccination craze are examples of older theories . 
  i thought it was for sapping and impurifying all of our precious bodily fluids ? 
  i dpbt thing `` bong '' is used anywhere in europe . 
  got overshadowed by matrix at the time unfortunately . 
  i think its one of the the reasons shooying are so common crime in the us . 
  if you want to become a criminal , you wil get prepared for a potentional shooting much and get geared with anything you can find . 
  in europe most mugging and burglaries happen with knives and the perpetators are more `` chill '' and mighy not immiedietely shank you if you even move . 
  they dont ever need to run . 
  a twitching or sudden movement can cause someone to riddle you with bullets because you might be going for you `` concealed weapon ' . 
  and ofcourse the same fears extends to the police . 
  abd with all those guns floating around , why not do a drive by on those troublesome dude fron the other hood abd be done with it ? 
  and it keeps going like thst . 
   that is n't because reuters or ap are quantifiably better press . 
   they do n't attempt to put events in perspective of each other . 
  they do n't offer specialist analysis . 
  i disagree , that is the reason why they are better press . 
  it is all too common for new agencies ( but not all , i hate the term `` the media '' ) to mix reporting a fact , with opinion and analysis on the first , initial report . 
  this can muddle or create assumptions for the reader that usually stick around . 
  instead the proper way would be `` this thing happened '' and then another , obvious opinion article `` why this thing that happened is bad/good for you '' . 
  you do realize that uranus moons are names of characters from shakespeare 's comedies right ? 
  now if you went back in time and asked an englishman what he thinks about that he would find it funny and/or ridiculous because shakespeare was for a while considered a young upstart who was n't on par with more `` serious writers '' of his time :, 
   '' ... there is an upstart crow , beautified with our feathers , that with his tiger 's heart wrapped in a player 's hide , supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you : and being an absolute johannes factotum , is in his own conceit the only shake-scene in a country . '', 
   scholars differ on the exact meaning of greene 's words , [ 31 ] but most agree that greene was accusing shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as christopher marlowe , thomas nashe , and greene himself ( the so-called `` university wits '' ) . 
  imagine if you traveled 200 years in the future and found out someone has named moons out of game of thrones characters . 
  so get off your high horse . 
  i did n't said you can have either one or the other . 
  what i am talking about is the tendency to lump * everything * in the same article/paragraph/headline . 
  even in your example :, 
  `` potato production up 1.3 % despite fears of blight spreading '' is a headline . 
  * who * had fears of blight spreading ? 
  you will have to read the article to find out , and dig up its resources to validate that yes , there was a legit reason for fears . 
  but your title has already set up the tone and passed information to the reader . 
  the proper way would be `` potato production up 1.3 % '' and then in the article itself * maybe * point that * x * sources were worried about blight . 
   large tracts of land . 
  for [ reference . 
  ] ( http://www.chucrew.com/twilekcelebration/gallery/albums/userpics/10002/normal_captureds.jpg ), 
  you seem to think i am accusing the media for malice or deception by default . 
  you also seem to think that i dont accept analysis in articles . 
  i say neither of those things . 
  what i am saying is that the initial report should not have analysis or opinions for the `` sake of readability '' and there should be a clear indication what articles are analysis/opinion . 
  finally , there is a pretty clear middle ground from posting raw research data to `` 10 reasons potatoes are not dying this summer and how will this effect your atkins '' . 
  hyberbole is easy . 
   that seems like an arbitrary distinction to me . 
  its not , there are guidelines and pretty distinct ways and methods of writing articles , analyses etc. 
  why do you think we have writing/journalism schools ? 
  even a title can be written with quite different ways , and if you know what to look for , you can see the intention of the writer has and what responses from the reader he was trying to achieve . 
  even a seemingly trivial change can convey a different meaning , for our example , `` potato production is up 1.3 % '' is different from '' potato production is up 1.3 % , despite predictions of blight '' . 
  the first simply states potatoes are up . 
  the later is focusing that predictions about blight have failed . 
   i would never read an article called `` potato production up 1.3 % '' unless i already had some basis for understanding that number . 
  providing context up front for why this number is meaningful sparks interest in the subject and also indicates why this is newsworthy . 
  in a perfect world , every situation is newsworthy and readers would be interested in even the most mundane facts . 
  alas this is not that case , but as i said , there is a distinct middle ground and a way to do `` proper journalism '' , along with specialization . 
  that title might not catch * your * eye in reddit , but it would be very interesting for someone that reads a publication that is focused on agriculture or the economy . 
   in the realm of possibility , sometimes people want to know why things are important before they invest time . 
  true . 
  that 's why we have article titles . 
  * and that 's why titles should not be editorialized as much as possible * . 
  i will get triggered in the stead of the belgians until one get here and takes over properly . 
  i hope you enjoy get cursed in three languages !, 
  however you can get cysticercosis from the dude that ate the uncooked pork . 
  admit that he did nothing wrong is a stretch . 
  a lot of people had shitty lives but they didnt massacre chlidren . 
  make us more understandable yes . 
   also who said moons named after got characters would be good/nice ? 
  that would be equal absurd, 
  thats the point * mate * uranus already has equivalent names yet they do n't sound absurd . 
  the only way to avoid talking was using the mysterious devices we we had called `` newspapers '' or even `` paperbacks '' . 
  hos moons are named after shakespeare characters . 
  are you even capable of reading the messages i send ? 
  apparently not , but you should check it out . 
  shakespeare was considered an untalented hack when he started then years later people named moons out of his comedies and nobody cared . 
  its actually no that far fetched to imagine that you can have names other than those that sound like a bad sci-fi flick ( i mean martel ? 
  thats right out of mass effect ) like from pop culture , since you know , it has already happened . 
  do you understand now ? 
  or do i need to say it slow ? 
   do n't pretend like you are the ` smart ' or whatever you think you are with your condencending tone . 
  looks who 's talking !, 
   typical belgians to make something amazing as space/universe stuff sound so cringy, 
  when you discover an * entire solar system * you can choose to name it as you want , `` smart guy '' . 
  that would be even better . 
  they never managed to get him off . 
  they sprayed him with water , but he was like `` huh ? '', 
  then he chilled for a couple of minutes checking his surroundings and then he left at his leisure . 
  this is what happens when you have an actual monarchy . 
  * how did he know ... *, 
  so there is only black and white in your world ? 
  of course democracies can have similar issues , but in monarchy they are part of the core of the institution . 
  and in management schools for crisis training . 
  this is brought up in the prevention part , since they had multiple warnings from other clients but they chose to ignore it without sufficient research . 
  source : ba in management . 
  had a case study of this . 
  the problem with nuclear weapons is that the leaders have at * best * some hours of warning before anything happens . 
  even if one of the secondary power launches , what do you do ? 
  keep your birds cold and waiting or start fueling them in case someone else goes for it now that someone broke the taboo ? 
  and you have to consider that your enemy will also see your birds getting prepped and he might also start preparing just in case * you * are the one trying to do a sneak attack and this can snowball into apocalypse .
