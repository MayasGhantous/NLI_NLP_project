  if you read how many times we reached that point , you would be horrified . 
  as a matter of fact russia was very alarmed just a few months ago when a scandinavian university launched a missile for scientific purposes and the due to miscommunication not all services where forewarned as it is normal . 
  now imagine if that had happened during a period of high tensions ... 
   also , i think the old propaganda posters have disappeared because they 'd rather you focus on the bread and circuses, 
  no i think they stopped because they are futile at this point . 
  if global nuclear war erupts you should pray you get caught in the blast because your horror will only last for 10-20 minutes , then you will be dust . 
  you other options are getting your body slowly getting liquefied from radiation or dying from famine and disease . 
  `` where the winds blows '' is also on the same level . 
  as a matter of fact i have read multiple stuff from 50s propaganda pieces to pamphlets , declassified nato documents and research papers about climate changes in case of global war , and even run some nice simulations that float around about casualties and fallout spread depending of yields ( which are not scientifically strong , that it is true , but they do give a very rough indication ) . 
  is that enough for you your honor ? 
  care to enlighten us ? 
  ahahahahahahahahaha . . wait are you serious ? 
  at the present time , there are about * 10000 * warheads in the world . 
  most of them will take mere hours at best to get ready and launched . 
  [ this ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=340&amp;lat=40.72422&amp;lng=-73.99611&amp;hob_opt=1&amp;hob_psi=5&amp;hob_ft=7151&amp;casualties=1&amp;ff=50&amp;zm=12 ) a very rough estimate of what happens if a single b61 warhead explodes in ny . 
  *** the us has 3200 of them *** . 
  even ignoring the radioactivity , can you please explain to me how destruction of human life will be * significantly * less or how they can have a meaningfull warning beforehand ? 
   assuming nobody is prepared for it . 
  actually the population numbers are lower than expected, 
   having access to shelter , even if it 's just a concrete building significantly increases a persons survival rate . 
  ok lets avoid the issues of the need to evacuate the entire new york metropolitan area in * maximum * 1 hour ( and you forget slbms , that have a time arrival of 10-20 minutes ) . 
  lets forget the huge , gargantuan bunkers you would need to safeguard even a minuscule part of the population for at least some days minimum . 
  what happens when you have no electricity ? 
  what happens now that you do n't have harbors great enough to sustain trade of the vast proportions needed for the population , or you do n't have roads to bring any food and oil , and sewage and hospital systems have completely broken down . 
  and this is just a tiny part of the huge problems that are going to arise , that otherwise as alone incidents would spark a nationwide and humanitarian crisis . 
  to give you how it would go down , imagine if hurricane katrina happened in ** all cities of the country ** simultaneously . 
  and those cities are on fire . 
  and in addition the air , soil and water are poisonous with horrific [ results ] ( http://www.atomicarchive.com/effects/effects15.shtml ) . 
  this is the ** best ** possible scenario . 
  bitcoin , iambeingdetained , anarchocapitalism and t_d consistently provide libertarian gems , along with more obscure but even more crazy/extreme subreddits . 
  i mean , did you know that goddamn anarcho * monarchists * exist ? 
  i would n't if this sub did n't exist . 
   downvote if you can see this . 
  i am a master of my own free will you goddamn oppressor . 
   so would you describe yourself as . 
  i will not allow anyone to stick labels to me !, 
  i would love at least some more detail in the map to be honest . 
  roads , some farmland/buildings and such some fluff to fill up the map , even if it is there just for the looks , because the previous one felt very very empty and a bit amateur . . 
  if scarlet is owned by proximus , i wonder if i ave to pay the 100 for installations fees ... 
  this is not a movie . 
  earth is full of bones and ruins of civilizations that didnt make it . 
  it * can * happen to us . 
  that makes more sense . 
  i mean i already have the router and proximus internet . 
  if its owned by proximus , cant i make the switch without inuring the `` fees '' for establishing a new connection ( not the installation ones ) ? 
  i will !, 
  and i will stop bothering you because i can simply call them xd, 
  bias is unavoidable . 
  however you can safeguard yourself by getting informed by multiple independent sources if you want and have a clearer picture . 
  yeah . 
  and be wary if a source is claiming its the sole bearer of undisputed truth and * all * others and * only * the others are corrupted . 
  you should * still * read it , but with major hesitation and double checking . 
  mosy devs base their financial prospects on the sales that happen on the first week afaik from amas . 
  it also helps generate hype ( we are duscussing the game afterall ) creating a marketing boon and a sales feedback loop . 
  true bu they inly started getting traction mainly afterr the middle of the decade after waco and ruby ridge but went mainstream at the end if the decade / early 2000s . 
  millenialism didnt help either . 
  what the flying fuck . 
  how old these people are ? 
  do they throw people that cant walk off their wheelchairs and laugh ? 
  and trump was elected in 2016 only a year later . 
  these things do not happen out of the blue . 
  he simply rode the wave that was already there . 
  based on his flair i wouldnt invite him anywhere close an imperium world . . 
  are you waiting for someone from pl to pay for it ? 
  hear heat . 
  i mean there is n't even a proper apply button . . 
  well that explains a lot of my waiting in the army for once . 
  ahhh je comprends , merci !, 
  while very tired of empiredidnothing wrong memes , the jedi did behave like massive pricks . 
  especially in clone wars . 
  yes i am sure a movie calling rural white * racist as hell * folks idiots will rile up ** sjws ** . 
  you are not a nerd if you play dnd neither you become a jock if you play football . 
  yiy become those when you start self identifying by your goddamn hobbies . 
  i think these dudes went above and beyond . 
  i get crazy if i dint get washed at least once a day . 
  i think you are confusing `` uncut '' with `` people that are gross anyway '' . 
  the vagina can get also pretty icky quite fast if the lady isnt so carefull . 
  the * nation * ? 
  so the us state has it into a forbidden list ? 
  a movie can have dragons dressed as myley cyrus that shit reindeer . 
  if they keep internal logic its not a problem . 
  but when they insert well known real life things to compare like jesus they seem dumb . 
  like prometheus was . 
  also what humanity did so bad , when the engineers where also warlike cratures ? 
  neither of those traits are or will be uncommon in nature . 
  and the engineers had military bases , ships and terraforming/bio-weapons , so its not like they where paragons of purity . 
  their emmisary was a dumbass since he preached all about rye and camels instead of warning everyone he can kill them with his boomstick ( why the hell he went undercover ?! ), 
  unless they listen to him . 
  this movie gets more dumb everytime i read something about . 
  this post right here is a very good example of what keeps me away from approaching a lodge . 
  drama for fees , sexuality , or old/young people gap sounds like an old ladies club . 
  hawt, 
  however a lot of the fatalities in the movies are caused by human making critical errors and/or treason , like ignoring carantine in the first one , keeping the soldiers uninformed on what they are against or stupid orders ( no big weapons allowed ) in the second etc. 
  in almost all movies its not only the aliens that are the villain , but also weyland yutani . 
  in axiom you have robots that truly care for humans ( even the navigator was ultimately trying to protect them ) with guns , sensors , medical tools to scan for chestbusters etc. 
  unless the infestation goes for long enough to get the bots overwhelmed , and i dont see how , the aliens chances are low . 
  it even has aggresive expansion mechanics . 
  no more than the reflection of yourself in a mirror is a copy of you . 
  its the same principle the rays bouncing back to your eye take some time to get there , but in real life the `` lag '' is so infinetely small you will never perceive it . 
  i have the feeling ( wishfull ? ),
