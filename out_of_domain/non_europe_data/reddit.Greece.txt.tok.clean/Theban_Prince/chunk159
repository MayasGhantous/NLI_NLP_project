  if companies released games based om fans impatience we would habe game released the same day the first trailer got released . 
  most probable cause is good quarterly reports . 
  i am bit fuzzy on the details . 
  i think there is a snopes article about it . 
  it also predates any attacks by many years . 
  you do realise crucifiction and hence , crosses , was a widely adopted punishment in the roman empire right ? 
  also as a native greek speaker with classical studies , zeus has entirely different pronounciation than iesous . 
  zeus is pronounced zephs ( like zephyr the wind ) while iesous a bit like yesous . 
  its definetely not a new phenomenon, 
  chicken . 
  rifcken . 
  rooftop . 
  this exactly what you did here . 
  zeus and jesus are not even writen withe the same letters in original greek ( \u0396\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0399\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ) ! . 
  the sigma at the end exists in every male name/noun ever ( \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf * \u03c2 * , \u03a0\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf * \u03c2 * , \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 * \u03c2 * ) . 
  for this and the rest , the mind hoops you need to jump to reach your conclusions are staggering . 
  heck you are doing word `` evolution '' in the wrong language !, 
  i suggest ou evaluate your theories with the same critical eye i am sure you evaluate the `` maibstream trash the sheeple believe '' . 
  dont do it for me or anyone , do it for you . 
  okay then . 
  explain to me how \u0396\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 leads to \u0399\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 . 
  i know . 
  its the other dudes that think they did it because of the charlie hebdo attacks and `` got scared '' . 
  it wasnt that well know and have fallen from public consiousness by 2012 that ck2 was released . 
  still waiting !, 
  i definetely support goupil de fol . 
  feels like you stepped in a different world . 
  it gets a bit clausterphobic sometimes though !, 
  you are using the english words and pronounciations , a language that appeared at least 600 years after christanity appeared . 
  as you claim the word drift happened in 1st century judea and you have to explain to me in greek , as most of early church books was written in it ( and it wasnt even ancient greek , but roman times koine ) . 
  so yeah gim me the change from \u0396\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 to \u0399\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 . 
  i am keeping an open mind here !, 
  that didnt answered what i asked . 
  your methodology might be solid . 
  please * demonstrate * it . 
  not that much that it would pose a problem to at the time , rather obscure swedish gaming company . 
  i am sorry but your lengthy arguments demonstrated a willingness to educate people . 
  i merely asked to explain a bit one single point of your thesis . 
  you did in english , these words are greek , so i merely ask for demonstration on the original language . 
  i felt the same . 
  then i realised they saved a badass looking character that was very underdeveloped in his original movie . 
  just using the word catholic centuries before the great schism indicates you need to study a bit more in theological matters . 
  you forgot the orthodox church , the copts , eastern rites catholics etc. 
  tgere is no single christianity for many , many centuries . 
  for someone that has so strong opinions about church history this a pretty basic thing not to know . 
  its like trying to comment about us politics and call * all * politians democrats or republicans . 
  there was never a time that religion wasnt politics . 
  also the whole `` church destroyed science !! '', 
  is waayy more complicated and exaggarated that `` pop science '' articles want you to believe . 
  i suggest to take a visit to the nice r/badhistory and read some of the best threads there . 
  you are using the english pronounciation again , it says so right there in the little brackets . 
  and its nots zeph its zeph * s * and again , not a proper word but a greek word translitarated in english by * me * for you to undersrand how it is pronounced in greek . 
  so still here waiting for you to explain to me h\u03bfw these two completely different sounding word * in their greek , proper form as the new testament was writen , * evolved . 
  also you do realise that when christianity appeared the greek gods were still widely venerated from peasants to nobles in everyday life ? 
  it wasnt an obscure religion that evolved to christianity . 
   zeph, 
  you do realize this is something ** i ** constructed to explain to you how the word is pronounced in greek , and has nothing to do with zephaniah , right ? 
  i could easily have written zaefs . 
  so you just found out the connection of a completely made up word . 
  zeus is pronounced quite differently in english than its original greek . 
  i gave you an example on how you pronounce it properly by making a made up word , zeph *** s *** ( you seem to ignore the * s * that is pretty integral to the greek word ) . 
  is this too difficult for you to understand it ? 
  also some thing that i forgot ask you . 
  how is the cross constellation has anything to do with the jesus cross when it was n't visible to the northern hemisphere for centuries before jesus , and even when it was visible it was part of the * centaurus * constellation ? 
  as a matter of fact it was `` re-discovered '' by european explorers 1400 + years after jesus , and possible named cross * because * of jesus , not the other way around as you claim . 
  that scene if it was in a more `` conventional '' anti-war novel it would have been praised as a literature masterpiece . 
  alas the fantasy ghetto is still strong . . 
  thankfully the law of averages applies and we are still here instead of racioactive slug . 
  yet . 
  i think the doubt rests on what things he truly said and what plato put in his mouth in plato 's documents . 
  you also forgot that mostly us students accumulate debts . 
  most medicine schools in other countries are free or cheaper while still being graded as excellent places to study . 
  and what do you know , those doctors agree with us doctors about vaccines !, 
  your roommate is indeed a heretic . 
  the thing is , due to your close proximity with him and your posted evidence that you have come in contact with heretic inscriptions , you are under suspicion of chaos corruption yourself . 
  please report to your closest inquisitor for appropriate rehabilitation . 
  yoy can definetely play the game without the dlc . 
  as a matter of fact , most of them are quite optional or some are outright useless except very specific cases/personal tastes ( rajas of india , sunset invasion etc ) . 
  qnd this is not a game you are going to spend 50 hours and done , you can easily rack up hundrends or even thousands of game time played . 
  i think a lot of people had enough time to piss themselves in theyr way down : /, 
  avocat means both the fruit and `` lawyer '' in french . 
  maybe it comes from that ? 
  they found a compromise and named boaty mcbotaface the min sub they are going to use . 
  it actually started its voyages these days , 
  also sir attenborough is pretty loved in uk and in europe in general so that also a reason . 
  considering that other , less prestigious online name competition usually ignore the joke results , that counts as a win . 
   she just talked and carried herself like she really had it all figured out , in middle school . 
  considering the vast amount of 20-30 year old hollywood recycles , that have this attitude after 1-2 hits , being a kid and behaving like that is understandable . 
  it fall on the parents to rein in , but it must be hard to rein in * their * pride . 
  most of them fail . 
  and thats reason i think children actors should be banned . 
  kick the kitty with your body spasms, 
  while she eats your brains . 
  it a bit of chicken and egg . 
  you need a huge investment built somthing to the moon and actually make `` profit '' , but this will open the door for other sources like the asteroid belt , that will further give us more recources to go further . 
  but the giant starting capital need is only possible right now with goverment spending . 
  if we manage to lower the costs of going to space thay feedback loop of precious stuff will fuel a faster colonisation of space , but we are not there yet :(, 
  i eould like to point out that the guy you responded had a point , even accidently . 
  its going to be way easier and cheaper to send robots to do all the job in the moon and belts . 
  our fixation on getting people there or mars instead of setting a purely financial venture based on robots i think hurt us in the long run,
