  it will fill like you waited for 10 years to find the last piece of a puzzle , and then finally you put it , it fits just perfectly , and the picture is complete . 
  nope.while there are laws about copyright n most countries , they are not the same and jurisdiction is a fuck up.i am a greek using chinese servers to sell british pirated games in australia.who is going to sue whom , where ? 
  i do n't understand what is regional pricing at all.is it a tax thing?but they are a us company so taxes should be the same for all.can someone explain it to me please ? 
  and that tactic was used first by guy from my town . . awesome !, 
  i think it is the first one by definition . 
  thank you . 
  while it seems reasonable at first , i think it is counterproductive because you can achieve the same if you simply lower the price.you can counter the `` loss '' by the bigger number of unit sales and you do n't piss your major market.it seems that instead of a company getting the hit for entering a new market , it completely passes it to her customers . 
  massive scale ? 
  or demos.fucking demos goddammit . 
  i was about to purchase [ space engineers ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/ ) based on screenshots . 
  i decided to try it out , but because i know what early access means , i torrented first . 
  yeah the game at that point was basically a tech demo at best , with no gameplay at all and with quite a few screenshots showing future updates.while the devs are quite enthusiastic and they have a implemented a lot of stuff since then , i was about to throw 20 $ in the wind.nah hah . 
  that sounds awesome . 
  so like , things that a lot of people went to jail for that , that most of the people not ( yet ) caught probably due to luck ? 
  the rockets used the basic principles of arrows , invented thousands of years ago.think about it . 
  i seriously thought i was reading an onion article ... 
  vincent gallo . 
  '' rabi jacob , how in gods name you confused the barzmel with * a viper ? 
  sauron , gandalf , saruman , ungoliant and the fucking balrog where maia , lesser divine spirits ( think angels and demons ) from tolkien mythology.so yeah that spider did n't get so big because it was a freak of nature .

  dude , if you do n't want people to ask about it then do n't mention it.you sound like a sit-com girl in pms :, 
  `` grrrmf '', 
  `` is there a problem honey ? '', 
  `` i do n't want to talk about it '', 
  `` you insensitive ** bastard ** ! you never care about my feelings ! '', 
  all of stephen king , tl ; dr :, 
  h. p. lovecraft with pop references . 
  shhh i mentioned sitcoms so the feminists do n't get me ^ it ^ happens ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ real ^ ^ ^ life ... 
   obviously this is jack boone , craig boone 's sixth * fabulous * great-grandfather . 
  why does he have ghoul arms ? 
   meanwhile primate intelligence has only been around 200k years and we are destroying ourselves and the environment . 
  you are overstating and overreacting.even if global warming goes full speed ahead we will hardly go extinct . 
  and even if we somehow do , the rest of the planets life will not give single fuck and carry on as usual.the major danger about global warming is about societal and economical disruption . 
   being reformed means that they are no longer pagans . 
  what?pagans are pagans . 
   preventing ` misunderstandings ' that could lock your ass away behind bars for decades . 
  you do realize that you are giving legal advise to real , breathing people that might actually ** deserve ** decades behind bars , right ? 
   even if they 're ` super-bad ' , do they deserver to get fucked by the prosecutor for longer sentencing that their other super-bad peers ? 
  umm . . serial rapists/murderers , abductors , child molesters ... 
  yes , yes they are . 
  well that escalated quickly.so a prosecutor going for maximum sentence , something that is right in his job description , is a representative system without , and i quote , `` without any ideas of freedom , liberty , and fairness '' . 
  shit in the u.s. you have to be over the top in every single `` potentially '' political discussion?you are not oppressed colonies anymore you know . . 
   as it 's forcing the state to do its job , which helps both you and me . 
  you are actively giving advice against the legal system so you are actually not helping me.nor you.unless you are a criminal that might dodge `` decades '' of jail . 
  i have.it is called the justice system and democracy.it is not my place , nor any other commentators to intervene so he can be edgy . 
  one . 
   advice, 
   \u0259d\u02c8v\u028c\u026as / submit, 
   ** guidance or recommendations offered with regard to prudent action ** . 
  advice , you , are giving it , . 
  two . 
  you are advising , on how to go against the prosecutor.ususualy a prosecutor vital part pof the legal system.hence your advice are against it . 
  three . 
  its , my . . punctuation i can do what i want with it . 
   i want to see how well the situation would go if that 's what a restaurant owner told a patron after the patron paid for dinner but the chef got too frustrated while cooking it ,, 
  . . and took the prepared dinner in the back alley , poured gasoline over it , burned it to ash all the while filming it and then went to the customer to show the video , all the while ranting about `` nobody owns my artistic soul '' . 
  it could literally turn my life around for half of that.or even 5k, 
  i will have to admit that , as you say , english is not my primary language.it is quite obvious . 
  but in my defense , my use of this barbaric and young language is quite extraordinary , especially if you consider , dear sir , that i have graduated a british university with outstanding grades . 
  on this , i would like to add that i achieved superb scores on the language examination that your country 's best universities require for attending . 
  so either my grasp of the language is adequate or your best `` universities '' have sub par requirments . 
  both choices would seem plausible but i believe the first one to be the true one . 
  but about the case of your commentary , i would like to state two things . 
  first , calling me out on my punctuation and secondly , attacking my personal image by calling me an ignorant fool , all the while denying any meaningfull input on our discussion , clearly shows a debating skill still in its infancy , why , i dare say even non existent . 
  so with further ado , i abandon our mutual aggression , since your level of understanding is quite obviously struggling , and proceed with my plans for this delightful evening . 
  you can inform your lady mother i will not be late . 
  most chefs are like that.i had a terrible choice for a career . 
  the best game ( ever ) you can make is a mmorpg with the europa universalis strategic/trade depth for the giant clans , mount and blade/total war for tactical warfare and all warped around in a eve online/star wars galaxies sandbox with a crusade kings/eve online douchbaggery and backstabbing on top.instant win . 
  it has the same chance 's of modern greece conquering the former greek colonies in france . 
   alexander the great , by contrast , is cited by machiavelli as a ruler who was able to successfully maintain dominion over lands far larger than france or england . 
  [ wat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/diadochi.png ), 
  this is my first real meeting with the aristocrats.bravo sir !, 
  pro tip : do n't jump in conclusions , especially if it is a slim chance to be snarky so you self congratulate your soul for being edgy.i was merely stating what the ultimate game for * me * would be . 
  and these pictures gentlemen , is a demonstration on why european soil is soaked in blood . 
  considering his stillborn empire destabilized the whole area of the former persian empire and it was followed by centuries of warfare between the diadochi , until they where so exhausted that a nascent republic from italy moped them up , i hardly consider them neat and tidy.shit i try to be supportive of alexander the great 's legacy , but i would ' t call his aftermath stable . 
  i was reading about nuclear warfare yesterday.i was practically drooling about the mod / expansion/fixes i would suggest or try to implement , and wondering how fucked up the beta would be and if it would be salvagable.i created my own personal hype train dammit !, 
   we did n't need to hear it . 
  it should wasted about 20 secs of your time to read my comment about a game i would love to see , especially after i was sorry to learn that another dream game of me was canceled after months of drama.do i deserve your aggression so much ? 
  there cant be western history without the persian empire as much it cant exist without athens . 
  the state is the people.if the state is fucked up , blame your citizens . 
  i am a novice with extremely limited time unfortunately : / because i would love to help.i have already tried to help with the euiv to vic converter and asked to join the elder mods but i have contributed zero because of that . 
  i know you where sarcastic , i was agreeing with your feelings.despite being greek and being fed since childhood that the persian where the `` bad '' guys , mostly because the majority of my nations enemies where coming from the same geographical area , anatolia ( persian/arabs/ottomans / modern turkey ) , i have come to realize that the persian where a pretty major influence in the west both in the ancient times and medieval after the islamic conquest . 
  what buggers me is that a lot of people nowadays are going all the way in the other side and try to paint alexander the great as a warmongering savage that attacked a peaceful empire . . 
  come on guys , thermopylae is pretty far from persepolis . 
  it could happen.it would take millions of years thu. 
  i am rooting for the white walkers to massacre everyone.i hate everyone equally . 
  right because after getting incest grabbed by her brother , lesbian foreplay with her servant and both wild doggy style and sensual sex with drogo , someone has to draw the line somewhere.i guess.might be . 
  it was all purgatory . 
  people who are still treasonous and power hungry in the he afterlife are forced on this world until they repent , or get eaten by white walkers aka demons . 
  that is why almost every character we have left alive is a douchebag , while guys that have transcended are `` killed '' aka go to paradise.famous example is the beheaded decent guy from season 1 and the other beheaded guy from season 3 . 
  both noble and generally good guy , got `` killed '' went to heaven . 
  in the final scene of the series , every character alive or dead , remembers the truth as they meet inside a temple of seven , and everyone happily hugs and laughs and then they meat hodor , who is astonishly revealed to be a spiti that will help them pass to the other life . 
  last time i checked totalitarian state done give a single fuck about no fifth or any trivial stuff like a constitution , they are going to get you no matter what.i think the us is far from that . 
  wear that suspension as a badge of honor my friend . 
   if you think our government pays attention to the constitution , you 've had your head up your ass all your life . 
  i have lived in country that its corruption brought it down on its knees and made it the laughingstock of the western world , and i know a lot of families that are under serious danger of loosing everything ( and i mean everything ) and i dare say even my country is leagues better than a lot of others in freedom and well being of the individual . 
  when i see citizens of western europe or the us crying me a river because they are oppressed i remember those spoiled girls from `` my sweet 16 '' who got a porsche instead of a ferrari . 
  `` boohoo the law took down my pirate website . '', 
  i am in my 30s so when is the `` growing up '' taking place?because apparently you missed it so i can reserve two seats . 
  yes !,
