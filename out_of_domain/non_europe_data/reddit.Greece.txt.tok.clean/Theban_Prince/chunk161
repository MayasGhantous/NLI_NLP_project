  but this is not the first time the us left a weak regime after they left only for it to collapse . 
  and from teh comments some people still think like that . 
  koreans will welcome the us will open arms `` becasue they know whos fault is '' . 
  are we sure about that ? 
  propaganda is tronk to accuse the us for any korean problem , and * some * people definetely will believe it . 
  and the us will not arrive with hopsitals and food trucks first , but bombs and teh abrams that gave everyone in the post a `` hardon '' . 
  even if yo are sympatheric you might get pissed when a guy from kentuky accidentally or not blows your kids to pieces . 
  also you know , the whole thing of toppling left leaning elected governments to prop up right wing dictators , spying in foreign leaders and citizens , * abducting * foreign citizens without due process in cia operations , and the pesky thing that they have a jail in foreign soil solely so they us constitution right do n't apply to its occupants , that of course , had been proved to get tortured .

  villains that are not caricatures get the viewer to emphasise with them and they feel they are the `` heroes '' sometimed simply because they are the protagonists . 
  breaking bad was ingenious precisly because it played with this , and it nice tp see at which point each viewer finally reached the conclusion that no , walter is indeed a horrible person . 
  r/buttcoin is actually full of that kind of stories . 
  all that grumpiness will morph into a black hole of snark !, 
  i have visited both amsterdam and prague and live in brussels , but i am an outsider in all of them . 
  yes they are both more `` beautyfull '' , but i they are also `` boring '' . 
  brussels is a wild ride , you take a walk and you dont know what you are going to find in the next corner , a early 20th century art deco building , maybe a hidden secondhand shop full of vintage curiocities , suddently a eu agency imposing glass giant , a 17th century home , a small park full of tropical parakeets , a proof of concept designer garden and ofcourse the different people and their lifestyle in each location ... its a fucking adventure . 
   which did n't even take place in iraq or syria, 
  the civil war in syria * [ is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war ) * the direct aftermath of arab spring clashes . 
  isis in syria though simply joined the chaos to carve their fief , but their roots are mostly from iraq insurgents and al-qaida splinter groups and the saddam [ army ] ( https://theintercept.com/2015/06/03/isis-forces-exbaathist-saddam-loyalists/ ) . 
  even big power would be fun , because they would have to tiptoe in teh edge on nuclear warfare that their actions could cause , while lesser powers would have either submit into one of the bloc for protection , or try to go the third word way and stay independent . 
  but i think to do it proper justice they need a full game , not a total conversion that evw essentially was . 
  this is actually theory of mine . 
  that the internet as a whole will achieve some kind of sentience simply by the thousands of data running around , each computer being a synapse . 
  i also think that the most probable result will be that it either will ignore us completely * or * subtly push us where it wants . 
  some media slightly changed , some photos inserted somewhere , rumors in imageboards , minor technical problems etc etc thousands of time per hour . 
  it could rule us without us realizing it . 
  no killer machines , no nukes , just slaves in a digital platos cave that we do n't realize exists . 
  are you guys still around ? 
  probably a dead spider . 
  dude i thought it meant that she despises him so much that she is never going to need him again . 
  so he was sad that he didnt do enough * for her * before she stopped calling him ( subconsiously ? ) . 
  that would be a good kick in the feelings . 
  considering empire has two sibling making out because lucas decided to make them so only in rotj despite empire being by design half of a story , while new hope was built in the assumtionnits going to be a one off movie , its not a stretch . 
  consudering how many / you left open , i think you should check your coding habits after all these years :p, 
  ahh thanks . 
  it would tie with the whole `` 10 years but you truly dont know me '' comment . 
  he knew all these time that he will get rejected so he kept it secret to keep helping her . 
  if not , its a huge secret to keep from someone you have dated , and you have seen her at her worst * multiple * times that the discussion about getting abused has become banal while cleaning her house . 
  does n't really make sense . 
  `` that boy is our last * hope * '', 
  `` no , there is another '', 
  another probable * jedi * , not child . 
  considering that they are changing plex into what is essentially a mobile game currency , i would suggest you shut up and stop giving them ideas . 
  the intention of ccp from the start have been to create a full on game world ( stated in multiple dev blogs ) . 
  if they had achieved their plans ( dreams ) by now we would walk/fight into stations and planets as seamesly as possible into one shared universe . 
  think star citizen before it even existed as an idea . 
  reality said otherwise . 
  i fail to see why they didnt do do already . 
  the mechanics of custom holograms exist already . 
  just avoid socratic . 
  its really difficult to have a proper bounty hunting system when your targets are immortal and can enter any building and be uncatchable . 
  copyright issue of what ? 
  they already found a way to add third party logos in game with tcus . 
  yeah i agree . 
  i can imagine the situation where you are in a grindy war and you are fitting for a cta while a huge bombastic ad of your * enemies * plays in the backround of your own * house * . 
  thats like , their logo and they can do what they want with it . 
  they are not going to put the logo on your house , but theirs . 
  if yiu hate it so much go burn it down :d . 
  also if they see it dozens of times everyday they might decide to get something better !, 
  finally icrossing has one of the best names and logos in the game . 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  instead of feeling like mighty space empire builders it feels like we build a prefab that it is leased from upwell . 
  they even have the rights to set up billboards with whatever ad * they * want , just like in rl . 
  it might have worked better if you just had linked that thread directly . . 
  what u/killraven post are extremely valuable advice . 
  however , dont believe the ccp hype that much , most players are decent dudes when you get to know them . 
  if you limit your exposure in getting scummed/ganged by the way it also makes you safer and others more trustworthy . 
  even a pretty legit dude might grab the chance to steal billions if dollars or gang a multibillion battleship if the gains are too great , but if not presented with the chance he might be the most trustworthy dude . 
  the best and most realistic eve trailer ever . 
  it involves a lot of map painting in the [ game world ] ( http://go-dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/verite/influence.png ) ( all these areas are what player `` guilds '' aka corporations/alliances own and fight over ) so i think you are going to love it here . 
  if you get into the game pm here with you character name to get you going  . 
  considering the similarities with the avignon papacy , this makes it a the kind of alternative timeline that you can imagine it could happen in real life . 
  the * best * kind . 
  good rp sir !, 
  bravo !, 
  [ yes ?!,

  oh you didnt tell me something i didnt know already . 
  since the fuckups with aurum back in 2011 and `` greed is good '' ccp havent really changed their policy of adding more and more rmt in the game despite what people thought so . 
  if you go higher up you will a comment of mine that the new plex is essentially a mobile game premium currency copy pasted in eve . 
  i still dont mind if it is an rmted ability , as long as it * is * possible . 
  because ccp has the tendency to copy paste industry concepts and then abandoning them half done . 
  yep . 
  submit a link of a thread aka xpost . 
  remember that it needs np ( no participation ) in the url though to avoid brigading or its going to be automatically deleted . 
  its not the same . 
   this makes me feel dirty in a way i do n't want to feel dirty . 
  the best way of dirty . 
  modules are not locked to citadel type . 
  but they give bonuses . 
  so its better to have manufacturing modules in mafufacturing citadels . 
  nothing stops you using them in an astrahus though . 
  fitting limits ( like module slots ) exist , but those existed in poses too . 
  and even better services like insurance personal inventory etc are built-in so no storage limited building needed like poses . . 
  not i am saying that if you cover your ass most people not only will * not * even try to scum you , but even give you support , material or otherwise . 
  however even the best players will take a chance if its juicy ( like in real life , if a bank vault was forgotten completely open without cameras , a lot of decent people would steal ) . 
  tl : dr unless you present a very juicy ( and idiot ) target , most people will not bother you or even help you . 
  this for ships . 
  they problem they have is that skins can cause problems due to complexity and numbers . 
  its the same reason they dont allow all ships to have all skins as it was briefly possible due to bug .
