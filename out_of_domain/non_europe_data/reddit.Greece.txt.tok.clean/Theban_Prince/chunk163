  you mean a civilization capable of casual interstellar travel using city size ships ? 
  just because space travel is prohibitively expensive * now * it does n't mean its going to be like that forever . 
  makes even more sense in scifi settings , where alternative power sources and such are assumed or outright stated . 
  essentially you are comparing [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/rosalespangasinanjf877.jpg/1280px-rosalespangasinanjf877.jpg ) to [ this . 
  ] ( http://faecdn.azureedge.net/d/bex/i/oasis-of-the-seas.jpg ), 
  remember people , `` hard '' scifi doent mean bulky spacesuits and apollo-like 3 man spaceships 500 years into the future . 
  its equally unrealistic . 
   if you ca n't blockade every ship then it 's not going to be a great method of stopping , say , an important political figure from leaving a planet, 
  persons of interest ( and locations of interest like capitals ) would probably be under lock down and have multiple eyes on them from the sky . 
  you could run the chances of getting your head of state on a defenseless ship and run the risk of getting past , but if you get detected , something highly possible as stated , you would get shot down , game over , war has ended . 
  would you run the president of the us past a soviet military blockade on a yacht for example ? 
   a navy blockade very much blocked all ships so the comparison should be similar . 
  there is a reason we had ship called [ blockade runners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockade_runner ) . 
  the purpose of a blockade is to restrict or cut out * trade * on a massive scale to the target port or country , not to stop every single ships per se a state leader from escaping ( that would way too much high risk ), 
  we breath each others farts daily . 
  what the hell ? 
  why did my blue sweater turned red ? 
  huh i found the expanse on of the most probable , at least concerning space travel and time frame . 
  what irked you specifically ? 
  do give a more basic reply to what u / - revenant - explained , its essentially the water rushing in to fill up the `` vacuum '' left by the explosion . 
  as the tons of water crash into each other they `` explode upwards '' . 
  its the same principle that cause the small `` peaks '' when a water [ drop hit the surface ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2msyxjwdu ) , the splashback when you poop or the peaks at the [ center ] ( http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/38/1/91/f1.large.jpg ) of [ meteor impact craters !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/lro_wac_tycho_crater_mosaic.jpg/250px-lro_wac_tycho_crater_mosaic.jpg ) . 
  why would you * expect * that kind of civilizations ? 
  and why they would be the focus of the story ? 
  and can you explain what hydrostatic head is ? 
  i would like you to give ephasis on words like * pressure * . 
  and maybe afterwards read what a `` simplified answer '' is . 
  what `` rule '' enforces civs at `` level d '' to coexist with `` level as '' . 
  and for them to be so common that unless they are represented in screen or page its not realistic . 
  i mean , even in earth there are locations with various technological differences , but you dont see amish people in spy novels . 
  finally `` technology levels a -  b -  c '' etc sounds awefully video gamey and propably have no relation with real life . 
  civilizations and cultures are fluid things . 
  you can have `` advanced tech '' in certain parts of life while not in others . 
  those materials could come from dragons that they where `` put down `` due to excessive aggressiveness , sickness , or being in a place where they cant get transported safely to a `` reserve '' and they present a danger to muggles and/or wizards . 
  this also happens in real life with endangered species . 
  a single dead dragon would probably give enough material for dozens of wands and gloves . 
  surely expensive , but not unique . 
  this s even more cringe than the original video . 
  the people just standing there , some of them trying too hard to dance , the too much empty space for this kind of situation , the pink lady all this under music levels needed for thousands of spectators but they are like . . a dozen . . 
  you are giving a very detail answer for no reason . 
  essentially you are explaining what forces and how they propagate in an eggshell 's surface that causes it to crack when someone simply asked `` why did the egg broke when it fell '' . 
  `` because it hit the floor with enough speed '' is a sufficient answer ( this is nor r/science ) unless someone asks for further details . 
  you can do what you want . 
  i am also free to call you haughty . 
  that sound extremely dangerous . 
  if for any reason you vomit or poop a half digested troll piece you are spreading trolls everywhere . 
   one of the most chill spiders i have ever seen, 
  are you sure your widow didnt get a hold of any dub you left unattended ? 
  i mean this might be your spider when you are n't [ looking ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcru333aix47m9s2uvy4_kchbste4erpj7wu_dkz0we08lkl7ksnjq ) . 
   after the first world war germany got fucked over by surrounding european powers and they were desperate for revenge and to stop being trampled on . 
  while you description does have kernels of truth , the solution to that is not to torch three continents to solves this . 
  hitler could stop before poland with pretty much most of pre-ww1 territories back ( or even more ! ) . 
  he did n't . 
  radioactivity in sufficient amounts can be catastrophic for living organisms . 
  but we get bombarded by radioactivity from the sun and earth around us every single second of our existance . 
  how much and how fast you receive something toxic plays a great role on the effects . 
   the government wo n't suddenly declare war on the people , it 's all done softly softly , slowly taking away civil liberties . 
  the people that have the guns most probably will cheer on the government if it does that . 
  because they have been led to a tunnel vision that `` freedom '' means been allowed to have a rifle but not the right access to basic goods like clean water and food , protection for work exploitation , affordable education etc. 
  they are allowed to keep their toys thinking they hold power over government , when in reality an armed populace have n't been a danger since early 20th century at best . 
  tanks and airplanes are gon na fuck you up . 
  you see , people think that if health care costs are taken out the companies will give you that 600 $ to * you * since they wont be giving them to the government anymore ... which does n't make any sense . 
  even [ better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9bvnnmdpta ) video with scenes from the inside of the boat . 
  logos in citadels !, 
  it shows both corp and alliance logos, 
  i vote for corp ceos also . 
  remember that a lot of alliances are using placeholder toons . 
  and what about renter alliances ? 
  or corps not in an alliance like the vast majority of highsec corps ? 
  its not dumber than `` 90s kids learned to be x from : '' and then a list of weekend cartoon like transformers , thundercats etc which were glorified toy commercials . 
  still gringy as hell , but nothing uncommon , just for a different generation . 
  nostalgia is weird . 
  bethesda games areaster of creating an open world . 
  tjey are beautyfull , full of nooks and cranies to explore , great set pieces . 
  they codified the modern open world style and skyrim was the high point of their games . 
  but about storyline and gameplay , they leave much to be desired . . 
  actually , if the game doesnt live up to his name , it will probably deflate pretty fast and most people will try to forget the jokes and hype because they would feel so gringey . 
  its what happened with duke nukem . 
  why simulate all the tech advances , the expanding city , political changes etc when you can keep them stuck at the same time ? 
  noone realizes the time doest pass if the machines wish so , so no reason to do it like that . 
  that the first picture about the `` internet '' has no specific difference that other posts we have around here . 
  the death star is to lightsabers what sidewinder missiles are to icbms . 
  they are pretty much the same , ina bigger scale . 
  i imagine matrix control for humans to be a mix of 1984 , dark city and truman show . 
  subtly influence your moves and life via the ways you described , and if you start going against the script or start noticing things they directly influence your brain and memories . 
  i like also the fan canon that zion and the real world are actually another layer of the matrix so anticomfortists have a place to go that agrees with their psyche . 
  there is no escape . 
  executive producers : will wright , john romero and george broussard . 
  unless there are no bodies at all and they are simply uploaded in simulations for whatever reason . . 
  from where do they know they have been used as an energy source ? 
  i do n't see any libraries around the destroyed world . 
  and the survivors of each zion are led by an one that we * know * is not sharing everything . 
  he really sucks as a `` historian '' doesnt he ? 
   i bought plex, 
  sure . 
  a literal god would think the federation into non existance , and he could delete ir from history as well . 
  i f we kill enough people , maybe a charismatic underground leader will rise , and send a reprogrammed machine back to the past to stop it all before it even starts . 
  they should add two tiers of ae i think . 
  one the most common which influences countries in a local area ( and assumes proximity as you said ) , and one for great powers .
