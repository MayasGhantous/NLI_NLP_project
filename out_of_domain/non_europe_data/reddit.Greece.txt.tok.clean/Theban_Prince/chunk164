  because france might not care that congo invaded mali , but should care if uk does it . 
  you have never been to null have you ? 
   long long ago , ccp did say that they had new tools and they were going to produce much more pve content and missions esp epic arc type missions . 
  a long time ago i posted in the suggestions subforum about having more easily accessible depository of lore , more chronicles , etc. 
  two ccp employees , ccp zymurgist and ccp dropbear actually responded pretty fast and told me that they where building something called `` lore portal '' . 
  however nothign came of it and after a while i got disappointed and assumed it was vaporware . 
  this happened in 2011 . 
  [ six days ago they released it ] ( http://fiction.eveonline.com/ ) . 
  it has been 6 years . 
  ccp works as icelanders do . 
  at a glacial pace . 
  this directly adressed in the books . 
  nazgul without their cloaks cause their dread to spread in a large area , and while they are searching for the ring in the shire they are `` undercover '' behind enemy lines , because they dont want to attract attention from the good powers like the elves , when their dark lords power is currently far south into mordor . 
  they are also limited on how much they can interact in the living world without their bodies/cloaks ( mentioned after they lose them after they got trashed by the waters of riverdell and that it will take time to get new ones as well as steeds ) since they are well , shadows . 
  she got dropped by some ad agencies . 
  i think he was a saruman spy ? 
  it has been recently proven that germany had no hope of destroying the raf during the battle of britain . 
  the british would have moved their airfields further north at some point , making them very difficult to reach for fighters while still mainting channel coverage . 
  also they wanted to invade using river barges . 
  somewhat a funny thing , not ecen the british themselves knew about how better the situation was due to lack of intelligence . 
  it was found out by post war research . 
  the walls would have last quite well . 
  the problem was thaat the city was vastly undermanned and completely encircled with no hope of anyone coming for the rescue . 
  bombards only hastened the inevitable . 
  nah the british actually got better numbers as the fight went on . 
  i do n't have a book to suggest at hand , but you can find research and articles such as [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/battle-of-britain/11866425/its-time-to-shatter-the-myths-of-the-battle-of-britain.html ) and [ this ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2050538,00.html ) very easily . 
  they could easily implement this by unlocking all t1 modules and ships ( not faction ) . 
  skills still exist , to give the bonuses . 
  you can try all ships but to be good you would still need to train and to unlock the t2 ( make faction lvl 4 skill requirments ? 
  a basic thing to understand for meeting up between two ships is that they use some very basic principles as the old western bandits that tried to catch up a train with their horse during a hesit . 
  you need to launch at a proper time ( for fuel reasons ) , set up an orbit that intersects the targets as much as possible , and when you reach the closest possible point ( less than 10km i think is good ) you either break or accelerate until your relative velocities are 0 . they you slowly burn towards ( small and short burns ) . 
  yes about 1/6 of the planet or so . 
  since that means you sometime will be `` ahead '' or `` behind '' it , you need to make the orbit a bit more elliptical ( raise your ap a bit for example * after * you have circulised your orbit . ) . 
  du to how things work , when you reach your raised ap you will actually `` lag '' a bit behind the target and after a while you are going to synchronize ( might want to go into higher time speed until that happens ) and the two ships will have a point where they are close together . 
  thats the point you `` break '' or `` burn '' to get relative ) speed ), 
  the mentality you describe is human nature . 
  is why we went from hamlets in the mesopotamia to present day ney york . 
  yup . 
  back in the day dreads had drone bays if i remember correctly . 
  they * could * kill subcaps . 
  sound as a goon prime candidate . . 
  you should check how they used forced percpective to make hobbits look shorter than the others !, 
  the city would lprobably have fallen due to denethors madness though . 
  yeah but i do n't think much would have been left with thousands of rampaging orcs inside the city . 
  he might got the buildings back somewhat standing , but nothing else . 
  and he cant use the army of the dead anymore !, 
  i go to la chasse , to the one right opposite the ing [ there ] ( https://www.google.be/maps/search/50.830093,+4.390167?sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjf59wr0p3tahuj0hokhvggcaaq8geijdaa ) . 
  15 euros , they speak ( somewhat ) decent english , fast and they can cover most needs . 
  considering i absolutely hate cutting my hair , that i prefer to go there is not random . 
  its both reasons . 
  well , in the us at least.rest of the world is mostly a bit more sane . 
  edit : i am just stating the facts . 
  getting fired because of a bumper sticker or writing in a newspaper would absolutely wreck the company at * least * from the unions . 
  sabering is not cutting though . . 
  if they ever make `` modern '' game it will probably be 1945-1991 . 
  i think the mai problem is that they aee going to portray historical events tgat are `` fresh '' and can cause controversy . 
  israel , civil rights , mcarthism etc. 
  and they cant sidestep it by focusing on the military aspects like they did in hoi because internal political conflicts are the `` meat '' of the cold war . 
  the euro has major issues . 
  its just worse in greece because the books where cooked . 
  but that only made it worse . 
  considering all options , getting nuked is some of the best ways to go . 
  i think your brain doest even have the time to register what is happening . 
  i hate using quotes , but the guy was on point in this case :, 
  ` the nuclear arms race is like two sworn enemies standing waist deep in gasoline , one with three matches , the other with five . ', 
  carl sagan . 
  thats why i said `` getting nuked '', 
  i mean it does n't look like a sucking , it * is * sucking because well , the vast instances of sucking happen when a void fills up with something . . 
  it still stand for you also though , 
  its the shadow of her own leg . 
  you can see the darkened outline of the rest of the leg on the link * you * posted . 
  the same shadows that exist under her chin . 
   but that 's ok , that 's the glory of opinions right ? 
  opinions do n't work that way really . . its either something or its not . 
  its not photoshop , but definitely oversight from the photographer and the guy responsible for the lighting . 
  as a completely new player that played wow for the first time this year that was one of my dissapointments when leveling . 
  also how easy is to outevel areas . 
  never reached 110 because by the time i got to outland i was bored and only did the areas for the lore ( which is all over the place ) . i also missed the swtors single player mode for dungeons if you want to follow the story and dont care about the gear . 
  xenomorphs without a queen are known to turn into one . . 
  a lot of commenters here seem to ignore that individual aliens are smarter than animals and with a queen they reach human levels of tactics and probably some strategic planning ( seen by ambushes planned and executed in alien 2 ) . 
  an alien queen would probably lay low and spread it numbers before going into full on war and the you are fucked . 
  wast there a guy the got himself caught and transported in a concentration camp and escaped to get info about whats happening , * twice ? 
  the best analogy of the dark side i heve read was the comparison with cancer cells . 
  they are technically part of the body , but they are a detrimental `` mutation '' and will ultimately destroy both the body and them if they run unchecked . 
  life of brian is not an inappropiate christian movie . 
  quite the opposite . 
  i am missing chunks of the story though . 
  all these are good and solid . . for conventional army engagement . 
  alien infestations will be a mix of being in the middle of nowhere and the most populous cities . 
  for the first , even with present day intelligence system we cant scan the entire planet ( and remember they can use any big mammal to swell their numbers , so they can bee hidden until have enough numbers to fuck you up ) and for the second case you cant use your best weapons because you will kill as many civilians as the aliens , or more ( at least in one swoop ) . 
  just take the problem modern armies had with asymmetrical warfare in afghanistan , iraq , vietnam etc , only make it infinitely worse because the enemy has no need for rnr , no ideological or combat training and almost no need for resupply . 
  and they will always hit you in the civilian population that supports your economy and industry , part of which supports your high tech army . 
  oh and if you successfully eliminate a nest , i hope you got every single alien , because if even one escapes you have to do it all over again in a few weeks . 
  using what you say might be possible to save a part of humanity inside fortresses , but those will be constant targets that one slip up can doom them , and human civilization as we know it is over . 
  how you are going to feed billions when the farmlands are alien hunting grounds ? 
  are you going to set every single farmer with an explosive vest ? 
  depends on what you want to do . 
  for nature walks , maybe [ bois de la cambre .
