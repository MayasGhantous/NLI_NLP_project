  camera dude was pretty close . 
  if it goes long enough and generates a lot of buzz it can escalate as more people join in for the `` good fights '' and then everyone piles up . 
  the pcg article might do the trick . 
  pl has annoyed a lot of your neigbors down south these past weeks though . 
  if ( big if ) they show up , they have left over business with other like with goons and co. 
  i am not saying its probable but things have escalated for sillier reasons . 
  isnt this the justification of everyone that takes walfare ? 
  this video is a good example for when i see insane , absurd stories here in reddit . 
  i always reserve myself that they * might * be true . 
  i mean describe that video in a reddit comment , like if you were the flight inspector , and tell me if it is remotely believable , especially that a ) the other person not noticing a cat holding for dear life right next to her head and b ) that the cat held up and survived all the way to the landing . 
  the world is so huge and there as so many people , everything that does n't include outright fantastic elements ( like ghosts or aliens ) is bound to happen . 
  possibly more than once . 
  i personally hate when succesfull in their first book scifi authors proceed to drop huge filibusters in the later book espousing weird philosophies/politics . 
  o. s. card is also very guilty of this . 
  oh card did n't insert his religious beliefs , but it was full of pages where he described weird political theories and such , especially int eh bean books . 
  something about the `` outer '' countries that conquer the `` inner '' countries in cycles and such nonsense for pages and pages . 
  my translation might not be on point because the book was n't in english . 
  podding in that case seems counterproductive . 
  why there a bunch of plays about the same shakespeare stories ? 
  or numerous films/plays/books about heroes like robin hood , sherlock holmes etc. 
  heck this was trend since the ancient times , where ancient greek writers would rehash the same tragedies/comedies again and again , sometimes every year . 
  because the basic premise is always interesting and speaks to a broad audience , and each creator want to put its own spin on the story that is more easily noticeable when the basic plot is already familiar to the audience . 
  escobar is becoming more and more a fictional hero . 
  and something else that exists since ancient times . 
  money and fame . 
  if something sells others will try to copy it . 
  others have already created the `` brand '' for you instead of having to start from scratch . 
  or being just big for just 0.30 sec of fuel . 
  more importantly , how grandpa brought it in teh states ? 
  hid it in his goddamn rucksack ? 
  he is not allowed to fight their wars for them with his full power , doesnt mean he cant intervene directly at a personal level . 
  he is somewhat like a military advisor to a third party . 
  both times he get delayed by actions outside his control . 
  first by saruman , then by being you know , dead in top of a peak , and then by theoden exiling eomer and his army so he has to find them and bring them back . 
  considering this , he arrived perfectly on time !, 
  chances are pretty low for that if they are even minimaly competent . 
  most probable is you just teleported them on top of their new pvp ship . 
  get out with you truth and analusis !, 
  we want analyses that read like stoner 's `` whoa '' philosophical mumblings that turn two real human populations into caricatures !, 
  the economy was doing much much better before the eu and especially the euro . 
  greece would have to join at some point , but it would be better than a lot of east european countries . 
   both parties are at fault . 
  shhhh !, 
  if people realise that we might actually solve the euro problems . 
   ( even idiotic members like greece ), 
  is this whats like that you have swallowed so much propaganda that you refer a group of million of people in the singular ? 
  france aint fairing exactly well itself actually . 
   ireland for instance was far poorer than any other european country in the 70 's , had a looming conflict until the 90 's , but has a solid economy and recovered quite well from the crisis . 
  by using laws that turn it to a tax heaven for big conglomerates while being detrimental fro the rest of europe , and destroying a lot of the social net for short time gain . 
  and completely ignoring that each country has different structural reasons for experiencing a crisis . 
   there was no transparency , it took eu auditors months to discover they were undereporting their deficit by a factor of 3 . 
  because eurostat was barred from directly investigating states financial statements , and they had to take the local agencies statements at face value . 
  this has been the case because * most * of the eu countries , including ireland and the netherlands barred it from doing so in the early 2000s because , reasons . 
  this is one of the main causes of the euro debt crisis , but you know , its all that lazy greeks fault . 
  that 's a more level headed response . 
  i agree with what you say . 
  it mifes me though when ireland does n't get any flak from mainland europe , because it is used as the `` austerity works ! '', 
  posterity child for short term political gain , when it is using detrimental practices and outright skirting eu rules ( which you , know , its what greece did ) . 
  and i do n't think is * that * financially stable , its still a tiny country compared . 
  early 80s , her gdp was almost double portugal and on par with finland and norway ones . 
  compared to , say germany and us was nothing , but for size ( and history ) it was doing quite well . 
  ahh so this is not a union of equal then . 
  thanks for clearing ti up . 
   by the way , the glove has a latex glove, 
  well that was obvious , no one got hurt for a funny video !, 
   with ** blood ** inside it , ** i ** did n't bleed for this video, 
  after the 100 launch it gets seriously tedious . . 
  its a single player sandbox game . 
  its part of the appeal . 
  he should call out players that use mods as well . 
  i think we were talking about serious people . 
  my bad . 
  if you are not planning to do pvp in a null corp your app will be rejected . 
  if you dont tell them then eventuall your lack of participation will be noted and you will booted . 
  what corp woul accept someone who wants to mine in their space so he can go solo/npsi pvp ? 
  europe ? 
  fixed ? 
  have you seen the stats ? 
  10 later and if the economy slows doqn even a bit we are all diwn the drain . 
  indeed . 
  but compared to germany , a more appropiate comparison , it is lagging . 
  that i agree . 
  seriously the us system is shit . 
  i would be what you considered liberal , and probably voted fo clinton out of neccesity , but holy hell that would put me at the same party as a bunch of different political views , from climate regulation to gun control supporters to hippies to extreme feminists to . . you catch my drift . 
  you'all need a multi-party system !, 
  uhh believing into extremist mumbo jumbo is `` a little smarter '' ? . 
  how low is the bar and do you need a shovel to find it ? 
  oh please then just stop paying !, 
  like , really !, 
  so everything come crashing down and we all can go our own seperate ways . 
  its not panaceia , but it makes thing better . 
  and with coalition third parties can influence or outright participate in the goverment without getting lumped with the big guys and lose their identity . 
  well we do n't want to be trade partners and possibly federal partners that paint entire nations as `` lazy backstabbing thieves '' . 
  i mean , * you * will stop paying and * we * will finally disengage our fiscal policy from having to appease 25 ministers that have no personal investment in this case . 
  everyone is happy , including you !, 
  i have no primblem with those , but i just wanted to point out that as republicans , democrats also are a gragantuan conglomarate of various factions . 
  someone who wants mire social protection might not be ok with furthering lgbt rights . 
  or the opposite . 
  but they need to find only 1 candidate that appeals to everyone , and most importantly has the $ $ to get natiowide coverage , because if he fails he is done for , there is no need to go for anything less than getting all the electors needed . 
  this is also why trump won , the middle right got lumped with the far right because there is no option .
