  in a parliement system trump would probably have 10 % or less . 
  as other `` weird '' parties have . 
  thank god !, 
  this looks like a generic scifi . 
  the woomp sounds , the cuts , the one lubers . 
  man this is going to suck . 
  northern lights/golden compass has appeared as a contenter . 
  etterbeek and ixelles are generally good neighborhoods with lots of students due to the proximity with ulb and vub . 
  flagey attracts lots of internationals . 
  connections to the center are not optimal , but definetely better than leuven . 
  see if taking the train from local stations ( merode , gare etterbeek etc ) cover you . 
  you talk like these guys had a choice on what to believe , when in all probability they have been conditioned sing babies by their parents , family , church and community . 
  for someone to agree with you they must admit that pretty much everyone they hold dear is either ignorant and/or a liar . 
  we need to understand that this is not about personal beliefs , but cult like organisations for monetary and political control . 
  these dudes need deprograming , not friendly debate . 
  these guys are not going to go away because this mindset and beliefs are propagated specifically for political gain . 
  its the oldest trick in the book , take a group , isolate them and tell them they are under attack and only i can save them * if * you vote for me . 
  people do n't realize that we expect this guys not to say '' huh , you are right , carbon dating is accurate so that means earth must be millions of years old '' but '' huh , you are right , carbon dating is accurate so that means i have been a sucker for all my life '' . 
  it aint happening over a coffee at the break room . 
  oh it can definitely happen . 
  but i was thinking about a case of a third party like a coworker ( like op ) or acquaintance or hell , a spokesperson in tv like richard dawkins trying to switch your opinions . 
  afaik these kinds of organization have the inoculation of their members against the practices , their bread and butter . 
  luke got into a military fighter , the equivelent of a modern f22 , fought into a full on battle versus highly trained veterans , bigger numbers , a moon base and one of the two sith in the galaxy who is a naturally talented pilot himself * and * trained and manages to do the impossible `` because the force '' , and everyone is fine . 
  already experienced melee fighter barely defeats an injured , tired , and emotionally vulnerable dark side * student * and because she is a gurl , * everyone loses their * minds **, 
  flying in a civilian aircraft is not the same as flying a military aircraft , for the first time , in a combat situation against overwhelming odds . 
  and not forget that anakin blew up an entire command ship by accident when he was a child !, 
  the force is a huge multiplier that is accepted as such , unless you are a girl apparently . 
  because in this case we are not discussing the bad writing of star wars ( there is aplenty in all movies , old or new ) but how people got fixated with the force awakens concerning rey who is `` unrealistically good in everything because hollywood is pushing for superstrong womyn '' when such characters are endemic in all star wars lore without people arguing about their sex . 
  he is not even droving off . 
  he has obviously slowed down after realizing what happened and looking to park . 
  heh for me there is no other way playing . 
  for example when you accidenty disband your pretty expensive mercenaries or after a war that is at 90 % occupation but its cancelled because some nobody with a claim died or a pagan turned christian at the last minute or to change from relublic to feudal etc etc etc. 
  a fixed the formatting , tl : dr might not be entirely possible i am afraid . 
  i will try though . 
  ** some of the pros of this system : **, 
  ** unchartered status : ** it allows new players to be part of a corp structure instead of staying in npc corps without any drawback for doing so ( constant wardeccs ) but neither bonuses ( they are mechanically still in a npc corp due to locked tax rate and inability to place structures ) . 
  creating social units make it easier for them to stick in the game , and probably make the jump to chartered status at some point . 
  ** chartered status : ** it cleans up the corp landscape considerably . 
  no more 1 person tax heavens where they can hop on to another ( unless they want to pay for charters every time ) bloating the system . 
  players will have a quite easier time to find active corps based on content , since hq location and charter status will be searchable when looking for corps ( example , looking for highsec corp in caldari , short search results in corporation finder as '' chartered corps with hq in caldari space '' . 
  wormhole corp can have their location listed simply as `` unknown space '' . 
  it actually follow the eve mantra `` the more risk , the more the gains '' by increasing industry/pve payouts . 
  ** wars : **, 
  it stops boredom tactics in highsec wars such as permadocking , corp hopping , and wardeccing while getting your income from somewhere else using alts . 
  unless a party can be in the field consistently , the other one can farm simply plexes at will and actually make a profit , while the aggressor will have to keep up with lp because they are need to cover its lp loses of the week and the increased cost per week to maintain the wardec . 
  however since upgrade levels drop due to time / or looting and war costs increase over time , a wardeccer will hit a point where pure lp gains will not cover the cost , forcing them to stop the war ( unless there is another reason of course , like citadel bashing or just because they hate their guts ) . 
  a defending corp. has the option to go out and fight to defend their plexes , do mission to maintain lp upgrades but they can also raid the attackers areas to drop the war decc `` pot '' to 0 and actually finish the war . 
  ** nullsec/lowsec corps : ** those corps should not get affected that much by these changes , except where chartered status is in effect . 
  since that is based an item that can be moved and can only be pillaged by wardec , they only need to dock into an alliance citadel , rent some offices and place the charter there . 
  added a tl ; dr as well . 
  i dont know if it is representative enough though . 
  the lp gained from killing npcs and finishing plex are not created from scratch , but drained from the corps local hq upgrades . 
  so no gain from that . 
  if you are successful you can severely hinder a corps operations in a region by dropping their bonuses in citadel fuel costs , broker fees , bounty , mission payouts etc while making a buck in the lp store . 
  also there is the possibility of the corp that got his npcs killed losing standings with npc corps and faction for failing to protect . 
  well if you do that , you will lose all bonuses you have accumulated in your hqs , you will lose your charter and respective costs ( and all these can now be farmed by your wardeccers with impunity , so they gain something even if you run ) , and you will get into a new corp that has the same mission and bounty payout as well as brokers fees as an * npc corp * , and those will be even * worse * than they are now . 
  success ? 
  did you know that the present citadel iteration and the present bounty systems are based on a player suggestions such as this ? 
  they will have to or defenders will farm their hqs all the way to annulling the war and getting immunity for 2 months . 
  did you even bother to read it ? 
  these changes also effect that . 
  gone are the 1 man corp incursions corps with 0 % tax . 
  gone are the alt mission runners with 0 % corp as well . 
  gone are the industrialists without any risk . 
  either they will need to get their asses on the line or they will need to get stuck with horrible brokers fees , refining costs , mission and bounty payments and huge taxes ( * locked * into 20-30 % ) . 
  still a possible game style , but the gains are similar with the risk . 
  this will require the present war code to be replaced * obviously * . 
  since you also did n't read just stop responding so you do n't waste your time . 
  uhmm ... this is what i described basically with some added features for war between corps without no structures ? 
  plus nerfing/stopping going corp hopping and permadockign unless you can definitely win ? . 
  i mean what stops corps wardecing someone but not engaging the structures and just farm kills every week ? 
  or what stops someone from simply not having structures be * immune * to wardecs entirely while getting most of the bonuses being in corp ( 0 % taxes , lower refining , better faction standigns etc ) ? 
  this is no more complicated than what already exists in null by the way considering ihub and adms . 
  its not more complicate than what nullsec has right now . 
  it also effects structure placement in highsec and give mining bonuses to miners and marketeers.it also gives incentives to declare war since you can `` steal '' lp and buy lp items to turn into isk . 
  this implements a scale where the more you increase your risk ( putting more lp into local upgrades ) increases your gains ( more income form missions/mining/market ) while lowers the income for those that do n't take risks . 
  it also makes wardeccing viable as primary income , since you can try to farm your targets for lps . 
  * on the other side if you are a shitty wardeccer , you can get farmed in return by your target until they nullify the war * . 
   i 'm telling you its overly complex and dumb . 
  because you have the attention span of a lemming and admitted to not even reading it ? 
  this is addressed in two points : big corps are simply not worth engaging small corps , because the lp farmed scales based on upgrades and increasing the cost of the war every week , so at some point they will have to stop and switch to others target because they will not breaking even . 
  hell not only that , but draining the other corp to zero only leave you vulnerable past a certain point , because you will still have `` plexes '' in he field they can loot at all times , that will give them some payback and increase your costs per week ( you need to cover the war pot losses you have sustained ) while they are pretty immune . 
  unless you have a specific reason to target a corp , after a certain point it will be more profitable to declare peace ( and give them 2 months of enforced peace of mind ) than keep going . 
  the thing that this system allows to get something scalable out of it , create somewhat of a `` ladder '' where small , newbie corps that barely have over lvl2 in their upgrades are simply not worth the risk , while huge corps/alliances with lvl5s , multiple hqs and citadels everywhere are big juicy targets that rack up a shit on of isk from highsec content , but they run the risk of getting wardecced to death if not having a combat wing . 
  not steal , but when you install a charter you get a basic pot of lp ( the amount you need to get a charter in the first place ) . 
  they cant steal it , but they can drain the lp if a ) they have an hq in the same region your main hq with your charter is and they have fueled it with lp for war and b ) they have drained everything from every other location and hq . 
  after that happens , yes it is probable to revert your corp to uncharted status * after * it has been completely zero for some time . 
  however that will require a lot of investment to happen , considering they will will need to fill their own hqs with lp and the increasing war costs and you can still back lps . 
  the point of this is to force * both * sides of a war to the field , so yeah you will need to defend it from * very * dedicated aggressor if you are a high sec chartered corp. . you are supposed to get big bucks out of it anyways . 
  first of all thanks for the constructive opinion . 
  as for the increased taxes , its not that they are punitive , but so it can balance the new system a bit . 
  the upgrades you add should increase you income by a huge margins past a certain upgrade level to make this worthwhile ( especially for higher skilled players ) , they should actually be * more * profitable than now so these isk faucets should be balanced by isk drains . 
  30 % might have been to much ( it was added mostly to show that uncharted corps are not `` wardecc immune free isk printing machines '' ) but something around the range of 10-20 % should be unreasoble . 
  also in parallel dimension ccp implements this i expect them to have more hard data than what i have to balance it out . 
  the same people you lost with faction warfare ? 
  wormholes ? 
  citadels ? 
  fozzie warfare ? 
  ability to join a defensive war in hig sec ? 
  this argument have been always the same in any proposed change , and it was always irrelevant .
