  the guy took time to answer me about the arthropods i have in my bathroom.i repeat , a scientist with full credentials and science awesomeness took time from his schedule to answer me about my bathroom bugs . 
  ** that ** is why unidan is awesome . 
  we need replays !, 
  i am familiar with this.however my greatest science was when i used a toy microscope to see my boogie in 100x . 
  he has more science than i will have in my whole life . 
  i would appreciate any fellow so good willed to help . 
  actually that prices are more reasonable than expected.a normal suite in a normal 5 * hotel goes for 1000 $ -3000 $ price , and believe me some do not deserve it.the 10000 $ sounds more reasonable for every suite in burj to be honest . 
  i was going according to the information the commenter gave.however the dubai hotels are not the `` best '' or the most expensive.i can easily imagine swiss hotels on par or even more exclusive than burj . 
  burj and the others in dubai are simply the best known because you pay 10000 $ for a hotel in an area that 20 year ago lived nomads . 
  hey if the money are spent in legal ways and all taxes paid , you can pay 1 mill . 
  $ for picasso 's turds for all i care . 
  i actually think the price of the room was a bargain . 
  but they got you in the amenities . 
  you went to the casino also did n't you ? 
  is it really that shithole ? 
  i have friends and family insisting going work there since i am without a job for 2 years ( greek . . ) but despite , or maybe because the great income they say you can get , i do n't want to get even close to that place . 
  i was working in a hotel that charged about 200 $ for a single small room ... without windows . 
  ** bollocks **, 
  nice ... 
  check about r/gamedeals ( or something ) in reddit too.i am pennyless yet got awesome games for a frraction . 
  thank you i was at work and i was ninja replying . 
  religion and atheism . 
  either way you will be dead . 
  political science + mit?my heaven on earth.too bad american unis do n't accept postgraduate students fro a second degree ( wtf ),

  uhh it was, 
  meyers, 
  also internet overreacts.i found it kinda nice if it was with less piss jokes.i have seen far worse movies . 
  just meyers was like god of comedy for some during the early 00s and they got shocked he was n't . 
  they read your ( stressed ) body cues when you are home.they remember the smell/place like danger when they arrive . 
  speech is one thing . 
  [ cognition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognition ) ( not cognizance ) is a second . 
  dogs lack * stuctured * speech , and have limited cognition . 
  mute people lack speech , and have cognition on par with the rest of the humans . 
  humans with autism have different cognitive processes.not lower , * different * . 
  cognition is not an on/off situation.there are different `` scales '' . 
  damn , that scene ... . . chills all over . 
  edit : deacon frost makes and early appearance ( 1:40 ) ?!, 
  dang it took me only 16 years to catch that . 
  stalin 's propaganda started early . 
   i ca n't imagine material possessions being as highly regarded in society as they are today . 
   people will want power still , that seems ( although debated ) to be intrinsic nature of humans . 
  there is your answer.the crave for power is hardwired on our brains mainly due to our reproductive system . 
  materialism exists because we need items that project our power like the feathers of a peacock . 
  exacly . 
  the great leader was above the time continuum * or else . 
  i f you broke the die i think that counts like a -1 roll . 
  i actually love speaking protagonists because i feel we going through the adventure together . 
  but for some game it works . 
  hl1 was not a `` shooting gallery '' , but was bordering on action horror genre and hearing the voice of free-man would break your immersion.he would either have to explain what is happening in scientific terms or scream like a girl.he is only a scientist after all . 
  you will somehow have polish tank crews with texan accents . 
  magic !, 
  who is `` we '' ? . 
  kinda arrogant instantly assuming that i am american . 
  have n't being in an aggressive war since 1912 buddy . 
  actually 1136 ad.stupid video snapshot . 
  they do n't accept videos unfortunately . 
  again you are generalizing.western countries include sweden , norway , greece , portugal , switzerland , belgium ... 
  what you wanted to say i think , is that some of the g8 are running cov ops . 
  no surprise on that . 
  yeah i got it by the second time i watched . 
  it is.still a good video . 
  pockets?for the cap indoors ? 
  mrs ultra direct : or how [ burj khalifa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/burj_khalifa.jpg ) went to mars and back again . 
  yes , but imagine all the info about perfect martian spots for needless mega real estate it would bring back ? 
  imagine that : an artificial archipelago looking like a [ huge map of the earth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world_\\ ( archipelago \\ ) ) in a artificial sea in motherfucking hellas planitia !!,

  it [ europa universalis 4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_universalis_iv ) a grand strategy game by [ paradox interactive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_interactive ) . 
  it is an excellent game if you where ever a fan of alternate history and strategy games with a lot of depth . 
  try it : [ steam page with demo ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/ ) . there are a lot of tutorial in this subreddit and do n't hesitate to ask . 
  or you know , simply release a virus systemically while the few you want to save are kept inoculated and safe in bunkers.no radioactive fallout , no long term damage to the ecology , most infrastructure stays up so you decide what to keep and what to dismantle . . even if you get attacked by the globe , your main target will be the civilian populations , something that will cripple the armies in a few weeks . 
  however with nuclear/conventional warfare the chances of out of control destruction ( aka total extinction ) is greater than using a genetically engineered virus that * maybe * mutates in a way that can harm those that you want to save . 
  plus it is a weapon that self cleans , since when every carrier dies , the weapon dies with them if it is engineered correctly . 
  also it is a good publicity choice since you can use it covertly , while in public you are the one that created the vaccine ( that for some reason goes only to those you want to save of course ) so retaliation is easier to avoid . 
  missile launches are very difficult to hide . 
  i think you just wrote one of the shortest horror/scifi stories ever . 
  and yet i ca n't study in us universities because they do n't allow graduates to get a second bachelor . 
  why ? 
  if you can spare one afternoon to play a board game with beers and friend then you can play dnd.if you get past that atrocious afternoon everyone rolls characters and new guys learn to play . 
  or maybe this happened more than 1 month ago and the memory is fuzzy . 
  there are always there :, 
  in the water , in the air , in bugs and animals , there are millions of life forms all around you right now multiplying and dying . . 
  the majority are harmless , another good part is eradicated by your immunity system every minute with you not even realizing it . 
  some of them will get to you , but the only thing you need is some chicken soup or some antibiotics at worst . 
  for those few that can be really dangerous , billions of dollars , years of research and some of the best people in medical science have given you total immunity with just a small prick and a lollipop . 
  unless your parents are criminally idiots . 
  now imagine if it is a starting group with a novice dm . 
  it can actually take days to be ready . 
  and that is why dnd will be mostly a niche product . 
  the entry is too damn difficult for new guys . 
  i did wrote that the life forms could be from other animals :, 
   in the water , in the air , ** in bugs and animals ** , there are millions of life forms . . 
  actually just one of three guys.and he only created his character , we where too exhausted to play . 
  but we dont want to scare / u/grandmasdiapers , do we ? 
  i am getting a 270 euros monthly salary.my father was paying 400 euros flat per month for `` insurance '' as a shop owner , no matter how the economy is doing . he is now making about 200 euros gross per month.tops.the 400 have not changed.he is over 10000 euros in debt and rising.he is probably counted on your `` noone is paying '' statistic . 
  you can take your generalising , unsourced data and shove it up your well fed ass.thank you .
