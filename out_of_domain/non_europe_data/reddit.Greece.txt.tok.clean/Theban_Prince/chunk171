  it definitely was n't like it was always a prime beacon of knowledge that got shut down and burn in a night by fanatic christians , forever dooming humanity to the dark ages . 
  well its good anyways because til . 
  i think her saying that is a myth , but the paphlets circulating at the time claiming she did * werent ? 
  thank you for the further information !, 
  so it is indeed a real part of that time period and not an urban myth that spread much later . 
  it was just a real part of * propaganda * of the time period . 
  i am saying that havimg basic human right doesnt mean they are poor . 
  there is a reason we call the `` basic '' . 
  the game is already overflowing with pay to win newbs . 
  i deal with them all day , you will be surpised how many come to null loaded with isk and skills , only to get bored and saying `` huh 20mil per tick ? 
  lame '' in a two week character . 
  i would like to point out that there going to be ammar citadels . 
  limited yes but they would be . 
  also fromall the stuff that could pisses you off , station interiors where the one that pushed you over the edge ? 
  swtor is infinetely more easy to get into . 
  plus they hit a goldmine with appearence microtransactions in a game that has one of the best character customisations . 
  which also exists in eve . . only you never see it . 
  ccp is again ripping of an entire succesfull object of the industry , past its prime , and simply shove it in the game as is . 
  well yeah but you know , getting new blood was one of the major problems of eve , making it worse is not a smart move even if they have short gains . 
  unless they are trying to cashout . 
  aww you gave him a save from his dumb original comment . 
  did you put a `` read this shocking thing ! '', 
  as a title ? 
  because if no then chances are low of anyone bothering, 
  ir you know , try to fix the game at some point . 
  we have been waiting for 14 years for eve to eeach its `` true potential '' that is akways a couple of years off . 
  exactly . 
  they implemented a system that works in games that you dont lose your stuff you bought with your $ $ , in a game that is entirely based around the fact that you * do * , and the player market is player driven meaning the core of the game * must * be grindy ( mining , pve ) as not to break the market . 
  so players that fork 30 $ to get a leg up can lose everything on undock , then realise they have to wait weeks or months to get the same stuff by * actually * playing the game or give more dollars . 
  hence why the plex vault makes sense but is only a patch in an already problematic system . 
   decker was vice president of ea 's `` play4free '' group, 
  the `` play4free '' group was responsible for gems such as :, 
  * [ battlefield play4free ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battlefield_play4free ), 
  * [ need for speed : world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/need_for_speed:_world ), 
  * [ lord of ultima ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord_of_ultima ), 
  * [ battleforge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battleforge ), 
  while getting angry at mr. sean decker might seem logical at first , he is only doing his job , and was employed based on his experience . 
  if you want to get angry , get angry with that people that employed him . 
  thanks hilmar !, 
  remember the summer of rage ? 
  theban_prince remembers !, 
  edit : i am getting a lot of `` but this is a 2013 article ! '' . 
  i did n't say eve * will * be a mobile type game , i said it already * is * . 
  the philosophy was there for a [ long time ] ( http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/poeticstanziel/vol-1-greed-is-good.pdf ) . 
  it is the process that has been mostly completed now . 
  yes because ccp employing some dude and then a couple of years later we start seeing changes that look almost a copy paste of all his previous jobs has nothing to do with it !, 
  surely !, 
  also death threats did n't came from me . 
  report it to the mods . 
  i do n't even have a problem with the dude , but with ccp that already had set towards this course and only stalled after a sizable player base got pissed in 2011 . 
  then they started slowly adding them again . 
  sean decker is doing simply what he was employed to do . 
  him getting a job was decided by others . 
  its done . 
  the core mechanics are in the game and only expanding on the options is what is left . 
  and considering you can already buy everything with $ $ including skills and cosmetic items there arent much more they can add . 
  not even a generic ea dude . 
  on of the previous heads of the much maligned free to play system . 
  they added mobile microtranscations into the game down to the ads . 
  what more would i want to know that can suddently change that into something completely different ? 
  give it a shot . 
  thank god we have other ways of communicating . 
  but we can still call them assholes for doing so after playing and paying for years . 
  do you expect someone to start cranking changes in a company after a few weeks ? 
  also this show the philosophy of ccp wanted to/has followed as i have stated . 
  ah yes creativity and innovation ? 
  did you noticed they literally copy pasted the frigging ads ? 
   all because you disagree with microtransactions doesnt make them ` bad ' . . theyre a fact of life in todays gaming industry . 
  ususally for games that have been built from the ground app like this , and advertised as such . 
  plus eve is not some theme park mmo or first person shooter . 
  i give you 0/10 for creativity , 3/10 for execution because i always like sarcasm . 
  please try again , maybe with a bit of originality . 
  i mean , at its core it has n't changed that much since 2006 or so except rmts . 
  so op success ? 
  i find it really funny that they have been pushing this mode since at least 2009-2010 , but now they `` might need it to survive against some reason , amirite guys ? '' . 
  what reasons they have that they could keep doing business for 7 years , and only needed a shitty model to survive now ? 
  for no apparent reason , you can move along . 
   but it 's more straight forward especially for new players to the game . 
  how you actually interacted with any new players lately ? 
  because i do daily , and a lot of them join , pay up some $ $ to get a leg up towards the `` endgame '' ( which do n't exist in eve ) and then either a ) lose their shit and unsubscribe , or b ) realize they need to work weeks or months to get the same isk they got in 5 minutes , get bored and and unsubscribe . 
  its telling that alpha status , a part of the `` free-to-play '' model that has saved mmos from closing down or even supported entire franchises had barely made a blimp in eve numbers . 
   it would take alot to make eve a pay to win game . 
  take two equal , baseline competent new players . 
  forbid one using any plex and just make due with what they get with in game isk and skill grinding , then give the other 50 $ to spend in plex . 
  tell me who is would being doing good in eve after a week . 
  now take the 50 $ guy and get him versus a guy that has 500 $ . 
  eve has been a pay to win game for quite while , but the barrier was quite high so people did n't notice that much . 
  the new changes , especially the plex breakup where done so they can `` fix '' that . 
  this . 
  those where theories . 
  i never believed them . 
  however , implementing a very familiar concept of the industry exactly like it is in other games down to a copy paste ad for ~ ~ gold ~ ~ ~ ~ tokens ~ ~ plex makes me wonder if it was done so it easier to sell it . 
  i can imagine that `` look we have microtransactions like x or y game and we project z % increase in revenue '' is easier to present in a powerpoint presentation . 
  just because we hear about the guy that plexed enough to fly an officer fit caracal for lvl2 missions and autopiloted out of jita , most players are baseline competent . 
  just others are more wealthy than some . 
  and this was already a problem but at least it lessened the gold farmers . 
  but now with the microplex you can use it as mobile games/p2w that will make it easier to simply pay for everyday stuff regularly while people that dont have the isk simply grind . 
  oh you saw that nice fitted ship ? 
  why not buy it just for 20 plex ( -20 % only for today ! ), 
  to get it now , instead of grinding missions for a couple of days ?
