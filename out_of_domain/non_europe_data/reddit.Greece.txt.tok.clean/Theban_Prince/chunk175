  the board game diplomacy is designed for backstabbing when playing ( in contrast with eve which is * not * needed , just not forbidden ) . 
  would you go as far as feigning friendship and hanging out with players just so you earn their trust and win in the game ? 
  the army from the movie is the total amount they had at that point ( 200k with presumably the million as well ) . 
  however you are right on point that the republic took on financing and producing more and more clone troopers as the war raged on , and it was actually used by sidious to take over the financial structure of the galaxy from within by nationalizing the banks before finishing off the political structure ( clone wars , canon ) . 
  huh ? 
  namur is nice , if you like walks definitely check the citadel !, 
  i think the mandela effect was nice when i first heard it , because it is an indication that some misconceptions are quite common and might be due to biological/psychological reasons . 
  the most famous example , the berestain bears ( or whatever ) might have its root to the font they used for the books confusing readers constantly , or when the memory degraded over time it is easier to remember it like that , its not a surprise that most memories they discuss are about childhood . 
  even reading about the confusion others have might cause a confusion to you as well , memory is a tricky thing ( see dejavu for example ) . 
  but nooo they had to go full conspiratards with alternate dimensions . 
  i ecstatic that my advice turned to be something so good for you !, 
  yeah the whole citadel hill had a weird atmosphere for us as well . 
  it had small cafes in places , with people chilling , right next to formidable fortifications that have seen a lot and bloody history . 
  i havent visited liege yet , tell me how it compares to namur !, 
  most importantly , if he tries to claw them for affection/annoyance as cats do ... 
  yes in both accounts . 
  also most people forget that the vast amount of reddit users are in the 16-25 bracket , not in the `` 45 bald with a dark van '' . 
  i agree whith u/flyingweagle . 
  the alien was minding his own bussiness and he was content with the chinese , heck he was indifferent to humans , then the americans go all the way to recruit them , even risking a border incident so then they can give him back ? 
  are americans responcible for testing the chinese alien populations political integrity or something ? 
  ahh now the sa in you name makes sense . 
  thanks for being glad xd, 
  it has great potential with minor adjustments , maybe the alien was simply pissed with the chinese for whatever readon , and after hearing how fractured the human nations are comparef to aliens he assumed that he could take advantage of that and decided to run off with the data by his own volition , only to find out that humans band together versus aliens . 
  the `` clones '' where part of him . 
  if we want to take this example on a normal couple it was like she had emotional problems because of his negligence , only for him to try to fix things by trying bdsm bondage with her to `` spice up their sex '' , but her position while tied meant it allowed him to keep an eye on his stock meter . 
  except the annoying respwning bases . 
  i had to leave it unfished because of that , when it was an absolut blast in a setting that is very untouched ( modern afrika ) . 
  they could respawb the guards like , a couple of days later or if you went far enough . 
  sometime you cleaned a base , went 200 meters away , backtracked for whatever reason ( usually guards hunting you ) and fell in the middle of a fully stocked abd manned base again . 
  now reapeat for every crossroads . 
  actually 1 captains quarters . 
  its their only way to `` hurt '' the west at this point . 
  flood the web with propaganda and hope a random psycho out of the thousands decides he had enough booze and women in this world and goes to cleanse his soul and become a proper muslim . . and take with him as many `` infidels '' as he can . 
  then they claim responsibility knowing the western media will eat and regurgitate that shit up for * weeks * . 
  0 % cost , maximum media coverage . 
  a lot of communist ideologies subscribe in an `` armed struggle/revolution '' . 
  from those you only get dictatorships in the end . 
  one of the most ridiculus death in the history of cinema . 
  `` and now my dear you will pay with your life !, 
  just please stand still for 45 minutes while my associate paints '' . 
  you are thiking of '' [ ouais ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ouais ) '' . 
  that does n't change anything . 
  that means at least one guy was just standing there waiting with a gun in his hand for another guy to finish painting and for her to die * really * *** really *** slowly . 
  `` yes yes my dear you will suffer with all this paint !, 
  i am evil ! '', 
  * any * death is extremely unpleasant . 
  the manner you die though can still be ridiculous . 
  if you are talking about falcon , the first stage that is reusable does n't actually achieve orbit . 
  is part of the explanation that getting up is not that difficult , but getting sideways is . 
  and it still uses [ aerobreaking ] ( http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/16892430560_f87dff78c0_o_1.jpg ) to lose speed . 
  its helpful , sure , but more ? 
  i mean , this is understanding a basic concept that you need when you start the game , gravity wells are helpful a bit later , and in this case its not even for the kerbal system . 
  i think he established that you could , but it will take a huge amount of fuel to do so . 
  first and second aircraft image links are the same !, 
  i dont know if you found out , but you can cntrl + f and find the perks based on the titles that exist in the document named `` 00ascension_perks '' in root game folder/common/ascension perks . 
  use a notepad program like notepad + + to find the titles and edit the save games , its really useful , and handy if you want to tweak paradox games in general, 
  if you are in an elevator and it drops with you on it , you are going to levitate even with 100 % gravity no ? 
  now imagine if the elevator dropped in a nevernding circle around earth . 
  you are still getting pulled by the earth , but you are speeding latteraly so fast you miss the ground . 
  you `` float '' inside the station because it falls at the same speed as you ( your relatice velocity to the station is 0 , * but * your relative speed to earth is some * km/h * ) . 
  understanding this will also help you understand how to randevous for docking , get as close to you target as possible , then at the closest point either break or burn to decrease the relative speed to 0 . 
  voila , you are hovering a few hundrent meters away from the door . 
  playing `` blue danube '' at this point is entirely optional . 
  the remaining 0.46 miles are spent watching the unskippable youtube ad . 
  well yeah ... but its even slower , and even more boring !, 
   you can substitute the heat shield by using low-thrust retropropulsion that creates a protective plume . 
  the propulsion wo n't slow , though -- rocket will still aerobrake , but with leas heat stress to structure . 
  that 's the proposal for f9 2nd stage recovery . 
  so a just heat shield from different materials then ? 
   you can launch the rocket from platform built on something like 40km , it removes a lot of dv wasted on atmospheric resistance on launch . 
  though , not really much . 
  kinda ~ 1 km/s . 
  he directly addressed it here :, 
   `` only a fraction of a rocket 's energy is used to lift up out of the atmosphere ; the vast majority of it is used to gain orbital ( sideways ) speed . '', 
  `` power converters '' . 
  you are very close . 
  but its not the curvature that matters much , but how fast you are going . 
  orbits are circular because a ) we spent the minimum speed needed to reach a trajectory that doest collide because fuel is extremely expensive and b ) you * can * go straight ahead , as a matter of fact we have done multiple times to reach other planets , * but * when that happens you will escape earth and fling into the void . 
  kinda not what we want for sattelites . 
  just imagine you have thrown a stone with impossible strenth , and there is no air to slow it down . 
  theoretically if you threw it fast enough it would orbit the earth some mere meters over the ground !, 
  i was trying to keep thing as basic as possible . 
  ofcourse the radius matters , a long with numerous other stuff . 
  but the basic mechanics work even without a planet and his radius . 
  if you are standing in an infinite straight plane and threw our rock with infinite speed , it would still achieve `` orbit '' . 
  edit : we are saying the same thing . 
  orbit is achieved by throwing `` fast enough '' . 
  `` fast enough '' depends on what are you trying to orbit . 
  just do a training montage , so what , 2-3 minutes ? 
  spaceshiptwi is suborbital . 
  again , its not going up that is difficult , its getting sideways that is the problem . 
  well you could definetely get q very very long drop that way , and depending on the balloon , they could reach high enough to reach the edge of space , but why waste a good rc plane when the rocket by itself woukd do fine ? 
  hah yes !, 
  you have 99,5 % chance of some ~ ~ grizzly ~ ~ ~ ~ edit : panda ~ ~ grisly murder/suicide had happened and the basement is haunted . 
  ehh it seams it is reaching its conclusion . 
  i feel it was so tiresome because the erratic update schedule the last months . 
  the law * does * say `` innocent unless proven guilty '' and it worked in this case . 
  so bad example . 
  well unless they believe that they are not `` true americans '' and have to be purged for the shake of the nation , so they are doing their job . 
  it has happened before in other countries ...
