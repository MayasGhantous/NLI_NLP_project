  got triggered for someone finally called you out that this is not `` elite pvp '' but scrub tactics worthy of highsec procurer gangers ? 
  * ofcourse * you need `` permissions '' on what to do with your child . 
  there is a reason we have laws about safeguarding education , healtcare , psycholigical stability etc. 
  sure buddy , and by next dt i will have my systems cockblocked by scrubs with alts . 
  and i never claimed i am `` elite '' you put those things in my mouth to derail the discussion . 
  as a mater of fact we are n't elite , its precisely * because * of that are doing drops to pander our km because it is easy mode . 
  or did * you * missed that part ? 
  i really lucky that you are getting off the rails and trying to band to getherer when someone starts pointing out the flaws in your little `` gamestyle '' i have only seen this in high sec gangers and `` wardeccers '' . 
  `` but we kill people eve is hard htfu htfu '' . 
  well newsflash buddy killing a tied animal does n't make you a hunter , just an impotent . 
  oh you got me there . 
  my self esteem will never come back from this grievous hit . 
  if i have lived in any time other than the modern era , i would be dead since i was 14 , or if i dodged * that * then i would be surely dead by 17 . 
  the first time by a nasty throat infection , then by appendittis . 
  its a somber thought . 
  so instead of dying in 35 you have greater chances to die when only a child . 
  doest make it better . 
  he assumes you are a goon . 
  the whole movie is a story told by a spartan to other spartans/greekz just before the battle of plataies . 
  its a propaganda piece in universe . 
  well reddit was used during wwb as a propaganda tool for most of the alliances that were directly or indirectly benefited from the iwi war . 
  i dont fucking care about goons , but some very seedy shit went down those days , from players to ccp ( banning iwi bankers , then unbanning them , then after wwb has concluded banning them permantly ) . 
  but everyone keeps silent because everyone was involved and the if this explodes will make summer of rage seem like a pyjama party . 
  or you know , i am using a cell phone and i dont really bother to spellcheck because woe if a eve scrub thinks bad of me . . 
  but please , keep making such assumptions to feel better for yourself . 
  do you think i am dumb ? 
   ccp , it 's almost like you expect this to be a game about grinding and hoarding , rather than about shooting other people 's spaceships . 
  how are people going to pay $ $ for isk and skillpoints silly ? 
  man this is like the fourth random thread where you are doing heavy damage control for ccp this month . 
  who the hell are you ? 
  hey do you remember how you trained patiently for weeks , months , years for those 110mil skill points to accumulate ? 
  remember how you spent hours making long term skill plans , how you carefully planed attribute changes , how you always had to update your clone so not to lose your hard earned skill points , how you grinded and grinded so you can finally get those +5 implants to make the skill training juuuust a bit faster , and had to pay attention not to undock in an implant clone ? 
  ** well fuck you buddy !!, 
  ** now anyone can skip ** all ** this by paying hilmar some cold hard $ $ . 
  eve 2017 htfu motherfucker !!, 
  ^ * * ^ ( unless you are rich . ) . 
  oooooooohhhhhh fight fight fight ** fight ** ... 
  its even funnier when the vast majority of organised crime bosses were italian and irish , people that the wasp group really looked down upon at the time as `` immigrants '' . 
  ooooh guys !, 
  an edgy ateheist quoting scriptures . 
  havent seen one in the wild for months !, 
  english is not british . 
  both the irish and the scottish have names with o or mc because of the native languages that influenced it . 
  what happens with the isk you have to pay to unlock th safety box ? 
  it is definetely an isk sink , and i think a major one . 
  those are what ? 
  20 pictures from the same 4 episodes , one of the the very * first * of the series ? 
  and how `` i do n't want to go '' or the master was childish ? 
  dont get me wrong , there where some camp moments in rtd era for sure , but this is a shitpost . 
   built for the vacuum of space, 
  precisely for that reason . 
  space suits are made to counteract the lack of inwards pressure from the environment , in water pressure would effect in the opposite way possibly bursting the suit . 
  and the materials used might not be designed for underwater operations , salinity might break the seals or corrosion might effect the electronics etc. 
  ask and you will receive : http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/, 
  it even comes with bugs !, 
   there are n't * many * land vehicles, 
  do you know what qa and intellectual theft is ? 
  so they are going through the whole process of getting developers , but without actually employing them . 
  niceee move bethesda !, 
  capitalism wins again !, 
  the pope is leader of only a part of christianity . 
  how orthodox and the various protestant denominations fit in your idea , particularly the latter with their bible literralism being a huge core aspect ? 
  you have it backwards . 
  without the rich , there is no poor , whithout the powerfull there is no weak . 
  meaning for soneone to be rich and powerfull someone else needs to be poor and week . 
  peoples republic of korea is a republic . 
  the nazis where socialist . 
  we were always at war with eastasia . 
  those are not unique to the game industry . 
  how are you so sure they are the same people ? 
  why people that werent happy with * some * of rtd stuff might be dissapointed more by moffat ( or vise versa ) ? . 
  are you buildibg strawmen to feel better ? 
  whoa this is a jewel in the mud . 
  well a jewel made of shit , but still a good find . 
  you recognised the names of all redditors in all the whovian subreddits for the last 5 years , and those redditors are the same people that write in all the forums , blogs , news articles etc ? 
  that makes it worse actually . 
  if * he * was the doctor . 
  you have to give him that . 
  thats not a reboot . 
  yeah because having teens that can fry you or mind control you because they dont know what they are is better . 
  are xavier recruiting child soldiers as well ? 
  yes a mysticsl power thst id influenced by emotions both consiously and umconsiously can be simply explained . 
  and since the stronger emotions like fear and pain are the most dangerous , and more commn during cnflcts including war , lets shield the force senditives from it as long as possible . 
  * surely * war and calamity only strikes where the jedi exist right ? 
  light and dark is two sides of the same coin as cancer cells the other side of your own cells . 
  luke was a complete , huge fuckup getting saved from his screwups by winging it up , and coasted until the last possible second . 
  and he still got saved by anakin . 
  the kids are not normal kids that you take from 21 century us and throw them in the angolan civil war . 
  they have been dealt a bad card not from the jedi but from the force . 
  its either training to control their emotions up to and including battle conflict or they will explode the heads of their teen crush that rejected them . 
  who would you want to run around ? 
  and this ignores that there is always the option of stopping your training as ashoka did . 
  bet a sith academy allows that freedom to their students !, 
  as a matter of fact , jedi where pacificists and neutral and that caused a ) dark siders to appear anyway and b ) a sith empire that almost crashed the entire galaxy . 
  when good men dont act and all that . 
  last time i checked parents are asked for their children to participate . 
  case in point there are other force sensitive cultures that are not jedi but they still have some kind of training . 
  and someobe can forgo being a worker in any industry and be a freelancer/self employed . 
  that doest change that bethesda will capitalise on the work of others without giving them the same worker rights . 
  i will probably get cut in half by the hype train , but these videos look like a simple graphics update .
