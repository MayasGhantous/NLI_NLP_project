   or start a revolution . 
  lets ask the syrians or the ukranians how that went, 
  oh right they are fighting for their lives . 
  [ either a bloody viking raid , child sacrifice or simply that the bridge is falling down aka collapsing . 
  i believe the simpler answer is the doctor 's shenanigans in london with a girl named bridge ( t ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_bridge_is_falling_down#meaning ), 
  i was actually going for a lovecraftian story but yeah , sure ... funny . 
  i will definitely check it out . 
  [ erfworld ] ( http://www.erfworld.com/ ) was also based around this , about a tabletop player that is transported on a world who follows tabletop strategy rules ( turns , move counters etc ) . 
  too bad rob switched on cheesy videos and text walls . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  you are comparing two different mediums with tho different layers of immersion.since movies are not interactive , you can lose interest and immersion pretty fast . 
  i think if done properly , it can be a blast ... but for rare if only once try of course . 
  i am not actually thinking of a particular group.as a matter of fact that is one of the points of this brainstorming . . like what kind of group would enjoy that . 
   i would be annoyed if they did use it . 
  this is not a bone.this a curse that true , it can get old fast but it would create kidna interesting rp hooks.and remember , its a curse , they cant use them in game . 
  yup ... cassandra was what i had in mind !, 
  yup.only you do n't have a premonition , you know exactly what is going on . 
   there 's also the jackasses that think it 's cool to assault characters . 
  why have n't anyone thought that locking up the humans that do that will solve every single problem of humanity ? 
  it could be used as a trap . 
  a lure for douches . 
  that will be the singularity !, 
  they are filled with an explosive ( well not gunpowder exactly ) . it is simply missing here . 
  you are seeing the curse from the players view.not from the character view . 
  how would a human feel , if the gods where real and he heard their thoughts , intrigues and knew before hand their world changing whims ? 
  but he was the only human able to do so and nobody would believed him ? 
  that 's a curse . 
  i love cliches . 
  they exist for a reason . 
  no they will have to sacrifice for humanity shake . 
  we will have the best pstd therapists waiting for them !, 
  hmmm mage and dnd combined ... 
  you are focusing on rhe mecahnics.ok let me put is better :, 
  what if he character heard the dice roll with every action ? 
  the point is that the character will not be given the phb to read and use it in world , but simply known what his world is a `` game '' and other intelligent being manipulate the entire reality for fun . 
  if you are so worried that it will suck for the players , you can sue it on a npc that goes ( from the pc character perceptive ) insane , and the party investigates . 
  cliches are tropes , and depending on the situation you can improve upon that . 
  for example , a white knight saving the fair lady from the bad dragon is cliche , and disco is a dead horse . 
  but what about a disco knight saving a princess from a dragon ? 
   my suggestion : do n't . 
  you do n't exactly started a conversation on how to improve on my concept . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthew_shepard ), 
  i have no idea how dead pool is as a character . 
  surprising for the dnd stereotype , i am not actually into comics . 
  what i ** do ** know is that he is a fiction character that knows he is a fiction character , but nobody believes him , so i used the name to get my message across as easy as possible . 
  and as i said , knowing he is a `` fictional '' character does not necessarily means he knows/understands the game mechanics ( something that it was pointed out in this discussion , and yes it would be difficult for your run on the mill player to have fun ) so a npc might be better.for a villain i do n't know , why an `` evil '' character would feel tragic ? 
  maybe a npc that turned `` evil '' / insane because he said `` fuck it there is no point on our actions anyway , lets have some fun '' . 
  see you have gave me food for thought for days.thank you very much !, 
  also i am thinking on using it not in dnd anymore , but in a story , maybe a short story where the heroes ( appears to ) interact with the reader somehow . 
  if you have read the never ending story , it is a premature example . 
  they are going the google route i think . 
  would you imagine 4 years ago a search engine website manufacturing robot cars?well maybe in 5 years facebook will not only be a social website . 
  to be honest , the ruler portrait in that photo looks retarded also . 
  sultan derp of derp sultanate ... xd, 
  yeah ... i cant imagine if one of the fucks up what happens . 
  yeah ... i call bullsh ~ ~ ark ~ ~ it . 
  there is * something * in the water with them ... 
  these `` greek '' hurt so much to hear ... 
  oh my god thank you rrrrreddit !, 
   fuck it , i 'll make my own church . 
  truly the awesomest `` fuck it '' this world have ever heard . 
  because it was followed by a lot of fucking afterwards . 
  i was about to rebuke you !, 
  damn for stopping me being all high and mighty on reddit for today . 
  americans . 
  they even feel entitled about tips . 
  sauron : '' his departing spirit towered above mordor like a black cloud , but was blown away by a powerful wind from the west ( the direction of the blessed realm and the valar ) . '', 
  pretty the same with saruman . 
  the could n't die , since they where maiar , but they lost so much power that they become simply shades with zero power in the world . 
  meh ... no much different from being a lowly peasant of the imperium . 
   though these would be fixed pretty quickly . 
  no.it would probably bar us from space for years , at worst for decades.it is called [ kessler syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kessler_syndrome ) and it a very very real global danger . 
  thank the gods for that, 
  well he was going the wrong way , what did he expect ? 
  * `` apathy is death . 
  * `` direct action is not always the best way . 
  it is a far greater victory to make another see through your eyes than to close theirs forever . 
  the encrypted rock existence is disputed.from what i recall it was reported in book about the `` mystery '' and was based mostly on hearsay . 
  oh for what is holy ... 
  you would be able to see him.if you can observe his state ( aka his position relative the powder and his surroundings ) , you can see him .

  ohhh at least i got a nice new . gif !, 
  travel a bit from the starting area , but always try to remember where you in case you die . 
  next thing is to press esc , in the main menu that opens choose `` console '' and in the new window type : bind f2 `` help '' that will allow you when you press f2 to call the guards of nearby towers to attack your target/mobs that trying to eat you . 
  after that when you travel stick close to [ towers ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/guard_tower ) , and if something attacks you call the [ guards ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/tower_guard ) and run in circles until they attack and save you . 
  find a place close to an open mine with [ iron vain ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/iron_lump ) and water and build your first hovel . 
  next thing you can , create a [ bow ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/bow ) / arrows and an [ archery target ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/archery_target ) and start grinding archery , that rises the [ body control stat ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/body_control ) that allows you to eventually ride [ horses ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/horse ) , something that will enable you to be safe 95 % of the time . 
  also build a [ bed ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/bed ) asap to get [ sleep bonus ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/sleep_bonus ) when you log off , so you can get skill gain faster, 
  final advise , always have open the [ wurm wiki ] ( http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/main_page ) and when in doubt , use the ingame help channel . 
  i suggest you post that review in r/mmorpg . 
  it is brief yet it encapsulates a good description of the game . 
  the engine is like a huge , white , spotless room with buckets of paint and some brushes in one corner.you can paint dali , picasso , da vinci or even a simple huge smiley face . 
  the engine is the room , with the bricks of the walls and the paint buckets the underlying basic code that makes it easy to create whatever you want , without having to build a room from scratch every time you want to paint . 
   if his dad was around he 'd be in the pub all day or a bookies . 
  that ** also ** counts as `` growing up without a dad '' , sparky . 
  people are talking about environmental issues like there were a secret when millions of people are aware about them.i do n't want to minimize their significance , but they are not exactly undersold, 
  what is the real elephant in the room ? 
  human slavery .
