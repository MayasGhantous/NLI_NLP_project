  ultimately losses are unavoidable , but stupid no reason welps get old fast . 
  maybe they should fire some skin guys and hire some code guys then . 
  or if skins are making too good $ $ to do this they should simply use them to hire the code guys . 
  this si an interesting report , dont have enough financial knowledge to comment how accurate is . 
  its weeks no years . 
  was n't there a point that a bomb was released due to problems with the airplane , and when it was recovered it was discovered that it was armed and all safeties disengaged except the very last one due to turbulence ? 
  not exactly a ballpeen hammer , but catastrophe was almost in reach by random luck . 
  better play safe when you are dealing with weapons that if the unthinkable and improbable happens , you can wipe an entire city . 
  would they pay for the 800 trailer ? 
  he said * hel * will have fogotten about the disease in 5 years . 
  the incubation time is 5 weeks from her perspective . 
  unless they are is concentrated attention from other media that can damage their revenue , they wont do shit . 
  the problematic subs and the ecosystem they breed are thousand of clicks per hour . 
   its super effective !, 
  doux katakouzinos fainted . 
  do it . 
  half the game is half finished concepts though . 
  i think coal workers where mostly except from conscription due to doing an essential job . 
  also most of them would be quite old already . 
  or more probably dead from all the coal dust . 
  and , as not a us guy , this is turning me back into , uhh , other methods of seeing movies . 
  because `` this content/service is region locked '' . 
  i really dont understand their logic . 
  its not even greed since they are losing potential customers . 
  i think you mean `` double meaning '' . 
  `` double ententre '' is used for more ... uh . . risque stuff . 
  individually and on a random player 's level the problems are not * that * noticable . 
  you can stilll have months of enjoyable play before you come across a situation that it will make you realise the game is bursting at the seams . 
  those problems are worrying for the medium to long term future of eve . 
  if you want to replay it it has an `` autolock '' feature/exploit ( ? ), 
  where you press the button to bring up your iron sights and it autotargets anything that is in the general area around the center of the screen . 
  so if you are shooting three people behind the same rock , you target -  shoot -  let go -  target and you can kill everyone is seconds . 
  also the game has a bullet time mode that you can activate by pressing down the right stick in ps3 and it is upgradable . 
  weirder thing have happened . 
  you know the japanese lady that squatted in someones home sleeping in one if the * closets * for months right ? 
  [ the only stark made with organic tomatoes !, 
  i think this confirms an idea i had . 
  the snarl was n't created at the creation of the first world , but after the fact , when the world was already populated . 
  the snarl was probably came to be due to gods directly interfering with the mortal realms without any of the rules they have now , and the gods created the second world on top of the other nuking the souls of the mortals and/or leaving them to get destroyed by the snarl . 
  essentially what they where trying to do with the present godsmoot . 
  so if the knowledge is out , that due to the fault of * all * of the gods * they have to kill everyone and destroy/abandon the world every now and then its not going to go down well for any believer . 
  * except the dark one because he was created in the second world . 
  he might claim moral superiority over the rest of the pantheons due to this . 
  i said he claims/will claim , not that he has it . 
  sooo if you order a cheeseburger in mcdonalds and after 1 hour sit has n't arrived you will not say anything because they `` does n't owe us anything '' ? 
  we are customers , even if we don t give him money * directly . 
  i really do n't think you understand what a customer is . 
  so you are not a costumer when you watch a public channel in tv ? 
  or you are not a customer when you are given free samples in the store just because you do n't pay ? 
  ** word of mouth ** and internet traffic are tangible concepts marketing companies all over had researched and established huge marketing plans just on them and their effects . 
  oots had one of the most successful kickstarters ( aka $ $ ) ever * because * of them , despite users/customers not paying for it directly . 
   mcdonald 's exists to make money . 
  oots is art, 
  art existed to make money almost since its inception . 
  or are beethoven and da vinci less artists than the giant because they took payed commissions or sold their works ? 
   he absolutely does not owe you anything . 
  oh he owes us everything . 
  if he did n't want criticism or adoration he should had kept his works private . 
  when you go public , you are * asking * for the interaction with those that will see them . 
  actually both mcdonalds and rich * are * getting payed by us voicing out our good opinion . 
  as i said , word of mouth is a very valid commodity that entire marketing campaigns have been based on or tried to emulate ( read about astroturfing ) . 
  and there * is * an `` unwritten '' agreement between viewership and the giant , that he will have to keep his `` product '' at least the same , in this case the quality of the comic and the update scedule * should * not necessarily be more frequent , but definetely consistent , dont you think ? 
  particularly since delays where caused by perhaps overabitious kickstarter goals he himself chose . 
  finally people voicing their opinions can be a good thing , since it means people are still engaged with the comic . 
  the danger is when people stop talking all together , because it means they have moved on . 
  you would be surprised ... / r/tipofmyjoystick, 
   yknow , art in exchange for exposition is a pretty shitty deal , especially for a well-known d&d comic . 
  you have things backwards , the comic is well-known , he is not `` hurting '' for exposure and he had a successful kickstarter * because * he delivered a comic ( product ) with consistent quality and standard schedule that * then * resulted in good word of mouth being spread around . 
  he practiced `` art in exchange for exposition '' since day one . 
  if he start to slip up from his `` baseline '' quality/delivery its normal to first voice our displeasure and then well , leave . 
  i dont think you can void your greek citizenship once you have it . 
  if he was held for being a deserter , it means he was a greek citizen with his file already existing in the military archives ( it is done automatically for all greek male citizens ) and had already an oustanding warrant that led to him been flagged when he decided to travel . 
  unless its a misunderstanding with someone that had the same name ( not very likely ) , this guy broke the law . 
  good to know !, 
  will that be posdsible though when he is under arrest ? 
  til, 
  til v 2.05, 
  however i think both explanations can be be valid * somewhat * . 
  it is definitely something for someone that is holed up somewhere and focused in making isk like there is no tomorrow . 
  so it could be used by people that thought this without knowing the original meaning . 
  perhaps . 
  can confirm , [ this is me as we speak .

  yeah others covered it more thoroughly thanks . 
  gg and the rest spawned when a random dude posted some `` proof '' in a rant that his unknown dev fiance was seeing a random game reviewer and somehow that meant the entire game reviewing industry was `` cheating '' to promote her little indie game . 
  the internet jumped in his non issue in a disproportional crusade . 
  it was pretty obvious the gg was reactionary and misogynistic from the fist second , and `` morals in video game journalism '' had nothing to do with it . 
  there is no category of people that you can call `` gamer '' . 
  yes yes you are deep and different . 
  and its still nonsensical . 
  there is nothing that really connects those individuals in that that group with each other . 
  should `` chess players '' or `` divers '' or `` rock climbers that year red helmets '' be seperate , meaningfulll groups that people can identify with ? 
  its a fake construct , spawned from particular political groups , with a broad enough definition so everyone can get caught in the propaganda of `` gamers are called misogynists !, 
  or whatever . 
  more like 100 years . . 
  there was fighting in athens on december 1944 . 
  and this is why i am playing paradox games using the console, 
  but only for the masculine `` le '' !, 
  the feminine `` la '' stays `` de la '', 
  your comment was n't funny nor original .
