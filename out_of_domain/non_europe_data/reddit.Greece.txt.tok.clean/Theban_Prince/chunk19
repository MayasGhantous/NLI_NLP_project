  there are literally hundreds thousands of people that are used for work against their will . 
  sex trafficking from eastern europe and africa , extremely low wages and underage prostitution in central asia and numerous other cases , that are obviously the old colonialist ties the west still has with the third world , yet because we do n't have black face minstrel shows everyone is sleeping easy . 
  hmm let me check ... yes yes ... slavery did exist since antiquity.but lo !, 
  european countries have been dominating the globe one way or another since at least 1400 ad , that is 600 + years of european supremacy.and `` maybe '' the western world has no direct implication , however it has the power to stop it , but it whistles and closes its ears.that is an elephant in the room . 
  i believe that also , but it is a problem that i have n't seeing anyone special like a us vice president taking notice . 
  and that qualifies for this question i think . 
  i am white and not liberal . 
  not even american . 
  your ego is gigantic . 
  / r/cringe would love this . 
  you cant even read are you ? . 
  i am talking about slavery in general.there are plenty of people of various colors that are oppressed right now.there are even white europeans or us citizens getting forced to prostitution , but skin color has nothing to do with it.and the key word is `` forced '' . 
  and `` american '' has everything to do with your replies that are centered on if i am a white self hating liberal , gloriously demonstrating the self masturbating autism that rules most `` edgy '' us internet users . 
  from what i have read over the years , they rewrote a good deal of his script for the first movie.as the movies got bigger and bigger , so his creative control grew , and by rtj , we had goddamn ewoks .

  woodhouse is still alive and a wwi veteran the only chance that is happening is if he was very young ( 16sh ) and joined the last years of the war , plus the show take place during the early nineties.the best situation i found is he went to war the year 1918 when he was 16 , and the show takes place the year 1991 , and he would still be 89 y.o. 
  he is for all intends and purposes , compared to humans , a literal god .

  while they considered ( and we still do ) descendants of the byzantines , we have never tried calling ourselves `` byzantine empire '' . but we did tried to restore it . 
  [ and we came pretty damn close . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:greekhistory.gif ), 
  apparently you have an issue reading articles :, 
   `` the megali idea ( greek : \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u0399\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 meg\u00e1li id\u00e9a , `` great idea '' [ 1 ] ) was an irredentist concept of greek nationalism that expressed the goal of establishing a greek state that would encompass all ethnic greek-inhabited areas , including the large greek populations that , after the restoration of greek independence in 1830 from the ottoman empire , still lived under ottoman occupation . 
   the term appeared for the first time during the debates of prime minister ioannis kolettis with king otto that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution . 
  [ 3 ] this was a visionary nationalist aspiration that was to dominate foreign relations and , to a significant extent , determine domestic politics of the greek state for much of the first century of its independent existence . 
  if the expression was new in 1844 , the concept had roots in the greek popular psyche , nurtured as it was by prophecies and legends that had kept hopes of eventual liberation from turkish rule and imperial ( byzantine ) restoration alive . 
  [ 3 ] this is reflected in the folk saying :, 
   ( once more , as years and time go by , once more they shall be ours ) . 
   the megali idea implied the goal of reviving the eastern roman ( byzantine ) empire by establishing a greek state , which would be , as ancient geographer strabo wrote , a greek world encompassing mostly the former byzantine lands from the ionian sea to the west , to asia minor and the black sea to the east , and from thrace , macedonia and epirus to the north , to crete and cyprus to the south . 
  this new state would have constantinople as its capital : it would be the `` greece of two continents and five seas '' ( europe and asia , and the ionian , aegean , marmara , black , and libyan seas , respectively ) . '', 
  and about us trying , well ... 
   ** partial realization and subsequent defeat **, 
   main article : balkan wars, 
   a major proponent of the megali idea was eleftherios venizelos , under whose leadership greek territory doubled in the balkan wars of 1912-13 -- southern epirus , crete , lesbos , chios , samos along with the totality of aegean islands and the majority of macedonia were attached to greece . 
  born and raised in crete , in 1909 venizelos was already a prominent cretan and had influence in mainland greece . 
  as such , he was chosen after the goudi coup in 1909 to become prime minister of greece . 
  a proponent of the megali idea , venizelos pressed forward a series of reforms in society , as well as the military and administration , which helped greece succeed in its goals during the balkan wars . 
   ** world war i **, 
   main articles : greece during world war i and treaty of s\u00e8vres, 
   victory in world war i seemed to promise an even greater realization of the megali idea . 
  greece gained in asia minor the administration of smyrna and its hinterland for five years ( after with a referendum it could be incorporated ) , the islands of imbros and tenedos , western and eastern thrace , the border then drawn a few miles from the walls of constantinople : the imperial city seemed within reach . 
   ** greco-turkish war ( 1919-1922 ) **, 
   main article : greco-turkish war ( 1919-1922 ), 
   a major defeat followed in 1922 , however , when the turkish revolutionaries defeated and expelled the greeks from anatolia during the greco-turkish war ( 1919-1922 ) . 
  the treaty of lausanne saw greece lose eastern thrace , imbros and tenedos , smyrna and the possibility of staying in anatolia . 
  to avoid any further territorial claims , both greece and turkey engaged in an `` exchange of populations '' : during the conflict , 151,892 greeks had already fled asia minor . 
  the treaty of lausanne moved 1,104,216 greeks from turkey [ 7 ] , while 380,000 turks left the greek territory for turkey . 
  also , in greece had also moved ( after wwi ) 40,027 greeks from bulgaria , 58,522 from russia ( because of the defeat of wrangel ) and 10,080 from other lands ( for example dodecanese or albania ) , while 60,000 bulgarians from thrace and macedonia had moved to bulgaria . 
   the immediate reception of refugees to greece cost 45 million francs , so the league of nations arranged for a loan of 150 million francs to aid settlement of refugees . 
  in 1930 , venizelos even went on an official visit to turkey , where he proposed that mustafa kemal be awarded the nobel peace prize . 
  it is a very , very sad point of our history.while we named hubris , we forgot what it really meant :,
