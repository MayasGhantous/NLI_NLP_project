  they 'll be at davos , fly private jets with celebrities , speak at ted , lobby politicians/run for office . 
  it 's far better than a beneficiary trust in that it provides for their lifestyle and burnishes their brand . 
  he always had , has and he will always * have * those , only instead now he has 4.6 ** b ** illion dollars less that he gave to charity . 
  * if * he spends money from that charity for traveling around , uses them to , as you say , `` speak at ted '' , aka promote disease eradication in poor countries that killhundends of thousands of children and charity in general , do n't you think it would be a better use of his billions than what other billionaires do ? 
  heck even , if he uses the charity money for pure pleasure , even if he practically splurged nonstop having parties with hookers and blow 24/7 , it would n't even make a * dent * because he gave 4.6 ** b ** illion . 
  so who cares ? 
  finally his net worth is * 89.8 * billion so why he would give a fuck and try to use subterfuge to pay for what is for him the equivalent of the taxi fare is beyond me . 
  its not even the trivilisation . 
  the european countries that have those lawshad a sizeble chunk of nazis and nazi propaganda influenced population initially . 
  it was pretty obvious they would try a ` jew stab in the back '' scheme a second time ( which what they still try to do ) . 
  despite what `` muh free speech !, 
  slippery slope !, 
  slippery slope ! '', 
  dudes would have you think , its pretty easy to distinguish a veditable historian that wants to do holocaust research from a nazi trying to push propaganda . 
  conspiracy theories are extremely dangerous if left unchecked . 
  i find it hilarious that there are at tleast three smugposts about this right now . 
  edit : and now another one with a video of the fight . 
  flu mutates so fast that sometimes the shot are not sufficient , they are essentially playing catch up every year eith the various strains . 
  but you might also ignore the cases that it worked ( because how you would notice ) , but even if we accept they arent 100 % on point its still a way to at least increase the safety of population groups that the flu might be outright lethal , like babies and the elderly . 
  anti-vaccers claim that vaccines not only dont work but that they are full of disease/dangerous chemicals that make you sick so you can be a `` slave of big pharma '' . 
  apparently the solution to measles is prayer/crystals/yoga / this all natural immune boosting drink , that you can get for only 9.99 $ !, 
  more like playing a neverending `` smack the mole '' game . 
  only if you stop playing its game over for thousands of people * more * than if you kept going . 
  its satirical , with some fan love for the character hidden in the core . 
  basically it started by poking fun how the show would pile up random negative shit to a fucking badass * knight * , including a story of unrequited love out of a highschool comedy , particularly in earlier seasons . 
  all in good jest . 
  i dont think both targaryens will survive . . 
  welcome friend !, 
  even if they started from ardas earlier days , you vastly overestimate the number of giants and how big mountain ranges are . 
  if we compare modern mining , which is infinetely more efficient than picking a rock and throwing it , we havent even made a noticable dent . 
  compared to a mountain range its an absolute speck .

  i am bad at this . 
  baptising and caring for the incesteous spawn of the man that stole your one true love . 
  ultimate friendzone achieved ? 
  do you know what relative velocity is ? 
  belief ? 
  hey why seasons happen ? 
  you can read some basic math , buy a basic telescope and do first hand research yourself . 
  a greek proved the earth was a globe ( and calculated its size with surprising accurancy btw ) with a bunch of sticks and a couple of friends thousands of years ago . 
  science has nothing to do with belief . 
  it was [ eratosthenes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eratosthenes?wprov=sfla1 ) not pythagoras . 
  the speed of the sun or the galaxy have nothing to do with earth 's circumference . 
  you said it was pythagoras that did the experiment no ? 
  i simply corrected you . 
  everyone is missing the fact that the eagles came to mordor for the battle because if they died they died . 
  if they went to mordor carrying the ringbearer and died ... sauron gets the ring . 
  this `` supposed '' plot hole is directly adressed and its the whole friggin point why gandalf supported the idea of hobbits carrying the ring . 
  because noone would notice them , they are great at hiding and sauron thought unthinkable that gandalf or aragorn will not use the ring and instead put the fate of all middle earth to the hands of essentially two peasamts from friggin nowhere . 
  it not a plot whole . 
  the whole point of the hobbit being in the book was that no force in the world could enter mordor without being detected by saurons armies , and it was unthinkable that the great powers of good in middle earth would trust the one ring of power to a random villager . 
  there is the tiny detail of nine ringwraiths riding frigging huge fellbeasts . 
  that is an * additional * reason . 
  kind difficult to plan when you dont know if your ride to your objective is going to even show up . 
  noone counted on them appearing in the battle of the black gate for example , everyone expected to die , both aragorn and co. and the two hobbits in mordor . 
  you mean the arrow that got shot by a friggin elf prince and probably only injured it ? 
  and they only needed either the ringbearer to fall off and game over . 
  tell me again how a hobbit would hold on to an eagle that is fighting 9 ringwreaths and their fellbeasts . 
  and we dont even count the possibility of sauron himself coming out and joining the fight because they airdelivered the ring right in his front porch . 
  but lets say they avoid the black gate archers , the ringwreaths with their beasts and maybe even the big bad dude himself . 
  now the whole of mordor knows where they are and where they heading . 
  they reach mount doom and now thousands of orcs are all around it . 
  do they land ? 
  do they drop it from hundrends of meters and hope it falls where it should instead of the middle of the orcs ? 
  you do realise there are thousands of lookouts around mordor right ? 
  heck they had a full orc outpost guarding ungoliad 's passage , even if it was basically inpregnable already unless you had a magic starbottle and the demigod spider monster ( because you are a hobbit instead of a human or and elf ) underestimated and toyed with you , * and * its entrance was guarded by mordors biggest power base after barad-dur . 
  i am sure other places would be lax or not even scanning the air , despite being fully aware of the eagles existance , that at the latest they had appeared oh mere decades before in the battle of the five armies wrecking big s 's plans . 
  because sauron , a veritable immortal spirit , that brought down numenor just with his wits , and outwitted and corrupted the white wizard and the dunendain steward of gondor remotely would never think of them and prepare . 
  by the way gongrats for trying to sneak in using the cover of darkness , past the borders of a country that is populated by creatures that either live in the dark or are almost * made * of it . 
  i am sure they will be in a disanvatage . 
  oh and you have to fly above armies of them , in an empty plane , for hours , in a * giant freaking eagle * that they know its not a random bird but works for the forces of good . 
  assuming you even got there , past the patroling wreaths or the spy birds of saruman everywhere * before * you even reach the borders . 
  and if you are seen even once , game over for the world . 
  good luck . 
  get spotted by orcs or sarumans spy birds that are all over the place , wraiths ( or even sauron himself ) head straight for you , gg , game over . 
  the whole freaking point of the books was that sauron was prepared for * everything * to come at him except for two peasants from nowhere , middle earth simply walking the whole way and dropping it . 
  apparently . 
  ignoring the fact that the eagles had already aided the forces of good in the battle of the five armies , so we are 100 % sure he was aware of their existance . 
  you provided a more thorough answer than many many mason websites and faqs failed to provide !, 
  thanks !, 
  i bet the mason hit squad is already enroute to your location . 
  ah yes we have reached the point where you run out of arguments and fall back to the old `` mmm ugh . . because i say so ! '' . 
  i will just comment on this :, 
   they crawled the ring up to the volcano, 
  yes . 
  because they went in from a secret passage by foot and hidden with elven cloaks , and not riding an eagle the size of a fucking chessna . 
  and they still got caught . 
  * twice * . 
  please keep going with your , as they are known in literary circles , ass-pulls . 
  eagles are multibillion , high attitude stealth bombers . 
  orcs are blind . 
  an archdevil of deceit and corruption that brought down the greatest empire of man using justs his words and oumaneuverd even the white council is dumb as bricks . 
  the wreaths that ignored everyone ( including the heir to gondor ) and beehived for the ringbearer in amon sul would just dont give a fuck anymore and waste their time fighting eagles . 
  did i miss something ?
