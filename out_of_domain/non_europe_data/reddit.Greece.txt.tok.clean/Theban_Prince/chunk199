  its way better than those countries . 
  even if you only count simply its location . 
  us bombed japan for three reasons . 
  one , to make it capitulate fast and only to the us , and avoid a split germany situation with the soviets . 
  two , to test the new weapons on live targets . 
  three and lesser of the reasons , to speed up the capitulation process that was already brewing and minimize the possibility of invading . 
  and i say lesser because the war was over for japan and in all probability they would peaced out anyways . 
  there were no fleets . 
  there was no airforce . 
  industry was gone . 
  factions of the imperial army were already forming to save what they could as long as the emperor and some national dignity was preserved ( as it happened ) . 
  none of those reasons validate incinarating two entire cities of civilians . 
  and truth be told the us and the american public didnt go to war fir the rape of nanking . 
  neither for the japanese interment camps or the pleasure houses , or the slavery or the experiments . 
  they got dragged to the war screaming and kicking by pearl harbor . 
  heck if fdr wasnt on the wheel the trade empargo that incited the japanede , would probably not have been in place , and part of the reason for its existance wasnt any humanitarian reasons anyways , but trying to stop the japanene from interfering and spreading to what us though its own expanding sphere of influence , the pacific and its islands . 
  but forming you own mini donut to break the big one kinda defeats the purpose . 
  you either blob or you dont . 
  you take that back !, 
  below the asteroid chevis , below the asteroids . 
  i mean , i am only saying that that was their plan fron the start , go in guns blazing , but without any end goal in sight except `` lets trash fcon lol '' . 
  the the normal null meta of the last 10 years took over and now that they are staring the end of the gun barrel they are changing their tune , which i find hypocritical . 
  or both . 
  this will only lead to further blue standings and huge coalitions wity big space to rotate . 
  we dont need to turn off the isk faucet , we need to make the isk faucet bigger for the small to lmedium entities whil making the process of building megacoalition more costly . 
  right now the three power blocks are simply too huge , they habe won eve . 
  there has to be a change that unbalances those while allowing smaller entities to grow enough to challenge them . 
  none of those . 
  rearead what i wrote . 
  i didnt said its going to be easy to balance it so only smaller entities can take advantage . 
  another way to balance would be to implement `` natural disasters '' . 
  most real life empire fell to plagues , accidents , earthquakes , volcanoes or other `` natural phenomena '' than simply war . 
  maybe the more you rat/mine a regio the bigger the chances are to spawn a rare incursion in supersteroids that attacks even structures . 
  and has measly drops or bounties . 
  question . 
  you assume that your children will want to do sonething that their genetic make up will hinder them . 
  who says that they will not want to do something that they * have * the capabilities ? 
  chances are this is going to be the case , not everyone of wants to become a pilot or a doctor . 
  most importantly though , from those that want , few succeed , * even without any genetic defects . 
  * as a matter of fact , dissapointment and failure is part of life , so your children , adopted or not , will have to learn ( with your help ) to deal with it anyways . 
  as a person that tries to be centrist , he says nonsense . 
  extremism in all its forms leads to the same effects , but there are varying degrees of those as well . 
  no nazi ideology is not equivelent with `` sjw '' automatically . 
  unless we wre talking about militant feminism that considers males of any kind ( even homosexuals/trans etc ) dangerous and in need to be contained in any meand necessary , say , sterilisation . 
  true , its a fringe theory with minimal if any political footprint . 
  i just wanted to give an example of extremism in gender issues as a centrist apart from the `` sjw are losers '' nonsense the guy posted . 
  because they were irrelevant at this point . 
  what worse way to be shunned than as a military power being tough to crack , but also worthless . 
  you habe to judge each case individualy and in context , and further reevaluate of the need arises . 
  extremists usually claim '' all x are bad '' . 
  not doing that is kinda the point as a centrist . 
  yeah but it was kinda the `` godfather '' type of `` offer '' . 
  the cities states of the south were technically allies , but if they broke off alexander had the tendency to burn them to the ground ( see thebes ) . 
  sparta was ignored because they might put up a fight , but not really worth the effort , particularly as they had regressed a lot back to their isolating ways and would not have interfered while he was campaigning , in contrast to thebes and athens . 
  right after the og wolfstein and most importantly doom was released , games with similar gameplay mechanics flooded the market and were called `` doom-clones '' by the press of the time . 
  we today know them as fpshooters . 
  they still use most of the core elements introduced by id software . 
  same story with westwood and dune 2 that created/codified the rts genre or ultima online * with mmorpgs , simcity with city simulators etc. 
  the problem is not games that use the same core mechanics , its the bad copy-paster derivatives . 
  ** did you know that eve is essentially ultima online in space ? 
  and thats one of the reasons the rts genre is almost dead . 
  its a cheap way for the to limit ratting income in the game .

  ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/quill18 ), 
  umm is there any news about the patch that is going to fix the lag and stuttering issue?the paradox technical support has a lot of threads about it , and since i have pre purchased the game i was n't able to properly play . . 
  what title says.when i first start a game , i have to actually go to medium speed because i ca n't keep up with everything.but as decades pass , the game slows to crawl , and after a century it gets so slow that the fastest speed feels like medium.i think its all those courtiers everywhere , and i have heard you can change the limit on how many they can be in every court , but for the love of frey i cant find the code line anywhere.other suggestions would be nice also . 
  inb4 trees yes i have switched them off . 
  is it possible with sufficient technology to create an scenario like the matrix?how big could someone do it , using the kardashev scale to measure energy/technology levels ? . a city , like in the movie?a planet ? 
  a completely different universe ? 
  please be aware for a curious bug when using fixt in fallout 1 . 
  tycho the ranger , who you can recruit in the bar of junktown will become hostile when you attack the skullz gang in the back of the hotel.this is because the mod makes sherry , the girl guarding their door , a citizen of the city , and tycho now becomes hostile if you attack citizens of junktown . 
  the workaround i used was to take the gang down with the peaceful resolution ( speech check to convince sherry to leave the gang , wait 1 day for her to leave the door , convince her to testify against them , go to lars at the entrance of the city , quest complete ) . i have n't tried killing them without recruiting tycho first so if anyone tries that , please post a response . 
  but i think the guards also become hostile if you attack her . 
  i have an issue with story progression . 
  when the player ( s ) go to a dungeon and clean it , find the plot coupon/kill the big bad , what do you do then ?
