  the official greek translation did call her that ... 
  all this time he was the alter ego of regis ... 
  i really really hope no one close to you dies from lung cancer due to fossil fuel residue in the air.that 's uglier i think . 
  you should play the official video game then.she does the whole `` kiss me like you love me '' stunt ... with the black female captain of the `` logos '' . in real video . . 
  black light on the other hand ... 
  security reasons aside , why the fuck someone would want to know what people look up in the internet unless they start lag in their job?company material and such , is n't still aa violation of privacy?if i use an old fashioned company mail folder to send a personal letter they are entitled to open it?what about company phones?can they record all my calls for review ? 
  yeah.because pollutants really show up in the naked eye.especially when they are in your food and water . 
   when you are on company equipment , there should be no expectation of privacy . 
  nope.company policies should not override basic human rights.what if a company decides to do full body checks because you are in the company premises?or check your accounts because you could be wasting your wages ( aka company resources ) on questionable things?these step on other rights , but privacy is underestimated . 
  so the cause justifies the means?and for one ( possible ) bad seed you spy and tell all the employees of the company?also the female would sue about their demeanor ( laughing ) , not their personal data that they did not disclosed with her ( porn ) . 
   the us constitutional right, 
  i ai n't talking about the u.s. constitution.i am talking how it should be . 
  and again i ask you how the company and the man would be liable for sexual harassment / discrimination for personal data someone used in private.the lady could only sue if the males made a fuss of it , like laughing , joking or showing the photos all over the place . the sexuall harrasment is how they acted , not what they watched.not if a guy watched the naked breasts in his own computer . 
  and i am using porn as a crass example here.what about personal e-mails , or bank statements that might be forwarded to your company email.also sometimes the government requires the company address and might send you real life mail there.can you open them because the mail are in the company premises ? 
  yeah i would prefer to fuck a nuclear generator since they are the best crutch until we move on from fossil fuel.but since you think inanimate objects are fuckable , i can see how you can describe the wind turbines as `` ugly '' . are you more a cucumber guy i guess ? 
  and as i said , that doent matter becasue he is still a teenager.an immortal , sure , but still a teenager.did he somehow got the daily life experiences to date a hundend year old woman?i am 28 , i know a 13 year old girl , we will probably both live about the same decades , that makes it ok to have a relationship with her ? 
  exactly the same here ... still no fix . 
  no , because they are the major player.smaller banks ( like the greek ones ) will play through them.so they did n't make any new competitors , they just opened the safes off all the world banks for them to play on toxic investments . 
  i can speak of greece.the greek government 's of the 1990 's -2000 's collaborated with goldman sachs to swap debt so we can appear better financially , mainly so we can get in the euro.this was a direct result of the changes that this article describes . 
  come 2009 , this goes public from the greek prime minister of the same party that did the deal.que greek collapse when everybody discovers that we have a big debt.the greek prime minister publicly asks for help from the e.u. 
  and the imf , for the first time a first world economy to do so . 
  the e.u. 
  is forced to help because nobody knows what will happen if a euro member defaults , but because everyone ~ ~ thinks ~ ~ rages that greeks are some lazy stealing pigs , they decide to impose harsh austerity measures to chastise them.this backfires since a great deal of greece 's economy was based on the public sector and services , shrinking the economy further and multiplying the debt tenfold , while the e.u. 
  pumps northern countries money to support the failing greek banks , that had also participated in the original scum . 
  greeks are derided all over the world while everything crumbles all over them , and have no escape , because they can vote either a ) the same ( e.u. 
  backed ) party that did all this and is still in power `` saving '' the country or b ) some leftist idiots who want to somehow ` default ' without ` defaulting ' . my country is done . 
  i am sorry but no.you forget that the rampant corruption peaked after goldman sachs and some greek politicians * exchanged debt so greece could get more money from bonds and get in the euro.when that scam was outed , the e.u. 
  asked the imf to propose austerity measures for financial support to chastise the `` lazy '' `` corrupt '' greeks.the same imf that this memo proves had direct contacts with goldman sachs , and pushed for laws that allowed the scam in the first place.the imf that proposes measures that further contract the public sector and service economy.but no , i think it was self inflicted too . 
  * those are the exact same politicians that are now in power and backed by the e.u. 
  and i.m.f. 
  as those that will bring the boat around.and they were actually accused of taking money from american and german companies . 
  read my comment right below.greece was not an ` innocent victim ' but hardly the main perpetrator . 
  most armies have the penalty of death for deserters.that shows how much these people want to get away from war and take their chances with the death squad . 
  athenians in syracuse comes to mind.thousands of soldiers just massacred . 
  low morale in this situation is a running/disorganized completely army , not an army attacking en masse without tactics . 
  you can edit the decisions file in the game folder.i have uninstalled the game , so i ca n't type the new code.but i guess it has some conditions like : has title e_byz ( you are byzantium ) , is orthodox.you can change these and the results.its pretty easy to read and change the code.but from the game itself no , its not possible . 
  i like you . 
  plus you know , so many genres , so many different cinematic era 's , it pretty idiotic to have * a * favorite movie of all time . 
  its the same like shooting saddam in his hole or hanging him later.it has to be official . 
  yes that would be better and from a coding view.but i tried to make it as simple as possible , essentially he could just comment the religion/culture/title prerequisites and open up the decision for everyone who holds the holy sites and be done with it.it is gamey , unrealistic and possibly broken , but its is the simplest work around . 
  the 9/11 . no no that bullshit about explosives , drones , empty planes cruise missiles or all the other bollocks.but that the u.s. government neglected to account for such a danger , and when it happened they simple thought `` ok how do we take this clusterfuck and make money out of it ? 
  '' . cue middle east oil invasions . 
  because all the revolutions in history started when the population was well fed and healthy ... 
  and thats a philosophical debate about why we 'll never meet aliens : either they would be so far behind in technology that we will not be able to detect them ( no radio signals for example ) , or so far ahead that they will not give a fuck about us ( energy beings in the fabric of the universe ) . or extinct . 
  umm does a desktop with 4 cores at 2.5 ghz ( preferred requirements according to paradox ) , 1gb gpu and 4gb ram that can play fps at high , ca n't handle euiv?tech support has confirmed that the problem its not on my end plus the top post in tech support is about this lag , and from people with way , way better machines than mine ... 
  not iron man mode , autosaves are finally super fast . 
  i have n't tried iron man so far , but from comments its seems autosave is kinda excessive . . 
   the memory for the gpu size is really irrelevant , what matters most is what kind of gpu . 
  i see in the tech support almost all complaints come from people with really outdated graphics cards . 
  umm is a card outdated after 2-3 years?again for a strategy title with barely enough graphics ... 
   also , i think that if you get month to month stutters in ironman , you can solve it by getting an ssd drive and installing the game on that . 
  i have a laptop with a hybrid drive and that seems to work pretty well for a cheaper price than a full ssd . 
  autosaves and savesare way faster than the previous pi titles.also requiring to buy new stuff to play a game without previous notice is kinda a sham anyways . 
   really , paradox requirements are set really low expecting someone to play on slow speed . 
  you really need a fast all around computer ( cpu/gpu/hd ) to get games like eu , vic , and hoi to run fast . 
  2.5 ghz is actually not going to cut it to get fast speeds . 
  you have to realize that there are so many calculations going on that there 's probably not much they can really do to speed things up except neuter the game to have less calculations . 
  you are confused and you do n't want to admit that there is a problem.crusader kings eventually starts to run ( relatively ) slow , but because of the tons of characters.understandable.but for euiv i am not talking about slow speeds , i am talking about stuttering , lag and freezes.and if you reread the threads , there are people with way better cpu power and gpus that have the exact same problem.they even made videos about it.plus i add again that tech support confirmed i should not have those issues with my specs.what more you need to agree its a optimization problem ? 
   i also notice most people with lag have 4gb of ram . 
  i do n't have a system with less than 8gb , so i can not test the game on 4gb of ram . 
  it is possible that ram is a lot more important in eu 4 than it has been for other paradox games in the past . 
  even if that is the case , then the company is at fault , because the game is unplayable ( 7-10 fps sometimes ) without upgrading , without paradox providing proper requirements . 
   you have it backwards . 
  ck ii has way less calculations . 
  on my computers it never gets slow . 
  i blaze through that game from beginning to end , even on my oldest desktop i had when the game first came out . 
  people get used to that game and it is a lite version of most other paradox games . 
  good for you but irrelevant.from gpu perspective , they dont have that much difference, 
   and yes , a card is outdated in 2-3 years , but if you had bought the top of the line 2-3 years ago , you would be more than fine . 
  the thing is , you can get a card today for $ 200 that would be very powerful . 
  like i said though , this game requires an all around good computer , unlike and fps that mostly just needs a fast video card and as long as the cpu does n't bottleneck it , you are good to go ... play the game at a slower pace since you do have an older computer by modern standards , which do move scarily fast . 
  it was top of the line 2 years ago.its still pretty good so far , playing aaa titles all round from rts to fps and mmos from medium to high.i have tried open world games that require both gpu power and cpu power and played them flawesly.you have to understand , i am not some 14 year old with a 2003 pc whining i ca n't get everything on high and play flawlessly.i have tried crusader kings , victoria 2 and hearts of iron with varying results , but no way as close to euiv , a game * that * code wise does not have that many changes from eu3.the game does not play even with everything low from settings.ini , even options normally unavailable from in game.i repeat myself but you tend to ignore me , the two highest threads in tech support are about this [ exact issue and from machines better than mine . 
  ] ( http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?812-euiv-technical-support&amp;sort=replycount&amp;order=desc ) and ** tech support agreed with me ** . so you are defending the company when the company itself did acknowledged the issue.lets ignore my machine.can you explain to me how people with brand new pcs stutter?do they have `` so-so '' hardware?or do they have to clean * gasp * viruses ? 
  and i quote from the tech guy `` they have explicitly said there will be a fix for the stutter . '', 
  can you get down of your high horse now please ? 
   the devs have never said we are going to release an magical patch that removes lag, 
  `` they have explicitly said there will be a fix for the stutter . '', 
  tech support , paradox official forum 24/8/2013, 
  i have gave you direct statements from the company that here is an issue.you are going against the company 's word here.you are talking about an issue you do n't know , in a thread that in the end does not concern you , and top of that you behave as a patronizing douche . 
  [ ** shoo ** ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/993ea1521573e26ace3c0acf22529faf/tumblr_mmx7rynqul1rzc0ato1_500.gif ), 
  yeah but the issue is not about ironman autosaves.i somehow disabled every nation in the map ( it is just the terrain ) the lowest graphics possible.and yet he game stutters when scrolling . 
   construction methods ( see earthquakes ) . 
  not only that.its also about not building higher than acropolis.washington d.c. has the same laws . 
  it has no difference whatever map mode i use , so i have the suspicion is a cpu issue.yeah gpu drivers where the first to be updated.however it seems eu4 has issues with some amd cards . 
  i will . 
  i do n't expect 60 fps.however i somehow while tweaking the game i broke it , and nations showed upjust the terrain , meaning no slow down from unit moves end of month calcs etc. 
  fps according to fraps stable at 60 . stutter?still there . 
  so `` make love '' fixes not only war but plague also.interesting.on one part , creating social groups ( families , nations ) gives us the advantage of security in numbers and more efficient production means among others.on the other hand , not forming thosem gives us the advantage of less deaths from fighting and plague resistance . . 
  you would actually see the past only from after you started traveling . 
  * cough * ansible * cough *, 
  i am not an expert by any means , but there was a thread the other day in ask science `` what would happen if you placed a mirror in 1 au from earth and looked it with a telescope '' . the consensus from the science guys is that if you somehow managed that ( which is kinda impossible anyways ) you would see 1 year in the past , but after the mirror was launched from earth and positioned , because the images before launch are already traveling in the speed of light.so you cant out run them with the mirror and take a picture of the time before your launch.unless you teleport the mirror instantly , but now we venture into sc-fi . did i explained it somehow ? 
  actually it is pretty clear , and the story just adds up various bits so it confuses you to create a funny story.in reality even i who am not a lawyer can discern that . 
  the cause of death was accidental discharge of the shotgun handled recklessly.so the father would be charged for [ constructive manslaughter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manslaughter#involuntary_manslaughter ) and for [ reckless endangerment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reckless_endangerment ) against the mother regardless who loaded the weapon ( its a possible leathal tool after all ) . 
  finally if the son somehow survived from the fall and the shotgun , he would be charged for [ attempted murder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attempted_murder ) of his mother . 
  end of story . 
  * i am hilarious at social gatherings . 
  i am sorry i confused the distance unit . i think he used `` 1ly `` in his thread and i got it somehow mixed with au when typing . 
  light speed is a universal constant.telescopes ( or something equivalent ) are a technology that still advances.both are impossible , but in the sci fi scale the ultra awesome telescope is more plausible :d, 
  i think you are correct.also the images would be red shifted because of a kinda-like-doppler-effect in the light spectrum ( always according to the guys in / r/askscience ), 
  experimental trials :1,
