  [ greco-turkish war \\ ( 1919 -- 22 \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_\\ ( 1919-1922 \\ ) ), 
  i do n't understand what you are trying to say.the article explains that megali idea was a concept that the modern greek state should encompass all the former byzantine areas , at least where greeks still lived , as a successor state to the empire . 
  indeed , by some few , the fact that the then [ king constantine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantine_i_of_greece ) had the same name [ as the last byzantine emperor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantine_xi_palaiologos ) was a divine sign of the rebirth of the empire . 
  by this concept the greek state went to war at least 3 times with the ottoman empire ** trying ** , as i ( originally ) said , to accomplish this . 
  if they have succeeded would they have renamed the nation `` byzantine empire '' ? i hardly think so . 
  but a `` king/emperor of greeks '' as a new title for the monarchs is highly likely , so op is pretty good on that . 
  and you are true to think that.the formal title of the king was `` king of the hellenes '' , king of the greeks.it is not far fetched to be named emperor of greeks . 
  thats [ interplay ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interplay_entertainment ) , the original publisher . 
  this is awesome !, 
  wait ... . 
  edit : yeah while they are cucumbers , they are not the same variety as the normal cucumbers . 
  hey aussie , newsflash : in some countries ** 0 people ** die from sharks or spiders or jellyfish from hell . 
  so you are again 100 % more deadly than a lot of places in this planet . 
  the movie was boring.tangled had more humor , more likable characters and better executed ( cliche ) plot.the one was about a fantasy princess that was kidnapped , mentally abused and with the help of a likable rogue and a funny horse tries to get free.the other was about a lady that wants to open a restaurant . 
  i agree with all your points . 
  i was ( slightly ) trolling.i am happy that my incendiary comment created such a well put response and thank for your time . 
  is there a god ? 
  i mean seriously if that question ever gets definitely answered we are fucked either way . 
   almost like someone who robs a bank to go to jail and get free health care . 
  i do n't think jail is as chilly as you think it is , even with free health care . 
  finally !, 
  he just needs to filter/block the words half life from mail.that would leave him about 10 mails to read . 
  oh great gaben , why have you shunned us ? 
  and i just got the star wars bundle ... goddammit !, 
  steam servers report, 
  he uses lubricant . 
  however there have been so many scenarios explored in scifi and real science that * someone * is going to get it right . 
  my great corp leader has a dark secret that he has shared with only his most trusted officers : he did n't discover the `` warp '' function until his second day playing ... ... ... ... 
  i a/was playing eve since 2006 . 
  i can hardly claim i * truly * know 50 % of the game . 
   if we 're talking scifi then no ,, 
  there is scifi that depicts ai armies , greys , intelligent spiders , scorpions , , lifeforms based on silicon , gas , embedded to fabic of the spacetime conitnuum , alien civilizations that are so much the same with us that we start questioning our origins , and thousands upon thousands of other examples in comics , movies , games , ads , books , or short poems , and some of them * even * depict `` incomprehensible '' energy beings . they give an example on our interactions with them with varying degrees of plausibility . 
  and you forget that the half part of scifi means `` science '' , there where fictitious aliens out there that are based in some hard science . 
   anything else is pure speculation . 
  but speculation based on some hard cold facts , because unless we discuss beings completely outside our reality ( and we are not talking about aliens then ) they will have to follow the same rules of the universe a cockroach on earth follows : entropy , gravity , evolution etc etc. 
  you will be surprised how much information about the possible appearance of something you can estimate from that . 
  its the same way we can get a pretty accurate picture of a prehistoric monkey just by finding half its jawbone . 
   yet still ... that really , really does n't work for this argument because we have our entire world 's evolutionary line to probe through and we know how it worked . 
  that is not the case for anything alien . 
  and there is what you are getting wrong.you think that our evolution is something unique when it is not . 
  the universe has uniform rules.most planetary systems will be similar with ours . 
  they will be probably from a terrestrial like planet for example , because any other type of planet makes it extremely hard to create life , and yet harder multicellular organisms . 
  so that narrows down the choices of self locomotion.they will either crawl , walk or fly.they will need a way to communicate , they will need a way to `` feed '' and reproduce . 
  there are numerous different ways these things are achieved by living organisms here on our earth , but all of them have to follow the same basic principles.the same applies for any organism that will evolve in other planetes . 
  how is that incomprehensible ? 
  how ** can ** be incomprehensible ? 
  will aliens be like humans , only with green skin?the chances of that are astronomically low . 
  will they be something that when we see them we will understand a lot about them instantly ? 
  yes , yes it is . 
  our logic and imaginations are infinite , and scifi has used them to spin numerous stories of `` what if '' . 
  for some further reading i point you to [ this wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convergent_evolution ) . 
  it about organisms that are wildly different species yet look exactly the same . 
  its already happening in earth . 
   there is no credible scientific evidence, 
  its not the same as saying `` its wrong '' for science.it means not sufficient research was done on the subject , or no evidence has surfaced * at this time * . 
  while it is improbable , it not impossible yet and no serious scientist would support it yet , especially in such a serious matter as safety . 
  just to make you feel better , most of the times there is a legal issue behind.either the owners cant renovate due to property laws , or someone passed away without clearing up who gets it/there are multiple descendants and they cant use it.i have at least 2 houses and 2 properties in my family that it is like this . 
  or the owner died without an issue : /, 
   make people finally rise up out of anger . 
  you realize that even at your independence war there was a lot of people that did n't rise/actively fought against it.and even the rebels took a lot of shit until they decided to declare independence from a government they did n't choose?now apply that to a situation that half the population thinks it would be a terrorist/rebellion insurgency against an elected government , not a freedom movement . 
  it wont be 1775 , it will be uganda/ukraine/syria . 
   thanks to modern media , that could very well be the case if the rebels were unable to fight on the media front as well . 
  there a numerous examples of propaganda machines existing in both sides of the war , but it can get you that far before it become simply a self sustaining bullshit machine.in cases like this media tend to kick neutrality out of the window and become a joke even amongst their supporters . 
   truth is that most uprisings will fail , and the ones that are successful often make things worse than they were before . 
  we just want the chance to fight back should the need ever arise . 
  many of us favor the wild west way of thinking that we 'd rather die with our boots on . 
  the even worse truth is that of the few rebellions that succeed , they succeed with outside interference , like military support from another nation , and usually not for the good of their heart.so they will die with their boots on , ultimately for another country 's benefit . 
  americans tend to forget that the us independence war was a unique happy exception on a sea of rebellions that turned sour . 
  maybe if france did n't get so weak after they helped , you would all speak french now . 
  i think both the french & indian war ( part of the much [ broader seven years ' war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_years%27_war ) ) and the subsequent american war on independence played a large role in weakening the french empire . 
  being playing orbiter for years darling . 
  but is n't that a futile situation anyways?if you get mugged , the bad guy either does n't have a firearm , so there is no need to get yours , or he has and you are already at gunpoint and unable/dangerous to draw.in both situations you having a firearm leads to further escalation into a firefight that might claim other lives ( what if you shoot , kill the mugger and accidentally shoot a bystander ? ), 
   it can de-escalate the situation . 
  but would n't that cause an arm race?muggers are going to try and do their job anyways.if they know that there is a possibility of a conceal arm , would they just make sure they got a gun themselves or if they are n't able to procure one just knife first ask later just to be safe ? 
  by that you mean areas like schools where they will have the most psychological impact/media attention ? 
   a walmart or shopping mall ? 
  yes they will . 
  any target that has groups of innocent bystanders.btu what place it is guaranteed to be packed with innocents with little of none protection , minimum exits , maximum sentimental impact and they are in vogue with the media?schools . 
  what stops them from buying illegal.they are already felons . 
   there wo n't be another mass shooting . 
  but are n't those that doing those mass shooting already giving up their lives?even in gun free areas they are not safe from getting killed by the police during the confrontation , or at best spent their remaining years behind bars . 
  they are determined to do it and they do n't care for the consequences , they are fucking sociopaths . 
  they have no fear at all , so why they should fear concealed arms.the best case scenario is at the next mass shootings they are killed fast by a concealed arm . 
  then they will simply choose an easier target next time . 
  in a public swimming pool for example you wont be able to carry anything and be sitting target . 
  a lightning rod or a camera ? 
   and you 're right ... 
  they may just look for other , softer targets ... but so ? 
  is that a reason not to try to harden schools and other potential targets ? 
  yes because you are n't trying to fix the problem at its root , you just try to patch the holes after the deed is done , and with a questionable tactic ( what if one of the armed bystanders misinterpret a situation and starts firing without real reason?what about proper training?what happens if the attacker kill two people and the `` savior '' accidentally kills three ? 
  to me the root of the evil is the media . 
  when a mass shooting happens , the attacker becomes a superstar as the media goes berserk bringing his life , name and `` beliefs ' at the forefront for months . 
  its [ herostratus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herostratus ) syndrome all over . 
  they do n't care how many they kill or if they survive , if the get their 15 mins of spotlight . 
  great example [ the guy in norway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_norway_attacks ) that copied the us mass shooting style to propagate his neo nazi ideas . 
  its all a twisted , bloody version of a reality program whre the contestant with the most body count get the prize . 
  and concealed arms are n't going to stop crazy persons , because , well they are crazy . 
  i think you should prioritize laws where the names and stories of these people are forbidden to get broadcasted , ans get funds on psychological support and evaluation of troubled persons and less about guns that simply act as a blanket to keep you safe from monsters . 
  chances are it is a dome camera base [ like this ] ( http://www.yjdcase.com/userfiles/2013-04-08/201304080845441.jpg ), 
  i think you mean ram ?
