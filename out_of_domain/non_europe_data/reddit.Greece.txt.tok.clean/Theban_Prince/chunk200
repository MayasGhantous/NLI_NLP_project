  do you role play the return to the exit through the empty , monsterless , trapless corridors?add some random encounters to spice things up , but with danger to annoy the players who are exhausted/want to spent their new found shinnies as fast as possible?or do you end it fast with the mood killer `` and after you kill the bad magician , you take some hours to climb out '' ? 
  it is weird that so far i have n't seen anything how to address this problem in any dm guide , post or discussion.my solution for my present game is that the plot coupon is used for inter planar travel/gate opening/teleporting , so when the players touched it , they got teleported out ( and about 100 miles away ) and the magic collapsed the whole dungeon . 
  of course that is n't an issue with typical ` dungeon ' , but any area that exist only to progress the story , and it is no longer needed after it had concluded its purpose . 
  post your criticizing gifs bellow . 
  let the gifs describe your reviews !, 
  after earth.or how we watched will smith 's son explore a boring forest , get attacked by monkeys , an eagle with personal space issues and finally kill a mentally challenged monster .

  i came up with an idea for a curse that uses meta information aka the `` deadpool '' curse . 
  it can be a curse bestowed by an extremely powerful item , and causes the victim to be aware that he is a tabletop character . 
  he can understand the cliches , he can be genre savvy , he can even understand what roll someone had `` oh the orc rolled 1 , that 's a miss '' , `` the lizardman is cr 1/2 we can take him guys '' . 
  the curse part comes that nobody will ever believe him , and he either shuts up but lives with the knowledge that his reality , his friends , enemies , gods is simply a construct and a slave of a random dm , or his tries to inform everyone and he gets locked up as a crazy dude . 
  edit : using `` deadpool '' kinda gave the wrong context . 
  i am thinking something along a lovecraft kind of curse , not `` poke the fun at rules '' comedy . 
  i would love to hear our opinion . 
  king horik tried to pull a red wedding to earl lodbrok , except it backfired spectacularly.from what i have seen , king ragnarr combines the savagery of khal drogo with the cunning of tywin , and he is as honorable as a stark to his allies , and for that he enjoys tremendous loyalty from them . 
  so if by some way ( magic?odin ? ), 
  we brought him in westeros , how ( not if ) he will get the throne ? 
  is nuclear warfare feasible at the present state of the game ? 
  does it feel like a major part of your overall strategy ? 
  what are the consequences of getting hit by a nuclear weapons , are they simply a gimmick , and you can lob warheads with impunity or they truly change the war aspect of the game ? 
  these and more need to be asked , because the mad scare was the core of the cold war in everything from technology to espionage and diplomacy . 
  if they did n't make it right then the game looses a lot of points right from the start . 
  so this is my first time i seriously play banished.i have a small village , all stocks are mostly full and then a major fire starts right in the middle of my densely packed house area.i will not comment on the stupidity of the ai ( ignoring 2 wells next to the fire and heading for the river 15 tiles further ) or the complete ineffectiveness of the water brigade , my major problem is that after the fire destroyed every house , i set the villagers to rebuild them ... annndd nothing . 
  every builder/laborer is idling , nobody is clearing the resources from the areas that need to get build and of course they have started dying . 
  what the hell happened?i have the necessary materials by the way . 
  to clarify , i am particurlaly refering the space marines because they have some individuals that survive from the time of the great crusade , even if they are encased/hibernate for centuries.how come a single comment from them akin to ` this imperial cult sure does like the one the emperor specifically forbade ' has n't surfaced so far ? 
  got a used ps3 . it plays almost all the older games and blu rays , and some newer games.other times i get that error . 
  i tried all the options for system restore inducing the safe mode one -  third option but no dice.any help ? 
  my fiance and me are planing on coming to sweden fro about 2 months , probably october-november . 
  we are fluent in english , but not swedish and we are both experienced hospitality employees . 
  our main reasons for leaving greece is that we are fed up with the state of affairs here , particularly the every day corruption both in public and in private , and to get better education eventually . 
  my main concerns are how easy is to find a room for short term rent , what is the state of the hospitality industry and what is the general disposition towards greeks ? 
  thank you !, 
  i cant seem to find the default menu screen ( the same as this subreddit 's header ) in the game files to replaces steklos one . 
  i know the default one is not really a single image , but i was wondering if someone can help me find it , and in the proper resolution for a 1680 * 1050 because no matter i resize it ( if i find a variation , usually with annoying adds ) , it stretches . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  hello !, 
  we are a young easy going couple from greece visiting belgium for 3 months minimum . 
  we are looking for a place to rent for short term , starting with 2 months , but possible for more as we are planning to move to belgium ( brussels ) permanently . 
  we are looking at a price range of 350-450 per month . 
  pleased to hear any suggestions or offers , on this post or with pm . 
  you will not be disappointed !, 
  my understanding is that since the end of world war 2 , no massive scale wars between superpowers have fought because the mutual destruction possibility , the scenario that if someone launches nuclear weapons the other nuclear owning powers will follow suit with immense destruction for everybody . 
  many have proposed that this is a plus side of nuclear weapons , that fear of destruction have averted the mas casualties from the previous wars . 
  however my opinion is that on the long run , that will hurt the human race immensely , and if we could change history i would prefer nuclear weapons never existed . 
  my main points are :, 
  - ** `` proxy wars are more destructive than we think '' ** :, 
  the cold war have shown that superpowers will still fight for dominance , but in a more covert way.instead of massive head-on wars like ww1 and ww2 we had coups and proxy wars , where the super powers would fight ( or covertly support ) under the pretext of helping , one side of the other , usually leading in civil wars . 
  while individually the number of casualties are n't compared with total war , those clashes in asia , africa and europe took a lot more time ( sometimes decades ) to subside , created permanent bad blood in some countries that could spur new clashes all the time ( spilling more blood ) and atrocities where commonplace due to the inherent nature of civil war . 
  - ** `` modern warfare is less destructive than world war standards '' : **, 
  following the previous statement , i would like to point out that destruction of property and loss of life is greater in these proxy wars than if we had two modern superpowers fighting each other openly . 
  as napoleonic tactics where obsolete by ww1 , so the 20th century tactics of mass conscription , carpet bombing and total war are obsolete now . 
  most modern armies are based on surgical strikes on tactical and strategic targets crippling the enemy the opening days of a war , by air force or special trained teams and the rest of the army is usually used for establishing control of the conquered area . 
  i believe that civilian centers would be spared compared to ww2 , so a conventional ww3 would be less destructive than the ongoing proxy wars . 
  for example , from a cynical view , if russia could pull all its might against ukraine instead of using `` concerned citizens '' , the war would be over by now , with much less loss of life and property . 
  - ** `` a nuclear war will be always possible . 
  finally my major concern is that a global nuclear war is never out of the question , and the results of one would make a conventional one look like a tea party . 
  we cant guarantee that the political situation for the following years or decades will be the same as the previous . 
  the stalemate of the official borders right now while people and cultures are ever changing and moving can create suppressed situations that might erupt . 
  a mad man might be elected president or the public may feel invincible by patriotic fervor causing a launch . 
  numerous times [ we have avoided a launch in the nick of time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_iii#historical_close_calls ) . 
  the destruction of a nuclear war would be on an unprecedented scale , and this time no country will be unaffected to rebuild . 
  after each clash in the previous centuries , some power or other would rise to fill the power void . 
  however , in this case , if the bombs start flying there are n't going to be an unaffected usa to rebuild europe , a safe south america and switzerland or a soviet union to push the technology race onwards . 
  we might even have an extinction event . 
  in conclusion , while in a personal level i would n't like my country or any other whatsoever to experience war again , in a macro level if i could do the impossible to dismantle all the nuclear weapons i would do it even if that spurred a world war . 
  ** between a conventional world war 3 and nuclear detente i would prefer the war , for the future of the human race as a whole .

  hello , i am using the mobile joomla plugin , everything works okay except any image sliders . 
  i have tried different , but while they work in desktop mode in mobile the module skin loads and it appears to work , but the photos simply do not appear . 
  if i use inspect element , the photos appear to load , but they do n't show in the screen . 
  i see a lot of support from the western world for the armenian genocide , particularly pressure towards turkey to recognize the atrocities . 
  and i heartily support that . 
  however greece is also claiming reparations due to atrocities , but everyone is against that . 
  i want some discussion and i would like to reply first to these points :, 
  `` greece is rekindling old grievances '' . 
  the armenian genocide happened in 1915 , the ww2 in 1940-45 . 
  `` armenia only asks for recognition '' there are [ multiple armenian organizations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_reparations#armenian_organizations_demanding_reparations ) that are requesting financial reparations from turkey . 
  `` germany was a different country/goverment '' so it was turkey , the successor state of the ottoman empire . 
  according to international law , [ the modern german state is in the same situation . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_reparations#grounds_in_international_law ), 
  `` greeks do it just for the money '' well yeah , but that does n't change the legal similarities . 
  i think the west , particularly europeans , support the one but condemn the other , because turkey is treated as an outsider , while germany is held in the greater standards , but also will create a precedent where europe has to acknowledge they are also at fault when it come to financial obligations ( which accuse greece ) .
