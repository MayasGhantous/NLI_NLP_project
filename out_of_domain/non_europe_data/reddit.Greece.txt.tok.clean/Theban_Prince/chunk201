  * happy cmving !, 
  today me and my fiance went to the aperos urbains opening day in parc cinquantenaire . 
  the experience was . . underwhelming , at best . 
  long lines to get in , long lines to get jetons for ( pricey ) drinks and then * another * line to get your drinks , and for nothing exceptional you could get outside the event in the parc . 
  i do n't know if the reason was because we went there early ( we where there from 18:30 to 20:00 ) . 
  the whole thing felt like a money grab and pointless . 
  how do long time residents feel about this event , and what point did we miss , if any ? 
  . . and the friendzone !, 
  that 'll do jorah , that 'll do . 
  i am not sure , but the dates much, 
  genre : action/advetnure, 
  estimated year of release : early 90 's ? 
  notable characters : the protagonist was a indiana jones clone ( hat and all ) . 
  there was a `` nemesis '' type of character he had to beat in a fistfight at the start of the game . 
  notable gameplay mechanics :, 
  i distinctly remember you started on a trade post . 
  when you get out of the store you had a fistfight with the nemesis character ( that i always lost ) . 
  i presume it was who will start first in the next segment . 
  afterwards you drove a jeep in the jungle , and you reached into an ancient maya/aztec temple . 
  there when you entered ( taking control of your character again ) there where big cycles in the floor you had to avoid . 
  if you touched them a big boulder killed you forcing you to start the whole game over ( back into the trading post ), 
  platform ( s ) : snes, 
  genre : jrpg, 
  estimated year of release : late 90s, 
  graphics/art style : typical 90s jrpg graphics , top down, 
  notable characters : the protagonist was a guy with spiky red hair a la anime ( its not chrono ), 
  notable gameplay mechanics : i distinctly remember there was a weird music organ/item ( edit : it was a [ bolang-gu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/bolang-gu-chinese-instrument.jpg ) ) where you called a flying creature . 
  it came whooshing from the screen and then the world map opened , where you could choose any city location to fast travel to . 
  this was a late save game from another player , so i am guessing that item was not available at the start.there was a desert area with antlion type enemies . 
  other details : its not chrono trigger . 
  for example :, 
  `` you are entering * spacemonkey 's alliance * area '' ( default part of the message ), 
  `` welcome to smas place ! '', 
  ( personal message from the alliance '' ), 
  imagine something like the wild west town signs or the infamous [ `` trespassers will be shot '' warning sign ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=trespassers+will+be+shot&biw=1680&bih=917&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=x&ved=0cjubepwfkafqfqotcidc9t3v9mccfcvtfaodihcbaw#imgrc=_puk1axuvfmlum%3a ) . 
  i think it adds a bit of character and customization into the systems you own , and makes sov a bit more personal without the need to add some major mechanics . 
  to avoid spam there can be a setting where you can get the message only once from dt to dt , or completely dismiss a particular one . 
  hello !, 
  i am trying to switch careers , and looking to get some proper , formal training , preferably in brussels , but i want to go to a * good * school or seminar , considering i am really tight in funds , and i prefer to spend them on something that will give me what i want and be at least recognizable in my cv . 
  i have been burned from `` online universities '' and such before and i do n't want to waste my time and funds . 
  i have some informal experience in the usual trio of html/css/jscript and i worked as an independent in a couple of small commercial websites ( [ example ] ( https://www.mygreek-villa.com/ ) ) . 
  however i pretty much jury rigged my present knowledge with various online course and tutorials so i want something that will give me the necessary skills to get in the professional side of the job . 
  also , if i have misunderstood or i am missing something please free to correct me . 
  thank you !, 
  i was very young and read a book about a child that hears a story ( from his grandma ? ), 
  that little devil looking things ( think fairies ) live in the middle of tornadoes . 
  the child uses a basket to catch one , that decides ( or is forced because he caught him ) to take him to the jungle , and there they see the secret fairy world or something ( at some point they go to a fairy meeting place and the little devil tell him to hide or the other fairies will kill him f they find him . 
  the book was in greek , but due to the subject it might have been a translation . 
  the book was children literature . 
  everyone character in teh book is a vegetable or a fruit ( in the pictures have human bodies with fruit heads ) . 
  the protagonist is a little onion that suffers from the oppression of the cherry king , who has a young son that is good at heart . 
  i remember a revolution of shorts from the people that have been oppressed , and they get help from the cherry prince . 
  it might also had a side story about a spider traveling towards something plot relevant and the dangers it experience from been so small . 
  read it in greek but might have been a translation . 
  seriously . 
  i get to watch xenuria 's mug every time i dock , there are a bunch of holograms already all over the external structure * including * one for a corp. ... only it is * upwells * for some reason , * and * we know it is possible to have corp/alliance logos in space because tcus have them . 
  hilariously the whole citadel thing stemmed from the will to give players more way to `` plant their flag '' . 
  what the hell designer team ? 
  i had some ideas about changing how wars work , but also how highsec corps operate in conjunction with that . 
  nothing very innovative , but most similar ideas i have seen have been posted randomly or standalones . 
  this will probably interfere or break pretty much every game style in highsec , but before getting the pitchforks out please try to see it from an impartial stance . 
  pointing exploitation holes and/or oversight is more than welcome , but `` breaking my very specific game style '' might not be that informative . 
  thanks !, 
  first order of business , the main `` currency '' used for the following would be lp with only one exception , the charter item . 
  this is mostly for lore reasons but also so actual activity in highsec is needed ( lp gained by missions ) . 
  the following changes should have minor effects in low and none at all in null . 
  if lp use has unforeseen consequences please suggest another type of `` currency '' . 
  ** split corp into two states , chartered and unchartered . 
  ** unchartered corps : **, 
  this is the initial state of each corp when it is created . 
  ** their tax rate is locked , and equal with npc corps *, 
  ** same with refining fees , broker fees etc. 
  ** they ca n't declare war or get wardecced . 
  ** they ca n't join alliances . 
  ** they ca n't anchor any structure . 
  ** corp standing gains pre mission for npc corps and factions is greatly reduced concerning mission agents availability . 
  ** i would suggest those to be increased to counteract the isk faucets that will be added by the chartered state . 
  perhaps something on the scale of 20-30 % ? 
  ** chartered corps **, 
  a corp will be considered a chartered corp by the acquisition and installation of a specific item that is sold with lp in the lp stores ( but being able to get transported and placed into the market for isk as well from players ) . 
  you will have to install this into a station or citadel that has corp offices in it , and that location will be considered the corp main hq . 
  corp main hq location description will change accordingly in the corp page and it wo n't be possible to change it by players anymore . 
  anyone can see if a corp is chartered or not . 
  corps cant revert to unchartered unless : all hq upgrades are down to 0 level everywhere ( see following section ) , there are no anchored structures , they have no active wars and they are no members of an alliance . 
  a change to unchartered can be both voluntary and involuntary after a time if all conditions are met . 
  a corp ca n't become chartered for a month after reverting . 
  ** chartered corps abilities include : **, 
  ** will have their tax rate unlocked , it can be set as high or low as they wish . 
  ** will be able to declare war and get wardecced in return . 
  ** will be able to deploy any structure .
