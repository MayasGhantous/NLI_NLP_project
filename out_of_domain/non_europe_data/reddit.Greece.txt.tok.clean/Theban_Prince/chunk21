  yup . 
  bram stoker 's books sounds about right . . 
  i vote for [ hyperion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperion_\\ ( mythology \\ ) ) , father / alternative name of the sun , or one of the [ heliades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heliades ) , daughters of the sun ( so if we find more stars that are from the same family like our star , we can use the whole family !, 
  true , as the first one it would be great to been named like that . 
  however if we discover other stars of the same origin we can use other names of suns family . 
  also greek mythology and `` proper familial relationships '' are quite contradictory , do n't you think ? 
  ofaso was the sl ? 
  both situations is about an ambush . 
  blasting anything from a speaker would be akin broadcasting `` we know you are coming '' . 
  using pop music is worse because it sounds like `` we know you are coming and we do n't give a shit '' . 
  quite unnerving for an anxious soldier . 
   one tip i would give you is look around yourself and try to help the teammates in your immediate vicinity . 
  if you and some teammates are in a building , instead of having everyone looking one way out the windows , have you or some people cover the back door and flanks . 
  always try to maintain sight to any flanks or side entrances that may compromise your position . 
  the times guys with smg clogging the windows and leaving the doors/corridors unguarded really pisses me off as a dedicated rifleman . 
  i still rage whenever i remember we lost a map because a single russian killed 10 of us because nobody except me was guarding our flanks . 
  a rather great analysis about the game plot is that it is compared to a drug trip . 
  things are going awesome and you get higher and higher ( and deeper to the rabbit hole ) as you get close to vaas , you get more native and you ultimately become a crazed semi-native warrior bend on revenge . 
  after you take down vaas thu , the high point of the game , your are starting to get the down trip , feeling worse and worse ( with your companions comments also pointing this . ), 
  ultimately ( spoilers ahoy ) you have to either choose between pulling yourselve out of this `` heart of darkness '' nightmare , and get back to your friends and out of the islands , or stay behind and embrace your wild , drug addicted savage , and ultimately ( major spoilers ) get used and disposed . 
   i do n't know what the raptor 's relative momentum was in space , but i bet it was n't zero . 
  i do n't remember the scene op refers , but if this was true that subsequent explosion should looked like a small underground nuclear device . 
  it not about a nuclear detonation , it is about the energy released on that explosion . 
  something moving at thousands of meters per second that instantaneously meets an object will release all its kinetic energy in the surrounding area , creating an explosion well within nuclear weapon ranges . 
  and you can get a mushroom cloud with an explosion big enough even if it not atomic in nature , even if this would not be the case with the raptor since it was underground . 
  it would probably look [ like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1f6vbiuut0 ) only not symmetrical , but as a wave in front of the ship , and much much , much bigger . 
  [ you . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix3bht-prhe ), 
  guilty . 
  i like you.it rare for people to seek the real root of a problem and instead go for the fastest answer.the answer to this is not `` stop the poacher scum '' but `` stop the need for poachers '' . 
  a nice way would be to contaminate somehow the animal parts so they lose their price.or even better spread the rumor that rhino horns actually cause [ koro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koro_\\ ( medicine \\ ) ) , an entirely fictitious disease that shrinks your penis . 
  apparently on a lot of issues you require at least a phd to even see the root of the problem.don ' t ask me what do you need for a proper discussion for a solution . 
  because getting new `` victims '' out of the indigenous population will only make them less willing to help/protect the animals . 
  plus the cost of training , supplying and have permanent park guards is , i personally think , worse than simply shutting off the whole market . 
  the issue here is to stop the killing of the animals asap , not punish the bad . 
  i can drink 8 + glasses of rum and feel nothing . 
  i can drink 2 + glasses of wine and i feel like nothing . 
  and that is why i have a hentai fetish . 
  it would be hilarious if it had an `` i quit '' sign at the ending.proper fit for ops story . 
   fancy piezo-electric lighters that keep catching my eye, 
   something about that lighter fluid smell i guess . 
  red flags.red flags all around . 
  my main issue with the tv series.right now they can all die and i would give a single fuck because i have created distance between myself and characters that i like . 
  i do start rooting for the white walkers thu. 
  they look like badass undead wizard-vikings that will cleanse westeros from all the shitheads . 
  you have a spare ), 
  hey marketer!why should i pay 19.90 $ with all the thousands of free videos out there?what your products best advantages over tube sites ? 
  it is an [ ant mimicry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant_mimicry ) spider from the looks.like [ this example ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2672/3866768895_cc99bc1dfe_z.jpg?zz=1 ) . as for what species i do n't know . 
   family drama - never really saw this . 
  just a lot of kids begging their parents to rent just one more thing , or trying to convince their parents that an r-rated movie `` was n't that bad '' . 
  we stayed pretty neutral on this stuff . 
  we answered the parents ' questions , but made no recommendations . 
  that 's what the mpaa is for . 
  so mostly it was just parroting what the rating was and letting them decide for themselves . 
  i am working in a rental shop here in europe.an exchange i had the other day :, 
  7 year old brat : `` come on mom , i want gta v ! '', 
  mom : `` oh i do n't know it does n't seem like proper game for your age '', 
  7 year old brat : `` but mom i has played other games like that . 
  it has nothing bad ! '', 
  mom : `` well i guess . . '', 
  me : '' i advise against that madam '', 
  mom : `` what?why ? '', 
  me : `` it has hookers and coke '', 
  mom : `` oh no you little brat you are getting dora the explorer ! '', 
  burn little brat , burn . 
  neutral enough ? 
  actually it is the other way around.it is safer looking as an ant than as a spider from predator.let that sink a bit on how terrifying ants are in natural world . 
  true !, 
  .  pop ! <, 
  see [ this map ] ( http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/243/8/d/greek_colonies_by_captainvoda-d2xoyh3.jpg ) and feel weirder ... 
  no bb points.enough said . 
  now each nation has separate opinion that goes from -100 to +100 for each other so you can get more realistic reactions.if you conquer a neighboring province from mali for example , they will be pissed , but ottomans will not give a damn ( unless they are interested in africa of course ) . there are various cases that give a + or - on a country 's opinion like if you are the same religion , same culture or have a royal marriage . 
  another changes is that instead of random nations attacking you alone and getting killed like eu3 , in eu 4 if you conquer lot of land too fast you can get a coalition of nations , a semi alliance of threatened nations that will join any war a member has against you and only you . 
  however you have to click on the game button and go to the games store page , and then it tell you if you have it.if you add the issue that you cant open multiple tabs like most browsers it can be tedious , especially if you want to get the 25th dlc of a game and you do n't remember which is which . 
   rip [ westwood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k5v6sm_sza#t=2m00s ) , [ maxis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgutmeti13s ) , and [ dice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm-gzgtqmew#t=0m03s ) respectively . 
  :( , the feels . 
  ms paint contributions will get 2 khaleesi up votes above pro photoshop ones .

  it is a self-fulfilling prophecy : / r/insidejorahshead, 
  i really created the subreddit as a reply to comment `` this exists '' . and then i woke up to a proper new subreddit . 
  surprised at least . 
  i do n't want to spam so if you think it is good say a word out there.or even better contribute !, 
  i could make on about arya , but it probably be just a list of names . . 
  you are welcome . 
  but i would like to point out that the writers themselves propagate that , considering the last episode . 
  you 're welcome , 
  i am a got viewer.i * need * something silly or its depression road . 
  also if you overdid it with the time speed you could get outside the galaxy , endlessly drifting.but come to think about it now it was way ahead of its time . 
  the lag would be counted in mins or hours even at best circumstances.and no you ca n't get faster than light in transmission . 
   any well explored physical models of the universe . 
  so we have uncovered 100 % percent of anything we can find about physics?there is no chance for any surprises at all ? 
  if that is the case then why do n't we just unplug any physics research and use the money for something better ? 
  why are we spending money in space exploration if the chances of leaving our solar system is 100 % nil ? 
   i was n't around when this was , but dang , we 've come a long way . 
  you would be surprised how detailed it was taking in count how old it is . 
  you can forget the modular , dyi kerbal spaceships of course , but it had a lot of planets , a somewhat detailed version of the kennedy space center and a fictitious base in vales marineris , preset space stations in orbit around the moon ( with some of them spinning !, 
  ) , earth and mars and spaceships with full rcs , eva and docking capabilities ( something that took a really long time for squad to pull off in ksp ) . 
  and technically it had the whole galaxy to travel around ( it was mostly empty . 
  not bad for something that was released the next year after the original doom . 
  of course i would remember orbiter !, 
  it was the game that brutally taught me orbital mechanics , docking , dv and fuel consumption , so when i bought ksp , i had fun since day one , and did n't need to climb the learning curve .
