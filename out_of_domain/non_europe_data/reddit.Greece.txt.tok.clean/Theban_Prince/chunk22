  i still miss the dozen informative screens tbh , something that vanilla ksp lucks still . 
  the goal of scientific study is understanding the universe . 
  there 's no end goal of `` colonize space '' or something . 
  this is not a giant game of civilization . 
  so you agree that we have n't understand everything , and definite answers are yet just pompous speculations ? 
  sometimes scientific truth sucks . 
  warp drives would be awesome but they are extremely unlikely to ever be possible . 
  it sucks but that 's the truth . 
  voyager 1 has left the solar system . 
  mission accomplished . 
  science is never over.whenever someone thought we where on the top of the game , something new was found . in you comparison to the game civilization , ** you ** think we are at the last technology levels , i think making assumptions for the future is wrong . 
   3 . space exploration can provide more benefits to humanity than just interstellar colonization . 
  nuclear fusion is likely to play a big part in the latter half of this century and the future . 
  a-neutronic fusion requires he3 which does n't exist in significant quantities on earth but does on the moon and on the gas giants . 
  ultimately we will try to leave the solar system , either the slow road ( generation ships ) or the fast road ( ftl or close to ftl without breaking the laws of the universe ) . 
  it is not a choice , it is hardwired to our brains from our animalistic progenitors . 
  yup . 
  and it sounds like it . 
  possibly no . 
  you have * too much power * . 
  ok that is weird.i just stopped playing star wars battlefront to see this message . 
  the only game i have ever preordered for ** 50 ** $ was [ europa universalis iv ] ( http://www.europauniversalis4.com/ ) from paradox interactive , mostly for the great bonuses ( a free game amongst them ) and because i thought they deserved every penny . 
  since i was jobless at that time , i literally saved money from my allowance my parents gave me ( i am freaking 29 ) to survive . 
  i was there , waiting at launch date , with all the fanfare . 
  it was really a high point in a dark time in my life . 
  the game goes live and it is freaking unplayable . 
  lags all over the place . 
  i am forced to wait 1.5 month for a patch to make it play , and the worst of the worst is that by that time the game is at regular sales at ** 15 $ ** and lower . 
  pre-orders , never again . 
  it almost turned me back to piracy , but steam held me from descending to that place . 
  the meander is a common ancient greek symbol and pretty innocent . 
  the colors of the flag on the other hand . . 
  so you ... ** enhanced ** ? 
  for one of the reasons i think east vs west was scrapped entirely : it would create a circlejerk to end all circlejerks . 
  having a game delving controversial subjects is dangerous for the company . 
  however ,, 
  i feel that gaming is still not considered a proper art yet , and if for example a game takes place during the holocaust then people will freak out for making `` fun '' something horrible . 
  when movies , paintings , music had already done so and not always with delicate hand , yet rarely we see a shitstorm . 
  vic 3 will come out at least in 1 + year . 
  paradox usually releases during q3 of the year , and this year is focused on hoi4 . 
  even if it did get released , i unfortunetely dont see two official converters ( for eu iv -  vic 3 and for vic3 -  hoi iv ) to get released at the same time . 
  shame since it could an awesome marketing strategy to keep players playing various paradox games . 
  edit : i love the words released and year , deal with it, 
  i issue you the * grand ultimate crusader kings 2 challenge * . start a game and pass from all the types of play the dlcs allow in one single game.this means merchant republic , pagan/reformed pagan , christian , muslim and of course reach emperor status . 
  bonus points if :, 
  - your first empire is either the holy roman empire or byzantine reformed into roman.dual points if you get one after another in a single ruler, 
  - points for each different subreligion you have for individual rulers ( norse/tengri , orthodox/catholic , sunni , shiite etc ), 
  - creating kingdoms/empires that are considered challenges i.e. 
  israel with a jewish ruler . 
  - you use the newest/optional religions/cultures ( hindu/aztex etc ), 
  rules :, 
  dont use gamey mechanics . 
  a ruler that changes from pagan to catholic is fine . 
  one that changes 5 religions just to get the points is not . 
  extra : your score doubles if it is on ironman , something impossible since you ca n't inherit merchant republics due to engine limitations and you have to save scum to pull it of . 
  that will hold you for at least vic3 goes out . i am trying over year to do it . 
   only install it a few times, 
  that ... that abomination still exists ?!, 
  ca n't someone sue and get over with it ? 
  rise ... of ... nations ? 
  holy shit not on reddit too.i have seen that guys stuff all over the internet . 
  i will say that he is creating just sensationalist , easy to digest , 2 edgy 4 u art , something my 50 + aunt will post in my facebook wall with the title '' this guy sees the truth !!!!! '', 
  i stand by my opinion even if it gets my karma to the underworld . 
  this is obviously a test to see how planes can be used against buildings . 
  notice how at 0.30 it looks a lot like the 9/11 attack , and i do n't think it is a coincidence that israel was the top foreign operator of f-4 phantoms according [ to this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcdonnell_douglas_f-4_phantom_ii#israel ) . the background looks decisively middle eastern , so it must be in israel . 
  the angle of the attack and the aftermath really looks like how the pentagon was attaccked . 
  another fishy clue is that [ john mcdonnell ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_mcdonnell_\\ ( businessman \\ ) ) , son of the founder of mcdonnell aircraft corporation , was until recently chairman of the board in barnes - ** jewish ** hospital . 
  take of that what you will . 
  disclaimer : all these are bullshit i thought in 2 mins.i just tried to see how much conspiracy juice i can get from one random video . 
   suez channel, 
  my tongue has pierced my cheek . 
  actually you did a great mod job and thank you as a redditor for that . 
  the video is looking exactly like what someone would find on a fringe conspiracy site , so i tried to find any `` conspiracy worthy '' material.it literally took me about 2 minutes to find connections a nut job could use , out of nothing . 
  conquest of paradise had a random map generator , something truly unique for a paradox game , and it was for a very new game , eu iv at 15 . 
  in comparison heart of darkness was 19 for an already old game . 
  and while that price was reasonable then , i find it preposterous now , especially with the luck of sales . 
  for the last 3 months i am universally monitoring , it went only once and for us only from games top . 
  i am not talking about the release price back at 2012/13 , i am talking about price over time ( that ** falls ** very fast for eu iv and ck2 , and really , any other peace of software ) and availability of the oldest games on sales/promotions . they have offered the ck2 base game for free/as a gift numerous times ffs !, 
  if is like the marketing/sales dept forgot about those games entirely . 
  the truest ecological message ever . 
  do n't save the goddamn planet for its own shake , it does n't care , ~ ~ save ~ ~ stabilize the environment to save our asses . 
  i wish environmentalists switched more to this , instead of `` see those cute endangered pandas '' . 
  that is why you can say sun-like stars.it means they are same like our sun . 
  our sun is ** the ** sun , it is our star 's unique name.other stars should really called simply that , or their own unique name , for example [ antares ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antares ) . 
  maybe you should have dressed like he-man and not prince adam then .
