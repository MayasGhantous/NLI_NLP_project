  they are not separate persons physically . 
   but the fact remains that the fetus is actively harming the mother . 
  another issue you have confused.it is not ** actively ** harming the mother . 
  pregnacy can be dangerous due to complications , not in a normal situation . 
  the body of a woman has evolved to carry pregnacies , a natural process . 
  it would be the same if your stomach bursted and hurt you with its acid . 
  there is no intent , nor any moral blame , since the acid is a natural process . 
   i say yes . 
  this man is not actively trying to end my life . 
  however i still hold him morally responsible for this impending harm . 
  in this situation it 's my life versus his . 
  in addition to the fact i believe him to be morally responsible , i believe i should be able to weigh my own life and well being more heavily than i do his . 
  this is callous and selfish yes , but i do not think it is untrue . 
  we do not have a moral obligation to be noble and sacrifice ourselves for a stranger . 
  you would go to jail if you did this . 
  since the driver had no intention to kill you , you would have to prove 100 % that by killing the driver you would save your life , something that no court will accept . 
  if you killed the driver by trying to avoid the accident , you would be prosecuted for [ involuntary manslaughter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manslaughter#involuntary_manslaughter ) . you had fair chances to get away from it . 
  if you ** chose ** to kill the driver and the prosecutor could prove it was your choice , then it is be murder , not self defence . 
   if a person forced another person to attack you , would it be illegal to defend yourself ? 
  the person would have a choice.a fetus is not . 
  and i ask again . 
  can a conjoined twin kill the other or demand an operation that would kill the other , as he can claim it is a parasitic person actively taking nutrients and thus `` attacking him '' ? 
   a fetus constantly leeches nutrients from its mother . 
  i would qualify this as a harm . 
  but having some of your food taken away is not that big of a deal , fair enough . 
  pregnancy causes the mother to have extremely limited mobility in the late stages . 
  pregnant mothers are prone to constant mood swings from the various hormones associated with pregnancy . 
  not to mention the debilitating mental and emotional trauma associated with being forced to carry to term the child of your rapist . 
  i would absolutely disagree with you that the fetus is not actively harming the mother . 
  i will focus in this since this is the main argument you use . 
  so , excuse me if i ask again , since i have replied on many comments , but is n't that applicable on conjoined twins also ? 
  the have to share nutrients , limited mobility , and in most cases bigger mental and emotional trauma , since it is something more overt than a pregnancy from rape . 
  what twin is morally responsible ? 
  can one decide to have an operation that will separate them but be lethal to the other twin , based on your arguments ( he is a parasitic organism ! ), 
  and we are talking about two adults here , not a fetus that either in the eyes of society ( morally ) or in the eyes of law ( legally ) has limited responsibility of his actions until he is 18 y.o. 
  when i was inquiring about the conjoined twins , i was using an example of two * adult * conjoined twins . 
  now tell me who is responsible for leeching the other ? 
  ( nutrients , creating the worst personal stress , health hazards etc ) , and even if we could prove that indeed one of the twins is living from the other ( i.e. 
  like the fetus is living from the mother `` endangering '' her ) , is he morally responsible , since he never chose to be born this way and has no other alternative , and can we use the argument so we have a fatal separating operation ? 
  if the baby and the mother have the same moral obligations , and the baby is the aggressor , so we can `` kill '' it with abortion is self defense , is n't that morally applicable on a conjoined ** adult ** twin that is living off the other twin ? 
  indeed can we use the same morals for people that willingly enter our house with the common cold , that can be , while very rare , lethal ? 
  at what point lethal action is allowed ? 
  what i am trying to pinpoint is that no matter how you put it , pregnancy is not equivalent with someone pulling a gun on you or accidentally hitting you with the car . 
  those are cases that are pretty straightforward , your life is in imminent and clear danger , so self defense is morally ( and legally ) justifiable . 
  pregnancy has the * potential * to be dangerous , but its ** purpose ** and ** intend ** as a natural process is not life threading so self defense is n't justifiable de facto . 
  its the same reason in real life , late abortions are ussualy only allowed if the life of the mother is in danger , because there is a ** clear and present danger ** . 
   for the record i am not in favor of pro-life , i was attempting to do my best to defend the position . 
  i personally do not believe we should consider a fetus to be a person in the moral sense , as i think that a fetus lacks many features that define personhood . 
  i , too , share the same opinion.however you are focusing on weak front , when ops question is easy to get answered : yes , yes it is hypocritical . 
  a fetus is either a person since conception day one , so he must be allowed to live without be accountable for the parents crimes/emotional distress ( you would n't kill a child if he created stress/economical ruin on his parents ) , or they are not and abortion can be used for any reason . 
  i have no reason to attack paradox at all . 
  indeed i had cried foul myself some times . 
  but i see patches trying to fix things every six months . 
  that is commendable actually . 
  hey do n't kill me , i have never made another one ever . 
  good and easy to read tutorials are desperately needed !, 
  the problem is that i understand some concepts , but it so overwhelming and has such a new terminology that is very esoteric.but i will conquer it !, 
  would anyone have guessed that the rise of the machine swarms will start from a semi serious indie game about little green men ? 
  i think not . 
  [ i bought victoria ii in the recent sale ... ] ( http://en.reddit.com/r/victoria2/comments/27hzjj/i_too_bought_vic2_at_the_resent_salebut_still/ ), 
  it is like electricity and candles.when electric lightning was introduced , it was pretty expensive and rare . 
  this caused wealthy houses to abandon candles so they can show off . 
  candles were used by the poor only , so it was a sub par product . 
  when electrical lights became commonplace , and candles where rare and difficult to use , they roles reversed . 
  it is nowadays common to consider a candlelit diner as more prestigious event than a day to day dinner . 
  fireplaces/central heating are the same . 
  the law is clear : 15 y.o. 
  is below the age of concent . 
  its rape . 
  so much work lost because nobody uses the terrain mode . 
  is it that difficult to make a terrain mode with transparent country colors ? 
  until i reached / r/tumblrinaction , i thought i have accidentally opened my subredits tab .

   i honestly kinda hate it when people think irelands even in britain, 
  the british isles are called like that since antiquity mate . 
  you are part of britain . 
  you 're not part of the unite kingdom * of * britain . 
  same as canada is part of america , but not part of the united states * of * america, 
  yeah but the pope should be scary . 
  i am not responding on that particular case , i am responding to / u/snatat . 
  a 15 year old is legally ( well most of the times also morally ) not able to consent , hence sex without consent ( aka rape ) . 
  i was struggling to understand why people cried `` rape '' myself when i finally understood that . 
  meh i i will archive binge the top posts of all time , that truly are hilarious , and then forget about it.either they will post decent content regularly to appear to the front page and visit them , or i will forget them entirely . 
   in the case of abortion , killing the fetus is necessary to get it out of your body . 
  since a pregnancy is not by definition a clear and present lethal danger and if we count a fetus as a full conscious being ( a child ) , then lethal force ( abortion ) is not allowed . 
  nobody sees it right ? 
  legion is the vanguard of the true wis. 
  true wis will be a completely different , eve intergrated ** pc ** game , so the vets will stop the hurr duur spaceships ** and ** ccp can get income with a new subscription to support such great endeavor without the aurum shit . 
  why they have n't done that from the start and lost time with the stillborns dust and incarna really beats me . 
  you only need one game to share skill and char info with the other and you are set to go . 
  hmm first giveway , ever ... thanks op !, 
  that 's like a treasure trove .
