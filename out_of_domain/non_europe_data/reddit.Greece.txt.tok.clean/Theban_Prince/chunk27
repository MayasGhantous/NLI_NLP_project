  why the fuck there is a gal with cello that gets eaten by a wall in a * game * company presentation?and why does this affect his feels ? 
  if we count his present forces , no , no in a million miles . 
  but ( major spoilers ) he literally started as a farmer with two goats and by the end of the second season he have wiped out any opposition and become king . 
  either by personal combat , or treachery ( there is no guest protection in the viking world ) he annihilated every adversary . 
  it is n't far fetched that he could create a bigger power base pretty fast . 
  when someone tried to harm him , his vengeance was fast and complete , no `` honorable '' warnings . 
  as the starks have shown , a big army is n't the only thing to get you what you want . 
  or protect you . 
  the thing is he would not need to conquer every single kingdom.he would probably win the alliance of the iron born , since they share a lot ( rl vikings where the template for the iron borns after all ) , then he certainly had good chances of sacking king 's landing pretty fast and without warning ( no i am the true king and i am coming for you , nonsense . 
  ) with their combined forces , and since the nobles of westeros have the tendency to offer their allegiance to the strongest , he could snowball from there . 
  however , if he took the city , the probability of taking cersei as a concubine reach infinity ( highborn?check.hot?check . 
  crazy weird chick ? 
  so that probably would be his downfall . 
  that 's why he would probably use them simply as bodies to burn . 
  ragnar did that pretty much all the time with his allies . 
  plus the ironborn have the tendency to surrender in stupid situations ( would you surrender to someone who is known to flail men and has a home called dreadfort ? 
  and just months ago betrayed and massacred his liege and his family ? 
  i would not . ), 
  also kings landing has very good defenses , but those count only in a prolonged siege ( until an army is mustered and sent for relief ) . 
  even stannis , that proclaimed his intentions months ago and approached the city in a not so subtle way almost won despite the wildfire . 
  ragnar would probably pass his people in the city as peddlers and hit from inside.the man does n't care about the honor or following the laws of war . 
  one open gate during a moonless night and knarrs appearing out of nowhere and he is victorious . 
  case in point , the vikings ravaged the better defended and wealthier western europe for centuries . 
  ironborn would follow ragnar , not the other way around ( even if they didnt know they are doing it ) . 
  plus if we count ragnars present status , he is already king with probably a sizable army . 
  i was sarcastic . 
  just like in westeros , it gets thrown out of the window ( in the tv at least ), 
  we was a pretty decent roman emperor from what i remember , and i skimmed wikipedia without finding something extraordinary.he killed some families , but what emperor did n't ? 
  the dog probably fall over/backed down after shot.danger averted . 
  cops do n't usually go after incapacitated suspects and coup de gr\u00e2ce them . 
  despite what the news told you , we are not living in cardboard boxes . 
  greece has a flourishing tourism economy , and surprisingly the crisis might even did a good thing , since it put greece in the forefront of the news for 2-3 years . 
  never a bad publicity ! . 
  what busted was the banks that had their own mortgage bubble and the public sector since the corrupt governments had hidden the domestic deficit , and when the real numbers were known , the market ( predictably and understandably ) fucked us over . 
  both of these ( the banks and governments ) have strong ties with each other , mostly with gifts between them . 
  the problem is not economical so much now , but political , because we want a change but we have to choose between known corrupted parties ( the present government ) , possible corrupted governments that like to spill inflammatory comments rocking the international trust in greece ( out of the euro ?!, 
  really guy 's ? 
  now ? ), 
  or the fringes ( far right or left ) . 
  most of the working , tax paying population is between a rock and a hard place . 
  and on top of that we are called freeloaders . 
  it is pame :p, 
  notepad + + is you savior . . 
  nahh do n't worry it was a friendly jab . 
  hey when i said roj would bring elephants in paris everyone scolded me . 
  i mean why not go full fantasy and create an expansion with elves ? 
  according to some fans the game does n't matter if it is plausible . 
   ** beta ** males at best , if not ** omega ** . 
  a man does n't just `` buy '' women . 
  he is young . 
  ban of vices = crime, 
  they could do it with two videos , one from a shark underwater and one from the guy swimming.the splashing around and hand movements help keep the transition clear.the shark is real , but being near the swimmer ? 
  bacteria that eat other bacteria + energy from the sun . 
  they thought exoplanetes would be rare and we would take much longer to find some . 
  replace mexico with greece and us with germany/imf and you have the present situation in europe . 
  only the people we own are the same that are bailing us out . 
  where to if i may ask?i am torn between n. europe and either canada or s. africa . 
  you didnt read his comment do you ? 
  that natural disaster was what exposed the corruption and whole system went to meltdown , same as the economic crash exposed the greek one . 
  now i am one of the first to criticize the greek issues for years , but i must remind you that american companies received bribes to fix the greek books , and europe either failed for years to notice this , so they are grossly incompetent , or they deliberately ignored maiking them accomplices . 
  but you wont hear that when they are putting all the greeks in the same boat and the northerners are here to chastice the lazy south . 
  how do you like to put all greeks on the same basket ? 
  the general age of retirment was 60 for years and it is 65 since before the crisis.while there was rampart corruption , the eu was eiher grossly incompenent in detecting it or an accomplice . siemens , a german company accused for paneuropean corruption schemes has being part of a scandal here also , since they had their hands on the greek army and the olympics , a garganduan drain of the countrys income.the exact same polticians implicated in the multibillion scandal are either free or part of the multiparty coalition the eu uses to beat some sense to us lazy greeks . 
  had you any idea about this before you spewed ignorant stuff the sun , bield and fox excretes ? 
  i am only considering because we already have people there.we are aware of the social and economic troubles , that is why we are not sure yer.because i would love to live there . 
  is it considered symbolic to open up the southeastern markets like italy and greece to the northern industry with zero restrictions ? 
  the same symbolic reason that are using to get the eastern countries and rest of the balcans in now?i wonder how that will end in 10 years ... oh it created the biggest friction between the west and east since 1991 . 
  good job again bloated eu zombi . 
  greece did not got in for symbolic reasons , that is another lie to present the greeks as underachieving and named europeans only for sentimental value . 
  it was purely for economic and diplomatic goals . 
  i will not , of course , absolve the greek people , not for being corrupted or lazy , because they are not worse than any other , but vastly indifferent to the corruption of the goverment . 
  i would also like to point that the majority of the greeks are fearfull to report crimes , especially regarding corruption . 
  i have heard theories that this is because we have been under oppression for many years , making us either distrusting or outright hostile against the state , something ofcourse very bad in a democracy ( the americans are experiencing the same , but because of the spy scandals and post 11/9 sombering ) . 
  as for sources , i am unable to provide now , since i use a mobile now , but you can search for articles from before the greek centric slandering began that specifically point that greek politicians paid goldman sau hs to cover the debt under eus nose ( supposedly ) for at least a decade.the same goldman by the way that destroyed greece 's bonds by catecoring them as junk . 
  i would also point you to research the siemens scandal and their involvment in providing greek hospitals , schools , public transportation , olympic security and the greek army with defective or uneeded overpricedequipment . 
  you will notice this is a huge part of the ` evil lazy greek public sector ' . i would point also to the german companies that bought the national telecomunication provider and the international airport . 
  all before the crisi began . 
  or the completely defective submarines we got , i shit you not , from german shipyards for billions . 
  or the tor m1 missile systems . 
  the list goes on and on . 
  there are a lot of sources for these everywhere . 
  now research these and compare how these companies used the eu free , uneregulated , markets to dominate the south . 
  how europe was voting open borders/free trade policies as fast as possible , but supporting institutions such one that would be a protection against greece implosions are still unimplemeted . 
  it all started from a [ serbian music vide ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/serbia-strong-remove-kebab ) o. 
  [ reuters article about it . 
  ] ( http://rt.com/business/siemens-greece-bribery-payment-596/ ) . 
  further illuminating the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens_greek_bribery_scandal#cite_note-iht1jul08-3 ) that the german company payed the two main greek political parties . 
  the ** exact same parties ** that are spearheading the reformation of the lazy greek people to law abiding eu citizens with germany 's blessing . 
  can you imagine how it feels that you get lambasted for voting for corrupt politicians , yet have absolutely no choice ? 
  the main opposition party ( syriza ) that exists now , absorbed a large percentage of politicians that abandoned ship when pasok , one of the corrupted by siemens , imploded . 
  so that 's one option dead . 
  the other candidates are either smaller offshoots from pasok and nd , or far right ( neo nazi ) or far left ( communist ) parties . 
  as a voter and a citizen , what should i do ? 
  how should i react when the majority here on reddit and in eu believe the greek people , all 11 million of them somehow tricked the eu and most of the global banks for decades so we can smooch our ouzos ?

  cant you simply hold on to your capitals duchy ? 
  according to some nutjobs here in greece , polynesia was actually colonized by ancient greeks . 
  i repeat . 
  polynesia was colonized using ancient triremes in 500 bc.from frigging mediterranean sea,
