  can you please explain your comment ( not sarcasm ) . 
  i specifically asked about evw so how did supreme ruler got in the discussion ? 
  my question was based around the fact that the game got canceled as incomplete . 
  a lot of people were disappointed and thought that it was worth to at least release it as a free game ( something that paradox had announced it will do until retracting ) or even get finished by paradox themselves . 
  this discussion got even more heated after the game got leaked . 
  but if nuclear war was not good by design , the game loses major points and the debate is ( for me ) moot . 
  a huge thanks for this in depth , well articulared and on point comment review.it seems the game had the basics set , and lucked polising which can be a pain . 
  i am suspecting that paradox is at fault here , since if this is the state of the game now i cant imagine how it looked when they announced the release date.i am almost certain tha paradox rushed rhe game . 
  if you are lambasting the shooting of the stormtroopers in the first movies , it has being pointed that they deliberately shoot poorly to allow the main characters to escape , and flee to the hidden base in yavin so the empire would follow them there . 
  it is mostly a fan theory that simply makes sense . 
  ** looking ** is legal ( but see below ) . 
  getting ** pictures ** of someones lawn is assumed illegal , and the owner ( you ) does not need to warn others `` contractually '' by putting any sign or warning about it . 
  that is real life law dude . 
   i do n't have a right to control how people behave in front of my property assuming it does n't harm my property . 
  but you have the complete right to control how people use your property . 
  if you do n't want people to look at your beautiful garden , you can plant a big fence to hide it from outside your property . 
  nobody will say anything . 
  ** the fence is a real analog of a drm by the way . 
  i was once swimming merrily at broad daylight . 
  all fine and good but unfortunately for me after a few meters of deep water there was a big wall of rocks that went all the way up , reaching just barely before the surface of the water making them invisible . 
  i stopped , but by putting my feet against them to slow down i stepped on a bunch of sea urchins . 
  painful days followed but nothing serious , however i am always dreadfully wondering what would happen to my head if i had dived underwater fast or swam at night . 
  sea is always a dangerous place kids , even without monsters from the deep . 
  you want that visibility . 
  but what if a psycho shooter appears ? 
  would n't you want to be in a crowd that can retaliate ? 
  imagine if you are with 100 people , and 20 of them are carrying guns and rifles . 
  the 19 of them have some kind of formal gun training , be it from military or police , the last one has none except some shots in a shooting range . 
  a psycho appears and starts killing people . 
  the gun owners respond . 
  now 19 trained people , 1 psycho and one untrained dude are having a shootout in a public area that has civilians rapidly panicking . 
  do n't you feel safer now ? 
  you have n't leave there are you ? 
  i am in greece and for years i have heard the same even from my own people . 
  i have been hospitalized in both private and public owned hospitals . 
  the difference was minimal . 
  except the costs of course . 
  there were mostly on par with northern europe , and of course according to the gdp of each country . 
  then the weak foundations of the e.u. 
  crumbled in 2010 and by order of berlin and the imf they were almost obliterated . 
  umm do you have any sources about that except sensationalist new articles ? 
  any who , or eurostat research or example ? 
   uhmmm , no ? 
  precisely . 
  are you aware that this might make df explode to the wider masses ? 
  should i start playing again now or wait for the update?will it break ? 
  wait , there is * legal * sterilization of inmates ? 
  indeed it is.but the having to decode both at the same time should be an entry test for any espionage agency worth a damn ... . 
  wait a minute . . 
  if the owners request to not be included then google is obligated to do so since it is a commercial use . 
  snapping a photo of a house in the background of your kids first bicycle ride is not the same as posting it online on any website.but it still stands that you can `` lock '' the view of your garden with fences , walls etc ( a real life drm ) and nobody can accused you of anything unless of course you do n't have construction permits , but that is another issue entirely . 
  it is . 
  these injunctions are both ** fresh and hot fucker ** !,

  [ say it !,

  google has something on this as its policy :, 
  [ link ] ( http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/privacy/#streetview ), 
  and [ an article ] ( http://blog.kenkaminesky.com/photography-copyright-and-the-law/ ) by a full time photographer discussing rights with an attorney that specifically states that, 
  some courts have found that a photographer has violated privacy rights even when photographing someone in public . 
  instances would include cases where the photographers harass their subjects , use hidden cameras , or wait for a woman 's skirt to be blown at a fun house . 
  it also is unlawful to view and photograph people inside of residences or other places where privacy is normally expected , even when the photographer is standing in public . '', 
  you can google the rest to find more specific info . 
  i found these with one search . 
  but he will never get cards for touching the ball with his hand !, 
  two wrongs do n't make a right .

  edit : and before you go with the nazi supporter road . 
  [ 33.09 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_november_1932 ) of the german people were also supporters . 
  but unless something changed , voting for a party , even the nazis , is not illegal , while guarding a concentration camp willingly is . 
  yup . 
  umm are you implying that these laws are not in effect already for years ? 
  where have been living ? 
   walking about with google glass recording, 
  that has been specifically stated that it is illegal to record videos/take photos of someone with a device of any kind , be it google glasses or even a old black and white photograph . 
  even news agencies have been served court orders for people that got photographed and got published . 
  google has created a program that blurs peoples faces especially to avoid this . 
   people recording protests in the streets , recording police brutality ,, 
  first of all , these are shot in a public place and they are not the primary focus of the photograph , and second , * yes * photographers of police misconduct has being accused . 
  there even was a post in reddit about this in the front page 2 days ago . 
  rarely they got sentenced , and mostly depending on the situation . 
  hey if they fix the ui it will be a blast . 
  i mean an [ indie game about building with shitty 8-bit boxes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minecraft ) and [ another one that needs at least base line understanding of orbital mechanics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerbal_space_program ) have become huge mainstream successes . 
  maybe they will never reach cod and gta status , but they are far far far better than fringe df that most people know from reading aars of players that actually do the worst thing and * actually * play them . 
  the graphics and the ui of a game is like the looks of a person . 
  it will be the first thing you see about them and you base your decision to approach them or not . 
  the substance ( character for people , gameplay for games ) comes later and is what actually creates long lasting relationships . 
  you skimmed over some part of what you posted :, 
  '' in many countries ( especially english-speaking ones ) the subject 's consent is not usually needed for publishing a straightforward photograph of an identifiable individual taken in a public place . 
  however , the term published ** should not be construed to include commercial use ** , as consent is usually required in these situations '', 
  so you can post a photo of guy clashing with the police . 
  you can not publish a photo of a guy walking down the street so promote the clothes he is wearing , nor publish a photo of a garden on how beautiful it is . 
  this because the law knows that you can either do n't go out in public , or cover your garden . 
  drm examples . 
  there are numerous people that have no idea how hotkeys work . 
  and we discovered the mouse ** because ** the keyboard was clunky, 
  i am a bit sarcastic that the majority of dwarf fortress aficionados are not actually playing the game , by mostly let others do the task and they just read the awesome stories and lps . 
  so we are a band of few , a band of big brothers ? 
  you do n't need to copy paste the battle system from one game to the other , but you can your philosophy.that will make much more `` realistic battles '' and fit with the general serious tone of ck2 . 
  you could issue orders before the battle starts to individual commanders/captains , and when the battle starts they will try to accomplish that based on their military skill and traits .
