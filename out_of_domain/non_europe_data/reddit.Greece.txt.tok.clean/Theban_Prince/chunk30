  you would be able to issue fast orders only to units under your direct control ( retinues ? ), 
  and further orders to your commanders would take time based again on your military skill and traits . 
  and you would be able to play 3d battles ** only ** if your active character ( the king ! ), 
  is present . 
  it should be fixed.if not based on distance of armies , at least a standard time to change a leader , like the send diplomat in eu4 . 
  you know that you can keep the hot key philosophy and simply add mouse support to ease new players , right ? 
  this is an extended timeline mod . 
  the year is ** 2002 ce ** so italy had 100 % milan , and probably forced to release it . 
  i thought you simply staged the photo for karma , but that `` hahahaha '' had all the nervous tint of a shill getting caught . 
  well since greece considered itself the continuation of byzantium ... 
  it was offered by gog only for 48 hours because interplay , the original creators of fo1 and fo2 would lost the right of the games to bethesda after a certain date , so they gave them free just before that happened ( supposedly ) as a fuck you to bethesda . 
  so completely free from legit sources no unfortunately . 
  you can find it in [ steam very cheap right now ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/38400/ ), 
  well greek here so yeah . . 
  [ check it out ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megali_idea ), 
  the eastern empire started as the roman empire we know and love but it increasingly became more greek ( well , more so than before ) as the centuries passed , especially after it lost the last western parts.after some time the latin language was used only in official documents , and eventually it was dropped too . 
  so you have an empire speaking greek ruled by greeks . 
  it was de jure the roman empire ( so they called themeselves romans ) , but it was a greek empire nevertheless . 
  that was a point of contention between the papacy and the patriarch . 
  think of the title '' roman empire '' as a crown that gets passed from emperor to emperor.it starts in definite roman/latin hands , but as ages go by those that get it are greek . 
  so the last guy to ` wear ' the crown was greek , ruling over greeks , but more or less he had the same ` crown ' that octavian had.it is the same with the kings in england , they stopped having any french culture eventually but they never gave up the claim they were kings of france . 
  so if we claimed that we are descendants of the roman empire , we mean the greek cultured roman empire of the east.your confusion stems not from what modern greeks thought , but that there was essentialy a medieval greek orthodox empire , that had the right to call itself roman . 
  so the game got you with its story , so i would considered a win . 
  i have found the replaybility of eu4 to be far greater than civ5 . 
  not that civ5 wont take you months to get bored , but with paradox games you can get years of gaming . 
  and that as a plus side , if you learn civ , and you get bored , then that 's it , you have to wait for the next one . 
  but most paradox games have the gameplay basics pretty much the same , so you can try anyone from crusader kings 2 to hearts of iron 4 . 
  but the best option is to get both eventually . 
  a theory i had about astrological sings . 
  maybe the time of the year you are born might effect your personality on some basic details , because the first year of your life you will get different experience based on season . 
  for example , maybe children born during winter , become more introvert because due to the cold weather they do n't get in contact with a lot of people ( see as traveling/visiting is sparse due to the weather ) while children from spring/summer do . 
  so the time of the year you have born might be a slim indicator of your personality . 
  thats of course are just my thoughts and they might be bollocks , but a star making you is even more . 
  that a-way,

  it the kind of people that got confused when they ask them about vestigial organs . 
  direct democracy will give more power to the media . 
  think about it . 
   it is not fine to shit on every other player you have in order to do that , especially not ** by rule bending or flat out throwing dice rolls out the window ** . 
  while your dm did it the wrong way ( he should n't make it so obvious ) you just described the dms job . 
  rules and dice rolls are to be used at the dms discretion . 
  others play by the book , others use it as helpful tool to add some limited randomness on a predetermined story . 
  ** you would lose the battle no matter what ** if the dm decided that , so do n't get stuck on what the dice rolled . 
  if you want to discuss something with your dm is that he needs to work on his ability to hide the railroading , something that even for the best of us it is hard sometimes . 
  man you must have some fun campaigns / s, 
  mate you double posted.you might want to delete this comment . 
   but i think this issue can be addressed by how we choose to implement a direct democracy . 
  can you elaborate on that ? 
   also , the power of the media today has already been mitigated by the rise of the internet . 
  while internet has given us the freedom for a lot of people to express their voices , they are ** too many ** of them . 
  you can see how people are sometimes believing on anything they read , so a buttload of unregulated information on citizens that do n't have the knowledge to double check is even worse . 
  see the antivaccine movement , the blow up of conspiracy theories etc etc. 
  my people have a saying : '' half knowing something is worse than not knowing at all '', 
  and that is a no no . 
  a barbarian was participating on barbarian tournament ... 
  barbarians tend to look up to battle prowess, 
  hmm i wonder if this was a coincidence . 
  what happens if my dm does n't even roll ? 
  well you looked accidentally , yet you got frustrated . 
  you are not supposed to look behind the dms screen , so in this case you should have said `` damn it i saw the roll and i broke my suspension of disbelief '' instead of `` damn the dm fudged the roll '' . 
  nobody is to blame . 
  oh i was n't whining , just that one comment was upvoted and the other downvoted so why lose the karma ? 
  yup, 
  he is a celebrity . 
  that is what celebrities do . 
   you can wear an ugly sweater and pander over a happenstance internet meme . 
  it is called a fucking job . 
  depends on the employee . 
  despite pop culture , and i guess not a lot of people grow up wishing to be a mcdonalds employee , i am sure there are some that are content . 
  silly americans where everyone should wish to have more prestige and money and everything so he can be a winner . 
  i am sure you have valid sources to bundle us all in the same group.what is the equivalent of racism when you target a nationality ? 
  edit : i really do n't understand the down votes . 
  i have always paid my taxes and any insurance i required to so . 
  indeed , i put a locket to my shop because i could n't survive unless i stole from taxes . 
  am i not greek then ? 
  i know personally a lot of people who paid everything until the crisis came . 
  are they not greeks ? 
  the most surprising thing is that our politicians/bankers copied the american way of doing `` business '' , that eventually caused the global financial meltdown , yet none calls the americans corrupt . 
  or the german companies that used the corrupted greeks to make a shitload of money . 
  ahhh yes thank you . 
  and a small in-joke , its actually a greek word . 
  `` americans are lazy and fat '' . 
  `` germans are nazis '' . 
  `` greeks are corrupt '' . 
  where is it bigotry and where is true ? 
  ahh i am sorry , thanks for the reply . 
  i really feel like the scapegoats of the 2008 meltdown . 
  someone people can blame for they broken dreams . 
  imagine if steam was suddenly possessed by mammon and you got it . 
  nobody calls the american people themselves freeloaders and corrupted . 
   ** anecdotes **, 
  can i use your comment elsewhere ? 
   i can tell you that when you try to get closer to it , the rainbow moves away, 
  uhhh you know the rainbow is n't `` there '' , right ? 
  goddammit its true ...
