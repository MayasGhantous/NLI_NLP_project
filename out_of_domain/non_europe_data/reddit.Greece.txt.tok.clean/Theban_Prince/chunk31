  i doubt you are a software eng . 
  very very dubious what i am going to say :, 
  skill are no longer universal nor mandatory . 
  you rolls are based only on ability scores . 
  so if you want to swim , you roll a d20 + ability bonus and that 's it . 
  you can only add bonuses if you have chose specific skills ( swiming skill for example ) or backgrounds ( the tool proficiency you require for crafting ) . 
  so someone without the proper background has absolutely no bonuses . 
  i am surely wrong at some points , but that is the gist of it .

  yay for torpedoing my subtlety !, 
   some have speculated that the changes signal hard times ahead for the porn industry , as many companies such as paypal , amazon , and chase bank have started to disassociate themselves from clients who work in the adult entertainment industry . 
  porn industry is a very big reason those companies are where they are now . 
  paypal for example was used from a lot of porn sites to hide credit card details , and we do n't even discuss how the porn industry injected a lot of money on the web at its nascent years . 
  we shall see.there are a lot of fads int the internet , and a lot of companies that used to be mega beasts yet now they do n't exist . 
  yet porn will always be here . 
   ** in bismarck ** or germany pre-wwi,

  he died long before wwi . 
   those helmets, 
  they are called [ pickelhaube ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickelhaube#pickelhaube_in_world_war_i ) and they were worn mostly by prussian/german soldiers up until the early years of wwi , when it was discovered that a * leather * helmet does not , in fact , protect you from hot shrapnel , no matter how fabulous it is . 
   calling tumblr ** fascist **, 
  as those helmets where worn by german soldiers during the early 20 century , they have no connections with fascism . 
  [ imperial germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_empire ) that was abolished at the end of wwi , while very conservative , was ruled by high class aristocrats . 
  fascism/nazism is actually a product of the middle class . 
  so if that was the intention of the artist he should go read his history . 
  schindler 's list is also just a movie.tell me how would you like if he farted grenades out of his ass and killed the nazis to save the jews . 
  titanic is also just a movie.tell me how would you like it if jack used the full 100 % of his brain to telepathically move the ship to land saving everyone . 
  when the premise of a movie is the the real world , we expect real world laws of nature . 
  when we go to fantasy land , like the marvel universe or middle earth , we except consistency with * their * predefined laws . 
  if * they * break those predefined laws ( gandalf shoots sauron with a m1 ) , we * still * loose suspension of disbelief even in the land of elves .

  [ betty boop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcmifctvt2w ) was a raunchy cartoon from the 20s-30s for example . 
  it is part of the human psyche , and we did n't have it earlier in music , cinema and tv not because of tastes , but antiquated moral guardians . 
  its not deterioration , its freedom.but freedom does not equal quality . 
  as a final note , the video you referred is extremely tame compared with what it is [ out there right now ( !! nsfw !!!,

  or the completely idiotic eu4 system where you can annex 99 % of their lands but not their capital province ... and usually adding vassalization shoots war score over 100 % so you ca n't do both.and by the time you can declare war again to get that last province they are allied with france and austria .

  star trek is not a kids show ? 
  i really thought it was some soft sci fi adventure aimed towards teens and younger.surely its silliness ca n't compare it with 2001 . 
  twice . 
  i fail to see how it can be hard scifi when most technology is there for a plot point and mostly explained in a vague way . maybe during the 60s ? . 
  it has a lot more common with pulp and space opera to my opinion . 
   unless of course you think that stuff is for teens and younger , also . 
  that was not a derogatory comment , it was an opinion . 
  so how it is somehow less kid friendly in comparison with doctor who , a `` kid friendlier '' show according to op , when it shares the same roots as star trek ? 
  both are sf from the sixties using a `` fantasy '' plot devise ( tardis , warp ) to visit different setting every episode . 
  most episodes are of `` monster of the week '' format , with social commentary underneath . 
  i am talking about the status of the series now . 
  both started as sf shows who were heavily influenced from the 60s ( so they got the science both wrong ) , just one took itself more seriously than the other . 
  nowadays both are more serious and gritty compared with their conceptions and their basic target groups are 20 's to 30 year olds , yet one still is for `` kids '' according to some . 
  star trek uses fantasy science , and because it is from the 60 's it is excused , but doctor who is n't ? 
  what is the fundamental difference between star treks transporters and the tardis ? 
  picards spandex is more serious than the doctors bowtie ?!, 
  i am not saying star trek is a kids show , unless doctor who is also one .

  its accidentally realistic . 
  street lamps are designed to get cut when hit by cars to lower the damage to the vehicle and passengers . 
  plants with 5 feet deep roots are not . 
  edit : i accidentally replied to the parent comment about fences instead of the one with the bushes.get over it . 
  also fences are supposed to be as robust as possible by definition doofy . 
  original comment was about bushes . 
  maybe those plants created-evolved for millions of years surviving ice ages , meteorites and heat wave , so they can be the perfect , ultimate form to exterminate the douchbags with extra mind breaking loud exhausts . 
  checkmate . 
  well ... obviously . 
  hey cant say i am disappointing . 
  somehow this is my 5th highest comment . 
  i knew reading factoids from cracked will get me something someday . 
  not every streetlamp is build like this . 
  i am already mildly disappointed with the game , imagine this happening on my first game .
