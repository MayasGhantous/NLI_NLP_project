  i really cant see what all the ruckus is about . 
  needs more blue scarf . 
  [ picard says it best .

  it is . 
  if your buildings are at least 1 tile next to each other prepare to get burned to the ground . 
  from my case wells or anything is useless . 
  yeah i know them . 
  i think those and trees , jokes aside , have cost a lot of lives . 
  lucky you!it seems i was hit by a bug . 
  touche . 
  if the paramedics who cleaned up afterwards noticed it was a slow wound , a coroner could estimate the time the victim was wounded and you would be prosecuted . 
  prosecuted for a 5 months and 29 days kidnapping, 
  we are so deep in the uncanny valley i can see aki 's dead eyes looking at me . 
  the crime was committed before violence is sanctioned.if i shot you just before you left with an airplane for another country ( and jurisdiction ) i will still got arrested regardless where , when and if you died . . 
  most of these venues were `` approved '' by the same politicians that fudged the country 's debt numbers but now are trying to bring the `` lazy '' greeks in line with germany 's blessing . 
  i really hope you are not a christian . 
  anything from that emulator ?

  edit : i am not the original creator . 
  i really liked it , but i thought the reds as the `` villains '' of the story . 
  a rock is a rock , we can do whatever we want with it . 
   but `` this is stupid , '' `` squad this idea was horrible , '' `` the devs are out of touch and i hope a mod fixes this , '' are not constructive . 
  i should add that these `` criticisms '' exist for finished games also , they just apply to patches/dlcs/expansions / sequels . 
  the players will never be 100 % satisfied . 
  and the `` alpha stage '' is used not only by the devs to cover any shortcomings , but by the players also . '', 
  the games is not finished , i bet you can add x , y , z stuff to the game '' , ignoring how production cycles work . 
   the fallout games were built on a foundation of wacky bullshit from the very beginning, 
  no they were n't . 
  fo1 was a very sober experience apart from the science !, 
  stuff and some funny ester eggs that were very hard to find . 
  case in point , junkyard would go to hell in the end if you chose to support the `` good guys '' originally , but they changed it because it was considered too cynical even for that game . 
  each and every town you visited had ruthless scum ruling over people trying to survive , and some few nice guys trying to hold the line , and it was played as something awful , not `` republic of dave '' silliness . 
  the brotherhood would not give a fuck about the other `` less advanced '' people , the vaults were not experiments , but simply safe heavens that the overseers ruled with a despotic hand for your `` safety '' when they did n't collapse from greed and mismanagement and the master was a guy with a good goal in mind but with terrible execution ( genocide ) that you got to watch in real time as towns you saved got slaughtered one by one . 
  after chris avellone took the helm in fo2 , the silliness went up though the roof , pop culture jokes were everywhere ( scientelogists and tom cruise expys ? 
  40 's styles gangsters with fedoras?vault 69 ? 
  come on ! ) . 
  f3 took those and run until f : nv turned around . 
  you are an excellent person . 
  if only my glorious coa did n't got fucked when i change religion . 
  shitty dlc is shitty . 
  to clarify for everyone :, 
  the guy on the right side is a time traveler that meets all his potential fathers ( yes they are all male , japan is japan ) hence the hair color change that matches the individuals fathers hair . 
  every father is upset . 
  except henry . 
  boohoo i have an upper class white collar job . 
   i really think it 's ~ ~ human ~ ~ ** nature ** to adopt a pack mentality . 
  i am a lurker on this subreddit . 
  from what i have seen , there is a pervasive notion that you should leave the forest as untouched as possible.sometimes it goes to overkill and hysteria.think vegetarians -  vegans -  crazy vegans . 
  so the [ music of the spheres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/musica_universalis ) is real ? 
  even if the space marines do not , the [ imperial cult , ] ( http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/imperial_cult ) the only sancionated religion in the entire imperium , should attack them as heretics , or the marines should attack for pervasing his message . 
  bjorn the fellhanded is a dreadnought that survives from time of the emperor a highly revered member of the space wolves.they even wake him up to hear his stories . 
  how do you think he would react when he personaly knew the primachs ? 
  i am sorry i was in mobile and i had no idea how to . 
  back to rectify that !, 
  ahh thank you . 
  so the `` vile heretic '' mindset is mostly from the imperial administration side , not the astartes ( well except when they deal with chaos ) . 
  you basically gave a better breakdown of my question . 
  particularly this point :, 
   ironically , the imperium would call that heresy . 
  thank you for your reply.any fluff i can get my hands on describing this ? 
  excellent!thank you !, 
  its surprisingly ... clean . 
  there are already thousands of people already with digital fingerprints everywhere that are not with us anymore . 
  chances are that for a very famous archived post in reddit from 2-3 years ago , a small * percentage * are dead people . 
  its the anus . 
  if it is enema , it still very clean . 
  if it something other `` deeper '' operation , i do n't want to know what makes our intestines look squeaky clean all the way up . 
  whoa there cowboy . 
  while the xcom series have their legendary status firmly in their grasp , this is mostly due to the original games . 
  now do n't think i am one of those old geezers that think `` older are better '' , its simply that the first ones where tremendously innovative ( they had destructible terrains , in the 90 's ! ), 
  , unique and quite enjoyable for their time , making them quite memorable for the collective consciousness . 
  xcom : eu on the other hand while a great game for its generation , has not so far created ripples outside its players , either as a fandom or as a product in the industry.add to that unfortunately it is a `` remake/sequel '' , well it is an uphill battle . 
  there are very , very few games that overshot their famous predecessors , and usually they are a tremendous blast n the industry.think skyrim , half life 2 , world of warcraft etc etc. 
  in conclusion , xcom : eu by itself will not become a classic because the xcom series are already considered classics . 
  it will be a part of it , but not the super star of the team . 
  shoot one of two guys in a room without the other noticing : fantasy . 
  shoot from an open window at a busy street without anyone know where it came from?reality . 
  with a whispering calm voice :, 
  `` death ... is all around us ... '', 
  suddenly screams :, 
  `` this . . * ( chop ) * is . . 
  * ( chop ) *** terrifying ** !, 
  prediction : reddit will turn to a legit news source agency . 
  no sarcasm . 
  how do you feel now about this post ? 
   nowdays they barely even pay you your legal salary and security . 
  * nowdays * ? 
  while i have no experience , i think shotguns have pretty decent range depending on ammo.its not like video games.you can get in a van , park across a very wide street , open the doors , empty the shotgun withe very good chance to get your target and leave with none the wiser . 
  what are the chances for nuclear holocaust in the immediate weeks ? 
  any source ? 
  i want to bet all my money and bail . . 
  ans we have a winner :, 
  you can see he pulls the bicycle with his stuck foot when he climbs .

  df adventure mode in a nutshell ? 
  a better dynastic/individual modelling for dynasties dlc for euiv would be even more awesome . 
  as i have said , i have found this guide .
