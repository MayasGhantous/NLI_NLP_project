  try it . 
  nothing . 
  i have played ksp since 0.14 . 
  i have never been outside kerbal unless you count a * very * high flyby of duna on an unplanned interstellar trip to nowhere . the game need indicators for numbers badly . 
  even the basic ones like apoapsis and inclination are not readily available for gods shake . 
  apollo was not flying using eyeball mk2 people.well except the 13th one . 
  too bad only the master race will be able to see it . 
  same here.everyone took a break for coffee once per shift . 
  unless he is a 16 y.o. , i think a visit to the doctor in the next 2-7 days can clear some things up . 
  once i went to a store with my girl . 
  she know i hated shopping in that particular place , so we agreed that since we just wanted a couple of things i would stay outside and wait . 
  i take some phone calls to pass time , and after 20 mins i get inside to find my girlfriend that has spontaneously decided to buy much much more ( typical and expected ) than planned . 
  as i get bored , i left her on her own devices and i simply stroll around the isles . 
  eventually , she decides we have enough money carnage and we proceed to the cashier . 
  after we pay and we are about to exit , enter hardcore security guy . 
  he grabs my backpack , looks me in the eye and demands to open it . 
  my internet training of reading this `` he cant do nofing '' advice all over immediately sets my do n't - tread-on-me-fu on overdrive and as i clash my gorgeous eyes with his , i sternly reply `` of course , if you call the cops to check '' . 
  he freezes and i simply leave , putting my awesome rayban glasses , hugging my girl and basking at the slightly-less-bored look of the cashier . 
  its better simply not to find a car . 
  they can get you from half a fingerprint . 
  if they cant id the car you can get it further than ditching it 200 meters from the hit place and get caught from a dropped burger receipt . 
  there are a lot of people that do n't need he insurance . 
  capitalism !, 
  florist/planner here . 
  you cant even imagine how a good / bad decoration can effect the mood . 
  for those that do n't know it yet , [ u/unidan ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/unidan ) has been caught and shadow banned for vote fudging , possibly for years . 
  more info on [ this ] ( http://en.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/2c5cxa/unidan_shadowbanned_after_jackdaw_kerflufle/ ) thread from / r/subredditdrama . 
  i think the atrocity is too much for obi-wan to even say a word . 
  reddit is by definition , a full attention whore area . 
  it is the equivalent of the ancient [ agora ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agora ) , where sycophants , philosophers , artists , the general public and traders of questionable quality met every day to discuss/argue/cause mayhem . 
  [ there was safe here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/619v7 ) in reddit that when it was opened it had a live grenade in the place someone who wants to open it with a blowtorch will get to . 
  i think a gas mask would be slightly ineffective against a grenade exploding 10 inches from your face . 
  considering that even a small piece of the safe to hit you would be like a bullet , plus you will probably using a blowtorch , so you will have close by even ** more ** explosives , do you really need to ask ? 
  also a lot of people prefer the human interaction.and the the dvd is actually `` plug and play '' while torrents can be shite considering ploblems especially for obscure movies . 
  it has parts , air resistance , `` weather hazards '' and other fun stuff !, 
  it will help you scratch that itch, 
  hmm getting ruthlessly and inexplicably downvoted ... 
  but but ... i only wanted to help those stuck at work like me ... 
  if you are stuck in a 2003 pc like me it is more than enough.and for a space themed flash game a very good creation . 
  i would never make comparisons between ksp and this . 
  its about a wacky space theme little game with parts , resources , staging and weight restrictions.that people can play if they ca n't play ksp . 
  while strictly speaking it is against the rules , it is not untied to the theme of the subreddit . 
   this game sucks . 
  but it sucks well . 
  wait when you reach the black holes ... 
   early access and kickstarter, 
  there are both new concepts in the market . 
  give them time . 
  and remember that a lot of aaa companies ( sim city?spore ) deceived customers and you did n't even have a demo before you paid full price . 
  if the mods find it unnecessary they will remove it . 
  glorious !, 
  they fixed it !, 
  the little thing is not that the parthenon is there.the little thing is that it looks almost complete , as it should be in that era , before the venetians [ blowed it sky high ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parthenon#destruction ) and the british finishing the job later . 
  even 100 years would be a huge breakthrough . 
  it is feasible with generation ships . 
  it takes some ( minuscule ) time for the signals from your sensory organs to get to the brain , processed and acted upon.so whatever you see , smell , and perceive is the ** past ** . 
  radiation , supplies , human psychology ( imagine get stuck with another 6 people in a locked house for 2 years.it will be even worse ) and ultimately , profit . 
  unless there is sustainable profit to be made from getting to other planets , there is little incentive for companies/governments to mass fund the science needed . 
  but with this , if it is not bullshit , it would be like discovering the steam engine while we are using triremes . 
  that means that the state is not spending aka inflation . 
  yup . 
   some accounts say that alexander 's cavalry crushed the famous sacred band of thebes , ** but modern scholars doubt it . 
  some sources please ? 
  thebes was one of the great powers of the time , and the sacred band was their elite force so i highly doubt they were n't present in chaeronea . 
  or is it doubtful alexander himself crashed them ? 
  also after crushing them , he tried to merge the two cultures with less than desired results unfortunately . 
  he even wed an eastern bride . 
  i think that is easy to get proven/disprove . 
  since we know the general position of each unit in the battlefield , we can discern with a certain plausibility if it is true or not . 
  man what a train wreck of a movie ... 
  who thought collin farrel had the stature to portray a guy with with some of the greatest balls in human history ? 
  who thought [ this ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01495/alexander-the-grea_1495284c.jpg ) bleached perm buffoon was a great idea ? 
   the sacred band was definitely destroyed at chaeronea . 
  the remains of 254 men , believed to be them , were found in a mass grave . 
  i would know , i live 50 km from there in thebes  . 
  it okay i just wanted to clarify if you questioned the bands destruction . 
  my personal speculation is that alexander was with the vaunted macedonian calvary , and he might took the fame of destroying the sacred band after the fact , to bolster his military prowess legend retroactively , either by him , or his fans . 
  i an living in thebes ( hence the reddit name ) . 
  the town is literally choke full of ancient stuff underground , so much so that every new building usually gets delayed due to artifacts found . 
  a guy i know started building a hotel only to get permanent stopped because they discovered an ancient temple of hercules that might be positioned on his supposed home . 
  the home of goddamn hercules man . 
  it is overwhelming sometimes . 
  that was a hiroshima-level burn . 
  paradox interactive is extremely polite then.they give me no 's by the bucket . 
  ahh the swedish . 
  thank you !, 
  from blocket i can-t understand if the m\u00e5nadsavgift is indeed what it says for some apartments/rooms . 
  it seems so low . 
  and the arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen has english translations only in its home page , not in its listings . 
  i will have to crash course my swedish !, 
  that is what he said . 
  what?what ? 
  nooooooooooo ... 
  til is cheaper to buy an apartment than rent it . 
   unless ~ ~ 5e ~ ~ the dm makes ressurection and other such spells much , much , much harder to get or almost non existant . 
   ten ridiculous lawsuits against big business, 
  ... that failed . 
  yes they where that badass , that is the reason nobody challenged them into a land war for centuries . their rivals the athenians lost the area outside athens walls pretty fast during the peloponnesian war , and they thought their navy will help them survive . 
  but a plague from overpopulation of athens due to the siege and a ( ironically , persian paid ) spartan navy ended that notion . 
  until sparta stagnated and thebes finally fucked them up .
