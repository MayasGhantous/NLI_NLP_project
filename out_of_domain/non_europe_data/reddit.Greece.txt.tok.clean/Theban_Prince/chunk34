  its the spiritual predecessor of game of thrones , spartacus etc. 
  awesome series . 
  did he purposely massacred millions of zoroastrians ? 
  or he just played the persian game of empire building better than the persians ? 
  dude i think he meant the `` greeks '' as the `` independent greek cities . '', 
   ( that 's not designed for it ), 
  the mjonir is specially designed to be thrown . 
  so he is right . 
  the first season is the best . 
  the second season is good , but the protagonists take a backseat as the spotlight goes to octavian and marcus antonius and the historical accuracy is looser . 
  absolutely no greek elements in egypt for example . 
  its a sub law of godwin 's , when the word alexander is typed , the probability for shit to be unleashed approaches 100 % . 
  i am a greek from macedonia , so this is a touchy issue for me also , but the guy had the response copy pasted . 
  i hope at least . 
  ahhh two out of two , i am set there . 
  is there a problem if i have past experience of ignoring traffic laws in my own country ? 
  will this create problems since i will be used to a certain patern , and ignoring a complete new set of laws could create a cultural clash ? 
  ahhh yes . 
  i might help those poor africans by using my obvious wealth and superior intellect to get better lives . 
  an i hear there are some good looking fishermen villages along the coast with great scenery . 
  thank you !, 
  if it is possible to send me a draft so i can get some example of what clicks with scandinavians?our cultures sound quite different on first approach from what i have read in this sub . 
  no personal info of course !, 
  i am worried because of the slandering campaign a few years ago . 
  i am paying my taxes people!that is why i want to leave !, 
  ahh the long debate that really has no connection . 
  greek then was not a unified nation . 
  it was patchwork of city states , and further slit by two different populations , the dorian and ionians . 
  it was common for those time to call the other non greek , since barbarians were looked down upon . 
  for example , thebes , my hometown , was called persian lackey for centuries because they sided with the persian during the invasion . 
  so unless we have a macedonian source to call themselves something other than greek you are welcomed to present it . 
  if it is from athenian or theban sources , then it is war propaganda . 
  i was thinking opening a nice business abroad . 
  since i am a tourism employee , i was thinking a fast food joint with , hold on your chair , will have ramadan specials !, 
  with happy hour between 9 am and 6 pm !, 
  it will be smashing !, 
  i am an asshole . 
  problem ? 
  god i want a fist fight so much right now !, 
  thank you . 
  ahh thank you very much . 
  it is very assuring !, 
  i have no idea who tony stewart , what is that racing type calle dor anything . 
  what i saw was some dude in a dark uniform , getting out of his car and running towards cars that were running with extreme speed . 
  he was a dumbass . 
  exactly . 
  it is like going on a shooting range in front of someone who is shooting and startling him . 
  he might pull they trigger from his surprise , but to think anyone would accuse him of murder ... 
  opens page, 
  * no mass effect dlcs, 
  closes page, 
  thats not something nobody said it here . 
  most people confirm that the proper thing to do is to hit the gas at that point to maintain control . 
  crusader kings 2 baby . 
  i will maybe stop only if a new version comes up . 
  i think it is not an origin problem , but a bioware problem . 
  its a greek region.it would be like calling my greek girl appalachia . 
  nickelodeon product . 
  i am humbled . 
  thank you !, 
  or greece ... 
  castrate , blind enslave and sacrifice their whole families to the gods , then take their heir and merry them to their sworn enemies for 20 gold . 
  and after you have done all this then take them out of the oubliette , castrate them and blind them too and send them to the night 's watch to live the rest of their lives . 
  he is the king.realistically , kings do n't care about their excuses . 
  do n't hear what the others are telling you !, 
  they are misinforming you when you are probably dealing with a life threatening situation . 
  i mean , voice control grenades ? 
  seriously ?!, 
  the proper way to deal with unstable explosives , such as a grenade after the pin has been removed , is not to try to reinsert the pin . 
  the [ timed fuse ] ( http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/grenade-delay.gif ) has been armed , so it would ** not ** stop the explosion . 
  throwing it is ** not ** a solution either , since a ) you do n't know if some innocent bystander gets hit and b ) even if you throw it you might get hit by the flying shrapnel anyway . 
  so the proper solution is what is called '' [ ** thermo chemical diffusion ** ] ( http://www.wpi.edu/pubs/etd/available/etd-042213-192913/unrestricted/ywei.pdf ) '' , what that means is you have to heat up the grenade , so the chemicals inside undergo exothermic reaction , changing their composition and making them inert . 
  now do n't go and put the grenade in a fire , the extreme change of temperature will probably cause an explosion . 
  it should be gradual and the explosive should be kept around body temperature . 
  since precise temperatures are difficult to maintain , and finding an electronic thermometer with a grenade in your hand can be a tad difficult , the [ ** socom manual ** ] ( http://www.gamesegment.com/ps2/instructions.cfm/id/7795735 ) states that troopers in the field can use their own body to keep a warm , stable temperature , with the preferable procedure been to put the live grenade between the [ gluteal muscles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buttocks ) , since it is a body part that will keep it both stable and warm , and then simply wait until the grenade is inert and safe . 
  hope i helped you !, 
  hey dude , we are nobles , not some 12 year olds playing xbox . 
  i love it . 
  i find it better to watch a rugged british soldier shooting out with a german over dunkirk in a game that is very thin on the visual aspect . 
  plus i do n't have to learn how to read goddamn nato approved counters . 
  there were always models since day 1 in paradox games . 
  casual newbie . 
  i want a holocaust game . 
  a proper , serious game were you never know when you are going to get picked for the furnaces . 
  and if you die , you * ca n't * reload the game . 
  edit : stupid i forgot the `` ca n't '' . 
  mate it is common courtesy to underline the point of interest . 
  yes !, 
  its the sun in the middle i think.on closer zoom it will probably look better . 
  more like the soviet union on the far upper right corner . 
  hey i have 25 years left !, 
   the thing is , lucas has always intended star wars to be for kids . 
  [ uncle owen and aunt beru beg to differ .

   particularly that stretch armstrong fight scene ? 
  that was almost enough to make me turn it off and never go back to it, 
  it is supposed to be cringey . 
  remember that in the end he would not need to get over all that stuff if he was n't daydreaming and have heard his mother . 
  thor would be better . 
  he is a danish general in frikking ** memel ** and op is playing the ** ottomans ** .
