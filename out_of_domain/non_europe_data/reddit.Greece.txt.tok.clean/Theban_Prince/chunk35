  the title implies that something happened to ruin his game in the first 10 years . 
  the `` game '' ( a really shitty name for a media that is much much more ) could be that you have to survive , not get noticed by the ss , try to save your family members that can be picked random etc. 
  admittedly it needs godly level of writing not to make a monstrosity . 
  [ i will also like to add that if comic books can pull it off with maus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maus ) , `` video games '' can do it also . 
   you find yourself singing the star spangled banner in the shower, 
  edit : scratch that , it actually was [ la marseillaise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k1q9ntcr5g ) . 
  baguettes anyone ? 
  gg is usually used in online games after you lost with the victor replying the same . 
  and even then , really , an allied general ( allies in eu4 are so trustworthy right ? ), 
  that helps in a single war , warrants the `` i won this game '' reaction ? 
  edit : whoa there vote brigades !, 
   if you get lucky you can either become ** a favorite of the guards ** and ** be treated well or maybe you can stage a possible prison riot and fight for freedom or you can wait for rescue ** . 
  you are in a good path but too much hope . 
  [ the chances of survival should be realistic . ], 
  ( http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/holocaust/h-statistics.htm ) :(, 
  real faces with names running on the background . 
  also he game could start with music and color in pre-war poland and they become scarcer and scarcer as things get worse . 
  we are here to help . 
  would you like to know more ? 
  oh yes chances of survival should be present , but each game should have that 7 % chance of living as in real life . 
  well you know what they say about artists and their deaths . 
  its extremely difficult , and mostly to not let outside interference to mess with your game . 
  but i do n't think it is impossible . 
  that is some serious doublethink there . 
  there were a lot of people itching to fight the nazis at that time . 
  maybe not the majority , but a lot . 
  and i bet some knew that war was inevitable , so the smiles could be from knowing something bad is coming , and when it is here you relax for an instant because the waiting is over at least . 
  compare this with a direct civilian attack out of the blue with live coverage of the bodies falling ( something that those reporters did not have then ) and you will find your comparison moot . 
  about your second point . 
  it is not difficult to add content . 
  the difficult part is not breaking the site , especially the `` beautiful part '' . 
  the creator of you site had probably gave you standard easy procedure . 
  two crusades in the price of one !, 
  still way way , better than the official [ dota ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gvfioti.jpg ) map that it is essentially greece pasted over itself . 
  my message was slowly rising for 5 hours . 
  at +5 it fall to -4 in 5 minutes . 
  right . 
  greek actually . 
   the latin is ivdaea, 
   welcome to the beautiful world of [ greeklish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeklish ), 
  i leave what i typed as a response originally then i stopped . 
  i realized i was wrong . 
  chinese in the mediterranean . 
  that is so fucking paradox !, 
  excellent reply!thank you !, 
   the perspective of those who have to deal with the costs of war are almost never explored in gaming . 
  or you know , war as it * is * and not a glorified paintball as they present it . 
  can you imagine a squad tactical game ( with permanent saves/iron man ) weer you are a squad leader , you command your team , there are no resource gain , no territory gains , just a stream of nonsensical missions from hq and the point for the `` game '' is to save as many squad mates as possible from the campaign start to finish . 
  but the dangers for your team are not only enemies , but ptsd , suicides , fragging , drugs , court martial ... 
  the last games screen will be a list with who you lost , not who you saved . 
  the smaller the better . 
  come on indies , i just thought this !, 
  you can do a better job !, 
   but some people might even go so far to call this `` glorification of war '' , by leaving out an ugly part you dont like and only putting in the `` awesome '' parts . 
  i do . 
  hey guys its okay to simulate early nuclear weapons ( awesome ! ), 
  but do n't mention the holocaust or the bomb victims !, 
  meh , paradox threads are the only place i get downvoted . 
  it reaches cult like status of `` everything is great or else '', 
  i buy cosmetic dlc if and only i will be active around the area . 
  for example , will i be playing an anglosaxon game for the following weeks ? 
  then i buy the cosmetic dlcs . 
  problem , solved . 
  you definitely should spare a couple of hours at most to read it . 
  i think you are brewing one good df creepypasta here . . 
  yeah i can see the salvation everywhere . 
  [ look all those exstatic japanese civilians !, 
  i noticed in this video you have cops acting like assholes , being indifferent , trigger-happy , nice , funny , slightly bored ... 
  whoa whoa whoa ... 
  * ... are cops people ? 
  well carladian men cant jump . . 
  thank god . 
  there were some very good stories . 
  but also many bad canon defilements . 
  also i hate the whole `` the emperor was a ruthless tyrant because extra galactic alien invaders '' . 
  cant for once a dick be simply a dick ? 
  he is a sith lord and a tyrant for decades . 
  if someone should be a dick 100 % it should be him . 
  well in a work of fiction of course . 
  i want a new story with the new crop of jedi padawans training , stumbling on a dark side plot , fucking up and the old school guys come and save them . 
  if some of the new padawans are luke 's and leia 's child , i do n't mind if it does n't hijack the story . . 
  i want to but i am broke !, 
  thats because they are so overused on the extended material and the new trilogy . 
  remember in the original we had only an old guy that died halfway , a half assed padawan and a dyslexic muppet . 
  the only cool ones where the evil . 
   well jeez , now he can get a job at a ** burn ** center after you sent him there . 
   ironically , they 'd say he does n't have relevant ** degree . 
  well it like harry potter . 
  they have trolls , dragons , even different countries with wizards . 
  but would it be really be a `` harry potter '' movie without harry potter ? 
  i think the exploration of the universe is best left in additional media . 
  there we agree , i want a game/book where jedi and the force are rumors/legends . 
  he is popular precisely because he is a bad ass normal on a galaxy full of space wizards . 
   could have mass forced conversion . 
  this.this this this . 
  i am tired not being able to conquer that friggin norse and force them to kiss the cross . 
  plus you can force only the king to actually become christian/muslim just like it does with your priest now . 
  he has to ask/force his vassal to convert with potential uprisings that you need to help him put down . 
   it does n't have the steroids and other shit you get from farmed and processed food . 
  i hope your swamp is not downriver any big farms mate .
