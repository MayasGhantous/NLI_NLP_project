  edit : for those that got shitty pitchforks , some pitchforks so you can pitchfork-hunt the pitchfork giver :, 
  what the ... 
  you can never leave jorahs head . 
  friendly suggestions that are told in low voice so they do n't piss the security council . 
  i actually love the circlejerk because i laugh with the over the top reactions of some members and i play the `` guess the poe 's law '' game to pass time . 
  however this meme hits me a little bit harder because i am a store employee and believe me the shitty `` i think i know everything '' costumers are many more than the other away around . 
  have you thought that you have to detain everyone in a shooter scenario so they do n't start panicking and running around in the middle of a possible shootout ? 
  [ it was reported by mainstream media and the littleton police issued an official statement . 
  happy now ?

  they did n't vanish . 
  while they lost a lot of soil they are now the country of turkey . 
  they are focusing on cultures , not political entities . 
  that 's why there is a russia but not ussr . 
   imagine a constant +20 to all your vassals opinion, 
  but that can go lower if you assasinate and get caught or imprison a member of the dynasty , even if it is a legal imprisoment . 
  well for mexico you cant have every single country , and `` famous '' ( well according to firaxis at least ) empires understandably take precedence . 
  the british are best as english so you can add scottish or welsh if you like . 
  ultimately it is arbitrary as all works of art . 
  ahhh reminds me national geographic , the / r/gonewild for baby boomers,

  what if up votes/down votes are akin to 1s and 0s on a super computer brain ? 
  with redditors being the synapses ? 
  when clooney was left to drift i wanted to scream !,

  you have an infinite area , not possibilities . 
  imagine having 2 pieces of lego in infinite numbers . 
  you have a endless supply of blocks , but the possible combinations are way way more limited . 
  the year is 2014 . you are in an island in the middle of the pacific with stone age tools . 
  you have n't seen anyone coming from outside the island , nor have received any replies to your tribal drums you play each night . 
  the witch doctor proclaims `` if there are other people out there , surely they would have contacted us by now . '' . 
  we have explored shit from our universe . 
  there might be a interplanetary war 20 light years away and we have very very limited chance to detect it . 
  until we have explored a very big part of the universe fermi can eat his papers . 
  let me help you . 
  one commenter uses `` infinite '' as a unit of measurement ( infinite kilometers ) the other uses `` infinite '' as a statistical unit ( infinite combinations ) . 
  imagine having infinite coins . 
  you can drop as many as you like , you will get either `` head '' or `` tails '' , but never `` elephant '' , `` cat '' or `` jackdaw '' no matter what . 
  i accidentally turned of the power in a store i worked and we found the alarm dead after 30 hours . . 
  instead of stopping the blade , blocking the lightsabers would make them short circuit crack and fizzle , and turn off for microseconds hence no damage . 
  a successful hit would vibrate the controller . 
  fixed . 
  i would prefer dynastic relations ( think capulets and montagues in romeo & juliet ) than cadet branches . 
  and yet they still have it as `` byzantine empire '', 
  it is an event chain . 
  i am talking about a game mechanic like how character relations are now . 
  a small canon defilement is nothing if you want this awesome game to exist without exosceletons as others suggested . 
  we are . 
  as others pointed out unless you specificaly know where to look it is impossible to find anything . 
  we cant even see planets more that amall dots in close systems , much less the billions of other stars or millions of other galaxies arounds us . 
  and then you have the unobservable universe ... 
  thank god i was worried . 
  it is inevitable for every subreddit . 
  [ sturgeon 's law ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/sturgeonslaw ), 
  in the thumbnail you will notice it is the [ m&b loading screen ] ( http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/435311-mount-blade-warband-windows-screenshot-loading-screens.jpg ) with two riders charging at each other . 
  they replaced it with the chariot . 
  edit : linked the screen, 
  well sudetenland/ossetia , austria/sevastopol ... you cant blame them ... 
  7 years in batman . 
   seeing imaginary hitlers, 
  no of course not they are not hitlers . 
  they are n't going to invade poland , nor bomb london . 
  but are they overaggressive sociopaths that think they can push everyone around because they have the army to do so ? 
  like hitler was ? 
  yes , yes they where . 
  this is exactly what i mean , hitler was not unique and that 's why we must remain ever vigilant . 
  i thought it was so obvious i didnt even have to mention it . . 
  every single individual outside the enclave and the vaults are mutated by radiation and/or fev . 
  for the enclave to succeed , it needs genocide of epic propotions , and all that so an archaic , jingoist , xenophobic society can rise again , which by the hints the game gives had a much larger role on ending the world than any multicultural society . 
  i just started watching classic doctor who . 
  the very first episode available starts with the companion wandering off in a tomb and getting everyone in a mess with the aztecs . 
  this is the 6th episode ever , in black and white with the first doctor . 
  so yeah . 
  idiocy is a staple of the series . 
  previous post had the wrong link.fixed . 
  for star wars , no , since i see them as a fantasy movie ( you did n't complain when the fellowship of the ring did n't die from exposure or hypoxia when riding the eagles , did you ? ), 
  but for movies that are supposedly realistic like gravity ... gahh !, 
  so among a hundred excellent games , some that are exclusive to pc , you noticed the one that it was n't good . 
  i counted 4 games that originated from consoles ( that 's 4 % ! ), 
  and yet they deserve to be there because they are awesome nevertheless and available to pc . 
  this is is not 1999 . 
  internet is not the ` new '' thing . 
  any adult worth his damn should know by now that digital photos can be either electronically stolen or usually shared by an angry ex . 
  moreso if you are famous . 
  it has happened again and again . 
  getting naked photos on a cell phone in 2014 and getting freaked when they get released is inane . 
  i am not saying it is moral , but i am not going to feel guilty also . 
  should i feel told ? 
  because your `` correction '' describes my thoughts exactly . 
  anything you type/post on a digital device is open for anyone . 
  when 4chan was doxxing animal abusers left and right or sex tapes where so widely spread they got official releases , we had a good laugh . 
  now we are prudes . 
  these days ? 
  celebrity sex tapes have been around at least since [ 1988 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rob_lowe#sex_tape_controversy ) . 
  if you need to close the blinds to record something , then do n't record it at all,
