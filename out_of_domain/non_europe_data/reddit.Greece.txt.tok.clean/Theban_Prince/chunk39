  it was a honest bro flick with new fresh an talented faces . 
  as a script it was nothing original , but it was shameless fun for those that like that kind of humor . 
  then they tried to make it a super mega hollywood franchise . 
  imagine if ferris bueller 's day off got sequels . 
  fairly known inside the us , virtually unknown outside the borders . 
  it is the later that distinguishes aaa actors from the others . 
  the script is a copy-paste of [ dude where is my car ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dude,_where's_my_car%3f ) ( just read the synopsis ! ), 
  and other such comedies . 
  when they hit it big , mostly because of the talent of the actors , they just kept pressing ctrl + v to print money aka sequels . 
  they copied the copy . 
  if someone gave the man a good script . 
  as a rule of thumb , anything recorded digitally requires very very extensive effort to permanently delete it . 
  there have been cases of burned discs being recoverable . 
  if it is online , it is close to impossible , because copies of it stay on various servers , so even if you burn your pc / cell phone it wont matter . 
  do not post online something you would be ashamed if someone post it all over your city lampposts . 
  it is the same . 
  the internet is not wild west , its a [ swarm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swarm_behaviour ) . 
  if you get noticed , and the proper parameters exist , you create a point of interest for other swarm members to congregate . 
  as this happens , it expands the point of interest , attracting even more of the swarm reaching critical levels and it is unstoppable due to [ positive feedback ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/positive_feedback ) . 
  essentially you come under attack by [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/jpe00a6b9ty?t=28s ) , and you have no guns . 
   who frowned me this face, 
  yes , yes , there have been good lines . 
  but the overall episode stories are rubbish . 
  come on , a fantastic voyage ripoff ? 
  really ? 
   exactly . 
  if i decide to mail a friend and that mail is somehow intercepted , it surely is n't my fault , even though i could have put a stronger seal on the envelope or something . 
  take the same example , and replace your friend with military contractors , and mail with weapon plans . 
  what would your reaction be if they mailed it and got stolen by enemy spies ? 
  would you call the spies out as a voyeuristic celebrity culture, 
  security should be proportionate to what is the subject . 
  you do n't need to be afraid about your mail , because nobody cares about it . 
  but nudes have more value , so you should take precautions , and a celebrity should do it tenfold because a great amount of money/prestige gets in the equation . 
  well blameless they are . 
  a crime is a crime . 
  but i cant stand all the `` how did they do that!why would some stole nudes!evil evil !! omg !!, 
  ! 11 '' thing going on . 
  people that rush to center cannon in alderaan . 
  all alone vs 5 imperials . 
  and then the next one does it , and the next one ... [ an endless stream of idiots . 
  ] ( http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view7/4293841/lemming-drop-o.gif\\ ) ), 
  after watching that apache video , people exploding is not fun . . 
   we do not allow links on reddit to * child * pornography or images which sexualize * children * . 
  holy fuck !, 
  i read this sentence again and again these days , pictures depicting underage people is not always child pornography . 
  edit : i do n't think it should be permitted , but comparing a 17 years old taking nude pictures with child pornography is trivializing the concept . 
  they have already forced / r/thefappening not to post pictures of underage people . 
  everyone was cool since everybody understood what a a fine line reddit walked . 
  and then they decided to go full corporate . 
  that door is where i gave up . 
  there is something called unguided bomb . 
  it only needs gravity to function . 
  now [ carpet bomb ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phzry0ddrxk ) diagon alley and have fun watching wizards trying to apparate a couple of bombs out of hundreds . 
  espionage . 
  if humanity goes all total war , what stops the secret service kidnapping a muggle borns family and blackmailing him to insert operatives at the secret locations ? 
  after that they can use simple tricks like the position of the sun and stars to pinpoint their location and then bomb it from afar . 
  the realization that out logic does not apply to a force ( god ) that it is outside our universe 's laws . 
  for example , the omnipotent paradox `` could an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it ? '', 
  can be answered with mathematical `` yes '' . 
  he can create something that breaks logic . 
  that is the * essence * of omnipotence !, 
  yup . 
  that is why for the question `` who would win '' the answer is '' whoever had a head start '' . 
  both sides have devastating weapons ( humanity sheer firepower , wizards ultimate subterfuge ) that it all depends who initiates hostilities first so has time to gather intel and understand the other side . 
  the harry potter * movies * were mainstream . 
  the harry potter * books * were a cult hit . 
  a cult hit is not an underperfoming movie , game or book . 
  cult hit is something its fun base takes * above and beyond * the initial expectations . 
  now look at the number * you * posted me and tell me if it was expected a children 's book to hit those in 1998 . 
  minecraft is a cult hit because nobody expected a small java game made by one guy to make millions . 
  skyrim is not a cult hit on the other hand , because the company that made it is already established , the budget was humongous and the expectations were already high . 
  you do n't need to be a wizard to make something `` magical '' . 
  and a wizard can not understand every `` magic '' item because he does n't have the craft . 
  if you take a simple dwarf craftsman and somehow him create something extraordinary it will be a `` magical '' item . 
  it will be simply that good . 
  compare how gandalf opened the doors of moria . 
  he had to break the riddle like everyone else . 
  while if he was a dwarf with exceptional craftsmanship , he might understood how the doors worked and simply unhinged them . 
  i think it is both . 
  the keyhole * needs * the light of the moon to appear * and * it is positioned in such way to receive the rays only once per year . 
  emphasis on cult * hit * . 
  the cult/fan base following you describe creates a buzz so big it takes the product known to the mainstream followed by $ $ $ . 
  they are mainstream now , but they can still be considered cult hits . 
  a cult hit is its roots , its `` birth '' if you will . 
  it is already history so it cant be changed . 
  mainstream is a status . 
  something can leave the mainstream becoming obscure ( but still have a cult * following * ) , and get rediscovered later . 
  there are dozens of cases of media that where mainstream on their day , faded and reemerged later . 
  how you `` feel '' is completely different on how much alcohol you have in your blood and its effects on you . 
  8 hours are not enough for alcohol level to disappear . 
  even in your example about getting drunk the night before and get to work the next morning , you can still get a dui if your numbers are high . 
  i would like to point out that rocket holding that part while star-lord activated the infinity gem played a role why * only * that branch became a new groot and not everything else . 
  credit goes to tv tropes . 
  i think the movie ronan ca n't team up with guardians of the galaxy . 
  he is a genocidal zealot who wanted to wipe out a planet . 
  another fan theory that i like is that when that happened the guardians connected on a whole another level sharing their souls a bit . 
  hence the little groot having a blast with 80s music like star-lord had in the start . 
  so he essentially said `` there is no i in team '' . 
  i think it would detract the whole point of the movie . 
  the team forgot they prejudices , their egos and learned to work as a team to fight an evil overlord ... who is n't that evil ?!,
