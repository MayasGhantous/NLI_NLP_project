  ) . context makes or ruins sometimes.imagine if forest had his war shenanigans in baghdad and his girlfriend died from pig flu and you will understand what i mean . 
  if i may add captain america.it was suprisingly anti cringe considering the subject ( i am a european by the way ) and the hero pre transformation is a regular joe , considering the super scientists and bilionaires we are used to , making him more likable.finally ww2 works as a fresh backround and make all those huge explosions more plausible . 
  also he still wild ; y punches thor for shit and giggles in the final fight . 
  so with great power comes great responsibility?i wonder were i have heard that before . . 
  i really hope you did n't liked eragon.if you did , for your shake of your soul , dont watch it!or his dark materials !, 
  sadly 300 killed the gates of fire adaptation ... 
  how old are you?after the early 20 's you wont care what your parents think . 
  i have sent you a pm.waiting your response !, 
  because our body counteracts with other chemicals to provide an equilibrium ( evolution rocks ) . drugs are added in random and excessive doses . 
   we are now within two months of what may be ** humankind 's most dangerous moment since the cuban missile crisis ** . 
   ** there is no excuse for not acting . 
  all the resources our species can muster ** must be focussed on the fuel pool at fukushima unit 4 . 
   * fukushima 's owner , tokyo electric ( tepco ) , says that within as few as 60 days it may begin trying to remove more than 1300 spent fuel rods from a badly damaged pool perched 100 feet in the air . 
  the pool rests on a badly damaged building that is tilting , sinking and could easily come down in the next earthquake , if not on its own . 
   some 400 tons of fuel in that pool could spew out more than 15,000 times as much radiation as was released at ** hiroshima ** . 
   the one thing certain about this crisis is that tepco does not have the scientific , engineering or financial resources to handle it . 
  nor does the japanese government . 
  the situation demands a coordinated worldwide effort of the best scientists and engineers our species can muster . 
   why is this so serious ? 
   we already know that thousands of tons of heavily contaminated water are pouring through the fukushima site , carrying a ** devil 's ** brew of long-lived poisonous isotopes into the pacific . 
  tuna irradiated with fallout traceable to fukushima have already been caught off the coast of california . 
  ** we can expect far worse ** . 
   tepco continues to pour more water onto the proximate site of three melted reactor cores it must somehow keep cool.steam plumes indicate fission may still be going on somewhere underground . 
  but nobody knows exactly where those cores actually are . 
   much of that irradiated water now sits in roughly a thousand huge but fragile tanks that have been quickly assembled and strewn around the site . 
  many are already leaking . 
  all could shatter in the next earthquake , releasing thousands of tons of permanent ** poisons ** into the pacific . 
  i bolded the loaded words of the first paragraphs.hmmm , the cuban missile crisis , hiroshima , the devil ( !, 
  ) , poison and the promise of something even worse , while the part that explains what exactly is happening takes roughly 1/5th of the whole piece.i have a slight suspicion this is a propaganda piece . 
  dont tell me!i might have boned her ... 
  i loved them as a teenager.the movie?dead when saphira got from new born to adult in 10 seconds for no reason.its a coming of age story you idiots !, 
  i thought it was rubbish from the first two lines.the cuban missile crisis could have escalated to global thermonuclear war.i do n't think anything can be as bad as that for fuck shake ... 
  of course you should respect your parent 's , if they deserve it of course.but no one can tell you what to do with your love life , because in the end , its only you who will suffer the consequences of your choices , not your parents.of course all these change if the `` murder '' part was not a figure of speech . 
  from ~ ~ latin ~ ~ greek necro , `` dead '', 
  if it is medical , its greek.if it is about species , it is latin !, 
  one of the poles.the other is water, 
  what a bunch of bollocks . 
  for 2 years now i heard everywhere `` look the government dos nothing about golden dawn , they use them as private army and a scarecrow '' . 
  now they arrest every high member , something that has n't happened in europe for decades , and you say \u00cfts a trick , `` they used them and now they discard them '' . newsflash dude , more economic measures are on the way , and from the new year , things will be worse with the law protecting the houses from banks is ending.why?because we fucked up and we pay . 
  uhh the minister was right?and , no it wasnt a generalization ? 
  that we will find a way for faster than light travel , preferably instantaneous like stargates.because people , lets face it , if we do n't , our whole species will not matter , because we are stuck in our solar system.in all this big universe all our achievement 's would be unknown.forever . 
  i this happened in my game , i would mod those requirements out and activate the decision myself . 
  if that ai does n't deserve it , i do n't know who is ? 
  older brother posts search history of his younger brother for fun and nobody cares.nsa does the same and everyone goes ballistic.hypocrisy , meet your friend irony . 
  anyone else smells astroturf ? 
   that said ... you europeans have outrageous taxes . 
  i dont know how you live with it . 
  a wealth tax is great way of saying `` hey you worked hard ... fuck you '' . 
  hey you have cancer , here take some ** free ** health care.and on your way home have a nice stroll because you are not afraid of starving people out to get you , since they take welfare from your taxes.and be at peace that your child will get the highest education without huge loans to pay afterwards '', 
  so much unfair . . 
  maybe in some parts if africa and asia ... but i do n't think they are in reddit right now, 
  huh , 36 victims in the last 15 years.you have more chances getting killed by falling to the faucet on your eye socket . 
  edit : and 33 of them where from water in the wild . 
  only a month ago i finally finished a full game with the old gods.christians need some serious overhauling since by 1000 ad the only christian kingdoms left was germany ( me ) and italy.the umayyads had conquered the spanish kingdoms , half of francia and the norse had taken the rest . 
  after 100-200 years of painstakingly liberating and releasing france and spain , italy falls and the mongols arrive all the way to germany.then the muslims take back almost everything while i was fighting in the east . 
  yeah hands bitch!suck darwin 's cock !, 
  sure ... `` satan '', 
  and then you learn about all those diseases that have the exact same effects like the common cold and you understand this is the worst doctor ever.congrats doc . 
  now put them on [ game of life ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conway's_game_of_life ) . wait a couple of years.voila , you have created mechanical life . 
  so essentially keep tabs on every comment he posts and choose what is the best?nothing stalkish on this , sure, 
  so essentially the western civilization for the last 2000 years at least.duly noted , i am moving to the australian outback to escape ** the state ** . 
  stopping is quite different from what you proposed . 
  really?because that description fit exactly how the roman republic worked in 200 bc.and the athenian democracy.and i bet if you could research the babylonian empire we would find similarities ... 
  it would be microtransaction if one player put 1 $ and got regular game and the other put 3 $ and he had a screen clearing bomb that also added greatly to the score of the player , concerning the high scores table.so the first player has almost no chance of getting a high score , no matter how skilled he is , because even a first time player could get the top spot with enough quarters.lives are not the same , because a bad player wont get far compared a good one , and his score will mirror that . 
  i am not arguing the semantic of micro transactions . 
  i only discuss the modern , popular meaning which is `` paying for an advantage , often disproportional to the cost , which is unobtainable otherwise in games '' . 
  and , of course , that is the good side of mts . 
  are you sure it was n't a [ leopard seal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard_seal ) ? 
  nasty motherfuckers and quite dangerous too.quite different from the seal we know and love . 
  * if * there is a godlike entity , he is , by definition , unbound by the rules of the universe.we are intelligences that are perceiving the universe only through these rules , so * if * there is a god , he will be incoprehensible to us for all eternity , and the question if he exists or not is moot . 
   so you could never imagine a being that did n't have these rules ,, 
  exactly . 
  and almost all these claims are false . 
  yes . 
  male here.did you try switching sides during the act?it will help him see it as something that you both enjoy without hurt feelings.if you slap him first , he will the slap you without fear . 
  i am strictly pro gun control ( european here ) . these guys are idiots . 
  there is an even worse scenario.the registry goes so ridiculous everyone dismisses it.and then the real rapist uses the '' sex offender for having pictures of their high school girlfriend/boyfriend when they were the same age . '', 
  argument to cover himself . 
  a nice example would be starting a war with the ai.war goes well when a doomstack appears and wipes out your army.you then use two fleets with two armies on them disembarking the one , ai sends the doomstack against , you disembark the other far away and get the first back to the ships , causing the ai doomstack to switch targets and lose time/suffer attrition.keep doing it until doomstack is 100 desperate guys going back and forth and ready to get killed.while you did n't cheated per se , you used something that it is n't realistic.also called metagaming . 
  and going and going ... 
   the venetians , in turn , sought to blockade the ottoman-held dardanelles to prevent the resupply of the ottoman expeditionary force on crete, 
  so that was a feasible strategy in real life too ... 
  i just finished playing gta v.compare and marvel how far games have gone . 
  [ you answer is here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radhanite ), 
  [ jew traders . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radhanite ), 
  i think eu iv is seeping over to ck . 
  [ trade roads ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/radhanites2.png ) maybe ? 
  while i would love my first assumtion , i find it unlikely thu , since it would require a complete reworking of the base game code.my bet is a ` jew trade caravan has arrived ' event . 
  possibly because the de facto ( har har ! ), 
  mercantile focused game is eu , so they chose not to dwell to much on the trade aspect in ck2 . 
  similar comparison can be made with all the games . 
  vic2 is more politically and trade focused than hoi 3 for example , when some would argue that a very serious reason for ww2 was recourse acquisition . 
  '' many trade routes previously established under the roman empire continued to function during that period largely through their efforts . 
  their trade network covered much of europe , north africa , the middle east , central asia and parts of india and china . '', 
  i am 28 , thin and with a full set of hair.i really love to upset brats that know exactly what they want to buy , and try to dupe their uninformed parents.most of them have a '' shit i got caught '' face when their parents finally realize what game they almost bought . 
  gta iv and earlier games are way softer than v so i understand some kids that want it.however there some who know how fucked up this particular version is , and i love to bring them heat . 
  ' i will copy my response . 
  `` gta iv and earlier games are way softer than v so i understand some kids that want it.however there some who know how fucked up this particular version is , and i love to bring them heat . '', 
  exactly what i do.actually i have to persuade my * coworker * not to buy the ps4 immediately after release , every friggin week .
