  also he got a full infinity gem beam in the face . 
  hard to get back from that . 
  not a us resident so how should i know ? 
  what artist tries to do that in that weather ?!, 
  at least he wore a raincoat . 
  i feel like snopes is the true knight of the internet . 
  the numbers are according with the type of product they offer , their category . 
  one has a 4.7 / 7 compared to all the the other fast food joints , the other compared to high class restaurants . 
  apples and oranges . 
  oh man i am having terrifying flashbacks from the graphic card arms race of the 90 's . 
  you do n't have 3d acceleration on your 6 month old pc ? 
  too bad sonny , no quake for you , ** at all ** ... 
  . . here we go again . 
  about the sword one , would n't the pain of having 3 feet of cursed steel lodged between your pancreas and liver be agonizing ? 
  i mean even in real life people have got pieces of metal in them , and they got out pretty fine , but i doubt they could speak or walk during the ordeal , much less fight . 
  i am sold when i read about air support , limited as it is . 
  we have pulse rifles and ufo hybrid fighters , but we cant get a goddamn airstrike ? 
  people did that in 1914 with hand grenades for gods shake !, 
   well sure , but there are n't any rules for that . 
  by this `` logic '' you can break any tabletop . 
  oh hey i am not dead because my head is still attached with my body from a thread of skin . 
  i think common sense fills up the rules that are not there . 
  unless magic is used to fix the problem i.e. 
  a spell that eases the pain and bleeding ( all that blood ! ), 
  on top of the cursed sword . 
  plus combat penalties should apply for having a metal pole inside you . 
  behold , the heir of shitty watercolor , shitty one colour !, 
  i really love it . 
  spiders are cute . 
  how do you combine two different spells ? 
  also casting spells inside a bag of holding is bound to annihilate miles of the surrounding area on top of opening portals to random nasty places . 
  hmm , i would expect her name to have something to with crosses . . 
  as i said , limited . 
  at least it is there . 
  that 's the thing i hate for breaking immersion in tactical games like xcom or jagged alliance , they tend to forget 500 years of artillery and 100 years of aviation . 
  make it costly , make it dangerous , but goddammit just add a simple mortar !, 
   you put wands and enchanted items in them all the time, 
  permanent spells and charges are not the same as a sudden burst of magic . 
  also i would also like to point that abuse of magic at that kind of level will have other side effects , like getting your ass kicked by mystra for example . 
  remember , fluff is `` canon '' also other than the phb that everyone seems to selectively read . 
  i seriously not going to read that wall of text on how to break a game for no reason at all . 
  you must be fun at parties ( pun intended ) . 
  uhh zombies are the ** embodiment ** of `` we 're the real monsters '' trope , such as vampires are lust/sexuality/taboo . 
  you ca n't have one without the other . 
  does this pop up in non us residents also ? 
  you mean how europa universalis does it already ? 
  you can expel the jews , hung christians , castrate 16 year olds , abduct and `` rape '' women and declare jihads for bloody conquest and * that * is where you draw the line ? 
  well concubines . 
  it is rape but it is implied . 
  ohh yes modifiers would be horrible . 
  ironically , love in either romantic or family form plays a very extreme plot point in the strain . 
  and they use protrusions that have nasty bugs inside that invade your body to turn you weak , sick and in the end dead . 
  maybe not intentionally , rape + stds allusions come up because of the vampire = sex archetype is always there . 
  eating feces is very , very bad for your health . 
  for one example , [ ingesting feces from someone \\ ( even yours ! \\ ) that has tainiasis ( tape worms ) has a chance the worm larvae passing to your bloodstream ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cysticercosis/index.html ) and hatching to your skin , eyes or even inside your ( nsfl ! ), 
  [ brain ] ( http://img.medscape.com/pi/features/slideshow-slide/neurocysticercosis/fig1.jpg ) . 
  actually quite the opposite of what i thought . 
  a `` simple '' protein has enough complexity to `` walk '' . 
  is it * that * far fetched to think we came from this ? 
  is it * that * difficult to implement some type of triage ? 
  for example , to save the h-robot with the best chances of surviving ( less distance to the `` hole '' ) then if possible save the other ? 
  also why the hell did they mentioned robot cars ? 
  what that has to do with anything ? 
  because the situations that the decision would be narrowed between either a or b would be very few . 
  most of the time the car will be able to calculate outcomes that avert both a and b. 
  and most essential of all , it will do it faster than the human brain , and the best part ? 
  it will only get better with time , since we will be able to plug it in , gather any data , analyze where the ai has a shortcomings and fix them . 
  you ca n't do that in the human brain . 
  lets take those shitty `` ethical `` robots for example , and how they are not working properly because of * human * error . 
  a proper robot would have sensors and some kind of programming to asses the situation . 
  its not that difficult , lasers to measure speed and some boolean values can skyrocket the percentage of `` saved '' targets . 
  relative speed , weight of the targets and obstacles in the way are already analyzed by robots . 
  all these thousands times faster from a human brain . 
  and another advantage of a robot vs a human is that a robot will not fear for its life . 
  if you drop two persons , save one and the other is lost , the human will stop . 
  a robot will keep trying to the bitter end because it has no fear . 
  it is the ultimate life saver . 
  unless it is a shitty '' first semester in cs '' robot like those are . 
  you can still throw money to the problem with `` gifts '' for your accompl . . ehh . . 
  i mean friends . 
  i loved rome 1 ... but playing 2 after paradox titles is like meeting your first love after years ... they might be nice , but not as good as you remember :( . 
  this is the one and only meme i made in my life . 
  [ how i felt as a paradox vet after starting vicky ii . 
  it can been done . 
  3d battles can be available only for the army your active character is present . 
  obviously you will not be able to switch to other armies easily , and participating will have increased chances of getting killed . 
  modifiers could effect how your units react etc. 
  if you auto resolve , the usual battle resolution can be used . 
  and i do n't think paradox fans will have so much great expectations about 3d battles , because it is not the main selling point as it is for total war series . 
  i think an `` experimental '' expansion for ck2 at the end of its product cycle could be done , with the resulting experience be used to full integration for ckiii . 
  and yet you are complaining that you have bought a game called * crusader * kings , but you cant play a hindu . 
  i agree , discussion , research and rigorous testing should be the norm . 
  i actually prefer we go towards hybrid cars , instead of full auto immediately . 
  for example , auto driving can be implemented in a way to supplement the driver at first ( course correction , sleeping/drunk drivers stopping , brake assist ) and as a full on mode in well mapped highways , where there are usually no pedestrians/dogs and the speed changes are gradual . 
  that will help both ironing out issues without cars getting inside shops , and help the public trust it at a better pace . 
  however the guy that wrote the article , the `` scientists '' that did the experiment and the article commenters can all go fuck their ignorant asses . 
  you mean like how the whole game is already centered on the primary character ? 
  uhh yeah turning the discussion to the fluff side of the game is n't going to cut it . 
  gameplay and mechanic wise , were you complained , the game is centered into one character , your active one . 
  everything , from foreign diplomacy , vassal opinion , courtier control , even technology and speed of construction of a fucking church is based on your character his traits .
