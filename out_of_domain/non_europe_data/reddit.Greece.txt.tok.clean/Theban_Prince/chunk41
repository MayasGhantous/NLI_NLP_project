  so it will be normal to have the battles centered around that . 
  it will be even more realistic !, 
  no king was super overmind and controlled armies on the other side of europe . 
  and a lot of rl life kingdoms have fallen due to the king taking the largest army and marching far away while a neighbor invaded afterwards . 
  but yeah , that sounds boring and immersion breaking . 
  if anyone gets between my strawberry margarita and me during a super hot july i am going to fuck . 
  them . up . 
  am i manly enough ? 
  oh make that glass all dolled up please !, 
  god i hate when redditors wall text me just because . 
  i have return it tenfold ( i am a scorpio btw ), 
  let break you arguments one by one shall we ? 
   now imagine fighting a civil war with 3d combats . 
  imagine that after 8 hours of gameplay , you still would n't have advanced a month in the game !, 
  now imagine that you 'd still have 500 years of game time to go !, 
  this is utterly false , as i said , the focus will be in a single army , you character 's . 
  with making each individual battle give more war score in analogy with the armies present , and ** keeping the automatic system that exists now ** when vassal lead you armies/you are sure about the outcome , will not only give a realistic style , since most medieval campaigns were decided in a handful of battles , but also give a very nice tactical experience without forcing the player to auto resolve spam as the total war series do . 
  he might not even fight a single fight if he has an imbecile character !, 
   now imagine paradox having to hire an entire new staff just to code , balance battle a.i. 
  with all the problems that derive from it ( see rome 2 ) !, 
  now imagine the sheer flood of vitriol over lack of diversification of skins , lack of diversification of units , lack of visual quality for the battles , lack of a.i. 
  brilliance , battle units stats not corresponding to how players thought they should be , lack of proper battle cards for the units ( this one was hilarious for rome 2 , with plenty of people complaining about it ) , and a million other things players could and would complain about , deriving from a very specific part of the game , and how players could and would compare paradox games to ca on that part . 
  you are making two points here . 
  a ) is that paradox will have to expand drastically and b ) that there will be 0 players happy with it . 
  the core of these arguments is based around creative assembly example , and specifically the tw : rome 2 problems . 
  both points can be solved from a managerial point with the following solution that you forgot to mention : publish a 3d battle dlc during the end of the product cycle of ck2 , right before ck3 is in the planning stages . 
  dedicate a smallish team to create it , and keep it humble . 
  this will not only give experience to the coders/animators about the new style , you are experimenting on a product that is almost dead , so at worst nobody gives a fuck , at best you rejuvenate it for a few months more . 
  so any grumpy players will express their opinion were it does n't matter anymore . 
  ** sidenote : ** i am guessing you are of a young age , because you fail to remember than ca and the total war series where niche when they started ( a grand strategy about samurais ? 
  bahh gim me quake 3 frags man !, 
  ) , even worse than how paradox is now with reddit and / gsg / . 
  and yet , while they released a lot of glitchy games , they got a ** big ** fanbase eventually because people tend to expect * some * problems with really complex and / or massive games ( see skyrim ) . 
  the shitstorm started not because of the buggy 3d battles , but because the sloppiness spilled over to other parts of the game , namely performance , ui , compatibility signifying a shitty relation to customers . 
   the problem here is that you replied to a post about how the mechanics of such battles are utterly out of touch with the game in question , with a one-liner that in practice , does n't mean much of anything towards what i said , and you mentioned the whole game is geared towards your character , which i told you is wrong . 
  i am playing paradox games since the early 2000s , almost 14 years of playing , modding , tinkering etc. 
  i am hunting a place as we speak in the company itself . 
  so the `` out of touch '' is kinda overstated . 
  but let us see :, 
  i have the full list of comments . 
  unless you count my comment about `` you mean like how the whole game is already centered on the primary character ? '', 
  which was a legit question , i am over you in both words and sentences , and most importantly , i tried to describe how that would work . 
  instead you prefered to reply with sarcasm ( `` but i may be wrong and we 're playing different games . '' ) . 
   which i told you is wrong . 
  ** you ** saying something is wrong does n't make it so unless you prove your opinion . 
  something that you failed to do with zero examples , and simply dismissed with nonexistent counter-arguments . 
  watch how it is done :, 
   i already exemplified in various ways why it 's an horrible idea , and just narrowing such a gigantic system to just your ruler makes it even less relevant , given the time and effort needed to create such a system in a way that people have requested since time immemorial, 
  first of all , you did n't exemplified shit . 
  you gave an opinion on your first comment about those `` 8 hours stagnant '' , then compared paradox with ca , which * i * explained why ca has actually * escalating * issues of qa . 
  and now my favourites :, 
   ( basically wanting a game , within a game , that requires dozens/hundreds of thousands of hours of production time restricted to one character only ) ,, 
  you mean how trading families are with the trading post gimmick ? 
  or norsemen with their raiding gimmick , or the byzantines or the muslim , you catch my drift . 
  indeed my proposal is more universal than any expansion paradox ever released , since it will enhance every type off playing style , instead of those few who wanted to play with elephants in ganges . 
  also , you are repeating again and again about the `` one character only '' issue, 
  are you sure you understand that all the other characters are npcs , and exist only to give something for the player ( a single char everytime ) to interact with ? 
  that one and only one character matters the pc ? 
  npc are sock puppets , and pointegly their code is striiped entirly when they die because they have fulfilled their purpose and free memory for the new npcs . 
  check you save games with a text editor if you dont believe me . 
   it could not be used in multiplayer ( unless other players are willing to wait dozens of minutes on some sort of limbo ) while each player fights their own battles , and it turns the battle system , which is composed of combats lasting several days/weeks , allowing the player to clear to clear all enemies in a single day , or even worse , having to fight multiple long battles until he has completely cleared an enemy . 
  in multiplayer the game could restrict 3d battles to pc armies . 
  the game could be balanced so battles have a time limit , and then you have to disengage with a rebalanced war score to avert grinding . 
  since this is not a turn based system , the other , no participating players can continue to play as normal . 
  plus you dont to have the same time n the two modes , for example one `` day '' in 3d could take 1 motnh in 2d . 
  sligthly immersion breaking , but hey , you get to chop carolingian heads in beautiful 3d !, 
  afraid you are going to lose you country as you fight ? 
  well * hello there realism * , and most importantly the need to trust your allies to safeguard you . 
  ideally , the 3d battle option will add this dilemma :, 
  do i participate in battles and boost my army with my character and superior human reflexes/intellect , but risk getting conquered behind my back/getting my char killed , or stay behind , and leave all your armies to your vassals , and play the game as it is now , but with a chance a player that leads his own army steamrolls your ai armies . 
  choice choices ... 
   it is akin to :, 
  building a single church , as you called it , and then have the option of zooming in on a battle map and turn the game instead of a strategy game , into a medieval city builder game, 
  with an assassination attempt , it zooms in on the map and has you leading your conspirators , commando game-wise , avoiding guards until you get to your target and murder him suspiciously , and then having to extract without getting caught . 
  all of this ideas have no place in ck2 . 
  an assassin creed/commandos/stronghold / crusader kings/total war hybrid ??!!, 
  that would be the best game evah !, 
  on a more serious note , those are additions that no one asked about them * yet * , so while awesome , the money to be made would be few . 
  while what i am proposing is what ** you admitted ** a lot of people ( i.e. 
  customers ) are asking for a looong time . 
  so did i respond with something more than `` one liners '' now ? 
  i have to understand what type of gamer you are , the one that do n't like change period , a hipster if you will . 
  games evolve , like everything around us , and if they do n't they will wither and die . 
  if you had sway after devs , we will be stuck in crusader kings 1 for ever ( 3d maps !, 
  for a gsg game ? 
  preposterous !, 
  different cultures have different gameplay !, 
  what a disjointed way of expandg the game ! ) . 
  your nonexistent arguments ( you just said it will be bad , no why it is bad over and over , read your comments ) are straw for that reason only , paradox has gambled and changed their games significantly and it always payed off . 
  i wish you stay away from games entirely to be honest , i prefer gamers/consumers that want new stuff and pushing boundaries , instead of `` get off my lawn `` contrarians . 
  thank you . 
  what would you prefer to pay in real life ? 
  1200 $ now or 120 per month for 1 year?what will make you go bankrupt/disrupt your spending plan ? 
  or you know , a boy is * forced * to learn combat pragmatism at a very young age ( the teachers actually encouraged the bullying for that to happen ) and he has to deal with the consequences for the next 2 books suffering with ptsd . 
  the droids ( and lucke and co after they joined them ) were supposed to live to lead the empire to yavin . 
  that was the plan from scene one , `` the empty life pod '' . 
  hence the troopers did not `` shoot to kill '' . 
  now go re watch the whole movie !, 
  everyone can legitimize themselves in their minds . 
  it s still an asshole thing to do .
