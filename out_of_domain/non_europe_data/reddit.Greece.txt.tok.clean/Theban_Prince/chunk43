  the cargo vessel will cost a lot less , almost a box in space . 
  so you have the `` mule '' with high cost , but multiple uses , and the `` box '' with minimal cost but limited uses . 
  and what happens * if * in a year or two his new account gets moderately famous ? 
  can you imagine what would happen if someone figured out he was unidan under a different name ? 
  people will go berserk how he is `` cheating '' again since he will not come under the same scrutiny he has now . 
  also he had linked unidan with a lot of rl stuff like his research . 
  he was invited as a `` fuck you '' , he accepted . 
  while the whole story was kinda funny , that is an atrocious bug . 
  [ king richard the iii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princes_in_the_tower ) , [ octavian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caesarion ) and [ cassander ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_iv_of_macedon#death ) would like a word with you . 
  we wont have a cancer cure per se because `` cancer '' is a name really a wide range of different afflictions . 
  it is not glitched , you have to talk with a npc in the area where neko is . 
  i have dont the quest and his party is brutal by the way . 
  children killing has happened multiple times as i have shown . 
  the game stopping you for `` some reason '' is a fourth wall breaker . 
  i think it should be as easy as the others to do so , but if you get caught you get very bad consequences , even worse than usual . 
  [ obligatory .

  he was one of the reasons we had ussr and the cold war . 
  that 's why i would be dead 2 out of the 4 times i have been stopped by cops if i was in usa instead of europe . 
  the most ridiculous thing i have read here is that you are not supposed to move your hands from your wheel at all times . . 
  you should n't have chances to get shot when you are going to your job , period . 
  american police officers ( in some states ) are geared to war , plain and simple . 
  and another comment . 
  you find that normal . 
  i find that as crazy and scary as you would hear stories from a guy from n. korea . 
  can we call him to direct the ( spoilers ) scenes where the space elevator collapses and phobos is exploded ? 
  your 1 second late can get exponential if you count all the stops and all the cars . 
  i am not interacting with a caveman , i am interacting with a public worker that i paid him to get training to protect me and avoid killing innocents . 
   that 's not really that ridiculous . 
  `` empty hands '' is the sign of `` i mean no threat '' since like caveman days . 
  your post was 19 words . 
  the first 5 was stating your opinion . 
  what did i miss ? 
  i am not talking about a generic response we do to look less hostile as you say . 
  i am talking that if you do not do that response , you might get shot by people that are paid to know better . 
   and if cops do n't approach with caution , they might get shot . 
  if in an approach scenario someone has increased chances to get shot , i prefer that one to be the police officer . 
  i am sorry , that might sound horrible , but like a soldier it is part of the job . 
  i prefer an officer under than overreacting . 
   when you approach an unfamiliar dog , you do n't just fucking walk right up to it and stick your hand out . 
  but you might be more willing if he wags his tail and looks friendly . 
  again with the nonsense analogies . 
  we are not talking about dogs or cavemen , we are talking about people trained and payed to discern a dangerous situation faster than a civilian . 
  but to follow your failed analogy with the dog * i * a civilian would not get close to an unknown dog . 
  a * dog trainer * on the other half , you know , the guy that his job description is to work with dogs safely , would know how to approach a dog without danger for him or the animal . 
  and be able to understand if the animal is dangerous ** before shooting it four fucking times . 
   well i 'm sure he does n't prefer that . 
  he can go home anytime . 
   my failed analogy ? 
  the analogy you failed to even comprehend and need it explained to you like a child ? 
  ohh no no my friend . 
  i fully understood your analogy . 
  you seem cant grasp what exacly we are talking about . 
  let me explain to you with a few single words :, 
  you should not ** actively ** trying to look less threatening with any posture . 
  the officer must assume you are not a threat as a * default * * assumption * . 
   and then you 're never going to find anyone to do the job that just blindly walks into danger . 
  you are n't signing up to act like that are you ? 
  no one else will either , that 's just stupidity to not be cautious around danger . 
  you 're asking all police to disregard their own safety completely . 
  absurd request . 
  tell that to the majority of the officers in europe my friend . 
  just ask a european if what he does when he is stopped . 
  most of them will tell you they get out of their cars . 
   no , you fully did n't . 
  you demonstrated that definitely by responding `` i ai n't no caveman who you callin ' a caveman ? '', 
   you 're pretty stupid ,, 
  i am not . 
  but i am starting to fear you are , because that is n't what i said . 
  wait ... you * rent * modems ? 
  guns are legal in europe , just with stricter background checks ( and not conceal carry i think ) . 
  they are very common where it matters , in the bad guys hands . 
  europe is not heaven on earth . 
  and i did n't anything of what you are saying . 
  but we do have calmer police officers . 
  i am pointing out only as a doable situation for you also . 
   and lots less of them , with lots less guns . 
  nahh ak 47s are the staple in the criminal world . 
  you are confusing `` classic '' from a buyers perception , while we are talking about materials . 
  we can recreate mona lisa 100 % . 
  it will still be a painting of mona lisa 100 % . 
  its value will be different because the buyers perception . 
  because you have to deal with atmosphere and the sea . 
  the space elevator will have to deal with corrosion and winds at most for 25 km high . 
  the shortest part of the atlantic is 2,575 km . 
  2 and half thousand kilometers of storms , wind , salt and bad guys ( you do n't have terrorists/pirates in space , yet . 
  think of the maintenance costs . 
  that ` ss because we trust the law enforcement to do their jobs , so we turn back to my argument ? 
  you should check if the law is self fulfilling . 
  that is , since it exists , do we call godwin law more times , so we fulfill it ? 
  no i mean if no nazis has been referenced in a discussion , does just mentioning the law fulfills it ? 
  like the game ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ * that ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ lost . 
  but if we mention the law , wo n't the chances someone also talk about hitler rise , like you did ? 
  so it fulfills the law ? 
   yes , that 's why it 's self fulfilling . 
  thats what i said !, 
  or it might be in page number 1452 of the search results ? 
  you are not giving the proper search data ( name vs photo ) to compare . 
  as you said , black and white photos of a sailor with a beard must number in the hundred thousands .
