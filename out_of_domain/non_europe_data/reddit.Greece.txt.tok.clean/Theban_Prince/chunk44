  while i too find it the post fishy , that is not a good debunking . 
   horrible , immature idiot . 
  that he admitted he is . 
  not a rp zealot i think . 
  he is actually doing the opposite in his comments . 
  he says he is a `` bad guy '' that tried to take his life back the wrong way . 
  i think vote brigading him right now wont exactly help him out you know . 
  or any physical punishment . 
   downvotes and calling him an rp shitlord are only going to keep him from change , not ever help him get better . 
  i actually admire how he has responded to all of this negative attention , it gives me hope that he can change . 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  or the best solution , admit he has issues and ask for professional help , wich he claims he did . 
  and then the reddit mob sniffed him . . 
  sucker punch is a great movie if you understand that the title is meta . 
  cant the owner interfere at some point to help her out ? 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i think running gags play on the same mode , we have expectations , we know its coming , then its not , then it does !, 
  so you go from familiar thing -  unfamiliar ? 
  ( rustling in bushes ) -  oh no , familiar!everything is ok !, 
  the best running gags are not those that we know they are coming 100 % , they are the ones they cast doubt they may happen , and they they do . 
  well this subreddit is tv spoiler open , book spoiler closed ( i really need to add that to the sidebar one day . ) . 
  so new stuff are understandably slow . 
  however i am thinking of switching to some more generic , `` fun page '' stuff for the actor and his role until the new season starts . 
  feedback would be nice !, 
   thus tony has fully functional neural tissue literally everywhere in his body, 
  and this is why i do n't read comics . 
  because it has . 
  both the great elven kingdoms in the first age , and numeror in the second age reached at least late middle ages / early renainace level of technology ( ocean worthy ships is one indication ) . 
  however at the end of both ages extinction level events happened , the [ war of wrath ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_wrath ) at the end of the first age and [ numenor 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%bamenor ) destuction at the end of the second that plunged middle earth in a dark age twice . 
  there is a great indication at the end of the lord of the rings ( books ) that the third age was the last time `` magic '' had any hold , and the age of man is starting , along with `` mundane '' progress . 
  because nintendo does it with games that suit its console both in theme and software , and never has the attitude `` look what magnificent , epic , groundbreaking fps we unveil exclusively for our awesome console , and the rest of you can eat shit '' , and then release a shitty gta clone . 
  xbox and ps4 are also releasing exclusives that would do and suit much , much better for the pc market ( red dead anyone ? ), 
  while nintendo not so much . 
  nazi germany was dead the moment they crossed the soviet borders . 
  they just didnt know it yet . 
  i have never heard them say that mario 100000 will change the landscape of gaming , while call of duty does . 
  ehh they still could get a very good truce , keeping the vichy france and the rest of the puppets alive . 
  not that they thought of that of course . 
  you know whats funny ? 
  i heard rants like this about `` fleshing up '' the game before adding more features when they said docking is implemented . 
  funny how docking is now the good part of the game . 
  in the age of alpha games that do n't go over the second update before they fizzle out , squad is pumping up updates for years . 
  they are superior in their market . 
  the real pitfall of that movie was that it was took itself too serious to be considered scifi , and too ridiculous to be scientific . 
  so i did n't enjoy it as an awesome space adventure , neither as a hard science adventure . 
  plus i was stuck with sandra bullock for 3 hours . 
  brokeback mountain . 
  take a cliched love story , mix the most controversial stuff you can think ( cowboys + gays ? 
  and you are done . 
  same with the warmest colour is blue . 
  can we see a gay love story where the story is fresh and not revolving around gays gays come and see the gays !, 
  please ? 
  and the doctor says that he `` picked one '' . 
  you are not a fun of british comedies , are you ? 
  they only thing i got is `` fock '' , `` fhootbol '' and `` fockers '', 
  i have a bsc from a british uni ... 
  or you know . . shock . 
  ... nope its just chuck testa !, 
  `` acute stress disorder ( abbreviated asd ) is the result of a traumatic event in which the person experiences or witnesses an event that ** causes the victim/witness to experience extreme , disturbing or unexpected fear , stress or pain , and that involves or threatens serious injury , ** perceived serious injury or death to themselves or someone else . '', 
  `` common symptoms that sufferers of acute stress disorder experience are : ** numbing ** ; ** detachment ** ; muteness ; ** derealization ** ; depersonalization or dissociative amnesia ; continued re-experiencing of the event by such ways as thoughts , dreams , and flashbacks ; and avoidance of any stimulation that reminds them of the event '', 
  `` onset is usually within a few minutes '', 
  ( serious ) what exactly are you posting about ? 
  i am giving you science , you are giving me anecdotes . 
  sort of . 
  man you are fast . 
  someone put that flag up in a greek city , and there is an uproar since far right claims it is a jihad flag . 
  anyone has any info ? 
  it is pretty close with that flag , but why triangular and why the old flag ? 
  the `` connected to jihad '' claims come from far right nuts to stir some shit , that why i am looking it up . 
  and i guess still without the screams of the dying men and horses . 
  there have been armed attacks on clinics with ebola patients where they took the patients and released them to the general public to save them from the doctors that `` made them sick '' . 
  hardly irrelevant . 
  that is a re post of the original news article from where i got it too . 
  i am greek and i understand what they say , but they are far right neonazis . 
  for them , `` crescent = jihad '', 
  thank you !, 
  that blog that reposted is called `` criminal immigrant newscast '' . 
  its description reads :, 
  `` the things that murderous immigrants do and kept under rugs by the media shills . 
  murders , rapes , assaults , drugs , prostitution , guns , black market , ghetoing ( sic ) from illegal immigrants . 
  all the truth and reality in a blog . '', 
  the original post was by local small tv station hence the dumbed down text , but the guy speaking into it ( and making the jihad claims ) is a known far right sympathizer . 
  hmmm ... there is supposed to be next a power substation . 
  there are a lot of illegal immigrants that are using the backroads/field to go around noticed . 
  maybe that 's a warning flag ? 
  it seems a bit far fetched . 
  i am sorry , the `` original post '' apparently is the video made from a semi professional local station . 
  hmm so bombing abortion clinics is the same with raiding ebola clinics and endangering whole countries and maybe the world ... how ? 
  no i am giving you scientific proof that you `` composure '' is the instinctive detachment that happens when under serious injury . 
  shock , in this case , is not running around like a little girl screaming , but looking at your chopped off leg and muttering `` well shit '' . 
  both reactions are not entirely voluntary . 
  thats why we drill soldiers to follow orders/training under extreme situations . 
   they have high amounts of government distrust , education and dissemination information is n't done on nearly the same level as the us . 
  on one hand you claim this , that agrees with what i said , yet ... 
   these comments are nothing short of bigotry and ignorance . 
  what . 
  you do realize the main issue with overpopulation come from third world countries that have difficulties implementing such a law ? 
  western societies have issues with efficiency , not overpopulation . 
  [ when you spent 660 gallons of wate ] ( http://wateratworkministry.org/2014/02/what-is-the-water-footprint-of-your-next-cheeseburger/ ) r for 1 cheeseburger you know you are in trouble . 
   we should try to minimize it .
