  and that 's the issue we are stuck in this rock . 
  you have to accept the fact that people will die , possibly horribly . 
  they might get sick , suicidal , or get stuck into space until they either off themselves or die from lack of recourses . 
  people will not be happy , or even content . 
  it going to be a shitty situation all in all . 
  however , some people are willing to go through this , just to explore new frontiers . 
  as you say , some prefer to die young in a blaze of glory . 
  the first of that breed of reckless awesome humans are the present day astronauts , that know full well what it can go wrong . 
  however , when an accident in space happens. , everyone freaks out . 
  all the people that wish to stay safe at their home , are the ones that talk about the dangers of space , and how we should do something about it , when we do n't ask the people that want to take the risks , the astronauts/colonists themselves . 
  i bet if you asked today an astronaut if he wanted to be the first human on mars , but die in 10 years , he would sign in a heartbeat . 
  but we are `` scared ' for their well being chopping up their dreams . 
  how selfish of us . 
  we should ask them first . 
  if i want to go somewhere dangerous without putting others at risk , it is my choice . 
  and believe me , there would be hundreds of people that would sign up with even less we have now . 
  i know i would . 
  i am going to die someday no matter what . 
  why not try accomplish something that will echo for hundreds of years ? 
   western societies are the ones that can `` afford '' more children and have them because , `` cute '' . 
  way to make a straw argument . 
  because you just explained the motives of 1 bil people as shallow . 
  but the numbers tell the truth . 
  [ population growth in the west is close or even zero . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate ) . 
  on the other hand , third world counties are booming . 
   yes , i do believe anyone that has the motive to have children is shallow . 
  ehh we can go for hours why this is not the case for some , and not for others . 
  listening to music can be shallow , going to theater can be shallow how raising a kid can be always shallow i do n't understand . 
  i would like to hear your thoughts . 
  however regarding the original comment , the `` 1 kid per couple '' law as i said is unnecessary in the western world since it is already in effect . 
  the problem in the long term is , again as i said , efficiency . 
  if it is not pass to feet , then what it is ? 
  a pass to the head ? 
  torso ? 
  according to your logic going to theater has great consequences . 
  you are consuming food , electricity , paper , gas etc , while you are wasting time without actually producing something . 
  for all the hours , adding up to days and weeks per year you have spent reading books , watching tv or be in reddit you are a dead weight for society and the planet . 
  have you stopped doing that ? 
  having a child is not an inherently bad decision . 
  what you do with him and its upbringing is what judges your decision . 
  also people do n't hurt the planet . 
  the `` planet '' does n't give a flying fuck about us or the animals because it does n't exist . 
  its a human moral construct . 
  even if we firebombed the entire planet we would n't be `` bad '' , just dead . 
  and that why we must be care full about our environment , for us , not for the `` planet '' . 
  the movie `` contagion '' is an eye opener . 
  rotate your view and try to put the original on the other side . 
  you can have an aura speaking pc you know ... just change your windows sounds with her ( the . wav files are out there ) . 
  i currently have [ hal ] ( http://stevepell.ca/assets/hal-9000-1920x1200.jpg ) tell me `` i cant do that dave '' on error . 
  if the robot apocalypse starts , i will be the perpetrator . 
  dont you have 24 hours until you join a new corp anyways ? 
  read the goddamn dev blog . 
  they are nerfing * medical * clone jumping , not clone jumping, 
  there are a lot of small alliances and only one cfc . 
  do the math . 
  '' hey guys alliance a and alliance b is pilling up on cfc !, 
  lets grab what we can . '', 
  hardly a coalition . 
  actually monarch points work like this, 
  - old scientist : so sire , we take these metal tubes , and we put enough explosives in one end while . . 
  - general : sire !, 
  the peasants have hanged the tax collectors in kent !, 
  - king : gather up the nobles from where they are !, 
  we either find a solution or we have a rebellion in our hands !, 
  - old scientist : but sire , the new ideas i was just talking about would be useful for ... 
  - king : oh screw you and your iron tubes . 
  i have more pressing matters at hand !, 
  one of my favourites . 
  ` merica, 
  you know , for all those superheroes using force fields , the flash would be the most scientifically plausible case . 
  he could use force fields around his body to warp space around himself so he does n't actually travel faster , he actually has a shorter distance to run . 
  so no inertia problems or issues with his body functions . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  do n't worry , she already has the collector 's edition . 
  i did not give it as a cannon explanation . 
  it was an origin theory that makes more sense for flash than any force field using superhuman , yet its not used . 
  re-read my comment . 
  * cough * ^ ^ it ^ ^ is ^ ^ ridiculously ^ ^ cheap ^ ^ anyways . 
  its actually [ arcanepunk . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arcanepunk ), 
  dishonored has heavy elements of steampunk with arcanepunk mixed in . . 
  well that turned great for them !, 
  i be they will have some openings pretty soon . . 
   there 's not going to be an ebola outbreak in the u.s. 
  what worries me is that one guy got to the us . 
  what happens if he went to other countries with worse health organizations ? 
  what if they are already there ? 
   everything will be fine , healthcare systems in the ** usa ** are more than capable of dealing with ebola , there is no threat to the public . 
  the us is not the world . 
  what happens if the virus spreads in other countries with worse border control , medical facilities etc etc ? 
  that is not an answer . 
  if india or china ( or possibly both ) becomes an ebola hotbed , * what * stops it from becoming `` an unmanageable global issue . 
  man you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about . 
  you are trying to tell me that sealing the borders for what ? 
  25 % of the population is feasible ? 
  one case went under the radar with 7000 sick , imagine if we are talking about millions . 
  and what about europe ? 
  more info please ? 
  does it crash on loading?any error message ?
