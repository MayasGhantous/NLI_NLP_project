  as a smoker , i never understood that shit . 
  in my business everyone could take 10 ' and that 's normal . 
  we need some minutes to compose ourselves smoking or not . 
  is that so difficult ? 
  umm . . why not simply leave messages on most major landmarks ? 
  leave big messages in major landmarks . 
   ( and eventual east v west , whenever it comes a thing ), 
  umm . . shall i tell him ? 
  nothing of what you said contradicts his theory :, 
  `` this is the universe , here take it and do ** whatever ** you want '' . 
  being a master of something does n't mean you are good for the job . 
   free will is n't a theological argument , it 's a pathological and a neurological argument . 
  it was a theological/philosophical discussion . 
  i do not understand what you want to say here . 
  / r/glitch _ in_the_matrix, 
  you missed the whole point of the thread did you ? 
  in the exclusively hypothetical theological/philosophical question `` if we accept that an omniscient god does indeed exist , how can humans have free will '' he answered pretty good i think . 
  ** he did n't try to explain free will itself . 
  stalingrad was the decisive battle of ww2 someone could say . 
  but without the delay of the germans by the greeks it could go quite differently . 
  we have the tomb since the 70s and we where quite certain it was phillip 's one . 
  this is just an outstanding confirmation . 
  pretty much . 
  check the battle of crete !, 
  pol pot . 
  you got two names wrong son . 
  so wait , i should play my life as a football manager game ? 
  thats the good part of eve . 
  the bad part of eve is the mandantory requirment to join a corp and experience 70 % of the `` content '' . 
  those are products that are consciously consumed that will kill you * if * you overdo it . 
  one is a pathogen that kills from childern to adults indiscriminately . 
  excellent and no way `` hipster and contrarian '' comparison . 
  like comparing guns with cars . 
   unless your heading to africa . 
  or everyone do n't gives a shit about africa because us of a is awesome and embola spreads to asia . 
  i mean the western world surelly can carry on and protect itself from millions of infected . 
  please vote pretending you did not know the consequences afterwards , * in character * . 
  well try to get to the shoes of a citizen at that earth . 
  10 years of mega floods , economic disruption , seasons getting haywire etc etc. 
  then a lady appears in the tv saying you ca n't bomb the moon and fix all that because it is an unspecified life form . 
  hmm weird because i did . 
  i do n't think you had the perfect playthrough . 
  the nukes would not even scratch the moon , it would simply kill the creature and the moon would stay there . . 
  if that was not the case then the dillema would not be there anyways, 
  there was no extended cut when i played because i had to replay the last battle to see it . 
  however i had the me2 dlcs so that might have to do something with it . 
  i would press that button so hard !, 
  well presumably the whole point of sending them there was to somehow fix the problem without making the situation worse ( and blowing up the moon is way worse than super tides . ), 
  of course that exposes the massive plot hole of how they thought they will fix the moon with nukes before they learned there was a beast there . 
  there are a lot of people that make that in a week . 
  yea because a dormant jaeger is exactly that same like a frenzied kaiju spiting acid . 
  seriously , that 's the most logical answer here . 
  everyone else is going with as much explosive force possible , when you can simply poison/suffocate it with minimal damage . 
  you are not with the doctor , you are in earth , an ordinary man . 
  do you turn your lights off ? 
  poison will start leaking only after decomposition , which it takes time . 
  the area can get cleaned easily ( essentially chop up the beast with decontamination crews , it happens in huge volumes with oil/chemical spillages in rl ) especially if the surrounding miles are not scorched rumble by bombs . 
  and biological weapons can very very easily made to effect a specific type of animal . 
  plus you can always simply suffocate/deprive it from where it takes its energy . 
  the area effected will be miniscule compared with bombarding , which might even not finish the job and just make it angrier . 
   what does that even mean ? 
  it means that somehow it will need to get / metabolise energy to move those tones . 
  however there are ways of doing that without eating/breathing , for example byphotosynthesis , that should be taken in account . 
  also we have chemicals that can wipe out cockroahes by the hundrends per day without killing people ot pets . 
  we cant completely destroy them because the hide in tiny places very well , so most of the time you dont know they are there at all . 
  a kaiju will not have that problem . 
  as for poison volume , you dont need to fill the thing !, 
  there are traces of poison that can kill a man , ( go on and lick some arsenic or rat poison i am sure you will be fine ! ), 
  so i dont see whats would be the problem . 
  for biological weapons even easier !, 
  alao about delivery , you can spay it or so to not disk contamination you can shoot it with penetrive bombs without the exploaives . 
  dangerous chemicals get through armored skin and eyes better than a bomb.as for effectivwness , well you start with the broadest effective and narrow it down . 
   was n't the point of internal poison delivery to mitigate contamination ? 
  now you want to spray this toxic shit everywhere ? 
   first of all , toxic to creature a is not toxic to creature b. 
  and i do n't say spray with a plane from 50000 feet , but overhead with a helicopter just out of reach would be perfect . 
  unless there is a direct contact with running water , it is easy to clean up . 
  [ compared with a 1000lb bomb ] ( http://youtu.be/ilo2wxk_kma?t=1m11s ) , that may or may not finish the creature the side effects will be minimal . 
   i do n't think those exist . 
  the warhead part is where your patronizing anwer applies . 
  bunker busters are '' . . intended to smash through concrete shelters and other hardened structures * before * exploding . '', 
  you simply change the explosive payload with a way to release chemical/biological agents ( we have already the technoilogy for [ chemical bombardment by artilery since wwi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_weapons_in_world_war_i ) and you have your 7m accuracy kaiju injection . 
   is n't that a contradiction ? 
  first you tell me you 're going to create specialized poisons to combat this monster now you 're telling me we can use anything ? 
  i said the broadest * effective * considering the kaiju . 
  because if you have a monster roaming around ny , time is of an essence , you have to try the most obvious solutions and work from there . 
  if your monster looks like a huge serpent , you first will use agents that are effective against serpents in general , and work to more specifics from there . 
  remember , kaijus are not `` magical '' , they have biological processes . 
  after at worst a couple of tries you have a dead kaiju with a slightly ( maybe ) contaminated road that you can clean in a week instead of a bombed out manhattan that would make 9/11 look like 4th of july . 
  because killing the monster in 10m minutes with minimum casualties is not great for a blockbuster movie . 
  it is like the zombie apocalypse movies , zombies would not stand a chance against the modern military of netherlands , much less against the us or russia . 
   how does taking into account photosynthesis help us kill the monster ? 
  we have to take into account that the monster may acquire energy other than edible food . 
  what if its skin is like a giant solar collector and covering the sun will make it weak . 
  i wrote that as an extreme example , and yet again solvable . 
   cockroaches are one of the most resilient creatures on earth and have learned to adapt to poisons and have insane survivability . 
  here 's an article .
