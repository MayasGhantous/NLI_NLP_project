  where do you live ? 
  in asia the cockroach problem is very real . 
  cockroaches survive and adapt because they are many and reproduce all the time . 
  its the cockroaches * progeny * that adapt through the generations ( basic natural selection ) and evolution . 
  a kaiju is one , and it willl be either be vulnerable or not . 
  you can not adapt to something after you have been born . 
   how can you be so sure that this monster has the same physiology and physiological flaws as a human ? 
  there 's only a small chance of identifying a poison suited for the monster the first time and an even smaller chance of delivering it . 
  for this reread my last answer : you apply logic according to your observations . 
  if the kaiju looks like a giant mammal , you try using stuff that would hurt mammals . 
  if it looks like a serpents , use those that hurt serpents . 
  acids are pretty much killers against anything , and neutralized easily . 
   i know you only need a small bit of it , but when you scale it up to a monster weighing 100,000 tonnes you have to scale up the poison as well . 
  i hope you understand that . 
  while surely it will need more than a spoon , its about [ potency ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potency_\\ ( pharmacology \\ ) ) , not size . 
   my point is that if poison would have worked in those specific incidents they would have tried it , however for those specific monsters they decided that explosive warheads would have been the best way to go . 
  those are not documentaries . 
  we are talking so long i forgot which subreddit started it all . 
  it actually indicates that sometime in the past [ he was arrested for piracy and branded as ** p ** irate with a hot iron , probably by the english . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badge_of_shame#skin ), 
  he was so good at heart that when he saw the final humiliating and taunting rejection and destruction of his gifts , right in his front yard he went melancholic and imploded . 
  like an emo kid screaming `` nobody understands me ! '', 
  and banging the door of his room . 
  precisely !, 
  quick contact that russian guy to write a sequel to grinch as he did with lotr !, 
  i was playing as frisia once . 
  i wanted to create the base for a strong yet realistic holland in eu4 so i stayed put for most of the game . 
  then one day i noticed aquitaine was green and praying to allah like op 's . 
  oh well france will kick them out . 
  france goes on civil war shenanigans and gets slowly eaten up . 
  getting the cup de crace ( see what i did there ? ), 
  by a jihad ... 
  by the time the green horde was gulping lorraine and italy , i had finished `` uniting '' the german dutchies into a german kingdom , and proceeded to kick the mohammedans arse back to the other side of the gibraltar strait . 
  best ck games since 2006 .

  more personal info upon request by pm !, 
  hey , truth be told , any game set during jesus or buddhas lifetime ( where you can interact with them of course . ), 
  is going to take humongous flak . 
  it is simply not worth it . 
  thank you for your reply !, 
  i am aware how tight is the budget , and we will probably rise it a bit . 
  the main issue we have with sharing is the dreaded `` no couples allowed '' . 
  understandable , but kinda heart breaking also . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  [ you are hilariously correct ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pylon ) ( well except the pythagoras part . ), 
  `` origin of pylon, 
  greek pyl\u014dn , from pyl\u0113 gate, 
  first known use : 1817 '', 
  i just read a comment like that , [ however he was actually right ] ( http://en.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/comments/2jb099/installing_a_power_line_tower/cla3aun ) !, 
  hey son i have an idea about [ your career . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jobs/ ), 
  i hope all those libertarians you have there have fun with this . 
  i am sure it is because the state interfered with the `` free market '', 
  man if gmos and vaccines stop the infection ... it would be hilarious with conspiracy theorists ... 
  . . well until someone proposes that was the plan all along , ebola was a ruse to get us to trust gmos and vaccines . 
  i know there is no hope . 
  hey my dog does and has no ebola !, 
  proof that big pharma is spreading ebola so we can use tobacco to get cured but in reality we will get cancer so they can make money out of treatments !, 
  if you are actually asking for the somewhat more historical mod , that is part of hip , i read in the forum that it might never get updated about the earlier starting date , but i guess they will keep the 876 with cm mechanics . 
  almost all the rest of the mods are ready since day 1 . 
  it is actually a surprisingly excellent way to represent hordes . 
  you gather thousands of warriors to fight with you due to the prestige of your name , but if you lose the army or war ( sign of weakness so low prestige ) your underlings will fuck you up ... 
  time for a warhammer ork waaaggg mod !, 
  if a character has no more lines than `` hello '' and `` my name is . . '' you are supposed to play him as yourself ( role playing ) . 
  if he has lines and expanded back story , he is like a protagonist in a movie . 
  you get to see and feel what he does , but from a distance . 
  jason was an arrogant , spoiled jock who found himself in a tropical island with free drugs , guns and a licence to kill whatever he want . 
  and he goes berserk like it is `` lord of the flies '' meets a jugallo gathering . 
  go replay it and head to the cave your friends are . 
  the are ( more ) pills there that after a main mission will give flashbacks that obviously show what douche bags jason and his friends were . 
   unity looks closer to that ,, 
  this isubisoft we are talking here . 
  wait after release to judge . 
  remember the ** next!gen!open!world !, 
  sci !, 
  thriller !, 
  ** that actually was gta iv with hax0r minigames ? 
  i made a 21 martial character for first playghthrough . 
  when you start winning wars and prestige starts snowballing you feel like goddamn ghengis khan . 
  they really nailed that one . 
  set about a dozen asteroids to coalition trajectory with earth all the way from the asteroid belt . 
  keep doing it until one lands . 
  voila , you won . 
  edit : seriously that 's it . 
  unless we have active war assets designed specifically for space ( and that assumes an active colonization/exploitation of the solar system ) we are done as would be a jungle tribe against a carrier group . 
  no plagues , no suits , just shoot space pebbles until we croak . 
  buying shots , being loud , drunk , high , idiots who started measuring dicks in a bangkok club and went to an island in the middle of the pacific because some cool guy they just met told them so . 
  but how efficiently can you do a mass shooting with a home made gun ? 
  its the same argument with `` knives are also lethal weapons '', 
  and stricter gun controls apply to ammo . 
  a blot would be better ... 
  that 's the easy part . 
  because they did n't earn it all by themselves , they used public infrastructure ( ports , trains , roads , ) and public services ( police for domestic and army for national security , schools to create an educated and specialized workforce , government to organize everything ) etc. 
  taxes are the costs for these . 
  unless someone goes and recreates civilization from the ground up somewhere , they earned nothing `` alone '' . 
  `` the germans are mass extreminating people '', 
  `` oh you silly , i call occam 's razor .
