  what is simpler , that the germans have simply concentration camps for pows , or that they created a complex system of railways , informants , secret police , ghettos , mass propaganda and industrial level camps for exterminating people based only on their religion or race '', 
  my god win 's law fucks their occam razor anytime . 
  thats fucking brilliant . 
   `` where is everybody ? '', 
  `` there are not in out neighborhood , * yet * '', 
  the fermi paradox is a pile of horseshit . 
  unless we explore the majority of galaxies and the planets out there and have a significant data to extrapolate the entire situation of the universe , we ca n't say we are alone . 
  its like a guy from a remote island in the pacific saying `` where is everybody just becasue he never saw new york . 
  i believe the state should allow two consenting adults to have the same legal rights and obligations regardless of gender . 
  i believe the state should not interfere with religions or their practices since they are not obligatory . 
  morality is a human construct and malleable , not a quantifiable state we can use to compare things . 
  ~ ~ guns ~ ~ the french gave us our freedom from british rule . 
  i have a better example that morality is :, 
  `` should an adult have sexual intercourse with children ? '', 
  5th century bc : ** yes **, 
  final point : there are cultures that butcher , skin and eat dogs . 
  they think nothing of it afterwards . 
  about the story missions , they where rather bland . 
  they had absolutely no interaction with the `` next century interconnected society '' part . 
  its about someone trying to save their loved ones from the bad guys and technology is incidental . 
  it has more plot similarities with die hard 1 than 1984 . 
  while not bad it is huge disappointment because well , generic , hence the marketing !, 
  speak !, 
  that i have to endure for months as an employee in a gaming store . 
  i feel no shame . 
  and a lot of people use it in the real world for holocaust denial . 
  there is no question because there is n't a correct answer . 
  what does it make us feel better as a collective ?? 
  that 's your answer . 
   consider a hypothetical scenario where animal torture makes us feel great as a collective , and ask yourself whether it 's morally right for people in that scenario to torture animals . 
  umm , it was actually morally right for thousands of years and it still is in some places . 
  heck some slave holding societies thought it was morally ok to mutilate and torture humans and animals e.g. 
  it was the fricking past time for the society in the roman empire . 
  if you ask specifically about * western morals 2014 and onwards * the collective decides . 
  the point is there is no * right * nor * wrong * answer . 
   semi auto toddler, 
  i forfeit my case . 
  i ca n't continue after this . 
  would the revolution be successful if no third power have intervened ? 
  i do n't think monk was portrayed simply as `` quirky '' or `` eccentric '' . but it did perpetrate the whole `` special '' people have superpowers thing . 
  even if that was the case ( that i highly doubt an everyday man can make an automatic shotgun that reliably kills the targets instead of him and the necessary ammo for sustained fire ) that , docent actually works fro pro-guns . 
  buying a legal gun is still way easier than building one . 
  guns and cannons used by an army , not a citizens `` lets protest '' militia . 
  then you would not have problem to take the `` official '' guns of the market since you can create one so much easier , cheaper and faster in your garage , right ? 
  comparing the american revolution with vietnam is only making my argument stronger . 
  the n. vietnamese did not stand a chance if not of the support of foreign powers , namely the chinese and soviets . 
  the first three where dealing with the occult . 
  the fourth one was about the 50 's science !, 
  i know what they where trying to do , but they didnt do it right . 
  plus shia le buff as indys son ( and succesor ? 
  check his whole body for swelling . 
  be ready to get him to hospital if it does . 
  it should be nothing serious for an adult ( usually ) but children are a dangerous category . 
  they can get from very small holes into your house so check any window/door for cracks and seal them, 
  oh it is pain full ,, 
  source : my father got bit inside his mouth . 
   that is unless tim get 's in our way . 
   killed in ** a ** timly mannor, 
  do n't worry , apparently there are other timly mannors . 
  maybe it is the secret society name for fema camps ? 
  mate he is the mod . 
  um i am somewhat not inclined to say it in this thread so nsfl , but it is the reason that the only bug i fear are centipedes . 
  apparently they actively try to find and hide in your bed sheets , in contrast to other bugs that are simply there by chance ( spiders , scorpions ), 
  so i guess the one that bit my father crawled on the pillow that night to find shelter and warmth . 
  my father tends to sleep with an open mouth and well . . 4 am visit to a hospital . 
  joke aside , would n't that growth inhibit his speed and vision ? 
  precisely . 
  having absolutely no knowledge about the series background makes it so much better since you can experience the episode through the protagonists , everyday people that get glazed by the doctor and the horrors around him . 
  oh and also it was on the first floor . 
  wtf ... i was about to click death note in netflix after thinking about it for 2 hours ... 
  can someone call the matrix it please ? 
  is n't that the guy that takes a ton of old movies from a genre , puts them in a blender and makes a '' new '' movie ? 
  you have to get back to marketing and customer satisfaction . 
  it is 101 that personal satisfaction is ingrained into most people . 
  it is is n't a matter of tangible gain , it simply an aspect of personal fulfillment . 
  it not only about rings , but the majority of products and services hinge on that . 
  also one of the reasons communism fell ( you cant get personal fulfillment and status when everyone has the same things . 
  that breeds corruption ) . 
  so you can debate if it is a net gain or loss , but the thing is that if diamonds lose their `` fake '' value something else with get overpriced to replace that . 
  god forbid , it might be houses again . 
  [ he wants to see your honor !!!,

  facebook as a social media utility not as a company . 
  for comparison , dos fell out of favor for windows , but both were made by microsoft . 
  edit : can someone point the difference on the two companies please ? 
  you provided the answer yourself . 
  its not about the numbers , it is about activity . 
  not only for ad revenue but also for positive feedback . 
  when a lot of people actively use an app , then even more will use it . 
  if that number slows down , and gets under a threshold , the app is dead even if it has 6 bill accounts because the effect snowballs . 
  of course , the number of the users effect how fast it will happen , but it is inevitable after a certain point . 
  for my opinion , facebook should start renewing their layout periodically again . 
  while a lot of people whined , they actually felt they where `` hip '' and `` witnessing '' a new age in technology ( which was bollocks but whatever ) . 
  is it that difficult to implement that rule only in extraordinary measures ? 
  `` i want to climb that chandelier , swing it and jump past that chasm to hell '', 
  rolls 1, 
  `` you slip , roll for fumble '', 
  rolls another 1, 
  `` you fingers fail to grasp as you start falling towards the hellmouth . 
  congratulations , you are now asmodeus bitch '',
