  hmmm i have a good degree , i have worked in some of the best companies in my country , and i am very happy with my job.and exactly now i am about to have awesome love with my girl.so sincerely , cry in your pillow.xoxo , theban prince . 
  i will never understand why they use months after the first year .18 months is 1.5 year !, 
  dude seriously , do n't do that.me and my girl were searching for job for 1.5 years.we finally found two , low paying - low grade type of jobs and after just 2 months we are getting to be some of the best employees ( according our supervisors ) . i have also sent a family member into a job that ditched 1 week later because it `` oppressed her sensibilities '' . when later i wanted to sent another more deserving girls , my credibility was ruined and i didnt even try.so at least give jobs to guys that deserve them . 
  choosing and properly placing the chairs and table where prime minister of greece [ kostas karamanlis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kostas_karamanlis ) and russian president vladimir putin met and agreed about the [ burgas -- alexandroupoli pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgas%e2%80%93alexandroupoli_pipeline ) . 
  also helping the then future prime minister of greece georgios papandreou with directions about how to go to the wc . 
  it does n't sound like the one song.it is that one song with different lyrics !!, 
  ! damn !, 
  to me you are one of the greatest people who walked this earth , because you took a deteriorating empire and turned it around.but i am worried about this so called crusades and their future implications.those western barbarians look less as soldiers of christ and more like thugs more interested in pillaging any target of opportunity.your rules about their proper conduct are great , and i dread the thought if a lesser man was in your position . 
  other primates use have sex for pleasure and sex tools for those `` lonely ' [ nights in the jungle ] ( http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/23/20718.aspx?page=2 ), 
  `` manufacture '' has a broad term in this case since they use tool specifically for a reason ( and not in a random way ) . simple and yes , not `` manufactured '' in a factory obviously , but the intentional purpose is the same.they know [ why they chose those specific rocks and branches ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causal_reasoning_\\ ( psychology \\ ) ) . 
  the glurge is just too * fucking much * ... 
  we do n't have a universal time all over the world by far . 
  different calendars are used around the world.according the official calendar of iran and iraq , the [ solar hijri calendar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_hijri_calendar ) , today is 9 of aban ,, 
  1392 . according to the [ indian national calendar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_national_calendar ) , today is 11 of kartika , 1932 . 
  and there other examples . 
  why most people in the world know about the gregorian calendar , and probably keep track of it along with their own?because the domination of the western civilization in the planet for centuries ( yay colonialism ! ), 
  so for economical and diplomatic reasons mostly . 
  about the proliferation of dividing the year in 12 months , 30 days , 24 hours . 
  60 minutes etc etc , well most calendars are based either in the [ lunar cycle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunar_calendar ) or the [ solar cycle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_calendar ) . because the movements of the moon , sun and earth are repeating themselves periodically , almost everyone in the world can use it to track time , so most civilizations independently used the same.for an easy explanation , `` see you in two days '' means `` see you after earth has revolved around herself two times '' . anyone can track those two revolutions without a clock or calendar on him.and even then those divisions are arbitrary , because in reality earth takes 365 . 
  *** 25 *** days to complete a year.what happens in the 0.25 of a day?after 4 years we add a single day ( because 4 years x0 .25 days = 1 days lost ) on february to compensate for the loss , hence [ leap years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leap_year ) . 
  same applies with the 24 hour format.earth revolves the same all over the world , and it can be used easily by everyone . 
  * even then * for a a lot of people the day starts at dawn or dusk , and not at 00.00 in the night . 
  tl ; dr : we do n't have a universal constant of time , the divisions of time are mostly arbitrary human decitions, 
  the overmind . 
  checkmate . 
  you saw all the clips in 5 mins.the movie took months to get filmed . 
  the greek prime minister said `` fuck my head . . asshole '' followed by facepalm . 
  [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtxsqr2lzoc ) with no subtitles, 
  he could actually change shapes . 
  and he was not just a wolf , but a wolf beast.think the hulk of the wolves, 
  i will always know every week 's winning numbers in the national lottery before the draw . 
  a tornado just 50 m from where i stood.in greece during the summer.i got actually ridiculed in a class when i said that ( i have thankfully my family 's testimony about this ), 
  because they are harmless . 
  i can do that :p, 
  they eat mostly small fish.while they are n't aggressive , you have to be careful next to a beast of several tons , because if it hits you either accidentally or because you annoyed it , then you go < < splat   . i vaguely remember a diver got killed because kept harassing one , like grabbing his fins.idiot . 
  . . and once again the left will rise ,, 
  to add to that , it is speculated that the 9 barrels of alcohol had a leak , causing highly flammable alcohol vapors to fill the hold.when the hold predictably exploded ( opening all the hatch doors in a huge fireball ) , the crew panicked and got in the boat trailing the ship , the rope snapped and they where lost in the sea , possibly because of rough weather.the kicker?the alcohol explosion was not dangerous and left no marks to the ship . 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/inthenews/itn060522 ), 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/inthenews/itn060522 ), 
  i had a stapler in my hand and playing with it while working/and or speaking on the phone.i stapled some papers i had laying around.then while i was speaking to a coworker , i absentmindedly had the idea how great would be to staple my finger . 
  soooo what is the counter proposal ? 
  but he probably made at least 3 times as much ( investments , income , etc ) just sitting there . 
  man you had an awful dm ... 
  maybe make ` fuck this ' show up just few frames later . . 
  perfect !, 
  having the ability to fly at low levels is either a bad dm or a very , very high magic world , meaning the tarrasque has no reason to appear at all . 
  and a good dm like a good screenwriter would use the monster in circumstances where it would be a memorable encounter even if undepowered . 
  for the top of my head , the party meets the tarrasque at the process of annihilating a heavy populated city.first of all , you can make the monster seem dangerous by describing it dealing great damage to buildings and civilians even if the pcs can kill it relativetely easily , create urgency because they have to kill it fast and the moral dilemma of using high powered spells with the danger of civilian casualties along any possible spell backfiring by neighboring magical enchantments ( the city 's school of magic for example ) . no dm ass pulls , no stat changes , just good all story telling . 
  uhhh they have genetic parents . . the one would be his original genetic donor , and the other would be the one that gestated him.unless we somehow found a way to create dna from scratch and gestate the embryos outside a living being , they will have parents . 
  how fast we can colonize other planets.no seriously . 
  nowadays , if a spacecraft with 5 ( ! ), 
  people explodes , we mourn for days.however , like the colonization of the americas , which was lethal for thousands of men , women and children , we would be extra fast on doing this if we could do it without regard for safety or convenience of the colonists . 
  and i just realized that oppressive regimes with space programs might have an advantage on the long run . 
  test post.please ignore, 
  you are using book rules to counter my argument.you are telling me that because the mechanics of the game allow something then they must be the rule in every campaign world ever . 
  no , the dm decides what goes and what not , regardless of what it is typed in the book . 
  overland flight not only breaks tarrasque , but half the mm at least . 
  that is why a dm should refrain from allowing it for * narrative purposes * . 
  stat blocks are there for storytelling convenience , not the holy bible of how to play the game.you can use anything from the books to break any challenge and any campaign.remember [ pun pun ] ( http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/pun-pun_\\ ( 3.5 e_optimized_character_build \\ ) ) ? 
  so stop being a fucking munchkin . 
  i think greece could become the new eastern challenge . 
   casting a level 3 spell in the player 's handbook = punpun, 
  what i am saying is that just following the rules can break any monster , challenge and puzzle . 
  pun pun is simply the extreme example that breaks the whole mechanics system itself.it is not the way to play this game . 
  * every * monster works due to dm fiat.they are simply different puppets.you have to use them on the proper setting for full effect.the lore of the tarrasque is specifically left vague so you can fill in the blanks and finally , you have to remember it was introduced in frigging [ 1983 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarrasque_\\ ( dungeons _ & _ dragons \\ ) ) . he was pretty brutal back then and for several other versions from what i can understand.they still keep it for the same reasons the game is called `` dungeons and dragons '' when you can play in settings with neither dungeons nor dragons . 
   there is also the fact that space ships are way more expensive than ships ,, 
  again , i think a substantial cost is for safety reasons.if you did n't care for gravity health problems and solar radiation destroying your colonists life , i think spaceships would be cheaper . 
  you actually say the same thing that i said . 
  do n't use the rules when they take out the fun.in this discussion , a monster can be killed very easily by the dm not restricting the power of the players ( even if they deserve it ) for narrative purposes . 
  if by mother you only take account the genetic relation then yes.however our society ( and laws ) does not take in account only this . 
  i am talking about mass producing bare bones missiles and throwing them to mars as fast and as many as possible.some would survive eventually . 
  so we disagree in the finer details.either they smelled the leak or saw the ( explosion of ) leak.either way mary celeste is not a mystery any more . 
  that you can get titles by inviting claimants , landing them and then pressing their claim.i had to read it somewhere to realize that option . 
  either this or all the courtiers.i hope its the courtiers , because i wont be able to fix the save games . 
   realistically your best bet would be a better computer ... 
  meh , that 's the most common answer i get when something comes up with paradox games.guys , the games are not the best optimized products out there you know.its not only the machine . 
  thanks for the code thu ! . 
  i fucking hate hate hate false dilemma.its the easiest to go ass pull.from drunks to prime ministers . 
  can i be your friend?without a 75 $ ticket , dont worry . 
  when i have a blob appearing on my doorstep , if i ca n't win them then i go with the old saying `` keep them closer '' . so i swear fealty , survive , nibble lands from other neighbors and traitorous vassals , and wait for the proper time to gain back my independence and back stab them to oblivion ( sometimes literally ), 
  dependent on your position , you might have ample targets of opportunity ( the mediterranean is excellent because so many religious enemies all around ) or none ( smack middle of catholic europe for example ) and stuck looking the map and waiting for revolutions that hopefully you have claims for .

  [ these are ] ( http://www.kidspast.com/images/medieval-peasants.jpg ) european medieval clothes . 
  [ and these ] ( http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/1x8608424/conchero_aztec_dancer_ciudad_de_m%c3%a9xico_k89-829901.jpg ) are aztec clothes.notice some differences ? 
  precisely what i tried to fix.i lowered that limit from 30 to 15 . no dice yet.i think the problem it is the bloated 866 save game . 
  for non greek speakers , the name of the wife is literally `` virgin erotic '' . 
  no , [ really ] ( http://translate.google.com/#auto/en/%ce%a0%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%b8%ce%b5%ce%bd%ce%b1%20%2c%ce%b5%cf%81%cf%89%cf%84%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%82 ) !, 
   what kind of shitty history is this ? 
  goodammit . 
  i will have to get back in the 19th century and inform the french , the americans and [ all the other revolutionaries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v3j31gv.jpg ) that they fucked up . 
  last time i checked , the [ ancien r\u00e9gime ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancien_r%c3%a9gime#downfall ) was alive and kicking all the way to 1789 , and it was the first to fall . 
  i t was the evolution of traditional medieval feudalism , and it all sterted just as the 19th century was dawning.last time i checked , napoleon died in 1821 , the year the [ greek independence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence ) war started , a revolution based on the french rev. 
  principles ( even it took some time . ), 
  . hell even [ contempory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_old_regime_and_the_revolution ) people agree to that . 
  comparing biological evolution with political evolution its no the same . 
  and as i have provided , a historian 60 years later called it feudal . 
  goddamn my peripheral vision . 
  she was a clever child . 
  and you derail the discussion more and more and more , fighting me in semantic meanings.i think i can call qed and go along my merry ride . 
  ta ta !,
