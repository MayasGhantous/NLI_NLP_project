  wait like , `` you critically failed you profession ( pottery ) roll , a piece of vase stabs you in the eye ??! '', 
  sanity ( san ) * is * an official measurable stat for lovecraftian games . 
  so not a homebrew . 
  there are rules about how much san you must subtract from a char depending on the `` monster '' or `` scary situation '' but with freedom for the dm to decide , so he could be a strict one . 
  and in lovecraft , even * learning * the name of a monster can make you mad , so that `` arbitrary '' part , might actually be official game rules . 
  i stated these to point the most essential part . 
  in lovecraft you are * supposed to end up mad or dead by the end * . 
  the question is if you stop the end of the world before that happens . 
  so that dm simply chose a very bad campaign to run when you are supposed to maim/kill/sacrifice to the elder gods/possess the pcs by the end . 
  unless they are old man henderson . 
  there is a d20 version of call of cthulu with 20 sanity ( you roll twice to lose ) . 
  but i could be wrong , i have n't read it that recently . 
  if you ignore their body language , the two blonde ladies on the left of the photo look like they are grinning . 
  and the guy with the tie in the front looks like he is taking a stroll on a nice afternoon , not running . 
  unless every single bystander in dallas was in the plan , it is simply confirmation bias . 
   even the janitorial staff need to have an infection control certificate . 
  in his day you could walk in off the street and get a job as a ward assistant just by being polite . 
  to be honest , that is a part i am great full for changing , especially for a * janitor * in hospitals . 
  when i dm , in usual battle double 1s means that either you lose your remaining actions regaining your composure or the enemy gets an attack of opportunity . 
  makes more sense that in the heat of battle you might make slight mistakes that the enemy may or may not take advantage off properly , instead of `` you chop off your own hand accidently '' shit . 
  and i am inclined to say that he is full of it . 
  your description is exactly how the official system works , and he uses the * exact same terms * . 
  so while i can believe someone inventing a somewhat similar stat ( indeed i almost created one myself before finding the san for my horror campaign and there are books with other similar stats ) i ca n't believe someone reinventing 100 % the exact same system that the * default * one . 
  no no . 
  we will be * insane * by december if we get hyping now .

  he has the same issue with me . 
  both me and my fiance are arriving in 17th on november with decent experience in hospitality but we are looking elsewhere because i bet i cant work in a reception without knowing the local languages . 
  english , you were supposed to be the lingua franca dammit !, 
  ohh we have a racist here !, 
  its a nationality so i might be wrong . 
  how is it called when you are lumping a whole lot of people under a single assumption and making hurtful jokes about it based on their ethnicity alone ? 
  is that different than anti antisemitism for example ? 
  he specifically said `` a greek merchant '' aka a merchant whose ethnicity is greek . 
  lets try this with another example `` he was a jew merchant '' . 
  does it sound that he is referring israel as a country ? 
  so do we agree we made a joke about ethnicity ? 
  just be advised your joke can hurt real life people that are living very bad situations and have done nothing wrong . 
  there where numerous monarchs at that time frame that either broke or fixed their country from the ground up . everytime i read the `` hur dur my monarch has nothing to do with building a ship '' i remember peter the great personally participating in building and designing russia 's first great ships and st. petersburg was his pet project . 
  absolute monarchy mates , everything * is * tied to one person . 
  so make the nations more generic ? 
  eu4 is a historical game , and nation ideas represent the nation 's background before the game 's start . 
  declares jihad . 
  greek is an ethnicity and specific group of people . 
  greek as a word was there before the nation of greece for centuries . `, 
  so it is ok to lumb all persons from greece in a joke ? 
  are we discussing semantics here or that he is calling a group of people names ? 
  all germans are nazis is ok then ? 
  all jews are thieves ? 
  swedish are drunkards ? 
  americans are fat hillbillies ? 
  what is acceptable or not ? 
  germans are nazis ! all jews are thieves !, 
  swedish are drunkards!americans are fat hillbillies !, 
  am i doing this correct guys?are we laughing ? 
  you just described what the greek prime minister did in 2010 ... 
  however they have a lot of commons that their market share to overlap . 
  and that is what is asked here . 
   tell that to iraq or palestine or sarajevo . 
  that is an exact example of what i am saying . 
  a `` civil war '' with genocide , massive property damage and a long stalemate due to all combatants had a lot less air support ( if any ) . 
  [ when the nato airstrikes begun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_deliberate_force ) , air superiority was the king . 
  with only 60 dead from over 20 days of bombing !, 
  you are grossly underestimating the damage a nuclear weapon can do . 
  for comparison , [ one of the biggest conventional bombs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gbu-43/b_massive_ordnance_air_blast ) has a yield of 11 tons . 
  [ the obsolete w84 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w84 ) had 200 tons at its lowest possible yield ! . 
  and that is if we take out the radioactivity that will make whole cities dangerous for decades or possible climate change . 
   you honestly think that a single conventional ww3 would be less destructive ? 
  less destructive than a global nuclear war ? 
  yes . 
   conventional ww3 is going to be ww2 on steroids . 
  you 'll get mass drafts , carpet bombing , aoe warfare , etc but with better and more destructive weapons . 
  sure the accuracy might be a little better , but you 're going to have the same results in the end . 
  mass drafts and carpet bombing are a thing of the past . 
  draftees are useless against professional soldiers and carpet bombing has been replaced by precision strikes . 
  when was the last time a new strategic bomber was built in the last 20 years ? 
   this has been the strategy since the turn of the century . 
  concentrated strike , disable enemy 's infrastructure , then command and control . 
  it still results in widespread destruction . 
  it just is n't a matter of blowing up a single room of a single building then rushing in commandos and that being the end of it . 
  you 're going to have multiple advanced and hardened military installations and highly trained forces on both sides . 
  there is no clear strike and control victory possibility . 
  i vastly prefer this if the alternative is a nuclear war . 
   nope . 
  there is just no reason to believe that they 'd get separated out . 
  and depending on who you 're fighting there is a distinct possibility of militants just ingraining themselves into the civilian population . 
  see the recent israel conflict . 
  as others , you are giving me examples that are actually again what you are saying . 
  if there was not a `` nuclear balance '' either the us would had helped by full force or russia ( or other powers ) would have intervened and end the whole thing permantely . 
  but it keeps going and going for generations because nobody can do something decisive one way or another . 
   problem is that you ca n't . 
  they exist . 
  next time a large scale war between two nuclear nations happens you can probably bet that a nuke will be used . 
  and here you actually agree with me . 
  no , i do n't expect that nuclear weapons are going to get dismantled . 
  but i think that the so vaunted `` nuclear peace '' is actually a slow road to ultimate destruction , and i would prefer a conventional ww3 over that .
