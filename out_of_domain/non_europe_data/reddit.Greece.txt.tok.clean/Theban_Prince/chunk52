  for example bow wow had a greater age difference with you in the past , but at some point the human consciousness somehow shifted that bow wow is older , and reality changed with it . 
  however , since humanity is the one that changes reality subconsciously , we do n't notice , unless someone points out the issue * like we did in this discussion . 
  another `` example '' of pan-human consciousnesses , the '' [ go to parking -  take mone ] ( http://monopoly.wikia.com/wiki/free_parking ) y '' rule in monopoly . 
  there are millions of people that do that , when there was ** never ** in the rules accompanying the game . 
  it has been reported years before the internet , and in many places around the globe . 
  the origin of the rule is unknown . 
  ** edit ** : i found out it is called `` the mandela effect '' by some people . 
  [ read some more in this blog ] ( http://mandelaeffect.com/ ) . 
  as / u/d _ a_n_i_e_l pointed out below , the berenstein bears name can be another example . 
  disclaimer : i do n't think it is a true theory , but i find it fascinating to think about it . 
  ** yes !, 
  ** the bears have been mentioned in the article i read about that theory . 
  thank you for reminding me this , i have found more about it . 
   especially free parking and not auctioning off unsold properties , because they make the game more random & therefore easier for children to play . 
  actually the free parking rule is breaking the game and make it take way longer to end than designed . 
  in monopoly , the last player with money wins . 
  with the free parking rule , the money that players loose stay in circulation instead of going into the bank so it takes longer for everyone to get bankrupt . 
  also it makes the game more oriented around luck than planned , with players that played badly coming back from the brink due to a single lucky roll . 
  to be honest , i do n't think its that , neither alternate timelines . 
  i simply think that because the general structure of the human brain is the same to everyone , common `` mistakes '' of our senses and memories can happen to multiple people . 
  for example this [ optical illusion ] ( http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/mot-feetlin/index.html ) works for almost everyone , because the part of the brain that handles sight is similar . 
  maybe there are some particular bits of information that can cause `` memory illusions '' , mishandling of memory storage , the same way to different people . 
  of course , i am very far from an expert , but that is my rational hypothesis . 
  do n't give a single penny yet . 
  i was n't one of their manic detractors , but the situation looks very , very murky right now . 
  because like wasteland , they want customers to know that the money they give for early access/alpha/beta state games are actually more akin to money funding for completing an unfinished game ( akin to using kickstarter ) than buying a complete product , so they have less 5-15 $ customers that cry `` this game is unfinished/buggy sux '' everywhere . 
  higher entry prices weeds out the random buyer and allows seriously dedicated fans to experience the game before release . 
  plus all dlcs , without fucking bioware points . . gnnhh . . 
  yea because a species without surpluses can survive a disastrous natural event so much better . . 
  i guess all the western nations should pull out of west africa right now and send the all wise inuit to heal them . 
  are modern hospital , heating , disaster relief services and international humanitarian programs just sign of a decadent , surplus based lifestyle ? 
  what fairyland do you live in where the only cruel and unforgiving thing in this planet is humans ? 
  sounds pretty much the same as the concept of [ eromenos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pederasty_in_ancient_greece ) in ancient greek cities . 
  take a young boy and teach him life from war to love . 
  also `` pederasty '' was a norm for a lot of ancient cultures because children where not considered a `` complete '' human being but something malleable that can only become a proper person only under the tutelage of an experienced adult man ( and not be those feeble minded females ) . 
  that 's why man to boy was okay , `` he is teaching him love '' while adult man to man was viewed as something even more abhorrent than now ( you are getting fucked like a young boy ? ) . 
  people need to understand that only with the advent of modern science and psychology/psychiatry we fully understood that children can experience full emotions and something can damage their mental health permanently . . 
  hence age of consent is not a `` cultural construct '' as much as the end of slavery is one . 
  what happens if someone from those health care workers * does * get infected , presents symptoms after he is back and he decides not to get himself to a clinic , but go on the run ? 
  you re saying this while the anti vaccination movement , homeopathy , and `` health supplements '' are a multi-million industry ? 
  or what happens if a health worker wants to save his family and friends from public shame and believes he can isolate himself properly ? 
  do we allow the safety of the public to be decided on a case by case base . 
  finally i think not having the publics support is detrimental to the overall effort . 
  and that support will come after there is some ease of fears . 
  you may say it is cruel or unfair , and it might is , but having the public against never helped on the long run . 
   today, 
  just 100 years ago children were allowed to work on mines and soldiers suffering from ptsd were shot for cowardice . 
  homosexuality is still illegal in many places , and it was heavily frowned upon in the western world until 30 years ago . 
  as they say , hindsight is 20/20 . 
  the thing is , morality is not universal law but a human construct , thus a thing that evolves and changes along with human knowledge . 
  the ancients did not have the necessary science to understand the growth of human brain and how early traumas can effect your entire life . 
  they did what they thought was best for their children with the limited experience they had . 
  i think it is ubiquitous in cultures where war was a frequent occurrence such as the japanese clan era and the city states of greece . 
  war as was fought then was based on men ( since raw muscle power played a great role in battle ) . 
  of course , that gave a lot of power to males and masculinity became something to be praised , when feminine weakness was something frowned . 
  ultimately , having any contact with women ( weak and dumb creature we need to protect ) meant you were not a proper man . 
  it is unfortunate , but women 's rights became a reality only after we had the necessary technological progress for them to replace men on `` vital '' jobs ( physical labor , war ) in the 20th century . 
  implying that there are n't any people that believe you can cure your dying loved ones using prayer in the us . 
  deported ? 
  i thought we were discussing mandatory quarantine in hospitals and readily available proper medical care not concentration camps . 
  you are twisting my comment and appeal to hyperbole to prove your point . 
  there are uneducated people aplenty everywhere and usually they are not alone . 
  there are * already * deaths due to anti vaccination or religious reasons . 
  that is why we had so much spread so far in africa after all . 
  just because a safety measure maybe become ineffective in case of escalation , that does n't mean its ineffective at all . 
  we still have fire extinguishers in nuclear plants . 
  plus we are talking about people that that can be traced anyway , like legal travelers or health workers . 
  illegal immigration should be considered , and yes i am against deportation just because of ebola fear . 
  but as i said , here we are talking about quarantine . 
  doctors not \\ soldiers . 
  and the disease should be fought in the hotzones of africa post haste , but it is not mutually exclusive with safety in your country . 
  historical excuse ? 
  can you elaborate please ? 
  or do you truly think what is considered morally right know is absolute in past and future ? 
  pirate captain npc : `` prepare to be cardboarded ! '', 
  i believe in you op . 
  i would give a couple of episodes worth of the doctor traveling with the master and slowly reverting to time lord victorious.think a doctor who/punisher character . until a mere mortal gets him back to track and we have a new companion . 
  what forest episode ? 
  both danny and the brigadier had contact with the doctor , so they have the mental capacity to understand what is going on . 
  imagine the 18th century dead waking up inside a metal exoskeleton 300 years in the future . 
  their surprise factor will make them easy targets for the cybermen programming to enslave . 
  maybe that 's why they were all stabling around for some time after waking up . 
  my big question :, 
  how does unit exist and knows so much of the doctor when he deleted himself from all records ? 
  i recall even the dalek 's did not recognize him ? 
  also i have n't seen the older series , but i thought the picture of the brigadier in the airplane to be out of taste for the late actor . 
  why i am getting downvoted ? 
  the question is legit , not criticism for gods shake !, 
  i think the monsters of the week are latching on peoples heads . 
  i am calling it :, 
  they can make people 's dreams/thoughts come to life a la crichton 's ` the sphere '' . 
  deadly creatures born from the protagonists fear and mistrust ( insert puny human comment by the doctor ) hunt people until the doctor realizes that and tells everyone to get positive thoughts so they create `` good '' dream creatures . 
  but they are lost in the bleak darkness of the arctics , cold and scared . 
  they ca n't have happy thoughts , so the doctor helps them :, 
  * - it 's christmas in the north pole , who you gon na call ? 
  que santa claus-dream creature comes to life and rescues everybody . 
  * * that phrase is a shoutout to ghostsbusters of course , and specifically ghostbusters 2 where the main plot point is a paranormal ooze , created by a ghost , absorbs new york 's bad emotions to create horrific creatures . 
  it is beaten by the heroes spreading happy thoughts [ and a `` good '' santa . . eh . . 
  statue of liberty comes to life and rescues everybody .
