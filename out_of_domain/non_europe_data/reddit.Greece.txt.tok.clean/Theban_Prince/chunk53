  bonus edit : obvious homage to aliens + the thing is obvious . 
  we are going for an 80 's extravaganza here people !, 
  wining edit : do i win karma or something ? 
  in doctor who ? 
  preposterous !, 
  next thing you tell me there is an episode full of atrocious child actors where the doctor is guest starring in his own series . 
  with magic trees !, 
  [ there are no such episodes and never will be . 
  ] ( http://38.media.tumblr.com/ac0219734cfc2fd5ea87b4a76dee3be1/tumblr_mlex8hkqsm1qa1gn7o1_400.gif ), 
   today it 's just miley cyrus on a thursday . 
  actually its the exact same publicity stunts cyrus , lady gaga , minaj ( and before them madonna ) pull off and 60 years later we * still * fall for it . 
  `` oh god have you seen x starlet she went full whore ! '' . 
  people need to understand these people are playing a role 24/7 . 
  [ its even worse ... ] ( http://oglaf.com/kingshaped/ ), 
   well the doctor ca n't erase unit from earth and he ca n't go through every member of unit he 's helped . 
  all he can really do is limit his exposure on a universal level . 
  then again it 's possible that it was 11 who was getting all the attention . 
  one thing 12 has been doing is not calling himself the doctor too often . 
  the girl was wearing the bow tie of 11 . 
  see even told his catchphrase . 
  i do n't think it was a bad taste for his character but for his actor . 
  it looked cheesy . 
  there are not exactly conversion mods but there are high res texture mods and enbs ( shaders and effects ) that greatly enhance the game.for new vegas , my favorite , go [ here ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/ ? ), 
  and you can find a lot to improve the game from unofficial patches to village building mods . 
  i personally suggest as must have project nevada + nmcs texture pack + any weather mod . 
  there is also a page for fallout 3 in that site . 
  ** killing ** of human beings was perfectly fine as long as they were slaves . 
  ** stealing ** was encouraged in spartan youth to develop cunning . 
  if they got caught they where punished because they failed to get away with it , not for the act of stealing itself . 
  you are still projecting 21th century western morals in a completely different time and place . 
  they did not chose this because they did n't even knew they had a choice . 
   i 'm just saying sex with children is n't good . 
  on what facts do you base that opinion ? 
  where that facts readily available in 500bc ? 
  there were n't having sex with a child ( actually a pre-adolescent but semantics ) simply for pleasure , it was n't necessarily the physical attraction a pedophile feels , but actually providing hands-on sex ed . 
  it was considered morally good for them . 
  imagine your surprise if you learned that in 1000 years you could get locked up if you stroked your child in the cheek . 
  that is how they would feel now . 
  and tell me how that mysterious group you claim magically convinced [ the chinese , japanese , greek , russians and even the fucking mayans to do that . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pederasty#post-classical_and_modern_forms ), 
  deal with it , pederasty was perfectly fine and even encouraged almost worldwide . 
  and it would still be if we have n't discovered the * devastating consequences * , but you need psychology for that , and until the 20th century we did not have it . 
  you cant blame oblivious culture for that . 
  ehh mate , i do n't want to kill your buzz but i think you are heading for a disaster . 
  i think you should talk to an expert . 
  [  in the trailer , clara is n't anywhere to be seen . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wasvcqsnrue&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  oh the trip will be a `` success '' . 
  i fear the disaster will be with your feelings . 
   i meant those nefarious members of society , whichever society it may be . 
  are you nefarious if you hug a child ? 
  i really hope she goes . 
  they already hinted that twice this season , get on with it already . 
  december 25th , 2014, 
  the return of the jedi ( plural ) . 
  the return of the jedi order if you prefer . 
   most of these dui checkpoints do n't get anyone for being drunk but they do issue citations for people who do n't have seatbelts on or have an expired insurance card and do n't realize it or left their house without their driver 's license , etc. 
  so pretty much still illegal stuff ? 
  you are merging two different issues to prove your point :, 
   trying to find shit to fine them for to make money . 
  that 's not a roadblock discussion , that 's a general police force discussion . 
  are the shit they find indeed illegal ? 
  because if they do , that 's perfectly in their job description . 
  a police officer is not a judge to decide on the spot if one law should be implemented or not , he must uphold any law . 
  but if they are * changing * facts to sentence people is wrong ofcourse . 
  if.if you are indeed ware of this you must report the officers, 
   over without probable cause, 
  your `` probable cause '' is that you are driving a 2 ton mass of steel and electronics . 
  even slight impairment of your control can cause multiple injuries , death and property destruction . 
  the consequences of a driver killing someone being drunk ( something far to common ) heavily outweighs your lost 20 minutes . 
  operating a vehicle is a clear and present danger . 
  research has proved that when drunk you can be a killing machine . 
  additionally you think driving is your * right * when it is a * privilege * , hence driving exams and licences . 
  your counter example is wrong because ** yes ** , if the size of your house effected the chances of an illegal activity they would indeed check up on you without a warrant . 
  this is * exactly * how the law works . 
  '' * the supreme court defines probable cause as where the facts and circumstances within the officers ' knowledge , and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information , are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed . 
  * '' [ \\ [ 3 \\ ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brinegar_v._united_states ) '', 
   owning a house is not probable cause of a crime . 
  and that is why they indeed need a warrant . 
  if it was they would n't need one . 
  my point . 
   i think you are a bit confused here . 
  by your definition of how the law works a police officer can just pull over anybody at any time for anything simply because they are driving . 
  that is illegal . 
  i do n't know where you think you live , but police officers have every right to check up on you without a warrant when in a public space even if you are walking ( presentation of id/immigration papers ) . 
  they need a warrant to search and detain you . 
  quite different . 
  `` jedi '' is used both in plural and singular . 
  `` the jedi constructed ** their ** lightsabers '', 
  `` the jedi constructed ** his ** lightsaber '', 
  further proof is the title of the second movie , `` revenge of the sith '' . 
  both titles refer to two almost extinct orders that make a comeback . 
  how would you feel if you learn that in 100 years psychologists will uncover data that it damages the child feeling in an irreparable way ? 
  did some nefarious people convinced you ? 
  this is an example on what something is considered vile now it was pretty normal then . 
   i meant those nefarious members of society , whichever society it may be . 
  are you telling me that every single time from [ 1650bce mediteranean ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretan_pederasty#history ) to [ 17th century north america ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pederasty#north_america ) the nefarious elements of society somehow won and turned everyone pedophile ( since you claimed you need sexual attraction to have sex with an adolescent ) or simply that until recently pederasty as an educational tool was pretty much the norm almost globally ? 
  * ** flatline ** ( 9/10 ) awesome doctor with one of the few bright moments of clara ( no more angst please ) . 
  monsters where very interesting . 
  * ** dark water/death in heaven ** ( 8.5 / 10 and 6/10 ) superb first part , flat second part .
