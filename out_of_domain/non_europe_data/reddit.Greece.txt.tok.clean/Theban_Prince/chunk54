  * ** listen ** ( 8/10 ) typical moffat fare , which is good , but disappointing ending, 
  * ** mummy on the orient express ** ( 8.5 / 10 ) a very good episode , the only thing that pissed me off was that the monster was a misunderstood creature ( again ! ), 
  * ** time heist ** ( 7/10 ) a very interesting idea ( a time traveler heist ! ), 
  that deteriorated with the usual fare of the doctor running from , wait for it , misunderstood creature . 
  * ** the caretaker ** ( 5/10 ) the only reason this episode exist is so danny can meet the doctor.needless angst all around . 
  * ** robot of sherwood ** ( 5/10 ) nonsensical episode that was admittedly , fun . 
  * ** into the dalek ** ( 4/10 ) a fantastic voyage ripoff with elements of `` dalek '' thrown in . 
  the doctor unfazed leaves a guy die without * any * reference afterwards . 
  * ** kill the moon ** ( 3/10 ) again a good premise that gets bogged down with angst ( really doctor after all those centuries interfaring you are going pontius pilate all of the sudden ? ), 
  and weird science and messages thrown in . 
  * ** deep breath ** ( 2/10 ) with the doctor a bubbling idiot for 2/3 of the episode , it falls to angsty guest stars to save london from guest starring robots that nobody cares about again . 
  * ** in the forest of the night ** ( 0/10 ) a sunday morning cartoon for pre-preschoolers with the doctor . 
  did they got the rights for captain planet ? 
  ** overall season score ** : 6/10 . 
  with a lot of lows ( in the forest , kill the moon ) but with * some * redeeming highs ( flatilne/dark water ) i think tha it is obvious the quality of the series is not something to take for granted anymore . 
  very high hopes for capaldi , i am praying oswald is finally off ( coleman is trying but i think the character is unsalvageable . ), 
  lets hope for a more robust 9th season . 
  the unfortunately you have a very narrow idea of how humans work . 
  i do n't want to break it for you but morals are not hardwired to our brain . 
  i dread what you think of other cultures . 
  way after the middle ages , right in the middle of renaissance so probably made for show . 
  traditional castle building was at its death throes ( if not already dead ) . 
   so i suppose it may not be so unreasonable to think that someone would build a castle in a non-strategic spot , like over a hot springs . 
  since the technology level of westeros is apparently high middle ages where gunpowder weapons do not exist in any significant numbers , giant castles would not be built without military reason . 
  you seem to confusing `` castle '' as a military building with `` castle '' as an architecture option . 
  structures with castle features where indeed built in no strategic spots , however they just looked like it and had zero military value . 
  they where glorified houses . 
  walls where thinner , fortifications where placed for show not function and siege capabilities where no existent . 
  it would be like i renovated my house with iron doors , some sandbags and a guard house prop and name it `` ft. theban base '' . 
  i do n't think it would count as a military base in any discussion . 
  so to conclude :, 
  * the technology to built geothermal heating was available for centuries, 
  * no castle implemented this because the effort would give back zero advantages , especially when cheaper alternatives existed . 
  no there are n't . 
  i counted 12 . 
  i have realized after a while that most of those people have mental/psychological issues . 
  so my rage is somewhat mellowed by sorrow for them . 
  i cant get angry to the homeless guy suffering a psychotic episode and bubbling about how `` everyone is about to get them '' . 
  if we use the same analogy as yours :, 
  cancer patients that were smokers should not receive medical treatment . 
  they knew they had chances to get sick , they had their fun , got burned , and have to deal with the consequences . 
  same goes with extreme sports fans , people that do n't wear seat belts and soldiers that singed up to go to a war zone . 
  drug users and alcoholics should be forced to deal with their choices , and legally denied any option to get out of their addiction . 
  also you are you implying that couples , even one night stands , should be forced to raise a child as a punishment ? 
   does everyone serious want to pretend [ data expunged ] was n't an episode ? 
  it was n't that bad . 
  certainly the weakest of the series but not terrible . 
  hmm i do n't remember adding a new chrome extension . 
  what where you talking about ? 
  sunset invasion was released * before * the republic and old gods . 
  it was actually the * third * ever major dlc for the new release model . 
  people understandably where worried that paradox might go full ahistorical . 
  i do n't think now that we have seen that they keep up the historical dlcs with some fun ones tucked in for variety we will have such a major shitstorm . 
  nobody freaked with random landmasses or rajas for example . 
  ( i freaked out for rajas because the map expansion was added to the free patch so it was not optional . 
  thank god for mods ), 
  you are an awesome dev and i love you for your converters . 
  does that help a little ? 
  i have seen you personally answering random comments about problems with the converters ( usually about tag and flag problems of course ) . 
  hope you have a day job in the field . 
  if you do n't , you should . 
  yup . 
  two dlcs that in hindsight were pretty basic ( soi basically added what you could get in ck1 with exploits ) so even more understandable to freak out . 
  precisely . 
  additionally shitstorm will be minimal if this is indeed about atlantis ( and probably will be similar with those ** colonial byzantium mods ** that are already popular ) because they went from annoyingly ahistorical ( aztecs invading ?!, 
  how is that fucking * possible * ?! ), 
  to simply full fantasy ( atlantis huh ? 
  yeah whatever lets see if this is any fun ) . 
  obviously not first hand experience ( ask me in about a week ) but two main points :, 
  first :, 
  in your free time google some tips/info about where you move . 
  this month you goggled about immigration laws , next week you might google best places to eat , two months later about funny cultural differences etc. , whatever pops into your head.add an rss feed for us news ( specific state ) . 
  do it your * hobby * . 
  this will help keeping your dream alive , and when you are eventually ready to go , your research will be there with minimal stress . 
  wax on , wax off for immigrants . 
  second :, 
  do ** ! not !, 
  ** rent a place without getting to see it . 
  about 30 % of the adds are scams with most common the one the the owner is abroad with the keys and he will come only if you send a guarantee . 
  i almost lost 700 euros to that . 
  better get a hotel room for the first days . 
  more to come i hope !, 
  well , mostly working shitty dead end jobs ( greek ) and saving up money for 1 year.we have not much , but i hope they can keep us afloat for the three months we are allowed to stay and/or we find a job . 
  we have issues with the two languages ( wallonian french and dutch flemish ) so i am trying to get a crush course in french ( not working ) and my fiance to dust them off , and obviously it is my main reason of concern . 
  other than that , researching for a decent room and roommates , what papers are needed about us , our dog , car , health insurance . 
  paperwork , paperwork . 
  i am using [ babbel ] ( http://uk.babbel.com/ ) which is subscription based but i am very happy so far . 
  i will try out duolingo to see what it offers when i have the time , so thanks for the tip !, 
  generation gap ^ ^ tm . 
  i think you mean 2000 's . 
  and it is like that for any generation . 
  nahh why follow official channels when he will just complain in reddit and be done for . 
  actually if this was a high class hotel you would be * required * to stack properly the cases . 
   thankfully i should be able to stay with my uncle in dc while i get that sorted out . 
  glad to hear it!we have an uncle in brussels also and believe me when the time comes it lifts a great burden to know that you have someone to fallback . 
  rage against the devs will exist for any platform , game or genre . 
  i think the majority now that paradox has shown their good run will be okay . 
  i only thought the sniper missed ( and indeed the video i have seen had the title suggest so ) and then the kid played possum ( / feign death ) . 
  after that i thought it was plausible the ( possibly surprised ) sniper kept missing such small targets . 
  rent , play 2-4 hours and decide if it is worth it .
