  :( we need to bring back demos . 
   - the guardians of the galaxy mix cd, 
   - watched interstellar . 
   - it is literally the best movie ever made . 
  i seriously cried four times . 
  straight . 
  i would kiss you after this . 
  your friends are not dangerous about embola . 
  they are extremely dangerous with their kid unvaccinated . 
  i am still dumbfounded no lawsuits are piling over there . 
  skyrim is the solution to everything . 
  gotg is the star wars to interstellar 's 2001 space odyssey . 
  are you an anime character ? 
  yes yes your mom is proud . 
  this.is . 
  so they went full [ gallipoli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallipoli_campaign ) on you . 
  well eventually most of them bow for another reason . 
  question :, 
  can this be used for power generation ? 
  if a very good lubricant is used , cant the rotation used with magnets turn to electricity ? 
  stare into the void mortal !, 
  [ do it like the austrians !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar%c3%a1nsebes ), 
  i was thinking a space station full of these rings that start with rocket fuel , and with good enough lubricant they keep spinning creating electricity . 
  but the magnets will slow them down so i was wrong . 
  do you want spit in your steak ? 
  because that 's how you get spit in your steak . 
  source : waiter, 
  if it is a c00024c or something error i had the same issue . 
  check drivers for everything . 
  after 20 formats i fixed it somehow . 
  i dont know what happened . 
  indeed the first drive was ready to die ( 10 formats ) . install new ssd with a hdd for data , turn on computer ... 
  aaaannnnd bsod . 
  10 random bsods + formats later it was fixed by itself . . 
  let 's be realistic , nobody should expect the majority of the early acess games to complete development . 
  people should have the mindset of an * investor * not of a * consumer * . 
  penis, 
  more like paris was calling itself a metropolis with 1184 permanent residents . 
  and then someone finally noticed that number is actually a typical french village . 
  at least the hotels are cheaper now !, 
   a scandal involving work for the government ... 
  let me guess , this takes place in the south of europe pre 2007 . 
  and this was a `` front '' company for getting eu/government money . 
  rather insignificant complain compared , but what irks me at no end the last months : content restriction like netflix , spotify , hulu , hbo etc. . 
  i am * trying * to give you money you dumbasses !, 
  year ? 
  us companies are a bitch enforcing it . 
  uk like bbc come close also . 
  honestly i am surpised . 
  switzeland was low in my list of expected countries . 
  spiders are the next best thing ... so you are having the same misconception all over again . 
  you almost drowned him , manhandled him and left him to die ... 
  i always wanted one of these . 
  but mostly as a hobby ( if i was super rich ) , like how i want to create a nbc shelter in my house, 
  i am perfectly aware that if l ever find myself seriously considering using it i will be only prolonging the inevitable . 
  the fall of civilization is a very nasty thing guys . 
  so picture it as a pricy train model diorama that offers marginal survival chances . 
   monopoly pricing especially would n't be a thing in a truly free market . 
  please explain that . 
  you can always find corn in a big pile of shit . 
  i think they knew what the experiment was , just not which day they will get the dose ( hence three days of water ) . 
  [ mostly to avoid this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adhschkx2zi ), 
  that actually brings a good question ... can you inherit accounts ? 
  i had both and so far i had done it two times . 
  it is simple , how cost effective is your action . 
  by your thinking , buying a car , donating to charity , ordering pizza and burning the money are equal actions . 
  society and even more , the economy does not work that way . 
  yes its * your * money and you can do whatever the hell you want with them , but that does n't stop * me * from calling you a dumbass . 
  as i said , it what you get for what you pay . 
  3000 $ for a car is normal . 
  or a transatlantic trip . 
  its too much for a dish in a restaurant because you are getting ripped off , so since you are actually `` donating '' the 2500 net gain to the restaurant willingly , hence the outcry . 
  does work that way.mistake, 
  it was an example.if you somehow managed to buy a nice car for 3000 , you would be applauded , instead of ridiculed . 
  you want the karma do n't you ? 
  whos a karma craving whore ? 
   right ? 
  it 's so easy . 
  lets just change careers while we are at it !, 
  i. . i am doing both ... and actually changing countries . 
  i keep hearing its extraordinary what i am trying . . why ? 
  scarring little children 's souls with presents . like the opposite of santa claus . 
  awesome * art * project . 
  no bogus claims here so what is the issue ? 
  your thought process can be applied to surgery . 
  why cut up with knives people that have suffered an injury ? 
  [ you are also using falling in a balance fallacy ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/balance_fallacy#external_links ) . 
  you reinveted the incendiary bomb !, 
  here is your darwin award !, 
  you found my easter egg !, 
  from ... nerds ?!, 
  i hope you are sarcastic . 
  noone that has been called that before 2004 forget the feeling . 
  sewer ... system ... of ... vegas ? 
  you can get sued by civilians everywhere . 
  police officers can simply get you right then and there .
