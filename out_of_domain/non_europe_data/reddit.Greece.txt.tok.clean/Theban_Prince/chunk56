   illuminati bibles, 
  hmmmm . . would i be a bad person if i started selling a book that supposed to be this to conspiracy theorists ? 
  the hilarious thing is that the name was chosen not by the founder , but [ by children ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dracorex#name ) . 
  technical no , but the price . . 
  i think he exposed gm private information a bannable offence by eula no ? 
  i just finished my apartment hunt . 
  you can get a two room apartment with half the money , easily . 
  if he published personal info , it a bannable offence . 
  `` i am doing some cool stuff sir ! '', 
  low hanging fruit i know . . 
  her and eva green . 
  if they both play in the same movie , we will need a new rating system . 
   all that kugu did was make public that two characters were owned by the same person . 
  thats doxxin of a dev ( even worse than a gm ) . 
  that permabans you in any mmorpg with more than 2 players . 
  he could expose the corruption without the toon info . 
  deal with it and stop being butthurt . 
   not any of that tactics crap, 
  if you ignore the lore problems ( real world weapons ) that game is awesome . 
  your loss . 
  the problem was that it had technology bluntly from the 90 's ( the hummer , some very obvious weapons ) while the main series stuck mostly around 50s-ish . 
  mind you , i didnt care , i love the game but just pointing what others hated . 
  i think to be honest when tactics was released people were angry because they wanted fallout 3 . 
  everything else was just details . 
  actually you are still one tribal that gets recruited and fixes things ( against one of the best villain army in fallout ) , but you are also a leader of a squad of misfits in midwestern bos . 
  nothing weird , since fallout 1 had teammates . 
  jorah the bear of bear island ? 
  tolkien was a scholar and indeed his mangum opus , the silmarillion , is writen like a historical document or a narrative like the norse sagas.good catch !, 
  i am far from an expert in the sagas . 
  however what i can explain is that tolkien based the themes of his stories from the northern europe mythology-history ( as you guessed , oral tradition meant those two got merged ) , greek tragedy and somewhat christian genesis ( might be unitentional , but his catholic belief shows ) . 
  all this are told in the silmarillion like from an ancient historians viewpoint . 
  read herodotus and you will notice also similarities . 
  really ? 
  because the social awkwardness you feel when you join an already established group can be considered late adopter cost . 
  paging scp foundation ... 
  you should reply more often , even if it is not a huge post that gets gold . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/02/eye-twitch.gif ), 
  i also mean making comments in general , being less of a lurker . 
  post your thoughts and do n't fear the karma . 
  i had comment chains get downvoted by two three people and then a single comment in another thread getting upvoted more that all the others combined . 
  edit : grammar, 
  find niche subreddits about stuff that interest you . 
  you will comment much more and you will get more karma since you will share opinions and trivia with others . 
  and that concludes karma farming 101 . 
  as experience by use of beer and running through the snow , only water in liquid form affects their breeding . 
  turn people into statues . 
  they will be unable to speak , sense , smell , hear but able to see without blinking or averting their eyes . 
  bonus points if the statue is the one above their own grave . 
   and could a virus or something theoretically infect the white blood cells and make them think your good cells are infected and basically make your body commit suicide ? 
  yes it is possible for the immune system to start attacking `` good cells '' . 
  it is called [ autoimmunity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autoimmunity ) . 
  there are various reasons that this happens , and a lot of diseases are actually caused by autoimmune response . 
   i could fuse a part of me to a friend . 
  a more mundane description of this is a transplant . 
  and yes unless you are very lucky the host body will try to kill the graft . 
  the one i am looking for : entry level it in belgium . 
  just moved here , and the usual salary is a lot of money for me . 
  plus i will succeed moving to a different career path ... 
  theres your problem . 
  all the other games are simply breaks when you are overdosed . 
  lets get the downvote train to oblivion together ... 
  what exactly was ** groundbreaking ** in this game ? 
  it feels like '' \u00c4merican beauty '' all over again , a good movie that everyone went insane about it and then promptly forgotten . 
  i feel naughty dog 's magnum opus is the uncharted series , and they are going to be classic for years to come . 
  2 adults , 4 huge bags of clothes totaling 70kg , 2 stuffed backpacks and a laptop = 170 euros for the other side of europe ( next best price was 220 euros , * per person * ) . 
  read the goddamn fine print and you are okay . 
  just replace `` groundbreaking '' with `` fantastic '' , `` best of all time '' etc etc, 
  the answer is very simple :, 
  just because everyone is doing something wrong , does n't make it right . 
  if you fire a shot over a very long distance , the bullet travels faster than sound . 
  just because you did n't hear it , that does n't mean the bullet was n't fired . 
  the event has happened . 
  the * light * ( like the sound in the above example ) is still traveling to us . 
  and then the suggestions about `` ebony porn '' has one called `` interracial gangbang with milf '' with auto preview on . 
  life ruined . 
  lets dont go down the hole about stuff that were even more commonplace than false advertising , and now they are shunned or even illegal . 
  i dont expect the companies to change their tune unless the consumers get pissed off , you know , like most of us in this thread . 
  prepare for the worst , hope for the best . 
  simple , elegant and applies from day trips to job interviews and major life decisions . 
  almost a jorah chibi !, 
  love it !, 
  sigurd was so manly he looked like 40 ( he even had a balding spot ! ), 
  when he turned 16 . 
  agggrr !, 
  can we make the automoderator spew anti peasant slogans like liberty prime from fallout 3 ? 
  examples :, 
  * '' ** automoderator is online . 
  ** all systems nominal . 
  weapons hot . 
  mission : the conversion of any and all console peasants . '', 
  * `` console peasantry is the very definition of failure . '', 
  * `` consoles are a temporary setback on the road to 4k . '', 
  * `` 24fps are a lie . '', 
  * `` peasantry detected on / r/pcmasterrace soil . 
  lethal force engaged . '', 
  * `` initiating directive 7395 destroy all peasants . '', 
  [ original quotes here . 
  ] ( http://fallout.gamepedia.com/liberty_prime#notable_quotes ), 
  so its true , sex is magic !, 
  he * blinks * half a second before the shot .
