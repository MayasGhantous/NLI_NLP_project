   macedonians were perceived as barbarians by the other greek city states as greeks used to do with hostile greek forces . 
  ftfy, 
  the greeks were from four different [ immigational waves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dorians ) . 
  that was used against each other in rhetorics and to justify war , as it was their political system ( oligarchy vs democracy ) , how they worshiped the gods etc etc. 
  its called slander , its part of propaganda , and greeks refined that too . 
  of course after alexander had built a mighty empire , everyone changed their tunes to get a piece of the pie . 
  that does n't change the fact that macedonia was of greek culture through and through . 
  elves and dwarves existed for centuries , but had very few in common with tolkien 's types . 
  just because batman is a `` superhero '' , we can '' t claim he is simply a copycat of superman . 
  he bumped the whole rack , and those look like dvd covers . 
  that are placed exactly like dominos . 
  i have read discussions that the last decades the world is experiencing the same frantic technological renovation and globalization analogous to pre ww1 years ( then mostly as an after effect of the industrial revolution and colonialism , these days due to the digital `` revolution `` and cheap travel ) . 
  however the same reasons that made those years great was the same reasons the great war happened . 
  lets hope we do n't do the same mistakes ( i am looking at you usual suspects , aggressive russia , scared europe and misguided usa ), 
   its some beast enterprise grade piece of hardware you ** snagged ** from your last company, 
   theres no wrong answer, 
  the misguided part is new but usa russia and europe are the usual suspects . 
  word war i seem such as unlikely then , especially how unprecedented destruction it would bring . 
  remember , there were plenty of `` proxy wars '' by the great powers in the late 19th century also . 
  xenophobia is rising right now due to immigration and economic recession . 
  i dont say it will happen , but its not impossible . 
  kerbal is a must !!!!, 
  he will learn orbital mechanics in two months and have also have a blast doing it . 
  it is the holy grail of the educational games of the 90 's . 
  its not hard to add something .

  while administratively it might not hold power over the city , the duke takes the title from it .

  there is an isometric zombie sandbox game called [ project zomboid ] ( http://projectzomboid.com/ ) that tries to do that scenario almost to a t . you start up in a big area that is has a city , farms , bars etc , with electricity and water and every house can be visited and looted . 
  but you have days before the utilities go out , and the houses start emptying ... 
  a `` byzantine '' emperor that early to the schism , and especially before the crowning of charlemagne is plausible to convert to catholic if he was butting heads with the patriarch . 
  on the other hand , that would sap power from him since he would have to acknowledge romes supremacy over constantinople ( never ) and tear the empire apart .

  there are hints that [ caradhras ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caradhras ) , the mountain itself somehow trying to take them down with rockslides and snow . 
  there is a link if you click the name that goes to wikipedia . 
  other sources are the friggin book . 
  i linked a wikipedia article that apparently you didnt even check . 
  because if you think that is not a reliable source , then you can check the sources listed . 
  and lo and behold , it points to '' * * the ring goes south ** is the third chapter of the second book in the fellowship of the ring .

   [ did you know that fox news star bill o\u2019reilley has been deceived by satan into ending his war on christmas ? 
  ] ( https://creationsciencestudy.wordpress.com/2014/12/ ), 
   because of a pew ( sic ) survey that shows that americans love jesus and know the christmas story is true . 
  that being said , the atheists have not given up the war . 
  they are still , even today , preparing to celebrate their ungodly celebrations of ** newtonmas ** , mocking the true christian holiday of christmas !,

  odd and whimsical is one thing ... sunday morning cartoon `` funny '' is another . 
  the dude has bird shit on his head and he is blowing smoke out of his ears . 
  labeling a movie/book `` for children '' and using that as an excuse for lowering the bar to 60 's hanna barbera standards is pretty condescending for the children and for adults . 
  they did it with star wars , they did it with batman and of course , the king of the trope , the american uwe boll , michael bay . 
  my previous comment covers that . 
  yes , it was a children 's book , and i was one that i had known what to expect . 
  however they just run of with it and placed `` jokes '' like that all over the place that had nothing to add to the story . 
  compare the fellowship of the ring , both book and movie . 
  there is comedy all over the place ( the tumbling after they farmer chases them off , the how many meals per day segment ) but is focused on the hobbits , and works with the narrative because it is establishes that they are innocents and carefree ( and somewhat naive ) but soon they are going to get thrusted into the world of the big men with all the dangers and darkness that brings . 
  after shit starts going down , the tone changes a lot , and while there are jokes , they are mostly brief and `` realistic '' like boromir fighting the hobbits or the gallows humor between gimli and legolas at the start of the helm 's deep siege . 
  this serves no point . 
  radagasts weird nature is established early on , yet it keeps brought up for no other purpose than `` see the weird wizard with the bird shit and laugh !, 
  we took all the undertones about the pipe smoking and turned him into a seth rogen stoner !, 
  laugh damn it '', 
  however since we have absolutely no information on what happened after the battle of endor ( yet ) , those are speculations *, 
  * that canon has been erased,
