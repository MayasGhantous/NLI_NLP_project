  the military worked perfectly the problem was that it was an invading force . 
  if there is ever a revolution in the us , a lot of the population for right or wrong will support the government . 
  even if civilians magically win against the strongest military in the world , no revolution ever has been won without outside influence . 
  so you would change a yoke for another one , possibly worse . 
  if we are going to do it the sensationalistic strawman way , then * [ 122 dead and 3060 ] ( http://pediatrics.about.com/od/safety/a/gun-accidents.htm ) * injured children * per year * trump 2 families that might have found other way than shooting people . 
  your thinking works only outside society . 
  nobody is going to leave you allone since you live a country with laws . 
  well the problem is that some situation can effect you either you want it or not . 
  an abortion is not going to get your son , nephew or best friend 's child brains plastered over his friend because they wanted to play with his fathers toys . 
  someone * else * doing hard drugs is n't going to do you any bad either , until a homeless addict just fresh out of penitentiary who had no social net catching him shanks your so for 5 dollars . 
  it all about liberty dammit . 
  source please ? 
  caesar was name from a family belonging to the julian clan ( roughly ) . 
  gaius octavius , the one we know as augustus and the first true roman emperor ( julius caesar was something like a modern day dictator ) was adopted by julius after his assassination . 
  octavian , to emphasize his connection called himself caesar . 
  the following emperors from the family did the same , and eventually all emperors used it even without any family connection at all , to legitimize their claim turning through the centuries a name to a self-given title . 
  [ do you want to know more ? 
  leave a clause on your will . 
  it regognized octavian as part of the family . 
  it happened a lot in patrician families . 
  but his adoption was the reason he pushed to be called caesar more , to strenthen the image of the true heir . 
  man i thought it was from an urban fantasy/horror anime like bleach first season . 
  dammit . 
  [ mira furlan ] ( http://s291.photobucket.com/user/starbuck_star/media/sci-fi%20snyggingar/babylon%205/mirafurlan1.jpg.html ) was a vintage babe ... 
  actually it is inferred that those people are actually spanish inquisitors from the 1500s . 
  the inquisition is infamous as an organization where anyone heretic ( or perceived such ) was tortured and burned in the name of god ( `` i have destroyed evil men for you '' ) . 
  apparently as punishment for being such hypocritical assholes ( `` i died by a sinful disease '' possibly gonorrhea from whores ) they got reincarnated ( by god ? ), 
  as pests . 
  scp-1535 only gives them voice . 
  so not only this is not a a scary scp , it actually proves that `` hell '' or `` bad karma '' exists and can get those that deserve . 
  quite uplifting . 
  i bet you did n't expect that . 
  thank god we are not dogs , or some offices would stink from urine . 
  best description of evolution for eli5 . 
  i honestly thought this was a remake from the first minutes of the trailer . 
  random stuff gets messed up every time the male bee fucks the female flower . 
  what works works . 
  as usual you are confusing believing there is a divine intelligence with a certain belief or dogma . 
  the question here is , would children grown without any belief to a god/gods at all , come to believe that there is something divine ? 
  there are indications that yes , [ there is a evolutionary reason for religion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolutionary_origin_of_religions ) and there is even a hypothesis that it is [ possibly influenced by a gene ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/god_gene ) . 
  i think the persistence of religion across every single culture through the millennia from the jungles of africa to the inuit is another indication that our brains have the tendency to wonder if there is something greater . 
  so while your child might never believe about a man walking into water , he might start thinking if a higher power ( luck?jesus?ufos ? ), 
  exists and controls his life . 
  he could take these thoughts seriously ( or not ) but take a group of children like that , and after a few years they might have they own good luck traditions ( common belief where a standard ritual can effect a random outcome ) . 
  eventually these traditions might form a proto-religion . 
  so * what * religion the child believes is very much cultural effected . 
  but the belief in a higher power with complex social customs might have deeper and more permanent roots . 
  religion is a worldview through and through . 
   why then christian instead of worshipping zeus ? 
  unsurprisingly , [ there is a \\ ( small \\ ) resurgence of the belief in the twelve gods of olympus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenism_%28religion%29 ) . 
  another point that peer pressure is not the only thing behind this complex thing we call religion and belief . 
   it 's a far leap from `` i think god exists '' to `` i think jesus was a real person who was the son of god and did the things in the new testament . '', 
  is the question about belief in something divine ( `` i think god exists '' ) or a specific dogma ? 
  ( ' `` i think jesus was a real person ' ) . 
  do n't confuse those two . 
  i think i am a 50 . 
  also known as a true agnostic . 
  i do n't know if a god exists , and the question is by definition unanswerable . 
  since this worldview provides definite answers and beliefs about the afterlife , i can safely say it is a religion . 
  thes question is :, 
  '' ** religion ** is still in society ... '', 
  so it is the former . 
   prove it . 
  that one of the tenets of buhdism is that a type of afterlife exists and your actions in your present life affect the other ? 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebirth_\\ ( buddhism \\ ) ), 
  i am not talking about deism , i am talking about religion as a belief to something divine irrelevant on the procedures , since the exact opposite in this debate according to op is atheism , the total disbelief in something divine . 
  `` god exists '' is the former , and how we ended there is irrelevant in this particular discussion since op only provided two options . 
  am i clear now ? 
   us deaf gamer , 
  you sneaky bastard . 
  i noteced what you did there . 
  then i think you need to re-read the whole post because it is obvious op is using religion as a synonym of `` belief '' instead of religion as an organized procedure witch answers if a divine exists . 
  tl ; dr yes you are a smart boy for knowing what deism is , but it has nothing to do with the present cmv . 
  so according to your understanding , kalama sutta can be used to challenge the buddhist belief on reincarnation ? 
  is reincarnation part of the buddhist philosophy/religion/whatever ? 
  if we take kalama sutta by heart , buhdism might be wrong since it ticks almost everyone of the wrong criteria . 
  yet if that is true , kalama sutta is wrong because it is part of buddhism . 
  congratulations , you created a religious grandfather paradox . 
  a religion is not self described . 
  if buddhism in not a religion then , despite having all the qualities of one even if * you * specifically do n't believe that , can there be a buddhist christian then ? 
  buddhist muslim or jehovah 's witness even ? 
  they can when they are among their peers . 
  or he just got confused.remember we have an biological clock that is influenced by the light of the sun . 
  you have to consciously remember what time is in another place . 
  especially if you do n't travel a lot . 
  i would love to hear a guy from se asia and not a westerner with second ( or third ) hand experience . 
  while you can follow the philosophy of a religion ( you can do that with anyone from muslim to rastafari ) but you are not a christian or a buddhist unless you believe some basic tenets are true i.e. 
  that jesus was the son of the god , or that karma and reincarnation are real and kicking . 
   people sue for nonsense, 
  true, 
   and win all the time, 
  not true . 
  if you are basing this fact from so called frivolous lawsuits like the lady with the hot coffee , you should research a bit and find that in most cases it was n't so frivolous as reported ( the lady got massive third degree burns and had to have reconstructive surgery for example ) or dismissed in court . 
  suing someone is not the same as winning the case . 
  smile and wave boys ... smile and wave . 
  getting killed by a loose tile is not the same as getting killed by a gun . 
  with the same reasoning you can get cancer without smoking , so why stop it ? 
  goverment already restricts or even bans some hard drugs . 
  and these substances only hurt others financialy ( cost of your treatment by state taxes ) .
