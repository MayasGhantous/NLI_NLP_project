  shut up bot . 
  this joke was a nice surprise since i am greek and i did n't expect to find one here :d . 
  by the way that dynasty name sounds like [ this . 
  ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1361358037_80714578.jpg ), 
  when i first watched got , i though i was watching crusader kings : the series.even worse with the tudors . 
  yup.me two days ago . 
  however , it can be so close to the original that it is virtually indistinguishable from inside observers . 
  with sufficient technology to get efficient conversion 99.99 . . % of the energy of the project . 
  right?and what stops that simulation from creating the same thing , going all russian doll in realities ? 
  more like a physics/philosophy discussion.what would be the problems/limitations really.like would be possible , since it is a completely new ( simulated ) universe , to override rules that govern the primary one , like the second law of the thermodynamics ? 
  and nothing matters because humanity as we know it is doomed either from extinction and/or evolution , humans like us are destined to vanish . 
  or the sun will get tired to wait and come to us ... as a [ red giant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sun#life_phases ) . 
  and all the mighty civilizations , all the technological progress , mona lisa , the alps , mt everest , australia with the great barrier reef , even the ** moon ** , literally everything we know , will only do a tiny , tiny , slight and invisible splash on the sun 's surface . 
  and vanish forever . 
  i do n't know what will happen in your brain if you see [ this picture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:abell_ngc2218_hst_big.jpg ) . those are not stars . 
  * they are galaxies *, 
  the first two gothic games were like that.open world rpg 's but the area was very limited.however every single square meter had either a npc with dialog , a random encounter with npcs or monsters , ruins etc etc.and really hard monsters that where area specific.so that forest next to the starting area?oh its open world , it should be easy right?you get mauled in 1 min by wild wolves.you have to play at least 5 hours to be ready to get in that forest.it will be a scary forest then , and not just for looks . 
  also the game is ridiculously old . 
  shame . 
  i loved the second one.even if it was kinda trippy story line wise . 
   darn ~ ~ brits ~ ~ world . 
  *** however *** , usually if a famous person is known for their title , and no other notable person with the same status exists , it is not rare to call them by that title.caesar , kaiser , emperor , president comes to mind ( for example , if you are in uk and say something `` about the queen '' everyone will understand who you are talking about , even if there are other queens out there ) . even for baratheon it would be proper , if he was the only notable king on the show/books . considering the story , it is obviously not . 
  we could sent a specialized vehicle in to the core and nuke it so it restarts . 
  oh thank you very much , i am on the world of [ before sunset ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/before_sunset ) . i could be in a world where magic exists or angels are real , or you can get 1 million dollars just with a blank check.but no.i am stuck in world * more boring than the real one !, 
  just . . do n't play any drinking game considering science.you would be dead before the first scenes are over, 
  impossible !, 
  once the reaction starts , it 'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet . 
  mars will go into global meltdown . 
  that 's why the aliens never turned it on . 
   i think taking a drink every time they got something right would be safe . 
  hey it would be nice trick for aa support !, 
  from a discussion in / r/gaming about people who played games taking place on their cities , most said that they do n't really look like the real ones.especially i remember a post about washington d.c from fallout 3, 
  well gameplay and engine limitation overrule the city design obviously.at least fallout has the alternate timeline excuse.other games not so much . 
  what exactly ? 
  bigger is better correct ? 
  so as always moar rockets !, 
  lunar hill , meet jeb . 
  uhhh i hate myself , but that symbol is about [ biological danger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_hazard ) , not radioactive . 
  lets hope he is working somewhere far far away from both symbols . 
  both hilarious actually . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niooj6ftzq8 ), 
  i had it happen to my frisian game.try without any mods in both games and re convert it.it fixed mine , hopefully yours too . 
  i have the suspicion that in mine the versions were incompatible . steam updated one of the two games and broke the converted save.hopefully you will play your game properly . 
  while far from a pc wiz , i do n't think that you break your game.remember that the game generates error reports in your . . / my documents/paradox interactive/europa universalis 4 folder if it crashes again , check the logs there , you might get an idea . 
  then google for a solution or contact the paradox support . 
  and now you wish this was crusader kings .

  it was my pleasure helping you . 
   does this mean then that the cold war was a * radioactive * rubber dick sword fight ? 
  that . 
  holy shit monty pythons are back ? 
  you know what is amazing?just 15 years ago , if this has happened they would not have phone cameras to record it.and no one , * no one * would believe that they where besieged by a snake for 10 mins in they own fucking car . 
  yeahhh ... i think you should move to another continent then . 
  you fucking cunt , now you pissed me and i am going to come in side and fuck up both your mate and your sissy ass.open the fucking window you fucking cunts !, 
  oh then you should move to another planet then.or a [ sterilized area like this .

  they are.just not from a fiery death . decapitation , crushed head and punctured body on the other hand . . 
  you can also play the game from vic2 to hearts of iron and when it is out , possibly to hearts of iron : east vs west.so you could possibly play a game from 876 ad to 1991ad . 
  kiss your life goodbye . 
  ehmm how is that euiv -  vic 2 going ? 
  you know you would be beloved if that happen right?also why not focus on the euiv version?surely it will become way more popular.i also pm you . 
   videos of rape fantasies, 
  fantasies are fantasies.i can fantasize how it would be to live like a wild animal , and enjoy that fantasy , but that does not mean i would go live naked in the woods , neither i would persuade others to do it . 
   have fraternities that enjoy objectifying , drugging , and raping women without repercussions . 
  you know about those fraternities * because * they suffer repercussions ( as they should be ) . if everyone heard about a gang rape and was like `` meh '' you would n't be able to throw a fit here.same goes about the military/prison stuff.that means everything is ok in this places?of course not , but western society does not condone it . 
   yea . 
  real fucking progressive . 
  so we do n't openly negotiate for raping women . 
  good fucking job western society . 
  we are slightly different in how we are still our animal selves . 
  yes , we do n't have a perfect utopia.of course we are not a perfect world , where objectification of both sexes does n't exist , rape so reprehensible and so easy to prove beyond doubt , that the rapers are found and sent to prison immediately , and the victims have 100 % support.however western society is at least ** trying ** and is * way * better that 2/3 of the world regarding this matter . 
  so take your edgy nihillism somewhere else please . 
  it is still there . 
  you saw those links , with those strange and intriguing titles .

  '' [ berserk button ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/berserkbutton ) '' was another to catch your eye , but you held your resolve.but it will be there in the back of your mind.and one day , maybe next week , maybe even this weekend , you will find yourself bored.reddit will not bring new interesting stuff to pass your time , even if you refresh and refresh.news would be slow , and social sites will be the same boring glurge soup as always.and you will still have this nugging feeling.you will decide to just look one , a single page to to quench your curiosity . 
  [ and then you would be lost to us . ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/tvtropeswillruinyourlife ) .

  [ you are doomed with him ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/nightmarefuel ) . each and every one of you . 
  i think it is a combination of [ uncanny valley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uncanny_valley ) and [ apophenia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apophenia ) . the uncanny valley helps with the creepy feeling , because the game worlds/leves are almost like our world our brain knows , and yet they are looking distorted even so slightly to discomfort us , and apophenia works to give a feeling and a story to the empty halls and caves of both games.you see an empty cup placed on the floor of the game . 
  usually you would n't mind , but when you are focused on exploration , like it happens with games , your brain tries to find as much info as possible.it keeps asking `` why is that cup there?who left it?why ? ** why ** ? ** why ?!, 
  ** '' and if no answer is coming , it would look around and try to fill the missing pieces `` oh there are some boots on the other side of the room.maybe their owner left the cup.but where and who ? 
  '' . and so on and on.but if you find a huge , bloody trident instead of the cup , with a note attached `` the final boss pierced the wall here '' you have 100 % the information you brain needs , nothing need to be decoded , and pretty soon is forgotten . 
  you really , really do n't make any sense.at all . 
  an even better example would be winston churchill.great wartime leader , bad during peace time.that did n't lower how many `` good '' thing he did during wartime . 
  and guess what.i am back.and the game runs as smooth as persian silk.it is hilarious , but it is actually even faster than euiii in late game.how it feels to be so wrong ? 
  immensely . 
  both for the results and keeping my promise . 
  and fyi , `` gay '' is n't exactly a derogatory term nowadays . 
  get with the new age buddy . 
  what exactly is to know?do i have to know murder to find it wrong , or that most of us outside your bubble try to stop it?millions of dollars and eurow are spent every year towards victim support , new legislation and public awareness campaigns.but no , we are beast with our dicks out trying to find others to rape.right .

  i think i heard an arma fan crying . 
  uhh you should never ever play [ wwii online : battleground europe ] ( http://www.battlegroundeurope.net/home ) then.you first 2 days of playing will consist of running headlong , hearing a * zzzit * * < ping  * and black screen of death.or play it to experience how much lethal was ww2 for rookies.awesome game , that makes arma look feel like a railshooter.too bad the company that makes it is small and graphics are awful .
