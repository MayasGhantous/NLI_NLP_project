  i do n't think so . 
  yeah i know , this one . 
  but a porn parody would be awesome . 
  the cock-ring and the 9 slut wraiths . 
  the us are one the least efficient countries out there . 
  you can have all those stuff without overdoing it . 
   or are you saying americans are somehow culturally inferior, 
  all i am saying is that there are lots of rich nations out there that are not as inefficient as the usa ( always scaled to population and other parameters ) . 
  if it is culture the problem or not , i just [ give the numbers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_energy_consumption_per_capita#mediaviewer/file:energy_use_per_capita.png ) . 
  really ? 
  because i am seeing france and germany , some very mature economies , combined are consuming as much as usa alone . 
  i dint say the us are the worst . 
  i pointed out that you can have a western level of luxuries , without being inefiecient . 
  examples are the uk , france and germany , heavy industrial nations . 
  as you just pointed out , after a certain level you can have a stable or declining population with full luxuries.you contradict yourself a bit there . 
  it is as the previous commented said , yet then you stated it is impossible , that when * those * economies mature , population will decline and the issues will stabilize . 
  china has signs that her populations boom is ending * already * . 
   ** it 's not about total population ** , it 's about lifestyle . 
   ** if you do n't think 3 billion ** indians , chinese , and africans want cars and air conditioning and electronics and appliances , you 're fooling yourself . 
  can you decide please ? 
  either it is a population problem , that we established will level off , or it is a lifestyle problem , which we demonstrated with the examples of germany and france that you can have without fucking up the environment . 
  there are great industrial countries there like germany , france with better efficiency . 
  i am not comparing a mini cooper with a bus ( ? ), 
  i am comparing two trucks . 
  one comes first , the other comes second . 
  but the first one used 100 % more gas . 
  is there major difference on standards of livingon how between western europe and the us ? 
  well no , but 1 in 1000 mistakes is better than 1 in 100 . 
  with the same logic lets disband firefighters , doctors and judges . 
  i bet they do mistakes too , so why not let the citizens handle themselves . 
  macedonian?aren ' t they greek ? 
  she is so perfect she goes to uncanny valley . 
  the lander and capsule are visible while in orbit . 
  and that is great!i merely stated that the us is bad example right now and overpopulation issues are not unsolvable if we account other western nations . 
  i hope there is a specific circle in hell reserved for those people . 
  `` just get by '', 
  `` get by '' means having just the basics for survival . 
  those are not the human basic needs . 
  i do n't want to break it for you , but that should be in greek ... 
  even worse then . 
  also `` alexandropolis '' instead of constantinople indicates greek . 
  i am sorry but there is n't any greek word there . 
  but awesome map . 
  i was just pointing it because i would love to see it in greek . 
  also plug for / r/worldbuilding if you are not yet aware of that sub . 
   and we 're just one country, 
  united state *** s *** of america, 
  as other pointed out , you can find a page in english wikipedia and switch it to greek . 
  it would be modern greek , but better than modern english . 
  also , angel-statue of liberty . 
  how is that even fucking possible ? 
  one of the most glorious events to ever happen to me . 
  regent throws my 6 y.o. 
  king out of a tower . 
  i am angry since he is my second to last true heir and to be honest , a little bit shocked because this is the first time it happens to me . 
  as i am steaming , the dead kings twin brother and my new heir , gets this event a few days later . 
  `` charge little knight !, 
  take revenge in the name of your assassinated brother !, 
  kill that bastard ! '', 
  perfect rng moment . 
  present technology will not allow the us to be unscathed this time . 
  no they are not . 
  remind me how many major populations centers , industrial areas , and civilians got bombed ? 
  hell even your military losses are not that great compared to other combatants . 
  is there a curse that every text that includes the words `` harry potter '' has to turn into a weird fanfic ? 
  killed . 
  i may or may not have screamed a `` yes !, 
  ~ ~ die ~ ~ fly you double-crossing bitch !, 
  oh i have a very good idea and i am not even from there . 
  the scary thing is that reddit 's major userbase means you are from the us , and you have no idea of your nations history ( and how close the states came to became autonomous countries ) or the quantitative differences with the countries of europe . 
  next thing you say the russian * federation * is `` just one country '' like portugal . 
  the patronizing started elsewhere . 
  `` you do n't know about us at all '', 
  saying the us is just one country is like saying an elephant is an animal . 
  a mouse is an animal also . 
  that does n't mean you can compare them in all aspects . 
  `` oh look the animal we call mouse cant bring a tree down , but a single elephant can ! '', 
  the us is a union of states ( duh !, 
  ) , most of them able to stand as their own . 
  while politically they are one country , you ca n't compare them in numbers as * just * one country . 
  you do n't need to write your address you know . 
  oh do n't bring veterans sentimentality on me . 
  i do n't dismiss them . 
  every single life lost is one more than it should . 
  but . . 
  i only stated that the us suffered minimal damage compared to other nations . 
  most nations had over 4 % loss of total population , military or civilian , with some cases reaching 10 % -16 % . 
  in comparison , the us lost ** [ 0.3 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties ) . 
  ** this is just population loss , without taking account the staggering material and infrastructure losses in the fighting . 
  i think in comparison , untouched is a correct term . 
  you do n't even understand my argument . 
  you just picked a part of my comment and you are discussing semantics . 
  just to get you on track and save your fingers from all that unnecessary wall of text , my problem was that in the original comment :, 
   nasa budget of 18.4 billion , compared with esa of 5.5 billion . 
  and we 're ** just one country . 
  but the us is not * just some * country , but a country comprised of state ** s ** ( hence my bolding for the plural ) each individually strong enough to be one the same level ( or more ! ), 
  with a lot of other independent countries . 
  if the eu ever becomes a single country i would never say :, 
   the esa budget of 18.4 billion , compared with the bangladesh space agency of 5.5 billion . 
  and we 're * just * one country .
