  do you seriously fucking thought i did n't know the us where a single country ? 
  do i need to explain in specific detail what i mean or the lawyers of reddit like yourself will latch to a part of my comment and argue every single definition there is ? 
  who the hell is patronizing when you thought so about me and send me a wall of text explaining how the us supreme court works like i am a child ? 
  i am not saying the us is not a country . 
  but most states could be its own individual country easily . 
  they almost where . 
  the country is a union of these mostly powerful and wealthy states . 
  so comparing it fiscally and saying just one country like the others is dumb . 
   you repeated , over and over , that the us is n't a country . 
   . . and you have no idea of ** your nations ** history ( ** and how close the states came to became autonomous countries ** ) or ** the quantitative ** differences with the countries of europe . 
  please point me where i said so . 
  you seem you missed the part about comparing a mouse and an elephant because they are both animals . 
  do i need to explain to you a first grade example ? 
  also states * are * equal to a lot of countries . 
  not politically as i repeatedly stated in every comment i posted yet you cant for some reason read , but * quantitive * . 
  and that 's because the us is a union of wealthy states that decided to be one country . 
  the eu is not even halfway there , but it could be . 
  if it will ever be , would you say the eu is `` just your run on the mill country '' ? 
  true cringe even . 
  where there is an embarrassing thing that could happen to anyone so we feel half ashamed by proxy . 
  not just some people with obvious issues to point and laugh about ( looking at you / r/cringepics ) . 
  yeah because being a christian means belonging to a uniform and clear group of people that have n't questioned , debated and fought over their faith since literally the 34 ad . 
  you are christian or not and that 's final . 
  because you are confusing dogma with beliefs . 
  a dogma of a specific sect ca n't change a lot , because if you change it a lot you are creating your own . 
  i believe that jesus was the son of god , but i do n't believe everything in the old testament is divine . 
  hell even the new testament is written by human hands . 
  while that puts me against most sects , you ca n't say i am not a christian . 
  ** welcome to reddit !, 
  ** flashes in front of him . 
  or that among thousands of people in reddit , could there be some that think good about nissan ? 
  and the ceo obviously preferred to answer those ? 
  ( gasp ) ... inconceivable !, 
  occam 's razor . 
  you broke it . 
  \u00cf just did that !, 
  hope i made you warm and fuzzy !, 
  - but prince-bishop , we are in a banquet * right now * !, 
  - ... and did you enjoy your wine , shire ? 
  think citizenship like a membership to a club . 
  the members of the club gather and vote a board ( the government ) and that board under mandate by the members , amongst other duties , rectifies the processes the rights , but also the obligations any members new and old have . 
  some members do n't follow those obligations , so they are expelled with due process . 
  citizenship is not a basic human right , neither is enforced by nature or law , its an obligation to a group of people that gives also some rights inside that group . 
  so it can be revoked . 
  and who can decide that except the government ? 
  was that a bad ama ? 
  maybe , or maybe not . 
  was in that ama :, 
   companies that just have reddit accounts lying around for this stuff that might have been hired by nissan pr ... 
   ... brought in some astroturf accounts, 
  i do n't think so . 
  as others pointed out yet you refuse to admit that there might never been any shills at all . 
  i did n't know shills are so honest with where they work . 
   german toilets, 
  another reason to stay away from that country . 
  cameras , microphones , x-rays , satellites , and the stool is secretly scooped by an nsa intern for further analysis . 
  well that the first time i do n't agree with the human rights declaration . 
  while i have the suspicion that part refers to autocratic type of governments ( so they ca n't suppress individuals under the pretext of non-citizens ) instead of democratically elected , that distinction indeed does not exist . 
  however , de facto that does n't work , and i am okay with that . 
  do i need to paint a fucking big red flashing ** / s ** next to my comment ? 
  '' [ heil honey i 'm home ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heil_honey_i%27m_home ! ) ! '', 
  might interest you . 
  would you expect a shill to actually come upfont and say that he was affiliated with nissan ? 
  neither did i. 
  * i was sarcastic to the redditors that actually believe that shit and started the witch hunt . 
   however , given the ** evidence ** , my personal opinion is that there were indeed shill accounts used to boost the appearance of nissan . 
   ... unfortunately there is no ** proof ** of the matter . 
  did evidence stopped being a synonym of proof when i was n't looking ? 
   my view on life is that things are always possible even with evidence heavily in one direction, 
  i have the assumption that obama is the long lost conjoined sister of putin . 
  there is evidence that points heavily in the opposite direction . 
  do you believe me ? 
  ohh loaded question . 
  no , i am saying that the writings are written by human hands , so you need to study them to actually glimpse their true meanings and interpretations . 
  because there no one to judge you as a believer except god . 
  are a census company ? 
  are you even french ? 
   literally written by hand, 
  dammit . 
  `` too many cooks '' was the wacky short lived spin off . 
  guyyss r/conspiracy is leaking !, 
  its canon from the book . 
  also the ringwraiths are badass . 
  throw him where morgoth is and let them duke it ou . 
  while they place bets . 
  when ao decides the gods are ok to come back . 
  or be accessed by a human that his mind have been invaded by the ai , so he can use it to fry humanity 's defenses . 
  that 's the thing that really riled you up ? 
  a scene that directly ties hobbit with lotr , is canon , it explains major plot holes like just where the hell gandalf had to go and leave the protagonists alone , and also some awesome scenes . 
  but this is where you draw the line . 
  not in the video game physics of fight scenes . 
  not in the shoehorned love triangle or characters that do n't exist at all , or are caricatures of the one from the books . 
  tl ; dr : the timing of the events was ok . 
  first gandalf gets inside dol guldur to find who is the necromancer . 
  he finds thorin 's father and gets the key and the map . 
  he is fairly sure that the necromancer is sauron , but the white council is held back from saruman , who secretly wants to leave sauron alone so he might get info about the location of the ring ( and he suspects that sauron is looking around where isildur died , hence another reason why he moved in dol guldur , close to the area , instead of mordor ) . 
  saruman looks around that area too , and finds the original elendilmir and probably isildur 's bones , which presumably burns in his furnaces . 
  eventually saruman has enough info , and wants to kick sauron out of the area so he can have it for himself . 
  hence gandalf is recalled from his quest with the dwarves so urgently , and why it takes him so much time to get back . 
   trying to distance themselves from it and villianize it .
