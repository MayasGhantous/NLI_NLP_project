  i fart in your general direction !, 
  your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries '', 
  hipster aztec , exporting freedom before it was cool . 
  appently they did a shitty job because that movie made me interested about diamonds and this is how i learned about the company 's `` practices '' . 
  so they worked like the fantasy drug dealers for whom my parents warned me ? 
  nobody talks how they did that in greece with the help of corrupted politicians and eveyone blames only the country :(, 
  we are a niche of a niche . 
  obviously if the main got subs are getting slow we would be even worse . 
  blasphemer !, 
  i think you need to read a [ little ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lymantria_dispar_dispar#introduction_to_north_america ) bit more about accidental release of [ invasive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/africanized_bee#history ) [ species . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabbits_in_australia#history ), 
  to add to / u/palindromereverser , testing and deploying technology in earth is way cheaper than sending it to space . 
  so they test and evolve their robots while getting science points too !, 
  double win !, 
  if you nerf the problem nations you are nerfing them permanently so there goes the `` alternate '' from the `` alternate history '' . 
  if you change the starting positions/provinces you wipe out the `` history part '' . 
  but this is the same reason i get a little bit angry with the early starting dates in ck2 . 
  pagans are way more stable and long living than in real life . 
  i will spread my anus for a pirate ( caribbean and mediterranean ) dlc . 
  a bastard child of the old gods with some republic style for pirate ports ... . gnnnhhhhhhh, 
  you tell that like it is an option . 
  well ... 
  i am ready . 
  i spread my ass-chicks for johan . 
  or when an obscure mechanic ruins your game like winning your independence as a merchant only for the game to end because you cant have an inland capital . 
  or when you hauled your entire norse army all the way to rome to burn the entire italy , only to discover you have n't made them raiders . 
  or when your hre liege decides to join the fight for 1 province in spain , wipes his entire armies from attrition , and leaves you to get eaten by pagans . 
  for christ 's shake zlata , for the last time , stop humping my leg !, 
  1 . light is captured between the mirrors . 
  keep capturing as much light as possible . 
  3 . drill a hole so all this captured light escapes in a concentrated beam . 
  personal death ray !, 
  is this like a private club ? 
  where do i sign up ? 
  i was commenting for iron man in general but since i have much more experience with ck2 , i used those examples that happened to me . 
  but i know there are issues in eu4 . 
  the parthenon and the acropolis are all wrong , and most the buildings next to it are actually like they are now , in ruins , instead as they should . 
  also the hill is much much more lower . 
  also i dont know what the tower in the horizon is ( lighthouse ? ), 
  but it did n't exist . 
  but you can see the sea , if only further away . 
  great fantasy image , but very far from the truth . 
  source : am greek, 
  help appreciated even if it was unwarranted !, 
   it was n't much of a cover up job , anyone with a basic understanding of economics knew that situation was going to explode . 
  i do n't think you have a single idea what you are talking about . 
  [ greek politicians fudged the numbers with the help of goldman-sachs so nobody in europe or greece knew what the debt was until 2010 that became public . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greek-debt-crisis-how-goldman-sachs-helped-greece-to-mask-its-true-debt-a-676634.html ) . are you telling me your high school teacher had inside information before the eu organizations ? 
  so you can say ... he had balance with the force ? 
  i know you do n't probably decide but ** thank you ** . 
  but of course . 
  they have us europeans at each others throats and for them it is business as usual . 
  at first it was a tradition for the president to run for two terms maximum , because washington served two . 
  while not forbidden by law , a president trying to get more would appear to think he is better than washigton , and also that he is trying to establish a president-for-life scheme . 
  while * some * tried , only one managed to get elected for more than two terms . 
  the only president to accomplish that was [ f.d. 
  roosevelt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franklin_d._roosevelt ) who served for four ( ! ), 
  terms before and during ww2 . 
  after him , the maximum two terms became mandatory [ by law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-second_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) so nobody can do that again . 
  hear hear . 
   mass media making it so that the richest/most heavily bribed person generally wins ? 
  why do you think this problem will go away , instead of getting worse with direct voting ? 
  the only information source people have are not committees or hell even lobbyists , but fox news . 
  imagine if antivaxxers could request a vote for amendments and then the media picking up and running the asylum ... 
  sick and vacations days with pay are * not * mandatory in the us ?!, 
  wtf . 
  by `` education '' you mean companies will buy ad space in the media , and possibly own directly the media themselves even worse than now ... yeah nothing wrong with that . 
  if you think the only problems are politicians and parties well think again . 
  the problem is lack of proper education , and who they choose based on that education and `` direct '' democracy will only make it worse . 
  if according to you people fuck up for an election once in four years , what will happen with elections happen every other week or month ? 
  people will vote with 100 % sentimentality on what it is hot stuff in the news . 
  or the voting participation will go down the drain . 
  also who will draft the oh so precise laws and decisions ? 
  run the agencies that need to do undercover stuff ? 
  elect the generals ? 
  send diplomats to missions ? 
  just read a bit what direct democracy did to ancient athens . 
  the word `` sycophant '' comes from there because it was so damn effective to play the masses against your opponent with some good pr in the heat of the moment . 
  the [ sicilian expedition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_expedition ) is a perfect example what a clustefuck direct democracy can be . 
  or just send the full nazgul team . 
  they are essential extensions of sauron 's will and i think combined can take a dragon down . 
  use the shuttle , its the best option hands down . 
  it is cheaper than taxis by a huge margin , not that expensive compared to public transport and it is right outside the airport exit . 
  and it disembarks right next to a station and a taxi waiting area . 
  just another heads up . 
  gare du midi in brussels has a very seedy fame after sundown . 
  so plan your arrival time accordingly . 
  seriously though , universal healthcare is one of ~ ~ socialism 's best aspects ~ ~ common sense . 
  the two issues people have with stormtroopers and their efficiency are easily explainable : in the first movie , the plans of the death star are a bait . 
  they left leia to get saved by luke and co. so she can lead them to the rebel base , which she does and the imperials then proceed to kick asses . 
  if it was n't luke with han and the force , the rebel 's where finito . 
  in hoth , again the troopers are with direct orders to be carefull so vader can get luke . 
  a jedi is worth hundreds of common soldiers lives . 
   hundreds of thousands of turks, 
  what ?!, 
  the worst atrocity we did was in the [ siege of tripolitsa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_tripolitsa ) , and that amounted to ~ ~ 8000 ~ ~ 20000 victims , at worst . 
  a * despicable * action , that was decried by most greeks themselves ( the greek commander in chief got between the looters and some people trying to save them for example ) . 
  where did you get the `` hundreds of thousands '' ? 
  and we at least acknowledge the massacre for what it is and actually teach it in schools ( cough smyrna cough armenia . ), 
  please proceed to the blinding & castrating chamber as appropriate .
