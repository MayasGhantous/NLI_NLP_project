  dont scare urist mcboinkage !, 
  leave his jugular alone !, 
  bad dorfy !, 
  i started a shop . 
  i never had to bribe once . 
  but having to pay as much as my normal expences to tax and social security by the second month crippled me . 
  give a gracing period you fucks !, 
  1 year lost means 30 years gained !, 
  it really pisses me off when they name call a group of people without consequences . 
  if you changed `` greeks '' with any other nationality or race , shit would hit the fan in light speed . 
  hell russia is invading another country and most criticism goes to putin , not to the russians . 
  i always payed my taxes . 
  am i not greek or i am still corrupted anyways ? 
  so no , not everyone is a money grabbing lazybone . 
  however , for more than 30 years we had corrupted politicians in collusion with corrupted greek * and * foreign business , and it was common knowledge , but nobody did anything because a ) ** they got some fabulous shit done ** . 
  we where the leading economy in the balkans , and probably the whole eastern europe for a while . 
  we got the olympic games , we where accepted in the eurozone , we had a super modern army and since the global bank bubble was good , we could get loans by the shitload . 
  and b ) ** nobody knew the full extent of the corruption ** and the underlying problems . 
  do you thing every greek was in when the government hidden the debt with goldman sachs ? 
  or when billions where going to samsung for arms , communication and hospital contracts everyone got a memo ? 
  so , no , not all the greeks where money grabbers , but i blame us for looking the other way for the small everyday corruption and inefficiency , because that allowed the huge ones to thrive . 
  and we are paying for this dearly . 
  do we have to get annihilated as an example ? 
  as for now , corruption in the public offices are not as overt as before . 
  but in the private sector it is more rampant due to the fiscal measures taken . 
  when you have a failing business , you are not going to pay taxes . 
  what are they going to do ? 
  arrest you and everyone else ? 
  you are not going to pay social security for your employees either , and they will accept that because the alternative is unemployment . 
   inflammation, 
  is n't actually beneficial unless it starts damaging healthy areas ? 
  inflammation means in the absent of a medicine , the body is trying to clean up itself ? 
  so something that fights the inflammation instead of the reason is dangerous ? 
  i know , i was just giving some insights from the other side . 
  what terrifies me is that no one takes notice from greece and realize that hardships are just one step behind you , that this could happen to everyone . 
  i recently moved to belgium . 
  life here is not that different from greece either as working hours or as social life . 
  it could happen to them also if they relax their guard just a little . 
  but it is easier to accuse a specific nationality , because it keeps your own fear away . 
  i was super lucky to catch `` blink '' on syndication . 
  til people in the 50 's where faster than light . 
  by the time your mind registers the fireball , you are either burned or not , depending on distance . 
  there is nothing you can do about it . covering yourself * maybe * will save you from the shockwave . 
  care to explain ? 
  because from what i read acute inflammation is generally good and pretty common like when you cut yourself . 
  chronic inflammation ( and other types ) as i stated is bad . 
  but `` inflamation '' in general means your immune system is working . 
  serious sam is the child of duke nukem and doom . 
  / u/darrian 's version of doom is not exactly close to the original . 
  while doom was gun-ho gameplay wise , it also had a very , very creepy atmosphere . 
  just not survival horror levels . 
  imagine if someone dropped you in event horizon with a minigun . 
  yet they used plausible * sounding * myths in the early years . 
  to bad they did n't had duct tape is cyrodiil . . 
  so , we are in agreement ? 
   and you are so kind that you can stay at my place !, 
  that actually defeats the purpose of his visit ... 
   for it with federal money, 
  aka bail out money in the eu . 
  money everyone is whining about for giving in greece , when they do n't understand we are a fiscal union . 
  sih . . i said when it is working as it should . 
  sih . . i said when it is working as it should . 
  however would it be still owned by mcdonalds ? 
  have the connection with the brand name ? 
  could someone say mcdonalds = strippers and be right ? 
  i am not arguing about parental control here , i know this is possible and you are nitpicking . 
  i am talking about tarnishing the image of the company for pitiful returns compared . 
  from the top of my head :, 
  * add a couple of moderators . 
  more people means more ideas . 
  * add / u/automoderator . it solves a lot of problems that reddit should had by default . 
  * promote in * any * reveland subreddit . 
  not only / r/europe or / r/belgium , but any subrredit that deals with meta . 
  * add a rss feed in your browser . 
  tailor it so you get news about the city . 
  post them here . 
  * create subreddits for other cities.for example / r/antwerp . 
  become the head moderator and find new guys to deal with the day to day stuff . 
  create a list with all the subreddits ( like / r/europe has with all the indiviual countries ), 
  * monthly or weekly discuss your commune threads . 
  * monthly or weekly expats vs locals threads.nothing better to attract interest than a friendly banter . 
  always civil . 
  as for moderation , common sense should prevail . 
  edit : apparently / r/antwerpen exist . 
  get in touch with them !, 
  link each other !, 
  i am european . 
  i have visited and lived in three countries , greece , uk and belgium . 
  nowhere there is what you describe , except for stuff like condoms in supermarkets that are sold under the `` hygiene products '' label and i have yet to see a big company with general stores to offer risque items or services . 
  or does carrefour has a subsidiary of sex shops that i am unaware ? 
  it starts after it 's formation . 
  a generic convenience store has no brand name so it is inapplicable . 
  no tv coverage there !, 
  and i have been to 4 carefour convenience stores ( aka express ) just two days ago and i have n't seen a single adult magazine . 
  what a surprise . 
  but i digress , becasue that was an example . 
  the * real * answer is , and you fail to grasp , are there great chances for uproar if steam adds hentai games ? 
  i hope you are aware the `` scandals '' of hot coffee , mass effect and gamersgate to name a few . 
  even with adult locks , even if they do n't advertise , what would be the chances of moral guardians , for right or wrong , rising a huge ruckus on fox ? 
  also *** playboy *** is porn ?
