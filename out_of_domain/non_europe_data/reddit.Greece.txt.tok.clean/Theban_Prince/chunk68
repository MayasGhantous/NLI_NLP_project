  how old are you ? 
  even with adult locks , even if they do n't advertise , what would be the chances of moral guardians , for right or wrong , rising a huge ruckus on fox ? 
  if only the british were part of a union where these tactics would never work because there are no trade restrictions ... 
  [ oh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) . . 
  well this is how it works in real life too . 
  small nations have greater chances of foreign interventions when super powers no so much . 
  case in point , nazi germany before ww2 , usa and the soviets , russia today . . 
  is it me but does n't it look like they took scrapped scenes from the [ interstellar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zswdzvtxt7e ) trailer and added the last 40 sec ? 
  yes a pity for our unlucky brothers in the colonies . 
  lets rise our superior beers to salute them , munch some excellent cheese and lets go watch some titties during prime time . 
   its a crappy system but really there are not any better alternative, 
  except . . you know . . the government state or federal can do it and then rent it to private companies . 
  young and black ? 
  that eagle is getting accidentally shot in 3 2 . 
  alexis tsipra 's photo on a right nutjobs talk show ? 
  this kid really brings us into the spotlight !, 
  whoa !, 
  hmmm ... well i guess it was a case of wrong identification . 
  our bad !, 
  ^ ^ can ^ ^ someone ^ ^ call ^ ^ the ^ ^ morgue ? 
  boy you are so wrong . . 
  the common man believed america would be spared the nuclear fire that had already consumed europe and the middle east because he believed the propaganda fed to him . 
  but the vaults were built by the enclave * precisely * because they knew the war is coming . 
  my question is , did those people presented evidence ? 
  and what ? 
  as far i remember , almost nobody except the city official claimed they were a hoax . 
  they mostly lost their jobs because without gozer there were n't any ghosts around to catch , that started changing when the goo started running for ghost busters 2 . 
  he is focusing on the * traditionalism * part . 
  the problem should be with the daughter then . 
  she lets herself be disrespected . 
  edit : i am sorry i consider the female as someone that can have full responsibility for her actions and social choices . 
  edit : girl is trashy enough to * post * photos of her where her male friend , i quote , `` will porn cum on her chubby tits '' . 
  it is not her fault , it was the boys only and we should bust his face . 
  right . 
  that 's british empire for you , peasant . 
  that 's british empire for you , peasant . 
  also the most essential rule :, 
  be attractive . 
  well at least i have the proper sense not to post your comment in my social media to have fun while you debase me . 
   ** two ** of my friends, 
  i gather she is aware of the photo and the comments , so ... 
   i just hope that it 's not support to russia but rather just a `` fuck you , you did n't ask me '' move . 
  this was precisely the reason . 
  a ) to establish from day 1 that the new government will not blindly follow the eu and b ) there are still other powers except the eu and we can align greece with those if you push us harder . 
  thank you very much . 
  it was driving me crazy that the girl was held unaccountable for her crass actions . 
  first of all , you are falling into a [ balance ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/balance_fallacy ) fallacy . 
  and your chip would be debatable because it * has * an issue , privacy . 
  vaccines on the other hand have no negative issues at all . 
  its not about personal liberty becasue for all intends and purposes they have zero , nada , none effect on your life , health and psychological well being . 
   if the gvt enforced this today , and a body of scientist ( not politicians ) managed the policy , and no other intrusions were allowed - i would n't fight it . 
  you know this is how it works pretty much everywhere else right ? 
  it is an offense to have unprotected sex while aware you have venereal disease smartass . 
  unless you have proper jedi training , the fall to the dark side is * very * common . 
  that is becasue when you dip yourself into the dark side , you are poisoned by it . 
  the force is not a hammer , to use it and throw it away . 
  it effects you , and the dark side would be easier to get a hold of you since the everyday feelings of anxiety , fear , lust are making you more susceptible . 
  my family was posed to lose our home , they wont get any retirement , and their business is failed . 
  i recently moved to n.europe with no foreseeable chances of seeing my family again . 
  if someone gets sick he is pretty much done for because we cant pay for social security anymore . 
  we expected to lose electricity any day now, 
  we have ** zero ** shits to give . 
  that 's why ~ ~ greece ~ ~ the eurozone has to fundamentally reform before spending more would help . 
  til generalization can reach epic levels . 
  greece can say those 300b are not going to be payed , period . 
  and get `` running costs `` from russia that are way less than 300b . 
  not going to happen , just saying . 
  no you got it wrong again . 
  we need fiscal reforms that are planned union wide , not each some `` lazy , bad country '' signaled out . 
  but this means the south implements n. europe 's policies , while north loses money form restructuring and a ecb providing very cheap loans for th foreseeable future . 
  you know like sovereign nations do with problematic regions . 
  but no lets punish some europeans some more . 
  you can buy them on the airport but it is costlier ( +3 per ticket ) and slower . 
  if you get them online you just hop on the bus and you are on your merry way.also if you buy them as early as possible you get a discount . 
  [ would you like to know more ? 
  ] ( http://www.brussels-city-shuttle.com/en/tickets ), 
  what . 
  when the truck runs over his ... ehh . . private parts you hear him scream . 
  so he can feel pain if his death is not instant . 
  way way better ... 
  you are in the wrong subreddit mate . 
  it is actually a huge issue in wwz ( the book ) . 
  when people from the us learn that north areas are relatively safe because of the cold , they rush of in droves towards canada ... with minimal supplies , expecting a pic nic . 
  i can feel the christian love pouring all over me . 
  on another note , can you imagine what would happen if the religions where reversed ? 
  a muslim doing that on a christian gathering ? 
  no sarcasm . 
  just change the religion . 
  everyone has its rude dumb aggressive fundamentals . 
  bleh ... allegory of the cave with some incest mixed in to generate controversy . 
  the brown bunny of the greek cinema . 
  yugoslavia encompasses croatia but serbia is a different region . 
  heisenberg is walt ? 
  russia single handily dominating china and the tea trade ? 
  ww1 would start early from the pissed british . 
  what i want is a paradox game were big countries can fight a lot of proxy wars but actually conquering things themselves would risk a greater engagement with everyone . 
  while having a lot of peace time content to rectify the slower expansion . 
  it is not a joke anymore . 
  i used to love consoles for their couch play and ease of use , in addition with my pc ( because both can coexist ) , but now they have become castrated pcs that are keeping the industry back with shitty ports , copy paste `` aaa '' titles and exclusives . 
  the market is heading towards a crash and console mentality is spearheading that rush .
