  pray sir jorah never have to lay his manly , blue as sky eyes upon you , because his chiseled jawline would be the last thing you will ever see . 
  ean redirection 301, 
  we are trying . 
  expect a major resurgence soon . . 
  he will be back !, 
  man . . talk about false advertising in all levels . 
   except armenians . 
  [ please ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) read your history . 
  while it is my favorite poem too , you should take it with a grain of salt . 
  there are indications that kipling was sarcastic towards the '' british stiff upper lip '' of the time . 
  i usually dislike alternate drawings of original characters because they seem interesting , while in reality they do n't add anything . 
  take a knight , make his helmet like vader 's and you have medieval vader . 
  this however , from the quality of the painting itself , the carefully placed subtle similarities with the source material that actually look realistic and according to my personal opinion , the improvement of the original ( viking vader looks like dread incarnated ) make this fantastic !, 
  personal wealth ( in this example , phones ) is accumulation of resources . 
  accumulation of resources is already a factor in in choosing a valid mate for a lot of animals . 
   humanity has much greater control over our environment, 
  we go a bit philosophical here , but is n't that control based on cognitive abilities of the brain that are influenced by natural selection ? 
  meaning that our `` civilization '' is just one of the expression of the `` natural `` world , like the social structures of ants and termites or tool using by primates ? 
  i just hope grrm does n't have his way with sir jorah , because this sub will be dead , figuratively and literally ... 
  i know , i saw it afterwards . 
  the only option was to take it down and re-post it , so either way my place in hell was assured . . 
  i assure you it was n't my intention to lower its impact . 
   there 's no way grrm is going to kill him, 
  that sounds like an oxymoron to be honest . 
  while the olympics in athens in 2004 was a huge corruption party between greek politicians and mostly foreign firms , in those photos you do n't see the still pristine football and track stadiums , the greatly renovated public transport ( one of the best in europe according to my opinion ) etc etc. 
  not all spending went to that beach volley stadium that keeps appearing on those type of articles . 
  this is like taking a homeless and find him a job in a mlm scheme . 
  it is not from warhead it is a genetic , see other comments . 
  also , if you are not in the us kinda sucks . 
  constantinople was left effectively deserted after the ottoman conquest . 
  but they had it up and running pretty fast afterwards . 
  just saying . . 
  apparently us agnostics are like bisexuals . 
  there is no middle way and we lie to ourselves . 
  i * believe * in * you * . 
  and i am not just a potato . 
  hey you can be sarcastic , but this internet stranger really meant it . 
  what ? 
  yeah ... yet even then roughly 30000 civilians were slaughtered . 
  first time in two thousand years ? 
  get a hold of yourself . 
  from the top of my head , modern atheism has some of its origins from the revolutionary france . 
  that is 200 years . 
  you do n't even know the history of that you are `` fighting for '' . 
  the re population of constantinople came * afterwards * by turks , greeks etc so it could be the new capital . 
  `` before vaccines we didnt have gays '', 
  yeah about [ that ] ( http://www.revelandriot.com/images/gay_greek_art.jpg ) ... 
  nsfw, 
  since you whole comment hinges around the presumption that this is the first time we experience these thoughts ( when in reality we can trace atheism back thousands of years ) yes your argument is dismantled . 
  also your `` internet activism '' has nothing to do with the spread of atheism , it is based around the eventual maturity or our societies . 
  you are not the cause , you are the result . 
  and you are simply obnoxious . 
  i never said i was an atheist , i am probably an agnostic since my answer is `` i do n't know '' . 
  because being `` anti-religion '' ( what you truly are ) is not the same as `` is there a god like intelligence ? 
  * this * is the first time we can voice ? 
  i am sorry but it seems i have imagined the almost 100 years of [ secular communist states ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazw5zb35ok ) . 
  or that the persecution and the ostracism of atheism has stopped in the western world for at least 300 years . 
  you have you opinion * precisely * because those ideas are not forbidden . 
  or do you imagine you discovered a hidden cache of knowledge ? 
  i can get out of the street now and scream `` i do n't believe in god ! '', 
  and that will cause me zero problems in my social life or my career . 
  i am definitely not going to feel repressed , [ apparently like you do ] ( http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/rockbeyondbelief/files/2012/09/help-help-im-being-repressed-motivational.jpg ) . 
  i prefer to use my credit card number , 5168-3200 - **** - **** and for the security question i simply give my three digit cvv *** . 
  so even if someone steals my password i will simply cancel my card through my bank and they will be unable to access anything . 
  edit : whoa , apparently reddit recognizes cc numbers and puts asterisks to hide them !, 
  awesome !, 
  maybe the hosts will tastelessly ( as usual ) joke about it and he mishears . 
  even worse . 
  i dint not said atheism is a cult . 
  you have confused the commenters . 
  i really do n't understand how are you mixing religion with science . 
  according to you , religion has failed to contribute anything good , yet atheism has gained traction only the last 10 years through the internet . 
  sooo what about the technological and social advancements of the last 2000 under the yoke of the abrahamic religions ? 
  what about the thousands of christians , muslims , pagans , buddhists ( there are other religions you know ) scientists and philosophers ? 
  either religions are detrimental to humanity , and our society should have stuck in the dark ages until 1990 , or personal belief does not effect science . 
  pick your poison . 
  about your `` contributions '' , if they are asked by the receivers you are more than welcomed to spread your opinions until your throat is sore . 
  if you try to `` educate '' people without their request , you can as much as go door to door to speak about your enlightenment with `` god delusion '' in your hands . 
  hint : do n't connect with the character of walter . 
  watch it , and try to be as impartial as possible . 
  mortal kombat featured in a mainstream talk show without a child psychiatrist and a `` concerned mother '' as guests ? 
  ... ahh the 90 's look so far back now . 
  you were n't a kid in the 90s right ? 
  congratulations , you are now a honorable mod in / r/lewronggeneration . 
  who has n't ? 
  i invoke rule 34 . 
  i have sources if you are interested . 
  it can be put as community building . 
  considering the thread and the whole context i think [ it is genuine ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2v75jt/move_bitch_get_out_the_way/coffi0z?context=3 ) . 
  ahh throwing glorious patriotic ~ ~ potatoes ~ ~ grenades to enemies of the motherland . 
  so the germans used potatoes mashers while the russians used potatoes . 
  but the russians won ... 
  in soviet russia , potato mashes you ? 
  i do n't think he was joking , i think he wanted to point out that we used to be very cruel on each other , but now we have went all the other way . 
   i do n't know enough about nationalism in ancient greece , except to tell you that they did not call themselves `` greek '', 
   matter of fact , most people just called themselves from whichever region they were from , people did not identify solely or regularly based on language spoken , since every mountain range , and valley had a different dialect, 
  you are incorrect on both this statements . 
  ancient greeks '' ... understood themselves to belong to a common greek genos '' but '' ... their first loyalty was to their city and they saw nothing incongruous about warring , often brutally , with other [ greek city-states . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeks#classical ) '', 
  the athenian involvement in the greek cities of asia minor against the persians and in sicily during the peloponnesian war was based around that fact .
