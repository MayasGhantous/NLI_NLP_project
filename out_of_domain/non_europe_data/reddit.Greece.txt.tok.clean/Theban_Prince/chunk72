  alexander the great used the persian invasions as a pretext for his own , and there are suspicions that the burning of persepolis was for revenge for the destruction of acropolis . 
  as for the dialects , they where regional differences of the same language , and it was a great indication that someone was considered greek . 
  the word `` barbarian '' comes from the greek word '' \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 '' which is him who does not speak greek , and was used mostly to distinguish other cultures ( usually derogatory ) . 
  modern nationalism is traced back to the 18th and 19th centuries , however you cant say there was no self identification of people before then . 
  i love your quotes around `` greeks '' about alexander the great . 
  i find it very interesting that for the macedonians there is a focus on purpose about their perceived differences from other greeks contrary to the spartans , ionians , magna graecia , pontic , marsseille ... why macedonias where more distinct that those groups ? 
  i am more concerned about her stance . 
  and that she is giving birth outside in the mud ... 
  explains why he looks like a girl . 
  so they were literally under their noses and they could see them . 
   i said that greek self-identification began in the late 18th century onward . 
  i have so many sources i do n't know where to start to prove how this statement is wrong . 
  there are numerous times the word hellenes/achaeans being used as names for the same group of people , starting from [ homer ] ( achaeans ) . 
  if you have read the iliad , achaeans specifically refers to people from all around mainland greece . 
  alexander the great famously sent 300 persian armours to the * parthenon of athens * as an oblation to athena , with this epigram : `` alexander , son of philipp , ** and the greeks ** , except of lacedaemonians , from the barbarians who live in asia '' . 
  since the word `` greek '' was never not used by the greeks then and now , but '' hellenes '' ( ' \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) the same word since antiquity i am at a loss on what you are trying to say . 
  i am not a nationalist , and falling back at [ discrediting tactics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discrediting_tactic ) is high school debate material . 
  you state opinions yet you have not provided contradicting sources to my excerpts . 
  last time i checked , this is the true way of scientists everywhere , not only in an internet forum . 
   tear my empire apart . 
  yup , can confirm , king is an imbecile . 
  as a suggestion , you could try an impossible ironman run with the mod long war installed . 
  it is barely a step from being an official expansion from all the content it adds and it does n't effect the difficulty that much . 
  i think peace in m&b is more akin to a `` truce '' so it is not that weird . 
  where greek it is actually `` hellenes '' the same word used nowadays . 
  like hungarians call themselves magyars . 
   but apparently , some companies just do n't want my money o_0, 
  this what i scream sometimes when i get blocked due to region locks ( example is bbc , hulu etc ) . 
  i am forced to either a ) pirate or b ) pay a vpn instead of legit company . 
  region locks made sense 20 years ago with dvds guys . 
  you can share [ games between family now in steam ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing ) . 
  the adaptation op is suggesting . 
  well from a business point of view yes they did , because they could find local companies to pay for distribution , import taxes , promotion , sometimes produce the discs etc etc. 
  i got nauseous just imaging it . 
  greek who recently moved to belgium . 
  i am not very informed about the local politics , but that sounds exactly like the corrupted parties that brought down my country . 
  chilling . 
   it 's not like we 'd have ronald reagan staying in office for another year or so while we 're in a state of emergency . 
  so they are okay if a president proclaims himself dictator , as long as he is on their side . 
  just to make clear that they do n't care about democracy at all , but their bigoted viewpoint ( to protect them against the others !, 
  yes , lets piss off the guy who spent months in the unforgiving wasteland packed with rad-scorpions , raiders and mobsters , who just returned after destroying a mutant army and nuked the big bad to oblivion and he is armed with a power armor and a minigun . . 
  i am sure that will work out . . 
  i think they are most common where there is a lot of voter indifference . 
  they go for family names because they dont care to learn who else there is and go for political `` brand '' names . 
  a pilot that experiences mechanical failure while flying by the book will not be presecuted . 
  a pilot who purposly deviates from the flight plan , gets dangerously low to the ground , unsuprisingly hits something and then asap abandons the plane leaving the rest to fend for themselves would . 
  so it begins ... 
  thank god nobody except the danish thought like that . 
  finland kicking ussrs arse and greece putting a fight and getting some of the first victories of the war against the axis ( and forestalling barbarossa for months ) contradicts your statement . 
  hey the danish chickened out , its ok , but do n't try to sell it as the best option . 
  tsipras is considered a new world leader ? 
  what have we done ? 
  on a more serious note , the first time i remember him was with a pretty cool ad campaign during the 2006 [ municipality elections for athens . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_local_elections,_2006#municipality_of_athens ) . 
  that is 9 years ago , and he was 31 . 
  did he need to be into the political arenas since he was 8 to be legitimate ? 
  ck1 had a really good premise but with a horrible execution ( the base games were n't even made by paradox , and got abandoned halfway by the dev team ) . 
  we wanted a sequel because we saw the potential but paradox did not believe that it could work out . 
  i find it hilarious that it is now on of the flagship titles . 
  it would be like if eu rome gets a sequel somehow and 5 years later proceeds to rival the europa universalis series . 
  there is a ck2 ofshoot in japan by paradox called [ sengoku ] ( https://www.paradoxplaza.com/sengoku ) , however it is underdeveloped compared to ck2 + dlcs . 
  pretty much . 
  it has a lot of potential and really like the art . 
  the fossa are coming !!!, 
  paradox games has fixed it somewhat ( it was already bad ) . 
  if you kick the enemies army in a single grand battle you are almost guaranteed that you will get a surrender even if you have n't conquered much . 
  the finish stopped their total annexation on the hands of a super power , with very few concessions , so i think we can count it as a victory . 
  crete would last a lot longer if the british did not literally disarmed the civilians , who nevertheless did a lot of damage to the germans ( with stones and sticks ! ) . 
  every italian and german dead was one less participating in afrika and russia . 
  the thing is , greece chose to fight , and kept fighting even when officially capitulated with some of the most organized guerrilla armies of the entire war . 
  the greek and the yugoslav partisans tied a lot of german units on the balkans when they were needed elsewere.the french partisans , hardly a field army , not only created problems through the war , but helped with the invasion of normandy and the liberation of paris . 
  it * might * be prude to surrender , but i am sorry it is not honorable . 
  well it backfired for the troll because we all read / u/kookanoodles nice comment . 
  we would n't have the chance if they had a normal discussion . 
  is that possible ? 
  thousands ? 
  tell that to the millions that died in staligrand in an hopeless siege or tell that to british civilians that did not gave up and stood alone against the nazis . 
  across the world no one gave a damn inch without a fight except denmark , on the other hand appeasement worked so well with the germans . 
  thank god no one thought like the danish because the nazis would have won without a fight . 
  cowards . 
  he deleted his account so no karma or creating a fame . 
  so i see no particular gain for him . 
  that brings back second life memories ... 
  i did . 
  still cowards . 
  he was also one of the dwarves in hobbit .

  i dont remember the movie ( i kinda zoned out ) but this [ guy ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=balin&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jsnhvpfnhyff7abcz4h4ag&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=668 ) . 
  no problem !, 
  ask away !, 
  another greek reporting in !,
