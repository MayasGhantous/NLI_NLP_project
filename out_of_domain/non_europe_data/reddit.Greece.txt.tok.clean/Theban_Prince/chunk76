  well if someone is willing to buy such abstract concepts why not . 
  on moral ground their is an agreement . 
  what about signing a contract becoming someones property ? 
  you know , a slave ? 
  the companies are amoral , as you claim . 
  however , the * law * that governs companies , like everyone else , should be as close to present morals as possible.they do n't always overlap ( slavery , abortions , drugs etc ) but usually the morals change first and the law follows . 
  if unpaid internships are indeed , immoral , ( the original question ) then the law should change to reflect that . 
  and the companies will be forced to comply making contracts moot . 
  - you , ** it ** , tell my how to internet i pay you dollars to open internet ! . 
  - sir , that is a box of pringles shoved in a power outlet . 
  - dont care ** it ** , open internet how do you internet ** it ** , tell me or fired . 
  as a waiter , i just found the proper passive aggressive way to respond . 
  dm rule no2 :,

  i am guilty of the last one so i cant be aggressive , until i was enlightened . 
  in contrast , walter white is a bad guy with an ( apparent ) good personality . 
  someone will always comment like that when silencers are mentioned :,

  but i did n't expect them to be obnoxious . 
  new pokemon confirmed . 
  its getting close to reaching `` natural '' as meaningless marketing speak . 
   golden dawn leading the polls, 
  golden dawn is actually 3rd party in a fragmented parliament . 
  and it actually lost some seats . 
  but i guess i am nitpicking . 
  i dont know if you are aware of the game [ the last of us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_last_of_us ) , but it takes place in a post apocalyptic world , where a fungus , cordyceps , takes over human beings either by inhalation or by bodily fluids ( bites ) and turns them to mindless ghouls that they only exist to attack the `` uninfected '' so they pretty much ignore each other . 
  pretty standard fare right ? 
  well the surprising part is that [ cordyceps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordyceps ) * really * exists , and really takes over the mind and body of its victims ( thankfully , only bugs so far ) . 
  the fungus will actually take over the brain of an ant , turning it to essentially a real life zombie , and actively move itself * to the best area * ( usually major passages ) where it can [ hatch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordyceps#mediaviewer/file:cordyceps.jpg ) and infect as many ants as possible creating more zombie ants . 
  it even choose to latch in the ceiling or under leaves so the spores drop from high above to the unsuspecting ants . 
  so to reinstate , a * fungus * in real life takes over bodies and turns them to what is essentially zombies that their only specific purpose is to spread the infection.so we have real life proof that basic organisms can take over others and `` plan '' their best method of spread , either it is hatching or biting . 
  you are confused . 
  there are not true half-elves like other fiction , for example dnd . 
  children in middle earth born from an elf and a human are extremely rare ( only three pairings have ever happened ) , and they actually have to choose their destiny , either true immorality ( not just longevity ) and stay in middle earth forever or death , and the prize to move on from the world . 
  so there are not half elves at all , but either elves or long living ( but not immortal ) men . 
  eru proclaimed that after beren and luthien . 
  technically , luthien was teh first to make the choice , and she choose to be reborn as a human and die with beren . 
  numerous studies , for example with wine tasting and the infamous pepsi vs cola blind test , has repeatedly shown that preconceptions effect our taste preferences . 
  edit : [ fda ] ( http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/transparency/basics/ucm214868.htm ) about the natural label . 
  yup , who has elements from far left and cooperating with a nationalistic far right party . 
  it is fun . 
   buy some ** natural ** crunch jiffy and compare to to non ** natural **, 
  to help you out , that sentence does n't make any sense at all . 
  * everything * is natural . 
  but what difference does the labeling has to the taste of the product ? 
  to put it another way . 
  company a is making square pies while company b is making round pies . 
  for some reason you prefer company a , but you claim that happens because their pies are square , not for the myriad other possible reasons ( quality of ingredients , better recipe and manufacturing , personal tastes ) . 
  `` natural '' simply has no meaning whatsoever . 
  and do n't confuse it with `` bio '' . 
  and agree with you that would probably taste better . 
  however the `` natural '' label does not give any indication about what exactly is happening , because again , it has no meaning . 
  maybe all those examples you presented are happening in reverse , they could still put the `` natural '' label . 
  it does n't ensure anything at all , in contrast with `` biological '' products that there are laws governing who can place that label ( at least in the eu ) . 
  elven souls never leave middle earth . 
  from your link * '' for the elves , however , ` death ' is not a true death ; the f\u00eba never leaves the world . 
  instead , it flees to the halls of mandos , where it may rest and find release from the weariness of the world . 
  '' * so in middle earth , you can kill an elf or wait until it dies of boredom , then you can take a ship to the west and meet him again . 
   i cant keep going with you this is hands down the dumbest conversation i have had on reddit . 
  well at least we agree to something . 
  the list ranges from tablet mini games to fps shooters , rts strategy and time periods from the american revolution to modern warfare and anything in between . 
  so i do n't think they have pretty strict terms for what `` wargame '' means . 
  even then , hoi3 is n't the only hoi game they ever produced ( since they also have older games ), 
  so [ this ] ( http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/kpq1ukwaysy4.840x0.vdef9kkm.jpg ) game has nothing in common with euiv and [ this ] ( http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/b6lompzfdbco.840x0.vdef9kkm.jpg ) has nothing to do with the hoi series , even if the desciption could apply to either game . 
  but apparently [ this ] ( http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/n2epwkehcgvo.840x0.vdef9kkm.jpg ) , a casual tablet game . 
  is more appropriate to the `` wargame `` category than paradox series . 
  again , even with the stricter of terms , at least one of the hoi games should be there since they are essentially strategic * and * tactical simulators of ww2 warfare . 
  technically , the tablet games are also available to the pc , even if they usually have horrible ui . 
  hoi has quite a extended tactical and unit management core , and the other stuff like diplomacy and trade are just optional and minimal . 
  and even then , all the other games have tactics ( encirclement ) and weather , morale and leadership , technology and terrain effecting each battle . 
  but i guess a tablet game with booster cards is more `` in scope '' . 
  they are essentially the same thing with the old ones and some updates . 
  edit : i thought he was asking about the close combat series . 
  thats louis the sun king , and he built the goddamn [ versailles palace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_versailles#mediaviewer/file:vue_a%c3%a9rienne_du_domaine_de_versailles_par_toucanwings_-_creative_commons_by_sa_3.0_-_073.jpg ) . 
  if the word fabulous did not exist , people would have to invent it for him . 
  actually you would be surprised how much detail there is to the tactical game under the hood.for the quality of the officers , to the terrain weather , tactical positions , ( encirclement , flank , ) speed of units , the list goes on . 
  unfortunately paradox has failed to make combat to be interesting , and to be visible to the player . 
  but the list is n't about wargame simulator like harpoon but just whatever historical game with war they could think . 
  and all paradox titles are that . 
  i have played at least the mobile games . 
  they are not tactical , nor historical . 
  and i am not fanboying , if the list was about true wargame simulators like harpoon i would be ok . 
  but it is not only paradox that pisses me off but the arma series , total war , etc. 
  i am sorry , war is optional in the hoi series ? 
  one is a casual turn based game with little planes and over half are flight simulators with the odd third person shooter in . 
  most comments gave me one picture : paradox have utterly failed to show how extremely detailed their battles are on the tactical level . 
  because they are , but nobody takes notice . 
  hoi has further details like unti positioning , what type of unit to use and where , support units etc. 
  just becasue you have n't digged enough does n't mean it is n't there . 
  but essentially , there are games there with very simple mechanics , bordering to puzzle games you play on the bus . 
  ohhh that made it worse :( especially if we consider viking conquest . 
  apparently the original title from the author was not `` the best 20 wargames of all time '' but it got changed by the editors . . 
  this `` go home whenever you want '' feels too safe . 
  i want them to go to a grand journey though time and space and actually make modern day london feel as `` home '' or `` safe haven '' . 
  trying to keep it simple here . 
  not all have read silmarillion . 
  lets form a line here people . . 
  everyone suspected , nobody had concrete evidence of * how much * . 
  [ nazis are dead ?!, 
  and the resulting wars , famines and plagues eventually led to underpopulation and loss of progress , but hey , someone won eventually .
