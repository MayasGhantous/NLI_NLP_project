  the answer is a definite no . 
  the valar are not going to interfere directly with middle earth again for two reasons :, 
  1 ) when the elves first appeared , the valar came among them , befriending them , teaching them , and eventually offering them to come with them to the west . 
  however , that created arrogance to the elves that eventually led to them to [ kill each other ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_middle-earth_wars_and_battles#the_kinslayings ) and hundreds of years of atrocities and sorrow during the war against the first dark lord , morgoth . 
  so ultimately their direct interference hampered the elves in the long run . 
  after the elven kingdoms have eventually fallen to the darkness , and no hope for light was left , the valar amassed a great army and invaded middle earth to free it from morgoth , and that leads to :, 
  2 ) when the valar army invaded the battles were so great that there was huge destruction , with whole [ continents sinking under the sea . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beleriand#history ) so the valar invading would be a lost cause from the start , because to beat sauron they would have to destroy middle earth themselves making this a pyrrhic victory . 
  but you are forgetting something : the valar * did * intervene with the only option left , they send advisors and emissaries , the wizards like saruman and gandalf to rally the free people of middle earth against sauron , and ultimately they where successful without patronizing them * and * without destroying everything in the process . 
  if they were somehow unsuccessful , middle earth would probably stay lost until eru reshaped the world , with light surviving in the west . 
  edit : i thought something more . 
  if middle earth where completely conquered by sauron , then his victory would also be his doom . 
  since he would probably turn everything into ash like mordor , the good men would be able to eventually escape by dying ( the gift ) and the elves would travel to the west , sauron would be left to rule over some empty wastelands with a bunch of orcs , essentially trapping him there alone forever , lord of nothing . 
  so no reason for the valar to intervene , since evil ultimately defeats itself . 
  sooooooooo ... 
  sociopaths ? 
  you forget that while sauron was not on par with morgoth , each individual valar is , and they are more than one . 
  we talk about essentially gods that fling mountain ranges to each other . 
  they might not obliterate middle earth like they did on the first age , but huge destruction was assured . 
  and then the ever expanding sea of books reaches critical mass and becomes a book golem , with spell like abilities any spell book he touched/absorbed as it multiplied . 
  according to tolkien , evil can not create , only destroy . 
  so while sauron might not want to destroy everything , corruption and decay would set in eventually , since the only administrators would be orcs and evil men . 
  case in point , all the places sauron inhabited like mordor or the dark forest turned to shitholes no creature in its right mind get close to . 
  another example , when saruman also fell to evil he turned everything to ash from the isengard valley to the shire in just a few months . 
  imagine hundreds of years . 
  morgoth just when he hit with his hammer he created holes where fire ( lava ? ), 
  spew forth . 
  it would be like humans fighting over an ant colony , even your slightest move destroys huge portions . 
  what sauron wanted but what would eventually happen is quite different . 
  great example his interfering with numenor : he corrupted the humans to attack the valar , and he expected the valar to destroy the humans , but they instead left eru to short out the mess and he obliterated numeror with sauron on it , and he lost his good looking appearance forever . 
  sauron might wanted to rule , but his evil would eventually end in the destruction of everything . 
  do they only read the title ? 
  both of the people in the video were assholes , bu surprisingly for this particular case not because of their sex or religion .

  the whole second earth has no plot point except at the start and ending minutes . 
  one of the best out there if you ignore the plot change 2/3 in . 
  but at least 28 days was a fresh brit point of view that it feels unique ( and possibly a shout out to war of the worlds ) . 
  sunshine felt like it was shoehorned to a stellar script . 
  english oxford dictionary :, 
  `` a * remote-controlled * pilotless aircraft or missile . '', 
  so you might say it was wrong but not for the reasons you thought . 
   hell , take a person who has never been shooting before to the range and educate them as to why guns in responsible hands are n't any more dangerous than plenty other day to day activities . 
  [ example ] ( http://media.jrn.com/images/478*360/gun_instructor_girl.jpg ) . 
  there are mods where you can capture the lord and his family if he is still in the castle . 
  eh it was n't bad , but from a somewhat hard sci fi movie on a time they were rare , it turned into a horror slasher . 
  you can say it was wrong because a drone ( technically ) means an aircraft . 
  but that robot is indeed remote controlled and pilot-less , so it is a drone . 
   the spy started complaining about his issued laptop . 
  you have to remember that spies are state employees . 
  yeah that seems like a prime candidate for a terror attack . 
   also this has nothing to do with cities : xl . 
  that should be noted as that game was sorta booty . 
  thanks for the clarification .

  i dont think he had a body in dul guldur . 
  i vagualy remember gandalf saying about a shadow that was there and then left . 
  i think he got his body when he went back to mordor and he was ready to present himself to the world . 
  its easy to miss but actually decades passed between the end of the hobbit and the start of lord of rings . 
  this mustache gave me ovaries . 
  i know , but i have the nagging memory that sauron was referred like a * shadow of himself * or something like that while in dol guldur . 
  and when the white council finally attacked he escaped easily t to mordor and took his real mantle ( and body ) now that he was ready . 
   turns out they are more barbaric and violent than any of us !, 
  i do n't think anyone is more or less prone to atrocities . 
  the germans simply applied the available infrastructure and administration to do it with horrific efficiency . 
  you can call it the dark side of the industrial revolution . 
  i am sorry but symbols take the meaning the majority gives to them , not individuals . 
  if they do n't know the connections of the symbols they are ignorant , if they do know and willfully present them they support the message even if there are * additional * reasons . 
  from the same article you presented , '' * . . disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits . 
  the flag is not frequently displayed in japan due to its association with ultranationalism . 
  and that flag was adopted for the first time in ** 1870 ** , so it is not * that * directly tied with ww2 yet there are major issues . 
  you said so yourself : the majority decided `` retarded '' is an offensive term . 
  for the confederate flag , the majority ( not only southerners ) still sees it with racist undertones . 
  yet it still causes a lot of controversy . 
  the nazi and confederate flags were created from groups dedicated to defend/expand racism . 
  there did not exist before or after the conflicts or the groups associated with them , so that 's * even worse * . 
  you are making a circular argument . 
  the majority does not associate bwms with pricks and aggressive drivers . 
  however since they are usually considered upper middle class cars , they are symbols of a certain status . 
  so if you want to appear dirt poor you would n't drive a bmw . 
  see how it works ? 
  if the irs started snooping around you because you had stated that you where dirt poor , would you afterwards buy a bmw ?

  when the plot stops to explain 3 pages of philosophical beliefs by a fictional character , something is going on . . 
  obviously this is a personal opinion .
