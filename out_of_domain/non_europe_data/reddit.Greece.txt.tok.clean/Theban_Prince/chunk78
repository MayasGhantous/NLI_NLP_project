  symbols are open to individual interpretation ?!, 
  so if i stroll down the road dressed like [ this , ] ( http://api.ning.com/files/xwuof6l-qriaeficl8aotoyzhu6emtaowlnulkqbzbbuks7w6s5pacrzanzg8wmmwpjgsrkyiqu*pndgwat5uq__/grand_dragon_kkk.jpg ) or even better waving [ this ] ( https://i2.wp.com/mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/images/islamic_state_of_iraq.jpg ) everyone should ask me before getting pissed because i might celebrate my cultural and historical heritage ? 
  hindus had a very hard time and [ there are specific clauses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#legislation_in_other_european_countries ) in the laws of germany protecting their use of the swastika exactly because the majority thinks that it is a nazi , aka racist symbol . 
  however the nazi swastika and the hindu swastika are not the same . 
  yet the strong meaning of one symbol is so much that its gets spilled over . 
  you are creating fictional arguments to prove your point when symbols exist precisely to present some messages . 
  that 's like their whole purpose through sight . 
  symbols where used before words to present ideas , evolving to letters . 
  if every symbol could be interpreted individually we would n't have written language , warning signs or company brand names . 
  apparently everyone else expect you disagrees , because my use of the word `` retard '' almost got me banned . 
  all you are examples are wrong . 
  you are debating that similar symbols might get confused , but that was not the debate . 
  that is obviously true . 
  however , symbols do have a definite meaning . 
  will you confuse an upturned cross above a black altar for st peters , or the one on the pope 's thrones as a satanist ? 
  no of course not . 
  would you confuse a h in a blue background right next to a hospital for a helipad ? 
  would you confuse an h on a roof as a hospital ? 
  no , of course not . 
  hence symbols work because the majority are aware of their meanings . 
  your example would only work in this discussion work if someone used a similar flag like the confederates and he was accused for racism . 
  what we are `` discussing '' is that the flag was created by a political state that was created and fought for slavery to its bitter end . 
  if the csa where a company , the flag it would be its brand name and trademarked , and nobody else would use it . 
  and that company would be a slave company . 
  that symbol did not exist before , and it disappeared afterwards , except in states that surprise , kept being racist ( jim crow anyone ? 
  ok we are going in circles . 
  lets make it easier to be done with :, 
  people claim that southerners celebrate their legacy with the flag , their history . 
  * which part do you think they celebrate ? 
   if you happen to ** witness ** a nuclear explosion . 
  and that 's the point . 
  if you are in a place where your brain has time to register and recognize a nuclear attack you are outside the `` become radioactive dust '' radius . 
  hence duck and cover might give you marginal chances of survival . 
  even better , use that slab of black glass to get live video from a huge space station [ in orbit . 
  ] ( http://www.ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream ), 
   my sense is that those who fly the flag for reasons other than racism do so to honor an ancestor who fought in the civil war or to piss off yankees . 
   those who do so for more complex reasons of southern pride/heritage may be doing so for a number of reasons - states rights , resisting the federal government , freedom , etc.

  those are assumptions , what part of the us history comes in * your * mind when you see a confederate flag ? 
  i never reload if i fuck up . 
  i only reload ( or use the console ) if the mechanics of the game either constrain me compared to real life or somehow fuck me over . 
  example :, 
  create a great army to take over distant land . 
  by the time you finish your first opponent , his neighbor had his most juicy provinces declare rebellion . 
  because paradox after three years did not had time to completely fix the ai , you can not declare war immediately with raised levies , so you have to haul up your grand army on ships and alllllll the way back home , disband , immediately declare war and 1 hour later recall them . 
  as you load them into the ships , you realize that you had some mercenaries that took out all your gold and now declared war to get your primary title as they massacre your underfunded armies . 
  goddamit is ' t that the one of the major selling point of pcs ? 
  that a peasant can ascent because it is so easy to plug everything and play ? 
  so all this time , with no sources , not even personal claims , we are making assumptions and creating strawmen that somehow , , somewhere , the flag of the ** confederate states of america ** might not have any connection about the war that birthed it , a war that was fought for slavery . 
  right . 
  [ you do n't need to have two equal parts in a debate . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_balance ), 
   do you grant that a symbol can have more than one meaning ? 
  or is it your contention that symbols have exactly one meaning ? 
  both . 
   pastel shoes, 
  helllloo new fetish !, 
  '' op is a total stranger on reddit , he will never find where i live . '', 
  `` here , let me hold your beer '', 
  i will never be 100 % . 
  that is impossible , and as unhealthy for the relationship as insane jealously . 
  `` i wonder if farts really light up '', 
  `` what ? 
  did you said some - '', 
  symbol ** s ** can have variable number of meanings . 
  from one to plenty . 
  please do not reply again . 
  thank you . 
  except it does n't work . 
  clara was always in the time stream since the first doctor . 
  so nothing changed between 9 and 12 ( from clara at least ) . 
  i think that the house is the `` base '' , the pump is `` mining '' something from the drain to `` power '' the antenna . 
  the bottles op found inside could be `` supplies '' . 
  guys , i think we are dealing with an astronaut and his first interplanetary base here . 
  he is about 6-8 years old , and he had to abandon it due to a `` i am late for lunch '' crisis . 
  i am actually also joked about that with my so but about fortune reading . 
  you do n't need to come in contact with other `` practitioners '' that might get pissed for intruding on their turf . 
  as others said , stock up in radx and rad away . 
  do not take actions like sleep or skill that pass time , you will die from radiation . 
  do not pass the chance to get to ** lvl 5 ** , some of the best weapons in the game are stored in lockers and in the wall lockers . 
  you had to go to lvl 6 first to repair the generators , and backtrack to lvl 4 ( if i remember correctly ) to get to the unique elevator that connects to lvl 5 . 
  search dead bodies and lockers on the way down for passcards ( for the elevators ) and supplies ( including radx ) . 
  kill deactivated robots ( preferably with hand to hand to conserve ammo ) whenever you find them , they will get activated when you get the power back up . 
  if you do these , glow is a breeze with great rewards . 
  nothing affected * by clara . 
  the notion that medical procedures are a scientific , delicate process was destroyed for me when i watched a video from a surgery . 
  doctors are not gentle with your meat people !, 
  particularly in routine procedures . 
  obviously nothing wrong with that . 
  there are mods that open up both freeside and vegas proper ( no intermediate doors like the bus one ) and add a lot of npcs in the streets , and another one that packs the casinos with customers . 
  add them and see how new vegas was supposed to look before they rushed the game and had to cut it down . 
  it is * glorious * !, 
   i feel ashamed to say i 'm a pc gamer now . 
  now * you * are going overboard . 
  there is life outside reddit and hundreds of thousands of pc users that have n't heard of it , much more / r/pcmasterrace . 
  those minorities ruin the name of the group mostly * to other minorities * that use the same platforms to communicate . 
  by the way , i am a member of / r/pcmasterrace and i agree with some stuff about the consoles , mostly the business plans that limit customers that demonstrably hurt the industry , but i am not a fanatic that sees red when he hears `` consoles '' . 
  if living room gaming was not a thing the , according to some , `` holy '' valve would not spent money to get into that . 
  but you have to wonder if the vocal minority * of * the minority that is / r/pcmasterrace gets the most attention .
