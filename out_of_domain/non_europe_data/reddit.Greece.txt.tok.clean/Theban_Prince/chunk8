  just to get a comparison , i went to a private clinic here in greece.i had a free year check up offer , which included a blood examination ( iron , white cell etc ) , an upper body x-ray , and an abdomen ultrasound . 
  while i did n't pay i got a receipt of total cost 370 $ . normal?cheap ? 
   however , unless the black hole is really , really huge you 'd hardly have time to say `` captain , we 're been caught in the gravity well of a black hole '' let alone enact some implausible yet daring method of escape . 
  i thought that time ` streched ' as you get closer so you would have all the time of the universe to say that phrase.but you would never finish saying it.ever . 
  thank you very very much for your info.have a great day !, 
  a thought that occurred to me.if we send a probe inside a black hole , would t that probe 's `` image '' stick there for a really really really long time , leaving a `` footprint '' of intelligent life?and since black holes are relatively rare , we can presume that if other civilizations did the same we have better chances of finding * their * `` footprints '' , considering we have less places to look?maybe not with present technology but in theory ? 
  when i saw that movie i thought, 
  `` ok now we aint seeing any fallout movie for a lot of years.they copied everything '', 
  dammit . 
  i was about to send my thesis to nasa and swim in dollars.so long `` space archaeology for dummies '' , the universe laws where cruel to you . 
  and now i am hungry.thanks . 
  unfortunately lore wise its impossible to have a half ghoul , because a ) ghoul ( ism ? ), 
  is something not inherited because its not in the genes and b ) ghouls are sterile . 
  from what i remember the change is almost instant.moira in megaton was like `` what the fuck just happened ? '', 
  if you bombed the place . 
  harold also mentions that his transformation took effect pretty fast . 
  actually it seems that the change takes hours at most.the dwellers of vault 12 ( beneath l.a. ) changed when the bombs fell , because the door did n't close.and again , moira changed almost instantly.so the at least the slowest scenario is i think a couple of weeks , tops.very little time for a npc to get stuck in semi ghoul form, 
  ahh ok than that makes it this mod more awesome . 
   successful if it appeals to the lowest common denominator, 
  if this could get fixed in other forms of media too , we would have a second renaissance ( ren-renaissance ? ), 
  that bouquet does n't look as impressive because it has almost exactly half the flowers in the picture.also prom pictures in florist work like those in fast foods.you aint getting what you see , period, 
  i boarded just today.thank god no emotional investment !, 
  boone is awesome.good job !, 
  while i did n't buy the ticket to the hype train ( barely ) , i do n't think they are idiots.i think most of them saw the signs that the site was fake , but wishfully thinking and a fun team experience kept them going.i seriously think that the ending was the worst part.i mean come on , make fun on some guys that where interested so much , to show what ? 
  and as all troll his `` victory '' is null . 
  takes ~ ~ time ~ ~ kerbals =p, 
  so that is why they used honey to preserve bodies ( like alexander the great ), 
  indifference . 
  the `` essential '' dlcs/expansions ( those with the most drastic changes ) :, 
  * ** crusader kings ii : sword of islam ** ( play as a muslim ), 
  * ** crusader kings ii : legacy of rome ** ( major byzantine/orthodox expansion , adds retinues ), 
  * ** crusader kings ii : the republic ** ( play as a merchant republic , the best dlc according to me ), 
  these are included in the collection . 
  ** missing ** major dlcs are :, 
  * ** crusader kings ii : the old gods ** ( play as various pagans , mostly focused on norse culture ( vikings ! ), 
  * ** crusader kings ii : sons of abraham ** ( christian/muslim/jewish focused expansion , do n't have it ca n't say how it is ), 
  minor dlcs that are quite nice to have :, 
  * ** ruler designer ** ( make your own character and dynasty ), 
  * ** eu4 save game converte ** r ( if you have/plan to buy eu4 , it converts your ck2 game to a game of eu4 ), 
  so , minor dlc you dont really need to have :, 
  * ** sunset invasion ** ( fantasy scenario where the aztecs ( ? ), 
  invade europe , widely critisized dlc , some see it as ahistorical mambo jumbo , the other half thinks that adds some replaybility and funky situation in the game.better leave it for later ), 
  * ** portrait dlcs ** : adds a lot of new culture/race portraits , nice to have some differences betwen characters , but not essential to the game . 
  * ** unit packs/music packs/dynasty coats of arms ** : purely aesthetics , least necessary , but also ridiculously cheap.music packs in my opinion are almost useless , since you will be playing so much that any music will get stale pretty fast . 
  my suggestion is to buy the collection , because it has all the early major dlcs and almost all the minor bundled in a good offer , and then buy the two remaining major dlcs , priority on the ** crusader kings ii : the old gods ** . 
  leave the minor dlcs not in the collection for later , when they will be bundled/ridiculously cheap.hope i helped !, 
  however most of these can be changed by editing a couple of files in the base game anyways ( changing title name and dynasty takes seconds ) , and even then it is not really necessary to enjoy the game at it 's full potential . 
  morale morale morale.thats your chant when you play eu4 battles.morale can kill a huge army in the first battle.finally terrain , technology and leader.if you are seriously lacking in any of these areas your army will get curbstomped . 
  heh true!the only advantage is the barber shop.barely . 
  i 'm greek and i am broke :p, 
  it got hit by about 5 nukes and 200 years of neglect right next to a desert ( sandstorms are not kind to buildings ) . in reality , everything else ( like the capital wasteland ) should be worse , and the new vegas area should be viewed as a pristine piece of the old world . 
  ( it has electricity!and standing skyscraper casinos!and electronic defenses ! ), 
  dude seriously , change that picture , i aint coming within 50m from that thing . 
  not all . 
  because he never got the platinum chip , he missed 5-6 nukes . 
  but somewhat `` gamey '', 
  if you have a hard on with the ere , why do n't you try crusader kings?it has the empire at its best , and tons of fluff like decision and events . 
  because until the late medieval ages , byzantium was one of the biggest and wealthiest nations in europe.however after the 13th century it was a shadow of it 's former self , and should be compared to the western nations , hence the eastern tech group . 
  done :d, 
   last fallout game was f3, 
  wot ? 
  actually the schism was working the other way around.in the early middle ages `` byzantine '' technology surpassed the western kingdoms.however after the empire first lost egypt ( a cultural and technological center ) and then anatolia , it all went downhill . 
  eu4 correctly set the tech as eastern , the same reason the russians have the same.in a way , the technological lag was the last nail in the coffin . 
  [ bombards ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orban ) ( a fairly new techonolgy ) where used to bring down constantinople 's walls . 
  i really do n't understand why some people do n't consider f : nv as a proper flalout ( in fact i could even fathom that idea , until i saw a lot of people expressing that idea in this subreddit ) . it is considered canon ( arguably way closer than f3 ) . just because there is n't a `` 4 '' in the title does n't change its status.you wont find someone claiming that gta : san andreas i n't a proper gta . 
  i have seen this video a few months ago.according to a guy from the neighborhood , he was an insane guy who was also high in drugs.we had done that a couple of times before , but he never climbed so high .

   it is a very real ~ ~ problem ~ ~ scum . 
  i honestly agree.nice movie . . but a best picture award?i mean , i love sci fi , i love space exploration , but come on !,

  it would be even better if he changed the ending date to 2500 a.d. 
  how social sites , memes and fashion work as [ science ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-organization#self-organization_in_human_society ), 
  in crusader kings ii constantinople is way more advanced than some western counties , possibly to demonstrate exactly what you said.but by the 1400s , they had lost almost all trade routes with the east , due to the turks , and the only open route to the city in the final decades was through the sea , until [ rumelihisar\u0131 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rumelihisar%c4%b1 ) was built , effectively cutting the city entirely.the knowledge of the greek fire was lost , along with a lot of ancient manuscripts from constantinople and alexandria , which were conquered by the franks ( sic ) and the arabs respectively and were the first seeds for both the western rennaissance and the [ islamic golden age ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_golden_age ) . 
  by 1453 , the ere was lagging behind in technology , riches and population and i think it is properly on the eastern tech group . 
  ** if ** they have survived , and somehow pushed the turks away , they would probably need to reorganize the whole empire again , so the westernization option is proper . 
  way way better than the sunset invasion.if you have to go bollocks , just go over the top . 
  and maybe change the graphics/map to children made . 
  that phrase is so stale and cliche i lost some grey cells because they felt asleep . 
  lol wut.thats the only answer i can give .
