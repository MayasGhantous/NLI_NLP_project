  you know that is not true , or you would get all fired up . 
  if it has n't any effect , you would n't mind taking it off the game would you ? 
  umm i think it is completely fabricated . 
  while at the start they had rivalries , mostly because they belonged to different music schools , later they seem to be good friends . 
  [ wikipedia link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_salieri#interaction_with_mozart ) . 
  i reclaimed spain from al-andalus and distributed the land between three kingdoms , portugal , leon and aragon . 
  i kept gibraltar to guard against the muslims and gave it to vassalised templars . 
  20 years later this clusterfuck happens :, 
  i put a claimant to the throne of leon . 
  i did not notice he is english . 
  this causes revolution for another claimant , castillian this time . 
  trying to keep this somewhat historical , i join the war with the revolters , against the usurper ** i ** helped put on the throne just 2 years before . 
  portugal joins the fray against leon to get some de jure baronies . 
  insignificant one-county-muslim leftovers attack leon too because why not . 
  aragon declares against the muslim leftovers . 
  it calls me into the war , that i decline because i am team faramir . 
  leon completely ignores the raging armies of portugal and the leonese revolt , and attacks the single muslim county . 
  it outnumbers them 2vs1 . 
  it gets royally thrashed and only 2000 escape . 
  the templars , * my * vassals , declare de jure war against * my * allies , the leonese revolt . 
  both seem chill with me for some reason . 
  in the midst of this chaos , 584 muslim religious revolters are randomly strolling here and there . 
  [ how i felt going in . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/f2giirkpy6g?t=2m31s ), 
   oh , and the other problem is that afk cloaking is practically the only way to have a chance at catching the bulk of ratters . 
  100 % safe ratting is n't good for the game , as i 'm sure you can agree . 
  oh so suddenly it is a legit tactic to get kills , that involves not being on your computer ... interesting . 
  also , about `` safe ratting '' , if a mechanic is broken , you fix it , not use another broken mechanic . 
  the logic is that you fix both independently . 
  and you get kills by tactically staying in an invulnerable advantageous position indefinitely . 
  its the pvp twin of the high sec carebear war `` tactic '' : get in station , watch some porn until attackers are bored . 
  the new structures will probably have an effect in local , so everyone gets its piece . 
  `` what would you do if you won the lottery ? '', 
  `` lottery is not available in my area of residence '', 
  hip mod , the absolute best . 
  i ca n't play ck2 without it , even if it slows my ancient pc to a crawl because it has a map with hundreds upon hundreds of extremely detailed new provinces . 
  what type of events are you looking for ? 
  a lot of previously random personal events are now tied into the way of life system . 
  do you have the dlc ? 
   that 's sophia loren . 
  that 's sophia loren , for whom the whole event was arranged by her agent to introduce her to the american rich & famous to boost her career , and mansfield crashed wearing * that * . 
  no wonder she was pissed . 
  seduce her parents , and plan it in way for her to walk in as you and her mother are plugging her father in a s&m scat threesome . 
  that will fuck her up * real * good . 
  early access games are legit . 
  shitty products always exist to grab your money , case in point so many `` completed '' aaa games with major features missing ( gta v ) , bugs and glitches ( ubisoft ) or blatant lies ( ea ) for twice or thrice the price . 
  no he is english . . why ? 
  well he did reunite brittania ... but in the opposite way since he came from a norman family . 
  in greek , its `` duckling '' . 
  i am not talking about the reign of terror , i am talking about the lynch mobs by commoners immediately after the revolution . 
  and i said it was understandable from their viewpoint . 
  a massive majority of events are now tied to the way of life dlc . 
  some will not happen * at all * unless you have chosen the specific focus . 
  you provided my point . 
  shitty companies with empty promises exist both in early access and aaa versions , as do great ones . 
  use your wallet smart and you rarely get disappointed . 
  saying `` early access is shit so i do n't buy anything '' is generalizing and in my opinion , whining . 
  early access is anathema in most gaming subreddits because a lot of people got shafted , and instead of getting pissed with the scummers , they also blame the distribution type . 
  a distribution that brought us kerbal , zomboid , prison architect , space engineers ... jewels we would probably never have if early access did not exist . 
  but you can bet polished turds would , early access or not . 
  if you got my previous message with the bad word i am so sorry . 
  some things you can use to make them better . 
  i dont think you can make them completely original by this point :, 
  1 ) do n't provide a scientific explanation , or even better do n't ` provide anything at all . 
  the original romero zombies did not , and while it was refreshing at first , providing a source for them is now overdone . 
  keep the fear of the unknown . 
  2 ) make them invulnerable and unstoppable . 
  nothing can kill them ( not even headshots ) , their hardened bodies can sustain damage , cold and fire for a long time , they get more strength and when they smell you , they do n't stop until they get you , even hours , days or weeks afterwards . 
  think an undead t-1000 from terminator 2 that also multiplies . 
  3 ) make them `` smart '' hunters . 
  maybe some can vocalize basic human words like `` help '' or calling out names trying to lure victims on them . 
  or maybe some keep a perfect skin while rotting from the inside so from afar they look alive . 
  this in not only creepy , but also will make survivors suspicious with everyone . 
  4 ) have only children become zombies with everyone else simply dies and gets devoured/left to rot . 
  their heightened strength compensates for their size , and they can crawl to really tight spaces . 
  also their first priority is to kill , not eat . 
  dumping your friend as bait to save your skin will not save you , only they will tear him to pieces and ignore him afterwards for going after ** you ** , a fresh kill . 
  5 ) as the humans in a concentrated area increases , the zombies gather exponentially . 
  humans need to stay on the run and small groups all the time , because large groups can cause a frenzy with hordes of thousands descending on them from hundreds of miles . 
  this will explain why the military failed , because every time they tried to regroup / establish bases , they got overwhelmed in a few hours by hundreds of thousands of zombies . 
  5 ) your humans are aware of the zombie genre and act accordingly , as much as that helps . 
  use the word `` zombies '' not `` walkers '' `` them '' or whatever . 
  it was nice at first , but totally unrealistic . 
  its scarier to know that they are people like us , with thought they can handle it from all the movies and games , yet they still failed . 
  humanity is over and done for . 
  not pristine malls , barricaded houses and stuff like this . 
  either you keep moving and live in holes in the countryside like a rat or you die , and applying 5 ) and 4 ) whoever tried that at first thinking they where smart turned into zombie food really fast . 
  just some of my ideas , if you will i can probably think some more . 
  is n't defacing the signs illegal ? 
  on on hand , i absolutely love my car , that i saved money for it while slaving on a menial job . 
  on the other hand , my father narrowly escaped death in a crash that left him a grotesque scar in his belly , and 5 year later my sister escaped death also . 
  both crashes from human mistakes ... 
  such a tough choice . 
  the thing is , what happens if you kill someone else and you survive ? 
  my sister was extremely lucky not too kill someone , driver or pedestrian . 
  yet she did n't had a scratch . 
  to add to my previous comment , i know a case close to me where a mother turned her attention just a bit while commuting to work . 
  she lost control , and her child in the back seat got killed . 
  she is half crazy since then . 
  i think better phrasing would be `` blue water '' aka deep ocean .
