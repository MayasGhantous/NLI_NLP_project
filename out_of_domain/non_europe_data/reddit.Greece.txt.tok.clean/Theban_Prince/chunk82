  what is the * realistic * , thought provoking part of 2001 ? 
  oh wait it must be the question if an ai has a right to defend himself because it is `` afraid '' or `` confused '' ? 
  its hilarious when famed writers of sci fi like orson scott card , kim stanley robinson , and dan simmons use love , strawman environmentalism or other basic concepts as plot points and we think it is great , but noooo hollywood for some of the rare times it dwells in this kind of stuff must be better than them . 
  rose tinted glasses maybe ? 
  you can only play battles your king/leader is present without fast swaping between armies . 
  you can keep the present mode as the `` autoresolve '' function . 
  realistic and you do n't clog the game play that much . 
   rts battlefield worth playing, 
  i think you can use the main map data to generate random landscapes depending the province type . 
  you can use the unit models already present to create the armies ( low poly , but i think we can be okay with that ) . 
  but the ai would be a total bitch . 
   i 'm about to get into victoria 2 and hearts of iron 3, 
  i think you should wait for hoi 4 or get the darkest hour hoi2 spin off . 
  hoi 3 looks like the imbecile dwarf cousin of the paradox dynasty right now . 
  it is not golden dawn infiltrating the security forces , it is the other way around , the voters are abandoning the traditional parties to vote and get close with gd, 
  it broke . 
  citizens from the security forces are understandable to be more sympathetic with far right movements ( for the motherland and all that ) so they are a big part of the 6.8 % . 
  i do n't think it is that different from , example , the communist party having connections with factory workers that will join/affiliate with the party and organize ( and possibly look out for their comrades ) . 
  greece is lacking a ` proper '' right wing party right now so the only option is gd for those inclined . 
  the pheasant was running to enlist for a job in skyrim . 
  i would prefer them to make take an evolution concept , like when in eu4 you can release nations and the continue playing with them , but more fluid . 
  for example , i hate that now if you lose all your titles in ck2 its instant game over . 
  i would love to lose all your titles as king of england and then start from zero controlling a long forgotten bastard in spain . 
  so they can make great loss more frequent ( less blobing ) but also somewhat more forgiving from a gameplay point . 
  yeah because adding any religious figure in playable terms would be ok . 
  jesus or the apostles to do what you like ? 
  totally no controversial . 
   and there are even those who think fallout 2 not `` true fallout '' compared to fallout . 
  reporting in . 
  fallout 2 took one of the first nuclear post-apocalyptic games with an awesome mad max/art deco style and some 50 's shout outs and turned it into flash gordon . 
  this became progressively worse until we reached the self parody levels of fo3 . 
  i curse you chris avelone !, 
  thank god he finally came back with fonv . 
  yeah , can you imahine playing the guy that decides if he get crucified or not . 
  as you say it is doable ( treat it like the reformation in eu4 ) . 
  however mohamad was a secular leader for many years , you cant work around that . 
  if jesus was the same christians would be pissed too , it is not only islam . 
   or they could just see humans as so far beneath them . 
  people do n't copulate with chimpanzees for example . 
  you must learn a bit more about the greek gods . . 
  blasting wardruna while pillaging and raping anglo-saxons and watching/listening [ palastinalied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r8visgltvm ) everytime i click to join the crusades are a must for every campaign . 
  or a phalocratic asshole , militant atheist , religious fundamentalist , sport team hardcore fan , console vs console vs pc fan child ... actually any personal opinion applied to a hive mind and pushed to the 11 that allows dregs of the society take opposing battle stations and feel better for themselves . 
  well considering single clicks open some things while double clicking opens everything no matter what , i think it is a win !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ am ^ ^ so ^ ^ tired ... 
  well if the pentagon and the terrorist teams are staffed with 50 y. olds with basic computer ltieracy ... well yeah . 
  so not only double clicking assures you open what you want , but it does it twice !, 
  in my book 2 windows  0 windows . 
   christians today fully subscribe to pauline doctrine of salvation through christ as some kind of pill to be taken , often to the exclusion of jesus ' true message . 
  thus , we get the likes of the kkk , homophobic pizzerias and war-mongering politicians invoking the name of jesus to explain actions and ideology that are antithetical to jesus . 
  what annoys me is this americanocentric view . 
  `` christians '' are close to 2.4 ** billion ** with various denominations and sects . 
  not everyone is a fundamentalist baptist from the bible belt . 
  a lot of christians ( if not most of them ) believe that your actions in life will be taken into account , and just paying lip service is damnable . 
  you are not a expert , but i strongly suggest to look for a marketing career . 
   we could just fix earth . 
  yeah , try completely new , untested and never totally predictable science on the only planet we can survive . 
  did i mention that even a few degrees of temperature difference can wipe out thousands upon thousands of species ? 
  what could it * possibly * go wrong ? 
  yeah lets make it faster !, 
  maybe we shouldd wipe out life all the way to single cell organisms !, 
  right now we are worried first about saving our level of civilization ( wich famines and diseases caused by global warming ) , then about the extinction of the human species ( unlikely , but what does it matter if we live back in caves ) and then about the extintions of species . 
  a botched terrarforming project can exterminate everything ( hint : it includes meteors , giant mirrors in space and factories pumping possibly lethal gasses into the atmosphere by the ** b ** illion tons ) . 
  why not do first a test run in an already dead planet ? 
  the forest was megatons worse so kill the moon has that going for me ... 
  it creates a difficult situation where you have to correct they mistake an embarrassment , or do n't and have to endure someone butchering your name all night . 
  and then a newly arrived mutual acquittance arrives and corrects him , making both embarrassed . 
  remember the mantra :, 
  `` if it does n't contradict canon , it is as true as you want '', 
  star wars is as much revan as darth vader for me . 
   you do n't blame swiss banks for tax evasion do you ? 
  yes we do . 
  fuck this . 
  i participated in a completely new party full of young people with hopes for the best ... until our glorious leader decided to sell his parliament seats * before * he even got elected . 
  the party by the way was [ dimiourgia ksana ] ( http://www.dimiourgiaxana.gr/el/ ) . 
  now i am in belgium and loving it !, 
  never going to happen . 
  that like , totally unsurprising for a far right party anywhere . 
  genocides where legal . 
  slavery was legal . 
  prohibition was legal . 
  marrying 12 y.o. 
  girls was legal.killing your help-hands was legal . 
  the banks where made by people and supported by people . 
  if i go to a swiss bank right now i can tell you exactly who is working where and who makes the decisions . 
  it wont be a computer , `` a machine '' . 
  there are planets where the majority of the planet is a death trap , but bands in the atmosphere/surface are juuust in the sweetspot for comfortable human colonization . 
  they exist in venus and jupiter . 
  i have no idea how the eu4 handles the random provinces ids but best case scenario you get the normal americas with borders all over the place , worst case scenario the game crashes / the americas are completely empty . 
  unless the converter can export the whole map ( i strongly suspect it does n't ) and vic2 can handle it ( i also suspect it does not ) you cant play vic2 in a random world . 
  paging mr / u/idhrendur . 
  i am only pointing out that legal is not equal to moral with various examples . 
  so on one hand you want banks to not disclose account info for citizens , and one the other hand you accuse the greek government of not being able to tackle tax evasion . 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  are you american ? 
  / r/spiders is leaking . . 
  my brother the [ cathar-ma ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%ce%ba%ce%ac%ce%b8%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%bc%ce%b1 ) . 
  ahh yes you are right . 
  what are you doing in here then ? 
  i do n't know about specific countries , but generally in europe you are required to apply to public owned job agencies and you are strongly suggested to do that also in private owned ones if you are not a citizen of the country . 
   elevated risk of cancer is likely , but it 's certainly not a toxic , lifeless wasteland like what scifi is so fond of portraying .
