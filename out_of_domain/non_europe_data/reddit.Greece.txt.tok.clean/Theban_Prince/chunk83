  you are forgeting the ( possible ) [ global environmental change ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_winter ) . 
  the wasteland will come from that , not from the explosions themselves . 
  this could easily be added with dynasty relations on top of character relations . 
  you gave a lot of land to a family jump starting them from lowly courtier to powerful duke or massacred half their children ? 
  those should be remembered . 
  always the same arguments . 
   what about combat like in mount and blade ** with good ai and mechanics ** ? 
  when you dream , do n't make compromises . 
  this is me dreaming :, 
  ** 1 . tactical battles : **, 
  allowed only where you character is present ( you ca n't teleport generals ) , you establish a plan before battle , and have limited options for orders after the battle starts based on technology and personal skill . 
  [ like this example ] ( https://youtu.be/gzazbbkp9a4?t=2m6s ) . 
  you can keep the present engine as the `` auto resolve '' option . 
  ** 2 . dynasty relations : **, 
  long term relations and diplomacy between dynasties on top of character opinions that change depending of the severity of your actions and time . 
  more roleplaying and more depth in the npc interactions . 
  ** 3 . massive increase of provinces : **, 
  i am playing the hip mod with the revamped map and each region ( for example , britannia ) feels like a whole mini campaign , particularity at early to mid game.makes unrealistic blobbing more difficult . 
  ** 4 . hidden attributes and opinions for npcs : **, 
  this could change based of skills and advisers and you can have a basic idea from the start `` character is friendly/indifferent/hates you '' . 
  depending on events and actions this would become more clear . 
  no more game over if you lose your titles . 
  this game is about characters , not nations , so losing all your lands while your beloved brother is emperor of the hre is dumb . 
  this will open up possibilities for mercenaries , holy orders and priest dlcs . 
  this is an engine limitation , so it could even stay unimplemented in the base game , but left open for moders . 
  ** 6 . expanded diplomacy : **, 
  cooperate with your allies to achieve goals . 
  suggest targets to conquer . 
  plan simultaneous attacks . 
  pledge your support towards their goals so the ai can fire a casus belly or a faction calculating your armies on his decision . 
  ** 7 . character specific , long event chains : **, 
  rare , extremely long event chains that can create narratives based around your character that makes each of your king memorable . 
  way of life set the base with the charterer focus , but you can make event chains that can fire with long lasting effects . 
  maybe if you succeed to reach the end you can get hereditary character traits or other major perks . 
  add a `` enforce religion '' casus belli to unreformed pagans . 
  stop those pesky raids without sacrifing 10 court bishops or conquer all of scandinavia . 
  no more `` ca n't declare war because of raised levies '' . 
  go to crusade to jerusalem , beat the ummayads to pulp , and then you notice a muslim opm right next to jerusalem . 
  what happens now , is that you haul all your grand armies back to england , disperse them , declare war , recall all you armies and rehaul them back to the other side of the world . 
  ** 9 . mustering area . 
  ability to set a specific province where your vassal armies will deploy when called to war without appearing in the map . 
  time they become available depending on their opinions , distance , province tech etc. 
  this will not only help with micro management , but also the ai since now you can play whack a mole and defeat larger enemies as he gathers its forces . 
  i think there are a lot of ways to discern if a microbe is earthborn or not . 
  the chances of something being the same between a earth microbe and a mars one is so far and few that any , even minscule , similarities will point directly to panspermia particularly in its genetic material where we can trace its evolution . 
  i have heard these claims before , can you please present some examples please ? 
  truly interested . 
  thank you for your great response . 
  i hoped you had sources , so i can read a bit myself . 
  so , you have a button that if pressed will make these things never happen , but on the other hand also keep medicine back for at least a decade for many ailments . 
  a lot of them lethal . 
  what would you do ? 
  i had the same thoughts with you and / u/silverbreez , and i think that its pretty normal to have a subconscious aversion to spiders . 
  they tend to hit a lot of primal fears with their looks ( uncanny valley , venom , disease ) so it is understandable . 
  but i also think that you can get acquainted to them eventually . 
   the real god would fit in 100 % with the comprehension of a super-intelligent being and it 's understanding of science . 
  what if the universe itself is an `` intelligent '' mechanism ? 
  we would n't be able to comprehend either its purpose or our role in it . 
   you 're putting the concept on a pedestal that it does n't deserve . 
  you are actually confusing human religion with the question if the universe serves a purpose . 
  the question `` is there a god '' does n't mean a christian/islam/hindu god in this context . 
  and then you realize there are 2 ** b ** illion christians in the world . 
   tl ; dr : the stories in holy books do n't need to be true for you to understand their meaning . 
  and whether or not a god put it there , our morality is innate to us as a species . 
  morals and ethics are a construct and they constantly change . 
  what it was considered moral a century ago today is not . 
  and the `` golden rule '' does n't apply to every religion in history . 
  there are a * lot * of religions that actually enforced the harm of other human beings in different parts of the planet , usually through sacrifices , cannibalism etc. 
   i sincerely have n't been able to understand why we must follow the bible without involving mystical stories about the life of jesus and making your faith grow . 
  i am sure that you are pissed with the old testament part , rather with the new testament . 
  would you like to join my present religion ( population :1 ) who holds true only the new testament and that the old testament is bollocks ? 
  yet i am sure it worked . 
  congratulations , your son is [ mr magoo !,

  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry ... 
   first of all , the universe obviously does not serve a purpose of any kind . 
  um how do you know that ? 
  just because our small , miniscule , tiny part of reality seems random does n't exclude it . 
  the galaxies could be logic i/o gates for a universal computer that calculates information from multiple universes . 
  you would n't be able to see the pattern right now . 
  does physics researchers and mathematicians discovered everything there is to discover and i did n't hear ? 
  for me , you seem to actually trying to bring the matter down a size . 
  let me ask you a question . 
  lets make the assumption that the present reality we are both experiencing was created just 1 hour ago and it will seize to exist 1 hour later . 
  how would you be able to perceive that change , since you are part of this reality ? 
  if you say though scientific observation , all your data are tied to the short lived , self contained universe we are experiencing . 
  you are trapped in your reality . 
  a god-like entity is by definition , outside of this construct , so how you make any contact with , or even worse , understand its intentions ? 
   there is no compelling reason to assert that our reality is only an hour old and will only live for another hour . 
  if the universe in its present state came into being an hour ago , the evidence around us would still suggest that it is billions of years old and that the universe is devoid of inherent purpose or meaning . 
  no we ca n't understand the purpose of the universe when we are still inside it . 
  we are not spectators , but actors . 
  the universe could be created 1 hour before , and still be at its present state with evidence of billions of years of existence . 
  if you create realities , why do a half assed job ? 
   we ca n't know that such a being exists , but that does n't count for much since it is such an abstract and unintelligible entity . 
  the fact that the concept of god has had to retreat to such an extremely abstract formulation is very telling about the possible existence of such a being . 
  why is very telling ? 
  the answer of his existence is either one or the other and not bound on how abstract he is or not . 
  and either way , this qualities of abstract are not new , they come from almost all religions . 
  god ( s ) are omniscient , omnipresent/all powerful .
