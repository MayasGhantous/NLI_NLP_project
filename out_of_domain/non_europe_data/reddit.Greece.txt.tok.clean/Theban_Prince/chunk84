  if shiva exists , how can you understand what he intentions are as [ `` limitless , transcendent , unchanging and formless '' entity '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shiva#cite_note-shaivism_enc-5 ) ? 
   and honestly , i can come up with all sorts of reasons why a god would create a universe for two hours and let it vanish . 
  to see what would happen , for instance . 
  that 's probably the most plausible one . 
  honestly , i feel that humans are actually pretty smart when it comes down to it . 
  oh we can come up with a lot of smart reasons and we might even get the truth as we discuss it . 
  however , they will be forever unverifiable . 
  lets say you wake up inside a perfectly sealed room , with no memory how you got there . 
  you can make all kinds of assumptions , and you might even got the right one , but if you * never * leave the room you will never know . 
  our reality is our room and we ca n't get out . 
  i am not trying to say god exists or not , i am saying its pointless asking because we will ** never ** know the answer . 
  what i said is far from `` do n't ask questions '' . 
  we have to explore the play stage we have been given ( by chance or not ) . 
  i just said do n't expect definite answers for everything . 
   power shifted often and treating royal captives well increased the chances you would be treated well if they ever became your captors . 
  you also have to take in account the anti-revolutionary zeal between the great powers at the time . 
  a lot of noble heads had fallen already , so they had to keep napoleon 's intact to avoid making a habit out of it . 
  on the other hadn there are lobbyist that vie for `` honorable '' reasons , environmentalism , human rights etc. . 
  power is something that everyone aspires to , either power in politics or enough power through education and/or wealth to decide their own fate . 
  also inherent to humanity , and people that will try to get in politics ( inside any political system ) are by definition looking for that power . 
  if you want to change peoples lives in a grand scale , you also want power over them , benevolent or not . 
  their are major historical events in real life , so they should be in a historical game . 
  as you said , there are even specific dates given . 
  and this conversation is moot because now we have the nation designer to change the nation how and if we like . 
  everyone is happy !, 
  this is not how it works . 
  your computer downloads data from youtube 's servers every time you play a song , so technically you already have the song downloaded by permission ( albeit temporally ) . 
  you example would be better if the friend faxed you photos of the painting in self destructive paper , and you decided ~ ~ to take pictures of them before they got erased . ~ ~ to use a different fax machine that prints in regular , long lasting paper . 
  everything those channels provided is readily available in the internet , usually free , with greater variety and on demand . 
  while there are n't many shows with the production values that a big tv company can muster , in the end the market is saturated and the traditional channels need to find their bread elsewhere . 
  surprising , while radio survived the advent of cinema , television and home video because it filled specific niches , like locations where you ca n't have any of the above ( your car , your tent in the middle of nowhere ) the television is directly competing with the internet because they overlap a lot . 
  former night auditor here turned into semi-pro it . . maybe we should create a private club . 
  but all the stories we can share between users * and * late arrivals . . 
  my man !, 
  what is worse , a user who has tried all day to login because the password was too `` difficult '' or the guest that could n't open his door for 5 consecutive times because the key card was `` broken i tell you '' ? 
   a ** bipedal ** humanoid lifeform, 
  what about disabled persons !, 
  not an expert , but i am guessing gangs will turn to full blown independent militia/insurgents if they find themselves in the middle of a warzone and try to get a slice of land for them , as it happened in the middle east and africa . 
  they will probably shoot anyone , and use short term alliances to survive . 
  however , never forget that the game is historical , and tries to emulate world war 2 as how it * already * happened , so even as a good sandbox game , some player railroading exists . 
  neither game has the full and impossible depth to clearly present the myriad options present in rl . 
   an animal would probably just remove it 's back wheel and move it in front of the other wheels , like / u/the _ evil_within [ 2 ] said . 
  so have like , two or more extremities that have evolved to sustain the weight of the animal , and when one is touching the soil and pushing , the other is moving in front to take its place ? 
  sounds wonderful , but something sounds familiar . . 
  or , since humans notice and decipher facial excretions a lot more than scent and body language compared to wolves , dogs with a greater facial emotion range had better chances to be selected for further breeding . 
  yeah because ruthless , armed warlords never took hold of land when war broke out because they heard common people 's opinion . 
  it did n't happen in bosnia , afghanistan , iraq , somalia , sierra leone ... 
   food , water , electricity, 
  why do you think even an `` official '' government would be able to provide those in the middle of a battlefield ? 
  whats the point ? 
  the time lock was instituted during the war and before the doctor send gallifrey away . 
  it meant that suddenly , nobody could travel backwards in time to change the results of the war . 
  this is the same like the fixed points of time , where you ca n't change any events of the past , like pompey , only for a far longer stretch of time . 
  for all intents and purposes , only the `` present '' exists for the duration of the timewar . 
  the pocket universe is a completely separate incident , where the doctor locked gallifrey away and ended the timewar at the `` present '' . 
  to put it simply , the time lock made gallifrey and the time war unreachable in * time * , and the pocket universe in * space * . 
  you ca n't travel to see gallifrey in the past because it is time locked , and you cant travel to gallifrey now because it is in another universe . 
  considering we already had [ big flying dinosaurs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quetzalcoatlus ) here , it is not a stretch to think that between the myriad planets some animals evolved to look like dragons . 
  even intelligence is possible , albeit * extremely * unlikely . 
  fire breathing and magic on the other hand . . 
  and go where exactly ? 
  that was the whole point of the movie . 
  i am a regular tenant !, 
  i actually call my landlord to arrange for the rent to be payed ( we do n't have yet a bank account ) instead of waiting for him to call . 
  we exist !, 
  as a eu citizen , my three months are over and i have to go to the commune on friday to check if i am allowed to stay in the country ( get a residence card ) . 
  what pisses me off is that i have absolutely no idea how this works . 
  is it like an interview ? 
  because if it is like that i feel i have chances . 
  if not and just look at my papers i am screwed . 
  thank you , feel free to use it !, 
  they can , and every eu shengen country can do it . 
  a little known fact , but you are allowed to stay for 3 months . 
  if you want to stay more , you have to apply for permanent residency to the local authorities ( in belgium , to the local commune ) and they have the right to decline.if that happens you have to exit the country for three months ( enforced with a court order ) . 
  usual restrictions to visas apply ( ability to find a job/have a job , student , be wealthy etc ), 
  well so long a thanks for all the frites !, 
  they ca n't deport you ( arrest and kick out ) since it is forbidden by the eu but they can fine you heavily if you stay more than 90 days . 
  thanks for the sources !, 
  i presume no , since time lock implies the dimension of time is tampered at its entirety ( and theoretically , you could time travel to another place and `` move '' to past gallifrey , and that beats the entire purpose ) but we do n't have a conclusive answer . 
  we do n't even know precisely * when * and how long the war was/will be fought , so we will probably never know the extent of the time lock in time/space to further investigate . 
  well obviously , but how close to it ? 
  maybe they time locked the previous 1000 years keeping in mind the butterfly effect . 
  yes . 
  but without it the games sucks ass ( 1/2 of europe is empty wasteland for example ) . 
  you are getting down voted , but i have noticed the game popping here and there a lot these last few months , when it was virtually forgotten . 
  well [ big flying dinosaurs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quetzalcoatlus ) are as close as possible to a rl dragon like creature . 
  the pocket universe was already breached on tranzalore . 
  humans have lost interest in space exploration and colonisation because no place in our solar system can sustain large numbers of humans . 
  after that happened the anomaly appeared , but by that time human collapse was imminent and no resources where available for mass human transportation , and no concrete results that there was actually a habitable planet in the other side . 
  cue the movie . 
  well yes , but the gallifrey that can be brought back is the one at the end of the time war , so its future by definition is after the time war . 
  to help you wrap your head around , think the whole planet as a time traveler that can move into time and space . 
  you will always have a `` present '' version , like the 13th doctor is the `` present '' version . 
  i am sorry i misunderstood your question . 
  no he cant , because unless it is a fixed point of time , time can be changed or eve he does that , the result is set in stone . 
  think schrodinger 's cat . 
  i though about it better . 
  since gallifrey is trapped into a pocket universe , it is outside of time itself ( regardless of the time lock ) galliferey will never be there unless the point of its return is experienced by its witnesses/actors , probably the doctor itself . 
  or something else entirely is happening that we do n't know off , a lot of things are left vague . 
  i would also like to point out that i am running out of ideas trying to stretch someone elses plot , and i strongly suggest you to post into / r/asksciencefiction to get better results ...
