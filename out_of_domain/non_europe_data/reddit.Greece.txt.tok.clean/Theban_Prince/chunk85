  well since it is in another universe , technically they are right . 
  but it is a pocket universe , probably a bubble of our reality . 
  since we can assume the doctor will be there on the moment when gallifrey returns , until he witnesses that event it will never happen . 
  if he travels into the future now , gallifrey will not be there until it happens into the `` present '' . 
  and a more worrying thought is that if the doctor searches for gallifrey into the future , the result he finds is now fixed on time . 
  so , lets say the doctor finds gallifrey never returned , and now he ca n't go back and change that anymore . 
  [ poor poor mr. 
  ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/shootenok/8180457/132089/132089_original.gif ), 
  what ? 
  no [ terry gilliam ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=terry+gilliam+animations&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1252&amp;bih=614&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=s3yvvylsjcktadvqgbgo&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ) for a 70 's extravaganza ? 
  a painter that had a great idea but with poor execution unless he had a whole workshop backing him up ? 
  why the hell should i feel sorry for mr lucas ? 
  i will feel sorry for the unknown screenwriter who barely survives trying to get his work some attention , not for someone that enjoyed success and usually acclaim for 40 years , racked up billions , and successfully sold his saga to another major studio to keep the legacy true . 
  priorities man . 
   more like a ride home by the police, 
  i could get behind this , but fines and arrest ? 
  why the american law system is so biblical ? 
  can you imagine some government imposing curfew ( \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ) ?!, 
  for our non-greek friends , the last time that happened was when a dictatorship was imposed in the country . 
  it will be like the british where back in the us . 
  what abrams has to do with anything ? 
  we where discussing lucas . 
  i am sorry but star wars was a gargantuan success both critically and commercially . 
  it is a juggernaut in pop culture and sci fi and lucas are recognized for his role about that . 
  if you think star wars acquired by disney can change that you are wrong . 
  the dude has nothing we should feel sorry about . 
   so if you spent a huge chunk of your life working on a project you absolutely loved , and then everyone in the world suddenly turned on you and told you that you were suddenly incompetent and had ruined their lives and precious childhood memories , that you would feel ok because you have money . 
   are you saying that if george lucas had ( god forbid ) killed himself over the fan reactions rather than selling the franchise , you would still say it 's on because he has his financial success ? 
  what ? 
  i think you are over blowing things in magnitudes and making baseless assumptions ( how did you though about suicide for gods shake ? 
   you just seem to be treating george as an untalented pile of emotionless money i wondered how far that went, 
  do n't put words in my mouth to suit your worldview . 
  i only said that like other creators , when he has free reign and money he did n't produced on par as his previous work . 
  and despite that he ** is ** a celebrated artist both commercially or critically for the total of his work . 
  these are my words . 
  your question will remain unanswered because you are discussing within your imaginary world where you assume all the fans are out to get lucas . 
   for someone that enjoyed success ** and usually acclaim for 40 years ** , racked up billions , and successfully sold his saga to another major studio, 
  can you read these words ? 
  yeah because gm would be paying those claims by itself and the government was the one that stopped them ... 
  oh wait , it can do it now , but does n't . 
  if financial success * additionally * with viewer and critic acclaim is not enough ( concerning an artists work ) then what ?!, 
  be honest , you missed that when you first replied did n't you ? 
  you have to understand that i believe he is n't depressed , just annoyed , i never said he should n't be because money and fame . 
  if you do have info that he is depressed ( clinically ) the obviously no man should be made like that for absolutely no reason . 
  i think you read too much in to my comments . 
  so , what , the guy is a billionaire , a critically acclaimed creator and with a happy personal life we are discussing what ? 
  because the bussiness he enjoyed ** for 40 years ** is not that enjoyable anymore and he sold it for 4 friggin billions ? 
  really ? 
  its a great read , and you have to take in mind that it is as raw as a story can be from an editing point . 
  it had great potential , alas it will never be . 
  it looked exactly like revan ... 
  yeah that pic is specifically selected to show as different as possible . 
  this is [ revan ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100612174407/starwars/images/1/1e/sith_revan.jpg ) , he looks like concept art for kalo for crying out loud . 
  i am not saying that is revans mask , but i am sure the similarities are not accidental . 
  nope , those are explanations from the series . 
   explore the ruins of black mesa . 
  find audio logs and discover the secrets behind black mesa . 
  just this . 
  i like your post , but i would like to point out that the sinking of uss maine was never proven as a false flag operation . 
  i would like to point out that the ketty perry on a lion might not be exactly accidental . 
  no i do n't think the illuminati are here to get us , but i think the designers where influenced , or possibly they did that on purpose to create controversy . 
  also , superb articles ~ !, 
  pretty much . 
  reminds you of something else called a `` false flag '' ? 
  you are either 15 or 50 . 
  girls are thinking exactly like boys concerning sex . 
  man this is bad science , since it reaches a conclusion ignoring social and cultural interferences . 
  people are not mice . 
  if you want to make it proper science , you would research the body reactions when they hear the question , before the brain analyses all the relevant pros and cons if you want to go to the biological way . 
  bad bad * bad * science ... 
  would the questions be skewed if they where asked in a brothel or convent ? 
  what evolutionary connections can you apply to this ? 
  was the person asking the question evolutionary '' attractive with a control group asked by someone not attractive ? 
  they where looking for a specific result , and surprise , they found it !, 
   and we are talking about a world in which people actively fight against birth control and have a very traditional attitude regarding sex . 
  ho boy is this generalizing . 
  so you respond a generalization with an even worse one ? 
  or maybe you know , learn to think that reality is a very complex place , where a single answer never exists . 
  oh i know what you mean . 
  but you have to understand those are also based on cultural and social norms , not evolutionary ( at least only ) . 
  there where cultures where women where expected to have multiple partners/husbands or where teenagers where expected to have sexual experiences on an even ground . 
  this does n't add up with your theory about `` evolution '' because they had the same evolutionary path , but different reactions to sex and their willingness to take risks . 
  ehh i agree ep2 was worse , but at least ep .3 in the duel between obi wan and anakin is starting to look that they are getting properly paced and feels like star wars ... 
  then it ends . 
  i also believe our biological urges affect civilization , but you are stretching it . 
  you are trying to find patterns where there are none . 
  but not only . 
  i am not trying to contradict you , but point out that lumping up everything under `` evolution `` is extremely simplifying . 
  i am waiting to get close to ep7 to re watch the entire series in that order , however i do n't know if that will cut essential stuff out . 
  i said it felt star wars , not that it was the best thing since someone discovered birth control . 
  that does n't make the quote seem less . 
  i think it even makes it more of a boast . 
   drrrr ** uuuuuuuuuu ** illlll, 
   breakeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrr, 
  if it is , you cant do anything about it , so why not enjoy it ? 
  well it is happening for hundreds of years , so do n't expect it to go away easily . 
  to give you a more specific answer , the world of fallout is not that original concerning the theme . 
  it is based on futuristic views held [ by people of the 50s ] ( http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/1945-atomic-age-nyt.jpg ) , on how nuclear power will change the world for the better , from [ nuclear cars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_nucleon ) to [ buildings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:space_needle_at_dusk_2011_-_02.jpg ) . 
  if you image search for '' [ atomic age ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=atomic+age&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=aa01ver8mmfe7aaljodgdw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1252&amp;bih=614 ) '' in google , you will find a lot of stuff that look like fallout props but where actually real life furniture and posters .
