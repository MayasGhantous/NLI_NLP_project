  of course that did n't turn out that way because nuclear power can have terrible results if mishandled . 
  so in conclusion , fallout is how people in the post ww2 america thought the world would look like in the future , sprinkled with dark humor and irony on how the 50s was a shitty period under a sugarcoat ( red scare , suburbia , jingoism ) . 
   ethnically cleanse, 
  i think you are looking for the word genocide . 
  unless we are speaking about german shepherds or scottish terriers . 
  there are numerous ips where a lot of answers come from canon that it is obsolete or semi-obsolete ( warhammer 40k comes to mind ) or where tidbits of info are stretched as much as possible ( particularly in `` what if '' questions ) . 
  this is not a subreddit where we gauge who is the best knowledgeable or the most correct in a particular canon . 
  as long as it does n't contradict clear and established canon , i think differentiating the answers `` in character '' is too meta , it goes against the spirit of the subreddit and invites `` disney is bad/good '' fights . 
  this a perfect reply for early access complains also . 
  if you decide to contribute to an unfinished product , always keep in mind it might never complete . 
  it happens to huge companies that invest millions in r&d for new products that lead to nowhere , why are you so harsh to small , unknown companies ? 
  did they make huge promises then got the money and run ? 
  it also happens with well established brands . 
  just never give a penny to them again . 
  that might be ok before the internet , binge watching and the present state of major tv shows ( heavy emphasis on story lines vs episodic format ) i fear it will not go down well . . 
  unless you count pokemon as creepy . 
  but how does that effect you personally if you have n't bought the game ? 
   you 're forced to buy sub-par games and hunt for enjoyment when a very successful business has the chance to make things better for everyone . 
  i am and you are not forced to do anything . 
  there are a lot of indie games and small companies out there . 
  just stop buying games from companies that you feel you got tripped off , and unsubscribe from subreddits and forums that skew your world view with their circle jerk . 
  unless you only own a console , then you are in pretty deep shit concerning choices you have . 
  how ? 
  but you are not forced to buy any single one of these games . 
  the market is not an oligopoly between ea , ubisoft and activision . 
  i am an avid gamer ( 5 + hours per day ) witch spends more than 20 $ per month for games , possibly even more . 
  i have n't bought a newly released product from these three since dragon age 2 , and i am loving it . 
  this is n't about gaming anymore , is it ? 
  fellow receptionist here . 
  does biting your nails due to work related stress counts ? 
  this is not unemployment ( especially forced ) per se , but a sabbatical . 
  there is a huge difference that the movies forget to distinguish . 
  just watch europa report a movie ten times better than gravity . 
  holy shit [ 1,079 $ ] ( http://www.kay.com/en/kaystore/diamonds---gemstones/chocolate-quartz-necklace-1-4-ct-tw-diamonds-14k-gold/100020/100020.100023.100055 ) for this ** crap ** ?!, 
  someone need to start some legislation yesterday !, 
  am i becoming a meme ? 
  do n't feel bad . 
  its the default reaction of companies to preserve their legal rights . 
  if someone proved that they where aware about the minis and did nothing , it could create a precedent . 
  tv and hollywood are siting upon millions ( quite possibly billions ) with online streaming yet they have their heads stuck in the 90 's ( * internez are bad for mo legal rights ! * ) . 
  example : game of thrones world wide premiere . 
  so do n't expect them to be so smart unfortunately . 
  due to how dog meats ai ignored the forcefields to get close to the enemies/follow you , the majority of players lost him like that . 
  so they made it canon in fallout 2 . 
  you should . 
  i would be ok buying a 5-30 $ schematic ( depending of size ) for my personal enjoyment . 
  i hate going to tabletop shops . 
  not a legal precedent . 
  you can be fine with 5 euros change in your pocket ( that is 2x2e and 1x1e ) . 
  you do n't need more to get around . 
  i am guessing the same holds true with the pound . 
  if the files/designs are yours , you can reupload your stuff without any infringing material ( monsters that are copyrighted by hasbro ) . 
  also we judge with hindsight . 
  in the resent day , `` cult '' is a word that instantly bring to mind religious nut jobs . 
  but this is because of jonestown and other dreadful events like heaven 's gate . 
  at that time people did not have any such example . 
  however , paradox interactive is the mother company and you can use it both as a dev and as a publisher . 
  for example , its not common to distinguish between rockstar and rockstar leeds . 
  edit : til that people assume publishers have no input on the creation of a game when they have a contract with the devs . 
  and this why we need proper dynastic relations . 
  * nose hear, 
  who gave them the money to complete the idea ? 
  it was the paradox * interactive * investment to those great games that made them real , and the quite possibly their corporate philosophy . 
  compare and contrast publishers that push for unrealistic release dates , interfere with development , and fund projects like mobile trash or yearly releases of tired ips . 
  paradox does take credit for those games for making it happen . 
  edit : made it more clear i am talking about paradox ** interactive ** , the mother company of paradox ** development ** and publisher of skylines . 
  well to play devils advocate , the lab anim . . i mean the children have no access to the overall data and research , neither how are they are interpreted and presented . 
  yet they are two parts of the same company that deal with different cases like paradox interactive and paradox developement studio . 
  one is part of the other , so you can use them interchangeably . 
  `` paradox '' is the name of the entire company . 
   a lot of scientists are coming out and starting to say that most animal tests are irrelevant to humans . 
  in fact , some drug companies are starting to say this . 
  unless you have sources , this is baseless . 
  however paradox interactive funded collossal orders game , so they had a hand on its making . 
  as far as i know , publishing companies can influence game development in various ways due to contract clauses . 
  read the thread title . 
  nowhere it implies paradox created the game . 
  they can find another dev or even colossal order themselves and issue a contract for a medieval game . 
  lets take paradox out of the equation and replace it with ea or ubisoft . 
  would things be the same ? 
  does publishers have no control at all on what product is released ? 
  neither paradox interactive nor development studio . 
  it can mean both . 
  unless he specified the paradox created the game themselves he is not wrong . 
  yep pretty much . 
  i believe paradox interactive as the mother company can be used as an umbrella term when it is * obvious * we are talking about games developed by the in-house studio ( for example , no one specifies ubisoft montreal vs ubisoft annecy when they discuss assasins creed , just ubisoft ) but everyone jumped on the wrong conclusion . 
  since op left it ambiguous , he could refer paradox as the publisher . 
  since the publisher is essentially the `` boss '' in the relationship , he should be appreciated when he skillfully interacts with his `` employees '' and lets them deliver quality work . 
  of course a hardworking and talented dev can switch companies , but let say moves to a new one that offers strict delivery deadlines , pushes more budget for marketing instead of development ( no you cant hire more designers , not you cant have an extended beta testing because something when unexpected during the development phase etc ) they will finish the game eventually , but will the quality of the product be the same ? . 
  hey our friendly argument helped me get my mind out of a problem i have stuck for days now , and obviously this is how the solution came to me . 
  so the `` bravo ! '', 
  from my boss is also for you . 
  more happily than expected !, 
  why in this case most western nations pressure turkey to take responsibility for atrocities that happened in 1915 under a different regime , and greece pressuring germany for the exact same reasons in 1945 is called an unnecessary `` reminder of the past '' or even [ stupid ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/07/us-eurozone-greece-reparations-germany-iduskbn0my1jr20150407 ) ? 
  what are the legal differences , if any ?
