  the down vote is not a disagree button . 
  reply to me . 
  this is not [ true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_reparations#armenian_organizations_demanding_reparations ) . 
  if you read the article , under ** international ** law , if turkey admits the genocide ( the purpose of the world as you claim ) the armenians [ can claim reparations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_reparations#grounds_in_international_law ) . 
  so you ca n't have one without the other . 
  i do n't see any other way expect similar with the republic system . 
  with that way you can keep your dynasty in the holy order/mercenary band even when you lose the main title ( as the republic ) . 
  either you keep playing the title ( but you change dynasty ) or keep the dynasty and lose the title ( that will possibly make you landless and game over ) . 
  unless they implemet a landless character gameplay , which i am very much for since it opens huge possibilities ( playable priests and baronies ) , but it needs a lot of events and mechanics to make it interesting early game . 
  the location will be an issue . 
  the ai path finding is not the best , especially concerning boats . 
  it could cause an ai mercenary band to get stuck into other side of the map for the duration of the game . 
  they need at least a starting camp so if the armies get disbanded they can reappear there , and they will work essentially as allies now when they join wars . 
  as others pointed out , you need the other ingredient for the melting pot , norman !, 
  it will probably be a reskinned wow that will die 1 year later or switch to freemium . 
  mmorpgs , what a wasted opportunity . . 
  or you can make the main camp as a title movable between the smaller camps , closer to the hot zones . 
  it will be the rally point between the `` vassal '' mercenaries ( sergeants ? ), 
  and their camps , so when you rise the main army as the leader you get everyone at the same spot and you deplete the smaller camps for the duration . 
  it could also work out as tribals call vassals now ( or how you called vassals in ck1 ) , with possibility for sergeants to deny you . 
  why not make it more open than dnd ? 
  gurps has phd levels of historical lore books . 
  / r/historicalroleplay sounds nice . 
  i am creator and mod of / r/insidejorahshead a fairly well off subreddit . 
  i can set up a bit of css and automoderator . 
  i am a history enthusiast since i could read and a dm ( i also have read a lot about other games like gurps ) . 
  quite possibly effect the content since the name sets the tone ( `` i know this is not dnd but i found this gurps lorebook '' posts ) . 
  not a lot of people read the sidebars . 
  how about / r/historicaltabletop ? 
  i think they are uncut novelty/joke flip flops like [ these . 
  ] ( http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/888754272_1/free-shippng-2013-fashion-sandals-for-women-novelty-cute-footwear-new-design-beach-flip-flops-shaped.jpg ), 
  they can implant the clones with memories of jango . 
  since memories are stored into certain parts of the brain , it is not unreasonable that a high technology civilization can extract these and implant them into the clones . 
  and realistically , they still needed years of training because memories are not equal to experience . 
   can you imagine if someone like john mccain ( for americans ) or john major ( for brits ) turned out to be secretly a wizard ? 
  actually it will be more appropriate example if bush jr. was revealed to be osama bin laden . 
  and that 's why i do n't understand political systems that are based around the conent of everyone like anarchist movements . 
  what stops a small and powerful group abusing it ? 
  and yes , way worse than now , since they wont be even the meager checks and scales of the state . 
  / r/decadeclub /, 
  yeah i think if you have the technology to move memories between brains you can select which to move . . 
  sorry i had to be more clear , by new testament i mean the four gospels . 
  the book of revelation is definitely out . 
  only the direct words of jesus are to be included . 
  and as i see `` god '' , he has set the universe in motion but either he does n't interfere , or we cant comprehend the purpose if he does . 
  but i believe * jesus * had some great ideas for living your life , and that does n't change if he is the son of god or not . 
  so in my religion you can believe in the divinity of jesus or not , because it is irrelevant to the value of his words . 
   were n't those religions full of enemies ? 
  the mesoamerican empires kept that practice for millennia between different civilizations , and lost due to the technological advantage of the europeans . 
  their religious practices where irrelevant , even if they where not sacrificing people they would still lost . 
  another great example , almost every single civilization in the planet practiced slavery , the treatment of other human beings as mere objects to be sold or discarded ( or worse ) . 
  you are confusing social interaction ( that is indeed in our dna as a species ) to `` morality '' . 
  again and again , with feral children or survivors turning to cannibalism moral have failed because they need certain conditions to appear . 
  cooperation between individuals does n't exclude oppression of other individuals . 
  people who had committed atrocities are perfectly capable to function in the society . 
  lets take this the other way . 
  you say ` morality '' inherent . 
  so there is an `` evil '' dna that turns people into monsters ? 
   but it was not the same empire all the time . 
  that further proves my point . 
  it was n't a one time deal , but resurfaced again and again . 
  did natives had `` evil '' dna ? 
   so let 's forget about the existence of an afterlife and focus on here . 
  on our present , and in our life . 
  what if we let go of all the information that our bodies perceive and focus on our mental state ? 
  say that you are in peace with you family and everyone loves each other . 
  they treat you right and you are always trying to avoid hurting them in any way and they will try the same . 
  what if we had that on a global scale ? 
  is n't that what jesus said ? 
  did n't jesus assure you that doing that would take you to heaven , to his father ? 
  what if , just if , there is no dying and going to heaven , it 's just us for like 80 + / - years in a tiny blue pearl in the vastness of the galaxy , trying to coexist in the best possible way with each other . 
  would n't that be almost heaven ? 
  would n't that be what jesus talked about ? 
  i think welcome . 
  this is precisely what i believe . 
  i think the intelligence we have is the `` divine '' that allows as to change the face of the world for better or for worse . 
  if we are compassionate and caring with each other and the world around us , even at the most difficult situations , when fear and anger takes hold , we can literally create heaven on earth . 
  its the most difficult path to tread , not to hate . 
  the existence of an afterlife does n't matter , because if there is one , you are at the hands of god , if there is n't , you would have lived a full and good life before your death .
