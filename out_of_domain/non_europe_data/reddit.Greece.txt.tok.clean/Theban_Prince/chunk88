  this `` membership '' is a lot like reddit gold , the main content ( a shitload of mods ) is free , but it enhances the experience ( faster downloads , removes ads etc ) . 
  for better results , you can donate to mod creators thought their individual pages . 
  lets put our money where our mouth is and support the good guys . 
  this is not about giving money , this is about principles . 
  does that means that any original lego constructs i make i can sell them under the same paradigm ? 
  is n't this essentially working for them with percentage out of the sales ? 
  where do you see steam you asshole ????? 
  this is but this ( totalbiscuits take on valve offering paid mods . 
  - [ 22:01 ] ) is n't ?!, 
  how about [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g5wzoy4.png ) or [ this . 
  yeah you are doing a bang up job . 
  [ more ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zehpdw.jpg ) [ modgate ] ( https://www.change.org/p/valve-remove-the-paid-content-of-the-steam-workshop?just_created=true ) [ related ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aiblvpc.jpg ) thread that are perfectly ok but you killed mine twice . 
  nexus is one of the biggest repositories of free mods out there . 
  buy a membership and keep their servers running .

   snoo hover text was me poking at the current shitstorm . 
  regardless of the situation , there 's nothing preventing us from having a little fun with the situation . 
  and before you ask , the only compensation we 've ever received from modding has been three months of reddit gold a few months back . 
  we have zero financial motivation for modding pcmr . 
  its about the modgate plain and simply ( the post , not the snoo ) . 
   totalbiscuit usually tends to offer more talking points than a single comment . 
  i have n't watched it yet , but another mod cleared the post so i 'll take his word that it 's substantial enough to stay . 
  i 'm balancing clearing / new and trying to enjoy dinner right now . 
  i have n't had the time yet , but i intend to watch it . 
  same as above . 
  seriously they cant even implement anti-piracy measures on the mods ... what are they thinking ? 
  `` third party dlc ? '', 
  lets not slander the word mod , and it pretty much describes what they are . 
   you will see lots of future amazing content that would n't have been possible for people to create for free . 
  we already have those , they are called dlcs . 
  ehh bethesda where the ones that also did this shit with the `` horse armor dlc '' , so them being greedy iss not surpise . 
  but two `` holy '' words `` steam '' and `` mods '' turning into the evil of ea and ubisoft in the * same * time ? 
  [ gog games ] ( http://www.gog.com/ ) . 
  no drm , great prices and nice presentation . 
  i was already thinking about mailing them my primary retailer , this seals the deal . 
  yet they effectively freeze any new content since any new material are buried under thousands of replies . 
  they effectively shuttec down the subreddit . 
  [gog.com ] ( http://www.gog.com/ ), 
  ** great deals ** ( not valve level , but getting there rapidly ), 
  ** no drm ** ( play you game without internet , copy it to another computer to play with your cousin , whatever , its yours ), 
  ** no launcher needed ** ( double click game.exe , start playing . 
  ** beautiful presentation ** ( your purchased games are set up as a library!looks great ! ), 
  ** tons of extras ** ( games usually include original manuals , but also wallpapers , books , maps etc for free ), 
  those are not mods anymore , but third party dlcs . 
  nope . 
  worst case scenario some mods are pulled off nexus . 
  tell me the differences between dlc and a payed mod . 
  you old joke in the snoo is used under the modgate controversy . 
  the post i linked was specifically for that and according to your rules should be deleted . 
  my threads where not memes , photoshops , or valve is evil or snoo jokes . 
  it is about supporting a different group . 
  it is tied to the theme of the thread but is not derivative . 
  it is , as you say '' potential for discussion '', 
   why is now any different ? 
  because it contradicts your rules, 
  as a fellow mod , no sorry , i do n't trust you . 
  access to the internet to download steam and register through that , even if you bought the ** discs ** themselves . 
  mind you the game was already 10 years old by then . 
  and this is how i turned to piracy for 15 years . 
  it is 5 am and i need to sleep i have n't been this way since the fappening omg !, 
  it might not even work at all or break your game ( or god forbid your savegame ) . 
  would you pay for an oven that was notorious for exploding ? 
  would the creator feel entitled ? 
   considering that any dispute is likely to take some time to resolve given valves notoriously shitty customer support . 
  um they are going to court , not to valve . 
  hilariously , since parts of mods are copyrighted , valve can be hit by dmcas left and right ... lol . 
  no i did not . 
  where you on eve at the time ? 
  neither dota or cs are mods anymore , they are polished fulle fledged games with dev time , technical support , continuous updates and patches , that are * based * on old mods . 
  i do n't know if they are even written the same . 
  thats weird . 
  your ignorance is hurting . 
  if you ca n't see the difference between optional fees for upkeep versus paywalls or that this is not a philosophical problem , but a practical one ( bug support for a 20 $ mod ? ), 
  then you are simply trolling . 
  heh good on you !, 
  i think it would be better instead of giving 2 $ to steam mods instead you give it to nexus to provide better service . 
  add more games to their catalogue . 
  maybe built an even better installer . 
  but hey it is * optional * so you decide !, 
   helping out nexus is great and all but we should really push nexus to think if ways to support mod makers ethically . 
  setting up a patreon style early acess to mod updates or something for mod makers to help their poor souls keep working . 
  i like this !, 
  commonplace = / = moral . 
  and you are `` forced `` to work for them since if you quit `` now '' before you have an alternative you are in deep trouble . 
   but if i ever feel like i can provide that platform/infastructure/list of clients/etc . 
  i can jump ship and do it all myself , and modders can do the same . 
  you will never be able to do that because you are taking only 25 % of the sales . 
  however as customers , we too can choose where and if we spend our money . 
  this is why i set up this thread , to donate to mods and a different platform instead of being forced to do so . 
  its the same people taking the money , but with better service and they got a bigger cut . 
  win win for everyone !, 
  the first and only so far . 
  so donate to mod creators witch still have free mods in the workshop or they do n't even upload them there . 
  `` mods '' is not a homogenous group . 
   whether you pay for a mod , or you pay for the servers that host a mod , someone still ** has ** to pay . 
  do you understand that this is not the case ? 
  you can use nexus and 100 % of its content , for ** 0 $ ** .
