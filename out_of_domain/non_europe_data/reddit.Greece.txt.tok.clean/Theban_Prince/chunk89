  but this case supports what you are also saying . 
  you are supporting mod creators getting payed for they work . 
  why not donate them through nexus ( you can through each mods page ) and they get the ** full ** amount , instead of a percentage split between valve and bethesda . 
  mods subpage in pirate bay in 3,2 , . . 
   they are currently in the process of removing them from nexus and putting them on steam . 
  not everyone is doing that , and support those . 
  someone suggested a patreon type support for modders . 
  sounds great for me . 
  they get a steady trickle of money based on monthly donations . 
  about nexus , i seem the expanding and upgrading all the time ( the website is completely different since 2-3 years ago ) , so i do n't think it is that bad . 
  i also posted nexus because it provides donations for modders , and big chunk is about skyrim mods . 
  you can do it any other way you please obviously . 
  alternatives to steam :, 
  it is one of the biggest repositories for free mods out there , particularly for skyrim . 
  it offers an * optional * membership that helps them keep their servers running . 
  this `` membership '' is a lot like reddit gold , the main content ( a shitload of mods ) is always free , but it enhances the experience ( faster downloads , removes ads etc ) . 
  ** for better results , you can donate to mod creators through their individual pages . 
  they get the full amount **, 
  [gog.com ] ( http://www.gog.com/ ), 
  ** great deals ** ( not valve level , but getting there rapidly ), 
  ** no drm ** ( play your game without internet , burn it to a disk , copy it to another computer to play with your cousin , whatever , its yours ), 
  ** no launcher needed ** ( double click game.exe , start playing . 
  ** 30 day return policy ** ( your game does n't work where it should ? 
  get your real money back . ), 
  ** beautiful presentation ** ( your purchased games are set up as a [ library ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fww2k.jpg ) ! looks great ! ), 
  ** tons of extras ** ( games usually include original manuals , but also wallpapers , books , maps etc for free ), 
  obviously there are others , feel free to mention them , but for * me * these offered the best in service and quality of support for what they are doing . 
  nexus really upped their game the last 2 years . 
  the website is quite different and always expanding . 
  why not donate directly to the mod creator through nexus and cut the middle man ? 
  well if you want to spend money to them , you can contact them to add one . 
  and if donations becomes the norm to stop payed mods , more will jump into the wagon . 
  surprisingly , not a lot of people know that . 
  you know its a circular way right ? 
  more customers -  more games available -  more customers . 
  code and models can be identified , and they are copyrighted since they are original creations . 
  you can dcma steam if that happens . 
  obviously this would happen . 
  but if us the customers , keep supporting free mods the trend will change . 
  most of new games are available . 
  and they always expanding . 
  i think you need to understand what [ expanding ] ( https://twitter.com/gogcom/status/591224069737095168 ) means . 
  obviously , if you ca n't find it in gog you can get it from other retailers , but if the first place you look is always gog ( aka your primary retailer ) more companies will decide to add their catalog to them . 
   so the armenian groups saying a genocide took place can be right about that , and simultaneously be wrong about demanding reparations . 
  however under international law they have the right to claim it . 
  read my response . 
  if the genocide is recognized , they can ask for reparations . 
  they can go to international courts and press their claims . 
  if the decision is good for them , those organizations can issues fines and trade restrictions to turkey to pressure her to pay . 
  of course its not all roses , usually for the big one do n't do that out of the kindness their hearts , and that is my cmv , that europe is hypocritical . 
  the four-plus agreement was not signed by greece.its right there in your link . 
  is greece the vassal of one of these states without sovereign rights ? 
   second , genocide is different than `` just '' war atrocities . 
  the systemic attempt to annihilate a whole people is viewed as `` even more atrocious '' . 
  form a moral standpoint , possibly . 
  but from a legal point a successor state is obliged to pay . 
  the way they are going to use the money is not the issue . 
  if they have the rights to to money , they can use them as they see fit . 
  the armenians are looking for recognition , and then they will probably look for reparations, 
   `` you get what you pay for '', 
  have you never payed for something and the the product was n't as advertised ? 
  and you are comparing a company with massive resources ( that still sometimes produces shit products by the way ) to a mod dev that might steal code , provide a broken product or falsely advertise his mod easily . 
  and you do n't even get your money back !, 
  in 1960 , greece accepted 115 million marks as compensation for nazi crimes . 
  nevertheless , past greek governments * have insisted that this was only a down-payment , not complete reparations . 
  they never agreed they reparations where complete . 
  and that was before the crisis mind you . 
   it 's hardly the same situation, 
  why ? 
  just becasue you feel like that ? 
  what do teh international laws says about this ? 
  i understand what you are say , and i close to awarding your delta . 
  however , why do they accuse the greeks for inciting old grudges when the recognition for the armenian genocide is an older issue ? 
  and lets say turkey recognizes the genocide . . then what is the point ? 
  why all this pressure ? 
  just so they sign a paper that yes it happened ? 
  all this uproar for one piece of paper ? 
  so if germany have given them 1 $ would it be bad to ask for the rest ? 
  either they have to pay the full amount or we are joking . 
  [ you can copyright code . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/software_copyright ), 
  but you never get your money back , just steam credit . 
  so the middle man , valve , never loses their money . 
  and what happens if after 24 hours your mod corrupts your game ? 
  so just because there is already a shitty policy for official games you are ok to be extended to mods also , notoriously unreliable software that you have no way of testing before hand . 
  tell me another product that does n't have defective clauses or that you can ' t check out as much as possible before purchasing ... 
  you cant find the mods elsewhere . 
  and if those you got for free have the main game updated you are fucked because they are behind a paywall now . 
  can you save your game to different storage devices , install it to a computer without connection and play ? 
   which consists of neo nazis, 
  what ? 
  the party participating in the coalition is as neo nazi as the republicans . 
  i am not arguing the moral points , i am arguing the legal points . 
   the armenians just want justice . 
  what you consider justice ? 
  do you think turkey does n't recognize the genocide just because ? 
  no of course , if the armenians only wanted a peace of paper with a `` sorry '' on it they would have got it . 
  but in reality this will leave turkey open for legal action . 
   the reparations are payed . 
  it 's over .
