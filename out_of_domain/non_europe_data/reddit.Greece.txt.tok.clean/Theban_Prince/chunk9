  i think most people remember him from their first play though . 
  up until that point , especially if you followed the story missions ( usually what new players will do ) everything you have fought was easy ( you have even killed a goddamn dragon !, 
  ) . so for a lot of us this was a hard wake up call.hairy-fist-in-the face hard . 
  i feel ya brother.still as others said , spoilers . 
  outdated.i really hoped that after they left bb out ( argh ! ), 
  they would at least make stability something more than a nerf meter for the player.a random nerf meter ( oh you just pushed stability to 3 ? here 2 comets in one year ) . 
  his bacon number is probably -1, 
  ahhh back to necropolis.no dogmeat!you stupid mongrel , do n't attack the huge green guy with the flamethrower !! ... duh ! ... 
  anyone for some roasted dog meat ? 
  be careful what you say [ about potatoes . . ] ( http://www.cosplayisland.co.uk/files/costumes/855/41850/5643874030_530d7eba22.jpg ), 
   probably just sorting out what exactly the guy was doing . 
  i think it was kinda obvious.the officer is reacting almost instantly with mechanical movements.i think he reacted to an unknown situation and his training kicked in ( if you notice he is instantly commanding him to move over , pointing and taking the cuffs out all in the same time ) . when he secured him and had the time to evaluate the situation he let him go.no harm done actually . 
  i am already in necropolis with 100 + days left ... maybe because i am in my 7th ( or more ) play though . . :d, 
  i was greeted by 7 radscoprions just a few clicks from vault 13 . 
  `` oh critters to kill for xp!i am sure they are going to be easy enough for 1st level character , right?right ? 
  you have to go all the way north at the edge of the map and then turn ~ ~ left ~ ~ right to shandy sands . 
  no problem!save often and in different slots , because glitches like these can kill your play . 
  [ it has been explained ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/solway_firth_spaceman ) . it is his wife.the reason she looks that way is because of overexposure and he did n't know about her because he could see 70 % of the whole picture through the viewfinder . 
   if you wan na find good shit you 're gon na have to work . 
  if i ever become royalty or filthy rich , i will use this as my family motto . 
  or , you know.usa . 
  actually you might need a tutorial to create a new map from scratch.a more detailed map of the usa only would be nice.and why not do this in crusader kings?it makes much more sense and it would be easier . 
  you know that you can create entire new maps , right?they will have to do it anyway . 
  the hub is a republic.ncr and brotherhood are elective monarchies.the legion , mutants and raiders are feudal monarchies.raiders and mutants could be pagans , so they can really raid in the game.you can have mercs to employ.you can have different cultures/races . you can have all provinces start with 1 holding so you experience the whole rebuilt the wasteland feel.heck , even the character stats can be renamed to special stats.you can have traits amd, 
  perks from the game effect your character.ck2 is the best for it . 
  also hitler . 
  do you want spoilers?a hint i can give you is `` underground '' . literally . 
  they are getting better and better.v whie ck2 slugs out in later date for me , eu4 is running like a bitch on fire . 
  he gave the game name of a guy that was supposedly experiencing rl family problems , and told anyone to grief him . 
  in front of dozens of spectators . 
  i found you video title a little pretentious.thane you broke 5 bricks with your hand . 
  i was talking about the ( camera ? ), 
  angle 2 . i thought , `` what , this guy thinks he is so awesome he uploads different angles of himself ? '' . 
  then you broke 5 bricks with your * hand *, 
  i got you man.i was sarcastic with myself.excellent job !, 
  i play dwarf fortress , eve and paradox interactive game.the arma ui is the hitler of eve 's goering . . 
  tbh , in most rpg 's its not really obvious when the companions have new stuff to say , leading on to the infamous :, 
  '' [ i 'm in the middle of some calibrations ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-in-the-middle-of-some-calibrations ) '' . 
  again and again and again . 
  real mood killer.so its no wonder a lot of people said `` fuck it '', 
  edit : holy moly batman , did we stirred some xenophilia nest ? 
  for some reason you both read like a post apocalyptic log.i do n't expect to sleep today . 
   an unidentified flu-like respiratory illness has ** emerged and began ** killing people in texas this week . 
  those three words along with the unspecified number of victims is obviously chosen to inspire the feeling of something dreadful just started and is n't even at its highest point yet.also by referencing the * whole * state it tries to imply a big number of deaths . 
   a yet unidentified flu-like respiratory illness has been detected in conroe regional medical center , tx . 
  8 possible cases , 4 of them fatal ( middle aged males ) . 
  better . 
  the falalan lyrics and tune is not a christmas carol.its is based on an [ \\ ( in \\ ) famous song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwdnnyysdli ) from europa universalis ii soundtrack.its an inside joke . 
  publish it as a new game : terra universalis . 
  and make a converter from hearts of iron : east vs west.so we can play ckii -  eu4 -  vic2 -  hoi 3 -  hoi : evw -  red shift : terra universalis , and create the norse interstellar empire of paradox . 
   it 's deck the halls, 
  he asked what the second tune ( falalan ) was , not the entire song . 
  i can relate to this . 
  i suddenly got up from a cafe i was sitting with my s.o. , went to one of those [ claw games ] ( http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/774/540/420/420540774_649.jpg ) where you have to catch a doll , i played one ( 1 ) coin , won a lovely dog plushy , and walked back to the table and offered it to my astonished girl friend.all this with a determined look on my face from start to finish.i still do n't know how i did it . 
  ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ it . 
   use that assassin to assimilate into german nazi society and culture . 
  then when the time is right . 
  put a bullet in hitler 's head when he 's sleeping and make it look like a suicide . 
  things that would probably either never happen or take a lot more to achieve :, 
  * the blacklisting of anything labeled `` eugenics '' `` superior race '' '' sterilization of mentally ill/deformed '', 
  * the end of the colonial empires, 
  * plastic , jet engines , space program , computers , nuclear energy , commercial airlines and tons of other technological advances will get a lot slower to develop, 
  * the longest time the planet is at peace ( no major wars ), 
  i bet other will have shiton of stuff to add to that list, 
  sure ... it 's your `` roommate '', 
  you should try gothic.call me when you sidestep 10 meters and meet your first pack of wolves . 
  his highness ca n't reply to you now , he is busy with the daily mammaries inspection . 
  depends where you stand.if you are too close to the blast , you are disintegrated instantaneously ( possibly so fast your mind does n't even register the pain ) . further away a super heated shockwave hits you , and depending the distance you are either burned and obliterated by the pressure or just exploded by the pressure.it all depends by what are you made and how further away you are from the blast.that white thing in the gif seems to be ash from burned leaves , not snow.it seems they got evaporated , but the barks of the trees survived in some form . 
  even further away you are either maimed/killed by debris from the weakened shockwave and/or suffer instant third degree burns from the flash by the explosion.finally about a 30 minutes to some hours later , ** highly ** radioactive fallout ( = debris ) falls from the sky , possibly for days.you either die by internal hemorrhaging ( your guts turn to a bloodied slush ) pretty fast , or you somehow survive and die from cancer , possibly leukemia , some years later.and if you somehow survive all that , welcome to a world with no roads , overwhelmed or nonexistent hospitals , electricity , communications , clean water , areas that are so much radiated that are deadly for decades and no police/army to protect you for weeks/months at best , years at worst.and then [ global nuclear winter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_winter#2007_study_on_global_nuclear_war ) comes ... 
  have a good night . 
  i should have added that exept distance , the wield of the weapon plays a very very significant role , along with climate ( if your are down wind , if it rains etc ) and the general topography ( a large mountain would probably shield you from the major problems ) . however he asked specifically for the blastwave , and i believe if you were so close to be in that forest of the gif , you would probably be fucked . 
  edit : i would like to also add that my description mostly fits a global nuclear war , where along with military installations and nuclear silos/airbases , major urban and industrial centers are targeted . 
  if nuclear weapons are used at tactical level ( denying area of operations , against massed enemy forces in sparsely populated areas , high altitude air bursts for emp damage ) there were theories that m.a.d. 
  was not assured.however if a single bomb was fired and the nuclear taboo broken , escalation with everyone firing is guaranteed by some.everyone should pray every night we never test this . 
  what this thread needs is / u/unidan to explain what species of spider is that.and we find that it is an extra rare unique one worth millions for its discovery . 
  the problem with domesticating wild animals is not so much their daily behavior , but how can they co-exist with humans for generations for a domesticated breed to appear.if you took a bob cat liter or a grizzly bear cub and raised them , they would be far more docile than their wild counterparts.but are they easy to breed for specific jobs like wolves where?are they easy to reproduce and feed with human food scraps , like pigs , cats and dogs?are they social and obedient animals or even better trainable , or are they going to maul your neighbor because he looked you funny and their protection instinct kicked in?having a `` pet '' bear is quite easier than having a domesticated bear . 
  uhmm thats pretty natural you know.most meat is full of `` water '' . 
  hands down the [ black dahlia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_black_dahlia_\\ ( film \\ ) ) . other movies are so bad they are good.some others are so bad they become infamous.this one was just fucking boring.its the only film i fell asleep in the goddamn cinema . 
  key word here is `` investigated '' . 
  considering this is the first time ever we see boba fett and kashyyyk , its pretty much `` canon '' . 
  just ... j [ ust do n't . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a5t5_o8hda ), 
  it has already happened on the old series.the premise of `` regeneration '' was a cop out itself from the beginning , so they can change actors without canceling the show/looking weird.so they are getting mad for coping out a cop out . 
  i. ... i do n't remember ... fuck i am scared . 
  someone is probably doing that with your comment right now . 
  [ r/peoplejerkingofftopickmanscomment ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohg5sjyrha0 ) . yes it exists . 
  ** nsfw !, 
  i am greek and he has no fucking idea what he is talking about ( not that you needed my observation ) . i cringed so hard when he spew random greek stuff my face muscles contracted . 
  source : i am eating souvlaki now . 
  however , you can make the reddit ** you ** want.i have n't seen advice animals , old cringe memes ever will i am using the site , and mostly avoided `` le reddit armie '' idiots.i subscribed to / r/pcmasterrace lately so i think i will get some shrapnel from there . 
  ahh yes , what really really bothers me in reddit is the presumption that everyone here is a from the us * . hopefully this will decline as the popularity of the website rises . 
  * i know the majority of the users are american , but is kinda tasteless to presume such in a comment , and outright rude to type a reddit title as such `` we have been deceived!sen.u.s . 
  john mcrandom name of ny have deceived us '' on friggin / r/worldnews . 
  you must also consider time.if king , who had published so many books so soon is also the other two , he must be writing while he is sleeping.so i have two crazy conspiracy theories to add to yours.either :, 
  a ) king never got over his addiction , and he is writing under a heavy cocaine use , typing 20h per day ... . or ( dun dun ), 
  b ) most of his novels are written by ghost writers ( backman/kootz are simply aliases so he and his company can corner the horror book market ) , and richard bachman was just another ghost writer that used kings resources to publish his own novels , but king got the rights for the books back ( and a nda out of the unlucky writer ) when he find out . 
  i feel that most of the time , that 's the point . 
  i think the best way to do is the eve online way aka let the players create their own game . 
  eve is extremely boring to play alone , because most activities are repetitive.but the freedom that the game gives you when you have a couple of buddies are unlimited ( traders?check.pirates?check , mercs ? 
  check .
