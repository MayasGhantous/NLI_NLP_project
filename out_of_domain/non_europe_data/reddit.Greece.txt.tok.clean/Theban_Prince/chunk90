  germany pumped 150 billion euros into greece in the last years . 
  and now greece wants more because nazis . 
  sorry , no . 
  the reparations where not paid fully and greece was claiming that before the crisis . 
  the last agreement was signed in the oh so old 1990 by the great powers , without the consent of greece , a sovereign nation . 
   germany pumped 150 billion euros into greece in the last years, 
  `` on 2 may 2010 , the eurogroup agreed to provide bilateral loans pooled by the european commission . . '', 
  the ** eu ** provided ** loans ** to be repayed . 
  that never reached the greeks because the where immediately went to the european banks and investors . 
  and the sweet spot of your misinformation ? 
  [ italy and bulgaria did indeed paid their reparations to greece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_reparations#world_war_ii_italy ) . 
  in conclusion , is by law germany obliged to pay , as turkey is ? 
  i hope you like getting worms borrowing in your brain while they destroy you with horrific hallucinations . 
  also , the most obvious one . 
  there has to be a * first * civilization . 
  nothing is proven we are not that . 
  or that we simply appeared in the butthole area of the universe and civilizations thrive outside our `` visual '' range . 
  what if we are like a small undiscovered amazonian village that they believe are the only humans on the planet , yet london with 20mil buzzing people is in the same rock ? 
   admitting they did it , however , would probably be best for everyone . 
  how ? 
  delicious irony . 
  steam pushing me back where it found me . 
  you actually gave me a distinct reason to think about . 
  i can see people wanting this not for reparations , but as move of goodwill from turkey as a state . 
  while i think it is naive to believe it will stay at just that , if turkey ever admits it , i understand why at present , people would support it . 
  thank you . 
  it was bugging me for days now . 
  donating to people that do good work after you have tried their creation . 
  not donating to shitty mods . 
  most of the mod devs post their threads thought the forums either for patching , updating or troubleshooting and they usually do a pretty good job for that . 
  this is considered part of the `` product '' adn you cant pirate that . 
  best `` drm '' i have seen . 
  a lot of modders are also in uproar . 
  do they count ? 
  its the best way . 
  just strap some rockets in a big enough rock and set it go . 
  if you set it properly there is very few things we can do to stop it , if any . 
  no , not even nuclear , since you need a huge explosion to give enough energy to the fragments to escape each others gravity pull , otherwise they will simply clump together again to a new ( and probably pissed ) rock . 
  his evil plan was the most realistic i have seen in a movie . 
  and he even used a city for it so civilians will work as a meat shield !, 
  i have played ultima i -  iv -  v -  vi and a bit of vii . 
  the last four back to back . 
  believe me the interface sucks big time . 
  its halfway between the tile based system that the previous used and the top down the vii championed . 
  so you pretty much have the teenage years of ultima there . 
  but i suggest you keep trying the original . 
  just be warned . 
  a very vital suggestion , before you go to the last part of the game you need all items , and some are really well hidden . 
  you can literally get stuck on the final screen of the game before ending . 
  and do not even think to go without at least 1 spell caster capable of casting exit and resurrection . 
  particularly exit , because the last dungeon has no exit , so the only way out if you find yourself too weak/without all the necessary items is dying . 
  ( exit or teleport , do n't remember specifically the spell that gets you out ), 
  how much does it cost ? 
  yeah that we support * donations * for good content . 
  as i said , its halfway between the tile based system and the top down view . 
  its clunky since the point and click system is not that well integrated as it is in vii . 
  the area that you can see around you is restricted , so you will find yourself a lot of times getting hit by an enemy outside your viewing range . 
  the inventory has an upper limit of items , and if you exceed it you can get issues like lost items or you can accidentally duplicate them if you drop them on the ground . 
  mind you , except the inventory limit issue , all others happened to me on a single walk through . 
  and more . . 
  i have finished the game , so do n't worry . 
  i am just saying that compared to other ultima games it does n't feel as polished . 
   with a daughter , who turns out to be amy . 
  that after injured , regenerates into the first doctor, 
  ad hominem reasoning is ** not always fallacious ** , for example , when it relates to the credibility of statements of fact, 
   modders should be able to get paid for their hard work . 
  [ volunteering ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volunteering ) is generally considered an altruistic activity and is intended to promote goodness or improve human quality of life . 
  in return , this activity can produce a feeling of self-worth and respect . 
  there is no financial gain involved for the individual . 
  ** volunteering is also renowned for skill development , socialization , and fun . 
   so every modder has to be a volunteer to the community ? 
  as it worked for 25 + years ? 
   if someone works hard on something great like a total conversion and they feel like they should get paid for it , they should have the choice . 
  you mean all those mods that got adopted by valve , paradox and other companies , passed through a proper development cycle and qa and actually became a finished product worthy of purchase ? 
  and other than cold and wet , i did n't see any other major mod jumping on the profit wagon.i wonder why . . 
   dae mods were free is not a valid excuse , and the community is not there to just work for you all out of the goodness of their hearts . 
  dude what are you talking about ? 
  there are dozens of hard working activities wayyy worse than modding that are not paid , yet people do them `` out of the goodness of their hearts '' to offer to their community . 
   if instead we had time limited skill training boosters that survived podding , that would solve the issue . 
  ohhh sounds tasty . 
  just a general reply :, 
  losing your virginity is ** vastly ** overrated . 
  pop culture tends to make it a huge deal ( american pie ) . 
  its a natural process most people do n't even care about . 
  nobody will ask you `` how was your first time '' neither will he judge you based on your reply/performance . 
  your sexual life is not a contest to score points . 
  what makes sex good or bad is the * quality * of the other person you are with , not his/her experience compared to you . 
  if they are bad match , sex * will * be awful even if it is your 1000th time . 
   that does n't mean that anyone who works hard on something has to give it out for free because the community says so . 
  the community equal the `` clients '' . 
  since the `` clients '' are not only disinterested , but outright hostile the option is simply not there . 
  and this is something people know * before * deciding to create mods . 
  nobody forces them to to that `` hard work '' . 
   seems like unemployment and lower living standards would cause a lot of social strife as well . 
  greece is a safe . 
  watch for typical stuff like pickpockets in tourist areas and public transports , or taxi drivers scumming you . 
  if there are demonstrations they are focused on the center of athens around syntagma square.riots are rare . 
  the anglo-saxons arrived during the 5th century while the scandinavians arrived during the 9th century , almost 400 years later . 
  by then the anglo-saxons and their neighbors have being co-existing for centuries , establishing the name `` england '' . 
  the scandinavians not only came a lot later , but their independent fiefs survived from 865 to 927 , only 62 years .
