  it has 0 meaning in greek . 
  * kyrios * can mean lord but that is the same with * archon * , the root of - archy . 
  so it sounds as * lordlordship * in greek . 
  edit : i forgot my mother language . 
  it means `` domination '' . 
  downvoted myself for my brain fart . 
  well shit , ofcourse . 
  the greeklish throwed me off . 
  however , why use the greek form instead of the appropriate translation `` domination '' ? 
  it still does n't make sense in context . 
  the jutes where neighbors of the angles and the saxons in the mainland . 
  as far as i know they had similar culture so why call them `` scandinavians '' compared with the other two groups ? 
  also he specifically asks about norwegian and danish * viking * groups . 
  the viking term is used for the raid groups originating from scandinavia during from the 700 's to roughly the 1000s . 
  the greeks and romans called it britannia . 
  * short * humanoids that take advantage of the dumb pathfinding of the enemy ( it walks into the path without thought ) to destroy it using a contraption involving a bridge , a lever and magma . 
  its definitely df, 
  that doesnt mean it can be both at the same time . 
  say what you want about cameras all around and society turning into a `` big brother '' , but have been used for good numerous times . . 
  they are also about 5m in size . . 
  both the bicycle part and the food come from the same root word so they should be pronounced the same . 
  gyroscope should be pronounced `` yeeroscope '' for example . 
  every bot on reddit is you . 
  folding a square piece of paper in half , more than 8 times . 
  lets say the pentagons survives ... then what ? 
  you will have mass starvation , no medicine for even basic illnesses , no police , no firefighters . . 
  it would be as damaging as a global nuclear war in the long run . 
  some might in their homes , but we are talking about 320mil people only in the us . 
  how are you going to mass produce them ? 
  how are you going to distribute them ? 
  no factories or cars !, 
  and that 's only for antibiotics , what about complex medical operations ? 
  even if you have a running hospital , mass produced items like gloves or syringes will be out very fast . 
  vaccines will be gone , the water will be contaminated ( hello cholera ! ), 
  and every death will create more problems with diseases spreading from the masses of dead bodies . 
  `` hey mom , where is my very essential report that it took a month to create ? '', 
  '' i put it in the trash can , is n't it funny ? 
  hahaha . . '', 
  `` i took out the trash yesterday . . '', 
  trains and ships would also be fried . 
  * everything * electronic will be fried . 
  just imagine a world where the technology we have the last 200 years is instantly gone . 
  umm how many steam trains exist right now ? 
  and how are you going to move the huge amount of coal that you desperately need in a few weeks ? 
  what about the lack of refueling stations for coal and water midpoint ? 
   also , we would all be dead if it 's everything electronic . 
  how so ? 
  while i do n't have the necessary knowledge to exactly pinpoint the difference , a car battery is a lot more powerful than the really really tiny sparks between neurons . 
  for police no dispatch , no cars , no phone to report crimes . 
  factories and trucks delivering spare parts , guns and ammunition are done for . 
  for firefighters , no cars , no dispatch , no phone to report fires , and most water pumping stations are out . 
  where is the hyperbole ? 
  you are vastly underestimating the problem . 
  this is [ nasa about the 1859 ] ( http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/06may_carringtonflare/ ) flare . 
  in 1989 , a much weaker flare created issues with radios , navigation and blowed up power transformers . 
  the 1859 flare was much much greater . 
  and you forget the interconnection of modern world . 
  a lot of products like medicines or tools are either imported or created with imported material . 
  how police is going to work without radio and telephones in global scale ? 
  firefighter and hospitals ? 
  how is gas going to be produced and transported in the millions of tons we need right now ? 
  and you are going to have a famine due to agriculture production and distribution , taking out more essential people like doctors/police officers etc. 
  it will not bee the end of the world , but it will kill millions and get us back for at least 100 years . 
  but its ok , becasue humanity will `` survive '' . 
  who is going to make more ammo after you run out ? 
  the power grid might take months to get repaired . 
  and who is going to get you gas for your police car ? 
  tires ? 
  you also have no radio to contact other units to get the bad guys . . 
   your car will still work if it has fuel . 
  and how will i get more fuel ? 
  do refineries and ports have independent shielded power stations that i do n't know off ? 
  to combine other answers to one and add some more info , to create these kinds of ships we will mine the asteroid hollow for what is worth , and keep the outer layer as a protection from dangerous [ cosmic rays ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmic_ray ) . 
  as said , i played half of iv ( second run ) v and vi back to back , i got burned out , and i wanted to play vii with a full mind to fully enjoy it .

  `` rub it in khaleesi , i will stil be here waiting '', 
  greek here , the local banks totally copied the american system and gave loans by the dozen . 
  at 2008 everything as expected crashes and now the greek banks are on the verge of collapse . 
  * the greek goverment * injects about 50 billions to save them turning a private debt into public . 
  just 1 year later the greek public debt is considered unsustainable and we get the imf and eu trying to cut the public spending while injecting more money to the private sector ( incuding banks ) . 
  in the middle of it eu media go on a frenzy calling the greek citizens `` lazy southerners that spent the german money on womens and booze '' . 
  the * greek goverment * supports this viewpoint and accepts every ultimatum the eu sets . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100611145604/harrypotter/images/d/d2/ara.jpg ) from harry potter .

  they had absolutely not safe guards for a case like this . 
  they danced with the public debt for years in the edge ( and sometimes going over but using us companies to hide it ) . 
  if my house is broken in it is out of my control , but selling my doors , locks and insurance money for booze is n't going to make the situation better .

  you cant be an ** a ** theist when you know gods do exist . 
  he was an anti-theist that combined both agendas , on one hand to starve the chaos gods while simultaneously making humanity the supreme race in the universe . 
  you ca n't have one without the other ( from his viewpoint ) . 
  where have you heard these vile heresies ( sources please ), 
  you can duel the leader of an army and kill/imprison him , so there is the alternative . 
  but your responses have to be at least somewhat mentioned n source material , even if it is stretched to their limits .
