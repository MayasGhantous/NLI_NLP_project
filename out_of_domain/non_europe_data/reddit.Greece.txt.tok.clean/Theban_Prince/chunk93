  can you please provide time period sources because i am confused ? 
  new age mumbo jumbo that piggybacked on ender 's game . 
  i read enders game at 27 . 
  then the rest of the series . 
  starting from genocide , they became forgettable , and ender 's game is the best fo the series . 
  even if the legal loopholes they try to use really existed , someone must inform them about the difference of `` de jure '' and `` de facto '' . 
  if a strong entity like a nation 's government wants to fuck you up , some papers aint gon na help you . 
  yes because you can be `` special '' without being successful in the stereotypical way ( great career , great looking so , traveled the world , etc ) . 
  you can be successful , `` special '' , if you find what makes you happy and pursuit it , if it is athletics or painting or woodworking . 
  children do not treat others like this ( lack off empathy as you said ) so reinforcing that you can be an individual ( special ) without strictly conforming to the other children preconceptions will ease up the stress of the kid . 
  dude ... 
  why does germany use that retarded chicken for coa ? 
  contrast and compare fabulous [ german imperial eagle . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_germany#/media/file:wappen_deutsches_reich_-_reichsadler_1889.svg ), 
  interesting article , but absolutely no sources provided for further reading . 
  so they had a `` no surrender '' rule , yet they surrendered when overwhelming force was presented without a single enemy soldier in the islands . 
  i wonder if the soviet union entering the war against japan had nothing to do with it . 
  from the site sidebar :, 
  `` was the rape of german women in 1945 justified in anyway ? '', 
  `` have historians under-emphasized russia 's role in defeating nazi germany ? '', 
  `` german soldiers during ww2 : best fighters in history ? '', 
  `` waffen ss : great warriors ? 
  or mad fanatics ? '', 
  `` who were the toughest soldiers during ww2 ? '', 
  `` did the americans and british act as brutally as the germans and japanese during ww2 ? '', 
  the sources provided for the second article is [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=utf8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3a283155%2cp_27%3ak.%20w.%20hammerstein ) from k.w hammerstein , giles macdonogh , a historical * writer * that his greatest achievement was getting a [ reward from a whiskey company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giles_macdonogh ) but most essentially , a lot of proof comes from this '' [ article ] ( http://www.thebirdman.org/index/others/others-doc-history/+doc-history-ww2period/alliedatrocitiesinww2-michaelwalsh.html ) '' by `` analyst '' michael walsh ( further info unknown ) published on the website of , [ john `` birdman '' bryant ] ( http://www.thebirdman.org/ ) the self proclaimed ** `` internet 's premier website of,

  while i am sure during a war , brutality exists from both sides , and not * all * allied soldiers might be the saints hollywood promotes , unverified witnesses and white power analysts can hardly be used to prove that '' * the only difference ( between german death camps and allied contraction camps ) i can see ... is that here they are still breathing * .

  it took longer than expected . 
  while the japanese surely surrender due to the overwhelming force of the a-bomb ( and the false information that the us had 100 of them , not that it mattered ) are you telling me the us did n't wished to end the war before japan was invaded by the soviets that would lead into a partition like the german one ? 
  why my discussion about the a-bomb a and top level strategy has to be a overall attack to us soldiers like your grandfather ? 
  i never said `` americans are evul hur dur '' . 
  as you said the us was practically unscathed at this point , the soviets where about to enter the war and japan was cutoff from all essential recourses without their asia conquests ( the reason they attacked in the first place ) . 
  while you accuse me of alternate history , you are the one that takes the worst possible scenario the us had planned for as a sure alternative to push that the bombings where the only option . 
  for you its either the bomb or 1mil purple hearts . 
  for me is the belief that we can study the situation now , see if there was the possibility of other outcomes ( that may or may not been apparent at the time ) and maybe help us choose wisely if another such decision presents it self in the future . 
  and while i know about belgium , i also know that in my home country , greece , the us supported far right elements and german colabolators , perpetuating a civil war more destructive than ww2 and 7 years of dictatorship during the 70s . 
  there is no black and white in war , at best is grey to black . 
  as i said the allies were n't the white knights the media presents with a lot of documented cases ( dresden , hiroshima , the order to paratroopers in normandy not to take prisoners ) . 
  just do n't go all the way to the other side . 
  what is it today with sources ? 
  who is this '' intelligent , well-informed japanese army officer '' ? 
  you are basing this on an unnamed soldier of indeterminate position and rank . 
  like the japanese believed the us had 100 atomic bombs based on the statement of a us soldier ? 
   you all would rather sympathize with the nazis and the japanese just so long as it perpetuates the anti-american circle jerk . 
  completely disgusting and immoral . 
  you should all be ashamed of yourselves . 
  i hope for all of your sakes that it 's just a sheer lack of historical ignorance that is causing you to downvote me into oblivion for stating the obvious facts , because the alternative requires you to sympathize with the people who brought the world the rape of nanking and the holocaust . 
  i do n't think your down votes comes from nazi sympathizers or japanese lovers . 
  i think that the down votes come from your unquestioning belief that the bombing of thousands of civilians was absolutely necessary and your stubbornly refuse to even discuss it . 
  this could stop wars ( forget oil and coal ! ), 
  famine ( underground farms with electrical lights ! ), 
  global warming ( tesla would soil their pants ) and ultimately colonize the solar system and beyond in a decade . 
  but fuck this , i need to play candy crush . 
  the present day macedonians are not the same with the ancient macedonians . 
  its like confusing `` native americans '' with `` americans '', 
  so the president of the united states of america , the leader of the strongest nation of this planet , who farts , and people analyze the content to try and catch a glimpse to the intentions of the government would give even the slightest chance of spotlight to conspiratards ? 
  i had the same problem , but i found a solution . 
  when you hit the sweet spot between finally being number 1 and invincible ( for example , if france and hre team up , you might actually lose ) i go all us politics , meaning i start painting the map with other nations on my whim by manipulating others instead of outright conquering , like supporting claimants to thrones , defending a small christian nation etc etc. 
  for example , in my last game i reconquered the whole iberia from andalusia ( and then released leon , portugal and aragon and kept nothing ) , helped my greek catholic mistress from apulia to reclaim constantinople from the fallen byzantines turned muslims and establish the latin empire etc etc. 
  for added experience use the console ( you have already won the game , so why not go full sandbox ) , because the ai is stupid . 
  by the time he had fully upgraded everything they have started generating the money back .

  the `` everlasting hamburger '' is a hoax/urban myth and has being [ debunked ] ( https://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/the-myth-of-the-non-decomposing-mcdonalds-hamburger/ ) .
