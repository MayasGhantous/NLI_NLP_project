  its on the article you posted . 
  you can take liberland with a pointy stick and a box of jelly beans . . 
  i really love that you keep posting the bands yet you cant read them . 
  apparently a us citizen reading google is so sure he is right * more than someone who used to live there . 
  its not simply adressed , why walter white as a human being does what he does is the main question of the show !, 
  and it was supposed to be grating . 
  so the show worked for you by playing with your feelings , but if you dont like this kind of themes that is an entirely different matter . 
  but just a suggestion , until you watch * all * the episodes your opinion about the quality of the show doesnt hold a lot of weight . 
  because you are judging a book from its cover . 
  cousins have no issues with inbreeding . 
  heck even siblings have relative minor chances of something going wrong . 
  but if it happens in more than one generation ... 
  not if [ she ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/13/article-2060988-0223b7bd0000044d-479_468x334.jpg ) crawls in you open mouth while you sleeping . . 
  my bad . 
  i actually agree with him . 
  seriously unless someone knows what exactly happened this is pretty scary . 
  just because two cops in previous videos broke windows in rightfull situations this doesnt mean every cop that does it has a valid reason . 
  seriously the fermi paradox and its ofshoots its a bunch of new age , humanocentric horseshit . 
  it assumes that we are able to explore and receive information from the majority of the * entire * universe and we found it empty , when we can more probably assume we exist on a relatively empty area of space and/or we ca n't yet explore areas outside our solar system . 
  its like an undiscovered tribal village in the middle of the amazon believing earth is devoid of life simply because they do n't have a tv to watch new york and its 20 mil inhabitants . 
  found tied with a white string on a tree off the path ( about 20m/60ft ) in a park in belgium . 
  roughly the size of a post it note . 
  they must be totally four , with three still tied up and a fourth on found on the forest floor next to the tree . 
  possible prayer paraphernalia of asian origins ? 
  i knew i have seen something like that . 
  can you provide more info on why they where there ? 
  assumptions are kinda dangerous in this case . 
  and while definitely spreading the `` sovereign citizen '' bullshit are mostly centered around the us . 
  this could tottally be a cop overreacting . 
  as others said most nations flags use similar colors : blue red white . 
  in a static map you need minimal 4 colours to keep each nation clear , but on a dynamic map its wayy harder . 
  they probably check what colors are the closer nations in the region and pick one to contrast with them . 
  and you can easily change it on the text files of the game . 
  just be happy with your new color and that you avoided the fleshy pink of greece . 
  you comment absolutely makes no sense . 
  so wait , she asked 2 days of leave to go to an interview for a new job and she told that to her current employers ? 
  * mortal * weapons . 
  the balrog 's weapons are either made of fire or probably forged in morgoth 's domain . 
  they are magical . 
  and it is pretty weird that someone downvoted you for a pretty normal discussion . 
  upvoted for compensantion !, 
  is the eagles issue still discussed ? 
  did people missed the part where the fellowship was supposed to be moving covertly ? 
  riding on huge eagles in plain sight is not covertly people !, 
  so your `` safe '' spot was inside the area owned be a private for profit company , that sells your `` safe '' spot creations and when you start shitting all over the place they kick you out . 
  and your are surprised ? 
  * too * modern for my tastes for a ww2 game . . but perfect for a cold war one . . 
  its implied he is insane due to onbreeding so that would n't help much . . 
  melkor decided to use his free will from day 0 ( literally ) again and again and we should feel bad about him getting wrecked after multiple chances ( and an official pardon ) to stop ? 
  the tower wouldnt shoot them down , the ringwraiths with they dragon things would , especially so close to their master . 
  and even if they somehow outrunned them/defeated them , to drop the ring they would either have to land while the whole mordor was now after them or drop it from high up on the move , and hope it didnt land outside the lava and delivered into sauron 's hands like a middle earth dhl . 
  the [ trojan war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trojan_war ) . 
  popularly believed to be either a total fabrication or at least an amalgam of local histories and myths passed through oral tradition until in the 1860s , archaelogists discovered an ancient city pretty much where it was supposed to be , and proof that the city was destroyed by a great fire rougly close to the age the poems describe . 
  it is believed this is city and its fate is what inspired the trojan war tradition . 
  yes but why feel bad at all . 
  all the other ainur sung along with eru and helped him shape arda . 
  melkor fucked this up because he was selfish . 
  like the spoiled kid that busts a birthday party because it is not its own . 
  the turkish people are predominaly muslim . 
  the state and its laws is secular . 
  there is a difference there . 
  ~ ~ shots ~ ~ longbows fired !, 
  poor * disabled * bots . 
  shhh . . you will scare them away . 
  redditors are jumpy creatures ... 
  everyone is missing the point . 
  gandalf ** specifically ** helped the dwarves hoping they are going to take care of the dragon , mostly based on his fears that sauron wasnt not quite dead yet and if the dragon survived , at best the dwarves would be weak ( without a restored erebor ) and the elves would stood alone against sauron 's armies pushing north or worst case , the dragon takes active part in the war of the ring , and the north is a charred wasteland . 
  these fears are directly stated from gandalf , about the fate of middle earth if smaug still lived . 
  both points are outright stated in the additional material of lord of the rings . 
  he essentially sent a `` commando raid '' to take out the dragon while he was chilling . 
  he even sent bilbo because of the hobbit 's inherent ability to sneak , and their usually level headed soul to help and counter the dwarves . 
  there is actually a subquest in new vegas dealing with this and how a survived bottling machine is essentially a money printing press . 
  the dragon * breached * and burned the defences of a * dwarven kingdom * , defences specifically built not to be breached by people who excell on that stuff . 
  if it was that easy , gandalf would have done this for decades or even the dwarves themselves . 
  the dragon would burn the dwarven army into a crisp , and the remaining armies . 
  i really find so much tasty when atheists call out believers becasue their beliefs is not as pure as the scriptures say . 
  he does preset the greek word in its correct form . 
  to make it more understandable , lets say the prophets created a legal contract that at certain point of time in the future thing will happen . 
  jesus say that he will not * rip * the contract into pieces , but he will fulfill it himself , and thus the contract is over . 
  if you are referring hades , it was far from fire and brimstone . 
  most depictions of hell comes from dante 's divine comedy . 
  pretty much . 
  or did you missed the point of christ sacrificing himself so he can wash all out sins off and start anew , and [ getting adam and even from hades to paradise ] ( https://gabrielsmessage.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/icon_resurrection4.jpg?w=660 ) ? . 
  in my church ( orthodox ) we learn the ot stuff mostly as a `` how we got here '' story . 
   except the bits they want to keep from the the ot , like the 10 commandments and creation and stuff , that stuff we like so we 're keeping it . 
  nobody follows the ot expect zealots , and zealots are not exclusive into christianity , or hell even religion . 
  i do n't know how is it it in us , but in europe if you claim those creationist nonsense or leviticus in public everyone will laugh with you , christian or not . 
  it really feel ironic when atheists focus on the extremists and ignore the gargantuan majority . 
  do you think the lgbt rights , the abortion rights , laws allowing birth control ways to constructed , stem cell researched are only supported and voted by atheists , or that the only christians are the american offshoots that where considered over-conservative even in the 17th-19th centuries and that is the reason they move to the future states ? 
  lets say what you claim is true ( it isnt , old testament means literally old contract , jesus `` signed '' a new one with humans ) . 
  the problem is with christians in general , or with assholes that cherry pick passages to oppress people , and would probably be assholes despite their believes ? 
  i think you are confusing the spear like the hoplite 's [ dory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dory_%28spear%29 ) with the [ javelin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javelin#ancient_greece ) . 
  a spear like the dory , suitable on a pitched battle , had a long and heavy pole ,2.5 m-3m ( 10ft ) . 
  it was neither light nor fast , and you would be unable to parry or throw it in great effect ( and what happens if you missed ? ) . 
  this is why spearmen where used in tight formations like the [ phalanx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phalanx ) since the most effective motion was thrusting in front . 
  a javelin on the other hand was considerably lighter and shorter since it was supposed to be thrown , however this meant that it could easily break parrying against a metal weapon ( you vastly underestimate how hard a bar of metal can hit with the full force of a muscular man ) , and it did n't packed the same punch versus armor . 
  for how different the two weapons are in this a [ photo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spear#/media/file:a_spear_and_a_series_of_javelins..png ) , the first is a spear and thew other three are javelins . 
  notice that even the biggest javelin is 2/3 the length and width of a spear . 
  in the end , while humans certainly tried to create a jack-of-all trades weapon , from the german [ zweih\u00e4nder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=zweih%c3%a4nder ) ( swords so long they could be used essentially as spears ) to [ halberds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halberd ) ( spears mated with axes ) no weapon dominated over the others in * every * possible situation . 
  this is the reason you will have difficulty finding an army in history with only one type of weapon carried by its soldiers .
