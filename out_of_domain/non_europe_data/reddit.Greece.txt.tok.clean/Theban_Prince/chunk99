  . . yes . 
  a faded spain . 
  i wouldmt want to go against them at the peak of their empire . . 
  well the thing is that the us cant control other countries , it tried but failed . 
  since korea they went guns a-blazing and either failed or created something worse ( isis ) . 
  ** might ** is not just the army , but diplomacy also , the whole `` carrot and the stick '' scheme . 
  libertarians usually have the hard on only for the stick . 
  tl ; dr when the valar get pissed , continents sink . 
  you mean the guy did the same thing again and again and again . . waiting a different outcome ? 
  ... have you ever heard the definition of insanity ? 
  i give it 6 months . . 
  edit : just check their [ website ] ( http://www.civilizationonline.com/ ) and that totally rad cleopatra-san ... 
  ... [ so hard ] ( https://youtu.be/ot8afh9nmuo?t=38s ), 
  i understand what you are saying and i feel bad for everyone . 
  the officer had to use lethal force , but from a misunderstanding , internet conspiracy wackos and his own great stupidity on handling a very serious situation , a 17 year old lost his life . 
  i hope you never see braveheart . . 
  however he * specifically * says he stopped other cars for the same reason before the incident , so after the first ( at least ) two cars i think he should got the idea of what is going on . 
  you will find his story hilarious if you are a got watcher . . 
  so you are telling me that after mastering the use of weapons , they are also masters of disguise ? 
  this is it people , pack it up , the time of mammals is * over * . 
  you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the * rich * villain . 
  greece has the same situation with `` taxi licences '' costing 100k + euros . . 
  they are the literal embodiments of chaos . 
  i think it is essentially impossible to do so . 
  its like wondering why fish do n't believe in themselves into walking into land . 
   its like wondering why fish do n't believe in themselves into walking into land . 
  i like it that we both used sea examples . 
  cheats . 
  / drops mic, 
  to post einai video me to xoro tou zalogou . 
  pio arthro re mapa ? 
   exactly . 
  he was just trying to fuck with me , and he did . 
   found half a gram of weed, 
  sooo ... you where afraid he will plant drugs on top of your drugs or something ? 
  so in the end you indeed left the scene , the cop did not plant anything and you got charged for obstruction of justice for no reason at all . 
  smart plan . 
  so they are the demon spawn of beanie babies and disc-locked dlc . . 
  that cave in the comic should had fire and brimstone . 
  that is pure undiluted ** evil ** . 
  the dog did not find anything ... but the officer did so what is your point ? 
  that one drug busting tool ( the dog ) they used was ineffective ? 
  also those that decide if you deserve a conviction or not are the * court * , not the police officers . 
  seriously dude , you making sense only in your head , i feel like i am talking to [ this guy ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1362004/images/o-badger-facebook.jpg ) . 
  i miss some huge ass dungeons in new rpg like the original diablo or ultima abyss . 
  the claustrophobic feeling of going deeper and deeper with more dangerous foes and darkness . 
  only blackreach came close in skyrim . 
  its not only time and money , but gameplay reasons also . 
  what you get on games is the `` theme park '' version of something . 
  you have to see every different aspect of the game . 
  if megaton was like a small town of thousands , you would either have a lot of gameplay hours spent there ( player would eventually get bored if they had to spent 150 hours only in megaton ) or have it empty and use resources just for what is essentially props . 
  not op but yes . 
  maybe they are planning to secede again ? 
   that is unlikely to be the case . 
  why ? 
  care to post some examples ? 
  dont go into those ferns ... you are going to awake them !, 
  for immigrants in general :, 
  a ) low entry point : the food industry is one of the easiest to get into as a new guy in a country , particularly if the business you start is not of the high-end class . 
  you do n't need exquisite formal education ( hell even basic knowledge of the local language is ok ) to run a gyros or taco restaurant . 
  b ) easy product to sell : the restaurants have the advantage that you can use something unique you have and sell it easy : exotic food choices . 
  a greek construction worker is the same as an irish or italian or american . 
  the greek food however is generally unique and something that can be very easily marketed and sold to foreigners . 
  for greeks in particular :, 
  greece has a big hospitality industry that obviously includes restaurants . 
  we have a lot of diners in other countries because we * also * have a lot of diners in greece . 
  i 'm loading my save just to see what the response is to this . 
  someone remembered his ' 1984 ' apparently . 
  i read that the european countries can ask for concessions of public property through the eu legal framework if greece defaults , forcing greece to `` voluntary '' leave the eu . 
  tsipras was n't on government \u03c4he last 5 years . 
  the debt is unsustainable either way . 
  its the greek t. its little hat was confiscated by the eu to pay debts . 
  \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 [ isandlwana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_isandlwana ) . 
  this is hilarious in so many levels . 
  personally , getting killed by space debris would be ok . you can die from an aneurysm while you shitting or a empty husk in your 100s alone in a bed ( with all your friends , and immediate family probably already dead ) . 
  getting killed by humanity 's try to reach the cosmos is pretty damn fine . 
  edit : did you a-holes just down voted how ** i ** wish to die ? 
  really ? 
  violence because we are out of schengen ? 
  man we do love our cacations in frankfurt . . 
  a ) greece is not out of the euro ... yet, 
  b ) prices will be cheap , true , but not * that * cheap, 
  c ) you cant buy houses without legal contracts and proof of payment . 
  since technically the euro will not be legal anymore , you will have to turn it into the new greek coin ... meaning you have to pay exchange rates and taxes to the greek government . 
   no , violence because people ca n't access their money . 
  that is already happening for the last two days and there is no violence . 
  worst case we switch to drachma after a few weeks and the money are available again . 
  a violent demonstration in the center of athens is hardly a civil war , is it ? 
  you can literally have a drink a few roads further and you will have no idea what is happening . . 
  all i hear is no also . 
  while it is not statistically correct , when you see 20 + people * calling for secession from the eu , something you would imagine seeing 5 years , heck even 3 months ago , it is worth of discussion . 
  ** and they are not the usual suspects , kke voters , syriza etc *, 
  yes means at least some meetings with the europeans , and possibly implementation of the measures ( that might be even harsher ) . 
  no means de facto out of the euro , default and from there we are sailing in unknown waters ... * nobody * knows because it never happened anything like this before , a country switching from a strong currency to a weaker . 
   plus , if the person is n't living in greece and ca n't monitor the property , they may come back to a house ... or a pile of rubble . 
  how is that possible without literally war ? 
  there are mods out there that cut the temple part all together . 
  since it is not an integral part of that game and unreasonably hard ( plus railroady as hell ) , i suggest you do that if you get too frustrated . 
  please point where a * house * has been destroyed in athens riots please . 
  so you are making crazy assumptions ...
