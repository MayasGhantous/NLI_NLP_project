  although that would have been more dramatic imo .

  you are now a mod of r/ladara, 
  the last one would be [ cyprus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/coat_of_arms_of_cyprus.svg/2000px-coat_of_arms_of_cyprus.svg.png ) . 
  correct . 
  similarly , the olive branches in the greek coat of arms were n't included as they are not in the actual shield .

  i tried but then thought if it really were the eu they would have it written 26 times in all languages or something ...

  omfg the last scene !, 
  also sorry to the person that wanted to post this for karma !, 
  maybe even a remake of the each of the games in the trilogy in dd and sj graphics facing right , then remake of apollo justice again in dd and sj graphics facing left to match the second trilogy . 
  i would give capcom all my money . 
  basically you 're asking about a voting system that even though is the law of the land , still wo n't be implemented in the next elections , but only in the elections after that , due to how the greek constitution works . 
  and even then there is a slight chance many of the aspects of the electoral system will be changed by the next parliament which will have the chance to repeal it , and which will be a constitutional assembly , which means unlike the one we have now , they will have the power to amend the constitution . 
  it 's complicated . 
  but all of these questions can be answered by looking at their implementation in other countries for now . 
  i personally have no strong feelings either way . 
  i think the [ pizza parliament ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/parliament_of_greece_september_2015.svg/2000px-parliament_of_greece_september_2015.svg.png ) we have today is bad for democracy and this new system will force parties to merge and become bigger blocks , and i think that is a good thing , if it 's ever implemented that is . 
  and have congressional gridlock on top of the ineptitude of our government already ? 
  no fucking thanks . 
  constantine and his house of gl\u00fccksburg were never legitimate to begin with , so it 's not like we really have a monarch alternative . 
  also , greece is n't really a republic , our constitution is more democratic than republican in nature . 
  so saying is a sham o a republic is actually kind of a complement . 
  because republics are kind of dumb . 
  law , is by definition , the will of the majority . 
  even if its not written down , even if there is no government to enforce it , the will of the majority still is law , and that is the case everywhere . 
  republics are a corruption of this fundamental concept . 
  the illusion of democracy , but without the essence of it . 
  any system that prioritizes order over the expression of the peoples will , has failed and will fail . 
  because in the end there will be nothing but resentment for a system which allows the few to rule over the many . 
  democracies were , and are , always the wealthiest shining examples of their time . 
  look at ancient athens , venice , switzerland , always conquered from outside for their riches . 
  republics , even those who started with the best of intentions , always ended up as aristocracies in disguise , always resented by their own citizenry , and always inevitably brought down from within . 
  the more republican a country is , the more damage it does to its own people in the long run . 
  i would much rather live in an authoritarian regime than a republic . 
  it 's better to have a capable dictator , than it is to have the worst of democracy and monarchy in the same system . 
   america is better . 
   i mentioned switzerland . 
  no , it is n't . 
  [ human development index , america ranks 8 , switzerland ranks 3 ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries ), 
  [ gdp per capita , america : 55,836.8 $ , switzerland : 80,214.7 $ ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd ), 
  [ swiss life expectancy : 81.57 , american life expectancy : 79 ] ( http://www.geoba.se/population.php?pc=world&amp;type=15 ), 
  unless you count best by military spending , america is in many aspects actually worse than authoritarian regimes . 
   a republic like singapore ( which is better than swizerland ), 
  it 's not , but anyway ... 
  democracy is like the capitalism of political systems . 
  it works because it is inherent to human nature just like capitalism and its problems are self correcting , just like those of capitalism . 
  it 's not like other political systems does n't work . 
  it 's just that democracy is best , always has been . 
  in fact , capitalism and democracy really go together like peanut butter and jelly . 
  republics ? 
  not so much . 
  when you have to cater to the needs of the minority , you eventually find yourself catering to the lazy , the uneducated , even the enemies of your system , which is sure as hell happening in europe , and in america . 
  that 's what 's keeping down much of the western world . 
  the fact that we are sticking with a failed system of government , just because the romans had it , and you got ta love the romans . 
  few realize that the western roman empire fell because of this system and the eastern roman empire under strong and capable leadership outlived it for a millennium . 
  i stand by my opinion . 
  republics are the worst of both authoritarian and democratic systems . 
  with none of the efficiencies of the former , and none of the self correcting nature of the ladder . 
  as opposed to america who given the chance will all be ayn rands and end all social programs \\ s. 
  lmao . 
  sure in the first years , people will try to get everything possible from the state for less . 
  that what will happen , not just in greece , but everywhere . 
  but it would then be self-corrected over time as people increasingly realize that their voting hurts their own personal interest . 
  and soon enough you have a new switzerland . 
  in fact , that 's the only way you get a switzerland . 
  leave it to ideologue leaders and parties , big business and their lobbyists , and watch as regulation and protectionism and social programs pile up . 
  why are you even here having a conversation with a monkey then ? 
  gtfo . 
  pretty sure he would say the same about huffington post . 
  false equivalency . 
  and i quote :, 
  edit :, 
  greek pokemon fan here . 
  i dont think it will happen . 
  greece gets a lot of shootouts in pokemon already , especially in gens 3 and 4 . 
  the spear pillar and sootopolis city notably . 
  seeing how an acropolis and a greek island already exist in pokemon , unless they rethink these ideas a lot , i do n't think gamefreak would revisit them . 
  the layout of the greek mainland is very weird too . 
  it 's 2 north-south corridors and a northern east-west corridor , with mountains in between . 
  that 's it . 
  unless they involve a lot of island hopping , it 's going to be the most boring and forgettable region yet . 
  mythology-wise , i do n't want to break it to you , but i get the feeling that pokemon will never have western inspiration for its mythology , not to a scale that would justify a whole region , anyway . 
  maybe a pokemon design or trainer , here and there could be greek . 
  and wo n't you look ay that , in sun and noon we got that !, 
  they can pretty much do this wherever . 
  the number one reason i think it will not happen , is that there is just so much more of the world to cover first . 
  for all our mythology and varied geography , greece is a pretty temperate and avarage place . 
  i do n't see them making greece before china , the giannas , australia , germany , russia , and most importantly the uk . 
  and even if they feel the need for a mediterranean region there is always spain and italy which have far better layouts , and are just as varied and interesting .
