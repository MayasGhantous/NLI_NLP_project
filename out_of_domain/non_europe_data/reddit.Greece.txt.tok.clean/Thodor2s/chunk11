  so it 's probably not happening and that 's ok . 
  i am happy enough with the spear pillar and sootopolis anyway . 
  sootopolis was my favorite place in the games before i even realized it was based on my real life homeland .

  sorry for greek .

  in france it 's mandatory to vaccinate your kids though . 
  the president here does nothing . 
  that 's some erdogan tier shit . 
  get used to it . 
  without tolls , there are no roads . 
  it takes extra planning , but [ it 's happening .

  this detailed astonished me . 
  i love it . 
  so you 're calling us all assholes ? 
   you may never unsee this now .

  i am usually super angry about flags like the one on the right . 
  but in this instance i think there is no contest . 
  its simply visually the best out of the bunch . 
  there is something about it that captivates me , too . 
  it 's not simple and it is simple at the same time . 
  holy shit i love this flag !, 
  there are a lot of those here , but you never see them so it 's not a big deal . 
  r/ladara material, 
  we were never asleep to begin with . 
  give us aa amibo already capcom !, 
  context for non-europeans : esc ( the eurovision song contest ) is our version of the hunger games , only it actually happens in real life . 
  after ww2 , european broadcasters made some agreements to have a pan-european spectacle , which is eurovision . 
  each country is free to select its ~ ~ tributes ~ ~ singers the way they want . 
  each country has about 3 minutes to perform an original act . 
  that 's singing , dancing and overall performance , which range from a little gay , to the gayest things you will ever see ( in a good way ) . 
  oh , and also , popular singers avoid it like the plague . 
  before each act , there is a `` postcard '' to introduce each country . 
  they are always adorable , and there is good reason for it . 
  this one minute of introduction gives time to announcers ( like in sports ) from each countries broadcaster to say mean spirited things and make jokes about said country , so it has to be adorable . 
  then , once everyone has performed ( and most of it is so bad it 's good ) people all across the continent , and critics , vote for their favorite song which wins the contest , and the country gets bragging rights , their singer gets 2 days of fame , and gets to host the extravaganza next year . 
  it 's once a year and it gets close to twice as many views as the superbowl . 
  the closest thing i can think of to explain it is that the mitsotakis family is the bush family of greece . 
  it 's really hard to get behind such a name , even if his views and record are a trillion times better and more forward thinking than those of tsipras . 
  he is just a bad brand all around . 
  you can agree or disagree with him , but everyone agrees that they do n't like what his name and standing represent . 
  the second reminds me of the [ road sign for exiting a town or village in greece .

  i have n't seen them anywhere else .

  dis is not a big deal . 
  america would have been far better off with queen elisabeth than any of your leaders since the monarchy was abolished . 
  the transition to a democracy happened far too fast and was taken over by opportunists who exploited a rather uneducated , and uninformed populace , who for the most part had little to no experience with democracy . 
  many of the issues of america today can be traced back to the so called `` american revolution '' . 
  thinking the avarage hillbilliy who farmed corn and invented mormonism was smart and that america ever was or is a democracy really is exactly as stupid as saying that greece does n't function as a state on the most basic of levels .

  even in a fully libertarian society someone is going to have to look at what is hurting the population and is costing it tax money and tax it more . 
  there is n't such a thing as a fully unregulated economy , and there never could be . 
  or , on second thought , there is a sector of the economy that is unregulated . 
  it 's called criminal activity . 
  and even in countries with non existent governments ( where there is no fear of law enforcement ) they still use mob tactics and kill each other . 
  so , go figure !, 
  ca n't help but see dutch . 
  i thin you should swap the bottom half . 
  [ oh well ] ( https://mattmulheran.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/marlonbnazi3.jpg ), 
  no particular reason . 
  there were many revolutionary flags , and the national assembly chose the blue one . 
  [ patriot lives matter !, 
  [ ... ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/112/547/my-mind-is-full-of-fuck.jpg ), 
   knows about kitsch post-modern aesthetics, 
  not to defend anarcho-communist monkeys but oasth is a monopoly . 
  as far as i know , they are the only company with the exclusive rights to city infrastructure . 
  businesses and profit are fine , but privatizing transport services only to keep them around as monopolies is not . 
  public transport and private enterprise usually do n't go together very well . 
  competition increases options and routes , establishes some infrastructure but at the end of the day does n't work because it sets up barriers in-between competing services and is n't convenient to commuters . 
  you ideally want to have a unified highly efficient network , and for that to really work you basically need to establish a monopoly , or regulate the shit out of companies to the point they de facto become state run non profits . 
  both of these options are bad because they kill competition , the point of privatization . 
  all of it can work to an extent . 
  competition based systems like the ferry industry in greece which are highly regulated can work , and also monopolies and consortiums like tfl can work sometimes . 
  but it 's a delicate balance and public infrastructure does it so effortlessly ( there is no beating the french and their subsidized high speed rail services ) . 
  so even though i am for selling away all the things the government has hoarded simply on principle , ( communication , energy , $ hipping ports , lotteries , land ) , i at least have the perspective to see that public transport is different . 
  i would want us to be more like france and germany , and not the us , when it comes to rails and busses , in having the network rights at least be publicly owned , and running services on them that are worth their price of admission . 
  roads , highways and airports work perfectly well private though , keep those private , please !, 
  sounds mostly fine . 
  i have 1 question before i vote . 
  what would president leandros do with espa programs ? 
  it 's socialism that others pay for ( literally other countries , the eu ) . 
  greece benefits about 450 $ per person , per year from these programs , but if we were to absorb none them in time , taxes would higher by almost 200 $ to pay for eu membership fees but with no net economic benefit .
