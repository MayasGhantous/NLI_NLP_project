  in this war , philip 's forces won against the thessalians , and after his return , his wife had given birth to a girl , the sister of alexander . 
  to honor the gods , philip named his newborn daughter `` victory of thessaly '' or thessaloniki . 
  much later , after alexander 's death , kassandros one of his generals oversaw the fragmentation of the macedonian empire and became king of what was now a smaller macedon , and married thessaloniki to further the legitimacy of his claim . 
  his second son antipatros later killed thessaloniki , and kassandros after disowning him for his behavior , remained the city of therma into thessaloniki in her honor . 
  and it mostly stuck to this day . 
  even though traces of the old name can still be seen , in that the gulf thessaloniki sits on is called `` thermaic '' that 's because like everywhere in greece , there was a city state there with that name , but few realize that thessaloniki was that city state before it was rebuilt and dedicated to the queen of macedon and alexanders sister . 
  well i was n't thinking about rocket engines but i guess those too are necessary , sometimes . 
  so ok , maybe the entire iss ca n't be used . 
  could n't some of its parts ? 
  the life support systems ? 
  the solar arrays . 
  those are all there , right ? 
  why burn them in the atmosphere ? 
  why not keep it alive as a museum ? 
  i 'll be honest 99 % of it is i 'll be very sad to see it go . 
  basically kassandros 's son did n't like that his mother had another son as favorite to get the throne so he killed his mother . 
  this backfired because his father disowned him . 
  to honor his wife , kassandros renamed the port of his kingdom in her honor . 
  kassandros is the one who did it , not his son . 
   so the city of thessaloniki never actually in no point in time was inside the state of thessaly , right ? 
  there is a huge mountain in between , mount olympus . 
  everyone that has driven from southern greece to northern greece knows the pain . 
  a `` greater thessaly '' that includes therma would have been impossible at that time . 
  thanks this is better but i still ca n't get it to work for r/ladara, 
  here is my code now :, 
  / * -- addon : userflairs with images -- * /, 
  . flair,.flairsample-left { text-align : left ! important ; }, 
  . flairoptionpane . flair { text-indent : 16px ; }, 
  . flair {, 
  display : inline-block ;, 
  background-image : url ( % % userflairs % % ) ;, 
  background-repeat : no-repeat ;, 
  / * the `` one '' , `` two '' , etc. . are the names you fill in in the `` css '' input field on the / r / ... / about/flair page . 
  . flair-one : before { background-position : 0px 0px ; }, 
  . flair-two : before { background-position : 0px 16px ; }, 
  . flair-three : before { background-position : 0px 32px ; }, 
  . flair-four : before { background-position : 0px 48px ; }, 
  and i made a sprite-sheet [ like so ] ( https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4dgpimuca5v_jul3eyqxtas6pe-yl0fk7lblryuyhn0.png ) , with every image being 16x16 . 
  since my spritesheet is a grid , my coordinates are like this . 
  problem is what i always get is the first image . 
  regardless of what class i put into the user flair templates menu . 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
   remove the : before , forgot to tell you about this other difference previously , sorry . 
  thanks !, 
  you da best !, 
  so ... good job \u039f\u0391\u03a3\u0391 . 
  i think i had completely underestimated how smart the people at nintendo are . 
  what essentially just happened is that nintendo chose not to follow the home console market to its inevitable deathbed . 
  yes , nintendo , the company that created the console market , is now distancing themselves from it , because with the anti-consumer `` console as service '' model both ms and sony are slowly shoving down our throats , and with the increasingly garbage games we 've been getting , the dedicated home console market is headed for the most monumental crash and burn of its history . 
  good for you for guaranteeing your existence in the post-console world , nintendo !, 
  it would be a shame if we had to loose you !, 
  edit :, 
   pc is all about options and individual choices of games and services !, 
   how dare your have an opinion that i disagree with !? 
  i would be for brexit too if i was n't certain that regulation in brussels wo n't be replaced by british deregulation but with extensive regulation by one of the most nanny states in the world , which is the uk , at least right now . 
  if you think protectionism and welfare is bad in european countries right now ( and it is , we 're quasi socialist alright ) , just wait until britain does n't have to ask 27 other member states and can freely set up their own protectionism , regulations , and welfare . 
  the oldest surviving striped greek flag ( warning , it looks horrible ) looks like [ this ] ( http://www.politischios.gr/sites/default/files/1h_ellinikh_shmaia.jpg ) . 
  we do n't know when it was made or who made it , it has been submerged in water , burned , ripped apart and patched so many times that it 's impossible for it to be accurately dated . 
  but we still know it 's the oldest because it has been preserved in this state since 1921 and there are no known surviving striped flags that predate it . 
  as for the first modern greek flag ever ( a simple white cross on a blue background ) , it does n't survive , [ but one of its identicals does ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/central_macedonia_flag_1821.jpg ) , all the way from 1822 until today . 
  it 's not in good condition either , and someone even cataloged it and wrote his name on it . 
  yeah but why greece tho ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  implying ? 
  archimedes is n't particularly italian either . 
   not literally pasok light, 
  i gave it a lot of thought when making r/ladara and eventually selected the ottoman-turkish flag for the reasons above . 
  having said that , i do n't think it fits this sub . 
  modern turkey is n't so much an enemy of yurop , it 's more like a retard acquaintance . 
  i support this !, 
  localize the shit out of it !, 
  step 1 : go to r/ladara, 
  step 2 : be patriotic, 
  step 3 : there is no step 3, 
  i 've seen a graffiti on a white wall saying : `` i was hired to paint it white , and i looked at it for a while and thought i was in a psychiatric hospital , so then i fixed it '' . 
  and then the anarchy symbol . 
  i swear i am not making this up . 
  i 've actually seen this in exarchia . 
  there you go . 
  fair point . 
  well , not me . 
  good . 
  there is nothing in crete either :(, 
  there are no upcoming events that could topple the government , really until 2019 . 
  i too would love to see tsipras get out of office sooner , but it 's wishful thinking . 
  as things are now , his government is surprisingly stable . 
  he cleaned up his party from the extreme left , and he got pretty cozy with his coalition partner , and even managed to get himself a backup coalition partner in the form of leventis . 
  and at this point he is cozy with the eu too . 
  and he obviously does n't give 2 shits about his approval rating or his constituents being displeased . 
  his reign wo n't be challenged because there wo n't be any governor elections , or european elections to loose until 2019 , and no presidential vote until 2020 . 
  and the fact that he was just reelected leader of syriza from their national convention with 93 % of the vote , means that he has successfully purged all enemies from within his party as well . 
  so wait until 2019 , and even then , do n't hold your breath . 
  there is a good change that the greek economy will recover slightly because of a better economic climate in the eurozone ( despite government policy ) , which he will then own and get reelected . 
  never underestimate the stupidity of the electorate . 
   best thing greeks can do is elect someone who ... 
  it does n't matter that much who we elect . 
  we have very little control of our budget anymore . 
  the eu has the power where it matters and they will force any government to do those things , especially ours . 
  surely tsipras pretends to fight back , which does n't help with investor confidence , but you should know by now that it 's only an act . 
  we ... do n't really know .
