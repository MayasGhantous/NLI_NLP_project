  it is politically impossible . 
  tsipras is ( say what you will ) a very charismatic politician , the face of left and enjoys 90 % + support from the members of his party , without him , the party will literally die . 
  so nobody will risk throwing the party away and even if they do , it 's gon na be so little that tsipras will invite a new party in his government to stay in power for the remainder of his term . 
  elections right now is a fantasy . 
  and i do n't mind it either way . 
  i personally have no economic problems , i have a decent job and i can live with paying a bit more taxes . 
  of course i want a new , less insane government , but i want the entitled shits whose hero was tsipras last year to take it in the ass for as long as possible , even more . 
  because that 's human nature . 
  that 's how people learn . 
  mitsotakis wants to remove tsipras from power before greece 's growth rate rises ( due to a better international industrial climate ) . 
  he fears that if people see gains during tsipras 's time , he would be crushed on the next elections , forgetting that with entitled shits in power , nobody ever sees gains in the first place . 
  time is our biggest ally against idiots like tsipras . 
  let things run its course as should . 
  i would n't mind , but it wo n't happen . 
  leave it to the left to live in their microcosm where everything is fine while at the same time they destroy everything . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  did you ask me if i want to pay even more taxes for your majesty 's well being ? 
  well i do n't want to . 
  you should take care of yourself . 
  made by `` th . 
  itimoudis and son '' textile company . 
  at the top and at the bottom it has additional information , such as the name of the product , the fact that it 's made from acrylic , the main store ( or factory ) being at ealaoritou street ( ??? 
  ) , number 20 , the telephone number being +30 ( unknown 2 digit peripheral code ) ( unknown 2 digit municipal code ) 531110 , although i can make out the word \u0398\u0395\u03a3 / \u039d\u0399\u039a\u0397 at the end which suggests the number is : +30\u00a02310\u00a0531110 , which i googled and it turns out that [ the number is pretty much valid and owned by the same company which still exists ] ( http://www.itimoudisroyal.gr/static/contact/ ) !, 
  so yep . 
  old company insignia . 
  probably from the 60s to 80s . 
  nothing special !,

  for greece ( if anyone wonders or cares ) :, 
  march the 25 , 1821 : greek declaration of independence , national holiday . 
  october the 27 : greek flag day !, 
  october the 28 , 1940 : greece declares war against the axis powers and their allies , national holiday . 
  ( day of germanhating ), 
  december the 27 , 537 : completion and inauguration ceremony of the hagia sophia . 
  ( gib back ! ), 
  then we have january the 19th , which is orthodox epiphany in the east , which marks the end of nativity celebrations , however the orthodox churches of the west ( so ... just greece ) , adopted the gregorian calendar and celebrate all except easter together with the catholic-bros . 
  so even though it is epiphany for eastern orthodox countries , greece is wrongfully included there . 
  ( unless it 's something different ), 
  april the 3rd : no freaking idea . 
  this is phenomenal, 
  to be fair , this is probably correct and i wo n't even look it up . 
  i had my doubts about saganaki to begin with . 
  i mean deep frying cheese ? 
  that 's some burger shit right there . 
  i am glad it found its way back to greece tho , it 's the good kind of burger shit . 
  speaking english is a race . 
  greece can into nordic ?

  you better know some linux . 
  implying syriza will get more than 10 % of the vote in elections after this one . 
  no they wo n't . 
  that 's the deal with pasok-like parties at this stage . 
  they erupt like a firework and then it 's over . 
  they exhaust their promises and bullshit too fast to be a self sustained political force . 
  in my experience the best exercise for tremolo does n't even involve a guitar . 
  just tap the respective fingers rythmically on a desk . 
  preferably for long periods . 
  start slowlly and make sure to do it rythmically . 
  if you have a metronome do it with a metronome . 
  after a while , start doing other things with your other hand . 
  when this movement basically ingrains itself into your muscle memory ( days afterwards ) , grab a guitar . 
  it should only only take you 10 minutes to be playing tremolo at reasonable speeds . 
  that 's how you enter into the tremolo world . 
  of course you ca n't acquire actual technique or speed without playing , so once you get the hand of if , do plenty of that . 
   90 % of job applicability already replaced by bots, 
  11/10 lmao, 
  \u038c\u03c7\u03b9 , go ahead and do it . 
  that 's the fucking point . 
  they totally should tho ... :p, 
  r/the _ adonis, 
  r/the _ koulis could work too . 
  yes , but consider the following : our gas costs close to a euro per liter ( 3.8 euros per galon ) , more in some places , and car owners here pay additional annual taxes that are supposed to greatly subsidize tools in the first place . 
  we 're talking hundreds of euros per car owner every year regardless if the use the motorways or not . 
  if you add it all up . 
  it 's not just expensive , it 's insanely expensive . 
  but it 's understandable . 
  such is the nature of building roads in [ such terrain ] ( https://dpmasitm.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/maptopogreece.jpg?w=640 ) . 
   undermine the gov ' t in negotiations, 
  : tips tin foil hat : like they did in 2015 ? 
  can we march somewhere else ? 
  do we have to go to rome ? 
  i suspect i am not the only one . 
  it 's technically true though . 
  syriza wo n't be the government by 2018 . 
  nice to see the greek flag with its original light blue too . 
  i know it 's technically still the case that any shade of blue can be used but after greece became a republic i honestly think that flag manufacturers are outcompeting to see who can make the worst darkest shade of blue , so you never see the almost bavarian like blue colours of the original ( our first monarch was bavarian ) anymore . 
  even the name of the flag is galanolefki ( light blue and white ) but noone seems to get it anymore :(, 
  this is what people do n't seem to get .
