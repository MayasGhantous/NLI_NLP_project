  i think i should reveal the meaning here before i go to sleep and before this fades to obscurity . 
  it 's basically a visual pun . 
  but to understand it you need to know the following :, 
  see this region is made of 2 archipelagos . 
  the cyclades , and the dodecanese . 
   map, 
  one set of islands is named cyclades because they sort of form a circle . 
  it 's the one where a lot of islands are concentrated in the west . 
  cyclades means circle islands . 
  the other is the eastern archipelago , called dodecanese . 
  it 's named like that from the number 12 in greek , `` dodeka '' . 
  that 's because 12 of those islands are inhabited . 
  now , the flag . 
  it has a circle slightly on the left , that stands for the cyclades in the west , and a rising sun slightly on the right made of 12 points which stands for the most eastern part of the country , the dodecanese . 
  ( interpretation 1 ) when the 2 parts are brought together and overlap , 2 waves form an `` equal '' symbol , signifying the equality of ( what was previously ) 2 different provinces . 
  ( interpretation 2 ) the 2 waves symbolize the 2 regions coming together and moving as one , with the same ups and downs . 
  it 's actually a genuine flag . 
  the greek peripheries are kind of a new thing so not all of them have flags but some do . 
  and i 've seen this one hoisted on government buildings multiple times . 
  it 's not consistant at all though . 
  sometimes the flags have the name of the province on the bottom , sometimes they do n't . 
  and its not the kind of flag that you see everywhere . 
  but ... 
  it 's official nonetheless . 
  ps : now that i think about it ... the actual province seems to not have any logo or stamp of its own , as you can evidently see on their horrible website : http://www.pnai.gov.gr/, 
  or you can go [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_aefn27_a8 ), 
  just keep this one cause i am in love with it now ; _ ;, 
  is n't a square a simpler or equally simple shape ? 
  something like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/vi0ph3q ) ? 
   fictional, 
  the [ hellenic republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece ) , a country indeed made up by [ greek states ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a0%ce%b5%cf%81%ce%b9%cf%86%ce%ad%cf%81%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%b5%cf%82_%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82_%ce%95%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1%cf%82#/media/file:greeceperipheriesblank.png ) , [ is a country that genuinely exists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd6qtc2_aqa ) . 
  correct answer !, 
  then why would it look like this and not like the byzantine flag in some way ? 
  2 things, 
  1 ) [ i find the colours a miss in general ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/bandera_d'%c3%80tica.svg/1000px-bandera_d'%c3%80tica.svg.png ), 
  2 ) [ the flag that attica is paying homage to , did n't have any yellow or gold . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vu6q5i18ru8/twqbwxrdkci/aaaaaaaaap8/mqsqt0nnqty/s1600/sxedsamos.jpg ), 
  yes . 
  also the cross made more pronounced and the colors better in general . 
  [ this one is ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/bandera_d'%c3%80tica.svg/1000px-bandera_d'%c3%80tica.svg.png ) , [ this one is not ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vu6q5i18ru8/twqbwxrdkci/aaaaaaaaap8/mqsqt0nnqty/s1600/sxedsamos.jpg ), 
  the flag of attica pays homage to the little islands of [ spetses ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a3%cf%80%ce%ad%cf%84%cf%83%ce%b5%cf%82#/media/file:1821_flag_of_spetses.svg ) and [ psara ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a8%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%ac#/media/file:1821_flag_of_psara.svg ) two tiny autonomous and then independent islands that even though are not geographically close , are part of the state of attica to this day . 
  that is because their navies liberated the peninsula during the greek war of independence . 
   do you guys still get a lot of capsized boats on the sea and migrants heading shores or situation is under control now . 
  that was never true of most of greece , even at the peak of the migrant crisis , unless you stayed in an island close to the turkish shore or in some key area of athens you may not have even noticed any refugee or migrant at all . 
  that 's basically 3 islands where all the pictures came from . 
  but now everything is ok as much as we can tell . 
  there is a much more significant number of migrants on greek soil , but those are genuine asylum seekers and are all in migrant reception centers . 
  far from population centers . 
  they have stopped coming in mass because they know that they will either have to apply for asylum here or go back to turkey for good . 
  so yes , everything is under control . 
  always kinda was . 
  i do n't know . 
  honestly it 's very hard to find it in the wild to test that , but darker like this looks much better to me tbh . 
  i like to think that it was because of popularity . 
  greece did n't have a national flag before the 1970s . 
  the king would use his [ own flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:hellenic_kingdom_flag_1935.svg ) ( a cross on a blue background ) and the people would use ... well ... the flag of the king or the [ battle banner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:hellenic_army_war_flag.svg ) of the army , basically . 
  but oh , have you noticed that the navy had a [ sick looking flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_greece.svg ) !? 
  which in all honestly was probably adopted in the early 1800s instead of the simple cross because symmetrical flags make for awful naval jacks . 
  which is why the british naval jacks looks like [ this ] ( https://carolwallace.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/795px-british_admirals_promotion_path-svg.png ) , and the japanese imperial flag looked like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/naval_ensign_of_japan.svg/2000px-naval_ensign_of_japan.svg.png ) . 
  countries with symmetrical flags generally have to introduce some form of asymmetry into their naval jacks , for the purpose of readability and of rotation . 
  naval flags must be able to be hoisted upside down in case of danger , and be readable even when there is no wind . 
  given greece 's geography and proximity to the sea , over time the naval jack probably got more [ visibility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_greece#/media/file:greek_flag-santorini.png ) and attention than the other competing state and royal flags . 
  greece is basically a country built around ships . 
  from the smallest [ fishing boat ] ( http://gogreeceyourway.gr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/a-fishermans-boat-near-the-village-of-palaiochori-on-milos-island.jpg ) to the largest [ high speed passenger ships of today ] ( http://www.naxosnow.gr/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/c404c641bd90fdb85c1b770b0aeb710a.jpeg ) , to [ merchant ships ] ( http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/356.html ) , to [ navy ships ] ( http://greekmilitary.net/webzoom.freewebs.com/gfile/frigates%20class%20standard%20thermistoklis%20f465.jpg ) , people , from merchants , to fishermen , to businessmen , therefore needed to have , and hoist the naval jack !, 
  so its prominence only grew over time , not only in the islands , but to the ports in the mainland . 
  all of these , and more factors probably conspired in favor of this design , and soon , it pretty much became the de-facto greek flag , used by the king himself and representing greece in international events like the olympics , long before officially adopted . 
  by the time of [ ww2 ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/greek-battalion-wwii.jpg ) the flag had been so [ associated ] ( http://www.privateletters.net/images/aboutww2/allies_greece1_bg.png ) with greece that it was impossible to change . 
  and in the 1970s it became official . 
  i do n't think it 's comparable . 
  the americans do n't dispute the historical fact that they had and used nuclear weapons against japan . 
  hardly appealing . 
  who cares !? 
  let 's try something [ new ] ( http://imgur.com/a/7m7re ) . 
  try it out !, 
  chesus !, 
  i 'll use flair `` discussion '' because i honestly want your take on those flags . 
  is there any realistic way we can fix the european version of the sob ? 
  which we will call : coat of arms on tricolor - coaot ... xd, 
  [ meanwhile in greece ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupvnbck7fw ) it 's hardly a weather news broadcast ... 
  because it does n't work as a flag !, 
  that 's why !, 
  the coat of arms over the russian flag is undoubtedly pretty , but what people often do n't understand about flags is that they are n't logos , striving for the maximum visual appeal . 
  flags plainly do n't have to be pretty , they have to be flags . 
  they can be pretty , and flags , but they have to be flags first !, 
  seal on background . 
  see american state flags, 
  should n't the greek flag be like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/oo88zca ) ? 
  b-but ... pay debnts ? 
  why nut greddit ? 
  this, 
  because of the patriarchy . 
  literally !, 
   i am from an eu country, 
  then there is no problem . 
  you can simply stay in cyprus for however long . 
  fuck it . 
  unpopular opinion :, 
  not so much . 
  hey guys !, 
  i am greek , living in greece , 22 yo , working part time as a teacher of classical guitar , and studying computer science as well .
