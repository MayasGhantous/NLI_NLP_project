  as you can see i am thinking of having 10 forts ( sort of mini-dungeons ) , 7 dungeons and 3 castles ( mega dungeons ) , each , i am hoping , with its own backstory and i also want to flesh out the towns and settlements and put a bunch of secrets in the map as a whole too . 
  doing all of this is n't necessary to get to the queen either , but i also wanted there to be ample alternatives for leveling up because you know ... 
  i want this to be brutal and all . 
  players may suddenly find themselves with a new character without xp . 
  just the ionian islands and that 's was n't so much a colony more like a dominion . 
  the islands were self governing . 
  yep . 
  add a little olive oil and it 's totally palletable, 
  i ca n't find any proposals for a new serbian flag . 
  could you show us ? 
  look , if you remove the symbol , i am digging it .

  my family has had a fair experience with both and i can safely say ( from my own experience ) that there is no public hospital that even comes close to the worse private hospital . 
  i was recently diagnosed with something a bit more serious and my doctor strongly suggested getting private care if necessary , so it 's not even a week that i bought a new insurance plan , just to be safe . 
  and new insurance plans are fucking op !, 
  it costs less than my internet and and it is full coverage , free checkups and even free visits to diet professionals every year !, 
  it 's ridiculous !, 
  it was n't always like this . 
  public care was n't always utter shit everywhere and plans used to be a total ripoff and some still are , but i can only imagine things are so much better for the private business now because the failing healthcare system has forced people to private health insurance and the economies of scale for insurers are much better now . 
  tl ; dr : co-pays ( valid strategy if you 're young without health problems , i 've been there ) or insurance , private is pretty much your only real choice nowadays , that 's it if you want actual healthcare . 
  nope . 
  insurance rates have really gone lower than 25 bucks per month . 
  i could n't believe it either . 
  my insurance pays 100 % of the cost after 2.000 euros all the way to 800.000 euros with no yearly limit , and covers checkups for 100 % . 
  and there are no restrictions of hospital or anything like that . 
  this sounds like a good deal for me . 
  it will however get more expensive when i get older or if i get sicker but that 's to be expected , and there is a cap on that too . 
  which they often do . 
  i did . 
  i did a fair amount of research and talked to many insurers before getting it and it came out really good . 
  i know 100 % of what 's in there . 
  scanning my fucking contract and linking it ?

  here is a suggestion : let 's close vexillologyjerk . 
  if anything is fine here now , there 's no reason to split the submissions . 
  and that 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  in fact that 's really the greatest strength of the parliamentary system . 
  bad prime ministers never serve their full term , which means that they never truly do institutional damage . 
  that would still make it a parliamentary system then, 
  from my dm experience : do n't think about it too much . 
  let ** the players ** handle the situation the way they see fit . 
  do n't rob them of the experience of dealing with the situation the way ** they ** see fit just because you happen to have a plan in mind . 
  this is one of the few instances when not planning as a dm is actually preferable . 
  it 's ** their ** game after all , not yours . 
  i get what you 're saying but i 've seen so many dms that just plan and plan and plan and end up alienating their players because they do n't really let them ** do ** anything . 
  sure the dm can have fun , but ** they ** are the principle actors . 
  any dm should always remember that .

  can confirm . 
  they should really just get rid of their central pattern . 
  there is not other county that uses this flag in this proportions . 
  it would be infinately better, 
  it 's my personal opinion , i think coa on flags are worse than lettering . 
  because i use flags the way the were meant to be used , i sail . 
  it 's infuriating to look at a flag from a distance and be unable to tell which one it is because you ca n't quite tell the coa . 
  better just write the name of what you represent , at least this way i could read it with binoculars .

  you deserve gold . 
  cyprus is europe . 
  it 's culturally european , and even georgaphicaly it 's europe since it 's an island north of crete ( the definition of europe since time immemorial ) . 
  arguing whether cyprus is europe or not is sort of arguing whether anything outside of the european mainland ( sicily , crete , ireland , iceland ) is europe . 
  anatolia on the other hand is so not europe that the name asia likely comes from it . 
  its coast has historically been the divide .
