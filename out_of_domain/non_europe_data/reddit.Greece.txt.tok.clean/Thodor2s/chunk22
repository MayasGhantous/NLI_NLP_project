  europe is n't just the mainland . 
  arguing whether cyprus is europe is close to arguing whether iceland or ireland are europe . 
  yes . 
  so much so that i downvoted this . 
  it ruins the roomporn . 
  not my proudest momment in retrospect . 
  damn impressive . 
  [ holy shit when did we become this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btoe0rckdc0 ), 
  the one with the top white stripe and star is fucking astonishing . 
  probably would he in m top 5 favorite flags if it was used . 
  seriously , start using it , people . 
  wait , there was this option for flag all along ? 
  hey nz ... why do n't you guys use that ? 
  no , it was to not be confused with australia . 
  yeah , i bet , blue is hard to see at sea . 
  if 70 % or more of the flag is blue , it does n't make for a good naval jack . 
  \u0388\u03bb\u03b1 , let 's be real . 
   turkey to pass greece in gdp ppp in the next few years . 
  not if we suddenly deregulate , cut public spending and taxes and attract tons of investment . 
  since greece 's infrastructure is already in place , we 're poised for massive growth when we do this , and turkey ... well , they 're not . 
  just one . 
  one government that 's not complete fucking retards . 
  is it so fucking hard to ask for that ? 
   the far right in greece , is anti-capitalist and anti-neo liberal last time i checked, 
  which is to say they are genuine fascists . 
  oh come on !, 
  call it what you wish . 
  the idea that a leader must plan for a whole country from afar with no regard for human life is a dangerous idea . 
  greek here with a daily reminder that we 're still fist world . 
  in fact half of the countries in europe have it worse than us . 
  the colours of the region of attica are red blue and white tho . 
  athens is , and i am not exaggerating here , 99 % of attica . 
  the [ current flag of athens ] ( http://www.flagid.org/flagfiles/1189.gif ) is basically the [ flag of attica ] ( https://flagspot.net/images/g/gr-at.gif ) with athena at the center , the patroon goddess , and the entity that gave the city its name . 
  i do n't mind your flag , in fact i think its quite cool , but i do n't think it fits athens , for one the colors are wrong , and also the symbolism is fishy . 
  usually a helmet stands for the god of war , ares , with athena 's symbol being the shield ( with the hear of medusa on it , preferably ) . 
  or , [ the owl ] ( https://www.fleur-de-coin.com/images/thumbnails/km200-km187_2002a-size200x200.jpg ) . 
  this is meant to differentiate the two gods of war , with ares representing the chaotic side of war and athena representing strategy and wisdom , and cool heads prevailing . 
  it 's also weird to see olive branches next to a symbol of war . 
  it 's not that your flag is bad by any means , but i think it 's poorly researched . 
  can confirm that one piece is huge here . 
  i am genuinely sad to see the old design completely gone . 
  what a horrible move . 
  yeah i know it was only popular because it was so good damn awful but ... 
  i grew accustomed to its awfulness . 
  the same design should have been simplified and unfucked , so that at the very least the spirit of the old flag lives on ... 
  lol, 
  care to explain ? 
  that 's my point , nigga !, 
  choose one, 
  wait , you are telling us that the arab world is n't a magic land where christians , jews and muslims live together in peace ? 
  you must be racist and islamophobic then . 
  i know right ? 
  wow . 
  no , \u03c4\u03bf objective . 
  into something like this :, 
  i get the limitations of the sidemap , but the 5 stripes are n't very helpful ... 
  if it 's not 9 stripes it kind of misses the point completely , and it 's not like 9 stripes would be visible . 
  so use a white centered ( not nordic ) cross on a blue background . 
  it was greece 's flag for most of the past 2 centuries , and still serves as an alternative flag to this day . 
  in fact , if you visit museums and old government buildings in greece you 're more likely to see this flag hoisted than the one we have now . 
  it 's not like the stripes themselves are ever used on their own or have meaning on their own , so the cross would be more accurate in that regard , not to mention , it would improve visibility . 
  probably because european flags were rectangular during colonial times and influenced every corner of the world , right ? 
  sure . 
  but still ... why ? 
  why did europeans had rectangular flags in the first place ? 
  that was clearly not always the case !, 
  in the middle ages for example , most flags were square , much like the flags of the swiss cantons and the byzantine flag . 
  what changed since then ? 
  to this day many battle banners in europe are not rectangular , and are for example square like [ the greek banner ] ( https://ethnikismosblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ellada-parelash-stratiotiki-shmaies.jpg ) , or more elaborate like [ the swedish banner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_sweden#/media/file:naval_ensign_of_sweden.svg ) , so why did rectangles prevail to this extent in the end ? 
  is there something about rectangular flags that makes them better ? 
  not veterans , and certainly not new players . 
  that 's to do both with the fact that the current boosters are very poorly explained , cost a lot , and do little . 
  to start there are , as of date , 2 kinds of boosters : multipliers and amplifiers ( this word kind of sucks for what they do ... maybe you 'll help me name this category better ) . 
  affinity , resource and credit boosters are straight up multipliers , and should really be called that : affinity multiplier , resource multiplier and credit multiplier . 
  they double the amount of respective drop on pickup , only work for the player who has them , and they stack with double affinity or credit or resource events . 
  resource drop chance booster ( which is a terrible name ) is an amplifier , and should be called resource amplifier . 
  it makes the rng resource engine of the game roll twice , and drops the results of that . 
  it works for your entire squad , and it does n't stack with other amplifiers . 
  amplifiers stack with multipliers . 
  resource amplifier and multiplier will mean that the enemies drop ( on average ) twice the loot , and you pick up twice of every drop , making the collection rate essentially 4x . 
  but the game tells you none of this , and expects you buy them anyway !, 
  also , the kind of boosters we have today are unhelpful . 
  they are not much of a convenience , or at least they are not worth 80 plat . 
  here are some boosters that de should consider adding :, 
  ** component amplifier ** : it rolls the rng engine twice for components and mission rewards . 
  beat a boss ? 
  get 2 warframe parts !, 
  finish an interception wave ? 
  get 2 rolls of the respective rotation reward !, 
  ** credit amplifier ** : rolls the rng engine twice for all credit rewards . 
  dropping ( on average ) double the credits for the entire squad , and doubling the credit rewards at the end of the mission . 
  ** focus multiplier ** : doubles the amount of focus you get , while also removing the daily cap on focus during its duration . 
  ** reputation multiplier ** : doubles the amount of syndicate points - simaris points - and conclave standing while also removing the daily cap for all reputation during its duration . 
  both of reputation and focus multipliers should stack with affinity multiplier . 
  now change all the prices to half of what they are today , except of course for the component amplifier which really should be at current levels , if not more . 
  component amplifier also should n't be like the other amplifiers and should only work for the person who has it . 
  would you use boosters if that were to happen ? 
  i sure as hell would . 
  if de ever wants to make people sink plat into the market of warframe so that we buy more platinum , that 's a good way to do it ...
