  like ... yesterday ? 
  like , keep museums , archaeological places , and schools public , and give everything else away for as little as possible so that the owners then invest as much as possible on fixing those businesses and create taxable income and jobs that the government currently ca n't ... 
  is this too straight forward for you , tsipras ? 
  lies is a strong word though . 
  yeah , it 's awful symbolism . 
  yes but an exit could be very real thing . 
  and it wo n't be comforting if something goes wrong to point to `` ignorance '' as a reason for exiting . 
  that 's debatable , but that 's not what the poster implies . 
  the poster implies that british taxpayers are paying for fancy bridges in greece . 
  this is simply not true . 
   and if greece does n't pay ... 
  but it 's not greece , it 's the company that runs the bridge . 
  and even if that were to happen , the greek government would probably step in and pay on its behalf since we would n't want to loose the ability to finance other things through the eib . 
  it just is n't uk taxpayers money or eu money . 
  at some point when we give our money away for something it stops being our money . 
  we created the eib , put some money a big pot . 
  the end . 
  now the eib gets loans from the ecb and gives loans to companies to build stuff . 
  we ca n't get any of our capital back , we can benefit from the services that the eib provides . 
   if greece fails to pay the full value of its debt ( i know , wildly unlikely , greece 's creditworthiness is legendary ), 
  except it 's not greece because it 's not the greek public that owns the roads and bridges ... 
  it 's the company who runs the bridge , and it 's doing fine . 
  it 's still lies , but using strong language like that would look like i am taking a stand , which i am absolutely not . 
  i am not a british citizen and i wo n't be voting . 
  i just care about facts . 
  it saddens me that neither side is committed to sticking to the facts . 
  it 's not like we do n't get money for some stuff , like the rails get some eu money , our fisheries and our farmers get eu money , renewable energy gets eu money , etc. 
  our roads and bridges do n't get anything , because they are private . 
  they are for profit businesses that get loans , and charge tools . 
  loans form the eib are n't the same as cohesion funds . 
  people keep track of that stuff . 
  and it 's not like it 's a public project where there is room for corruption . 
  like ... : /, 
  well the greek flag is n't in the flair selection of this sub , and understandably so . 
  the flair selection has the flags of the british isles and commonwealth flags , which are more than enough . 
  but the post kept growing and i could n't find myself easily so i just picked a flag that looked the closest to a [ white cross on a blue background ] ( https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2012/04/23/16/22/greece-38803_960_720.png ) and named it greece . 
  it 's pretty close to the greek banner so ... fair enough . 
  [ my next choice would have been scotland ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gh9j890uzh4/tud7ocj9_bi/aaaaaaaafdu/ld8pfznqmbg/s1600/scotland%2band%2bgreek%2bflag%2bcompared.jpg ), 
  \u039a\u03b1\u03b9 [ \u03b5\u03b4\u03ce ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/@37.9341829,23.6943665,3a,75y,328.1h,91.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1siqxsf2i4rpcpe1_wp0yzrg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) \u039a\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 btw . 
   filthy greek mouth, 
  that is simply not true . 
  the white cross on the blue background is our , and i quote `` ethnosimo '' or `` national symbol '' . 
  it 's in the coat of arms , and in our flag , and its the battle banner , and stuff and it 's even an official alternative flag , which is widely used , even on old government buildings and museums . 
  it has no link to the monarchy . 
  the reason we have the one with the stripes added to it , is unsurprisingly , because it became more popular . 
  it drew more attention over the centuries , because it makes for a much better , much more distinct flag , and people liked and used the design more than the actual flag !, 
  to the point that the stripes became the de-facto greek flag long before it was officially adopted in the 70s . 
  i personally like both . 
  there is charm to both flags .

  can you add r/greece 's meetups on the map ? 
  the one for athens is settled now at the very least !, 
  here is your [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/4oq1zj/reddit_global_meetup_final_update/ ) , here is your [ thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/grmd/comments/4oq30p/athens_greece_possibly_more_cities/ ) here . 
  there could be possible redditors on vacation here at the time and you guys are welcome here !, 
  go ahead and ask in the thread in english for information in english !, 
  the caliphate of al-kos is mostly safe . 
  and one of the prettiest islands in the ~ ~ aegean ~ ~ islamic world . 
  i suggest you visit before the knights templar organize the reconquista . 
  if you visit during that it 's going to be messy ... 
  always latest . 
  it 's f * cking incredible . 
  i am not sold on dis . 
   so , you 're saying that most greeks would agree with my `` what the fuck ? '', 
  response ? 
  i literally went `` what the fuck '' . 
  yes , there is such a thing as greek norms but they are subtle things like knowing what someone means when he stares at you and nods , or accepting someones rudeness and adjusting your behavior so that you are as far removed from his grumpiness as humanly possible , or having to always kindly agree with what elders say even if it 's the most racist bigoted thing in the world , or the fact that if you do n't know what a greek plate is or how it 's made or do n't follow the greek culinary calendar ( and yes there is such a thing . 
  stuff like fish on clear monday , well done meat on fat thursday etc. . . ) it 's considered the worst offence in the world and everyone recoils in horror as they try to forcibly feed you what you 're supposed to be eating . 
  but no . 
  being a ** filthy whore ** is not part of greek norms . 
  women saying that every single one of their woman peers and acquaintances is a whore is , but i think that 's not unique to greeks . 
  men doing the same are not considered macho either . 
  it is considered incredibly unmanly to hurt a woman or her feelings in any way , and men are held to much higher standards in that regard than women . 
  do n't worry . 
  here in greece and in italy there are talks already about giving british nationals residing or studying here eu citizenship so they can stay for as long as they please . 
  i am sure many more countries including cyprus will do something similar , and it may even be decided at the european level . 
  it was n't just objection on historical basis . 
  at the time macedonia was a greek province and used the same symbol on a blue background as its flag . 
  macedonia is not province anymore , but the flag is still official and widely used . 
  price is fine for an hour in naxos . 
  this is n't poorfag athens . 
  [ i made a similar flag a while ago , only , in reverse , so that the sahovnica is at the hoist side ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/4kujrt/my_take_on_some_eastern_european_flags/ ) . 
  but yes , i think this pattern is really cool . 
   greece fails to secure a bailout . 
  this is literally impossible . 
  i think it was inevitable . 
  it 's a matter of geography that we were going to be in the front lines of the cold war . 
  and it 's actually kind of remarkable that we did n't end up divided north to south during the civil war . 
  it certainly was n't our own stupidity . 
  i am going to say , and i know that many people here are still in denial about this . 
  it is the people 's fault 100 % . 
  bankers exist elsewhere as well , uninformed and unaccountable politicians do n't . 
  the only excuse that i am willing to consider is that we could n't hold the government accountable , because they were stacking debt under the table . 
  but to say that my parents rewarded bad and corrupt governments by voting them in office again and again would be an understatement . 
  so no . 
  it is our fault , it could n't just happen to anyone ( and it did n't happen elsewhere ) , we had built a system of incompetence all these years and we ought to acknowledge that and fix it . 
  we are responsible for electing better people in office and not repeat the same mistakes again . 
  and by the way , we need to declare war on the generation of shame . 
  i do n't give two shits if the grandpa who voted pasok , had no qualifications and was appointed in the public sector gets a pension . 
  paying for his incompetence by paying the debt and fixing the mess he 's created is enough without having to pay his majesty a generous pension . 
  i could n't find anything in english , i am sure you can get the information at the airport though .
