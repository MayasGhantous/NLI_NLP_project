  pricing is 10 $ for all metro services to and from the airport . 
  for buss airport services the price is 6 $ . 
  tickets within the city of athens for tram , metro and buses cost 1,40 $ regardless of where you want to go , and how many means of transport you are going to use , but have a time limit of 90 minutes . 
  for those under 18 , older than 65 , students of eu universities or the disabled , the fair is half or less . 
  so 5 $ and 3 $ for airport services , and 0,60 $ for transportation within athens . 
  please someone nuke us ... 
  please ; _ ;, 
  i think this is the first flag that i make that genuinely hurts to look at ... 
  i posted [ my final designs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/4s1t43/seychellesized_greece/ ) on r/vexillology . 
  check them out . 
  disagree . 
  the current greek flag is really cool imo . 
  yes . 
  probably if it was presented to a committee , it would n't be picked . 
  as my flair suggests , i personally prefer the old greek flag . 
  but the story of the galanolefki ( the name of this flag ) is a different one . 
  it 's a rare case of an quasi-unofficial flag that became extremely popular despite the fact that it was n't the national flag . 
  people were using it for centuries as the de-facto national flag before it became official in the 1970s , and [ i think that says something ] ( http://www.greekboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/186102612.jpg ) . 
  to be fair the old flag is still in use as an alternative flag and the new flag was the de facto flag pretty much since the 1920s when the second hellenic republic was created . 
  so its not like anyone has to pick one or the other . 
  parliament has recognized both as legit flags of greece . 
  sootopolis city and the spear pillar is why there should be a game based on greece . 
  just imagine not just the landscapes but also the pokemon of that region based on greek mythology . 
  probably generation 9 after a snowy scandinavian region , but yeah , both are long overdue gamefreak ... 
  on persia, 
  90 % of greeks : there is still a persia ? 
  what ? 
  iran is persia ? 
  i thought they were arabs . 
  good for them persians that they are still around . 
  5 % of greeks : persia is fine . 
  5 % of greeks : in formation soldiers !, 
  on turkey, 
  5 % of greeks : turkey is fine . 
  i visited once and everyone was nice . 
  i have turk friends ... etc. 
  5 % of greeks : i do n't exactly like turkey . 
  the political situation there is unsettling and it 's a huge danger for stability in the region . 
  turkish people are mostly ok though , especially the westerners . 
  90 % of greeks : remove kebab !, 
  reclaim constantinople for christendom !, 
  fight the evil hoard from the east !, 
  well fuck ... of course i would have done the same , had i spent time reading about kavats , but seeing how i hardly have time to play the fucking game , how should i know ? 
  and in fact , it 's not my job to communicate why the `` starter pack '' is bullshit and why it 's a waste of money . 
  but what would finland have then ? 
  i changed the one for sweden slightly too . 
  do people consider this a big deal ? 
  because here in greece the law for the flag does n't even disclose what kind of blue . 
  any blue is ok , and i 've seen all kind of blue colours being used . 
  it 's not exactly hard to tilt the greek flag 45 degrees . 
  i 'll do it next year . 
  cyprus is the island of copper and olives . 
   not capital t, 
  so ... the bird ? 
  there are 13 flags you ca n't make simply by cutting the original flag , can you find them ? 
  i came to post [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qvfs5 ) ... you win this time !, 
  help , i ca n't scan this qr code !, 
  vertical tricolors : correct , uk : correct , cyprus : correct . 
  any flag using their emblem : incorrect , bosnia : incorrect , greece : incorrect . 
  this leaves you with 5 flags to find . 
  remember , we 're comparing it to the current flag of the country ( that should give away 2 of them ), 
  yes , but it is possible to make , as opposed to , for example [ spain ] ( http://imgur.com/a/7mq8n ) . 
  why though ? 
  these are better than mine . 
  like ... way better . 
  the greek national motto \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ae \u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ( pronounced : eleftheria i thanatos , roughly meaning : liberty or death ) was seen in many [ early greek flags ] ( http://www.oocities.org/aeolis.geo/f46.jpg ) , especially in regional flags in the 1800s , and it was supposedly even given a shout out in the current national flag , which supposedly has 9 stripes after the 9 syllables of this phrase . 
  there is no evidence of this though and its most likely a case of assigning meaning rather than meaning originally being there . 
  the olive branch is a symbol of greece since antiquity , and a symbol of the third hellenic republics ' commitment to pacifism after withdrawing from cyprus in 1974 . 
  it was introduced in the [ coat of arms ] ( http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/images/f/ff/greece.jpg ) after the fall of the junta and remains there ever since . 
  i know the messages are kind of conflicting , but oh well ... 
  maybe the red saltire in the uk needed to be a bit thinner but other than that 10/10 . 
  i wish i could upvote twice . 
  this is a problem of simple designs . 
  it 's hard to make them meaningful initially . 
  simple designs gain in meaning overtime , much like the cross or the crescent . 
  in trying to create flags which are symbols by nature , one should seek to create the capacity for meaning , rather than meaning itself . 
  distinctiveness and function are the flags core characteristics . 
  so long as a flag looks good to fly , people will fly it , and over time , and struggle , people will assign the flag meaning . 
  this is how the nordic flags came to be . 
  this is how the greek flag came to be . 
  this is how the tricolors came to be . 
  it did n't have much meaning initially , people gave it their own . 
  that 's what makes these flags truly special . 
  yes , they did have some meaning initially . 
  all flags do . 
  but the genius of these designs is that they were simple and abstract enough so that people could assign them their own meanings . 
  that 's what makes for a good flag . 
  that 's why we take our time to differentiate between the [ greek cross ] ( http://www.gocek.org/christiansymbols/images/greekcrs.gif ) , and the [ nordic cross ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/nordic_cross_flags_of_northern_europe.svg/2000px-nordic_cross_flags_of_northern_europe.svg.png ) and we do n't just say these flags are a cross . 
  the context of [ one ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-89k4ip31onm/vqxlwmrrbsi/aaaaaaaa7mq/dcsblb5dbv4/s1600/1821.jpg ) and the [ other ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/cd/50/84/cd5084d78bc202f1032fb6a853d4ede8.jpg ) could n't be more different . 
  i did some maths . 
  why is this in vexillologyjerk ? 
  this . 
  find if your municipality has any activities and go there . 
   while it is possible that the north will end up being part of turkey , and the south part of greece, 
  this sentence shows 0 understanding of the situation in cyprus . 
  it assumes that both parts are in equal standing and equally in control of their affairs . 
  but this is not the case . 
  turkey has de facto annexed northern cyprus , occupying it against international law . 
  it used to be both sides that did this but greece withdrew from cyprus , which the whole world agrees is a soveirn , democratic country with jurisdiction over the whole of cyprus . 
  the north is effectively already part of turkey and there is no reason the for the south to unify with greece as we both are effectively unified under the european union .
