  perfecting evs and ivs in pokemon hands down . 
  it 's one of the hardest thing to do in gaming but boy is it rewarding !, 
  this is actually too good . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/83rgz ) is more like it .

  [ you win !, 
  this is gold !, 
  why make a rule if you know that it is going to be broken though ? 
  i am not trying to jail theists or pretty much anyone from having any belief , be it rational or irrational . 
  after all our understanding constantly changes , and ideas that one day seem absurd , the next day may be proven to be true !, 
  i just utterly fail to understand why people who dedicate their life to god , become priests , hurt themselves or others in the name of religion are n't treated as mentally ill automatically , and we must debate what 's wrong with them , or sometimes even celebrate them , or act shocked when it turns out they do drugs or fuck children or kill others for no reason . 
  society 's view of religion must change , not religions themselves . 
  because yes , there are people out there who are pathologically afraid of their own human nature . 
  they are dangerous and instead of ostracizing them , we celebrate them . 
  that 's not ok . 
   you could try keeping people against their will and brainwashing them, 
  so atheist indoctrination and brainwashing ? 
  i do n't want that in the slightest !, 
  in a world where god is proven to exist and i was the irrational one , that would be wrong !, 
  but in our world where the entire belief system of all known religions is utter nonsense , is telling people what we know is real and what we know is right , really indoctrination and brainwashing ? 
  i know the feel . 
  as a person who buys everything nintendo because he enjoys nintendo games more than anything else , but is also sane , i avoid nintendo fanboys like the plague . 
  especially zelda and metroid guys are the worst . 
  i for one do n't understand why it 's a [ bug type move ] ( http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/u-turn ) ... 
  i mean ... 
  honestly who decides these things ? 
  you are projecting so fucking hard it hurts . 
  first of all , i am not the one who does n't understand , ok ? 
  religion is n't hard to understand , in fact , it 's more like the dumb-mans philosophy . 
  sure , religion is in general , pretty harmful but that 's no argument , and this is n't a debate about why religion is immoral or bad for society , or what religions impact on society is in general . 
  i never went there . 
  the point i am trying to make is why religion is bad for the individual . 
  why , like all things people are meant to have a reasonable fear of death but people who are afraid of death or their sinfulness to the extend of telling lies to themselves , wasting their life hurting themselves for those things to go away , are psychotic beyond doubt , and why society should n't treat those people as normal . 
  frankly i ca n't coexist with those people , much in the same way i ca n't coexist with a bunch of psychopaths . 
  and no , i wo n't `` shut up '' about it . 
  this is n't me `` bitching '' or `` nagging '' , this is a legitimate concern i have based on reason , and if you do n't have anything reasonable to say , do n't say anything . 
  finally , the downvote button on reddit exists so that you can help the community get the most out of discussions by marking comments that are unhelpful or unrelated to the discussion . 
  it 's not a `` i dislike this '' or `` i disagree with this '' button . 
  [ the old town of corfu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/corfu_town_r02.jpg ), 
  a medieval city on the western most inhabited island of greece . 
  it is a unesco world heritage sight . 
  the island of corfu is between the ionian and the adriatic sea , and it is the capital of one of greeces 13 peripheries , the ionian islands . 
  image is really big . 
  it 's [ cc ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:corfu_town_r02.jpg ) and it 's really pretty too !, 
  humans are irrational species . 
  people will make stories to explain things they do n't understand , or things they do n't want to understand . 
  having said that i still stand by my notion . 
  obsession with death and the afterlife , pathological fears and hallucinations , ad well as objection of reality and causing damage to themselves and others are common in very religious people , a sign that some of them are mentally ill . 
  i do n't know why ... but i do n't like it . 
  if it is n't blue and white it does n't feel greek to me . 
  i wish you were here earlier , these were the kind of comments i wanted to see . 
  we used to identify as romans ( \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af ) until the 1930s . 
  then greek nationalism entered the stage and changed that . 
  still , if there 's something about this that does n't inspire me in red and yellow . 
  is there a sub of psychologists where we can have a civilized discussion about this , where maybe some people who know better will weight in ? 
  none of the 2 really . 
  for eez to really matter , neighboring countries must agree that it does , since ones eez is n't exactly a unilateral claim . 
  map 2 is far more substantial though . 
  it is based on the median line principle of the law of the seas which is the one used by default all over the world . 
  it has the backing of the eu and the uns authority of the law of the sea . 
  you 'll see on every eez map issued by international bodies , and it 's part of the eus operations in the mediterranean , as well as the `` energy union '' of the eu . 
  the [ airspace ] ( https://defensegr.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ti_einai_to_fir_04.jpg ) in this part of the mediterranean as well as shipping lanes are already controlled de jure by greece based on the median line principle , so for turkey to push for 1 at this point is really impossible . 
  so 2 is de facto the eez boundaries , even if turkey insists on unofficially claiming 1 . 
  and turkey seems to know this for the case of greece as they only ever violate the cypriot eez which too does n't make sense , but they do it anyway for power projection in cyprus .

  i am an icon designer . 
  this shit makes me hard . 
  if it was an icon or a banner or a logo it would have won a design competition or something . 
  but a flag ? 
  no , just no . 
  there no capacity for meaning here . 
  just 3 islands in an island chain of many . 
  the sun is a good element but the whole thing falls apart with the differentiation of colours so fast ... 
  good designs on paper do n't make for good flags . 
  this design is not simple enough ( yes it 's not simple enough , count the colours needed to make this out of fabric ! ), 
  or meaningful enough . 
  as a flag it would come out childish more than anything . 
  so good job !, 
  this is some material design thing you have there !, 
  i upvoted because i really like the design . 
  do n't put that on a flag !, 
   because op does n't understand why they believe, 
  much in the same way i fail to understand how a psychopath things and why they think this way . 
  sure , i can read about it , i can even study it . 
  but at the end of the day i 'll never truly understand it , because i am not a psychopath . 
  similarly i can spend my entire life exposed to and studying zeus and the kraken , but i 'll never understand how people actually believe in these stuff because i am a properly adjusted human being . 
  as of the rest of what you said i truly agree . 
   why not greece ? 
  many reasons . 
  mainly seismic activity and the fact that greek governments generally shy away from having nuclear weapons or power plants in greece in fear of an accident . 
  not really geopolitical reasons , and it certainly is n't a matter of range . 
  i think these are icbms .

  you know what ? 
  i have been having tons of fun with this game for 3 years now , and i admit it . 
  this game does n't have much depth , i wo n't defend something the game does n't have , like a fanboy . 
  there really is n't any strategy , or need for effective team composition , or any competitive aspect to this game , so if you 're looking for those things , do n't play warframe . 
  i know building warframes and focus skills and arkaning are aspects that are really complicated and you can do a ton of things , and it requires a lot of trial and error to nail a loadout that really clicks with your playstyle . 
  but at the end of the day it 's not deep at all . 
  because all of these decisions happen outside of combat .
