  basically today i finally got the decision to buy the parts and build this beauty but i plan to do it in about 3 or 4 months so my question is , should i wait for the new generation of gpus from amd and nvidia provided that they are in about the same price or should i go for the one i selected ? 
  i am hoping that this build will stay strong for a minimum of a good 4 years and run most games in high settings before needing any kind of upgrade . 
  what do you think ? 
  so i am building a new pc and trying to find alternatives for my old one which i built 3 years ago and i thought it might be a good idea to convert it to hackintosh . 
  should i try to do it ? 
  how serious are the problems i may face in the process of doing it ? 
  do i put my hardware on risk ? 
  but the main question is , are the parts good for that purpose ? 
  pardon me but i 'm new to this hackintosh idea and i would like to try because i like the mac os .

  so basically i have spent quite some time selecting the best parts i could and everything but today i found some great offer from the shop down the street about the hyperx fury black 2x8gb 2400mhz for -37 % ( about 30 $ less than the corsair lpx one i have on my list ) . 
  so my questions are , should i go for it ? 
  is there a big performance difference between the corsair one and the hyperx one ? 
  also is the hyperx one low profile ? 
  because my cooler is very big and i will need low profile ram . 
  basically i am trying to save as much money as i can from this build without compromising quality . 
  thanks in advance .
