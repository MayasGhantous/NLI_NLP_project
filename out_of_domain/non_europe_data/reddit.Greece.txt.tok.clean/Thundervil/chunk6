  so basically my friend asked me to build him a pc since he does n't know much about it on which he can play the games i mentioned above on 1080p 60fps and maybe some more demanding titles on 1080p with no lag on medium to high settings ( like doom or something ) . 
  the parts cost about 880 euros in greece and basically some of the best i could find . 
  he does n't want to wait for newer gpus becuse the price will be high here for a few months and it will exceed the budget . 
  so basically i am building a new system and after a lot of research i decided to go with the be quiet !, 
  dark rock pro 3 to use with my 6600k . 
  on my previous build i went with the corsair h60 as i was hyped for watercooling but turned out that the cooler was very very loud even when the cpu was on idle with fan on minimum speed and low temperatures ( ~ 30c @ 4ghz i5-2500k ) . 
  so my question is that should i go with the be quiet !, 
  cooler ? 
  i 'm really going to push the 6600k a lot and i want good temps with very low noise and even maybe inaudible when running on idle . 
  what other quiet and effective air or aio cooler would you suggest ? 
  preferably not more than $ 150 . 
  so basically i 'm building my friend a budget pc for some light gaming like hearthstone and csgo mostly . 
  which cpu has better performance of these two ? 
  i see that the i3 has a very big clock speed while the i5 has a smaller clock speed . 
  which one should i pick ? 
  so today spotify tried to renew my subscription but my card is empty and since i am abroad i can not put money in it . 
  how long will spotify keep trying to renew my subscription until it cancels it ? 
  thanks in advance . 
  ### troubleshooting help :, 
  ** what is your parts list ? 
  [ consider formatting your parts list . 
  ** describe your problem . 
  list any error messages and symptoms . 
  be descriptive . 
  so today after a while i finished my build and i tried to install windows 7 on it . 
  it says windows is loading files and lets me press install now but then i get an error that it ca n't find the drive or files are missing . 
  i tried different usb ports and still the same . 
  then i tried installing windows 10 in case this flash drive was corrupted and this time it let me choose partition and when it went to 5 % of the second step of the installation it gave me an error that files are missing . 
  i do n't know what to do . 
  ** list anything you 've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem . 
  i tried the microsoft website and it says that the usb drive is probably corrupted but two weeks ago i used both of them to install windows on my laptop and they worked perfectly . 
  ** post relevant photos of build/parts here . 
  replace this text with your answer . 
  ** provide any additional details you wish below . 
  sorry for the formatting i 'm on my phone . 
  so last night i finished my pc and it turns on fine and it goes into the bios etc but when i try to install windows 7 it loads the files and when i press install now it gives me an error that it could n't find a cd/dvd drive . 
  when i try to install windows 10 i get the same error on a different step like the second step after the installation has begun and reached 5 % . 
  the usb drives i 'm using ca n't be corrupted as microsoft suggests as i used them to install windows on my laptop just fine a couple of weeks ago . 
  any help ? 
  thanks . 
  edit : specs are in this list : http://pcpartpicker.com/user/thundervil/saved/449hp6, 
  here are a few photos of it and the part list :, 
  thank you guys for your help !, 
  so basically i 'm here with my friend and we opened up his pc to admire it blah blah so i saw his i/o shield and i remembered how shit mine is and how much time i spent installing it ( probably incorrectly because i did n't have any instructions and google was n't helpful ) . 
  so my question is why do n't motherboards come with the i/o shield mounted on them from the box ? 
  is there any specific reason ? 
  edit : i mean mounted on the motherboard obviously not the case itself . 
  so i am new to this subreddit and gpu overclocking mostly and maybe overclocking on general . 
  so anyway , to the point . 
  i downloaded the cam software by nzxt so i can tweak my hue + and it has a tab where you can overclock your gpu . 
  has anyone tried it ? 
  because the only thing i saw on the side bar is the msi afterburner as the recommended one . 
  i want to overclock my sapphire r9 390 at some point and i 'm just looking for the best software and settings i guess . 
  also is there any better software ? 
  thanks, 
  hello people , today i went to a bar and had a very nice cocktail that had a strong bubble gum flavor and i really liked it . 
  does anyone have a good recipe for that ? 
  i really want to make it myself too . 
  thanks . 
  basically i have been using the 5x for 7 months now and i had the timeline on in google maps since the beginning . 
  i have noticed that the path it draws is really messed up and it does n't follow the roads i take . 
  same happens to a friend of mine that uses the 5x . 
  anyone else has the same problem ? 
  any fixes ? 
  thanks . 
  hello people , i recently started vaping and i am pretty new , i am buying a joyetech evic vtwo mini in a couple of weeks and i need help finding some good cheap sub ohm tank , i am not interested in making my own coils and stuff like that , i just want a tank that i can put ready coils and that 's it . 
  thanks in advance . 
  as the title says , i am buying the joyetech evic vtwo mini from a friend and i am looking for a sub ohm tank that works well with this mod , produces much vapor and gives nice taste . 
  not looking for anything rebuildable !, 
  thanks in advance for your help . 
  i am basically buying a new mod and want something powerful that also gives kind of nice taste . 
  i have tried the obs t-vct before and is good but does n't have as powerful coils as the melo 3 . 
  on the other side i have seen a lot of reviews that say the melo 3 coils do n't give any taste at all but other than that it 's a great subohm tank . 
  which one should i get ? 
  ( i can get the melo 3 for 10 euros less ) , the mod i am getting is the joyetech evic vtwo mini . 
  thanks in advance !,

  hello guys , i have an i5-6600k and an asus z170-a and i have had them for a few months now so i decided it 's time to start playing with the overclock . 
  my cpu runs at 3.9 ghz by default since the day i built the pc because it 's the turbo boost frequency . 
  i ca n't find how turn it off in bios , can someone help ? 
  or i can just overclock with it enabled ? 
  thanks a lot .
