  this would be straight up stealing , and thus many greeks with knowledge of the situation have withdrawn their euros ( if they believe that the euro crisis wont turn contagious ) or opened swiss frank accounts . 
  * ( the us could have done so a couple of weeks in advance of them ) *, 
  sources ? 
  * so why did we let them get a quarter of germany at all ? 
  why did we let them get eastern europe at all ? 
  i 'm sure the whole soviet army being stationed there had nothing to do with it, 
  not really , people are generally attracted to exotic features ( for example blue eyes in southern countries / dark eyes in northern countries , asian people in western countries and vice versa ) . 
  the term exotic is erotically charged to some degree . 
  it is n't a big leap of faith to imagine that our brains lump together accent with body characteristics when deciding to add the ` exotic ' tag to a person . 
  of course cultural conditioning could play an equal or even larger role ( racism/nationalism , eg the subconscious feeling of uncleanliness of an ethnic group ) , you ca n't disregard culture or evolution as factors . 
  because obama is a socialist and nazis are like communists and iraq had wmd etc etc, 
  i remembered the article immediately after i read counter-insurgency . 
  bravo good sir for a great link, 
  was that a serious answer to my sarcasm ? 
  there are numerous fascistic tendencies within the us as well , the patriot act for instance . 
  interesting , care to back it up ? 
  nationalist rage much ? 
  a chinese team won . 
  meh , the second are just bitcoin speculators trying to make the currency more popular , just so they can get rich by selling their huge stacks of bitcoins . 
  not sure why the downvotes . 
  i suppose they have heard some underground pussy riot mix tape . 
  yep , but i prefer to think of them as the results of meat boy getting intimate with close relatives . 
  seriously , why would any non professional need a `` top brand bike '' ? 
  prototyping and storyboards , how do they work ? 
  and enough people doing it would make a difference , but the new american mentality is each for himself . 
  ergo , upvoted comments failing to see how you would n't be alone in your protest .

  `` during the soviet era . '', 
  thank you . 
  hey , ksizzle . 
  `` engineers are nerds '' circlejerk in progress . 
  please do n't interrupt . 
  yes , defend . 
  check range . 
  always prototype/storyboard and show to client before going on with the actual design . 
  this is hci 101, 
  function checkbrowser ( ) {, 
  ( ( browsername = = `` netscape '' & & browserver  = 5 ) | | ( browsername = = `` microsoft internet explorer '' & & browserver  = 5 ) | | ( browsername = = `` opera '' & & browserver  = 9 ) ) ) {, 
  alert ( ` browser outdated ' ) ;, 
  unless its atheism bashing . 
  then we are cool . 
  well said , in my experience only javascript can teach you what dom is . 
  starting with jquery is like learning html/css by using twitter bootstrap, 
  scripting languages are easier to learn , a big tutorial and you start coding . 
  jsp on the other hand implies you know java , which takes a while to fully understand . 
  for simple websites with light server side needs , php is ok . 
  but when speed/scalability comes into play , php falters . 
  that being said it boggles my mind why facebook is built on php . 
  why did i read that < edit  title < / edit  with a thick russian accent ? 
  that 's petty as fuck . 
  imagine a program you really want to build in a particular language . 
  start building through trial and error and online resources . 
  you may fail , that is part of the learning process . 
  just go for it until you lose interest . 
  repeat from step 1, 
  what is the cartoonist trying to convey ? 
  that lennon is trolling us ? 
  is he pictured as a gritty realist pushing idealistic notions in others minds , just to see them burn ? 
  most probably he just does n't understand the meaning of trololo , or he is trying to score some easy e-cred . 
  gooby pls , following memes through know-your-meme doesnt make you an expert . 
  to elaborate : the video is widely used to imply a successful trolling attempt . 
  plus the lyrics arent even reading trololo so your argument falls flat from its premise, 
  i had some good laughs with dolan pics , but its more of a 4chan material . 
  too graphic for non anonymous image boards . 
  i would argue that the ` you should feel bad ' meme is more cancerous , because it is vastly more overused than dolan ( partly due to point a ) . 
  but friendly jab on cancer got right in the feels . 
  upvotes . 
  [ rubber duck debugging ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubber_duck_debugging ), 
  do n't fret man . 
  we are all within 2 standard deviations from the mean programmer . 
  the angle of the keyboard is over 9000, 
  but one line of js can remove substrings between + and @ before submitting the form :(, 
  its sad from an academic perspective when invention is equalized to commercialization, 
  agreed , you can not compare countries ' records , because police procedures and legal definitions vary widely . 
  '' . .17 kidnaps per 100,000 people in australia in 2010 and 12.7 in canada . 
  that compares with only 0.6 in colombia and 1.1 in mexico . '', 
  is c # used in the industry , or is it all c++ ? 
  that reminded me that i never finished ` the brothers karamazov ', 
  why the ` guilty until proven innocent ' mentality ? 
  the 4chan boards are anonymous : no registration , no logins , nicknames optional ( and commonly frowned upon ) . 
  so you call each other anon ( or fag , but usually reserved for op ) . 
  why am i shocked to learn that many people never made their own fruit juice ? 
  serious question . 
  is there a shortage of apples/oranges in america ? 
  edit : i was about to have a cultural shock , thanks for putting my mind at ease . 
  writing ` with a gui made in visual basic ' is like saying i can find your number in the phonebook with glasses made from tortoiseshell . 
  i was full wtf until i understood the cultural reference, 
  it looked like a loaded question from my perspective . 
  learning js by using frameworks is unacceptable imho . 
  you have many undefined variables , mainly when calling gettotal . 
  you did n't rename them all successfully ( variables should n't look greyish in jsfiddle ) . 
  shh , everyone here has a firm grasp on the philosophy of ethics , and adheres to singer 's views on animal liberation . 
  jk , anthropomorphizing another species , lol reddit, 
  you mean 90 % are tinytrip zyzz and how do i alpha threads . 
  when fitness is concerned `` lol newfag read the sticky '', 
  now if she said `` wan na bust a nut '' . . 
  an arbitrary lower bound must be set at one point on the enhancement property . 
  depending on it , dosages of caffeine could count as a drug or not . 
  implying 10 years have passed since the great furry war . 
  brace yourself , the contrarians are about to defend armstrong .
