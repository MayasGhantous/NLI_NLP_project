  you should be applauding him on this one actually . 
  please come back with serious points you did n't pull off of the_donald . 
  i feel like all trumpets come with the exact same shit points , and it 's getting boring . 
  enjoy the alternative reality . 
  while trump loses on every executive order in regards to immigration , takes golfing vacations than most presidents , hits a 36 % low favorability rate , makes up invoices and send them to germany , and fails on healthcare , dems are laughing and getting him impeached soon . 
  because in the future the senate may not be theirs , and the democrats would be able to push a future justice nomination with 51 votes . 
  the republicans would be unable to filibuster . 
  had the democrats extended the filibuster rule they changed for everything in 2013 to include the supreme court , today we would not be having this discussion - garland would have been appointed . 
  edit : apparently i am wrong . 
  garland would have not been appointed because the dems did not have a majority . 
  however , the nuclear option would allow dems in the future to nominate people without needing 60 votes . 
  this possibly could hurt the republicans , too . 
  i love this quote , especially what i love about this is how it relates to how the ancient athenians treated the other , smaller city states . 
  so theft !, 
  well is n't that convenient . 
  when you listen to music over spotify , spotify has to pay royalties to the music industry on your behalf . 
  as a free user , you would normally have to listen to ads that target you , and pay spotify for that service . 
  spotify then uses that revenue to pay the royalties you used . 
  so when smartasses like yourself use spotify 's service for free , but circumvent the ads , spotify can not use ad revenue to pay for the royalties you used . 
  this is indeed theft , regardless of what you tell yourself . 
  i own them , and they are great . 
  they have excellent placement in your ear , so even if you 're running they do not fall out easily at all . 
  definitely recommend . 
  along with the 750,000 deaths of pontic greeks . 
  you should read the articles you post as responses . 
  it says right in your article :, 
  `` by the end of 1922 , the vast majority of native asia minor greeks had fled the recent greek genocide ( 1914 -- 1922 ) '' . 
  what a fabulous exchange . 
  this is why there is no real greek minority in turkey today , but the `` muslim greek '' minority of thrace lives on . 
  it 's a site greek americans like to read because it caters to them almost exclusively . 
  it 's in english , and often writes articles that are very alarmist . 
  no one should really respect the `` greek reporter '' . 
  they make money by ad clicks . 
  in other words , the more people they can scare into clicking onto their ad , the more money they make . 
  when greece does n't allow private institutions to exist/be equal to those of their own , when greece routinely makes the lives of foreigners looking to invest in the country difficult , and when greece routinely blocks private acquisitions of badly state run companies , this is not `` propaganda '' , this is just plain old stupidity . 
  i went to a private college/university in greece . 
  i also worked in the greek private sector . 
  i also know hundreds of people that would love to invest in greece . 
  i discourage every single one of them . 
  why invest in greece ? 
  so you can be taxed into oblivion , and pay the salaries of ridiculous public servants ? 
  be taxed into oblivion without a reasonable access to some form of citizenship ? 
  and what will you do to enforce contracts when the courts are backed up for the next 10 years ? 
  exactly , even the legal system is practically inexistent . 
  greece sucks , and not because of papachela 's `` propaganda '' greece sucks because of the majority of greeks themselves . 
  there is a reason why greeks do exceptionally outside of greece , and that is because we do n't live in greece . 
  we have a beautiful country , great people , vibrant culture and the worst run state in the eu - and that is all the fault of the greeks my friend . 
  ** rant over , i love you guys **, 
  the article op linked is not solely about debt , it is also about how cyprus is n't dumb and makes policy based off practical knowledge . 
  cypriots did not oppose opening up their educational market because they saw the benefits in doing so . 
  when greece tried the same several times in the past , greek leftists burnt down athens several times . 
  my response to you is not about the debt issue , but about the political willingness of both cypriot politicians , and cypriot residents to make meaningful change - something you dismissed as papachela 's `` propaganda '' . 
  friend , i am not failing to understand that . 
  i understand the economics behind the countries . 
  what i am focusing on is something very much irrelevant to the economic situation of the countries , but very much relevant to the posted article - meaningful policy change does n't cost very much . 
  greece could be more like cyprus and liberate her markets . 
  greece chose not to do this , which is an implied choice is denying herself the extra money and jobs that cyprus is now getting because they did make this choice . 
  the fact that greece is economically bankrupt ( morally bankrupt is another conversation ) does not estop her from being progressive and friendly to business . 
  perhaps greece would be less of an insolvent state had she followed similar policies that cyprus did . 
  an article today on greece relayed the fact that public servants now on average make more money than the average private sector employee . 
  let that sink in for a minute , and then wonder where to money to pay these employees comes from . 
  i am not sure why you keep bringing up the issue of debt . 
  sure , greece would do better if she was not practically bankrupt , but that has little to no effect on what i , or papachelas are saying above . 
  `` find me a country ... in recent history '' : i am not convinced this matters at all . 
  why do n't you find me a country which has a similar broken system of politics and no appetite for basic reform that is also successful ? 
  `` reforms do n't make magical money '' : they do n't . 
  that does n't mean we should n't do them , or should not have done them much earlier . 
  you seem to think that in order for greece to perform meaningful policy change , she needs debt reduction/write off . 
  where i will agree greece needs a fair debt write off , i do not agree that she needs it to perform basic policy change . 
  opening up the educational market , allowing all stores to set their own schedules , releasing the energy market , allowing foreigners to invest easily , and privatizing business the state does not know how to run ** has nothing to do with our debt problems . 
  we did n't make these changes when we had money , and we continue not to even now ** . 
  making these changes costs literally zero euros . 
  what worries me the most about greece is the mindset ; if greece were to be given a 100 % debt write off , we would be talking about another write off in 20 years . 
  greeks ( many , not all ) are addicted to easy money , and have nothing to show for it . 
  this is why my friend we are forced to sign memorandums , because no one trusts us . 
  let 's pretend greece was not bankrupt for a moment ; would you invest in a country that taxes private business almost 40 % to sustain a large public sector , and that showed no willingness to pass basic policy reform ? 
  that is incorrect . 
  the eu/imf do not ask greece to explicitly raise taxes . 
  they ask greece to find x amount of money . 
  greece can do so by firing people in the public sector , minimizing their salaries , privatizing assets , spending less on the welfare state , or raising taxes . 
  syriza chose to raise taxes , whilst it continues to hire people to the public sector . 
  see , syriza does n't get votes mainly from the private sector , it gets them from the people that work in the public sector which it protects . 
  now there 's nothing wrong with protecting workers , as long as it is not done at the expense of everyone else . 
  comparing the size of the german public sector , or that of france to greece is entirely a silly concept . 
  ** germany and france are eu powerhouses , and we do n't produce anything . 
  ** we can not afford a large ( and inefficient ) public sector . 
  they can ( even though theirs is not as inefficient ) . 
  do use a metaphor , it 's like you are spending $ 100 on your phone bill , and when asked to cut it , or make it lower , you point to your rich neighbor and say `` well imf/eu , germany has a $ 100 phone bill !, 
  why ca n't i ?! '' . 
  we do n't have money . 
  we are n't really producing any either . 
  moreover , we are not really making all the necessary policy changes i have been talking about . 
  however , we seem hell bent on maintaining a large , inefficient public sector . 
  if that does n't seem fucked to everyone involved , i am not sure what else to point out . 
  oh , and per wikipedia , our public is larger than that of germany : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_sector, 
  an excellent mindset !, 
  the fear of having some elites master the market ( an unjustified fear , btw ) permits taking a collective shit on all greeks , business , and legal fairness . 
  you realize these eastern countries suffered years of oppressive communist rule and are the way they are , whereas greece did not ? 
  it is ** embarrassing ** to compare greece to eastern europe . 
  we should be comparing to the netherlands , spain , portugal , and even italy .
