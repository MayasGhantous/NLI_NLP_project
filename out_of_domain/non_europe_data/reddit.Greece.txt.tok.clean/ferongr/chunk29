  regardless , the question is worded like shit . 
  twisted 26g at 0.43 ? 
  are those dual coils ? 
  i use twisted 26g extensively and mine always end up around 0.9 to 1 ohms ( 8-9 wraps with 3mm id ) . 
  well , triple-twisted 26g ends up as a massive wire that 's hard to put in most rtas , or even 22mm drippers . 
  i build 0.8 to 1 ohms in most of my single-coil rtas , 26ga twisted , 8-10 wraps with 3mm id . 
  40 to 60w easy . 
  it 's an okay mod but battery life is in no way as good as 3 lg hg2s would suggest ( i only get around 25-30 % more vape time compared to my sig 150w where i use old 25rs , board has low efficiency and mod gets warm during use ) , the temp control implementation is mediocre and due to losses on the cables connecting the batteries , it does n't discharge them completely balanced , there 's a 0.03-0 .05 v variance between slots . 
  i 'm using my serpent daily and have no leaking issues with it . 
  yes , the juice flow control does not seal hermetically and you have to turn the tank upside down before opening it after filling but it 's otherwise performing very well . 
  i have 3 lemo 2s , been using them since last may around 40-60w and have no dry hit issues with 80vg juice . 
  i just cut my cotton flush with the chimney threads , drop it on the shelf and after i screw on the lower part of the chimney , poke the cotton so the juice channels are visible . 
   i 'm sure they do . 
  in fact , they can easily get hot enough to explode in your car if you 're stupid enough to leave your mod out in basically a greenhouse in the sun, 
  not really , otherwise cordless powertools that experience a lot more abuse and greater currents would explode left and right . 
  i do n't like bitdefender because they include some kind of web filter with a kernel driver or something ( since it does not rely on a browser extension or local proxy ) , that i can not disable . 
  if a cell can not reach 4.20 v under charge i think you have bigger problems than old age . 
  would n't that indicate a badly damaged cell with problems in the internal insulators ? 
  such a cell would discharge on its own very quickly . 
  i may be the minority but i do n't really care about that . 
  i prefer plaintext , easily copyable tracking numbers that i can paste into the 17track tab i have open , that tracks all my packages from different countries using different carriers . 
  thanks for the giveaway !, 
  welcome to europe , where we get paid less yet pay more for goods ( universally ) , getting services by the state that vary in quality in return .

  juice is not `` born '' . 
  it 's manufactured . 
  it 's been some time ( a year or more ) since i last used my account and found out that my us infantryman is missing the garand ( it 's not purchased ) . 
  is this normal ? 
  anything with caramel . 
  it 's also reflected on the juice i mix . 
  it 's also quite noisy stock , and even with the post airflow drilled , still noisy . 
  it 's a good tank though , wicks extremely well ( tried up to 60w with it ) and looks like a boutique european rta . 
  it looks pretty nice . 
  knowing the usable height of the tank would be good . 
  the pack looks deformed from getting jammed inside the box * shivers *, 
  also , on the sigelei all contacts are very well separated from the body and completely covered by batteries , it 's practically impossible for the cover to create any problems . 
  smpl clone . 
  excellent conductivity ( handles 0.15 ohm builds nicely ) , smooth button ( that requires maintenance though ) and excellent finish . 
  sadly , it 's discontinued . 
  magnets are not `` better '' , they 're different . 
  and honestly , when it comes to mod switches , it 's more about machining tolerances and quality , not whether it has a magnet or spring . 
  where can i buy a tenkeyless board with browns in europe ( greece ) ? 
  i do n't really care about brands or keycap modding , but it would be preferred ( but not mandatory ) that the board did n't have edgy gaming design . 
  also , backlight is unnecessary since i know how to type . 
  anywhere up to 150 $ or so . 
  the majestouch 2 from keyboardco ends up very expensive with shipping . 
  right now i 'm between the kul es-87 and the kbp v-80 . 
  i do n't care about the dip-switches on the kul or the backlight on the kbp , but i 've read that the kul 's legends fade . 
  i assume that the kbp 's legends wo n't fade due to the construction to allow light to pass through ? 
  if yes , then barring any quality problems with the kbp , i 'm gon na go with that . 
  that 's where i was going to get them from originally both out of stock . 
  i changed my mind a second time and in the end i will probably get the filco m2 tkl from keyboardco since a full-sized board is no good for my desk . 
   these cc sanctions are illegal to begin with and there have been a few winning cases in courts already . 
  tell me about it . 
  my mastercard is useless for purchasing online even if i have n't gone over the transaction limit . 
  i 'm forced to wire funds to revolut and use their virtual mastercard . 
  curiously , one specific purchase on the european steelseries shop went though without issues , but an attempted purchase at keyboardco failed . 
  it 's quite easy . 
  after registering on the app you just wire money to the iban account shown in the app , taking care to complete the reference field correctly ( since that number is the one that identifies your transfer as belonging to your account ) . 
  after the funds tranfer , they 're immidiately available inside the app , at which point you can use the virtual debit mastercard as any other card online . 
  you can also wire funds from the app to other accounts ( or your own if you want to unload leftover funds in the app ) . 
  i 've had no issues with revolut as a service . 
  it 's also a lot faster than my bank at processing refunds . 
  also , as a plus , the virtual mastercard does not have the crappy 3d secure `` protection '' my normal card has . 
  they should fix the feature in my opinion . 
  this option does n't disable downclocking outside of gaming , i 've already installed the update and verified that . 
  the feature seems to try to reduce power consumption during gaming , but is badly implemented and results in performance/smoothness issues . 
  that 's what they should fix . 
  the difference is something like 1 line of code . 
  in firefox , disabled extensions are essentially not loaded at all so the difference between disabling an extension and removing it is none when it comes to code that may depend on the extension running . 
  mozilla has been adamant that there has been no monetary compensation for including the pocket functionality . 
  furthermore , if they cared about money so much that they would restrict the users ' freedoms , the first thing they would do would be to lock down the search engine . 
  the white/black model looks very nice . 
  i assume the paint has a glossy finish , it would looks the best that way . 
  i dunno , i personally find low-floor systems very uncomfortable to ride . 
  it seems like the bogies are rigidly attached to the cars , resulting in lots of vibrations and lateral shaking . 
  a lot more uncofortable than buses for example . 
  and it also seems like they have to move slower if track geometry is n't perfect . 
  maybe it 's regional but wheelchair users are very rare here in greece ( not a normal occurence ) so i never thought that was a real issue . 
  is there a greater percentage of disabled people in the us or something ? 
  we do have disability ramps and level platforms here too , it 's just that they 're not used enough to plan different rolling stock around them . 
  and as typical for us europeans , we 're gon na take it lying down without even complaining . 
  advocacy is not in continental european dna and the masses are complacent . 
  meanwhile , my 2012 system upgraded with a 100 $ i5 from ebay and a 390 ...

  if i run tron on a freshly-restored laptop ( from the built-in image ) without any windows 7 updates installed , would the telemetry/windows 10 updates be blacklisted ? 
  i just tried this . 
  after running tron on a freshly-restored windows 7 laptop , going through the windows update phase , restarting and checking for updates manually , the windows 10/telemetry updates where available and ready to be installed , so the blacklisting does n't work probably . 
  my 390 ( flair ) is truly a heavy beast of a card but it 's really solid . 
  even when applying moderate force on the top of the card when mounted into the case it wo n't move a millimeter . 
  no worries , it only took 10 minutes to filter them out and hide them by hand . 
  now people in ankara can too fall asleep listening to the mediocre , uninteresting music produced by daralas . 
  i 'm waiting for a cm qf rapid-i . 
  does a black/dolch pbt double-shot keyset exist that allows for backlight to shine through ?
