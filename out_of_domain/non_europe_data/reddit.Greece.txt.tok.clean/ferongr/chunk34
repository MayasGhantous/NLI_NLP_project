  while freesync is nice when gaming , for everything else ( watching video , browsing the web etc ) , nothing beats the performance of ips displays . 
  there exists a cheap ips freesync monitor ( the lg 23mp68vq-p ) but it 's an unknown quality at this time ( cheap lg ips displays are not really that good ) . 
  europe is not a a country . 
  it 's not even a homogenous region . 
  regardless , here in greece data is extremely expensive , many people only use wifi when possible and the most reliable method of contacting someone using text is with sms . 
  also , in `` my '' europe , whatsapp is quite rare and fb messenger is more widespread , but not enough to call it universal . 
  i bet the bottom bezel is twice the size it normally is to compensate . 
  my brain is full of fuck, 
  not true . 
  professionals recalibrate their displays at least every year since even ips displays shift over time plus the backlight ( whether wled , rgbled or ccfl ) dims with time . 
  the lg ui is an abomination . 
  i do n't know , my sd card is working fine for a multitude of uses . 
  i can put 60gb of shows , 20gb of music and a few gigs of comics in mine ( in addition to storing videos and photos from the camera that are not small in size ) and it all works well . 
  yes , it 's included in the electricity bill . 
  sadly , there 's no easy way . 
  i do n't have a tv either but i ca n't do anything about the `` contributory fee '' ( it 's not a `` license '' to consume the content but rather , a fee for the institution itself ) . 
  that 's correct . 
  `` contributory fee '' is a direct translation of '' \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 '' , maybe it does n't translate that well . 
  yep . 
  too bad voice commands are pretty much a gimmick and generally annoying for people around you ( useful if one lives in his mother 's basement though ) . 
   stop being a pushover, 
  `` do n't touch the audio jack '' should be enough . 
  if they keep being dicks , stop by the side of the road and tell them to exit the car . 
  my mother owns the variant without the s-pen and i can honestly say that 2gb is enough for the device as it 's configured . 
  multitasking is no problem and the device performs very well . 
  it 's also very cheap for the 250 euro price and short of buying a chinese device , the best device with those specs . 
  only few ones that actually matter and can actually be called friends , rather than acquaintances . 
  the t-580 ( same device without stylus ) runs very well . 
  copypasting an older comment i wrote some time ago . 
  this is from an older [ post asking about pickpocketing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/4y7wyv/hi_rgreece_whats_up_with_all_the_pickpocketing/ ) but it also applies to tagging and vandalism , and why offenders are not prosecuted . 
   in greece what most other civilized countries call enforcing the law , we call '' \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae '' or `` repression '' . 
  it 's a deeply ingrained cultural artifact that was born during the civil war and amplified during the junta that has been capitalized upon by left governments . 
  with the stranglehold the left and the far-left have on university politics and the high percentage of greeks with higher education , i 'm not sure if this cultural trait can ever be removed . 
  not a stranglehold , but rather , academia predominantly identifies with far leftist ideals and various radical elements dominate political discourse . 
  furthermore , lack of policing in campuses amplifies the climate of lawlessness and that breeds more radicals . 
  i can confirm this . 
  it seems to trigger when fullscreen exclusive mode reliably for me , when in fse and doing something that temporarily exits it ( e.g. 
  right clicking for the context menu ) .

  the equivalent of wot 's yolorush,

  that 's mostly fanboys patting each other on their back these days . 
   x-post / r/greekamerica, 
  thanks, 
  s5 neo does n't have them . 
  point being , a removable back can be water resistant . 
  anything to make memory accesses faster is worth it . 
  back to watching 80s mecha, 
   make the hardware home button a capacitive button, 
  i 'd hate that . 
  the hardware button provides a place for the thumb to rest at some situations , without actuatingit . 
  it has no disadvantages . 
  i 've never seen a samsung device with a broken homebutton . 
  they tend to be very durable . 
  you should direct your crusade towards the power button . 
  that 's the part tends to break more ( it 's actuated a lot more over the course of a device 's life ) . 
  speed is nice but not everything . 
  i personally weigh openness , customization , minijacks and not having to use itunes to transfer some music files to my phone a lot higher than barely perceptible speed differences .

   hurr invalid argument durr, 
  exaggeration for comedic effect . 
  nobody cares about linus shill tips . 
  comment text is too small . 
  main page link orange lacks contrast with the background . 
  looks kinda meh . 
  i 'll keep using gimp . 
  coil whine has nothing to do with the psu , it 's the coils producing sound due to the vibration created from the pwm of the vrm . 
   just about every, 
  i 'm cringing that it suggests positive words at a car destroyed by stance cancer . 
  more 24/7 always-on microphones that will listen to your conversations in order to sell you adds . 
  does the software allow you to control everything from the deltat calculated from two sensors ( one measuring coolant , the other air temperature ) ? 
  will the hardware keep working normally without the software ( e.g. 
  booted into gnu/linux ) ? 
  does the software have monitoring and alarms for pump rpm and temperature ( with system shutdown in case of fault ) ? 
  i hope you 're not using the rx200 to read the voltages , it 's pretty inaccurate for that . 
  if they were measured with an external dmm , they are within the margin of error , but barely . 
  you have to find out whether it 's the charger 's slot that charges to a lower voltage ( easy to determine ) or the cell itself . 
  what type of charger and cells are you using ? 
  should we only comment favorably on things ? 
  i think that privacy considerations have a lot of value , greater than superficial quality reviews . 
  because i have to enter other peoples ' houses or place of business and also because some people do n't know better . 
  it 's a moral issue for me and i feel compelled to talk about it , the same as with all other moral issues ( racism , murder etc ) . 
   if i purchase a google home it is a personal decision, 
  it is but then , i do have the right to criticize you for it . 
   i believe this would be a far better world if we had less people trying to force their views on others, 
  i 'm not trying to force my opinion on anyone , i 'm just talking about it . 
  the rest of your message contains a huge strawman and is not worth addressing . 
  i feel perfectly fine criticizing people for wrong decision when it comes to these moral issues . 
  we tell people racism and sexism is morally wrong , in the same way , selling out our privacy for `` bread and circuses '' is equally wrong, 
   go to your account on google and you can see everything they are doing, 
  it 's 2016 , prism is n't a thing and the nsa does n't have racks in the datacenters of major internet companies . 
  this is not an impressive video . 
  ceramic ( or gorilla glass ) will be superior in hardness to the generic chinese cheese steel used in locally produced tools . 
  take everything / u/c4p0ne said with a grain of salt , his ideological bias is obvious ( i hope ) .
