  i love it . 
   infinite, 
  my body is ready . 
   tfw ca n't download gf, 
  have they improved the anodization of the body ? 
  the two htc 10s i 've seen irl used without a case look like 3 year old devices due to all the wear of the back . 
  it 's like a parody . 
  mhm , there 's no `` 3a usb charger '' , generally the maximum you will see specified per port is 2.4 amps and most devices will have a polyfuse or current sensing comparator to turn off the device on overload conditions . 
  far more important is for the power supply to be able to keep the voltage high at high currents ( not many do and drop towards the lower end of the usb spec , it requires well tuned feedback into the switcher ic to keep voltage stable taking in account losses in the power supply and plug ) . 
  who can resist that sweet , sweet adsense money ? 
  for $ 8 it 'd better be . 
  looks like a $ 300 chinese derivative device . 
  i ca n't imagine shelling so much money for that . 
  most `` normal '' people in my social circles like them . 
  the fanboy rock . 
  people expect value for their hard-earned cash , such entitlement , right ? 
  for you . 
  i 'm used to it too but if i look at it objectively , i can only find pros to dedicated buttons . 
  if that was true , video-oriented mirrorless cameras would not spend all that rd dosh for in-body stabilization or lens stabilization . 
  the pixel is not a premium phone . 
  no ois , no waterproofing , no inductive charging , no microsd slot , no stereo speakers , derivative design . 
  there is no optical image stabilization , there 's electronic image stabilization like on the 6p . 
  it has the disadvantages of distorting videos a bit and also can not stabilize images . 
  it 's not `` optical '' i.e. 
  using sensor shift . 
  provide a source stating otherwise . 
  this does n't say anything if the only thing he provides is opinions . 
  but then it wo n't look like a $ 300 chinese iphone clone . 
  fuck , now google 's botnet will start putting mlp shit on my recommended videos . 
  the dancing pigs problem applies to gnu/linux users too . 
  people will install insecure closed-source binaries just to watch dancing pigs ( or whatever crappy show netflix airs ) . 
   tls 1.2, 
  had to roll back to 16.9.1 . 
  for the first time since i got my 390 , i 've had persistent issues with black screen system freezes ( with the audio repeating the last sample ) . 
  reliably reproduces with the physics sandbox oe-cake ( happens 2 minutes into the game ) and also happened with word of warships when entering or exiting a match . 
  16.9.1 is stable now . 
  it 's not a hardware issue , i 've experienced the same problem with 16.9.2 and later . 
  16.9.1 is fine . 
  it does n't seem to be related to gpu clocks ( happens when entering and exiting wows matches and clocks do n't drop there ) . 
  i 've filed a bug report about the problem and also rolled back to 16.9.1, 
  dei owns the distribution network and the electricity meters , and is also responsible for connecting and disconnecting the incoming feed to the meter ( that 's how they disconnect consumers ) . 
  he still has to interface with dei to get his power , especially in atypical cases where special documents are required . 
  the separation between the power generating entity and the network manager is only in name . 
  at the moment citizens still deal with \u0394\u0395\u0397 employees in \u0394\u0395\u0397 offices when dealing with issues that in theory come under \u0394\u0395\u0397\u0394\u0394\u0395 's jurisdiction . 
  the only thing that 's changed is the name on various forms . 
  the jelly effect is due to badly implemented ois in the g4 ( maybe in combination with eis , it looks similar to the stabilization on the 6p ) . 
  the s7 series do n't produce such warping . 
  it 's not like the gopro has a full-frame sensor, 
  nice tracking meme you got there . 
  [ no it does n't .

  pbusardo tested it and it behaves like an unregulated device .

  kek, 
  if you have to press the power button multiple times to actually make the system post , then it 's possible that you have a hardware issue . 
  try removing the gpu and trying to reproduce the problem with the igp . 
  not impossible the gpu has kicked the bucket . 
  why so mad though ? 
  does it really need two power supplies to charge at maximum current ? 
  what is xtar smoking ? 
  a 12v 3 amp power supply would allow for charging at 4x1 amp and 2x0 .5 amp , while at the same time allowing the charger to be used in a car with a simple adapter . 
  your ideas are intriguing to me , and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter . 
  says you . 
  i do n't get it . 
  it 's bargain-bin htc hardware , it 's unlikely the bom costs are anything great . 
  judging by the specified operating voltage and resistance of the element , it 's designed to produce small amounts of heat to prevent e.g. 
  a water container from freezing . 
  12 watts of heat on such a surface would not reach 250c even under open air at any appreciable time span , even less with anything touching it . 
  cute . 
  welp .

   of course you would vote nd your a capitalist, 
  nd is generally as much statist as syriza and pasok . 
  from thje ifix it teardowns , that does n't look true . 
  the internal layout is similar to that of the htc 10 and the design is recycled from the a9, 
   think of the children and the daycares !, 
  the real cringe here is the lack of subpixel aa on your font rendering .

  i 'd like if they fixed the issue with dpc latency increasing after 4-5 days of uptime and longer , getting so bad that even basic audio is affected . 
  i sent my 390 to sapphire for rma , cleaned crimson with ddu and installed the intel drivers . 
  i have a 6 day uptime at the moment and dpc latency is where it should be . 
  i also want for sapphire to process the rma quickly but this has nothing to do with drivers . 
  buzzwords . 
  fake black bezels ... 
  google 's reality distortion field is the new apple reality distortion field . 
  except on the very first image where a black background is used for effect . 
  greeks love their statist authoritarianism ( as long as the authority is on the same side of the political axis ) . 
  this is reflected in the sub 's rules . 
  note that the state does n't ban discussion about controlled substances ( that would be unconstitutional , not that it means anything with the toilet paper we call a constitution ) so in that sense , the sub is worse . 
  no it does n't .
