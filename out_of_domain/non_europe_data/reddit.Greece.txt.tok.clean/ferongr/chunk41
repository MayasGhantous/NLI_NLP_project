  yes . 
  as long as the image you flash is for the same model . 
  efficiency of the voltage regulator depends on its design and component quality . 
  voltage does n't matter , you do n't convert excess voltage to heat . 
  as long as the gasket is clean and the panel is clipped into place , water wo n't get in . 
  i 've immersed my device twice into water ( one time for almost a minute ) . 
  losses due to rdson of the mosfet , inductor winding resisntance and the resistance of the circuit board tracks tracks are taken into account when determining the efficiency of a switching converter . 
  and in this case , it 's not voltage that affects the losses , it 's current . 
  lower current will result in less power dissipated in a circuit . 
  with higher voltage , we can use less curent , ergo , he have less loss . 
  it 's the reason quickcharge uses higher voltages . 
  a regulator can be properly designed to be in its efficiency `` sweetspot '' for the voltage ranges and load you expect most of the time . 
  it 's the same reason pc power supplies are more efficient around 40-60 % of rated power . 
  we do n't know that, 
  you do n't know that . 
  it depends on the implementation . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  hopefully the celestial body the habitat orbits will affect it in some way , e.g. 
  habitats around black holes have +1 science on some tiles , habitats around a sun +1 energy , habitats around a species preferred biome type ( wet , dry etc ) +1 food and around asteroids +1 minerals .

  you will see one folder per game , named after the empire name , with multiple save files in it . 
  archive the folder of the game you want to share and upload it . 
  now we need auto-build for construction ships . 
  maybe in the us where device costs are obfuscated by long-term contracts . 
  in europe it 's pretty common to replace batteries when they start losing their ability to hold a charge . 
  mediocre screen and emui . 
  why would i buy this at that price ?

  regardless , that 's a pretty cheap shot . 
  it does n't matter , look at task-manager and you see only one core maxed out . 
  smt would not help in that situation . 
   that 's subjective . 
  nothing subjective about color measurements, 
   you 're right , it 's significantly worse . 
  now that 's subjective :\\ ^ ), 
  remove yourself from the premises, 
  from testing various voice `` assistants '' , all of them are extremely gimmicky and limited . 
  the fact that you have to think if what you want can be done with a voice assistant , and then find a way to clearly articulate it so the software gets it makes them little more than nerd toys . 
  `` ok google , call 911 and tell them that i need help '', 
  `` ok google , look up the information in the dmv database for the license plate in the viewfinder '', 
  `` ok google , look through my friends ' friends on facebook and find out who dude on the top-right of this image is '', 
  `` ok google , enter airplane mode and exit it once we land '', 
  you ca n't do any of these examples . 
  assistants are useless at this point in time . 
  apparently you ca n't `` cast '' anything from android to your windows computer . 
  i do n't own a tv but i have a big pc monitor and my computer is on 24/7 , it would be the ideal target to cast random youtube videos to watch . 
  but no , i have to but a $ 30 dongle and constantly fiddle with my monitor to switch inputs . 
  flash an official nougat rom with odin and it will be like getting the update through ota . 
  why not switch to a gsm carrier so you can just buy any device at any time and use it with no issues ? 
  hopefully the same happens with games so you can buy a proper game and enjoy it from start to finish without all those shitty `` energy '' , `` crate '' `` daily mission '' etc mechanics .

  / u/arathian and i are already being enriched . 
  1984 was not an instruction manual, 
   a green razer logo on the back, 
  also , taking in account the quality of razer peripherals , the phone would n't last more than a year . 
  i had a lacheshis and a deathadder 3.5 g that both died very quickly ( lasted almost a year ) , and the finish on them wore out too . 
  on the other hand the even cheaper rival 100 i bought last year still works great and the finish has n't worn down yet . 
  razer qc is really bad and in general , many of their peripherals have issues down the line . 
  but the most egregious thing was seeing how their priced their mechanical boards with cheap-ass kailh switches ( basically cherry switch clones ), 
  i think the problem with technicals is that during automatic fire the muzzle tends to rise uncontrollably due to the suspension of the vehicle . 
  single shots should be accurate though . 
  then i have to navigate to youtube tv on my computer manually every time i want to watch something , and fullscreen the window . 
  chrome already runs background processes listening to google 's servers when closed . 
  casting to windows would start playing the video in fullscreen no matter if you had chrome open or closed , and wake the display from sleep automatically . 
  as a logo itself it 's a terrible `` edgy tribal '' logo , and its association with the average cheap plastic crap the company produces would hurt sales .

  the problem with lgux is worse if you do n't use english .

  the lowest i can go is 96dpi , it 's the lower point where i 'm not really bothered by pixelation in text . 
  81.7 dpi is just too low, 
  again , remind me . 
  why does the state pay for `` consumer goods '' ? 
   is warranty done by sapphire themselves or by the retailer ? 
  sapphire rma in the eu is handled by a czech company , you open a ticket at sapphire 's website , go through standard troubleshooting with the agent and then once an rma is issued you 're given an address to mail your card to . 
  it 's not a science project to disassemble something with mains power and randomly spread it in a `` suitcase '' without any regards to electrical safety . 
  there 's a reason science projects use aas or 9v batteries ( or at worst , an isolated usb power supply for the ready-to-build ones ) and not mains voltage . 
  do n't wear gloves near spinny bits . 
  nothing like paying for inconvenience .

  power production of a solar panel outside `` direct sunlight '' is negligible .
