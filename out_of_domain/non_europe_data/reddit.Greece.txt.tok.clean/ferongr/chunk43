  mobile soc manufacturer drivers are hacks upon piles of hacks . 
  the hexagon dsp for example is probably used by some qualcomm libraries for noise reduction and the like , and then you ca n't even access it from userspace . 
  i was completely puzzled until i clicked the video and some terrible song started blaring through my headphones . 
   bonus if it burns my hand under heavy load . 
  in all seriousness , a glass or metal back that conducts heat away from the soc is a good thing . 
  without it you either throttle earler or dump the heat inside the phone and the battery with adverse effects . 
  in addition to everything else people said , sections with pd mounts end up sacrificing firepower overall . 
  do n't you have something like [ this ] ( https://imgur.com/a/a0ubm ) in the netherlands ? 
  mmmm , tastes like consumerism !, 
  see : [ \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 vs inalan ] ( http://www.adslgr.com/forum/threads/872485-inalan?p=6112139#post6112139 ), 
  no thanks . 
  all of them look a bit uninspired , and if it was n't for the nokia logo , i would mistake them for the generic low quality chinese devices you find on aliexpress . 
  lul , paying for a worse experience . 
   i love nicki, 
  kill urself my man, 
  i think tt sold because it 's a `` budget iphone '' , and not due to the size . 
  i know , anecdotes or whatever , but normal people do n't really want a `` small '' device if they can afford a bigger one . 
  it 's actually [ incredibly poor ] ( http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-v20-g5-note-7-s7-edge-display-showdown-715493/ ) . 
   ... with a really cool screen ... 
  literally , judging by lg 's previous attempts . 
  hopefully this time they wo n't have a display with 9000k white temperature and color accuracy of a $ 100 chinese phone . 
  there 's a related problem , where you ca n't control the variance in performance between different articles of the same panel , so unless you calibrate each device separately , you ca n't use a single calibration to get close enough . 
  also color temperature in ips displays is affected by the backlight , and bluer backlights are brighter , maybe they could n't hit the target brightness with a warmer backlight . 
  all this is still bad for a $ 700 + device though , it should n't happen . 
  or maybe moderation should be more strict . 
  this is n't 2006 where we created intel vs amd flamewars in forums . 
  personally i find that / r/amd has a very low snr and rarely browse it for that reason . 
  smaller pixels require a stronger backlight , that 's where the power consumption comes from, 
  you mean htc, 
   spend 4.4 times more money on healthcare, 
  without quantifying the statistic , it can be misleading . 
  the socialized healthcare system provides a lower standard of care in many cases . 
  for example , it can mean the difference between lower limb amputation and expensive surgery restoring most of the original mobility . 
  signal ( thoughtful discussion and dissemination of news ) to noise ( `` hype , regurgitation of rumors , fanboyism etc ) . 
  my monkey-version s5 has no burn in after 18 months of use . 
  you get a bunker , and you get a bunker , everybody gets a bunker !, 
  i do n't think new `` nokia '' has anything to do with the nokia of the windows mobile days . 
  it 's basically a chinese oem using the name under license . 
  another high quality thread in / r/amd . 
  hopefully better display . 
  feels before reals ? 
  a u t o t r a n n y s u p r a, 
  your condescending , contradictory bullshit is n't attractive to anyone except your frothing , basement-dwelling , virgin army . 
   enfia is being calculated based on the value of your house, 
  no , it 's being calculated based on the `` objective value '' of it , where `` objective '' is based on arbitrary zone pricing , surface , marketability ( or commercialization ) and a few other criteria . 
  for my 1962 apartment , the objective value is over 5 times what the market would pay for it . 
  alas , there is no way to reevaluate the house .

  the pixel 1 was premium ? 
  thank you for the giveaway . 
  do n't forget the vat and the assumption that $ 1 = 1 $, 
  [ really fires up the ol' neurons ] ( https://i.imgur.com/4qcgqcz.png ), 
  why not `` plastic '' valve covers too ? 
  why was parent downvoted ? 
  the black bezel only serves to hide the real size of the bezels on the white model . 
  no , it 's because the us has guns and concealed carry . 
  some gypo tries to fuck with you , you shoot him . 
  he tries to camp in your land , you bring out the rifles and drive him out . 
  and the police actually has the mandate to maintain order , unlike in europe . 
  the `` roma '' are not that different , at least here in the balkans . 
  the real value is what someone is will to pay for it . 
  the government values my apartment at 50000 euros too , but nobody would pay for that , more like 10000, 
  is the display white temperate and color accuracy bad like in the v20/g5 ? 
  i personally have n't see any concrete evidence of `` saudis '' bidding or wanting to bid on it , just remember of `` rumors '' . 
  something [ more recent ] ( http://www2.iefimerida.gr/news/154366/%ce%bf%ce%b9-%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%b2%ce%b5%cf%82-%ce%ba%ce%ac%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%bd-%c2%ab%ce%b1%cf%80%cf%8c%ce%b2%ce%b1%cf%83%ce%b7%c2%bb-%ce%b5%cf%80%ce%b5%ce%bd%ce%b4%cf%8d%cf%83%ce%b5%ce%b9%cf%82-%ce%b5%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%bc%cf%85%cf%81%ce%af%cf%89%ce%bd-%cf%83%ce%b5-%cf%8c%ce%bb%ce%b7-%cf%84%ce%b7%ce%bd-%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1 ) though, 
   i am extremely picky about this kind of stuff , so this is n't some placebo effect, 
   these $ 2000 cable lifter really make a difference , it 's not placebo because i paid so much money for them . 
  frappe is best made using spray-dried instant coffee , instant coffees outside greece are mostly freeze-dried and do n't create the proper , stable frothy top . 
  also , a proper mixer or shaker is required . 
  so there was no actual bid , and the `` saudis '' left on their own volition . 
  and the article does n't mention anything about `` bidding manipulation '', 
  the shanty town mod tricks the awful ai into doing something better with undeveloped tiles . 
  it 's a must mod imo , if you want to play wide . 
  what if you do n't want an apple device though ? 
  they are inferior in many ways to android ones . 
  10/10 leftist rhetoric , gg, 
  funny , the article 's image shows a 1st generation alstom metro emu in an athens metro station . 
  wtf i love wccftech now, 
  if space is at a premium , but reliable illumination is of critical importance , i 'd personally carry the tiny olight uc magnetic charger . 
  hjk has tested it to be [ very good ] ( http://lygte-info.dk/review/review%20charger%20olight%20uc%20uk.html ) and this way you keep your favorite light in use , while having the option of charging the cell ( s ) . 
   contains ads \u00b7 offers in-app purchases, 
  why did it cost 3.49 in the first place then ? 
  it 's fun watching people suffering from leftist mental ailments spaz out at each other . 
  you need a tripod to compare low light performance in auto mode , otherwise the slow shutter speeds and random hand movement affect the result . 
  fwiw both of those images look very similar in noise performance but the 8mp one is blurred from hand movement ( who needs ois , amirite ? ), 
  and it 's worthless for comparisons . 
  the 8mp image is clearly blurred from hand movement . 
  you 're not comparing `` real-life situations '' like this , just randomness . 
  it would be like a contest of who is hit by a falling apple first . 
  who cares, 
  algorithmic suggestions suck and this is one more example . 
  i remember when most people said 4gb is `` enough '' and the 390 had too much for no reason . 
  until it was n't and games started utilizing more than 4gb . 
  i have surpassed 5gb of vram usage in many games at 1080p . 
  with a 290 i would have to reduce texture quality and would be prevented from using some mods . 
  so , no , it 's not only 4k where 8gb benefits me . 
  i 've used a couple of lg devices in the past ( g3 , g5 ) and i had the opoortunity of using two budget ones too ( k8 , k10 ) . 
  all of these had lcd panels that looked very cold ( bluish white and similarly distorted colors ) with not possibility of changing that . 
  looking at reviews , it seems that lg targets 9000k as the white temperature for all of its devices . 
  the question is : why ?
