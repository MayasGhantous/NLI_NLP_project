  it does n't look good , it makes everything look cold , it is very hard on the eyes especially when it 's dark , and photos look way different when compared to other displays or phones . 
  my first / r/drama submission , somewhat local and in greek , but it always feels good to bully people like / u/thegambler952 and / u/denlewpali, 
   [ ... brothels do n't help , they do n't give me validation ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/5yox4a/%ce%ba%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%bd%cf%89%ce%bd%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c%cf%82_%ce%b5%ce%be%ce%bf%cf%83%cf%84%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%ba%ce%b9%cf%83%ce%bc%cf%8c%cf%82/desggh1/ ), 
  what kind of pos design would lose all braking capability ( even emergency braking ) ? 
  the ironing, 
  thanks , ** k ** eep ** y ** ourself ** s ** afe man . 
  emergency braking systems are designed to apply in case of general fault . 
  i can only imagine bad design from the manufacturer , this is unacceptable . 
  you forgot your `` no effort '' flair . 
  at the 250 and 500 cpi steps , the rival 100 is `` flawless '' fwiw . 
  above that the 8bit motion registers create problems though . 
  he has a gpu installed , so the igpu is disabled , as well as its hardware decoding capabilities . 
  hopefully the 4c/8t does n't have two ccx with half cores disabled on each , otherwise it will be a big failure considering uncut ryzen 's problems . 
  proving once and for all that leftism is an incurable mental disease . 
  samsung seems to continuously improve all amoled panels across their entire range . 
  even my two year old monkey-model s5 has a better panel compared to the original s5 , similar in specs to the s6 one . 
  so it 's not only two flagships . 
   phone cameras these days can look almost indistunguishable from dslrs nowadays when shooting in well lit outdoor shots, 
  this is just not true . 
  just the barrel distortion of most lenses and the corner softness are atrocious in comparison . 
   i think it would be annoying and unnecessary if he were to state it in every video, 
  [ it 's the law ] ( https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking ), 
  looks like that in typical lg fashion , the display is mediocre with a bluish color cast . 
  parent is a retard but still , gg&s is hugely controversial in academic cycles and makes many unsubstantiated claims . 
  in typical lg fashion , the display is mediocre according to gsmarena , with bluish whites and mediocre accuracy . 
  brightness and sunlight legibility do not approach amoled displays either . 
  really makes you think, 
  it 's a mediocre song , and not something i 'd want my brand attached to . 
  whichever xir is , i 'd tap it . 
   you just need to flash another rom first, 
  and then you ruin your two year warranty . 
  if you ca n't read the `` thinkpad '' logo on the first dark image , then there 's something wrong with your monitor 's settings , possibly gamma . 
  dell u2715h \u03b7 u2717d . 
  is n't it absurdly heavy due to all the gimmicks ? 
  this is just not true , the average crt had pretty meh colors , and even worse , the geometrical distortions where terrible in many modes . 
  but that is actually similar to ets-style sperging . 
  an engine rewrite to support vulcan will be a good excuse for delaying the release of the complete game . 
   but what other alternative could you propose realistically ? 
  to have everything unlocked from the get-go and have the multiplayer longevity stand on its own merits ( fun gameplay ) instead of having an endless grind sustain it . 
  this is not a f2p game . 
  personally , i thought the gameplay looked clunky and slow . 
  if i did n't see tb 's name in the channel , i 'd think that the footage came from a console with the player using a controller . 
   what 's the fun of playing something when you do n't get anything from it ? 
  playing the game itself should be fun by itself , and continued enjoyment of it should not depend on progression systems . 
  we did n't need such money and time sinks in games like the original counter-strike , quake iii or unreal tournament . 
  big if true, 
  not true , they are all team-based `` action games '' i.e. 
  not rpgs or strategy games . 
  this looks like a tourist trap of questionable transit value . 
  i use gonemad music player that implements a custom database . 
  it does n't have any of the problems you mention . 
  also , deleting a file there actually removes it from the filesystem , i do n't know why poweramp wo n't do it , maybe the torrent app keeps the file locked and it ca n't be deleted ? 
  i hate all commies , marxists , anarchists , socialists , authoritarians , nazis and fascists equally . 
  what does that make me . 
  true : -- d, 
  do n't they all communicate with each other , so a failure of a single unit will cause all others to halt ? 
  so tolerant !, 
  120mm worth of radiator can cool around 50w-100w , depending on radiator type ( thickness , fin density , radiator design ) , coolant deltat , and number of fans and their speed . 
  with common small pumps , coolant temperature should not go above 50-55c otherwise you reduce their lifespan and reliability greatly . 
  low fan speeds and silent operation will require a radiator designed for this , oversizing the radiator itself , good quality fans and a speed controller . 
  realistically , assuming 900w of thermal load , you will be looking for at least a [ 9x120mm radiator ] ( https://www.frozencpu.com/products/19805/ex-rad-593/watercool_mo-ra3_360_lt_9_x_120mm_4_x_180mm_extreme_radiator_-_black_powder_coat_25000.html?tl=c95s667b192&amp;id=svwoj77i ) , push-pull pressure-optimized fans operating under 1000rpm and you also need the proper waterblock ( s ) to tranfer the heat from the pcbs to the coolant . 
  it could be the effect of the ois system in the u ultra . 
  commie feels before reals . 
  ideological doubling down before reals, 
  nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi , you chiisai bitch desuka ? 
  watashi 'll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in nihongo 3 , and watashi 've been involved in iroirona nihongo tutoring sessions , and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores . 
  watashi am trained in kanji , and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern california . 
  anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo . 
  watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu 'd before on this continent , mark watashino fucking words . 
  anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto ? 
  omou again , fucker . 
  as we hanashimasu , watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the usa , and anatano ip is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame , ujimushi . 
  the ame that korosu 's the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano life . 
  you 're fucking shinimashita 'd , akachan . 
  not worth it . 
  my mother has a galaxy tab a 10.1 . 
  the screen is ips but excellent , the back is made from durable polycarbonate and the the 7300mah battery lasts forever . 
  the device is very snappy too even if it `` only '' has 2gb of ram . 
  it 's not recommended for 3d gaming but everything else is a breeze . 
  videogame logic , a 200 + kg bigfoot is stopped by the thin fiberglass walls of an rv . 
  note i specified the 10.1 '' variant ( and note i 'm talking about the 2016 revision ) . 
  that has a 16:10 1920x1200 display . 
  the 7 '' 720p variant is different in more ways than the display . 
  it has an inferior sd410 or spreatrum soc ( depends on the presence of cellurar radio ) instead of the snappy octacore exynos , 1.5 gb of ram and a paltry 8gb of storage . 
  most recent samsung devices that i know of receive constant security updates . 
  my old monkey-model s5 is on 2017-03-01 security patch for example . 
  my s5 neo ( g903f ) is an `` international unlocked device '' , whatever that means ( i bought it for cash from a random online store and inserted my existing sim into it ) . 
  and i 'm not in the us . 
  the s5 neo is not the `` flagship '' s5 . 
  it 's a cost-reduced version of it with a cheaper soc , no fp scanner and no ir blaster . 
  `` the plural of anecdote ... '' etc. 
  it 's a shittier version of what once was . 
  fukken saved . 
  good . 
  more tourists for greece . 
  mash the marx, 
  the only thing i think is missing is automatic refresh of the sub list in the left sidebar , having to constantly refresh it manually as i subscribe and unsubscribe is a chore . 
  sadly , its performance is much worse than mxplayer 's . 
  that also affects battery runtime , for my device vlc gets around 20 % less playback time and in some cases ( fullhd video with animated styled subs ) vlc stutters . 
   / r/menslib is giving it a shot,
