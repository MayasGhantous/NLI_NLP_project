  works on my device ( flair ) out of the box like with the sibling 's comment . 
  ( for windows ) as long as the device is listed in the network connections then you only have to enable usb tethering and the device 's wifi . 
   how to stop verizon and other carriers from pushing their new bloat to your android, 
  do n't buy carrier phones . 
   t-they w-were not serious guise !, 
  ( ( ( adl ) ) ), 
  yes . 
  subtitle rendering seems slower in vlc . 
  furthermore , i have quite a bit of h264 10bit content that can not be accelerated and mxplayer destroys vlc at them . 
  i get dropped frames with 1080p h264 10bit content with animated styled subtitles in vlc . 
  with less demanding content i get less runtime too in comparison to mxplayer . 
  ymmv obviously . 
  with working s4 state ( hibernation ) it should n't matter . 
  even s3 is no problem for anything less than half a day . 
  media player classic circa 10 years ago . 
  observe drive activity while ram is copied to / swap until the system powers off, 
  during power on the system will display the bios logo and the bootloader afterwards , and the system will slowly restore its state ( depending on disk speed ) . 
  it will be obvious . 
  s3 state ( suspend to ram ) is almost instantaneous by comparison . 
  [ it 's been there for a long time ( stock marshmallow on device in flair ) ] ( https://goo.gl/photos/8gsw1xf5eyomvqqq5 ), 
  i ca n't tell pentile on a 1080p 5.1 '' display , unless i use a magnifying glass . 
  lg oled is monochrome oled with a color filter in front of it . 
  way different technology with a few caveats . 
  if people say it looks good now , i ca n't imagine how ugly it used to be in the past . 
  youtube videos do not constitute good camera tests . 
  an article with links to untouched image and video files is better , even better with a standard scene to compare different devices . 
   it 's not fascist to recommend that mentally ill people be put to death , good one, 
  / u/pimpthap3n you would be the first to go if everybody did what you said , you psycho . 
  really fires up the ol' neurons, 
  did someone seize your means of comedy ? 
   reeeeeeeeee leave the trannies alone, 
  fuck the police . 
  ancient custom-patched kernels and many bugs . 
  furthermore , low power efficiency and performance , both computational and graphical . 
  only advantage is price . 
  i really wanted to buy that phone but then i discovered it lacks the 5ghz band . 
  such a bummer , the 2.4 ghz band is unusable in my home due to interference . 
  the z8500 is ancient . 
  furthermore , rk socs are even cheaper , probably less than $ 10/ea . 
  you ca n't compare the cost of a device 's bom to its final price . 
  it has little relation . 
  the `` laptop '' could cost $ 100 in parts and sell at $ 600 , but still have a tiny 2 % margin after all costs are accounted for . 
  saving at least 10 % on the bom due to a rk cpu vs using intel or qualcomm could mean the difference between a 2 % and 4 % margin on the device . 
  but there is no difference , the mosfet is one of the main components of the card 's ** v ** oltage ** r ** egulator ** m ** odule . 
   animated television series, 
  the original material in the visual novels was superior . 
  would n't connecting a scope to the gate of the mosfet ( or even the drain before the smoothing capacitor ) be enough to determine the switching frequency ? 
  the `` clean install '' update from within radeon settings broke the entire installation . 
  now i only have an in theory working driver , no settings installed , a start menu link to the problem report wizard that only shows an [ error ] ( http://imgur.com/xso05kb ) and nothing else . 
  i know , ddu etc etc but still , if setting notifies me of updates and offers me to install them , it should do it properly . 
  it 's the slower shutter advantage from ois . 
  nobody claimed they were . 
  \u4e00\u5206\u94b1\u4e00\u5206\u8d27 = `` you get what you pay for '', 
  chinese proverb that reflects the attitude of the chinese when doing bussiness . 
  buyer beware . 
  i have the zs1 and it 's indeed nothing special ( and the cable is uncomfortable ) but the cheaper atr is way better . 
  the zs1 is what used to be the zn1 , a headphone with integrated amplifier and crossover for the dual drivers . 
  without the amplifier/crossover unit in the zn1 form , the zs1 does n't sound that well . 
  just use a bookmark like all normal people . 
  and ? 
  meh , we 're adults . 
  is is so hard for every driver update to not fuck with gpu scaling ? 
  it takes randomly fiddling with the settings until it fixes itself miraculously . 
  ffs, 
  now hopefully all the `` autists '' will go use that and stop interjecting into every submission mentioning systemd with their tired diatribes . 
  not really , mr. r ca n't drive or ride for shit . 
  a certain driving/riding skill is required to actually `` review '' a car/bike . 
  r. ca n't even downshift without making me cringe . 
  show us on the doll were the mean trump supporter touched you . 
  the problem with such software fixes is that the only way to filter such accidental switch engagements is by trying to filter very short activations . 
  this means that you either have a long delay to filter all accidental engagements , resulting in significant click latency , or a short delay that will let some engagements slip . 
  a new hardware revision is required , though personally i would just return the mouse . 
  well , normally digital switches go through a debounce filter that prevents chatter but that does n't affect initial activation latency , only deactivation , and it 's at most 3-5 ms ( most likely imperceptible ), 
   essentially offering customers a cutdown experience just because they wanted a smaller model . 
  let me interject for a moment . 
  no person that i know of actually wants a smaller device . 
  they just get them because they 're cheaper . 
  it 's the reason why sony 's compact flagship line failed in the market . 
   / r/ahs, 
  kill urself my man, 
  thessaloniki ( and northern greece in general ) have superior sandwiches/tylihta . 
  i still miss the sandwiches i ate at orestiada when i was a conscript . 
  the iphone se is cheap and it 's an `` iphone '' . 
  it does n't command flagship prices . 
  sony 's compact flagship line was expensive in comparison ,, 
  there 's a reason they dont make it and it 's because it would n't sell . 
  market research is a thing . 
  if there was demand for a flagship device with a small screen , someone would make it to both capture the market and differentiate their offerings . 
  it 's generally true , and in many cases , after the system busts , care standards go down . 
  if i relied on `` universal healthcare '' here i would be a leg amputee after an accident . 
  instead , i had to pay 20000 $ at a private hospital for surgery . 
   was n't it always `` hog scalder '' ? 
  see a professional , you may suffer from dyslexia . 
   no 5 ghz ac support for wifi, 
  man , it 's not even a cheap device , relatively speaking . 
  the 2.4 ghz bands in my apartment are practically unsusable for anything else than light browsing due to congestion . 
  `` wtf i love trump now ! '', 
  no 5ghz band makes it useless for using wifi in urban settings . 
  in my apartment , 2.4 ghz manages at most 12mbps with iperf , but 5ghz easily hits 250mbps, 
  it 's a 230 $ device here , it 's unacceptable to not have 5ghz wifi,
