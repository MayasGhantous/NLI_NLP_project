  money well spent . 
   you 're not gon na have a problem with most mediatek processors, 
  terrible idle drain . 
  very bad radios with bugs ( my-gps-takes-4-minutes-to-lock kind of bad ) . 
  mediocre performance . 
  chinese-tier security of the board support package binaries . 
  i 'm not american , but is n't the engineer essentially responsible for the accident ? 
  was n't he familiar with the route and its speed limits ? 
  did n't he have an instrument indicating speed ? 
  even with the instrument malfunctioning , would n't the difference between 50 and 100mph be apparent ? 
  hopefully the area is policed better now . 
  acording to wikipedia , it also looks like the engineer was overwhelmed from radio traffic from a nearby accident with people throwing rocks . 
  but it still feels dubious to me that you can `` think you 're at a different curve '' on non-underground routes . 
  looking at the satellite images it does n't even look like the area around has repetitive scenery . 
  while there 's no proof to it , my personal opinion is that he fell asleep . 
  yes , but it 's something completely alien to me that lives in greece . 
  anyway , you 'd think the police would try to contain ciminal behavior , especially after it led to a fatal accident with multiple uninvolved people dead . 
  x86 patents are not frand like lte patents . 
  you can have various stipulations in a patent grant . 
  it 's entirely possible that qc would push such clauses in their licensing agreements . 
  they are a pretty abusive company when it comes to patents , hey also tried to litigate opus out of existence , probably to push one of their own proprietary codecs . 
  the lte patents are frand so samsung should be able to be `` given a blank cheque to use the ip in their own products '' for ** f ** air , ** r ** easonable ** a ** nd ** n ** on - ** d ** iscriminatory terms . 
  they should n't have to do that in the first place since membershi in the 3gpp group requires providing access to patents under frand terms that 3gpp has ratified . 
  it 's basic contract law . 
  volume control is handled in the windows mixer internally . 
  the mixer operates at 32bits fp internally ( regardless of input bitdepth , like all proper audio processing pipelines ) and then resamples to the selected default format . 
  there should be absolutely no difference for volume control quality between diffrent output formats, 
  fake internet points do n't matter . 
  if that thing is class compliant ( no drivers and control panel ) , i really doubt that volume control happens anywhere else than the windows mixer . 
  furthermore , it still should n't really matter . 
  even if you attenuate the signal a lot digitally , and then amplify with very high gain , the noise from the dac itself will dominate . 
  and such a fixed high gain would be problematic in some situations ( transient noise , popping from buffer underruns in some apps etc ) , possibly burning drivers .

  my [ galaxy fit ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_fit_s5670-3726.php ) from 2011 ( and my first android device , even froyo was awesome compared to the shitshow symbian had become ) had autofocus , and that was one of the most budget android devices at that time . 
  ca n't stop the bussy revolution . 
  / u/trollabot ferongr, 
  season 3 get hype, 
  do n't expect me to install it then , much less start using it . 
  is mixed use zoning ( europe-style ) in the game yet ? 
  i 'd rather have a standard din headunit to be honest . 
  lollipop sucked period . 
  my monkey-model s5 went from 24h idle ( if not used at all ) / 2.5 hour sot to 8-9 days idle/5 -6 hours sot when the upgrade to marshmallow came . 
  plus everything sped up a lot , lollipop required a daily restart otherwise everything lagged ( and i 'm talking about real multi-second lag , not a frame drop from time to time ) . 
  push fans perform a bit better with less noise . 
  tower coolers with pwm-controlled fans can be virtually silent if you program the fans to stop at when the cpu is idle . 
  pumps make noise all the time . 
  furthermore , with a 24/7 setup clc pumps are the weak point and their failure will lead to the system shutting down from temperature protection . 
  a dead fan in a tower cooler will at most ( if it 's the only fan ) force the cpu to throttle as ambient case airflow is enough in most cases . 
  it ca n't create uefi-bootable partitions . 
  if the image has the right partition table , yes . 
  also , no dd on windows were rufus is used . 
  this comparison does n't show anything as you do n't demonstrate them as they would render on a variety of display configurations , from low dpi entry-level devices to high dpi flagships , with various background colors and at small sizes, 
   comparing the colours on the screens with a dell ultrasharp monitor, 
  this does n't say anything , not to mention ultrasharp 's default calibration is not that great either . 
  many ( that come without a calibration certificate ) do not . 
  furthermore , the calibration is quick ( to roll them off the production line ) and according to measurements by reviewers like tft central , the average de ( deviation from specific measurement colors ) is mediocre at best with the stock calibration , way worse than the average samsung flagship or apple device . 
  also things like grayscale accuracy can vary . 
  hope you did n't pay for the photographer . 
  niggerfaggot . 
  this is correct . 
  at least in greece there are two laws concerning `` warranties '' , one deals with defects and missing properties at the moment of sale , stating that the seller is responsible for `` true defects or missing agreed-upon properties of the item ** upon delivery ** '' and that `` true defects or missing agreed-upon properties determined within 6 months of delivery are considered to have existed during delivery unless this is not consistent with the item or the fault or missing property '' and that `` the customer can excercise his rights within two years '' . 
  there 's also a law regulating actual warranties . 
  `` the warranty period should be reasonable according to the lifetime of the products . 
  for cutting edge products specifically , the warranty period should be reasonable compared to the period that the products remain `` current '' from a technological sense , if that period is shorted from their lifetime '' . 
  the jokes write themselves . 
  i think that some multi-national tripwire forces like those deployed in the baltics , situated near the borders would help greece against possible turkish agression towards the islands or thrace . 
  but otherwise , i would n't really care either way . 
  tripwire forces are deployed in a host country 's bases and not isolated . 
  they 're there to dissuade the other guys from attacking , since if they did then it would also involve the country that the tripwire forces come from . 
  with regards to your other point , yes , being part of nato can preven aggression even between members , since there 's a different level of communication and there 's also the usa that will put its foot down to maintain stability in the region , like it did during the imia crisis . 
  underrated comment . 
  i know i was just a dirty conscript , but both during sentry duty , marches , transit in various vehicles , shooting and exercises i greatly preferred the m16a2 compared to the g3a3 . 
  the weapon being lighter affords greater maneuverability with less effort extended , and in all other situations less weight in your hands ( with that weight being shifted to pouches and load carrying equipment e.g. 
  more ammo ) is a lot preferable .

  nobody cares about the one thousandth of users using iconpacks . 
  are you serious ? 
  you do n't know ** anyone ** that does n't use iconpacks ? 
  then i 'd wager your experience is not at all typical . 
   relatively popular and easy, 
  as long as we 're quoting anecdotes , then i definitely see less than 1 in a 100 people with a different launcher and icons . 
  fuck no . 
  an icon 's silhouette is great for quickly finding a specific app , especially for people with color perception deficiency like me . 
  kill yourself . 
  plz do n't bully innocent toehoes . 
  damn right . 
  instead of complaining you could always delete your account and uninstall the app . 
  we make fun of everyone and do n't tone police . 
  `` bomb has been planted ! '', 
  the nokia 6 is a 300 $ device even on its cheapest model , definitely not budget . 
  neither . 
  i wish the beach was my workplace too . 
  fair bussy redistribution now !, 
  singular is `` goy '' . 
  purple tint strikes again . 
  that cast aluminum part is fucking ugly . 
  higher ipc due to clocks and architecture advantage ? 
  in both cases the law was upheld . 
  why was it `` a mixed bag '' ? 
  what kind of `` propeller shaft '' rotates at 2500 rpm ?
