  maybe the shills and people flip-flopping between ecosystems with no commitment , it matters , but for many people like me invested in the android ecosystem , it does n't .

  what 's the deal with us ladders having those `` no-step '' top caps ? 
  are they made like this on purpose ? 
  sometimes you got ta do what you got ta do and that means stepping on the top rung or having two people , one on each side , use the ladder . 
  fwiw [ this ] ( http://www.palbest.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pal.png ) is a common ladder type used by tradesmen here . 
  it can be unfolded to become a straight ladder ( with the locking plates preventing it from folding again ) . 
  this specific article is like 100 $ ( ~ $ 110 ) .

  and it 's not really heavy , it 's all made from extruded aluminum profiles and for the 1.6 meter model it weighs less than 20 pounds, 
  when you see `` a53 core '' you know it 's in-order , since that designation indicates a specific design created by arm themselves , that qualcomm integrates unchanged into the soc .

  the results speak for themselves . 
  he could gather 10 monkeys with typewritters and the result would be equally as bad ( or maybe better as nobody would even think he had a semblance of competence then ) . 
  then what happened during those 6 months of `` negotiations '' ? 
  capital controls do n't real ? 
  and what makes you think that their whole plan had merit and that they could even set up a parallel system successfully ? 
  he was n't competent enough to not worsen the at least stagnant condition of greece , instead it all went to shit . 
  when the mou2 ended , the financial uncertainty greatly reduced the value of greek banks . 
  ela is an expensive `` loan of last resort '' that is backed by the loan portfolio of the bank , not `` free money '' . 
  ecb denied an increase of ela ( necessitated by the withdrawal of panicked withdrawal of savings ) since understandably , the banks could not guarantee the increased amount with their , now , junk portfolios . 
  thus capital controls where enacted to prevent complete collapse of the banks and people losing their money . 
  it was not a `` punitive '' action , but rather , a consequence of v-man 's and syriza 's `` negotiation '' . 
   even if the plan had no merit at all at least it would lead to somewhere, 
  first of , i really , really doubt there was an it system in place ( or even designed on a whiteboard ) to handle the electronic ious . 
  they would need to be issued swiftly ( the government would pay in ious with the promise to exchange them with actual currency in the future ) to maintain social order and the government should have been accepting them for alll transactions with it from day 1 . 
  on the other hand , you can not force the private sector to accept the ious at their indicated value . 
  the government would lack trust and there would be no confidence it could actually back the ious with currency in the future the ious would be exchanged at a reduced rate ( e.g. 
  the supermarket would value a 50 $ iou at 25 $ ) , and many places would not even accept them , since they could not pay for their imports or local suppliers with them . 
  suffice to say the most probable result would be rampant inflation and even price controls for most basic agricultural goods would n't work , since in the end the producers have to rely on imports payed with actual currency for fertilizers , fuel and spares . 
  do n't forget the effect the armor has on the base lower damage per pellet . 
  single-core electrical cable with the ends twisted is extremely good for securing loads . 
  looks like a remotely activated ied and not a mine , as long as no detonator was connected to the other end of the cable pair , then there 's no real issue . 
  for samsung you 're using the capacity of the smaller ( non-edge , non plus ) models but for google you use the capacity of the pixel xl . 
  no measurements of output impedance ? 
  no measurements of output power with different loads ? 
  measurements of the output with a load ( headphones or dummy load ) attached ? 
  common samplerate of the android mixer ? 
  just playing the rmaa test tones with the device connected to a high-impedance line input is not enough .

  that 's not lag . 
  back in the day `` lag '' meant that the entire ui would freeze for many seconds and you could not do anything . 
  you could sometimes even miss calls due to system lag . 
  frame drops and subpar touch responsiveness were par of the course and not mentioned at all .

  not the only one , but there 's not many people like you in the first place . 
  the market has spoken and people prefer brigger devices that make it easier to consume content on them, 
  if there was a sizeable market segment that could sustain a small device , a manufacturer would fill that void . 
  that 's because it 's a `` cheap iphone '' , not die to its size . 
  / d / is a slow board, 
  you do n't want to be stuck with an unstable 8mbps adsl connection . 
  you should definitely research which islands and which places on them have nga networks . 
  typically you should expect fttc vdsl2 , with 50mbps downstream speeds , and depending on the provider , either 5 or 10mbps upstream . 
  with vectoring and the use of the 35b vdsl2 profile in the near future downstream will reach as high as 300mbps . 
  in athens there 's also an existing and some planned ftth networks and in thessaloniki a provider serves docsis over coax . 
  you can use this [ crowdsourced map ] ( http://fttxgr.eu/map ) to see in general whether a location has vdsl2 cabinets installed ( enable the vdsl2 buttons on the top right and zoom in the location you want ) and this [ availability checker ] ( http://cyta.gr/misc/availability ) ( only in greek sadly ) to see about an address specifically . 
  if by copper you mean the telephone `` loop '' , i think that they did n't want to touch the existing phone installation for legal/liability reasons . 
  wondering whether the `` pro '' ftth plan is active or passive optical . 
  tbh most comments look sarcastic . 
  the backlight might not use pwm but the lcd subpixels definitely are . 
  the backlight driving circuitry is distinct from the subpixel driving circuitry on an lcd display . 
  but they 're distinct components when it comes to driving them . 
  you do n't drive the lcd subpixels from the same source you power the backlight . 
  that top `` you need to know '' story though ... 
  scoopgate v2 ? 
  do n't worry , they 'll tell you themselves . 
  hopefully by 2020 it 'll be released . 
  i just released a fart that was beyond imagination . 
  their tvs are not `` superior '' to other tv-like amoleds , because there are no other amoled tvs ( due to yield issues ) . 
  lg tv oled uses white monochromatic oled panels behind a color filter . 
  it 's kind of a `` hack '' and due to the fact you have to filter the light , you have inferior brightness and colors compared to an oled display with color subpixels . 
  there 's no rgb amoled in the market . 
  pentile rules the game due to the different requirements for different subpixel colors , and at high dpis there is no real difference . 
  also , lol at `` high quality super ips '' from lg , all reviews of modern lg flagships mentioned their extreme blue cast of the displays and the mediocre color accuracy . 
  who cares . 
  we 're adults . 
  there is but one varougod and / u/jimogios is his prophet . 
  be glad we have n't started kinkshaming you to death . 
  pentile is the technology where certain subpixels are ommited . 
  the diamond arrangement is still pentile .
