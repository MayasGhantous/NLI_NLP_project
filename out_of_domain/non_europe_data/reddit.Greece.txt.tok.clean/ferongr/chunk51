  the gun is supposed to be some kind of glock , it 's a modified striker fired desing , you do n't even need to `` cock '' it , or any modern pistol for that matter . 
  sauce, 
   i hate playing that game with my phone trying to end a call but the screen keeps switching between on and off . 
  your proximity sensor looks borked , rma your device . 
  i 'd use a brillo pad too if the boss told me to wash his shitbox instead of actually working, 
   the only difference here is in the support for expandable memory , where the g5s plus supports double the storage via microsd compared to a1 . 
  so if you think 128gb on top of inbuilt 64gb is not enough for you , there 's one more reason to go for the moto g5s plus and have 256gb via microsd . 
  zero effort reciting of specsheets . 
  the sdxc standard supports up to 4tb , and there 's no reason or technical limitation with android devices that would limit that . 
  i personally replaced my 5 lemo 2s with 5 ammits and i 'm pretty satisfied . 
  kill yourself .

  do n't work in that industry so i was unaware of their existence, 
  then why were you so eager to speak without knowledge ? 
  can yourself . 
  play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
  there 's no need to . 
  it 's typical 18 year old bullshit . 
  slow down when you see pedestrians getting ready to cross next time . 
  luckily looks like the rockets where either a training variant with no payload or they have a minimum arming distance that was n't exceeded in this incident . 
  normies ruin everything . 
   has a patreon, 
  but ofcourse . 
  who #wouldn ' t want to financially support the `` vulgar economics '' ? 
   your, 
  that 's a killer filesystem . 
  the app resets its zoom factor between matches ( at least on ground forces ) requiring you to zoom in again on the next battle . 
  also , it would be good if you could n't scroll the map too far away from the viewport ( or sometimes it glitches and ends up far away ) . 
  if you find that your trains do n't leave according to the timetable , sitting in the depot all the time there 's a large possibility it 's due to using a depot at the other end to reverse their direction . 
  after replacing it with a tight loop in my game , trains started running perfectly . 
  in any case , cim2 would be so much more if there was a separation between terminal stations and depots , depots only existing to store and repair vehicles ( with a user-configured threshold at wich point vehicles would get rotated ) and terminal stations to reverse vehicles and possibly hold one or two vehicles more for peak demand . 
  i ca n't find it in the interface tab anymore . 
  i ca n't find the windows feedback app anywhere . 
  i installed the os cleanly after formatting the partition . 
  is it possible this happens due to a local user account ? 
  the nautilus ' base diameter is 22mm , while the ipow 2 has a diameter of 18.5 mm ( is has a 510 connector and an ego adapter ) . 
  is there some kind of beauty ring to transition from the 22mm of the tank to the 18.5 mm of the battery seamlessly ? 
  so , i started vaping yesterday with a nautilus mini . 
  my first 4ml of juice was flavourart 's maxx blend , a very strong tobacco/cigar-like flavor . 
  i then switched to ecig 's divino cigar , a flavor i liked so much i consumed almost 6ml of it in a day . 
  now i switched back to maxx blend but i thought the taste was a bit muted . 
  i attributed it to a worn coil and switched it with a new one , but as it turns out , the intensity of the flavor on the new coil is similar to the old one . 
  could it be that i 'm developing some kind of tolerance to that flavor ? 
  do you know eu stores that ship to greece and that carry box mods like the sigelei 100w plus or the ipv2s/ipv2x at normal prices ( i.e. 
  equivalent to the us ) ? 
  local b&m s carry the old ipv2 for ~ 100 $ ( unacceptable ) and the original sigelei 100w for 120 $ . 
  i 'd prefer an alternative to ordering from slowtech or ebay . 
  i remember playing a game that was basically a twin-stick shooter ( wasd+m ouse ) with neon graphics , a bit like geometry wars . 
  the game was a single executable without any saves or highscores and you could run it from a usb flash drive . 
  the was no menu of any kind iirc , you just launched the executable and the game started . 
  i already have a lead on it for 76.5 $ with free shipping , just wondering if i can squeeze a few more euros . 
  are there any templates put designs on ourselves that we can print at local print shops ? 
  preferrably at high dpis, 
  why is [ this ] ( http://arizer.com/store/en/arizer-air/103-air-dual-battery-charger.html ) $ 45 ? 
  it costs $ 6 [ elsewhere ] ( https://www.fasttech.com/products/1421/10013695/2316802-jd-18650c-a2-battery-charger-for-2-18650 ) . 
  why are these [ generic batteries ] ( http://arizer.com/store/en/arizer-air-parts-accessories/98-air-battery.html ) $ 19/ea ? 
  i 'm contemplating buying the air but if i have to use an unsafe chinese charger for warranty reasons instead of my xtar , and also be unable to reuse the many 25rs i have then i 'd rather not to . 
  why has noone complained about such bullshit tactics designed to nickel-and-dime people ? 
  looks like a pretty nifty alternative to the standard voltmeter . 
  while it may not suit n-channel mosfet builds i can imagine it being pretty useful for okr/raptor/w . e. 
  builds . 
  is there a reason it 's not more widely known or used ? 
  i lack some bone structure in my upper jaw and i had some complicated work done with graft and films . 
  twice healing failed and the sutures broke . 
  tomorrow my dentist is calling a dedicated professional to do thework . 
  it 's the last chance to save the implant and he was categorical that i must stop vaping cold turkey to facilitate healing . 
  wish me luck . 
  i do n't know how i 'll manage but i must :(, 
  edit : thanks everyone !, 
  i want to take the claims in a certain forum post with a large grain of salt but i 'm not experienced enough to do so . 
  some dude in a local forum claims to have perfected a technique where before combining all flavors into the final solution , it 's better to steep them in groups . 
  for example , such a recipe would go like :, 
  steep flavor a and b for 4 days, 
  steep flavor c ad d for 3 days, 
  steep flavors d , e and f for 5 days, 
  each group above is prepared in a different bottle and steeped separately . 
  then after all groups have finished , they are combined into the final mixture together with vg , pg and nic . 
  would such an involved preparation technique actually work or is it bullshit designed to generate e-fame ? 
  classic forums being what they are , i always take advice by vape-sages with multiple grains of salt and do my own research , but in this case i 'm stumped . 
  i was given a new samsung device ( a galaxy s5 neo ) and i 'm looking to see which of the samsung bloatware drains the battery during standby . 
  apps like gsam show `` android system '' as the culprit but that 's not very helpful . 
  is there any app that can drill down into the packages included in android system ? 
  got the cd for cheap from a local store . 
  it sounds like garbage . 
  many tracks sound really harsh and unpleasant . 
  `` panzer battalion '' exhibits audible clipping . 
  doing some audio diffing in audacity with a lossless rip of the original version shows that the `` engineer '' indiscriminately boosted the mid-bass and high frequencies . 
  how is this shit acceptable ? 
  i 'm moderately angry right now . 
  is there any reason to keep building smaller hull sizes when you unlock bigger ones ? 
  bigger hulls seem a lot more efficient regarding tons ( size ) per command point . 
  as i find myself very command-point limited early to mid-game ( as star-bases take quite a few turns to build and are generally a few steps further in the build queue , and you ca n't maintain a fleet efficiently over the cp limit ) i 'm wondering whether retiring smaller hulls for fewer bigger ones as soon as i unlock them makes sense . 
  weapon types : is there any functional difference between beams vs lasers ( except for the point defence modifier ) ? 
  is one good for one thing and another good for something else ? 
  are they countered by something later into the game necessitating diversification in loadouts ? 
  should one be preferred for the main damage-dealing item on a design ? 
  are missiles just plain better in the end ( they seem to do lots of damage with slower reload and i have n't encountered strong ecm/pd yet ) ? 
  lastly , what weapon targets fighters/bombers ? 
  ecm or pd ?
