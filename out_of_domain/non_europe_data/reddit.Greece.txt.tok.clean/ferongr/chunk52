  or both ? 
  recommend me a simple new tab page replacement . 
  my only requirement is for it to populate at least a 4x3 grid using history top sites , optionally with pinning and re-arranging them on the grid . 
  anything more is superfluous . 
  in essence , i 'm looking for something similar to the firefox new tab page . 
  i 've been looking around but most things in the chrome `` webstore '' seem suboptimal and many of them loaded with tracking scripts and excessive monetization features . `, 
  the problem : most home routers i 've looked at support either slaac or dhcpv6 . 
  this creates a problem with ipv6 support in different oses connected to the network . 
  windows does not support rdnss . 
  with slaac , windows gets no ipv6 dns addresses since it does n't support rfc 6106 . 
  android does not support dhcpv6 at all . 
  this is problematic obviously since you ca n't have both os types have proper ipv6 connectivity . 
  looking around the web it seems that you can have slaac ( for the initial v6 address ) , rdnss ( so android clients can receive dns addresses ) and dhcpv6 ( for windows clients ) but i ca n't seem to find a home/soho device that supports such an option . 
  this seems like a huge oversight on the part of the manufacturers . 
  it does n't seem too much to ask for both oses to have proper ipv6 settings . 
  would dual common cathode diodes work ? 
  warming up to the idea of building a 2x18650 parallel dna 75 device . 
  how would i select the proper component ? 
  low vf and if over 30 amps ? 
  i tried manually using a post and hitting undo but posts hidden with `` hide read '' are not restored . 
  does the define r5 support putting the small 3 x 3.5 '' hdd case at the top , where the 5.25 '' cage is located ? 
  does the hdd cage clear the fan cage underneath for installation of a 280 radiator ? 
  i do n't care about 5.25 '' devices . 
  i assume that a 280 radiator at the top will fit too . 
  i 'm looking for a pump/fan controller with at least two pwm channels that can monitor coolant temperature , flow rate and pump/fan rpm . 
  in case of a fault condition it should both be able to sound an audible alarm and/or turn off the system , ideally by breaking continuity of ps_on . 
  is there something like this ? 
  when selecting an image to upload in a reply , i can not apply a rotation to it without also doing a crop . 
  recording follows . 
  note that only the crop button is available and that will actually crop depending on the crop cage . 
  going back shows the normal unrotated image, 
  * device : samsung galaxy s5 neo g903f, 
  * android version : 6.0.1 samsung stock, 
  * sync version : 12.4 from play store, 
  i 'm looking to start modding my s2 + ( thinking of dropping a 219b 4500k 90 + cri emitter into it ) and i 'm investigating dropping a better driver into it . 
  first i will write about my understanding of various driver types . 
  fet drivers seem to be simple pwm affairs with fixed duty cycles and no output regulation . 
  7135 drivers are linear regulator affairs that waste `` excess '' voltage as heat, 
  7135 + fet drivers use the 7135 ( or many of them ) for lower modes and switch to direct drive ( maybe with some high duty cycle pwm modes too ), 
  the question : why is n't there a voltage-regulated fet driver ? 
  the microcontroller would vary the duty cycle of the pwm depending on load voltage to maintain stable output with extremely high efficiency . 
  since not many positive experiences from sapphire 's rma are online , here 's mine . 
  my gpu started crashing into blackscreen with an audio glitch randomly that eventually ended with the system not being able to boot at all with the gpu installed . 
  since the vendor i purchased the card from had gone under , i contacted sapphire . 
  we went through standard troubleshooting and eventually i was given an rma form and an address of a czech distributor where i was to ship the card . 
  i shipped the card from greece at 27 october and today i received the replacement at 14 november . 
  it was a relatively pain-free experience . 
  maybe the fact that my card was completely dead made it easier but i had to put a positive word for sapphire out there . 
  i think this is a relatively `` simple '' fix ( no interface needed , except for changing the mineral cost value when pressing ctrl ) for a way to utilize all dozens of spaceports across all sectors to quickly mass-produce fleets . 
  the micro needed to quickly assemble fleets utilizing all spaceports in parallel currently is appalling . 
  player controlled empires have opinions of a.i. 
  empires , affected by things like border friction and the like . 
  this notably affects federation membership requests . 
  to see the opinion your empire has of other empires , switch to opinion map mode , click another empire 's zone of influence to switch to their perspective and then hover over your own zoi to see it . 
  i dont have transport fever , but i 'm wondering whether they 've fixed the issue with laying track or roads on relatively flat terrain . 
  top part of the image is what train fever does , when dragging a track segment ( red line ) , train fever creates a flat segment of track sloping between the starting and ending point terrain elevation ( black line ) , even with minor differences and bumps in between that can be directly climbed . 
  this results in terrain deformation and more expensive tracks for no reason . 
  this has caused me endless amount of grief in train fever as it takes lots of busywork trying to make track conform to the terrain instead of the opposite . 
  does transport fever has a mode to make the track or roads conform to the terrain without modifying it like at the bottom part of the image , where the rail ( red line ) follows the terrain ( black line ) without trenches or embankments ? 
  how is it possible to get concrete data on it ? 
  is it only possible with access to cpu stats via snmp ( not supported on my device ) or custom telnet/tr -069 commands ? 
  i use a left vertical taskbar , and my notification area is on the bottom left , but the notifications slide in from the right . 
  it 's pretty jarring .

  `` i 'm 21 years old , pushed aside socially and unmarried . 
  from 5 to 17 i was bullied because i 'm ugly . 
  as a result i never socialized with people while the people that bullied me succeeded in all areas . 
  i went to university afterwards . 
  i was alienated because i had no friends from highschool and i was told clearly that i am not welcome . 
  due to that event i studied hard to leave that school as fast as i can ( physics ) . 
  ** the 4 years i was supposed to lose my virginity were wasted ** . 
  now at 21 i have nobody . 
  i live with my parents and nobody cares about me . 
  here in greece people are hostile with the `` forever alone '' ( tl . 
  note : english term written as is in the quotes ) because the average greek has friends and has been fucking from 18 years old . 
  i 'm a ghost and nobody will accept me without a social life . 
  should society do something for me ? 
  why should i work and contribute at it ? 
  ** i 'm a slave of normal people and my future is to work to feed them and their children . 
  note : cucked by life itself lmao ), 
  there 's a big taboo with the unmarried `` forever alone '' ( tl . 
  note : term again used as is ) here in greece . 
  nobody respects me because i have no social life . 
  ** to socialize you need a social life but to have a social life you need to socialize ( tl note : big if true ) . 
  why are n't there reintegration programs for people like me ?
