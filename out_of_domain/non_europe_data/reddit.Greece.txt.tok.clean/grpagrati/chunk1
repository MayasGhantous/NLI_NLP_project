they made it snow indoors ? 
  that 's impressive . 
  who needs a cat who 's going to start bitching when i leave the toilet seat up ? 
  the yellow and white parts though , in the unwashed lot , seem clean enough . . 
  i would say , anonymity . 
  like the internet . 
  people say stuff they would never say in real life . 
  taxes . 
  do n't get me started ... 
  i 've only been a couple of time , ages ago . 
  i remember it as very cold . 
  all they want is to get it over with and get rid of you . 
  i was young and i guess i thought it 'd be something more , which is naive . 
  so if you just want to do it with a body , it 's fine . 
  otherwise it will make you feel more lonely . 
  ... came the deafening roar , of chickens in choppers . 
  move over whitman and frost . 
  this is poetry at it 's best !, 
  big bird without funding . 
  seriously . 
  the guy on the right is movie star material, 
  lube is considerate, 
  humans are too clever . 
  apart from being too successful , beating the earth into submission , they also have the ability to wonder who they are and where they come from , but not the answers . 
  some artist in portugal will probably get fired for [ this ] ( https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/03/29/airport-named-after-cristiano-ronaldo-also-has-terrible-ronaldo-statue-body-image-1490801343.png?output-quality=75 ), 
  clever , but not wise, 
  this is philosophy ? 
  i get confused by cats . 
  they seem completely self centered and uncaring , yet i 've seen things like this and [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/abw5dfrog7q?t=23s ) where the cat saves a kid from a pitbull , that say otherwise . 
  pranks , when the person being pranked does n't find it funny . 
  plus , she seems clean and freshly bathed . 
  definitely not a gamer . 
  ask not what i can do for a damsel in distress , ask what she can do for me . 
  hey human !, 
  so long and thanks for all the fish . 
  both she and [ trump ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1980294624/djt_headshot_v2_400x400.jpg ) squint their eyes in photo shoots , as if the sun is always out . 
  the moment when `` awww '' becomes `` ahrgh !, 
  wtf ? '', 
  why does n't this player have a full screen option ? 
  the unexpected , which i expect any day now . . 
  all the stupid things i 've done and all the dangers i face , real or imaginary . 
  getting married, 
  in such a backward society , it makes sense . 
  no one would marry a woman who has been raped , because she 's not `` pure '' . 
  she would be left unwanted . 
  in many cases , even her family would shun her . 
  yeah , life is n't fair . . 
  with 10k per inch , you 're going to end up with rich people being giants with huge members dragging on the ground behind them , and we 'd all have to be constantly jumping out of the way . 
  i mean , what the hell am i going to do with that donkey now ? . . 
  you just know the guy next to him in the middle has taken some styling pointers from him . 
  is n't time they added an emoji with red eyes , to signify texting while stoned ? 
  i say something back , in a similar low voice , so she does n't hear and wait until she comes to ask what the hell i 'm saying . 
  the place where all your illusions are destroyed and truth shines supreme . 
  see , it 's stuff like that , playing around instead of researching meteor trajectories , that led to their extinction . 
  because 99 % of scientists say it 's currently the most complete model of our universe . 
  you just have to follow their thinking a bit to see how much work and research has gone into this , and how clever and advanced these people are . 
  the more you know , the more you appreciate how far we have come . 
  pot of course , but thankfully by fewer and fewer people . 
  knowing how much we do n't know , does n't mean you understand how much we * do * know , which is an incredible amount . 
  enough to detect gravity waves from a couple of black holes crashing together 1.3 billion years ago , for example . 
  sad fact : plato never had pizza . 
  i do n't understand what you are getting at . 
  you are right in that the big bang is not a proven fact . 
  it 's the best theory we currently have , given all that we know ( which we both agree is a lot ) . 
  that 's why it is taught at school . 
  do you think we should stress more that it 's not yet a proven theory , or that we should be teaching something else ? 
   god caused the big bang . 
  evolution is how god develops species . 
  that 's how they should spin it . 
  science ca n't prove what existed before the big bang , or why it happened in the first place , so it ca n't disprove the existence of god . 
  why mess with this perfect set up ? 
  one says * who * did it , the other * how * . 
  that 's how it * should * be . 
  i do n't think it is though . 
   maria wood ( * the dark haired girl * ) was a bookkeeper for microsoft and married to another one of the early employees in the picture ( * the guy top left * ) . 
  she left the company just two years later , suing it over sex discrimination . 
  microsoft settled the case . 
   bob wallace ( * top middle * ) was one of the most far-out early microsoft employees . 
  he spent time and money researching psychedelic drugs after leaving the company . 
  a movie should be made . . 
  original video : https://youtu.be/rba9q7jdzzs, 
  these items move very fast , around 1-2 miles / sec, 
  because being a nanosecond late , was not an option . 
  i 've seen several great korean movies . 
  i do n't remember their names , but i highly recommend them . 
  also , `` bridge '' , a good swedish murder mini-series . 
  in the video it says that they risk it . . space is big i guess and the probability of getting hit by something is low , but it 's always there . 
   there is no convection in space , which is the main form of heat transfer for thermal systems in earth 's gravity [ 3 ] . 
  natural convection is negligible in micro-gravity because there is no such thing as ` heavier ' or ` lighter ' ( a concept created by the gravitational force field ) . 
  without the concept of gravity there can be no natural convection currents ( responsible for flame shape and propagation on earth ) . 
  if interested , watch [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/yhulgdxfjoo?t=24m1s ) , where they talk about the problems they face for a trip to mars . 
  i think the reason they do is that high density is heavier than low . 
  no trash , no graffiti , no ads , it looks like a concept for a city, 
  that 's where shit happens . 
   * according to greek mythology , cape sounion is the spot where aegeus , king of athens , leapt to his death off the cliff , thus giving his name to the aegean sea . 
  the story goes that aegeus , anxiously looking out from sounion , despaired when he saw a black sail on his son theseus 's ship , returning from crete . 
  this led him to believe that his son had been killed in his contest with the dreaded minotaur , a monster that was half man and half bull . 
  the minotaur was confined by its owner , king minos of crete , in a specially designed labyrinth .
