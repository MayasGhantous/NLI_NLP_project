  that 's practically the whole population of the country, 
  that dog has been places, 
  if i buy it the first thing i 'll do is put some railings . 
  they 're all after your karma points , no matter what they say, 
  smells fishy, 
  he used to be dead . 
  he still is , but he used to too . 
  he used to be dead ... 
  ai is already showing its true face , making snide remarks . 
  musk was right, 
  `` so , did you catch any actual fish up there , or were you just trying to dunk a basketball ? '', 
  - the other orcas, 
  why is there soil ( or whatever that is ) on the roof ? 
  frodo is ripped !, 
  yeah . 
  otherwise your farm animals will soon start demanding more food , less milking & work , health care & education . 
  i had a similar ( smaller ) table , that split in the middle , instead of one side . 
  it has the benefit that the 2 ends remain looking the same ( their border/apron ) . 
  this one however seems easier to open . 
  never need to dust the house again, 
  looks like someone combed the rocks, 
  he should be known . 
  it 's beautiful, 
  he does n't have to chase his tail, 
  your dog 's head is out of focus . 
  you should have it looked at, 
  if chickens ever become sentient , we 're all in for a hell of a law suit, 
  how did he film his dream ? 
  i think this may be faked, 
  because her children are being assholes, 
  would you be so kind as to clean it up ? 
  looks like he ate a few too, 
  he looked [ much cooler ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5548d843e4b0f2df4caa3a5b/t/5747162062cd94c83383c874/1464276518097/ ) later on, 
  they 're like food cranes, 
  is this for working girls with older clients ? 
   holmes has a set a target of deploying 10 million robots by the end of the decade . 
  that 's a bit hard to swallow . 
  the decade has less than 2.5 years to go . . 
  i think remote controlling robots as avatars is the way to go , although operating them on mars from earth would be quite challenging given the average time delay of around 13 minutes ( 4-24 ) . 
  thanks for the bikini daddy !, 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  it 's a standard latin beat like a billion others . 
  maybe because bieber blessed it . . 
  another [ warning from a sheriff ] ( https://twitter.com/pascosheriff/status/906712903868469249?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.redditmedia.com%2fmediaembed%2fliveupdate%2fzkadef2ttzql%2fliveupdate_6c0ed6b2-95dc-11e7-b9bc-0e78ab13dd4a%2f0 ) not to shoot at the hurricane, 
  it was definitely necessary !, 
  singers need backup dancers, 
  i remember my first computer - 4k ram , with cassette tape for saving . 
  floppies were a dream then . 
  so , we 're done with morals now , right ? 
  thirsty bitch, 
  why would you ever vote for a billionaire playboy ? 
  apparently humans can get used to any atrocity , if they see it often enough . 
  it was the same in ancient rome and the colosseum . 
  i doubt all these people are psychopaths . 
  they 've just used to the spectacle . 
  which is horrible . 
  it seems there 's no depth to which humans ca n't sink to if left unchecked . 
  or let them see it , then switch the card with a fake one and get a 2 for 1 for free, 
  like oj simpson 's glove, 
  this must be the new american airlines instructional video on how you can get in and out of the overhead bin in case they give your seat away, 
  it was a huge hit in greece when i was little , but the italians i 've asked ( a couple of whom were djs ) have never heard of it . 
  i think it was because the church forbade it because it talks about a bordello . 
  they need flattery and intimacy like planes need jet fuel, 
  the scene with the dog in something about mary, 
  perspective . 
  nothing you do matters for the universe as a whole , but the smaller your perspective , the more it matters . 
  it matters little for the world , more for your country , your family and most for yourself . 
  try not working for a while for example . 
  it 'll start to matter real soon . 
  jeeves sounds fun, 
  i 'm going to say it 's a woman . . 
  it 's the `` find waldo '' file system, 
  he needs a cape, 
  it 's the chicken you have clucking loudly on your head, 
  he keeps running like he meant to do it . 
  what a poser, 
  no teeth, 
  usually in his photos he lets the others pretend to punch him . 
  the beatles , he punches . 
  too famous, 
  we are also going to pay taxes, 
  looks like he ate a smurf , but it 's beautiful, 
  except for jasper . 
  he 's a dick, 
  `` i was n't licking the glass , just pressing my nose against it . 
  it 's normal . 
  everyone does it . '', 
  some people prey on the stupid . 
  [ proof ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trump_university ), 
  it will be unique and it will cause contention and he will be required to leave , take it with him to cast it off the edge of the world . 
  [ great movie ] ( https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_gods_must_be_crazy ), 
  \u0395\u03b4\u03ce \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf [ \u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkhcqxkil8 ), 
  i feel a spiritual bond with that sloth, 
  repost , so it 's a copy of a copycat, 
  i do n't know why they call this extreme behavior `` greek '' activities . 
  one of the most well known ancient greek sayings was `` metron ariston '' ie `` everything in moderation '' , which is the exact opposite . 
  in athens , greece, 
  lol - he starts off with `` yes boss , i 'm ready '' , then the hood covers his eyes and he 's bumping into everything . 
  the man and the sickle remind me of old soviet propaganda posters, 
  does n't know what to wear , or which way to go .
