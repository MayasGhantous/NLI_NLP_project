  i 'm hoping he 'll figure it out in the end . 
  bill burr [ did a bit about it ] ( https://youtu.be/ysrzacsk-b8 ), 
  not a movie , but the ending to `` lost '' was a disappointment . 
  that piliing on debt to the economy ca n't last forever, 
  pandering pandas patiently, 
  she drove him to this . 
  most of it is reposts, 
  that carpet made me anxious, 
  it 's this kind of flagrant display of wealth and priviledge that led the people to revolt , by voting for a billionaire . 
  i smell psbattle, 
  do n't know how to `` link '' - i abdicate . 
  i 'd expect more ripples from the falling water , but it looks amazingly calm and peaceful . 
  unrelated , but we had a child die a couple of days ago , in greece , from a bullet shot into the air during a party happening ~ ~ a few miles ~ ~ half a kilometer away . 
  it was gypsies and they like to shoot in the air , in celebration , at weddings , etc. 
  ( although its illegal ) . 
  the boy was just playing in the yard and suddenly fell dead . 
  they found the bullet in his head . 
  edit : [ a link to this story ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/219123/article/ekathimerini/news/police-probe-into-stray-bullet-that-killed-11-year-old ) . 
  the distance was more like 500 meters ( not miles as i exaggerated ), 
  it 's ramadan now afaik . 
  mecca is packed with pilgrims . 
   you ca n't die from a bullet shot in the air . 
  it 's all over the newspapers and tv here in greece , and there was an autopsy where i heard from the tv news they found the bullet in his head , but i guess you know best . 
  they have also arrested a 23 year old roma and there were live interviews with locals , etc. 
  complaining about the drug dealing and shooting going on in the area by the roma . 
  btw , i do n't know if you realize it , but `` every single detail in your story is wrong '' , is a very rude thing to say , specially when its not true . 
  she just sat on the wood and would n't move, 
  there 's a lesson here somewhere, 
   dana rohrabacher said ; `` is n't it a good thing for us to have the united states finally backing up sunnis who will attack hezbollah and the shiite threat to us ? '' . 
  it 's not the `` enemy of your enemy is your friend '' anymore . 
  it 's the enemy of the enemy of your enemy . 
  next level stuff . 
  diabolical . 
  excellent series , although quite dark and sometimes slow . 
  other billionaires should sue him , he 's giving them a really bad name . 
  agree . 
  same applies to farage for the uk , podemos ( spain ) , grillo ( italy ) , tsipras ( greece ) , le pen , and many other populist leaders , the world over . 
  and yes , its not hate , but a deep sadness and disappointment at the arrogance and naivety of the people that vote for them . 
  the thing that sets the us apart though is that it 's big and rich and the choices it makes affect everyone . 
  i once had a jersey . 
  i was a cool guy, 
  politics is not like business . 
  in business , one side wins . 
  in politics both must win ( the voters i mean ) otherwise democracy gets warped . 
  this is what 's happening now . 
  democracy is being warped , by the side that cares least about warping it . 
  the minister of defense of greece twitted [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/yiannisloverdos/status/875612757843779585/photo/1 ) yesterday . 
  he took it down since , blaming his son who had borrowed his phone to play with . 
  at first i though the bbq on the right was a coffin and i wondered who died to make them that happy . 
  but it was with good intentions, 
  i 've used that a couple of times . 
  turns out i 'm a dick . 
  something went seriously wrong with the formatting of that video, 
  when people asked me what animal i wanted to be i always said dolphin , or killer whale . 
  recently though i 've been considering the benefits of being a chiouaoua owned by a hollywood starlet . 
  i 'm still undecided . 
  ubi , if implemented , will probably be given to people without any income or property at all ( or below poverty level ) , not to people who have money , and it will be basic subsistence , not rent free bungalows at waikiki . 
  no one * wants * to be that poor . 
  does n't mspaint have antialias ? 
   trump said ... . he was being investigated `` by the man who told me to fire the fbi director . '', 
  `` by the man i told to tell me to fire the fbi director . '', 
  ftfhim, 
  more streamlined , efficient and generous maybe , but basically yes . 
  i do n't think it can be anything else . 
  it will certainly be only for those that need it - why would you waste money on someone who does n't - and given that the welfare system is already a big burden , you ca n't have a handout that 's preferable to a job . 
  i 'd love to be wrong though . . 
  joke aside , i think that 's is completely true , 
  i like how every time , after booping the ball , he does a turn , looks around , like `` are you people watching ? 
  i 'm killing this . . '', 
  he inherited a country in economic and moral crisis and delivered one with a vibrant economy , while keeping it safe and respected around the world . 
  that 's what matters . 
  and so 2b | ! 2b was never answered, 
  this home owner do n't take no shit from no tree, 
  the lightning is using the ash plume to ground itself , i would guess , right ? 
  she has impeccable style in the beginning, 
  what do you do to them with that vacuum ? 
  the russian roulette click, 
  they should change the spelling to ouranos , which is the actual greek word . 
  it 's too hard not to giggle , specially when the article 's title is constructed to make you think of it . 
  all the stuff scifi books promised me when i was a teenager , robots and spaceships and colonies on far away planets . 
  i still do n't know who the us supports . 
  obama 's goal was to overthrow assad and i suppose it still is , but what comes afterwards ? 
  he should go to [ monty python 's argument clinic ] ( https://youtu.be/xnkjdusvxie ), 
  it should be just `` human '', 
  with the name comes a huge history which belongs to greece , and they 're pretending it 's theirs . 
  imagine if a guy moved next to lebron james , named himself lebron and started signing autographs and wearing fake championship rings . 
  lebron be pissed . 
   greeks still do n't recognize neither macedonians or other miniorities in their country . 
  this is such complete and utter lopsided bullshit . . 
  this is similar to what happens to a serious post on reddit . 
  `` we wear glasses cause we ca n't c # '', 
  and then they wo n't give them back, 
  and besides , the old lady bought it . 
  the 1st one , where it 's man/woman , must be disconcerting to their respective sos, 
  the `` 16 years and older '' , could be throwing this off . 
  the average 1st marriage age in the us is [ 28 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_age_at_first_marriage ), 
  we must be heard !, 
  for science, 
  i thought by `` president '' they meant trump and i said no way . 
  good click bait,
