   `` big industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of overproduction . 
  the main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is , of course , to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible , which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it , i.e. , when the overpopulation is the greatest .

  but do n't let financial data change your beliefs :-), 
  just close your ears and sing lallalalalalala,

  cuba is poorer than the lot of them . 
  the only good thing about cuba is the low crime ( the good side effect of poverty ), 
  remix me simiti, 
  nd performed better than syriza . 
  how do we know ? 
  we use economic data and compare : gdp , growth , state assets in bank stock , capital controls , etc, 
  what about non-economic subjects ? 
  immigration = fail . 
  syriza stated a false promise of unhindered transit to europe . 
  result = from 5000 illegal immigrants , to more than 60,000 immigrants stuck in greece . 
  separation of state and church = fail . 
  tsipras had to fire his minister at the demands of the church, 
  foreign policy = fail . 
  turkey got to seat in our place and call the shots with eu, 
  it is not rocket science . 
  if i take the `` long run '' into my analysis , syriza will fare even worse . 
  the damage from capital controls is only additive . 
  the gdp damage due to companies leaving for tax havens is also additive . 
  kafros : ahhh that was good,

  if you have the guns , you can ignore it . 
  do n't confuse what you want , with what can be practically achieved . 
  if we leave the eurozone , our new currency will devalue and we will enter an era of high inflation . 
  previous experience has shown that greek governments love to print money instead of cutting costs or raising taxes . 
  do you remember the greek bonds sale in the 90s with 20 % to 25 % interest ? 
  top kek !, 
  but even if our governments do not repeat the sins of the past , the new currency will have a value in accordance to the current production of greece , which is low . 
  so until we build our industry , tourism , and agriculture to be on par with other countries , our currency will be devalued . 
  but how will we be able to build our industry , tourism infrastructure , agriculture , energy grid , etc , while the needed imported goods will be very very expensive ? 
  ( because of devaluation ), 
  on top of that , the debt will be magnitudes `` larger '' because of the weakness of our new currency . 
  this means that we will pause payments , thus making enemies of all eu ( losing money through ecb ) and the rest of the world ( losing money through imf ) . 
  tl ; dr : can we have our own currency ? 
  yes . 
  can we have it ** now ** ? 
  nope, 
   cuba attracts about 20,000 [ 63 ] paying health tourists , generating revenues of around $ 40 million a year for the cuban economy . 
  cuba has been serving health tourists from around the world for more than 20 years . 
  the country operates a special division of hospitals specifically for the treatment of foreigners and diplomats,
