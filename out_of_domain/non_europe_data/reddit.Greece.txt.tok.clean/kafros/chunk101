  the eurogroup recalled that the primary surplus target of 3.5 % of gdp reached by 2018 should be maintained for the medium-term, 
  how long is the medium term on a program that extends 32 years ?

  coding is cheaper because you have a simpler model : the server handles the `` state '' of the instance . 
  running can be 100 % free , with the release of dedicated servers run by the community . 
  hell , we are doing so since the mid 90s with quake . 
  you can also mix and match : official dedicated ( server paid by ed ) , unofficial dedicated ( server paid by a small community ) , standalone ( server runs on my pc in-game ) . 
  all this is tried and tested in gaming for 20 years . 
  the main transaction server remains , but the instance is now run on a dedicated server ( as it is done in the last 20 years for almost every mp aaa game ) . 
  the transaction server will decide that players a , b , c , d. . . up to 64 , are in the same system , and also ( from their ips ) are in west europe , so they can all connect to dedicated server x in paris , france ( so their pings are low ) . 
  the dedicated server is hosted and run by the players . 
  as a player you can filter which servers you prefer ( this is a hint to the master server browser run by frontier ) :, 
  1 . dedicated official ( either run by frontier , or by an approved community ), 
  2 . dedicated unofficial ( run by a community or a single player ), 
  3 . non-dedicated ( run within the ed client program ), 
  as a player you know automatically what to expect from the above :, 
  stable connection , no hacks , but limited slots, 
  stable connection , possible hacks , but more slots, 
  unstable connection , possible hacks , but many many slots ( by random users ), 
  after a few games you will connect to servers of type ( 1 ) , and also create a list of favourites of type ( 2 ), 
  you are confusing mmos with multiplayer games . 
  do you have shared quests ( missions ) ? 
  do you have hundreds of players in the town ( station ) ? 
  can you at least guarantee that you meet up with your buddy in the same instance to pew pew ? 
  this is not a complaint against ed , it never set out to be the space mmo , and i believe most of us are ok with this . 
  what i am discussing is the limitations of p2p to the multiplayer aspect of the game . 
  systems are akin to `` maps '' of other multiplayer games , with additional information from the master server on what to spawn . 
  at the moment the game `` state '' of the system is shared on a p2p architecture which is understandably a headache .

  how grexit threatens eu :, 
   capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] characteristics central to capitalism include private property , capital accumulation , wage labor , voluntary exchange , a price system , and competitive markets . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] in a capitalist market economy , decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets , and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market,

  we need to live socialism like the rest of eastern europe , and learn ( the hard way of course ), 
  by 2060-2070 , i expect greece to have accepted reality, 
  less austerity means higher taxes ( vat , enfia , gas tax , telcos tax , etc ) . 
  when the state implements less austerity , it means it has to gather more money , which will take from you ( as it has always done ) . 
  the reason why you pay for such a high price for bread , is that taxes are added to the price . 
  if you pay 1e for bread , 0.24 e go to vat , +29 % profit tax , + x % ( varies ) for social taxes , + enfia for the shop , etc.

   privatization at real value not raping public land and facilities like the old athens airport at 30 % real value . 
  do you have an offer for 31 % value ? 
  if yes , why did n't you submit it ? 
  if no , please spare us the tears . 
  the `` hellinikon '' bid had only one submission , which is not strange if you look at how things went .

  who in their right mind would risk doing business in greece ? 
  you make a deal , shake hands , give advance , and then the state changes the rules . 
  good luck with that !, 
  all fault lies with the state that can not set rules and follow them ( the latest tv license bid is a case study of state incompetence ),
