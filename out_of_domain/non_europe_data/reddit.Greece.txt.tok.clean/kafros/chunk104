  i just posted the plain fact that eam cleaned-up all other resistance groups , in order to take over the power when the time came .

  press the `` max '' button . 
  then look at the y axis numbers, 
  yoda speak, 
  good news everyone, 
  weapons armed and rdy . 
  ( respect . 
  bends reality ), 
  unlimited state power . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
   think about it like this . 
  countries that can print their own money never have to default on their debts -- they can always inflate them away instead, 
  which replaces one problem with another : hey look guys , we do n't have 3 % recession ( 18 % cumulative as the article says in 6 years ) , we now have 20 % inflation ** each year ** ( greece has already been there . 
  tv ads on the 80s and 90s for greek bonds at 25 % lol ), 
  crowd erupts in cheers, 
  on a more serious note : eu managed to bring bond interest rates down to 0 % from 5-6 % that it was in the beginning of the crisis . 
  this was a great success for 2 reasons : 1 . all states ( including us ) do not waste money on interest rates , 2 . 
  it makes no sense for an investor to keep his money `` stale '' at an almost 0 % interest rate , this is an incentive to use them somewhere i.e. 
  invest . 
  transport : airports , trains , passenger vessels . 
  clean cities and safety, 
  there is an untapped market for senior citizens of wealthy countries . 
  they do not buy houses in greece to spend their days ( and pensions ) because our hospital infrastructure is shit ( only good ones are the private ones at the big city centers ), 
  main attractions are managed by the state , and visiting hours are stupid . 
  people may come to visit the acropolis only to find the museum closed . 
  many nice destinations have no roads . 
  a tourist can not visit 50 % of the island if he does not hire a 4x4 vehicle ( and be prepared to drive in very narrow roads . 
  many tourists are not comfortable with that ), 
  i think it will be sufficient, 
  needs more crystals, 
  real wheel drive , muscle cars are great, 
  same here .

  analysis :, 
   given that the ecb had deemed greek banks solvent in the stress tests conducted in 2014, 
  does a test in 2014 cover the situation of june 2015 ? 
  of course not , because numbers change , in particular the withdrawals from accounts which reached 40 billion euros . 
  also ela reached 70billions in june before the referendum . 
   at the moment the ecb capped the ela it is estimated that greek banks could have accessed up to an additional 28 billion euros in emergency funding, 
  what collateral would ecb accept from greece ? 
  at the end of june the 2nd mou ended without an agreement , which means that greece is in default ( no mou --  no loan --  no instalment to pay the bonds on june and after ) . 
  banks in a country in default , have trash collateral . 
  ela was approved until 28/6/15 on the provision that greece is protected by the loan money of a mou, 
  john dies at the end,
