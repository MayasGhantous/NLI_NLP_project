  130,000 e = millions of euros, 
  right ? ^ right ? 
  only one company offered money at the bid . 
  if you had a better offer , i am very sorry you did not bid . 
  so far , all the companies that ignored the bid , seem to have made the right move . 
  the investing company is still waiting after years and years of court battles to start working on the project . 
  what is the status of the project now ? 
  refugee camp , lol . 
  the reason noone was interested , is the certainty investors had , that the greek state will not allow any project to start . 
  so far the project has been fought 2-3 times at \u03a3\u03a4\u0395 , the ministry of culture has `` archaeological '' claims on the area , and the ministry of development has claimed the airways as `` classical '' constructions to be preserved . 
  source for saudis ? 
  how are they going to start construction while there are people roaming the area ? 
  should they change the plans to have a new spacial refugee `` plaza '' as an attraction between the new buildings ? 
  lol, 
  no hope, 
  you wrote :, 
   you forget the bidding of the saudis ** which have complained cause simferonta were manipulating the bidding ** . 
  quoting your source :, 
  maybe he is , but you are dodging the subject .

  is nd of karamanlis the same party as the nd of mitsotakis ? 
  is pasok of simitis the same as the pasok of fofi ? 
  why mitsotakis did not vote for pavlopoulos ? 
  why was pavlopoulos chosen by a left government in the first place ? 
  ( they had just won the elections and only needed 151 votes not 181 ) . 
  you think that ideology is separated by party lines , but it isnt . 
  greece has 2 political blocks : statetism and free economy . 
  the free economy block had a short run with simitis and mitsotakis ( the father in 1993 ) . 
  it might get a third run now with kyriakos . 
  fantasy vs reality :, 
  fantasy : anarchists think that by stopping the bidding they are helping the poor, 
  reality : no bidding , no house sales ( via seizing ) . 
  no house sales , no pressure to house owners to pay their loans . 
  no loan payments , no bank reserves / no cash flow . 
  no bank reserves / no cash flow =, 
  1 . capital controls for ever ( economy will remain in decline , poor people are affected more than rich people because they are already at their limits ), 
  2 . no new loans for business development and new jobs ( poor people will remain unemployed ), 
  3 . need for recapitalisation ( this will increase state debt , which in turn will force new direct taxes to poor people , e.g. 
  vat , gas tax , cigarettes tax , etc ), 
  hint : last sentence, 
  you have no idea what you are talking about ( again , what a surprise ! ), 
  banks do not want , and can not have the property . 
  at the auction you ( a random citizen ) buy the property , and the money you give goes to the bank . 
  banks are not real estate agencies , they want the money, 
   only if we keep following the `` consensus '' of socialism for bank debts, 
  we have been through this before , and once again you are digging your head in the sand . 
  no recapitalization of banks , means loss of deposits . 
  good luck getting you next paycheck at work , when the bank has applied a 90 % haircut to your company 's bank accounts . 
  austerity is not a choice , but a result . 
  ** the result of a state ( the greek state ) not having enough money to cover its expenses ** . 
  all states function in the same way : they raise money from taxes , may additionally borrow money from markets , and from that money ( called a budget ) , they pay state employees , pensions , and do public works ( roads , ports , etc ), 
  the greek state on 2009 needed to borrow 33 billion to add to its 53 billion tax revenue . 
  out of the 33 billion 12 billion was to be used to pay old debt . 
  the bond markets said no ( actually they said yes , but with an interest rate of 7 % above eu base rate , which practically means no ) . 
  so the greek state had expenses of 21 billion ( 33 to be borrowed - 12 for old debt coverage ) which were not covered by its tax revenue . 
  this meant that the state was obliged ( by the reality of simple arithmetic ) to reduce its expenses ( without new loans , the expenses had to be the same as the tax income ) . 
  so new laws were passed which ** reduced ** pensions , salaries , hospital budgets , public works budgets , etc to the level that could be covered by ** tax income ** . 
  these ** reductions ** are called austerity . 
  these reductions are not a product of evil masters in dark castles who laugh maniacally while petting their cat . 
  no politician wants to implement austerity because it leads to voter dissatisfaction ( who wants a reduction to his salary , pension , or hospital service after all ), 
  they only way to avoid austerity in a state that does not have enough money to cover its expenses , is to borrow more money from bond markets . 
  this in 2009 ( and since ) was ( and still is ) impossible . 
  syriza , and the majority of greeks believe there is an additional way : grow money on trees : the mythical money-trees . 
  we are yet to see results , but as a nation we keep our faith by posting articles like this one, 
   an ideologue for attempting to push his agenda of not giving into austerity demands as an exchange for bailout cash,

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/5z3z94/more_evidence_of_how_badly_austerity_is/dev9y4w/ ), 
  varoufakis had the same chance of pushing his agenda , as i have in implementing my science pet-project of supersonic donkey flight . 
  no eu country was accepting to ** gift ** greece additional money . 
  finance ministers of all eu countries refused to accept any changes to the agreement of mou2 , but varoufakis thought it was a good idea to step on the gas and crash the country onto a wall . 
  because hey , his `` theory '' was right , how could reality dare to do otherwise . 
  enjoy your new taxes up to 2040 , which will cover the damage made in budget surplus instalments of 3.5 % for 10 years and 1.5 % for 12 years, 
   even if you do n't give two cents about the greek economy , you are still sceptical of why a < b, 
  the problem is that `` debt relief '' has already been done : 110 billion with psi , the biggest debt relief in history . 
  there was no chance in hell that eu would agree on a 2nd debt relief . 
  what you are accepting as an axiom ( a < b ) contradicts reality . 
  the debt relief of psi , resulted in a loss of 50 % of the money due . 
  an additional psi ( syriza was asking another 50 % ) , means that the final money due is close to 25 % of the original capital . 
  this is almost the same amount as going bankrupt in the first place ( you sell the debt to vulture funds for 20 % and let them chase the greek state for decades , as done in argentina ) . 
  if eu is to accept such a loss in capital , they would demand to gain something . 
  that something was put on the table for varoyfakis : leave the eurozone, 
  was it shot dead by frontier back then ? 
   they only way to avoid austerity in a state that does not have enough money to cover its expenses , is to borrow more money from bond markets . 
  this in 2009 ( and since ) was ( and still is ) impossible . 
   anything is possible, 
   i am only saying what the imf is suggesting,
