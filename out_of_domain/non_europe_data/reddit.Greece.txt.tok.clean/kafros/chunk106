  imf is suggesting that the `` others '' participate in the debt relief . 
  you see imf is not allowed by its own rules to accept a haircut , so its suggestion is for ecb and eu to accept a haircut on their loans to greece . 
  it is no mystery why eu is saying no, 
   the psi was a grand disaster for the greek banking system ( and the cypriot ) and somewhat for the pension system . 
  40 % of psi was in greek hands . 
  the greek banks were anihilated , and the state had to borrow 40 billion to save them , thus making the final net result of the psi very small , if not null given the loss in value . 
  you have a low understanding of psi . 
  with psi , investors exchanged greek bonds of junk status ( i.e. 
  almost zero value ) with new bonds backed-up by ecb , valued at 50 % of face value . 
  during the days before psi , ** greek bonds traded at 30 % value ( sellers anticipating a default and buyers anticipating psi and 50 % value ) ** . 
  without psi , banks would become insolvent within a day ( since their bond assets will be valued at 10 % of face value , sell-able only to vulture funds ) . 
  this means haircut of deposits on the spot . 
  the 40 billion we borrowed to recapitalize them , should have been returned to our state by selling back the bank stock to the open market ( by recapitalizing the banks , our state took majority ownership of the banks , except eurobank which kept majority ) . 
  this practice has been done successfully by usa and eu nations that recapitalized their banks : recapitalize , wait , sell stock back to market , pay back loans , get even . 
  this is why i have been writing again and again , about the damage of varoufakis plan : when ela was stopped and capital controls imposed , these 40 billions became less than 1 billion . 
  bank stock stopped being traded for weeks , and returned with a new value of 1e for 100 stock pieces ( yes that 's right , 1 cent for a bank stock ) . 
  this stock was valued 24 billion in 2014 before syriza claim to not vote for \u03a0\u03a4\u0394 , and 17 billion on the day syriza won the elections . 
   i have no objection that the eu will not like `` debt restructuring '' or might require sth in return , what i am saying is that they might not like even more the result of austerity, 
  eu has given their answer to all these matters in the week of the referendum : implement the agreement , no new haircuts . 
  global markets agreed to this option : the next day of the `` oxi '' win ( before the kolotoumpa ) , the euro got a rise in the currency markets . 
  investors decided , that even though eu would be hit with a loss of 300 billion euros ( due to our default ) , it would be better for eu and the euro to get rid of greece . 
  3 days later tsipras was `` explaining '' to his idiotic voters how `` oxi '' means `` nai '', 
  why would they ? 
  the referendum won , and the price of euro increased in currency markets . 
  the global economy said out loud : ok eu , you will get a 300 billion hit , but you will stop bleeding money to greece , so lem me buy myself some euros . 
  2 days later , tsipras was explaining to his idiotic voters that `` no '' means `` yes '' . 
  his bluff had been called . 
  greece had just lost all its bank stock , all the bond gains from ecb , and was diving without a parachute . 
  too bad there are no flying donkeys to grab onto, 
   you see no alternative to what is going on, 
  oh , but you do see an alternative i guess eh ? 
  you think eu is going to wake up tomorrow and say `` ok chaps , lets sink some more money in the money pit called greece '' . 
  the lenders are not our parents , or mother tereza or the tooth fairy . 
  they look after their own interests , and they will go as far as their interests allow them to go . 
  our lenders proposed changes along with austerity ( land register , lower taxes , less public sector employees , less bureaucracy , faster justice process , abolish 3rd party taxes , stop special treatment of closed professions , etc ) . 
  did we do any of these changes ? 
  we increased taxes and hoped that the problems will go away magically . 
  it is . 
  if eu finance ministers agreed to a 2nd haircut , they would have to go back to their countries and persuade their voters that the next budget would have x % less money for them , because greece is not paying back its loans . 
  should i remind the `` polite '' comments made by other finance ministers on the subject ? 
  qe is not printing of money technically ( because at some point this money is erased ) , but for the short term and for the shake of simplicity , let 's just say it is printing of money . 
  there are two very important points to qe :, 
  1 ) it has a very low limit ( for greece , i think we would be allowed to 6-7 billion of qe ) . 
  2 ) it is of very low interest rate ( close to 0 % ) , thus they really need to be sure about getting their money back, 
  tsipras was asking for qe and ** at the same time ** he was asking for a debt relief . 
  yeah man , good plan , ask for a loan while telling everyone that you ca n't pay your loans . 
  lol circus, 
  hmmmm ? 
  the budgets of all eu countries , have payments ** to be received from greece ** , for the loans they gave us under mou2 and mou3 . 
  if a haircut is applied , then this money will partially disappear from their budgets , because our payments will be less than planned . 
  printing money devalues the currency . 
  it is an indirect haircut . 
  if it was that easy , we would just xerox 300 billion euro notes , and call it a day . 
   first of all , samaras was the one that was pressing for qe and in parallel for debt relief, 
  asking for debt relief , is different than going around telling to everyone that the greek debt can not , and will not be repaid ( varoufakis + tsipras style ) . 
  i mean the guy would not shut the fuck up about a default on the debt . 
   it surprises me that you accept so easily that some bankrupt institutions ( greek banks ) should be bailed-out by the state , at the promise that they will be revived later , but you do n't accept the same premise for greece, 
  the people do not accept the same , because this would mean that greece would be owned by the lenders . 
  remember what i wrote above about the recapitalisation of the banks : the greek state took ownership of the banks ( apart from eurobank which injected enough money and kept majority stock ) . 
   why then would n't it be more sensible to seek to inspire greek economic growth first , then when there is some money again take what the creditors are owed ? 
  this is what the creditors are asking us to do : implement the prerequisites for growth . 
  growth means new business , and new investments . 
  nobody wants to this in greece because :, 
  corporate taxes are at 30 % ( corporate tax in neighbour countries is 10-12 % ) . 
  vat is 24 % ffs !, 
  contract resolution in courts takes 10 years . 
  a customer delays payment ? 
  tough luck mate . 
  there is no complete land register ( lol i know ) , so you do n't know what kind of business you are allowed to do in a specific area . 
  you want to invest in a new hotel ? 
  tough luck buddy , and good luck dealing with all state agencies and bureaucracy that may have claim on this land ( case in point : an investor got all documents needed for a hotel + golf course in rhodes , and the ministry of culture made a claim on the same area for archaeological reasons ), 
  no solid law framework . 
  so you got all licensing in order , and you want to start doing business , right ? 
  wrong !, 
  the new minister just appointed by the new government , just signed a document stopping all activity for reason x. 
  you go to the supreme court , which allows you to resume works , so you start again right ? 
  wrong !, 
  the next minister does the same with reason y. 
  back to the supreme court you go , while you make no money and your plant is stopped ( case in point : the biggest mine in greece during the last 2 years ), 
  5 . business continuity : so you have a contract with a specific delivery date for goods . 
  you are sure that your production is up to spec and you will be ready 1 week prior to delivery date . 
  so you are good to go right ? 
  wrong !, 
  road blocks by farmers 2-3 times per year , and port blocks prevent any shipments . 
  good luck with your contract . 
  the police will not enforce the law and wait for blockades to disband by themselves . 
  tl ; dr : eu says : lower taxes in order to be able to compete and get your shit together . 
  operate like a developed nation , and then we shall see about debt relief . 
  [ ask and you shall receive ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/5yti5e/greek_activists_target_sales_of_homes_seized_over/det40s1/ ), 
  the alternative is starvation . 
  without banks , there are is no business activity and no jobs . 
  you think that you are helping them , but you are doing the exact opposite . 
  case in point : argentina . 
  when banks failed , people starved . 
  this was unthinkable for a developed nation . 
  have a look at inflation,

  the state can find you a new house on welfare . 
  the collapse of production is worse than getting a worse house, 
  so much win , excellent strategy,
