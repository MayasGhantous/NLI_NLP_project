   who won a court case against golden dawn , creating a legal precedent that allows for public officials to refuse granting public space to the party . 
  to < any  party i 'm afraid . 
  the court ruled that the mayor was innocent , because he acted on a decision of the board of patras ( not because it was g.d. specifically ) .

  because noone cares . 
   i was obviously reffering to the whole rant about greece splitting being tottally the real would be outcome, 
  read the interview of florakis in newspaper '' \u03c4\u03bf \u0392\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 '' in the 90s . 
  that was the plan that kke had in mind : a split korea style, 
  keep it up, 
  imf interstellar monetary fund . 
  here we coooooome, 
  source for ... ehmmmm science ? 
  great success, 
  you ca n't make this shit up, 
  translation : syriza is at about 25 % , nd at 35 %, 
  do n't be fooled , many syriza voters are not showing in polls because they do n't answer, 
  because hope dies last a.k.a fuck logic, 
  we greeks are very sentimental about politics and ignore hard data , history , facts and logic . 
  syriza has cashed-out on this greek trait . 
  nope , nd failed on that . 
  they went to the elections of 2015 with small promises of cutbacks on enfia , while syriza was promising 0 enfia , a return to the salary levels of 2009 , free electricity to 300,000 families , debt haircut , boobs for the ladies and hair for the balding men . 
  you see , nd thought that the voters will see through the bullshit of tsipra 's promises , check the data and see that it is impossible to implement syriza 's program . 
  they were wrong : people followed their hearts instead of their brains . 
  we all now pay the price . 
  that was the point . 
  win win win win ), 
  rings a bell ? 
  it kinda helps with the local opposition wink wink :-), 
   kapod\u00edstrias arrived in switzerland at a moment when the country was deeply divided and on the brink of civil war . 
  driven by extraordinary determination and strength of conviction , kapod\u00edstrias managed , after ten months of dialogue and negotiation , to persuade the cantons to come together to lay the foundations for the creation of today 's swiss confederation . 
  kapod\u00edstrias wrote constitutional drafts , resolutions , decisions and letters . 
  thanks to his unremitting efforts and persistence , kapod\u00edstrias was also said to be `` undeniably the most [ ... ] decisive influence '' among the envoys of the allied powers . 
  after his first mission to switzerland , each canton drafted a new constitution , the diet ( assembly of cantonal delegates ) ratified the federal constitution , civil order was restored and switzerland was recognised by the allies, 
  huston we have a problem, 
  respawn in 3 . .2 . .1 fight, 
  gg no re, 
  business as usual . 
  2 . mod its shields and boosters, 
  3 . you can now attack these capital ships ( fly to the edge of the combat zone , start killing enemy ships , tip the balance to your side and start closing on the capital ships ), 
  5 . profit ( well not really , but you will force the capital ship to jump ), 
  s-o-t-h-i-sssssss :-), 
  pause will continue after work, 
  gdp by sector, 
  100k/year ? 
  1 million ? 
  you ca n't make this shit up, 
  they can work at the mine of skouries , oh wait its license is revoked every so often . 
  they can work at the new project at `` hellinikon '' oh wait gov turned it into a refugee camp . 
  maybe they can work at smaller companies , oh wait these companies are leaving greece by the numbers because of the increased taxation . 
  maybe they can work at the new investm ... baahahhahaha ok i will stop here . 
  a working position can not be summoned out of thin air . 
  a working position exists if the state and its regulations make business sense to the one paying the working position . 
  reality 101 . 
  enjoy your stay :-), 
  my businesses ? 
  holy shitz batman i have businesses that i did n't know about . 
  thank you comrade once more for the enlightenment . 
  for once i see that you agree with me . 
  there are no jobs in greece because there is no reason to run a business , and the ones remaining do not have the funds to pay any decent wage . 
  i am writing this post from singapore . 
  i am one of the workers that decided that there is no way to work in greece either as a wager or as a freelancer . 
  in the first instance you will not get payed as the company you work for bankrupts under the weight of taxes , and if you try to do the same work as a freelancer , the state will take happily the 60 % to 70 % of your turnover . 
  where do you work by the way dear comrade ? 
  he kinged too hard but you plebs could not follow, 
  who is we though ? 
  the players that already have the big 3 , an fdl , a couple of smaller ships ? 
  it would be interesting to know what % of players are still grinding for their 1st python, 
  welcome to the flying brick club bother :-), 
  no problem bro . 
  no probleeeemoooo . 
  you got into the shithole, 
  eli5 mode on :, 
  true, 
  too soon :-), 
  wait , this is not the real one . 
  the account is 2 days old, 
  where is our real king ? 
  iddqd, 
  older model ? 
  you perv !, 
  is this real life ? 
  that 's some serious suction power . 
  i think it borders on the joke about a guy getting such a good bj , that the bed-sheets got stuck into his ass .
