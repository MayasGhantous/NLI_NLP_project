  from the article :, 
  why do we have democracies even though they suck ?

  being able to change the madman on top seems to help in democracies , but it has been the case that the madman only needed one term to turn everything to shit .

  part of it wants to , but the majority does not ( karamanlis team ) . 
  the problem is that this is the only chance we have for a change .
