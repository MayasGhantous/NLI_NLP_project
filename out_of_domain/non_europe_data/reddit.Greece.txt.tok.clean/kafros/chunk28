  he is not a very good detective though, 
  the theory of relativity is a human mathematical construct that models ( quite well ) the experimental results of our instruments . 
  it is an invention . 
  think about it : if we meet an alien civilisation , will they also be using the same model ? 
  maths itself is an invention of the human mind , a tool that helps create models ( amongst other uses ) of our world . 
  it is very possible that every civilisation in the universe ( if there are others ) invents maths . 
  ( just like it is very possible that there are species that respond to light stimuli ), 
  edit : of course i agree with your post, 
  probably the light radius . 
  enemies would ` jump ' out of darkness and hit me . 
  i do n't know if bight/dark overall made the difference . 
  the d3 cathedral levels are in a sense very similar to the barracks of d2 in terms of `` utility '' . 
  under russian history, 
  if by `` work '' you mean that we have a government that is generally accepted and prevents civil fights then : yes, 
  if by `` work '' you mean that we get the best people for the job then : no . 
  we get people who are good at getting elected . 
  you left out a very important fact : at the moment greece is covering its deficit with loans . 
  a default will stop any future loans ( as you also point in your post ) , leaving greece with all the problems it has now plus a gaping deficit hole . 
  iceland survived because it had/has trade surplus : they export more than they import . 
  if we ( greeks ) manage to do the same , then i will be the first to agree to a default . 
  by this definition , the working class is an empty set by a mere toilet service by a plumber . 
  exports are increasing and imports are decreasing . 
  the only way to get fucked is to go bankrupt , before the local companies have a good footing on foreign markets, 
  i mean none, 
  toilet service : toilet is clogged and needs repair by a plumber, 
  original `` this guy is packing ! '', 
  what i heard `` this guy is paki '' ( non native english speaker thinking wtf ? ), 
  do n't feed the troll, 
  you do not understand the importance of risk in production : bill gates is not rich because he is a capitalist . 
  he is rich because he took the risk of abandoning his studies and investing all his money and time into a product that he believed has value due to its usefulness . 
  same with henry ford ( car , chain production ) . 
  for each of these success stories , there are thousands of unsuccessful ones ( mostly because they do not produce anything of value to their customers ) . 
  it may be argued that socialism is not incompatible with such success stories , but i find two problems :, 
  why would individuals risk if there is no profit ( of some sort ) incentive ? 
  even if we assume that ( 1 ) is overcome by the sheer niceness of said individuals , how can we choose which risks to take ? 
  resources are limited , and there are too many people with ideas . 
  which ones should we try to implement ? 
  the main problem with successful products that bettered our lives , is that we can tell of the competence of the individuals which created them only after the success . 
  i think the best risk example is how dna sequencing was completed : the us government funded program had staled for a decade . 
  then comes a guy with a crazy idea ( venter / celera ) , persuades people to give him money ( resources + man hours ) , and there you have it : completion of dna sequencing . 
  greek here : this is a myth for part of the work force ( private companies 's employees ) , but a fact for a large portion of state employees . 
  there is a clause in our constitution , that does not allow firing of state employees . 
  this has led to people getting lazy without any repercussions . 
  we even had tv shows ( when hidden cameras were still allowed ) that showed people doing nothing ( reading books , doing crosswords , talking about fashion , leaving early while misreporting hours worked etc. ), 
  reporting an 8 hour shift says nothing about your productivity . 
  even if the record is true , the value of your service is the important quantity to measure , not your man-hours . 
  because people are not trained in the scientific method : experimental results are not taken into account , and logic is not used as a tool to ` walk ' through the data . 
  in our time it is very peculiar that the following ` ideas ' exist :, 
  fortune tellers : our non-deterministic universe prohibits future predictions with accuracy . 
  religion : too much contradiction with experimental results ; countless logic inconsistencies, 
  communism ( amongst other political ideas ) : 100 % failure of all applications . 
  has been tried on ` twin nations ' ( e.g. 
  germany , korea ) and failed . 
  one of its basic premises ( work according to ability , receive according to need ) has not been scientifically researched in order to provide an answer about genetic disposition to it or not ( example for related species : bonobos share , chimpanzees do not ), 
  / thread, 
  no one can hear you eat ice cream, 
  i am referring to the scientific method - period . 
  the evidence points to a non working or non implementable system : data follows :, 
  has been tried over a big period ( 80 + years ) . 
  has been tried by many nations and all races . 
  has been tried within the same nation on the same period a part of said nation was doing something else : east-west germany , north-south korea, 
  final implementation result on all cases : failure, 
  the downvotes reinforce my ` pet-theory ' that data are not taken into account . 
  your point points 1-3 ( even if true ) have nothing to do with my original post . 
  if you read what i wrote you will find that i did not use data from the ` blackbook of communism ' , nor did i theorize about colonialism . 
  as for the cold war , even if that was the cause for ussr 's communist collapse , it does not explain the rest of the communist collapses of other nations ( outside europe ) . 
  final point : a successful system should be able to withstand external pressure . 
  i see : scientific method can not be applied to political science . 
  thank you my friend , this is the best comment so far, 
  first sentence : ad hominem ( nice start bro ), 
  no true communism fallacy : so sad that through those 80 years of communism no one told them the truth :-), 
  true , but the ones left out comprise such a small percentage of the worlds population ( aborigines , american indians etc ) . 
  my point is that race did not change the result of the communism ` experiment ', 
  west germany made better products . 
  for example , there is no excuse why west germany cars/trucks were better ( and were imported in greater numbers by other countries ), 
  korea : you argue that trade barriers caused the technological and economical gap . 
  reality check : greece ( commanding 20 % of the world 's merchant fleet ) has never built ships in n. korea , and there were never any trade sanctions blocking such business . 
  furthermore , shipbuilding is a thing in which koreans excel at . 
   no system can survive on it 's own, 
  ussr and its satellite states + china , commanded half of the worlds resources . 
  what were they missing that the other half of the world had , and refused to provide to them ( leading to their collapse according to your theory ), 
   karl marx himself pointed out in the mid 1800 's that any economic revolution could not be successfully brought to conclusion without at least the approval of the most advanced nations, 
  maybe the country that send the first thing in space and was using nuclear energy , was advanced enough . 
  you can never have ` pure data ' because we do n't have ` laboratory planets ' populated by human clones . 
  but the data we do have , give no success stories for communism . 
  i think this says something . 
  yes : implementation of communism in a country will destroy its economy ( as it happened to all the countries that tried it ), 
  sorry , do n't own a country . 
  all countries in recorded history ( thus not anecdotes by definition ) that implemented communism have collapsed . 
  our conversation of course had ended on your previous post , which concluded a `` http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_absurdum '' when ( according to you ) the ** scientific method ** can not be applied to a ** science ** field, 
  china started to improve as soon as they dumped socialism for a free market . 
  they are still a one-party system without elections ( which makes them a dictatorship i suppose ) , but they now run a capitalist economy . 
  depends on your definition of ` collapse ' . 
  when your country has famine , and most of the population lives below poverty the line , i use the word ` collapse ' . 
  the scientific method is observation by definition . 
  observe , theorize , observe , theorize etc. . . 
  i quote your protip :, 
   ** scientific method can not be applied ** to history/political ** science **, 
  if you can not find the absurdity , i can not help you . 
  ` political scientists ' use the scientific method through statistics .
