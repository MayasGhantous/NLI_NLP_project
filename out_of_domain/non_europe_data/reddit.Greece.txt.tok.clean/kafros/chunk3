  mathematics gets a free pass from this rule , because proof is contained within the proposition ( you do n't need to experimentally check that triangles with sides length of the form a ^ 2 = b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 are ** right ** ) . 
  so string theory as a pure mathematical construct is ( ? ), 
  science . 
  what makes feynman popular amongst science loving people , is his obsession in teaching how to think . 
  this is missing in our world . 
  we get to solve problems in school without getting the `` thinking skills '' taught to us . 
  it is like starting to do sports without a basic physical training ( running , jumping , stretching exercises etc ) . 
  also he is one of the few people who can describe very complex ideas in a very simple way , and captivate the interest of his audience . 
  if you are not a mathematician or a physicist , feynman is your best starting point , hence the abundance of posts in reddit . 
  i worked hard not to downvote you :-) you miss the point completely . 
  for pasok : it was very * socialist * of them to make state telco and electric power industries public in the stock market . 
  even more socialist was lifting any bans present ( in the late 90s ) for creating your own business ( they broke state monopoly ) . 
  please check some facts . 
  such a long paragraph on socialism without `` your '' definition on what makes a socialist country . 
  let me ask : would you consider the following country socialist or capitalist ? 
  you have the right to own land and build on it, 
  you can own your own business and provide any services/products you want ( short of nuclear plants , private armies , environmental-safety hazards ), 
  you can sell your products/services for prices agreed by your customers without state intervention ( e.g. 
  state can not force you to sell cars , electronics at a fixed state price ), 
  this is what eu countries are like . 
  you get a stick up the ass for state monopolies or `` closed '' trades ( we got one here and we are still pulling it out or our ass by getting fined ) . 
  no party is going to change these three things even it is called scapp ( socialist communist anarchy proletariat party ), 
  ** edit ** : formatting, 
  too long ... !, 
  as a capitalist i also applaud pasok for ending state monopolies . 
  i just find it non socialist . 
  the fact that you as a marxist also applauds , leaves me wondering . 
  my criticism of pasok is that the * so * which stands for socialist in the party 's name is only decorative and they should get over it . 
   and not all of the above would even be in contradiction of the principles of many modern directions of marxism such as for example eurocommunism, 
  let me get this straight ( because i specifically asked what if all are applicable in a country ) : ability to own whatever you want , produce whatever you want , sell it to whatever price you want ( with the agreement of the customer ) and keeping the profits to yourself only ( minus taxes ) is communist or even socialist ? 
  if so then count me in as a communist socialist too . 
  the main problem of the left is that the 20th century ended and nobody told them ;-), 
  have an up arrow . 
  nothing comes close to games value for money . 
  this is true for good games . 
  and l4d is a good game . 
  i wonder why dawkins never uses dolphins ( sorry for rhyme ) or other sea mammals as an example against intelligent creation :, 
  they can not breathe under water, 
  they do not lay eggs ( they give birth like the rest of the mammals ), 
  they do not have scales, 
  they have fat under their skin ( like other mammals ), 
  they have useless bone fingers ( which create the front pair of fins ), 
  they have pelvic bones, 
  they have a constant body temperature like all mammals, 
  the above gives two possible scenarios :, 
  a. dolphins are the decedents of a land animal, 
  this is god 's practical joke on the dolphin, 
  ** edit : ** correction after grrlscientist 's reply below, 
  i do n't know to be honest . 
  i should have been more specific : he never uses the example in the videos of the debates he has with creationists . 
  and he is asked a ** show us the evidence ** question from them while they reject fossils , geology , dna , nuclear dating as proof . 
  dolphins ( and sea mammals in general ) are such a `` now '' proof . 
  do the stalinists still want to kill the trotskyists ? 
  it is so funny for anyone looking from the outside , to see the fragmentation of the socialist ideologies . 
  in my country we have the communist part m-l ( marxist leninist ) and also the communist party l-m ( leninist marxist ) -- i shit you not !, 
  add to that 2 different kinds of communist party ( interior , exterior ) and then you get into a sea of smaller communist parties with funky names . 
  since you were a part of these movements , and you seem to be a reasonable person for a discussion , i have a question :, 
  did n't it ever occurred to anyone in the group , that you were in a similar position to religion : you are aware that there are numerous others , but somehow your very own is the ** correct one ** . 
  after seeing communist countries failing one after the other , how did you kept the faith towards `` the next socialist try will be successful '' ? 
  i agree , he shows fossils with the transition of the blow-hole . 
  but bear in mind that these people want `` more transitional '' stages . 
  my argument above does not use fossils , dna , nuclear dating or other valid scientific tools . 
  it is just logic plus the current `` stage '' of the dolphin as observed today . 
  lol sorry !, 
  my english sucks . 
  i will correct it now . 
  thanks for the correction, 
  so what you say in summarry is : it is not the system 's fault , it is the people 's fault ( system/theory is fine ) . 
  they did not try/implement the system correctly . 
  has it occured to you that the system is non-implementable ? 
  of course ( most ) people are greedy , stupid , incompetent , lazy and power hungry . 
  any social/political theory ** must ** take these facts into consideration . 
  capitalism works with the shitty behaviour of man . 
  if socialism/communism could work , then so would cristianity : do no evil and give half of your belongings to the poor . 
  cristians do not execute these two simple rules and risk eternal suffering . 
  what could possible make the average citizen stop being human : greedy , lazy , stupid ? 
  6 paragraphs on the `` do not evil '' ( which is not part of my argument , i could n't care less about cristian `` morality '' ) and nothing on the `` give half of your belongings to the poor '' ? 
  lets assume that a revolution goes down the way you describe and all wealth is redistributed . 
  then what ? 
  why would the next bill gates , google duo , craig vender ( celera - human genome ) , ford , etc etc , bust their ass working ? 
  probably so that they can share all the money they make with me and you right ? 
  if marxism agrees that people act on ** self interest ** ( i quote from your text ) why would smart , competent , hard working people , want to share anything with you ? 
  after the redistribution of wealth they will just idle . 
  the assumption that they will work hard so that we can re-distribute is against self-interest by definition . 
   why did n't he ? 
  clearly the money beyond a certain level of comfort was not the driving factor . 
  true . 
  the driving force becomes going from the 500 wealthier people list to the 100 list and then to the 10 list . 
  after the 1st billion , money looses any meaning , but power does not . 
  by the way , we already have partial redistribution in capitalism in the form of taxes . 
  homework for you : what do wealthy people do when a higher redistribution of wealth is applied/planned ? 
  ** -- spoiler alert -- **, 
  they leave the country . 
  uk tried to raise taxation for shipping companies . 
  as soon as they started planning to leave uk , the government cancelled the taxation plans ( they would loose all income by the termination of business on their soil ) . 
  the level of progress is the most important thing . 
  which society do you think has a better living : one with a very good system and our level of technology , or one with a `` bad '' system but with a tech level that uses robots in order to produce everything ? 
  technology is king . 
  we are healthier and richer because of it , not because of the improvment of our social systems . 
  producing food today is orders of magnitude cheaper than before , bacause of machinery and logistics .
