  do a flip ( with apologies to futurama and bender ), 
  a guy wants to make a parachute jump from 100,000 feet . 
  beat him to it without a parachute . 
  new l4d special : `` 84 year old polish '', 
  peeeelz here ( share the wealth brother ), 
  quantum mechanics tells us that it is impossible to take a `` reading '' of yourself ( the state of every single atom ) without distorting what we are measuring ( `` yourself '' ) . 
  so what we are tele-porting is not an exact copy of `` yourself '' . 
  on the consciousness part : if neurons are a deterministic system ( i.e. 
  non quantum ) , then i do not think that the changes introduced to the state of your atoms during the `` reading '' stage , will change your memories/personality . 
  ** edit : ** we do not know the answer on my last assertion about the deterministic/non-deterministic nature of neurons . 
  combo whores unite, 
  poor woman . 
  her good looks are a blessing and a curse :-), 
  the sign of real men . 
  everyone can fuck a beauty . 
  try hitting this pussies, 
  * puts hand under his belt al stule * , upvotes, 
  good point . 
  relativity is also counter intuitive , but the observation of stars that should be `` hidden '' behind the sun during a solar eclipse , persuaded scientists that einstein was onto something . 
  the slowest speed with respect to which frame of reference ? 
  there is no absolute frame of reference ( no ether ) . 
  i am rephrasing : `` what is the smallest speed that can be measured between two different inertial frames -- the smallest relative speed measured '' ? 
  ok let 's do this !, 
  speed can be measured using clocks on board the inertial frames . 
  a person on inertial frame a sends a photon to be reflected off a mirror on inertial frame b. 
  the smallest possible speed will be achieved when the photon is back on receiver a without any change on clock a. 
  the answer boils down to this now : what is the smallest `` space '' that can differentiate `` here '' ( ref frame a ) and `` there '' ( ref frame b ) . 
  is there a smalest quanta of time that can separate two events ? 
  ( firing/receiving ) ? 
  lol i failed !, 
  let 's go shopping, 
  we have never observed faster than light particles ( tachyons ) . 
  how will you know you have detected one ? 
  if the particle is ultra-lightonic ( lol sorry ) you will `` see '' it coming towards and away from you at the same time ; imagine this :, 
  o = observer , t = tachyon , p = photon , t = time, 
  -      direction of tachyon, 
  t --  p o ( tachyon reflects a photon emitted by the observer ), 
  p t o ( tachyon has overtaken the photon ), 
  p o t ( photon is still on its way to the observer , and tachyon has gone past him ), 
  p o p < -- t ( tachyon reflects another photon ), 
  pop t ( tachyon is way past the observer , and both photons arrive at the observer ), 
  wooosh is the sound of the joke going over your head dawkins . 
  they are using lawyers in order to sort out the ** truth ** of our world . 
  i hate it when a perfect joke is spoiled, 
  have you ever played a `` god game '' on your pc ? 
  spent the first hours building the world and then finding out that killing everything is actually more fun that building only to get bored of the game ? 
  ** evidence supporting my theory : ** god creates world , finds out killing is fun , kills almost everything . 
  then he kills some more . 
  he then gets bored and he is afk for the last 2500 years . 
  we all live in a simulation running at `` plank time '' step :-), 
  theoretical physicists were afraid of the big crunch ( closed universe ) before the accelerating universe was observed . 
  i am afraid of the big `` crash '' or the mighty `` exit '' . 
  a being that knows everything and has powers to do anything . 
  of course this definition is contradicting itself as there are things that can not be done by such an entity : god destroying himself into oblivion ( hence loosing his superpowers ) , or taking the super powers out of him/herself . 
  a reversal of dog . 
  in soviet russia dog proves you . 
  the question is why cristians kill people ? 
  as an atheist you could make a point that the worst thing would be getting caught if you are unlucky and put on death row ( if you are too unlucky ) . 
  if you believe in god , there is no fucking way you will get away ( oh it rhymes ) . 
  plus you will be sucking satan 's cock for eternity . 
  if cristians actually believed , they would be living in a glass bubble trying their best not to interact with the world and `` sin '' by mistake , hoping every minute is their last and if not , that they do n't fuck up eternity during the next minute . 
  theists can go `` fermat '' of your ass with a `` remarkable proof '' quote on the side :-), 
  it 's designers all the way down baby !, 
  unless the designeringy thingy is curved onto itself and there is no beginning designer , like a mobius strip . 
  nice video , but futile . 
  it makes the assumption that theists will use reason and form coherent arguments . 
  if they could , they would not be theists now , would they :-), 
  you got lucky man . 
  imagine doing business with people who can not use reason . 
  business success is hard . 
  you need to use your brain . 
  how can a person come to valid conclusions if he believes that desert goat herders got the answer to life universe and everything 2500 years ago . 
  can you trust that they will investigate facts and use logic in order to decide what 's best for the company , or just believe what they like ( or how much they like the person feeding them bs ) . 
  you got lucky , never forget that . 
  a cristian is someone who owns a bible . 
  an atheist is someone who has read the bible . 
  if all of bible was made into a movie , we would witness the best disaster porn ever !, 
  this is the best answer . 
  no new kidneys grow if you remove them , no hands , legs , eyes , ears etc. 
  you may get an answer of the sort : god has a special plan for them , in which case you should get a special plan for changing gf :-), 
  they had a late start , they are through middle ages as we speak . 
  give them 600 years time and they will be were catholics are now . 
  next question, 
  aha an optimist !, 
  i tend to view theists ' brains as halh empty . 
  you seem to see them as half full . 
  i would assume the existence of an ups . 
  problem is when his god friend brings him the new distro of universix , and we get formatted/re-installed . 
  you are right , i forgot this back door . 
  it will be funny having hitler calling us noobs from heaven for forgeting to repent before our final breath . 
  adulterer apostates of islam are really screwed 161 % of the time every time . 
  i like that both questions add up to 91 . 
  what is the rest 9 % thinking ? 
  final destination 5 . 
  i can lol your death . 
  he got that wrong . 
  pluto is a dog in a cartoon , everyone knows this,
