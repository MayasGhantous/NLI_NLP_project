  depends on their stance on quran . 
  if they take it up as god 's infallible word , then they are obliged/required to kill infidels . 
  if they take it as literature , fan fiction , a parable , then ... wtf am i talking about ? 
  lol back to reality, 
  dawkins and tyson are interesting , and if you do n't agree you can fuck off :-), 
  sorry for downvoting you but you exceeded 20 points, 
  ** edit : ** -1 redundant ( fuck off slashdot , i did not scroll to see the comment below before posting , go ahead shoot me ), 
  christian : my god existis, 
  muslim : mine too, 
  christian : no he does not . 
  there is only one ; mine, 
  muslim : prove it, 
  christian : miracles : a talking snake right on first chapter, 
  muslim : i see your talking snake and raise you a flying horse ( prophets chosen locomotion to meet allah ), 
  christian : i see your flying horse and raise you a virgin birth, 
  how does your iq of 143 deal with the above ? 
  you forgot the most important one : ** brain washing ** . 
  especially , ideas that are introduced to us in a very young age are very difficult to grow out of , even if the facts/logic point against what we think/believe . 
  repetition has also a key role here . 
  propaganda works this way and has been very successful ( even to this day of reason ), 
  why do you think christianity encourages prayer at the church ? 
  jesus was specific : pray wherever your like . 
  there is a better way in my opinion : use only their sources as evidence and ask them questions ( you asume they are the `` experts '' here and you are the student ) that can increase your understanding on religion . 
  example : ( their source = bible , their assertion = infallible word of god ), 
  question : why did an ** all knowing ** god ask eve about covering her naked body ? 
  why did he bothered to tell them not to eat from the tree ? 
  did n't he already know they would ? 
  god uses aoe magic , that 's all, 
  if people actually bothered to read 50 pages from the bible , there would be no need for an introduction . 
  killing starts very early in the book :-), 
  try making a cross in a mosque or bend over towards mecca in a church . 
  just before they start beating you up , make a point that it is the same god . 
  post pics . 
  2300 years is about 115 generations . 
  not a lot of time in evolutionary scales in order to increase intelligence . 
  plus stupid people have more kids than smart people and there is no natural selection pressure favoring clever people at the moment ... ... 
  humor aside ( which you seem to find distracting in this conversation ) , how can it be the same god when the religions give different attributes to him/her/it : a loving god for all his creations ( at least of the new testament ) is much different from a `` kill all infidels '' god . 
  if you want to take the conversation to the next intellectual level , you could say that there is a god ( one god ) no matter what religions say about him ( treat religions as pure human constructs -- which i am sure they are ) . 
  this god is constraint at least by logic in the possible attributes that he may have , for example : an all knowing being is incapable of choice -- all future is pre-set by the ** all knowing attribute ** . 
  an all powerfull and good god is also impossible in the presence of evil ( see epicurus for detailed info ) . 
  all powerfull by itself is also contradicting : can he make something so massive that he will be incapable of moving it ( etc etc add here millions of impossible scenarios ), 
  if you are still reading , the complexity of a super being requires an even more complex creator/engineer for it . 
  it is all `` creators '' down to the bottom . 
  on a more serious note : the last 150 years , with the advancment of science , we can heal ourselfs beyond the capabilities of our bodies/immune systems . 
  we have also enough food to go around ( at least on some parts of the world ) . 
  the evolutionary pressure is off . 
  my father is the third child in his family ( born 1943 on a small village without electricity , utilities etc ) and is also the eldest . 
  the first two died within the first months of their births from various sicknesses . 
  his kids ( myself , brother , sister ) all survived child diseases because of vaccinations and antibiotics . 
  i would assert , that my father was the last one of my direct dissentents to be `` naturally selected '' . 
  ** edit : ** intelligence is also not a trait that can differentiate survival from death on a modern society where we make sure that everyone lives . 
  cue in hitler reference in 3 . .2 . .1 :-), 
  i know the penalty for apostacy is death in islam . 
  quite brave of you to be honest . 
  i would probably fake it and go to mosque with a hidden psp ( do some combos on `` god of war '' while bent to pray ), 
  `` he will be back '' . 
  lol, 
  spot on sir . 
  the bible is just fan fiction , and as such should not be taken seriously . 
  i live my life under the prime directive from star trek :-), 
  ah now i see . 
  he meant `` love '' but they wrote `` hate '' . 
  it is a common typo when you think of the layout of roman typewriters of 100ad . 
  there are always problems with fan fiction . 
  things get out of canon and then reviewing is needed . 
  a female friend of mine once told me that men have only to do two things : flirt with females and fuck them . 
  the first is in decline , and from your post i can see the second going down the drain too . 
  we are obsolete :-(, 
  maybe it is her way of telling you not to fuck her ass, 
  i am here to congrats louf on his downvote triumph . 
  keep it up man ( i mean down ), 
  wtf noone posted for unreal tournament ? 
  6 barrel rocket launcher motherfucker !!, 
  how about doing your postgrad studies in duslectistics ? 
  not only you spoiled my joke , i even misspelled the subject matter of your postgrad studies ( not that it exists , but if it ever does i guess it is not going to be spelled like that ), 
  of course they were !, 
  also , any similarities of past religions to christianity are there because satan forged them in advance . 
  hp does not have an entity impregnating a woman to give birth to it/him/herself in order to cleanse us from a sin it/he/she inflicted . 
  god : note to self : if i even change my mind again , there is no need to be nailed onto a cross i guess, 
  we think very highly of ourselves ( if we did not i assert we would not be around as a species to be posting @ reddit ), 
  accepting your argument , puts him in a position of ignorance and/or stupidity ( i order to believe a false claim one has to be presented with bad data and/or invalid logic ) . 
  this behavior is not found in religion only . 
  most people will not accept that they are `` wrong '' about something . 
  the viruses evolve and can not be killed by normal prayer duh !, 
  should i down vote you for not knowing what a cult is , and asseting that atheists `` save '' people in a religious way , or up vote you and bring this gem of pure stupidity to the masses ? 
  i am in a superposition of up/down vote which i hope will collapse to the observable state as soon as i press `` save '' . 
  you do n't . 
  you just point that going to hospitals is a waste of time since it is an inferior solution to praying . 
  you let natural selection to the rest of the work . 
  next question pls !, 
  it is @deprecated . 
  you can still use it , but the new api issued by the great programmer of all , recommends using the nt . 
  just delete your account and we will pretend that you actually got the joke and you tried to metajoke . 
  was the species change difficult to start with ? 
  it will be forever impossible to disprove god ( s ) ' existence . 
  they can always reside in the `` non observable '' universe . 
  same here . 
  but let 's face it . 
  ut2004 is way to difficult for the average player . 
  ut3 's nerfing was not a surprise .
