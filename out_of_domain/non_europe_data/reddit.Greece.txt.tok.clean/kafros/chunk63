   the easiest way to look at why it 's a lie is the space war, 
  yes , because ussr put a man on the moon , made computers to fly by-wire spaceships , and today 's gps is russian tech ... oh wait ... :-), 
   once again , technology and not capitalism, 
  true , but papandreou did not say that . 
  he said that higher tech resulted from capitalism than socialism . 
  was he right ? 
  you bet your ass he was :, 
  computers, 
  internet, 
  moon landing, 
  dna decoding, 
  nuclear fission ( soviet a-bomb was a copy after a successful spy operation . 
  gg to them though ), 
  gps and telco satellites, 
  ussr , put the first satellite in space ( using german tech , just as us did ) , and then sat on their asses . 
  you are typing using on a us computer , build by us vlsi technology , on us software ( from low level os , to high-level markup language ) , having your data routed via us satellites on a protocol invented by us darpa , and your point is what exactly ? 
  experience shows that they do . 
  unless you think that americans ( or germans , or japanese ) are smarter than the rest of us . 
  production is made in china , technology is western . 
  also china is a free market . 
  the production is owned by the stock holders . 
  china is a communist dictatorship ( as i have previously pointed out ) with a free market . 
  if it was a ** communist economy ** as you say , i would not be able to own a factory in china . 
  but i can , if i want to . 
   experience also shows that shortly after family guy airs an episode about a celebrity , they die,

  do we have any proof ? 
  ... therefore , capitalism results in better/more technology . 
  this is the point papandreou was making according to the observations of the era when the article was written . 
  there will always be technology , because there is always progress . 
  we had technology even under the worst , most unfair and brutal systems of antiquity . 
  it is not the distribution of wealth , but competition which changes the `` game '' . 
  this is incorrect . 
  correct . 
  nope .

  there is only one viable solution : a low flat tax . 
  any other system , gives incentives to hire accountants and lawyers to find loopholes , because there will always be loopholes . 
  tax laws are created by people , and people create non-perfect things . 
  all states are fighting a loosing battle : the government tries to patch loopholes , but accountants move quicker and find new ways of avoiding tax ( avoiding = doing it legally ) . 
  the result ? 
  an overly complicated tax system with 100s of special rules and cases , sometimes completely non-enforceable even by law abiding businesses, 
   second , who 's to say that businesses would n't try to avoid taxes even then ? 
  there is nothing to avoid ( avoid = being legal ) , there are no lower taxing brackets to enter . 
  they can steal ( by not invoicing customers for example ) , but this is a problem of all possible tax systems . 
  a flat tax , is still a tax on a percentage . 
  this redistributes wealth . 
  lets take a flax tax of 20 % :, 
  my small business makes 10,000 e/year and it will pay 2,000 e, 
  your mega corp makes 10,000,000 e/year and it will pay 2,000,000 e, 
   why do n't you just say `` i would like a minimal state without any welfare and total economic liberty for the rich '' ? 
  i am not saying that anywhere , nor am i implying it . 
  but keep on fighting what you imagine that i am saying , do n't let me interrupt your internal dialogue :-), 
  on my example above , the state has 2,002,000 from these 2 businesses for welfare, 
  but again , keep on fighting the invisible enemy :-), 
   like most right-wing libertarians , you, 
  ca n't stop laughing, 
  flat tax is still a percentage tax , but it is fixed for all : let 's say 20 % . 
  if i get taxed at 40 % , you get taxed at 0 % , and companies get taxed at 26 % , then there is a big incentive to play around with numbers , and get a lower tax . 
  this is what accountants and tax lawyers do . 
  in my example , they will instruct me to make a company that has as a sole purpose to bring me down from an income tax of 40 % , down to a corporate tax of 26 % . 
  all this will be done legally . 
  instead of being an employee with a 40 % tax , i will have a company that will service my previous employer . 
  you get a 0 % tax because of your low income , and you are my brother .
