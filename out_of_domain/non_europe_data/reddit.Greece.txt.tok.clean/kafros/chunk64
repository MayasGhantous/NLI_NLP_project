  it will make sense to move some money to you ( as a consultancy fee ) . 
  as a result , you pay a little tax now , but you save me a much bigger tax from my company . 
  the ways to trick the system are only bound by the imagination of the accountants, 
  it is a loosing battle, 
   you still need to define what counts as income/wealth, 
  not relevant for taxing reasons . 
  what counts is profit : turnover - expenses, 
   because of it , flat tax benefits higher income brackets, 
  it does , but it will also benefit the state because you have no incentive to hide your money elsewhere . 
  at the moment , business owners prefer to be taxed in bulgaria at 12 % instead of the 26 % of greece , even though they operate in greece . 
  this means 0 * 26 % = 0euro for greece . 
  of course , having a company in bulgaria has an overhead , so the effective `` tax '' is close to 16 % , and it is not very convenient to have your money there ( the owner must do some numbers voodoo in order to remain legal ) . 
  with a flat tax of 20 % it is now beneficial for the business owner to be taxed in greece : no more accounting voodoo , and he will pay something very close to what he is now . 
  the state income is now non-zero . 
  what i describe , is the reality as it is now . 
  but of course , if you ever looked at reality you would n't write bullshit . 
  keep living in the dreamland of syriza , and watch as invoicing flies out of greece .

  without an atmosphere you are under a constant meteorite bombardment , thus you have to go deep underground .
