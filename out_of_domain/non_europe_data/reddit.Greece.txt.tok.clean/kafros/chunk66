  it is a monetary union by definition since we share a common currency and it is also our sole currency . 
  if you mean fiscal union , this is already on the way . 
  state budgets seem to be on a path of approval by eu , before being voted into law at the state level . 
  i am of the opinion that monetary union , without fiscal union leads to disaster . 
  i am also of the opinion , that fiscal union will fail .

  austerity is not a choice my friend . 
  you can not flip a switch that reads `` austerity '' to the off position and call it a day . 
  austerity is the poverty of a state that collects 50 billion euro from taxes and has expenses of 70 billion euro ( 2009 gr budget , loan obligations excluded ) . 
  what do you think happens ? 
  yes naurgul , you have said it 1000 times , and the answer is the same : we can not get any more loans at the moment , or print money . 
  so we have to make a living with the money available to the state . 
  it is never too late to go full retard . 
  just watch us shooting ourselves in the foot . 
  grab a beer and enjoy, 
   trying to fix the bug, 
  this is exactly what i am saying . 
  does the state need more money ? 
  up the production and there will be more money . 
  the greek state in its current bureaucratic and protectionist form , is a death sentence for business and production . 
  until then , the state will have to live with what it collects . 
  a part of syriza believes this bullshit . 
  they are called `` the left wing '' of syriza and they amount to about 30 % of the party members . 
  i do not expect any of these plans to go ahead , this is just a sales pitch . 
  i believe the syriza government will ask for a new loan , and vote for a new memorandum . 
  i do not expect its `` left wing '' to vote on it . 
  oh you want to fix the eurozone ? 
  ahhh right !!!!,
