  true, 
  3x0 .15 + 2x0 .15 + 2x0 .15 = 1.05, 
   ok , i dont know that much about greece politics, 
  it 's ok , neither does syriza . 
  they have invented a new kind of politics : quantum politics . 
  for each political position they give 2 opposite answers that ( in their mind ) can co-exist simultaneously :, 
  we will abolish the memorandum + we will not abolish the memorandum but re-negotiate the memorandum, 
  our banks are unstable + our banks are stable since they passed the stress test ( both said by the party leader during a single interview ), 
  there is no money + we will expand state expenditure for increases in pensions , salaries , xmas gifts , free electricity for 300,000 families ( with the concurrent decrease of some taxes ), 
  so we are either at a scientific political breakthrough of the importance of general relativity and qm , or they are just bull-shitting us . 
  i let you be the judge :-), 
  ( my point was flight of capital due to tax rate difference across borders ), 
  who do you think wins ? 
  please rephrase, 
  adjustments are made . 
  doable ? 
  ( machinery , electronics , fuel , chemicals , etc ) . 
  both, 
  no deaths or violence \u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03ae, 
  scientific data disagrees : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation#twin_studies,

  option 1 or 2 ? 
   the banks went largely unpunished, 
  you ca n't punish a bank without fucking over the customers .

  so what ? 
  just wait and see, 
  article 14 . read it, 
  depends . 
  in 2011 , the country 's public debt reached $ 355.141 billion, 
  public debt : $ 317.499 billion ( q2 2014 est. 
  tl ; dr : we ca n't even math cause retards lol, 
  iceland is one of those countries that export more than they import . 
  why is this relevant you may ask ? 
  when a country goes bankrupt and its currency turns to shit , the first problem is the lack of goods needed to feed the people and run production . 
  this problem disappears if the `` world '' wants your stuff more than you want theirs . 
  you can even use another currency ( e.g. 
  $ ) and continue trading , there will be no lack of supplies . 
  greece has an export to import ratio of 1:4 . 
  so if we go bust you will see a lack of goods of about 80 % . 
  remember : currency is just a tool of exchange . 
  in product value you will be forced to exchange at 1:1 since you will no longer have the extra money given by eu ( eu funds for \u0395\u03a3\u03a0\u0391 , re-capitalization of banks , mini-loans when the budget is not balanced ),
