  pws to ekanes to short link esy ? 
  yes . 
  jew american banker here . 
  it iz zee germans fault :-), 
  we get ruled by the people we deserve ( through our votes ) . 
  unfortunately this is the big problem of democracy , but we do not have a better system . 
  some people argue for `` direct democracy '' , but i can not see how the level of understanding needed for an educated vote , can be reached by the average voter . 
  the memorandum for instance , is a 500 page , highly technical document . 
  do we expect voters to read it and understand it on their spare time ? 
  yes, 
  yes, 
  we shall see on the battle field . 
  edit : no one cares about \u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1, 
  and we should also be able to understand it . 
  what is your feeling about the level of understanding of complicated matters by the average voter ? 
  are they also going to give 50 % of their money for the relief of the eu citizens who will pay the bill ? 
  if yes , i am on their side . 
  otherwise , talking is cheap . 
  try to make a list of names and specific crimes and i am on your side, 
   specific crimes, 
  what was their crime ? 
  tax evasion ? 
  ( you need an official record from the bank with all transactions because an excel file is no proof of anything , and you also need a statement from the tax office saying that this has not already been declared on previous tax-forms ), 
  but , let 's assume ( * ) that all was tax evaded and we get 2bn euros . 
  we need about 340bn to close the bill . 
  who do we indict next and for what ? 
  ( * ) assume that swiss banks give out their clients statements , and that all deposits were unaccounted for . 
  bank debt in contrast to other kinds of private debt , is already on the shoulders of eu citizens , because banks hold the money of eu citizens already . 
  nothing was `` shifted '' as you say . 
  you are viewing the same problem ( which is : irresponsible lending from banks ) , from a different accounting point of view . 
   maybe bailing out stakeholders is more acceptable, 
  stakeholders got the long shaft in their ass . 
  if you held 100,000 euro of eurobank shares in 2009 , you now have about 5,000 euro worth of shares . 
  please take 1 hour this sunday to choose your dinner for the rest of the year :, 
  chicken, 
  chicken, 
  chicken, 
  thank you :-), 
  have they reached a conclusion based on radiometric dating , on the date the tomb was erected ? 
  i mentioned eurobank because i know the numbers . 
  check the historic stock price of the banks you quote and you will see also great losses . 
  you confuse book keeping with economics . 
  the citizen lost part of his money when his bank lended said money to greece . 
  the bank could have avoided bumping the toxic bond to ecb by telling the citizen ta x % of his money is gone . 
  instead his bank money is intact but he will pay the hole in the ecb with his taxes . 
  same problem with any accounting point of view, 
  during winter time in greece you can plant coins in the soil for money production . 
  you may harvest the 50euro bills within 3 months if the weather is good . 
  syriza calls this the moneytree and it is a revolution in agriculture . 
  tl ; dr : voters are retarded , brace for impact, 
  syriza thinks like a 5 year old , so this is easy : they are trying to gain leverage against eu by playing hard-ball . 
  leverage will come handy in a month or so , when financial agreements will take place . 
  you mean when russia had money to give . 
  with the current sanctions and the current oil prices , russian money is very good for toilet paper, 
  that 's my point . 
  do you think they are going to be scared now ? 
  and since we are talking history : what did putin reply to cyprus pledge for money ? 
  ra-ra-ras ** putin ** lover of the tsipras team, 
  that was when russia did not have a devaluation of their currency by 100 % ( 0.03 usd to 0.015 usd ) in 1 year . 
  we will ask putin for euros , and he will oblidge now that they cost him double what they did when he said no to cyprus ... 
  yes , thanks mistyped, 
  this would be a perfect answer , if at the end of it he talked about the matter at hand . 
  is it too much to ask politicians to talk on topic ? 
  could n't he put at the end : `` onto the point , we agree/disagree with the sanctions '', 
  a clear reply is so simple : we agree ( or disagree ) , but next time consult with us as per procedure . 
  noobs, 
  / thread, 
  brace for impact ? 
  computer says that you have 1000euro . 
  the bank vault has 100euro . 
  900euro has been given as loans to businesses , homeowners and credit card holders . 
  the 900 euro is not being repaid at the moment . 
  this gap is filled up by the european central bank when you withdraw money . 
  we are in a collision course with the european union and the european central bank . 
  tl ; dr : current government retardation level critical . 
  man your stations, 
  get on with the program man :-), 
  tl ; dr : no-one knows . 
  syriza is very cryptic about the salvation plan for greece . 
  in terms of money source , they either have something ground breaking in mind , or they are bullshitting us . 
  i give 1/10 chance on the first scenario . 
  to katalaves ki apo monos sou . 
  alliws cool , ta eggywmai ki egw :-), 
  he did ' t get the `` write detailed \u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 memo '' . 
  fixed . 
  \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03c9 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg3stlxpz2w, 
  space rts , full 3d movement , battle formations , resource collection etc. 
  lizard people !, 
  ( apologies to archimidis ), 
  exoun 17.7 trillion gdp , kai to $ einai reserve currency . 
  the hundreds of billions of euros in so-called bailouts did not help greece -- all they did was bail out imprudent lenders and euroland elites . 
  varoufakis said the government will maintain a primary surplus ( ie after payment of interest , as stated in the original ) in 1 % to 1.5 % of gdp , even if this means that syriza , the left party controls the coalition government will not succeed all commitments for public expenditure to which elected ( google translated ), 
  so syriza does not guarantee the memorandum , but guarantees its terms :-), 
  there is a saying in greek : we rename `` meat '' to `` fish '' so that we can eat it while fasting . 
  it does not make economic sense . 
  if the debt is written off , other countries will follow suit and request the same terms . 
  if 1 or 2 big economies like italy or spain write their debts off , forget the euro , germany can not keep them afloat . 
  the dilemma is :, 
  write the greek debt off and collapse the euro for certain as countries request/do the same, 
  let greece default , and ** risk ** a collapse of the euro,
