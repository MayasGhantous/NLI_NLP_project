  scenario ( 2 ) is better than scenario ( 1 ) because a probability is better than certainty . 
  eu has being preparing for ( 2 ) since 2010 :, 
  ecb in place acting like fed, 
  transfer of toxic bonds to ecb, 
  no threat of cds, 
  varoufakis cures cancer . 
  greek debt is written off as dead people rise from their graves to rebuild europe . 
  am i doing it right ? 
  i find your lack of faith disturbing, 
  epic song . 
  holy shit !, 
  pffff kids ... :-), 
  plot twist : this is actually a scifi movie . 
  the guy builds a time machine to go back in time and buy the first edition of iliad . 
  dis gon na be gud . 
  grabs popcorn, 
  -- knock knock !, 
  -- who is it ? 
  -- reality, 
  -- not now mom !, 
  clarification : sheep do n't get to vote, 
  depends . 
  eurobank , peiraios yes . 
  `` they have already posted them ** all ** for col ( * ) '', 
  ( * ) lateral, 
  reality disagrees . 
  machine plays with an aimbot though, 
  syntax error . 
  that 's my point .

  ecb has just switched off the first system providing money to your bank account ( literally ) . 
  ela is the backup system , with an expiration date of 2 weeks ( it has a limit , after which eu approval s needed ), 
  if syriza decides to clash with europe , i do n't think the conservatives are going to be the ones accusing syriza . 
  i would bet the voters will not be very happy with a haircut on their bank accounts together with a withdrawal limit . 
  cyprus spent 3 weeks like this , until they folded ... 
  67 % of the time , it works every time ... 
  cognitive dissonance, 
  \u0399 did post, 
  hence lizard people, 
  poios nomizeis oti einai ? 
  einai redditor for 1 year, 
  we do not tolerate logical arguments here , gtfo ( or tits ), 
  i disagree with ft. 
  syriza seems to play the `` rename game '' successfully . 
  there will be a new agreement with eu , without the troika as it is now , but with the same supervision as before . 
  syriza 's campaign schedule , was based on a 50 % write-off of the existing debt . 
  this is off the table , and the voters did n't even blink . 
  varoufakis has emphasized on future balanced budgets and 1.5 % surplus even if this means , delay of the promised social benefits . 
  again , voters did not attack the government . 
  we will have a new loan , with new terms , but this time without the social unrest . 
  i find it highly unlikely , that syriza sticks to pre-election promises , clashes with eu and destroys the country . 
  there is no magic involved when a government announces that all bonds will be paid in 50 % value . 
  when you make a campaign promise to cut off debt by 50 % , voters assume that you are going to do it , no matter what . 
  if eu was already happy with a 50 % cut , then it is a no-brainer that you are going with it , no need to make an election campaign promise about it . 
  this is the reason why eurogroup can not just say ` yes ' to syriza 's demands . 
  it is not only us with a debt problem , and even though eu has enough money to keep greece afloat , it does not stand a chance in hell to keep afloat ireland , spain , italy and portugal, 
  to vrhkes !, 
  poutanaki tou kerata :-) ( me smiley panta ), 
  good news everyone, 
  done, 
  simplified :, 
  the only way to forgive our debt , is if italy , spain , portugal and ireland agree to not make a request for their debt relief ( i ca n't see that happening ) . 
  there is 1 trillion of euro in circulation , and the debt of the above countries is 3 trillions . 
  eu can not print so much money overnight without crashing the euro . 
  eu has to guarantee debt payments , and because you can not guarantee money with sweet talking , they will have to create a fund or similar to finance this . 
  if it was as easy as you say , they would have done it day 1 of the problem , since they are already paying each greek bond themselves when it expires . 
  silly americans , `` creating '' 700bn for the 2008 collapse . 
  where were you my friend to advise the stupid ignoramuses ? 
  you ca n't possibly think of a better joke, 
  win-win ^ win-win, 
  you dont need money for shorting stocks . 
  think again, 
   what 's up your ass buddy ? 
  hmmmmmm, 
  i stopped reading after this, 
  troll level 100 . 
  achievement unlocked, 
   greeks , have through protests overthrown a dictator in the past . 
  ftfy : greeks , through losing cyprus had the dictator resign in the past, 
   why would the average greek citizen still want the eu after everything that has gone on ? 
  if we exit the euro , our banks fail , so you lose the money in your bank account . 
  the company you work for , also loses its bank money , and has difficulties paying your salary , and buying whatever is needed in order to create products to sell . 
  on top of that we lose eu fund money through espa . 
  this is free money given to greece to run infrastructure programs . 
  the cherry on the cake is this : we are forced to issue a new currency , which will be devalued to hell . 
  we currently import 4 times more than what we export . 
  expect a devaluation of 60-80 % ( there was a report from bank of greece about this with exact calculations if you are interested ), 
  all imported goods are now 3-4 times more expensive : oil , electronics , chemicals , machinery , etc. 
  good luck expanding local production , when everything you need is so expensive . 
  tl ; dr : good night and good luck, 
   a recent facebook poll showed +400 likes on `` leaving the eurozone '' +60 on `` continuing negotiations '' and +30 on `` staying in the euro with an extended program '', 
  scientific research at its best . 
  i am printing this page and sending it to varoufakis now . 
  info : we do not borrow espa money . 
  do you seriously think , that we have to return the espa funds to eu ? 
   / u/kafros is one of those nazis that posts here quite often, 
  lol, 
  you have serious reading comprehension problems ( 1 ) . 
  in my post i talk about what led to ioannidis ** losing ** his office , and you falsely accuse me of saying something about events that led to his ** rising ** to power . 
  ( 1 ) or you are retarded,
