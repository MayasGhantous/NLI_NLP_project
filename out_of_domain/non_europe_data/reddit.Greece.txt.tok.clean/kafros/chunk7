  this is what happens when religion gets the upper hand and rules society . 
  thinking is put on `` pause '' , progress is almost halted . 
  let 's hope this does not happen again . 
  the prankster god !, 
  ** me : ** wtf ? 
  impregnating a virgin to give birth to yourself ? 
  ** god : ** lol , that was the exact moment the shrooms kicked in, 
  do you need some worshiping now ? 
  ** god : ** of course not you idiot , i am all knowing . 
  i already know what your thoughts and prayers are/will be, 
  ** me : ** sorry :-) wan na play some chess ? 
  ** god : ** i am god not death, 
  ... etc etc, 
  i say we combine `` genes '' from all relegions :, 
  s = scientology , c = christianity , m = muslim, 
  in the beggining , an alien ( s ) flying horse ( m ) impregnated a virgin ( c ) ghost ( s ) ... 
  omg just a sentence in , and already my religion idea kicks ass !, 
  ** edit : ** my religion 's genome so far smcs, 
  ... i must resist ... fuck it !, 
  now we only need a campaign about `` not doing your homework is gay '', 
  i came home from work and my girlfriend had brought her hottest girl-friend for a three some . 
  ** doctor : ** as i recall you do n't have a girlfriend and your are unemployed, 
  ** me : ** i know doc , strange dream eh ? 
  ** doctor : ** ... what happened in the dream ? 
  ut2k4 bitches !!!!, 
  where can i get these maps ? 
  i have a good feeling while playing as louis . 
  keep positive thread . 
  have you never heard of a `` demo '' ? 
  it is god 's marketing division just saying hi :-), 
  what have unicorns ever done to you ? 
  man you deserve every negative point of your -4,107 comment karma :-), 
  because a flying horse makes more sense than a virgin birth . 
  you see once mohamed hit level 50 , he got a mount . 
  you assert that there is a `` higher '' reason ( s ) for which god does what he does , which can not be explained by logic . 
  there is a word which describes phenomena which can not be explained by logic or observation : magic, 
  most redditors ( me included ) find this a valid cause for a well deserved down arrow :-), 
  my phrasing was wrong . 
  indeed , unexplained and mysterious are synonymous to `` can not be explained '' . 
  these words do not provide new information about the nature of the explanation . 
  they just state a `` we do not know '' in a different way . 
  supernatural and paranormal provide a `` we do know '' . 
  it was god ( s ) / aliens/ghosts/wizards / unicorns / `` let you imagination go wild '' , who did it . 
  ... and some of us leave it there , waiting for science to gather more data and provide better models/explanations ( and peer reviewers to validate them ) . 
  you go the `` god works in mysterious ways '' ( see your top post ** -- you ca n't expect to understand why the omniscient creator of the universe does what he does -- ** ) , and as such you deserve your well earned downvotes . 
  are you the most downvoted person here ? 
  if yes , gongrats , keep it up ( erm i mean down ), 
  hahahaha man you are my favorite troll . 
  here have another one, 
  when you hit front page with a post about your leadership in negative karma , i hope you give some credit to me . 
  i hope all this downvoting does n't go for nothing . 
  here are mine :, 
  why would you need to pray to an all knowing being ? 
  he/she/it already knows :-), 
  can you have an all knowing being capable of choice ? 
  knowledge of the future implies that you can not do things that may change it , thus negating your knowledge of the future state . 
  upvote for `` toook ur jerbs !!! '', 
  common sense is so rare , it is a god damn superpower ( with appologies to motivational posters ) :-), 
  i you plot talking snakes against population density and correlate with the knowledge giving apples , you will get a pattern that proves creationists right . 
  depends on the state of your aging brain imo . 
  as we get older , nerve cells die , without being replaced . 
  do n't expect to have the crystal clear logical ability then , that you have now . 
  o'reilly has perfected his troll skills to the max . 
  he will jump between topics , answer a different question , make an illogical statement then ask something else so that it does not get answered , name calling ( fascist lol ) . 
  i do not think he is an idiot , but a con man . 
  he cons fox viewers pretending he really thinks this way ( their way ) . 
  fox troll is successful :-(, 
  i do n't know why you got downvoted . 
  it is rather remarkable that there is no contact with advanced tech aliens yet . 
  unless they really go out of their way avoiding us , or they selfdestruct somehow . 
  our sun/earth are relatively new to the galaxy . 
  there is plenty of time for advanced civ . 
  to exist . 
  true , i wonder why the downvotes . 
  physics provide models that fit the observations and can be used to make predictions . 
  neuton 's theory of gravitation `` assumed an invisible force '' between objects . 
  did it work as a model ? 
  yes . 
  was it accurate ? 
  mostly . 
  einstein 's theory assumes a curved 4 dimensional space time in the presence of mass . 
  does it work ? 
  yes . 
  is it accurate ? 
  yes ( to the best of our knowledge ), 
  voyager 1 reaches the first alien civ . 
  ** sexy alien computer voice : ** enemy unit detected, 
  ** aliens : ** rushers lol !, 
  ** sexy alien computer voice : ** super nova death ray under construction, 
  try unreal tournament 2004 ( onslaught with vehicles , nodes , etc ) . 
  i think many of you will like it, 
  i play as '' sd '' kafros , on euro servers . 
  what 's your nickname ? 
  his potential douchebagery ( or not , i do not know this man ) is besides the point of the article . 
  nuclear weapons have transformed the `` launch attack '' button to a `` suicide now '' button . 
  we have not evolved biologically to a lower state of conflict within 2 generations . 
  we are just `` behaving nice '' . 
  that 's the point of the article . 
  he got a single cell from each animal which he cloned in god 's secret lab when the flood ended . 
   the fossils are almost exclusively of extinct forms no longer on earth .
