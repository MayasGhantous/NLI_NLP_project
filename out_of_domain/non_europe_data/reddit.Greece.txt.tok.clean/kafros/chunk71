  hellenic republic, 
   in this context , the greek authorities are now applying for the extension of the master financial assistance facility agreement for a period of six months from its termination during which period we shall proceed jointly , and making best use of given flexibility in the current arrangement , toward its successful conclusion and ** review on the basis of the proposals of , on the one hand , the greek government and , on the other , the institutions **,

   the greek authorities honour greece 's financial obligations to all its creditors as well as state our intention to cooperate with our partners in order to avert technical impediments in the context of the master facility agreement which we recognise as binding vis-a-vis its financial and procedural content,

   that managed to sky rocket the debt from 110 % to 175 % ? 
  nope . 
  you are confusing debt with debt/gdp ratio, 
  greece can not build any economy because the state is hostile to any business activity . 
  this has nothing to do with debt or eu . 
  our laws and state structure , delay licensing for new business , are ambiguous on tax , give too much room for under the table transactions with state employees . 
  you also have a court system that takes 5-10 years to resolve a case . 
  we change tax laws and employee laws every month . 
  good luck building a business plan . 
  no-one in their right mind is prepared to do anything if this is not changed ( local or foreign ), 
  this is not how we do it greece . 
  we spend our time arguing about how to split the pie , and then argue some more because there is no pie . 
  we also hate people who want to make the pie . 
  this is / r/greece !, 
  kicks / u/brdrx into the pit of madness :-), 
  true . 
  why did you mix the 2 then ? 
   that managed to sky rocket ** the debt from 110 % to 175 % ** ? 
  i stand corrected then, 
  we are greek . 
  we can not agree to anything . 
  rule no1 of negotiations : you lose your cool , you lose the argument, 
   the greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely, 
   the greek authorities have also committed to ensure the appropriate primary fiscal surpluses or financing proceeds required to guarantee debt sustainability in line with the november 2012 eurogroup statement, 
   the request from the greek authorities for an extension of the master financial assistance facility agreement ( mffa ) , which is underpinned by a set of commitments, 
  think :-), 
  you are on to something here, 
  same deal as before , different faces . 
  syriza broke the election promises of cutting the debt , ending supervision by troika , and ending austerity but everyone seems happy here with this . 
  i expect social peace in greece for the near future . 
  debt relief is out of the picture , troika has been renamed but the supervision remains , and i believe that austerity is here to stay since we agreed to surplus budgets . 
  we will know more on monday . 
  mileage varies :, 
  my mother thinks that syriza is going to end austerity and wipe her bank loans . 
  my sister likes tsipras , even though she understands that he bullshits the citizens . 
  she dislikes all other politicians . 
  my father believes that tsipras lied to get elected , and is worried that during negotiation , ( even thought it is not intended by both sides ) a bank accident can happen . 
  most of my friends voted syriza . 
  they believe that it will change our position within the eu and that clashing with eu was long due . 
  after yesterdays news , they are silent on facebook , but this is maybe due to waiting for the final call on monday . 
  syriza got elected with a promise to slash the debt , end all laws that were previously voted according to the referendum and execute a social program with a price tag of 5-10 billion euro . 
  they have just agreed with eu to not take any action that will endanger surplus targets , and that all debt is going to be paid on time and in full . 
  if you think this is not folding , i will need a new definition for folding, 
  they promised to get rid of the memorandum on day 1 . 
  their actual pre-election wording was : we are going to shred the memorandum ( document ) in the greek parliament building . 
  on the contrary , i have made bank stock profit . 
  i need even more of that fine kolotoumpa . 
  if varoufakis hadnt signed this agreement on friday , i would have kissed my money goodbye . 
  the fact that you believe that what he did was a victory , gives me even more hope that the agreement will be voted into law without a problem . 
  we are so equal after friday , that the 11billion euro are held from us and are only to be used by banks if and only if the auditing mechanism validates that fiscal targets are met . 
  riiiiight ... 
  this is a possibility , but a very low one . 
  syriza has covered too much ground from its pre-election promises and closed the gap with reality . 
  from a position of `` slashing the debt '' they agreed to meet fiscal targets and pay everyone on time and in full . 
  i firmly believe that syriza will cover the rest of the ground on the next 2 weeks . 
  if they wanted to take us back to the drachma , there was no need for one month of theatrics . 
  they could have just done it on day 1 . 
  if we go back to the drachma it will be the result of an accident after stressing the bargain with eu too much, 
  correct .

  \u03a4\u03a7\u03a3 money practically inaccessible to the state, 
   in view of the assessment of the institutions the eurogroup agrees that the funds , so far available in the ** hfsf buffer ** , should be held by the ** efsf ** , free of third party rights for the duration of the mffa extension . 
  the funds continue to be available for the duration of the mffa extension and can only be used for bank recapitalisation and resolution costs . 
  they will only be released on request by the ecb/ssm,
