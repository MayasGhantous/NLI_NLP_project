  all our base belongs to them, 
  the rest is history ... 
  lol !, 
  most probably : `` nikiou 12 '', 
  you are correct , the article has found `` the real ** proof ** greece has a massive tax-evasion problem '' . 
  their metric on reported income vs spent income is correct for identifying tax fraud , but the reasons are different . 
  i hope our tax authorities use these kind of tools in order to identify people living beyond their reported income . 
  i am on the wrong career path ... 
  the lulz increase exponentially !, 
  politics runs in the family , best dna trait ever !, 
  tl ; dr : malakes everywhere, 
  flawless critique, 
  do n't like it ? 
  of course it is compatible . 
  people and governments still have all choices . 
  we can say fuck-off to the ecb money , vote whatever we like , and follow our dreams . 
  adhering to the mou is not compulsory . 
  we can end it all now and call lapavitsas to do his thing . 
  choice is still on the table . 
  i am not saying anything about cages or starvation , rich clubs . 
  carry on with your thoughts though , do n't let me take you off-track your fantasy post-reply, 
   you 're thinking is reckless and irresponsible, 
  ** you 're ** post made me laugh :-), 
  i stopped reading here . 
  welcome !, 
  sorry nope !, 
  +1 for username . 
  really now ? 
  ftfy, 
  se poio kosmo zeite re mages kai me rwtate tetoies papatzes ? 
  they made a very good start with themos anastasiadis , who was acquitted from the charges of tax fraud last week . 
  the guy was caught with 3mil euro on him . 
  why are we kidding ourselves ?

  i think drasi would do a better job , but people do n't want to give them a chance ( they have currently inserted themselves into nd ) . 
  if i had to choose between parliamentary parties , nd is the lesser evil ( but still an evil ), 
  copy/paste comment from capital.gr, 
  kafros ' favourite topic : \u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, 
  they counted on it . 
  he never disappoints me :-), 
  i think we should pay everything back as per current agreement . 
  that is , to have a surplus of 1.5 % per year , and use this to repay the debt for as long as it takes . 
  defaulting will collapse our banks , and cut us off from the eu subsidies ( this is free money for greece ) . 
  we are running a trade deficit of 1:4 ( we import 4 times what we export ) , so without the extra money from eu we will see shortages of goods in greece . 
  greece is depended on oil , electronics , machinery , cars , trucks , tractors , medicine , chemicals , etc , all imported . 
  i also expect tourism to suffer if we stop paying . 
  foreigners will learn the financial damage allocated to their country and avoid greece for some years . 
  the above opinion is shared by 5 % of greeks at best . 
  65 % of greeks currently approve of government 's battle tactic against eu . 
  they believe that we have a strong standing and that eu will fall back if we insist . 
  i assume that we are potentially fucked if syriza continues on the same path , but one thing is for sure :, 
  if you voted syriza you were punked :-), 
  and how are we going to exit recession when syriza stops all business activity ? 
  some examples , but not all :, 
  they revoked the mining license of the gold mine in chalkidiki, 
  they stopped the privatisation of the 14 airports ( which are a budget burden as they are running a deficit ), 
  they stopped the hotel business at asteras vouliagmenis, 
  they stopped the business with cosco for `` review '' ( lol ! ), 
  syriza 's `` steps '' so far to exit recession where :, 
  increase the salary of employees at the national electricity company, 
  prepare a law to make 40,000 temp employees into permanent state employees . 
  allow me to go cry ( from laughter ) now, 
  you , like the current greek government , do n't take into account ( even as a possibility ) the growth of the economy . 
  i am talking about making business a sane decision for an investor . 
  there is a metric ( global competitiveness index ) which in plain terms says : do n't invest in greece . 
  this has nothing to do with debt , deficit , surplus , etc , but it has everything to do with :, 
  stable and clear tax laws ( we change them every 5 minutes , and they contain conflicting rules . 
  you are always illegal , so the best strategy is to steal ), 
  a court system that takes 5-10 years to enforce a contract/payments, 
  a state hostile to any business activity . 
  the government in 45 days of ruling has stopped : mining , airport sale ( these are running at a deficit ) , port expansion of cosco , hotel business by arabs in attiki , just to name a few . 
  for the last 40 years , the business `` model '' in greece was to `` win '' state projects which were financed either by eu subsidies or through state loans ( bonds ) . 
  this is not real business , but this is unfortunately what the current government is trying to do : expand borrowing limits from local banks , to be used by the state to pay its employees and start giving out projects to local companies . 
  gold does not come to the surface magically . 
  you need billions to build the mine , pay the workers , buy the machinery and fuel to extract and process it . 
  all this is tax money for the state through vat and profit taxes . 
  did the greek state have the moneg to put upfront in order to gain in 5 years time ? 
  even if you sell an asset for 0 euro , you still make money from taxes ( direct and indirect ) . 
  this idea is alien to syriza . 
  they prefer to have assets bringing 0 euros while maintaininf the `` national treasure '' . 
  i know . 
  eu seems ok with it after talking with varoufakis . 
  problem is , with the pre-elextion rhetoric about not paying the enfia tax , we will not reach the 1.5 % target . 
  syriza is eating its own shit at the moment, 
  i am . 
  wiki says 1:2 for 2014 . 
  we have improved, 
  eu is already taking care of the debt . 
  for every 1euro of bonds expiring , they give us 1euro as a new loan . 
  if they decide to cut it by half , we will be given 0.5 euro for every 0.5 euro of the new haircuted bond . 
  this is their accounting problem . 
  our job is to change the law framework to make business doable in greece . 
  as for the voters , they swalowed the hook the line the fisherman and are now chewing on the boat . 
  so the workers work for free and all local vendors also give away services for free . 
  ok man whatever you say , we are after all living in a syriza dream away from reality . 
  i assume that a unicorn would give the money to the greek government in order to excavate without the need of a private company, 
  nope . 
  they are also paying the capital of expiring bonds .
