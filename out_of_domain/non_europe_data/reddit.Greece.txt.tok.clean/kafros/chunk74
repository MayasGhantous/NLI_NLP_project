  can you sustain the same power output with wind and solar ? 
  we can not store electrical power in any economical way , so wind and solar will be sitting in the background until we solve this problem first . 
  we will expand their usage , but we will still go coal/oil/nuclear . 
  tip : most of our energy usage is heating and transport . 
  both oil . 
  you need money in order to build the lines , buy the trains and control systems . 
  do we have money ? 
  is anyone willing to lend us money ? 
  how about espa ? 
  current status : 8 = = = = = = = = = = = = = =d, 
  the best bet for our state is to give it to a private company and keep a less than 50 % for itself ( something similar to ote : state has stocks , but not the majority ) . 
  varoufakis said something along these lines ( sell ose for 1 euro , if there was an agreed investment ) , but this has faded into the unknown . 
  do we know the contents of the list ?

  remove the keyboard gently , and go out side to get laid and chill out . 
  thank you for the laughs so far , though, 
  i do not think tsipras regards something differently or has misunderstood the eu position . 
  on the contrary , i believe he is smart enough to see that the eu positions on reforms and the troika audits , are a prerequisite to get money . 
  he is cornered by his pre-election promises and does what he knows best : confuse/through the ball out of bounds . 
  in these two months of syriza government , the country has been `` paused '' . 
  brace for referendum :-),

  what are the prices on a street-market in greece ? 
   the 2010 rescue enabled greece to avoid default at that point , which might well have sparked a global conflagration akin to the 2008 bankruptcy of lehman brothers, 
  no shit sherlock, 
   but the interests of the greek people were arguably sacrificed, 
  if greece defaulted , the interests of the greek people would be in an even worse position . 
  greece would be better of with a bigger write-off sooner ( and i would also be better off fucking scarlett johansson every night ) . 
  unicorns everywhere, 
  good night and good luck,

  dank it bro, 
  read the last sentence jim, 
  source ? 
   corporate troll, 
  last famous words \u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7, 
  it has happened before with cyprus . 
  if the greek government does not change course ( by doing financial reforms ) and the eu does not release funds ( even in the case that greece does zero reforms ) , then there is no choice but to seize funds from the banks . 
  up to now , the greek government believes that the eu will bend-over and give money without any reforms . 
  eu says ( and so far also executes ) that no funds will be given until greece reforms itself ( pensions , labour laws , etc. ), 
  ** edit ** to the downvoters : if eu and syriza stand ground , which is this magic source of money that makes my post invalid ? 
  p.s2 . 
  new flair for me :-),
