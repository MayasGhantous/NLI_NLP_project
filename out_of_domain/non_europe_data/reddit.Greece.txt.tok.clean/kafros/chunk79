  if varoufakis wants some love from eu , he has to show that he means business : pass laws that change the way greece operates , implement the laws , and 6 months later invite the troika to audit and show that he is serious . 
  slow clap !, 
  why cant we ? 
  is there a `` law machine '' that accepts coins and we have run out of them ? 
  people do not retire at 26 years old . 
  but there are people retiring at 45 after 25 years of work , and they may receive pension for 35 years . 
  but but ... tsipras said we are close, 
  why are your women so hot ? 
  please give detailed instructions on how to upgrade ours :-), 
  now , guess the shape of the graph when we go bankrupt, 
  glorious bankruptcy will lead us to the land of unlimited ~ ~ \u03b1\u03be\u03bf\u03b9\u03c9\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c0\u03c5\u03b1 ~ ~ dignity, 
  you do n't need more than one line to describe what will happen to our gdp if we go bankrupt . 
  to put it another way : what shape would you say the graph will have if we go bankrupt today ? 
  describe a default in which our gdp will not drop, 
  because we are on the brink of bankruptcy . 
  the money has run out and we are waiting the eu to cast the dice, 
   creditors willingly restructure your debts with better repayment schedule and less repayment value in real terms . 
  psi was exactly what you describe `` creditors willingly restructure your debts with better repayment schedule and less repayment value in real terms '' . 
  what happened to our gdp after that ? 
  i am saying that what you proposed does not stop the fall of gdp . 
  do n't forget what we are discussing : my initial comment that a bankruptcy will drop the gdp abysmally . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  i have to buy it for 35 $ ? 
  lol, 
  i will make it easier for you : quote a graph from the last 30 years that shows increase of gdp after the bankruptcy . 
  the most recent default similar to ours was argentina 's . 
  for 3 years the gdp dropped to 1/3 of its pre-default value . 
  this means hunger, 
  the period you describe ( 1941-1944 ) is the favorite of the far left while fighting the 1st part of the greek civil war . 
  i wonder how on earth you think that i am a member of the far left, 
  ukraine reinforces my view . 
  you got as an example a country , rich in natural resources ( oil and metals ) , and they also got a 2 year drop by 30 % . 
  i could choose an even `` better '' example : iceland . 
  this is a country on par with germany ( exports more than what it imports ) , and they also got a 50 % 2 year drop . 
  these 2 are best case scenarios from exceptional countries in terms of reserves and output . 
  is greece in the same boat on a bankruptcy scenario ? 
  we wish !, 
  i think that exiting the euro and defaulting on the debt will destroy our economy and bring even greater poverty to our nation . 
  we are a country without a strong industry , and in order to build one we will need to import everything : fuel , electronics , machinery , chemicals , etc. 
  agriculture needs imported machinery , fuel , vehicles , etc. 
  a devalued drachma ( the new currency ) will place imports out of reach , and the default will not allow us to borrow money , build infrastructure and pay back later . 
  ** we will not have the tools ( physical and financial ) to rebuild , when we need them most ** . 
  banks will go bust and current accounts of citizens will lose most of their value . 
  inflation will set in , with all the problems it carries . 
  ## ** disclaimer **, 
  the above view is not shared by the greek majority . 
  most people in greece and the majority of / r/greece , believe a default will solve our problems . 
  glorious bankruptcy :-), 
  always read the small print my friend :, 
   netherlands has a wealth tax ( box 3 ) on savings , property and investments . 
  effectively this is set at 1.2 % - with around the first $ 21,000 exempted . 
  this wealth tax means that ## ** there is no capital gains tax ** . 
  everything is about sex . 
  except sex . 
  sex is about power, 
  this is my comment yesterday about bankruptcy ( sitting at -5 ) :, 
  the comment/joke below fully describes / r/greece sentiment about a potential default :, 
   downvoted for implying bankruptcy is n't a blessing in the disguise of an even blessingier blessing, 
  wow said varoufakis ' useful idiot as he watched data he can not refute . 
  reality is a bitch my friend , and reality always wins at the end . 
  i hope we do n't go bankrupt in order to see how wrong you are about the gdp performance after a default . 
  the fine print my friend makes all the difference . 
  you can not compare a greek capital tax by itself , with another that comes along with a full tax pardon . 
  yes , the gdp data come from world bank . 
  take the dates of the defaults and see the gdp data of the next 2 years . 
  it is not rocket science . 
  you are a useful idiot , the choice of varoufakis was a play on your `` wow '' :-), 
  post a fucking graph mate with data 2 3 years after a default, 
  3 2 1 ... fight kai fatality sto telos . 
  but seriously now , i dont have a problem with him but i have with his bs . 
  he is trying to argue that defaulting is gon na be fine . 
  even fanatics like lapavitsas are modest about such a scenario, 
  i am asking you for actual data and you post a simulation . 
  are you serious ? 
  find me a default in the last halfcentury that has a gdp increase right after the default like in the model of your paper does, 
  why do you think that varoufakis is against a default if it is `` short lived '' ? 
  even the retard eam singer lapavitsas is cautious about how rough it will be when we default . 
  we also need to define `` short lived '' . 
  in ukraine it was 2 years and in argentina it was 3 years . 
  2-3 years are `` nothing '' in the span of human life , but during these 2 or 3 years you have hunger and extreme poverty . 
  ukraine was lucky with a 40 to 50 % drop , argentina droped from 300 to 100 . 
  which is the scenario for a defaulting greece ? 
  the one that we `` like '' or the one imposed by reality ? 
  probably unknown in length and damage . 
  if defaulting would cause 2 % of gdp damage and was short lived , samaras would have done it in a heart beat . 
  he , after all , wants to stay in power not piss off his voters . 
  which is the optimum build for farming phone numbers from hot females on the mykonos beach on august ? 
  greeks want to stay in the euro provided there is no memorandum attached . 
  a poll by newspaper `` the vhma '' asked the same question with 2 different phrasings and got 2 different results . 
  euro or drachma : 70 % euro, 
  euro with memorandum or drachma without : 70 drachma, 
  show power : xese sta podhlata tous . 
  keep eye contact while doing so, 
  ignorance is power, 
  -- france is bacon, 
  the clock is ticking ... tic ... toc, 
  a. einstein insert some concurrent genius, 
  happy with the above signed doc ? 
  you have to make a case man . 
  there is only one plan : stick to the plan ( mafafa opws to vaftisane oi tsipraioi stis 20/2/15 ),
