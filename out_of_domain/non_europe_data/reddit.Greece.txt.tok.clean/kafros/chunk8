  why were n't modern creatures fossilized by the flood ? 
  because they were on noah 's ark. 
  99 % of everything that ever lived did n't get the memo, 
  i try to avoid dying as much as possible for starters . 
  no true god ( with appologies to `` no true scotchman '' ), 
  you second point was valid up to 10 years ago , when we observed an accelerated universe expansion ( contrary to a decelerating one , as expected from gravity ) . 
  there is no way ( with out current view ) for our universe to collapse and `` bounce '' on a singularity . 
  our universe appears to be an `` open '' one ( does not collapse ), 
  ( read it in ali-g voice ), 
  do you also `` read that in your mind '' using dr. strangelove 's voice ? 
  god is dead, 
  nietzsche is dead, 
  god, 
  if it makes you do your homework faster , i think reddit has a duty to get you some, 
  not only you do n't worry . 
  at least 4 more :-), 
  500-1000 years . 
  about the time it will take us to reach the tech of ( almost ) immortality , have true artificial intelligence , and engineer new life forms . 
  it will be difficult to believe in a god who has the same powers as your scientists/engineers, 
  finally , someone who got the joke :-) have an up-arrow, 
  good reply . 
  without time you can not have `` events '' . 
  physical quantities remain the same . 
  an `` event '' is a change in the state of a system . 
  a `` measurement '' if you like . 
  time is the non reversible ( as far as we know ) series of events . 
  time-indifferent particles ? 
  source ? 
  no no no !, 
  it is a singleton :-), 
  static god m_god = null ;, 
  public static god getgod ( ) {, 
  if ( m_god = = null ) m_god = new god ( ) ;, 
  return m_god ;, 
  when no one believes in god , he gets garbage collected :-), 
  host advantage ftw !, 
  general relativity states that the sequence of events is not the same between observers in frames of reference moving relative to each other ( the train/lightning thought experiment etc ) . 
  i said nothing about `` now '' btw . 
  if you have a point to make , make it , do n't quote wiki ( or at least quote a section in the article relative to what you are saying ) . 
  be specific : what is time according to your understanding ? 
  i just downloaded a copy of the quran on my hard disk . 
  does this count as memorized ? 
  if yes , please find my hard disk in heaven . 
  pron is on c : \\ files \\ pron :-), 
  decrease in entropy does not reduce ( consume in your words ) knowledge . 
  a dna molecule forming just now in your body decreases the entropy of the small modules that got assembled to make it . 
  the earth-sun system entropy ( which contains said molecule ) increased . 
  why are you explaining to me the sequence of events after i have said the same thing ( is my non-native english so bad ) ? 
  btw : the sequence of events on the same inertial frame is the same for all observers `` on '' the frame . 
  you last paragraph is exactly my point on my first post : if you have no change it is impossible to have time . 
  if every measurement possible done throughout the universe gives the same result , then `` now '' , `` after '' , `` before '' have no meaning . 
  at least you did not quote wiki again :-), 
  let me get this straight : you state that it is possible to have change without a time dimension . 
  how ? 
  give an example . 
  does the sequence of events ( any events ) be different for observers on the same inertial frame ? 
  yes or no ? 
  if no give an example . 
  give and example for particles that do not travel at the speed of light . 
  you are just evading my question . 
  for any time duration t ( for particles that travel at speeds < c ) the relativity transformation gives t ' = 0 for photons . 
  i know that . 
  here have a scenario : an electron emits a photon . 
  describe the `` event/phenomenon/measurement '' without time . 
  i made a yes/no question for which i did not get an answer . 
  i did n't get the part `` and relies on empirical evidence for confirmation '' . 
  this is the science subreddit . 
  if you are seeking the truth without using observable reality , you may want to try the philosophy subreddit :-), 
  of course each distinct observer experiences his own `` time '' and his own `` length '' . 
  the beauty of relativity is that we can calculate the `` time '' and `` length '' of observers out of his inertial frame of reference . 
  i never said that there is a `` global '' clock ticking away . 
  time is a dimension ( quantized according to qm into plank time units ) . 
  no change can be made in less than plank time . 
  time has no meaning in a universe without change . 
  and change is impossible without a time dimension . 
  imagine you are a cartoonist , and you are given olny one sheet of paper in order to make a movie . 
  can you do it ? 
  you are given only one `` time slice '' to describe a possible state of your world . 
  without extra time slices , you will only have a static picture on the only piece of paper you were given . 
  any us price is converted to euro using a 1:1 conversion rate , did n't you know ? 
  ( no matter what the bank says ), 
  cars , computers , electronics , etc etc. 
  the why evades simple logic and math during the last 20 years :-), 
  i have a solution for you , but only works for spherical cows in space :-), 
  i loled :-) have an uparrow, 
  it is very easy to think that you know everything if you know nothing, 
  internet ( from arpanet ), 
  computers ( eniac -- manhatan project , colossus -- decryption of the enigma code ), 
  jet engines ( germans and allied ), 
  rocket engines ( germans -- v2 ), 
  atomic energy ( manhattan project ), 
  apart from ( 1 ) and possibly ( 2 ) all the others are basic knowledge . 
  btw i upvoted you . 
  is this only on king james version ? 
  i wonder what the writer of this passage wanted to convey to believers : in case of rape have a concubine at the ready ? 
  edit : sexy lady on the video :-), 
  ok the holy ghost took a shit . 
  what 's the big deal here ? 
  be the aliens that get to visit us . 
  their tech will be godlike ( read the last with an unreal tournament voice ),
