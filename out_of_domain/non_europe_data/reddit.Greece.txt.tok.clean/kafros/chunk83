  operation `` greek freedom '' initiated . 
  7th fleet underway, 
   fund officials said they would not be prepared to put a proposal for a third greek bailout to the washington-based organisation 's board ** unless it included both a commitment to economic reform ** and debt relief, 
  so true . 
  1800e/person will last until cash reserves deplete . 
  the biggest problem is that business is forzen . 
  companies can not import . 
  now you can not even prepay imports , because capital controls yo !, 
  these same controls that varoufakis said he would not impose . 
  and the possiblity that draghi would freeze ela would be the same as the sun not rising from the east . 
  we do n't have a choice really . 
  greece has insolvent banks , almost zero industrial production and in order to build one we need to import machinery , electronics and fuel . 
  61 % of greece thinks we can do without a new bailout plan ( which of course comes with harsh terms ) , and we will prevail through the sheer power of our democratic vote . 
  tl ; dr : we are fucked !, 
  guess who, 
  link it, 
  enjoy post :, 
   you alone , kafros the unreal tournament genius , are not corrupt . 
  but you are nothing but the second internet coming of george papandreou, 
  austerity level is about the same , but our banks closed down , capital controls were imposed and the economy has frozen . 
  i think the drama was not worth it . 
  capital controls alone , will shrink our gdp . 
  there are two scenarios for europe :, 
  they lend us more money in hopes of getting back the new loans and the old loans ( or part of it ) . 
  they call it a day . 
  no new loans are given , greece dafaults , eu is damaged by the amount of debt held by them and they get rid of the greek `` money sink '' . 
  if greece succeeds in reforming itself , the number ( 1 ) choice is the best . 
  if greece fails the number ( 2 ) choice is the best . 
  this is not about schauble . 
  he is not alone in the solution ( 1 ) . 
  from a point of view of risk managment , solution ( 1 ) is the best ( for europe ) . 
  if you were asked to advise the countries asking for grexit , on the possibility of a successful reform in greece , what chance would you give in your report ? 
  tl ; dr : eurogroup is lead by germany , germany dictates the rules , they did n't listen to my financial analysis , they did n't want to negotiate . 
  complete bullshit from the biggest political liar ever . 
  this is the guy that told tsipras to hang up the phone on draghi if he refused to extend ela . 
  this is the guy that said that the possibility of ecb pulling the plug on ela is as probable as the sun not rising from the east . 
  this is the guy that said that a referendum should not be done as it will be unfair to put the people against such hard dilemmas . 
  this is the guy that wrote extensively that eu will beg us to lend us if we threat with not paying the imf . 
  let 's suppose for a minute that he is not lying in this interview by trying to take the blame off his shoulders . 
  according to his own words , he had a great adversary against him with immense political and financial influence in the eu . 
  he is the finance minister , should n't he have a plan b ? 
  if we was so sure he was being pushed out , why did n't he prepare the day after ? 
  he talks about democracy . 
  it is the democratic mandate of the rest of the eu countries to not give loans to a failed state that placed his proposals out of reality . 
  tsipras was a fool ta have trusted him . 
  he made a huge bet an we ( all of us ) lost everything . 
  i mean plan b as in what happens if my bluff is called . 
  his bluff was called , and we have mou 3 , as tsipras has nothing else on his hands but failed banks . 
  edit : i read the transcript of the interview, 
  he has written articles on why an exit from the eurozone would be a disaster . 
  in his latest may 2015 interview he repeated this again . 
  i can understand your confusion . 
  you try to make sense out of a guy that says a and not-a within 24 hours . 
  less vat with cc ? 
  lol no within 24 hours !, 
  no capital controls !, 
  sign capital controls 2 hours later . 
  why are you such an apologist to the guy ? 
  he is a joke, 
  he played the whole nation on a bluff . 
  this bluff was seen from miles away and our economy failed big time . 
  they should have done what he was declaring was suicide ? 
  lol !, 
  you have gone full varoufakis my friend, 
  our nation is at stake . 
  what varoufakis claims he was proposing ( ious and drachmas ) would impoverish us completely . 
  a starving population is above your cloudy morality . 
  easy for you to say all this bullshit while living abroad my friend . 
  as the saying goes : there is no pain on strokes inflicted on someone else 's ass, 
   they have destroyed the eurozone as we know it and demolished the idea of a monetary union as a step towards a democratic political union, 
  on the contrary , it is the democratic vote of 18 countries vs 1 ( greece ) that gave this result . 
  would it be more democratic if tsipras could have his way with the vote mandate he took against the vote mandate of the other 18 prime ministers ? 
  the markets also spoke their mind on the day of the grexit : euro on the rising, 
  they have the right to use their money wisely . 
  we have exactly the same right . 
  if you do n't get what you want , it does not mean that you are bullied . 
  i ca n't believe we are talking about the basic facts of life . 
  ecb lend us 90 billion euro on ela !, 
  this is half our gdp !, 
  on top of that ecb has been accepting as collatelar greek bonds ( i.e. 
  junk ), 
  would you accept greek bonds in exchange for your cash ? 
  i know i would n't, 
  yeah man , what an evil plan of ecb ... 
  they stopped after lending us 50 % of our gdp in ela , and after accepting our junk bonds for the last 3-4 months . 
  they stopped on the night that our pm came out ** prompting ** citizens to vote no on a referendum that would default us thus defaulting on all the loans that ecb has given us . 
  say you owe me 1000euro by friday , and on monday you tell me that i am not going to get any . 
  then come tuesday you complain because i stopped giving you 50 euro per day until the day you default on me . 
  eu is democratic . 
  18 countries out of 19 countries decided that enough is enough, 
  you are confusing income tax with corporate tax . 
  syriza wanted to tax companies ( thus corporate tax ) with profits ( not income ) over 500k with an extra 12 % . 
  this would give an extra incentive to companies to rellocate their accounts to cyprus ( thus 0 tax for greece ), 
  of course all this is now without any meaning since the bank collapse . 
  companies are rellocating as we speak to cyprus . 
  gdp of 2015 will be a very interesting number ... 
  he is wrong , read my reply, 
  you can vote against the bailout deal ( because you have a choice in a deal ) , but you can not vote to end austerity . 
  austerity is a result not a choice ( the result of a poor state that can not service its obligations through tax collection and bond selling ) . 
  we can vote for a `` flat earth '' all we want .
