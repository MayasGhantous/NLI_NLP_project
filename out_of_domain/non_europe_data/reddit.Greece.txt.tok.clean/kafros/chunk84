  the earth will remain spherical . 
  this is / r/greece , home of syriza and varoufakis fan-boys . 
  ireland ca n't hear you over their 13 % , sweden laughs at 22 % , uk is smiling at 20 % together with finland . 
  denmark is placing a hand around your shoulder and tells you it is all going to be fine . 
  a serious note : as we speak there is an ongoing capital flight of companies relocating to cyprus . 
  this is a huge hit to our economy, 
  there are 2 democratic mandates at play : democracy in greece and democracy between eu countries . 
  greek people say eu does not respect democracy . 
  this is false , eu is democratic and 18 countries decided against the requests made by 1 country ( greece ) . 
  now within greece , the matter is cloudy . 
  people voted syriza to end austerity . 
  this is like voting for a flat earth , austerity will end when the country produces enough to fund the state via taxing and when the markets ' trust at lending us goes up ( at the moment they will lend us at a 30 % interest rate ) . 
   then the people voted , up or down , on the deal . 
  it was resoundingly no, 
  people said no the the deal by 62 % . 
  on the polls they say yes to euro by 70 % . 
  these 2 positions are contradicting , if tsipras says no to the deal , there is no money from ecb , banks remain closed and we are forced to print drachmas . 
  so which is the people 's mandate ? 
  what would you do ? 
  ( because you ca n't do both ), 
  this is income tax . 
  i have no problem with taxing individuals , i have a problem with companies closing shop in greece and greece loosing money . 
  your initial comment about the 500k bracket is about companies, 
   rise the income tax of the real wealthy ( 500k + ), 
  if you had ' t written the number i would not have commented . 
  the number is specifically for companies for profits over 500k, 
  tl ; dr : good night and good luck, 
   the imf has ** updated ** its debt sustainability analysis to reflect the damage wrecked on the greek economy ** since capital controls were imposed ** more than two weeks ago, 
  fail !, 
  this guy does not make any sense . 
  he is against the deal but he will support the government which supports the deal . 
  tl ; dr : retarded voters vote for retarded politicians, 
  what you ask is rocket science for greece . 
  the negotiations of the last 6 months were based on the assumption that eu will save greece no matter what . 
  after the pause in ela cash support , the closing of the banks , and the onset of capital controls , the government expected money markets to punish the euro . 
  this did not happen . 
  eu decided that letting greece go , was the lesser evil and markets viewed that positively . 
  demi,

  edit : better salary, 
  5/10 million greeks live in tsimentoupolh . 
   the imf is a preferred creditor , and does n't restructure its loans , nor does it accept write-offs,

  welcome to the real world , enjoy your stay,

  with this government nothings works sherlock, 
   the coming wave of automation , currently stalled because our social infrastructure can not bear the consequences , will hugely diminish the amount of work needed -- not just to subsist but to provide a decent life for all .

  slow clap mr. varoufakis, 
   in view of the assessment of the institutions the eurogroup agrees that the funds , so far available in the hfsf buffer , should be held by the efsf , free of third party rights for the duration of the mffa extension .

  this guy gets it, 
  greece , the country that issues bonds at a 30 % rate , the country with a government that promises left and right that it will slash debt payments , the country that has already fucked bond holders will ... ( drum roll ) ... issue new bonds which are linked with ... ( wait for it ) ... growth !, 
  this ladies and gents is quality humour . 
  no no no no . 
  natural defence mechanism \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, 
  good luck anyway . 
  any gains of germany ( according to what the article defines as gain : the lower sale of bonds ) is due to the european crisis in general . 
  when other countries ( not only greece ) bonds are doubtfull in value , it is a natural result that german bonds will sell at a lower price . 
   the best model for this would be a europe-wide unconditional basic income . 
  funded by all member states in proportion to their gdp, 
  what is the incentive to work if you have an unconditional basic income ? 
  why should european citizens pay for it ? 
  lets have unconditional world peace and free beer for everyone, 
  your choices :, 
  hmmmm let me think ... 
  this guy is correct . 
  the current estimate is for a contraction of 2.5 % at best .
