  ayyyy lmao, 
  this ladies and gentlemen is the keyword, 
  no shit sherlock :-), 
  1 . flat-tax ? 
  allow me to have my doubts . 
  ok got it . 
  on the contrary , tsipras and varoufakis did not quit at the first sign of trouble , hence the total failure of capital controls . 
  memory refreshing mode : ( all these happened mid term ), 
  did they quit when 20bn ( 40bn at the end ) euro drained from the banking sector ? 
  did they quit when the txs funds ( 11bn ) were removed from their hands ? 
  did they quit when greek bonds traded at 10 % mid april ( finally reaching 30 % ) ? 
  did they quit when the state owned bank stock worth 25bn , turned into 8bn ( and at the end 2-3bn ) ? 
  did they quit when state coffers remained completely empty ( including ota ) by start of may ? 
  let 's not kid ourselves . 
  these guys fought to the end , bargained our country on the roulette and lost . 
  dont let facts wake you up dear comrade . 
  sleep well, 
  all data are googlable in 2 minutes . 
  stock data is available at capital.gr , bond data at bloomberg , txs cutoff can be found on all publications of feb2015 . 
  this is not rocket science if you are not afraid of the facts, 
  edit : i have also re sourced everything on past posts . 
  bank cash flow on all financial web sites, 
  cash outflow : [ check numbers for april ( syriza mid term ) ], 
  state owned bank stock : ( click on 3yr link ), 
  1 dec 2014 : 1.252 e, 
  april 2015 : 0.33 e ( syriza mid term ), 
  c. greek bond yield , april 2015 ( syriza mid term ), 
  the data stands irrespective of the interpretation . 
  the data shows inflow of cash for 2014 , which is reversed from the date elections are announced ( dimas rejected as president ) . 
  i interpret the cash-outflow from nov-dec 2014 as a problem , while an anarchist may see it as a good thing because it `` hurts capitalism '' . 
  no matter the interpretation , the data is what it is : money flow is reversed when elections are on the table and afterwards . 
  of course , if you used your brain , you would not even need bloomberg data . 
  the increase of ela is a direct consequence of cash out-flow . 
  the 3year link will show you data from 2014-2015 which is in the period we discuss . 
  the huge bank drop has a very interesting point : from 2013 to 2014 , we have an increase of 70 % in state owned bank stock . 
  this is the first time in all of the crisis that things turn around . 
  from the moment that elections are on the horizon , there is only a spiral to the bottom . 
  bear in mind , that the state owned bank stock , was scheduled to relieve us from a debt burden of 25billion euro through its reselling ( ironically what syriza was promising , a debt relief , could have happened if they were not retarded by fucking up the banks ),
