  the bond yield ( 2y ) in samaras time was 4-5 % ( still higher than eu zone ) , but what i criticized about syriza 's mid term , was a bond yield in the 30 % range . 
  hope this post will not wake you up from your fantasy , dear comrade, 
  source ? 
  from your sources, 
   the chain of command of those involved in the rigging deception stretched all the way back from the us to vw 's home patch , ** it was claimed **, 
   german chancellor angela merkel was aware of carmaker volkswagen ( vw ) manipulating emission test results as early as july , an opposition party official ** has claimed **, 
   chancellor angela merkel 's government has ** faced charges ** of being `` in bed '' with the german car industry ... 
  etc , etc , etc, 
  this ladies and gents is what we call `` brain failure '', 
  from the evidence so far , it seems that the truth has been revealed :, 
  14 phones were used for cloning calls , and the sim card of one of them was used to call numbers on the us embassy ( stupid mistake obviously ) . 
  we can never know if cia asked for it , or if nsa did it ( or both ) , but it seems it was a us operation . 
  costas must have been the `` installer '' ( or he knew the `` installer '' ) . 
  you are missing the point .

   they do so only to cover for right-wing policies and a defence of the capitalist system . 
  pls expand on the end game .

  syriza is so capitalist man . 
  29 % corporate tax , 100 % prepay of future tax , 23 % vat accross the board , professional licensing even when you dont have a turnover , tax on unused property .

  3 minutes in the movie , as a small battle between orcs and humans comes to its end , a huge sound is heard over the horizon . 
  the swarm is attaching . 
  humans and orcs pause and watch in awe the huge numbers coming from every point around them . 
  as the swarm closes in and the end seems inevitable in the mouth of the swarm , a digital voice booms : `` nuclear launch detected '', 
  get rich quick with bonds ? 
  with an interest rate at 2 % ? 
  lol, 
  this guy gets it, 
  allow me to remind you what you wrote :, 
   the mistake is thinking that you can convince irrational get-rich-quick investors with logical actions , like austerity, 
  the investors we need to convince ( and we are currently trying to convince without any positive result ) , are not `` get-rich-quick investors '' . 
  they are very low yield ( 1-2 % ) investors with strict requirements for getting their money back . 
   of course not . 
  that 's why they want us to tear and firesale everything . 
  who is `` they '' , and what do `` they '' want to `` fire-sale '' ? 
  did i say about governments ? 
  nope . 
  a private investor who seeks a 1-2 % interest is not always a government . 
  riddle of the day : name one non-governmental investor seeking 1-2 % interest rate , and win a beta key to ut4,

  noone wants to do military service because he likes it . 
  we do it because we have to . 
  until world peace is a reality , you must be trained to defend your country . 
  you are basicaly asking us to do your job . 
  an average army is 1000 times better than no army . 
  our goal is to hold against turkey for a few weeks until the big guys intervene . 
  in order to do that you must be trained to survive the first strikes , and you learn that in the army . 
  i did my military service at evros and i have dug the man hole to protect me from bombardment ( unless it drops on my location ) , spend 10 days in the country side under a tent while going to shooting excercises . 
  this is nothing compared to the us army training , but for a land army invasion from turkey , it will do its job for a few weeks . 
  otherwise , it is just a walk to athens within 24 hours .
