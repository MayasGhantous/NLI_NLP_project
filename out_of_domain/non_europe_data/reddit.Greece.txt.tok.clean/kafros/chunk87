  dont be naive, 
   you need a professional army to hold the defense, 
  we have a professional army : the airforce and navy are 100 % professional . 
  fighter planes are flown by professional pilots , submarines , frigates , corvettes etc are manned by professional sailors . 
  main battle tanks and helicopters are also operated by professionals . 
  but you also need foot soldiers , logistics support , repair services to keep machinery operational for when the time comes etc. 
   yeah , for a few weeks normal citizens are drafted to get massacred against tanks , artillery , automatic weapons , air strikes , and special forces . 
  we have these as well you moron . 
  you are not going to be sent to be cannon fodder against a main battle tank . 
  if you are to face a tank , you will also be in a tank . 
   i am aware that i wo n't have the least bit of training , but creating my own hole and hope an artillery strike does n't hit me is as good as hiding underground, 
  you can be an artillery operator yourself . 
  it is not rocket science . 
  or you can be part of the crew of a main battle tank , or operate an anti-tank launcher , or lay down mines ( if you are an engineer ) . 
  do n't be such a whining baby and go do your service . 
  if you skip it , someone else is going to do your hours . 
  there is no free lunch, 
  laws are not optional . 
  what would happen if we decided to stop paying enfia ? 
  i disagree with enfia but i pay it . 
  i also disagree with the current government but i follow its laws . 
  this is what being a democracy is about, 
  guerilla warfare is not the same as terrorism, 
  food for thought :, 
  you mean that helicopter pilots and tank commanders are citizens doing their 9 month military service ? 
  so helicopter pilots are professionals . 
  good , now that we got this straight : officer cadets get additional training and do more military service . 
  in my days , it used to be 23 months ( 5 additional from what i did as a regular soldier ) . 
  the crew of the tank is normal conscripts .

   it is not that capitalism is flawed because it breeds inequality , it is flawed because it is extremely wasteful between human and material resources and their capacities . 
  well guess what mr. mparoufakis . 
  we have tried the other system ( central production control , state owned production ) , and it was even more wasteful and people starved as a bonus . 
  why do people listen to this buffoon ?

  dont mind me , just passing by, 
  what a shitty article . 
  pages long and just skims over the most important variable of the equation :, 
   on top of that , they assume the industry generates over 100,000 more jobs indirectly . 
  this `` assumtion '' is the fact that contributes most , to gdp . 
  management fees are usually on the same level as the expenses of the management company , on this fact reuters is correct , but the big money is repair services and spare parts . 
  greek management companies buy spare parts which are made by greek workshops and are copies of the original parts . 
  there are thousands of technicians ( mechanical/electical ) who are sent to foreign ports to make repairs than need expertise beyond the capabilities of the crew . 
  they also attend dry docks and supplement the yard services . 
  meh , reuters dissapoints with half thurths . 
  true . 
  the risk of facing yet another strike during dry dock , makes companies reluctant to choosing greek shipyards for repairs . 
  so vessels are repaired on foreign yards , and greek technicians are sent there to attend the repair . 
  so much money going to foreign yard fees ... 
  give this man reddit gold ( or a sandwich ), 
   the foreign investors valued the four banks at about $ 800 million , which is more than three times less than their current market value of $ 3 billion, 
  basically the value of $ 3 billion for all banks together was already junk . 
  if there was demand for a better price , then we should have seen an increase of bank stock during the last days . 
  syriza was cornered with its stupid postponements of bank recapitalization resulting from the bank run of 40 billion euro , up until capital controls were imposed . 
  recapitalization deadline came up , with bank stock at junk status and dropping . 
  the investors only had to wait some more time for the stock to reach about 1 billion , or set their own price and get done with it .

   the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of romania , poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia , and finland into german and soviet `` spheres of influence '' , anticipating potential `` territorial and political rearrangements '' of these countries,
