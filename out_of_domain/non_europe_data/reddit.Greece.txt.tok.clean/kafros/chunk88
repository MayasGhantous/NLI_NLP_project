  greece is acting stupid and this usually makes everyone to be against you . 
  what syriza asked eu and the whole world ( as members of the imf ) was to give us money for free . 
  they packaged it nicely with terms like `` perpetual bonds '' or `` debt payments depending on growth factors '' , but the problem is/was that governments would not be suckered again in giving money that we would never pay back . 
  syriza then had the wonderful idea of blackmailing everyone with a financial crunch as a domino effect of our banks failing . 
  you can guess that blackmail does not go down well with people . 
  especially in unions who have already taken a hit ( by the previous haircut ) supporting our mess . 
  short answer : \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5,

  edit : on your topic . 
  super mix !, 
  the crowds await your pics :-), 
  come to the dark side young apprentice, 
  i did request the verification photo via https://imgur.com on my pm but you declined :-), 
  to verify or not to verify , that is the question ( as shakespeare would phrase it ), 
  brace for impact, 
   german and french banks loaned greece billions at a low interest rate , without any due diligence on whether greece was capable of repaying the loans . 
  even if this was true ( which it is n't ) so what ? 
  do you think that this somehow removes the responsibility for paying back ? 
   corrupt politicians used this cheap credit line to enrich themselves and their friends , while also essentially buying votes by spending reckless amounts on projects and subsidies in their own voting districts, 
  again : so what ? 
  the lender ( through bond sales ) does not care ( and should n't ) what we do with our money . 
  when we sell bonds , the money coming-in has no threads attached about its usage ( while memorandum loans have . 
  because these are not from open sale of bonds ), 
   any bailout was essentially a bailout of german and french banks . 
  50 % true . 
  the bailout also covered greek banks , and of course the greece state from declaring bankruptcy . 
   greek banks in turn faced a liquidity crisis when hundreds of millions of euros began leaving the country, 
  50 % true . 
  greek banks became insolvent the moment the greek state was unable to borrow more money from the bond markets in order to repay existing bonds . 
  greek banks held 25 % of their capital reserves in greek bonds . 
  loosing 25 % overnight is game over . 
  the ( potential ) bank run , came after the news of the greek state insolvency . 
   greece was forced to cut domestic spending sharply . 
  no-one forced us to do anything . 
  they just refused to lend us the 30 billion we needed each year in order to have our ( pre-2009 ) level of living . 
  what happened in 2009-2010 was reality knocking on our door : no bond money meant a balanced budget . 
  a balanced budget meant cuts on all expenses . 
   the only way the greek government was able to increase tax collection was to further cut pensions and further raise payroll taxes, 
  how does cutting expenses help tax collection ? 
  they covernment introduced the enfia tax on property and increased all other existing taxes across the board . 
   instead of fostering a pro growth agenda at the same time as cost cutting , the ecb , imf , and european commission, 
  troika did advise us on a pro growth agenda , but we did n't want any of it : open-up closed professions , implement e-justice , finish up the land register , introduce software into the state to replace bureaucracy , abolish 3rd party taxes , and many more . 
  my friend you know nothing about greece . 
  what happened since 2009 was a battle to the death , between the greek state and troika in order to keep all the benefits some groups enjoyed , intact . 
  greece is a huge set of small interests that have protective laws allowing them to draw money from the citizens . 
  the greek state is only now ( after the huge slap of capital controls ) starting to drag its feet and confront all those groups under the pressure of troika . 
   i do n't know if you have all your facts straight, 
  he does n't . 
  read my reply to his post . 
  he oversimplifies a lot , says half truths and omits vital info . 
  his analysis on the bank run is a joke, 
  you are now a mod of / r/pyongyang, 
  what happened ? 
  moufa post eh ? 
  ftfy, 
  countries take part in international commerce agreements and as such are bound by them . 
  good luck to any country that ignores everyone else on the planet , on attracting new business .
