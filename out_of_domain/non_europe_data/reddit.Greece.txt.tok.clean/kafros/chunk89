  \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac hey , why not hit the wall with our head right ? 
  that 's the point . 
  \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 dream team , once in a life time . 
  public debt, 
  44.5 % of gdp ( 2014 ),

  he is going to spend a year dead for tax reasons,

  i would recommend to avoid such a talk . 
  these things develop ( or not ) , naturally as time goes by . 
  at the level of the enterprise , imagine a capital market , where you earn capital as you work , and where your capital follows you from one job to another , from one company to another , and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment . 
   just world fallacy, 
  off topic fallacy . 
  ' h \u03bc\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 , quote whatever comes to mind fallacy, 
  i agree with all the rest, 
  great success !!!! ), 
  slow clap, 
  good times, 
  wake up sheeple !!!, 
   to say that syriza has simply failed to deliver would be an injustice both to their initial efforts and to the plight of those suffering under renewed austerity, 
  i agree . 
  ** simply failed ** can not describe the level of fail of syriza . 
  we are talking about fail across the board : lower gdp , higher unemployment , +50 billion of ** brand new ** debt , recession ( instead of 2014 growth ) , higher taxes on everything , immigration overflow ( after the welcoming from syriza 's minister tasia christodoulopoulou ) , capital controls , bank failures , capital flight , business relocation to other countries . 
  epic fail , is more fitting , but still not enough, 
  mainly visa applications . 
  as we are now , a european can book a flight to greece as if he was flying back to his hometown, 
  protection between states ? 
  within states ? 
  does usa protect local book publishers from the `` plague '' of amazon 's digital books ? 
  does usa protect us manufacturers of e-book readers from off-shore manufacturers by enforcing stricter certification requirements ? 
  yes !, 
  does it work for them ? 
  yes . 
  their electronics industry is on par with the best of the world . 
  would this work for greece ? 
  i leave this question for you to decide .

  yes and no . 
  people under 35 have an unemployment rate of 50 %, 
   is the pay enough to live an ok life etc. ? 
  marginally, 
   hows your day to day life ? 
  this is greece , no is yes !, 
   does the federal government of germany genuinely place above other priorities getting its taxpayers ' money back from greece ? 
  was the finance ministry aide , who asked me that question , genuine in his concern ? 
  in other words , can german citizens trust their government to prioritise recouping the money that germany has lent the greek state ? 
  or does the german government have other , unstated , priorities ? 
   to decide what must be done to ensure that greece 's broken economy can generate the taxes from which the german taxpayers ' money will be returned . 
  decisions decisions ... 
  yes , always, 
  the girl has a vagina . 
  quite handy for making a heir to the throne :-),

  retirement kills .
