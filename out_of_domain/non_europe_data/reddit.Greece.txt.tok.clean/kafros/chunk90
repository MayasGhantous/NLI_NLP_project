   has tsipras managed to bring progress ? 
  on every metric he has failed . 
   what 's going on atm ?

   coherently with the decision that the new plan should be totally compliant with the ge06 agreement , the limit imposed by the three critical allotments forces us to plan only 4 national layers , and hence only 4 multiplexes with a national coverage, 
   the 4 national multiplexes ( layers ) of the new plan could be designed to carry up to 24.88 mbit/s in the current dvb-t standard ( as in the current plan ) . 
   a programme in high definition requires 8 mbit/s in the current mpeg-4 coding,

  ** all the remaining frequencies will be usable for regional multiplexes **, 
   using the current technology and a ** robust coding scheme ** can carry 20 mbit/s, 
  from the report : 24.88 mbit/s in the current dvb-t standard . 
  what is this `` robust coding scheme '' which is more `` robust '' than the agreed dvb-t standard ? 
  why is th eu using a non-robust standard anyway ? 
  guess why ?

  short answer : no, 
  long answer : it depends on semantics . 
  technically correct mr. tsipras . 
  the rest is history . 
  wake up and smell the coffee, 
  we are isolated . 
  eu does not want to deal with a country that can not follow any agreement . 
  a change in governemt in greece brought the eu back to the negotiation table last year . 
  instead of settling a gap of 2 billion euros , we engaged in endless discussions until time run out , cash dried out and capital controls were enforced . 
  we are the only country that didnt keep up with the agreement . 
  italy , spain , portugal and cyprus , all had a mou just like us . 
  we also got a haircut . 
  the gap was 2 billion because imf said so , in its june 2014 report . 
  imf is the sticktiest form of accounts keeping in the mou . 
  they want their money back . 
  samaras was dealing with this , by proposing measures for 1 billion . 
  this proposal , known as the hardouvelis email , was circulated to the press and that was the end of nd . 
  syriza came to power by promising no more measures . 
  how could he complete the evaluation while a gap of 2 billion remained ? 
  ( samaras said 1 billion ), 
  you see in the real world things are deemed `` completed '' when they are avtually done . 
  just the will to `` close '' the evaluation is not enough . 
  samaras had 1 year to make a deal with imf and also find the money ( be it 1 or 2 billion ), 
  syriza had the wonderfull idea of doing the deal with 0 billion and by asking for more money from its lenders . 
  result : 50 billion of damage + capital controls . 
  i guess tsipras should stop `` helping '' . 
  we got enough `` saving '' for a lifetime .
