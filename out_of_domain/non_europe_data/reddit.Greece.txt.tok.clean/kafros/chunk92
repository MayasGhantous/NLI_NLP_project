  le paywall, 
   no , the troika has prioritized protecting public-sector jobs and wages, 
  you mean that when the imf demanded firing 50,000 state employees ( nd fired about 6000 including ert after 5 years of mou agreements ) , the troika was protecting the public sector . 
  i like the new tsipras-speak, 
  edit : austerity was demanded by reality . 
  we were given loans to pay old loans . 
  no new money for our budget was given ( to be exact they did give us 9 billion euro for our budget , but that was a drop in the bucket for 5 years of mou loans ) . 
  the numbers : the 2009 budget , was 80 billion with bond loans of 30 billion ( 10 out of these 30 were for old bond payments ) . 
  this means 70 billion for the state to spend ( 80-10 ) . 
  after kastelorizo , this budget was adjusted to 50 billion . 
  it was `` for science '',

  helicopter money is printing money and giving it to the government . 
   it basically consists in handing out newly created money , debt-free , directly to governments instead of banks . 
  the central bank would in effect be financing the government 's expenditures, 
  you know which country does this as we speak ? 
  venezuela !, 
  can greece do such a thing ? 
  thank god no , eu rules are in place that prohibit such idiotic ideas . 
  where do you find these things bro ? 
  the central bank printing money in order to finance the government ? 
  pasok of the 80s called , it 's andreas on the phone and he wants to congratulate you . 
   the second tranche under the esm programme amounting to eur 10.3 bn will be disbursed to greece in several disbursements , starting with a first disbursement in june ( eur 7.5 bn ) to cover debt servicing needs and to allow a clearance of an initial part of arrears as a means to support the real economy . 
  the subsequent disbursements to be used for arrears clearance and further debt servicing needs will be made after the summer,

  i suspect they used cheap glue to hold it togethe '', 
  our minister of immigration tasia christodoulopoulou , explicitly stated , that any person crossing our borders and asking for asylum , will not be arrested and held at the borders . 
  about 70-80 ,000 immigrants later , the other countries closed their borders .
