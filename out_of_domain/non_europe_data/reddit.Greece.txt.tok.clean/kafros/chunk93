  the greek people voted for this person , she did what she promised ( open borders ) , and the rest is history : 50-60 ,000 immigrants trapped in a country that can not feed them . 
  the greek voters , shot themselves in the foot , and elected a party that gave false promises to these people who crossed the sea , just to get stuck in a situation worse than before .

   does the eu 's disregard of the wishes of the greek people , expressed in two general elections and reinforced by a referendum , reflect the eu 's defence of democracy and cooperative nature , or naked and brutal control ?

  you should never argue on false premises . 
  greece is a democracy , our governments were the choice of the greek people . 
  we were fully aware that the money distributed to us by our governments ( as government job placements , salary raises , early retirements , unneeded construction projects , etc ) , was money from loans . 
  the budget approval , is passed by law , it is discussed openly and published to the public . 
  in greece we sank the banks , not the other way around . 
  greek banks did not buy into the toxic market of us derivatives , or lend excessively to a housing bubble like spain or ireland . 
  the greek banks bought toxic greek bonds . 
  when our state failed to pay back its bonds , our banks became insolvable , and were recapitalised ( this kills the banks , and indebts the state ), 
  every budget ever voted was out of target because ( as you correctly point out ) , the government speculated about receiving `` imaginary '' taxes . 
  when the budget goes out of target , you can see it on the budget reports that are published by the government and the bankofgreece , which show predicted vs actual income/spending . 
  while the government goes out of target , it passes laws for new loans , these are also public . 
  all this info ( actual vs predicted budget reports , extra laws for extra lending ) was public , is public and will always be public . 
  we fucking knew my friend , we just chose to ignore it . 
  we thought it would not affect us during our lifespan . 
  we are all busy with our works . 
  i work 50 % of my time abroad and still had the time to see this little info . 
  if you ca n't spend 5 minutes per year to read the budget , do n't be surprised when you find yourself on a sinking ship . 
  and speaking about the media : during 2004-2009 there was a big continuous scandal of circumventing asep and hiring public employees via an `` interview '' . 
  did n't you wonder , where they found the money to pay those people ? 
  i did n't block the streets like a retard `` demanding '' an end to austerity , when the magic money ( bond loans ) stopped flowing . 
  fuck you , pay me now,
