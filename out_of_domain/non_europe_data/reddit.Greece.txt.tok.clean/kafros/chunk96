  how i tried to become soviet russia , but failed . 
  in pictures, 
  this is what i used to think as well , but after sinking some hours playing against dumb ai interdictions , you learn how to escape them 100 % of the time . 
  then the game becomes boring . 
  there is no threat to anything you do . 
  this is when i switched to open . 
  i am playing `` more '' parts of the game now in open , because i have to actively check other targets in the same system , see what type of ship they have , check the distance , etc, 
  the game is fun again, 
  4 . nope : http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/202308/bloomberg-giati-gelaei-o-varoyfakis-ehoyn-fygei-apo-tin-ellada-62-dis-eyro \u03c4\u03bf 2014 \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd . 
  5 . nope : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp check 2014 vs syriza 's era . 
  capital controls, 
  do n't downvote comments , just because you do n't like the user . 
  downvote if the post is off-topic or if the post contains inaccurate data . 
  i will add to the post above , that the socialist implementation of syriza is the high tax rates :, 
  29 % corporate tax ( up from 26 % ), 
  24 % vat ( up from 23 % and 13 % ), 
  fuel tax, 
  and the high salary deductibles ( one-man company professionals are basically fucked ) . 
  in essence , 60 % of the total income of citizens or business , goes to the state ( directly or indirectly ) . 
  syriza is : with 29 % corporate tax , 24 % vat , very high salary deductibles ( that have no connection to how much you make , not even related to whether you turn a profit or not ) , it is as socialist as you can get in a democracy . 
  about 60 % of earnings go to the state ( directly or indirectly ) . 
  if you add the local taxes ( municipality ) , gas taxes , 3rd party taxes , the effective tax rate is even higher . 
  communism has an effective tax rate close to 95 % , we are getting there slowly :-), 
  pasok had lower taxes because it borrowed money like there is no tomorrow . 
  its policies are also socialist : huge state sector , employ as many people as possible in state positions , etc, 
  -  trash ( end of flow ), 
   it is not immediately obvious why anyone is still interested in the views of failed greek finance minister yanis varoufakis ,, 
  because people are stupid ? 
  case in point :, 
   he offers two confused reasons for this . 
  first , since exit referenda are `` movements that have been devised and led primarily by the right , '', 
  sky is the limit . 
  please elaborate, 
  i am all for this !, 
  the possibilities are endless, 
  but i grew to become ~ ~ batman ~ ~ nyxterida,

  unch unch unch unch unch unch . 
  10/10 bro , i had forgotten about this gold moment, 
  problem ? 
  - the rumour was true, 
  watching them get stuck in the station 's mail slot by the ai pilot , and get shot to pieces by station guns , is a must-have feature, 
  credits for idea to user / u/jamfour, 
  and pay a police officer full wage just to guard him while he picks-up the trash ? 
  i think you are missing the point of incarceration : staring at the wall with nothing to do forever , is one of the biggest punishments . 
  the brain goes mush-mush . 
  this happens for my in quince system . 
  the stations that have the white interiors cause this ( i think ), 
  any solution ? 
  oh , and there is no chance that the guy will be just standing around instead of `` compulsory menial social service , cleaning streets and picking up garbage from the streets '' . 
  i suppose there is no chance that an accomplice will break him free , and use the 20-30 minutes of police response time , to get away .

  witness me !, 
  greece is 80 % pasok , thus alergic to mitsotakis :-), 
  unit lost, 
  on the defence of sothis runs , i would n't have bothered with some game systems , if there was no incentive to do such a long run :, 
  fuel scooping ( i did n't know this existed , and when i found out i was wandering `` what 's the point ? '', 
  fuel is dirt cheap . 
  found out the hard way that there can be huge gaps with no stations ), 
  change the plotted route , and learn star types ( again learned the hard way that not everything is scoop-able :-) ), 
  interdictions : check ship contacts , check vector and distance , evaluate gfto factor, 
  4 . super-cruise `` flight '' , going above the ecliptic , spiralling down to target , using planet as a `` break '' . 
  how we tried to turn greece into soviet russia , but failed ( \u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b7\u03c4\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9 ), 
  nope , and we did not . 
  the greek army fought italy successfully , and germany unsuccessfully ( and dissolved after the defeat ), 
  eam fought other greek resistance teams , in order to dominate ( and it succeeded ) over them , waiting for germany to lose the war . 
  quiz : name one battle of eam vs the german army ( hint : if you think of gorgopotamos , read again my first paragraph , and then read what happened between eam , \u0395\u0394\u0395\u03a3 and the british commandos that did the sabotage ), 
   was the main movement of the greek resistance during the axis occupation of greece during world war ii . 
  was the main movement against other greek movements . 
  ftfy, 
  eam had a force similar in size to the yugoslavian resistance , but the battles is fought are nothing compared to yugo 's . 
  this is not a surprise , as eam fought primarily for domination over the rest of the greek resistance forces . 
  2 examples : at the bridge of gorgopotamos , velouhiotis refused to join the operation , and he had to be convinced !!!, 
  ( lol ) . 
  when german forces were retreating , eam was asked to slow them down . 
  guess what eam did : they were killing their compatriots of edes ( lol ^ 2 ), 
  the facts side with my opinion . 
  the gorgopotamos operation ( with the initial refusal for help by velouhiotis ) , and the fact that eam fought greek forces during the german army 's retreat ( instead of actually fucking fight the nazis ) , are just small examples of what was happening at the time . 
  they were , but the fact is that we greeks fought more between us , than against the germans . 
  have a look at the data you presented and laugh ( or weep ), 
  \u0395\u0391\u039c had a force of 50,000 - 100,000 men, 
  the battles you list , are skirmishes of up to 500 men . 
  the battle of stymfalia ( which is considered a top battle ) , involved 500 men !, 
  ( we won this one ) . 
  the one at dervenohoria involved 400 men ( we lost that one ), 
  there is a quote from tito 's book , detailing talks with eam ( i think it was zahariadis ) .
