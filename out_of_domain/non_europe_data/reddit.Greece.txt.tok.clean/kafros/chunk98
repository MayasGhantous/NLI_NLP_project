  what happens if you fail to navigate correctly ? 
  drop to orbit with heat damage or do you lose your ship ? 
  i am quite impressed, 
  is incompatible with, 
  or they could have teleported the presses to the moon , or to the centre of the earth to be guarded by our lizard overlords for when the time comes . 
  is that your argument against his facts ? 
  that the greek authorities hid the presses ? 
  lol, 
  acting finance ministers report ? 
  this as well ? 
  the fact that he is a dick , does not mean that we need to counter everything he writes . 
  this is the logic that has destroyed debate in our society . 
  example : i dislike kassidiaris , kassidiaris claims that the earth is shperical , so i am forced to claim that the earth is flat . 
  so far we have 3 sources : varoufakis , gap , and a court record . 
  do you have something that shows the existence of drachma printing presses ? 
  of course we have a press , but this is not enough . 
  we need to create the matrix for the new notes ( research/test security tags in order to prevent counterfeit notes ) , and mass produce at multiples of the normal capacity ( because we are changing currency and not just re-printing notes that replace the damaged ones ) . 
  add to this , that all this operation had to be done in secret . 
  any leak of information about preparations for printing drachmas would result in a bank run within hours . 
  and this is why tsipras asked for help from abroad . 
  they could run the operation for him without any info about printing be known to greece ( unless you think that our printing agency has 100 % loyal employees to tsipras ) . 
  you are assuming that just because we have printing capabilities , we can somehow turn a key and flood the market with new drachmas . 
  the presses for printing drachmas , do n't play dumb . 
  as i already wrote ( if you read my posts ) is that you need to create the matrixes , test them ( in order to avoid easy counterfeiting ) and then go to full production . 
  good luck doing this in secret in order to avoid a bank run . 
  edit from my previous post , that you did not read :, 
   we need to create the matrix for the new notes ( research/test security tags in order to prevent counterfeit notes ) , and mass produce at multiples of the normal capacity ( because we are changing currency and not just re-printing notes that replace the damaged ones ) . 
  ok you want to play dumb , let me eli5 to you :, 
  we are discussing a comment about the inability of greece to print drachmas . 
  original comment : `` greece ca n't even print it 's own money '', 
  the original info by varoufakis : `` we smashed the printing presses -- we have no printing presses '' . 
  varoufakis knows that we print ** euros ** , as we all do , as lafazanis also did that 's why he wanted to raid the money-printing service . 
  so he is either stupid ** or ** he meant that we have smashed the parts related to printing drachmas ( what we technically call matrixes ) . 
  the point he was making , and which is the subject of the specific comment thread , is that greece had lost the ability to print drachmas . 
  in any case , thank you for pointing out that we actually do have presses . 
  when lafananis plan on rading the presses was revealed , we all went `` lol what an idiot , there are no presses '' / s, 
  allow me to quote my question :, 
   do you have something that shows the existence of drachma printing presses ?

  technically , the public prosecutor has a case against fillis for denying the genocide ( on the other hand he may be protected by immunity due to his minister status ), 
  i do n't think he should go to jail for having an opinion ( an incorrect one , but still an opinion ) , but the current law ( \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) is clear . 
  this really rustled his jimmies , but on the other hand , fillis ** is ** a genocide denier , he is not hiding it . 
  he specifically said so on prime-time tv interview . 
  i also agree that he is damaging the country through the decline of our education system . 
  he is removing any evaluation and examination systems from our schools : do you remember how diligent you were in your studies at the ages 6-16 ? 
  now imagine no exams , no marks , no problems .

  and here is the problem : define \u03b1\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, 
  so what ? 
  money makes the world go round, 
   afterward , the skeleton and head were preserved and stored in a wooden cabinet called the `` auto-icon '' , with the skeleton padded out with hay and dressed in bentham 's clothes . 
  originally kept by his disciple thomas southwood smith , [ 27 ] it was acquired by university college london in 1850 . 
  it is normally kept on public display at the end of the south cloisters in the main building of the college ; however , for the 100th and 150th anniversaries of the college , and in 2013 , [ 28 ] it was brought to the meeting of the college council , where it was listed as `` present but not voting '' . 
  le fail, 
  the generation of people 18-30 voted tsipras , and they will be the ones to pay for the mess he has created . 
  the biggest enemy of the new generation , is its detachment from reality . 
  tsipras is a side effect of the disease, 
  what ya think bro ? 
   how can the implementation of a recessional policy in such scale , lead to recovery ? 
  lem me help : reshape the justice system , so that we get a ruling in 2 years , instead of 10 . 
  change the way state licenses are given : the state should reply within a given time frame , and the prerequisites must be evaluated by a designated body specific to this task ( at the moment , every `` law '' is open to interpretation to the whims of the public employee tasked with a case at that moment ) . 
  stop changing the fucking tax law , no-one is going to make a business plan with so many unknown variables . 
  implement laws that protect against closure of roads , ports , airports , etc. 
  no-one can do business in a dead country, 
   independent from whom ? 
  independent from government manipulation, 
   who should have the power in this country : the people through democracy , or some elite groups ? 
  the people , through the government they elected , ** but ** this power is limited by the constitution and the independent authorities ( like \u0395\u03a3\u03a1 and \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3 . 
  what you ( and the vast majority of greeks ) fail to understand , is the nature of constitutional democracy . 
  in a pure democracy , the 51 % of the population can , for example , order the execution of the 49 % of the population . 
  the reason why this is not possible in our democracy , is the limitations imposed to the power of the government by the constitution . 
  syriza is building its whole political discourse on the above fallacy . 
  they complain that \u03a3\u03a4\u0395 ( via the constitution ) and \u0395\u03a3\u03a1 ( via its powers granted to it by the constitution ) , are limiting their powers to rule , while ignoring the reasons why the government should not have unlimited power ( it the case of tv channels , without the constitution , the government could shutdown all tv channels and allow only 1 state tv channel ), 
   should n't cooperation and be promoted over competitiveness ?
