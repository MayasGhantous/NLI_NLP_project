  is n't this the most modern approach ? 
  is lg cooperating with apple ? 
  is google cooperating with microsoft ? 
  is tesla cooperating with the rest of the automotive industry ? 
  nope , nope , nope . 
  progress is done via competition . 
  innovation was , is , and always will be pushed via competition . 
   the rest are minor faults that have / are being fixed , as far the budget cuts allow, 
  if you think licensing and stable taxation are minor , then you have no idea how business operate . 
  good luck making a business plan ( how much do we need to invest , when will we start operating , what are the short and mid term costs , etc ) , if licensing can take up to 2 years , and tax code is changed 2-3 times per year . 
   the independent authorities are to protect the constitutional personal freedoms , not to govern, 
  did i say they should govern ? 
  nope . 
  they are there to limit the power of the state . 
  current example : i , minister pappas want only 4 tv channels licensed by my auction . 
  \u0395\u03a3\u03a1 : yes/no ( depending on ruling ), 
   now even tax collecting is done by an independent authority, 
  as it should . 
  when our state controlled collecting , there was room to deffer collecting for `` friends '' of the state . 
  stay tuned for more, 
  greece never had a capitalist party . 
  yesterday i posted a recent talk of venizelos where he calls nd by its proper name : pasok no2, 
  nd is trying for the first time in greek politics ( with kyriakos mitsotakis ) , a turn towards capitalism and small government ( with baby steps of course , and everything is still ** theoretical ** as he is not in office yet ), 
  capitalism in greece , lol !, 
  the right to arm bears . 
  when did i say that syriza is not left ? 
  on the contrary , i insist that syriza is a left party , as demonstrated by the high tax rates , and push for government with out independent institutions ( like \u0395\u03a3\u03a1 , \u0391\u03a0\u0394\u03a0\u03a7 ), 
  i do n't get your point, 
  edit bonus story :, 
  surreal level : max, 
  usa , canada , uk , germany , scandinavian countries , australia , korea , japan , new zeland , france , denmark , etc , etc, 
  we are already in a revolution . 
  the revolution of the left , the revolution of stupidity and detachment from reality . 
  we are still in progress . 
  crash landing into reality is a good educator, 
  locate , evaluate , improve , rinse , repeat, 
  you get the picture, 
  where do i join ? 
  welcome to reality . 
  enjoy your stay, 
  between utopia and idiocracy ( syrizocracy ) , there is a vast valley in between,

   libertarianism ( latin : liber , `` free '' ) is a collection of political philosophies that uphold liberty . 
  libertarians seek to maximise autonomy and freedom of choice , emphasising political freedom , voluntary association , and the primacy of individual judgement . 
   past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism ( especially anarchist communism , anarchist collectivism , anarcho-syndicalism , [ 24 ] and mutualism [ 25 ] ) as well as autonomism , communalism , participism , guild socialism , [ 26 ] revolutionary syndicalism , and libertarian marxist [ 27 ] philosophies such as council communism [ 28 ] and luxemburgism ; [ 29 ] as well as some versions of `` utopian socialism '' [ 30 ] and individualist anarchism . 
   the value-form or form of value ( german : wertform ) is a concept in marxist theory . 
  [ 1 ] it refers to the social form ( a socially attributed status ) of a commodity, 
   nevertheless , the ` real value ' of such a commodity produced in advanced society is measured by the labor which that commodity will command in exchange, 
   adam smith theorized that the labor theory of value holds true only in the `` early and rude state of society '' but not in a modern economy where owners of capital are compensated by profit . 
  as a result , `` smith ends up making little use of a labor theory of value, 
  to be continued ... ( work \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 ),

  you ca n't make this shit up, 
   adam smith, 
   the labor theory of value is a major pillar of traditional marxian economics , which is evident in marx 's masterpiece , capital ( 1867 ) . 
  the theory 's basic claim is simple : the value of a commodity can be objectively measured by the average number of labor hours required to produce that commodity, 
   exchange value ( the subject of the ltv ), 
  ** exchange value : ** `` what every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it , and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else '', 
  ** ltv : ** `` the term value is understood in the ltv as denoting something created by labor , and its `` magnitude '' as something proportional to the quantity of labor performed '', 
  you got this backwards . 
   . . imagine a worker that produces 10 $ of worth ... 
  i will try to imagine . 
  i also imagine of dragons because there are n't any .

   `` socially necessary '' labor refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity `` in a given state of society , under certain social average conditions or production , with a given social average intensity , and average skill of the labor employed .
