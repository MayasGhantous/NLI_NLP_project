  yes i agree that 's ridiculous.but i have a question : are the `` greek minority '' in albania really ethnic greeks , or people who consider themselves greek?it seems that they are orthodox albanians and vlachs ( that 's actually what one guy commented right here on this thread , but i always believe the same anyway ) . 
  tried to troll , decisively failed ,0 / 10 . 
  i will keep saying that the educational system needs to change.it 's ridiculous that many greeks believe that the arvanites were ethnically greek.even during the revolution , the majority of them could n't speak greek.if people get their history right , things will get better . 
  whatever you said is right , but i will disagree on that `` self perception '' point you made.they should n't forget their heritage.yes they are greek since they live here for centuries , but their identity should n't change.that 's what i 'm against.it is better in my opinion that they do not forget their roots . 
  well mostly nationalists tend to claim that albanians are `` turkish surrogates '' . a normal greek dude does n't say things like that , so please do n't generalize us because of some disgusting nationalists . 
  i agree about part 2 hahaha you made a really good point . 
  i have nothing to add , well said.and yes , this topic is a peculiar thing indeed . 
  edited , thanks, 
  do you really believe that we have the lowest suicide rates?i remember around 2010-12 i was always hearing in the ( greek ) news about people in greece committing suicide.also , there were rumours that the families of those who committed suicide never admitted that their relative actually committed suicide so that they will be allowed to be buried like normal human beings by the * rather progressive * orthodox priests ( those who put an end to their own lives are not allowed to be buried according to the orthodox church ) . so there you have it . 
  i think we ca n't know what 's really happening , indeed.but what i told you is what i 've heard . 
  hey is that leandros ? no motherfucker it 's real redditor hours who up making them posts smash dat muhfucking like button cause he ai n't stopping \u2b06 \u2b06 \u2b06 \u2b06 \u2b06 \u2b06, 
  boy you forgot some lines but still, 
  * breaths in *, 
  boi.i never said he looks like pharell.read that title again.i said he does n't . heheheheh, 
  never gave a shit about titles to be honest \u2615, 
  repost?tf you talking about ? 
  stop generalizing ethnic groups for the actions of some specific people.i 've never met an african who does/sells drugs , i have yet to meet a romanian who steals churches , what are you talking about ? 
  i respect them and i hope that if they are relocated here they will integrate.i feel sorry for what they got through they deserve a better future . 
  they are definitely not a threat to traditions or culture , plus time passes and old traditions are forgotten anyway . 
  the majority of greeks do n't have problems with the refugees ( why would they ) , but there are always racist and close minded people . 
  there is the elliniko refugee camp , i ca n't remember other names but there are some more . 
  thanks so much for the info, 
  thanks for the info man i appreciate it, 
  give her a slight pat in the back of her head and her eyes might fall of.smh, 
  he is of romani descent as far as i know, 
  but he might have some armenian/anatolian descent , i ca n't remember right now, 
  they are not ethnic greek though.they are hellenized armenians/caucasians mostly . 
  hahahahah you are salty af.he was a war refugee that 's why he was brought up in luxembourg . 
  what 's wrong with what i said ? 
  im fucking rolling right now i fucking love this i fucking love thissssssssssss, 
  ok i 'm good now, 
  his naked legs scared you too huh ? 
  i 'm talking about the `` glou '' part of his surname.it 's an obvious turkish addition . 
  juuuust my thoughts before the tzavellas goal, 
  i did n't say they are turkish.they are greeks with caucasian/anatolian ancestry , simple . 
  i know , you were obviously better but still it 's your teams fault for not taking advantage of the chances you had . . that 's football , that 's life . 
  when i said caucasian i meant armenian/georgian/other people of caucasus . 
  there 's no such thing as `` turkish surnames '' . people who have turkish-like surnames are anatolians . 
  no more than 100 greeks went to bosnia to fight.later , it turned out that they were all neo-nazis . if you think that normal greeks `` hate '' bosnia or something you are wrong . 
  we are not `` brothers '' with serbia , that 's what nationalists think of serbia.not everyday greek people . 
  that was heard in greece too, 
  yes these were the first suspicions in greece.they we 're either gate 7 fanatics or they were serbian . 
  can you explain to me the meaning of your comment?do you mean that greeks ca n't tell the difference between bosniaks and turks?i do n't understand , sorry . 
  greece and bosnia-herzegovina are not rival countries.it 's just stupid people being stupid people . 
  well what about [ this ? ], 
  ( http://sportsport.ba/assets/pictures/article/468/zrtve_srebrenice_nikad_nece_biti_zaboravljene_223801_137468_big.jpg ) they are greeks too , fans of atromitos ( greek club in athens ) . you must realize that some stupid people ca n't define a whole nation . 
  the comment was sent to me though, 
  exactly . 
  the same way people confuse ( greek ) cypriots as being ethnic greek.they 're not.but they 're christian and speak greek that 's why people say that . 
  does n't matter what this dude said , just downvote him and move on.no reason to insult him . 
   the greek nationalists who allied with serbian nationalists, 
  ftfy, 
  you sound as racist as the dude who called you gypsy, 
  lol 3 dickheads make a whole country racist ? 
  racist pig.calling greece a gypsy country just because we have a lot of romanis here is like calling germany an islamic country because they have a lot of turkish and bosniak immigrants.you are uneducated as fuck . 
  are you telling me that this dude is a human being ? 
  not at all surprised that you 're a trump supporter, 
  i was never into american politics tbh, 
  [ just imagine tho ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sleep_paralysis ), 
  man idk , i heard it is a terrible experience.it 's nice that you got through it . 
  i know, 
  what 's the cause of it ? 
  definitely makes sense, 
  not greek , maybe aromanian or romani, 
  that 's because his ancestors were victims of greek nationalism.in short : `` hey albanian man , change your name and make it sound more greek , or else we 'll kick you out of our newborn country '' . 
  this dude you know probably grew up believing he has nothing to do with albanians , even though he might be of 100 % albanian descent . 
  just fuck my hopes ca . . at least medieval 3 would have been great . . i really hope they 're playing with us :(, 
  what century is the `` pike and shot '' era?is it like between 1500 and 1700 ? 
  oh i see , thanks, 
  this shit always kill me, 
  no , does it matter ? 
  i knew someone was going to throw that card, 
  watched every portuguese game , not disappointed at the end . 
  his naked feet give him strength, 
  i 'm pretty sure that ** you ** have never posted in this sub though, 
  unfortunately it is going to be an easy target for lions . . i remember watching a video where some vets heal a relatively big damage on a lioness by numbing her and completely `` fixing '' the damage while she 's asleep.it would be nice if something similar is done to that zebra . 
  the blonde ones though, 
  instagram back at it again, 
  what a header from iwobi, 
  bruh the lipsssssss, 
  always blaming the coach . . such a fucked up mentality really . . 
  we had worse phases.he needs more time , the players too.we were not ready for europe . 
   many will , for example , say that russians are orthodox bros. . 
  nope that 's wrong and definitely not `` many '' . 
  no one `` pretends '' that he is a westerner , people behave like the way society taught them , and greece has a lot of differences with let 's say romania ( balkans ) and lebanon ( east ) . we 're closer to countries like italy or spain . 
  nice people and hardworking.i know a half-romanian girl and she 's nice af, 
  tsakonian are greek, 
  aromanians are probably people who got latinized linguistically during the roman occupation of greece . the aromanian language belongs to the latin part of european languages, 
  there are slavic people in greece ( in the northern part ) , but the slavic language has not the extent the map gives it, 
  i used to support the theory that the aromanians came from modern day romania but i read some articles that said that they are latinized greeks because there are many greek words in the aromanian language , which makes sense.plus a huge migration like the supposedly aromanian from romania to greece probably never happened because it is n't recorded . 
  but yeah , we ca n't know for sure which theory is true . 
  yes along with slavo-macedonians . they 're not immigrants though , they 're ancestors had been in greece for years . 
  yo i saw this on insta i really had no idea that the number is visible i might delete it, 
  should i delete it?i saw it on insta tho man literally everybody texted this dude if that 's the case,

  i actually know 3 families who are by a greek dad and a swedish mom in chania, 
  what the hell is that, 
  swedish women are hot so that 's the case,
