  the anatolians before converting to islam were greek speaking as well . 
  do you have any source that supports your claims ? 
  leali is a pretty good goalkeeper for olympiaco 's standards . 
  calm down dude, 
  `` this bad '' ? 
  dude , did you watch his saves ? 
   greeks of the times were crushing the marble from hellenic ruins in order to make whitewash . 
  source ? 
   the greeks were destroying them to reuse the stone, 
  do you have a source for this ? 
   today 's greeks are more south slav and turkic, 
  you know that 's bullshit , do n't you ? 
  it 's not greece . 
  so most of turkey ca n't think, 
  it 's definitely not greece 's most famous song though, 
  the whole olympiacos team was hilarious , it 's not just leali, 
  paok fans do n't take these things serious, 
  it 's not , but ottoman music was kinda influenced by byzantine music though, 
  ` laika ' is eastern influenced music because it comes from anatolia . 
  kazantzidis , who you referred to as `` greatest greek singer '' is anatolian himself . 
  and seriously , he is not even close to be the `` greatest greek singer '', 
  the guy you replied to is a troll . 
  nonetheless , turks are at a large extent islamized and turkified anatolians ( you got that correct ) , not greeks . 
  this thread is fucking weird, 
  looks amazing, 
  `` a lot '' ? 
  you mean 2.000 ? 
  `` a greek immigrant '' ? 
  the dude is probably some 3rd-4th generation american , i do n't see what this post has to do with r/greece, 
  his wikipedia page says that he was born in the usa, 
  [ source ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alek_skarlatos ), 
   most are assimilated ~ ~ greek ~ ~ anatolians, 
  it 's not ` hate ' , calm down . 
  your comment does n't make sense . 
  both games ended with 1-1 , that 's what matters . 
  are you serious ? 
  the greeks of south albania are actually hellenized albanians, 
  do you even know greek ? 
  your comment has many errors, 
   i can name a lot of places in greece with albanian or slavic names , doesnt mean a thing . 
  there are definitely not ' a lot ' of places in greece with albanian or slavic names . 
  some places in attica have an albanian etymology because they were inhabited by albanians from the medieval . 
  there 's not much besides that . 
  do you have any proof for that ? 
  anyway , i 'm greek . 
   before the turks showed up in the 11th century , it had been home to greek, 
  ethnic greeks were present in the western coast of turkey and they many left during the ottoman invasions . 
  they were n't assimilated . 
  the other ` greeks ' that you 're talking about are hellenized/christian anatolians . 
  cypriots are mostly hellenized locals by the way, 
   russia and greece have longstanding cultural ties too . 
  i 'm greek , and your comment does n't make sense to me . 
  greece is not culturally similar to russia , not at all . 
   are all very nice and quite similar to us . 
  i agree that they 're friendly but we 're not similar , people who have visited turkey tell me it 's completely different . 
   so much so , that some greek speaking christians in one of the aegean islands still called themselves roman 450 years after the eastern roman empire fell . 
  do you got a source for that ? 
  the greek speaking christians who called themselves romans were actually in anatolia . 
   are n't greeks and turks basically the same ? 
  except for different religion and language ... same food , same dancing , same cultural attitudes , same mediterranean hotheadedness ? 
  and they look the same too . 
  not at all . 
  the food is completely different , turkish cuisine is very exotic , greek cuisine is it 's own thing . 
  some dishes and aspects of music were brought in greece by anatolian refugees from the population exchange but nothing more than that . 
  there are big genetic differences as well . 
  i 'm not saying that turks are central asian , even though they have some central asian genetics . 
  your source does n't say that they 're close to greeks . 
  turks are pretty much an anatolian people . 
  we love italy too !, 
  you should appreciate the help that greece had from the british and you should also appreciate the fact that they saved greece from communism . 
  i doubt he would be pro-usa had hillary won . 
  for some reason many serbs seemed to be happy that trump won because they thought that he will support serbia on the kosovo dispute . 
  remembers what ? 
  why would i not be serious ? 
   some of them are uneducated riffraff with a hardon for russia , orthodoxy etc. 
  ukraine is orthodox too . 
  it 's just that they have a hard-on for russia to be honest . 
  that seems to be a normal meeting . 
  where is it ? 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  why ? 
  i do n't see a difference between the way orthodoxy and catholicism act .

  this guy is trolling . 
   apart from the humor ... it 's a reality . 
  illegal gun ownership in crete is god damn high . 
  source ? 
  what do you think should happen in order for albania and greece to have normal relations ? 
  my opinion :, 
  solving chameria issue, 
  greece recognizing kosovo, 
  great albania maps should stop including greece :d, 
  is it true that people in south albania get some ` extra money ' in order to identify as greek ? 
  if that 's true , it 's very angering and should stop . 
  i 've heard it only from albanians on reddit though, 
  anyway , in real life i never understood why was there a conflict between our countries . 
  albanians get along with everyone in greece . 
   remove the war law and let chameria go from both sides . 
  can you elaborate on this ? 
   there is a war law between our countries if you do n't know which is non sense imo but our politicians are still keeping it .
