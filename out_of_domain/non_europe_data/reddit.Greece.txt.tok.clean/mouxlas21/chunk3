  none ... spartans keep the old habit of not wanting to do anything with the rest of greece ... no one from sparta is famous for anything ( sports/arts/politics / etc ) unless he or she is about 2500 years old . 
  [ also ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sparti_%28municipality%29#politics ), 
  at the beach, 
  since we brought this up . 
  sifakis is from [ crete ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete ), 
  i was high as fuck ... 
  sounds familiar to me , 
  wake up boys ... 
  what was salpigidis thinking to go for a header against hummels ? 
  wft greece ? 
  i did n't expect them to be that passive, 
  holy fuck khedira ... well i guess this is it, 
  amstel ... 
  gooooooooaaaal :p, 
  is it 1966 again ? 
  well enjoy your film then, 
  germany showed who was the boss from the 1st min . 
  ... i expected from our team a bit more fighting spirit ... but ... well , those fuckers were all over us ... guess the 1-1 got them angry ... best wishes to germany and i hope they win the em, 
  any explanation as to why the english ca n't deal with penalties ? 
  well we [ men ] usually wake up horny , so ... 
  he was old school ** imperialism ** ftfy, 
  and this is why they did n't usually surrender, 
  finally ... we 'll see him cry today ... 
  what a great team ... ravelli , patrik andersson , brolin , dahlin and a young an upcoming henrik larsson ... poor bulgarians , 4-0 before halftime, 
  i 'm all with you on this . 
  looks like some people never played football or have forgotten about how it feels to be on the field . 
  i guess the definition of `` aggressive '' varies by country ... 
  good to know you play too italy, 
  well they like to plan longterm ... 
  no way buffon will be beaten twice today ... that game is over . 
  shhhhhhhhh ... do n't remind them, 
   of course , the other side was built up anyway . 
  hahahahah ... live your myth in greece, 
  i guess they thought later that lung cancer would take too long ... 
  just leave :p, 
  seriously ... see the old city and be gone . 
  nothing to do there . 
  people who live in kavala go to the nearby city of drama ( where i 'm originaly from ) for the night life . 
  not my kind of thing but give it a try . 
  also the city of drama is beautiful too . 
  other then that , thessaloniki is not far away and ksanthi is even closer . 
  the ancient town of [ philippi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippi ) where the famous [ battle of phillipi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_philippi ) was fought is close if you want to do some sightseeing . 
  the hell ??? 
  you 'll be in greece and you plan to go to a pool ??

  well done ... looks like i missed you for a couple of days ... i 'm not much of a swimmer myself , but lying in the sand under the sun and listening to the crickets and the waves ... . . just priceless , 
  enjoy your stay in greece ... ... and most importantly ... . . spend money :p, 
  thanks :d, 
  the tumbler ? 
  ... oh , you would n't be interested in that . 
  just because of the sweat patches ... keep the man locked behind bars and throw the key away ... 
  `` you 'd never give it to an ordinary citizen '', 
  you are a lucky man sir, 
  90 seconds was enough for me ... thanks op ... i hate robin now, 
   the wrong gender ? 
  the right one being a hermaphrodite ? 
  guess alfred had a day off ... 
  +1 really well done . 
  post a pic with the goggles on . 
  and is the cat really that big ? 
  joker : `` i just do things '' - epic line, 
  i have to say that i got this feeling that this time the joker dies ... 
  where 's the bowl ? 
  loved the episode ... one question ... is this jason as robin ? 
  `` experience in that area '' ... hmmmm, 
  i would love to see a crossover where the doc makes all the gadgets for batman ... 
  tell him about the chocolate i stole when i was six ? 
  should hawkgirl make her appearance in this movie then he sequel should be the episode `` starcrossed '' from justice league . 
  great story and moments , but most of [ all ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=44xgejy0ah0#t=96s ), 
  [ not really ] ( http://imgur.com/r/batman/ql1v2 ), 
  i say it 's harley quinn ... in the sense that the joker got rid of from his distractions and batman should do the same with the bat-family , so that it would be again just the two of them . 
  `` you should have seen him '' ( batman # 423 ) ... it 's one of the first batman stories i remember reading . 
  i think i still have it somewhere . 
  it is 3 different batman stories told by 3 different cops and each of them describes a different batman the way they saw him in action . 
  i found a [ review ] ( http://ninjadogcorps.wordpress.com/2009/11/21/my-batman-you-should-have-seen-him/ ) on the internet should anyone would want more details about it . 
  i don ; t know why you are still getting downvoted . 
  you make some good points and i agree with most of them . 
  i would n't go as far as to call it the worst thing that ever happened to batman , but yeah it does seem kinda rushed ( and that bugs me , because i believe the whole concept had allot more potential ), 
  frank miller all the way ... that 's why i loved the `` year one '' animation, 
  you think this is a good idea ? 
  you think i should too ? 
  well if you say so ... 
  i knew i was n't the only one in this subreddit, 
  `` riddle me th ... '' get 's hit by a train in the middle of nowhere ... 
   small children dressed in bright colours, 
  ftfy, 
  this . 
  i always try to watch public enemies right after the dark knight returns just to feel better . 
  oh and also `` grundy is going to feel allot worse '' ... kills me every time , 
  make it 20 ... i always tell this to one of our guys in our `` team '' ... either do n't drink at all or get really fucked up and be a spectacle ( people will notice you for sure ) , but there is no point in drinking just enough to forget your lines . 
  no tentacles ?? 
  prepare to be downvoted to oblivion after that statement ... 
  i would never think that batman would be a fellow pothead ... 
   other skills : speaks japanese, 
  really ? 
  no thomas or martha ? 
  batman must feel very lonely in the dc universe sometimes, 
  atheist in the sence that he does n't worship anyone , follows their rules , goes to church etc etc, 
  i am greek and sometimes have the same problem as you . 
   the problem might be that i 've watched/listened to stuff in english all my life .
