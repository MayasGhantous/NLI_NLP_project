  i do n't like finnish stand up . 
  try to think in english and write in finnish . 
  the process of not translating directly ( i.e word for word translation ) might also help creatively, 
  who was it ? 
  wow !, 
  my eyes hurt ... 
  klinsmann knows better then anyone how easy that was . 
  i bet he wishes he was there to finish it, 
  2 subs already pfff ... i know we are boring as fuck , but c'mon greece , make it happen , do the miracle !!, 
  someone 's been reading about the trojan war :p, 
  dear ivory coast players , seeing as this is the 90th minute and the game is practicaly over , we came to your penalty area to congratulate you for the qualification to the round of 16 . 
  we also brought you a present . 
  here take this wooden horse ... 
  i think suarez is trying to start a zombie apocalypse . 
   many people sat and wondered if murica would collapse to smaller states after 2001 and 2008 but it did n't . 
  so much for being a paper tiger . 
  not even russia , a nation known for how tough it is , could withstand its implosion in the early 90s . 
  care to explain that ? 
  it 's from the same series . 
  your picture is from the battle she ( wonder woman ) had against storm from the x-men ( ww refused to use mjolnir and it 's power and lost the fight ) . 
  the picture the op posted is from later on , where heroes from both worlds try to contain and battle thanos and darkseid who go at it . 
  fun reads , but too ... 90 's i guess . 
  it 's already ongoing, 
  source ? 
  oh man i was talking about `` barry is the kind of man that i would 've hoped to become if my parents had n't been murdered . '', 
  ... shit . 
  must have mixed the posts, 
  wow !!!, 
  well done good sir . 
  this should be in the sidebar . 
  i feel for you op . 
  lost mine 12 years ago when i was 23 ( suicide ) and even though i was not a child it did hit me really hard . 
  this episode got me . 
  i too would go back in time if i could , if only to let her know that i am ok and say goodbye . 
  stay strong people . 
  ps : with all the orphans in this post , there is allot of superheroe potential :p, 
  obviously not the bat-plane . 
  wow !, 
  source ? 
  greece, 
  thessaloniki, 
  i watched this episode the only way possible . 
  high on weed . 
  i think sissoko just summed up the season for newcastle, 
  so if everton wins the league again we should expect world war 3 ? 
  anyone else getting a star trek ds9 vibe ? 
  just no :(, 
  how about neither . 
  i do n't think i can take it anymore . 
  the ending better be very very fucking happy george rr martin , that 's all i 'm saying , you owe us that much . 
  [ you got a war face ? 
  that 's a war face !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0t4yw-tabe ), 
  so what are the odds of him crying ? 
  has jon a stronger claim to the iron throne then daenerys because he is the son of rhaegar ? 
  we greeks would like to have a word with you , 
  there was at least one german to lift the trophy in that tournament  those were some crazy days i tell you, 
  please oh please wales turn it arround, 
  i think portugal will win if they play against france, 
  ... well that was unexpected, 
  why not conquer the persians ? 
  they might get a few nice carpets, 
  portugal seems to know how to play against the host nation in a final . 
  i wonder where they got that lesson from hehehe, 
  that ionikos game thought :( but yeah he did got our national team for 2 consecutive tournaments through the group stage ( \u03b1 \u03c1\u03b5 \u0393\u03ba\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1 ), 
  seeing him in this tournament made me even more angry , as in `` you could have been that great defender the whole time . 
  why choose being a dick ? '', 
  well paok is from greece . 
  also their manager ( v. ivic ) played under santos for some years at aek and paok . 
  that 's a dick move, 
  she is just gon na stab herself at some point, 
  he just went back in time to undo it, 
  can you explain the ` cousin ' joke ? 
  i think i am missing something . 
  if you can dodge a wrench , you can dodge savitar, 
  we got a link for that ? 
  the being old part might actually be good for a national team . 
  national team tournaments like the euro or the world cup are special occasions . 
  it seems to me that the players of those teams are in the need of some sort of father figure to turn to . 
  maybe it is like that because the players do n't train together on a day-to-day basis over a long period of time like they do for their clubs . 
  having that theory in mind , i did some research and found the ages of coaches who won an international tournament since 2000 . 
  here is the list ( ages are those at the time of win ), 
  2000 : ( euro ) france - roger lemerre - 59, 
  2004 : ( euro ) greece - otto rehhagel - 66, 
  2006 : ( wc ) italy - marcello lippi - 58, 
  2008 : ( euro ) spain - luis aragon\u00e9s - 70, 
  2010 : ( wc ) spain - vicente del bosque - 60, 
  2012 : ( euro ) spain - vicente del bosque - 62, 
  2014 : ( wc ) germany - joachim l\u00f6w - 54, 
  with luiz felipe scolari and joachim l\u00f6w being the exceptions , everybody else on the list is either close to their sixties or in their sixties , with luis aragon\u00e9s being the only over sixty . 
  i do not believe that age alone had to do anything with winning the tournaments , but i do believe that ars\u00e8ne wenger sitting at 67 years old should not be considered too old . 
  just a few thoughts, 
  greatest comeback you ever saw ? 
  the obvious choices would be the 1999 cl final manchester united vs bayern munich 2-1 and the 2005 cl final ac milan 3 - 3 liverpool . 
  also this [ paok-sparta trnava 5-3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4cu6byehig ) ( paok where losing 0-3 after 27 minutes ), 
  wow !, 
  just wow . 
  epic !,
