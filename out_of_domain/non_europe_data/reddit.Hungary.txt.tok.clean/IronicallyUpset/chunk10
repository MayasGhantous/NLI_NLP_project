  funny comment , but i mean that neither men nor women should be groped or stroked on cable . 
  it 's not about sexual freedoms , it 's about objectification . 
  you clearly missed that completely . 
  guess he was, 
  ( puts on sunglasses ), 
  * in deep shit *, 
  first two are false . 
  you can appreciate someone being attractive without treating them like a sex object . 
  put it in your mouth , chew , swallow, 
  no one will ever know that it 's haram if they ca n't see it in your stomach, 
  does it grow back overnight , bigger and better ? 
  the fact that we already know that it 's expanding , therefore there was a time when the universe was n't as big as it is now . 
  infinity can not increase , finite numbers can . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
  my brain fucked up , i read that she would have to show enough skin or he 'd break her jaw . 
  that only means you went to overtime !, 
  did you win the game ? 
  what do you mean that finite numbers can only expand to a certain point ? 
  were i immortal , could i not count for 1,000 years and still be left with a finite number ? 
  dude . 
  those are fucking * children * . 
  i do n't give a flying fuck whether you care about them or not , it is your duty as a person with this information to try to make sure their lives get better . 
  lack of knowledge is not proof of lack of intelligence . 
  you 're given five seconds of airtime and all you do is freak out your friends ? 
  * dude . 
  you 're right . 
  i just realized how wrong i was . 
  gave me a chuckle , have an upvote . 
  this , along with religious people . 
  not no man 's sky . 
  star wars viii, 
  ** no , but are we going to wait around until he does ? 
  edit : emboldened sentence . 
  obligatory rape joke . 
  mcdonald 's : the amount of regulars we have is steadily decreasing , but not because our food is bad . 
  must 've been a bitch to test . 
  `` they 're all over reddit '', 
  something something broken arms . 
  perhaps they somehow remove that tattoo and replace it with a cooler one . 
  this is a quality post, 
  s ( mall ) b ( lack ) c ( ock ), 
  thought this was really cool and interesting , but then i realized it was a writing prompt . 
  ** these ten commandments from god will shock you **, 
  philosophy . 
  `` how to tie noose '', 
  ignorance is bliss . 
  bad experience when i was 4 . 
  you made your * uncle * listen to that shit ? 
  terrible example , that sounds like a great movie !, 
   i just ... walked away . 
  that 's the only thing you can really do . 
  i mean , ** wow ** . 
  this comment takes the cake . 
  that was * the most * pretentious comment commented here . 
  it 's a crack den . 
  the only reason this subreddit was created was for people like you to receive gold . 
  i wish i had the funds available , but know that i * would * give you a meaningless gesture of value if i could . 
  `` an art '', 
  this is a fucking retarded meme but at least it 's not forced . 
  holy fucking shit . 
  do you realize what you 've done ? 
  you 've created a ** dynasty ** !, 
  a ** legend ** !, 
  you were in charge of a simple underdog food stand and then your profits were * stolen * !, 
  as revenge , you masterminded a plan to destroy the success of the student council ** and you fucking succeeded ** !, 
  even after you left your highschool , the people to next lead the anime club kept the wheel rolling , even expanding the anime club 's success !, 
  ** can you even understand the ramifications of your little revenge plot ??? 
  just imagine the faces of the newest freshmen as they hear your legend !!!, 
  you are the anime !!!, 
  sorry , i get hyped up over stories easily . 
  and yours was kickass . 
  this is the greatest revenge story i 've ever heard . 
  please continue it . 
  you wo n't regret it and the type of club it was does n't really matter . 
  this meme is trash but the relief of knowing meme of the month : september is worth it, 
   this was the last text they sent before crashing . 
  rare alternate future where snowden was caught, 
  if everything is tiny , is nothing tiny ? 
  student debt . 
  how could anyone do something like this ? 
  cool joke , i was talking about the filicide tho, 
  r/pcmasterrace is crying . 
  you can tell that the pause between putting up the number and looking at the camera is very brief for 's ' and ` l' , but more importantly they are the same length . 
  notice how the pause extends at `` slu '' . 
  she has realized the word it might become and hopes it does n't happen . 
  then it happens , and she just stares at the camera .

  `` then harry woke up from underneath the stairs to the sound of uncle vernon yelling '', 
  still , though . 
  most advertisements are supposed to be understandable for people who could n't figure even that out . 
  the problem here is that people see the world as `` us and god '' , when they should look at it like `` us and maybe a certain reason we all exist '' . 
  i mean , holy fuck , every religion ever is ** faith ** . 
  god is first and foremost a * theory * . 
  when doubts arise , it 's ludicrous to dismiss every logical question for something that increasingly gets more and more holes in it . 
  ... `` hello , 911 ? '', 
  the books ended with an adult harry potter , so you 're wrong . 
  whoa !,
