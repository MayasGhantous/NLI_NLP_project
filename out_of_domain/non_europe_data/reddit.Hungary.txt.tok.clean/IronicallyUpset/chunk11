  * burps * `` morty , morty , i need you to * buuurp * i need you to , uh , to harvest all these ** flimawangs ** , these ** flimawangs ** are vital to my * buuurp * , to my research , morty ! '', 
  thanks , what really drove the idea home was that it looks like intelligent brings were being harvested . 
  really rick and morty style . 
  yeah , that 's basically every reply ever on this post . 
   that fucking bitch failed me because i did too well . 
  that 'll teach you !, 
  my eyesight is worse than anyone knows . 
  world is either bugged or the doctor is a fucking idiot . 
  i do n't ... what ? 
  what the fuck did he think was going to happen ? 
  here , let me fix this . 
  r/cozyplaces . 
  loneliness . 
  actually , a large amount of people do n't even know they have herpes , either because the symptoms ** never ** manifest , or you just do n't notice little red bumps ` round your junk because the human body is covered by little bumps . 
  herpes is n't even annoying unless you 've been cast away from normal society because of puritanical christians fear mongering a stupid , harmless thing . 
  in short , there 's nothing wrong with herpes unless you * think * there 's something wrong with herpes . 
  unlike keemstar . 
  that 's not how addiction works . 
  dumb bitch , cutting with the wrong edge . 
  i think these flags represent what these countries are about well . 
  the american flag is easy , the logos are there because america is a capitalistic nation , buy shit or nothing works . 
  the soviet union on the other hand is represented as an eagle , a traditional symbol of power , perhaps also symbolizing the soviet union 's fascism the same way a bird of prey might watch everything it 's servants do , from above . 
  the talons representing the secret police , snatching people away in the blink of an eye . 
  but it does n't matter because you did n't read this far , faggot . 
  who was the first person you instinctively looked at ? 
  `` come on , gang !, 
  we 've got to follow these clowns into the forest and figure out what 's going on ! '', 
  ** man **, 
  equality ? 
  what a bitch . 
  ( give me karma ), 
  good for you , it seems that most comments in this post are about punishing thought and rewarding sheep-like behavior . 
  funny thing is that i would at least had a positive 2 if i had n't also written ( give me karma ) . 
  the secret to saying shit like that on r/dankmemes and not having negative karma is adding ` faggot ' at the end . 
  alligators are not weapons . 
  no assault charges ? 
  attempted homicide ? 
  i just do n't understand . 
  she did n't want her child to become a weeaboo . 
  death is inevitable and unpredictable . 
  if you ca n't go outside , why can your parents ? 
  because they 're responsible and you 're not ? 
  fucking prove it . 
  that one mistake you made when you were 8 ? 
  fuck ups happens , everyday life is n't life and death for a 17 y/o in your country ( i assume ) . 
  obviously these things wo n't work for your father , he seems the type to not listen to any rational argument if its not on his side of the issue . 
  only thing you can do is ** endure ** . 
  endure until the day that you can become independent and spread your wings , soar in the skies , and revel in your freedom , you glorious bastard . 
  what ? 
  should n't there be something about consent there ? 
  `` is that sexual harassment ? '', 
  `` no it 's humongous '', 
  `` humongous what ? '', 
  `` humongous slander lawsuit , bitch . '', 
  portal ends * with * the cake , make no mistake it exists . 
  i fucking hate lydia for that reason alone . 
  it just sounds so fucking tired and sarcastic . 
  i mean , bitch , we 're not even out of dragon 's reach yet and you 're already sassy . 
  `` if you ca n't handle me at my worst , you do n't deserve me at my best . '', 
  bitch , if you say that * you do n't have a best * . 
  did he find out ? 
  did she ? 
  did * any * coworker ? 
  i 've always been partial to `` do n't mug me '' . 
  * motherfucker . . 
  that 's because they know that any sane person would say it 's fucked up . 
  that 's because a centaur is 2/3 horse , 1/2 man . 
  2/3 horse + 1/2 horse equals the above image . 
  i assume from now on you will be sleeping upsidedown ? 
  it will take practice , but you 'll have a nice bed to fall into . 
  `` fuck it !, 
  * laughs, 
  page loads, 
  i regret this . '', 
  ** diet ** coke , trust me , they cancel each other out . 
  the fuck ? 
  what 's with you and the ussr ? 
  i remember you from your post about the soviet and american flags . 
  meme of the month september : upvote for google, 
  no woman was ever killed for not wearing a bikini at the beach . 
  the equestrian centipede, 
  the implicit logic of this is not that it 's okay to do * it * because hitler did it , but that people lie . 
  4 years , 5 months , and 185 karma . 
   dinner for two ... 
  nights, 
  saw your username lol, 
  perhaps they are a being of higher dimensions ? 
  inspired by r/jokes obviously . 
  two friends put in real money , last friend is a jew and writes a checks for 15k , taking the real money knowing the check wo n't be cashed . 
  beat me to it . 
  what am i forgetting ? 
  illogical questions may never be granted logical answers . 
  you may call a set a ** set of all sets ** , but it will never be able to contain itself , thus rendering the question inane . 
  if god is all powerful , it makes perfect sense that he could not make something that he could not ( x ) , exactly * because * he is all powerful . 
  the question is inane . 
  or maybe i 'm in * s * ane . 
  most ? 
  no fucking way . 
  i 'm super into philosophy but i have an extremely hard time believing 51 % or more of people who associate themselves with philosophy are just doing it because them want to seem sophisticated and intricate . 
  maybe ten percent or less .
