  people need to understand that criticism of islam and refugees is n't necessarily a bad thing . 
  there are a fuckton of problems with the ongoing crisis right now and it seems everyone is talking about ungrateful , sometimes violent muslims . 
  these are real things that need to be addressed , but when they * are * addressed , people are labelled islamophobes . 
  personally , if saying that they should be more grateful for europe opening up its borders and not letting them become sex slaves or corpses is islamophobia , then i guess i 'm islamophobic . 
  if saying that these people should not be forgiven for their crimes and making sure everyone is treated equally is islamophobia , then i guess i 'm islamophobic . 
  but if that 's what you 're going to make islamophobia about that , then i guess i 'm proud . 
  help these people live their lives , but do n't take any of their shit .

  wait , so * does * a flush beat a straight ? 
  i 'm trying to not use google so much anymore . 
  never works for me . 
  if i try to finish with a couple of sentences heading into the next topic , i return the next day and go `` shit , what direction was i headed in ? '', 
  controversial, 
  this belongs in r/unexpected, 
  i remember i went to relieve myself one time and the stream went completely 90 \u00b0 . 
  i often think about how the problem would be mostly solved if we sat down for our business , but we simply ** have ** to stand up . 
  truly , * man 's * most beautiful exercise of freedom , despite the potential consequences . 
  i feel like a lot of people in the comments on this post have come the the conclusion that women have a lot of social and emotional privilege , crushing stereotypes and getting compliments . 
  did you know that a lot of drug addicts die because they get help but relapse ? 
  what basically happens is that they break and use the drug again , but their body has lost its tolerance to the drug and they take way too much at once . 
  my point is that it 's been a while since i 've visited this subreddit and the edge is getting to me . 
  there 's no way a * nice guy * did n't make this . 
  the guy fawkes mask is the icing on the cake , especially considering that it 's mostly in shadow . 
  honestly , what upsets me most is the grammar . 
  obviously , the emphasis was on the mcdonald 's . 
  there 's nothing more romantic than assuring your ex-so that nobody loves them except the person they hate . 
  a * pornstar * ? 
  holy shit , that 's sad . 
  why the laughter and vomit ? 
  okay , this is pretty good . 
  well , very not * good * , but you know what i mean . 
  i want to reply with a witty comment but i do n't know any football terminology . 
  * nice *, 
  thanks o.p. 
  `` it 's okay that i treat you like shit because everyone treats you like shit . '', 
  i 'll keep this in mind , but why ? 
  they kept an eye out for someone with his description for 30 years . 
  man , that was a painful gif . 
  real talk , that 's just a living potato, 
  [ i felt an obligation to link this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmtlnxjlni ), 
  people inconsiderate about other peoples ' want for quiet , probably . 
  why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch . 
  how * much * cabbage did he give you ? 
  adult diapers , people will think you are weird . 
  thanks for the chuckle , m8 . 
  i 'd give you gold if i could spare the money . 
  it 's unconscionable to withhold medicine from people * because it 's illegal * . 
  how do you think pharmacists are supposed to get paid ? 
  ftfy, 
  `` the steam punk 's pledge '', 
  that 's some quality cringe , right there . 
  okay , this is pretty hilarious . 
  you drink soda for the taste , not the company . 
  idiot . 
  have you tried turning it off and on again ? 
  joke ? 
  if not , why ? 
  do you take * any * enjoyment in the soda ? 
  do you prefer another company 's soda over the one you support ? 
  basically , i 'm calling for an ama . 
  i fucking ** love ** the grammar in this post , as if there are a plethora of people claiming to have slept with your mother and you are trying to determine who in actuality * did * in fact sleep with your mother simply by their voice . 
  * downvoted *, 
  i could quit any time , but i * really * wan na get these guys !, 
  make doof meme of the month for october, 
  lol , no, 
  feels bad , man . 
   the * vast majority * of christians , on the other hand , pretend that their god is some kind of all-loving being that * loves gays * , peace , and is opposed to slavery when the exact opposite were practised in christendom and condoned in the bible . 
  gon na need some sources on that stuff , but you ca n't just blindly say '' ** slavery ** '' and condemn the bible . 
  sure , slavery in the bible is pretty clear on the `` this living , breathing being is your property '' as shown in exodus 21:20 -21 . 
   when a man strikes his slave , male or female , with a rod and the slave dies under his hand , he shall be avenged . 
  ** but if the slave survives a day or two , he is not to be avenged , for the slave is his money . 
  but this is pretty much justified under the belief that the master will be nice to their slave ( colossians 4:1 ) , similar to some sort of servitude but you know , they 're a slave . 
   masters , treat your slaves justly and fairly , knowing that you also have a master in heaven . 
  of course , you can just * completely * ignore that bit and be justified by a book for being a terrible human being , but all of religion is about faith . 
  that apparently spreads to the community as well . 
  `` you talk shit about people , so fuck you ! '', 
  a smart man can -- no , i 'm sorry , this is just too fucking stupid . 
  honestly , the only upside to being a muggle is science . 
  science fucking rocks . 
  really ? 
  i 've never heard anyone talk shit about red heads because of their hair . 
  the concept of mocking someone because of their hair colour is ridiculous to me . 
  personally , i find red heads attractive , so that might have something to do with it . 
  thought it was a gif for a second , was just waiting for the cat to drop onto the dog ,, 
  wrong sub , op , you meant to put this in r/aww, 
  `` this just fucked my head up . 
  i have fucking stupid friends . '', 
  ** courage **, 
  it 's really funny because they prize intelligence but they made this pile of shit . 
  i think i need to take a break from this sub . 
  i mean , i get that people are fucking stupid , * but why are they associating anonymous with this * ? 
  * why * ? 
  * how is anonymous related to this * ? 
  those first two lines should be enough to deter people from reading any more . 
  a thing people made did n't ruin yt , the people that made the thing that ruined yt ruined yt !, 
   i did put it there . 
  * they did n't want it * , so it 's here . 
  i do n't ... 
  i do n't understand .
