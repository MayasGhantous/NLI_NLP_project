  stephan with a ` ph ' , mind you . 
  this is not negotiable . 
  why was this post allowed to go above 420 ? 
  prob not original , saw two comments yesterday that went something like, 
  `` this election is so fucked , i 'd rather vote for my refrigerator . '', 
  `` your refrigerator is running ? '', 
  huh , i got democrat , but it was 51 % to 49 % conservative . 
  this does n't necessarily mean you are a homosexual if you become confused . 
  you named your dog `` a newly emerged flying ant '' ? 
  good god , why is n't this top comment ? 
  just today i put some water in my water bottle and i went to the freezer to put some ice in it . 
  i put in an ice-cube that was a good 4 cm cubed in it and not a minute later i opened it up and it was gone . 
  the temperature was n't very hot , i just like cold water . 
  not under any influence and perfectly sane . 
  leaked photo of the doctor strange set !, 
  `` geometrical mindfuck tattoo '' , a summary . 
  i 'm very scared that erdogan is going to side with isis and is trying to get nukes . 
  the dude 's a fucking lunatic and europe is going to be invaded . 
  when has someone ever called themselves a mystic and had a real job ? 
  they are . 
  not throwing a group member down the stairs . 
  it was a group of 4 and we had a very small group project we could finish easily in a day , 2 at most . 
  this asshole goofed off constantly and when he did try it was n't a half assed effort , it was maybe an eighth assed effort . 
  this was n't the type of project where we had to accomplish a goal in a team , mind you . 
  every member of the group was expected to do the same amount of as everyone else and what they contributed had to be clear . 
  the entirety of the project i told him that we he needed to get serious and put more effort into work , but he just shrugged it off . 
  on the 4th day i told the group that i was sick of trying to be patient with him and that we could finish in less than 5 minutes if it were n't for him , so i told the group that i wanted to eject him from the group . 
  everyone except the slacker agreed and when i turned around to adjust everything we had gotten together slightly , due to his now agreed dismissal , the motherfucker punched me in the side of the head . 
  we were standing at the top of a flight of stairs . 
  guy got an in school suspension , and the teacher `` smoothed things out '' between us . 
  i left the group because if he would n't leave , i would . 
  got a new partner and finished in 5 minutes . 
  for the next 2 weeks he taunted me , repeating the same bullshit fucking lies he told others . 
  `` heh , i punched you in the face , right ? '' . 
  motherfucking coward sucker punched me when i turned away from him . 
  the true hero is harambe . 
  just looking at this made me realize all over again that the amount of colours we can see are so few . 
  just looking at this mass of white , black , grey , and some other colours made me so ... just , upset that we can only see these limited range of colours . 
  shit . 
  my sister got that stuffy from our parents when she was about 5 . 
  i never saw what was good about it , but she still has it to this day and she loves it . 
  you got knocked the ** fuck out ** !, 
  i 'm subscribed to dank memes , so i just immediately tapped the picture . 
  it was so autistic that i knew immediately it was from here . 
  edit : you 'll never know . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  this has been fairly fucking old for a fairly fucking long time . 
  tl ; dr for you lazy bastards , some guy was elected leader of the philippines . 
  he was elected because he served as the mayor of one of the safest places in the world for decades . 
  he achieved this by sending death squads into the streets to murder criminals , unbeknownst to many voters . 
  he 's promised to kill 100,000 criminals in less than a year and last i heard he had 60,000 people imprisoned because they surrendered , knowing the other option was being executed in the streets . 
  everything bad in the world is n't limited to terrorists in the middle east and europe , or corruption in the americas . 
  oh no , how could i do literally * anything * else but fantasize about the past , ignoring present and/or the future ? 
  you mean 2014-2016 , retard ? 
  let 's be realistic , the joker would just scrap it and do something stupid with it . 
  fits his philosophy of `` all this work you 've done has been for nothing , embrace this world 's madness and chaos ! '', 
  i 'm so sorry !, 
  i do n't have any words . 
  that just seems so ... depressing . 
  god . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  damn . 
  that 's kind of sadder . 
  i 'm sorry about that . 
  next time you see that guy give him a pat on the back and tell him it 's from reddit . 
  you 're setting your character up for greatness . 
  do n't ever do that , unless it 's specifically in a prophecy type story in which case set them way off to the side . 
  the best stories are n't about everything going right for your character because he * has * to win , right ? 
  i remember reading a great trilogy where the main character is super fucking important to the story , but he 's not the main character in his world . 
  that would be his son , who 's still in the womb , and you only know this because you pieced together obscure clues the author left you and ** oh shit ** his son his has been prophesized as the saviour of the world but you do n't care because that would have been a boring story of `` well he ca n't die , right ? '' . 
  see what i 'm getting at ? 
  anyways , i 'm getting sidetracked . 
  firstly , thank goodness the father is an enforcer . 
  not too high up , not too low . 
  ditch his reputation as the best enforcer the local scarface has . 
  i like how he dies , but maybe changed the date . 
  make his death 's aftermath a bit more complex . 
  next , your main character . 
  give him a fucking childhood , would you ? 
  you want your character to be batman ? 
  because that 's how you make your character batman . 
  also , add small rebellions in with his training . 
  make him a slave , not a willing subject . 
  you want him to be good at everything they teach him ? 
  throw that shit out the window . 
  he 's shit , but he gets better . 
  when he 's on the ** cusp ** of becoming proficient with everything , that 's when he 's given the mission of murder . 
  stuff happens , he runs away . 
  now he does n't have an instructor and he has to figure everything out for himself . 
  you ca n't make him a brooding emo with a dead mom who thrashes everyone he fights . 
  finally , the apothecary . 
  they are ** not ** trained in magic . 
  make it so that they are skilled in magic , but were passed up by the snooty sorcerer or wizard back in his childhood . 
  he dabbles , but he focuses on being an apothecary when a kind enough woman accepts his request for the apprenticeship . 
  he teaches ** some ** stuff to your mc , not everything he knows .
