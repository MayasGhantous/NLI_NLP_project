  tl ; dr let your characters ** evolve ** . 
  bad --  kinda good, 
  you 're welcome . 
  it 's always nice to help people . 
  i 'm not as skilled in story building as the u/american _ genghis but i hope i helped . 
  i think that might actually be a crime . 
  like , if i was announcing that everyone in the near vicinity would get a ** free ** balloon , that means that there is no payment , right ? 
  i do n't think that it 's technically eliminating a transaction , like `` here , have a balloon , free of charge . '', 
  and then they respond `` thank you for giving mean a balloon free of charge . '', 
  am i making any sense ? 
  let me try again . 
  i think it might be a crime because the vendor of those free balloons did not ** give ** it to them . 
  there was no mutual consent that one party would take the balloon and the other party would directly say to the other that they could have it . 
  okay wait , how about this . 
  sex without mutual consent is rape . 
  if there are two people that want to have sex with each other , but neither party makes it explicitly clear , then both parties are okay with it but it 's still rape . 
  am i grasping at straws ? 
  it seems unlikely to me that the barbarian would be foot first for the entire fall . 
  should 've rolled for that . 
  whoa , so even as space itself expanded , therefore moving all parts and particles of any object , it would just stay put , bending the laws of physics ? 
  rad . 
  i 've seen racism embraced quite a bit in this subreddit , but it seems like everyone acknowledges that it 's all just in good fun . 
  kind of conflicted here . 
  kuul repost ya got here, 
  prequel meme was better cause it was shit . 
  i do n't see `` book of faggots '' in that photograph . 
  tl ; dr it 's a magic stick , what did you expect ? 
  i 've heard claw machines only use full power with their claws on the 17-19th time . 
  apparently in this world germany invaded the english * language * . 
  i see that there are 999 comments on this post so i am doing what must be done . 
  also , if this is true , i wonder how my family would react to this if a family member would be diagnosed with it . 
  they 've got a very strong stance against all drugs , including weed for some reason . 
  would they be adamant , choosing to deal with their shit , or would they swallow their ideals ? 
  stole a joke from r/jokes, 
  attempt to severely injured the closest three people to them . 
  really fucking sad that thomas was willing to throw several potential marriages out the window because he valued his parents ' happiness more than his own . 
  `` stayin ' alive '' by the bee gees . 
  i legit just realized that this has to be played at my funeral . . 
  oh my god , i remember only once when my gym teacher told the class we could have free time and we could use any gym equipment we wanted to , so we took these boards , tied jump ropes to the sides , and then we 'd just pull each other along the gym floor at what we must 've thought were crazy speeds , but we also did a lot of ** drifting ** and it was so exciting !, 
  that was a long sentence . 
  that seems extremely logical but do we know for sure that he was straight immediately before he was released ? 
  it seems to me that it would be exceedingly hard to have such a precise control over magic at such a distance . 
  i hope in the olympic gold medal to get a day to sit down , but the folds of the so many stomach will reach the maximum amount . 
  the flag with the white field and red cross is the flag of england , you uneducated cucks . 
  why not zoidberg ? 
  try, 
  `` what kind of fucking moron needs pictures in their dictionary ? '', 
  that dumb fucking parent . 
  intelligence does n't equal knowledge . 
  whoa . 
  dumb motherfucker . 
  if you have a vagina , you are biologically a girl . 
  if you have a penis , you are biologically a boy . 
  gender is not a fucking social construct . 
  how you treat people based on whether they have a penis or a vagina is . 
  as a moderate liberal , i agree . 
  this is what makes d&d great . 
  `` i 'm in the mood to be degraded '', 
  she just moved out and misses her parents . 
  read this as hazz - ul - nut, 
  well , kind of . 
  homosexuality is a failure . 
  if you 're not sexually attracted to the only gender that can help you have kids , then you ca n't have kids . 
  all of evolution is based around you having the best kids for some reason . 
  we as humans have grown beyond pure instinct now , though . 
  we have civilization . 
  we have ethics . 
  you 're gay ? 
  bang who you want , as long as you have consent . 
  but you ca n't really have kids and that makes you a failure in the eyes of whatever cruel god created life for whatever cruel purposes they wanted . 
  i am unironicallyupset . 
  i do n't think i had any choice over whether i ever woke up when i went to sleep last night for any or no reason at all . 
  the lions would win if they attacked at night . 
  what country does he represent ? 
  they 're the four stooges !, 
  ... rich people ... 
  looks great , but the size makes it look pretty impractical . 
  i 'm very new to d&d . the prince is my spirit animal . 
  absolutely machiavellian . 
  i hope the name is on purpose . 
  you took it to a fucking * perfect * level . 
  new dragon gods , perhaps some are old players , you wiped the board upon which every empire stood , creating new empires , kings , boarders , lore , dynamics between groups of people , and the center stage for an * epic * . 
  not epic as in awesome , but i literally mean an ** epic ** . 
  a hero 's saga . 
  i would give you gold if i had any money to spare . 
  god bless your campaigns . 
  just `` sir finley mrrgglton '' it . 
  d&d has the rules it does to make the game more fun , not for the sake of just creating rules . 
  if making a pc kobold enhances the experience , go ahead . 
  explain this to your dm . 
  just do n't brush away rules that are n't broken . 
  a lawful evil character can be described as a tyrant that legitimately tries to help his country , but is a tyrant nonetheless . 
  petty , cruel , ** respects ** power and order . 
  content with being second in command , while admiring and being envious of their superior . 
  just generally think of an le character as someone trying to establish order through evil . 
  not necessarily an ** evil ** character . 
  correction , your w ** orld ** got a little darker today . 
  alt ** ered ** his perception of the world . 
  well ? 
  did you get the sale ?
