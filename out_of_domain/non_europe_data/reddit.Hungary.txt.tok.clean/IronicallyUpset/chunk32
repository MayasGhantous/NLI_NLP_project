  ahh , now they 've brought us a nutritious meal !, 
  is it ** poisoned ** ? 
  the bottom one has a darker shade of red , am i right ? 
  but is there a difference between the yellows ? 
  very similar to the isle of man . 
  any connection ? 
  or are the legs just more common than i know ? 
   putting it in, 
  digging reclamation of lost land , not so much the nazism . 
  those were hungary 's lands before we lost ww1 .

  * could * spiderman beat the hulk ? 
  what a weak bitch . 
  her attack consisted of pushing down someone who was kneeling . 
  but spiderman swings, 
  \u00bf que ? 
   bashes you in the skull with a hammer, 
  ** death to fascists **, 
  honestly , i 'm on team hulk . 
  spiderman is super-humanly strong , but he does n't have even a fraction of the hulk 's strength . 
  his webs are useless too , the hulk could could easily rip them apart . 
  the only thing spidey has going for him is speed and i have a feeling that would n't be enough . 
   superb owl, 
  where can i buy these ? 
  a little insect taking down the hulk would only make him madder . 
  i refuse to believe that last juke was intentional . 
  wow !,

  wait , so do we downvote ? 
  * rate my setup *, 
  watch_dogs 2 seems like it 's a better game than watch_dogs , but from what i heard its sales are n't what they should be . 
  i think it 's probably because they went from ** gritty ** to * 1337 haxorz *, 
  nuke , * nuke * , ** nuke ** , ** nuke **, 
  how strange everything looks from this angle . 
  minimap is just western europe . 
  the winner is ... 
  friendship ? 
  aerials are n't too bad , i just had to re-imagine all jumping and flying maneuvers i had learned previously at expert level . 
  what the fuck, 
  i agree , seeing as how a cross is the downvote button . 
  why is half of the hungarian coat of arms gone ? 
  why is the green underneath our half of the flag gone ? 
  those are the \u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes . 
  saying that that 's the historical hungarian flag is like saying that [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/canadian_red_ensign_%281957-1965%29.svg ) is the historical canadian flag . 
  you 're completely ignoring history and that * flags change throughout it * . 
  that coa is incorrect for that point in time . 
  it makes no sense for the double cross , hills , and crown to be gone from the sinister side . 
  edit : what i mean when i said `` saying that that 's the historical hungarian flag is like saying that [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/canadian_red_ensign_%281957-1965%29.svg ) is the historical canadian flag '' is that while it 's technically true , it should n't be represented like that forever . 
  emphasis on ** historical ** . 
  i understand changing the flag to become the naval ensign , but i do n't understand why those specific changes are made . 
  by taking away the green under our side it gives the illusion that it is the full austrian flag with two different coa 's inside . 
  aside from that , it also makes zero sense to only display the \u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes in the hungarian coa . 
   ( absolute nutters ! ), 
  * god wills it *, 
  viking = neckbeard, 
  knight = tincan, 
  let 's not get ahead of ourselves . 
  ghost fingers tickling mah balls, 
  at the end of the day , we all know that it was the knight 's meme machine that powered them to victory . 
  that being said ,, 
  the problem is that you guys do n't have a meme and neither do the samurai , really . 
  the knights however have at least two . 
  * retake the holy land/jerusalem, 
  no matter how much you guys shitpost , you 'll never beat our meme machine without a meme of your own . 
  dank 4chan reference . 
   mind numbingly dull, 
  it becomes bearable after you lose yours . 
  that 's clever . 
  thanks . 
  ** did they just assume xir gender ??? 
  wow , how long did it take her build a strawman * that * huge ? 
  [ * deity * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvo5bufww0 ), 
  make like alexander the great and , uhh , `` forge bonds '' with your fellow warriors in times of war . 
  i wonder how the map will change when new factions are inevitably added in . 
  will the borders be redrawn ? 
  or will a whole new map be introduced ? 
  edit : just a hope i have , sorry if somehow i might 've misled people . 
  well , i hope . 
  it 's just a hope i have . 
  made me gag .

  you already have it , you need to retake slightly south of the northern land .
