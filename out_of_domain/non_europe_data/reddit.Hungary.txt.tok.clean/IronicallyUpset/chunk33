  there 's this thing among neo-nazis , it 's called 1488 . 
  it 's basically code for we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children . 
  14 words . 
  the 88 part can be explained by the fact that h is the eighth letter in the alphabet . 
  88 means heil hitler . 
  only the 14 part is useful here though . 
  when people like these come along and talk about reducing the number of white babies , they just empower neo-nazism . 
  fuck both groups , but fuck the person featured in this post a little bit more for adding fuel to the fire .

  edit : when given a kind of repeating pattern , that is, 
  good . 
  it 's the fucking corporations that are screwing people over and it 's been like this for a long time . 
  let 's just hope he actually does something about it . 
  it looks like that firetruck in the background is floating . 
  just on the side of the r/accidentalrenaissance sub is a picture of a very important comment that reads, 
   `` cool picture '' is not the same as accidental renaissance . 
  stop upvoting this shit . 
  while i do agree that this is a cool picture , i just ca n't see this being r/accidentalrenaissance material . 
  in america there are more empty homes than homeless people . 
  the solution is n't taxing the rich , it 's taxing the rich ** and ** implementing effective systems to combat poverty .
