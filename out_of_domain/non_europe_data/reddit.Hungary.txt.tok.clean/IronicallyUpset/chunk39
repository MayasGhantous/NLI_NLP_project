   `` no , strength is for fascists '', 
   `` yeah , just because we 're literally immobile does n't make them better than us '', 
  the far left will never win, 
   father enticing son with porn, 
  actually , it 's been found out that he did n't say that in the first panel . 
  considering the large clumps of hair in the shot , i 'd guess she lost a bet or something . 
  a student submitted his paper , she did n't like his opinion , imagined him to be her rapist , and gave him a zero because of it ? 
  wow . 
  that actually sounds like the best explanation i can think of . 
  true . 
  it 's been deleted . 
  when i saw this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/68au09/european_monster_1_spain/dgx0c0f/?context=3 ) i felt inspired, 
  looks like a rip off of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b35hzj4.png ) by u/iotafox for the [ february contest ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/5vb1jw/february_contest_winners_thread/ ) . 
  got rid of the bars , and then some minor changes . 
  `` how much did sundar pichai make last year ? '', 
  `` a bit more now , thanks ! '', 
  there are riots and protests happening all over in america , but i think people should remember that it 's not the trump supporters they should be angry at , it 's clinton & co. for giving the anti-establishment people no other option . 
  what does r represent ? 
  soft c 's . 
  true , there are some really thick people who believe even now that trump is their savior , but i do n't think it 's fair to say that they 're * all * like that . 
  clinton 's general campaign was `` my opponent is _____ '' . 
  trump 's campaign , excluding many awful things , was `` make america great again ! '', 
  they knew he was lying , but there was that tiny glimmer of hope . 
  and they took it . 
  and the world was conned . 
  did n't washington say that he was worried that such a divide as is present today would occur between the people * because * of the two party system ? 
  i 've been hearing theories that clinton 's team thought that there was no way that america would vote in trump , so they actually helped him through the primary expecting to destroy him in the general . 
  apollo asteroids wiped out the dinosaurs and we 're overdue for the next one . 
  being a jew does n't mean you have supernatural nazi-hunting senses . 
  reminds me of a muslim holding a sign that says `` kill those who say islam is violent '' or something like that . 
  worse , it was n't ** sonic boom ** . 
  `` man '' can mean men and women , while `` woman '' excludes men . 
  concatenation ? 
  in the minions movie , the minions were conveniently in the antarctic , away from ww2 so nazi minions would n't be a thing . 
  women * want * him , men want to ** be ** him . 
  `` hello friends and enemies '' is kinda funny though, 
  tbh i hope everyone that does n't like the new skin becomes so offended that they just stop playing ow altogether . 
   [ save ], 
  hol up, 
  whoa . 
  that 's super true . 
  it 's entirely possible that they 're pissing themselves over a game they 've never played . 
  austria is always the psychologist/therapist because freud was austrian . 
  del toro is n't involved , is he ? 
  good ad , op . 
  i did n't even know that a vote was going on but titan brawl seems the most fun . 
  pleasantly surprised . 
  if this far left feminism is nazi germany ( feminazis ) and islam is the ussr ( nothing clever ) , then what is poland ? 
  what the fuck , op ?

  and so was abraham lincoln . 
  that 's right , black people freed black people !, 
  we did n't need white people ever !, 
  to be fair , they were demanding his ** personal ** property . 
  private property and personal property are different . 
  no , that would be like taking your car ( personal property ) to stop you from going to your factory ( private property ) . 
   you do n't understand communism, 
   only retarded commies understand commmunism, 
  u/bamboo68 explained it very well . 
   personal property : toothbrush , clothes , your bed , your laptop, 
   private property : farmland , factories , essentially means of production and excessive personal property, 
  just looking up the definitions of private and personal does n't give you an understanding of private and personal property . 
  what about you guys ? 
  what would * you * do if your son tried that ? 
  at least the muslims will move on towards germany . 
  * because jews *,

  what game is this ? 
  why do the graphics look so bad ** / s **, 
  reminds me of one time when someone on 4chan tried to explain how alt-right people are made . 
  first you start off with a normal conservative , then an autistic xhe-wolf screams at you for being white , and then you figure maybe hitler was onto something . 
  as * goodburger * taught us , everyone is a dude , dude .

  lol , the guy who owned 100 + slaves loved them,

  you realize wikileaks had no part in the leaks , right ? 
  they came from 4chan .
