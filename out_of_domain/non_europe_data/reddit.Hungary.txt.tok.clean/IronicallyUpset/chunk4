  i 've always seen myself as machiavellian and the prince , a type of le character , seemed to be an embodiment of this . 
  it 's good to know that naming that type of character `` prince '' was on purpose because they recognized that they were machiavellian . 
  no , ( name ) , we do n't have a favourite child . 
  i do n't know if this is real and i just have to say this is the greatest example of schr\u00f6dinger 's cat i 've ever experienced !, 
  never has the relation between housecat and lion ever been clearer . 
  oh god , i would never do that . 
  i would always give back all the change and just * ask * if i could keep a coin or two . 
  what 's wrong with today 's kids ? 
  kekl, 
  what ? 
  do you have a learning disability ? 
  ** how you treat people ** based on whether they have a penis or vagina = social construct, 
  your ** body part ** being a penis or a vagina = biology, 
  ... that 's very good advice . 
  i 'm not sure about japan 's side of the story , but just when nuclear plants were just being built , a lot of americans thought they were just going to have free power , that everything would be swell and dandy . 
  i believe that this may be the reason a lot of american heroes have radiation in their origin story , because people thought that they would become the men of tomorrow . 
  the idea of nuclear plants was however pretty much abandoned , due to all the cons and poor mixture of physics and engineering at the time . 
  nuclear plants have a lot more promise nowadays but people just wo n't take the risk . 
  i may not know people , but at least i know math . 
  biologically , no . 
  they ate a sheep . 
  philosophically , they changed the guy into a nice form and ate him . 
  if i had the money , i would definitely move there . 
  i 'm not sure how the family would react tho, 
  please tell us !, 
  i know that , i meant that the concept of schr\u00f6dinger 's cat is in play here for me . 
  chronological order , eh ? 
  better make it the first . 
  thanks !,

  unless the jedi does n't truly embody jedi ideals , that 's impossible . 
  guy who has a good reason for going sith vs. a good jedi ? 
  yeah , they 've got a sad story and everything , but that does n't excuse them of anything . 
  michael phelps still got gold . 
  this would n't fly in any court . 
  just because your computer recorded visiting a site does n't mean that it was * you * that did it . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd want that . 
  unless we all would 've ** really ** wanted to purchase the house , it would n't feel right to ask them to help clean a literal castle if i could 've gotten a really nice house for way less . 
  knew there would be a great psych story as top comment , but i would n't have expected one this funny . 
  i posted this before i saw this comment . 
  guess i 'll go delete it before people tell me i stole a comment . 
  was going to post the face tattoo bit but you had the advantage of time .

  congratulations , you now have more upvotes than the question . 
  i understand that , but how does the computer know that ** you ** were the one on it ? 
  all it knows it that a specific set of websites were visited and that proves no type of innocence . 
  i just realized . 
  i do n't believe i understand . 
  are you saying that your sex is what biologically makes you male or female , while gender is something you determine for yourself ? 
  if so , i apologize for the misunderstanding . 
  in my original post , when i said gender i do believe i meant sex . 
  a feeling of terror hits me with a thick accent of mystery . 
  `` what ? 
  who are all these people ? 
  why are their names crossed out ? 
  what relation do they have with me ? 
  why is ** my ** name crossed out ? '', 
  all these thoughts are dashed into dust with the arrival of an atrociously painful cold in my waist and a sudden weakness in legs as the pain doubles . 
  the cold had left my body , but the fresh air was quick to try to replace it . 
  i look over my right shoulder , hoping to find the source of the pain . 
  terror , a fear incarnate strikes me . 
  `` shit , '' i utter , trying to turn away from a kid holding a bloody kitchen knife . 
  `` i 'm so sorry sir , she took my brother , she said i had to kill you , '' he whimpered as he cleaned the blade on my nice white shirt . 
  i passed out while he ran out of the apartment . 
  beginning : `` nuh uh '', 
  til gorillas are herbivores . 
  your forehead is bigger than your personality . 
  trump does n't know whether he 'll do * any * presidential debates . 
  `` they 'll cheat ! '', 
  they will though . 
  not sure how to feel about this . 
  this is probably inspired by monty python and the holy grail .

  okay , so in my elementary school there were two fields for the students to play around on during recess . 
  both were level but one was maybe twice as large as the other . 
  the larger one was at the top of ... 
  i want to say hill or plateu , but that does n't quite describe it . 
  let 's just say the larger is quite elevated compared to the smaller field . 
  maybe two stories . 
  anyways , the smaller field has a playground . 
  the much larger field has , i shit you not , two goal posts . 
  not even really goal posts , just two sets of poles connected at the top . 
  you were n't allowed on the small field if you were above 3rd grade . 
  you just had a bunch of kids wandering around a large , gravel filled field . 
  maybe 10 kids could play soccer . 
  it rained that day ? 
  fuck you . 
  so many conflicts are caused regularly online and offline that it 's just ridiculous .
