  ) , etc. 
  by refusing entry to all of them , you eliminate a large gateway for terrorism . 
  more liberal western european countries are getting fucked because they 're playing multiculturalism on hard mode . 
  they do n't put enough pressure on muslim communities to stamp out salafism ( an ultra-conservative version of islam ) , and they just keep accepting more and more . 
  government is a big bully , but maybe you need a big bully who sometimes stands up for you over a dozen bullies whose sole purpose is to make money , unregulated by either morals or fear . 
  i think it was snowden that said that it 's not terrorists that take away our rights , government does . 
   sweden does n't have these attacks, 
  did you already forget [ stockholm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_stockholm_attack ) ? 
  the difference is that the north american system of importing these people is via plane , while europeans import these people via borders . 
  the difference between opening hundreds of kilometers of land to anyone from a general direction and opening a plane door is colossal . 
  of course , north america has to step up their own efforts of dealing w / isis recruitment . 
  ultra-liberal movements have been extremely toxic to these efforts though . 
  as i said before , liberal countries do n't put enough pressure on muslim communities to stamp out salafism . 
  no , of course not . 
  representative republics are bullshit for this very reason . 
  elected politicians have literally no obligation to do anything they promised in the election cycle . 
  once they 're voted out in 4 years , the next jackass comes along who says that they 'll fix everything and then they continue the last fuckwad 's work ( this is why i prefer old democracy ) . 
  still though , i have more faith in someone whose job it is to lead than someone whose job it is to profit . 
  edit : i should probably review my comment * before * i save it . 
  what i also want to say is that government gives us a lot of mediocre leaders . 
  these leaders do a lot of ` meh ' and have a bunch of scandals over their terms . 
  i still believe this is better than someone whose job it is to profit ( the head of a company ) . 
  i love the new perspective of the world this map gives . 
  you make very good points . 
  you mean to say that the enemy is not the foreigners , but salafist ideals ? 
  give up mother earth to rule the stars ?

  it 's interesting to not see arpad stripes on the coa . 
  if the viking settlement in canada was permanent,

  too few people got that . 
  yes , but on second thought it does n't make much sense . 
  sure , we often get nazi variants of flags , but that does n't necessarily mean that people would be familiar with the 14 words . 
  there 's a lot of potential in orange + yellow + white .
