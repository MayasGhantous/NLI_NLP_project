  no donkey balls , 0/10,

  [ here 's my revision for it ] ( http://imgur.com/6xbm7bd ) . 
  it just seems a lot more uniform . 
  plus , you can see that canada becomes austria , mexico becomes hungary , and i also noticed [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/6huo5p/a_new_take_on_a_trialist_austriahungary/ ) post today which included croatia in the flag and so i wanted america to be croatia in this case .

  forgot skyrim and rocket league . 
  also , kaffir basically means ` nigger ' in some parts of the world . 
  i get that jesus was n't white , but he definitely was n't black . 
  i met someone from south africa at work . 
  what even happened to her ? 
  boy scouts is n't just about camping and surviving in the wilderness . 
  boy scouts is also largely about boyhood in general . 
  instead of making them let her into their club , how about she improves her club ? 
  jesus christ you fucking mongoloid , can people not make typos ? 
   telling a little girl that feminism sucks, 
  lmao, 
  i 've lived in canada for quite a while now and i have never in my life seen a bag of milk . 
  it 's only ever cartons where i live . 
  i get what you 're doing , but it simply looks ugly to me . 
  [ in canada , all products have to be labelled in english and french , even if you live in british columbia . 
  on a different note , i should buy some more milk . 
  ... nice . 
  that 's fucking smart . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ nice . 
  looks interesting , i 'd read it, 
  the ^ pushed up your : and created that weird little face . 
  try spaces,

   bracing for downvotes, 
   top comment,

  meanwhile alaska, 
  at first i thought you had written `` pray to win '' which is kind of like my experiences with slot machines . 
  oh , it 's the beaverton . 
  jesus christ , what 's wrong with these people ? 
  they did , good sir , they did in fact put gays in death camps . 
  that 's really not fair . 
  sure , they 're not very good movies , but they 're not * that * bad . 
  sci-fi fps games do n't all have to be cod . 
  there can be good games too . 
  lol, 
  eesti * can * into nordic !, 
  maybe a better title would 've been `` flag of new france '' . 
  before i had noticed the flair , i 'd have thought that you redesigned the flag of france . 
  looks like scotland + jamaica . 
  hungary + poland . 
  nice . 
  the current french flag was made when they inserted the white flag of france in between . 
  beautiful . 
  hope it spreads . 
  why does the summer bring faggots ? 
  what a clusterfuck .

  i prefer the third comment . 
  his cousin got a point too . 
  bottom right text is a load of shit . 
  that is clearly not the third comment . 
  wait , there are only two such flags ? 
  that 's incredible !,
