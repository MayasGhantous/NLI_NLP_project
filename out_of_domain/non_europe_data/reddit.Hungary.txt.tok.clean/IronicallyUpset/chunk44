  this actually happened to me a day or two ago on angel city , but we were down like 100 points at the beginning .

  [ for the lazy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhpozqzk9qo ), 
  if the whole admin is full of people like pai , then does that mean that no matter how the debates come out they 'll still vote against nn ? 
   [ the behavior of this administration is best described as `` plutocracy '' where plutocracy ( greek : \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , ploutos , ` wealth ' + \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , kratos , ` rule ' ) or plutarchy , is a form of oligarchy and defines a society ruled or controlled by the small minority of the wealthiest citizens . 
  the first known use of the term was in 1631 . 
  [ 1 ] unlike systems such as democracy , capitalism , socialism or anarchism , plutocracy is not rooted in an established political philosophy . 
  the concept of plutocracy may be advocated by the wealthy classes of a society in an indirect or surreptitious fashion , though the term itself is almost always used in a pejorative sense .

  forgot to link it to the wiki page . 
  ftfy, 
  shame , that . 
  submit this to r/vexillology . 
  how wonderfully offensive, 
  link ? 
  is it not already ? 
  hey , that 's pretty good .

  rogue one is like episode 3.5 , right ? 
  so still kind of a prequel movie . 
  [ concerning this ] ( http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/hungary-is-on-turkey-s-side ), 
  fixed it, 
  god bless the poles . 
   flag of europe, 
  slow down there , bud, 
  not for a few decades more, 
  i actually did something like this for r/vexillologycirclejerk, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillologycirclejerk/comments/64m0lg/flag_of_america_if_it_was_colonized_by_an_alien/ ) it is, 
  if we were to leave the eu , it would be a disaster . 
  i believe in fixing the eu . 
  my mistake , i thought it was only the flag of the european union , which would make it the `` flag of the european union '' . 
  apparently , the eu itself calls it the `` flag of europe '' . 
  i also just learned that it is not only the official symbol of the eu , but also the council of europe . 
  this is the comic equivalent of traveling through the 4th dimension . 
  wot, 
   i 'm sure he did n't totally believe i could make him 5 again , but why chance it ? 
  that 's a good fucking point . 
  it 's hilarious how she talks about historical revisionism when that 's literally what she 's doing, 
  he reminds me of a beluga whale, 
  wait , do people actually do this ? 
  as a tone main , i just wait until they run out and then start shooting . 
  sometimes if they know i have a lock , they wait until i release the actual tracker rockets , so i fuck with their heads and keep shooting normal rounds . 
  what is this meme ? 
  what the fuck, 
  wow , this great, 
  lol, 
  what ? 
  that font makes it unnecessarily difficult to read , i think . 
  pink guy lol, 
  what a load of shit, 
   but it makes it ~ ~ imperial german ~ ~ impractical, 
  it 's on him to use his potential well . 
  delivery driver, 
  are you guys so lazy that you ca n't be fucked to read the text on the thumbnail ? 
  are you saying that imperial german = impractical ? 
  deleted and re-uploaded , censored all names . 
  you learn something new every day . 
  anonymity is good . 
  even if no one knows you , i suppose . 
  for example , no one knows who i am , who is tied to my account , but if it were possible for me to post anonymously on reddit , like on 4chan , i would . 
  `` shave , you look like a pedophile '', 
  some might say more reposty than r/jokes . 
  i should store my sperm and then get a vasectomy . 
  what about it works ? 
  how does it benefit anyone in any way ?

   in iraq, 
  pick one, 
  trump used unconventional smarts , hillary used money, 
  fucking sick stuff , you bet your ass i 'm going to take the products that give me 1:1 is possible . 
  this reminds me of when flat-earthers claim that the whole reason people are lying about the earth being flat is so that they can sell globes . 
  what if there are different parts of the population that have dramatically different tastes ? 
  [ lol ] ( https://youtu.be/4lqrjlmtzzq?t=523 ), 
  did trump and pence have * any * connection before the running ? 
  whoa . 
  exactly , i hate when people say that there are multiverses where multiverses do n't exist . 
  that makes no sense at all . 
  i do n't know much about quantum mechanics , but the many worlds interpretation seems to say that when a particle is measured , separate universes are made where it is either a or b. 
  why stop at reddit , there are good chances that if this is true , the same would apply to facebook and such . 
  there are bees here let 's leave immediately,
