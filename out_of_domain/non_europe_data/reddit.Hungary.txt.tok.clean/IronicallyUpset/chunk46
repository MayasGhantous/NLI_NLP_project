  hey , that 's pretty good, 
  / r/highqualitygifs, 
  roll out !, 
  huh . 
  * not flipping the polish flag completely 0/10 *, 
  `` for the independence and for pepsi ? '', 
  or maybe `` for freedom and for pepsi ? '', 
  ahah , just put it into google translate . 
  i got it right the second time . 
  not even cringe , this is super impressive, 
  ^ official ^ use ^ only ? 
  edit : til this is our [ war flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/war_flag_of_hungary_%281939-1945%2c_size_i%29.svg ), 
  wow !, 
  this looks incredible !, 
  brilliant use of negative space !, 
  yes , the current french flag was creating by taking the flag of paris ( blue-red ) and stuffing the nation 's white into the middle , creating blue-white-red . 
  i say no . 
  it might be pretty , but it takes away from the historical significance . 
  if someone who does n't know about the history of the flags of france or paris looks at this flag , they might think that the only relevance of this flag is its reference to the national flag and the eifell tower . 
  it turns the flag into a sort of gimmick . 
  `` why wo n't my kids just learn to live with my cancerous emotional abuse ? '', 
  still , it 's pretty great, 
  big wars will come again, 
  if the dog is named roll , is it rock on roll ? 
  [ shhh ] ( https://youtu.be/fbsghbxubgu?t=18 ), 
  hang yourself anyway, 
  so it 's not all bad, 
  no , i mean in general . 
  right now peacekeeping efforts are being made that stop many conflicts in the present day but nukes are a big part of it also . 
  eventually it will be proven that mutually assured destruction does n't work and a big blockade will be pulled from conflict 's path . 
  nope , this i 'll just ask for a refund . 
  seconded , this is fucking brutal, 
  op should put this on pornhub, 
  i do n't understand how anyone can * not * use grapple . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you give me the option the spiderman my way across the battlefield i 'm going to take it . 
  80,90 , and 100 are so cool . 
  it 's like having your wings clipped . 
  coa instantly makes * most * flags better . 
  it 's been 24 years since they touched a vagina .

  spiderman  tactician, 
  sorry fam , truth of life, 
  i 'm ashamed to have seen this . 
  anon is not only a degenerate , but a disgrace to his family and anyone who lives within a kilometer of him . 
  best thing about this is that it will actually happen . 
  i promise to god , humanity will advance to a true space-age where space , the final frontier , will become the new wild west . 
  makes you want to just lie down and not ... * be * . 
   hungary facing down austria , instead of other neighbors, 
  i know that the premise is * the purge * in europe , but the above is just silly, 
  wreck-it-ralph was a good movie ( inb4 crucifixion ) but the premise of the new movie seems pretty stupid . 
  the plot is centered around `` we need to get the mcguffin from * the internet * '' and that 's it . 
  it introduces new internet characters , a new internet world , and a weak-sauce villain ( 4chan , prob ) . 
  i doubt anything engaging will appear and it 'll just be a shitty sequel instead of a well thought-out adventure like finding dory . 
  ha , that 's actually really funny . 
  [ you 'll probably spawn on the other side of the map and will only reach your titan once it 's been shot to shit . 
  world war 3 : hitler , again,

  `` no one should be hateful '', 
  i think this extends to painting groups as hateful, 
  whoa . 
  not red-blue-green ? 
  we can worry about two things at once , idiot, 
  * reaches for oven handle *, 
  wow , the dm sounds like a real sack of shit . 
  i like how on the left side of the cross the dividing line is black for estonia , while on the right side it 's white for us . 
  a smart little detail . 
  why the blood ? 
  what inspired each flag ? 
  why is the flag of europe the flag of thailand ? 
  why are the colours displayed on the north american flag disproportional ? 
  an ugly flag for ugly people . 
  [ it 's cheaper , too ] ( https://pics.me.me/almohada-francesa-french-flag-pillow-15-99-eur-almohada-holandesa-dutch-20666088.png ), 
  whoa , that 's fucking badass, 
  * it 's satire *, 
  last panel looks like * he 's * being molested . 
  stan actually does translate roughly to ` land ' so it 's basically land of the afghans , land of the kazakhs , etc, 
  i think it works better with the blue version , this type of blue somehow seems quintessentially american to me . 
  never seen its type on another flag . 
  that 's quite a bit more accurate , yeah, 
  looks good but communism and imperialism do n't mix . 
  bruh wtf, 
  til, 
  fuck dude , a girl that makes gay men straight, 
  context ? 
  yes , exactly !, 
  like a blueberry !,
