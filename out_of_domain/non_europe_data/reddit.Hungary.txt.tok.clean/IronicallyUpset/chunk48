  can you explain each part ? 
  i think the old one was clean , the new one just looks simpler . 
  do you think it 's a good idea for the red , white , and black to be on the union jack , though ? 
  new zealand , as well as every other former british colony , should be going forwards , not backwards .

   towers are degenerate, 
  boss battles are always in towers because they both literally and metaphorically , elevate the situation . 
  nothing ( literally and figuratively ) raises the stakes like the fear of falling 100-300 meters . 
  battles on the ground just feel safe .

   let 's say you 're in the one-handed tree and the masturbation perk is available , which allows you to get your nut without a wench . 
  however , the dragonborn 's just thinking about swinging swords . 
  after brainstorming ideas for a while , the dragonborn , while the player is looking at the other perks , eventually comes up with the idea to use his sword skills for self pleasure . 
   at this point , the player does n't see any other helpful perks so settles for the masturbation perk . 
  while the player just unlocked some new skill that does n't really have a function in the game since it 's a hypothetical , the dragonborn is excited and helicopter dicking it all the way across skyrim , amused at his new idea . 
   does that make sense ?

  [ yuri bezmenov , former kgb agent , on soviet subversion efforts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnpcqsxe8g ), 
  i get very , very scared whenever someone says that relations with russia have to be normalized . 
  russia , despite the fall of the ussr , is still a major nation hell bent on dominating its neighbors , or even more . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnpcqsxe8g ) yuri bezmenov , a former kgb member , talking about soviet subversion efforts . 
  terrifying . 
  i too turn into usain bolt at the beach . 
  that 's a very good point . 
  superpowers are fucking scary , dude . 
  never go full anything , extremists are retarded, 
  the reason i linked to that video is because i believe russia is still attempting subversion of some countries as they did during to times of the ussr .

  that , or bethesda ignores every singly player who chose stormcloak and says that the empire won .

  if i remember correctly , tulius says something after killing ulfric about still being on the bad side of the thalmor .

  * america with 3 ice cream cones, 
  * switzerland and austria bouncing lichtenstein between them, 
  * japan perving on eesti,
