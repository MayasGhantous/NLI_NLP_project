  * greece searching for money, 
  that 's all i got . 
  also , prussia for some reason . 
  is n't one of the basic rules of making graphs that they have to begin at zero ? 
  well , bar graphs i mean . 
  i 'm sure i learned this in high school . 
  not necessarily , it could be 0-25 ,000,000 -50,000,000 -75,000,000 and so on . 
  i actually think i might have described it wrong now , but i 'm very sure that the way the above graph is presented is misleading . 
  the difference between amd and intel seems big , until you realize that the difference is only 1 unit . 
  the above could be 0-10-20-30-40-50-60-7-80 and the portrayal would be much more fair . 
  you can complete the game without killing anyone, 
  fuck dude , mark that, 
  source image ? 
   ranging from the military ( which wo n't carry out his ban on transgender people serving ), 
  all i 've heard about this is that the ban has n't actually taken effect yet and that trans people can still serve , for now at least . 
  have they phrased it wrong or did i miss something ? 
  i would appreciate a source if the latter is true, 
  you mean the reichskriegsflagge ? 
  the kriegsmarine was the german navy . 
  maybe the reason you ca n't comprehend it is because that 's not how it works .

  a * real * world heavyweight champion ? 
  what , does he take a handgun into the ring ? 
   why are there no hole-to-holes ? 
   or no blocks-to-blocks ? 
  because that would n't fucking work !, 
  that 's not how it works because they do n't immediately believe that hitler was right . 
  it starts with anti-semetic propaganda in some right-wing echochambers . 
  the bullshit escalates and once they 've swallowed the red pill \u2122 they `` realize '' that jews are `` evil '' . 
  it 's only at this point that they start to believe that hitler was right . 
  from this point on they start watching things like the greatest story never told and move to / pol / and the daily stormer , which achieves them full neo-nazi status .

  i 'm not agreeing or disagreeing , but this is simply virtue signalling, 
  last night i saw someone on / b / take out a $ 100,000 loan to bet on the fight . 
  thankfully , he bet on mayweather . 
  if i recall correctly , japanese love the spread of their culture . 
  if you 're a christian and you 're okay with everything in the bible , it 's not because you 're necessarily a bad person , but because you literally believe that god himself says it 's okay . 
  this makes me so uncomfortable, 
  fucking british tabloids, 
  those first three words in your comment fucked me up when i tried to say them aloud . 
  i just feel so sorry for this person . 
  their hands look destroyed . 
  are n't there more words in the english language that ignore this rule than follow it ?
