  maybe it could be fixed with one universal language or maybe just a calm willingness to dissect the problem but probably both . 
  problem is that the people of the world would n't give up their language for another and you ca n't really expect people to always be patient and calm instead of just saying `` you 're a faggot ! '', 
  i apologize for my earlier post . 
  yeah but he had slaves . 
  like , a fuckton of slaves . 
  if past lives are real , why does the human population increase ? 
  there are a vast majority more dead people than alive , so does that mean that as new souls keep being created each time you die you have to wait a longer amount of time to be reborn ? 
  'cause that 's fucking sad . 
  edit : thanks for over 100 up votes !, 
  i read a lot of comments and i think that the best thing we can all agree on is that with something as vast and incomprehensible as reincarnation , it 's probably best if we do n't try to comprehend it . 
  also , til not to post comments that could get a lot of comments to read . 
  thanks again . 
  wiping clean a whiteboard . 
  er , depends what you want yer human to do . 
  if ya want it to become a. . . a whatchamacallit , an ** apex predator ** , then probably that there neck . 
  too much reliance of blood gettin ' to yer noggin ' , see ? 
  also , no fur or claws . 
  i pride myself on my empathy . 
  you guys ever heard of nitrome ? 
  `` reddit has stopped . '', 
  it 's very early morning , so i do n't think it 's `` loudly eat baby carrots '', 
  true , but you ca n't honestly say that every poll , news report , and question wo n't be skewed towards hillary . 
  incredible . 
  reincarnation does n't make much sense to me with so many why 's , but i guess stuff just click with people . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  no one subscribed to this subreddit knows what phallic means . 
  wisdom is basically judgment . 
  this is the best answer . 
  however you read this in your mind . 
  that 's not reincarnation . 
  there are 7 billion people right now . 
  this number ** will ** grow . 
  where do these new souls come from ? 
  the dead outnumber the living drastically . 
  does the wait time to be reincarnated increase as time goes on ? 
  due to more and more dead people waiting to be reincarnated , of course . 
  what is mimbari ? 
  okay , good , cause honestly i was expecting some `` healing crystal '' bullshit . 
  what 's behind her ears is hair . 
  she 's a fucking neck beard . 
  democracy relies entirely on the majority of people being sane and decent . 
  i remember an ask reddit post that asked teachers about unreasonable parents and someone told the story of how the school was forbidden from giving philosophy classes because parents complained that the class was taking their children away from god . 
  nietzsche said this . 
  `` the surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently . '', 
  i guess what i 'm getting at is that all sides of every argument should be given at public schools . 
  you 're family is liberal ? 
  well here 's why some people are conservative . 
  your family is christian ? 
  well , that 's all well and good , but do you know the fundamentals of atheism ? 
  basically , let the kids assess everything . 
  raised christian and my parents tried to keep me from everything that they determined demonic . 
  look , my point is that many kids are raised on only one side . 
  teach about ethics . 
  teach that there are pros to the side everyone said is bad and * that 's * why there are so many people that like it . 
  not because they 're evil . 
  i say that if you only raise your kids on one side of any issue and then show them everything else , they can still say `` no thanks , that stuff 's just not for me . '', 
  here 's a metaphor . 
  if there are 100 ice cream flavours and for 18 years you are told that everything except chocolate is actually shit , you 'll never understand why people like anything else . 
  you 'll tell this to people and then they say `` oh , dude , you 've been lied to , here it 's really good '' then you 'll ** never ** want to look at things from their side because your whole life you 've been told it 's shit . 
  then again , if you * do * take that leap of faith , then maybe it 's your favourite , maybe it 's not , but you just learned that it 's not shit . 
  you go and tell your family the good news , it 's really * not * shit , but then suddenly they say you 've been brainwashed because you 've immersed yourself into that flavour because you 've been force fed chocolate ice cream your whole life . 
  maybe , even if you tried all 100 flavours chocolate would * still * be your favourite , but probably not , because there 's so much variety to choose from and all your life you 've ** only ** had chocolate fucking ice cream . 
  maybe you 'll never want to return to that bland , hellish chocolate ever again because there 's so much else and you 're just sick of eating it for so long , but in the end , ** it 's your family 's fault because that was the only thing you were allowed to experience **, 
  teach all sides of ever story to kids . 
  not letting them experience anything else will just break them because that which they were taught just was n't for them . 
  teach this in public schools everywhere . 
  golf balls ? 
  longest chain of bullshit i 've ever seen . 
  `` hey , i want to show you a video that i think is really important . '', 
  `` sure , what 's it about ? '', 
  `` genetic engineering and the moral implications that surround it . 
  it 's a quarter of an hour long . '', 
  inflation, 
  assuming the `` brain in a vat '' theory is wrong , making people 's lives better . 
  all civilizations , all people 's eventually die . 
  your life goal could be to become einstein cubed , but contributing to something that ultimately does n't matter should n't be what 's keeping you from suicide . 
  the goal you should have in life should be about the now and positively impacting people 's lives . 
  too many people have bad lives . 
  a lot of people do n't deserve it . 
  being nice to someone is n't monumental , but it 's good . 
  whether you notice someone 's new shoes or abolish an old , hateful law , everyone 's goal in life should be to improve the lives of others , ** but only should they accept it ** . 
  do n't push your beliefs on others . 
  that would impact their lives negatively . 
  too short , did n't tl ; dr. 
  notice how harambee has the golden bracelets around his wrists , they are n't bracelets , they are broken chains dicks out for harmbe, 
  one person in your group of friends , called the dm , lays out the skeleton of a story . 
  it is up to the rest of the group of friends , called individually a pc , to metaphorically and figuratively flesh it out . 
  the pc 's do this by pretending to be and acting as one of the main characters in the story . 
  they each decide what their own character does in any part of the story . 
  basically , it 's group story telling but played out as a game . 
  try gastrointestinalpains, 
  i think we 're like this because of how our brains developed during early human history . 
  tribe mentality and such , it 's easier to think of what makes us ** us ** than what makes them ** them ** . 
  nice, 
  i like the shape of the bowl . 
  all i see is a human candle . 
  why the fuck are are tl ; dr 's * alway * below the longer statement ? 
  fucking hell , stop this before it gets out of hand and into rick harrison 's pawn shop . 
  le guards , right here, 
  i found a theory some time ago that says that the clintons hired trump to become become the republican nominee and guarantee their victory .
