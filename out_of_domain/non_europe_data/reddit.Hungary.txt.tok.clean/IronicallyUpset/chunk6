  he spews bs the whole way through , but it turns out a lot of people actually support homophobia , islamophobia , and generally being cocks . 
  keep in mind that the clintons and trump have a history of friendship . 
  so you 're saying the mountain is surrounded by rocks and that 's putting him in a hard place ? 
  this is a good comment . 
  it has a good message . 
  it asks a good question . 
  but i implore you to change it . 
  what sounds better ? 
  `` fucking five children '', 
  `` five fucking children '', 
  please . 
  why does * anything * exist ? 
  why is there not instead nothingness ? 
  this is the question that convinced me that a god exists . 
  `` you 're not paying enough attention to my hair '', 
  this * is * pretty fucking shady . 
  seems to me that this might just be a single player game updating places and organisms with information from other peoples ' games . 
  protagonist , obviously . 
  an android that 's thinks he 's human has been deactivated for 42 years . 
  i want more, 
  a toll both * in space * ? 
  around the edge of the solar system ? 
  it is surely a shell of some kind ... 
  no , not really . 
  this ** was ** promised to be a multiplayer game although basically no one would ever meet another player . 
  that 's like promising if you buy a pair of shoes you 'll be entered in a lottery and there 'll be a 0.0000000000000000001 % chance of you winning ten thousand dollars . 
  sure , you should n't actually expect to win , but they lied their asses off about one of the most interesting parts of the game . 
  `` you 're joking right ? 
  i think it 's fairly obvious that ( candidate ) wants to -- '', 
  `` whoa dude , calm down '', 
  `` you 're a cunt . '', 
  i think it might have to be several hundred million invisible relatively gargantuan star destroyers that perfected faster than light travel , surely . 
  perhaps beings of several higher dimensions ? 
  that 's bad . 
  there should be equality . 
  nice mustache . 
  no man 's road, 
  bernie lost the nomination and he 's * still * making us proud . 
  touches inside the goal should n't count . 
  the shadow realm was just a euphemism for death . 
  fuck that . 
  right now , men have the advantage in ** many ** things . 
  are you saying that if you were a politician , you would try to have your gender reign supreme ? 
  are you saying that when we are seriously planning colonies on fucking ** mars ** , we ca n't stop thinking that everyone besides us is trying to figuratively/literally enslave the others ? 
  saying that you would marry someone all over again is basically saying that you 're content with being married to them . 
  if you were in a marriage and you would n't marry them all over again , that means you want a divorce or you * would * get one if circumstances were better . 
  so you basically finished off with `` i 'm content with my marriage . '', 
  itsafuckingjoke , checkmateanimekid420, 
  shavocado ? 
  you 're bad at this , having your mother be a virgin is possible . 
  ** im triggered **, 
  it enhanced the story and so it was allowed . 
  jumping to the moon is fucking stupid unless followed up by flawless imaginary magical game logic everyone agrees upon . 
  actually , that was a part of the show . 
  saying that it 's nice a kid has an interest in x. 
  and that 's also why you have -100 + points . 
  that 's fucking sad , man . 
  if immortality * does * become a thing , there should probably be a '' ** compulsory passing away date ** '' to solve overpopulation . 
  thinking 125 . 
  bonus , you get additional years added to 125 for services to humanity . 
  like , einstein 's bordering on 124 and he solves some big thing . 
  boom , ten extra years . 
  he works on great shit or he dies at 134 . 
  it probably speaks about my character , but immortality is fucking scary . 
  there will always be hitler 's , what happens when one is immortal ? 
  perhaps aging is slowed down drastically , but what if they escape to argentina or some shit ? 
  they can always try again . 
  overpopulation , we 're gon na be fucked by this . 
  if aging is just slowed down drastically , we probably wo n't have the resources to feed many people that will just multiply quicker and quicker . 
  as mentioned in the video , what about superhuman armies ? 
  what do we do there ? 
  chances are , we will ** not ** fully understand the human genome * perfectly * by the time we start fucking with babies . 
  or maybe we just * think * we do understand it to its fullest ? 
  what happens after 4 whole generations end up mutants when we overlook something ? 
  how will the 1 % react to immortality ? 
  what if the same group of people are leading humanity for generations ? 
  how will they use their wealth to exploit this ? 
  lastly , and most terrifyingly , what about human image ? 
  what about beauty ? 
  at least a small percentage of babies will be fucked . 
  they 'll become future mudbloods , not comparing to the physical and mental gods before them ? 
  how will the demigods perceive * themselves * ? 
  how will these abilities be abused ? 
  in the end , immortality will be the unmaking of the human race . 
  i pray to god that we only get slowed down aging . 
  other than that , the solutions will be mandatory passing away dates where you are killed by the government to accommodate overpopulation , awarded additional years for contributing to humanity so we do n't kill future einstein 's because `` thems the rules '' and most importantly ,, 
  ** mandatory fucking ethics classes ** where all sides of every issue is made clear . 
  stopping people from mass murderering because of * all these conveniently explained reasons * , etc. 
  in early human history , our brains developed tribe mentality . 
  it 's easier to think of what makes us * us * than what makes them * them * and so we demonize everyone with views different from ours ' . 
  do n't manipulate people , these are the goods and the bads of each political party , religion , law recently being passed , reddit post , etc. 
  and finally , just because you are more attractive , smarter , or stronger than someone , none of those things make you a kinder person . 
  these are the lessons we have to teach our kids . 
  guy seems nice . 
  he understands that this is a huge ordeal for the guy he robbed but he forgot to say sorry . 
  went back and got arrested . 
  now i kinda wish he would 've apologized and gotten away with it for a couple of days . 
  wait , since when do plants have genders ? 
  the gods ... 
  the gods are dead .
