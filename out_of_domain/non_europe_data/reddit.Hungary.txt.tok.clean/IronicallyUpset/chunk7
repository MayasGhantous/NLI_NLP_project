  like , * gastrointestinal pains * sick . 
  perhaps you could even call it ` ill ' . 
  very dedly , stay away , go to bed , browse dank memes , get better, 
  it was just a thing i realized . 
  you ca n't really convey tone over the internet so it might 've seemed like something else . 
  ** shrugs shoulders **, 
  jesus fucking christ , this is ** eli5 ** , not ** eliaf ** ucking ** a ** cademic ** p ** hilosopher ** w ** ith ** t ** enure ** a ** t ** ar ** espectable ** u ** niversity, 
  this reminds me of boku no hero academia , except the mc dreamed of being a superhero but was n't born with any powers , unlike 80 % of the planet . 
  enters superhero school , shenanigans ensue . 
  science says that experiences bring more happiness to people than objects , but fuck it . 
  that photo ca n't be real !,

  thanks for the `` too long ; would n't read '' . 
  thanks for the `` too long ; would n't read '' . 
  a continent ? 
  you can do whatever * you * want but it looks damn small to me . 
  multiply it by 4 or 5 . 
  create nations . 
  create other continents . 
  create cultures and people . 
  create a rich universe . 
  good luck !, 
  that might be nice , amassing armies and attacking undead legions . 
  how about pugnacious ? 
  yeah ? 
  then fucking do it . 
  show us a superior drawing of a penis , drawn by you . 
  you 're right , there 's nothing wrong with a small island or continent to start off with , but the proportions are fucking mental . 
  like , northeast corner there 's a castle surrounded by ** nothing ** . 
  like , 50 + miles of nothing . 
  and the forests ? 
  good god man , the relative sizes are fucking insane . 
  add more detail and i could believe that it 's a small to medium sized country , but a ** continent ** ? 
  virtually impossible indeed , but as a firm believer in the many worlds interpretation , it was bound to happen eventually to countless universes . 
  if so , then there are vast stretches of nothingness . 
  now that i look upon it again , it seems to me that if everything * is * to scale , then it might as well just be a fief , but under no reasonable circumstance can i believe that this is a continent or not to scale . 
  everything is fine really , except calling it a continent . 
  if it is a continent , then the scales are ` whack ' and if its not to scale , the vast stretches of nothingness require loads more detail . 
  fine , here 's your upvote . 
  you 've proven yourself . 
  i was browsing through reddit on my phone when i stumbled onto here so it really made me appreciate it more when it took multiple swipes to get through the scope of the story . 
  really , thanks . 
  did you know that at the very moment before something that has the potential to become a meme becomes a meme , it is instantaneously forgotten and never again mentioned alongside memes in the same sentence ? 
  oh my god , yes !, 
  i commented something along these lines earlier and someone say that if it went first , it would be a tl ; wr so i took their advice . 
  it seems that some people misinterpreted what i meant , so that 's a bit sad . 
  parents . 
  i expected porn to be a top comment , but that 's a good thing . 
  edit : i meant that it 's a good thing that it 's * not * a top comment . 
  i 've got fifty bucks on richard !, 
  maybe so . 
  i 'm only about half a month into reddit so there 's some stuff that just does n't make sense . 
  i guess i 'll become acclimated eventually . 
  holy shit !, 
  saved , shaved , and given a light trim off the top . 
  i have faith . 
  * taps up arrow *, 
  her : but , like , are we * on a date * ? 
  him : no , i told you , we 're on a * fig * . 
  that 's a nice fucking mustache . 
  as a being of the 4th dimension with a birthday across every measurable unit of time , i 'm triggered . 
  i thought his tongue was one of his chins for a minute . 
  is there any meaningful and long-term fix to robots taking human jobs ? 
  i bet at least , like , 15 people killed themselves . 
  was disappointed no one wrote anything . 
  idea , slow down . 
  why do you say that ? 
  you ca n't really convey tone over the internet , but i 'm not upset at all . 
  i 'd rather we prosper than them . 
  subscribing now . 
  so everyone says . 
  i 'm only a month in right now . 
  thanks , m80 . 
  `` what subject do you seriously not care about ? 
  that you will ** literally walk away from a person permanently if they show interest it in ** ? 
  child porn . 
  he 's probably not dead , knowing his story , but [ kevin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/219w2o/whos_the_dumbest_person_youve_ever_met/cgbhkwp ), 
  hold my diapers ( ? 
  ) , i 'm going in !, 
  thanks , m80 . 
  t'was a jhok . 
  i think they have a lot of fail safes for the stock market , probably a * lot * centered around no electricity . 
   how many people do you think rely on computers for their job ? 
  hint : a ** lot ** of them . 
  like 15 people ? 
  basic income will either be less than , or equal to/greater than the amount needed to survive . 
  if people do n't have to worry about work , why * should * they work ? 
  do all people in a country get the same amount of basic income ? 
  how is the amount of basic income given to a person/people decided ? 
  that 's very ... good . 
  but there might be a problem . 
  you see , i believe there are two kinds of jobs . 
  manual and mental . 
  any sufficiently advanced robot can build a skyscraper , but do robots have creativity ? 
  what happens when robots take all the manual labor ? 
  what about the people who do n't have what it takes to be a van gogh ? 
  i 'm your grandfather , rick harrison , and this is my elderly home . 
  my old man lived here and my son , big hoss , will too . 
  if there 's one thing i learned in 23 years , it 's that you never know what 's gon na come out of the barrel of a revolver and that a world without memes is n't worth living for .
