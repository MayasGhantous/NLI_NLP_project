  but it 's not that simple , in fact an intent to do one thing never equals to an intent to do some other thing , the latter could be only the consequence of the former . 
  you could argue that painting on it in itself is a crime , but if they say that 's not enough , one needs intent for it to be a crime , you need to prove that the intent was not creation but destruction . 
  i never heard of this before . 
  but at least they did n't change their official name unlike our government did here in the late republic of hungary . 
  sadly this is inevitable . 
  and not because it 's necessary but because terror has won . 
  and i 'm not talking about your stereotypical terrorists ' actions , they 're only the scapegoats , i 'm talking about the fear of the everyday violent criminal . 
  militarization in this case is not a response to a treat , it 's a response to fear , and it 's a fight in an already lost battle because the everyday criminal will respond in the same way , in turn there will be more militarization , and you have a feedback loop . 
  as others already said , this is hardly a fact . 
  ownership is something a lot more deeper than for example private funding which is actually possible . 
  so do the public police have private funding ? 
  yes , in some cases at least . 
  does it mean ownership ? 
  no , not even close . 
  does it mean influence ? 
  sometimes , but it 's limited by laws . 
  does it mean control ? 
  as long as the public police follow the laws which do n't allow a single entity to own or control them , no corporation owns or controls them . 
  stating that they do n't follow the law is not exactly a statement you can handle as fact if you do n't have proof . 
  not statistics , not circumstantial evidence , proof . 
  why announce this update ? 
  and why just a message , why not lock down the phone completely ? 
  that would convince everyone to take theirs back including those who keep them around only to demonstrate something on youtube . 
  nice thought , valid point , but people in power are too greedy in general so if robots take over jobs , a new caste system will born and eventually everyone rendered `` useless '' by automatization will die in poverty . 
  of course it 's really early to talk about such automatization , human workforce , in many cases increasing workforce will still be needed for at least a few decades after the ai they envision will be developed . 
  first 201 and now 101 . 
  thank you very much !, 
  i wonder how many of these protesters have actually voted . 
  but the first one should fail , why does it succeed ? 
  if the input is a string which just happens to be starting with numbers , how can c++ store a part of it in a variable declared as an int ? 
  should n't it see that the whole input is not an int and raise an error instead of cutting the input where the numerical characters end ? 
  i see . 
  so my mistake was not using std : : cin wrong but expecting it to work as something more complex . 
  thanks by the way !, 
  now i know what to look for to understand the iostream and how it differs from what i 've learned thus far . 
  wow . 
  thanks . 
  this is why you should never underpay your graphics designer . 
  i finished it literally a few minutes ago . 
  honestly , i have mixed feelings about it . 
  it does n't have plotholes but it feels that something 's missing . 
  and of course the ending hardly makes sense . 
  [ spoiler ] ( #s `` i mean after she killed jorge , it makes no sense that she can just go back to the world like nothing happened . 
  nobody noticed that someone who 's been missing for some time just reappears with e.g. 
  also even if she totally lost it as the final scene suggests and never went to a hospital and never reported to the police what happened , it 's impossible that nobody found it suspicious that her reappearance corresponds to the brutal murder of her husband and her neighbor plus her dna is all over the place next to some torture equipment in a room clearly made to hold someone captive . '' ), 
  the average does n't represent the conditions of the internet infrastructure of a country , in itself average does n't mean anything at all . 
  what 's the average of 1000 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 and 1 ? 
  about 91.82 . 
  that 's how average works . 
  i think this was a durex commercial . 
  nothing because not seeing or hearing anything , suffocating and not being able to move would n't be fun . 
  and with 1.19 my mouse cursor is stuck with its normal pointer , it wo n't change shape anymore ; no text select , no resize , no link select , only the standard pointer . 
  anybody else has this problem ? 
  the joke is good , very old but good . 
  but nsfw becaus ** e ** it implies menstruation or the lack of sex ? 
  wtf ? 
  this has to be fake news . 
  i ca n't even imagine a situation where a court gives an order to jail the victim and everybody just says `` okay '' and goes with it . 
  also after something like this there would be more than 7 google search results , at least every major news medium would have covered this globally and i 'm fairly sure the fbi would be investigating the case . 
  because i know that false news spread like wildfire these days and i 'm not gon na automatically believe something that 1. : is surreal and 2. : has no verifiable source ? 
  okay ... 
  no , this story is not about a sex crime , this is about crimes committed by legal authorities and law enforcement officers against a us citizen . 
  i may not know that much about us laws but i do know that that would be investigated at a federal level . 
  one word from that woman about what happened and the fbi would be all over the place , along with an armada of journalists . 
  yet the article implies that nobody 's being prosecuted even though the woman is suing and the evidence is self-explanatory . 
  again , this is not about the sex crime , this is about ... and i could only repeat myself . 
   the article ? 
  the nonexistent covering that certainly is n't there ? 
  what article ? 
  you said there was no voverage . 
  the article exists , only what they say is not true , or at least if something 's actually happened , it certainly has n't happened the way they claim . 
  believing everything you read online without questioning it even if it goes against any logic or sense is the true naivet\u00e9 . 
  pay no attention to that man behind the curtain !, 
  [ handcent next sms ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handcent.app.nextsms ), 
  that is perverted , in a weird way . 
  thanks , i included it in the original post . 
  i would n't mix `` impressiveness '' in here but we do count bytes instead of lines in actual it . 
  but even that comparison does n't mean much , 1 kib could be the equivalent of 10 kib if the language , the implementation and/or the coding style differs , not to mention redundancy , comments and unused/garbage code . 
  and how will they check it ? 
  predict that people will be likely to kill themselves and do nothing about it ? 
  because that would be the only test to determine if the algorithm works as they think . 
  so will this allow you to have sex whenever you choose or will she turn on once then wo n't even look at you for seven years ? 
  never buy devices from a third party . 
  that 's all . 
  even then you might want to flash a bootloader , recovery and system image from `` trusted '' sources . 
  i find it concerning that after such statement he 's allowed to stay in position . 
  either he 's been living under a rock for the past three decades or he 's a huge corrupt idiot . 
  maybe both . 
  nature 's escape artists . 
  all wes ** e ** n drink joy ? 
  it se ** e ** ms you 're not a grimm fan ... 
  belated ? 
  that depends where you are . 
  here it ended only 36 minutes ago . 
  what information ? 
  the hash created by the sensor when it scanned your fingerprint ? 
  that 's as valuable as a random string of characters . 
  i 'm certain that they wo n't build an optical scanner onto a bank card , and a capacitive scanner ca n't be fooled by a picture since it works only with skin and similarly conductive materials . 
  why not just implant the chip under the skin already ? 
  fingerprints are a lousy way to secure anything , you literally leave copies of them everywhere you go .
