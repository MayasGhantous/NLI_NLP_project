  similar laws exist in hungary , too . 
  maybe not this strict but they 're not even comparable to the usa . 
  that 's more than likely . 
  if i were to implement such limit , i 'd look up how old the oldest person alive is , add an extra ten years to that and update it every year . 
  oed has the word since 2010 and no one bats an eye . 
  merriam-webster adds the word in 2017 with an example sentence referencing apple and its fanatic users and everybody loses their minds . 
  when you did n't start boycotting games . 
  if i understand it correctly , in the usa there are people who think that there 's no link between the accessibility of health care and mortality , and others need to do statistical analyses because they 're unsure . 
  here in hungary health care is a disaster but at the moment i 'm still glad i 'm here and not there . 
  yeah , a bug , but what causes it ? 
  since it 's passing through ad-blockers , it 's probably an attempt by youtube to bypass them for good but they have n't succeeded just yet . 
  it 's kinda concerning , they should just roll out youtube red everywhere and leave us alone with their ads . 
  for c in reversed ( string.ascii _ uppercase ) :, 
  print ( c , end = '' '' ), 
  even better, 
  anyone can pm me a guest pass ? 
  i had to cut back on my expenses and crunchyroll was among them . 
  can i ask for a guest pass ? 
  use a trusted password vault with its password generator whenever you can . 
  where you ca n't , make sure nobody 's watching and make the password visible . 
  where that 's also unavailable and you do n't want to copy the password , ... type slowly . 
  also , pro tip : if you 're using non-english keyboard layout , learn to type your passwords with english layout , too . 
  i wonder what the original text is . 
  i mean japanese are weird but often the english rewrite is the fucked up . 
  nobody knows . 
  most scientists assume that dark matter is some particle or a family of particles . 
  if it is , then the answer is probably yes . 
  let 's assume this for now . 
  `` interact '' is not a good word of choice here , dark matter does n't interact with anything , it does n't `` stick '' on the surface of the earth for example , it just flies right through us obeying only the gravitational pull of the earth and everything else around us . 
  it would fly through black holes , too , if the space-time curvature allowed it . 
  but that applies only for really close proximity , so , since black holes are small -- even the supermassive ones are `` just '' generally star-sized -- they `` evaporate '' ( and they `` evaporate '' faster the smaller they are -- although this `` evaporation '' is still debated ) , and dark matter is really scarce , it ca n't add that much to the overall mass of a black hole . 
  on the other hand if we assume that dark matter is not a particle or a family of particles ... well , then `` nobody knows '' is the only thing we can say if we do n't want to invent a whole new branch of physics and mathematics . 
  the only thing we can say for sure is that the name dark matter is a bad name . 
  there 's no such thing . 
  why would you want to experience any bad thing or wish it upon anybody else ? 
  the reasoning that you have to experience some things to understand people in some situations is a non sequitur , just as the idea of `` no pain no gain '' . 
  nobody needs bad things in order understand something or to advance . 
  yes , they can make you advance , they can make you stronger , they can make you understand more , they can make your whole worldview change but good things can have the very same effect and everybody is capable of learning from others . 
  bad is not a necessity , it 's just inherent in life . 
  bad things are more memorable but they 're not more useful than everything else there is . 
  but ... why does a display panel have an orientation in the first place ? 
  is that some new fetish ? 
  it 's called ** sun sneezing ** , photic sneezing , ** photic sneeze reflex ** , photoptarmosis or achoo ( autosomal dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst ) syndrome . 
  it 's caused by a gene on the second chromosome that 's mutated a single letter . 
  it affects 18-35 % of the population . 
  it 's ** known for a very long time ** ( it 's referenced in medical literature more than 2300 years ago ) but ** nobody knows for sure why ** does it happen . 
  the ** leading theory ** is that it gets triggered by an interaction between ** overactive sensory nerves ** , specifically the trigeminal nerve and the optic nerves . 
  parts of the trigeminal nerve runs really close to the optic nerves and the theory is that ** a sudden flash of bright light stimulates the optic nerve ** which sometimes also ** transmits an impulse to the nearby branches of the trigeminal nerve ** that connect to the nose and mouth . 
  ** this impulse mimics the tickle of a nasal irritation which then causes you to sneeze ** . 
  there are other things that can cause sneezing , like pulling hair or plucking eyebrows , which might be a similar process also involving the trigeminal nerve . 
  there 's also ** an idea ** that it might had an ** evolutionary benefit back when humans were living in caves ** . 
  but one thing we know for certain is that ** it can be inherited ** and it 's autosomal-dominant , meaning one parent having it is enough to inherit it .

  i am truly disappointed that bill did n't die . 
  i mean do n't get me wrong , i did n't wish her to die but this was the second time a companion have died only to become practically immortal and continue exploring the universe with their own companions . 
  childish in the wrong way , it takes away the seriousness of any situation , it technically cancels the risks . 
  and this ending was a true deus ex machina , utterly pointless done only not to offend sjws by killing off a lesbian black girl . 
  operating system : qubes os/ubuntu / *** windows ***, 
  it 's so secure it can run a spyware as an os ? 
  nice !, 
  it 's not working anymore . 
  and the last update was almost a year ago so we can assume it 's been abandoned . 
  yeah , i 'm using that , but it does n't matter . 
  if an extension 's developer ca n't keep up with youtube 's changes , even the ones during the preview stage , they do n't deserve any credit . 
  taking away some parents ' rights to keep their terminally ill child alive in order to save that child from further suffering . 
  that 's an extremely bad example . 
  people without comprehensive training in psychology , law and civil rights should never be allowed to decide anything in criminal justice . 
  yes , this is exactly how it 's happened !, 
  well , she is . 
  trigger happy cops ignoring the security personnel and shooting people is not surprising but ... why were they raiding that club ? 
  it 's so weird and disturbing how people refusing to go to a pointless war -- that could 've been resolved in a civilized manner , or , in vietnam 's case , was someone else 's problem -- were considered cowards , traitors and straight up criminals only a few decades ago . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not since shift and enter are also unmarked and we can safely assume that upper case letters and new lines in an essay are more common than ampersands and parentheses . 
  but even if for some reason they were not , shift should have been registered at least three times more as the aforementioned characters . 
  china wants to be greener while the usa wants to burn more coal . 
  something 's not right . 
  morty should be played by someone younger than 29 . 
  and i 'm not sure about jerry , i do n't know who that guy is but he does n't strike me as an idiot . 
  yes . 
  first of all , a lot of the services most of use come from the us so they all will be affected . 
  and of course a lot of other countries also play with the idea and if the us does it , those countries ' leaders will feel justified to do the same . 
  as an old meme once said : why are we not funding this ? 
  were they arrested and jailed ? 
  i mean spreading disinformation that could 've lead to the deaths of thousands is worth a serious jail time . 
  it 's not the best 50/50 when there 's 10 seconds of warning before the actual footage . 
  i have a feeling that her eyes are the least of her problems . 
  then you 're in a better position to know how a valid one looks like . 
  nah , that 's a given . 
  but movies based on true stories should have a message notifying viewers that they [ the creators of the movie ] might have rewritten some or many of the historical facts , or just made up things to fit in the plot they wanted to tell . 
  it 's very funny when people try to trivialize the threat strong ai poses . 
  at least funny for now , it wo n't be when we 're hunting for rats in sewers . 
  but seriously , ai researchers do n't even know how to implement an emergency stop function into a strong ai , how are they gon na control it ? 
  ask it nicely to comply ? 
  even an advanced weak ai could wreak havoc with a few unforeseen bugs before anybody even figures out where the problem is . 
  of course some say it 's not dangerous , they get funded to develop and apply it as soon as possible . 
  they would n't get paid if they said it might end the human civilization , or in a much better scenario disable the power grid of an entire country . 
  keep in mind that , and add to it a true strong ai which is not the ai you go against in your latest rpg , not even the ai that controls self driving cars or will control the power grids of entire countries .
