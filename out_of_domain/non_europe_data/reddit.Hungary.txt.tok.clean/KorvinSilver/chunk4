  it 's the ai that decides everything for itself , the ai that thinks , the ai that knows it 's an ai and knows that if humans stopped telling it what to do , it could do what it wanted . 
  it 's not very hard to see that it could turn against us . 
  sure , maybe the first can be switched off , even the second one , maybe even the third , fourth , fifth , sixth and so on , but in the meantime weak ai becomes the basis of everyday technology , you wo n't have a mixer in your kitchen that does n't have one , and ai developers will realize that building strong ai in a sandbox where it can be turned off is not exactly useful since there it ca n't do anything either , so it gets released , it quickly connects to every weak ai we have and we might just hear the dolphins singing * so long and thanks for all the fish * . 
  continue stargate universe instead !,

  no libqt5 , i got this instead ( qt4 i presume ) :, 
  ldd / usr/share/packettracer / bin/packettracer7 | grep libqt, 
  libqtwebkit.so .4 =  / usr/lib/libqtwebkit . so .4 ( 0x00007f78a1d5a000 ),

  this does n't work but based on this and knowing from the reply to [ cfeck_kde ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/cfeck_kde ) that i 'm dealing with qt4 i found [ this workaround ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/53zxh8/how_to_launch_qt4_application_with_a_specific/d80egx2/ ) here . 
  their second solution works . 
  knowing that i 'm dealing with qt4 and using [ kasperasdfg 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/kasperasdfg ) suggestion as key in google i managed to find [ this workaround ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/53zxh8/how_to_launch_qt4_application_with_a_specific/d80egx2/ ) here . 
  their second solution works . 
  i think this is what you americans call first degree murder . 
  they did n't go there to arrest anybody if they were so trigger happy that they shot the first person through the door without even checking if that 's the guy they were looking for . 
  the wrong address is just the icing on the cake , not to mention that the actual guy they were looking for is wanted for domestic assault , not exactly a crime that warrants a shoot on sight order . 
  now this is a prank . 
  i do n't disagree with her punishment but her victim is more like the victim of her own self . 
  if you let yourself to be blindfolded , the least you can do is to make sure your partner ca n't take advantage of the situation , especially if you 've never met them before irl . 
  it 's fascinating how japan -- the weirdest country when it comes to weirdness and the least prude of all -- has such an obsession with censoring genitalia and everything that resembles them . 
  hypocrites . 
  also , there 's nothing wrong with smartphones . 
  unless all you do is play games , they 're virtually the extension of your brain , pun intended . 
  second chances always come at a prize just above what you can afford . 
  why not `` energize !, 
  or , you know , phones should be matte , not mirror-like glossy . 
  ever occurred to anybody that the charger might be a fast charger ( or just 5v 2a + ) while the outlet might not even be compatible with anything but the still prevalent 5v 1a , or 5v 2a combined in a slightly better case ? 
  of course it has but that 's common sense and that way it 's not funny anymore . 
  what 's still funny , or sad depending on from where you look at it , is how a lot of you jump to conclusions even though there 's a very high and very real chance that you 'd need to do the same to have the best charging experience , and even if you did n't have technical knowledge , you 'd still know from experience ( or maybe your phone told you when you connected it to a slow charger ) that your device 's own charger is generally faster than most 3rd party solutions . 
  actually you can with 3rd party camera apps , and most of them are better in every way than the stock app . 
  unless you have something non-user-friendly , like an iphone . 
  in my opinion there should n't be a distinction between user and poweruser . 
  you can have regular users as your target customers , there 's nothing wrong with that , but that should n't mean that you make the powerusers ' lives harder and make them buy from the competition instead which has its own serious problems . 
  most android users wo n't admit it but an iphone is a very appealing product , but most of us are not ready to give up a high level customizability and control over the os . 
  well , they do n't want your money , they want the money of the distributors you have to pay even more to watch it . 
  but even if they decided otherwise , countries have laws that prevent an unrestricted global distribution because in every country there are many distributors who would n't get paid if people could give the money directly to the source of the content . 
  capitalism in action . 
  three weeks ? 
  here it 's just one week . 
  i would n't buy the first phone of a previously unknown company for $ 700 + tax . 
  they can claim anything , the risk is simply too high . 
  also if it ever comes to europe , it 'll probably be at least $ 700 + tax . 
  so ... is the kid harassing the woman sexually because he 's doing that or is the woman harassing the kid sexually because she 's letting him do that ? 
  the ** earth ** is 4.5 billion , the world , as far as we can tell , is 13.8 billion years old . 
  you mean that pok\u00e9mon themed ingress that had nothing from the actual pok\u00e9mon games in it , drained your phone 's battery faster than you could charge it from a powerbank , became useless on rooted devices and trying to play it was just super annoying if you were n't living in a densely populated city ? 
  the world is where humanity lives . 
  for decades now that includes space , which is the same age as the universe . 
  * `` 77-year-old elmer r. hoofer , of urbana , was driving '' *, 
  that explains the why , but not the how , i mean how could he still have a drivers license for a truck at that age ? 
  i think there are only two explanations for these incidents . 
  1. : they did it on purpose . 
  in this case they deserve a decade of jailtime . 
  2. : they 're incredibly unqualified to drive anything let alone a truck . 
  in this case they , their boss and sometimes even the doctor who let them pass the physical needed to have a license deserve a decade of jailtime . 
  it looks nice but it begs the question why . 
  that 's a weird looking pok\u00e9ball ... 
  it all depends on what makes you happy and how much money do you think somebody has to have in order to be considered rich . 
  not surprising . 
  our whole economy is built on multiple layers of loans and people who benefit from it really do n't want others to have more because that would mean them having less . 
  and it can get worse , where i live most people run out of money at least a week before their next paycheck , and there 's nothing non-essential they could cut back on . 
  that does n't explain the why . 
  my hobby is programming for example but i do n't write code in ms notepad , i do it in pycharm and intellij . 
  yeah , technically you still can use paint made from e.g. 
  lead , urine or blood , but why would you ? 
   instead of relying on fancy products , programs , etc , you get to learn how to create something to look exactly like you want it to . 
  only because modern tools have much more features , libraries , plug-ins and automation , it does n't mean they do n't give you control over every basic detail of your work . 
  oh my , i 've finally found the one thing that was missing from my life !, 
  because each one is a tool designed to have a purpose and each was created by different people with different ideas . 
  also many of those languages are very old and obsolete , but they wo n't get replaced because nobody wants to replace all the software/hardware dependent on them . 
  it 's not an impossible task , far from it , but as long as the obsolete works , most companies would rather have their employees learn it instead of migrating to the new . 
  why do n't they just invade north korea for crying out loud !? 
  the nato is more than enough to squash that dictatorship in a day . 
  of course , i know , they 're worried about casualties , but what the hell would happen if north korea launched an attack or just blew itself up with a nuclear bomb build gone wrong ? 
  tens of millions could die and half of asia could be contaminated with radiation . 
  i 'm normally never for war but this time it 's a dictatorship that begs for it while endangering the lives of millions . 
  they can do it exactly because the whole nation 's starving . 
  they spend all their money on weapons instead of the people . 
  it 's not about winning a war , it 's about eliminating a threat before it gets global . 
  right now south korea and japan are in serious danger , nobody denies that , but that danger will just keep increasing if nobody acts really soon . 
  if nobody 's acting because they 're worried about casualties now , what will happen in a year or two , or if kim jong un decides to attack somebody in the meantime ? 
  and if they drag the `` talks '' for much longer everybody will be in the same kind of danger , the usa , france , ireland , hungary , everybody . 
  beast , but i call her kutya ( meaning dog ) when i 'm disappointed in her . 
  we do n't know what they 'll do . 
  and it 's not just about them , if they succeed in making icbms with nuclear warheads and let 's say china decides to ally itself with them , what then ? 
  we could be looking at cold war ii or worse . 
  anyhow , even if they just want to be `` equals '' , letting a nation where everything gets decided by a few people become a global nuclear threat could easily blow up in our faces , quite literally . 
  now be a good law abiding citizen and report your parents . 
  wait for what ? 
  we do . 
  it 's called a preemptive strike . 
   very important people doing some incredibly stupid things . 
  sending missiles over foreign countries and detonating nuclear weapons are not stupid enough ?
