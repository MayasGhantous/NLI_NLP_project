  also , china is not that dissimilar from north korea , they 're just a lot bigger so they ca n't afford to be a full-fledged dictatorship and threaten the west this way . 
  that 's why they supported them in the past and will do so in the future . 
  kaw kaaww colored mud can not fool us kaaawwww you filthy mudman kaw kaww !, 
  i 'm joe * investment development and research analyst * and this is my buddy jack * waste management and disposal technician * . 
  i do n't think transporter data is public unless it 's made public by starfleet hq and the federation council . 
  also , transporter data of humanoids could be used in various illegal ways , like creating bioweapons or genetic engineering research with the purpose of augmentation ( which is not just illegal but also feared by humanity ) . 
  i highly doubt that they 'd risk the data falling into the wrong hands only to satisfy a marginal curiosity of a few individuals . 
  they 'd just send anybody with such ideas to counselling . 
  they probably could n't hide it either , although we do n't see much about the life outside starfleet , from what we know about the technology we can assume that people do n't have much privacy even if they do n't join . 
  they certainly do n't have any if they do even though it 's been stated multiple times that starfleet is not a military organization . 
  i think it does record a very detailed information . 
  in the tng episode lonely among us , picard becomes non-corporeal so they have to reconstruct his body using stored data in the transporter . 
  of course they explain the problem of creating something that 's alive away by having the transporter assemble only the physical body and merging it with energy , but still , they effectively reconstructed a person 's every molecule from stored information and not from an incoming beam . 
  later in the episode unnatural selection , we see the transporter used to restore the bodies of the researchers and pulaski after a virus had altered their genes and accelerated their aging . 
  they even make it an issue that pulaski did n't trust transporters so there was no readily available genetic information of her at first until they find a hair follicle . 
  that basically implies that they can extract the same information from the transporter logs as from actual cells . 
  ironically though this is the episode where they do experiment with genetic enhancement which should be illegal . 
  and i think i do n't even have to mention tuvix . 
  i can only imagine what the passersby were thinking . 
  where 's the joke ? 
  the universe is expanding because spacetime itself is expanding . 
  that does n't mean though that the fabric of spacetime is stretching itself , what it basically means that only the distance between large objects are affected at the moment . 
  a so called dark energy drives this expansion . 
  it 's called that because we ca n't detect it directly , we know only about it thanks to its effect . 
  we do n't actually know if it 's an energy either , whatever definition of energy we might use . 
  as neil degrasse tyson jokingly said we 'd be better off calling it wilma instead of dark energy . 
  ( he said a similar thing about dark matter which according to him should be called fred . ), 
  now , dark energy appears to be the opposite of gravity , maybe it is gravity acting in a way we never anticipated before . 
  gravity is the weakest of the fundamental forces , much weaker actually than the rest ( i.e. 
  electromagnetism , weak force and strong force ) . 
  while gravity holds together solar systems , galaxies , galaxy clusters and so on , the other forces hold together * `` objects '' * , molecules , atoms , and subatomic particles like protons and neutrons . 
  this basically means that objects like planets and stars are unaffected at the moment by the expansion of the universe . 
  and by `` at the moment '' i do n't mean that dark energy might overtake the other three fundamental forces in strength , it 's just simply that in a very long time after stuff break down into smaller and smaller chunks , everything will be so far away that those interactions stop happening due to their short distance limitations . 
  so no , planets , stars , and celestial objects are not increasing in size because of dark energy , the elementary forces on the small scale are simply way too strong and dark energy might not even have any effect on the small scale . 
  because that could work ... 
  arch ? 
  difficult ? 
  you must be doing something terribly wrong if you think that . 
  interesting how you got slightly different wording than me :, 
   today 's tv is unpublished 14th episode `` valentine , and onsen !, 
  please do not expect too much ) '' is a preview screening !, 
  everyone in the human world , thank you !, 
  you do know that it 's called theater mode because it centers the video and removes everything from the sides , like if it was a theater screen , do n't you ? 
  obviously the left . 
  but a regular one standing right in front of mimikyu would turn into an exact copy . 
  an experienced one could do that from memory as well . 
  now , the ditto having problems with copying would get the details wrong which is n't necessarily the actual face of a pok\u00e9mon or anything else for that matter , it can be any detail they ca n't recall or mimic properly ( face , ears , tail , fur , color , etc ) . 
  in the anime and tcg we see this particular problem with the face only because that 's the most obvious . 
  anyway , ditto would copy mimikyu 's disguise , so if it got the face wrong , it 'd be the face on the disguise . 
  no , the left one since ditto would copy the disguise not the actual mimikyu under it . 
  that 's a simple game design choice . 
  it 's easier if the ditto learns the moves of its opponent right away than waiting for it to see the moves , and of course transform would be a very disadvantageous move if you could n't use your opponent 's moves only after it uses them . 
  smartphone 's fingerprint sensor : front or back ? 
  what 's more convenient to you , what do you think makes more sense : having a smartphone 's fingerprint sensor on the front or on the back of the device ? 
  or maybe on its side ?

  moral of the story :, 
  a wet pussy makes a cock feel good . 
  on the home screen there are a million ways to do it but i 've yet to find any that works on the lock screen . 
  today i found apps last updated last year , one being the `` sb wallpaper changer '' , the other the `` image 2 live wallpaper '' . 
  both promise they can do it , they allow to set separate landscape and portrait lock screen wallpapers but none of them work . 
  i 'm assuming it may have worked more than a year ago with lollipop but marshmallow may work differently . 
  as for other possibilities ... 
  i always get back to this issue several times a week hoping that maybe i find something but it seems like nobody is even working on this , i 'm using cyanogenmod 13.1 and not even its developers know how to do this . 
  is there any way to achieve this ? 
  not necessarily an app , i 'm perfectly fine with modifying system configuration files . 
  or maybe i ca n't find a solution not because nobody cares to make it happen but because google made sure nobody can ? 
  rhetorical question : why did modern day smartphones become so dumb ? 
  i remember way before the first iphone and htc dream were a thing , i used many pdas and smartphones and there were devices that could do this without any 3rd party app or system hack . 
  so i 'm searching for an answer since yesterday but could n't find anything . 
  it 's hard to describe it exactly , maybe that 's why i ca n't find not just a solution but not even the problem itself . 
  when i first noticed this in c++ , i thought it 's some bug in my code but i think it was n't . 
  here 's the problem :, 
  int main ( ), 
  int a , b ;, 
  cin  a ; / / let 's say i input 123abc . 
  there will be no errors !, 
  cin  b ; / / it does n't ask for an input here , but puts the zero in the next available spot ( so i see 1230 here but in the code i noticed this the next variable became 0 ) and returns the exit code 0, 
  return 0 ;, 
  i tried the same in python :, 
  a = int ( input ( ) ) # input 123abc and got valueerror , that 's ok . 
  so , what 's going on with c++ ? 
  why does n't it raise an error like python ? 
  note : i 'm already familiar with python but i started learning c++ only now from necessity , previously i never used it . 
  edit : based on rhomboid 's comments i found out that std : : cin simply does n't work in a way i was expecting it so there 's only user error here , but i found what i needed [ here ] ( http://www.lb-stuff.com/user-input ) . 
  i started using clion a few days ago . 
  it 's very good but i ca n't understand a few of its inspections . 
  one of those are the `` statement can be simplified '' in this case :, 
  if ( stringone = = stringtwo ), 
  return true ;, 
  else return false ;,
