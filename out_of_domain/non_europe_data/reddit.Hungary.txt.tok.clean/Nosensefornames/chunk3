  yeah , but this is the non-alcoholic almdudler , not almradler , is n't it ? 
  try it mate it 's very good . 
  i 'm not much of a quenya expert , but i think you did a great rendition  elvish is so beautiful !, 
  tolkien really had a great phonoaesthetic sense . 
  and you too !, 
  check out his other paintings too !, 
  roerich knew the cultures of eurasia very well . 
  he made a painting about almost everything : from the nibelungs to the tibetan monks . 
  his works ( especially the way he painted mountains ) are so beautiful that h. p. lovecraft often uses them as an example of eldritch beauty in his books . 
  how does this relate to anything here ? 
  i like the gift of death conception in the sil . 
  when i first read the silmarillion , i was 13 years old . 
  reading about the gift of desth , i was like `` thanks il\u00favatar , what a great gift / s '' , but as the number of my years grows ( and as i delve ever deeper into the works of tolkien ) , i really began to understand how big this gift is . 
  also , i heard that even though tolkien implemented many christian ( especially catholic ) elements in his works , some theologists and priests disagreed with his gift of death concept . 
  could somebody explain this topic for me ? 
  there are enough depraved hungarians , why do sex tourists have to increase their numbers ? 
  anyway , prostitution here is illegal . 
  edit : i looked at his comment history , and his last comment is asking how easy it is to get weed in hungary . 
  thank you for your answer !, 
  i 'll most certainly read it then . 
  is n't the french revolution book called * diamond necklace * ? 
  we also have that ( i have a feeling that one of my predecessors was a carlyle fan ) . 
  thank you for the anwer . 
  i love romanticism as a movement , so the romantic style wo n't be a problem for me . 
   absurd muddlehead, 
  yeah , sounds like nietzsche, 
  a thicc boiii, 
  what rhetoric ? 
  i do n't hate romania or the romanians for having transylvania , but if i had the slightest say in it , i would provide authonomy , even independence for those who want it . 
  i also find it ironic for romanians to be distrusting of somebody . 
  i mean , was it hungary who always switched sides during the two world wars ? 
  i did n't think so either . 
  even though i think that some parts of the trianon treaty ( for example south-transylvania ) were absolutely right , i still find other parts outrageous , antidemocratic , inhumane , barbaric and simply non-european . 
  how would you feel if places with over 90 % romanian population would be * stolen * from your country ? 
  how would you feel if instead of a country with inudstry , sea trade , rich wood resources , rich mines etc. 
  you 'd only have a shitty plane left , where even damned grass is unable to grow ? 
  sorry if this came out angry , i just find it outrageous , that some people think hungarians should just `` get over '' the biggest tragedy of their nation . 
   most people stop reading nietzsche when they turn 16, 
  genuinely curious , why do you say this ? 
  perfect women do n't exi ... 
  pls do n't roast me , i 'm not very familiar with japanese salaries , just stumbled upon this post . 
  is it too high , or too low ? 
   childish fantasy, 
  lol, 
  just curious : in what situation did you admit it ? 
  were you like stoned when you got home , and they would have guessed it anyway , or what ? 
  harry potter is a damned disgrace to the whole genre of fantasy . 
  you are right , it 's not a children 's book , it 's pyre material . 
  right hand to god i checked , but i have n't found it . 
  now i think i 'm retarded ( and probably others think it , too ) . 
  thank you sir . 
  wow , do n't even mention him . 
  it was a shame how he carried on ... 
  ama ? 
  i do n't really know the mechanics of an ama , so i do n't really know . 
  i think the subreddit does n't forbid it . 
   resistance to islamic immigration . 
  this fact alone would make me vote for them forever . 
  i think you forgot saint ellen isle, 
  no trust the oranggg, 
  one of the main topics of philosophy is trying to prove or disprove the existence of god , so if you want to study philosophy , you should n't have walked away . 
  platon ( who certainly was n't a christian fundamentalist ) created the first arguements to prove the existence of a creator ( * demiurgos * ) . 
  later christian philosophers ( who contributed to the developement of western humanities and science greatly ) , like aquinas , saint augustine or anselm only continued the greeks legacy . 
  unfortunately , the debate about god became a bloody **** storm between atheist fanatics and christian zealots , although it was discussed among the highest intellectuals even 100 years ago . 
  you should n't be so quick to condemn religion , and christians should n't condemn science , since christianity in the middle-ages was the only driving force behind scientific developement . 
  europe . 
  the church founded all ( and i mean all ) universities in the early middle ages . 
  most scientists in that time were priests or monks . 
  ( afaik this was very similar in the muslim world that time ), 
  soros, 
  where can we see breton food in skyrim ? 
  [ removed ], 
  obviously , my post contains spoilers . 
  so , i 've been reading some reviews about ` san junipero ' ( s3e4 ) . 
  most people seem to think that the episode has a happy ending . 
  they even point out how unusual this is for a black mirror episode . 
  i do n't really share this opinion . 
  when i finished , i thought that the episode was n't simply dark , but it was even darker than usual , and the light soundtrack and scenery at the end only made it worse ( not in the sense of enjoyment , but of mood ) . 
  since this is black mirror , we can come up with many interpretations , but my 3 main ending versions are all depressive , and dark . 
  ** 1 : simulation **, 
  so , we saw , that real , living people can connect to the world of san junipero . 
  but what if the dead ones are just simulations ? 
  what if yorkie , after she had `` gone over '' was just a perfect copy of her previous consciousness , but definitely not the same ? 
  i said , perfect , because she is definitely capable of the same level of thinking , feeling , and sensation as her real counterpart , however , the `` real '' consciousness of yorkie is dead . 
  the real buzzing-beeping-soul-thingies at the end seemed more electronic than biotic , suggesting that they are simply machines . 
  in this sense , this technology is similar to the one in s2e1 , be right back . 
  ** 2 : falling into decadence **, 
  so , if we accept , that the * real * consciousness of people lives on in this `` earthly heaven '' , they are condemned to eternity . 
  kelly even suggests , that slowly , they will become like the people at the quagmire ( i think that was the name ) . 
  this problem is similar to the one of developed nations : because of the problem-free life we are able to lead nowadays , some of us over time fall into a state of debauchery , and of decadence , a state when even the extremities are unable to satisfy us . 
  i think this is the worse sccenario , and the most alarming for us . 
  ** 3 : moral failure **, 
  so , the previous two points were made considering my observations , and this one is heavily influenced by my personal point of view , so please , feel free to disagree . 
  if we reject my first two theories , we may think , that heaven indeed is a place on earth , and it is called san junipero . 
  however , in this scenario , the greatest gift of humanity is taken away : our mortality . 
  we define our lives because of the prospect of the inevitable death . 
  art , science , philosophy , everything we ever created is deeply woven together with our nature as mortals . 
  if mortality is lost , we are lost as species . 
  if , in the future , we become immortals , we must redefine ourselves , and i really think this would mean ceasing to be human creatures . 
  furthermore , when kelly chose to live in this `` paradise '' , she rejected to share the fate of his family .
