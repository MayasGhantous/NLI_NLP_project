  because i was let to choose between beign religious or not religious and when i was about 16-17 i was really interested in this topic and began researching . 
  and i found out all the religious `` fairy tales '' can be debunked with basic logical thinking . 
  i dont think / r/atheism is a place for peace and love and sometimes science .

  i rather use the term `` they ran out of juice '' its old but its more true than `` they tilted so hard '', 
   but wc4 = the mmo ? 
  ftfy, 
  you lose !, 
  people this game will be made for hardcore gamers not for casuals . 
  the game locks your account . 
  this game will not be made for casuals who grow up on games which hold the players hand throughout the game and saves the gamestate every 5 seconds . 
  this is the real hardcore shit right there ... too bad the hackers will ruin it very fast :(, 
  jedi knight : jedi academy, 
  i just checked my email and under the promotions tab i got an email from blizz !, 
  aaaannndd its a blizzcon ad ... why blizzard ? 
  why you have to hype me up then crush my hopes like this ? 
  i know it should be comfortable but can you tell me little bit more specifics than that ? 
  thanks !, 
  can confirm this game will be p2w with p2p with a monthly subscription + dlc + season pass and blizzards gon na place a overwatch-o-meter on your internet and will charge you extra if you play more than 1 hour a day . 
  oh and a heart of a baby born in fullmoon yearly . 
  `` blizz folded on the reddit beta-begging thread and gave all of them access '', 
  hold on a sec . 
  did they really gave access to the beta beggars ? 
  hold my everything im going full hobo mod !, 
  `` elevation would n't add anything to the game but confusion '', 
  dude its not rocket science , people will figure it out really easily . 
  and it gives some mechanics like you can jump off the cliff but obviously you cant climb back . 
  or a well used gust you can throw people down and hook back one of them . 
   fuck that fuck you bud . 
  ftfy, 
  im not even interested in playing this game . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) thats my fetish ( \u0361 ~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  if mccree 's cigar is removed im not interested in the game anymore . 
  yessss im so glad i can pay for this game to play !, 
  im not joking !, 
  less hackers and botters , less toxicity , more available game content . 
  b2p is one of the best parts of this game . 
  * look out for that bastion buster !, 
  they are working to release this game for console plebs thats also takes time . 
  so ... deadpool ? 
  code-a is-a made-a best-a spaghetti !, 
  pasta recipe is-a riot-a secret-a !, 
  wow just wow . 
  this is more shamless ripoff than the tf2 ripoff ( final combat ) . 
  the game isnt even complete and a company already copy it . 
  welp , it 'll be a good overwatch demo if it comes out sooner . 
   they 're testing how stressed we get when we lose access after 3 days not being able to play the game at all because the servers are completely lagged out . 
  ftfy, 
  cant see stitches on the wallpapers . 
  i rate these thrash out of 10, 
  hold my bitches , im goin in !, 
  fun fact : your brain makes emotional decisions faster than logical if you are under heavy emotions ( tilt ) .
