  no . . just no . 
  even lenny is disgusted . 
  it looks like a meme from the `` wrong part of the internet '' . 
  it 's too late u/nathanmufcfan i 've seen everything . 
  its a cosplay duuhhh ... 
  suddenly that stupid comic isnt funny anymore . 
  when i play in soloq/yoloq yeah that bothers me but when im with a premade we can think and discuss more what should we do next . 
  got your nose !, 
  yep this is one of those threads in this subreddit that im saving , thanks man . 
  actually the 60 tick rate is just turned off and thats why the game doesnt recognize you on the point if you try to contest it in the last second . 
  edit : failed memeing :( thought the comment above me is a ds3 reference . 
  i didnt see godlike plays , it was good but not godlike . 
  tho his positioning is really good throughout the video . 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : this ^ ^ ^ opinion ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ based ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ video . 
   the ea equivalent of it . 
  oh my , the horrors they could have done . 
  it might take too long to try it out especially in koth . 
  the shiniest meat bycicle, 
  i would love cl4p-tr4p from bl-tps . 
  them random ultimates . 
  edit : but kreig is basically genji right ? 
  shooting something then ulting with a powerful melee, 
  maybe it 's maybelline, 
  i hope he comes back for voice acting green jesus . 
  spreading quality gifs to everyone to fight against tumblr gifs . 
  it was worth it !, 
  and she drinks *** applejuice ***, 
  oh no our only shame is showing !, 
  i regret opening this post . 
  so say mr. human , how do you pronounce it ? 
  dont worry bro i too didnt understand that . 
  i thought he was referencing to those two black lines below the yellow glowing dots . 
  thats lots of big `` ifs '' for a `` maybe '' . 
  im not sure why but my f10 leaves a `` cyka blyat rush b '' in the chat . 
  i like this , i really like this theory . 
  forbidden sun ; i want the name , the damage , the ridiculous casting speed . 
  i made so many combos using that spell ... 
  now im double disappointed . 
  pick roadhog , break the shield from cover , hook bastion . 
  keep calm and rek everyone . 
  well maybe you could buy ddos protection . 
  but its like buying protection from the maffia so they wont attack you . 
  but hey , look at the bright side !, 
  you can gain rating much easier now . 
  come on and slam, 
  looks like for you the only winning move is not to play . 
  you know if you cant handle the heat stay out of the kitchen . 
  at least for a while . 
  playing tilted is really bad for your performance . 
  [ * where are my testicles summer ? 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piriivcjuks ), 
  well , somehow i doubt it or you include companies into it . 
  ohh you just wait till blizz show us something insignificantly small detail about sombra we didnt know about . 
  this entire sub and everyone including you will lose their collective feces . 
  its really not that bad as you guys saying ... really . 
  ofc there are leavers rarely but it happens on both sides and actually your enemy have more chance to have a leaver if you are not leaving games . 
  and again , its rare . 
  the dog is blind, 
  well , we will work with what we have . 
  and that monster just became even more goofier . 
  does the animation cancel work if you pin someone or hit the wall ? 
  we tried that in qm and we also gave torb a mercy dmg boost . 
  the result was a dwarf one shotting reinhardt . 
  ( not the shield ), 
  use short and very basic english words with good pronunciation and without accents if possible . 
  better if you use words they might have heard while playing the game . 
  ( change , kill , behind , fucking hanzo , pls , please , what etc etc ), 
  but sadly i know lots of people who cant even count to 10 in english , but the higher you climb the more and better people will speak english . 
  i would be glad if the game would put everyone in team chat by default . 
  im so tired of saying and asking nicely everyone every game to get in team voice chat . 
  well memed . 
  damn you now i have to find a new `` oddly ... right '' combination !, 
  i agree , i mostly played mobas ( dota2 , league , hots ) so when i came to ow i reached rank 62 in the first season without fps background . 
  because of mobas i already knew the basics ( the very basics ) of this game while anyone else didnt . 
  man it was so annoying to say almost exactly this multiple times per game : `` group up please , dont fight them alone they outnumber you and will kill you , lets go together '' and other stuff . 
  nowdays a simple `` group up pls '' is enough . 
  cant wait untill i dont have to say anymore ; `` join voice chat pls '', 
  edit : some words, 
  and we upvote this prejudice ? 
  its ... not ... that gay , but yeah this show is an lgbt fest . 
  i dont believe you . 
   he educates us on the ways of the bradstion, 
  like the `` just another day of ethnic cleansing . '', 
  cat . 
  '' ** gender ** '', 
  '' * male * '', 
  '' * female * '', 
  '' * other * '', 
  i see you included an option for attack helicopters, 
  the wild middle east . 
  thanks for reminding me that i still wait for battleborn to be f2p !, 
  almost completely forgot the game existed . 
  dont forget the repost variation or upvote and downvote variation for extra karma . 
  [ and i dont stop killing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgqeupw942c ) and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing and i dont stop killing, 
  thanks !, 
  ill buy the first and second tier dlcs for now and maybe later the rest ( as in gameplay changing ) in winter sale . 
  i see what you did there . 
  you intentionally made an awkward link to that sub . 
  the things i never knew i need ... 
  its chinese drama dude , this way it looks more evil .
