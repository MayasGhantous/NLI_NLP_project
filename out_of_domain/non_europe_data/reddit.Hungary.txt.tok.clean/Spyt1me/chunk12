  hey i just came here whats goin on here ? 
  a low effort but accurate post . 
  dafaq this isnt sombra shitpost, 
  for what ? 
  i also downloaded something around that size yesterday on pc . 
  i was hoping for at least for a sombra video , that could have been done by blizz while that crap loads up to 100 % . 
  what a wild ride . 
  this story would make the top of r/all and make tons of karma . 
  im totally saying this to the karmawhores . 
  well more than 100 hours with rein and til . 
  hungarian here !, 
  im just here for the reddit drama it spawns . 
  and to add to your comment a little bit : chernobyl was still used to make electricity untill 2000 . 
  what do you think of the ana ult changes on ptr ? 
  hanso shot first . 
  roadhog and zen can be used almost every game so i dont think youll find much problems with these two for a long while . 
  the only problem with maining a very few heroes is that you will find yourself in situations where both of your main heroes performs poorly . 
  my example : i only played reinhardt and i reached sr 3150 and i cant climb anymore and mainly because in yoloq-koth reinhardt isnt very powerful and im losing those games , so i began practicing dva and 76 in qp ( both i played a lot in qp for fun ) and i wait untill those ptr buffs leaks to the normal servers . 
  thats what i said , im losing games on koth as rein and im trying to find a solution . 
  dva/reaper + zen makes roadhog sad . 
  ana grenade/widow ( soon to be buffed ) makes zen sad . 
  so yeah even those heroes can be in situations where they perform poorly . 
  edit : im on pc . 
  \u0e07 \u0360\u0ca0 \u035f\u76ca\u0ca0 \u0e07 you have to fight me first to play sombra first \u0e07 \u0360\u0ca0 \u035f\u76ca\u0ca0 \u0e07, 
  you are asking this question in an overwatch subreddit where everyone is here because they enjoy the game what do you think the answers will be ? 
  id like to make a joke but i cant get the hanzoboob out of my head, 
  still , lvl 25 is too low requirement to play competitive . 
  he was tankin zarya with dva , i dont think so . 
  yeah some people do learn quickly i agree on that but why would anyone need a new account ? 
  i died a couple of times at hanamura because the lucio speed boost extends the charge distance ... 
  so taipei didnt have any techical issues untill they were pushed back and losing the round ? 
  so cheap ... ... 
  if you think reading is hard try to understand them . 
  damn words and their meaning . 
  yesterday i played with only master ranked players ( im diamond ) and saw a dude playing torbj\u00f6rn and he had 38 % winrate with him and another teammate changed to bastion because `` if he is playing torbj\u00f6rn im playing bastion ! '', 
  and another changed to hanzo . 
  yeah , i need this avoid this player function . 
  edit : but i understand why blizz removed it :-(, 
  its broken anyway, 
  well ... 
  damn . 
  its like a high budget costum for a marvel movie . 
  his face is like the two face 's excepet he only have one face . 
  oh and his upper body is also like that . 
   fireball of regret . 
  * me going to hell for this laugh *, 
  ( my rough ) translation makes it better :, 
  a hungarian senior is popular on the internet . 
  so i dont have to spend money to have one . 
  you touch my tralala, 
  from the same ~ ~ artist : ~ ~ reblogger :, 
  edit : read u/kuravatto comment under mine . 
  or more than 3 animation for to see how cracked is the barrier . 
  for cet the timing can not be better . 
  i thought he said seagshake, 
  i only saw half of it because i was suspicious and quick enough but oohhh gooooodddd it wasnt worth the click . 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooooo ... ... 
  i was just reading the wiki about wailord because i didnt know what it was at first when :, 
   when it is jumping out of the water , it makes a giant splash due to its large size, 
  much ( 1 +1 ) meta ( 1.6 * 2.5 ) me, 
  but if you could walk on the moon in one direction could you see those ? 
  they have theories that covers `` plotholes '' like this . 
  falrak is a, 
  i hate you reddit . 
  oh and the visual effects of that game ... some people said in ow beta that the game have too many visual effects and they cant see the stuff that matters . 
  im sure they have not played bb with the big minigun dude . 
   shielding mid-air does n't decrease your momentum , so bunnyhopping while timing your shield can make you a lot quicker while still having decent shield up time . 
  really useful in 1v1 situations where you can time it along their attack animation . 
  false . 
  it still slows you down but not as much as walking with your shield up . 
  this jumping-shielding times very well with roadhogs attacks . 
  a trick i dont see anyone using is : charging someone against a wall then doing an auto attack and animation cancel the auto attack into a firestrike to deal 898739866 damage . 
  its not easy to do but its worth it to practice . 
  exactly this , in a local tournament ( hungarian ) my team played against one of the best teams in that tourney and we got absolutely destroyed , i mean even their lucio was a master trickster but we learned lots about what we should improve and overall i was glad that we played against them . 
  edit : more words, 
  or just remove/reduce the movement speed reduction while placing a minisentry, 
  / r/imnotfuckinggooglingit, 
  is not a thing :-(, 
  oh shit , dont give spez any more bad ideas !, 
  i remember watching a game on twitch where the defending team in kings row called gg when the enemy phara killed their widowmaker in the first 30 seconds . 
  timebank is so much better . 
  leave sombra alone !!!, 
  for those who cant figure it out by op 's title : blizz servers died 3 times in one game in nip vs col. first after nip captured the first point and win the next teamfight . 
  the second is in break time . 
  the third is right before the final point . 
  edit : it happened again , 4th crash is when teams switched side and col captured the first point . 
  edit2 : surprise surprise 5th and 6th crash . 
  ^ ^ ^ looks ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ op ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ finally ^ ^ ^ updating ^ ^ ^ his ^ ^ ^ post, 
  40 min break , im out . 
  ~ ~ ow doesnt have lan . ~ ~, 
  ow worlds ran on lan but this tournament doesnt looks like it, 
  yep ... they just harass anyone who is different than 15-30 year old white guy , but even older dudes might get crap for just being old . 
  its sadly not just ow its gaming in general and its roots isnt in gaming its in the community they grow up :-(, 
  those 300 hundred sure are quiet ... 
  `` here comes dat boi '' `` oh , shit waddap ?? '', 
  oohh i can already see it !, 
  my friend pulls me back to graviton surge or through dragons . 
  also best ability to pull back overextended teammates in yoloq . 
   pick up that cat . 
  ftfy,
