  that smug in the bottom right, 
  and at that point he has to prepare for death . 
  wow i almost forgot about that g a m e !, 
  oohh lenny is there anything you find disgusting ? 
  for anything else there 's masterleague, 
  we tried it yesterday and we couldnt one shot zarya , how do you do that ? 
  you can make this combo safer just put a reinhardt on your team and walk up to the enemy reinhardt close enough for your mcree to stun and after that your rein can earthshatter or your roadhog can hook the enemy rein . 
  hey , i liked the selfie camera !, 
  making slfies with the corpses of your enemies before they release spirit is the best thing ever !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ prefferably ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ redridge ^ ^ ^ ^ mountains, 
  genji : * billy pick mercy !, 
  mccree : * but daaaaaaaaaaad !, 
  genji : * thats it you are grounded and no internet for you !, 
  the stage of denial . 
  wtf we can see most of his chest and his back at once, 
  i guess dva is to overwatch is what kael ` thas is to heroes of the storm . 
  anyone tldr his comment pls, 
  any last wish ? 
  and its a live action movie when he is not ( day ) dreaming just to make the depression more `` real '' . 
  ftfy, 
  i mean metoo thanks, 
  but the dude still would have wine in him instead of water . 
  this was surprisingly satisfying, 
  this image have seen better resolutions, 
  wow thats a gif with 2 frames . 
  for a little while i tought i should be a viking main . 
  then i read this and all i can think is deus vult !, 
  purge this unholy mess from our globe !, 
  filthy casuls , i bet they even level dex, 
  overwatch and dark souls, 
  btw prepare for a good ammount of meme import from the souls community . 
  me too thanks, 
  coming from dark souls my experience is :, 
  fast and relatively ok damage  slow but good damage, 
  because everyone were able to dodge most of the weapons in that game, 
  but i didnt have luck to play in the closed beta so i might be wrong, 
  terry crews as doomfist option *, 
   i have documented every single thing i could to use against them in a lawsuit, 
  oh shit is this what people call `` they screwed with the wrong guy '' ? 
  you heartless tincan, 
  they still should make dlcs but only if it only contains cosmetics . 
  you know a little bit of higher quality eye candy once in a while never hurt . 
  '' * you may have won the battle but not the war !, 
  thats good to hear !, 
  at least the devs will be interested in keeping the game alive longer . 
  more like when ana boosts him, 
  the legend never dies !!, 
  even when he have to jump games, 
  ^ ^ welp ^ ^ wrong ^ ^ thread, 
  edit : apparently im not allowed to have a ** slightly ** different opinion on the matter than the hive mind . 
  im not sure if you or any of the downvoters read my entire comment . 
  i actually make an effort to not sound like a demanding asshole and i only do that once and accept that we have a non meta hero aaaannndd try my best to adapt to it . 
  im in masters, 
  also of all the supports ana heals the most and if you can kill her their team is at a massive healing disadvantage . 
  not cool dude , not cool, 
  and upvotes, 
  im sorry italians but your food needs little improvements . 
  console vs pc ( mr ) in a nutshell, 
  was posted on [ pcmr ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5rm2f7/g2a_has_flaw_in_their_system_pointed_out_to_them/?utm_content=full_comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) a few days ago . 
  this is a screenshot of an ama, 
  ( take on me ) i 'll beeee goooooonne, 
  praise the sun !, 
  even in another game, 
  btw is there a sun emblem in the game ? 
  at least i know which faction will be the most grossly incandescent, 
  i didnt play the first game but i looked up the lore , story , etc. 
  but i just dont understand why is that crow is so funny to everyone, 
  help someone pls im feeling like ** kanye ** here, 
  edit : guys . 
  i just tried to make a joke . 
  i dont get it, 
  still dont get it, 
  i dont get it, 
  im not sure how to feel about this . 
  sssuuuuuurrrrrreeeee it was a mistake . 
  knowing why normandy is called that i cringed so hard when he discarded the vikings in the beginning of the video ... i mean he have millions of views per video why doesnt he do his damn research ? 
  and also the logic of the video :, 
  - `` 11th century technology for everyone '' ok that seems fair, 
  - `` vikings and knights are pisspoor and couldnt afford any real weapon and armor '' well if we talk about common people that can be true but they had wealthier people who could afford better equipment . 
  - `` samurais are the 1 % and they could afford the best weapons and armors at that time and with better equipment they win against the other two easily '' but ... but ... knights and viking are not allowed to have their best equipment in the video ... 
  his videos have millions of views and he is trying to make a theory , an answer to a question . 
  but the answer is completely wrong . 
  also this is not the first time he didnt do sufficient research . 
  yeah but they know exactly how a duel would play out . 
  its difficult for them to watch all that fancy moves and take it seriously . 
  ignorance is bliss you know . 
  sombra story time !, 
  i tried to be a little bit competitive in qp as sombra . 
  so i had my ult as well as our rein and zarya . 
  i told them that im gon na jump in and ult so we should use everything we have . 
  well that was the plan , i jump in ult most of the enemy kill one of them then die . 
  the rest of my team ? 
  i heard our earthshatter and graviton go off but all i saw in the kill feed is that my entire team dying . 
  moral of story : doesnt matter what heroes people play ( as long the team have good enough healing ) because positioning , skill with the hero and teamplay will have more effect on the game than a meta hero . 
  ( this is untill diamond after that bit more metaish heroes needed ), 
  ive never really thought of sombra as an anti flanker but it makes sense and she can defend their supports very well with the hacks too . 
  enemy gengu/tracer with no healing or abilities is a sad flanker . 
  underground torbj\u00f6rn fight is illegal you know, 
  that was a smaller mistake the bigger was that they made overwatch their rival . 
  ( and lots of smaller marketing failures ),
