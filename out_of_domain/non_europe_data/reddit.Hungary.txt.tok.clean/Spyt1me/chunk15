  i mean metoo thanks, 
  i guess its a good thing for this game mode . 
  if the hologram doesnt deal damage and is controlled by an ai it could be used as a distraction or deception . 
  people see a sombra running and gunning and thinking `` ooh its just the hologram dont mind it '' but in reality its the real sombra acting like an ai and waiting for an opportunity . 
  there are differences between playing with your team against other teams and yoloq . 
  * wo n't be a problem if you 'd just disappear forever . 
  oohhh you poor soul ... have my upvote, 
  i regret upvoting spongebob of immunity for these `` upvote or else '' post now :-(, 
  metoo thanks, 
  i mean me too thanks, 
  i dont like where this conversation is going, 
  - me luckily downloading the patch, 
  - trying to log in, 
  - servers shitting themselves, 
  - allright lets try the offline mode and try out the tutorial, 
  - you need to launch the game in online mode first to launch it offline, 
  - wtf, 
  chris metzen, 
  its in his name doomfist so he wont be a good guy at least . 
  dont listen to these wall of texts just play the game and have fun . 
  just try to play as many heroes decently as you can . 
  oh and dont be salty it ruins the fun for others and for you . 
  america first hungary turd . 
  or just increase the time it takes to revive someone . 
  10 seconds maybe ? 
  apparently a nobushis weakness is a geyser . 
  he is a robot in disguise , he wont ever understand it . 
  its kinda this subs thing to downvote a comment immediately then upvote it, 
  and he did a 90 degree turn while doing his hammer trick, 
  hollywood and their stupid whitewashing, 
  years maybe ? 
  would be nice to post the region and if its on console or pc, 
  ooohhh . 
  ... shit . 
  im not in the mood for this shit so could you tell me what did he pull out ? 
  thats enough of an answer for me . 
  for a 0,5 second ( or something like that ) the earthshatter keeps stunning enemies . 
  so if you only held yours for 0,3 sec you get stunned . 
   `` it 's just a game !, 
  try and have fun ! '', 
  is actually a good advice for some comp players who take the game too seriously, 
  necessarily, 
  and because in higher sr he is a must have everyone and their grandmother knows how to play against reinhardt so a rein player basically becames a hold right click simulator . 
  meme too danks, 
  is this supposed to make me feel better ? 
  we did it reddit !, 
  for honor is a ** fantastic ** fighting game ... hidden behind all the usual ubisoft bs . 
  me too thanks, 
  `` large pink-haired half-giant women '', 
  latin sounds so badass, 
  spin 2 win , no game is complete without one . 
  the kid is still annoying in the movies, 
  roadhog be like : '' * oh shit oh shit shit shit shit shiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttt * '', 
  a simple left click spam would have been much better . 
  but suicide potg got style brotha , yeah looking awesome, 
  and what if you could platinum your weapon twice , and get it to diamond skin ? 
  the newest form of e-cancer . 
  clickbait is dominating youtube !, 
  will youtube change its algorythm ??? 
  news & discussion !!, 
  maybe someone else 's computer but with the same graphics card ? 
  did you made this post just so you can lure the trolls here and ban some people ? 
  lmao, 
  well placed and well executed sir . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ ^ me, 
  based on the ammount of new paladins related posts , hr really done fcked up this time . 
  there is a small chance we get not one but two heroes at once . 
  keywords : small chance . 
  good luck, 
  ** b e e n h e r e a l l a l o n g **, 
  its not a bug . 
  but yeah carrying the scabbard on the back is impractical , but who cares it looks sick . 
  not as deep as the switcheroo, 
  wow !, 
  it really works also for ** me ** ? 
  guess we 'll find out , but its ** too ** bad it takes such a long time . 
  anyway ** thanks ** for the magic trick it really did brighten my day . 
  metoo thanks, 
  so basically im not allowed to play any other games because when we are not scrimming i have to play ranked . 
  cmon blizz i already dont have a life and itll be difficult even for me to upkeep my sr. 
  well , looks like you dont actually have problem with the game itself but with the people who are tilting you . 
  you know people are people and they are the same between games ( and in real life ) , there are trolls/toxic kids/whatever in lol , dota , csgo , etc. 
  based on your post you look just like one of them . 
  im glad we wont be able to play with each other because of that 1000 + sr difference . 
  will this meme ever tire out ? 
  slow moving targets with big barriers . 
  seems like junkrat maybe just maybe will be useful ? 
  or a friendly orisa lifts up the enemy reinhardt so i as reinhardt can struck my ultimate against the rest of the enemy, 
  hot garbage, 
  all the defending team had to do was just to back away a little bit and not trying to kill a nano + ironclad bastion ... he is really not op . 
  get a dva if you wan na deal with him good . 
  edit : this whole crap just reminds me of the first few weeks when nobody on the lower half of mmr knew how to deal with him . 
  just to add a little bit more of counterplay, 
  - a dive comp reks him . 
  - soon orisa can just stand and shoot him untill he is dead, 
  - d.va nullifies his damage for 4 seconds, 
  - gengu reflects his own damage, 
  - tracer drops a bomb and shoots him a little bit,
