  - giant hitbox in recon and standing still in turret form means easy to hit him with sleepdart . 
  - hanzo ultimate + a little bit of damage, 
  - bastion cant survive a whole hog ( especially if hog ults him behind reinhardt shield ), 
  - earthshatter, 
  yeah he can survive a reaper ult and gengu ult but reaper or gengu will not be alone in any teamfight . 
  bastion just got buffed . 
  if you were here when the game launched in the first few weeks you may remember how the majority wanted bastion to be nerfed because they thought he was insanely op , now its happening again . 
  and if youd like to know if he actually op ... he is not . 
  he is allright . 
  needs more jpeg, 
  thirteen boi, 
  ... but it burned to his skin inseparable and from this day he is knows as the, 
  ** p a n c a k e m a n **, 
  the 9gag staff/admins steals content from other sites and post it as if one of their users posted it and they never mention the source ever . 
  i mean metoo thanks, 
  you are a derogatory !, 
  here is a little trick , when the game is loaded into skirmish you dont choose orisa but someone else . 
  and just pre select orisa from the hero selection screen and spam click the choose button like a madman , ofc in skirmish someone else already chose her but when the game has found enough players people will have to choose again their heroes . 
  more talking equally increases salt levels so dont even bother talking to them just give them the information they need at the moment . 
  self sufficient, 
  more please, 
  pardon my ingorance but where do you guys get the idea that she is autistic ? 
  the tasmanian devil in ow ? 
  thats cool !, 
  that would end this stupid comment chain rightly, 
  literally fake news, 
  6 horsemen of the apocalypse, 
  it happened to me with a genji . 
  he swift striked through my charge . 
  we tried to recreate it in custom but we couldnt . 
  proper positioning , knowing when to attack and retreat/regroup can get you easily into diamond . 
  you dont even need awesome mechanical skills just know these 3 things really well . 
  team comp doesnt really matter up untill diamond just the team have to have enough healing . 
  but the perfect players wouldnt let roadhog hook them . 
  i still think the hook targets have an easier time avoiding the hook than roadhog hitting those hooks, 
  another lake, 
  my pc can run this game for 144 fps consistently and about 2 weeks ago i set my max fps to 30 ( for dat cinematic feel the other game devs talked about ) ** and oh my god , never again **, 
  his palms are sweaty , knees weak , arms are heavy, 
  there 's vomit on his sweater already : mom 's spaghetti, 
  i didnt know italy/italians had this much of a meme potential . 
  and i get off by bamboozling others !, 
  but still no luck with it ... 
  do n't let your dreams be memes . 
  they saved a life by bending a fence . 
  and even if you want to eat that `` vension '' you have to bend that fence to get it out anyway ... 
  i totally forgot about the mond\u00e1k a magyar t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelemb\u0151l , thanks for reminding me, 
  what im imagining now : kings row , we are attacking and i as junkrat just jump right behind the enemy reinhardt ( with zarya bubble ) place my trap at his feet and try to shoot him as much as i can and when they kill me my passive takes out the reinhardt . 
  and our team will still have a rein with lots of barrier health so its basically a winning fight from there . 
  what could go wrong is if they have roadhog , dva ( if dm can eat junkrat passive ) , orisa pulling me away , phara knocking me away , mei could place a wall under reinhardt or my trap doesnt traps rein for some reason ( miss it , zarya bubble , they kill me mid air ) . 
  every time someting big change is happening on the live servers ( new hero , hero rework , big balance update ) people become ... excited ... idiotic ... toxic . 
  this is site is the most me_irl shit i have ever seen . 
  and this is why ugly people often have big beards, 
  `` perfect moments can be had , but not preserved , except in memory '', 
  i mean meetoo thanks, 
  in high master and above they already are shooting like everyone else is slowed down, 
  and your team be like `` wtf dude just group and up dont die ffs ! '', 
  there is a friendly pub and a bookstore nearby so it doesnt look like the `` wrong neighbourhood '', 
  what if my pony is reinhardt ? 
  once we ( masters and gms ) played against silver , gold , plats in ranked . 
  we camped their spawn room . 
  no idea how it happened , it wasnt even late night . 
  you cant be a bad lucio or i just ask him to let me play rein . 
  it worked for s1-s3 but at the second half of s3 i felt the need to play more heroes competitively so i began practicing and now i can play d.va and winston with confidence . 
  orisa is next on my list of `` can play this hero in comp '' .
