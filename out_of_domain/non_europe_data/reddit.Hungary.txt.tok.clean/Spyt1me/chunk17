  roadhog in dva 's spandex suit ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  this fucking meme just keeps on giving , unbelievable, 
   for some stupid , pre-teen reasons you were n't allowed to like both, 
  there was something like that but its also holds some truth . 
  you cant really `` main '' 2 games at once , at least i dont have the time to git rly gud with 2 games at the same time . 
  this shit is everywher in top of r/animemes, 
  uh-oh someone made a meme into a real thing . 
  the end is nigh my brothers . 
  rip, 
  when you see a fresh new ** dank ** meme trend on me_irl and want to be part of this ** sad ** ritual . 
  no , me too thanks, 
  what about us , from the other side of the globe ? 
  we are awake, 
  if the cashier do this he is most likely hate you and want you dead . 
  what is `` updog '' ? 
  but he is really not rocket science . 
  here a comprehensive winston guide to prove it : try to get your team to group up to attack the enemy at once and as winston just jump in and kill their ana/mercy/zen  lucio . 
  bonus effectiveness if you can communicate with your gonjo/tracer to attack the same targets . 
  thats it . 
  this is really it . 
  * get downvoted -, 
   artistic veneer of depression and local poverty, 
  flair material, 
  and who are you ? 
  some kind of memeconomist ? 
  did you just bamboozle these innocents ? 
  edit : holy shit its not a bamboozle, 
  i also played rein for a ridiculous ammount of time ( well more than 150 ) and it always happaned when i tried to drop my shield to do something . 
  it never happened when i was holding my shield and had no intention of dropping it . 
  it looks very much like a bug for someone other than rein . 
  nah dude pepsi solves problems not create them ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  boostio is no joke anymore, 
  the saga continues, 
  wait guys i mean delete this meme thanks, 
  soros is illuminati confirmed, 
  how long untill 9gag steals this ? 
  so plot armor, 
  its not an advice but my experience with them . 
  the last time i tried to play as hungary i ended having 5 enemies ( denmark , commonwealth , bohemia , spain , otto ) and muscvy under pu with i believe denmark , plus i rivaled venice . 
  basically half of europe wanted my clay . 
  im now playing a more relaxed nation like the teutonic order . 
  thanks . 
  even a frying pan ... man such a bad luck, 
  and i thought people were just trolling with me . 
  damn . 
  it really works !, 
  ** carthus curved sword intensifies **, 
  dont try to understand shitty internet memes just go with the flow, 
  i recently cut down my gaming time by a lot and something very similar happened to me . 
  and my inner monologue for days now : `` holy fuck where did this sudden depression came from ?! '', 
  but i feel like this is a good thing . 
  for now . 
  i just use google and put a * reddit * or the subreddits name after the word . 
  works so much better, 
  so it actually makes sense ? 
  english is my second language . 
  worst day of my life, 
  404 not found :(, 
  doggo or a grown pupper, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ idk, 
  sick, 
  clearing houses would be much more fun with it, 
  i 'd bet 500 karma if i could that this was posted in another website as a satire but 9gag stole it . 
  i would love to see a satire post over there accusing t_d for overmoderation . 
  and with rules like that only the most faithful of the trump church can remain un-banned . 
  is there a subreddit for deciphering trump quotes ? 
  got eem !, 
   wgxcq, 
  you are not fooling me, 
  its gif you savage, 
  me dood doot thanks mr skeltal, 
  yes, 
  sub is called wholesome ** memes **, 
  what did you expect ? 
  quality content ? 
  so reddit is pay 2 win, 
  both, 
  and now you all probably regret having capitalism . 
  i dont even know what this meme is for anymore, 
  `` and i would have gotten away with it too if it werent for this meddling u/somecasualobserver '', 
  flair checks out, 
  he messed with the wrong sub . 
  the unimaginatively re-named app, 
  this is the biggest tantrum ive ever seen . 
  and every single one of them is downvoted lol . 
  i think i came to reddit right after it was over, 
  i guess it takes a bit of time untill the reddit refreshes that page, 
  wait i messed up, 
  and angery, 
  handling a situation like this this well is something i envy . 
  seize the means of production !, 
  down with the bourgeosie !, 
  the gentle laborer shall no longer suffer !, 
  communism will win !, 
  ( excuse my language english is my 2nd ) there are some useful links in the sidebar of this subreddit ( right side of this page ) . 
  if you want my personal experience then you should make a list of * `` stuffs i wanted to do instead of games but i didnt have time ` cuz of gaming '' * which helps when you are bored and tempted to play , make it as long as you can . 
  and you are browsing a creepy guys post history . 
  you have never been to r/all ? 
  oh you innocent soul ... 
  you dont know any of the fans but you know ariana .
