  s o r o s, 
  looks like this new hobby will engolf you whole, 
  i guess as a `` winding down '' it can work , but you have to be very conscious about it and you still have to stop playing those eventually . 
  and relapsing has a much greater chance . 
  its not gon na be fun , you know it , you saw and know very well every gaming mechanic a game developer can make for their game . 
  and after 10 hours of relapsing you gon na feel shit , depressed , you screwed up . 
  and will keep asking yourself :, 
  `` was it even worth it ? '', 
  `` it was not , it wasnt even that great . 
  what a waste of time . 
  i hope i wont do this again . '', 
  sure , why not ? 
  have an upvote !, 
  wow, 
   amy 's baking company is no more : notorious kitchen nightmares restaurant closes after owners threatened to stab customers , stole from their own staff and broke iron-willed gordon ramsay, 
  please someone give me a season and an episode number . 
  edit : found it in the linked reddit thread above, 
  if you have someone to translate it for you :, 
  my go to shop for electronics, 
  get a summer job bro . 
  it makes some money and you dont have to worry about relapsing while you work . 
  the dankest automod ive ever seen,

  `` so i thought today we 'd do a picture in gray '', 
  ruined,

  so you think that we are weird ? 
  the dad is an addict and has a young son, 
  good luck with google translate . 
  just an assumption i made from the picture and op 's title . 
  and you know gaming is more time consuming than money consuming , at least it is for me . 
  well , thats surprising and the translation is very accurate . 
  violence sells well in any medium . 
  or just a big part of a not violence centered story . 
  news , books , movies , blogs , games ( not just virtual ) , comedy and probably more has it . 
  books and movies has their mortal kombat x , as well as blogs and comedy . 
  its not something only videogames have .

  hail science !, 
  the hungarian esport scene is very small . 
  like really small . 
  seeing this so far below with only 8 karma is hilarious, 
  you should make it a little bit more restrictive because when the cravings come , matchmaking multiplayer games ( like overwatch , league , etc ) might slip in . 
  be very careful when you are bored , thats when you are the most susceptible to relapse !, 
  and congratulations for your first step !, 
  good luck !, 
  you mean on a boxer short ? 
  only if the iq difference is more than 30, 
  that kind of attitude will never get you 1600 karma .

   is n't it in the game where she became herself ? 
  sadly `` this me '' is not compatible with the world we live in and he needs to change or be more and more miserable . 
  good luck with your struggle !, 
  i dont mind the downvotes , some people didnt like something in my submission . 
  its ok . maybe it was the part where i didnt know if i should quit or not , but now im 100 % on qutting . 
  thanks !, 
  i think a big slice of the sub is fatigued from all the upvoteing , its a bit too early for another updoot party . 
  ( im 26 ) my problem was with moderation ( i tried it for like 2 months ) is that i felt like im waiting every day just to play a little bit , it felt like it was the highlight of the day the 2 hours ive been craving all day .
