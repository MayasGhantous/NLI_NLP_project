  be very careful if you decide to do it . 
  boredom is your friend and enemy at the same time . 
  it can force you to do things , stuffs you wouldnt * normally * do because `` gaming is so much fun i dont wan na stop it '' . 
  maybe you should do 1-2-3 weeks without gaming and watch how you feel about it . 
  [ currently my favorite quote which is very similar to yours in meaning ] ( https://pics.me.me/if-you-cant-fly-then-run-if-you-cant-run-12319849.png ), 
  to think how many games i became very good at and how little if nothing it matters is terrifying . 
  i cant even bring it up in almost any conversation because nobody cares if you are good at video games . 
  even my addicted friends would be like `` huh . 
  cool . '', 
  good bot, 
  at least you have that sweet 1000 day badge . 
  get well dude !, 
  interesting sub , will check it out later . 
  thanks !, 
  a long sob story before any valuable information . 
  its a fearmongering garbage article . 
  hmm . 
  this post gave me an idea . 
  i should sell my steam and blizzard accounts , i can probably make decent money . 
  im not planning on using any of their services or games so i dont care if its illegal . 
  what are they gon na do ? 
  and if scumbags will steal it , well , at least its gone . 
   i immediately uninstalled . 
  yeah . 
  no thanks . 
  lesson learned i guess . 
  ok so my english is not my mother tongue and i have difficulties to translate your post . 
  what i can understand from your post :, 
  you are working . 
  you did not play games for 2 months . 
  you have urges so you installed games on a 32gb asus laptop . 
  and i do n't understand the rest of your post . 
  where are you from ? 
  maybe someone can understand your language here . 
  you got ta do something in that time you just freed up . 
  get some new hobbies and lots of new habits . 
  not only because you have lots of time now but because of the social pull of a community . 
  maybe understanding how addictions work can ease your struggle . 
  [ r/nofap has a good explanation of it ] ( https://www.nofap.com/porn-addiction/ ) just scroll down to * how porn addiction works * , i know its about porn addiction but there is no difference really . 
  we were playing with sticks and stones outside like complete animals . 
  but i only vaguely remember this prehistoric era . 
  / u/waterguy12, 
   video games does not make me a schoolshooter , make me lose all my moral , does not make me a piece of shit , does not make my temper worse . 
  i see you havent played any team based competitive esport video games, 
  me too thanks, 
  thats my fetish, 
  wait ... are you guys keeping these as ... . pets ? 
  i vaguely remember that it was maybe 300somethingish but im really not sure . 
  thanks !, 
  dude !, 
  it sounds like you dont feel so good . 
  dont you dare to give up and give in . 
  it will just make your situation worse . 
  perhaps you should talk to someone about it ? 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ sure ^ ^ why ^ ^ is ^ ^ this ^ ^ downvoted ^ ^ so ^ ^ much . 
  good for you to realise that you were playing like an addict and its not healthy for you to play this much !, 
  what will you do instead of pogo ? 
  do you have any ideas ? 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ first ^ ^ sentence, 
  yes it sounds like something entirely different is going on . 
  * squidward ( r/all ) trying to sleep while wednesday frog ( r/me _ irl ) is dancing outside his window *, 
  no , no , its not it . 
  it was just some weird feeling . 
  anyway me too thanks . 
  i will definitely try magnesium supplements . 
  the post was a good read . 
  thanks !, 
  the real lpt is always me too thanks, 
   nod and smile while talking . 
  its just ... unsettling . 
  not just in finland but anywhere in europe . 
  understandable . 
  have a day, 
  testing, 
  too bad i can only give you upboats, 
  wtf . 
  this totally goes against the previous lore . 
  the hell . 
  meme machine broken, 
  cool cool . 
  wtf, 
  whats up with all the insanely powerful artifacts scattered around the earth ? 
  why homeworld dont care about these artifacts ? 
  they sent back peridot thousands of years later to check on the cluster so they knew the crystal gems on earth are no threat . 
  and more importantly : what are the humans doing ??? 
  they have to know about the gems and have know that these aliens are a conquering type . 
  edit : elk\u00fart vicc, 
  what have we done, 
  coconut guy, 
  good luck guy !, 
  if the customer is annoyed by you , you cant say it in a good way anyway . 
   helping, 
  we cant even help ourselves, 
  all i can think is how much mud and dirt it throws at the bikers back, 
  * seed of a beech, 
  look at mr. moneymaker making money for someone else !,
