  top 10 meme explanations, 
  metoo thanks, 
  its like shooting stars . 
  my bullshit senses are tingling, 
  the best, 
  guide to gank low levels ( could be outdated , im not playing since warlords ), 
  preferably be a healer . 
  step 1 : make an engineer building in your garrison, 
  step 2 : get your rocket boots from the building, 
  step 3 : go to low lvl area and activate your rocket boots, 
  congratulation now every time you jump your character perform a heroic leap . 
  low lvls cant outrun you and geared people cant catch you because you heroic leap with every jump . 
  to add salt to the wound make a selfie with the corpse of your enemies . 
   change does n't come easy , and many of the best things in life do n't come easy . 
  but to anyone who accepts this and is ready to do things the hard way , know that it is possible and worth every consequence !, 
  i really needed that . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  try to be outside as much as you can . 
  you will make new experiences , memories and your home/room wont remind you of your gaming habit if you are not there . 
  troll and gay, 
  he is flying from the local grocery store to home . 
   fully automated luxury gay space communism, 
  in short : homeworld, 
  did you just shittymorphed me ? 
   having fun in a team based shooter, 
    looks like ive finally found someone that plays decently and is a nice guy !, 
     things get unfavorable for us, 
      i make a mistake which led to my `` friend 's '' demise, 
       suddenly im the worst fuckin asshole and should kill myself and my whole fucking family, 
  the second best solution for this was not making a single word . 
  non at all , because these frustrated and stressed people would just type back and waste time arguing over nothing . 
  the best solution was is quitting gaming . 
   do i have to quit ? 
  is there promise of a competitive 1v1 rts that will dominate the pc gaming scene in the near future ? 
  we mostly have outdated information about it  . 
  but i doubt that you 'll see any resurgence of the genre . 
   where can i go from here ? 
  continue to burn those hours every day or instead do something meaningful , something that matters , something that wont be irrelevant in 1-2 years . 
  even lol and wow will be irrelevant no matter how big they are and most of the skills you learn from those are tottally inapplicable in real life . 
   if i do have to take that terrifying step ( ... ), 
  if you think it is a bit too big for you , try to moderate it first , then later it will be easier to decide if you want to quit . 
   ( ... ) and quit what i 've built my life around all together, 
  im 26 and trying to restart my life in a better direction .
