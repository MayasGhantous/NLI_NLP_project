   back when i managed to quit for the first time , it was because i still somewhat cared about everything . 
  but now it feels like whatever .

  i wanted to record gameplay videos without recording my friends talk in ts , so i followed [ this little tutorial . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te0dy3aofru ) it worked allright with a little static so i tried to fix this and broke this program . 
  i reinstalled it , didnt work , booted pc in safe mode to uninstall , deleted virtual audio cable related registry , searched for leftover bits but i just cant make it work again . 
  edit : or if there is an alternative program that would be nice too !, 
  his name seemed like it was his battletag so i drew over it .

  the only thing changed about my machine is that i added a secondary monitor but i tried it with only one .

  [ removed ], 
  i 'd like to thank this subreddit for opening my eyes to my most obvious ( and biggest ) problem ever and giving me stories and knowledge to help me . 
  thank you !, 
  im 26 years old and since the end of elementary school i 've been gaming in all my free time so i was afraid i couldnt quit this addiction . 
  i wasnt even sure if i should quit , i have online friends !, 
  `` but at the very least i have to reduce my gaming time and decide later what should i do '' was my thought process . 
  first , i didnt let myself play before 18:00 . 
  it was doable and it felt so great to have a little bit of control over this . 
  then i found some flaws in that rule so i added : no gaming before 18:00 , no matchmaking multiplayer games ( with random people ) , only with friends or someone i know and can talk to over voice chat , definitely no single-player games , and no gaming after 22:00 . 
  after i felt im getting used to this i decreased the time even more 19:00 to 22:00 then 20:00 to 22:00 but it still felt like im waiting all day just to play , like its the highlight of my day , it feels wrong . 
  after a bit of thinking today i decided that i am finally ready for that `` big jump '' and set my flair on the sidebar . 
  being home all day , trying to occupy myself with whatever i can think of and fighting the cravings ... ... i wan na go to work . 
  some years ago i stopped watching and i forgot which episode i saw last . 
  i remember that ichigo is giving up his powers for a greater good .
