  still 80 % of her health is gone so if any other abilities just randomly flies at her she is dead . 
  [ made a gifsound out of that ] ( https://gifsound.com/?gif=i.imgur.com/rxbrcx6.gif&amp;v=pd_imyhnoq4&amp;s=11 ), 
  first rule of blizz beta games : dont tell anyone they can sign up, 
  ^ ^ just ^ ^ a ^ ^ theory : maybe blizz need avarege players to test their game and not overly fanboys who says everything is awesome everything is cool, 
  a tlv and murky main i presume . 
  thats the 0th rule . 
   xcq, 
  i dont fall for this . 
  i feel like there is a real story behind this comic . 
  anyone ? 
  it isnt as bad as it sounds she have good mobility so she can easily orbwalk / juke the enemy , have pretty good range with talent , a heal and a knockback . 
  so yeah you can play hammer like you would raynor . 
  im not saying its better to play her like raynor all the time but its possible and if the enemy have many counter to your siege mode its worth speccin into . 
  yep but i would rather change it than nerf it like : under 75 % mana her mana regen increased by 25 % ( approximate numbers ), 
  because you know throwing combos costs you mana and whats the point of her resets if you run out of mana . 
  am i the only one who is bothered by the outfit blizz gave him ? 
  it doesnt really look d2 necromancer like to me . 
  ohh poor moderino is scared away , awwww . 
  my pitchfork is ready . 
  day . 
  eeevvvveeeerrr . \u2570 \u272a \u15dc \u272a \u256f **, 
  lmao, 
  yep , ill save that , thanks !, 
  it became a meme and people like new memes . 
  i remember this and dumbo from my childhood , both of times i felt `` i did not sign up for this sht '', 
  ftfy, 
  hey , dont tell the scrubs chogall is secretly op !, 
  ( in hl ), 
  ive seen some weird and shocking subreddits and all of those were at least semi-understandable for why those even exists . 
  but chairs submerged ? 
  and also the toxic person trying to convince other people to kick the dude , creates more toxicity and its also just a waste of time , minutes are passing by just to kick a dude who might or might not be toxic/troll .

  fyi : robin died like 6 times .

  better * buff * pyroblast . 
  water dragon . 
  one ... two ... thr - yep thats too many fetish in one image . 
  tlv maybe ? 
  oh-oh i know : the purple autoselect guy !, 
  he is the only original hots character . 
  [ lol ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/9gag ), 
   on second thought let 's not go to hl it is a silly place . 
  hype . 
  the stage of denial . 
  im losing games !, 
  pls blizz fix this !!!, 
  blizzard your game is hard and makes me think !, 
  please rework the game so i dont have to think at all . 
  if they really looking into it the only thing i can imagine can come out of this is a buff for abathur, 
  vanilla wow style alterac where the bg can continue for days . 
  that would be hot damn awesome . 
  edit : also 40v40, 
  i have a friend too who got into the beta and when he when he saw he is able to play the game :, 
  `` dude get on ts quickly ! '', 
  '' - why ? '', 
  `` just get on ts and open the game stuff ! '', 
  '' - open the what ? '', 
  `` the stuff where your wow is ! '', 
  '' - the wow game folder ? 
  like on my hard drive '', 
  `` no , the stuff where you launch the games '', 
  '' - the battle.net client ? '', 
  `` yess that ! '', 
  so i open the client and he asks me to click on overwatch . 
  it was so hard to contain my dissappointment and frustration but i was able to seem calm about it . 
  `` and click on the play button '', 
  '' - ... i dont have any play button '', 
  then i explained to him that he was flagged for the beta , and he had no idea he was signed up for the beta . 
  edit : i might have pictured him as a dickhead but he really isnt . 
  edit2 : i almost forgot , he played the game for 2 hours and he said its awesome but he have to raid and pvp in wow and he doesnt have time to play it because of wow . 
  we are definitely not on that stage . 
  `` dont upvote '', 
  141 upvotes and is on the frontpage of this sub within 5 hours . 
  i was going to upvote , but to make up for people like you i downvoted, 
  ive been tricked [ nnnooooooo ] ( http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/ ), 
  i dont know but other * `` cough '' ^ ^ dota * * `` cough '' ^ ^ 2 * mobas did it well . 
  am spooked . 
  dont trigger my ptsd please . 
  best thing since hots release ? 
  but i thought the best thing since hots release is the nova nerf / s, 
  maybe he had enough of this meme and ended it . 
  or she was crazy , but either way op dodged a bullet . 
  i wish i could say that . 
  you cant handle the fabolousness .
