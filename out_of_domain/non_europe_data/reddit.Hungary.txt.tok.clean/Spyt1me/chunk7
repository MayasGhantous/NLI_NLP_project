  ill be so torn apart between those games notsuriffeelsgoodorbadman, 
  looks like a perfect timing for me , you wont be studying much between exams anyway . 
  ( if you studied well before ofc ), 
  you have to get past my red orb invasions first . 
  a ) hype train crashes . 
  how long was it ? ... 
  i ca n't recall the joy of playing anything else , nor the other subs im used visit , nor the other streamers . 
  i 'm naked in the salt . 
  there 's nothing -- no veil between me and the wheel of salt . 
  this ... is . . beutiful ... 
  \u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0 how tough am i ?!? 
  ive played dark souls 2 to ng +4 ... with mouse and keyboard \u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0 \u256d \u2229 \u256e, 
  so r u daed ? 
  thanks !, 
  i save this for future use . 
  thanks for the reply , i didnt know we are supposed to clean it from dust this often . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  [ here it is . 
  its the side of our shop an old painting .

  edit : made in biatorb\u00e1gy, 
  [ another image in the same town ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dhco3e6.jpg ), 
  in the laning phase i just heal them to about 80 % - 90 % of their health if they think they dont need to dodge unnecessary damage . 
  this usually makes them more careful . 
  and then in ranked it will be a must to turn on no matter how much you dislike it . 
  [ all i heard while i read your post ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs7nqwgt4-i ), 
  and your rank is most probably , like im 90 % sure , is your real skill level . 
  thats right you are as bad or good as your teammates . 
  so the only thing you can do is :, 
  watch replays , learn to play the game better in-game and read online posts ( map strategies hero guides , timings etc etc ) . 
  but the most important is stop the cry baby attitude , its not going to help you not in the least . 
  so the ultimate tlv answer to every bad situation is : just jump bro !, 
  online team-games are like this , if you cant deal with it just find a solo game . 
  personally i dont even care what my team is saying , if they became annoying i just tell them im going to mute them so they dont waste time typing bs , but its rare . 
  * but ... my team is mentally handicapped like a dead rocking horse *, 
  your rank is 38 so is your team and enemy . 
  dont expect them to know the basic concept of this game at that level , heck even below rank 10 people can not count to 5 and force teamfights outnumbered . 
  so just play and learn , youll get better eventually which will show as your rank gets better . 
  / rant off i just hate it when someone go full crybaby mode . 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ these ^ ^ ^ comments ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ tough ^ ^ ^ love, 
  in soviet russia we play early game in late game . 
  i could tottaly make a complete breakfest for the whole family while my character is dead . 
  why breakfest ? 
  cuz the game went from a `` last game before bed '' to an all nighter . 
  thats all good and nice but how about a 4 man chogall ? 
  leoric with march of the black king wrecking everyone . 
  i played leroic lots in hl in the past month and i think march of the bone king is as good as entombe if you pick the right talents . 
  the double swing + 60 % slow for 3 second ( 6second total ) is enough cc and the entombe on top of it just an overkill . 
  and most of the meta heroes ( excluding tanks ) can jump/teleport out of entombe anyway , but the slow still effects them after they tele/jump . 
  and you could say `` you are not building leoric as a tank '' the thing is if you dont have cc the enemy can just ignore you . 
  edit : word, 
  im sure blizz will add a casual mode into ow . 
  beta doesnt have enough players to test 2 modes . 
  phlog buff update - can never forget, 
  awww thanks !, 
  you shouldnt have, 
  # ** did someone say moderino ?!?!, 
  # ** i dont know i heard some fucker say moderino so i grabbed my finest pitchfork and ran around dongstown asking who said that , in a politely and calm manner !!!!, 
  i think in higher level a team still can splitpush with terror , put down the pot on top fort so your team have an easier time to deal damage to it while the terror can just go to mid fort . 
  altho its just a theory . 
  it doesnt make or brake the game its just a nice thingy, 
   i have n't gotten angry or salty about the game once !, 
  username doesnt checks out . 
  or he could be a shapeshifter who can turn into any hero in game as much he wants but without heroics . 
  edit : i just realised thats what abatur is for :(, 
  so zarya 's ass design is that kind of design ? 
  they purposefully not show the ass directly , only the armor which lets fantasize about that booty . 
  hhhmmm best booty so far . 
  im both amazed and terrified . 
  and a lot of them does not want to play many qm games just to be able to play hl and they might quit the game , its not a solution im affraid . 
  edit : for a corporation its better to educate them than making them leave the game ... 
  thats still childish , you want to fight them with being polite . 
  the only non toxic solution is to ask them nicely once to stop whatever it is that bothers the team and if he doesnt agree with you just mute/block/report him and move on . 
  edit : doing anything other than this is wastes waaaaayy to much time in a game like this . 
  hots is not a charity , its bussiness . 
  fewer players mean less money for blizz and its not a `` evil corporation '' thing . 
  they are making games to make money .

  you know the original argument was : if an offender is silenced , should he be able to play hl for the duration of the silence . 
  botter , hacker is another level . 
  1.3 k rig owner here , pee sea mustard raise, 
  dude its a cinematic death , everyone knows a person can be shot in game a million times , but if it happens in a cinematic scene the person will die . 
  he would be perfect for a map objective . 
  your team have to revive him only to kill him right away . 
  perfect !, 
  username , flair , comment content and relevancy checks out . 
  looks like a borderlands [ character intro screen ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=borderlands+boom+and+bewm&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1262&amp;bih=874&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj76puau_flahvhvswkhwpsceaq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=borderlands+character+intros ) for mercy, 
  its the avarage dumb for bnet forums . 
  are . 
  the . 
  beam . 
  you have to understand , making both would cost us a raid tier . 
  my first viking game were on tomb of the spider queen and the enemy was : liming kaelthas thrall diablo zagara with a morales support . 
  on my first try !, 
  cmon game dont go so hard on me . 
  im in the same situation as you but i decided to reroll a blood elf . 
  in the lore they didnt have much choice so they joined the horde , much like myself . 
  im not a us citizen so i was like : what the fck this ahole is ^ ^ makehotsgreatagain - aaaaaahhh i get it !, 
  its a bernie sanders reference right ? 
  right ?
