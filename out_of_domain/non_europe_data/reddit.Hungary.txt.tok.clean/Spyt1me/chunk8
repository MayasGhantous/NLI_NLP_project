  a stage dive etc, 
  oh , man , im * ssssooooooooooo * confused right now !, 
  i thought the same , i think that scene would have been much better if the girl just quietly looks with a terrified expression and maybe she covers her eye after a bit . 
   these amazing kills are extra satisfying when you know they can see how you killed them and you know they are just a salty tilted ragekids after they see it . 
  ftfy, 
  yes 18:00 cest ( central europen summer time ) is when blizz starts flagging . 
  dont forget to inhale afterwards !, 
  oh my god , master 5 here i come !, 
  i heard the beats while reading it . 
  so cool . 
  is this moderino ? 
  good !, 
  aameba just got brutally , savagelly rekted , absolutely burned down !!, 
   they promise to get back to adding more features to the game soon after launch , he mentioned more competitive mode changes and that they 're already working on competitive features ( spectator mode stuff ), 
  the spectator mode should be named `` onlywatch '', 
  i dont know man im not sure `` wod a way to improve this balls '' will be a widely used sentence . 
  i dont think these heroes are kidnapped because if they are they would be missing from their own universes . 
  its more likely to me that they are some kind of copies of their originals . 
  they dont know how they ended up in the nexus but are happy to fight here against other heroes . 
  also in the upcoming arena mode there can be 5 ( or 10 ? ), 
  of the same hero . 
  lastly we have diablo universe battlegrounds and possibly we will have sc wc and ow universe themed maps and i think these are copies of the real things . 
  edit : broken \u00e9nglisch, 
  aaahh the bethesda approach . 
  its a bug ? 
  its a feature !, 
  ow dev team just wants the average players to feel like they are above average , which will work for some time but definitely not in the long run . 
  annoying because you dont know how to play against her . 
  i actually like to play against her . 
  well then you just failed the drafting part of the game and your team doesnt have to be `` stun heavy '' to deal with her . 
  even in qm you can expect an enemy tracer . 
  edit : a team without decent cc is a big no-no anyways, 
  dude you are overreacting this whole `` tracer is annoyingly op ruined the game gg blizz '' stuff . 
  you certainly doesnt need a 5 man of elite anti tracer gang . 
  maybe one ? 
  or you could just stay grouped and defend your backline because her strenght is flanking the enemy team ? 
  whats so unfun about her ? 
  \u25c9 \u2583 \u25d4 it was a murder !, 
  a mod did it !, 
  i can see why she could be unfun for you . 
  but i dont find her annoying or unfun at all . 
  all those qs and e are just movement abilites nothing more , it allowes tracer to escape or chase a lone player and nobody should be alone for long in this game anyway . 
  i think its very similar to the butcher effect , people just dont how to play against her . 
  why mccree is facepalming himself ? 
  its dongerous to flip alone take these \u3064 \u21e7 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 \u21e7, 
  somehow this stitches is more terrifying than the in game stitches, 
  horns !, 
  and big helmets !, 
  and even bigger shoulders !, 
  thats the holy trio of hots master skins design . 
  blizz somehow got ta make people buy that sick azmodunk skin . 
  step aside gaben there is a new gamingjesus in the town !, 
  thanks for pointing out the name , it was a good laugh, 
  ive been practicing tracer in hots all day every day . 
  im ready . 
  this sounds more depressing than it actually is . 
  looks like we have big dongs to compensate for our shitty economy . 
   haha !, 
  lets get to the pun part !, 
  ftfy, 
   you 're the best counter to minglee so far . 
  my favorite wizard stomps tracers with burst damage teleport build . 
  force armor , dominance , calamity , wave of force , cannoneer , diamond skin ( rarely firelfies ) , tal rasha 's elements is what i roll . 
  in 1v1 the tricky part against tracer is that you have to make the first move against her . 
  anyway this build heavily relies on quick fingers , critical mass , good mana management and knowing when to go in . 
   all orb, 
  thats the poking build and its better for prolonged fights . 
  also hitting tanks or minions with it doesnt do much . 
  thats what i use , except most of the time i take diamond skin instead of fireflies . 
  holy shit that thread is drowning in salt . 
  ` murican british accent is not the prettiest thing for sure . 
  [ we need superman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_death_and_return_of_superman ), 
  maybe someone from that new hearthstone mmo ? 
  brutal . 
  savage . 
  rekt . 
  absolutely burned down . 
  `` you can not burn me , i 'm already on fire ! '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ / r/raiseyourdongers / ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ leaking, 
  bad table , bad !, 
  this sounds actually good !, 
  no group finder and other sht is good + new content sounds awesome for me . 
  sou you sayin wod content could have been longer because of that ? 
  im sold . 
  * scotland is not a real country , you are an englishman wearing a dress !, 
  i have no idea what this meme is about but i giggle every time i see this shit . 
  im saving this for later use . 
  thats some fine minecraft physics right there . 
  its so old and accurate it hurts . 
  im allergic to cat fur and we have 3 cats . 
  ama . 
  hey its me ur gm, 
  in lower mmr if your nova disappears from their sight you are considered as non existent from their perspective . 
  even if it is blizz shouldnt touch this , the slugs win rate is low . 
  ^ ^ average ^ 15 to ** 25 ** ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ minute, 
  long, 
  ### matches, 
  looks like you burnt out . 
  just play a different game for a while and come back later . 
  not dying at the cost of a heroic seems an ok tradeoff for me and it definitely let abathur to play a bit more aggressive thus increasing his win rate .
