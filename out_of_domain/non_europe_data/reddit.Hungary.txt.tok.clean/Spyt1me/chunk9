  id say that comments karma will stop at -30 , anyone wan na bet ? 
  my hype is at hl3 levels , cant wait for may 3rd . 
  is it really works ? 
  oh , you know basic copy-pasting stuff ? 
  you dissertation will be much easier :d, 
  i hope this works, 
  it happened with the `` free '' tracer in hots , anyone who pre purchased the origins edition couldnt play her cuz `` you do not own this hero '' blizz solved it after an hour , i guess . 
  and now i want a jedi skin for genji , thanks man . 
  i just love all the little things you are able to do like this and this game is full of it . 
  i wasnt there in the first month , would you explain what i see ? 
  look at the statue, 
  rip expensive vr headgear , we only used you for a brief time but we will miss you greatly . 
  once i realised i was a toxic shitface i decided to change this attitude of mine . 
  i enjoy games much better now . 
  it looks like it could get 6.5 / 10 with ign, 
  thats always bothered me about hosted events , why are they letting people bring in their own keyboard , mouse , headphone etc. 
  why not just simply let them practice with the events hardware for couple of hours to get used to it ? 
  seems common sense to me but i may be wrong . 
  just imagine a scary clown reaper skin with that ultimate . 
  * hang in there *, 
  ohh ... thats so lame i have to upvote it . 
  i remember the early access open beta launch / new was so fast threads basically became comments , so yeah this sub will explode, 
  that was certainly something tho i dont know what , but it was nice i guess , maybe, 
  this video is like the essence of all russian videos , shit going on and the dude not giving a single fck . 
  thats a nice meme but it doesnt tells us anything about 19 year olds, 
  extra content in the background ( genji falling off ) : check, 
  could have been better if there is a genji ass . 
  '' ... the murderer is driving an ak47 ... '', 
  original link worked for me well but this doesnt, 
  edit . 
  mobile user, 
  got ta protect the director of warcraft vii, 
  i also think the proportions is good enough , its the depth that confuses people . 
  i dont have problems with the spread open legs ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  this image quality \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  / r/getmotivated, 
  id love to see their reactions . 
  ** hold the meme **, 
  rookie mistake , youll grow into not messing up the controls evntually . 
  even hotter when you are at work for 2 more hours because some shthead customer doesnt show up in time and we have to wait for him . 
  so thats the future version of `` big boned '' ? 
  dear reddit i have sinned . 
  i beg for forgiveness ... i. . . i supported the game and its developers by buying 10 loot crates ... i can not look into the mirror anymore and i sleep horribly since then . 
  the guilt is eating me from the inside and i dont know who im anymore , im losing track of time , my hands are shaking , all my thoughts are about this guilt . 
  please forgive me . 
  ohh im sure valve fans would appreciate that . 
  fyi you can reset the freezing debuff buildup with your shield .

  oh man just the thought of it makes me wan na eat some popcorn, 
  * dafaq did i just read ?!, 
  or in other words . 
  blizz just doubled battleborns player base . 
  blizz probably bans by hardware id so those accounts will get banned again . 
  well ... i guess its easy to get around a ban in a shitty early access free to play steam game , so thats where he got this attitude . 
  story time !, 
  `` its high - '', 
  `` we are in england , different timezone bro '', 
  `` owww dangit '', 
  that 's rough buddy . 
   dumblr,

  id still rather work more hours than sleep . 
  thanks ill try it . 
  cant wait for those gold balls for my robobirdman .

  * screams in horror *, 
  looks like zenyatta can go back hiding somewhere . 
  to deepen this topic . 
  whats the point of potg ? 
  it doesnt change the outcome of the game its just force everyone to watch a video . 
  and whats the point of viewmodel ? 
  its just blocks the view for the player . 
  also whats the point of nice graphics ? 
  its just makes harder to recognize characters , environment and its only an eyecandy . 
  and whats the point of voicelines , sprays , emotes , different skins and unnecessary noise ? 
  we should be able to hear and see the more important stuff more easily . 
  whats the point of the game then ? 
  its just a timekiller , which you have limited ammount . 
  but lets go deeper , whats the point of the fckin life ??
