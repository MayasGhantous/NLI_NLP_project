   then again , this is april 1 . 
  ftfy, 
  i think valve is more famous for their games than their `` digital rights management content distribution system '' . 
  like , you know , half-life ? 
  team fortress ? 
  counter-strike ? 
  portal ? 
  the trading card games that made valve famous . 
  [ ] ( / rtroll ), 
  haha , no , you are confusing them with left 4 dead . 
  valve has recently tried its luck in the apparel business , you know . 
  yes , i was . 
  yes you do have to adapt . 
  at least when you are speaking in english . 
  would it be better if every comment was in the commenter 's language ? 
  at least i hope i was n't the only one who played around with it for at least 10 minutes the first time i saw it . 
  yes .

  ** i 'm sorry but our servers are overloaded and you still ca n't see our logo .

  oohwhohwiw : octopus on hand while holy owls help whamming it westward, 
  mmm-hmmmm ( maybe , my mister - help me make more muffin ), 
  he got ~ ~ 7 ~ ~ 12 points from me , i 'll try to keep scoring basically the same for everyone . 
  also , feel free to post anything publicly in the comments here , guys !, 
  edit : got more data from him ; plus 5 points . 
  and congratulations , you passed my ` common sense test ' :d, 
  the car is actually green now , but other than that , good job !, 
   you love starcraft . 
  you own a ds . 
  you own at least two apple products . 
  one of them is an imac . 
  these are wrong , but nice work regardless . 
  you are in the lead at the moment . 
  30 lines of meaningful data , including address and phone number . 
  wow . 
  nope . 
   your ip address is 216.218.192.170, 
  your wow profile, 
  your car is green, 
  these were wrong . 
  also , you 've managed to break certain info into several lines , i 've only counted those once ( steam stats , for example ) . 
  sorry , antemon wins :p ( he found my alternate nick and a family member too , also had a few more links ), 
  good job anyway :d, 
  you can uncross them now , congratulations , you win :p, 
  steam code sent in pm . 
  hungarian here , yes , our language is indeed really hard , but not because of the letters ( our vowels are `` a , \u00e1 , e , \u00e9 , i , \u00ed , o , \u00f3 , \u00f6 , \u0151 , u , \u00fa , \u00fc , \u0171 '' , by the way ) . 
  the difficult part is how we use prefixes and suffixes on words :, 
   an extreme example is the longest hungarian word ` megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek\u00e9rt ' ( means ` because of your continuous pretending to be indesecratable ' . 
  this word contains mass of inflexions , prefix , suffix , etc. 
  the core of the word is ` szent ' , meaning `` saint '' . ), 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_grammar ), 
  edit : fixed a typo pointed out by sqounge . 
  edit 2 : another fix , error pointed out by ( judging by his username ) a fellow hungarian redditor , in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gnd9o/is_chinese_really_the_hardest_language_to_learn/c1ov2bd ) . 
  i think i 'll explain with an example :, 
  k\u00edn ( means ` torment ' ) is pronounced like the english word keen, 
  kinn ( means ` outside ' ) is pronounced like the english word kin ( the double n letters are unrelated ), 
  edit : oh , wait , it 's a typo :d, 
  it should be i and \u00ed ( i and \u00cd ), 
  yeah , meaning ` saint ' . 
  i did n't really know why it said ` szents\u00e9g ' , but i assumed wikipedia was correct . 
  i 'll go fix the article . 
   free, 
  sir , you are wrong . 
  my men should be at your place in approximately 4 minutes . 
  defense grid , please . 
    their ignorance is bliss ... for me ... 
   ftfy, 
  ftfy, 
  yay , i 'll try my luck here . 
  why do i deserve it ? 
  well , i 've been participating in the arg quite a lot in the last 10 days . 
  i have almost 200 edits on the arg wiki , i found a phase 2 zip file password first ( `` sweetie baby '' ) , i set up a killing floor server on my pc to investigate , and stuff like that . 
  that 's how much i 'm looking forward to portal 2 . 
  also , a week ago i installed windows alongside ubuntu to make me able to play portal 2 once it comes out , i would n't do that for just any random game :d . 
  i know that i will pirate it if i do n't get a free copy from somewhere . 
  it will make me feel bad , but i simply can not buy it - i 'm a high school student from a family that has been struck really bad by a horrible divorce case , 5 of us live in a single roomed house at the moment , but we still have to pay the rent for a much larger house we ca n't even go into . 
  all my money ( collected through years from scholarships mostly , around $ 500 ) is `` lent '' to my mother to help cover these costs . 
  however , please note that i 've already received a few games gifted from reddit . 
  and i like your generosity . 
  i think that makes it even . 
  well , dammit , reddit , why do you have people who are in even worse situations than me ? 
  basically there goes my chance to win . 
  joke aside , i vote for this guy to get it too . 
  i will , once i reach the legal working age in my country . 
  also , i am already kind of working , i manage my mom 's company 's facebook presence , i 've made a basic website for it and i am currently working on making an ecommerce site to help boost our sales . 
  also , do you think that none of [ these ] ( http://playitforward.reddit.com ) people deserve to get games ? 
  that people who are generous enough to do it are idiots ? 
  uh , okay , i 'm fine with that . 
  however , keep in mind that english is not my native language , please read through my comment history and see if my writing is fine for you , i do n't want to disappoint you . 
  if it is good enough , then pm me the details , and thank you very much !, 
  well , thank you . 
  i did actually laugh out loud at the comment you made first , to the / r/circlejerk post :d, 
  well , thanks , it 's controversial too , like with all the great artists before :d, 
  it just selling a pic ... um , a pic-sell , uh , pixel ... pixelling ... 
  i ca n't do this , replying to a guy named ` ruiningpunsubthreads ' :(, 
  nope . 
  ... even worse tasting than the ... 
  aww , yeah :d, 
  thank you very much , i 'll try to pif , though i ca n't promise it 'll be soon . 
  edit : gift received .
