  thanks yet again !, 
  yes , but you did n't write '' * a * wiki '' , you wrote `` wiki '' . 
  shorthand ? 
  this is just like saying `` web '' instead of `` website '' , just because it 's shorter . 
  or calling general motors only `` general '' . 
  \\ #potatofoolsday, 
  man , i had no idea, 
  that it would waste days, 
  i thought it was cool, 
  i wanted to help players, 
  then i could n't leave, 
  puzzles all day long, 
  two hundred wiki edits, 
  that 's what i have done, 
  when we thought it ended, 
  came the third arg phase, 
  i kept on playing, 
  we found login screens, 
  i even found a password, 
  and lots of taters, 
  with those potatoes, 
  sorry , i helped her reboot, 
  now i must save you, 
  so this is basically a raffle ? 
  i 'm in . 
  i see you played quite a lot of tf2 . 
  are you by any chance interested in [ some tf2 items ] ( http://optf2.com/underyx ) ? 
  any of these , really . 
  preferably for portal 2 , but well , just tell me what they are worth for you . 
  i originally read your comment as something that added to the discussion . 
  this community is scary . 
   '' ... a lot of good looking fellas down there and a boy band as well that have n't seen a woman in years and they 're not picky at all . 
  they do n't care if you 've got a bit of brain damage , if you 've been running around , you 've been sweating ... '', 
  i 'm so glad that i actually went back when i was asked to and i got to hear those lines :d, 
  i was n't able to buy the game on steam so i pirated the game . 
  not like i 'm proud of it , i feel really bad for doing this , but i simply could n't wait until i am able to buy a legit copy . 
  and i will get the game on steam one day , i can promise that . 
  i thought a venn diagram is a diagram that show all the possible intersections . 
  if i am right about this , the thingie you described would n't be a venn diagram . 
  * ( am i doing this right , guys ? 
  yeah , i thought so , seeing the achievement 's icon . 
  sorry , that is no sufficient proof . 
  as you can see in the title of that submission , that is a so-called `` fixed '' comic , which means he or she just took the comic of another user and slightly modified it . 
  so the submitter is not actually depicted in the rage comic , and therefore , we are unable to determine his or her gender from that submission . 
  you can just randomly say that anywhere on reddit for instant karma . 
  oh my god , it 's you . 
  [ you remember this submission of yours ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eazby.png ) ( you probably do . ), 
  well , i added you as a friend , and whenever i saw a comment of yours , i replied and deleted my comment right away for the last three months . 
  and now you just randomly reply to me . 
  edit : hey , i 'm the good guy , stop doing this to me !, 
  edit 2 : okay , by the way , that statement of mine seems to be disproved . 
  good , so the bug still is n't fixed . 
  that 's a relief . 
  i fucking love the big lebowski . 
  i fucking love the big lebowski . 
  i fucking love the big lebowski . 
  i fucking love the big lebowski . 
  alternative way to do it :, 
  let users provide the data . 
  put two buttons on the site , reddit is down and reddit is up , and if there are more ` down ' votes ( haha ) , then the day is considered to be a day of downtime . 
  that way you can get accurate data even when no announcement is posted , but , for example , there are a lots of 503 errors when commenting . 
  you are wrong , they are only a way of spreading anti-semitic messages . 
   not soon, 
  that 's the spirit , notch !, 
  on behalf of / r/minecraft : please take your time and do n't even listen to the inpatient players . 
  quality  speed of delivery . 
  i am also in , though i do n't play much civ , actually i only ever had one multiplayer game ever . 
  [ am i doing it right ? 
  i had the same problem with res and without res on ubuntu and on windows as well . 
  downgrading to the stable channel version of chrome from the dev channel one fixed it for me . 
  i had this installed since dec 2009 . 
  never caused a problem . 
  yeah , well , the plan was to only accept paypal , so we would n't store any credit card information , when i said i do n't want a professional solution , i meant that i am looking for open source/free download managers , et cetera , not paid ones . 
  thank you very much , i 'll look into that later today . 
  [ / r/gameranks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameranks/top?t=all ), 
  it 's not pc only , but it 's worth looking through . 
  i looked at do n't look at me swan :(, 
  please leave , sir , we only serve reddit hipsters here . 
  i would like to apply too . 
  uh , er , hey , you are best ... and most ... creative mod i 've on f7u12 in like , um , ever .

  [ ] ( / itstime `` yeah ?

  you can go and enjoy those penises in your mouth for a few more days , ` coz i do n't care if you are a mod . 
  and you ca n't do anything about that , right ? '' ), 
  [ ] ( / foreveralone `` this is the seriousest thing in my life at the moment :( '' ), 
  seriousest sounds like a more sad word .
