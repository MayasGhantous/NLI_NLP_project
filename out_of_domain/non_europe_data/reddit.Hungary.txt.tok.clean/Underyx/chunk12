  also , yay , i finally had a pseudo-conversation with someone . 
  yup , every . 
  every single one . 
  and still no custom css tag in sight for me . 
  [ ] ( / fap `` nah , i 've got better things to do . '' ), 
  [ ] ( / forever `` yeah , me too . '' ), 
  probably your copy of portal will be left lying around . 
  in that case , could you please send it to a friend of mine who has n't played it yet ? 
  i do n't have anything in return , but we both would really appreciate it . 
  edit : nope , looks like it 's taken :(, 
  she inarguably was n't . 
  ha , what now , drunkenjedi ? 
  [ ] ( / `` also , hopefully i will get some free karma now '' ), 
  she unquestionably was n't . 
  [ ] ( / wat `` that 's cheating '' ), 
  hey , i do n't have anything to offer , but if you could gift that copy of portal to a friend of mine for free ( since almost everyone already owns it ) , that would be awesome . 
  is there any chance that if no one wants it , you could send it to him ? 
  well , yours * is * longer ... 
  thank you so much !, 
  hey , op , i think you lost these :, 
  , , , , and, 
  do n't worry , i 'll still do it for you !, 
  for free !, 
   no * time * to pepper his foe with punctuation, 
   turn it on ** !, 
  ** turn it off ** !, 
  ** turn it on ** !, 
  ** turn it off ** !, 
  ** do n't run away ** !! ** stop ** !, 
  ** stopp spinning ** !!!, 
  later ... 
  hit me baby one more time !, 
  wow . 
  first ever hungarian reddit meetup at the lego factory ? 
  sounds like a good idea to me :d, 
  yeah that 's kind of an issue for me too . 
  maybe we should go to a local toy store instead . 
  [ context ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/ticking_bomb ) . 
  well , not much of a context , it 's not hard to understand from the image itself . 
  damn you , keanu , you are why we ca n't have nice ... explosions . 
  i did n't say i want to be . 
  though it would still be fun . 
  the thought of people talking about me , being even a tiny bit significant in the world , slightly influencing the lives of a few people is a great one . 
  the last comment i saw from him was about how he is trying to stop fapping for a week to see how it changes his personality ... that may explain it . 
  [ ] ( / okay ) yeah , i expected around 0.1 % of reddit to recognize me . 
  yeah , i see you are new around here , i was talking about [ probablyhittingonyou ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/probablyhittingonyou ) and [ sure_ill_draw_that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/sure_ill_draw_that ) , they got a damn lot of karma in their time . 
  well , the fame phoy had for example . 
  there were submissions dedicated to him , novelty accounts inspired by him , et cetera . 
  permission granted . 
  nope . 
  i even looked through your top comments , but none of them were familiar . 
  they do . 
  mostly not financial profit though , i mean [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/h7apt/is_it_possible_to_achieve_reddit_fame_slowly/c1t4hwa ) . 
  ( but then , there 's i_rape_cats , who managed to turn his fame into money on here . ), 
  well , actually it 's more like commenting early . 
  you can post the best comment of reddit ever in a 5 hour old thread , and almost no one will see it . 
  they had an eye for submissions and comments that were going to be popular , and replied to those . 
  nsfw_full_stop . 
  oh how much ... um ... fun i had with his comments . 
  well , i would consider you famous too . 
  both of them had knockoff names . 
  sidt had them too . 
  i see you play tf2 . 
  are you maybe interested in some [ tf2 items ] ( http://optf2.com/underyx ) ? 
  pick anything , and if you want to trade , we can iron out the details . 
  my guess is that it means new zealand . 
   trip on own foot ,, 
   [ ] ( / sapenguin ), 
   say `` whoops , sorry '', 
  ftfy, 
  you still get more than us hungarians . 
  ( and europeans , asians and africans in general . ), 
  yup , it was [ this episode ] ( http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1717 ) , but sadly i ca n't find a video of it . 
  but are just as separate countries from a licensing viewpoint as any other country .

  cherlady . 
  your user gives it away . 
  do they train spammers now ? 
  what ? 
  is n't the b before the a ? 
  the game takes place on a planet which is constantly moving in one direction ( downwards from the letter i ) . 
  uh , are you sure ? 
  uh , okay then . 
  that sounded really stupid . 
  come on , i think it went * okay * . 
  why ? 
  i 'm not really sure , but it probably involves some illegal stuff . 
  that made me think of how probable it is that one of the people who read this thread will die in the next month . 
  depressing . 
  team fortress 2 . 
  i 'll basically get what other companies would call sequels constantly . 
  sadly , you are 4 days late . 
  [ ] ( / lol ), 
  i always wanted one of these :(, 
  or maybe , just maybe , this is not a true story . 
  the title does n't say [ true ] after all , am i right ? 
  but ... this is reddit . 
  shhh , you are ruining it . 
  when people tell you a racist joke , do you start explaining to them that the stereotype it 's based on is not necessarily true ? 
  i believe the standard reddit response to this is ` you must be fun at parties . ',
