  [ there you go , pal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johnny_truant ), 
  just for the record , i did n't know about them before either . 
  no problem , glad to help you . 
  no offense , but you were 35 minutes late with this comment . 
  keep on trying though , and i 'm sure you 'll become a professional stalker over time !, 
  you also get a [ 4gb memory card ] ( http://www.amazon.com/transcend-class-flash-memory-ts4gsdhc6/dp/b000jmjwv2/ ) and a [ camera case ] ( http://www.amazon.com/lowepro-ridge-camera-case-black/dp/b000bn94f8 ) ( also available in blue ) for free with a purchase , worth around $ 40 . 
  no problem . 
  on an unrelated note : any news on getting new mods for the subreddit ? 
  alternatively , here 's an [ itunes link ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/rails-to-ulaanbaatar-single/id437816269 ) for you . 
  oh , and fun fact : he came up with the name ` karma sale ' completely on his own , and he knows nothing about reddit . 
  yay , feedback !, 
  well , thank you for listening to it :p, 
  also , with wobbly windows enabled , the whole border .

  non-steam games have the steam overlay enabled . 
  however , i 'm quite sure brink ca n't be activated on steam - only retail valve games can be . 
  edit : on an unrelated note , this subreddit is a good idea . 
  i 'd love to be a mod here if you need one . 
  uh , i think there might be a misunderstanding here . 
  the retail games have the multiplayer system , the matchmaking , the lobbies , etc. 
  hardcoded into them , steam can not modify that . 
  the steam overlay is the program which runs alongside the games , the one that you can bring to foreground with shift-tab , which lets you chat with steam friends and browse the web while ingame . 
  for others who were n't so lucky : [ download the free version here ] . 
  ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5550429/bumptop_free_v2.10.6225 ), 
  my first ever bittorrent upload . 
  i still love seeing all those comments . 
  okay , well , now , after a bit of googling , i 'm not sure , and i also have seven commas , right here , in this sentence . 
  it looks like brink uses steamworks for it 's backend , but i 'm quite sure the retail version does n't have complete steam integration . 
  if i were you i 'd buy it from amazon though , even if you have to register to play online , it 's not a big enough problem to pay the full , steam price . 
  but does it not increase the probability ? 
  and a nuclear power plant ? 
  oh , the logic ... it hurts ... 
  but why do you upvote it ? 
  why not just upvote the funny comment ? 
  friends do n't let friends giggle . 
  haha , you too , that was so funny . 
  great , thanks , i 'll contact you in a few days , once i have at least 2.0 in my account . 
  no , no , good idea , but i should say the opposite if i 'm against games . 
  i will tell them that even after 100 hours of playing gta , i still miss 50 % of the hookers i try to run over . 
  maybe because it is not one of his favourite features . 
  if it is n't obvious : this is the reddit is down page , cropped . 
  ( and it actually appeared instead of an ad , i did n't put it in there ), 
  it 's quite improbable that he thinks it is a bug . 
  sorry , that 's classified information , the fbi contacted me saying i should keep this a secret , based on what the element is capable of . 
  so , uh , this post was fake , i did n't actually discover anything . 
  especially not an element that creates black holes when mixed with nacl . 
  others did n't . 
  i am hungarian , and i hate it when people assume i find the joke `` you are from hungary ? 
  and are you *** hungry *** ? 
  hahahaha -- '' funny even after hearing it a few hundred times . 
  yays !, 
  [ here 's mine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/eoc6s/pif_flight_control_hd/ ) . 
  with commas ,, 
  guess what , here , in hungary , we write ten million as 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 . 
  even better , huh ? 
   hungarians only smile when they mean it . 
  there is n't much small talk between strangers , and they 're very direct when speaking ( there 's none of the nicities like `` please '' and `` thank you '' that we 've come to expect . 
  what ? 
  are you in some alternate dimension version of budapest ? 
  that 's totally the opposite of what i 've experienced here . 
  i know . 
  but still , every time a thread about hungary gets to the front page , the top voted comment is this joke . 
  followed by `` why do n't they eat some turkey ? '', 
  but it 's not only reddit , 80 % of people i meet tell me the joke when they hear where i 'm from . 
  [ maybe i 'll kill you . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/hgr7y/what_stereotypes_do_you_hate_being_associated/c1vazpf ), 
  not maybe . 
  i 'm 100 % sure i 'll kill you . 
  of course it 's not yours , it 's a wonder you could find something like this on your own , smishy . 
  edit : okay , who am i kidding , i miss you :(, 
  what hungarian spelling ? 
  also , if you are hungarian , looks like i 'm not the national comment karma champion after all . 
  well , for now at least . 
  do you perhaps happen to need 1.42 more btc ? 
  shut up . 
  i did n't challenge you . 
  okay , i did , but only because i thought it was impossible , and you were *** fully aware *** of the consequences of placing lava in smishy 's house . 
  and it was not only his house , it was the whole subway network of the town , and every wooden thingie connected to it . 
  oh , and by the way that was n't a house , it was a ** haus ** . 
  i still hate you . ^ unless ^ you ^ happen ^ to ^ be ^ kind ^ enough ^ to ^ gift ^ me ^ portal ^ 2 . 
  then i will hate you until forevertimes !, 
  i do n't really know what you mean , but come on , this is a game where letters move and talk and everything , it does n't have to be realistic . 
  try in [ / r/tipofmytongue ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue ) if you ca n't find an answer here . 
  wow , the \\ ` character does ` this ` ? 
  ( though normally i 'd agree with you . ), 
  do n't feel like a newb for not knowing , feel like a newb for not taking 30 seconds to look it up and asking here instead .
