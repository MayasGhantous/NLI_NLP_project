  [ what do *** i *** win ? 
  okay . 
  fedex ? 
  ups ? 
  mail ? 
  do you pay for the shipping ? 
  looks like no one told you an actual solution , so i 'll try now . 
  the currently top rated comment , which tells you to change the windows display language settings does n't actually change anything - when i started learning python , i had the same problem , i had the display language set to english , but still , gedit used its ( awful ) hungarian localization . 
  so , what i did instead was renaming the hungarian localization files , and it worked , gedit defaulted to english , since it could n't find the hungarian files . 
  i do n't have gedit installed anymore , so i ca n't tell you the exact path of the localization files , but they were quite easy to find , and since you said you were `` fairly computer savvy '' , i 'm sure you 'll be able to find them in the program directory on your own . 
  once you have the `` de '' directory , just rename it to '' . de '' or something , or delete it altogether . 
  well , good luck with programming , hope i could help . 
  [ ] ( / harpdarp `` oh , so it makes the food homeopathic ? 
  that 's so cool ! '' ), 
  this is the lamest argument for pirating ever . 
  seriously . 
  or was that sarcasm ? 
  hungary , 25 % . 
  do i win ? 
  also , you 'll probably need a different charger . 
  missed him like what ? 
  this is not youtube . 
  the only winning move is not to pay . 
  is that like alot ? 
  yay , she says this is the one . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  okay , [ here you go .

  umm , hey , i think i got pretty far in setting this up , but i get [ this ] ( http://pastebin.com/w8bagmxs ) when i try to run it . 
  i have an echo nest remix api key set as an environmental variable , so that probably is n't the problem . 
  also , i 'm using windows 7 . 
  could you please help me with this ? 
  oh , okay , seems like it works with a smaller song . 
  the one i used up there was over 100 mb in size , so i guess they have a size limit on the api . 
  well , thank you for both your help here , and your amazing work with the dubstepizer . 
  ( by the way , in wubwub.py line 25 the filename printed in the usage instructions , dubstepize.py , is not the current name of the program , you might want to fix that . 
  but your work is awesome regardless , of course . 
  ** edit : ** just in case someone wants to know , after a bit of audio file trimming , the size limit seems to be 50 mb .

  all right , thank you , i 'll check these links out . 
  [ oh , it 's been a while since i last linked this .

  i have 0.32 btc , i do not consider myself a representative of the bitcoin community . 
  i also think even this argument of yours is simply stupid . 
  wait , you had no other arguments . 
  never mind , then . 
  the best thing about it is how it asks [ `` do you mean khr me \u00e6kst\u00e6nsji\u00e5ns ? 
  '' ] ( http://www.bing.com/search?q=khr+me+%c3%a6kst%c3%a6nsji%c3%a5ns&amp;form=ssre ), 
  it gives you hope , saying `` hey , i think i know what you wanted me to do , and it 's right here , just click this link and everything 's gon na be awesome . '', 
  then you click it only to hear `` whoops , sorry , false alarm , i have no idea what you meant . '', 
  yeah like that will do us any good . 
  those damn top people never change anything !, 
  yes , please !, 
  okay , let me try 46 .

  does n't matter . 
  i like this . 
  why would n't the backup file 's transfer work simply through the lan ? 
  * edit : * reading hallc 's comment a second time revealed to me that, 
  he did n't mean that network transfers wo n't work . 
   the * newly * - acquired power of viewing the timestamp by hovering over `` x hours ago '', 
  well , did you know that res had that feature for months now ? 
  so , logically , he does n't care about mods . 
  at all . 
  hey , i would really appreciate a starcraft 2 guest pass . 
  thanks !, 
  really ? 
  i pin the tabs that are open all day . 
  just right click on them and select `` pin tab '' , saves a lot of space and they will automatically open every time you start chrome . 
   sure , let me check the exchange rate . 
  that 's 1.23 btc . 
  our address is abdf2341234 ... '' wait . 
  i have to punch this in on a touchscreen ... ok . 
  could be solved with a qr code for the address , with a matching bitcoin app that can read qr codes . 
  if the merchant has a screen to display the qr code on , the computer could automatically calculate the price from the current exchange rate and embed it in the qr code as well . 
  uh , are you sure ? 
  i think it might have been either that your miners found shares , but you thought they were blocks . 
  they are completely different , usually a pool finds more than a million shares before actually finding a block . 
  or maybe the pool itself found blocks and you thought your cpus did , which means that one of the ~ 1000 pcs on mtred found a block , and you got a small share of the reward amount the block yielded , probably less than 0.0001 btc . 
  well there 's already a standard for textual markup of transaction data , i do n't think anyone would use a different one , so that 's not really a problem . 
  i 'm not sure about this , but i think yes . 
  a long poll notification , from my guess , is a message from the pool to the miner that a new block was found , so the miner knows it should start working on a new one . 
  your miner displayed one of these . 
  i think . 
  ah , it 's all clear now , he 's waiting for someone to try and gift terraria to schrnkuk 's, 
  account , but since he is in control of the gifter 's target , the schrnkuk reddit, 
  account , he can simply give that generous person a link to his [ alternate steam ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/dvir_m ), 
  account . 
  and then , to his joy , happiness and whatnot , after the schrnkuk, 
  account gets terraria from a generous gifter on reddit , he 'll be able to sell that, 
  account with its 58 games ( with terraria ) , for a copy of spacechem to his main steam, 
  account . 
  i hope that i could identify all of his shenanigans , and could write an accurate, 
  account of what happened/was going to happen here . 
  so , redditors , please take this into, 
  account before trying to help out that shady figure there . 
  fast forward 5 months ; now even the witty comments are gone . 
  fun fact : that comment started out with me trying to create an elaborate story and making an m night shayamayalwhatshisname joke , but halfway through i saw that i used the word ` account ' way too often , and memes are n't that funny anyway , so i tried to find some use for the text i already typed in to avoid losing all that work , and came up with this idea . 
  seems like it is a bit successful , but i 'd rather not clutter reddit with a `` onewordstartsthelines '' novelty account so that 's it , folks .
