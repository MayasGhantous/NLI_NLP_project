  fun fact # 2 : i checked the reddit name character limit to make sure the name i type is too long to be actually registered by someone to make a `` hey , it 's okay , i registered it instead of you '' joke . 
  to be honest , i have never heard that before . 
  i ca n't even imagine what it could sound like in hungarian . 
  i did almost everything i found . 
  except for transcribing . 
  i did 700 hits in total , so it 's around 6 cents a hit , they were n't that serious tasks . 
  alright , i bought one of the items , and i wish her a very , very happy birthday . 
  i sure hope you 'll post a some followup submission after july 26 , though :p, 
  [ this way ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/submit ) , please . 
  pretty please . 
  thanks a lot , that would be awesome , however i have around $ 10 less since then , i bought a birthday gift for [ this redditor 's daughter ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/assistance/comments/ina4i/help_for_birthday_girl_please_read/ ) , so you should keep the price below 34 usd . 
  also , i suggest that you create a wishlist , that way you can easily send me the exact items you want , and you do n't have to give me your address , amazon will know where to ship it if you tell them where you live . 
  thank you again , and send me a pm with your wishlist once you have one !, 
  it would work for me , but that would take a lot of time and i 'm not sure if you are willing to wait until next wednesday ( my bank account is basically empty , paypal can not be used to pay on amazon , and withdrawing money from paypal to my bank account takes 2-3 business days . ), 
  if that 's alright with you , then sure , we can do that . 
  though , unfortunately , i forgot about the cost of shipping - the gift i bought before was actually 17 usd with shipping , so now my balance is $ 27.52 , and amazon has free shipping for orders over 25 dollars , so i think it would be best if you could make a wishlist within the price range of $ 25 - $ 27.52, 
  i 'm still working on mturk though , and if i 'm lucky i 'll be able to get one or two more dollars on that balance , so if you find something for say , $ 28 , i might be able to buy it . 
  god , i 'm sorry it 's starting to get this inconvenient for you :d, 
  all right , thanks anyway !, 
  actually , they totally do, 
  oh , oh , i 'm an idiot , actually , i can buy you a gift card which you can use against your order , though probably you already ordered yourself . 
  so , just in case , if you still need me to , i can send you a $ 60 gift card . 
  uh , do you want to buy it ? 
  that would be real awesome . 
  though keep in mind that i 'm not sure if it plays legit cartridges like some of these clones do . 
  ah , and regarding the price ; well , make me an offer , i do n't really have a price set at the moment , i 'll ask around and sell it to the highest bidder . 
  yes , it works basically like a console , you plug the power adapter in , you connect it to a tv ( though it 's not using standard ports , you have to plug it into an antenna slot on the tv ) and you can inster a cartridge and play that game . 
  the controller has a d-pad , start/select , and 6 more buttons - a , b , which act like expected , c , which acts like a+b pressed at the same time , and x , y , z , which are turbofire buttons for a , b and c , respectively . 
  i 'll try to get you a gamelist , snapping a photo of all the cartridges . 
  the `` official '' artwork on the cartridges is not always showing the right game , but my dad labelled almost all of them back then . 
  there is one cartridge that does n't work at all , there are cartridges that need a few resets to start properly , and there are cartridges that have more than one game on them , those either choose a game to start randomly on each reset , or have a game select menu at startup . 
  the cartridges are [ all famicom-style ] ( http://www.nomorelives.com/images/5.jpg ) . 
  what ? 
  no way . 
  i just went onto one of the leading video game store 's webpage , an average new console game costs 16000 huf , our minimum wage is 78000 huf/month , and that is ... wait , * what ? 
  ... i ca n't believe you were actually right . 
  edit : to make the same calculation as in the op , with a 48-hour long working week ( which is the eu limit ) , we get 400 huf/hour , which makes the game need 40 hours of work . 
  uh , so it is n't that bad , after all . 
  here 's a bot that should be able to help you help even more : [ http://wiki.df.dreamhosters.com/wiki/ricemaker] ( / ), 
  strange , to it seems like a nes itself is worth around 20 usd , and at least $ 3 per game . 
  ( of course those are all original . ), 
  it was a task on [ amazon 's mechanical turk ] ( http://www.mturk.com ) . 
  yes , and that 's part of the joke . 
  no , you insert the gender . 
  it 's gentlefemale . 
  well , do n't say that to me , that 's an error on joniblyth 's part . 
   gta 4 on pc is a terrible port , it takes alot to run it . 
  yup , you need to buy one of these and put it in your laptop : http://i.imgur.com/6putt.jpg, 
  why , thank you , [ he 's here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ccnzy.png ) . 
  dude , * whoa * . 
  i think you might have just failed in delivering the worst pun ever thought of by man . 
  i mean , no capitalization , no punctuation , using a secondary meaning of the word ` hungry ' ( not hunger for food ) , using a word that does n't even sound like the word hungry that much and , of course , multiply that all with this being the lamest joke ever . 
  that takes some skill , man .

  also , there 's lots of neat content in [ / r/bestof ] ( / r/bestof ) , [ / r/depthhub ] ( / r/depthhub ) and [ / r/truereddit ] ( / r/truereddit ) . 
  but which canada should i take ? 
  do they make you leave the ? 
  out ? 
  whoa , i really appreciate how much effort you put into this comment and how clearly you explained those types of accelerometers . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  no , it does n't use image comparison , that way how would it know if it 's pointed towards the tv or not ? 
  it detects the position of the sensor bar ( which contains 10 leds that only cameras can see ) , sends back where it saw the leds to the wii via bluetooth , and the wii calculates where the wiimote was pointed based on the position of the leds . 
  how do motion sensors work ? 
  just for comparison : i have about ... 25 days worth of online play time in tf2 and it only cost me $ 2.5 for the game and 44 extra maps ( not counting the non-official ones ) . 
  that works out to about 0.4 cents per hour of entertainment . 
  and *** that *** is how you do dlc . 
  it 's [ endgame : singularity ] ( http://www.emhsoft.com/singularity/ ) . 
  please reply to that comment of mine with `` solved '' so that a checkmark gets placed beside the title of this submission to let people know you 've found the answer . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's dangerous to go, 
  alone !, 
  take these . 
  why could n't they push that line one character to the left ? 
  are you sure they are similar ? 
  i think they are completely different , suabt is for impossible/nonexistant items , only to make you think ` huh , that would be cool ' , while suamt is to make you think ` huh , i have to make myself one of those ' . 
  suabt is for the dreamers , suamt is for the ... uh , acters ? 
  what 's the word for that again ? 
  hey there , it 's been 5 days since july 26th , would you mind letting us donators know how it went ? 
  maybe upload some photos ? 
  great , thanks a lot !,

  yeah , that 's my favorite part , too . 
  i 'm 16 and i used turbo buttons a lot . 
  did n't know what they did back then , though . 
  how do you benefit from doing all this if the profit goes to 100 different people but not you ? 
  oh wait , probably you have a salary as the manager . 
  if so , who determines your salary ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  though , could you please go into detail on how different frequencies work ? 
  it probably ca n't really be explained much better on a 5 year old 's level , but i hope the subreddit will be okay with a bit more technical explanation on this . 
  could you maybe get them to do an ama ? 
  i originally meant the state of matter plasma , but this turned out to be just as interesting , so thank you !, 
  what is the name of its gnome equivalent ? 
  is that metacity ? 
  but we gain some ~ ~ more ~ ~ additional intelligent users , which will hopefully help drive the quality of reddit up again . 
  edit : changed a word to make my point a bit more clear . 
  college students are almost certainly better than the high schoolers who are swarming reddit now . 
  yeah , i was hoping that all those new college student users , who were basically the main demographic of the good old reddit , would understand how they can control the content on reddit with their votes , and they would probably have a much better sense of quality than the younger users who upvote uninteresting stuff .
