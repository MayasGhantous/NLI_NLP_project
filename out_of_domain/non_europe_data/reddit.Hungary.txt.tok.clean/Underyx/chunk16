  the more mature the userbase is , the less of those `` this . '', 
  and `` i laughed . '', 
  comments will get the top spots . 
  i hope . 
  i am 16 now . 
   i care very much about the karma any given post of mine gets , but only relative to the discussion it 's in . 
  first i wanted to reply with `` for me , even individual karma score is starting to become unimportant . '', 
  but now that i think of it , that 's not completely true , it 's important to me in an indirect way . 
  my lack of social life is why i am on reddit all day , and at the first glance karma seemed to be the way to go if i wanted some validation . 
  i even karmawhored for a bit , see for example [ my top rated submission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fbelw/dear_steam_i_cant_thank_you_enough_for_doing_this/ ) , but then i started to realize that karma is not what i need - i need orangereds . 
  i see a lot of easy karma opportunities , but i do n't use them , instead , i try to be more communicative with redditors . 
  there were cases where i started discussions with people in months old submissions , which i know almost no one will see . 
  according to metareddit.com i have 1100 comments , while i_rape_cats has 1500 . 
  my karma only affects me if i am trying to start a new discussion and get a lot of replies , and this turned out to be even better for me , as i am less hesitant to state a controversial opinion of mine . 
   how 'm i gon na talk underwater ? 
  huh ? 
  i 'm sorry , is that correct ? 
  i am really glad to see how well it went , and kit is simply adorable . 
  well , best of luck to you in the future , and take care !, 
  how does a bundle come together ? 
  does the humble bundle staff contact the developers , or is it the reverse situation ? 
  how viable do you think selling your game as pay what you want from release is ? 
  ( i think proun is being sold like that , for example . ), 
  how strict are the drm-free and cross platform rules of your bundle ? 
  do you think you 'll ever make a bundle which has a steam-only game , for example ? 
  how do you think major publishers are affected by your bundles ? 
  did they learned anything from them ? 
  will they change anything because of your success ( more cross-platform games/less drm/etc . ), 
  can you share some site statistics ? 
  how much of your traffic is from facebook/twitter/reddit / digg ? 
  what 's the weirdest or funniest thing someone said on support chat ? 
  edit : & nbsp ; also , & nbsp ; [ confirmed & nbsp ; on & nbsp ; twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/humble/status/99164075921125377 ) . 
  & nbsp ; ^ & nbsp ; ^ edit & nbsp ; 2 : & nbsp ; one & nbsp ; more & nbsp ; question !, 
  & nbsp ; ^ & nbsp ; ^ edit & nbsp ; 3 : & nbsp ; sorry & nbsp ; i 'm & nbsp ; editing & nbsp ; this & nbsp ; much , & nbsp ; but & nbsp ; three & nbsp ; more & nbsp ; questions & nbsp ; popped & nbsp ; into & nbsp ; my & nbsp ; mind . 
  & nbsp ; ^ & nbsp ; ^ edit & nbsp ; 4 : & nbsp ; you & nbsp ; might & nbsp ; be & nbsp ; better & nbsp ; off & nbsp ; just & nbsp ; ignoring & nbsp ; this & nbsp ; comment & nbsp ; for & nbsp ; the & nbsp ; next & nbsp ; few & nbsp ; hours , & nbsp ; i 'm & nbsp ; editing & nbsp ; it & nbsp ; like & nbsp ; crazy & nbsp ; ( 6th & nbsp ; question ) . 
  can you list some games that you really wanted in a bundle but could n't include in the end ?

  it 's quite scary how this comment has 939 downvotes listed , 1877 votes in total ( though this number is probably fake , i 'm not really sure ) and the kleinbl00-bashing reply has 7 upvotes , 10 votes in total . 
  if we assume that these numbers are real , and that 75 % of the people voting on kleinbl00 's comment vote on the reply as well if they see it , we can calculate that only 0.7 % of the redditors who have voted on kleinbl00 's comment have actually read these comments . 
  * more than 99 % of reddit does not care about the discussion . 
  this is a complete disaster . 
  what has reddit become ? 
  you guys used to care about content . 
  now it 's all nonsense . 
  kleinbl00 writes apologies , insightful comments on what actually happened , and you do what ? 
  downvote them to the very bottom . 
  the following comments have been rated better than the indepth report on this incident by the `` culprit '' himself : [ `` op is a fag . 
  '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/favors/comments/j8u7z/request_identify_the_mod_responsible_for_this_and/c2a56p1 ) ; [ `` who the fuck are you to question mods you fucking nobody go back to your rock you cocksucker '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/favors/comments/j8u7z/request_identify_the_mod_responsible_for_this_and/c2a461m ) ; and so on , i think i 'm too lazy to find any more of these . 
  i , for one , actually support kleinbl00 - i believe that reddit is starting to become a chaotic mess , and the only way to stop that from happening is letting moderators actually take action against people who are not even trying to follow the rules . 
  he probably had his reasons . 
  he is not an idiot , he does n't do stuff that is completely wrong . 
  are you sure you followed all the rules of the subreddit ? 
  this is starting to become really pathetic . 
  you say that this is justified , and * is not a witch hunt * ? 
  [ see this comment of mine , please ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/drunkenjedi/comments/il4c7/what_is_karma/c2a7thk?context=1 ) . 
  if it 's too long for you to read , the point is : reddit is mindlessly downvoting everything from kleinbl00 . 
  they do n't care how much his comment helps them , or anyone . 
  they do n't care how true his comment is . 
  they ** do n't even read ** the comments . 
  they just assume it 's bad , and vote away , completely ignoring the reddiquette . 
  and now , you do n't see how much value kleinbl00 's moderation has brought to reddit . 
  how removing him will only make things worse . 
  you just , again , assume that it 's all bad , and you just write down your verdict without considering the other side of the story . 
  alright , my opinion is that we do n't have to be nice with people who do n't even read the rules , moderators should be more strict with the users , if people like you and people like me will group into different communities as a result of this - even better . 
  for everyone . 
  what is realistic in this ? 
  it has only two colors and the game itself is made of three lines and a dot . 
  since when do we call this realistic ? 
  edit : okay , sorry for coming out of character , but honestly , back in the day , who the hell called the graphics of pong `` realistic '' ? 
  steam : underyx, 
  thank you !, 
  last.fm is not free . 
  ( at least outside the usa ), 
  okay , i 'll put it this way : last.fm is not free in most of the world . 
  but is n't the point of this subreddit that we pretend we people from the past ? 
  if we were actually someone from the past , then we would n't say pong 's graphics are realistic . 
  only people who have seen the future , who know how graphics of games are going to get more and more realistic over time would act like the same pattern applies to pong and would call it realistic . 
  but i must be wrong somewhere here , since i was downvoted . 
  and i do n't know what 's the flaw in my logic . 
  anyone ? 
   it 's more like they 're currently in the process of screwing u, 
  oh , and what is that `` u '' you are speaking of ? 
  i ca n't answer this question . 
  try another one . 
  wait , so the sightlines ( uh , do n't know if such a word exists , but you get the point ) from our eyeballs are completely parallel to each other ? 
  actually , this video reminded me of meet the heavy quite a lot . 
  first video ? 
  check .
