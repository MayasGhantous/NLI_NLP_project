  russian accent ? 
  check . 
  being , uh , heavy ? 
  check . 
  i 've also created a subreddit for similar screenshots : [ / r/googleunrelated ] ( / r/googleunrelated ) . 
  we might see a lot more like this . 
  i 'm hoping they will manually invite a list of `` important '' people as well . 
  i mean , i would probably seem important at first glance seeing how i have a community knife and a wiki cap in tf2 ( both undeserved , to be honest , but they do n't have to know that ) . 
  read the second line at the top . 
  thanks a lot , though i already [ listen to them ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/underyx ) as well . 
  solved, 
  thanks a lot , i think this is the original , i googled around for half an hour and found nothing , which would be explained by how this picture was n't actually on a webcomic/blog where some related text would have made finding it easier . 
  thanks again !, 
  [ it 's this one ] ( http://basicinstructions.net/basic-instructions/2011/8/2/how-to-care-for-your-smartphone.html ) . 
  edit : reddit thread [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/j816e/how_to_care_for_your_smartphone/ ) . 
  alright , i did that . 
  but why ? 
  oh , okay , i assumed that, 
  1 ) other people are n't interested in what the original picture was , they only want to know if it 's been found, 
  2 ) this would n't get into the top let 's say 200 on the main page , therefore every redditor can see the checkmark, 
  fun fact : ninite actually clicks the `` install this toolbar ? '', 
  checkbox to uncheck it in a hidden installer window when it is installing stuff . 
  please excuse my lack of proficiency in the english language , for i am not a native speaker . 
  could you perhaps give me an example of a word or expression that would be more appropriate than the one i had used ? 
  that would be a remarkable suggestion , if it were n't for the fact that the word ` clicked ' does n't quite convey how i repeatedly pressed the button without thinking about what it does and how it would affect my future . 
  my apologies . 
  hearing the word ` mashed ' with the following ( widely accepted ) [ definition ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=button%20masher ) had led me to believe that it would be a suitable word for this particular title - however i can completely understand if this word came off as weird for you in this context , i would be glad to edit the title to contain a more fitting expression mentioned by you , but alas , reddit seems to lack this feature , rendering me unable to correct my silly mistake . 
  the card game part makes no sense - why are hearts and diamonds preferable to clubs and spades at the beginning , but not at the end of the game ? 
  but the image/quote suggests that this is always true , not just in one single scenario . 
  also , i ca n't think of any case where a player would aim for having different suits in poker . 
  [ / r/somebodycodethis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/somebodycodethis ) is a more software centered one . 
  wait ... so two 60 gb ssds are cheaper than one 120 gb one ? 
   ocz vertex plus oczssd2-1vtxpl120g 2.5 '' 120gb ** sata ii ** mlc solid state drive, 
  nope , sorry . 
  that was the first thing i did as well . 
  wow , the lack of funniness in this comment and the generally unoriginal content in your comment history made me feel ashamed to live in the same country as you . 
  come on , man , seriously , stop this . 
  no , they ca n't possibly be too stupid to communicate , i was n't implying that at all , i was only trying to suggest him to stop relying on memes so much . 
  i 'm sorry if that came off as harsh , [ name of reddit user i may have insulted ] . 
   if we used my method , how many would want to bail out criminal banksters , give fifty billion-dollar kick-backs to defense contractors , and criminalize smoking a plant ? 
  [ ] ( / con ) it would be even easier for corporations to bribe representatives if they were not as rich as they are now , the average citizen does not care very much about politics , so they would just vote for the benefit of the corporation that gave them 5 bucks each . 
  what is that system ? 
  ( sorry , i 'm not from the us , we do n't even have jury duty here . ), 
  hey , drunkenjedi . 
  i will really miss you . 
  and i mean that , really . 
  i 've always looked at you as if you were my amazing uncle who always does the most wonderful things ( gob bluth ? ) . 
  i greatly enjoyed helping you out with the `` useless comments that get upvoted '' list , [ this conversation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/h68io/all_comics_combined_into_one_this_cant_fail/c1sw4e6 ) , and my other few encounters with you . 
  and do you know why ? 
  i was trying to impress you . 
  weird , i know , but it 's true , you were the most important person on reddit for me . 
  anyway , now , after this little confession from me , good luck moving on with your life from reddit , and thanks for your ... presence . 
  & nbsp ; ^ * whoa & nbsp ; that & nbsp ; was & nbsp ; weird *, 
  i have n't even clicked the link , but based on the title i think i might need to point out this sentence from the sidebar of this subreddit :, 
   for funny things that maybe require a little bit more thought than over at / r/funny . 
   fml, 
  okay , this made me read your comment like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwn9b.jpg ) . 
  is this an experiment to see how far will redditors go in trying to analyze a few random strings ? 
  ( by the way it probably has no significance , but the third one , which was deemed `` yup . '', 
  by dj in the comment area is a valid reddit submission id for [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/arnga/my_neighbor_moved_out_this_is_what_i_found_on/ ) link . ), 
  emm-see guy-where ? 
   4-evah + evah = = 5 evah, 
  uh , no , 4 minus evah plus evah is simply 4 . 
  yay , thank you for the suggestion , never even heard of them . 
  i highly doubt that i 've ever seen a reddit comment that improved the quality of my life as much as this one from you . 
  thank you , thank you , very much . 
   ** ah ** , ** you 're ** right . 
  ** it 's ** just ** that ** the person with the buds ** gets ** more if they trade via hats . 
  come on ...

  yes , i am honestly interested in an ama from you . 
  however , i wo n't have internet access for the next 4 days - if you do one , could you please reply to my comment with a link to it so that i wo n't forget about this once i get home ? 
  thank you !,

  is it fake ? 
  i 'm sorry , i did n't check it myself . 
  yeah , well , a few of us are willing to take the chances , naturally you are free to use a private tracker if you are concerned . 
  but thanks for the warning anyway !, 
  but hashing methods used in computing have a much lower probability for a false match than simply adding up the numbers , right ? 
  oh , md5 is one of the most popular algorithms , is it not ? 
  does this vulnerability cause many problems ? 
  what 's a good alternative , and why do people use md5 instead of that if this is the case ?

  sorry to break it to you , but once chrome auto-updates to a new major version on your pc , this function will disappear and your address bar will revert to normal .
