  no , it would n't . 
  if it was limited to 5-10 questions , it could only guess a significantly lower amount of characters . 
   i like the replies.txt idea to avoid being bot detected . 
  oh , i left the comment in for replies.txt , but i deleted the code for that since i could n't get it to correctly load accented characters - how do i do that ? 
  ( the character ' \u00f6 ' showed up as ' \\ xc3 \\ xb6 ' , et cetera . ), 
   maybe null check the feed before iterating over it ? 
  i 'm sorry , i have no idea what that means - you mean i should check if the json data was correctly retrieved ? 
  or what is ` null checking ' ? 
   if i knew anyone that used it , i would instantly retract my birthday wishes and de-friend them for being a lazy fuck . 
  yeah , well , the thing is , i personally thank people who i know to actually care about my birthday , but most of the people who write on one 's wall for their birthday do it only because facebook notifies them , and i do n't really care if they de-friend me . 
  well , thank you very much for your help !, 
  thanks , that 's an awesome idea . 
   for those interested in watching the complete playthrough go here . 
  i do n't recall that stream being a complete playthrough of the game , more like just skimming over all the games and `` levels '' in it :d, 
  \u00af \\ \\ ( \u30c4 ) / \u00af [ & nbsp  ( http://anothhiddenlink.com/yay ), 
  who gave you that ? 
  and why ? 
  you just guessed the name of my arch-nemesis right , congratulations !, 
  now please do n't ever call me daniel again . 
  thanks . 
  lucy ? 
  oooh , do i win something ? 
  am i the second correct guesser of the subreddit ? 
  oooh , awesome , now if only someone got my name [ over here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guessmyfirstname/comments/kud8s/well_have_a_guess_at_my_first_name/ ) . 
  nope , sorry :(, 
  actually , no one was even close so far . 
  no , no , sorry , i meant that i might be the second person to correctly guess one name in this subreddit . 
  also , thank you :d, 
  mike made the papercraft companion cube for my birthday . 
  but sorry , no . 
  how does `` best percentage growth '' work ? 
  to me it seems r/aisd has basically no competition since they had 0 subscribers and gained 1 so far . 
  patrick gave me the t-shirt for my last birthday - but still , no one got my name . 
  ohh , i 'm sorry , i did n't think there were people still visiting this thread . 
  well , 3 people got the first letter right , and 3 different names in the comments have the correct number of letters . 
  why did you have to check your mailman to get the game ? 
  tiffany ? 
  yup , you do need to put a disclaimer , tifa . 
  portal and ben really do fit each other , just saying . 
  i think you should try installing [ this ] ( http://thiscommentlookslike.it/ishelpful/whenviewedonmyuserpage ) instead . 
  if this is a raffle , i am in . 
  edit : looks like it was actually a raffle - and i won !, 
  thank you very much , dylan_dev !, 
  ( the key worked perfectly . ), 
  wait , there actually was a subreddit dedicated to an experiment like this , or are you talking about the original / r9k / ? 
  if it 's the latter , well , that 's where i got the idea from , i am curious how the concept would work on reddit . 
  my god , it is full of stars !, 
  * now if only someone got this reference to a 7 months old reddit subthread . 
  these jokes are [ familiar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyung5mttd8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=160s ) . 
  and there are processes for extensions as well . 
  press shift-esc while in chrome to open chrome 's built-in process manager and see exactly what processes are running . 
  he could have , but he did n't . 
  alright , perfectly understandable . 
  thanks for hearing me out , and generally for your awesome work with res . 
  well , that is not right ... 
  edit : oh , it probably looked at the text spelling it out letter by letter since it was in all caps . 
  not really , capital letters are usually used for abbreviations/acronyms , for example `` usa '' is three syllables when pronounced , `` ama '' is also three , et cetera . 
  so it does actually make sense . 
  wifi is older than the internet ? 
  `` who cares '' ? 
  well , excuse me , but you did n't only check , but you took the time to mention this in a comment as well . 
   insanity mom : hides bill in 19 parts . 
  that 's more like it . 
  i stole all the kindles from one of amazon 's warehouses , and they sent me a new one . 
  i do n't even exist , they sent me a new one . 
  contact amazon and they will probably send you a kindle instead . 
  just by the way , i recently heard that sound as the jingle of some production company at the end of some cartoon , so it 's not actually a software-y sound . 
  like , with time travel and stuff you mean , right ? 
  oh god , your eyebrows are *** below *** your eyes !, 
  oooh , do an iama !, 
  `` my eyebrows are below my eyes , ama '' - that would be like the most interesting submission in the last month . 
  nope , this is too long to be it , she says the whole episode was around 2 minutes long , but thanks anyway !, 
  yes , yes , yes !, 
  thank you * soooo * very much !, 
  call me a fool , but i trust redditors with high karma enough to be willing to order in advance , and get the payment only once the package is shipped . 
  i would be very grateful if you decided to do this for me :d, 
  i 'd prefer going a bit over , but i only have around 3 or 4 dollars in my bank account , so you might need to send me the difference via paypal in advance if that 's what we are going with . 
  also , keep in mind that shipping costs will be added when ordering , so you should calculate the total cost to be around 50 with that included . 
  actually , i 'm totally fine with anything , so just pm me a link to your wishlist and i 'll order the items right away for you . 
  stolen almost word for word [ from this mlia post ] ( http://mylifeisaverage.com/s/279808/ ) from two years ago . 
  i 'm not sure if it will work , and i 'm too lazy to test it myself , but maybe [ this chrome extension ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ajjgiajaoafimgkdlcofflenackmpjhd ) will solve your problem . 
  if it 's sideways , the smooth side goes on the side where the motherboard 's top is facing . 
  if it 's sideways , the usb symbol goes on the side where the motherboard 's top is facing . 
  i have three packs of them in my kitchen at the moment , and , actually , i do n't know anyone who does n't have at least one at home at all times . 
  seriously , hungarians love negros . 
  edit : * okay * , there 's one guy who told me now he does n't have any at home . 
  and he hates them . 
  weird . 
  well , i thought most people on reddit know which way their motherboard faces . 
  even if you do n't , some common sense can help you figure it out - the top probably faces the center of the pc case , the bottom should be closer to the side of the case . 
  also , you can just try plugging something in and then remembering which way you had to plug it in and/or which way the motherboard faces . 
  not that hard , really . 
   bro 2 : `` oh not much , sitting on my computer . '', 
  did anyone else just imagine a bro sitting on a computer and telling another bro about this ? 
  why ca n't i think of ideas this awesome ? 
  i demand reddit to do this right now . 
  * riiiight now . 
  i have never seen a sideways usb port on a laptop : /, 
  would n't be that hard if he is around 6 now . 
  i would also add [ gorillaz - amarillo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iktnavaqakk ) and [ gorillaz - revolving doors ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h58x-4xfnty ) .
