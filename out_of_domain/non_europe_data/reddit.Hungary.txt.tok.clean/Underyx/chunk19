  i do n't think spammers would need res to do their business . 
  oh , thank you for that , really !, 
  that 's great , i 'm glad you like it , thanks !, 
  aww , you are welcome , man :d, 
  oh , great idea , actually , thanks for that . 
  got ta love / r/trees . 
  okay , let 's see [ how it goes over there ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/n7of4/heres_some_chill_out_music_made_by_my_dad_rtrees/ ) . 
  thanks for this idea again !, 
  like in that game by blizzard ? 
  no , the one with charizard . 
  he makes all his music with propellerhead reason . 
  it 's normal in hungary as well , but our krampusz is portrayed more like a , i do n't know , cute monster , similar to likable villains in children 's stories whose plans always go wrong , et cetera . 
   d' x, 
  please tell me that is not what i think it is . 
  due to lack of hard drive space , for example . 
  i have my entire music library in mp3 . 
  ** in 128 kbps mp3 !, 
  ** * muhahaha ~ *, 
  edit : of course , if anyone were to buy me a new hdd , i 'd gladly start using flac instead :p, 
  that 's awesome , thanks !, 
  everyone ,,

  [ proof . 
  [ no need to do that .

  ** those ** are some * weird * choices & nbsp ; ^ for formatting ~ ~ that ~ ~ *** text *** . 
  find regex \\ d : \\ d \\ d , if it 's present in the title , skip calling the function for adding the timecode . 
  and by the way , the feature is already added to the development version of res , was n't that hard . 
  which meme does ? 
  well , that is a fortunate turn of events . 
  i guess we all won something , laughter for me , crapped pants for you , yay !, 
  edit : ` turn of ' was missing , argh . 
  how did i do that ? 
  actually , above this 0 inches line the correct size was written in centimetres . 
  probably they just use a static html template and edit the data by hand for every new phone . 
  okay , though i 'm not sure if this is the system they are using . 
  also , their service is awesome , but of course i know that does n't make up for static html :d, 
  [ screenshot . 
  and you are downvoted as well . 
  thanks !, 
  yup , and countless others . 
  the ` bottle episode ' , the conspiracy theory episode , the documentary episodes , et cetera, 
  cow of duty ? 
  [ this might be sufficient . 
  ] ( http://metareddit.com/stalk ), 
  i 'll give you 6 for it , if you still have the game . 
  i still have greed corp , but i already bought orcs must die myself . 
  what else can you offer ? 
  i love you too . 
  okay , add me on steam : [ underyx ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/underyx ), 
  if he thought his thumb was broken , why did he say he was going to be fine in a few minutes ? 
  and it was successful , too !, 
  well , ai n't that awesome ? 
  ~ ~ what about 3 for flight control hd , 6 for greed corp and 8 if you take both ? ~ ~, 
  edit : both gone , sorry . 
  i 've started working at the age of 16 and earned over 200 usd with no problems . 
  i used payment via amazon gift certificates though , due to region restrictions . 
  i guess it did n't ask for it since i 'm not american and they could n't check hungarian ids , you can just tell them you are not from the usa and register - however , i suggest you still choose an english speaking country , like canada or the uk , since a lot of the tasks are region-restricted to these countries .

  how would that ` metabolization of toxins ' work ? 
  could the leech ( assuming that the alcohol does no harm at all to it ) just remove the alcohol from the blood it stores and leave the clean blood to be consumed for the following months ? 
  well , according to my high school teacher , it can take up to a year . 
  also if you want a tad more truthworthy source ( which you probably do ) , [ wikipedia says the following ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leech#digestion ) :, 
   the crop allows a leech to store blood up to five times its body size , and , because the leech produces an anticoagulant , the stored blood remains in a liquid state ; because of this ability to hold blood without the blood decaying , due to bacteria living inside the crop , medicinal leeches need to feed only twice a year .

  i would have paid up to around 130 % of the base price for recettear . 
  and you could ca n't even write that as `` that strikes me bits odd . '', 
  and why is that funny ? 
  404 is n't really related to server overload .

  well , you know what they say - ` knowledge is power , france is bacon . ', 
  sadly , it 's a usa-only site , so you 'll need an alternative payment method for international supporters . 
  well , then i 'm saying , if we set up an online pac store , it ca n't use dwolla since it 's a usa-only site . 
  i just assumed there would n't really be american purchases since they can just directly donate to the pac ( via dwolla or whatever else ) and do n't need to buy merchandise to do so . 
  well , you know , imgur automatically purges all exif metadata from all uploaded images , so it would be kinda hard for it to have a photoshop signature . 
  yeah , well , i wish it good luck telling it 's a photoshop from the pixels . 
  okay , updated op with an i3-2100 . 
  what about that ? 
  also , i keep hearing how much good an ssd does for load times and stuff , thought it would be worth it . 
  i have no idea , actually . 
  i look forward to reading every new xkcd , and can spend hours re-reading old comics , so i checked out smbc , as i saw it suggested for xkcd fans all over the intertubes , but in the last year , i read only around 30 of it , and whenever i see a new smbc come up in google reader i just say `` meh , i 'll skip this one . '', 
  you basically just copied the title of the submission and currently stand at a score of +3 . 
  come on , guys .
