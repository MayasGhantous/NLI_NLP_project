  you 've just taken an awful lot of hours from my life , hope you know that . 
  but it 's in the name of our mighty lord , so , ` ts fine . 
  all hail lord inglip !, 
  i will ensure the nonbelievers are kept at bay by my own very hands , as sung by erivandi . 
  edit 2 : being celebrated by the believers of the dectrip faith is just as awesome as skyrim . 
  really . 
  i had the same dreams as forthewolfx - being internet famous - and now i 've taken my first step !, 
  hey , i would accept . 
  thank you !, 
  is there any case where looping the buffer would be preferred over simply just stopping sending output signal ? 
  i do n't understand why sound cards would be programmed to do this instead of simply just stopping . 
  makes perfectly perfect sense , thank you very much !, 
  [ only thing that came to my mind . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=z8khsthtri8#t=6s ) ( 98.22 % irrelevant , though . ), 
  d'aww , 
  nope , i live in hungary and it gave me a `` priority international courier ( averages 2-4 days ) '' option ( as the only option for shipping ) . 
  sadly , however , shipping & handling costs $ 24.98 this way , plus there 's also a $ 16.24 import fees deposit , so i guess buying internationally to europe is n't really worth it . 
  canada may have it a bit cheaper , though . 
  i added a link to this to the sidebar around 5 seconds before you submitted it . 
  but , no !, 
  reddit is going downhill !, 
  right , guys ? 
  ha , cute how you had to write & amp ; amp ; amp ;, 
  actually , no , that would n't really help , since a huge part of the mod queue is actually spam . 
  i 'd say around 80-90 % , so if the mods would get notified every single minute because of the spam submissions , they would just stop ignoring the mod mail indicator . 
  in larger subreddits , they get at least one submission per minute in the queue , so their mods could just assume there is a new submission in the spam queue at any point in time without the help of the indicator and ideally should continuously check the queue the same way they should with getting notification , but in neither case is this actually going to happen . 
  sure !, 
  we accept all kinds of content , be it picture-based , moving picture-based , sound-based , moving sound-based , text-based , moving text-based ( ` < marquee  ` , woo !, 
  ) , smell-based , moving smell-based , and so on . 
  either !, 
  it 's such a wonderful place , is n't it . 
  yes it is . 
  wrex . 
  thanks a lot for your suggestions !, 
   the crystal method - [ born too slow ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6bekpzstjq ) , [ weapons of mass distortion ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=out4wthlfbe ), 
  did n't like them , too , umm , hard for me ? 
  do n't know a good word for this , it just lacks that nice , chilly , graceful , majestic beauty that magic spells has , or something like that . 
  i like [ their remix of daft punk 's the grid ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimbkjiw2gk ) , though . 
   r\u00f6yksopp - [ eple ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qczr6z2qtpe&amp;ob=av2n ) , [ happy up here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51bpx63wkba ), 
  knew r\u00f6yksopp already , i love eple and so easy from him . 
   [ the tough alliance - koka kola veins ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyoruzn35z8 ), 
  good one . 
  the beginning reminded me of mgmt . 
   [ lykke li - breaking it up ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujtvs1cn1xg ), 
  my favorite out of all these , though i listened to [ what i believe the original is ] ( http://grooveshark.com/s/breaking+it+up/2juxi8?src=5 ) , instead of the remix you linked . 
  i really loved the choir-like vocals , like in [ gorillaz - dirty harry ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbie-xdblem ) . 
  thank you very much again !, 
   [ slagsm\u00e5lsklubben ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrmzjnawneo ), 
  love the chiptune-y feel in this one . 
   [ telepopmusic - breathe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5xfayzaa7w&amp;ob=av2n ), 
  kinda monotone and repetitive , but , well , it 's an okay song . 
   [ yeah yeah yeahs - heads will roll ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/yeahyeahyeahsmusic?blend=1&amp;ob=4 ), 
  nice track , this one . 
  i also checked out a few others from them , [ maps ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiixlgcuqru ) is quite good as well . 
  and by the way , for anyone else reading this comment , the correct link to heads will roll is [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auzftpp4moa ) . 
   [ ratatat - wildcat ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iknixabsuee ), 
  my favorite out of this batch , i 've seen ratatat mentioned on reddit a few times before , turns out they 're awesome . 
  the song reminded me a bit of other crystal castles songs , maybe [ baptism ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vstjmyxety0 ) . 
  ... and i 've subscribed to you playlist on grooveshark , will check the songs out in the near future . 
  i know and love massive attack , r\u00f6yksopp and the xx from it . 
  also , based on what you 've suggested , here are a few , i do n't know , counter-suggestions from me ( they are not necessarily similar to your songs , just some i think you might enjoy ) :, 
  pretty lights - [ finally moving ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk9xyqmrily ) , maybe [ total fascination ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5434lqmqc ) ( you might even like this one even more , as it 's faster paced ), 
  bop - [ sunrain ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rws9o2opkow ) and [ intercontinental meltdown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dq93qrlw4g ), 
  kim hiorth\u00f8y - [ forskjellige gode ting ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qopkp-h2jc ), 
  hope you 'll like them !, 
  this is completely , * completely * different from asteroids , but it 's a lucky day for you , my dear bdover28 , for i absolutely loved this song !, 
  i mean , like , really . 
  thanks , man !, 
  oh , kind redditors , i would really appreciate if you used my referral code , 5235 , when registering to this site . 
  at least some of you . 
  you know what , let 's just do a referral chain here - register with this code and post your own referral code in a comment , alrighty ? 
  thanks . 
  okay , start with him , and feel free to skip my code entirely . 
  thanks , but 15 years of scientology was way too much for me , i 'm not going back . 
  but seriously , thank you , nice suggestion you 've got there . 
  edit : though , i 'd like to file a bug report with you regarding the first link , since it 's the same as the second . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d9bh2gytqc ) the correct one . 
  i have you tagged as `` potential biggest heatsink '' . 
  i do n't feel really creative at the moment , someone else suggest something . 
  please . 
  or just go through my comment history and see if you find any interesting tidbits . 
  probably no . 
  yep . 
  come on , you never say `` oh my god '' , or anything like that ? 
  well , i do , when i see something absolutely unbelievable . 
  typical atheist . 
  thinks a witty response he stole off of r/atheism will completely disprove god 's existence in an instant . 
  those interesting tidbits are difficult to find , eh ? 
  whoa , that 's an awesome site you 've got there , why did i not know about this ? 
  and it says i 'm a good guy greg ? 
  why could that be ? 
  feels awesome , man . 
  huh , awesome !, 
  fun fact : this ampers & thing is not that much of a coincidence - the word ampersand has evolved from the expression `` and per se , and '' , from when the ampersand was still a part of the english alphabet ( the alphabet ended as '' ... x , y , z , ** and per se , and ** '' , which means something along the lines of `` and by itself , and '' . ), 
  no , you got the question wrong . 
  fealiks wanted to know if there are annoyingly too many people replying `` steve holt '' to * your * comments . 
  and why is this good for the seller ? 
  in this case , giving all the money back ? 
  and what 's the point of $ 20 rebates on a $ 200 product ? 
  why ca n't they just say it 's on a -10 % sale and make the buyer pay only $ 180 to begin with ?
