   fml, 
  [ how i read your comment . 
  ] ( http://qkme.me/35ynd3 ), 
  i do n't think it can possibly be the half of 888 , since that would be 38 . 
  well , of course i assumed op was asking how halving 888 works in regular maths , so i disregarded all laws of mirrored mathematics when writing my answer . 
  no - the seventh law of mirrored mathematics clearly states that the process of vertically halving even numbers involves a division by zero , and is therefore impossible . 
  for 4 years , to be exact . 
  yeah , i considered that , but the rule says `` facts that appeal only to a narrow audience '' are disallowed , and i believe free downloads are not specific to the current audience of amazon . 
  i 'll cross post this then , though . 
  [ cross posted from / r/todayilearned ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/pqqwt/til_amazon_has_a_huge_collection_of_free/ ) , as per [ browsing_from_work 's suggestion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/pqqwt/til_amazon_has_a_huge_collection_of_free/c3rhyta ) . 
  okay , sorry , i did n't mean to cause anyone trouble . 
  first of all , the 30 days is not true - actually it 's storing a cookie with my name for 24 hours only . 
  and yes , it 's a cookie , so dave_l was also wrong , the cache and the memory has nothing to do with it , if you wish to delete this cookie in chrome ( i do n't use other browsers so i ca n't help users of those ) the simpler was is to press ctrl-shift-delete , tell it to delete cookies from the past day , and bam , you are completely clean . 
  this , however will clear all cookies from all sites you got yesterday , so instead , you might want to go to ` wrench -  settings -  advanced settings -  content setttings -  all cookie and site data ` and delete the amazon cookies from there manually . 
  i guess from now on if i happen to post an affiliate link again some time , i 'll make it a self post with both the affiliate and the non affiliate link . 
  i hope that 's alright . 
  anyway , it 's a bit late now i guess , but you can use [ this link here ] ( http://www.amazon.com/free-songs-music/b/?_encoding=utf8&amp;node=334897011 ) to get to the mp3 downloads without getting an affiliate cookie . 
  edit : spelling . 
  whoops . 
  dave_l 's suggestion wo n't work at all , please see [ this comment of mine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/youshouldknow/comments/pqwkl/ysk_that_amazon_has_a_huge_collection_of_free/c3rrxx5 ) for instructions . 
  awesome , glad you liked it !, 
  ron . 
  no , it 's called simply just sc , without the r. 
  next up , some [ geography ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria ) , just for you . 
   `` which '' and `` that '' are interchangeable in the given example , it 's not a grammar mistake , it 's simply style . 
  stopped reading after that ** since ** the article got the second one wrong . 
  funny thing is , the article also says ` since ' can not be used in this context , for it is supposed to only refer to time :, 
   `` since '' refers to time . 
  `` because '' refers to causation . 
  e.g. , since i quit drinking i 've married and had two children . 
  e.g. , because i quit drinking i no longer wake up in my own vomit . 
  i , however , am quite reluctant to follow this advice - i 'm not a native english speaker , but i 'm still rather sure the word ` since ' is actually synonymous with ` because ' . 
  am i wrong about this ? 
  huh , i even thought of ` since ' as a more sophisticated version of ` because ' , when actually it 's not even completely correct . 
  thanks !, 
  why does the image url say fat ? 
  umm , the file is stored on an hard drive that uses a fat32 file system ? 
  maybe ? 
  do n't worry , it 's not as bad as you might think at first glance - [ haypanny has said her name on reddit herself before ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/pqxj7/your_names_sabrina_tell_salem_i_say_hi_my_fellow/c3rjog9 ) . 
  do n't worry , it 's not as bad as you might think at first glance - [ oh wait it is ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/pweq6/come_with_me_if_you_dont_want_paint_on_your/c3svrkm?context=1&amp;needed_a_link_here_to_make_this_match_the_comment_before ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/px8is/dont_you_hate_it_when_you_go_and_do_something/c3t05pt?context=1 ) you said the case was an nzxt phantom - which one is it then ? 
  umm , posted 10 minutes ago and has 128 upvotes ? 
  this seems a little bit fishy . 
  edit : i 'm sorry if this is legit , but i do n't recall ever seeing a reddit post growing this fast in my almost two years here , and quite frankly , the song is not even that good . 
  ah , so there we go . 
  please check out the [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) - this line , to be specific :, 
   [ please do n't ], 
  ** send out ims , tweets , or any other message asking people to vote for your submission ** -- or comply when other people ask you . 
  your submission should get points for being good , not because the submitter is part of a voting clique . 
  thanks !, 
  oh , well , i guess that 's fine then , carry on , sir . 
  & nbsp ; ^ ^ * dammit & nbsp ; i & nbsp ; will & nbsp ; catch & nbsp ; you & nbsp ; one & nbsp ; day , & nbsp ; oh & nbsp ; i & nbsp ; will . 
  ... but seriously now , sorry !, 
  okay , now , could you please give me a link to that tweet of yours ? 
  because with all these clearly spam replies to your post sent a few minutes ago this is starting to look like a work of a spambot again . 
  yep , there 's [ this ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji ) extension for chrome . 
  we will be waiting for you , boii , 
  ha , seems like i did catch you after all . 
  now do n't you try gaming my dear reddit again !, 
  huh , these actually exist , and [ this one ] ( http://www.amazon.com/totes-adult-clear-bubble-umbrella/dp/b001dzq31g/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1329777641&amp;tag=underyx-20&amp;sr=8-1 ) does n't seem that bad either . 
  edit : i love how the descripion says `` waterproof '' . 
  ** [ proof ] **, 
  how can you do either of those with a wire coat hangar ? 
  i usually just park my aircraft in there . 
  me too , yays !, 
  there 's a ~ 1000 limit for fetchable comments from the api , is n't there ? 
  metareddit has been giving me counts of around 900-1000 for almost a year now . 
  also , why does the bot put `` derp / '' in every comment link ? 
  oh , okay , i did n't realize the link wo n't work if there 's nothing written where the submission 's title would go . 
  yes , please . 
  [ i still have n't forgotten about you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/drunkenjedi/comments/jzg2x/who_is_drunkenjedi/c2gcr2y ) . 
  ### *** zomg & nbsp ; he & nbsp ; replied & nbsp ; to & nbsp ; me !, 
  ... okay , sorry , i promise i 'll act less like a freak from now on . 
  yes , sir !, 
  you are completely right , sir !, 
  i deeply appreciate you opening my eyes , mr. doyle !, 
  disco ball, 
  this might be the weakest conversation starter comment i 've ever seen on reddit . 
  [ here you go , good sir ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5434lqmqc ) . 
  huh , i have n't really seen anything about him on reddit before . 
  i just simply love him . 
  [ related ] ( http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2768226/36.mp3 ) ( actually is simply just the song extracted straight from the game . ), 
  the online version is the original , it was only later that they released it on the ps3 as well . 
  weird , i enjoyed the space stage the most , then the civilization one , and only my third favorite was the cell stage . 
  aw , man , [ so close . 
  well , that 's because you only looked at the smallest available size of the image . 
  which is for peons . 
  for how long did you have coffee on your monitor ? 
  and in what way did this quote make you realize it was time you finally cleaned it off ? 
  um , yes , just [ as i 've said so myself as well . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/q899e/amazon_sells_an_image_for_129411763022387850_and/c3vj8jn ), 
  but alas , reddit thought it would be a good idea to downvote my comment and thus make this information more difficult to access . 
  to be honest , this is slightly annoying me . 
  logically , i should be happy about this - if one less person sees it , deletes my cookie , and then buys something due to it being downvoted , i 've earned a few more cents ( yup , that 's the kind of money on stakes here ) . 
  but , no . 
  the immaturity an irrationality of a reddit ... miniwitchhunt , or whatever this is bugs me to no end . 
  do n't i , though ? 
  just go through my user page - i have way over a thousand comments and hundreds of submissions . 
  i do understand this point of yours now , however , i still do n't feel it would be fair to disregard my numerous contributions to the reddit community for this sole reason . 
  ( a minor , trivial error in your comment : if you buy something this weekend , i wo n't get a cut , since the affiliate link lasts only for 24 hours .
