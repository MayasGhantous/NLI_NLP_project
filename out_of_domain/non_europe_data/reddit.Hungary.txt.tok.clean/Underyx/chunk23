   so try to break even . 
  do n't get into dept. 
  do n't start out on dept , always calculate with what you have . 
  it will get back to you . 
  if there 's anything i 've learned from reddit it 's never to loan money from banks , i 'll try my best to keep away from them . 
   oh and think about the one time costs . 
  at least here you have to pay 3 months of rent as a security deposit in the first month so it 's 4 times the rent in the beginning . 
  others have mentioned initial deposits too , so i guess i 'll have a rough start then , but it 'll ease off over time - thanks a lot !, 
  hmm , that would make it a bit rough to work for me , though , as currently i make most of my moneye online . 
  i really think it would be worth it to pay around $ 20 a month to get internet access . 
  i do n't need a landline phone and tv service , though . 
  oh , it would be awesome if i could get some kind of assistance from the goverment , i 'll look around for something like that . 
  i eat less than you 'd expect :p, 
  but , okay , $ 200/month for food should be enough , right ? 
  i 'd still rather stay here than get loans i 'm sure i 'll be able to pay off and move out , but thanks anyway !, 
  actually , i should really do that . 
  does anyone know of any subreddits specializing in easy/cheap recipes ? 
  thanks for these !, 
  in the meantime , i also found [ / r/budgetfood ] ( / r/budgetfood ) and [ / r/cheap _ meals ] ( / r/cheap _ meals ) . 
  good idea !, 
  i love numbers and statistics , so keeping track of my expenses will even be fun for me . 
  i do n't quite see how that could work . 
  could you please elaborate ? 
  oh , okay , sorry about that . 
  i 've removed the links to their reddit submissions from the original post , but i 'm afraid that 's all i can do . 
  alrighty , i 'm going to take every opportunity for work i have and will keep an eye out for that kind of stuff . 
  i actually already have a possible job opportunity at an austrian hotel for a month this summer , which will pay around $ 1200 , so they sure are a good way to earn money . 
  [ hmm ... ] ( http://qkme.me/3ocq79 ), 
  thanks for these well thought-out words - my plan currently is to live off of an ordinary part-time job plus these freelance programming projects i 've mentioned until i get a degree , and then i plan to move to the usa and get a full time job in it or a related field . 
  i 'll make sure to have both a steady income and plenty of reserves by the time i actually move out . 
  alright , that 's useful to know , thanks !, 
  oh , it 's really nice to hear such a positive reaction for a change , i really needed this now , thanks !, 
  that 's some awesome advice you 've got there , thank you !, 
  novelty accounts in my thread :, 
  actually i might just get a mattress and be happy with that . 
  that 's really good to know , thank you !, 
  too frequent, 
  well , sir , that is one of the most excellent pieces of advice in here , i really appreciate you sharing it with me and i will surely live by your word . 
  i think i 'll need an internet and a cell phone plan and i 'm all set , so that 's gon na simplify things a little bit . 
  a tiny little bit . 
  i clicked the nonexistant downvote arrow at least five times . 
   your housing - do not get a corner apartment . 
  for maximum quiet , many people get a corner apartment on a top floor . 
  however , your concern at this point should be keeping expenses low . 
  i live in a studio apartment and did not have to turn on my heat even once this winter . 
  this is because i have neighbors on each side , and above me , who keep their apartments warm . 
  below me is the laundry room , with dryers that vent warm air below me . 
  result : no winter heating bill for me . 
  on the rare occasions that i do need heat , it is much less expensive to use a small oil-filled radiator like [ this ] ( http://www.google.com/products/catalog?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=portable+oil+radiator&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=13799968261567278487&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=vv9kt8udmopeial40jsjdw&amp;ved=0cgcq8wiwaa ) than the forced air heating built into the apartment . 
  wow , this is simply ... ingenious . 
  as is the `` do not go grocery shopping while you are hungry '' advice ... and basically your whole comment !, 
  i really , really appreciate all the time and effort you put into this , thank you , ~ ~ sir ~ ~ miss !, 
  oh dear , my sincerest apologies . 
  was n't there some kind of law in the usa by which no one can sue the government and related entities without their explicit permission to do so ? 
  edit : yup , there is , and it 's called [ sovereign immunity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_immunity_in_the_united_states ) , thanks , simplecosine . 
  also , thank you , reddit , for downvoting me for asking a simple question . 
  edit 2 : jeez , seriously , i ca n't seem to get over this . 
  i ask a question , and some beslubbering dread-bolted puttocks just proceed to downvote me because their pribbling rampallian gut told them the answer is no or something . 
  even if i were actually wrong , downvoting is n't flipping meant to be used like that . 
  heavens . 
  edit 3 : phew , that felt good to write down . 
  sorry , everyone . 
  now , get back on topic .

  ( i know i started to drift a bit far from deadmau5 at the end , but i still fell like you 'll like them . 
  especially goldfish . 
  it 's impossible to not like them . ), 
  yup , there is , and it 's in [ line # 31 of the reddiquette . 
  yeah , well , these downvotes are actually kinda fair , so i have absolutely no problem with them . 
  sorry about the edits , though !, 
  i 'm completely fine with people downvoting me with proper reason , like in this case , so it is n't that much of an issue , do n't worry . 
  however , i wish to apologize to anyone who was offended by those edits or were hurt in any way . 
  why , that is most considerate of you , and is much appreciated !, 
  i , as i have repeatedly stated in this thread , do _ not _ care about karma , and neither do i care about your downvote . 
  what 's infuriating me is the blatant ignorace and idiocracy those people displayed . 
  i 'm not quite sure , actually . 
  getting mad at minor things and writing that down might let me relieve general stress or something , though i seriously do n't know . 
  absolutely wrong . 
  the origin of this meme is unknown , the most probable theory is that it 's from [ this comic .
