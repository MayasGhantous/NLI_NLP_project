  hmm , i gave that a listen , and it really is similar to goldfish , but ... 
  i do n't know , it just lacks some secret ingredient that goldfish uses or something . 
  weird . 
  but , thanks a lot anyway !, 
  edit : oh , also , check out [ / r/electroswing ] ( / r/electroswing ) !, 
  hmm , you sure are a fan of dust . 
  and you proudly display all your dust in those trophy cases as well . 
  but they just wo n't shut up !, 
  poor [ / r/outofcontext ] ( / r/outofcontext ) :(, 
  yeah ... 
  thanks , man . 
  as a european redditor , can someone non-officially maybe contact me with a way to make a tiny little donation ? 
  edit : typo . 
  what about i gift money to a us resident individual ( preferably a rpac official who is thereby trustworthy ) just because i like him so much , and then that individual donates the money i gave him to rpac , since he can do whatever the hell he wants to with it ? 
  yes , sir !, 
  you mean [ this ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nmpeeekfhbmikbdhlpjbfmnpgcbeggic ) ? 
  they are fools . 
  you should eat them . 
  ` upgrade account ' volna . 
  this is n't broken at all , it 's just a gif with an intentionally placed liquifying effect on it . 
  mind if i steal that idea and post it in the subreddit ? 
  ( only if you are n't going to do it yourself , of course . ), 
   to deadmau5 ( ** who 's ** real name is joel zimmerman ), 
  i 'm sorry , guys , should n't this be ` whose ' instead ? 
  i 'm not a native english speaker , so i 'm not sure , but seeing it written like this really bugs me somehow . 
  you will get not only a reply , but some awesome valve swag as well , trust me on this one . 
  just send them an e-mail . 
  i 'd say try maybe erics@valvesoftware.com ( the adress of eric smith ) . 
  this thread is a hundred times better with [ this ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oheflacdocadefgdpiimpapbkomhgbbe ) chrome extension . 
  yay !, 
  [ link for the lazy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g7dokwedspe#t=128s ), 
  yup . 
  it 's broken . 
  possible . 
  or maybe i was trying to be [ meta ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmd_rdowbec ) ? 
  [ thanks , xkcd . 
  well , they do have ( c ) square enix written in the bottom right corner . 
  well , this card has a maximum read & write speed of 10 mb/s , while a typical ssd does over 400 mb/s , so i do n't think it would be a good idea to use an sd card like that . 
  even a simple hard drive goes over 50 mb/s normally . 
  it 's been redeemed . 
  ( not by me . ), 
  but the reddit alien ( snoo ) is female : /, 
  i did , but snoo stayed female . 
  but what if you are lying ? 
  but what if neither of them or both of them do win ? 
  does n't work , though . 
  i did , no one picks up . 
   not all numbers that begin with 555 are fictional, 
  i had faith . 
  1 minute and * 2 seconds * . 
  ( uh , bolded so it can be , umm , seen easier . ), 
  ## i like this tutorial more . 
  thanks for your well thought-out and insightful answer , i find it difficult to disagree with any of your points . 
  this joke is deeper than that though , ` ducking up ' could also actually refer to the feathers flying around . 
  he has been on several other occasions . 
  yes it does . 
  well , to be fair , those hashtags were n't actually really clever , let alone clever enough to spark a conversation . 
  edit : whoa , reddit , been a long time since i 've seen something like this on here - burritoman12 and i took completely different stances in our comments , but neither of us has received a single downvote so far , there are only upvotes . 
  keep it up , guys !, 
  this [ kinda existed before ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_nethernet ) . 
  there 's not even a firefox one anymore , so no . 
  he could 've just hired [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mkdqa.jpg ) for a writer . 
  this was probably not taken by britta . 
  that would be against the reddiquette . 
  basically nothing can be seen of them at [ actual size . 
  okay , i 've heard a few stories of the government giving a damn , but * two damns * ? 
  whoa . 
  i 've been using windows 8 for a month now and have n't had a single crash , every single app and game works perfectly . 
  he said he gets 1-2 megabits on a 20 megabit connection . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  i really loved the project and was quite sad when it closed down . 
  are you maybe interested in doing an ama about it ? 
  ( because i certainly am . ), 
  i 'd love to know what your takes on existing methods of monetization were , for instance - why you thought they were n't viable . 
  by this i mean stuff like injecting your own ads into webpages from time to time , or converting the game into a free to play one , with bonuses available for purchase for interested players . 
  alright , alright . 
  it 's a real shame you could n't keep the project running , though it 's good to hear it was fun to work on . 
  anyway , best of luck on finding a project as unique as the nethernet ( or pmog , as i knew it back then ) !, 
   i have often contemplated doing something similar . 
  with the new advances in the browsers , in the webstacks , and all that , it might be interesting to give it a run . 
  hey , i 've only just started learning programming ( in python ) , and i do n't think i 'd be of much help , but if you ever start over with this ( on a smaller scale initially , of course ) , i would be really glad to help with whatever i can . 
  ( [ here 's a link ] ( https://github.com/underyx/musiccollector/ ) to a sample of my work , if you are interested , really basic , i know , but i 'm getting better day by day . ), 
  i 'd think the market for the game among casuals would be a lot larger than in the days of pmog even with only a chrome extension , though . 
  as far as i know , chrome is used by a lot of casuals currently , who , by the way , are n't that concerned about privacy and would have no problems installing an extension like this . 
  and then there 's facebook , which would be the perfect platform for spreading the game - even if they use it only on facebook , having achievements such as `` liked 100 photos '' or `` wrote a 200 word long comment '' could gather a lot of interest among them . 
  or so i believe . 
  or know how to use a proxy/vpn . 
  for the initial setup . 
  ... so we 're not allowed to say the name ? 
  the point of that was that being marked as nsfw hid the thumbnail , thus preventing people from accidentally seeing spoilers from the linked image without clicking on it . 
  as far as i know , flair ca n't hide thumbnails . 
  whoa , that uploader must really love the caps lock . 
  [ yup .

   `` you know what ? 
  that was wonderful !, 
  you guys were great !, 
  that 's a wrap !, 
  ... you see what i did ?
