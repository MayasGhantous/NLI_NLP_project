  upvoting posts with `` do n't upvote '' in the title . 
  i 've seen this at least thirty times . 
  not like i was bitching , valueseeker asked a question and i clarified what curiositysphere meant by `` this stopped being funny years ago . '', 
  then you were n't being ... uh , anything ? 
   `` wat '' is a variant of the english word `` what '' that is often used to express confusion or disgust, 
  from your source, 
  oh , man , just let it go , alright ? 
  everyone thinks your comment was stupid , and that 's because it _ was _ . 
  even if it was a relevant meme ( which it was not ) it added absolutely nothing to the discussion . 
  it would n't support a lot of games , though , then . 
  and that is like , what , 3 % of the steam game library ? 
  if it 's supposed to be a gaming pc , it has to support a lot of games . 
  just imagine what the xbox 360 would be like if it had only around 10 aaa games , and 20 indie titles . 
  it went * adequate *,

  i know it 's not an rpg , but the main point here is that a game set in a high school can still be amazing . 
  congratulations , you basically just copied the title of this submission . 
  upvotes to you , sir . 
  well , daanv 's comment is still around 70 % upvoted , is n't it ? 
  i do n't think the 30 % can be called the hive mind . 
  thank you for sharing this ? 
   i personally would just choose a different employer .

  does any of these support calling a contact by saying the nickname i set for them ? 
  i 'm hungarian , and therefore have a lot of hungarian names in my contact list , and of course , voice recognition software struggles to understand those . 
  i figured i could just enter nicknames like ` mike ' or ` dad ' , but i have n't found i way to make the phone listen to those . 
  okay , new rule of browsing reddit : if the title poses an interesting question which you want to know a detailed answer to , just assume it 's not gon na be answered in the article .

  ~ ~ on ( x ) on one x is not supported ~ ~ ** edit : ** whoops , turns out it is , and it 's only the cm9 rom i use that has a bug which makes me unable to install the app from the play store . 
  thank you so very much , it seems to be working so far . 
  oh , i 'm so sorry , the problem turned out to be that i use a cyanogenmod 9 nightly , and it has a bug which wo n't let the user install certain apps from the play store , such as on { x } , seemingly . 
  this is a [ known issue ] ( https://github.com/intermediaterepresentation/android_device_htc_endeavor/issues/36 ) , and will be fixed by the rom 's developers , so you do n't need to take any action . 
  sorry again !, 
  well , we do have a few potential attendees , but no one 's been actually willing to organize a meetup . 
  i 'd buy that for one cent .

  seriously ? 
  f5h7d talks about unoriginal comments and this has to be the top reply ? 
  aw jeez , now i feel bad . 
  does n't it bother anyone else that he 's been talking with the police officer for at least a minute and only after that does he come to the realization that he is n't deaf after all ?

   the google play music widget now lets you thumbs up ** songs as their playing ** and features a new design for better readability .
