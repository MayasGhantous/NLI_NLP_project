  okay , i 'm taking the arrogance leap of certain downvotery now ; this ` hey i 'm gon na make a grammatical mistake on purpose and be oh-so-witty ' joke is awfully unoriginal . 
  you should feel bad for being the 89172nd person to make it on reddit . 
  really bad . 
  not quite new ; this already happens on reddit all the time . 
  do me , yays !, 
  what , you actually got the next spot : /, 
  sorry about the semicolons -- i 'm not a native english speaker so i 'm not entirely sure about when it 's appropiate to use them in english . 
  also , the main difference between those comments is that while i actually said something worthwhile ( controversial , yes , but i actually stated my opinion with that comment ) , that joke sentence ` there trying they 're best ' is something no one could say seriously . 
  why would anyone imply that those poor google engineers have really been trying to satisfy all the grammar nazis , but despite their best effort , they failed in the end ? 
  nope , you did n't really miss anything , i just like my false sense of superiority . 
  anyone got any idea about what the stuff in the video is ? 
  and here 's a link to the replay : dota2 : / / matchid = 22432820, 
  edit : could anyone find the part where they sneak behind the enemy and attack their ancient only to be stopped by them teleporting in ? 
  well , i 'm starting to believe that part of the article was made up . 
  there is a part at around 60 minutes where four of them wait for a while near the enemy base invisibly , but the enemy stays near their ancient the whole time , and finally they just come out of invisibility and engage in a full-on teamfight ( they bring the enemy ancient down to around 40 % during this , as described in the article . ), 
  not really . 
  the joke is that the gpu in an apple mobile device is typically used for displaying text only . 
  yes , but the joke is that the gpu in an apple mobile device is typically used for displaying text only . 
  okay , for my first point , let 's look at the infinity blade stats . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-06-27-infinity-blade-is-epics-most-profitable-franchise-ever ) , infinity blade has grossed $ 23 million . 
  since the article was written in january , let 's bring that up ten percent , to $ 25 million . 
  then , a quick look at [ the app store ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/infinity-blade/id387428400 ) tells us a copy costs 6 dollars - if we assume that around 20 % of the revenue was from in-app purchases , that leaves us at 20,000,000 / 6 , so around 3 million copies sold . 
  now , onto ios device sale statistics , according to [ this article ] ( http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_total_ios_device_sales_top_365_million/ ) , apple has sold 365 million ios devices by april 2012 , with 50 million sales in a single quarter . 
  i think it would be safe to count that as 400 million sales by today . 
  so , to summarize , ** we have 3 million sales of the top sold high-graphics game ** ( so , angry birds and the like excluded ) ** on a total of 400 million devices . 
  ** that 's less than 1 percent . 
  and to be honest , i really 99 % of the people who buy high end graphics chips for their computers are not playing gpu intensive games on it . 
  ... oh , and i did n't even mention that infinity blade is basically just a tech demo . 
  most of the people i know bought it only to try it and say ` oh my , look at what this cute little gpu is capable of ! ', 
  - that 's right , ** people do n't really play with this game , unlike how pc gamers do with their games ** . 
  i doubt you can name one person who bought a high end gpu along with a game only to see how good crysis or whatever looks like , without actually playing any games on it afterwards . 
  and now , for my last point regarding issue : the linked image was intended to be a joke . 
  ** jokes tend to exaggerate stereotypes to achieve comedic effect ** - keep that in mind . 
  also , sorry about my english , i 'm not a native speaker . 
  no , no , no . 
  i tried to be extremely clear about this in my previous comment without actually writing it down , but consider this : if you want a pc for work , or browsing the internet , or whatever , you do * not * put a high end gpu in it . 
  if you want to play games on it , you do . 
  however , if you buy an iphone for making calls , texting , browsing the internet , et cetera , you do have the same gpu in it as the people who bought it for gaming ( who , by the way , do not really exist . ), 
  that 's great !, 
  and also one of the main things google now has been advertised with . 
  what 's next , screenshot of the notification area saying ` look , i got an email and it shows up here , awesome ' ? 
  oh , wait , no , the title i wrote had proper capitalization and punctuation , so it probably wo n't make it . 
  how can that possibly work if even light takes 13.8 minutes to arrive from mars to earth ? 
  how do the images get here faster than light does ? 
  that means 3 , right ? 
  i know , just kidding , play along , will ya ?

  i 'm just gon na copy and paste my comment to angels in here :, 
  anyone got any idea about what the stuff in the video is ? 
  mars is currently 2.508 \u00d7 10 ^ 8 kilometers away - on that distance nasa claimed an accuracy of 20 kilometers , which gives us an accuracy to distance ratio of 1.254 \u00d7 10 ^ 7 . 
  dividing the 1 kilometer distance i specified by 1.254 \u00d7 10 ^ 7 gives us that the shot will be accurate to 0.079 millimeters . 
  a typical piece of paper is 0.102 millimeters thick , so it would definitely be pierced through . 
  well , obviously . 
  i just calculated the accuracy , i did n't think for a second that i 'd have to explicitly explain that shooting an arrow and shooting a rover to mars are two different things . 
  i 'll just paste my reply to another comment in here :,

  [ xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/532/ ), 
  i think borderlands 2 costs $ 50 on gmg normally . 
  i 'm quite sure the comic . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zecix-3wfs ) is the same video . 
  mirror . 
  that 's why we have the upvote button . 
  i mean , like , seriously . 
  it 's just so obvious . 
  here , [ this ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1763240 ) is the guy doing all the work ( and , okay , anyone else contributing to his [ github project ] ( https://github.com/tg-endeavoru-jellybean/android_device_htc_endeavoru ) ) . 
  he kept making everything in aosp 4.1 work , and all those ` cm devs ' just copied his code into their cm builds , passing them off as their own work . 
  i 'm afraid none of these guys are correct , it 's some kind of an aerosol container . 
  they did try to do that , but rubick/his team killed the courier before it could deliver . 
  it is , the courier can deliver items even across ledges if it 's close enough , i 've just tested this . 
  the basic courier could 've delivered items up there as well . 
  i 've just tested it myself before writing that comment and it did work . 
   bassless pricing, 
  indeed , telecom companies are nothing but treble . 
  ... i did n't mean to start one of these :(, 
  okay , first of all : people who i know irl , you guys are not allowed to read this comment of mine . 
  and just stop stalking me on reddit altogether  :(, 
  but then , on to my point . 
  i 've tried the app on my one x , using cm10 , and i am not impressed . 
  every single button press was followed by at least 10 seconds of load time , the free videos are way too tiny , the app crashed at least 75 percent of the time i launched it , and worst of all , i both had my phone on silent ( not even vibration mode ) and used the in-app mute option , but the first video i launched still started playing with sound until i 've turned the mute option off and on once more . 
  edit : way to go , reddit , with all these downvotes . 
  ` look , this guy 's writing about how the app did n't work on his cm10 one x !, 
  better downvote him so that no one can see this . ', 
  i love the bottom scrolling bar thingie that 's just jumping around ` coz why the hell not . 
  i know . 
  the video the network broadcast was itself wobbly/shaky/whatever-y , so the bar on the bottom did n't have a fixed position relative to that . 
  quite so , dear sir . 
  but a .22 rimfire is not a 22mm rimfire . 
  well , congratulations , you found the joke then . 
  bro , it has happened to me before , i know that feel . 
  there was this awesome support group i found that helped me get through it , i 'll try and find their number for you . 
  hey , do n't you worry , she 's over 18 . 
  also , that reminds me to tell you guys : she was the one who asked me to post this - she is reading the thread , so for the love of god , behave yourselves , reddit . 
  my favorite is among all those yes and no words and seemingly random three digit numbers is the bolded , enlarged , standalone 15 .
