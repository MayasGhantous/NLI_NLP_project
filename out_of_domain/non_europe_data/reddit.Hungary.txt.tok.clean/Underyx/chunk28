  this song was completely different in style , a lot more disco-y , or i do n't know . 
  oh , hey , thanks a lot for this , it 's so close that for a few seconds i even thought this was the one , but unfortunately it is n't . 
  but seriously , nice guess !, 
  thanks , but nope . 
  there was n't a single unvocodered word in the song i 'm looking for . 
  it was way less upbeat than telex . 
  your second link was really close in style , though !, 
  the only difference is that the melody varied more in the song i 'm trying to find , it kept introducing completely new ` instruments ' - which were basically all electronic sounds , of course . 
  i applaud your formatting . 
  the comment perfectly conveyed your original experience . 
  problem is , your gpm does n't show you how you 're doing . 
  showing someone their high gpa would lead them to falsely believe they are doing well even if they are of no help to the team whatsoever . 
  i 've finally found it with the help of someone i know irl , thanks again for your guess !, 
  if you 're interested , the song turned out to be [ koto - visitors ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byohfdi693k ) .

  maybe it 's an homage ? 
  i find it really strange that no one managed to come to this conclusion . 
   run escape, 
  or maybe we should start updating the dota 2 wiki ? 
  i mean , that 's the whole point of a wiki . 
  i ca n't believe i was the first one to see this on here and think ` oh , i should fix that . ', 
  oh , did i miss one ? 
  i thought i did fix all of them . 
  anyways , you need to edit [ this template ] ( http://www.dota2wiki.com/index.php?title=template:item_cost&amp;action=edit ) , which contains the prices for all the items . 
  oh , awesome , i did n't know that , thanks !, 
  translation :, 
   that joke is freaking old and we are all tired of it . 
  uh , sandboxing would work even if it used only one single process . 
  chrome creates separate processes for everything mostly to be more stable - when a tab or a plugin crashes it does n't take the whole browser down with itself this way . 
  not at all . 
  in the political machine , you control the campaign of a presidential candidate , in the weeks before the election . 
  in democracy , you control the nation & mdash ; the policies , the taxes , everything . 
  the political machine is about how you win the election by flying from state to state holding speeches , running ads , and doing interviews . 
  democracy is about how you win your reelection by being a good president . 
  i actually much prefer democracy & mdash ; i like the actual political simulation a lot more than only of the campaign . 
  ( and i 've also been a huge fan of positech games ever since democracy 1 was released in 2006 . 
  positech went on to create the awesome kudos series , the even more awesome gratuitous space battles and the undescribably awesome gratuitous tank battles . ), 
  come on , the way he wrote is was just so damn cute :d, 
  edit : hah , he even corrected one of the cheeps now , but left the other one be . 
  that must be awesome . 
  by the way , could you please put a comma after the `` i do n't really care '' part ? 
  i know it 's cute and all , but it just does n't seem correct to me . 
  someone took red faction guerrilla without commenting . 
  well , the linked bundle is called thq humble bundle * core * - nov 2012 , so it 's perfectly possible that those 'll be beat the average games , or bonus games added a few days after the bundle has launched . 
  tf2 matches as well , eu 6v6 mixes are basically all organized on there . 
  how about budapest , hungary ? 
  whoa , that 's quite a few portals there , a lot more than i expected . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  jim carrey is in fact an american comedian , though . 
  with canada being a country in america and all . 
  i think i 'd try and put nfc tags in my different pockets ( sewing pouches on the inside of my jeans in which i can put the tags ; this way i could easily take the tags out whenever i want to wash them ) and set basic toggles for each of them , like the phone would switch to silent mode whenever it 's in my left pocket , and back to normal when it 's in the right one . 
  i could also set them to both turn on gps , since i 'm probably on the move when my phone 's in there . 
  in my native language the equivalent of the word ` american ' can be used interchangeably to mean either ` from the americas ' or ` from the usa ' , and i did n't quite think that previous comment of mine completely through . 
  i do n't recall disabling it & mdash ; the windows search service , which i believe is the one responsible for indexing , is running , and the ` search and indexing troubleshooter ' could n't identify any problems . 
  for reddit to properly parse your newlines , you need to put two spaces at the end of each one , like this :, 
  er\u0151szak - noun , 1. : the use of force to achieve a purpose . 
  3. : ( in press ) the unrestriced use of power , terror . 
  this is the most amazing app ever . 
  thank you so much !, 
  moon + is the worst with animations . 
  my phone is able to display only 2-3 frames of a page turn , even with animations as simple as a fade in . 
  you read it right . 
  edit : the deleted comment was basically this :, 
   do you really care about how animations look in an app that 's main purpose is to read text ? 
   it sucks that you ca n't side load books into it . 
  and it sucks that i ca n't buy books into it either , living in hungary . 
  it 's working !, 
   today i beat twitter as this message contains more than 140 characters , thank you, 
  that 's 81 characters . 
  your paraphrasing was n't very far off , the original message was n't twice as long for sure . 
  and it 's already in the game too . 
  how sure are you about this ? 
  googling ` athinganein ' only brings up romanian sites as result , which i would n't call the most reliable sources . 
  how come no one mentioned yet that the first clip from mirana was n't a fail at all ? 
  given that it 's early enough in the game , it might be quicker to get back to base by suiciding . 
  hey , thanks , that cleared it right up for me . 
  alrighty , thanks a lot , i 'll keep all this in mind !, 
  umm , did you just call the cmo of swiftkey ` some random dude ' ? 
  it 's [ live now ] ( http://www.swiftkey.net/en/blog/swiftkey-flow-beta-now-open/ ) . 
  mod seal of approval for you . 
  ( yup , 2 months late . ), 
  the song is based on the theme song for an anime called kyoro-chan , starring the red bird from the video & mdash ; kyoro-chan . 
  [ listen to the original theme song here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=uzye8qgcbxg#t=16s ) . 
  the anime itself is pretty , pretty awesome . 
  it 's got surprisingly great writing , it 's really cute , funny , and at times can get pretty emotional . 
  sadly , i do n't think there ever was an english dubbed version of it .
