  if you liked the above song , [ here 's the outro track of each episode ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv0390yiajy ) , and the [ other intro song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulg-5s_bcbo ) , each just as catchy as the other . 
  another thing to look out would be how you can fake gps location on rooted devices . 
  maybe watch nearby wi-fi hotspots or cell towers to verify location ? 
  well that 's cause it 's effectively loading 50 different pages for all your friends then . 
  they say nice things to each other ? 
  i am so amazed . 
  at the text adventure part , i typed \u00b4 ls \u00b4 out of habit when idly looking at terminals and it actually worked as if i typed \u00b4 look \u00b4 .

  i already own both ; sorry !, 
  hey , thank * you * for your offer :d, 
  [ here 's my profile ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/underyx/games?tab=all ) . 
  in all honestly , it is n't easy to find a game i do n't own , but good luck anyways :d, 
  link is the only one able to attack with weapons , instead of using exclusively his movement to damage enemies . 
  ( yes , mario does have fireballs , but not in his pictured form . ), 
  it could n't . 
  the picture shows the specific jumping animation from super mario bros. , which was [ not present in donkey kong ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0rbbe.png ) ( see how mario holds his fist up to break blocks above him ) . 
  nice try , though :d, 
  the pictured goomba is the only character whose name never was disclosed -- we do know mario 's , link 's and pac-man 's name , we do know that the ghost pictured is either inky , blinky , pinky , or clyde , but we do n't know what this specific goomba is called . 
  mario is the only one unable to pass through the left edge of the screen . 
  my thoughts exactly !, 
   you know , when ** your ** pudge would kill ** them ** with a hook , but you blink in the spot and he hooks you instead . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is for phones with intel processors . 
  ~ ~ although they 're named similarly , those are two different projects . 
  the post above refers only to smartphones with intel processors , while what you linked to is , as far as i know , is an unofficial project based on aosp ( it existed already when there was no official x86 code released , and its latest version is 4.2 ) ~ ~, 
  edit : see below . 
  my apologies !, 
  i must have confused it with something else , and since i am on my phone at the moment , i only took a quick glance at the linked google code page , where i could n't find the update mentioned in this submission 's title and thus i assumed i was thinking of the correct thing . 
  sorry , again !,

  how is 1-3 out of 10 considered ` most people ' ? 
  whoops , i thought you were the same guy as two comments above you , defending your point . 
  never mind !, 
  30 rock ? 
  i think the error you got was because of this ( i 've slighty modified your code for clarity 's sake ) :, 
  for y in a :, 
  if num % a [ y ] = = 0 :, 
  pass, 
  line 3 should read like this instead :, 
  if num % y = = 0 :, 
  when using that for loop , y 's value already is 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and so on ; a [ y ] will thus be interpreted as a [ 2 ] , a [ 3 ] , a [ 5 ] , ... , a [ 17 ] , a [ 19 ] , and of course , the last two would try and read the 18th and 20th elements of the list , which just do n't exist . 
  the virtual machine solution seems really good to me -- what software would you suggest for setting that up ? 
  i 'd be pretty fine with setting up xbmc in , say , virtualbox , but i do n't know what i could access it with . 
  oh , i thought logmein would n't quite cut it for this , being more bloated and stuff than necessary -- are you sure i would n't be better off with an alternative ? 
  ( bear in mind that with this being a media center , i 'd prefer not having even a single frame drop . ), 
  matching people by language spoken ; select what your main language is and then get matched with others who choose the same one . 
  i 'm pretty sure they do n't enjoy playing with english players either , without any way to meaningfully communicate with their team . 
  also , you could just disallow selecting more than one language . 
  because they know just as well as we do that the eu servers are full of russians as well ? 
  they just tick all regions fairly close to them to get a match as fast as possible . 
   english would be much shorter queues, 
  how , if there are ( or at least seem to be , i dunno ) more russian than english players ? 
  one of them wins and ** no one will ever be able to convince me otherwise !, 
  that 's * exactly * how they look like !, 
  oh good , i was worried mtg players would n't like it . 
  thanks for informing us !, 
  i 'd love a key , y' all :d, 
  do n't worry , it will run great , buy it !, 
  on a * completely * unrelated note : i 'm looking for keys , if anyone 's got a spare :3, 
  placeholder reply, 
  what makes you believe that ? 
  but they did n't ? 
  the only problem was all the whining from reddit . 
  they did nullify all of dotabuff 's work with this change , and they made a huge part of the site 's feature palette impossible to implement for now on . 
  valve does have the right , that is correct . 
  but that does n't mean it was a good move from them ; it was a horrible one . 
  why would you not allow anyone to profit off of their hard work on some data ? 
  it 's not like all they did was take the numbers directly and make them shiny . 
  you do realize it 's a common practice to pay people for analyzing data , right ? 
  how is that all misleading information ? 
  valve did in fact nullify most of the work done by people working on dotabuff . 
  they had all the right in the world to charge money for the work they did by analyzing data . 
  yes , that is a thing , in the real world , too . 
  dotabuff was a so called data analyst , which is respectable work , and they were n't just directly reselling whatever valve gave them . 
  even then , why would they just break dotabuff ? 
  here 's what a non-dickish move would 've looked like : they start implementing their own stat service , they release it , and then just let dotabuff stay , since it probably would generate more data anyway than valve itself would , and also because they 're not jerks . 
  or , at least , they could announce phasing out the replay system a month or so in advance to not kill the site the moment it would start monetization . 
  you do realize how little data the webapi has compared to the replay system , right ? 
  you do realize how they effectively made it impossible for dotabuff to gather accurate data by making most of it private , right ? 
  you do realize how all of this makes dotabuff not function properly at all and lose most of its features , right ? 
  and most of all , you do realize how valve did n't protect the users at all with this move , how they mostly only harmed them by killing one of the most useful dota related services , right ? 
  valve does indeed have the right to do that . 
  thing is , * they should n't have done it * . 
  please check my recent comments if you 're interested in my reasoning , and please do n't say ` if they have the legal right to fuck people over , it 's perfectly fine . ', 
  i have no idea how to reason with you . 
  i 'm sorry , vi3trice , before we devolve into making this ad hominem galore , could you just try some reasoning ? 
  now why would you be going around on the internet telling random people they do n't know what they 're talking about ? 
  thing is , i do . 
  thing is , it 's completely ridiculous to say valve does n't want them to have the information ; dotabuff 's work was only good for the community , it was really insightful , and generally improved dota 2 in general . 
  it 's a damn fine thing to ask for money for analyzing data , being a data analyst is not something to laugh at . 
  and naturally , a data analyst is n't someone who generates data by themselves to just sell , that wo n't work at all ; what they do is take data from somewhere , they put some , let me repeat , ** hard work ** into turning that raw data into something more digestable , and then they sell their data for money . 
  that 's the way it works , and if you want to know why , it 's beacuse a data analyst adds value to the raw data they work on , as did dotabuff . 
  please try reading my first sentence in that comment .
