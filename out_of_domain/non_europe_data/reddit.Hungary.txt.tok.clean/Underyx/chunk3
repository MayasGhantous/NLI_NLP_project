  strangest/funniest bug you ever seen ? 
  do you have a large collection of different kinds of pcs , with different hardware combinations to test the games on ? 
  do you have a word in design too , or just technical bugs ? 
  like , could you tell the devs that the menu layout is ugly , et cetera ? 
  ( feel free to skip some questions if this is too much for you :p ), 
  sorry dude , you were just one minute slow . 
  hey , thanks for all the answers . 
  this seems like almost a dream job for me , care to tell me about any downsides ? 
  what did n't you like about testing games ? 
  edit : oh , and did you leak any info to friends ? 
  friend of mine , could you please draw [ this ] ( http://min.us/idggq4.png ) ? 
  thanks !, 
  okay , i think we can agree on that . 
  and how the hell is that related to fbf again ? 
  so if i include a banana in all my comments do i get more karma ? 
  i use songbird . 
  i 'm not quite satisfied with it , but i 'm too lazy to change . 
  but reddit gold does that :(, 
  well , my point is that that 's one less reason to buy gold . 
  which is a bad thing , imo . 
  not feeling lucky , huh ? 
  poor guys . 
  but if there 's only *** one *** , who buys it for the comment highlighting only , that 's already a loss . 
  sadly , not everyone is generous enough to do that without additional benefits . 
  [ looks like your message reached notch ] ( http://twitter.com/#!/notch/status/10066942660452354 ) :p, 
  why are you telling us ? 
  go do it now !, 
  hungarian . 
  okay , thanks , i knew that . 
  how does that javascript code send the user stats to google ? 
  where does it get the stats from ? 
  edit : here 's the code , in case anyone is lazy to find one but would understand it :, 
  _ gaq.push ( [ ' _ trackpageview ' ] ) ;, 
  ( function ( ) {, 
  ga.src = ( ` https : ' = = document.location.protocol ? 
  ( i removed my account number ), 
  oh , that makes sense , hooray for you :d, 
  fret not , i am already prepared . 
  just wanted to know what you consider the most important . 
  :p it is also only ten minutes . 
  do not worry . 
  will not happen . 
  what the hell . 
  hahaha, 
   the browser chrome - *** ie *** the wrapper of the content - *** ie *** the interface - *** ie *** talking about how the browser interface is more minimal, 
  am i the only one who found `` ie '' quite funneh in this comment ? 
  but thanks to you it will now !, 
  yay for you !, 
  and i would be * sooo * grateful for a left 4 dead 2 , as you can can see [ here ] ( http://i.min.us/ifuii.png ) , i am usually a quite generous guy , but at the moment i ca n't buy anything :(, 
  it would be awesome to join my friends in l4d2 at last :(,

  ** whoa . 
  i 'd love to gift this to a friend of mine for christmas ( i already have minecraft , but need someone to play it with in smp ) .

  or what ? 
  lol u crazzzzzzy hes no ded < it 's sher@mie: ) , 
  no u crazzzzzzzzy times a million < it 's sher@mie: ) , 
  huh , i had a moment of joy there while i thought a *** really *** famous redditor replied to my comment . 
  but then i realized that i had just memorized your name so that i can remind you of justin in the future when i see you finally post a comment in which you seem happy . 
  edit : * tyyy-poh *, 
  why is this a reply to my comment ? 
  his wikipedia page is protected , it ca n't be edited . 
  even if it could be , wikipedia patrolmen would revert the troll-edits almost instantly . 
  hooray , i 'm in :p ( have n't had much luck with these raffles so far , but i 'll try anyway ^ . ^ ), 
  thanks !, 
  hey , thanks for your generousity . 
  i do n't play any of those games , but a friend of mine does , and would really appreciate the [ just cause 2 : monster truck dlc ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/35091/ ) . 
  i sent you his steam id in case you choose us :p, 
  and thank you !, 
  yay !, 
  i will pif for sure some time in the future . 
  edit : [ see ? 
  i told you . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/eoc6s/pif_flight_control_hd/ ), 
  sorry , copy-pasta does n't count as much as original content :p, 
  i 'm sorry , being in almost the same situation once ( not ending in such a happy way ) , you are an instant winner . 
  enjoy the game :p, 
  you actually did wait until i 've picked someone ? 
  you should ask him by the way to see if i actually sent him the game . 
  or what if oorealdealoo is just an alternate account of mine ? 
  you know , time to time you need to link a friend who ca n't speak english to a wikipedia article . 
  also , huwiki is full of contents specific to hungary which you wo n't find on enwiki . 
  alright , you want creative ? 
  that 's easier , it does n't have to make sense that way . 
  edit : oh , and do n't forget to consider that english is not my native language . 
  thanks !, 
  edit 2 : damn , lots of typos and grammatical oddities . 
  edit 3 : i bought the game myself , after all , choose someone else . 
  ( because i know my story was the best story evar . ), 
  so , lots of millions of years ago , there were *** gods *** . 
  yes , there actually were gods . 
  however , one thing always bothered them . 
  from where were they born ? 
  they were called gods , but that was one thing even they did n't know . 
  and the question was * killing * them .
