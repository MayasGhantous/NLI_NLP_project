  huh ? 
  where is it ? 
  but she 's not horizontally centered d :, 
  i feel like i 've seen a few similar stories over the course of the past 2 years . 
  oh christ do n't tell me i missed this :(, 
  i 've got a friend going by the name ` mici ' , which is hungarian for winnie , who 's really crazy about portal ( doing speedruns and everything , kinda ) and his birthday is right around the corner ... is there no way to buy this anymore ? 
  aw , but , especially with shipping , this costs way too much for me . 
  welp , thanks for trying to help anyways , and great job on your design !, 
  as a matter of fact , lately ie has actually been better in terms of performance . 
  if you wish to test this yourself , you can run the [ sunspider benchmark ] ( http://www.webkit.org/perf/sunspider/sunspider.html ) on both browsers and see which one 's faster . 
  you need to update your ie , then . 
  here 's [ my results ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xlhnbsx.png ) with the latest nightly of chromium , and the latest release version of internet explorer . 
  as you can see , chromium is 61 % slower than ie . 
  yes, 
  they break their o keys when typing ` trolololololoooooooooooool ' . 
  what do you mean by ` crowdsourcing ' ? 
  crowdsourcing the movie would be if the community had to actually make it , filming scenes and stuff . 
  what you mean is crowdfunding , but that 's not applicable here either , valve already made the movie , it does n't need to be funded anymore since valve already paid for production . 
  it probably because they have n't heard of the existing graphs , not that difficult to deduce . 
  here it is with proper line breaks :,

   oh , there 's nothing to ya, 
  yeah , i see right through ya, 
  you 're losing it , you 're losing it, 
  you 're laughin ' but you 're tragic, 
  your tricks they got no magic, 
  you 're losing it , you always miss, 
   why do n't you go away get away, 
  far away , stay away, 
  you 're hopelessly hopeless get away, 
   why do n't you go away get away,

   steam has reliable servers . 
  evidence disproving this : [ steam 's twitter account ] ( http://twitter.com/steam_support ) , with several downtime announcements every week . 
  mega creeps also give less gold to the enemy team , making their farm half as efficient as yours . 
  welp , i did n't realize that . 
  because he commented with an overused meme while adding nothing to the discussion . 
  honestly , the dota2 subreddit is among the worst i 've seen in my few years here . 
  no they do n't , this is the first time they 've done this . 
  \\ \\ #productionvalue, 
  it does n't work :(, 
  i was just kidding with that comment of mine , and you 've got it wrong anyway . 
  a forward slash has no character escaping purposes at all . 
  thing was , i typed two backslashes , effectively escaping the character meant to escape the heading styling . 
  so according to you we 'd be better off without dns ? 
  using ip addresses to access everything ?

  casinos for most people are just mainly a form of entertainment . 
  statistically , every casion , every game has a margit of profit for the house : if over a huge amount of games you spend , say , $ 1000 , you 'll be out of around $ 50 . 
  we can just refer to the fifty dollars as the cost of the entertainment you got out of play ( cause who does n't like the thrill of the roulette wheel spinning ? ), 
  now , when we have it simplified like this , you 'll get a price , and entertainment value . 
  you can just compare this to other similar things : for example , you could see a movie for $ 10 , or instead play $ 1000 at a casino for $ 50 and get ( potentially ) more hours of more intense entertainment than a movie . 
  breaking the most popular types of encryption used would require way more computing power than available today . 
  why change a perfectly decent horse carriage and invent cars ? 
  that is just stupid . 
  as a matter of fact , that 's what i suggested her as well , making it a new hero . 
  i still detest the `` ai n't broke , do n't fix '' mentality plaguing innovation and detrimenting change all over the world nowadays , so i just had to mention how you ca n't say `` why change a good thing ? '', 
  in any , any case at all . 
  why would we care about this ? 
  how can you use the hungarian translation for dota 2 , jesus , it just sounds so ... awkward . 
  as a matter of fact , i 'm also a steam translator , but i just gave up on dota when i saw there was basically no reaction either when i fixed a few strings , or when i edited the glossary . 
  however much i wish this to be semantically correct , the original sentence 's verb is ` shift-queue ' , not just simply ` shift ' :(, 
  and they all use different engines , too . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/category:engine_branches ) of those if you 're interested . 
  does flak cannon not work against a batrider who used firefly ? 
  here , i believe you dropped these :, 
  o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o, 
  several people already mentioned that . 
  what no one seems to remember though is the [ original side scrolling motorbike game ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elasto_mania ) . 
  here 's the difference : when androidpolice posts such an article , they know the technical details and they dumb it down for the sake of clarity . 
  the author of this article has no idea about the technical details , that 's why he 's writing it in such a simple style . 
  he 's just making assumptions . 
  how in the hell would it be one ? 
  are sentry wards hacks ? 
  is amplify damage one ? 
  is zeus ulti a hack ? 
  is track a hack ? 
   n. ** hack ** [ h\u00e6k ] - anything that grants invisibility detection and either does n't cost 100 gold , or is not available until after around 5 minutes into the game . 
  seems legit . 
  okay . 
  how would you define the word ` hack ' ? 
  marksmanship does react to an invis hero being around . 
  is playing drow ranger an exploit ? 
  okay , i give up . 
  i do n't think i 'd ever be able to explain this to you . 
  come the fuck on , you ca n't even construct a proper , legible english sentence and you still have no idea what the words ` hack ' and ` exploit ' mean . 
  you ca n't purposefully program a hack or an exploit into the game , as that would go against the very definition of these words . 
  that was my point all along , and then you start spewing shit about how imbalanced this would be . 
  who the fuck ever said anything about balance ? 
  is there any way to know how this information density changed through the history of humanity ? 
  not really , navi did n't need to time anything precisely , they were just mashing on a button -- they could simply do that , while ig could n't , since they did actually have to time their spells precisely to come right after the sleep ends ; with that and the fact that most spells have a casting animation it was a lot easier for navi to pop their stuff before ig could do anything . 
  the amazing thing about the play is the then unheard of strategy of giving away the dreaded wombo combo just to destroy it with the magic immunity when the enemy tries to use it . 
  i do n't see how analyzing wifi passwords would help google . 
  do you think the game has a way to determine the intention of your messages ? 
  naturally it 'll work as described above :, 
   the countdown will only start if you start the sentence with gg . 
  so `` ggwp '' works but not `` this is gg '',
