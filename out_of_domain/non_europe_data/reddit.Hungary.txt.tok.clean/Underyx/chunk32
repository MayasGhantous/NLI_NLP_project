  you 'll need to have some basic programming skills to understand how to use it . 
  i 'd say you should even take it a step further , and actually contact the developers of that game you saw . 
  who knows , being indie devs , they might be really cool guys and offer you some advice , give you the reasoning behind some of their design decisions , perhaps help you market your game by mentioning it here or there , but at the very least , you 'll avoid them calling you out on your potential ` plagiarism ' that would create some bad pr later on . 
  aww , so [ well played did n't make it in time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdota2league/comments/1hjred/rd2l_team_icons_and_leagueapps_issues/cb80xxr?context=3 ) for this wave of flair ? 
  woo , love ya :d, 
  ftfy, 
  that video . 
  \\  significant improvements in performance, 
  \\  shows an increase of 0.65 % in benchmark scores, 
  this plan is fatally flawed in at least three ways . 
  welp , there 's your fourth problem . 
  ... because you did n't get it ? 
  i feel kind of sad that mostly everyone seems to take the stance that ` phil brought this on himself by being an asshole ' , as if no one actually even took a glance at the post i linked and everyone just saw this as an opportunity to share their thoughts about the cancellation of fez 2 itself . 
  there 's almost no discussion whatsoever about the blog post , especially the following passage :, 
   i met a fellow indie dev at gdc who got on to the topic of dealing with anonymous internet abuse being hurled at him . 
  we chatted a bit , and he had a big smile on his face as we talked about the different people and what they had said to us / threatened us with . 
  he was smiling with relief , because he realized it was n't just him . 
  he was n't being picked on , he was n't doing anything wrong , he was just a game developer , and that means the internet thinks he is a punch bag . 
  sorry , everyone , i just felt like sharing how disappointed i am with / r/games right now . 
  intriguing ? 
  nah , not really , it 's a category for blog posts about the ti3 prelims . - .

  is this supposed to be a phone conversation ? 
  for what it 's worth , i can verify that / u/irvinefan is a glass explorer . 
  on the other hand , as he said , he does not have an invite yet . 
  so bet to reserve one , maybe , for when he gets to invite someone ? 
  good call , adding this to op right now . 
  i must admit , i do n't know the specifics , but i 'd assume there 's gon na be another batch of invites sent out sometime ( days/weeks/months ) later . 
  here 's the new commands i could find :, 
  `` dota_ti_announcements_left_cycle_time '' = `` 8.0 '' client archive, 
  `` dota_ti_announcements_no_team_logos '' = `` 0 '' client archive,

  if you 're using gmail , you can register with modified versions of your address that will seem like different emails to sony , but will still all be tied to your account . 
  for instance , if your email address is ` dbmew@gmail.com`, try registering as ` db.mew@gmail.com`, which gmail considers identical to your existing address but sony does not . 
  you just completely changed how i view writing , it has never dawned on me before that a writer can manipulate the reader 's inner voice for better results . 
  writing always seemed like a bunch of set rules that you could just follow to craft a perfect block of text , but now i see it more like a form of art with lots of room for creative freedom . 
  willing to publicly request another aviate code at the increased risk of being downvoted due to loss of novelty in this type of comment . 
  apparently thousands of people want to do that . 
  the project will probably reach 10 million dollars in backings and yet your comments imply that this is an absolutely outlandish idea . 
  if only the project goal , which is a relatively arbitrary number , were around half the amount of money it is now , the whole thing could just as well be a success . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 're mistaken , as that clearly does n't add up to 8 million dollars . 
  i do n't think you 're aware that this count of 347 is only applicable to the new price -- the previous goals that granted a phone were removed and replaced by this one , and i do n't think there 's a way for us to check how many of those were sold . 
  probably a third of the goal will be hit by the end , which is n't quite ` nowhere enough ' . 
  and while i agree thaht manufacturing a phone purely through crowdfunding is probably too ambitious , i was arguing against / u/mrana 's implication that people are not willing to spend $ 700 for an unseen product . 
  if ubuntu edge , the first all-out kickstarter for such an expensive product already reached this much , i am sure that there exists a product that costs less , is better , and/or is marketed more that could reach its goal through thousand dollar preorders . 
  arbitrary , as in there could be another $ 700 product that requires much less total cost to set up . 
  yes . 
  i never said this particular project will not fail . 
  i was arguing against these words of / u/mrana :, 
   who wants to spend 700 for a product that nobody had seen or reviewed and wo n't ship til may 2014 ? 
   if ford says , `` give me $ 700 today and i 'll give you a new car in 2014 . '', 
  i 'd give them the money . 
  and that right there is the point i was trying to make against this comment of / u/mrana :, 
   who wants to spend 700 for a product that nobody had seen or reviewed and wo n't ship til may 2014 ? 
  exactly . 
  sorry to be so anticlimactic with concluding my argument , but the whole point i was trying to make was that products do exist where manufacturing could be arranged with money solely from people blindly making thousand dollar preorders . 
  i was trying to prove this mostly cause / u/mrana implied that the whole ubuntu edge thing was a stupid idea to begin with for lack of people willing to preorder expensive products . 
  to summarize , i was trying to say that this depends on a number of factors and mostly due to lack of precedent , the ubuntu team had no way to reliably gauge if the project would turn out to be successful . 
  my apologies on that , ` arbitrary ' was n't the best choice of words there , i think i 'll have to play the ` english is not my first language ' card here . 
  to elaborate , what i meant is that manufacturing cost is n't directly proportional to the price of a product , and therefore there 's no set number of preorders you need to have for a successful kickstarter , which again , makes it more difficult to judge if a certain kickstarter is too ambitious . 
  that is incorrect -- please read the rest of the comment thread . 
  i 'd love to hear you chip in afterwards , though !, 
  here 's a ( very unlikely and extreme ) counterexample : digital distributed goods . 
  let 's say i make a promise to make some software , a movie , or some music that , for some reason , costs $ 700 . 
  let 's also assume that it is good enough to get at least a hundred preorders . 
  $ 70,000 can in some cases already be enough to cover the development and distribution costs in such a case . 
  here 's another extreme counterexample : i decide to make a simple chair , price it at $ 700 and let marketing do its thing . 
  people might purchase my chair for some weird reason at this high price , allowing me to carry my project out only because one chair has such a low cost of manufacturing . 
  last counterexample : a product based on intellectual property , be it either some new invention , or copyrighted material . 
  let 's say i invented time travel , and amazingly , the invention is so simple that i can get myself a copy for 5 dollars . 
  however , before i release said product on the market , i 'll naturally mark the price up to , say , $ 700 . 
  in another case i might be the owner of the copyright on some really popular movie character , be the sole manufacturer of crappy action figures , and sell each figure for $ 700 because i 'm that greedy .
