  what :d, 
  well , he * is * supposed to be the minister of youth . 
  i was hoping for darude to make a live music act appearance . 
  how disgusting . 
  25 dollars and the particles do n't change ? 
  what is this madness ? 
  why is there no class action lawsuit going yet ? 
  why wo n't anyone think of all those poor souls who pay 25 dollars for a cosmetic item and do n't get particle effects ? 
  and there 's only a 50 % chance that they 'd cycle in that order !, 
  that 's the total amount of gold that a team has farmed/accumulated in the game , regardless of what happened to it . 
  in contrast , net worth is the sum of the currently available gold on the team and the value of their items , so gold spent on buybacks , on tp scrolls and other consumables , or even gold lost cause of dying does n't count . 
  and spikes when people use buyback . 
  you mean kay-c ? 
  experiencing the plot of a game in its entirety seems to be no less of a win condition than the examples you provided . 
  do you think otherwise ? 
  ... you understand * your own * frustration ? 
  ~ ~ that is not true at all . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ you do n't even get a dialog when you get an item , you generally get a dialog after your next death in team fortress 2 . 
  if 5 hours passed since your last death , the dialog might say you got 10 new items or so . ~ ~, 
  ** edit : ** i thought you referred to the anti-idle update they released a few years ago , was n't aware of this new one . 
  i think you should consider 1 coin for all 10 players after a match . 
  that 's complete bullshit . 
  watermarking is out of the question for obvious reasons , and i just checked exif on a saved file and there 's no personally identifying data saved there . 
  can you give me a source on that , perhaps ?

  ... guild theme goes with everything ? 
   \\* holds up spork \\*, 
  oh yeah , i found that . 
  that 's the [ $ 5 perk ] ( http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beyond-the-summit-esports-studio/x/2376930 ) though , i was wondering about the $ 10 one . 
  edit : for the record , here 's [ the credits thingie ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit/c/2311448 ) you mentioned . 
  please read what i was asking . 
  that is not a shoutout . 
  do you think the point of multiple reward tiers was to have your name listed under a different category ? 
  it was n't . 
  anyways , i emailed bts and they answered , see op for their reply . 
  they do indeed , but not like a few hundreds of new signups ( even that many wo n't happen ) would be out of ordinary at all for the most popular game in the world . 
  check updated op ; got a reply from bts on the issue . 
  it was not unexpected , they [ announced it earlier today . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/steam_support/status/372462196342919168 ), 
  it seems to have happened at an oddly similar time , especially considering that the earlier outage according to the steam users graph ended at 8:15 pm cdt as well . 
  edit : they even specifically said that [ there will be two outages today . 
  ] ( http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=34864767&amp;postcount=620 ) i do n't see why you would claim this is unrelated . 
  what does ` switching a client to html5 ' even mean ? 
  oh , i did n't see this was a mac/linux only change , so he means that the html5 video element should be used on windows as well . 
  well , then i do n't see any other reason to keep using flash other than the fact that it 's a tried and true method , while i 've encountered a bunch of bugs while using the html5 youtube player ( under webkit and admittedly over the last few years ) , and depending on various factors ( different hardware , whether rendering is software accelerated or not , etc. ), 
  there might be a number of problems that might pop up . 
  it 's just not worth the change even is using a html5 player would be a nicer solution in most cases , if 1 % of the player base encounters bugs they would n't get with flash . 
  also , i 'm not sure about this , but the old videos were youtube embeds , right ? 
  the changelog mentions video tags specifically , so they might be serving the new videos off of their own servers . 
  it would make sense to try and direct most of the bandwidth usage generated by video plays to a third party 's servers . 
  ` quite an impact ' is an overstatement . 
  this is less than a 20 % increase in clock frequency , so , as an illustration ( note that this does n't really have any meaningful correlation with cpu speed ) if a person 's model had 10,000 polygons on the ps4 , it 'd only have around two thousand more on the xbox one . 
  and even that would only be the case if the developer actually bothers to create two different sets of assets for the two platforms . 
  does being in a video grant you magical omnipotence powers on the internet so that you can always see when your scene is linked somewhere ? 
   uhh , no . 
  it actually does n't . 
  then how is the ` guy in the video not seeing it until this post ' thing relevant ? 
  first thing in your comment | second thing in your comment, 
  even the guy in the video did n't see it twice ... | ... so you 're on reddit too much, 
  \\ ^ this is your reasoning | \\ ^ this is your statement, 
  this does n't make any sense | therefore this does n't make sense either with this reasoning, 
  i pointed out that this is stupid in my comment | i did n't think it was necessary to explicitly tell you that this also is stupid as a result then, 
  so when i was attacking your reasoning , if it still is n't clear ... | ... i was attacking this statement as well . 
  not to mention the fact that to see both the original post and this repost on reddit , you need to spend a grand total of around 10 seconds on reddit , which you somehow managed to not realize . 
  oh , and also , fuck your condescending tone . 
  so then if you repick to support , you 're not gon na be able to get the sentries for dewarding . 
  how is that worse than having 5 carries on your team ? 
   also two last hits = about 90 gold , unless you last hitted two ranged creeps, 
  that 's also just ridiculous , if finding those to last hits takes only 8 seconds you already got the remaining 10 gold . 
   anything ideas, 
  note to self : do n't just click submit after rewriting half your title :(, 
  a menu option called ` fantasy league ' does certainly suggest that , to answer your question . 
  you were n't downvoted for your bad english , you were downvoted for adding nothing to the discussion . 
  who cares if you laughed ? 
  upvote the post and move on . 
  if his ursa what ? 
  well played , nice cast , good everything !, 
  one note to redeem myself : at [ this point ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqt5wee3amu#t=1757 ) i was intentionally not casting anything after sleep ; i was trying to bait rubick into overextending to steal my ulti . 
  on another note , i accidentally misclicked * twice * and only leveled sleep at level 8 first , that one you can laugh at me for :3, 
  well , considering that you all were yelling at me to use something already , i do n't see how i could have done it without a reason . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/xui3u/haiku_time_heals_all_wounds/ ) you go . 
  people who actively seek out surveys in a niche subreddit wo n't be representative of the masses posting to / r/pics , / r/funny , / r/aww and the like either . 
  how does android even become andr oid ? 
   you need a us credit card to have a us unlimited or premium account . 
  is this supposed to imply that other countries do not have the same restriction ? 
  i do n't see such a bug happening . 
  how would a simple database query consistently return numbers just one or two off the true value ? 
  is everyone really too awkward to mention how you have a bunch of code just lying there at the top of your post ? 
  did you assume reddit would just let you run arbitrary javascript code on their pages ? 
  oh my , i never realized this expando was for a tumblr and not a self post . 
  whoops !, 
  android facial recognition also checks if the image it 's looking at actually has depth by adjusting focus , so it ca n't be fooled by a photo . 
  android has facial recognition , and they have two countermeasures against this :, 
  the user has to blink before the phone is unlocked . 
  the camera adjusts focus until it is sure the image it 's looking as has depth and is not just a flat photo .

  scientists found that if you make a copy of a fingerprint you get a copy of said fingerprint .
