  what . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if someone steals your fingerprint * and * your phone , your biggest concern is n't how to secure it after retrieval . 
  even if you actually manage to get said phone back , i think it 'd be a bit irrational to be afraid of it getting stolen again by the same person . 
  and even then , you can still fall back on the passcode system .

  there 's no reason to assume apple is flat out lying about this , ~ ~ so the burden of proof is on you to disprove it from now on ~ ~ . 
  ** edit : ** i wish to rescind the above statement of mine for reasons described in replies to my comment . 
  however , i still do believe said information is actually properly hashed . 
  furthermore , i wish to point out that touch id is optional ; anyone who does n't trust apple with handling their fingerprint data is free to keep using a passcode or no security . 
  i do n't see any way apple could 've implemented fingerprint scanning while ensuring the users that their data is n't being misused . 
  if someone wishes to give up convenience for more privacy , they can do that . 
  i myself would not only be willing to risk apple getting my fingerprint 's information , i would not have any problem with them giving this data out to third parties , either . 
  you 're right , i 've updated my comment above . 
  you 're right , i 've updated my comment above . 
  at that point you 're approaching the time and effort required to brute force a passcode . 
  well , then good thing the iphone is a consumer product . 
  also , good thing everyone is free to choose if they want to be using touch id . 
  you think the data you 're securing is worth too much to be using biometrics ? 
  then do n't use touch id . 
  no , it is not in addition to a passcode . 
  what i was saying is that if you decide to model someone 's face and make an active effort to fool android 's camera , you are spending as much time as if you would be if you were to just brute force a passcode on another phone . 
  oh , do n't worry about that , i actually read that part right without even noticing the typo . 
   ( well you can build a jig to do it . . but it will still take many minutes/hours, 
  how is that different from setting up an environment to fool face unlock ? 
   or might not work at all , because you only are allowed to mistype it so many times ), 
  even when accounting for the timeout after several incorrect guesses , the total time required to brute force a passcode is still just as trivial as it is to fool the camera . 
  well , i 'm pretty sure you could remove the print reader yourself , or of course , easiest of all , just not use an iphone 5s . 
  only if you can move the image exactly in sync with how the camera shifts its focus . 
  tasker and titanium backup are n't that far off . 
  the sad part about those is how they both tried to fix their ui , but neither of them got what that actually would 've meant . 
  hey , can you fix hungary 's link , please ? 
  thanks for rubbing it in . 
  ^ ^  late by 17 days as the mod, 
  doing what now ? 
  as the patch is n't that interesting , i 'll try and start an interview with / u/reads _ small_text_bot here . 
  how do you feel about yourself , reads_small_text_bot ? 
  what ? 
  naw , i do n't even know what the word ` edit ' means , let alone the way i could do that to a post of mine . 
  i just had a natural talent for speaking to bots since i was 6 and a radioactive robot bit me . 
  the little guys just love me , for some weird reason . 
  oh that 's right , you do , smally :d, 
  i do n't normally like fish , but tweet_poster 's roast code was just heavenly last year . 
   he does n't hear you like that . 
  hey , i 'm right here :(, 
  [ game was hard . 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/gimliboy98/ ), 
  i almost missed out on this ( actually really nice ) joke/humorous observation due to your lack of capitalization . 
  please pay attention ? 
  seeing a comment in all lowercase letters just reeks of low effort content to me , and i almost just skipped over this one cause of that . 
  oh , that is a very logical observation !, 
  so , i had a look at your profile and , uh ... five years , five time redditgifts participant , reddit gold -- them , i understand , but you ? 
  do you not miss the quality of reddit comments from a few years ago ? 
  from when people actually made an effort , tried to be insightful , and cared about aesthetics ? 
  and you 're seriously doing the ` annoying the grammar nazi by intentionally replying with grammatical errors ' joke ? 
  i mean , you and i both surely know this is one of the most overdone jokes on reddit , how can you possibly still enjoy it after this long a time on here ? 
  well , i 'm quite sure that grammatically , the song title is supposed to be capitalized as well , but seeing how the comment was a play on the title of the video , i would say full-on title case would 've been the most appropriate way to spell it . 
  but of course , that all is pretty meaningless . 
  ( seriously , i am aware , this is not sarcasm . ), 
  i checked the commenter 's comment history , and most of his comments have sloppy capitalization , while their content is actually quite worthy at times , such as here -- now , at the time of my first reply 's writing , i genuinely was just trying to help him , as i assumed there 'd be lots of other people like me , who just skim over the obviously poorly written comments , assuming that it 's not worth the time to read them ; if this comment were around four times as long , i probably would n't have read it at all . 
  so then , here i was , trying to help the guy find more exposure based on an assumption of mine that is clearly faulty , that people on reddit still care . 
  and that 's of course an assumption that i know to be untrue , but i keep lying to myself , trying to convince myself that i 'm not alone with this . 
  and lastly : i do have a bit of fun on reddit . 
  not as much as i 'd like to , and if i knew a place that 's akin to reddit a few years ago , i 'd be gone in a heartbeat , but sadly i 'm stuck here , and i occasionally try and convince people to take this more seriously -- some seem open to changing , others ignore me , and the rest gets mad . 
  i 'm happy even if i get one person to care more . 
  i almost feel like i 'm actually changing their personality for the better , even in real life . 
  and yes , i know how stupid all this sounds . 
  welp , i guess you 're right , i should do that next time . 
  ## intentional feeding reports :, 
   this ** noob ** keeps walking into enemy base and has 40 deaths . 
   pudge said i was a ** noob ** and started feeding kills to the enemy in retaliation . 
  ## communications report :, 
   drow keeps calling everyone a ** nazi ** . 
  i do n't think your system would work as intended . 
  thanks for the reminder , i 've actually had a few looks at how nlp works ( not that i understand a lot of it ) . 
  anyways , i believe implementing a reliable nlp system just for the report system would use up way too many resources for it to be worth it . 
  oh , i forgot to mention in my other comment that an even larger problem is how hard it would be to reliably parse the typically broken english that dota 2 players use . 
  ( writing a new comment so that you get another orangered . ), 
  i assumed unsupported languages could be just discarded , it 's pretty easy to find out what language a given text is written in . 
  hey , so twitch lacks the resources to provide a quality service , let 's leech on their streams so that we use even more bandwidth and they get even less money -- that 'll surely solve their problem !, 
  you ca n't just magically upgrade your servers overnight , you need time and lots of money to do that . 
  they 've reportedly been working on this , but apparently they ca n't keep up with the growth of the site 's userbase . 
  i do n't see how that justifies what you 're suggesting . 
  yes . 
  and it 's immoral . 
   why should i play games with less than a third of that , 13 years later ? 
  because you get better graphical fidelity . 
  i have had that for around 4 months now and i still always forget it . 
  i do n't know , but i was waiting for this app so much ... it 's really great , user-friendly , and smooth !, 
  thank you so much , blackberry team !,

  obviously . 
  * it 's fiiiine * , happens to the best of us :d, 
  would n't it be in server.dll ? 
   you can not manipulate the screen directly, 
  that 's not true at all . 
  also , even if it were , how likely is it that they never realized the camera is too low and does n't work as intended ? 
   then i wonder why they did it like this . 
  it probably was just less of a hassle to do it this way .
