  we do n't know for sure , though . 
  the app is nice , but please change the name to ` hearthstone reference ' or ` hearthstone codex ' or something . 
  the current one is confusing . 
  i do n't think anyone ever meant the ` number cypher ' to be made up from the letters ' positions in the alphabet , rather the phone keypad code ( the one used with phone numbers such as 1-800-fernnow ) , which 'd be 3376 . 
  oh , my bad , i somehow missed that post , got it !, 
  not magically , but logically . 
  with proper management the point where number of developers hit diminishing returns still should be way higher than how many of those 60 people actually work on the dota 2 codebase . 
  and they 're also notoriously disorganized . 
  nobody cares , apparently ~ ~ ~, 
  in a positive sense , it is . 
  outdated ? 
  no , sir . 
  just because a client does n't have a shiny , flashy , bloated interface , it is n't necessarily outdated . 
  i sense a train crash coming up right here ^, 
  [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gqc2x6a.png ) cause this will be gone by the time someone sees the post tomorrow . 
  or the day after that . 
  or whatever . 
  ... so the logical course of action for him to take would be to lie to the community ? 
  as a matter of fact , when this was first posted in this subreddit , it already was merely a crosspost from / r/cringepics . 
   marry me, 
  ... that 's what he 's saying ? 
  [ put into perspective . 
  well , what music * is * for everyone ? 
  not if you have adhd . 
  a quick look at your recent reddit activity tells me that you might not be aware of / r/truegaming 's existence . 
  if so , come join us over there for some quality analytical discussion !, 
  glad i could help !, 
  if you want to go even deeper , there 's :, 
  * / r/games for news and a bit more lighthearted discussion , though you surely knew this one, 
  * / r/gamedesign for pure game design discussion, 
  * / r/indiegaming for indie game news and discussion, 
  * / r/gamesociety is a book club kinda thing for games, 
  * / r/gamedev if you 're that serious about it, 
  and if you 're looking for depth outside of gaming as well :, 
  * / r/truereddit is full of mostly news related discussion, 
  * / r/trueaskreddit and / r/insightfulquestions for , well , insightful questions, 
  * / r/depthhub for aggregating insightful discussion from all over reddit, 
   i do n't want to use google + , ** it has n't succeeded ** for a reason, 
  what makes you think it has n't succeeded ? 
  in their latest [ bunch of usage data ] ( http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/10/google-hangouts-and-photos-save-some.html ) google claimed they have 300 million monthly users who interact with the google + stream . 
  i do n't have any sources to cite here , but i 'm pretty sure it 's a reasonable assumption that google + 's growth is at least on par with that of facebook . 
  i do n't think inactive made-only-for-youtube accounts count , as watching videos does not make active on the stream ; they listed a different number for total active google profiles ( 540 million ) . 
  also , one could argue that facebook user stats are also inflated , as most likely they count everyone touching external like/share buttons and comment systems as active users as well . 
  oh , i think where your problem is ; google + does n't seem to be * that * popular in the usa , yeah , which incidentally is the country where most the content you 're consuming originates from . 
  it , however , is loaded with people not from the usa who you 'd never actually get in contact with . 
  a fun way to see this for yourself would be to start a public hangout on google + ; people mostly from the middle east and africa will just start flowing in , with most of them not even being able to speak english . 
  i probably have seen around 50 random people joining my hangouts when i made them public , and if i recall correctly , none of them seemed to be from an english speaking country . 
  content you consume ( reddit and such ) still mostly originates from the usa , and honestly , the uk is n't that big on google + either , which still does n't mean a lot ( these two countries hardly are a huge chunk of the world 's population ) . 
  oh , and did i mention that i have 61 people who have me in my circles and whom i also have in my circles ( from all over europe , and i actually know these people ) ? 
  to put this to scale , i have 99 facebook friends at the moment . 
  and at this point it 's just your anecdotal evidence against mine . 
  oh , i 'm so sorry , i just kind of assumed hostility -- i never should 've done that . 
  in that case , i do n't think we 'll ever see clear data anytime soon ; every social network cherrypicks to be able to present the nicest numbers possible , and if they started giving entirely accurate numbers the reactio would either be ` really ? 
  you counted * that ? 
  * ' , or they 'd be forced to give a number lower than in their previous press release . 
  for anyone else frantically looking for a maxed out team composition , [ here 's one . 
  even you tirelessly adding ` haha ' to the ends of some of your sentences seemed sarcastic as opposed to heartwarming and kind like they do now . 
  *** what is reddit doing to me ?!, 
  no , do n't say that , it was * entirely and exclusively * my fault that i assumed sarcasm . 
  and really , i 'm sorry . 
  oh no , now i have two pieces of anecdotal evidence against my only one !, 
  i guess you win . 
  as proved by ... ? 
  ie10 and ie11 are actually fairly decent . 
  internet explorer 11 definitely has better rendering code and runs javascript faster than chrome . 
  that 's like saying ` it 's because you 're using a computer ' . 
  why did the html5 player start doing that ? 
  well i thought it said southern dialect , do i win ? 
  they should make all int heroes use storm spirit 's model , all agi heroes earth spirit 's one , and all str heroes ember spirit . 
  but he 's red . 
  who the hell downvotes this ? 
  whoever did so , or even thinks of doing so , please familiarize yourself with the [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) . 
  tree fed the enemy . 
  where do i submit a karma claim form for ` unintentional prediction of event ' ? 
  cause i have [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/1k6tw4/all_rise_for_the_swedish_national_anthem/cbm7qdk ) from 3 months ago . 
  wow this dotted background really makes text near illegible . 
  thanks for the design lessons , spg !, 
  well considering that the dota 2 mlg stream is breaking viewership records , it seems like you were wrong . 
   dota client bugged i 'm trying but it wo n't let me reconnect . 
   the exploit can be used wherever dotatv is enabled , including mm , tmm , lobby games , and even tournament games . 
  an accomplice could still do it for you . 
   if you do n't have rosh warded , you 're in a subpar game, 
  we 've seen numerous surprise roshes just yesterday at mlg , due to dewarding or whatever else that might happen to let the enemy sneak in there . 
   if you do n't maintain knowledge of what the enemy has , is building , and will probably build , you are in a subpar game . 
  this could reveal a hidden rapier and so much more , the possibilities , again , are endless , merely because of dota 's complexity . 
   if you do n't have map/game awareness and ca n't comprehend their entire team is missing , you are in a subpar game . 
  you 're saying that as if no one ever died to a smoke gank in competitive dota . 
  there are times when you can only guess as to where the opposing team is located . 
  also , you still get all the ward locations and gold amounts on the enemy team . 
  ** edit : **, 
   and you 're still two minutes behind , so when you unpause , the spectator still has to wait the two minutes to see the rest of the game . 
  this leads me to believe that you misunderstood the nature of the exploit , too . 
  the spectator reconnects to the match before the unpause happens . 
  that , to the best of my knowledge , is indeed true . 
  however , you could still do it with tournaments that have tickets . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  no , seriously though , competitive dota does n't consist of those few top tier teams exclusively . 
  you have shittons of small regional teams that i would n't trust with this , especially since there 's no easy way to detect someone using the exploit . 
  why do i get the feeling that no one actually read my post :(, 
  i actually detailed how a fix would work .
