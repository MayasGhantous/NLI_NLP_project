  read the part that says ` how this could be fixed ' . 
  please . 
  i 'm deeply disturbed by the fact that the act of cheating apparently does n't irk your sense of justice at all . 
  cheating in a friendly match already is n't nice , but actually winning prize money via cheating is a terrible thing to do . 
  you really need to get your morality straight , man . 
  you actually had me worried there until i checked your comment history and saw that you 're constantly trolling , insulting people , and spewing nonsense in your comments . 
  here 's a friendly reminder that you might be a worse person online than you 'd initially think , which might be something you do n't actually want . 
  ( i know i would n't . ), 
  try to think about how you 're conversing with other actual humans and reevaluate your approach to them , please . 
  this is n't really related to anything you said in this comment thread , more like to your online persona in general . 
  i genuinely hope i could help . 
  dotatv would then be frozen 2 minutes before the pause happened . 
  you could start spectating , but nothing would ever move until the game is unpaused . 
  several tournaments make granting 5 minute pauses mandatory on request of the opposing team . 
  oh , right , yeah , that 's true . 
  okay this is the last straw . 
  who the fuck was talking about public games only ? 
  why wo n't anyone actually read my post ? 
  i do n't know , i rarely see tournaments where people do n't wait three minutes for the opponent to reconnect . 
  how would i know ? 
  whoever wants to win a game and has no morals . 
  it 's not like hacks are unheard of in multiplayer games . 
  so now you 're proud of spewing stupid shit , just because it seems like an unimportant issue to you ? 
  please just do n't make uninformed comments if you 're too lazy to read a few paragraphs of text . 
  just move on . 
  edit : well , surprise , surprise , turns out this is yet another troll account . 
  why do most of these people frequent / r/dota2 ? 
  it makes me pretty depressed . 
  it 's pretty difficult to accidentally turn a website upside down . 
  now show me a single developer who types that out accidentally . 
  also , the ` - moz ` , ` - ms ` and ` - o ` prefixes are n't needed anymore . 
  the ` - o ` one especially because opera started using webkit as well . 
  or if you live in australia , amirite ? 
  and for what reason would someone commit code that makes half the page be shown upside down :(, 
  well . 
  however much i do n't wish to accept this conclusion , i ca n't possibly argue with that . 
  nope , sorry , the game was based entirely on this b&w contrast , it was 2d ( top-down ) , and it had pretty slick visuals , too , not something you 'd expect from an old flash game . 
  i do n't think it was nearly as chaotic as those games , sorry . 
  i think maybe your triangle could n't even move freely , you might have only been able to switch between two positions : the middle of the black and of the white halves of the screen . 
   would n't you still be able to see everything up until the delay catches up to the pause ? 
  no , you would n't , that 's the point : the delay will only catch up to the pause after you unpause the match .

  whoa . 
  / u/andarnio lied . 
  what are you talking about , this part is a lot nicer . 
  or as we do it in the 21st century . 
  ... well , i mean , having to do that is already a pretty bad sign , but not using php is a good step . 
  err ... well ... back then it was cool . 
  i feel [ jeff 'd ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1bl3kigfbc#t=4 ) . 
  i 'm sorry , how does that prove anything ? 
  alright , here 's a bit more detailed answer . 
  i 've checked those sites you listed , and their median date of release is 2003 . 
  that 's 10 years ago . 
  here 's a few things that happened when php was this widely used -- in 2003 :, 
  * internet explorer had 95 % market share, 
  * intel was introducing new pentium 4 cpus, 
  * the first sata hard drives were being released . 
  a high end hard drive was 120 gb large . 
  * mac os x tiger was released , including new things such as apple 's web browser , safari . 
  * 30 % of people were using windows 98 as their operating system . 
  * the bittorrent protocol was going through its early iterations . 
  * warcraft iii : tft was released . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure it 's a great idea to just stay with that technology . 
  not like we have 3d printers , autonomous cars , drones and high-res photos from mars today , right . 
  during the time all these technological advancements came to be , php finally realized with version 5.4 that ` register_globals ` should perhaps be removed , so that users ca n't be allowed to modify server-side php variables with get parameters . 
  so what ? 
  hahahaha . 
  well to be fair i * am * a redditor . 
  so i guess that 's kinda cheating . 
  all of them are :d, 
  well , to be fair , the stream was free , and even that small amount of ticket revenue goes to the prize pool , which in turn provides more incentive for the teams to want to perform well , making the whole tournament more enjoyable even for the ones watching only the stream , without paying anything . 
  thank you for my childhood jesus christ man . 
  i used to go on reflexive.com , download a game or two every day , and then use your reflexive keygen to play them . 
  i think i went through pretty much their whole library , and i was always looking forward to their weekly new releases . 
  like , whoa . 
  you ca n't believe how much i appreciate your work :d, 
  i still remember that orange window , the eclipse logo , the way it faded in when i opened the generator and everything so much nostalgia oh gawd, 
  edit : what 's wrong with you people why do i have more upvotes than he does , this man deserves all the karma , come on . 
  d'aww , really ? 
  i ca n't even express how happy that makes me . 
  i 'd love having a look at that video if you ever get around to making it , thank you so much for watching !, 
  right now i see a 7 to 4 ratio , which is 6 to 3 if you consider the default upvote after posting . 
  that 's double the upvotes . 
  also that guy is fucking amazing . 
  just sayin ' . 
  i 'm trying to do that , for lack of a better way , via words . 
  yes !, 
  oh god i love you so much :d, 
  indeed !, 
  and from now on i 'm stalking the creator , he seems such a cool guy , like , whoa . 
  [ here 's a blog post he wrote ] ( http://bokstuff.com/flipside/ ) about the game . 
  you might wan na check out his other projects , too , they 're all great . 
   gameplay,
