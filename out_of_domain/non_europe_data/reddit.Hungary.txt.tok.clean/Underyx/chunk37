   - skeleton king : removed for pressing ceremonial reasons, 
  oh my god you were right .

   all hail wraith king !, 
  you got it wrong , actually . 
  it 's not the whole team getting an abandon , but the whole party . 
  hover over it for even more amusement . 
  obviously . 
  does n't make it less funny , though . 
  also , while we 're at patreon , you guys should also check out [ edje 's ] ( http://www.patreon.com/edje ) page ( and [ his videos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/xxedjexx/videos ) ) , too . 
  i just pledged an admittedly pretty low amount of money to him for each of his major videos a day or two ago , and i was really shocked to see that i was * the only one who made a pledge * : /, 
  come on , guys , machinima creators really deserve more pay than just lowly ad money !, 
  especially edje , he 's awesome . 
  and also the [ off season ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcr3va-_vl8 ) series !, 
   $ 6 from 3 patrons, 
  hah , i 'd like to think i 'm personally responsible for every single dollar there . 
  also , in the meantime , op has $ 1 pledged , sad times . 
  ... that 's what he said ? 
  valve can subsidize the manufacturing of steamboxes ; they pay 10 % of the manufacturing cost for every box , and they make that money back in game sales . 
  [ i know that feel , bro :( ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5zmsksx.png ), 
  ( yes . 
  i did indeed lose all of those games . ), 
   the arg api, 
  what the hell do you think that even means ? 
  it 's a pair of arcane boots , a mekansm , and half an assault cuirass . 
  next question ? 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://dotabuff.com/players/36489577/matches ), 
  yeah , as / u/bravetriforcur guessed correctly below , i 've started building the ac just for fun after we have already broken base . 
  the support items were for , um , supporting . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure you are thinking of the wrong game . 
  as everyone knows , buying better items does n't help you win dota , so i obviously do n't usually try to do that . 
  d'awww !, 
  it will surely get better . 
  right , guys ? 
  right ? 
  can you please include the tag [ offering ] in your comment ? 
  thanks !, 
  whee , thanks for the appreciation !, 
  it 's really just that i 've never learned how to properly play any other roles , though . 
  it also does n't count for a lot when my carry randomly decides to tp out from their trilane and instead they want to be constantly zoned out in the offlane :(, 
  that is correct !, 
  i 'm trying , though :(, 
  it was between 2700 and 2800 when i checked in console . 
  sure , [ here 's what i have ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5zmsksx.png ) so far . 
  i usually queue with higher level players , and i myself am just used to trilaning more than duo lanes . 
  the theory of dota i really do n't have as big a problem with as i do with the the execution . 
  made it myself , sir , i just noted down my mmr after every match i played . 
  ha , finally someone noticed !, 
  it was fun reading all the random complaints about me building ac with no one noticing the actual problem of there being one on the team already . 
  anyways , as i said before , i started building ac when we already had a definitive lead , and i did n't care to check if anyone else was building one . 
  i announced in team chat i was building it and got no replies , though , so it might very well be possible that someone got it only after i started . 
  in this naga game we actually ran an aggro trilane with randoms and got like 4 kills three minutes in . 
  one of my biggest problems when carrying is me unconsciously prioritizing denies over last hits . 
  i once had a 126-73 cs on sniper . _ . 
  i know !, 
  but i still feel like i have a lot to learn even in my role , and there 's a shortage of supports in pubs anyhow , so i thought it 'd be better if i just kept at it . 
  well , the network never went down for me , and i finished the game half an hour ago . 
  i 'm not very hopeful , really :(, 
  checked , no trace of the match at all . 
  i 'm just gon na go cry in a corner . 
  yup , just got the result . 
  though in fact , my match ended 26 minutes before i made the post . 
  well , except for * that * , yeah . 
  okay !, 
  between 2700 and 2800 . 
   do you like sarcasm ? 
  why , yes i do !, 
  [ here . 
  i 'm a software developer/web designer . 
  i really do not . 
  no , keep at it , that 's what you 're supposed to do !, 
  it says wwwwwwwwww because the whole point of this was to test how long a team tag can be to have it still fit on the screen , so valve used the widest letter there is and saw how many of them they could put there , to then make that the length limit for team tags . 
  that 's what i said !, 
  is it not edgy enough ? 
  though i did n't have a lot to work with neither in terms of stacking material , nor in terms of camera ( gee , the date on that piece of paper is just completely illegible . ), 
  for the hosting , try [ github ] ( http://pages.github.com/ ) !, 
  it 's free and gives you awesome customizability . 
  downside is that it 's not * that * easy to set up ; though they just released a neat little revised tutorial a day or two ago . 
  if you 're having trouble setting it up , feel free to contact me in whatever way ; i just published [ my personal site ] ( http://underyx.me ) using their services . 
  we have one rule , one single rule , and you broke it . 
  please post this in [ the dedicated invite thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1t4hki/the_official_and_pinned_rgoogleglass_invite_thread/ ) instead , if you still have invites left . 
  d'aww :d, 
  edit : this most likely is n't made by the group in op , but the creator should somehow be affiliated with them . 
  i 'm not sure .

   the police do use it . 
  source ? 
  before everyone jumps on the fud fueled swiftkey hate bandwagon ... okay , i 'm too late . 
  anyways , this is most likely not the fault of swiftkey , not the least bit . 
  the password field you enter you bank account password in is probably not marked up properly ; i 'd guess it 's marked as a regular text field and then modified in whatever hacky way to mask the user input . 
  this is horrible , ** horrible ** development practice , for this very reason ( among others ) . 
  go complain to your bank ; if you can give me the name of the app/bank you use i might be able to investigate further and give you a definitive explanation . 
  correct . 
  and not only is it not swiftkey 's responsibility , it 's impossible for it to do , too . 
  bit of a sidenote here ; what the hell is up with banks being so shitty at security ? 
  my bank disallows passwords longer than 8 characters , and wo n't let me use special characters either . 
  the fact that any developer ever implemented a system that can only handle up to 8 alphanumeric characters and did n't think that this might not be an appropriate way to handle passwords just baffles me .
