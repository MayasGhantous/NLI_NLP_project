  how does this even happen ? 
  i mean , even if for some weird reason you 're forced to use some esoteric hashing algorithm that maxes out at 8 characters , just split the password into two strings and store two hashes ? 
  ** edit : ** ~ ~ out of curiosity i went and checked the password change form again . 
  it says my new password ca n't match my old one in more than three characters . 
  ** what . 
  the . 
  ** am i being ignorant here or is there really no way to check for this other than by storing the passwords in plain text ? ~ ~ [ stop listening to my sillyness , you guys .

  well , i do n't know , that does n't sound nearly as bad , since they probably just convert the string to lowercase and then hash it . 
  this way you still have to crack the hashes , even though it 'll take a lot less time to do so as you can be sure that none of the characters are uppercase letters . 
  thanks for trying to help out , but sadly i 'm not from the us . 
  from what i 've heard banks here either suck at security just as mine , or do n't offer online services at all . 
  indeed , i completely agree with you on that . 
  that 's actually decent ux design , only bad implementation . 
  android should provide a way to keep the field marked as a password one , but still display all characters . 
  ** edit : ** whoops , i thought we were talking about native apps , not html . 
  then , i guess the only reasonable solution would be to add a button which changes the field 's type to text on press and password on release . 
  this way the user is unable to actually interact with the field while it 's semantically insecure . 
  yeah , it does . 
  welp , that 's pretty irrelevant . 
  um , a brute force attack would be executed against the hash table . 
  that 's exactly what i was talking about . 
  hey there !, 
  i 'd like to ask you to speak in a more civilized manner , by doing things such as refraining from using the word ` glasshole ' , and losing the condescending tone in general .

  thank you !, 
  that message is from android and everyone with custom keyboards sees it , but it warns you about something completely unrelated . 
  yup . 
  it 's warning you about the fact that a keyboard might be malicious and be secretly recording your keypresses . 
  in this case op accuses swiftkey of being poorly designed/written and saving data from password fields in its prediction dictionary . 
  i am not . 
  there 's more explanations on how your google password got in your prediction dictionary than the one i described above ; in this case , the login form being badly written was the most likely possibility . 
  in your case , it 's a lot less likely , at least in the above form . 
  there 's no such thing here , if you forget your password you need to have it reset in person , showing identification . 
  regardless of wording , the intent behind that message is merely to warn the user about how much control he 's giving to this app and to get the user to reconsider if he trusts the software vendor enough with not reading password field . 
  in our case we did n't even have a password field to begin with . 
  redditors , obviously . 
  heh , i ca n't even begin to imagine what seeing this post title at the top of / r/android must have felt like for you . 
  and then of course the relief after opening the comments , seeing that the crowd was under control . 
  the $ 1500 should be thought of as an investment until after glass is publicly available . 
  you 're essentially paying for the privilege to be able to prepare for the product 's launch by developing apps beforehand , so that you can maximize your profits .

  no , no , you do n't understand . 
  he was using it as the end of transmission procedure word . 
   a game that is played competitively should not have so many random variables that can give one person an advantage .

  i could go ' $ 1000 says you end up with gold ' and just buy you gold myself to be out of only 4 dollars . 
  no one seems to have mentioned [ frog fractions ] ( http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions ) , which is a similar ( flash ) game from 2012 . 
  i highly recommend everyone to have a go at this if they enjoyed candy box/a dark room . 
  shares less similarities with cookie clicker , though . 
  not of the idle genre , but still related , from 2012 : [ frog fractions ] ( http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions ) . 
  ... i 'm speechless .

  last time i stole chrono in tmm , i used it on the entire enemy team , but they did n't realize i was the one using it , so they raged at their void and ended up abandoning the game they were winning . 
  the guide starts out with, 
   so , here we go . 
  add suka to every statement to sound more russian . 
  or write using capslock . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's the point of the whole thing . 
  you become a professional player by playing in tournaments , not the other way around . 
  i mean , why would you prefer watching that other inferior team play which did n't qualify because zephyr was better ? 
  he gets $ 250 for every major video he makes . 
  while this submission was posted by a known spam account , i feel like the pretense of a tv series entirely shot with glass could provide for reasonably quality discussion , or at least the video 's production quality could bring a giggle or two to a few of you . 
  therefore , i 'm manually approving the submission . 
  alright , i used beyondpod for almost two years and absolutely loved it . 
  do i want to switch to pocket casts ? 
  and if i do , why ? 
  ssssh forget i said anything . 
  as a developer you probably also understand that there are things that just can not be done under certain browsers because they lack the functionality . 
  mega makes extensive use of the html5 filesystem api , since the entire premise of the service is that all files are encrypted and decrypted client side . 
  if your browser does n't support writing files via javascript , the content just can not be decrypted , and this renders safari useless for client side encrypted file transfer . 
  well ` wa ' is the shortest solution then . 
  do i win ? 
   star trek , star wars regex, 
  but that does n't match ` wa ' !, 
  you eat it , kinglink , you just wasted a few million dollars and probably angered lots of star trek fans with your movie , ha . 
  oh god , all this time i was thinking megan was sorting through her subtitle * files * , as in the transcripts of the movies . 
  suddenly the whole comic makes a lot more sense . 
  woo , thanks a lot !, 
  and you even gave me two shoutouts , apparently :d, 
  ( in my message i was talking about how i was horrible at dota . 
  i later went on to lose my first nine ranked matches . ), 
  i 'm not sure i understand the point of using glass for this . 
  do you feel like this is any better than walking through a house with a regular camera ? 
  and if so , how ? 
  well then i do n't think they 'd really be concentric . 
  a new weekly invite thread just went up , you might want to repost this comment [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1v3mrw/2014_week_3s_official_rgoogleglass_invite_thread/ ) . 
  you used that completely right . < / sarcasm , 
  got no time to reply to all of your points right now , sorry , but dewarding a ward at 0 minutes as opposed to 2 minutes after placement would be quite a big difference , i reckon . 
  there 's no table . 
  hovering does show you the values , though . 
  it 's not . 
  presentation matters just as much .
