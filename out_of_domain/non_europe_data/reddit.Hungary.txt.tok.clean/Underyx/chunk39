  i removed this submission due to the untrue , sensationalized title . 
  feel free to repost the article with a more accurate title , though . 
  i was under the impression that all the games were bundled together and distributed that way . 
  will ask him later . 
  alrighty !, 
  i love how you crossposted this to / r/cringe as, 
   the worst augmented-reality/google glass style concept video i 've seen yet . 
  again , i * love * how you crossposted it . 
  i found it funny . 
  that 's all . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1v3mrw/2014_week_3s_official_rgoogleglass_invite_thread/ceogser ), 
  glass is n't even released yet . 
  they still are selling prototypes to developers . 
  i do n't see how that should make glass all widespread and everything . 
  yeah , those are prototypes for development . 
  okay , you need to understand one thing , and one thing only . 
  ** glass is currently not a consumer product . 
  people who buy glass now are n't buying it for everyday use ( or if they are , they do n't know what they 're doing . ), 
  people buy it as an investment , to be able to get ready for the product launch with apps and services and maximize profits . 
  yes , but that 's stupid . 
  apps made for glass now are n't made for current glass users . 
  they 're made to be prepared for the product launch . 
  the invites are still meant for people who want to capitalize on the fact that they get to use glass before it 's launched . 
  well they are n't really going to turn people away , why would they ? 
  still , glass is ** not a consumer product right now ** . 
  it 's got an absurdly marked up price and is borderline unusable , since google is n't selling the product per se , but the privilege of being able to get ready for the actual product launch with software . 
  anyone buying one for ` personal use ' is just stupid . 
  we have one single rule . 
  and you broke it :(, 
  please repost this in our invite thread . 
  [ offering ] / u/oniongrrl posted an invite offer in our subreddit but i removed the submission as per our only rule . 
  they are unwilling to post here , though , after my request ( ` no thanks , i 'll just let it go to waste . ', 
  - how weird is that , amirite ? ), 
  so i thought i 'd comment here in their name ; go message them for an invite , people ( and if you took the invite , tell us here !, 
  boy , you 're a weird one , are n't you . 
  i posted your name in the invite thread myself then , do n't be surprised if you 're gon na get messages asking for the invite . 
  i merely asked you to repost this as a comment here and removed your submission . 
  the rules section in the sidebar is 3 lines long , should n't that much to ask for to have everyone read it . 
  right above the submit button you pressed to submit that we have a notice telling you not to submit offers . 
  ` how stupid of me for assuming that the google glass subreddit was the proper place to give away an invite . ', 
  -- i think it should be apparent by now that this * is * the proper place for that . 
  that 's why we have a stickied thread dedicated to the matter . 
  again , all i did was ask you to comment here , and then when you said you did n't want to , i did it myself for you . 
  how is this even close to you ` having to be shot and banned ' ? 
   you guys go through some incredible lengths to be overbearing . 
  really ? 
  the rule is in place for the good of the members in the first place . 
  we heard complaints about invite threads being annoying and being of no real value , so i started these weekly threads . 
  and what 's being overbearing here anyway ? 
  i asked you to do one single thing and then i even did it for you myself . 
  naming them is fun , too !, 
  my hard drives are orinoco , gill ` us , equidae , celestica and kafka . 
  i find these names nice , i can remember which is which either way and it feels good to call something celestica . 
  okay , here you go :, 
  | name | type | description | origin of name, 
  | orinoco | 80gb partition on 2tb sata hdd | system partition ; os and specific software | idea for the name came from enya 's song ` orinoco flow ' . 
  do n't listen to it anymore but i liked it when i was 12 or something . |, 
  | gill ` us | 1.8 tb partition on 2tb sata hdd | main partition for work , software , games , downloads , and media | name of a french band that played at a caravan palace concert . 
  i do n't listen to them but really liked the name . |, 
  | equidae | 500gb sata hdd | currently stores file history from orinoco and gill ` us | started out from equestria , but i did n't really want to name the hdd that . 
  found a related word that was a bit more , uh , exotic sounding ? 
  | celestica | 320gb ide hdd | archived media ( music , movies , tv shows , ebooks ) | from the crystal castles song ` celestica ', 
  | kafka | 240gb ide hdd | archived games ( pc games , roms & amp ; isos for emulators ) | not franz kafka , actually , but the artist ` kafka tamura ' . 
  i do n't listen to her either , really , just had one song that i liked for a while . 
  [ offering ] / u/xordito probably still has an invite lying around [ from the last thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1v3mrw/2014_week_3s_official_rgoogleglass_invite_thread/cetvb36 ) . 
  cool !, 
  thanks for participating !, 
  oh , okay , glad you cleared that up . 
  as a matter of fact , [ global game jam 2014 ] ( http://globalgamejam.org/ ) is being held right this weekend . 
  i added that myself . - . 
  thank you !, 
  oh dear , that is not how you escape formatting . 
  just type, 
  come on , no hidden messages ? 
  [ ] ( / disappointed ! ), 
  what does it matter ? 
  they removed it . 
  he 's * very * high rated . 
   - if rubick steals lone druid 's ** summon spirit bear ** the bear will not have the items that lone druid 's has upon spell steal . 
  rubick can however equip the bear with any items he desires . 
  if rubick steals a new spell or loses the spell through death , the bear will drop any items it has equipped onto the ground . 
  what happens if the bear dies ? 
  does he drop the items then , as well ? 
  does he keep the items until the next resummon ? 
  what if rubick then loses the spell before he can resummon ? 
  good call . 
  i 'll add that link right now and if anyone has any more ideas , feel free to let me know . 
  setting up the wiki is n't a bad idea either , i 'm too busy right now to do that ^ ^ \\ ( global ^ ^ game ^ ^ jam ^ ^ 2014 , ^ ^ woo ! ), 
  but it 's gon na go straight on the top of my to do list . 
  ... o-okay :(, 
  yup , i got it , thanks for the suggestion !, 
  `` upgrade to lions ult '', 
  so is this the thread where we quote something and then say something completely unrelated ? 
  your logic is faulty since the compendium was n't generating revenue purely cause of the international . 
  had it been released independently as an item package that gave you months of battle bonus , a courier , a mythical , etc. 
  it still would 've generated revenue . 
  perhaps the dire wins shorter games more often ? 
  you ca n't count it as revenue from ti3 if most of the value provided by the product was independent of the event . 
  sure , on the surface it might look like it does n't mean anything , but i can assure you that no person with competence in business would ever attribute that revenue to the accompanying event in its entirety . 
  the connection with the event was merely a factor that drove up sales of the package .
