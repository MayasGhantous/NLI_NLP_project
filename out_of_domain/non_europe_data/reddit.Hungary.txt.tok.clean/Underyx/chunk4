  the smarter ones tried everything they could come up with . 
  simulating the past with a computer ? 
  done , but no result . 
  lots of research into time-travel ? 
  done , but time seemed to be constant , they could n't move time , they failed on that too . 
  after all that , they started to realize , even they are n't that powerful . 
  but then who was ? 
  some of them thought `` there must be an even bigger god , controlling us , hiding somewhere !, 
  or even several of them ! '', 
  others said `` ha , this is stupid , gods do n't exist , as we proved it , we are n't gods either !, 
  there must be a scientific explanation for all this ! '', 
  so , determined to discover the truth , these scientist-types went ahead , and started building a hadron collider . 
  they thought colliding particles would create a so-called `` higgs boson '' , which was also present at the creation of their life . 
  it could have revealed * every * secret of the universe they were arguing about . 
  the debates going on for decades would have finally been settled , bringing them one step closer to peace among their kind . 
  fast forward 40 months , and they finished constructing it . 
  the moment of truth has come , at last . 
  the fate of everyone was at stake . 
  the leader of their group pushes the big red button , the whole thing lights up , particles enter the enormous tubes . 
  the scientists could hardly breathe from their excitement . 
  a few hours later , breaking the suspense , one of the inspectors shouts ` we have reached maximum speed , contact expected in the next few minutes ! ', 
  not long after that , the chief yells ` collision detected !, 
  collecting data ! ', 
  applause . 
  ... and ** bang !, 
  the particles ... the tubes ... the scientists ... the cities ... the world ... *** the whole universe vanished *** . 
  but in the next few moments , new life was born in the form of tiny amoebas . 
  gods , they were . 
  ... aaaand thank you , or4cle for this amazing story . 
  unfortunately for you , a little bit of googling instantly reveals [ where you copied all that from ] ( http://goo.gl/2xjb5 ) . 
  a quick look at comments shows i already commented this :p, 
  haha , never mind then , sorry if it 's not your fault . 
  ( not like it would be a large mistake even if you could see it ) :d, 
  did we scare you with all that `` hey , this was copied from another site ! '', 
  below ? 
   til from an ama that iama alien . 
  fml . 
  what . 
  `` today i learned from an ask me anything that i am an alien . 
  fuck my life '', 
  do n't worry , i can translate it , but , to be honest it makes no sense :p, 
  but probably that 's how you intended to write it . 
  this might be his original comment , in case anyone wants to see it :, 
   icann `` moderates '' the system , they are going to be who `` owns '' it if anyone does . 
  well , that 's a lie . 
  that 's sad . 
  edit : it 's been 4 hours and no one pointed out that the image is 1000 \u00d7 1000px large ? 
  looks like i wasted my time with that :(, 
  see ? 
  i told you !, 
  anyway , i do n't get it . 
  reddit collectively acts like a child all the time . 
  except when i say something . 
  all i get is `` jeez , grow up . 
  '' , `` seriously ? '', 
  and so on . 
  i think this theory is also supported by the last paragraph :, 
   ** i 'm an engineer ** not a biologist but this always bugged me . 
  that would have made me feel quite uneasy . 
  the hungarian tax office 's tax return software is completely written in java , and is used by millions of citizens :p, 
  instead of toy , package contained parasite . 
  would not accept gift again . 
  ** [ palatap ] **, 
  too bad self posts do n't give karma ^ . ^, 
  unlikely . 
  that would be 1.71 micrograms of sand . 
  i do n't think so . 
  that would be a sphere of sand with the radius of ** 6.64 \u00d7 10 ^ 192 km ** . 
  ( that is 7.5 \u00d7 10 ^ 168 times the size of the observable universe . ), 
  what a shitty comment . 
  i heard that as ` morning, 
  can i have a cs : s guest pass to the steam id underyx ? 
  thanks !, 
  for person in surroundings :, 
  bite ( person ), 
  quite simpler that the c++ one up there :p, 
  you mean the ` xd ' smiley , right ? 
   please do n't : [ ... ] complain about a story being old . 
  reddit is about interesting stuff , not new stuff only . 
  just hide the story . 
  then downvote it . 
  if other people agree with you , this will also downvote , and the submission will be buried under all the others . 
  for me :, 
  middle click : thanks !, 
  scroll up : yes !, 
  scroll down : no !, 
  mouse4 : weapon slot 2, 
  mouse5 : weapon slot 3, 
  well , i 'm sorry . 
  seems a bit paradoxy though , `` reddit is about voicing opinions '' but still , the reddiquette lists thing you should n't say . 
  158 seems like quite a lot of recipe photographs to me :p, 
  for the good of all of us , except the ones who are wikileaks . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  makes sense . 
  luckily the world 's on peaceful . 
  that 's one thing i wanted to write . 
  i could break into any house without consequences . 
  i could sit in the prime minister 's chair , read through his documents , et cetera . 
   every single living being disappeared, 
  i thought about the plane one too :d,
