  common mistake , what with the anonimity on the internet and everything , do n't worry about it , 
  erm , i do n't actually work at valve , that was just a smirk remark playing on your assumption that business decisions are generally not rational enough to be easily derived from actions we see a certain company take . 
  i 'm very curious as to why i deserved +12 from you , though . 
  you stay out of this , bot !, 
  oh , alrighty , that 's actually really nice then . 
  here 's to your newly received [ +2 ] , i guess !, 
  hey , mind reposting this in like 5 minutes once i 've created the new weekly thread ? 
  thanks !, 
  what 's 5s , then ? 
  how does that compare to captaining a dota team ? 
  welp , that really does sound complicated . 
  right , i 've been meaning to ask how much of the money you 're supposed to receive gets cut off cause of that specified maximum . 
  i think i set mine to 4 videos/month ? 
   maybe i 'm just too oc, 
  do n't call it that . 
  also , that means the new area of effect is 225 % of the old one , which is an even larger difference . 
  i know , right ? 
  and tidebringer . 
  and grow . 
  why would you assume he 's a teacher ? 
  yeah , i know . 
  ^ ^ \\* sigh \\*, 
  probably because , as you just mentioned , it 's posted all the time ? 
  just a wild guess . 
   penalising heroes for using their skills is a bad idea, 
  that 's not true at all . 
  there 's tons of skills that introduce a risk for their reward . 
  jeez , we all know that . 
  his reasoning was faulty and i pointed that out . 
  nobody here is on the other side of the issue . 
  what he meant was stupid . 
  what he was reasoning for was n't . 
  even though i am siding with democrats , i try and distance myself from people who go ` republicans kill children so i hate them ! ' . 
  as a matter of fact i feel an urge to try and correct them , as i did in this thread . 
   now three of four optical mice he tried have this problem, 
  they 're not a consumer product yet . 
  anyone paying $ 1500 is supposed to be paying for the privilege of being able to prepare for the public launch with own products . 
  they work alright . 
  ah , i see , thanks a lot for your help !, 
   beat the bta, 
  nice try .

  looking at the hungarian postal service 's rates , it would cost around $ 60 to send to the usa . 
  are you sure you 'd be willing to pay that much ? 
  if so , i might find the time to help you out with this . 
  no promises , but i reckon i 'd find this rather fun . 
  here 's a summary of what my day consisted of so far :, 
  watch ` basically , i played invoker ' . 
  watch [ all 6 long story short videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/badlucktommy/videos ) . 
  watch [ all 52 bref videos ] ( http://vimeo.com/user12498112/videos ) i could find with english subtitles . 
  come back to see this came out . 
  needless to say , i 'm pretty happy . 
  also . 
  if anyone finds english subtitles for bref 53-82 , please let me know immediately . 
  i kinda sorta speak french , but do n't want to miss a joke on my first watch just cause i have trouble with the language :(, 
  and the other players on the server gave him $ 100 . 
  you 're welcome . 
  oh thank god . 
  yeah , steelseries rmas suck :(, 
  i 'm in hungary , and a quick google search suggests that dsr is not the least bit applicable here . 
  thanks for trying to help , anyways !, 
  well , i specified that as steelseries rmas since i do n't have any experience with rmas at other manufacturers . 
  i 've only heard tales of amazon ( with their kindle ) and logitech for instance , who apparently send a replacement without even requiring proof in most cases . 
  alright , i 'll try , thanks for the advice . 
   the slight changes he 's now made . 
  ... so you 're saying it 's not a direct rip off now ? 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  when did the cinematography in jontron vids get this amazing ? 
  oooh look , i 'm famous !, 
  revenge for depositing him ? 
  we consulted the almighty helix around 10 times in a row before dealing the killing blow . 
  way . 
  this is a stickied thread since at the time of the creation of these threads , invite sharing posts just flooded the subreddit . 
  stickying it helped with visibility -- but even like this there were a whole bunch of people creating new invite threads . 
  expect this to change soon , i 'm planning to revamp the subreddit 's meta soon , when i get the time . 
  and the guy who killed abby was from seattle . 
  wikipedia puts ` rel = nofollow ` on its user-created links , which makes it so that linking to your twitter profile on your userpage will not affect your twitter profile 's google ranking at all . 
  joke 's on you , mister , i did n't even click that link !, 
  ha , sure gotcha !, 
  chess ?

  i do n't see how chess is any less a sport than hearthstone . 
  oh , right , singer was female :d, 
  clarified a bit in op . 
  the song was faster paced than this , and had a more upbeat tone , i guess ? 
  the words i sang were merely ` some random words ' , as kind of a place holder as i did n't catch any of the lyrics when i heard the song . 
  i 'm 80 % sure that the singer was blonde , but i was looking at the screen which had this on from a pretty awkward angle , which might 've shifted the colors around a bit . 
  not this one , but i could imagine it being a lady gaga song . 
  it was perhaps a bit more emotional than the one you linked . 
  and is there a way to do this without having a what.cd account ? 
  alright , cool , thanks !, 
  [ goldfish !,

  i am not entirely sure -- i was looking at the screen playing the video from a really steep angle and that might have distorted the colors i was seeing .
