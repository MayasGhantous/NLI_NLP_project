  the song is n't that one , though . 
  i think it was only the singer by herself doing the ooh ooh part . 
  nope . 
  the song was more ... pop-ish , and ... elecronicish ? 
  i never knew they already ported dota 2 to ps4/xbox one : /, 
  well , you learn something every day . 
  i know . 
  i propose that this submission be removed and the two questions be reposted in separate submissions . 
  [ here 's one i wrote a while ago . 
  ] ( https://gist.github.com/underyx/dbb95bae7d9bb14a6307#file-fbmessages ), 
  you 'll need to update it with your own data to spoof an actual browser request , update all appropriate values with whatever you get in chome 's dev tools when requesting fb messages . 
  i 'm in a hurry now but i might write a detailed guide to this later if there 's demand . 
  heck , i might as well just rewrite the whole thing cause this code is utter crap . 
  i 'm rather sure we are n't favored 95 % of the time :d, 
  nintendo shares are finally going to go up in value after this . 
  wow , are n't you a badass . 
  or , you know , maybe you could buy it . 
  that 's what he 's saying . 
  abilities are zero-indexed . 
  reddit not being a meanie . 
  ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ rhyme 's ^ ^ ^ sake, 
  there 's pros actually self-casting linken 's ? 
  that sounds pretty stupid to me :, 
  you lose the ability to use it on a teammate for the coming 17 seconds , which might save them/the whole team/whatever . 
  the enemy will know with 100 % certainty that you 're being protected by linken 's . 
  these are too pretty obvious disadvantages , i do n't see why anyone would self-cast it just cause it looks cool . 
  he 's eighteen , if i recall correctly , and as he mentioned on the stream he 's having trouble finding a job . 
  which is not surprising considering his age . 
  i do n't know the whole story but any 18 year old who 's paying rent is obviously gon na have trouble . 
  also , he was making kind of enough for a while with just this , but people keep cancelling their pledges , apparently . 
  this was 43 whole seconds after #steamdb - announce had it . 
  was n't there supposed to be a big race or something ? 
  lookety look , i can quote myself too !, 
   maybe if you actually focused more on trying to contribute than winning some stupid race that no one but you cares about , probably you would n't be late . 
  no offense , but what 's the logic behind that ? 
  \\  implying it would be really that hard to confirm my identity . 
   how would the game be affected if roshan dropped cheese normally and aegis on the third kill ? 
  is the gist of it . 
  yeah , that 's not him . 
  this is a 1.5 years old repost , as a matter of fact . 
  i am a beautiful person who is the most important thing is that the plane was hijacked and i love you and your family and friends of the best of luck to you by the way to get the best of luck to you by the way to get the best of luck to you, 
  dude , you 're gon na win your own contest . 
  is that the movie 's start time or just a pre-show 's start , though ? 
  do they have anything like smartplay from beyondpod in this new update ? 
  after hearing reddit rave over pocket casts all that time i was really hyped to switch to it a few weeks ago . 
  but then i was just so perplexed at the lack of such a great feature that i kept using pocket casts for days before finally admitting to myself that i just ca n't keep using it like that . 
  edit : oh , also , per-podcast default speed settings in yet ? 
  you overestimate the amount of planning going on at valve by a lot . 
  not to the extent that they 'd put a content freeze on it , no . 
  right , we did n't quite decide on any set rules on that , i think we 're going to allow it . 
  [ exhibit a ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/1rggup/the_way_pauses_currently_work_is_heavily/ ), 
  same post on / r/truedota2 [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truedota2/comments/1rglph/the_way_pauses_currently_work_is_heavily/ ) . 
  they are not server headers , these are kind of like just some settings on the computer the bot is running on . 
  there 's nothing really dangerous in them , either . 
  import os, 
  [ yeah , this could lead to something though . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/212zxo/which_is_your_favourite_reddit_bot_and_how_can_it/cg9dm9z ), 
  never mind , just checked and the bot runs the code through ideone.com , not on its own server , so there 's not really anything to do here . 
  i was hoping that the bot 's creator was n't cautious enough , but surely everything ideone runs is properly sandboxed and all that jazz . 
  ~ ~ indent your code by 4 spaces to make reddit actually recognize it as code . ~ ~ oh you fixed this , cool . 
  that directory will most likely not exist , the program runs from / home / [ random string ] , so, 
  is / home / [ id ], 
  * . . is / home /, 
  * . . / . . / . . should n't exist, 
  import os, 
  for filename in os.listdir ( ' / tmp ' ) :, 
  try :, 
  print open ( ' / tmp / ' + filename ) . read ( ), 
  except ioerror :, 
  pass, 
  in one of my circles of friends getting worked up over ~ ~ ambient ~ ~ background noise coming through voice activated voice chat is what constitutes a douche . 
  i do n't think of voice chat much differently than real life conversation . 
  and i sure as hell can talk to my friends just alright when one 's using a bong . 
  as a matter of fact , i do n't really require my friends to sit in perfect quiet either while listening to someone else talk . 
  yeah , but fuck me for not being as irritated by that , amirite ? 
  note how i said ` one of my circles of friends ' . 
  in another , we use push to talk . 
  i still would n't mind if they were noisy , but i respect their preference . 
  in another we prefer voice activation since when out of game , you do n't need to keep your hands on your keyboard , and ingame you just do n't have to deal with plus one button ( which by the way often falls victim to keyboard ghosting for me . ), 
  but yeah that 's an absolutely alright reason for downvoting . 
  today 's just disappointment after disappointment . 
  why are we assuming that facebook 's replacing leadership of the oculus team ? 
  not only does that make very little sense in the case of oculus , but facebook does n't normally do that with acquired companies anyway . 
   you have a big heart, 
  d'aww :d, 
   the english helps you communicate with others and especially when you co-created thecookiefactory.org with marton bognar . 
  that 's the only false assumption here , thecookiefactory is a project with an all-hungarian team . 
  the oculus rift and google glass could hardly be more different . 
  they work differently , they have an * entirely * different purpose , and are in no way two competing products . 
  not even to the point where you could say it 's like a phone versus a computer . 
   i do n't speak hungarian, 
  how dare you !, 
  seriously though , i would n't really expect you to get all that , good job , bro :d, 
  i do n't think how anyone could think virtual reality social networking is a good idea . 
  facebook does a lot more than just social networks , and oculus would n't have sold to a company that does n't support their vision anyway . 
  yes . 
  glass is not virtual reality . 
  that 's not hardware limitation , but a conscious design decision . 
  why would n't you if they were already profitable ? 
  why would n't you if you 're as large a supporter of technology as facebook .
