  i believe this is the very definition of quick escalation . 
  anyhow , can you email bence@underyx.me with a quick summary of the project ? 
  i ca n't really promise anything just yet as i work full time and also on some smaller freelance projects in my free time ; i 'd have to know the scope of the project before i could say anything specific . 
  do you mean the consumer cost ? 
  cause they are about the same for both products . 
  in case you mean development cost though , i really do n't think google would have had any problems getting into vr if they wanted , either . 
  the main reason they settled with glass is that they 're not really looking for higher product adoption , but rather higher product usage time . 
  glass is an all-purpose device you can wear all day , while the rift is something you only use for very specific things , that take up only a small part of your day . 
  would you mind explaining that a bit ? 
  checking the rift the current dev kit costs $ 350 . 
  and google glass will cost around $ 500 for consumers , that seems pretty close to me . 
  hey , why not ? 
  i 've been promising a big subreddit overhaul here for a while now ( mostly in the rules dept. 
  ) , but i just keep having so much to do irl :(, 
  sorry guys i 'm neglecting y' all , but stay tuned for , uh , some stuff , um , soonish . 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  i 'm planning to hold a vote in this subreddit about a bunch of things , this will be one of them now . 
  though i do n't really see how this would gain a majority of nays . 
  hey , thanks for that !, 
  keep a lookout for when i 'll put this up ... in a day or two . 
  ^ ^ so ^ ^ which ^ ^ one ^ ^ of ^ ^ you ^ ^ guys ^ ^ is ^ ^ gon na ^ ^ handle ^ ^ this ^ ^ one ? 
  huh ? 
  why 's that ? 
  though as i mentioned , i was planning on allowing democracy to sort this out . 
  lol, 
  fear of rocks . 
  [ this looks so weird . 
  now that 's some quality discussion of the case [ . 
  or you can use a backslash and then it looks like a normal message , too . 
  \\  well played !, 
  you mean poor men dagon . 
  if you 're using windows .

  only tangentially relevant , but this conference i went to last year had a few [ cool blog posts with a few posts on staying in hungary as a foreigner ] ( http://blog.rupy.eu/ ) . 
  might wan na check that out . 
  you also might want to save the number/address of [ these guys ] ( http://www.singapore.hu/english.html ) , just in case things go really awry . 
  ( the site mostly talks about how they help hungarian people with singapore related stuff , but surely it works the other way around , too , right ? ), 
  found one of the discrepancies :, 
  edit : the other one is 229 to 231 . 
  i 'll go submit an edit request . 
  edit 2 : bam , you can monitor the request 's status [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk:list_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_world#editsemiprotected ) . 
  huh , true . 
  i 've added that to my edit request . 
  i do n't think i could find reliable sources stating stuff like ` this is the 244th highest building in the world ! ', 
  for hundreds of buildings . 
  the building 's articles should have citations for the height of the buildings though , and i think we can safely assume that we can construct an accurate ranking list based on that data . 
  more accurate at least than there is currently . 
  ~ ~ [ mirror ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcrvcwyohig ) for when this gets noticed and deleted . ~ ~, 
  welp , time to delete my upload . 
  and you 're the sad one after all this ? 
  guys , [ go here ] ( http://www.patreon.com/edje ) and give the guy money , he deserves it : c, 
  which he does n't get since it 's a self post . 
  i 'm with you , dude . 
  it 's crazy how all these people are ridiculing you only cause they do n't understand how deep ui design actually goes . 
  as if all that mattered was that you cover as little of the game viewport as possible . 
  i mean , it 's only two pixels hiiiiigh , how could two pixels hurt amirite guise haha rofl this guy thinks it 's clutter but lol he stupid it 's just two pixels . 
   anybody hosting / previously hosted a pubstomp ? 
  got any tips/notes on how to ask reddit for tips/notes ? 
  poor / u/icastcats came up with a pretty bad analogy . 
  it 's actually like saying headphones are now social media , cause you can listen to the videos your friends are posting . 
   i think i will be flamed for this video, 
  right on bro , the kerning on all your text is unsettlingly bad . 
  why would that have been a problem ? 
   making it un-giftable would solve the problem a little . 
  what problem ? 
  you explained how he ca n't exchange it for money now , but you did n't tell me what the problem would 've been , which was my original question . 
  i do n't , and you do n't seem to be doing anything to explain what problem you see with this is . 
  the guy saved valve tons of money by helping them maintain the ingame economy , it 's only natural that he gets rewarded . 
  other tech companies ( google , facebook , and tons of others ) pay thousands of dollars in cash as bounties for similar bugs . 
   do you know economics ? 
  some , basing most of my assumptions on common sense , past experience , and the little bit of economics i learned in my spare time . 
   do you know how much that item would be worth ? 
  probably around as much as other one of a kind items . 
  their prices are really volatile though , and not as inflated as one might assume purely cause of the risks involved in investing in one of these . 
   if it got duped by someone , it would completely ruin the value of the item in the first place . 
  we can safely assume that this item will not be duped . 
  even in the unlikely case that someone found a way to dupe it , valve would manually fix it . 
   anyone who tries to sell the one-of-a-kind item they have that they were given for their noble deeds is a dick, 
  noble deeds ? 
  come on . 
  i already mentioned how it is customary for corporations to hand out monetary rewards for such critical bug reports . 
  the white hat hacker does some work , and get compensated for his time spent , what 's wrong with that ? 
  actually , you 'd be able to afford 103 rapiers and 32 branches to top it off . 
  edit : i was basing my calculations on the number of pixels on the image . 
  if we 're using the pixels rendered on the image instead , that leaves us with only 77 rapiers . 
  aww < 3, 
   i was saying that the problem is that when someone has the ability to trade it , they will get harassed and get offers to buy it all the time . 
  you were n't saying that at all , i assume you just do n't want to admit i proved all your previous points wrong . 
  not that this one is any better an argument . 
  okay , if you really want to stand by that argument , sure :, 
  ** pros : ** you get something worth thousands of dollars . 
  ** cons : ** you get a bunch of messages from random people . 
  are you seriously suggesting that this is n't a tradeoff anyone would happily go for ? 
  you have the ability to block communications from randoms right at your fingertips . 
  it takes mere seconds to do that . 
  okay fiiiine , it 's been long enough , i 'll tell you . 
  * the guy is the leader of an opposition party . 
  * this opposition party announces they 'll be holding an opposition party ^ ^ ( ha-ha ) on election day on that square .
