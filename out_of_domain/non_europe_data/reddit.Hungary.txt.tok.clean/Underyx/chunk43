  vehicle identification number numbers ? 
  however , not all viewers are guaranteed to have seen the music video or even to have known the song itself , and in either of those cases , they would not get the reference . 
  that 's where i first saw the video :3, 
  okay , but that means you also have tons of players who are n't counted as uniques if they 're using the shared steam accounts . 
  look at this thread . 
  count the number of people confused by it . 
  let me know if you have any more questions . 
  why ? 
   facebook is more of a stalker ex-girlfriend . 
  you 've broken up with her long ago , but she keeps popping up everywhere you go and asking people about you . 
  has everyone here really deleted their facebook accounts ? 
  also , this analogy is n't quite fair , as there 's a huge difference between a person and a company . 
  i fail to see the problem with facebook collecting data about me when they use it for my advantage . 
  me too . 
  it 's streets ahead of facebook or any similar social network in terms of feature set and both ux and graphic design . 
  also , i do n't understand how people can get so mad over having to sign up for google + to use youtube and the like . 
  that 's not even anything out of ordinary . 
  these , though ... 
  do you have a gun at home ? 
  \\  yes , i do . 
  \\  piglet shoots balloon too, 
  \\  winnie wo n't move for like 10 seconds, 
  \\  dead silence, 
  \\  what the fuck, 
   fulfilling the prophetic hashtag prophecy, 
  the ` prophetic prophecy ' ? 
  is the huffington post running out of words to use ? 
  what the fuck , man . 
  do you really think physical aggression is the best way to help someone with mental illness ? 
  or could you simply just hurt someone for their because ` their disability is kind of annoying ' ? 
  my vote goes for [ sleepbot ] ( http://mysleepbot.com ), 
  look , pretty graph !, 
  also , here 's a report card : https://www.mysleepbot.com/share/stats/3-1-12/12-1-13/4dcb304n46d7f9103n4edec15df05n4f7cf55d602, 
  big news coming in a week or so :p, 
  does n't beat the body i have on http://mici.hu, 
  i do n't see what the big deal is about this . 
  we already had custom buildings on the seasonal maps . 
  european , 19 , and just about to finish 13th grade in high school , yup . 
  europe has tons of different countries , each with their own system for education . 
  13 is not mandatory in the country i live in , either ( choice of 12 or 13 . ), 
  it 's not the 13th grade of high school per se ; it 's my 13th grade , and it is in high school -- high schools start counting from nine , as that 's where elementary school left off typically . 
  can also be broken into 6 and 6 , or 4 and 8 years of elementary and high school , respectively . 
   this item is not available in your country . 
  it 's not in hungary . 
  [ well .

  and here 's a link to pok\u00e9mon crystal 's source code :, 
  spoiler : it can . 
  how are we supposed to trust an app to do cleaning right if the developers fail to understand how android works this horribly ? 
  well , you can reroll your heroes with them . 
  well , buy the domain :d, 
  yeah , are n't fake ads the worst !, 
  haaahahahaha . 
  [ same thing happened to me :d ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/1u46ek/most_interestingfunny_spell_steals_with_rubick/ceem8vo ), 
  i have yet to see a standin swap out another player mid-game . 
  there 's not even any correlation . 
  are you suggesting that the causality is reversed and companies become hated because they sell well ? 
  that specific correlation is pretty insignificant , and does n't hold true consistently . 
  look at valve for instance . 
   get off ts/skype/jabber / jibber/yahoo messenger ! / icq for a few minutes, 
  mumble master race is exempt , cool !, 
  gee , that 's actually kinda close . 
  i ended up listening to 10 of their songs , but nope . 
  seconding beyondpod . 
  while some people prefer the ui of pocket casts , it falls short when it comes to features . 
  yes . 
  d'aww , i 'm really glad y' all like it :3, 
  you kidding me ? 
  why the hell would it be a problem ? 
  you two are more than welcome to come :d, 
  i 'm also part of the milla network , but thanks for the help :3, 
  the code is actually on [ github ] ( https://github.com/arcana/pubstomp.hu ) , the site is open source !, 
  well , actually , i did n't use any cms , i made the whole site myself , it 's written in python , using flask , and hosted on heroku . 
  [ it 's open source , too !, 
  make sure to send them the link so they can all vote , it makes planning easier if we have all those stats in one place :d, 
  see you there !, 
  oh right , there was this guy doing some stuff , too . 
  the site displays in everyone 's browser 's default language -- as long as it 's either english or hungarian :d, 
  anyhow , you can have a look at the hungarian version here : http://pubstomp.hu/hu, 
  a pubstomp is basically an event where people gather at an irl location to watch a tournament together . 
  yeah , i 've been starting to think about that , thanks , i 'll do that within the next few days . 
  i 'll get right on that , thanks . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\* embarrassed ^ ^ ^ face \\*, 
  it 's really a shame there 's no way to change that , right ? 
  oh god what did i start by sending you that phrasebook-blogpost : l, 
  edit : here , guys , [ this is his secret weapon ] ( http://blog.rupy.eu/post/63089138612/hungarian-crash-course ) !, 
  he found a tf2 item duplication bug like 2 years ago , reported it to valve straight away , and got vac banned for it . 
  the ban was later degraded to trade probation which he still has , to this day . 
  you should n't be crying ` ad hominem ' without giving it some thought , it 's almost as if you think ad hominem is kind of a default win condition where your opponent is automatically disqualified . 
  it 's not . 
  that 's just some general advice by the way , and is not really applicable to this certain thread . 
  here , the entire point people are trying to make , that people are trying to sorta argue for is that you 're a crappy person .
