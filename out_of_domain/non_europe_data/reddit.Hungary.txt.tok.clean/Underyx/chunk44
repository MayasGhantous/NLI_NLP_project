  now , how would you prove that about someone without making any references to their personality ? 
  that 's clearly impossible . 
  ` tis all fun and games until you have to maintain that code . 
  you made the following statement , paraphrased :, 
   reports are not reviewed . 
  responses to this were :, 
   yeah , you seem really pleasant . 
  ca n't imagine how you got muted, 
  and, 
   now i realize you 're probably like 13 . 
  do you really think either of these comments are trying to argue about the mute system ? 
  they are n't even indirectly implying that ` you are a bad person so valve reviews reports ' . 
  that 's a completely ridiculous statement that no one would make . 
  the two comments i quoted above are both only making general remarks about your personality . 
  that 's pretty much the atmosphere it had , but nope :(, 
  i think my song was pretty recent . 
  well here 's your chance to come anyway and expand your horizons !, 
  why would 1.100 be the same as 1.1 ? 
  there 's clearly a two character difference . 
  poor form ? 
  confusing ? 
  it makes way more sense than arbitrarily jumping a major version , case in point right here . 
  the developer had to explain the versioning in the first line of his post to dispel confusion about this increment in a major version . 
  those ` some developers ' you speak of do it because actually having semantic value to a version number makes way more sense than just randomly jumping versions after a certain amount of time has passed . 
  and please tell me where i can find a computer that interprets the integer 100 as 1 . 
  ( and one that interprets all integers up to 99 correctly , mind you . ), 
  but if you actually use any of those , then [ wat ] ( https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat ) . 
  oh , right , so that 's why / u/majornoodles was confused . 
  understandable , i guess , though i really do n't know what he could make of version numbers such as 1.100.1 then . 
  the atraci website says that there 's no ads displayed . 
  how is this legal then ? 
  the website says there 's no ads displayed . 
  how is this legal then ? 
  oh , right , gotcha . 
  obligatory us only grumble grumble . 
  * the moooooooooooon ~ ~ *, 
  ^ ^ ... actually , & nbsp ; it 's & nbsp ; hungary . 
  nuh-uh , but a few hours ago i found it !, 
  check edit in op :3, 
   fifa do n't pay anyone to advertise the world cup . 
  [ according to the 2013 fifa financial report ] ( http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/02/30/12/07/fifafr2013en_neutral.pdf ) , they plan to spend $ 52 million on advertising for the 2018 world cup . 
  how is no one else commenting on the camera spazzing out while tide is dying ? 
  am i the only one seeing it ? 
  ah , that makes sense , thanks :d, 
  that 's correct grammar . 
  what are the best quantified self apps on android ? 
  i 'm interested in all sorts of stat tracking , but especially nutrition tracking right now . 
  you can still buy it at nearly the sale price on trading sites , this guy for instance is selling it for around $ 12 worth of tf2 keys : http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/20785451, 
  ooh , ooh , and i forgot to mention , [ you can buy keys from the community market ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/mann%20co.%20supply%20crate%20key ) for cheaper-than-steam-store price !, 
  riight , valve sells them themselves -- that 's where each key originally comes from . 
  here 's a shameless little note that i wan na be on there too :3, 
  hey there , mind if we get back to this tomorrow ? 
  we 'll have a nice little internal discussion on how exactly to go about this and stuff . 
  ( not that it 's a big deal , really , but still , it 's better if we all agree on something . ), 
  same with me , we even made a nice little website for our event ( http://pubstomp.hu ) but it did n't get approved . _ . 
  i made http://pubstomp.hu and we have a cinema with 500 capacity to hold the pubstomp in , but our event did n't get approved . 
  so , if i may :, 
  no event hungary, 
  how is this easy to implement ? 
  what , you want every single line in item descriptions to link to a search on in the market ? 
  that obviously would be a horrible idea . 
  the code for one of these descriptions looks something like this :, 
  < div class = `` descriptor ''  a portion of the proceeds from the key used to unlock this will help support cs : go professional tournament prize pools . < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 153 , 204 , 255 ) ; ''  container series # 19 < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor ''  contains one of the following : < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 75 , 105 , 255 ) ; ''  ssg 08 | dark water < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 75 , 105 , 255 ) ; ''  mac-10 | ultraviolet < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 75 , 105 , 255 ) ; ''  usp-s | blood tiger < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 136 , 71 , 255 ) ; ''  pp-bizon | blue streak < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 136 , 71 , 255 ) ; ''  p90 | virus < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 136 , 71 , 255 ) ; ''  mp7 | ocean foam < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 136 , 71 , 255 ) ; ''  desert eagle | crimson web < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 211 , 44 , 230 ) ; ''  aug | bengal tiger < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 211 , 44 , 230 ) ; ''  nova | bloomstick < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 235 , 75 , 75 ) ; ''  m4a4 | bullet rain < / div , 
  < div class = `` descriptor '' style = `` color : rgb ( 255 , 215 , 0 ) ; ''  or an exceedingly rare special item ! < / div , 
  how would you go about parsing that and reliably determining which lines refer to items and which do n't ? 
  you did n't answer my question , ` how would you go about parsing that and reliably determining which lines refer to items and which do n't ? ', 
  that description is just a huge block of text with no semantic markup whatsoever . 
  or donate it to charity . 
  you guys know why i suck at coming up with jokes ? 
  ... i do n't either :(, 
  and what prevents an attacker from using the same hashed password to authenticate ? 
  that 's not a salted password . 
  also , even if instagram would take the time to implement authentication like that ( which would be rather non-standard for a mobile social networking app ) , the phone would first have to send the public key when signing up . 
  with the current user registration flow of instagram , i do n't think there 's any way to ensure that the public key originates from the correct device , so if the connection is over http , an attacker could intercept this transaction , replace the original public key it with their own , to then gain the same level of access as with a stolen password . 
  sending plaintext passwords is standard , since from a security perspective , it just does n't matter what the sent string is if sending the same string will allow you to authenticate you anyway . 
  if your password is 1234 , logging in with plaintext passwords would send data resembing :, 
  user : therealkidkudi, 
  password : 1234, 
  if i intercept that , that means i can send the following to authenticate :, 
  user : therealkidkudi, 
  password : 1234, 
  ... obviously . 
  now , if the password is hashed client side , the following happens : you enter 1234 in the password box , the browser does something like this :, 
  # password = = 1234, 
  password = md5 ( password ), 
  # password = = 81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055, 
  so then the authentication request is :, 
  user : therealkidkudi,
