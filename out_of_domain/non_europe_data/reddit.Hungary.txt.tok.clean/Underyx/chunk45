  ... but if i intercept that , there 's nothing stopping me from just sending this again :,

  and the server has no way of knowing if i calculated this from ' 1234 ' myself , with knowledge of the original password , or if i just stole the calculated hash . 
  great , i 'm glad we agree . 
  the method you described would indeed be a pretty good solution , though , if you had no way to use https , but had a way of checking the public key 's authenticity . 
  of course , the steps taken to ensure security with such an implementation are getting eerily close to tls , so in cases such as this i just see absolutely no reason to pursue this instead of just switching to https . 
  ( i 'm not implying that you would , just wanted to make this clear for anyone else reading . ), 
  and this is why you use https . 
   i 'm not a web programmer, 
  it shows . 
  encrypting a password like that is not what ssl means , and the answer was using tls anyhow , not ssl . 
  also , my entire comment 's purpose was to prove why such encryption is not sufficient , and why instagram needs to use tls . 
  this kind of encryption would be vulnerable to that so-called firesheep , too . 
  oh you do ? 
  great , we have nothing to worry about , then , mods , you can close this thread . 
  that 's exactly why i wrote my comment . 
  now we know that you , the average instagram user , is safe , so there 's no point arguing about all this security mizmazzle anymore . 
  hey , it 's fine , thanks for admitting your mistake without just deleting your comments , and sorry if i sounded condescending in my previous reply . 
  huh , i keep reading your words over and over again but i fail to see how you said anything that i did n't . 
  ~ ~ 10 % of the android userbase is nearly as much as all ios users , though . ~ ~, 
  edit : yep , that was stupid . 
  i was thinking all android devices vs. iphones , see my calculations below . 
  if anyone 's interested , android has ~ ~ 62.5 % ~ ~ 55.5 % the amount of devices on the latest version as there are iphones on the latest one . 
  yup . 
  [ kitkat currently has an install base of ~ 17.9 % of all devices . 
  ] [ 0 ] [ android had 1 billion active devices in use in the month leading up to google i/o ] [ 1 ] , this makes it 179 million devices on the latest version . 
  [ apple has around ~ ~ 80 % ~ ~ 89 % of their devices on the latest version of their os ] [ 2 ] , and [ an article estimates around 600 million active devices for q2 this year ] [ 3 ] ( apple does n't seem to be releasing data on amount of active devices . ), 
  this makes it ~ ~ 480 ~ ~ 540 million on the latest version , which means that ** android has only ~ ~ 37.5 % ~ ~ 33.3 % of the devices on the latest version that ios does ** .

  thanks , edited !, 
  lol you said shit cock balls, 
  lol, 
  this is not true either . 
  truecrypt is not known to be compromised at all . 
  who 's to say if it was supposed to be altered or not ? 
  it became a different social experiment , but that does n't mean it became a worse social experiment . 
  are we seriously arguing about this ? 
  people will call it whatever they see it as . 
  you are free to call it whatever you want , and everyone else is free to call it a game if they feel it is similar enough to other games . 
  you are not superior in any way for noticing a difference between two things and then bitching about it to whomever does n't consider that difference big enough to warrant a new word/phrase for the thing in question . 
  and why would dictionaries matter , all of you ? 
  people 's usage of the word causes a definition to be put in a dictionary , not the other way around . 
  i liked it more with democracy . 
  the analyst panel 's discussions are not in the ingame replays . 
  you 're doing it wrong :, 
  git commit - m ` reduce legal liability immediately to secure $ $ $ ', 
  edit : for reference , parent comment said ` git commit - m ` v0 .0.1 reduce legal liability immediately to secure $ $ $ ' `, 
  & gt ; so what kind of music do you listen to ? 
  & gt ; personally , i think their selection has been great . 
  wow , that wedding really was beautiful . 
  edit : wow , these doodles really are neat . 
  hey , are you willing to work for commission ? 
  i got nothing in particular right now , but would be pretty happy to incorporate your doodling and type in some websites ' designs when i next am in a position to . 
   i do n't know the implications of this , but to me it feels not quite right . 
  so much fud it hurts . 
   please do not email me . 
  okay i think i 'll manage . 
  sure , there 's nothing wrong with asking questions . 
  what 's not fine is asking a question and giving your post the shittiest clickbait title of all time . 
  this is basically equivalent to ' ** click here to find out what dirty trick facebook uses to breach your privacy !, 
  ** ' and then going ` yeah i saw this thing it might be important . ', 
  the problem is not even that you supposedly suck at giving things titles . 
  the problem is that you saw something that you knew nothing about and instantly rushed here intending to incite a witchhunt not questioning even for a second that your assumption might be wrong . 
  then you are forbidden from playing least played or else your zephyr items will be taken away . 
  what 's wrong with doing experiments ? 
  yes , that 's what i was asking , what 's ethically wrong with doing experiments like this ? 
  i would be way more disappointed with someone if they had access to as much data as facebook and did n't use it to further our understanding of human psychology . 
   but twitch is fucking stupid , so they 'll be muted, 
  they are muted due to copyright laws , not the stupidity of twitch . 
  okay . 
  what are you trying to say here ? 
  i do n't see how that invalidates my point :, 
   they are muted due to copyright laws , not the stupidity of twitch . 
  the stream had copyrighted music playing on it , therefore it got muted . 
  even if it has false positives too sometimes . 
  they invest ... their cash ... that they keep on hand ? 
  there 's no way they 'd just move off of their infrastructure that they spent all this time custom-building for themselves . 
  s3 's main selling point is not more effective operation , but easier setup and operation . 
  if twitch is already fine with what they have , there 's no reason to change everything . 
  well you kinda need a hand to wear a watch though , no ? 
  thanks , how do i edit the title ? 
  thank you , i tried my best !, 
  yes , a lot of people put a great deal of effort into writing these articles . 
  the new york times is a nationwide paper , though , anyone from the us could help . 
  actually , some vendors in europe sell it as well , i just have n't found any here in hungary . 
  well complain to nyt , they are the ones calling the document ` scan.pdf ' . 
  turnsitaround, 
  it would be hungary , so yeah , not as close culturally/otherwise to the us . 
  not sure yet . 
  would prefer amazon , but could do motorola online store to a shipito.com us address . 
  i have , but only for a fairly worthless 15 usd item . 
  do you see any obvious inefficiencies or issues with amazon 's current return processing pipeline ? 
  what would you change if you had the power to ? 
  how are we ever going to see innovation then ? 
  this is like saying ` come on , ford made that car thing and now these guys are making cars , too ?
