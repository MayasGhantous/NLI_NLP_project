  why is n't the current one enough ? ', 
  just imagine certain streets are only accessible with a specific car . 
  also they all give out cars for free . 
  and you get anything new ford comes up with in your already bought car . 
  okay , it was a subpar analogy , but you get the point . 
  origin had more going for it than just free games . 
  some people actually prefer the client over steam . 
  and we ca n't judge yet if the wb client is going to be worse than those two , either . 
  ^ ^ ^ okay ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ ^ keep ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ whining ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ until ^ ^ ^ after ^ ^ ^ release , ^ ^ ^ hm ? 
  are you sure about that though ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'd use steam and its convenience features even if it did n't sell games . 
  heck , i 'm adding my non-steam games to the client even now . 
  sure , but then your comment should 've said :, 
   and the only reason i use steam is because they forced me to use it, 
  i just checked this on the play store and it says it has 1mil + downloads ? 
  wow , why the hell is this getting upvotes ? 
  how does anyone think this is a good idea ? 
  in a ransom situation , the culprit 's integrity about following through with their threaths is what determines the entire outcome . 
  the victim ca n't just leave the negotiation halfway through . 
  if they 're holding your daughter hostage until you give them a million dollars , you ca n't just not talk to them to get her back , that 'd defeat the entire purpose . 
  or to put it in pseudo-game theory terms , assuming that the blackmailer is completely anonymous : if you give them the item , you lose the item , they get the item and do n't lose anything ( a ddos attack against a home connection costs virtually nothing ) , and if you do n't act , you lose your connection and they still do n't lose anything . 
  there 's basically no incentive for the attacker to stop the attack , they 'd just wait until you add them again to pay up . 
  then of course , the attacker might stop if they see an absolute unwillingness to comply from the victim . 
  this is unrelated to having them on your friends list as that is only a one way block of communications and they 're going to be perfectly aware that the victim is able to contact them . 
  great . 
  the moment someone 's actually trying to extort items out of someone instead of just having fun with their power , that 's not going to work since it 's a blatantly flawed plan . 
  i 'd fake inability to comply ( ` steam guard wo n't let me trade ' ) or ask my isp for help . 
  awesome , you came up with a real solution !, 
  ( if the victim 's isp is leasing dynamic ips . ), 
   they 're not `` holding your daughter hostage '' , they 're saying `` give us your daughter or we 'll make your cable tv not work . '', 
  why would you give them your daughter voluntarily ? 
  i 'd say the value of a working internet connection can easily be higher than that of a dota 2 item . 
  while i might have been mutilating the application as you say , ad ridiculum from your end is n't much better either ; a virtual item is worth a lot less than your daughter . 
   except that the attack they 're conducting on you could be conducted on someone else . 
  the issue here might be that you overestimate the resources required to conduct such an attack . 
  it 'd be rather easy to dos hundreds of home connections at a time -- reaching the maximum reasonable technological capacity would place too much of a negotiation workload on the blackmailer , but that 's not even the largest problem . 
  i think the biggest bottleneck would be acquiring targets , as it 's not that easy to find steam accounts that have items worth extorting , and can be easily linked to an ip address . 
  that 's what such a business would probably have the most problems with , so it 's reasonable for the attacker to cherish every single opportunity and not stop the attack that costs virtually nothing . 
  also , as a sidenote , fuck this subreddit for downvoting a call for actual discussion of the issue and just going ` lol why so srs ' . 
  i 'm glad you decided to point out the flaws in my argument . 
  great , then the app is not meant for you , feel free to move on with your life !, 
  how is this even remotely similar to yo ? 
  cause it allows two humans to communicate with each other ? 
  why , why , oh why is this thing region locked ? 
  edit : texted the ceo as instructed in the video . 
  got a reply within 20 seconds ... wow . 
   you should be able to tonight . 
  we have an issue with international phone numbers at the moment . 
  sorry about that !, 
  no need to worry bro , see edit :d, 
   reminded me of patapon . 
  i wonder why . _ . 
  why would you save xp and gold for later ? 
  oh , right on . 
  never even occurred to me . 
  yes , cause this game mechanic change is so op . 
  it makes games so unfair when one of the teams uses the new game mechanics . 
  thanks for this comment . 
  heh , [ this again . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl0zb_mopo8 ), 
  well , i guess they all must have those devices then !, 
  why do you need the new version ? 
  my plan was actually to buy the replay and then sell it for ten dollars via dotabank to everyone who wants.to see it . 
  ^ just ^ kidding , ^ of ^ course, 
  in case you already sent it , we have n't received anything . 
  can you check the address you punched in , perhaps ? 
  if you really do , please send it to us at team@dotabank.com, 
  i 'd like to go with this explanation . 
  on a more serious note , i 'll try and get this sorted out as soon as i get home today . 
  am i right in assuming that your first guess as to where it was had been the huge r/androidwear text up there ? 
  woop , woop !, 
  [ thank / u/jonfee ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/androidwear/comments/2j1t4f/this_annoys_me/cl8607t ) , i 'm using his image :3, 
  beyondpod , if you want more features than pocket casts and are fine with the ui being less shiny . 
  ( not that there 's anything wrong the beyondpod ui , especially with the new beta redesign . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure you need [ nomie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvzrp4lnd2m ) . 
  right , forgot this :, 
  linkme : beyondpod, 
  edit : dammit , two seconds late . 
  we get it , you 're cool cause you use irc . 
  well , this one is really easy to google , so i really do n't think you 're contributing anything useful to the discussion . 
  i wonder how to solve that . 
  too late now , but found this [ higher resolution version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/onkkzr1.jpg ) as well . 
  i keep wanting to know the time while on my morning commute , listening to podcasts , standing on the train . 
  i thought being able to press my headset buttons to have the phone tell me the time through the headset would be a pretty fun and convenient solution . 
  any app that can do that ? 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  sadly , three bucks is three too much for me to spend on a gingerbread themed app , so i 'm going to keep looking . 
  but really , thanks , regardless !, 
  in part , it 's cause of the principle of refusing to support developers who contribute to android 's fragmentation by following that design language . 
  but since the developer could n't be bothered to update the app 's design elements since 2.3 , it is unlikely that they will ever make improvements in their app , or even fix it if a new version of android breaks compatibility . 
  actually , [ nomie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvzrp4lnd2m ) is what you need . 
  where 's the z-axis though ? 
  you do realize other people have different habits though , right ? 
  exactly . 
  go buy a ticket to some random new movie at the cinema and you already paid more for that crap than this masterfully crafted game . 
  go start the game up again and try to contemplate how much work went into any given minute of your playtime . 
  now compare that to something like angry birds , which is for the most part just some dragging and dropping of blocks in a level editor , or even something like assassin 's creed pirates where someone painted a bunch of sea under you and you 're spending your time sailing through it to a floating icon . 
  no issues for 4 months now . 
  eve still up for grabs ? 
  if so , [ clicky here ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=36489577&amp;token=ddsndy0t ) and take my key , hm ?
