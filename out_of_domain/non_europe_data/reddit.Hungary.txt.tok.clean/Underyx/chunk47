  right , right , yeah , i meant that by, 
   i can hardly wait till eve drops to 2 bucks again, 
  i 'm an impatient man :(, 
  what do you think the slash translates to ? 
  ` and ' ? 
  even if it 's the latter , you 're saying ` oneplus or cyanogen just screwed indian users ' where the inclusion of oneplus is completely unnecessary . 
  you might as well blame ` oneplus/cyanogen/samsung / apple/google/kfc ' then . 
  i 'm not ` going off topic ' for the slash , i 'm going off topic because you had no understanding of the situation and still posted this article with an editorialized title that hurts the reputation of oneplus for no apparent reason . 
  and you can stop calling out people for posting off topic comments , anyway , you do n't get to be a moderator just because you submitted the link . 
  the community moderates itself via votes . 
  i reported it with the reason ` misleading/editorialized title ' , see [ discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/2nnujg/onepluscyanogen_inc_just_screwed_indian_users/cmf8qu8?context=1 ) -- that might 've had something to do with it . 
  what do you mean move past it ? 
  someone asked what happened to the old thread , and i answered . 
  the fuck is wrong with that ? 
  ( asking the downvoters , mostly . ), 
  welp . 
  excuse me , but i just do n't see the parallel here . 
  mind elaborating ? 
  right , well , we disagree on inconsequential , then . 
  i do get it now , though . 
  why not ? 
  you could save millions of those emails , and then you could draws graphs about when they are sending them by time of day/day of week !, 
  or whatever . 
  ` crap ' ? 
  what makes you hate it so much ? 
  this is good for bitcoin , though . 
  because software development takes time and money . 
  to be fair , the base game concludes the plot and is absolutely worth its price . 
  just like the dlc that is released on android . 
   \\ - hey , boss , now that forgotten shores is out , what do you want us to do ? 
  \\ - yeah , i think we should make another dlc , apple said they want to release stuff for an aids donation drive , let 's do something for that . 
  how much time will that take ? 
  \\ - 3 months for the ios version and 2 months for the android port . 
  \\ - i hate those android people !, 
  let 's fuck them over and not port the dlc ** \\* evil laughter ***, 
  do you really think that 's how they made this decision ? 
  yeah i know right ? 
  i asked if they were going to port the game over to windows phone for my phone and they said no . 
  what the fuck are they thinking , just saying no like that , acting like they can work on other stuff before releasing monument valley on all platforms ? 
  * ios has ` x ` potential paying customers, 
  * android has ` 0.1 x ` potential paying customers, 
  * windows phone has ` 0.01 x ` potential paying customers, 
  who are you ^ ^ [ 0 ] to tell them that the magical threshold where they are required to waste money on development just to make a few fans happy is less than ` 0.1 x ` but more than ` 0.01 x ` ? 
  [ 0 ] : edit : plural , as in commenters in this thread, 
  please tell me the reason you have more accurate analytics than the developer . 
  so you 're accusing the developers of ... not wanting to make a profit ? 
  my bad , see edit . 
  something like that . 
  the point was not for me to provide accurate estimates , it 's entirely possible that , i dunno , the android port would take one day , with a team of five people working at $ 25/hr , making the total cost of development $ 1000 , and they 're expecting $ 800 in sales . 
  the point is that they 're not releasing it on android because they would lose money on it , not because they hate us . 
  i would wager that the people who made the game are orders of magnitude more qualified to make such a decision , being the people who do this as a full time job , risking their livelihood on it , and also being in possession of the exact sales analytics , than the teenagers on reddit who are angry cause they 're not going to be able to pirate a few more levels of the game . 
  and before people point the hyperbole out : feel free to swap that last part out with ` than reddit commenters ' and my point still stands . 
  i do n't know , they seem to be pretty successful with the production of that one phone . 
  well in that case , i do n't think he should be talking about production . 
  dude , for a company that was founded less than a year ago , even that is a really , really impressive number , let alone the actual sales figures . 
  straight from your source :, 
   by the resources from inside xiaomi , the sales number of xiaomi mobile phone in 2011 is only 300,000, 
  so that makes it ... 300k in 3 months for xiaomi and 500k in 5 months for oneplus ? 
  wikipedia says the oneplus one was released in june , and the 500k number is from a november 5 interview . 
  that 's 5 months 4 days at most . 
  and i think it 's reasonable to expect an acceleration in sales once the phone is publicly available and launches in more countries . 
  how can you be so sure of that ? 
  name clashes with an irc client : http://www.codeux.com/textual/, 
  dude wtf :d, 
  they had $ 5.8 m total revenue and $ 145k on launch day . 
  that 's 2.5 % . 
  what the hell were you thinking ? 
  please think about this a bit more . 
  we established that the day with the most revenue was 2.5 % of the total . 
  all other days must then make up less than 2.5 % each , meaning that your seven day period could still at most be 7 times 2.5 % , which is 17.5 % . 
  so here we are , without any business analyst experience , making baseless assumptions on how the market works and drawing mindless conclusions , just to find out that even the numbers fueling these arbitrary assumptions were themselves merely assumptions ? 
  nice going , / r/android !, 
  whatever it takes to protect the prestige of the android user base . 
  you got ta be kidding me . 
  first you say 90 % of their revenue came from day one , then after getting called out on that you correct it to ' 90 % of their revenue came from week one ' and downplay it as just some minor wording issue , then you actually do the calculations and see how the first week was only around 20 % of the revenue and you show no signs whatsoever of realizing that you were wrong . 
  and worst of all , you then start confusing metrics with their units of measurement . 
  revenue is what the chart displays , and its unit of measurement is usd/day . 
  these things are no different , the data means exactly the same , one of the wordings is just incorrect but not too difficult to understand . 
  compare this with the horizontal axis that measures time , and the unit is days . 
  see how time & days relates to revenue & dollars ? 
   actually , i 'm an accountant, 
  gosh darn , is this a sitcom i 'm in ? 
  on a more serious note :, 
  the numbers are n't fine . 
  our two points of data are :, 
  * total revenue for all sales, 
  * revenue for the day with the most sales, 
  but we actually can not deduce anything of interest from these two numbers accurately , as the price of the game varies with the countless sales and discounts !, 
  and probably there 's some disparity between android and ios revenue per sale as well . 
  entirely my fault , but business analysis was n't actually what i was thinking of . 
  my issue is with that one guy who ca n't do maths thinking he knows exactly how the audience responds to different forms and quantities of advertisement , delays in launch , et cetera . 
  the phrase for this completely escapes my mind right now , some kind of market research or audience analytics or whatever . 
  oh , i find it important to also note that with, 
   here we are , without any business analyst experience , making baseless assumptions on how the market works, 
  i was referring to / u/nineteenseventy . 
  i only now realized that it sounded as if it was directed at you instead . 
   we actually have a lot more data than that . 
  fair point . 
  i did n't consider the daily revenue as data purely out of neglect , as i did n't take the time to calculate the approximate values , so i kinda just ignored its existence . 
  i dunno , i 'm tired and only half present in the discussion :(,
