   there 's no need to throw around insults . 
  indeed , i apologize . 
  i just got too mad over the commenter not rescinding his statements after being presented with a clear explanation of why he was wrong . 
   forecasting how a market will react is a very different field from analyzing how a market did react . 
  the problem is , to analyze how the market reacted , you need to be able to correctly identify the causative relationships in the available data . 
  it is not enough to just say ` ios had more ads , more sales , android has less ads , less sales ; clearly it 's all cause of advertising ! ', 
  because that is hardly the entire story . 
  i 'm certain that we have insufficient information to deduce exactly how much everything affected the number of sales on android . 
  squarespace a is well-respected hosting provider ( among other things . ), 
  the mirror will surely be useful for some regardless , but i wanted to note that the original host is unlikely to crash . 
  i think we reached a point of perfect agreement here . 
  what a night !, 
  well , guys , and you know what they say : if / u/frozen _ in_reddit has n't heard about it ... 
   have you tried resetting the cmos, 
  oh right , forgot to mention , yeah i did . 
  yeah , i 'm on it , thanks for the help !, 
  i 've never seen a moto 360 in person , but on photos it looked so much nicer than a perfect circle would look , with the bottom of the cards being cut off and all that . 
  which of those permissions do you have issues with ? 
  ~ ~ i do n't see how any of that does n't apply to europe . ~ ~ sorry , i must have misread that when i wrote this circa two hours ago . 
  why ? 
  they invested in the company , not the device . 
  now that christmas is over , can i have some leftover trees too ? 
  can you give me a quick summary this ? 
  if they are severe enough , i 'd rather just delete my post to prevent spreading misinformation . 
  fair enough , thanks for the heads up anyhow . 
  the best i can do is ask the mods if they could tag the post as ` partly inaccurate ' or something . 
  sorry for not mentioning this in my comment , but in lieu of a source given by op i did some research myself between my two comments , and reached the conclusion that a warning label would be appropriate . 
  gee , well you 're pretty useless * rolls eyes *, 
  well if he finds one of the sets with real money inside ... 
  or the good old `` france is bacon '' . 
   why waste my time ? 
  whoa hold on there now . 
  who wasted your time ? 
  and how ? 
  and why did you let them do so ? 
  [ it 's been a really long time since i last got to use this .

  wow , c # ? 
  [ here you go .

  noting down a few timestamps a day is now called datamining ? 
  the event is obviously triggered by the gc , i do n't think it 's that far-fetched to conclude that that is the only way to go about it . 
  well that 's a problem . 
  data mining is actually the name of the scientific process of performing data analysis on large data structures , as opposed to opening a file and reading timestamps out of it . 
  do you think you can give an estimate on how much of earth 's energy pool was used up by this bug ? 
  i mean , that sounds like it would be a pretty fun and eye opening data point . 
  stephen j. pulscher won the economic nobel last year for his paper titled ` mathematical proof that being paid in advance is the best thing ever ' . 
  do some research , man . 
  how is that at all relevant to someone saying the sysadmin was mad at marketing and being corrected ? 
  how is dota 2 different in that regard ? 
  i 'm one of those who prefer the look of flat-tire to a perfect circle . 
  it just seems to fit the card screen so much better . 
  so your problem is that we have buttons instead of checkboxes ? 
  woop woop , really glad to see they 're doing so well , hope they 'll be able to handle the sudden increase in workload now . 
  it allowed them to expand at a pace they were comfortable with . 
  a preorder system would have had them make a commitment for each preorder made . 
  everyone would have been outraged if oneplus could n't keep up with the number of preorders and could only ship in half a year . 
  so all you 're saying is , you would rather pay and wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready , than wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready and then buy it ? 
  why did you buy that nexus if what you really wanted was to wait an indefinite amount of time for a oneplus one ? 
  you could 've just ... well , waited . 
  also maybe invest the money for these few months instead of spending it on a phone , then you 'd make money in the process , too . 
  what ? 
  just two comments up you said you wanted to preorder one with an uncertain shipping date , and only got a nexus because you could n't do that . 
   why would anyone wait two/three months to save a bit of money , when they could get a nexus 5 or a moto x and get it right now . 
  ask the one million people ^ [ \\ [ source \\ ] ] ( http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/01/11/oneplus-one-hit-almost-1-million-sales-in-2014-successor-coming-soon/ ) who did that , which incidentally is also how many phones oneplus could manufacture in that timeframe . 
  i ca n't wrap my head around how a person can be so entitled that he 's angry at a company for not growing fast enough . 
  if anything , this shows that oneplus is on the right track . 
  i still do n't understand . 
  how is that different from deciding to buy the phone when it comes out ? 
  here , let me demonstrate :, 
  bob says :, 
   man , that huawei watch looks really slick . 
  i 'm getting one when it comes out !, 
  bob is at this point :, 
  - certain that he 's getting the watch, 
  - uncertain about when, 
  - still in possession of his money, 
  - able to change his mind if the moto 720 comes out the next day, 
  alice says :, 
   wow , i love the huawei watch !, 
  i 'll mail my money to them right now and ask them to send me a unit once it 's released . 
  alice is then :, 
  - certain that she 's getting the watch, 
  - uncertain about when, 
  - out of a few hundred bucks, 
  - unable to change her mind if the moto 720 comes out the next day, 
  tell me one reason you 'd rather be alice . 
  please . 
  no , actually , believe it or not , there 's people who like metal , and there 's people who like plastic , too !, 
  i 'm pretty sure this is lower level , most likely a reset packet over tcp ( typically written as connection reset by peer . ), 
  the http comms could be gzipped too , though !, 
  eve online comes to mind ; a group of the players does courier missions , while another group tries to steal the goods delivered by them , while others just pay people to keep their manufacturing business afloat with these deliveries , which in turn allows them to create items used by the pirates , and so on ; i think all these layers kinda fit what you 're asking about . 
  google now is the predictive display of cards . 
  you meant google voice search . 
   a company putting a bounty on itself is hilarious . 
  why ` post / poll_init ` and ` get / poll_result ? id = 1 ` instead of ` post / polls ` and ` get / polls/1 ` ? 
  similarly , why is there a separate ` / text ` and ` / texts ` ? 
  does n't seem very restful to me : /, 
  lookety look : https://github.com/whitehouse/api-standards#restful-urls, 
  should i wait for that being released before i order my next batch ?
