  he still could kill the robot ducks . 
  how would you travel around the world ? 
  no , do n't worry , i was just kidding . 
  probably when everyone disappeared there were lots of cars on the streets , which are still stuck there , it would take a pretty large car to pass them :p, 
  edit : also , i think you ca n't get enough petrol without people maintaining the system . 
  guys , should we take away the teddybears too ? 
  * muhahahaha . 
  and where would you get the petrol from ? 
  i think they need people to maintain it . 
  for thousands of cars ? 
  you could mention in your resume that you are the only living person who has ever walked 1000 miles .

  i guess you figured it out ... 
  uh-oh , or the self-destruct mechanism built into the software got you . 
  i guess i should have mentioned that . 
  yeah , that one . 
  if i recall correctly it also presses the dash and the enter keys before detonating . 
  edit : oh you stupid typo , why ca n't you fix yourself ?

  hah , i can bear games playing at 640 \u00d7 480 , if it lags on better graphics . 
  i played through mass effect 2 on absolute minimum settings , at 10-15 fps . 
  anyway , thanks for the answer !, 
  trust me , i wo n't be that guy . 
  i also hate snipers . 
  whoops , i forgot to mention i bought a new gpu since then . 
  hd 5770 , and an e8400 as cpu , those should do , i think .

  of course the blank data from the rom files is excluded from this . 
  also the games ` zombie nation ' and ` dance aerobics ' seem to be missing . 
  yes , but i think the compression was mostly just removing zeroes , the rest of it is hardly compressed . 
  the raw data is ... 150 mb . 
  now that i think of it , more than half of it ca n't be blank , so there must be a bit of extra compression in it . 
  i would guess it must be around 100-120 megabytes then ... damn , if only i could edit the title now :(,

  i 'm 16 and i remember the turbo buttons too , also i used dos on my first computer , since win95 was n't working , and i had no idea how to fix it . 
  it 's feel so great to have already seen this 2 days before it arrived at reddit . 
  anyway , [ source ] ( http://bradcolbow.com/archive/view/the_brads_how_to_stop_wikileaks/ ) . 
   how awesome and tech savyy he is because he knows about 286/386/486 turbo button , floppy drives and ms-dos, 
  seriously ? 
  that 's what makes one tech-savvy and awesome ? 
  anyway , i got an old , used pc from one of my parents ' friends for my birthday . 
  edit : also , funny how i thought i was an idiot for a moment there just because a random redditor ( who does n't even have a hundred karma :p ) said `` i 'm calling bs on that one .

  my guess is that he is a fan of a certain movie called `` tron '' .
