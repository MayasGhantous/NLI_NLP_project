  we cumulatively spent at least an hour laughing at that . 
   everything started on time, 
  right , except when c9 were 40 minutes late to their premium area signing session , and even then they did n't have ee and n0tail there . 
  okay but counting you is cheating , you laughed for an hour at a simple neigh . 
  a friend of mine wrote up some pretty lengthy criticism , [ it might be useful ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/3aougk/esl_one_frankfurt_2015_feedback/ ) . 
   they are focusing on vr, 
  do we even know anything about how large a part of the company is working on vr ? 
  of all the reasons there are to be mad at steam 's support , you just did n't hit any . 
  how did you get scammed out of items in the first place ? 
  valve is making so much effort to make sure no one with half a brain gets scammed . 
  also , if someone scammed you out of $ 1k , would you be mad at the treasury for not printing you a thousand dollars to reimburse you ? 
  so * that 's * the train we were supposed to get on !, 
  but you need to be awake !, 
  so it 's a good idea to fill my bags with rocks just in case ? 
  hold on a sec , who is gold ? 
  to be fair , the less paternosters there are , the more business he gets . 
  come on guys , let 's get him down to -16 !, 
  well what do you have to say to this , then ? 
  yoga, 
  i 'd prefer if the all-star match did n't have a monetary incentive for victory , i liked how the players did n't take the match that seriously in the previous years . 
  this entire thread is about a person whose request was denied twice , for your information . 
  a visa is not a proper noun , you do n't have to capitalize it . 
  why was ` obtained ' and ` their ' not capitalized , then ? 
   expenditure consists of taking workshop stuff and selling it, 
  you surely do n't actually believe that . 
  they just released the reborn client beta and are deploying 30 item long changesets to it every two days . 
  come on .

  sounds great !, 
  i backed sportsfriends on kickstarter actually , but never got move controllers to be able to play jsj . 
  really glad you made this game !, 
  mine burned down after 3-4 months . 
  got credit for it at the store and bought an hd 5850 whose price went down to how much the hd 5770 was . 
  seriously , it looks like just a regular 13 mp photo blown up to twice the size . 
  i ca n't believe so many people are falling for it . 
   it 's rare that the original is outdone by the copy cats, 
  like google for search and facebook for social networks , right ? 
  with no knowledge of how exactly this works , i think allowing sites to vibrate the phone is entirely reasonable , and i 'm also pretty sure that chrome ca n't really differentiate if the request to vibrate came from the actual site , or an embedded ad . 
  i feel like the solution is the same as for sites with ads that have sound . 
  just do n't use them . 
  explanation by an iama moderator here : https://np.reddit.com/r/blackout2015/comments/3cebd5/5_sockpuppets_have_just_been_added_as_riama_mods/csuv3lp, 
  i 've been bugging cyborgmatt for months to change it , making this modification myself to demonstrate my point , and even helped him a little on irc to change it , so this has kind of been my cause to fight for in the past two months . 
  i did it because ... i do n't know . 
  i guess the small differences are more easily identifiable and analyzable . 
  but it does make the big picture less apparent , such as the difference between the peaks along the x axis . 
  actually / u/cyborgmatt can you change it back ? 
  awww , do n't do this to #steamdb :(, 
  oh , right , have n't actually checked the link :3, 
  < @steamdb  '' changelist 1159680 ( 1 apps and 0 packages ) - https://steamdb.info/changelist/1159680, 
  < @steamdb  app : 570 - dota 2 ( needs token ), 
  fixing that formatting for you . 
   improper hotkeys removed, 
  going the family-friendly route , huh , valve ? 
  www.dotabank.com might have been confusing them . 
  i do n't think that would be worth the time investment . 
  why do you think they should do that ? 
  yep ,, 
   cycling through different color profiles only really changed the lighter colors . 
  do we actually know the reason why his applications are declined ? 
  cause if not , you ca n't really call this bullshit -- they might have a legitimate reason . 
  what 's your source for that ? 
  ha-ha . 
  you know you do n't buy visas , right ? 
  so by that argument , private islands are not worth their price either cause the vast majority would n't pay millions for one as they 're lacking the money ?
