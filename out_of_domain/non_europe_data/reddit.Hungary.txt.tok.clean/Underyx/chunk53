  that 's not much of an improvement over the original 360 then .

  here 's a guide for [ prepaid sim cards in the us ] ( http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/united_states ) . 
  well that 's not very nice . 
  now tell me / u/aaa12585 , what do you do for a living ? 
  oh , so you do have income ? 
  you must be kicking yourself for that , re ` neither is monetization ' . 
  you said monetization is not a nice thing , which i find just plain outlandish . 
  i ca n't think of a single reason why this discussion should be made private . 
  so then , can you explain why you think making money is a bad thing ? 
  they would be silly not to consider it , that 's like six bucks of revenue promised in a reddit comment !, 
  should 've invested in cross-platform thesis tech !,

  software development . 
  it 's surprisingly refreshing to see news blips about just plain adoption instead of kind of sensationalized headlines about newish tech that 's sorta accurate and sorta new and sorta real . 
   mistake ? 
  yep . 
  yep , happened to us too . 
  we asked the guys at juggernaut plaza and they said that they will replace the wrong autograph runes with rotk ones after the event based on timestamps . 
  of the the international ? 
  i liked it . 
  dude , go to emp and buy a pass from someone who 's leaving . 
  i got one for fifty . 
  my girlfriend spent over 20 hours preparing and was really excited about her first game , but she was placed into [ this high skill game ] ( http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1645835449 ) for her first match , got killed 21 times , got flamed a lot , and decided never to play dota again . 
  ** edit ** : for the record , i 'm mentioning this as an example as how bad it can be even if you are really committed . 
  ** edit 2 ** : i 'm seeing two things mentioned in replies so much that i will just answer them right here . 
   why would you give her luna and not a support ? 
  while it may seem obvious to all of you saying this that a new player in a high skill game should pick safer heroes , you are neglecting to consider that we totally did not expect the game to be high skill . 
  luna 's one of the heroes who has guided hero bot matches in reborn , and my girlfriend did pretty well with her , and i felt like the high move speed was good enough for escaping in < 1k mmr . 
  and most importantly , for all we knew in the hero pick stage , my girlfriend was the best player out of all 10 , since we expected everyone to be having one of their first matches , and she had the advantage of having read and watched tons of guides , and also having played lots of bot games . 
   why did n't she play bot matches instead ? 
  she did play a lot of those , just not co-op ones . 
  i did n't think a co-op match would have been very useful at that point , as again , ` for all we knew in the hero pick stage , my girlfriend was the best player out of all 10 ' . 
  what do you think i meant by '20 hours preparing ' ? 
  what 's even more scary is that she won the game . 
  the game might now think she actually belongs in high skill . 
  the dialog actually did n't show for her . 
  hell , i do n't even know how to deal with brood myself . 
  she was using her own account , obviously . 
  i was not in that game , and she queued solo . 
   if you 're going to be learning skills , getting used to movespeed , reading items , why play against people ? 
  she was n't doing any of those . 
  she had a pretty good grasp on the basics as she played lots of bot games before this one .

  actually , she played lots of bot matches before this one . 
  she did play alone . 
  new account , queued solo . 
  i think this is the first actual useful reply i got , thank you !, 
  i completely forgot that limited heroes mode existed . 
  she started with tons of bot games . 
  this was after she played a whole bunch of those .
