  that 's what my comment was about , yes . 
  we 're sorry , but your post has been removed as spam . 
  please refer to the [ reddit self-promotion guidelines ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion ) to find out how to avoid this . 
  the most relevant section of the guidelines is most likely this :, 
   you should submit from a variety of sources ( a general rule of thumb is that 10 % or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content ) , talk to people in the comments ( and not just on your own links ) , and generally be a good member of the community . 
  any further posts that are not compliant with these guidelines may result in a ban from / r/androidwear . 
  media is already the plural form of medium if i recall correctly , no need to tack on an s at the end . 
  do you actually have any evidence that this is more prevalent in the usa than any other country ? 
  each nation obviously discusses news more if they are involved . 
  just imagine the huffleville , wa local news station reporting on phorson , fl 's interstate baseball victory in the other corner of the country over their own . 
  so did everyone forget ti4 being the cover story of the new york times ? 
  there 's so much wrong with this comment , i do n't even know where to begin . 
  i know people from the usa who are well versed in european affairs . 
  most europeans do n't know a lot about other european countries ' governments . 
  lots of europeans do n't know who the president of the usa is . 
  it would make sense for people all over the world to know about the potus as he 's leading the # 1 economy of our planet , contrary to the leadership of any european country . 
  most of this is just anecdotal evidence against your anecdotal evidence , but that even that should be enough to demonstrate how silly your reply was . 
  op made no mention of hex . 
  no , it depends on how much you are willing to cooperate with the community by using the same name that everyone does . 
  wait up , you dropped this !,

  they also make the chassis design way more complicated , and as a result , the phone more bulky . 
  okay , let 's walk through it then , step by step . 
  what are the incentives driving a company when designing a new phone ? 
  here 's all of them :, 
  * we want to sell as many as possible so we can make a large profit, 
  so then , how do you make a phone that lots of people will buy ? 
  the answer is not ask / r/android , but instead to go with what people actually want , which is a nice , thin phone . 
  hope that helped you understand . 
  you know all batteries are replaceable , right ? 
  it does not really make sense to plan your obsolence by omitting a battery replacement mechanism , when anyone can just walk into a store and have their battery replaced for thirty bucks or something anyway . 
  oh god no , more publicity . 
  you know , we actually regretted doing this , since having more visitors only makes us lose even more money on operating the site :d, 
   price gauging, 
  that 's right , those goddamn companies need to stop measuring prices !, 
  we have ads but you 're blocking them :(, 
  edit : to provide some extra information , when we started asking for donations almost a year ago , [ we published data about our income and expenses here ] ( http://dotabank.com/donate/ ) . 
  as you can see there we make around 10 bucks a month from ads while it costs 150 usd to run the site . 
  not much has changed since then , and we 've received four donations for a total of 44 usd over these 10 months . 
  that 's weird , there 's supposed to be [ two ad units right on the homepage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nzcfumu.png ) . 
  you probably are inadverently blocking them with some privacy guard/script blocking extension ? 
  i do n't know . 
  not that it matters that much , anyway :d, 
  welp . 
  / u/rjacksonm1 do something !, 
  did we ? 
  that 's just the ti4 surge in traffic dropping off . 
  we 've only grown since then . 
  all that sounds good , but i do n't see an easy way of actually storing over a tb of replays with them . 
  google 's nearline however would be perfect for us , but then there 's a problem of the team lacking any motivation to migrate over . 
  it certainly does !, 
  i think it 's safe to say that that is around 500 times more than we could 've made if you turned adblock off . 
  thanks a lot !,
