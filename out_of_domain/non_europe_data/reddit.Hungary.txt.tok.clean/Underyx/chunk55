  please realize that some of the world 's best engineers are working on this . 
  i find it aggravating that you feel like you can dismiss the hundredth iteration design that these people have come up with as their best solution yet , after having spent tens of thousands of hours thinking about this problem cumulatively , while , as i 'm guessing , you just read a few articles about ara . 
  anyway , have you never had a cover fall off when dropping your phone ? 
  how are audio sensors going to work if you cover them ? 
  how about practically any other kind of sensor other than a camera ? 
  how would this affect heat dissipation ? 
  can you not think of any modules that would need to actually touch something else to use ? 
  and worst of all , why are people agreeing with you ? 
  great !, 
  now , please read the rest of my comment . 
  how about side buttons or sensors ? 
  just the first thing that popped into my mind , there probably are tons of issues that neither of us considered . 
  the magnets they had were already an upgrade from a bumper based solution , and what they just now announced is that they have something that 's even better than those magnets . 
  i do n't even know what you 're arguing against at this point . 
  but i could n't find a single reason he said about why the bumper would be preferable to magnets , and i could n't find one about why it would be better than the new design , either , since that has n't even been announced yet . 
  the only non-issue you have here is the interference with other sensors . 
  ( decay is like 1 % per decade , so we 'd be left with 29.7 n of force instead of 30 n after ten years . 
   nobody can argue anything about the new design so why even mention it ? 
  that 's exactly the reason i mentioned it . 
  you come in here blurting on about your moronic bumper frame idea like it 's an obvious answer and you effectively call the ara engineers idiots for thinking any further about the problem than your clearly broken and limiting solution ( `` jesus guys , just use a locking clear back cover design '' ) . 
  dude , no . 
  they had a better way to solve this than yours for the past three years . 
  they came up with something even better now . 
  just shut up with that bumper already , alright ? 
  but i have the correct flair and title :(, 
  but the deadline was reached 16 hours ago ? 
  go back to weighing the pros and cons of wine selection . 
  it 's like a game of chess !, 
  editorializing is different from editing . 
  the point is that you 're supposed to stay entirely objective in the wording of your title , so it should n't reflect your own opinion , just the facts . 
  if you [ search for ` which ' in this subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/androidwear/search?q=which&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) , every second result is exactly what you 're looking for . 
  sorry about that . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker and i just ca n't seem to be able to shake thinking of ` guy ' as a gender neutral word . 
  i 'm just really bad at all this , are n't i :(, 
  a year or so ago microsoft did this for me with an office 365 subscription . 
  had a nice chat with the support rep , too , pretty much my best experience with any kind of support ever .
