  oh right , i guess i did n't even read that far . 
  edited to add a highlight on that too . 
  hey , i paid for a year accidentally !, 
  ... it 's totally fine though , i love you guys < 3, 
  here 's a stack exchange ux answer about this : http://ux.stackexchange.com/a/50266, 
  i just wrote a note on a post-it , turned on my radio and played a tape without an internet connection . 
  all of it worked .

  thank you !,

  ` okay , radio , insert tape ' ? 
   a youtube video on how to open a can with a spoon, 
  where is it ? 
  girlfriend and i moved out , got 4 cans to open , and no can opener . \\, 
  edit : by the way , do n't bother answering , a search for ` how to open a can with a spoon ' had it as result # 1 , just wanted to put this out there . 
  edit 2 : it worked !, 
  was not even that difficult . 
  / u/croatianpride you could learn something from this man . 
  yep , i myself used a glove .

  that 's what psa means , indeed . 
  but why would this have ` public service announcement ' in the title ? 
  that 's just ridiculous . 
  it 's like a psa that only tells plumbers that there 's a new standard for pipes that have a better flow rate . 
  the people would want plumbers to know , granted , since they want a higher flow rate and therefore want them to know how to work with the new standard , but the announcement itself can not be acted upon by 99.99 % of the viewers , which makes it a waste of time for them , and all the plumbers knew already anyway . 
  [ you can actually do that in $ 200 even with buying just 20 days in advance ] ( https://us.skypicker.com/cheap-flights-from-chicago-united-states-to-missoula-united-states/departure-27-10-2015-27-10-2015/return-2-10 ) , it 's just that most search engines do n't combine low cost carriers ' flights like the spirit-frontier connection here . 
  fun fact : pnr is actually short for passenger name record and therefore refers to the thing where all the data the airfolks have on file about you is kept . 
  the 6 character code is technically a ` pnr locator ' .

  we had this in hungary for last year 's elections : http://www.voks14.hu/, 
  the in-app results were off from the real ones by a lot : for the largest two parties they had [ 41.6 % and 23.8 % ] ( https://www.facebook.com/voks14/photos/pb.467501020025812.-2207520000.1444485044./555786264530620/?type=3&amp;theater ) on record , while the actual results were [ 25.99 % and 44.54 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_parliamentary_election,_2014#/results ) ( yes , the other way around . ), 
  to this day [ they are posting some pretty cool stats ] ( https://www.facebook.com/voks14/photos_stream ) though , they have a new poll each day about a variety of topics , and they post the correlations they find between the answers and demographic data/political preference of users .
