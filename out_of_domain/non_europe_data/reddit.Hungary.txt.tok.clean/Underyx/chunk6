   i 'm lazy , that 's all i can say . 
  ftfy, 
  well , i do it mostly so that i wo n't be seen while i am struggling to get change from the bottom of my wallet , not for the convenience of others . 
  if being fair means crushing my dreams , please do n't be fair . 
  what about a web service where people vote on other the coding of players ? 
  or at least a new subreddit where we post a task once a day/week and redditors post their solutions in comments , and the most upvoted one is the winner . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/d8q2x/your_move_captcha/ ), 
  feel free to ask me what a sentence means in the article if the google translate version is hard to understand . 
  the short summary in english :, 
   saturday night three young girls died in the night club called `` west balk\u00e1n '' in budapest . 
  at first , people said they were stabbed with a knife , and there are still people claiming to be eyewitnesses who say they saw them get stabbed , but the police says panic broke out in the club , and that 's when they died . 
  of course i am . 
  may i ask you where you got the idea from for that username ? 
  what 's wrong with super vision ? 
  dont you mean \u0ca5 \\ _ \u0ca5 ? 
  hahaha, 
  minute . 
  is it possible in the chrome dev tools ? 
  edit : actually , i only made this comment to check it , and yes , it is possible . 
  ctrl-shift-i , network tab . 
  me too . 
  this must be it . 
  they also recently released auditorium on the psp . 
  [ lookie ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/f0fj3/meanwhile_in_italy/ ), 
  that 's still too much . 
  edit : [ ] ( / rtroll ),

  oonce oonce oonce oonce . 
  did bashir just bash the competition ? 
  edit : okay , this was just a lame joke quickly thought of only to be one of the first commenters , hoping to get lucky with karmistic matters . 
  yes , please create a subreddit for beginners . 
  i 'm too afraid to ask noobish questions here :(, 
  op contained, 
  yay for the [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://reddit.honestbleeps.com ) , which let me see the [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2w0q.jpg ) . 
  edit : disregard first version , acquire [ slightly improved one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zbbxr.jpg ) . 
  here you go , a production with my limited photoshop skills : http://i.imgur.com/jslcl.jpg, 
   it 's repost like that , that makes me enjoying it . 
  what . 
  i clicked only once , i swear :(, 
  now i waited 2 minutes to see your comment shown there . 
  let 's make an exception with my comment !, 
  edit : yay , thanks !, 
  do you need an alpha tester ? 
  i am totally volunteering . 
  awesome game , but where is braid and portal from it ? 
  now , if i adjust the sign sent to you by wendy , without you knowing it , and i win , would you give me the money i won , or would you just storm out ? 
  alright , and would you still bet if i set some conditions like `` wendy has to leave before you can turn around and see the items '' , so that i have time to change everything she touched , hoping to mix up the sign left by her ? 
  also , happy cake-day :d, 
  that 's sad :(, 
  you know , i would have looked at you with this evil smile and stuff like that . 
  well , people who do n't get the reference downvote him . 
  however , people who get it probably downvote him too . 
  huh , true . 
  looks like i missed it , i just scrolled down quickly looking for comments starting with a lower case g. 
  well , the billboard suddenly just got a few thousand extra views , you know . 
  now that 's what we call a close friend here , on reddit , right ? 
  the screenshots need antialiasing . 
  empty food bowls in the background :(, 
  well , not a negligent owner then . 
  however , you will be a dead one in the near future , looking at the picture . 
  or to mail it to someone , once it has grown up . 
  to make the world a weirder place , and stuff . 
  yet , no upvotes are coming my way . 
  the karmawhore inside me is sad . 
  ( that 's equal to `` i am sad . '' ), 
  i think with such a sign , no one would steal even a diamond . 
  they would think it 's a trap , they are being recorded , the area is surrounded by cops , and some millionaire is just trying to have fun catching potential criminals . 
  `` your hole is our first one we 've ever played golf on . '', 
  seriously , you did n't even wait [ a month before reposting ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ero78/ ) ? 
  it was n't . 
  not really , the joke 's starting to get too old . 
  first time i 've ever forgotten to read the username even after two re-reads of the comment . 
  upvoting a dirty car ? 
  well , now that you mention it ** you would n't downvote a car ** !, 
  my reaction : oh cool , it 's mario . 
  hey , it 's a bunch of music too !, 
  i do n't think he can read this . 
  too late . 
  depends . 
  it goes like genesis , genetwo , genethree , genefour , genefive and only after * that * are they genesix . 
  edit : oh , fun fact : around 40 million genefortymillion were ever produced . 
  also , i bet you all are amazed at my exceptionally professional private data-removal technique . 
  because i do n't always go to a game 's page to watch the video . 
  it was probably because the upvotes , if you are interested . 
  you know , when enough people press the arrow that 's pointing upwards on a submission in a subreddit you are subscribed to , reddit places it on your front page , because it thinks it 's a good submission . 
  i have the game , so i 'm not entering your pif , but i think i should note that the multiplayer part is basically dead , no one plays . 
  so unless you are fine with not playing against random strangers either , could you please let the ones with friends who have the game get the game ? 
  thanks :p, 
  ( and the singleplayer part is much more boring than multiplayer with friends ), 
  alright , i will go first . 
  what is your job , barneygale ?
