  i do n't think they are bad ( especially in a one off query ) , and i do n't really feel bad either . 
  and i would like to see anyone accomplish selecting based on a predicate involving a window function 's result with one query . 
  we will get on that right away ? 
  you know you ca n't really assume that they are a resident just by them posting a photo of the airport , right ? 
  well , that 's weird , i actually went to seattle in august ... 
  did op just write a title that had a title of its own ?

  lastpass stores passwords after they are encrypted on your local machine , and you decrypt them locally when you retrieve one , so even when using lastpass , you do n't have ` one password that some random company holds ' .

  the example given in the survey was ` look what my wife just bought ' . 
  the rule will cover posts about people being ` so excited ' that they post photos of just their new watch , and the equivalent . 
  as written in the post above :, 
   we will start actively removing the following posts ** once we 've written up clear rules **, 
  naturally , it will be possible to start a discussion if you feel like the exact rules are too strict . 
  while we are at it , can we just take this discussion to / r/ampart ? 
  you got it , mr.
