  the bootloop i 'm stuck in . 
  edit : it was because i did n't realize that this nightly is already rooted and i flashed supersu . 
  move along !, 
  what 's the chance of getting a faulty device ? 
  my guess would be around 0.1 % , but let 's count with 1 % . 
  in this case , let 's assume you could buy a oneplus two for $ 329 or an equally good phone for $ 349 , which has a 0 % chance for being defective ( ha-ha ) . 
  let 's say both of these phones have a value of 1 ( in phone value units or whatever ) . 
  so then : if one thousand people buy the $ 349 phones , they will end up with 1000 value for $ 349,000 , which is 349 $ / value , and if one thousand buy the oneplus two , they will end up with 10 faulty devices , which have a value of zero ( that actually is n't true but whatever ) , and for $ 329,000 they will have a total of 990 value , which is 332.33 $ / value . 
  the rational decision would be to buy a oneplus two in this case . 
   or you could buy a phone from a reputable seller like amazon and have no downtime if it 's defective . 
  my entire comment was about comparing this choice to buying a oneplus . 
  i have no idea how you missed that , but either way , what i wrote up there still stands . 
  and also :, 
   an invite system that is only in place to drive interest, 
  you ca n't prove that and logic points toward this statement being false . 
  oh man , [ this again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/2xwxcd/oneplus_is_expanding_to_all_eu_countries/cp4afqv?context=2 ) ? 
   so all you 're saying is , you would rather pay and wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready , than wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready and then buy it ? 
  then i 'd like to rewrite my quote as, 
   so all you 're saying is , you would rather approve a payment and wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready , than wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready and then buy it ? 
  preferring the invite system on the customers ' side still sounds like a no-brainer to me . 
  and even oneplus should prefer this , since no commitment means that the customers feel less entitled and therefore will be less angry if oneplus slips up with production and ca n't deliver for a long time . 
  not to mention that it would have been a lot harder to raise the price if deemed necessary . 
  dude , if i write a comment detailing and explaining why i would take the risk , please do n't reply to it with the question ` why would you take the risk ? ', 
  which makes it sound like neerja bhanot is a flight . 
  that 's why i went with a value of 0 in the end . 
  having touch screen issues for instance wo n't make my life worse than it would be without a phone . 
  but anyway , considering cumulative value would make more sense . 
  consider the following , with replacing the last arbitrary unit with an even more arbitrary ` value/month ' :, 
  - i start out at zero value/month , with no phone . 
  - i get a oneplus with touch screen issues , so my phone has 0.3 value/mo , and i need to subtract the time i have to spend with customer service . 
  this will hardly amount to more than $ 200 's worth of my time , so let 's place it at around that , -0.5 value/mo . 
  - let 's say this keeps up for two months until i finally get a replacement . 
  this means that after two months i 'm at -0.4 cumulatively, 
  - i 'll use the normal replacement phone for the rest of the year , bringing me up to 9.6 value after 12 months . 
  so that 's :, 
  - with oneplus , 99 % of the time 12.0 value per year , and 1 % of the time 9.6 value per year for $ 329 . 
  this makes my expected value here 11.976 . 
  - with the other phone 12.0 value per year for $ 349 . 
  11.976 value/year for $ 329 versus 12.0 value/year for $ 349 . 
  i did n't really change my opinion . 
  and on the topic of calling this a ` weird mathematical argument ' :, 
  if we just tweak the numbers a bit , we can have similar hypothetical offers :, 
  - a oneplus two equivalent with a $ 50 price tag and 10 % fault rate . 
  - a oneplus two equivalent with a $ 10 price tag and 20 % fault rate . 
  - a oneplus two equivalent with a $ 0.5 price tag and 80 % fault rate . 
  you probably would say yes to buying at least one of these . 
  once we have that , start changing the numbers , gradually making them worse , and try to decide if you 'd still get it . 
  at some point you 'd stop seeing it as a good offer . 
  but the question is , at which point ? 
  this thread shows us that if we go with our gut feelings , we make terribly biased decisions . 
  it 's way more lucrative to use economics and maths to find the answer to questions like this than to just take a wild guess . 
  if you apply this sort of decision making to your life in general -- let 's say you buy 10 items a year based on such calculations -- you will almost certainly be better off than with making guesses . 
  your first point , i refute . 
  i 'm not defending any company , i 'm stating that given these circumstances the right decision is to buy the cheaper phone . 
  i am however willing to concede that my math is shitty , but you will first have to explain why . 
  so instead of breaking the problem down into manageable pieces and guessing about those , you prefer making one large guess ? 
  why would that be better ? 
  which parameters seem off ? 
  what values would you use instead ? 
  what values would you use instead ? 
  maybe you think that every fifth oneplus device is defective ? 
  ( which would make it hundreds of thousands of defective ones . ), 
  perhaps you think that having to talk to oneplus support would just utterly destroy your life so much that your life would be in ruins for two months , resulting in a -1 value/month ? 
  well , even with these ridiculous numbers , you get 11.32 value per year for $ 329 against 12 per year for $ 349 , so 29.06 $ / value/year against 29.08 $ / value/year . 
  since the results are such a landslide , i did n't think the exact numbers would even matter . 
  the only variable that makes a difference here is the fault rate . 
  i used 20 % which is completely unheard of and way more than any reasonable person would guess . 
  and even with this number , it 's better to buy the cheaper phone . 
  come on . 
  wow , that 's pretty crappy . 
  yeah , seriously , i was offered any phone of my choice at my new job , but i just said i do n't need a new one . 
  had the opo for 16 months now . 
  i 'm not against it , just would like to mention that any time a site sets my status bar orange , i get nervous cause i think my battery is dying and battery saver just got turned on . 
  hey there , i 'm one of the developers at skypicker , and , well , it 's totally legit :d, 
  the reason we have cheap flights like that is that other sites normally only find flight combinations that are supplied by the airlines ( or parties close to them ) , and when the airlines are in charge of connecting flights , they only use the flights of airlines they are allied with . 
  since we check all possible combinations , including those that the airlines do n't offer themselves , it is n't rare that we end up with cheaper flights . 
  we often see 90 % cheaper alternatives on quite a few routes . 
  the issue that all this poses is that by taking these ` unofficial ' connection flights , if the first flight is delayed , you ca n't hold the airlines liable for you missing your connection . 
  but for this very reason we have a thing called the skypicker guarantee -- so in such a case you can just call us , we will find you an alternative , and we 'll book it for you free of charge .
