  i think it 's nice to inform these people . 
  as you said , some are sending insulting messages with no explanation . 
  i would n't want to be on the receiving end of that without any idea of what 's actually going on . 
  it 's right there in your post :, 
   a data breach is a * security incident *, 
  this is n't really a security incident . 
  but as i understand it what 's happening in this case is that as you start being slightly off zero , you will begin to get confused and steer in that direction . 
  i hope it does , having the bottom of cards cut off seems to give the ui a pretty nice aesthetic . 
  be realistic though . 
  what i 'm ( and i guarantee , most people are ) worried about is friends messing with me when i 'm not looking . 
  they can see me punch in my code/pattern every five minutes and remember it , but they are not going to lift and replicate my fingerprint . 
  i 'm immensely curious about why all these commenters are so wary of people trying to break into their phones .

  well not really , ~ ~ he ~ ~ * you might 've previously done something with the computer that you really were n't supposed to do , and that would also count as human error if it ended up breaking the automatic upgrade . 
   does it share it in a way that they can use it but not know it ? 
  this would be impossible ; the password is revealed . 
  though i ca n't think of any reason why that would matter . 
  sorry , but there a million ways to see those , ranging from inspecting the memory of the lastpass process , to simply just looking at the login request sent to the website . 
  if a computer knows something there is n't really any way it can hide it from its user . 
  was n't it only available on chrome os though ? 
  i vaguely remember something like that .
