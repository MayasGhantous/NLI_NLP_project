  i do n't know what to do about this, 
  you mean ` in 20 minutes ' . 
  t-20 minutes refers to a point in time , not an interval . 
  ` in 20 minutes ' also refers to a point in time , that 's not what the issue was , see :, 
  - 20 minutes : interval, 
  - in 20 minutes : point in time, 
  so far so good , everything is correct . 
  - t-20 minutes ( 20 minutes before t ) : point in time, 
  - in t-20 minutes ( in 20 minutes before t ) : ?? 
  i guess , but what does t refer to then ? 
  right , but in this case , what did the commenter refer to by t ? 
   my node will be operational 20 minutes before the node starts . 
  ehhh ... 
  good god , lemon !, 
  what , no . 
   in the context of a rocket launch , the `` t minus time '' is the time before launch , e.g. 
  `` t minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds '' . 
  [ ... ] after a launch , most countdown clocks begin to show mission elapsed time , which is typically shown as `` t plus . '', 
  and even if what you say was true , the comment would still be syntactically incorrect , which was what i pointed out . 
  what is wrong with everyone here ? 
  well , i do n't know , i myself prefer that people tell me when i 'm wrong so i do n't have to embarrass myself later with the same mistake . 
  seems like a few other people learned something from this thread as well . 
  i mean , you probably would n't want to turn in a paper writing ` symantics ' instead of ` semantics ' as you did above , either , right ? 
  oh , and i forgot to point out that you 're still wrong here . 
  t is supposed to be substituted with the time of the event in question . 
  this is why ` t-1 minute ' is 1 minute before liftoff in the case of a rocket launch . 
  if liftoff is at 16:11:24 , then t-00 :01:00 reads as ' 16:11:24 -00:01:00 ' , so it 's 16:10:24 . 
  i find it pretty funny how you say ` correcting people on symantics on the internet when the meaning is obvious is some next level aspergers ' while actually misunderstanding the meaning . 
   everyone understood that . 
  oh , i was n't entirely sure of it . 
  i thought there was a possibility that there 's a release time or something similar and he 's planning to be ready 20 minutes before that with his node . 
  also , [ this commenter ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4442vk/bitcoin_classic_beta_2_released/cznd4ir ) seems to have considered this possibility to be more likely . 
  hope that 's enough for you to disprove that everyone understood it . 
   if it was true you do n't want to embarrass them, 
  i never said i did n't want to . 
  ( i did n't , granted , but why are you attacking a point i never made ? ), 
  i do n't think people really get embarrassed over an anonymous comment on reddit , contrary to the ` turning in a paper ' scenario i mentioned above . 
   why do n't you send a pm instead of broadcasting your correction to the entire thread, 
  as in my above comment : ` seems like a few other people learned something from this thread as well . ', 
  it would also have taken more effort . 
   maybe it 's because you are insecure in other ways and correct others publicly to feel a sliver of mental dominance . 
  when did my personality become relevant to a discussion of whether there was any value in me pointing out the error ? 
  what if i just set the recommended comment sorting to ` new ' ? 
  sorry , i 'm still subscribed so i have that as well :(, 
  yeah , let 's do it !, 
  [ add me on steam ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/underyx ) maybe to carry this out ? 
  traded with / u/sabo _ tabby . 
  my valkyria chronicles + the talos principle for their ftl + ittle dew . 
  i just traded valkyria chronicles away , sorry :(, 
  confirmed !, 
  [ origin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/44fuxy/h_the_talos_principle_company_of_heroes_2_rust/czpwfz7 ), 
  ( made a new comment to not have an edit indicator on the above confirmed one . ), 
  sorry , i do n't fancy any of these that much :(, 
  i 'm pretty interested in pony island + huniepop . 
  i can give you rust + one of the below :, 
  - aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!, 
  for the awesome, 
  - dustforce dx, 
  - super hexagon, 
  - the showdown effect, 
  - thomas was alone, 
  - f.e.a.r. 
  - gratuitous space battles, 
  - nightsky, 
  - awesomenauts, 
  we could also do pony island + huniepop + necrodancer for rust + three from the list . 
  sorry , no deal then . 
  look like i could just sell rust at 7 eur and outright buy those two :(, 
  that 's alright . 
  sorry man , not really interested in any of those . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  nope :(, 
   not sure if i 'm too crazy about storing all of this on their servers . 
  their servers only ever see encrypted data . 
  they ca n't read any of it without your decryption key . 
  what are you worried about ?
