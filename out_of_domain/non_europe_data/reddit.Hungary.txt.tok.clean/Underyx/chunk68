  it 's near impossible to use with a touchpad on mac . 
  / u/wirecats same reply to you . 
  seems like it 's better now . 
  it had some sort of delayed snapping to the slides on the site , but it looks like they disabled that . 
  can i claim a name without owning an xbox console ( i.e. 
  for use with windows ' xbox live service ? ), 
  this probably wo n't exist , but i 'm looking for a racing simulator on the pc with an emphasis on career mode and role playing aspects , preferably with good graphics . 
  i have no idea why , but the one time i have vague memories of playing one of the gran turismo games at a friend 's house and being required to get licenses with driving challenges , and having brand choices ( even of specific car parts ) affect more than just the performance or look of the car , but i 'm not so sure about this part . 
  i seem to also recall some really old racing game called n.i.c.e. 
  that i ca n't even find with google now , but i also have vague memories of even the clothing you choose somehow being important to your career . 
  alright , now that i 've written this down , it sounds a bit stupid , and my memory is playing tricks on me , but still . 
  i also really enjoyed the need for speed series from underground 1 until carbon , for similar reasons ( though being a bit older my preference has shifted away from arcade racing a bit i guess ) . 
  so , anybody got anything like that ? 
  it says so right in the first sentence of the article . 
  i did n't even click the link before asking this question . 
  shame on me , sorry !, 
  i actually own it but there 's something i ca n't quite put my finger on that makes the career feel really bland . 
  it might be just that it feels exactly like the dirt games ; all these games sharing the same system for progressing , the same sorts of characters , and tons of other stuff as well might be breaking the illusion of role playing as a driver . 
  still , nice suggestion , grid 2 might be the closest there is to what i 've described . 
  oh , i think i 've got what my main issue ( and main request ) is :, 
  i just want as much of the game to be not racing as possible . 
  are they the ones with the old google logo on the bottom ? 
  why would you post this here instead of just googling it ? 
  paypal charges 3 % , transferwise charges 1 % in fees . 
  i can vouch for transferwise , it 's really fast and i 've saved ~ ~ like 200 usd ~ ~ 403 usd vs banks in fees with them already . 
  now you need to pay me back for taking the time to google this for you by using [ my referral link ] ( https://transferwise.com/a/188f3f ), 
  edit : oh , also , paypal has crappy currency exchange rates . 
  what 's up with pc racing games ? 
  the whole genre feels really barren . 
  i think burnout paradise for instance was pretty novel all around . 
  i do n't see any reason why a racing game could n't be done now which is a bit ` different ' in a similar way :(, 
  phew , that 's a relief . 
  i 've sent it in already so i guess i 'm in the clear . 
  thanks !, 
  wearing the same pair right now . - . 
  most likely they 've found or are thinking that people who disable adblock after seeing the dialog bring in more revenue than the people who just leave would have had they not been locked out . 
  did you have any alternative explanations in mind ? 
  i do n't really understand your confusion . 
  reposting this from last week , since i got to the party a bit late :,

  so , anybody got anything like that ? 
  alright i guess . 
  i normally try to stay away from making such claims if i have no access to any data . 
  it does indeed !, 
  i just checked a video and i love, 
  - how good the copilot is, 
  - that it 's nearly impossible to win your first races, 
  - how wary you need to be of crashing -- just spent a while playing grid 2 and the stuff i can get away with is ridiculous . 
  - the repair game mechanic between stages seems lovely, 
  - that the stages are relatively long, 
  - that the ai seems to participate in the same reparation metagame as the player , i just saw ` clutch slipping ' as a note next to an ai in the scoreboard . 
  - that there 's a whole team management aspect too , where you hire & train staff, 
  aw yeah , thanks for reminding me of fuel !, 
  that 's an awesome game . 
  actually , the pattern with blizzard seems to be that free to play games have communication limited . 
  they have probably found ( or just thought ) that free users are either more likely to be abusive , or are more sensitive . 
  maybe they are afraid that communication would decrease user retention , which is probably one of their most important metrics , since that 's how they can make money off of microtransactions . 
  it totally makes sense too , when vou think of it this way , i can imagine people abandoning a game after a really bad experience with abuse , but i ca n't really imagine someone deciding not to play again just because they ca n't write whatever they want in chat . 
  are there bans and punishments for comms abuse in starcraft ii , diablo iii , and overwatch ? 
  wait , i thought we were talking about both text and voice comms here . 
  does hots have chat then ? 
  gee , thanks !, 
  i was really close to buying this bundle , you just saved me from quite a hassle . 
  who you replied to was n't the one asking for advice . 
  i think it 's really sad that you had to preface that with `` i 'm sorry . '', 
  to not get dismissed and downvoted immediately . 
  that 's probably our event : http://www.meetup.com/linode/events/231242495/, 
  oh , the lightning talks are not going to be uploaded ? 
   transcription system, 
  not as much of a system as a good stenographer . 
  there was a person typing everything out in real time . 
  also , as of python 3.6 , the underscore can be used as a separator in numeric values , to make them more readable :, 
  true, 
  i had my google account locked when i moved to a new country and the option i needed to use to recover it only showed up in edge , not chrome . 
  source ? 
  i could n't find any mention of the quote in the linked article . 
  i was told [ ulovdomov.cz ] ( http://www.ulovdomov.cz/ ) is the best site for this , if it 's still relevant . 
  thanks !, 
  but ... the market cap means two totally separate things for a currency and for a company . 
  a slightly more meaningful comparison would be the transaction volume of wu and btc . 
  according to blockchain.info this has been around ** $ 170m/day for btc ** for the past 30 days , while western union has had $ 81.6 billion in consumer-to-consumer transfers [ 0 ] , which made up 79.21 % of their revenue [ 1 ] , so i guess we can estimate an annual turnover of $ 103 billion , which comes out to ** $ 282m/day for wu ** over the year of 2015 . 
  and this is n't a very fair comparison either , since all of wu 's transactions are actual transfers , while probably lots of bitcoin transactions are just currency exchange .

  i was looking at the different exchanges , and different currency pairs , and it seemed like there 's quite an arbitrage potential when huge transactions happen on one and the others take sometimes even minutes to keep up . 
  i was thinking it might be easy to make money by just writing some software that aggregates exchange data , figures out the true value of each currency , and trades automatically trying to exploit these differences . 
  now , tell me : why wo n't this work ? 
  was n't that already possible for a year or maybe even multiple years with pushbullet , with the added bonus of supporting windows and android devices as well ? 
   they kinda sucked, 
  i dunno , i found it [ pretty entertaining ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wwffifk.jpg ) ,,
