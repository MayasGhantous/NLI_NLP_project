  i do n't like these mods . 
  and that 's exactly what we 're talking about . 
  the fact that they modify the os means that it 's not what canonical originally called ubuntu anymore . 
  it would be akin to a restaurant adding their own flavoring to the coke they sell ( say , to make it mesh better with their cuisine ) while still calling it coca cola on the menu . 
  nope , it was telia . 
  non-cloudflare sites were affected as well and even your link says, 
   we have identified an issue with an ** upstream transit provider **, 
  out of the few million games played , right . 
  you 're obviously not croatian . 
  huh , if you do n't mind me asking : are you from the czech republic ? 
  alright , close enough i guess . 
  i 've recently moved to the czech republic , and everyone keeps misspelling the word ` coming ' as ` comming ' . 
  i 've never seen this mistake anywhere else before . 
  huh , if you do n't mind me asking : are you from cincinnati ? 
  alright , close enough i guess . 
  i 've recently moved to cincinnati , and everyone keeps expressing their astonishment at the czech ` comming ' story . 
  i 've never had this reaction anywhere else before . 
  man , i 'm really sorry about these jerks , i totally understand what you 're doing and am dumbfounded at how they can not fathom it . 
  as if none of them ever got into an android vs. ios type discussion . 
  why the hell would you get upvoted , and why is the reply from op downvoted ? 
  you 're just bullying op for no reason whatsoever . 
  have you never had an urge to correct people who are incorrect about something you like ? 
  even if not , can you really not imagine that there is a person on earth who is willing to spend their time doing just that ? 
  why does everyone have to be so hostile in this thread ? 
   level of discourse, 
  funny , now that you mention this , almost all retorts against op contained the cheap joke of repeating something from op 's comment . 
  like the ' ( gasp ! ) ', 
  and the ` haha xd ' thing . 
  ... what ? 
  how would you even get to that conclusion ?

   why did n't they take the time left to decide winners, 
  cause that would heavily incentivize players to favor rush strats in the main rounds , and blizzard does n't want the meta to be like that . 
  damn right !, 
  he also had two regular talks -- at one of them he was presenting his work on a certain thing [ ( pretty technical description here ) ] ( https://lwn.net/articles/689548/ ) that basically no one dared to even try to do since the last substantial ( and failed ) attempt around 10-15 years ago . 
  it ended up becoming one of the ... eh , _ the _ main talking point amongst the audience for the rest of the conference , and i think ( keynotes excluded ) that was the talk with the highest attendance . 
  he gathered quite a following afterwards as well , with a bunch of developers joining him to work on this thing . 
  delighted to hear that , you 're very welcome !, 
  for some reason i get dropped back to the shopping cart page though after entering my billing address :(, 
  it keeps dropping me back to the shopping cart page after entering my billing address :(, 
  it keeps dropping me back to the shopping cart page after entering my billing address :(, 
  sc up as well now !, 
  i bought an sc instead , that worked , fyi . 
   so difficult to meet the requirements for that group ( 85 removed games ) ... 
  well , are you actually collecting removed games ? 
  i have 22 apparently and i did n't even know any of them were removed . 
  it would make sense for a collectors ' group to only accept people who ... collect . 
  that 's absolutely your fault . 
  exactly , they 're trying to keep this group open only for people who are actively buying removed games , which makes perfect sense . 
  actually , he 's a rather accomplished software engineer and i 'm sure his day job and place in the community nets him more than enough attention for him to be desparate for more . 
  do you have any reason to believe grindr does not actually delete deleted user accounts ? 
  the fact that some ( or even if you believe most ) services do n't does not prove anything .

  or perhaps they were inspired by stan 's jacket in monkey island . 
  i was about to invest on wefunder , but decided to first search reddit for any discussion about the company . 
  i ended up finding your two comments . 
  the fact that you registered new accounts only to chime in in legion m threads with obviously fake comments makes me wonder if the company really has an idea about how to work with a community . 
  needless to say , i decided against investing . 
  [ coala ] ( https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala ) has a very active and welcoming developer community . 
  the project is really easy to work with due to it having very good test coverage - you do n't need to worry about breaking anything , because you can just run the tests yourself and have the computer check if everything is still working correctly . 
  also , the team members are very strict about coding style and standards , which is a good thing , since thorough code reviews are one of the best ways to learn . 
  and if that was n't enough , they 're specifically keeping a list of tasks that they are saving for newcomers , which should make it really easy to get into contributing . 
  also , ceos of successful companies tend to not take too much money out of their company in the form of salary . 
  stock options and other alternative forms of compensation can amount to a way higher income , and having a reasonable , low salary can help with popularity . 
  some ceos actually made a sort of a publicity stunt out of having an annual salary in the $ 1 - $ 10 range ( not a typo ) . 
  i would assume this is also helps lower taxes a bit . 
  founders probably also make better ceos than ceos brought in to fix a company . 
  your comment is relevant for companies that have trouble taking off . 
  i doubt op 's article included non-established companies in the data . 
  now who in their right mind would do that ? 
  i can do this for you , with no need for the extra 200 czk . 
  email me the details at bence@underyx.me - my whole life is linked to and from the https://underyx.me domain , so that should be enough to give you peace of mind that i wo n't just run off with the money . 
  and by the way , the title makes it sound like you 're asking for 200 czk :d, 
  edit : oh , and if you could pay me in bitcoin , it 'd be way more convenient for me , but do n't worry about it too much . 
  i live in czechia and love the fact that i do n't have deal with the awkwardness of using a multi-word formal name anymore whenever i tell people this .
