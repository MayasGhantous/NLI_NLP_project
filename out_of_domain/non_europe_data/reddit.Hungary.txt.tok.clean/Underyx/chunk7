  can be interpreted as :, 
   ask me anything !, 
  and i asked you something . 
  chrome has a pdf reader , but that does n't make it not lightweight . 
  a pdf reader is not necessarily as `` heavyweight '' as adobe reader . 
  and while we are at it , opera has an irc client , a bittorrent client , an e-mail client , an rss reader , and lots of other extra features . 
  liar . 
  you ca n't possibly be the pope . 
  * it 's fading ... *, 
  tf2 is fine too . 
  star wars ? 
  the movie where those three magician students save the world from some dark lord ? 
  also , what 's the v-dock mentioned in the filename ? 
  ( reserving this space to edit in a link of the original source of the picture once i find it ), 
  edit : according to argon317 's [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fejp1/ye_olde_tron/c1fbt8m ) , this is the [ source ] ( http://shirt.woot.com/friends.aspx?k=17115 ) . 
  do you mean the manual username tagger ? 
  no , i mean every single commenter who has commented in a subthread at least twice should get a temporary colour . 
  so your reply to this comment of mine would have the same colour as the one above mine . 
  i was thinking about maybe a line on the left side of the comments around 3 pixels wide with a certain colour . 
  yes , but that 's not username dependent , it only helps readability by alternating the two possible colours , so in this case, 
  xcommenter ( white background ), 
  ycommenter ( blue background ), 
  zcommenter ( white background ), 
  xcommenter ( blue background ), 
  sit, 
  xcommenter would get two different colours . 
  this colouring the background is also very subtle , in my opinion . 
  also :, 
   ninjaedit : i think that in large threads it will be a clusterfuck of colors . 
  or not enough colors . 
  since only people who have replied at least twice to a certain subthread ( not a whole comment thread ) would get colours , i think that would n't be a problem . 
  of course this might be a really obscure feature , only be useful to a few people , and not worth the effort to code it . 
  but would it be possible with only a single subthread ? 
  let 's say the top subthread in a popular submission has around 50 replies . 
  45 of them left only a single comment . 
  so you need 5 colours . 
  in extreme cases it would be around 10 , i think . 
  legibility would not be affected if the comments would be marked at the border of the text . 
  i was thinking about marking them like how the different difficulties are coloured [ here ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/obtaining_medic_achievements ) ( disregard the background colours , they are unneeded ) . 
  in my opinion colours on the borders are easy to follow , yet they are non-intrusive . 
  of course , as i wrote above , this might be an absolutely unneeded thing , and writing the code for it would be a total waste of time . 
  edit : [ a quick drawing of how it could work here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a2539.png ) note that since you only replied once , you do n't have a colour . 
  sorry , mate . 
  sorry , i have n't seen it before . 
  game linking 101 : do n't ask people to do something , that makes it seem like it 's for your own good . 
  if you say `` look , there is this awesome lightcycle game you 'll love '' , people will think `` thanks dude , i did n't know that game ! '', 
  and they 'll give you karma . 
  good . 
  me neither . 
  it 's not karma whoring , it 's getting your point across . 
  i played armagetron for around a week a while ago , but i refused to `` play pro '' , so i did n't have multiple keys assigned to turning , et cetera . 
  i was damn proud when i took out 4 pros in a row just because of my noobish randomness . 
  game linking 102 : once a post has reached the age of 5 hours , you go find another one , and comment there . 
  that 's nice to know , thanks . 
  not like everything should make perfect sense in an alternate world simulated by a computer , but thanks anyway :d, 
  am i the only one who thought the kids were the ones who were caught sleeping with a prostitute ? 
  hah , reminds me of [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bfikg/a_new_way_of_sql_injection_pic/ ), 
  because you sound like a little baby . 
  i did n't see it , i sorry !, 
  and subreddit, 
  yeah , thanks , but i meant live tv . 
  but that 's not free :(, 
  a waterboarding gone how wrong ? 
  alright , i think i 'll believe you :p, 
  you know , i thought there 's this whole interwebs thing , and maybe , just maybe , someone would be kind enough to stream some ` vision for us , unamericans . 
  [ but let 's see what a horrible person this glueboy guy is !, 
  i read that with a german accent . 
  i am honored . 
  is that jing ? 
  good to see i 'm not the only one who uses it . 
   so many massive fans . 
  like a certain mummra ? 
  i 'm sorry , but my honored meter just went skyrocketing due to you actually lol ` ing at my submission , and i do believe it has surpassed that of yours by far . 
  sorry , i have n't seen one before . 
  could you please give me a link to one ? 
  well , `` great minds think alike '' , right ? 
  your frame is curv, 
  that was , like , a freaking thunderstorm , not just a simple whoosh . 
  also this [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zshdzjnd-4i#t=1m26s ) , ( probably ) accidentally hidden after the words `` dip pen '' . 
  this makes me wonder how many of the people who cake comments like this actually do ctrl-f the subject . 
  edit : what . 
  why the hell did i type cake ? 
  [ ] ( / omg `` yes i mad '' ), 
  i , as a hungarian , disapprove of this pun . 
  for god 's sake , every single time i mention i 'm from hungary the response is `` oh . 
  are you hungry ? 
  hahahaha ! '' . 
  it 's not funny the hundredth time , guys !, 
  ( oh , and on another note , hungary is not close to neither turkey , nor greece . ), 
  and there we have the result !, 
  it 's a troll . 
  god , would you please stop using that unmaintaned , ad-infested www.tf2wiki.net , which has an admin who does n't even care about the game at all , but only runs it for profit ? 
  [ there 's an official wiki . 
  ] ( http://wiki.tf2.com ), 
  kind of . 
  the same editors migrated over to the official one , basically bringing their own content to it . 
  also , tf2wiki.net is [ almost not moderated at all ] ( http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/cumstained_ushanka ) , and generally way lower quality than the official one : for example the table of pyro hats as seen on [tfwiki.net ] ( http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/pyro#hats ) , and as seen on [ wiki.tf2.com ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/pyro#hats ) . 
  edit : oh , and number of articles on tfwiki.net : almost 2000,
