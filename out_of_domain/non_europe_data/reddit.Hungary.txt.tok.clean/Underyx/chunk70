  goddamn reposts . 
  i disagree . 
  i can be done with a newsletter with just having a glance at the sender . 
  tried this just now , gtx 1080 , did not help at all . 
   something like 98 % of the player can play the game perfectly, 
  where the hell did you get this number from ? 
   99 % appear to be up and running on our servers, 
  this means that 99 % of players are connected to the servers , it does n't say anything about whether the game is actually working for them . 
  this also does n't include the players who are getting crashes . 
  also , there 's 190k players in-game now . 
  sure this number should be growing if issues were that rare . 
  applause to the chrome team !, 
  this seems like the best possible solution . 
  got rid of an annoying feature , managed to resist making chrome more complex , and still provided a way for the few people who want to keep using the feature to turn it back on . 
  i do n't know of a lot of product teams who would check all three boxes . 
  but also , a lone dude voting for the better candidate , or the lone family that recycles does n't make a difference either . 
  i think you got downvoted here because you were arguing against your strawman , not the comment you replied to . 
  if he was anything like me , it went more like, 
  getting nervous . 
  oh god , there are so many people !, 
  wait , it 's over ? 
  name one manufacturer who does n't already provide updates ` up to 24 months ' as the op says . 
  i 'm at the final boss of ** paper mario : ttyd ** right now and i can already feel that empty feeling coming up that will settle in once i 'm finished with it and am saying goodbye to the charming world and loveable characters of the game . 
  what should i move on to ? 
  i feel like the sort of quirky and sometimes meta humour is a huge part of why i enjoyed ** ttyd ** , which is the same reason i loved ** undertale ** . 
  related to this , i loved the part where [ premise of chapter 3 ] ( #s `` i got to work my way up the rankings in the fighting ring '' ) cause it introduced totally new rules and a different frame to the game . 
  i might be looking for something like this . 
  other , optional qualities in the game i 'm looking for are :, 
  - long main storyline, 
  - upbeat atmosphere, 
  - couch-playable, 
  - not too difficult, 
  also , probably way too much information for this thread , but i 'm tracking games i 'm interested in/have finished/etc . 
  here : http://trello.com/b/62mkue3x/games, 
   i thought dh was some sort of money laundering operation, 
  how could they possibly launder money selling digital goods online ? 
  but as far as i can tell they were only distributing via itch.io and steam , which should result in just a few regular lump payments . 
  deleted comment by / u/apeacefulwarrior :, 
   `` for awhile , i thought ... '' why are we arguing about this ? 
  because i was wondering if there was something i did n't know about that would make it a reasonable assumption that it 's a money laundering operation . 
  i decided to reply to convey that contrary to how you might have been thinking i was ` arguing ' just to point out your error , i was actually seeking to be proven wrong to learn more about the topic . 
  you mean something like, 
   how could they possibly launder money selling digital goods online ? 
  perhaps ? 
  you actually have more than one already . 
  just switch to the discover tab and you 'll see [ all these different sections ] ( https://i.underyx.me/2016-09-20t20-32-28z.2ltuy.png ) , each based on a genre/group of artists . 
  this is the exact same thing as discover weekly , just presented in a different format . 
  yeah , but the question was _ why _ ? 
  even if from an economic standpoint it could make sense , you could also take morality into account . 
  i disagree . 
  that 's not what the original purchaser agrees to when buying the key . 
   i can never get the uninstall command right the first time . 
  how do you manage to do that ? 
  i 'm fairly sure that you can run just either ` brew remove package ` or ` brew uninstall package ` : /, 
  to them i would respond that the free market is supposed to balance itself out ( as it already is sort of doing with linux being a viable alternative as an os ) and to keep society afloat we need to abide by the rules even when it feels unfair . 
  i feel like for most people going with linux instead would only be a minor inconvenience and that they do not deserve to ignore the rules for such a marginal gain in quality of life/comfort . 
  for context , i use macos on my work laptop , use linux as my main os on my pc at home , and i own a windows 10 license . 
  i do n't get that criticism at all . 
  a mishmash of syntaxes ? 
  let 's ignore that this is not actually called a syntax , but even then , how is this any different from any other package manager ? 
  it 's 2016 , use docker . 
  i do , which is why contrary to you , i did n't actually make generalizations that ` the entire software industry ' is doing something . 
  the cross section of companies where docker is not being adopted and that are n't so enterprise that they 're locked in to microsoft technology already anyway must be smaller than you make it sound like . 
  wow , i was very skeptical when opening the comments here , wondering what someone could possibly add to this , but this is actually something that i 'm glad was said . 
  your country is fucked , y' all . 
  seriously , a 28.6 % chance for a trump win is the closest i 've seen said . 
  it does n't sound too undemocratic to not give a group more voting power even if they voted to get it . 
  elections are not statistical evidence of how ` good ' any one person is . 
  nope , does n't sound like it :(, 
  thanks for the guess anyway :d, 
  yes yes yes !, 
  that 's it , thanks < 3, 
  how about ` basics ' ? 
  source ? 
  as / u/mynsfwacctlol beautifully put it in / r/trackers :, 
   i ca n't really begin to explain how much of a loss this is . 
   this was the biggest digital repository of music the world has ever seen . 
  spotify , itunes , even oink in its prime were kittens to what what.cd built . 
   i made this analogy in another thread , but it was the digital library of alexandria for music . 
   it inspired me to learn about audio engineering , learn how to program , and most importantly , introduced me to music that changed me in ways i ca n't even begin to put into one tiny little box . 
  [ ( source ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/5did4f/its_official_whatcd_is_dead_memorial_thread/da4r2by/ ), 
   1 ) why are n't user data and user-created content separated ? 
  if they are , why did they delete both , and not only the former ? 
  it takes effort to separate them . 
  the podcast 99 % invisible ran a great episode on this called [ unpleasant design & hostile urban architecture ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unpleasant-design-hostile-urban-architecture/ ) . 
   some businesses play classical music as a deterrent , on the theory that kids do n't want to hang out or talk over it .
