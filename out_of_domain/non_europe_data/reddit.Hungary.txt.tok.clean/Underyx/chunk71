  other sound-based strategies include the use of high-frequency sonic buzz generatorsmeant to be audible only to young people . 
  housing estates in the uk have also put up pink lighting , aimed to highlight teenage blemishes . 
  in many cases , there is little data to show how well these more unconventional strategies actually work . 
  it 's down , must have been a mistake . 
  it was a historical low : https://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/info?plain=dirtrally, 
  why do people enjoy things that i do n't ? 
  i understand that it seems like a waste of money and resources , but you 're being just really unnecessarily hostile to me :(, 
  cool , so it 's already 95 % complete ? 
  it actually requires two friends to * pay * . 
  make sure to pay for two separate vm software licenses as well so that you have further proof that it 's actually two people . 
   mark zuckerberg : facebook had literally no effect on the election . 
  i think he only said that fake news on facebook had no effect . 
  come on . 
  * ` facebook is a huge influencer ' * can be a valid statement even if facebook is not able to convert democrats to republicans or vice versa . 
  * ` same thing . 
  either the content on facebook impacts people or it does n't . 
  ' * such a false dichotomy . 
  how about neither of those absolutes ? 
  it 's possible that fake news does not affect the elections while their ` get out the vote ' messages demonstrably do . 
  [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 ), 
  none of this gives you , commenters , the right to just misrepresent zuckerberg 's / facebook 's statements . 
  it was google , they had a daily challenge i think . 
  this model has no front edge though if i recall correctly . 
  no , they were just that nice to each other . 
  yay , so that probably means the end of that awkward mascot , cid , as well !, 
  how do you decide what the time limit should be ? 
   just have an automated build system, 
  those are exactly the resources they lack . 
  that , and hosting the images . 
  well of course the problem is not as much _ having _ that build system as it is _ running _ it . 
  i 'm very skeptical that any provider would just give away 540 cpu hours per day ( that 's 80 minutes per 403 devices ) to them . 
  ` get hosting and running for free ' works for open source projects when they 're a few thousand line long python libraries , built every few weeks when someone commits , but there 's always a disclaimer with usage limits . 
  source code hosting and building images are very different and the benefit for providing it for free to oss is not the same . 
  the case you linked was about an issue about how github * was n't able to keep providing the service for free * . 
  see the resolution of this issue , [ cocoapods ended up having to largely reduce their usage of github ] ( http://blog.cocoapods.org/master-spec-repo-rate-limiting-post-mortem/ ) . 
  in this case github is saying that 5 cpus were in full use for this project , which had to be changed . 
  at  540 hours per day , lineageos would need to use at least 22 cpus concurrently . 
  oh , i thought you linked that because of the fact that github did n't shut them down . 
  my bad . 
  they do n't have usage limits right now for ci but they 're going to introduce them soon , for everyone . 
  lineageos would almost certainly be nicely asked to stop building all those nightlies , and the introduction of the limits might be expedited . 
  just me for now . 
  i 'm part of the coala.io maintainer team , we have a friend at gl and we 're planning to move there from gh . 
  that friend brought it up in our gitter.im chatroom when discussing/planning the move . 
  i have no patience to find the specific lines of discussion , it was at least a month ago . 
  sorry , i bought the square enix christmas bundle as well :d, 
  hm , company of heroes 2 for mini metro sounds okay , but that 's the only trade i see working out . 
  deal ? 
  no worries , i have everything interesting from that list though already . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  nope , sorry . 
  sure , if i count with the all-time low prices according to itad :, 
  - rust : 6.45 eur, 
  so around 27 eur . 
  how about [ stephen 's sausage roll ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/353540 ) + [ card city nights ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/271820 ) as gifts which are ~ 26 eur ? 
  no worries , alright . 
  the only one i 'm interested in is remember me but it seems less valuable than either of my three , so i 'll hold out for something better :(, 
  alright , how about jackbox 2 + stardew for witcher 3 ? 
  that 's alright . 
  i 'm also interested in hyper light drifter . 
  in the meantime i 've also wrote up a full list here : https://barter.vg/u/1e99/t/, 
  would you mind picking whatever would make hyper light drifter and/or witcher 3 work for you ? 
  traded with / u/kbragg87, 
  my jackbox party pack 2 + rust + stardew valley, 
  for their hyper light drifter + d4, 
  i went first, 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/5kkcg3/h_stardew_valley_jackbox_party_pack_2_skullgirls/dbopips/, 
  can you link a source for that quote ? 
  thanks . 
  that quote does n't appear though anywhere here so i 'll just assume it 's fake . 
  the actual announcement really is phrased in a way that could sort of be taken the wrong way , but there 's no telling whether it 's due to maliciously cautious wording , or just a plain old poor choice of words . 
  that seems to me exactly the same as on the archive.is link . 
  but that 's completely different , so i guess / u/audiorejectz was full of shit up there with this quote . 
  paraphrasing would be acceptable but they made it sound worse , and then complained specifically about the phrasing with ' [ this ] dosnt sound like [ ... ] ' . 
  are we really taking ` best use of a farm animal ' this seriously ? 
  yeah , i do n't have an issue with taking the award seriously . 
  but the category ? 
  come on , it 's completely random . 
  ah , there it is , i did n't notice that . 
  well that was totally unfair cause this year i finally really was the better underyx :(, 
  how is that ` being good at pattern recognition ' ? 
  if i diagnosed every single person with cancer i would n't call myself ` too good of a doctor ' . 
  that 's not marketing talk . 
  it 's closer to how someone with a good understanding of the economy talks , which i do n't think is true for most in marketing . 
  no , it 's all the internet 's fault . 
  should n't this resistance you 're speaking of be visible in the order book ? 
  i do n't really see anything at $ 1163 [ on gdax ] ( https://i.underyx.me/2017-01-04t18-55-36.bkqth.png ) . 
  i think [ airbitz ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbitz&amp;hl=en ) is pretty good . 
   consistent ? 
  it 's not as if people have iphones and androids at the same time . 
  those are not the whole world you know . 
  i use play.spotify.com , a windows pc , a macbook , and an android phone . 
  spotify 's design is consistent across all four and i could n't be happier about that . 
  by now , i 'm used to redditors not reading the article and jumping straight to the comments , but people not even reading the title is new to me . 
  you ca n't edit post titles on reddit . 
  confirmed !, 
  but the mechanics themselves are not really new though . 
   okay , this might be biased, 
  why are you biased ? 
  when people are , they usually share the reason for context .
