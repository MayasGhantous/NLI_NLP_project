  well that 's not bias , that 's just your opinion then . 
  hm , unlikely , but is there something wrong specifically with my setup then ? 
  i have [ blue for visited and dark purple for unvisited ] ( https://i.underyx.me/2017-01-15t10-59-47.ascxr.png ) . 
  compare the same posts with styling off [ which has the opposite color scheme ] ( https://i.underyx.me/2017-01-15t11-01-19.qei7x.png ) . 
  well , i do n't see it like that . 
  must be my colorblindness . 
  i guess i 'll have keep subreddit styling disabled :(, 
  you 'll still have to pay your home country 's vat on it which is what 's bumping it over 300 euros in the first place . 
  does that actually make them worse than the switch ? 
  see ? 
  it only matters, 
   if you want a new console that can be portable with great exclusives, 
  how do you recommend getting into the series for those without a 3ds ? 
  where do you think the money you ` save ' comes from when you help people buy an erroneously priced ticket ? 
  is this not reflected in the airlines ' later pricing , making other tickets more expensive ? 
  game developers seem to be patching denuvo out around 6-12 months after release , though . 
  i bought a 240 gb ocz vector 150 back in 2014 for my gaming pc , and it died a month ago . 
  i 've rma 'd it and was given a 240 gb toshiba ocz tl100 as a replacement . 
  as far as i can tell from online benchmarks this is a huge downgrade . 
  ( i have n't had a chance to actually try it out yet . ), 
  is my assumption correct ? 
  can i do anything about it ? 
  ( if that 's relevant , the retailer is in hungary . ), 
  and even that was a blatant lie . 
  the same setup was used in 2013 . 
  these pages are just their blogging platform . 
  it 's not journalism . 
   far preferable to tis-100 for a variety of reasons . 
  unless you 're a software engineer . 
  well , i had fun with it . 
  it 's an assembly language that 's specifically designed to be fun to work with . 
  well that 's not what i was looking for though . 
  i played through human resource machine but it just felt a bit boring and shallow to me . 
  tis-100 on the other hand had amazing puzzles that really made me think , and the whole backstory with the fictitious assembly language was just awesome . 
  anyway , i 'm not saying that tis-100 is absolutely , objectively better , or anything . 
  it 's just that human resource machine is not ` far preferable ' . 
  there was a pretty funny comment by an ` oblivious ' commenter who had thought trump had been promising a muslim * band * all along . 
  edit : oh , and it was followed up by band names puns , most of which could 've been considered offensive . 
  also , android wo n't autoopen the login pages of public wifi networks .

  most players around that level are not miracle or anyone you 'd recognize . 
  you might think that but i assure you you 'd get bored of it quick . 
  and even then , this would just split the matchmaking queues into half again , causing even higher queue times . 
  well , that 's not really new at all . 
  i 'm pretty sure anti-tamper refers to the way they 're trying to prevent people from patching all of this logic out , bypassing the check for an auth ticket . 
  what pr disaster ? 
  i only ever saw / r/games complaining . 
  * bourbon, 
   denuvo ca n't even secure their own website ? 
  huh ? 
  are they known for not being able to secure things ? 
  but they 're still the best in the market , right ? 
  thanks for doing this < 3, 
  sure , but they had no reason to . 
  we will once otas actually start rolling out ( :, 
  yep , we will do that , once the first otas are released . 
  most likely he was posting tons of legit articles to build up positive karma , to make him look like less of a spammer . 
  one of them ended up _ really _ hitting the spot for / r/politics readers . 
  hey , / u/googleandroidwearcm , just one note for later : reddit automatically marks comments and posts that use url shorteners as spam , so all four of your comments which linked through goo.gl were invisible to everyone else until now ( i 've manually approved them . ), 
  especially since these codes are all nintendo 's , so then it would be a nintendo nnx-001 , or ` nintendo nintendo nintendo x ' . 
  for god 's sake , you 're such a sick human being . 
  it 's spelled ` wasting ' !, 
  nope , just no tests . 
  i just found this post after searching for mentions of kiwi.com , the company i work at . 
  just fyi , we do protect connection flights we sell , see here : https://www.kiwi.com/en/pages/guarantee, 
  but no one 's interested in it . 
  ~ ~ also , you spelled saturo wrong . ~ ~, 
  huh , i had a complete berenst\u00e6in bears moment here . 
  sorry about that . 
   but nintendo is very conservative when it comes to loss leading . 
  they 've apparently never sold a system at a loss . 
  i believe when they dropped the price of the 3ds they said it 'd take a year or so of manufacturing pipeline optimizations until they could be selling at a profit . 
  sorry , i was n't that interested in the game so i never actually tracked down the source before parroting this rumor . 
  now after a bit of searching around , all i could find is a few mentions of this on reddit and neogaf . 
  accidental ad clicks however are way less profitable . 
  good news !,
