  i ca n't believe they did n't realize that the christian moms facebook page is satire . 
  no , it 's simply just a satire page . 
  okay . 
  whoaaa , i recognize that username , you 're the guy from that new year 's mario marathon stream by monotonetim like 5 years ago :o, 
  honestly , probably not , there were thousands of names there , and i was n't saying the most memorable things anyway . 
  i did stick around for basically the whole stream though . 
  though i do have a slight hunch they intentionally acted naive just to have more/better content for the video . 
  if i remember correctly they dug out some pretty old post to highlight , and they ca n't get that far without realizing it 's a bunch of college kids making fun of people . 
  huh , last time i checked they only had ~ ~ 5 ~ ~ 7 !, 
  edit : fuck me , i do n't know how i ended up writing five . 
  i do n't like the other answers . 
  basically it 's all about just having demand for it . 
  if you make origami swans and people pay you for them , you basically have the equivalent of a currency already . 
  they could theoretically go to each other and hand over 10 swans for a slice of pizza , or similar . 
  so , about the question of how people start viewing these things as something with real value : in most cases , with national currencies , it stems from the government backing it . 
  it 's very convenient for citizens of a nation to use their national currency , so you can be fairly certain the currency will be used and is a reasonable investment right from the moment a government announces it . 
  in the case of bitcoin , interest was driven by the technological innovation . 
  for some people it was more convenient to use bitcoin than cash , some found it to be a nice way to safeguard money , and others predicted that more people will want to use it later . 
  if people will want to use it later , and you know about this now , you can purchase some bitcoin and then sell it later at a higher price to those who want to use it . 
  these speculators then just swarm the market , until the currency is mostly just them trading it at varying prices , trying to predict how many other speculators and users will want to get in on bitcoin in the future . 
  and ` digital exploration of interior design ' is not referring to the pillow/blanket fort , but to the other subplot of the episode , with ` digital ' meant to be read as its ` with fingers ' definition . 
  my comment was more about the eloquence with which t_d users typically argue this point . 
  the point itself is pretty obvious and not very debateable . 
  well , i do n't think it 's working . 
  to me , it just looks mean-spirited and stupid .

  actually op made this post to spam their website . 
  why , people ? 
  this feels so pointless . 
  no one will even remember in two days . 
   what is wrong with asking why the charity sets rules for the hats people wear ? 
  that 's not what you asked , you asked * why they can * set these rules instead of * why they do * . 
  actually / u/aka _ wildcard is also active , handling most mod mail , and often clearing up the moderation queue . 
  / u/zeroshift also handles a considerable part of the mod queue . 
  no they 're geraffes . 
  there is strength in polyglotism for just the sake of it . 
  a whole industry not focused on one kind of programming will be more resilient to changes , just like a species with a diverse gene pool will be more likely to survive a virus . 
  c does n't really have error messages . 
  your code either does n't even compile or it just crashes at runtime . 
  also , banks would n't use c anyway . 
  but those are no more error messages of c than any first party error message would be . 
  or private ( named something like ` < name  / < feature  ` ) branches, 
  here 's a friendly request that you stop using all caps in your post titles . 
  other users of the subreddit find this behavior rather annoying . 
  thanks !, 
  but is a typical line of code written or read more times ? 
  alright , sure , me too . 
  most likely they just misread that comment . 
  it 's funny , sure , but definitely not worthy of being condescending about . 
  hey , i work at kiwi.com , and just thought i 'd mention that our site might show you some combinations you wo n't find elsewhere since we offer tickets with non-allied airlines ' segments combined . 
  that 's usually helps a lot with intercontinental travel . 
   and in fact when i decided to just do it ( fire comey ) , i said to myself , i said you know , this whole russia thing with trump and russia is a made up story . 
  i think this is not an admission of what you 're positing at all , quite the opposite . 
  to me , it sounds like he was trying to say something like :, 
   i was always planning to fire comey , but was hesitant cause of the russia story and how bad it would 've looked . 
  but then i thought , whatever , it 's all made up anyway so i do n't care . 
  and for these minor annoyances , the upside is ... nothing . 
  actually , it seems like you 're wrong . 
  reddit post vote progression is surprisingly linear . 
  see this chart of an absolutely non-political ( i.e. 
  non-manipulated ) post 's vote history : https://i.redd.it/f32n42qf2lpy.gif, 
  it also showcases the same sudden drop that you are assuming to be the bot being turned off .

  [ less so than you 'd expect .
