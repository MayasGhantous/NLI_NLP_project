  typo , right ? 
  i do n't think there really are much better options ( we all use pycharm or a regular text editor at my company ) but the following exist :, 
  - [ wing ] ( http://wingware.com/ ) -- they 're python specific , but i never even saw a reason to try it out, 
  - [ visual studio ] ( https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/ ) -- microsoft 's huuuuge ide , designed mainly for other , more enterprise-y languages , but seems to be catching up on python as well recently . 
  not too impressed though . 
  - [ visual studio code ] ( https://code.visualstudio.com/ ) -- a lightweight text editor that has powerful tools ( including an integrated debugger ) regardless , and is under very swift development . 
  i 'm actually seeing myself use it fairly often even on large projects . 
  - with the proper configuration/plugins , you can be pretty productive with any other reasonable text editor : atom and sublime text , or if you 're more adventurous , vim and emacs . 
  ooh , i see , thanks !, 
   android works just fine without them so why not ? 
  that argument is like saying ` the screen works fine without android , so why not keep only the bootloader ? ', 
  you were just drawing that line of what 's useful enough at an arbitrary point with no explanation . 
  i 'd consider both arguments just as bad as the other . 
  yeah , they added some shadows and pretty colors . 
  everything else is as bad as before . 
  i said ` they ' since i did n't know the dev 's gender . 
  either way , lack of resources does n't give someone immunity from criticism of the product they 're selling . 
  pochinki, 
  [ clueyness ] ( http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/05/clueyness-a-weird-kind-of-sad.html ) is a word that describes something like this pain . 
  the wording sounds silly , but i guess the above commenter 's point was that the incentive is to make one good game that sells well , instead of a hundred crap titles that net $ 200 each . 
  seems like most people actually do n't understand why they themselves hate it . 
  it 's because they added a blogging platform on forbes.com . 
  they let practically anyone publish their own blog there . 
  when you do that , you end up with crap blog posts -- these posts get shared cause of their low quality or polarized views , and people on reddit think that forbes wrote them , so they hate on forbes , which is sorta like saying reddit is stupid because of a post of one user . 
   there, 
  where ? 
  it 's not about lying . 
  they were probably just less likely to stop and respond to pollsters . 
  hey , that was useful :(, 
  yesss , finally something that made this worth watching . 
  i mean the switch that has fun games instead of cinematic ones . 
  except that it 's fun to get excited . 
  phrasing it like a law of physics sounds cute , but it does n't make this true . 
  nope , they only said ` world premiere ' before that one . 
  maplehamwich does n't have all day for this crap , microsoft should 've went for the quick pitch . 
  i would n't normally feed you , but a comparison of the wii u 's and the switch 's reception is evidence that pretty directly contradicts your premise . 
  while everyone is distracted , they also sneakily uploaded a [ sonic forces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tdmlxn99p4 ) trailer . 
  while everyone is distracted , they also sneakily uploaded a [ sonic forces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tdmlxn99p4 ) trailer . 
  because they showed the copyright notices for the entire 25 minute segment after the mario trailer . 
  the unreal notice was probably there cause of rocket league . 
  there were only 22 seconds of content at the end that he could n't have recorded before the announcement . 
  it 's not * that * impressive . 
  well , maybe this one was less memorable ? 
  is that somehow out of the question ? 
   you 'd expect if you were buying the rom and emulator from nintendo you 'd be getting the game they originally sold on their hardware not some randomly dumped rom . 
  in actuality though , i , along with i bet at least 99 % of players , would not care _ at all _ if all bits in memory were matching the original . 
  i 'd be much more focused on the game . 
  i think you 're not really making an effort to try and imagine how sessions would 've felt if that really was a casual encounter . 
  or vastly overestimating the human mind . 
  can you list the last three times you had oatmeal ? 
  but this time the ip is way more valuable than when the first game came out . 
  and there 's also justification for including that in the price ; the developers most likely had to pay a hefty licensing fee to be able to release the game . 
  other than the publicly cited reasons , i would n't be surprised if they wanted to use a different engine that is easier to work with to cost them less man-hours . 
  nice , you 're getting upvoted and do n't even need to argue with people who do n't believe this , [ unlike me at release ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch/comments/5xbe5a/slug/deh6353 ) . 
  this has been bothering me ever since . 
  so how do you imagine data stored in the pagefile is addressed ? 
  / r/tipofmytongue, 
   hella expensive, 
  oh man , are they cereal ? 
  `` we 're deeply concerned about this . '', 
  yep, 
  ** device information : **, 
  relay version : 8.2.55, 
  phone : oneplus a0001 ( oneplus one ), 
  android version : 7.1.2 ( 25 ), 
  device ( product ) : a0001 ( bacon ), 
  rom : bacon-userdebug 7.1.2 n2g47o efaef1ca37, 
  actually they have [ a blog post detailing exactly this ] ( https://labs.spotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/ ) , and how they ended up implementing that fake randomness . 
  do you have proof of that ? 
  do you think you have better data about oneplus 's customers than oneplus ? 
  but she speaks several other languages as well . 
  other people enjoy things different from what you do . 
  there 's no rational reason for it . 
  do n't try to understand why , just accept it . 
   flair request for [ u/polymute ] ( https://www.reddit.com/u/polymute ) : alternative facts, 
  he was jokingly suggesting that your writing does n't look like that of a beginner 's , so you must have had someone with better english skills type that if, 
   although a beginner at english, 
  really is true . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  you can hear that it did n't break yet . 
  i mean , this is n't the place to argue about this , but i find it unfathomable that you 'd be so into this idea that you 'd just bring it up as a comment on * this * post based solely on the connection of ` two options . ', 
  i guess people are just not used to this sort of design , so they 're calling it bad instead of stopping to think about it . 
  it makes it difficult to select an answer with only your keyboard , but that 's not such a big deal , and i doubt most upvoters even made this connection . 
  i thought so too , until i checked his comment history . 
  yeah , me too . 
  that crush really is something . 
  * you 're, 
  you should 've made mention of mimes to have a whole ` mi [ klmn ] e ` collection in your comment . 
  do n't you think it 's immoral to use google without giving them any data in return , if that 's their whole business model ? 
  i do n't know about the first part , but i do n't think i 'd ever consider `` it 's ethical if only a few of us are doing it . '', 
  a valid argument . 
  is that any different from `` yeah , i took the donut without paying full price , but i did leave a few cents there . 
  yes , i 'm obviously a google employee begging the five reddit users here who would care to hide their data to give us their search history . 
  and do you by any chance have a guess at what makes their ad system so valuable ? 
  3 years ? 
  that 's probably too much . 
  and lo , you still do n't feel the urge to provide the unit of measurement to make your comment anything other than 100 % pointless . 
  cause they 're making a point of coming up with these tricks to demonstrate how they use your data for nice things . 
  other than that they 're not too different from google , facebook , et cetera , they 're just more ... theatrical about it , so you do n't need to exercise your imagination to understand how it 's good for you when they have your data .
