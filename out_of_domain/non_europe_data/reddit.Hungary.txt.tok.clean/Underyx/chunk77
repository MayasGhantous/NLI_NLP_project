  sadly , almost no one actually does that . 
  ... which is also good for the users . 
  you 're going to see ads anyway . 
  might as well let them make them relevant ones so they can be useful to you . 
  pretty dishonest to compare at the end that zcash went for $ 4000 while bitcoin was at $ 1400 . 
  it peaked for just a tiny bit and dropped almost immediately to below $ 100 . 
  the value of one arbitrarily chosen unit does n't tell you anything about the value anyway . 
  there 's ten times less zcash than bitcoin in circulation , so if they were even just of equal value , zcash would have had to been priced at $ 14000 . 
  dumbass . 
  cool , i can call you that from now . 
  maybe he lays enigmas . 
  vox 's video [ cnn treats politics like sports -- and it 's making us all dumber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ps4x8hxq5c ) is super relevant here . 
   doubtful . 
  valve doesnt need to make money from their own games, 
  that 's not how a business works . 
   cs had been their most successful game/franchise until dota2 by far , and they still gave zero fucks . 
  ** that 's not how a business works . 
   its like they 're butthurt their most iconic success was n't made by them, 
  ** that 's not h **, 
  what are you trying to say with this ? 
   limit blue light exposure after sunset . 
  this is extremely important to regulate your melatonin levels . 
  if your melatonin is imbalanced you will not get a good night 's sleep and forcefully waking up will only harm your health . 
  you can also take melatonin pills . 
  see https://www.gwern.net/melatonin, 
  do you have any research that supports your statement ? 
  because i do have scientific evidence of the opposite , and i already linked the essay which links to my sources . 
  that will be way less helpful for people reading this comment in the future when un might also have died . 
  for your cake day , i 'll tell you : you 're right !, 
  i actually did n't agree with just saying un either , but i 'm sure it 's better than writing kim . 
  nope , sorry . 
  i guessed that as well , but apparently , you could n't shoot in his game . 
  and that came out recently , and as far as i know is n't downloadable . 
  wow , race the sun is this old ? 
  anyway , no , this could n't have been it . 
  omg it 's cool lady !, 
  hey , [ i 've got one from ti5 !, 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nuuwhda.jpg ) right on the second line . 
  did n't you ditch yourself ? 
  or am i misremembering ? 
  in czechia , i went to a gaming store to buy my switch on release day , right when they opened . 
  i ended up being the only person there , for the entire 10 minutes i spent . 
  he protec , he attac , he knack , but most importantly ... 
  what ? 
  * most importantly what ? 
  no , you 're alone . 
  i 'm just curious , which comment has the least points ? 
  deleted comments do n't count , of course . 
  i 've got to learn the names of more than 150 mountains/rivers/lakes ( combined ) in around a week . 
  how would you try to do it ? 
  edit : thanks for all the responses . 
  please note that i already have all the names written down , just need some smart method for learning them . 
  so , i 'm bored , and i 'm willing to answer a few questions in case anyone 's interested . 
  i thought i would give the new nfs game a shot . 
  it is *** horrible *** . 
  and what i mean by that is this :, 
  installation took 20 minutes . 
  oh well , let 's start it up !, 
  alright , the usual , ea logo ... criterion games logo ... electronic arts presents ... et cetera , et cetera , half a minute passes by . 
  i ` pressed any key to continue ' . 
  now a brief explanation of why the multiplayer features are so great , and i am prompted to log in/register . 
  alright , a minute passes by . 
  oh , an advertisement for the need for speed mmo game , nfs : world . 
  lots of text , i suppose i should read it . 
  stays there for half a minute . 
  huh , now it 's a trailer for nfs : shift 2 , the next game in the series . 
  mashing the keyboard buttons do n't do anything about it , so that 's another minute wasted . 
  and here comes an intro video to the menu . 
  thanks to it , now i know that the ` career ' option starts the career mode , and that selecting ` settings ' will take me to the settings !, 
  at least one more minute . 
  the only way to play is the career mode ( no quick race ) , so i will choose that . 
  here 's another video , showing me the ropes of the game mode ( like ` you get points and level up ' ) . 
  takes around two minutes, 
  yay , select level and car , at last !, 
  loading , loading , and i can start playing !, 
  hooray !, 
  of course , everything listed above is ** unskippable ** . 
  and loading takes ages too . 
  could you , ea , please try to stop this ? 
  ps : also , there 's no option to change the language . 
  i 'm now stuck with the ridiculous hungarian translation , because of my system region . 
  just in the intro videos there were three grammatical errors , not to mention the pathetic words they came up for ` bounty ' , and some other english expressions . 
  and it 's difficult to swap the language files , instead of a language code , they are now named ' 0001 . bndl ' , ' 0002 . bndl ' , ' 0003 . bndl ' and so on . 
  with all it 's sarah palins , glenn becks , foxes , and everything . 
  also , `` sarah palin is an idiot '' is not very helpful . 
  no , not like i have a girlfriend , just wondering ... 
  i tried to submit a link to a comment itself , but reddit would n't let me , since the blog post was already submitted , and the comment is on the same page . 
  the comment was written by [ tmcb ] ( http://disqus.com/tmcb/ ) , link to the comment thread itself [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/bqnwq ) . 
  so here it is :, 
   i have a pretty interesting idea . 
   maybe when a player dies , they 're forced into the body of a `` ghost '' player that can no longer interact with the world , but rather simply watch the living and chat with their fellow deceased friends . 
   then , at night ... the dead players inhabit the bodies of monsters . 
  creepers , skeletons , and zombies - now with the intellect of actual people . 
  minecraft suddenly becomes a dead versus living survival , the undead against the miners . 
   and then ... when the last player has been killed , the server begins anew and sends everyone to a loading screen . 
  a new world is started , the old one is removed , and everyone is back inside their blocky bodies to try and survive again . 
   of course , this whole thing could be completely optional . 
  i just think it would make being dead more fun , and it would make those who are remaining more on their toes . 
  oh no , my friend got killed ... which means he 's been forced into the army of the undead !, 
  and then imagine the other possibilities .
