  maybe your friend does n't want to be hostile , so you just end up with a friendly creeper following you around , maybe blowing himself up to clear away some of your less favorable friends . 
  would n't that be awesome ? 
  let 's say i decrypt a jpeg file . 
  the jpeg header is static , so i know part of the original file . 
  can the key be computed in any way if i try to derive the jpeg file header from the encrypted file ? 
  if no , can you please tell me why not ? 
  also , would this work with other popular encryption methods ? 
  ( sorry if this is a stupid question , i 'm no expert in cryptography . 
  even this idea was from a friend of mine . ), 
  my native language does n't address males and females with different words , so i , time to time , accidentally call girls a ` he ' , or the other way around , leading to awkward situations . 
  do you make this mistake too ? 
  for me , it is definitely buying team fortress 2 last halloween for $ 2.49, 
  i ended up having a playtime of 540 hours ( no idling ) , which means i paid less than a single cent for every two hours played . 
  and guys , it was *** fun *** . 
  what about you ? 
  for me , it 's 5939 visits in the past 3 months , with an average of 66 visits per day . 
  my most reddit-busy day was nov 27th , with 190 visits . 
  what about you ? 
  ( try the [ history trends ] ( http://goo.gl/nxeaz ) chrome extension to check the exact numbers ), 
  writing something here so i will be able to edit this later if necessary . 
  i received a copy from [ flamecurrent ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/flamecurrent ) just now , and i 'd like like to pass the fun on . 
  write a fun/insightful/awesome / etc. 
  comment , and the best one ( chosen by me ) will get flight control hd . 
  do n't forget to include your steam id !,

  just imagine it , redditors come and go , browsing reddit , lan parties , reddit , minecraft and tf2 posters all over the wall , 10 pizzas delivered every day , an awesome new year 's eve party , et cetera . 
  i reserved the subreddit / r/rhq , meaning ** r ** eddit ** h ** ead ** q ** uarters , in case there 's anyone who wants to organize this ( and i 'm sure that if this reaches the front page , there would be at least one person determined enough to do this ) :p, 
  i would probably ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i keep writing different things here and deleting them right away , thinking `` ah , that 's stupid '' . 
  edit : i just realized that without bacteria , food would n't spoil . 
  or am i wrong ?

  you could do anything : read other people 's thought , modify them , slap your boss and then rewind time , * anything * . 
  edit : i would fix the typo in the title of this submission without deleting it .

  ... i 've really liked team fortress 2 , i have 550 hours of tf2 playtime , but it suddenly just got boring . 
  i 've played cs : s with a steam guest pass , but it seemed too repetitive to me , with not enough difference between rounds . 
  it 's also full of camping , which i hate . 
  i 've also played cod : mw2 during steam free weekends , and i hate that game . 
  no teamwork , campers always win , and when encountering an enemy there is absolutely no skill needed , the player who sees the other one first kills , it 's purely luck . 
  so , based on these opinions of mine , do you think i would enjoy bad company 2 ? 
  ** mkm : ** i 'm travelling on the bus , a couple standing next to me, 
  ** mkm : ** the guy does n't say a word , but his girlfriend starts shouting at him : ' i do n't get it . 
  but seriously , why are you doing this to me for such a tiny little problem ? 
  ** mkm : ** the boy still is n't saying anything , though he is clearly embarrassed . 
  ** mkm : ** the girl starts yelling again : ` come on !, 
  say something ! ', 
  step 1 : create a really useful android/ios app, 
  step 2 : wait until your app gets downloaded by at least 100,000 people, 
  step 3 : push out an update with awesome new features , but silently slip in a feature that makes the phone beep loud as hell at 3 am . 
  step 4 : watch as gdp falls because of the tiredness caused by you . 
  cue evil laugh . 
  how many of you did actually convert ? 
  or are there some public analytics of reddit.com to check how much opera 's usage has increased on here ? 
  all that came to mind was explaining subreddits , linking to a few bestof 'd comments , and telling him to always read the usernames . 
  it would be much appreciated :p, 
  i was thinking about writing a program in python , and then creating a gui for it in another language ... python with a gui seems a bit weird to me , even though i could try wxpython . 
  anyway , is this an acceptable thing to do when creating a program with a gui ? 
  bonus question : do you know of any open source python programs that are simple enough for a newbie to participate in ? 
  would n't that be awesome ?

  i have three set , the second one has a full screen grooveshark music player at all times , but i keep forgetting to use the third one . 
  my hotkeys are super +1 / 2/3 for the specific workspaces . 
  ** found ** ( yay ), 
  i saw it in september i think . 
  it would be useful in three way conversations for example . 
  for example : i type / r/playitforward in here , but on client side , this could be automatically changed to [ / r/playitforward ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward ) . 
  worst of all , they have an active reader base of tens of thousands of people , who are all amazed by how awesome their blog is . 
  they post f7u12 comics , pictures from the front page , webcomic strips and stuff from other sites also . 
  they remove watermarks from everything , and put their own site 's name on it . 
  whenever i post a link to the original source as a comment , they simply remove it . 
  is there anything i can do if the author is totally un co-operative ? 
  so , their blog copies ( and sometimes repurposes ) webcomic content , removing the original author 's watermark and replacing it with their own site 's name . 
  examples : [ original ] ( http://endlessorigami.blogspot.com/2010/11/starving-kids-in-africa.html ) and [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/20/az_para_csak_vacsora_utan ) - [ original ] ( http://www.tastefullyoffensive.com/2010/12/wish-id-never-been-born.html ) and [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/20/barcsak_meg_sem_szulettem_volna ) - [ original ] ( http://www.explosm.net/comics/2330/ ) and [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/19/ahogy_az_egesz_kezdodott_3 ), 
  also , a lot of content from the reddit frontpage magically appears on their blog , including fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu comics . 
  examples : [ reddit thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fnulc/assume_work_position/ ) and [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/19/egy_teljesen_atlagos_munkanap ) - [ reddit thread ( original comic ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fk2il/why_my_brother_is_banned_from_using_my_stuff ) and [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/13/jatszani_fogok_egy_kicsit ) - [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/16/pokemon_kitty ) and [ copied ] ( http://azpara.blog.hu/2011/02/13/szoktal_igy_lenni ) , but i could n't find the reddit thread for these . 
  they also copy from cheezburger network sites , graphjam , comixed , et cetera , but i guess you are n't that much interested in those . 
  the most annoying thing about them is that tens of thousands of teenagers basically worship them for `` how funny they are '' ( which is 1 % of my country 's internet using population ) . 
  i 've tried posting the original sources for content appearing on their site as comments multiple times , but they keep removing them . 
  there are batch files i can also edit on the central server with commands that are ran on every start , on every pc . 
  please note : i wo n't do anything destructive or immoral . 
  ** found ** ( by [ flabbytabby ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/fqfwz/tomt_garfield_strip_where_garfield_hits_a_spider/c1hw97c ) ), 
  or something like that . 
  edit : i 'd like to find an image of it , or at least the approximate date of its publication . 
  for example :, 
  ** introducing the f7u12 community , including **, 
  * the okay face, 
  * the forever alone face, 
  * the troll face, 
  * the rage face, 
  * the y u no face, 
  * and others !, 
  hey guys , i thought i would also give this a try , seeing the previous similar post 's warm reception . 
  i can offer some quick , amateur photoshopping or programming , as long as it is fairly simple . 
  or [ tf2 hats/items ] ( http://tf2b.com/?id=underyx ) !, 
  i have n't really played tf2 since the mann-conomy update , but i had almost 600 hours on it . 
  i thought bf : bc2 would be an excellent replacement , based on how much teamwork seems to be required . 
  ( if you want anything else from me that i could probably do for you over the internet , just ask away , and i 'll see what i can do ! ),
