  thanks in advance :p, 
  i am thinking about creating an irc channel for my class , and making them use it , with an autostarting and autojoining irc client on boot . 
  problem is , i ca n't just tell them to install this , set this , and add this to the startup programs , they are n't all that good with computers . 
  also , walking them all through the setup process one by one would take a lot of time . 
  so i thought i might try creating a batch file , but i do n't know how to add a file to the startup programs list in windows in a command line , how to determine the proper path to the appdata folder , where the configuration file is stored , and there might be an easier way to do the whole thing . 
  also , some of them use macs , which i am not familiar with at all , and i would appreciate some instructions to set this up on a mac . 
  probably wo n't have any difficulty with the linux guys . 
  i myself have been using xchat for quite a long time now , and i 'm not sure if it would be a good client for them . 
  so if no one would send spam , what amount of electricity , storage space , processing power , bandwidth , et cetera would be saved per day ? 
  so for example without teachers , would the world be more chaotic than without janitors ? 
  i do this everywhere . 
  hey guys , i have an extra hib1 steam code , so i thought i would send it to one of you . 
  the winner will be whoever finds out and summarizes the most information about me - that 's right , this is basically a stalking contest . 
  i 've always wanted to see an opinbullets-style summary of my online presence , and this seems like the perfect opportunity to have someone do it for me :p, 
  edit : winner will be selected tonight , cest . 
  edit : the winner is [ antemon ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/antemon ) !, 
  so , i am really desperate to get a copy of portal 2 gifted to me . 
  this desperate . 
  based on [ this redditor 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gov9b/as_a_poor_person_with_artistic_ability_i_propose/ ) awesome picture , [ robot shooting cats with lasers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/amlva.jpg ) , i created a pixel art ( art ? ), 
  of robot shooting lasers . 
  it turned out quite bad since i am not talented at all , but i spent 3 hours making it ( pixel by pixel ) so here goes :, 
  ** [ the picture itself ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kb217.png ) **, 
  ** [ the picture in original size ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sdqpg.png ) **, 
  phew . 
  i think i should also tell a bit about myself , i 'll copy in a few sentences i 've written to a giveaway thread ( yes , i know i am starting to be pathetic with all this begging ) :, 
   why do i deserve it ? 
  well , i 've been participating in the arg quite a lot in the last 10 days . 
  i have almost 200 edits on the arg wiki , i found a phase 2 zip file password first ( `` sweetie baby '' ) , i set up a killing floor server on my pc to investigate , and stuff like that . 
  that 's how much i 'm looking forward to portal 2 . 
  also , a week ago i installed windows alongside ubuntu to make me able to play portal 2 once it comes out , i would n't do that for just any random game :d . 
  i know that i will pirate it if i do n't get a free copy from somewhere . 
  it will make me feel bad , but i simply can not buy it - i 'm a high school student from a family that has been struck really bad by a horrible divorce case , 5 of us live in a single roomed house at the moment , but we still have to pay the rent for a much larger house we ca n't even go into . 
  all my money ( collected through years from scholarships mostly , around $ 500 ) is `` lent '' to my mother to help cover these costs . 
  however , please note that i 've already received a few games gifted from reddit . 
  so , fingers crossed . 
  i 'll probably go sleep in a few minutes . 
  currently i have wordpress on the site ( i already own the domain , and have hosting ) , and i am experimenting with different plugins , but none of them does what i would like them to ( most of them have a 20 mb limit on file size , which is not enough ) . 
  the preferred payment method would be paypal , and the files would be stored on amazon s3 , but if that does n't work well enough , i can adapt to other solutions too . 
  so , any ideas on how i could sell a few  50 mb audio files on my website ? 
  i know some basic html and css , but no php , keep that in mind too . 
  also , i expect only around $ 10 of revenue per month , so i 'd rather not pay for a professional solution . 
  the title should describe it well enough , i 'm sure most of you will know what i mean , but for those who do n't , see [ this ] ( http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/effects/ie6/ ) . 
  what made it behave like this ? 
  so far , all our celebrities , like phoy and sidt became popular in a few days/weeks , by having highly upvoted comments in every other thread . 
  but do redditors remember names that they see only every other day for a few months ? 
  ** edit : ** i did n't mean i want to be famous on here . 
  i just was curious about reddit community-theory . 
  on a related note : i 'm curious if anyone recognizes my name . 
  does anyone remember seeing a comment of mine on here ? 
  or anywhere else on the interwebs ? 
  placeholder text to be able to edit . 
  edit : i knew this would come in handy . 
  i meant : `` in the next 20 years , which industries will disappear almost completely ** in developed countries ** ? '', 
  i just saw [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b003x3dei6 ) on [ / r/shutupandtakemymoney ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandtakemymoney ) , and i was quite amazed that it only costs three dollars . 
  there must be more awesome stuff out there really cheap , i thought , so if you know any , tell us !, 
  so , i 'll try to be quick here : i made a facebook chatlog parser , which gets the input from the raw html of the messages page with a certain person . 
  here 's the [ example input ] ( http://pastebin.com/q995wgbz ) , the [ example output ] ( http://pastebin.com/zg6catmg ) and [ the code itself ] ( http://pastebin.com/1e4eywn7 ) . 
  my problem is : i have a lot of regex in there , and parsing a real chatlog file takes a really , really long time . 
  i also think i 've made a lot of stupid mistakes , and the whole program could be written in less than 30 lines . 
  so , someone , please look through the code , and tell me what to do different . 
  it 's an `` instrumental/new age '' track , and , well , my dad does n't believe people on the internet will buy music . 
  so , [ here 's the song itself on itunes ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/rails-to-ulaanbaatar-single/id437816269 ) , or if you prefer , [ bandcamp ] ( http://karmasale.bandcamp.com/track/rails-to-ulaanbaatar ) too . 
  i would really appreciate any help , either simply by buying it , or some advice on how to promote the track . 
  thank you very much in advance !, 
  oh , and also , if you like the song , can you please leave a comment here , just so that i can show him there 's interest on the internet ? 
  i keep getting told that i should charge new batteries for quite a long amount of time to ensure that its battery will be fine later on . 
  why do i need to do it ? 
  does it even work ?

  could he maybe make scientific discoveries in that ancient civilization ? 
  why do redditors upvote them ? 
  ( i honestly want to know the cause , i 'm not whining about the quality of comments decreasing . ), 
  placeholder text . 
  are there people willing to buy 1 or 2 bitcoins ( paying through paypal ) ? 
  or is this really not worth it , seeing how everyone seems to be buying now ? 
  i mean , there has been an undeniable drop in comment and submission quality recently . 
  all those new users who caused it would probably migrate over to some other site if reddit would stay down for a really long time , and we would leave happily ever after . 
  right ? 
  why does such a simple task feel so good ? 
  so , a friend of mine asked me to find this comic she saw around two weeks ago . 
  she says it was black & white , and its story was that at first there was a couple , but the girl broke up with the boy , and thereby , broke his heart , which was depicted on the drawing itself . 
  the boy formed a bubble around himself , and when another girl wanted to approach the boy , the bubble blocked her . 
  she then proceeded to take her heart out ( through a door on her chest ) , managed to break the bubble , gave half of her heart to the boy , and in the end they both were happy . 
  well , that 's all my friend told me , hope you have seen this comic as well . 
  i know you guys do n't appreciate these basic , repetitive beats a lot , but the two genres still seemed like a unique combination to me , so i thought i would share and let the upvotes decide . 
  [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://soundcloud.com/underyx/rails-to-ulaanbaatar-dubstep ), 
  i 've seen a lot of these on here in the last few months , so i thought maybe some of you still have a coupon lying around for a redditor in need . 
  my whole family has spent a lot of time and money creating meditation cds , especially my mother , who worked really hard , giving up almost her whole life for this business , and we launched the webshop for digital distribution of these cds a week ago , but sadly , only had two purchases so far . 
  we really would benefit from some advertising opportunities , i already have a facebook campaign set up , but we can hardly afford 10 clicks a day . 
  so , if any of you kind redditors have a spare ad coupon , and do n't know what to do with it , please send me a message . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  yeah , well , i have 1.8 usd in my bank account and 0.23 bitcoins ( worth 3.3 usd at the moment ) i can pay you for a spare copy . 
  does anyone have one i can buy by any chance ? 
  let 's say , one day you wake up , and see that you have been transformed into a vampire overnight ( and you are the only vampire in the world . ), 
  how would you monetize this ? 
  tell me your business models . 
  hey , guys , i have ~ ~ 44.37 edit : 27.52 ~ ~ ** edit # 2 : 61.67 ** usd on my amazon.com account which i got from working on mechanical turk , but since i 'm european , most of the merchants wo n't ship to me , and even if they do , the shipping itself costs more than $ 20 . 
  so , if possible , i 'd like to use this balance up in exchange for money . 
  was any of you going to buy something on amazon that they would be willing to buy through me ?
