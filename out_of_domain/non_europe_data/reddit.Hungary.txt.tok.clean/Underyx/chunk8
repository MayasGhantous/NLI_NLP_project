  i told a friend i 'll somehow get him portal . 
  i myself played it through at least 4 times . 
  he does have the orange box on the xbox 360 , however , he is not that good at english , and i would like him to play the game with a hungarian translation , which would let him understand the story a lot better . 
  edit : damn , i just realized you already gave it away . 
  never mind then . 
  the final bosses of super paper mario were quite good . 
  thank you very much , however , another kind redditor already pm 'd me and gifted him the game . 
  ... that 's actually true . 
  at first i wanted to say how some blogs have really insightful comments , but then i realized it was the teenagers we were talking about here ... thank you , i probably could n't have received better advice . 
  thanks , but i was thinking about something that 's a bit more subtle :p, 
  too late :(, 
  nope . 
  nope . 
  i never intended to screw any of those teachers over . 
  oh come on , how many of you did n't read that two lines of text in my submission ? 
   please note : i wo n't do anything destructive or immoral . 
  an image of it , sorry , that was n't clear . 
   from my experience , anyways . 
  come on , this is reddit . 
  please put some effort into your comments . 
  [ are you sure ?

  i 'm pretty sure that the joke of pretending to use a spray against the spider but then hitting it with the can instead has been used only once :p, 
  but thanks anyway . 
  indeed , that is !, 
  thank you very much . 
  my god , it 's full of stars !, 
  and it starts with v2 .0 !, 
  unprecedented !, 
  you should know you 're doing something wrong when even the toys are revolting against you . 
  and that evilish smile ... oh god . 
  you should be sorry about not leaving out the yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh , reddit unofficial etiquette dictates that you should let the next commenter get part of your karma by replying with a yeah . 
  you mean guy fawkes mask ? 
  needs more pixels , especially the bottom half . 
  yay , i just found my battery charger looking at this picture . 
  thanks !, 
  actually , yes , it 's a synthesizer stand with a plank on it . 
  [ ] ( / troll `` like this '' ), 
  but on a more serious note , he may win in total number of items left around , but is his items/space higher ? 
  yeah . 
  ( also do n't feel bad , i was kinda like just kidding ), 
  uh , the only game worth mentioning that i have a physical copy of is spore , but i live in europe and i 'm not sure how much international shipping would cost . 
  other than that , no . 
  hey there !, 
  i would be interested in the game you wanted to give to him if you do n't mind . 
  just tell me what i can do for you :p ( think amateur photoshopping/programming , or some tf2 items , or whatever you need ), 
  * ( yeah , i totally copied this whole comment off from my reply to another redditor above ) *,

  okay , sorry then . 
  i was thinking of some work/services , not a game for game trade . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  yes , i am sure my pc will be able to run it , and yes , i am a high school student . 
  lawnmowerkitties . 
  i am . 
  [ ( it 's rated 16 + in europe , and i am definitely older than that :p ) ] ( http://www.pegi.info/en/index/global_id/505/?searchstring=battlefield%3a+bad+company+2&amp;agecategories=&amp;genre=&amp;organisations=&amp;platforms=pc&amp;countries=&amp;submit=search ), 
  i did , lawnmowerkitties . 
  i , just like a lot of redditors , prefer karma to being funny . 
  mario party does n't have online multiplayer . 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  i have to tell you - no one has ever convinced me this much to do better in school . 
  luckily , i 'm quite a good student ( i came third in national mathematics competitions twice , i think i can say my english is also pretty good , and i have fairly good grades in everything ) . 
  however , i think i 'll not be satisfied with a b in history then , so i 'll take my history notes and read through them a few times right away . 
  also , family . 
  i think i already am talking to them a lot , and none of my close relatives are `` distant '' from me , but i can promise i will keep it like this . 
  the third point ... when i can , i am more than happy to help people . 
  unfortunately , i can not assist anyone financially , since i gave all my money ( meaning around $ 500 , collected over years from scholarship , from relatives on holidays , et cetera ) to my mother , who is in a very bad divorce case right now . 
  other than that , i do my best to help people . 
  thank you very much . 
  ( this whole comment of mine reads like i want to convince you that you can trust me , and you do n't have to worry about me not doing what you asked me to ... sorry about that , it 's just that i can hardly believe that there are people like you in the world , who do good things to others only to make them spread the kindness . ), 
  i 've never been this disappointed by a dot :(, 
  at least it keeps [ these ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mabenbhpjlchigbbpafligkdnlhjbmel ) away . 
  ( note : i have had this extension installed for over a year ), 
  solution : make every goal worth 6 points , like a touchdown in handegg ? 
  i 'm sorry , is writing it as `` m$ '' really necessary ? 
  it makes you seem like you are trying really hard to show you are anti-microsoft , and like free software , because you do n't feel you fit in this community well enough . 
  and my experience is that most people who write these `` m$ '' and `` microsucks '' , et cetera words actually use windows , and could n't even think about working on linux/mac . 
  also , i do n't think microsoft should be bashed that much . 
  i 'm a ubuntu user , but even i say microsoft contributed a lot to technology . 
  why do you need to delete history if you use private mode ? 
  yeah , and that reminds me , in 100m dash competitions , they count seconds one at a time , and they never get a score of only one or two seconds . 
  rank up !, 
  super sergeant master sergeant shooter person !, 
  my main point was n't that `` microsoft is so awesome , do n't you dare say a bad word of them '' , but that `` m$ '' looks bad . 
  reddit usually has not only grammatically correct , but also aesthetically pleasing comments - m$ is like the names people choose in certain fps games , for example xxx5upa5niperxxx . 
  you ca n't argue that these are quite bad to look at . 
  okay , looks like i did n't convince you , no problem :p,
