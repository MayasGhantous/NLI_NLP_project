  and please do n't mention any of the obvious ones like `` do n't shout at me '' and `` restart your computer before calling for help '' , i 'm looking for stuff that people do n't do because they do n't know about it , not because they are assholes . 
  i have [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pfyod.jpg ) game console ( ~ ~ note that sega never released a `` mega drive 2 '' ~ ~ ** edit : seems like i 'm totally wrong on this . 
  ** the point is , this is some kind of a chinese copy . ), 
  it 's around 13 years old , and it had the same games the nes and the sega master system had - this includes super mario bros and sonic the hedgehog , for example . 
  the games are actually quite good copies of the originals , i basically ca n't notice any difference from the ones i play on emulators now . 
  i just wanted to know if i should bother with trying to find this and putting it up on ebay for example . 
  ... i feel sad now that i 'm thinking about parting with it , this console was basically all of my childhood . 
  the original is over 2 years old , so it 's time for a repost , right ? 
  for example in the wii remote , or in certain smartphones . 
  edit : yeah , sorry about the title , i meant accelerometers , i did n't know they were called that before i read the answers in this thread . 
  though , i 'm supposed to be a 5 year old , right ?

  i never knew what kind of a job those people have , what do they have to do in their office/cubicle all day ? 
  please do n't say ` browse reddit ' . 
  placeholder text for possible future edits . 
  i always imagined research to advance in huge jumps , when someone has a great idea . 
  however what i see is that things constantly get more powerful , processors for example . 
  this is even described in moore 's law . 
  but how does this happen ? 
  what does the frequency of a sound mean ? 
  how do we actually hear sound ? 
  what is the difference between the sound that for example a piano and a guitar emits when it 's the same note ?

  edit : found by [ smooshie ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/smooshie ) , it 's [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/i4hm6/ ) . 
  i just had some bug fly onto my display because of its light . 
  i then proceeded to open the ( black ) command line , and i moved the window under the bug - it flew away in a few seconds because of the sudden darkness . 
  i 've built a few pcs , i 've disassembled several different gadgets , and i 've always wondered what happens on the circuit boards on them - what those little gizmos attached to it do , what the other gizmos do , and then there 's that third type of gizmo that 's all over circuit boards . 
  where can i learn about them ? 
  i know absolutely nothing about circuitry and i have only a basic understanding of electricity . 
  edit : oh , and i know a bit of programming , if that helps in any way . 
  or maybe they could display some informative text when logging in sometimes and ask questions about it the next day . 
  is there anything i did stupidly in this ? 
  what the hell do i do with licenses ? 
  the program itself has a quite simple purpose , it is meant to be ran on the user 's birthday , it checks the user 's facebook wall every 5 seconds and if it sees a new wall post , the program thanks the person who wished the user happy birthday . 
  here 's the [ source code ] ( http://pastebin.com/v3d3dzcq ) . 
  so , if you would comment `` no . '', 
  on this submission , it would be added to the list of comments that have already been made , and if a month later someone else would try to comment `` no . '', 
  on a completely different submission in / r/askreddit for example , that comment would not be saved by reddit . 
  okay , this would be a feature that would be difficult , or even impossible to implement reliably , but i had an idea just now on how it could be done . 
  so , whenever res sees a submission with the string '' [ fixed ] '' in its title , it could load its comment area in the background , search for a comment by [ original-finder ] ( / user/original-finder ) , and retrieve the link to the original submission from there . 
  if the submission is recent , it would probably be more efficient to load original-finder 's recent comments , and find its comment to the fixed submission there . 
  probably the fixed-original submission ids could be saved in local storage and be loaded from there , to save bandwidth on refreshes . 
  or maybe , just maybe , someone could run a small script that fetches orginal-finder 's userpage every few minutes and then publishes the fixed-original id pairs somewhere online for res to search in - i guess res pro will mean that there will be servers for res that could ( perhaps ) be used for this purpose . 
  so , a friend of mine is looking for a website he saw a few months ago . 
  all he knows about it is that it had a black background , the page content was pushed a bit to the left side , with the right side of the page staying empty , and the site had comparisons of different cameras , with sample photos . 
  i know this is not really much to work with , but oh well . 
  hey , guys , could any of you perhaps identify [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyyf6s9rnn4 ) ? 
  the band is probably hungarian , and that 's all i know . 
  a friend of mine is looking for this , and the title has all the information we know . 
  her memories are a bit hazy , so feel free to comment with anything that even slightly resembles what 's described in the title . 
  update : it was aired in commercial breaks , and she has seen it on nickelodeon this summer as well . 
  my friend is looking for this - she says it was aired in commercial breaks , and she has seen it on nickelodeon this summer as well - it was only around 2 minutes long . 
  [ my tomt post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/lzjl1/tomtcartoon_90s_nickelodeon_claymation_short_with/ ), 
  i do n't really mind corporations knowing everything about me , i do n't see how that could hurt me . 
  and i even benefit from targeted advertising - what exactly is the problem with all this ?

  see for example , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/n8zfl/i_havent_done_any_homework_all_weekend_this_is/ ) , the title has [ 0:08 ] twice in it . 
  another ( a bit wilder ) idea : could res maybe automatically append the timecode to the title entered on the submission page when a user submits a video , thus enhancing reddit for non res-users ? 
  i have a giftable copy of greed corp in [ my inventory ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/underyx/inventory/ ) . 
  oh , i found [ an askscience explanation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mal3k/what_is_happening_to_my_body_when_i_have_a/c2zf68p ) in the meantime . 
  cross-posted from [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/o2nhu/if_a_leech_feeds_on_a_drunk_persons_blood_does/ ) . 
  if i have a task and write two different algorithms to solve it ( in python , in my case ) , how can i find out which one is the faster ? 
  i know i could start and stop a timer in the code before and after the algorithms , but i somehow feel there has to be a smarter way to do this , since the running time is not perfectly accurate due to other active programs on my pc and whatnot . 
  if that 's even possible . 
  at the very least , i 'd love to be able to be able to determine if a qr code contains a link or a numerical code or whatever else . 
  so , for example , if you buy a dvd , around 40 cents go to artisjus , which is our copyright-protecting organization . 
  this is not really that much , but look at these other prices :, 
  32 gb sd card : $ 15 goes to artisjus, 
  16 gb flash drive : $ 5 goes to artisjus, 
  16 gb mp3 player : $ 25 goes to artisjus, 
  16 gb cell phone : $ 20 goes to artisjus, 
  200 gb dvr : $ 25 goes to artisjus, 
  1 tb external hdd : $ 10 goes to artisjus, 
  these fees , of course , raise the prices of these media . 
  the reasoning from artisjus ? 
  they say ` copyrighted content * could * be put on these things ' , so they just charge the copyright fee assuming that 's what they are being bought for .
