  edit : for anyone feeling the same way as me , my choices were : [ abstruse goose ] ( http://abstrusegoose.com/ ) , [ doghouse diaries ] ( http://thedoghousediaries.com/ ) , and [ cyanide & happiness ] ( http://www.explosm.net/comics ) . 
  ( the last one was n't even suggested , i just realized today that i should subscribe to them as i keep laughing at random comics i find links to . ), 
  basically the title says it all , i think . 
  i 'd love to see a technical explanation on what happens these times . 
  getting submissions caught as spam is really annoying , and i get it on  50 % of my posts , so i have to write messages requesting approval every other day . 
  is there perhaps a chance that res could automate this process , by having a pre-written message ( something along the lines of `` hey , guys , could you please let [ this submission ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohg5sjyrha0 ) through the spam filter ? 
  thanks ! '' ), 
  being sent with only clicking a link next to ` hide delete nsfw ` etc. 
  maybe ? 
  my favorites from them are ( in order ) :, 
  * [ suburban space invader ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do3qhbplzny ), 
  * [ out of frequency ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8jcxswsoy4 ), 
  * [ the golden age ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5h-lavqdcq ), 
  * [ cloak and dagger ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnypzfo86lk ), 
  * [ heart attack ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvpjpodei5s ), 
  * [ major ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ob7oqxsc4 ), 
  * [ mafia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_ziyzuyy58 ), 
  my favorites include derty , disorganized fun , fifteen fifty , throwing fire , stay crunchy , neptune , super-fun and loui .

  well , the title has almost everything , but i guess i might as well tell my story here . 
  so , i think most people would advise against doing this , but just hear me out first . 
  i 'm currently living with four family members in a single room , my parents are divorced and they keep quarreling all day - if not with each other , then with my 5 year old sister who was sexually abused by her father , my mom 's second husband . 
  my mother has divorced from her second husband as well , but for the last two years , she has spent basically all her time in legal battles against him , with countless different cases going simultaneously for different reasons . 
  now , clearly , everyone living here is a complete nervous wreck , and i 'm starting to feel like i ca n't really take it anymore - i 've been toying with the idea of living on my own for the last few months , but after a huge fight today , i 'm almost sure i 'm going to do it . 
  as for the financial part of the story : i gave most of my money up until now to my parents , but now i 've started to save up for moving out . 
  last month , i 've made $ 850 on the internet ; $ 750 from amazon affiliate links ( mostly on reddit - sorry , guys ) and $ 100 from google 's code-in programming competition thingie . 
  now , the amazon advertising part of it is quite unstable , i 'm not sure if i can keep up a fairly steady income from that , but should be around $ 100 per month at least . 
  the programming competition is naturally a one time only thing , but i could use my knowledge of python and html to get a few extra bucks with freelance work . 
  i also could do some translating , as i feel i am fairly proficient in english , while my native language is hungarian - that also should help out a bit . 
  all this added to a part-time job 's salary ( since i am a high school student , of course ) would cover the costs of living , i think . 
  ... okay , i guess that 's all there is to tell about my background and my plans . 
  i would really appreciate any advice you might have for me , even if it 's just telling me to forget this whole thing and just stay put until i finish high school . 
  ** edit : ** please note that i live in hungary , not in the us . 
  rent + utilities for a small apartment should cost around $ 300 - $ 500 here . 
  ** edit # 2 : ** thanks , guys , everyone 's been really helpful so far !, 
  ** edit # 3 : ** removed links to affiliate link reddit posts after being accused of fabricating this story just to get more clicks on them . 
  i have one lying around , and i 'm considering using it as the only hdd in a low budget ( $ 350 ) gaming pc . 
  is it going to significantly slow it down provided that i find an lga1155 mobo with an ide port ? 
  i 'm aiming for using parts from the logical increments guide 's minimum row . 
  a friend of mine is looking for this , the title has everything i know . 
  the google + redesign video show something like this , i 've seen several references by all kinds of people to an embedded player , and i find it hard to believe that no one on reddit would miss this feature . 
  am i doing something wrong that all youtube videos open in new tabs for me ?

  edit : [ found ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in30th3kkv8 ) !, 
  i 'm about to play the role of a director in a play at high school , and i 'm supposed to interrupt the actors twice during the recording of a tv show to yell at them about how bad they are at acting . 
  the first time i 'm mad about how they do crying , and the second time i just shout at them about their acting in general . 
  i thought i could maybe throw in a witty one liner or two in the script , but i 'm not quite satisfied with anything i came up with so far . 
  any ideas ? 
  edit : oh dear , this seems to have turned a bit circlejerky .

  [ here 's ] ( http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=je8jtm1m ) my latest chatlog of doing this . 
  the best part is where they kinda pretended to know me to be a commentator :, 
   17:33 your imagination : our mmr is worth atleaast tobi 's casting, 
   17:33 your imagination : and underyx 's, 
  the song started off with singing or there was singing really early on , and the vocals came back time to time . 
  i do n't really know a lot more about the song . 
  [ it was a bit like this in style ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp_pijc2ga4 ) , with less vocals . 
  it also slightly reminded me of [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg0oeljbhms ) . 
  the words ` outer space ' were n't said a lot of times in the song , only twice , i think . 
  ** edit : ** solved at last with the help of someone irl . 
  thanks for your help , everyone !, 
  for anyone curious , the song was [ visitors by koto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byohfdi693k ) . 
  ### in the first 10 minutes, 
  * you need to ** stay together !, 
  ** if you try to steal the enemy team 's candy as a team , it will be harder for them to defend them . 
  this works the other way around as well - if you defend with your team , your pieces of candy will stay right where they were . 
  * pieces of candy will keep dropping throughout the candy stealing phase when roshlings die in the lanes , so keep a lookout for those . 
  * ** do n't freaking push the lanes !, 
  ** even more so than in a normal game of dota , since the towers are invulnerable . 
  naturally , the closer the roshlings die to your base , the easier it will be to collect the pieces of candy they drop . 
  ### when roshan starts chasing people, 
  * once roshan start chasing people , try to ** keep candy with yourself ** at all times !, 
  giving candy to roshan is the only way you can escape when it starts chasing you . 
  ( you can do this by dragging it from your inventory onto roshan - i think . 
  i was panicking way too much when i gave my candy to him , and tried to give it the candy all kinds of ways , i 'm not sure if this really was the one . ), 
  * try and ** save your teammates by giving roshan candy ** even when it is not you who 's being chased , he 'll retarget regardless of who 's giving it the candy . 
  well co-ordinated teams might even move in packs with one member of the team carrying candy and giving it to roshan every time it 's needed . 
  * last hits and getting experience from killing creeps are the least of your worries here , you 're going to get a lot more gold and xp from elsewhere ( i believe the whole team gets both those with collecting candy , i 'm not sure , though . ), 
  ### while fighting roshan, 
  * ** do n't waste your time attacking enemy heroes !, 
  ** yes , i know , this should be obvious , but the game i played , the players kept doing this for some weird reason , so i might need to include this . 
  you can do no damage whatsoever to enemy heroes after the 20 minute mark . 
  * similarly , another obvious thing that the people i played with strangely did n't notice : roshan has really long attack animations - ** if you see roshan casting a spell , get the hell out !, 
  ** all its attacks are powerful as hell , and you really ca n't afford to get hit by any of them . 
  * the best items to get against roshan are , of course , dps items . 
  ** divine rapiers are especially good ** , since even if you die , others can keep the dps up by using your dropped rapiers . 
  other good items include : ** boots of travel ** , since you can use it to tp right onto roshan and get back real quick , ** blink dagger/force staff ** , to dodge roshan 's devastating spells ( if you 're really clumsy , a bkb can block them as well ) and a ** daedalus ** for whoever has really high dps . 
  whenever i want to start , say , chrome , i used to just press the win key , the letter c , and enter started it as the search results had chrome in first place when i searched for ` c ' . 
  now , since a few weeks ago , it just says ` no apps match your search ' until i type out the whole word , ` chrome ' .
