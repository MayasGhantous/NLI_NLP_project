  does this happen to anyone else ? 
  any ways to make it work the way it did before ? 
  i 've tried several different apps , but none of them seem to have placed any emphasis on design . 
  the worst is how the page turning animations lag even on my one x. 
  [ link to item in question ] ( http://optf2.com/d2/item/76561197996755305/139149967 ), 
  and if so , what cpu should i ideally upgrade to ? 
  hey , guys !, 
  i have this [ ancient laptop ] ( http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/latc600/en/ug/specs.htm ) right beside me , not doing that much . 
  i 've been thinking about maybe making it a cute little media center thingie , to have stuff run on it while i 'm using my main pc -- i 'm not sure how , though , since it 's just so slow . 
  i normally use xbmc for all such needs of mine , but i 'm pretty sure it will be really , really sluggish . 
  any suggestions ? 
  i 'm running archlinux on the laptop , and all the media would be served off of my main pc , over my lan . 
  i keep having games where all my money goes to buy observers and sentries to the point where i ca n't even get boots because the enemy team keeps dewarding everything . 
  should there ever be a point where i stop spending money on doing this ? 
  for anyone wanting to watch on dotatv , just find someone in the rd2l match with the clan tag ` wp  ' and watch their game from 8pm gmt . 
  instead of creating new threads , please do your invite-sharing business in the comments of this thread , be it offering up a spare one , or requesting one . 
  i 'd appreciate if everyone could include either the tag [ requesting ] or [ offering ] in their comments , to make finding comments via ctrl-f easier . 
  also , one more rule : if you received your invite , or found someone to send it to , please edit your post to reflect this -- removing the tags mentioned above would be nice too . 
  these things above are only recommendations , here come the actual rules ( as per google 's requirements ) :, 
  * ** everyone requesting must be at least 18 years old **, 
  * ** everyone requesting must be a us resident **, 
  * ** requesters must be able to pick up their google glass in either ny , sf , or la **, 
  * ** requesters will also be required to pay around $ 1500 for the device itself **, 
  i know , fellow europeans , it sucks , but requesting an invite in spite of this will just be a waste of time :(, 
  i just remembered that i donated enough money for a shoutout when the campaign happened , does anyone have any info about when the shoutouts happened/where i could check them ? 
  edit : to clarify , this is about the ` magic wand ' perk [ here ] ( http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beyond-the-summit-esports-studio/x/2376930 ) . 
  edit 2 : messaged bts , got reply , now i 'm happy . 
   nope , you did n't miss those . 
  we 'll be doing them over our next few studio broadcasts hopefully in the next few weeks . 
  songs are coming soon too , 
   thanks ,,

  ### why i 'm posting this :, 
  so , i 've messaged two different moderators about this ; one in april , one in september . 
  they both replied , with the first of them thanking me and the second one saying `` i 'll make sure that this is forwarded '' , but after almost 8 months now , nothing has changed . 
  i guess some publicity might help to get this fixed , as i 'm pretty sure people are catching on as to how this ( actually really simple ) exploit works . 
  ### what the exploit does :, 
  it basically gives you allvision , including enemy spell cooldowns , current gold , ward locations , stash contents , and basically everything , with a really tiny amount of social engineering . 
  ### how the exploit works :, 
  really , really simple . 
  actually i 'm pretty sure a whole bunch of you will be going ` how did i not realize this before ? 
  ' , perhaps some one you even thinking ` how did others not know about this ? ', 
  say your game is bugged and you need to restart , or some other random excuse , asking the players to pause for three minutes . 
  pause and disconnect from the game . 
  start spectating dotatv of your match . 
  wait 2 minutes for it to catch up . 
  ta-da !, 
  you can now see the enemy team trying to sneak into rosh pit while your pause is still going , just go reconnect to your game and intercept them . 
  that 's all , really . 
  ### how this could be fixed :, 
  a fix actually exists in all other multiplayer valve games , as far as i know . 
  team fortress 2 , for example ( i 'm pretty sure all the other games work like this , too ) does a pretty straightforward , even if weird thing when a game is paused : it stops the sourcetv as well , at the very same time . 
  actual time , not game time . 
  so , since the delay there is 90 seconds , if you tried to do the same thing , when you connect to sourcetv you 'd just see the game being frozen in place 90 seconds before your pause indefinitely . 
  of course , when you unpause the live match , sourcetv also gets unpaused and it continues off from exactly 90 seconds behind , where it was frozen . 
  the actual pause will not be seen on sourcetv at all , only that seemingly random freezing . 
  ### notes :, 
  not much to say here . 
  the exploit can be used wherever dotatv is enabled , including mm , tmm , lobby games , and even tournament games . 
  and lastly , a quick disclaimer : no , i 've never used this in a live match . 
  no one in / r/dota2 seemed to actually read my post , here 's hoping this subreddit will be more open for doing so :,

  the only specific thing i 'm sure about is that the game had really nice visual design , with one half of the screen black and the other white , and the whole thing being grained out , which made the two colors look really really nice next to each other . 
  i 'd like to incorporate this in a website design of mine , so i 'm looking for the screenshots/video i saw about this game 3-6 years ago . 
  you controlled a triangle/arrow , which was at the bottom of the screen and it changed from black to white depending on what background it was on . 
  i think i found it while researching an xna/xbox 360 zatacka clone , seen in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76eztweds9y ) . 
  i think it had a neat trailer , too .
