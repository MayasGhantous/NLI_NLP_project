  and this game did n't count eitherkashgasvhyxcgfawesvdfhwectasxdfwe, 
  ** edit : ** had to wait 37 minutes for it to show up . 
  everything fine now . 
  love you valve . 
  no , i 'm not gon na die of a heart attack . 
  nope . 
  i 'm fine . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  i really am . 
  i was n't thinking of suicide or anything , i do n't know where you guys even got that from . 
  not a chance . 
  hey , guys !, 
  i have $ 250 to upgrade my rather sluggish pc , which currently has the following parts ( some of them are too old to even generate a table with on pcpartpicker ) :, 
  * ** cpu ** : intel e8400 ( lga775 ), 
  * ** gpu ** : amd hd5850 ( pcie ), 
  * ** ram ** : 5 gb , but ddr2 , so i 'll definitely have to trash this, 
  * ** psu ** : not entirely sure right now , should be 350w or 400w . 
  can check if important . 
  i 'm interested in how you guys would go about upgrading this . 
  i would probably get more money to buy more parts in around 6 months . 
  of course , my main problem is how i 'd need to buy a new motherboard to do any meaningful upgrading , but i have no ddr3 ram , which costs a lot right now and will eat up most of my money . 
  i use this pc for gaming , mainly ( i 'd like to be able to play watch dogs on it , got no problem with minimum graphics settings , though ) . 
  it was getting pretty hard to sort through all the expired invites/fulfilled requests in the last thread , so from now on i 'll make a new invite thread every week .

  a friend of mine 's looking for this , here 's what he told me about it :, 
  * he found it 6-10 years ago . 
  * was a huge collection of games, 
  * one of the games had you solving puzzles with three wizard, 
  * this game was based on elemental stuff , the three wizards were water/fire/earth, 
  * this one was a top-down 2.5 d game , divided into squares on a grid . 
  * the ground was also part of the elemental thingies , there was ice and lava . 
  * there was a space themed game , based on qix , but the enemy could capture area as well . 
  * this one had a greyish-white background , like the hull of a spaceship . 
  * captured area got changed into different colors .
