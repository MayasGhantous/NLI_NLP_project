  [ here 's a sample ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ife5mht-3p0#t=214 ) ( very minor spoilers for the game ) . 
  i know the obvious way to look would be david kaufman 's filmography , but he just does n't sound the same in his other works . 
  hey there !, 
  i 'm a hungarian developer who 's being contracted by a californian company . 
  i was sent over a contract that i 'm supposed to sign , being told it 's an nda , but reading through it i came across a section which , if i 'm interpreting it correctly , could give the company full ownership of anything i create in relation to my work . 
  [ here 's the relevant section from the contract . 
  now , i 've done work with this employer before , and i trust them quite a lot , but i figure it might be better to be on the safe side and ask you about this . 
  if i were to , for example , create a tool which makes my work easier , would i still be allowed to release said tool under a license of my choosing , with the company being under the same restrictions as anyone else ? 
  such as , could they release a closed sourced version of my work if i license it under gpl ? 
  could i be held liable for damages done by said tool even if it 's under an mit license ? 
  a friend of mine spilled some water onto his razer goliathus , and now three of four optical mice he tried have this problem where the mice just will hardly pick up any movement if he 's moving the mice too fast . 
  anyone have any idea why this might happen ? 
  he says he already washed the mousepad before and that never caused any problems . 
  i 've had my defective mouse approved for an rma , but now i have to send it to denmark for inspection . 
  i 've checked the hungarian post 's rates for this and apparently it 's more than 9,000 huf , at which point i 'd almost be better off just buying an entirely new mouse . 
  any ideas on what to do here ? 
  i really do n't want to spend more than 3,000 on postage . 
  the package is just the mouse itself , without the original box and stuff . 
  could i perhaps just send it in an envelope or something ? 
  i 'm quite devastated , really . 
  i 'm right in the middle of an rma process for a steelseries mouse , too . 
  they had me send the defective mouse back and i have to assume they 're going to want me to do the same for the headset , but sending it across europe is just so dishearteningly expensive !, 
  is there any other way i could go about this ? 
  i mean , i literally opened the box that arrived today and the headset was already broken , the right side would n't play audio , unless i fiddle with the wire connecting the two sides * juuust * right . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0s14e6pxeas ) repeats in the chorus , but the singer was singing it with a lot more ... uh , power , of course . 
  edit : oh , jeez , forgot to mention that the singer was female . 
  also , the song was akin to what you 'd hear in a top 40 song of recent years -- electronic-ish pop , like britney spears and stuff . 
  edit 2 : heard it again today on the radio , and shazam was a cool enough dude to help me out !, 
  it was [ emeli sand\u00e9 - next to me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nwdjqmc_n8 ) . 
  might not be as electronic as i remembered . - .
