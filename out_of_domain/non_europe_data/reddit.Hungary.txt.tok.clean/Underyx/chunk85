  i have a friend who stands at around 140 competitive games played , and he literally has had around 95 % of his games start on t side . 
  and i mean it , no confirmation bias here , he ca n't even remember when he last started on ct. 
  so this made us wondering how this might happen . 
  how does the game determine starting sides ? 
  he 's just poured his heart out on his stream about how he had to sell basically all his stuff cause he 's having trouble paying rent , even . 
  he 's devoting his everything to provide us with entertainment and now the money he 's receiving from fans is actually gradually decreasing -- guys , we got ta help him out here . 
  just [ go on his patreon page ] ( http://www.patreon.com/edje ) and pledge whatever you want to give him per video . 
  it just break my heart to see him not getting enough while there 's clearly so many people enjoying what he 's doing . 
  go put in $ 1 or whatever , just give him something :(, 
  hey , everyone !, 
  we , your resident subreddit moderators , have been contacted by [ joe casabona ] ( http://casabona.org/ ) who offered up two copies of his newly released ebook , [ the web designer 's guide to google glass ] ( http://www.peachpit.com/store/web-designers-guide-to-google-glass-9780133845020 ) , for us to raffle off to you . 
  to make things a bit more fun , we 're announcing a contest based on one of joe 's projects , [ people reacting to glass ] ( http://peoplereactingtoglass.com/ ) . 
  here 's what you 're gon na have to do win one of the copies :, 
  ### the details, 
  this post is going to have the so-called ` contest mode ' enabled in the comments , which means that all top level submissions will have their scores hidden , and they 'll be displayed in random order to everyone . 
  to enter to contest , you need to ** post a top level entry , with a link to a photo you took of someone 's reaction when they first saw your google glass ** ( with their permission , naturally ) . 
  the entries will then be voted upon by the community , and the winners will be the ones with the top two scores at the end of the contest ( ordered by top sorting , i.e. 
  ordering by karma ) . 
  ** the contest is going to run from the submission of this post until march 22nd 6pm gmt ** . 
  the winners will be announced and contacted shortly afterwards . 
  now , obviously , we are not going to ask you to provide verification in the form of holding up a piece of paper as it usually goes with contests like these , not while you 're taking a photo of a person . 
  that 'd be pretty awkward , right ? 
  ( bonus points if you still dare do it though , i guess . ), 
  as a matter of fact , seeing how we 're still a relatively small community , i think we could just try trusting each other . 
  regardless , we reserve to right to disqualify anyone in case there 's reasonable doubt that their entry is not authentic , and the contestant fails to verify the authenticity by sending us the original image file containing correct exif data ... but come on , why would it come to that ? 
  have fun !, 
  [ * ^ ^ \\ ( original ^ ^ post ^ ^ here . 
  ) * ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/20c0c5/win_one_of_two_copies_of_joe_casabonas_the_web/?sort=top ), 
  hey again , y' all !, 
  so , we did get a fair amount of entries in the end . 
  not a lot of votes though , sad times , sad times . 
  for the record , [ here 's how the top of comments section looked ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7unfqy3.png ) when the contest concluded . 
  ### the winners :, 
  they would be ** / u/myckyeyez ** with [ this photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5dm71x4.jpg ) and ** / u/anyletter ** with [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fj3wcxb.jpg ) !, 
  we will contact the author now , and you two can expect to receive your prizes pretty soon . 
  thanks to everyone who participated , and of course , our thanks go to joe casabona for offering to give two of these ebooks away !, 
  there 's no freaking reason to do that . 
  it 's a common noun : visa . 
  it 's not an abbreviation , not a proper noun , ** it 's a fucking common noun ** . 
  cause he lost his parens at an early age, 
  hey there !, 
  i 'm one of the people working on a website called [dotabank.com ] ( http://dotabank.com ) . 
  i 'll skip the pitch this one time , and go straight to our problem : we are planning to start charging a monthly fee for extra features , but are only expecting an income of around , say 100 usd per month , and would only like to cover operational costs with the money . 
  now , we need to do this to keep the project alive and self-sustaining , but having a lawyer oversee this operation would be rather expensive , considering how we do n't really want to make a profit on all this . 
  so , i was wondering , is it viable to launch such a service without legal guidance ? 
  how are we going to pay taxes ? 
  what bank account can we funnel the money into ? 
  if that helps , we have team members in the uk and in hungary who could be trusted with handling it . 
  y' all got any advice on how to dive into all this ? 
  i really do n't want to cut it in two . 
  is there a way to safely get rid of this metallic thingie on it ? 
  i 'm an esports activist in hungary , and the nyt today had [ an article about esports right on the center of the front page ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/images/2014/08/31/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf ) . 
  i thought it might be nice to take this to events or something like that , and it 'd be just a nice thing to own , really . 
  hey y' all , i 've been saving up for going to dhw for a while now , from hungary . 
  i thought i would just rent a pc in j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping , but i ca n't see any info about this on the website . 
  i really do n't want to bring my own computer , my case is fucking enormous : /, 
  can i really not rent a pc at the venue ? 
  i was n't really going to compete , but do you guys think the event + flight tickets are worth the price even without a computer ? 
  or is there some convenient way to carry a gigantic case around that i do n't know of ? 
  i 'd like to use a moto 360 and will probably use a forwarding service to get the watch here . 
  is there anything that could fuck me over that i did n't think of ? 
  all i can think of is charger incompatibility , but i already have a us converter , so that should be alright .

  hey ,, 
  so i left my pc in sleep for the weekend , and when i got back home i could n't resume it . 
  here 's a video of what is happening now when i try to turn it on :, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoo_lxiimqa - you might need to have a keen eye to notice , but whenever the fans start slowing down , the pc shuts off completely . 
  sometimes , if i leave it off for 5-10 minutes and turn it on after , it 'll keep running .
