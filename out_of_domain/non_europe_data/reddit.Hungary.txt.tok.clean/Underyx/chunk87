  - they could prepare the player for real life scenarios such as fighting the player for the courier , intentionally feeding if the player does n't drop a bottle mid , and so on, 
  - they should send chat wheel messages in random languages so the player learns how to recognize those words in each one, 
  ## discuss below, 
  goddammit amd . 
  i 'll just go ahead and sticky a submission for this for a day or two , as we 've seen a whole bunch of posts and comments from people with exactly this problem . 
  go , do the thing , everyone !, 
  what bitcoin users should understand is that they are going up against people who have lived their whole lives and whose ancestors passed down hundreds of years of traditions and cultural norms regarding food . 
  when you introduce something completely knew and ( culturally ) unknown into your diet like bitcoin , and especially when you go all out and make it close to 100 % of your diet , that makes people naturally fearful and uncomfortable . 
  so instead of getting mad or annoyed i would recognize that it 's human nature for people to be skeptical and distrustful of something new that they do n't understand . 
  i would also recognize that it 's your own choice to eat what you want and that you should n't let other people 's prejudices or ignorance surrounding food get to you . 
  what they think does n't matter . 
  i do n't eat bitcoin so that other people will approve of my diet . 
  i eat bitcoin because i want to be healthier and i think that bitcoin is a good tool to help me accomplish that . 
  hey there !, 
  i 'll keep this short , as most of the survey is pretty self-explanatory . 
  go ahead , [ fill out our survey over here ] ( https://underyx.typeform.com/to/gizybl ) , and post a comment with any suggestions , requests , or complaints you happen to have about the subreddit . 
  cheers !, 
  ** edit : ** [ the results are in !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/androidwear/comments/3rncqe/meta_the_results_are_in_for_our_randroidwear/ ), 
  first of all , thank you guys so much for all the feedback !, 
  for anyone who 's curious about the results , they are available here : https://underyx.typeform.com/report/gizybl/dixx, 
  and now , here 's all the changes we 're going to make :, 
   what kind of content do you think should be disallowed on the subreddit ? 
  each answer that was checked by over 50 % of the responses will be disallowed as per our new rules . 
  this means that we will start actively removing the following posts once we 've written up clear rules about them :, 
  - personal posts, 
  - non-android wear wearable content, 
  - jokes and memes, 
  and here 's a fun fact : i added ` android wear news ' as an option to help identify responses that might not need to be taken seriously . 
  we had 4 people check that :d, 
   would you like to see weekly discussion threads of any of these ? 
  again , over 50 % was needed for any of these to pass . 
  your requests regarding this were loud and clear . 
  starting next week , we will have weekly stickied threads for apps and watch faces . 
   what kinds of comments would you like to see more heavily moderated ? 
  since they got over 50 % of the respondents vote for their ban , comments that are obviously irrelevant to the discussion will now be removed by moderators . 
  offensive content will however stay untouched -- i 'm actually glad to see that us moderators wo n't have to draw a line for this , you 'll get to use your own votes to do that instead . 
   how long would you like comment scores to be hidden ? 
  the most popular answer was no score hiding , so we 're leaving the setting like it is now . 
   how much would you like the mod team to work on each of these ? 
  we will get to work on the wiki first , and focus more on categorizing posts . 
  the subreddit 's design will stay a while longer , since a redesign did n't seem too important to most of you . 
   in general , are you satisfied with the mod team 's current work and level of involvement on the subreddit ? 
  d'aww , 
  ... and that 's it !, 
  we will revisit these questions in a while , and we 'll see how you will have liked the changes . 
  we 've also received a few suggestions that were n't covered by the survey ; the plan is to have these in another survey with simple yes/no questions later on , where we 'll decide what to do about those . 
  cheers !, 
  please try and keep most of the discussion about this new update in the comments below instead of starting new threads !, 
  feel free to post any news though , of course ; this is only a replacement for discussion-only threads/self posts . 
  also , here , have an faq :, 
  ### is it out yet ? 
  well , when i wrote this , no . 
  i ca n't promise i 'll be here right after release to edit this answer though , so if you 're really impatient , keep checking https://www.reddit.com/r/androidwear/new/ . 
  ### when will it be released ? 
  we have no idea !, 
  ### what are the changes going to be ? 
  here 's a [ changelog ] ( http://9to5google.com/2015/11/08/android-wear-1-4-change-log-battery-life-graph-6-0/ ) by 9to5google . com . 
  ( thanks , / u/sirrelevant ! ), 
  ### can i install this update if my device is rooted ? 
  no , sadly , you 'll most likely have to unroot it before installing it . 
  ### which watches are going to receive this update ? 
  so far , each model is on the latest version , and there have been no word of discontinued support from any of the manufacturers , so it 's likely that marshmallow will also make its way onto the earliest devices as well . 
  ### how long after release will marshmallow be available on my watch ? 
  if you would like to take a guess on that based on historical data , see [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/androidwear/comments/36c6xt/firmware_upgrade_rollout_history/ ) with the previous release dates for each device .

  if i recall correctly this is looped for a while , slowly intensifying for a looong time ( over a minute , for sure . ), 
  at one point the song goes silent but starts up again with this same exact melody . 
  it was played in a mix by marco grenier at a jean-michel jarre concert today .

  and my wishlist : http://steamcommunity.com/id/underyx/wishlist, 
  i literally do n't have anything else to say about the topic , but automoderator removes my post unless i add something here . 
  [ removed ], 
  know that the switch will be the best thing ever before most people . 
  buy nintendo stock before release, 
  spend $ 300 on the switch, 
  sell your stock a month later at a $ 25 gain per share . 
  why is no one reporting on * this * ? 
  i only bought two shares but now my switch was practically just $ 250 .
