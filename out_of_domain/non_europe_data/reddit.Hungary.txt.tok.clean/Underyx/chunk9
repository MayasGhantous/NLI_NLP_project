  fun fact : `` hello vil\u00e1g '' means hello world in hungarian . 
  also , til failotron is hungarian .

  also , i 'm glad to see that i might as well have the most karma in hungary . 
  oh , wow , sorry , something made me think you wrote about trying sending it to a telenor.hu address . 
  i should have paid more attention :d,

  ( it was the same when i jumped onto the google tv beta application site from the google i/o live stream * reeeeeeally * excited . ),
