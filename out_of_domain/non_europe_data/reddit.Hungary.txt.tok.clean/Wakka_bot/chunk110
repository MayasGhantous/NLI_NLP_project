  so , what i think is that the website ( so the program ) is legit , not sure about snoopeh though . 
  browsing through the other participants it looks real , but i dont know where snoopeh got the votes from . . and if he really wanted to go to space , reddit would helped him get votes no ? 
  anyways , if the website is real i wouldnt think he would get to the front of votings with some sort of agreement and i dont think he would do it for an aprils joke either . 
  is that . . a rammus ? 
  well he goes to boot camp there too i guess . . ? 
  yeah i read further , i got it now  . < fucking words, 
  ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ bad ^ ^ ^ pun, 
  but . . where ? 
  here ? 
  does that mean reddit has a very short attention span ? 
  there we go , i dont watch that , 
  thanks for the info, 
  well he would know this space hing beforehand , so i think for sure he would either have time in china or the bootcamp has something to do with it . 
  because , if you look on his fb page he kinda held this space thing info back for a while, 
  uhum . 
  just like a big yellow piece of paper can make you immobile for 2 seconds :d, 
  we are assuming a lot of things here we dont surely know , i think if i would continue to speculate i would care too much . 
  lets just wait until snoopeh himself sorts it out . 
  who called me, 
  ~ ~ bork does 60 physical damage bonus , wits does 42 while both have same as , if you buy bork instead of wits you pay 1000 gold for 18 dmg per hit and some lifesteal ? 
  better buy wits + cutlass , that way you get 7 more damage and 3 % less lifesteal , i think its worth it . ~ ~ ( nvm im retarded , didnt count the 25 ad on bork , sorry - bork is more costefficient ), 
  also , madreds has 25 % chance to do 300 dmg , while wriggles have 500 with sama chance . 
  madreds is 700 g while the upgrade is 900 g , so assuming you have madreds which passive is statistically 75 dmg per hit , the wriggles is 115 ( it gives 15 ad ) so you get 40 dmg per hit , worth of 40 ad , for 900 g , compared to a pickaxe : 25 dmg for 875 . 
  i 'd say the wriggles is worth it because of the lifesteal . 
  however , i tried to solo it with wriggles + lizard , at min ~ 18 ; didnt work . 
  i think lizard was a waste . 
  what im saying is that with the wriggles and wits i think ww needs more as , maybe maxing w ? 
  plus some cdr + as item , stinger maybe ? 
  brb testing it :d, 
  fuck you . 
  how did you get the job ... is the most important question i think :9, 
  just ran 2 testgames . 
  with madreds + spirit stone + bork + double buffs at 15:00 i wasnt able to do it . 
  besides the farm i fbed graves bot and took 2 towers , i guess that simualtes some gank + global gold . 
  i failed . 
  though i bought glacial and a cloth plus and managed to solo it at 20:30 . 
  note i wason my level 12 smrf so i had no runes . . 
  right now im testing if i can do it without madreds, 
  18 : 39 death at baron with spirit stone , bork and glacial , only blue and no boots . 
  sooo -- nope, 
  wriggles bork wits vamp is more than 7.5 k. 
  my goal is to solo it at 15 min . 
  there is no way you can farm 7.5 k until 15 min lol, 
  edit : if you look at comments , im constantly testing , my record is 20:30 with glacial cloth madreds pririt stone and bork . 
  yeah i did it with madreds glacial spirit sone and bork at 20:30 , i didnt want to take many towers to keep it realistic . 
  although im sure there is another way in fact im about to post update, 
  update !!, 
  managed to solo baron at ** 18:30 ** with madreds , spirit stone , glacial and ** nashors tooth ** . 
  yes . 
  motherfucking nashors tooth . 
  i 'm spamming custom games for 5 hours to test this shit and forgot that you dont need lifesteal because you get so much life back with q , so why not get some ap into the mix ? 
  however i was overcapping cdr with blue so im about to leave glacial , buy some armor item ( a tabi maybe ) and test again . 
  ( edit : i took only 2 towers , even died once to shyvana bot  . < but killed her once ), 
  died at ~ 16 min with spirit stone , nashors tooth , madreds and 2 cloth . 
  doesnt work yet :(, 
  yes , madreds gives me average 75 magic dmg per hit for an awesome 700 g price , which is amplified by spirit stone 20 % . 
  sadly the uniq 10 true dmg per hit is wasted but according to my calculations its worth it . 
  i dont know , i would hit pardon but `` tribunal is working as intended guys its 90000 % efficient '', 
  also i strongly doubt it will last more than one day , lol, 
  as soon as i get my hands on an account with runes i 'll test it out with them . 
  maybe it should shake up things a little , i dont think ww needs so much as items , if i can get a generic as page then maybe i can swap the nashors for something even more costeffective, 
  by costeffective i mean warwick doesnt really benefit from it fully . 
  ( i mean , in every situation - not just vs baron . . i wan na solo baron with `` real '' items ) i 've been experimenting with a spirit vidage + chainvest lately but i still need attackspeed from somewhere . . no runes kinda hurts lol . 
  i dont think so , ap increases your sustain but so does visage . 
  you dont need to rape baron just kill it , if you last twice as long you can have half the damage if you know what i mean . 
  i figured you will need resistances at baron , just to stay alive , both magic and armor . 
  no matter how hard your damage is , baron has shittons of hp so you need both defense and sustain . 
  so i would go visage + chain vest with spiritstone + madreds and then have shit tons of attackspeed runes + some item for as , maybe a dagger is enough . 
  too bad i cant realistically test it as my main acc is ehm . . `` unaccessible '' until 7th, 
  what i figured out , is as long as you got cdr maxed and some resistances you can build either way . 
  its just that madreds is so good damage for so cheam that makes us think as is the way to go . 
  you dont `` lose '' the 10 per hit if you upgrade to wriggles , as it has a bigger chance to do bigger damage at proc . 
  although the upgrade is not worth it . 
  700 gold for 85/hit average and the upgrade is 900 gold for 55 more counting the 15 ad . 
  nooo ... just not worth it , better buy a blasting wand so you do more dmg with q ( although probably not so much more but at least you sustain 80 % of it which is pretty valuable vs baron . 
  i guess lifesteal doestn really work as sustain vs baron since he reduces your ad . . onhits like madreds/wits or spells do work though . 
  i dont know man , 2 dorans , a spirit stone a tabi and a bork is 5700 gold , i dont think i can farm it in the jungle . 
  besides , instead of 2 dorans madreds is much better . 
  even if you got spirit stone , you get 75 dmg per hit for free , for 700 gold . 
  but ninja tabi is a good idea . 
  also bork is a shit item vs baron , it gives ad which goes to waste since his debuff , its the same reason i dont get wriggles . 
  not to mention 3200 g is a fuckton . 
  nahh . . either as/onhit or ap the way to go , both maxing cdr ofc . 
  i know ... im speaking of a situation if you only had madreds and upgrade it, 
  died at 18 min with madreds spirit stone tabi nashors tooth and seekers armguard but i almost got it !!, 
  damn if only i had ap runes ... got ta test it out , 100 ap is considerable damage increase as q is 275 base and has 1:1 ratio . 
  will continue testing tomorrow , i think i will collect info soon, 
  proc damage is magic though . 
  and it is mutiplied by butcher ( tested ) . 
  the 10 true damage on spirit stone doesnt get amplified only , thats not a big waste ( 2 true dmg per attack ), 
  level 13 on my smurf , all defensive mastery except 2 in attackspeed iirc, 
  its 2600 gold and doesnt provide cdr , the thing is that after you buy spirit stone + madreds you have circa 3300-3600 gold to buy some defense , 20 % cdr and something to `` kill baron '' . 
  if you spend it all on bork baron kills you , if you spend it on visage + chainmail you dont have enough damage so baron kills you later . 
  rageblade + bluepot + chainmail seems legit , but i dont think i wan na build rageblade on warwick in a normal game . 
  yeah i had blue buff with every attempt ( 14 attempts so far ), 
  yeah at average its 11k ( 8800 +140 / min , exactly 10900 at 15:00 ) when i approach him at about ~ 15:30, 
  i managed to solo it already at 18:30 , he does it at like 18:00 anyways its old bork . 
  you can see warwick gains like 70 hp every attack with it , doesnt work tthis way now sadly :(, 
  might wan na test out wriggles spirit stone tabi and glacial , maybe the 900 gold or wriggles update is justified by not having a better alternative . 
  probably , i take 2 more towers than usually ( total 3 at 14 min ) so i guess it balances out in gold value,
