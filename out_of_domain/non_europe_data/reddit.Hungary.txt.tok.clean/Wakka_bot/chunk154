  i can understand you though , one thing i repect in germany is that people are so open-minded and rational there . 
  perhaps its the prerequisite of the technological and economical advance they have . . fuck , they pay most of the other euro nations aid !, 
  the e-25 . 
  i love that tank so much i have an 590 % crew in it . 
  now imagine ... 
  the accent . 
  the attitude . 
  the weather . 
  and the fact that they have a royal family that they love ( even thoguh i 'm sure they dont really have any power ), 
  but mostly the accent ( and slang . ), 
  well , i 'm planning to leave this shithole called hungary , and currently thingking about another country to live in , england is first ( because i speak the language , duh ) . 
  you think i shouldnt live there ? 
  t49 is not a good vehicle to learn the game on . 
  play the kv1 itself is what i would suggest . 
  no to mention :, 
  - ** there is absolutely no need for gold ammo ever ** , you can pen any tier 8 frontally , well maybe not from 400m but if you are shooting is3 frontally from 400m you are doing it wrong , there are plenty of opportunities to flank . 
  therefore the tank is an excellent credit earner . 
  ( edit : to pen is3 frontally with this thing you need to overmatch the roof armor at the middle , its 20 mm only and you have 76mm gun , just enough ), 
  - did i mention no need for gold ? 
  you can scout in tier 10 matches , that camo ** is better than a 1375 and the gun is essentially the same except you have a 60-clip `` autoloader '' ** . 
  you can pen a lot of things with regular ammo if you flank properly : i killed fv4202 , t57 heavy ( ammoracked him lol ) , is7 , deathstar , gwe100 , 261 , and wte100 with this tank , so its doesnt even need the pref mm it has , in fact i think its better in higher tier games if you wan na farm credits , because ** you can just passive scout for massive emounts of credits ** and xp . 
  the pref mm only `` helps '' if you wan na farm wn8 , and even for that you dont need any gold ammo . 
  - it 's fast enough to ( out ) maneuver , to get into key positions first and to get into surprise positions in lategame . 
  simply driving it is a blast ; the only two other tanks i dont mind `` only driving '' is the pz . 
  1c and the t49 . 
  feels like a rally game in the first 30-50 second of the match :d, 
  ew ... no . 
  way too much dpm , we would steal damage and spot xp ( and wn8 ) from each other . 
  my good friend / u/me0fcourse , who plays only arty , toon sometimes , he uses tier 8 or 9 arty , it works perfectly . 
  yup !, 
  pffft , dont even talk about release vlad . . warmogs gave him something like 90 ap, 
  oh look , someone with akali flair talkst about stacking revolvers ... 
  yeah , remember the cleaver fiasco ... that proves your point , kind of . 
  that might be because the b1 apcr has only 90 pen :(, 
  it has a better gun lol, 
  spam apcr , that pen is shit, 
  why can teemo blind lee sin ? 
  thats pard of the autoattack animation , with this logic mf shoudl reload her pistols too, 
  not to mention he can slide 2 meters forward just like taking a step, 
  ye but what i mean is that it would be cool that mf , after every autoattack , takes a bullet out of her pocket and put it into the pistol , like ashe takes an arrow out of her quiver . 
  i dont think so , if its a prem it has to get some extra quality for the lack of other qualities . 
  for example for the lack of pen it has to have good dpm or accuracy or speed or something . 
  i expect around 8-11 rof like on the jagdpanzer iv and it should be a tier 6 tank imo . 
  the 3001p, 
  oh , i completely forgot we are talking about xbox here . 
  still , i could see it as a t6 non-pref mm medium , with decent rof , something like the schmalturn with less pen more alpha, 
  obviously . . somethign like 8-9 is what i 'm assuming . 
  certainly a lot better , looking forward to another post 3 years later , you have potential, 
  i think thats the 64 you are speaking of . 
  aim time is so bad you arent going to snipe from a distance where camo would matter imo . 
  crosspost this to / r/justiceporn, 
  and nunu , but mid nunu is . . meh, 
  essence reaver , last whisper , triforce , shiv and two ie-s with 20 % crit from runes . 
  get chunked every 3 secs for 1-2k, 
  i chose it over bt because it also gives 80 ad and lifesteal while giving 10 % cdr . 
  you are an one trick pony with crit build so i wanted to sneak some cdr in with the `` max dmg max crit '' build . 
  10 % or 20 % lifesteal doesnt really matter in the lategame where you crit for 1.2 k anyways . 
  i run 9/0/21 in order to have some more cdr ( 32 % total - 10 from mastery , 10 from runes , 10 from blue ( pot ) , and 2 % at level 18 , since to accumulate 20 % crit form runes you can leave out 2 blues which you can replace with cdr per level . 
  ) , movespeed , gold and potions and farm , farm farm ... 
  and a big step towards a writing career perhaps !, 
  hell no you cant , furor boots and you are done . 
  aslo he can build mallet + bork, 
  nice to see you again , 
  yea , my t49 commander jumpre from 495 % to 522 % while the others jumped only 4 % ( to 499 % ) so i can confirm, 
  need some stress relieve ... frontin is not enough of an antidepressant . 
  i just hup in my t49 and start spamming apcr for lulz, 
  yup , better have the tank elited and the accelerate crew tarining enabled . 
  im planning to build a brit med crew from the second 75k  accordingto my calculations , that crew is on about 270 % they might gain a whole new skill, 
  i pen kv4s frontally in my e25 whenever i want . 
  which means a chi.ri can , too . 
  they were probably just tomatoes ? 
  or you wiggled your mantlet, 
  is3 is decent with the 100mm you can unlock it on the is i tihnk . 
  something something annie, 
  it is probably performing poorly because more bad players playing it . 
  the t-34 is a statpadding tank ... definitely a keeper, 
  youi are implying player and gamer are the same . . 
  and mid in the cleaver meta :d,
