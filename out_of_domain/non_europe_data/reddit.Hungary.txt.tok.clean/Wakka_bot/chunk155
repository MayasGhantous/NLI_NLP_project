  i got steel wall , spartan , cool-headed , top gun and kolos in one game . 
  took 6k potential damage :d, 
  lol, 
  got 300 + hits in a row with my pz1c , get on my level, 
  there is a section in this article titled `` best wn8 tanks per tier '', 
  sure . 
  complete with jpeg compression artifacts ? 
  elise has 130 % iirc, 
  spellshield the spears :d, 
  i suiscouted all the xp in it . 
  didnt care , had a swap tank when i grinded it for the is6 . 
  and not able to get in aa range , ever, 
  imagine those kayle ults on soraka lol, 
  yea but in order for her to spam w she has to hit every q as soon as it gets off cooldown , so her `` combo '' would look like that : silence a few enemy , hit them for like 200 with q , heal yourself for like 300 ( i guess on myx level ) , . . and bam you can click w twice more wooooo, 
  doesnt worth it . 
  well she could go only armor / mr items like frozen heart or athenes/abyssal , maybe ga ( hurr durr i spammed w too much now im dead , oh wait ... im not ! ), 
  no because you could spam it on low hp levels for almost free with the flat return on q, 
  so soraka start would be something like rejuv bead + wards +5 hp pot ? 
  sounds broken, 
  not if you take the base hp into consideration . 
  if you go 0/9/21 you can basically heal the cost back with a potion 4 times . 
  redpot full ad malz mid . 
  do nothing but last hit and push , jungler comes for free kill . 
  pop red , cast all 3 spells , get voidling to eat them . 
  did it a few times on plat 4 to 2 . 
  the 85 mm has epic he shell so why use the 122 at all ? 
  if he has 7k gold he better buy a su-122-44 . 
  spershing is shit . 
  yes it has higher ammo cost , but fires with higher fire rate for double the damage , so essentially you will do more damage with it . 
  therefore earnign more credits . 
  goodluck earning meaningful credits in a tier 9 game on el halluf with the spersh . 
  please ... that chart changes every day . 
  plus , it takes the entire playerbase as a sample and we are ( at least i am ) talking about decent gameplay here . 
  this is how you remind me, 
  you forgot / s ( to avoid poe 's law ), 
  vic is meh , the te-ke though , has the features of japanese tanks , so with some gold ammo its really nice crew trainer , though there is not really a choice which light tank crew you want because the highest light is tier 4 , and that is about the only light you wan na play ( or keep , rather ), 
  better dpm and camo than the wte100 , and is faster somewhat . 
  only lacks in gun depression department . 
  i also had wte100 but sold it after about 50 games . 
  `` hi , im an arl v39 , except i have armor and a turret , and less weakspots , and more hp '', 
  you can try it yourself . 
  runes : ad red and quints , choice yellows ( hp/lvl or armor , or whatever ) , ap blues . 
  masteries 30/0/0 coz u cheese . 
  if you have nothing to dump points to , movespeed helps in utility , so if you dont plan on going ap you can uncheck spellsword and spell weawing e.tc . 
  and get 2 points in movespeed etc. 
  level 1 , press q in fountain once and buy redpot or dorans . 
  go to lane . 
  last hit only with auto , and harass with q auto . 
  preferably when the jungler comes you will have your lane pushed to you , and you will have the passive ready . 
  you can also all in on level 2 against low armored targets or low mobility/melee . 
  of items : standard ap carry items if you go ap . 
  ad only works against teams with little to no aoe , because you dont want your lings to be killed , but if the enemy has no aoe they tend to ignore them . 
  ad build : basically rush banner of command with another cdr item . 
  there are 2 ways to go from there : mana-tank with tear + fronzen heart , or glass cannon with brutalizer to ad stacking . 
  both ad builds can have locket for mr aura to your lings , but that only helps if the enemy has aoe , because no matter their mr lings gon na die if they are focused . 
  you can get locket for tankiness and utility if no one else buy it though . 
  strat is like this : maintain 1 ling always , and when you get all-ined you are tanky enough to survive the inital burst , then you press all 4 spells , preferably your first ling will get the as bonus at this point , and ult + lings tear the enemy to shreds . 
  one thing to note , malz needs cdr maxed always , especially if you wan na make your ad runes work , so even if you go ap , you need a cdr item like athenes , and a mana item like archangels to spam spells . 
  i frequently counter ad mids like yasuo with malz , and basically use my early game power to rush frozen heart instead of athenes to maintain my power then go straight ap . 
  but at level 3 you will get poked to shreds , or denied so hard they willbe level 4-5 by then , lol . 
  yeah , they can , but with will you do for full levels ? 
  nothing ? 
  adc can poke you down at level 1 so that you have to back . 
  if you cheese bot you better have a level 1 all in perhaps a level 2 max ( this is why ali blitz and j4 xin works ) but if you have to wait 2 levelups just to be able to compete in lane , you are fucked vs. a decent adc . 
  yeah , anecdotal evidence is not evidence , sorry . 
  you should have pointed out that this lane works because even though you have no all in before levl 3 , you can trade well on levels 1-2 . 
  ( although i doubt that , but i have no evidence ) . 
  so basically , for example on a tier 2 tank , my crew will get 1.7 x1 .5 = 2 , 55 times the xp than before ? 
  sweet . 
  sigh . 
  no , because one is battle xp and one is the crew xp multiplier on top of that,
