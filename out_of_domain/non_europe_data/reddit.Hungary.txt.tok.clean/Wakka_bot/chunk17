  in my defense i was ` nt be able tho think of that , because i was sleepy . 
  i guess it 's late now . 
  only eve-nings , 
   when is picking eve not intentional game ruining ? 
  assuming you roam early game , eve is good with skillshot cc comps when your gank is for slowing down the enemy so your brand/xerath etc. 
  can stunlock combo him . 
  winning . 
  where is my stealth rework goddamnit , i dont care about ziggs :d, 
  [ iswydd ] ( http://memeorama.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/i-see-what-you-did-there-rage-face-meme.png ), 
  cuz mac sucks ? 
  and , at least in my country , its like 2x expensive than pc lol, 
  perhaps you dont wan na know ... ot they dont what you to know, 
  . . and they do play it out so no 0-3 cleansweep !, 
  i want to see 5 matches between my two favourite teams :d, 
  hmm mind if i add you ? 
  strange , it says no such user , are you on euw ? 
  just see vods, 
  [ huehuehue ] ( http://memeorama.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/i-see-what-you-did-there-rage-face-meme.png ), 
  please ... please . . genja trolled me once by picking eve but then locking in kennen . . dont make me have a heart attack again lol, 
  snap , i 'm on euw, 
  but then he wouldnt be mvp of game 3 since it wouldnt happen :d, 
  too bad every second sentence was `` he really does '', 
  lol . 
  its like sending brand to support wtf man , ziggs is an ap mid, 
  volibear is bullshit , and vayne is one of the best carries in game . . so vayne, 
  wiith mana/lvl runes and rushing tear , he can be a viable support i think, 
  because shyvana , hell even mundo does his job better ... and they both deal more damage ... 
  edit : well i main eve so i realize i dont have so much right to speak lol . 
  but in common sense , really , there are much better junglers/toplaners than bear , and vayne is the pubstomp champion . . depends if you want fun or not . 
  ( i prefer fun though , i 'd pick voli for playing fun in normals , but for ranked i 'd pick vayne for sure ), 
  we had it way before manually , they just allowed us to do it without hax . . 
  and 30 % more epic, 
  i might be interested in writing , but dont really know what you want , 
  care to describe it further ? 
  her shield reminds me more like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/return_to_castle_wolfenstein_coverart.jpg ), 
  taric lol, 
  i use it on ww when im fed , but that is all, 
  shhh dont spoil my secret, 
  looks like waaaaay too mana hungry . 
  what about endgame mana reliance ? 
  do we have data yet ? 
  ... im on eu and wan na buy him :(, 
  every time i see a support post , they mention that `` we dont do this normally '', 
  lol yes you do . 
  it will probably be so overpriced it won ' worth it i think ... the fnatic one is over 100 euro ... for a mouse ? 
  lol, 
  i prefer having an account on all servers lol, 
  cuz they are hella rich already ? 
  lol, 
  bookmarked for later use :d, 
  did it with tiamat trynd , hehe :d, 
  6 archangels amumu !, 
  ap sona rapes dominion, 
  then tiamat is the best item ? 
  lol, 
  especially on my main :d, 
  yes please . 
  arrrrrgh cut the shit i was being sarcastic for fucks sake, 
  dont buy runes at all until level 30 , you will thank us later, 
  once i got a level 5 ie with mf :d,

  diablo 2 , 17 hors a day , 7 days a week ... shit man , i had a level 99 smiter on bnet . 
  i 'd begin the game with all wards . 
  on all lanes . 
  lol good point, 
  taling about a mid carry . . learn to spare your mana and forget mana regen runes . 
  rule # 4 : focus the fucking carry, 
  rule # 6 : never ever pick eve in ranked - . -, 
  no , rule # 1 should be do not fucking enter solo queue, 
  when i dive onto creeps for a kill , it helps so much, 
  yes, 
  what does that acronym mean ? 
  lol, 
  summoner name related, 
  google is your friend lol, 
  meh , early game autoattacks do considerable amount of damage imo, 
  what pun, 
  lol, 
  sorry , didnt see it , everything i see on that pic is the legs ... , 
  appreciate the classics !, 
  full crit runes, 
  revive smite, 
  sorakabot route, 
  does more damage ... until level 11-13 or so . . end game twitch is the best carry in the game . 
  lux is okay as it is ... end game she is a monster . 
  yes, 
  / thread, 
  yes please,
