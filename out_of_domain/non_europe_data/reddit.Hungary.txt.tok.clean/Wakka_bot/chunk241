  bbwb, 
  bbbw, 
  from what i gathered , there are 16 different draws ( 2 to the 4th ), 
  and 11 of those are winning , so if i take every single 27/54 , 26/53 etc as exacly 50 % as an estimate i get 11/16 as win percentage ( 68.75 % ), 
  ( because you only lose if you get at least 3 whites , so 4 times 3 white and 1 times 4 white = 5 losing cases ), 
  i mean , correct me if i 'm wrong , but 18 % seems a bit too low of a chance to draw 2 blacks , if you draw 4 times . 
  you have exactly 25 % chance to draw 2 black cards if you draw only 2 cards , i dont think it would go lower than that if you draw more . 
  the jokes will never stop . 
  i 'd do jinx, 
  not good times . 
  there was still kassadin . 
  i miss her old w all day :(, 
  yeah we can see it on your belly, 
  level 1 invades with eve , that was the shiet in urf . 
  .3 sec cd on q hmmm, 
  yes . 
  in my opinion , and from what i remember playing from there , the biggest problem was his scaling . 
  didnt matter if you picked talon or panth in lane to shit on him 0/10 in lane . 
  all his team needed to do is to stall for 30-35 minutes and he could still 2shot the carry . 
  then 2 shot someone else 3 seconds later . 
  someone having fun !, 
  quick , shit on their happiness !, 
  that is not how you respond to legit criticism . 
  insecure much ? 
  i wasnt the one who corrected you , dumbass . 
  and trying to belittle me wont work . 
  douchebag ? 
  mate there was nothing wrong with his comment . 
  seems rich from the guy who misspells than, 
  this is one of the reasons im still subbed . 
  good work !, 
  i think you are seeing ghosts , man . 
  stop being so negative !, 
  where else can he correct you other than the place where you committed that mistake ? 
  now you are just making shit up . 
  you misspelled it , its a fact . 
  do n't try to polish a turd - its still a turd . 
  because you were incorrect !, 
  it 's that simple, 
   why correct someone in the first place, 
  so that they dont make the same mistake again ? 
  reminds me of the swedish house mafia videoclip one https://youtu.be/pkq5rejatmk?t=30s, 
  and not trynd ? 
  thing is , when you are spamming recall you are out of the fight . 
  wasnt talking about ad trynda ^ ^, 
  [ black sun empire - breach ] ( https://youtu.be/be6wt300vfw?list=pldcb07f0f3bd98cbf ), 
  from what i have heard on / r/rule34 , ahri is getting it on with everyone . 
  how ignorant . 
  you are missing out on cross-game action my friend . 
  once you get thru the usuals , there are some real good stuff there, 
  isnt that against this subreddit 's rules ? 
  i dont wan na risk it . 
  also , you can search easily, 
  eune gold ( plat in s3 and s5 ) here . 
  gladly answering questions . 
  he and i would have to do the same effort finding it . 
  i 'm not gon na work just because he is lazy to search . 
  easy , watch without sound and lip-read ... 
  `` you 're all clear kid , now let 's blow this thing and go home ! '', 
  i watched this movie in hungarian a lot , this line in hungarian translated word-to-word was . . `` goddamnit !, 
  aim at it already and get out !, 
  ironically , all the eve rule34 is utter shit . 
  ( love me some mercy though ), 
  haha yeah i got it on an old vhs from the '90s ( 93 or 94 iirc ) . 
  i saw the new dub as well a few times and it sucks dick compared to the old one . 
  another thing though : i do n't actually remember whether or not the old dub is `` teringett\u00e9t '' . 
  maybe we just played that cassette so much the sound was so unrecognizable at that part . 
  it was our only only 3 - ep 4 , 5 , 6 ) cassette for about 12 years . 
  ~ ~ also , there are 3 dubs , one from 1985 , one from 1995 , and one from 1997 . 
  apparently ( i checked ) we got the 1995 version . 
  by old i mean that . 
  i have not heard the 1985 version . ~ ~, 
  edit : neverfucking mind . 
  the hungarian page i consulted got it all wrong . 
  we indeed had the original version . 
  ( with legendary kr\u00e1nitz as darth vader ) . 
  it was released in 1993 . 
  i leave the errors up for posterity, 
  bullshit , you wrote `` you pay massive money ... for the cars design '' . . you fell for it , admit it, 
  lol i forgot that one . 
  nice catch . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ( also ^ ^ ^ ^ shen ^ ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ ^ assraped ^ ^ ^ ^ lol ), 
  hahahe entitled little shit of the year, 
  `` get off my screen '' like you are too lazy to move your mouse over the ignore button . 
  keep the insults coming though , im having fun :d, 
  i 'm thinking kerrigan, 
  she would be a perfect candidate for a kerrigan-like skin after this vgu . 
  and edward scissorhands, 
  good idea, 
  yes , a soviet tank has a soviet name and and english one , and the english one is the right one . 
  good thinking . 
  wow , so much negativity in this thread . . lol, 
  names are an exception though , i mean my name is p\u00e9ter but you would call me peter wouldnt you ? 
  i think we do . 
  there is no such character to even write down the russian name of the tank , anyways , like you dont have the \u00c9 character . 
  i thought the toxtits are cassio, 
  fuck yes, 
  well she stuns you from 1500 units away , then jumps to you and 100-0 you in 2 sec, 
  bro no need to go all serious on that one, 
  any high-end game .
