  ** tl ; dr : need money . . should i stream ? 
  wish i could recreate this on video ... 
  so i was fountain diving with panth for lulz recently and tried to leapstun the enemy tf . 
  but the nexus exploded faster and mid-jump i was brought to ground immediately ( still tanked 1 laz0rshot ) . 
  are there any other useless fact you cant prove . . for lulz ? 
  lately i 've been thinking about that in my , and possibly a lot others ' mind , especially those who like lol so much , playing a champion is often associated with irl things ( think about dunks ) , but music is the only one ( i think ) that can be used to `` describe '' any champion . 
  i think every champ `` has '' a song , one which can be associated with it , maybe because of the playstyle has same feling as the song , or some reference , or just . . something . 
  i 'm curious ; do you guys think the same , and can you provide examples as well ? 
  i compiled a list of all champs with the music i associate with them , would like to hear yours too !, 
  ( maybe make a full list , 
  ** edit ** : i think some skins can be associated with different songs than the original , will try to provide examples, 
  ** edit2 ** : i dont ' t play all champs , so if you feel one song is not appropiate , feel free to correct me ,

  i like to play warick very much but i dont really know how he fits in s3 meta . 
  so i 've tried playing him like in s2 ( wits , visage , forzen heart , wriggles ) with mixed results . 
  i was wondering if some of you guys figured out how to build warwick ( both solo and jungle ) recently ? 
  also , i think warwick can solo baron quite early in the game . 
  i did it at 28 min ( level 18 ww , with wriggles , spirit of lizard , wits end and botrk and blue buff ) but i think he can do it much earlier . 
  i 'm testing it right now but i was wondering if someone figured it out ? 
  ( like the 15 min duo baron with a nunu maxing q and cdr ala gamerslegends ), 
  cheers, 
  i 'm wakka and i was a toxic player . 
  i told everyone how bad they are , i used curse words and i violated the summoner 's code many times . 
  i got banned 4 times for increasing amounts for that , and i deserved all . 
  since i love this game and i always want to get better , i spent much time getting better at not getting involved in the `` bad things '' gonig in in ranked solo queue . 
  last time i got banned , all my offense was to calling someone a `` dumb shit '' .
