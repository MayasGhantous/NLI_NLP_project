  make it happen !, 
  well , you can buy it on ebay ... 
  jungle gp starting at bloodthirster-vamp scepter-wriggles-cloth armor :d, 
  sadly , else i would n't `` had to '' buy the officer one :d, 
  no , i mean , his judgement sense may help to develop a good champion , that 's all . 
  eating oranges after any towerdive , regardless of my hp . 
  imagine my situation ... 
  nasus shits on gp ... 
  and kog, 
  gm bob ? 
  it 's a hard thing to organize and build up , but once it 's done ... nothing will stop it . 
  very good idea , just needs a shitload of thinking and planning . 
  you should contact to coachers imo . 
  at least a couple of them, 
  search ebay ... 
  good to hear uplifting stories , just lost a game when our cait went godlike feed  gl hf is here for a reason . 
  i just push all day , every day , where i can , when i can . 
  / ignore all like a boss . 
  did you ever kited with her ? 
  it 's amazing . 
  i 'm a rune freak , i think i have about 70 % of the tier3 runes ... dodge was a must-have but i did n't played too much bruisers/tanks/jax so i was like `` okay , i will get it someday , when i will have the ip '' . 
  to my luck i still do n't have them :d, 
  umm except me :d, 
  jungle graves is op !, 
  what 's wrong with boobs ? 
  that 's not too wrong ... :d, 
  guess who !, 
  he probably meant someting like 4 phantom dancers and a boots of swiftness ... 
  when to pick trundle . . 
  when udyr is banned !, 
  that 's too much crit % . 
  better 2 pd and an ie . + boots, 
  solotop , i like farming and then owning late game with 1k crits . 
  at very very late game , when you have too much gold on your hands , on an autoattacker like vayne you may want to max 2 things : crit and as . 
  with the option of having as much ad as you can . 
  2 pd is a must if you dont have boots . 
  then add ie + atma for 98 % crit , and then 2 items for defense . 
  i 'd go for mallet and banshee . 
  i think its a good build to have at 60 min ... 
  more people play eve than corki ? 
  wtf ? 
  but with decent items ? 
   google grassyhyren on youtube, 
  wtf ? 
  yeah i know dude , i mained eve for like 6 months :d just dont play her anymore . 
  when someone rages me over the internet i almost always reply `` trololol umadbro ? '', 
  even though i dont talk `` bro '', 
  alien heimy has only recolored head and a new joke in the same voice - . -, 
  i use rarely :, 
  * triforce atmogs eve, 
  * as/proc twitch, 
  * as/crit twitch, 
  but mostly ( 80 % ) ap trist . 
  take my money !!, 
  take it and shut up, 
  custom games, 
  well , thats what they told me . 
  but anyways , i fond a guy with elo on pbe lol :d, 
  what you did there ... 
  i see it !, 
  you grammarnazi !, 
  gtfo !, 
  ... just kidding, 
  he does play graves solotop . 
  upvote for just that word . 
  nope , thats the plural of gragus, 
  * singed, 
  must have on hyrid champs like teemo kayle and maybe kog ? 
  if it doesnt break stealth then i will use it on eve also . 
  early game it will be awesome, 
  ... you said `` i 'd lik to play urgot '' and other guy said `` i 'd like to play akali '' and then the captain bans both . 
  evelynn . . used to faceroll people when she had stun . 
  now only playing it in normals , for fun . 
  why ? 
  i like to lurk , striking fear into the enemy team , outzoning 3 lanes at once , cause suspicion and panic . 
  also , tits . 
  haha rainman : username related ? 
  i will totally laugh at the increased number of failflashes incoming :d, 
  the second i log in with the new patch im going to try out . . yeah guess what champ :d, 
  it 's common everywhere i think , when i introduce myself as wakka they will call me wakka , whatever i tell them later what my real name is . 
  i 've been in several irl groups that were organized on the net and we call each other in their `` nick `` s , even if we ar `` friends in facebook '' or something . 
  trist , ez and mf are also good ap , though ap mf is hard and ap trist is basically a lichbane + dfg burst assasin . 
  go in , get 4k dmg on the carry , go out . 
  nice idea , dont think it will happen though . 
  triforce + guardian angel + banshees, 
  want :d, 
  yeah, 
  ask for a sdk and make them mapz !, 
   fiddle around, 
  i see what you did there :d, 
  sion ( fuck this op shit ), 
  morgana ( fuck this op shit ), 
  talon ( im playing too much solotop lately , only solotop i cant really counter ), 
  ] ( http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/219/dafuq.jpg/ ), 
  too late man . 
  start at red with pull . 
  go armor yellows and everything else is as or maybe mspd quints if you prefer . 
  get expunge , cast it on red when 6 stack . 
  once you are level 2 start roaming 24/7 . 
  can start with boots +3 pot , or maybe new masteries get you a mana pot also .
