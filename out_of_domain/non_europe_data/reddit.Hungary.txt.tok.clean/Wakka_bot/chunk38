  currently she is very weak , you have to rune properly and build properly to be useful in the game . 
  can be played in various ways but i would say triforce + ga is core in almost all builds . 
  i play her as a jungler , but she can be played as a roamer/counterjungler or maybe sometimes at top , vs easy matchups like akali . 
  almost all of the junglers/roamers/tops outclass her in many ways so you either have to be really good compared to ppl you play with , or master the champion to learn how to minimie the weaknesses and maximize the strengths ( for example the whole stalking-while-invisible thing , the ganks , how to get around oracles and shit ), 
  i 'd say : he is viable in all levels if you devote a long time to master the champion . 
  you decide if it 's worth it ... 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_921821&amp;src_vid=dvsyhpz8t4s&amp;feature=iv&amp;v=fm3tbjdvao0 ) are some advanced tricks you can pull off with eve nowadays , it 's part 2 of a series , go back to part 1 for general info . 
  edit : eve also requires very high patience and tolerance to withstand the enourmous amounts of rage you get , just by picking her, 
  i disagree . 
  very useful in teamfights if you can ultilze the ult 's passive , but that takes skill to master . 
  also yet it may look killsteal but early game she has unmatched damage and needs kills to get ahead ; and she is good at it . 
  not really , needs mana , huehue, 
  and do no damage . 
  btw how you get those champ pictures to comments ???? 
  teemo always happy . . 
  maybe high on shrooms _ d, 
  idea 2 : better corki 's passive ? 
  but you dont plan on dying dont you ? 
  [ ] ( / evelynn ) thank you . 
  more like mordekaiser huehuehue, 
  that is how i play all my champions :d, 
  hm ... skarner 's q is 3.5 second cd , evelynn 's q is 0.8 sec . . no i dont think so , 
  also hate spike has a much higher range ( on the second bounce , that is ), 
  and an overall higer dps ratio as you build a lot of ap on her whereas skarner is not exactly an ad stacking champion . 
  i literally counldnt play my first game as bb riven because i couldnt stop staring at the model - . - luckily it was dominion and i got carried :d, 
  he is a motherfucking blood lord !, 
  although i admit renekton is more pimp . 
  i wish flash range wouldnt troll me that much  . <, 
  sometimes i get used to a champion too much if i play it in like 3-4 games in a row , that in the next game i 'm pretentidnt to play the previous chamion . 
  for example accidentally leveled q on jungle shaco first because i played 4 jungle eve games before  . < i wish i would overcome that, 
  well not exactly ap , more like hybrid , but you buy a lot of ap on her . 
  triforce , rageblade , gunblade and probably some ap form runes and masteries . 
  mr runes , some armor , and spam that q , even in shroud . 
  also , can win trades with minion advantage utilizing passive, 
  also i go 0/21/9 on eve if i go top . 
  garen, 
  shits on riven imo . 
  i already picked him up to prepare for the riven storm :d, 
  nice try again ... attention whore, 
  edit : sorry we are kind of more intelligent than gd or 4chan, 
  oh come on . 
  like the internet were all about generosity . 
  ignite . 
  hehe , exactly . 
  [ my reaction ] ( http://www.aaanything.net/wp-content/gallery/weekend-fun/thumbs/thumbs_sponge_bob_hold_on_im_searching_for_a_fuck_to_give.jpg ), 
  neither would yorik ? 
  lol, 
  also glass cannon ap nunu is fail , build him ap-offtank and it 's all ok . 
  which one was the hardest ? 
  you mean 1.5 ad carry . 
  also , let 's just not talk about how a good nunu ulti can change the game ... and i was talking about a shut-down yorik . 
  she did even fake the tibbers summon animation ... nut sure if unintentional or pro play . . , 
  that 's apb , not abp, 
  i wont start an argument here . . mainly because of i saw your username lol, 
  meh , considering that every other champ got a skill taken , it 's ok , you can slow and fling . 
  suddennly , it 's a shittier verison of ezreal, 
  i love it . . but yours is better deejay uzuh :d, 
  ** the community !!, 
  they are awesome **, 
  ^ please ^ stop ^ hitting ^ me . . ^ please ... ^ noo . . ^ it ^ hurts, 
  and sadly , more that one fuck was given, 
  welcome to soloqueue , enjoy your stay . 
  what a dick are you , im bursting of laughter, 
  mantheon of course . 
  karma doesnt even worth the ip lol, 
  teenager ... not even close baby, 
  i know your feel ~ ~ bro ~ ~ sis . 
  at least she is useful  . <, 
  oh i derped on that one sorry  . <, 
  in my defense i dont use english words literally because mainly my english knowledge come from `` watch and learn '', 
  evelynn , in exactly 374 ranked games ; about 42 % winrate total, 
  ( mostly season 1 though , had 52 % winrate there , season 2 i played warwick the most : 109 ranked games , 50 % winrate ), 
  too pussy to play ranked trololo, 
  eve , could 1shout people within the duration of her stun . 
  i got owned by eve 's when i was low level so hard i decided to play her  ( also loved the playstyle ), 
  later on vlad was the definition of op, 
  oh , and fucking mordekaiser . 
  oh my god how many games i lost because we let him freefarm  . <, 
  only if you have high base damage on skills to offset the lack or deathcap i guess . 
  triple warmogs at the end ... 
  welcome to splitpush hell, 
  this is so good it needs to become a series . 
  heal applies a debuff as well , you know ... 
  not me , i was just suspecting op meant the triple warmogs when he mentioned troll mundo in the post title . 
  the problem is , you dont really maximize ap on soraka ( rarely even buy deatchap ) so lichbane will not be as effective as on - say - lux . 
  but speaking of effectiveness , mordekaisers often get lichbane , so why not ? 
  actually , i think midraka has a very simiar build to mordekaiser ( rylais + wota unarguably core on both ), 
  i 'd say it 's situational . 
  you buy it for burst damage . 
  if you are tanky enough it 's ok . 
  i always decide on what item to buy by analyzing the last fight : figuring out how i can deal more damage in the next : by buying tankiness so i can deal more sustained damage , or by buying more flat out damage . 
  guess it works as a last item anyway , but for late game i tend to finish the build with ga on soraka , so if they burst me down i can burst-heal myself back to full with triple heal ( i run ghost heal on soraka mid ) . 
  wtf ? 
  i 's the chinese client art . 
  there is only one champion in what its viable on . . and that champion is not viable itself . 
  anyone who writes a team here is probably under 18, 
  scarra ( when he is not streaming , then dye44 ), 
  3 . scyx17, 
  guardsman bob, 
  ( used to watch hsgg , dyrus and sv more often , but they do n't commentate at all and i got bored after the 20th dyrus vlad game ... ),
