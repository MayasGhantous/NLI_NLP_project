  sweet . 
  i hope we get a new dance too , the old aliz\u00e9e impersonation was a bit . . ewwww ... 
  why , i love the hair on the original skin :( am i the only one ? 
  i f you wan na watch kata you might enjoy scarra 's stream , 
  my great-grandmother in '99 was about 90 years old ( do n't remember correctly ) . 
  she lost his husband in wwii , so she was a widow for 50 years . . and had to live with his son ( my grandfather ) 's family . 
  we live faaar from them so we visited them like 2-3 times a year . 
  every time i saw her , she was sitting just outside the house on a very small chair , looking towards the garden . 
  and she did n't say a single word to anybody . 
  throughout the roughly 7-9 years of my visits to her i did n't even know what she sounded like . 
  when my ( sadly ) last visit happened , the `` usual '' course of things happening was to gather the family in the kitchen , everybody lights a cigarette and speak about how bad their situation is . 
  as a kid i felt the `` negative things in the air '' and naturally went out after a while . 
  my younger brothers very small and they did n't really understand anything . 
  so it was me and my great-grandmother outside . 
  all of a sudden she demand me to come closer . 
  i did . 
  she then said : `` i 'll tell you a beautiful story . 
  how i met with my husband . . we met in a wedding . 
  there were gypsy music * ( note : at that village everbody loves gypsy music ) . 
  * he was a very handsome guy and he asked me to [ dance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cs%c3%a1rd%c3%a1s ) with him . 
  we did . 
  she spinned me so hard my skirt reached the [ cimbalom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cimbalom ) . 
  it was the best time of my life '', 
  i 's almost like she both felt i have to hear something happy to cheer me up . . and she felt she needs to get this out of her before she dies . 
  next thing i knew that she died in her sleep the next day . 
  nice manner bro, 
  how is it blackthorn ? 
  where is the thorn ? 
  and it 's not even black anywhere ... 
  everyday story , deal with it, 
  you got the point . 
  however i lack the tools to fight , so i try to `` get a thicker skin '' and try to show a good example of behaviour in games , that is my way of dealing it . 
  currently , we ca n't force the community to get hate on trolls or someting , because 1 . trolls just want attention , hate doesnt change anything , they will continue trolling 2 . see , if we turn against trolls that makes us applying a negative attitude no ? 
  trolls are people too , maybe they just need to get laid or something . 
  hate doesnt counter them . . just try to be erm `` christian '' here ( sorry my english is bad , cant find a better word ) 3 . 
  even if we have a method against trolls the thing of dealing them would be way more energy consuming than its ' worth . 
  just show a good example of behavior , eventually they will feel guilt of harassing you . 
  this aspect of lol is much like life in general . 
  my dad told the story about it when he teached me how to deqal with harassing : one night he was surrounded by bandits who said : `` give us your money or we beat you '' he replied `` i have no money man '' then they said `` give us your clothes then '' he said `` man im so poor these are my only clothes , i 'm as poor as you . . leave me be '' . 
  the talk continued for a while and my father slowly convinced them , ( with `` lovetalk '' not `` hatetalk '' ) that it 's a sin to rob people and even though he lied slightly ( had more clothes etc. ), 
  he managed to turn them away by applying only positive talking and showing good example of behavior . 
  you just have to not lose your mind instantly , like i bet 99,9 % would . 
  listen to war stories where poor townspeople stood against raiding soldiers who wanted to , for example , rape their wives or something . 
  wwii , vietnam , 1956 revolution ( in hungary , where i live ) , balkan wars in '99 etc. 
  i believe i wrote a bit too much , i just needed to get it off me andhope you get my point . 
  good luck dealing with trolls in the future . 
  tl ; dr : please read all of it , can not be shortened without losing context, 
  ap soraka all day every fucknig daaaaay !!!, 
  same with support anivia , wallstun gg . 
  anivia has another stun hueeuheuehuheuehueheueh, 
  except if you play and build her properly , this includes runes . 
  dont even get me started about the most sadomasochist thing to do , its is playing eve hands down, 
  it 's not impossible . 
  one game on scarra 's stream , at that moment he was 2500ish elo , he was against a twitch/evelynn double jungle . 
  his team lost horribly with both ratty and eve getting fed . 
  ( however the twitch player was rincent , twitch mainer for a long time and iirc the eve player was ricest , jungle mainer . . or the other way around ), 
  i can translate this . . yay, 
  inb4 downvotes and hatestorm, 
  not sure if trolling or serious ... 
  good read . 
  although i 'd like to point out that the champ statistics doesnt show that much as expected . 
  for example we see genja having insane records with kennen and urgot . . yet his main is ashe ( alex_ich pointed out in his ama he basically ( on his genja007 account ) climbed up to 2.3 k elo just by playing ashe . ), 
  most of the time it 's electronic music ... dubstep , chillout , dnb , liquid or neurofunk . 
  some examples :, 
  [ my favourite track ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvzij9yjwc ) is liquid, 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru48xfutztg ) gets me in the mood in killing ( warning , a bit hardcore ), 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbdgemcaz-i ) also good for battles ( warning , not for the sensitive ), 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts7kxqzrma&amp;feature=related ) chills me up after a loss, 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj1mqeee4z0&amp;list=flqejg7cwvntg3nzhe_5um1w&amp;feature=mh_lolz ) is my newest find , shivers down my spine , 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5umum1b04q ) features an epic drop at 0:40 also good for chilling games, 
  i 'm also all in for epic music , with [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkblvcsdgy4 ) being my favourite piece ( highly recommend the second drop at 5:40 ), 
  [ aaaaand the obligatory track when playing my main :d ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrj_7yvihnm ), 
  so super secret we know about this for about a month and we all know the name of it too !, 
  point taken, 
  extremely helpful work , keep it up, 
  ( taric flair , no wonder ), 
  riven doesnt need cdr at all . . so red, 
  he was ad carry for eg no ? 
  win, 
  sure im trolling . . look at any decent riven guide man . 
  by any decent riven player . 
  they all say you must start at blue and max cdr cuz its op, 
  we already have a skill named consume and riot is against things having same name ( take the ahri passive fiasco for example ) . 
  other than that , good idea, 
  what is that 4athene thing ? 
  what is that making people support him ? 
  ( many ppl with 4athene ), 
  thank you for sharing , indeed it was a heartwarming story .
