  they both are sustained damage deales so if the fight takes longer and vlad drops low soraka can heal ... 
  not sure about how this will point out but why not . 
  - wont post pics, 
  - male/25 years old, 
  - architecture stundent at university, 
  - i like to play anything , mostly top/mid, 
  - favourite champion is evelynn ( derp . ), 
  besides her , warwick , morde and mf, 
  - interesting personal fact : i have a kind-of obsession of eve , i love to make use of unconventional builds ( ad malz , as/ap mf , ap mundo . . ) and i 'm slightly mazochist ( yeah well i have 340 eve games in ranked lol ) . 
  and i tryhard every game , taking it seriously , looking for improve . 
  and my eye has a black spot in the exact same spot as the minimap . 
  after i bought all the runes i need/will ever use ( besides crit dmg and hp regen for lulz ) i started to buy all the champs with ip . 
  all of the new champs plus 3-4 weekly , so basically i have all the champs ( except nautilus , sejuani , viktor , jarvan , fizz , orianna , renekton and trundle ) . 
  that means i own a shit ton of champs i never played , and i think everyone who played 3k + games has the same thing . 
  about 15-20 games a day . 
  sometimes more , sometimes less . 
  mostly ranked , dom and a few derping around in normals, 
  lol i admit i 'm kind of unsocial irl but i have life !, 
  i 'm an university student after all ... classes , exams , learning , shit like that, 
  dont forget to add this was before the heal buff so genja run flash revive on all carries ... was hilarious to see him dying to golems because it 's a faster way to get home lol, 
  cool story bro , now head over to general discussion, 
  soraka , spam q win lane, 
  no problem . 
  it is very likely to assume i '' have no life '' when i write things like i play 20 games a day . 
  university this year is kinda easy , next year i wont play that much :d, 
  wow , some quality ideas there , nice job, 
  eww . . first of all you dont need more than one phantom and an ie for crit . 
  last whisper is essential for doing any damage late game , you dont need madreds , sou your 2 last item sould be bloodthirster and a defensive item so you dont get instagibbed ( the two best candidates are guardian angel in general and quicksilver sash against heavy cc teams or supression ults ( ww , skarner , malzahar . ), 
  the problem with the second phantom is not that it * not * gives more damage . . it 's that since you have one pd already the added as/crit has lesser gold value . 
  for example you have ie . 
  your crit chance is 20 % , you buy a phantom dancer which boosts it to 50 % , that is an ( 5-2 ) / 2 = 150 % increase in crit chance . 
  now you buy another which gives you 80 % , that is ( 8-5 ) / 5 = 60 % increase in crit chance . 
  basically it 's not wirth the gold , because from the same amounts of gold you can increase your damage output higher !, 
  for example you can buy a ga , which makes you live longer , which means more damage !, 
  or you can buy a bloodthirster , which makes you steal life , staying alive longed = again more damage . 
  think beyond the item values , and you will become a better player , 
  edit : of course , endgame , where movespeed does n't count as much , you can sell your boots to buy another phantom , but that 's another story . 
  came here to say . . opened stream , he wast playing mordekaiser , was disappointed :d, 
  by the way i 'm recently testing the following build on mf :, 
  so far all the games are won by me carrying hard , but it 's only 5 game and i bever reached endgame so i have to test more . 
  but the midgame damage is sick . 
  i see you play assassin 's creed , amirite ?

  evelynn two times . . 
  nah just kidding , udyr seems like the most solid choice,

  how about ahri . . `` uh aaaah ah uh uh aaah '', 
  iswydt, 
  what about champion s that scale with both like nocturne ? 
  strange to read it from you , who can `` surrender '' games at the 2nd minute, 
  you made my day sir, 
  fuck i read that as vlad 's impale . 
  would have been more badass . . 
  something is fucked up , i dont see evelynn anywhere ... 
  underplayed i guess, 
  or just play malphite ... 
  great . 
  even stupid mid is here - . -, 
  nope , if you watch the spectator mode video they specifically say you can spectate `` famous '' games, 
  you have to win their lanes . 
  kill their lane opponents . 
  pick champions that have low cd ult and/or can gank lanes easily ( morde , malz , malphite , hecarim , anivia , akali , karthus , cassio ... 
  if they force you to go support , pick lux or gp and after 1-2 gp10 go full glass cannon ( ap taric also works if you can snowball from very early game ) . 
  just kill a lot . 
  gank all lanes , no matter what your lane are you on . 
  push to enemy tower so they cant farm , then fake recall or something , and go gank their lanes or counterjungle . 
  and dont pick evelynn , seriously, 
  how do you know that ? 
  tthat top lane . . 666 vs 2200 elo . . and she got countered :d, 
  ^ ( yeah i know its not the real numbers , duh ), 
  wan na know if the single ones can add up , so you can have 100 % magic pen or 40 % cdr , would be unbeatable . . or just 786332 ad/lvl on riven , 120 mres on galio . . 
  help me , i dont have a clue about what is the difference between the two my brain melting aaaaaaha, 
  dammit i was carrying hard with ap taric :(, 
  if they watch all scarra 's games ... they lose a shitload of scrim/practice/general time . . 
  i honestly dont see how you thought saint was serious, 
  i find it entertaining . 
  is he like that every time ? 
  cuz then he got a new fan :d, 
  on a side note ap pony is indeed legal , today i won i think 3 rankeds with it :d, 
  or probably he came up with it himself and forgot to use the search function ... 
  lol my favourite will never be free bitches, 
  i 'll be honest i donwvoted too , i want to keep it a secret . 
  imagine if this thread hits front page , everyone will play ap pony :(, 
  bazookabob = guardsman bob, 
  priscent = scarra,
