  what about x-posting it to / r/christianity, 
  i read that in wukong 's voice :d, 
  ewwww lichbane and triforce , my eyes hurt, 
  actually , as an eve mainer ( 700 + eve games ) and build tester/enthusiast i find this guide to be the only reasonable guide existed , the others are saying bullshit like going full ap , buying phantom dancer or going 21/9/0 ... or outdated, 
  everyone , go check out this guide if you want to know how to really play eve . 
  its not that hard , you just have to leave that ap build :d, 
  it 's just `` rough love '' man . . dont take it seriously  in fact i respect you for staying a true evelynn player despite all the hate . . you just have to try out serious ad ( more like hybrid ) based builds , and win with them , lose with them , get a feel of it , because i think it 's awesome < 3, 
  tried of course , found it too mejai reliant ... 
  guess i have to grow balls to use it :d, 
  filled it , hope we can see the result soon , 
  i did . 
  fuck you riot , i feel like menelaos who got his helene stolen ... 
  prepare guinsoo for my troyan horse !, 
  worst ulti is probably eve . 
  you cant build around it because you have other issues , so you end up buying movespeed and as ( triforce , black cleaver , yoyos etc. ), 
  making the ulti useless . . the passive portion is unnoticeable . 
  well , this and probably sion 's . 
  wait a few days, 
  there . 
  do n't exactly remember what one , but at the first few years i jus considered dnb to be `` meh '' . 
  what song instantly made me love it was, 
  [ ** indivision - secret vision ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvzij9yjwc ) . 
  it 's my favourite ever since , 
  other very good tracks that made me love the style even more :, 
  [ ** rihanna - nothing 's changed ( stereotype remix ) ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aoqtbwy_-0&amp;list=pl4b369cd7481972e7&amp;index=10&amp;feature=plpp_video ) ( heard it on a radio1 mix which i downloaded by accident lol ), 
  [ ** memro - trick of the tail ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wo0bdfupqo&amp;feature=bfa&amp;list=llqejg7cwvntg3nzhe_5um1w ), 
  [ ** unquote - grief will never descend from her face ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5umum1b04q ) ( this one still gives me shivers down my spine . . so chill ), 
  build him ap . 
  every single game i had a slightly kassadin-like laning phase but after 20 min all of the enemies were like `` wtf this shit is fucking op '', 
  that is why i play her as ap carry !, 
  rush kages , then deatchap , zhonyas , abyssal , dfg , last item void or rylais depending on situation . 
  it 's like ap amumu ( or zombie karthus ) : you will have so much damage you dont need to be alive so long to rape teamfights . . and you got free wota , 
  i wish i played back then . . 
  i joined when irelia came out , already feel i missed a lot of things :(, 
  i thought the abuse of psa thing ended weeks ago ... 
  mumble , if you can get used to it , it takes a few hours, 
  dust 2 , best map ever, 
  stompbox is also a freaking good track . . 
  i prefer [ the spor remix ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptv-wuiisc ) though , 
  i just have so much to say !, 
  holy fucking shit sir , that track is on repeat right now here ... about the 17th time ... thank you for sharing this masterpiece, 
  holy shit , yes please !, 
  ( i think i found a new favourite artist < 3 ), 
  officer caitlyn came out right at the moment when mr. saxobeat was a top hit . . coincidence ? 
  silly noobs ... hecarim is an ap carry !, 
  probably no one will agree but i 'd add yi and twitch, 
  strange , my little brother is also a die-hard metal fan and he likes that track , 
  oh no , the drama is killing me ... 
  no just kidding . 
  gtfo attention whores . 
  please . 
  i meant the overlay . . how you arrange it , i tried different positions and sizes . . 
  i bet everyone likes it another place :d, 
  can not upvote you harder !, 
  thanks !, 
  ( it still goes on repeat lol ), 
  man it was a scarra reference, 
  general discussion is your place to ask things like this, 
  yes , its called dodge the fucking grenade, 
  knew it i would be the tactical computer :d, 
  my iq is 192 . . and no one believes that, 
  do nothing but farm or pick up free kills for 25 minutes . 
  then proceed to 4shot everyone . . 
  seriously after wriggles boots pd it 's gg for your team ... 
  oh , and mf, 
  they will probably poop their pants in shock and cry goodbye to their hudreds of millions of dollars that they already have in their pockets ... 
  edit : perfectly english-speaking russian reporter guy trolls league of legends pro by interwiewing him on faked accent and embarrasing questions . 
  however i didnt switch my computer off for like 3 months so i dont even know when i copied it , might be a good 1-2 weeks or so , lol, 
  * ahem *, 
  noob . 
  no , lichbane is superior , as akali doesnt need high burst damage , her spells are low cd spammable things . 
  plus , she needs gunblade , rylais , rabadons and ga , so dfg should replace void staff ? 
  no ... just no, 
  what a waste . . chicken brain is delicious !, 
  yeah in hungary we eat it too ... bear with it . . 
  man ... you really got ta go out and `` gank caitlyn '' if you know what i mean :d, 
  came here to say that trynd 's part was wayy above the others , at least for me :d, 
  taric stun guarantees a free boomerang and it is the highest damage skill on any ad carry, 
  or taric caitlyn , stun them the caitlyn lays a trap under them :d, 
  * khm *, 
  are you religious ? 
  / r/christianity ristianity can help i think, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrj_7yvihnm ), 
  [ this song about me in general :d ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prpeedmmmq0&amp;ob=av2e ), 
  eve on ap carry category ... no comment, 
  once i picked revive smite eve and someone decided to troll me by picking revive smite urgot and follow me everywhere . 
  i managed to outsmite him all the time and use him as a meatshield on ganks and we managed to win !, 
  ^ i 'm posting more along this chain because it seems like a shameless upvote train, 
  / r/leagueofmemes, 
  also , fuck you i play eve for win . 
  i can divide in my head so i dont :d, 
  crit dmg ? 
  hardest is definitely olaf, 
  1 hour , still no correction . . a massive storm ov downvotes i guess . . 
  it is :d, 
  oh well i suck at kennen so i wont buy runes for him :d, 
  maybe ... someday ... but i have to buy full crit dmg % runes first , then about 7 champs, 
  edit : happy cakeday, 
  yes !, 
  why did it not came to my mind :d,
