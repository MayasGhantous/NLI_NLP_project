  for me it 's [ ludovico einaudi - nuvole bianche ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-hsw142t5g&amp;ob=av3n ) . 
  epic, 
  you could have won probably with more optimal builds , such as not stacking 3 abyssals in team , or alistar going ad to make the opponent not only stack magic resist ... 
  you are a redditor for 1 year , 
  gz  ( ps : since when ryze is an ad carry ? 
  * hint hint *, 
  iswydt, 
  and rincent please, 
  i 'm sorry to be rude , but . . noob spotted, 
  i farm 6k ip in 2 days umad ? 
  i like how everyone is `` theorycrafting '' about how bad dyrus/darien/whatever was , or how they sucked ass/threw/won the game ... yet no one is even near to their level ... 
  guys . . get some skill then talk, 
  no , you just a slowpoke :d, 
  or hungarian . . we both write it with 2 `` f '', 
  what makes you think i dont ? 
  be you angels ? 
  yes , but even if i do , i look bad trying to do it ... 
  have children . . then you can criticize your parents . . if you know what i mean, 
  then you spill water into the laptop to make the ants go away ... 
  genius , isnt it ? 
  honestly , most of the name ideas here and in their site , are so childish, 
  can work if you start combo with ult . 
  but then , you arent worth shit if your ult in on cd ... 
  enemy has no jungler = not a quality game . . 
  sorry , no offense intended . 
  that 's some good sportsmanship right there . 
  9/10 , would read more, 
  you have to prevent it . 
  spam `` gj '' , compliment , dont say anything negative . 
  say things like `` i think you should try buying ie next , i saw dyrus doing it '' or `` man so unlucky '' ( after an 1v4 dive ), 
  after it , you are fucked . 
  report him and move on . 
  make him cd-based, 
  too bad it was kinda staged with singed going in 1v4 and things like that ... 
  well i write what i want , this is the internet . 
  i 'm 25 , got a wonderful university life , but i like to write things like this . 
  looks like you fell for the trolling , so . . * ahem *, 
  but no ... 
  now get over it, 
  that whole point of the match was about the lore man ... ionia vs noxus you know, 
  a link would be cool, 
  hm , i 'm level 14 after 30 games ... 
  ( on my smurf ), 
  not everyone a redditor , and not every redditor is n't a scumbag . 
  i knew redditors who fed my games because `` i didnt buy more than 1 ward so i threw the game at the 1st minute '', 
  if you deal damage ( which you need to do right ? ), 
  then spellvap or lifesteal might provide better life gain ... 
  hm , i guess it doesnt work in all cases  but sometimes i had success with this tactic, 
  would make vayne my main if this skin comes out, 
  i have a `` carry '' build on eve which has dp quints and reds ... and focuses on gunblade rageblade malady bc after triforce ... but i bet no one else play it lol, 
  look who is at the `` main place '' exactly at the middle of the top row, 
  it 's next to tab , i press it all time by mistake , as my left arm . . is not stronger than my right arm, 
  i think that was because his support dc 'd for a while and he needed proper items to hold an 1v2 lane ... 
  where is your nautilus flair then :d, 
  hm , seeing td makes me think of tower defense ... yeah seems legit clg beat a custom wc3 map, 
  lol fail , sorry , thought i was still browing / leagueoflegends . 
  the day i bookmarked the second stream in firefox ... ( scarra was first , sorry ), 
  blues should be mr and reds should be mpen all the time . 
  the only variation is yellows : armor for tanky champs ( like morde , galio or malph ) , manaregen for the mana hungry ( ziggs etc. ) . 
  quints : spellvamp for mord/kennen/vlad , movespeed for those who need it ( ryze , katarina for example ) and flat ap for anything else . 
  of course there are exceptions that work . 
  for example you can get a good game with full magic pen anivia rune page , but that requires you to outplay the opponent . 
  or , some specific champions may require specific pages . 
  for example on galio , or vs leblanc i run a 30 mres ( rest manaregen ) page . 
  you should consider getting a page with armor yellows though , depending on where you play , since nowadays many people like to counter ap mids with talon or other ad-based champs . . 
  ** this based on the fact that you run an ap at mid . 
  ** of course you can go mid with any champion . . some of the ad carries , for example caitlyn or mf , are very good at mid lane . 
  this requires some team comp swapping though ( for example an ap ( who can spam spells , like cassio , karthus ) goes bot with soraka , that is very viable too ), 
  i really like the idea of lore-related characters , because it causes `` interaction '' between champions and makes many easter eggs possible . 
  just look at the hilarious `` hidden '' lines between graves and nocturne - or zilean and volibear . 
  more , more , more of them needed !, 
  you playing tetris with champ portraits lol, 
  who is upvoting this circlejerk shit ? 
  5 shaco game , all wins . 
  36 cs/game o.o, 
  hmmm i thought it is the same that shows up when you press tab . 
  that one gives you a cs when you kill a ward lol, 
  so yeah you got the point, 
  hm , sometimes for me it is literally open for weeks 24/7 and i never got a problem like you ... and i have a 3-years-old computer ... 
  honestly , i may try it . 
  i know what you feel , i usually would play gangplank or soraka mid but ... yeah i have to play something like malzahar to calm my mates :(, 
  please , do not stop the `` rip scarra '' thing . 
  so i can identify who is retarded and who isnt . 
  on a second thought , it 's maybe uncomfortable for scarra , so for him please stop it . 
  or he has 1 game which he got stomped in, 
  sweet memories ... 
  i remember the time i picked clarity every time because i had mana issues . . then i learned how to spare my mana , only use spells when they are guaranteed to have effect ( for example dont use my mana to harass when a soraka/sona can heal it back ) . 
  it comes with time . 
  however i can recommend mana regen ( or per level ) blues , just in case, 
  wrong meme . 
  indeed , just do n't lose patience . 
  it took me a good 200 games to get used to not taking clarity ever . 
  ( then , after 4000 games i use it on ap kog ( only ) lol ), 
  it says friday 14th , and the calendar at the corner shows us that the 14th is monday !, 
  rant = downvote , that is how reddit works . 
  i like how i posted it before you . . and i got downvoted lol, 
  ^ ( probably haters ... ), 
  sane people of reddit : quick , downvote this shit please, 
  ** ahri ** ( looks like two recolors ), 
  ** ashe ** ( amethyst looks like a recolor too ),
