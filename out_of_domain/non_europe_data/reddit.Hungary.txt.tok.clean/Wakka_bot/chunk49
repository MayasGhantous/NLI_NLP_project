  ** cassiopeia ** ( bad colors ), 
  ** hecarim ** ( sorry , both skins are shit ), 
  ** leona ** ( somehow i find all three skins not harmonic . 
  for example iron solari leona has way small shield , not even covering anything , like its only an ornament lol ), 
  ** malphite ** ( obsidian seems incomplete and all the others are recolors ... ), 
  ** malzahar ** ( honestly , even overlord seems like a recolor ), 
  ** nautilus ** ( honestly , the new champion have awful skins in terms of harmony and completion . . they * look * badass but nothing else ), 
  ** sejuani ** ( i know its hard to do , but they should have been more creative with that , maybe another animal to mount at least ? ), 
  ** shaco ** ( that one is hard to do too , but every skin seems like a recolor ( maybe nutcracko is n't but i havent really seen it . . ever ) ), 
  ** shyvana ** ( mentioned somewhere else in this thread ), 
  ** sona ** ( even guqin has some bad proportions ), 
  ** soraka ** ( mentioned somewhere else in this thread ), 
  ** warwick ** ( honestly , i have 5 skins for warwick ( tundra , big bad , feral , hyena , firefang ) and no one of them are giving the `` badass '' feel like harbringer kassadin or warmonger sion . . or lord mordekaiser ), 
  i have a stong guess what is in the * last * place, 
  the problem is , he has not enough base amount on his skills to actually get high enough damage with levels , or rush abyssal like ahri/morde/galio can , and he doesnt has so good ap ratios to rush raba either . 
  in other words , you must build him for the utility only . 
  mabe rushing dfg and then rabadons or sheen to rabadons would help . . but then again , he has more use in bot lane or . . non-ap builds like triforce tank, 
  do n't click on the link if someone is pointing you to / r/spacedicks, 
  noxus poppy is cool too , in a creepy way . 
  like how edward scissorhands is cool . 
  i really fucking would buy the shit out of a jurassic anivia skin, 
  man , nothing beats the fucking statue of liberty, 
  gangsta rat . . best rat !, 
  medieval twitch not so good imo . 
  it 's like human ryze or pax tf , you use it because . . `` i have this skin and you dont ... trololo umad ? '', 
  except taken it to the next level :d, 
  hah i 'm a history nerd too so probably it wont bother everyone :d, 
  yes ... but what will you do when you have full build without any mana items . 
  dorans sold . . and blue ran out ? 
  eh , better make sure , i would go regen/level . 
  or buy a tear , hehe ^ ( ok you can start beating now ), 
  meh , i didnt include skins where the only decent skin was the legendary , or an event skin , it jsut doesnt fit the description ... 
  i like witch nid , toy soldier gp and both trundle skins lol, 
  and how dare you not call pink taric decent, 
  yes , that is why it 's cool !, 
  somehow i got both and i never play poppy , lol, 
  i dont understand why trynd 's ult is 5 seconds long while kayle 's ult is only 2 second ... 
  evelynn , no doubt ... 
  i challenge you to win a game ( above 2k elo ) with her, 
  saw op saying `` retard '' . . insta-downvote, 
  original :, 
  sorry , it 's not mattcom . . just very close to his style, 
  he used it on maokai in a game i spectated , it worked out well in terms of having enough damage and survivability . 
  he ourfarmed his opponent orianna 130 to 85 though . 
   only support that i can name off the top of my head that can nuke somone for 1.5 k. 
  nunu can do it with one click :d, 
  wow , thanks man . 
  ^ ( although what i downloaded , was 5 burial tracks , sorry . . 
  i respect that artist more ), 
  i scrolled down and i see a lot of hate-speech ... wtf / r/christianity, 
  i 'd vote for anivia . 
  just look at froggen ... 
  eyes cover the hair , classic . 
  yes ... i kinda feel guilty for having more karma for doing a google reverse image search that lasted 20 seconds . 
  than him making the art, 
  everywhere ... people arguing while not respecting the others opinion . . that 's not what i expected ... 
   many doctors at the time said a weekly leeching was part of a healthy life style . 
   a weekly bleeding is part of a balanced healthy life style . 
  fucking assassin 's creed pavlov reflexes, 
  i admit i do , 
  very good insight , worth reading every word . 
  makes me think about my jungle picks , although i had this thought process before , i never went that far . 
  someone more insightful player ( stonewall ) doing it , is a sign of improtancy . 
  do n't get me wrong - i do n't mean i take his words like ldses take the bible - my jungler pick is low cc , not really malleable , medium damage , medium survivabilty , zero sustain , very expensive build , needs heavy warding , not really fast , only self-streoid ... 
  i 'll still keep playing her < 3 , i just know now i 'm dragging my team down !, 
  i play everything with assassin mindset !, 
  hell yeah even soraka ... 
  ^ ( fuck , too much evelynn ), 
  strange , i have a radeon 4850 and it works perfectly ... winxp though, 
  nah , 4850 user here , everything is smooth on default settings . 
  higher setting make the game lag though, 
  rod of ages ? 
  really ? 
  i recognize my friends by name . . 
  is n't it better for * everyone * to live their days like this ? 
  when i was born the doctors said i wo n't live for more then 1 year . 
  well , i 'm 25 now ... and grateful . 
  that 's all what counts , is n't it ? 
  add hungarians too ... think of trianon 1920, 
  evelynn looking like sarah kerrigan , while her hate spikes are lurker spines . 
  marine graves . 
  mary poppins leona !, 
  more to it ... alien kog . 
  that would make a very nice legendary , too bad he has one . . kind of disappointing as its only worth 975 imo, 
  open your mouth ... 
  dude i was a newborn . . and i couldnt even move any body parts of mine , to add to that, 
  not to mention you outsustain karthus , and more tankier if it comes to gank, 
  you guys will laugh and call bs but . . 
  early levels evelynn   irelia top . 
  see , irelia goes in to harass , and after her q and e she relies on autoattacks to harass . 
  that moment irelia draws creep aggro . 
  9/21/0 eve , with tanky runes , takes 0 dmg from any minon so she can utilize creep damage to turn back fights like no other . 
  that said , i have no info about how hard irelia outscales evelynn after level 9 , probably very hard . 
  but if you are smart you can outcs irelia hard , with a few kills , you can start to roam etc etc. 
  pizza delivery sivir !!!!!!!, 
  ! 4444four, 
  anyone welcome to try this on euw against me  ( just pm me or something , as nowadays im leveling my smurf ), 
  i dont get it , twitch works fine for me o.o,
