  warning : incognito lesion detected, 
  initiating secondary distraction maneuvers, 
  better nerf irelia, 
  pulsefire ezreal , where ? 
  evelynn sucks, 
  or probably it will have low base damage and high ratios on passive so although he can use it , it wont be so impactful like garen 's ult would . 
  because they are n't anatomy professors !, 
  also , will it affect non-living champs like sion or blitz :d, 
  also no flash , ghost is superior for the exact smae reason as on vlad, 
  this was hilarious , please keep doing vids like this, 
  ca n't wait to level my smurf to 30 so people can see my 360 noscope dfg ravage lichbane combos !, 
  we all know mafia mf is the best skin ever , for obvious reasons . . if you know what i mean, 
  the clothing is really good , but i think you should rework the entire bow , looks awful in contrast to the beautiful clothes . 
  maybe another material will do ? 
  ( a stronger one ... it looks weak ), 
  look a little bit right, 
  erm , i was joking, 
   pick characters you play a lot and are personally op with . 
  * sigh *, 
  i know, 
  masturbation ... 
  singed . 
  eh , i use armor and high flat mana regen , and not starting at blue . 
  level 2 red ganks ... lee sin umad ? 
  gave me a good laugh :d, 
  the amount of ciclejerk here . . is too damn high, 
  true , but i like to surprise opponents . 
  a lot of people think cho is a blue reliant jungler and invade blue , and in solo q invades are many times successful , as not always the full team defends or they are not in the best spot . 
  so i just waltz away if they invade and start at red or something . 
  or against a slow jungler/vulnerable top i take red level 1 and go gank top . 
  you fucking obey the rules or you get reported , understood ? 
  just ask the guy to not use it and it 's okay . 
  if he does use it , it is reportable , as he clearly has a negative attitude . 
  tribunal will do its work . 
  that is ridiculous . 
  tribunal cant sort that out , as they have to rely on the reporter 's obviously biased explanation . 
  hm . . that is a problem . 
  but i guess , that if you get banned for that , you should just write a letter to the customer support . 
  no way you wont get unbanned . 
  i think in cases like that , qqing is never a proper method on dealing with something unpleasant . 
  i got banned once for 4 days . 
  never sumbitted a support ticket , although i could have got my case rewieved because looking back i wasnt that offensive . 
  instead , i learned the leasson , adjusted myself , and i never got reported since . 
  biggest lesson i learned from playing ranked , is that i have to search the fail in myself first , and only if i dont find anything , should i complain . 
  and i often do find . 
  what i want to point out , regarding this case , is that if you report someone for picking something while he definitely gained nothing illegal from it ( piking evelynn in ranked , teleport in aram and not using it , picking sivir for midlane and beating you etc ) , you do something illegitim , basically abusing the system of reporting , which is an assholish thing to do . 
  so you made yourself an asshole , meaning you negated all your rights to criticize anyone . 
  and report is one form of criticism , so you scored an owngoal , kinda . 
  tribunal is fine , but it should come with a tos/own summoners code , extended with the feature about having the right attitude/moral height to judge someone . 
  for example , 2 intentional feeders in game , should not report each other . 
  the case may be clear seeing the items and such , but it would give the sinners a false sense of judging rights ... 
  tl ; dr : what jesus said inthe bible : bla bla cast first stone bla bla . . old but true . 
  sorry for long post, 
  how much % of games were duo q ? 
  probably it 's not connected to any axe-bones, 
  10/10 would read again, 
  trundle !!!!!, 
  upvote for the amazing reference, 
  edit : [ if you wooshed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixgc_fgam3s ), 
  shaken, 
  not stirred, 
  one thing is sure : do not buy rylais . 
  you mean 1337, 
  or even , 31337, 
  `` this dude got a respawn in 3 days , it 's no fair i cant ... 
  please ? '', 
  smash it until it deforms into a ball shape , then roll it out, 
  my mom keeps telling me this :, 
  if you go outside without drying or toweling your hair after a wash , you * will * get brain cancer . 
  let 's just start with this : there is no such thing as a brain cancer ... 
  any deep purple/metallica/iron maiden/ac-dc/black sabbath/dio/dire straits/queen/kinks / sex pistols/uk subs song . 
  ^ ( or some drum and bass , now * that * would be a change :d ), 
  ** mundo ** . 
  q damage scales with levels , an insane poke and helps clear dragon/baron very fast . 
  in ganks he provides a decent aoe damage and even with one level in e he can outdamage ad carries in an 1v1 situation . 
  sustains the carry , can stop ganks with taunt , can tank poke with shield and has a global defensive ult and some great inbuild duel damage early . 
  the one and only support i got a triple kill on level 1 with . 
  poke , gank steroid and a bit of sustain . 
  free cv , `` free '' slow , a stun ulti . . and late game you get another carry . 
  ** volibear ** - works like leona . 
  if we dont strictly talk about supports , there can be a metashift where urgot/mf/vlad / mord/gp soloes bot and there is a roamer ( * you know what goes here * ), 
  send that to ironstylus for infinite love . 
  well , that 's what my father told me about brain cancer lol . 
  guess no one of us were right !, 
  thanks for the link , i learn something everday , 
  yea . . just like support akali . 
  [ ` nuff said ] ( http://lol.corgasm.org/assets/champions/evelynn_2.jpg ), 
  this might be the best answer, 
  wait , is that common ? 
  i mean , being insulted for being corrected, 
  stop arguing with bigots ... 
  i played about 2500 ranked games and i think i ~ ~ had ~ ~ remember about 4-5 decent games so ... 
  what i realized , that this guy 's name should be spread amongst newcomers , as the info he provides is insightful , proper and reliable . 
  something that you can always count on . 
  thanks stonewall for the effort you put in the community . 
  edited , i was sleepy and derped a word, 
  spectate 10 games in a row . 
  every single game there will be a guy who is underfarmed , low on kills , raging , cant even play his champion or any combination of the above . 
  that is just how this elo range works . 
  by 2500 i mean ranked games , i count the ~ 750 from season1 .
