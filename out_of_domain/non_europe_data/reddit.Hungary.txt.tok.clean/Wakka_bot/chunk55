  while he can buy qss . 
  nah i got my passive to cover that, 
  truly unique in a way that ad build is very good endgame , and shitty early . 
  ap is almost exactly the opposite  but since how the meta is going nowadays , with all this early game advantage abusing and snowballing and shit , i would do ap too . 
  ( in fact i never played ad sion in rankeds ), 
  but ad sion . . is just too fuking funny ... just like a trynd with full crit dmg % runes ... or critplank parrleys oneshotting the enemy carry lol, 
  fuck , where is my time machine, 
  remake incoming , umad ? 
  probably more then 30 % of that 70 are on lost matches , just saying, 
  win nhao *, 
  ftfy, 
  or gragas-fat !, 
  how does it feel to play like the guys you met who are sometimes 5-10 years older than you ? 
  do they feel superior even though they play worse ? 
  they nerfed ap kog , not ad . .

  the skill level you have involves a ton of real-time field practice . 
  so , no please . 
  i do n't want to see perfect cassio ults/wallflash to 420 noscope baron steals every game . 
  would kill the human aspect of the game , the room for error is the thing that makes the other team able to make plays . 
  it would make all the games fucking boring . 
  for example since clg knows that dignitas knows how to perfectly steal baron ( etc. 
  ) , they would have to prepare for that , and only attempt it if it 's 100 % secure . 
  it 's like painting `` there is the exit -----  '' signs all over the labyrinth . 
  nope . 
  carmac himself describes it on [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnpj3r0ghfi ) at about 4:13 . 
  he straight up says hiev and have . 
  besides , here 've is not even a grammatically correct thing , it doesnt makes sense , even to pronounce . 
  give me one reason why i should n't . . 
  i handled over all the proofs and you still think you know the fact better ... you , sir , are a moron, 
  wait . . 
  i insulted you ? 
  never thought that way ... 
  sorry for that . 
  i just want to help people to know better , if i can . . honestly , i know that it may sound all high.and mighty sometimes , but i just ca n't express myself any other way . 
  it 's me . 
  feel free to downvote me , for i could n't care less about karma , plus , honestly , i dont think i `` added to the discussion '' by simply insulting you ... 
  damn . 
  true . 
  probably you were after a soloq game loss , like me ? 
  props to you for admitting mistake instead of holding to something which makes no sense . 
  now that deserves an up vote :d, 
  erm . . 
  excuse me , but you are a redditor for 0 days ... can you post actual proof that you are reginald ? 
  coz it looks fake, 
  q is for proccing sheen , not to get damage . 
  if you want q to deal damage , go ap . 
  but even if you do so , you should not even put any points into q before you get sheen . 
  i f you want damage , go ad/hybrid . 
  any build , e  w  q is the way to go . 
  ad ( triforce ) build gets sheen earlier ( ap build needs kages first ) . 
  i usually go 9/21/0 or 9/12/9 and level weewer . 
  same with evelynn lol . 
  everyne says she deals 0 dmg . . they just cant fucking build her properly, 
  cutom game testing i guess, 
  you have -150 comment karma for a reason ... lol, 
  might worth to rethink your attitude . 
  0 downvotes . . wtf, 
  `` in the beginning , there was no light ... '', 
  try as vayne from jungle . 
  get madreds , then wits end , malady , sorc boots , abyssal maybe . 
  ( max magic pen obiously , maybe even with runes . . along with magic-dmg-on-hit items ) does sick damage with w procs . 
  doesnt snowball hard though , has a shit midgame but the late game is nice, 
  actually double ie can make sense if you only need ad and crit . 
  but that trynda didnt max out attack speed though , he would have done better damage with zekes and last whisper though . 
  usual trynd build maxes crit with only pd+ie , last whisper + boots are essential , that leaves 2 items to customize : bt , ga are good candidates , maybe maw to abuse ulti . 
  but certainly not two ies lol . 
  i remember once running a caitlyn with nunu support ( with zekes ) and as runes . 
  since i didnt need any as ( my as was capped with runes and green pot ) my late game build was on phantom dancer , lw , bt , and 3 infinity edges . 
  with so high ad i basically 3shotted everyone . 
  we got good team comp to defend me so i didnt need ga or basnshee . . so what else to buy ? 
  nothing . 
  3 ie and watch yourself on headshot crits . 
  redditor since 5 days ... username really relevant . . 
  [ suuuure ] ( http://gifsforum.com/images/image/bullshyt/grand/i_call_bullsht.jpg ), 
  try it with nicki minaj lyrics . . 
  though he has a point , you can not pick eve, 
  . . cuz your team will rage you to hell, 
  and warwick , that silly wolf heals for 1k if he bites you, 
  [ it reminds me about when my main was viable in ranked . 
  top comment brought a tear to my eye :d, 
  yeah . . only bundle i regret to have, 
  do you know what to do ? 
  i mean do you have full knowledge of your situation , what is necessary , what you should not do etc. 
  look who i found there, 
  care to eloaborate on how exactly 3 ie does less damage than an ie +2 bt ? 
  same thing with morde would sound sick . . or mundo, 
  something similar was brought up by guinsoo i think , dunno what happened with it . 
  butbutbut . . morde shield !, 
  lol, 
  more like roamer !, 
  she can jungle , yes , and i do it occasionally , but it 's jsut as good as jungle mf or ashe ... 
  better to get advantage on lanes by roaming, 
  we currently have 3 , and only one of them are close to viable . . yay, 
  [ sure ] ( http://gifsforum.com/images/image/bullshyt/grand/i_call_bullsht.jpg ), 
  or , to remove some suspicion that it 's fake, 
  teemo os nowhere close of being called as an assassin , lol, 
  for clarification i meant katarina , akali , and eve,
