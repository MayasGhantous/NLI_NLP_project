  surprisingly effective . 
  a lot of lol players know spunkify for his rewiews , his content was always good , it 's bad news to us . 
  i played from 800 to 1300 and yeah 1100-1200 is the worst . 
  player intelligence and game knowledge both hits low here, 
  highly depends where you play it . 
  in soloq , you dont really want to `` help your ad carry '' by buying bc . 
  except if hes ridiculously fed and the rest of the team is feeding so you need him to win . 
  otherwise you must build one man army i think . 
  of course in ranked5s its another story . 
  one more tip ; i think caitlyn is the best champion to learn orbwalking , because she is an ad carry and mainly the ad carries use orbalking the most ; and caitlyn has a higher range and short wind down animation , basically you have to cancel the wind down right away to be effective . 
  not easy but if you can do it , it 's possible that it will be easier with most champs . 
  for easiest champion to orbwalk , i think it 's nautilus . 
  the wind down animation is very long and very visible where you cancel it . 
  more like toxic mundo , but yea, 
  not for / r/rule34lol, 
  we already have muay thai lee ... 
  okay but it is the 2342469000th repost . 
  best, 
  idea, 
  ever, 
  i main critplank ( now that eve is shit ) , you dont have to tell ... 
  how is this made it through moderation ?? 
  how ?? 
  the kicker would have been rylais on him :d epic slow screeeeeeen, 
  ask vman7 . 
  for myself , i think it sucks . 
  that guy is `` only '' 1900 elo ( on his main dye44 ) . 
  vman is 2100 atm with 2324 top , and he is around for a much longer time ... 
  one more reason not to be famous ... sadly, 
  eh you could snowball jsut as hard with ad build as well . 
  triforce yoyos and no one could ever run from you or outsustain you ( wriggles ), 
  both could instagib them under the duration of the stun . . no difference, 
  what is the moment in your carreer you wish you could revert ? 
  just w out from stuncards , q him all day , he has no armor and buying early armor sets him back from his build , and you have the similar map presence with instant global slow . 
  i think this is actually a very good idea and i would like it to be implemented too . 
  i cant comment on it though , i dont have any further suggestions . 
  challenge accepted bro , challenge accepted . 
  and if i 'm not mistaken his passive can block stun cards ? 
  i used to counter tf mid with panth , but dont remember since nowadays i spam gp whenever i can . 
  she is all about burst since he has 2 nukes 1 shield and 1 heal ( the ult ) . 
  so , basically build her as a burst mage : dfg+r aba + void is core , rest is obviously situational ( possible items are zhonyas , lichbane , abyssal ) but no rylais or rod because dfg has all the mana you need and you have shield which is better with resists than hp . 
  ( and both nukes are cc so rylais have no point . . ( just like on lux lol ), 
  ensure *, 
  ^ ( grammarpolice at your service ! ), 
  of course . 
  that has nothing to do with the grammar error though . 
  if you think so , you might need to refine your english knowledge , as there was definitely a grammar error . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  because you seem like you just trying to defend a pointless argument . 
  exactly . 
  you can play kennen rumble or vlad top ... 
  or heimer , or ziggs ... 
  what the fuck . 
  i 'm 182 . 
  yep , there is a separate test , you have to take both . 
  ( i remember taking an `` official '' test twice , scoring 182 both times with different test , its pretty accurate ), 
  some big news about a pro player ? 
  lets ask him for an ama to reap a few hundreds of free karma !, 
  fuck this circlejerk . 
  yes i took a real one . 
  this was a real weird issue . 
  some guy in my high school spread the false info i 'm retarded ( i was a bit weird at that time ) and the teachers made me so i must bring an official paper that im not retarded . 
  i went to my psychologist and we both knew its bullshit so he made that paper and on top or that , we decided to say fuck you '' with attaching an official iq test , honestly dont remember `` more that he said it was official ( and it looked like that , it was fucking difficult ) . 
  i got 182 on that test . 
  came back 2 months later to make that test again because i was curious if this is true . . i got 182 again, 
  at a psychologist working for a state institute ( not a hospital , more like a mental/social institute ( dont know the exact word ), 
  im surprised no one mentioned [ indivision - secret vision ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvzij9yjwc ), 
  i bet my liver it 's a new support, 
  like she isnt dead already . . 
  / r/rule34lol, 
  nope . 
  joj issue 10 contains an interwiew with eve ( and tf too , iirc ) stating that eve dumped tf . 
  edit : http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/evelynn_the_widowmaker/skinstrivia, 
  edit2 : http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/the_journal_of_justice:_volume_1,_issue_10, 
   nearby sources claim that evelynn simply dropped the bomb in the middle of a conversation , leaving twisted fate shocked and dismayed . 
   the champion [ twisted fate ] was unable to form coherent sentences . 
  it seems that this reporter caught him long after many drinks had been downed . 
  after what sounded like a heartfelt expression of loss ( although he could have just as easily been asking for help to the bathroom ) , he passed out , fell off his stool , and flatulated loudly . 
  it 's this reporter 's opinion that he is not taking the break-up well . 
  so definitely not tf ended it , 
  ** what **, 
  ** the **, 
  it was his name , i didnt want to offend him , its a tradition where i live, 
  or vlad , cho, 
  but why hybrid ? 
  well technically it wasnt 2 minutes ( 2:07 between the to `` quadrakill '' shouts ) but almost . 
  still , nice job and have fun in elo hell :d, 
  well i dont live here ... 
  well , not against soraka ... yea . 
  but against , say , a nunu vayne , its fine i suppose, 
  god damn it . 
  so apparently celebrities are an exception from the `` dont post endgame screens '' rule . 
  i hereby state that i will fucking screenshot the first pro i run into . 
  and post it to / new . 
  if you moderate that . . you are fucking children . . 
  ^ ( not like you arent already are with this teemo picture bullshit lol ), 
  well it was people and not riot , apparently, 
  morg autoattacks are green , arent they ? 
  y u no have still hope, 
  and lullabygaming,
