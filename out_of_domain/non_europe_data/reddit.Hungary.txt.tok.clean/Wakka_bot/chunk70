  it made the whole thing a lot creepier, 
   uses her w, 
   her, 
  might be the adblockers i 'm using , but doesnt work for me, 
  i always open these videos preparing to get disappointed but not in this case  also nice that you didnt put a 1 min intro for the 7 second actual thing happening , like some others . 
  are you over 12 ? 
  i like how everyone here completely forgetting the asian players ... china , korea ... there are some really good players live there, 
  then i said nothing . . nvm, 
  its not eve anymore . 
  its a new champion therefore i 'm not interested . 
  honestly i would not build it on mordekaiser either . 
  dfgis just much , much better item on him ( it has a range and synergizes better with the ult ), 
  not really true in one specific case , if you happen to have both sheen and tiamat , the sheen proc damage applies to the targets around him . 
  ( tested with twitch + triforce , without ulti ), 
  no , no no . 
  ap yi dives into the heart of enemy team so he needs some tankiness to survive , in case w gets cc 'd . 
  zhonyas is core on him . 
  as does rabadons , voidstaff , dfg and boots . 
  that leaves one item , and honestly he spams mana and needs some mr so athenes is much better choice . 
  if you swap any of these items for lichbane you will have either less dmg , way more mana dependancy , or you blow up in half a second . 
  proc does physical damage and ap yi doesnt have armor pen . 
  idk man , one game we had a troll just like this , and my team actually convinced him to play , he went roaming tf , we had no jungler . . and we won . 
  oh yeah i worded my comment poorly , my bad ( apologies , im not a native english speaker . ), 
  you are right . 
  what i wanted to express is that , if you have a tiamat and buy a sheen , your overall damage will not only be better for just only 1 target . 
  because , with this skin he looks like dravens ulti when he spins !, 
  imagine the terror ... 
  where can i buy this game, 
  against a decent team i mean , they know if you are capable of pentakilling them they probably save the cc for you . . duh, 
  good luck playing glass cannon yi . 
  just watch any good player playing ap yi man , there are couple of ap yi players , for example scarra , just look what are they buying , hear them explain . . etc. 
  you will become a better player by learning from them , 
  ** talking ** to ** numerous ** crushes . 
  at least , for me :(, 
  how lol changed your life ? 
  in general , in terms of everyday behaviour , or in terms of people ( both lol and non-lol people ) 's interaction with you ? 
  i learned about it when i was 8 years old , am i cool ? 
  probably both ults will be interupted by the other . 
  i saw a poster a while ago that was somehow sarcastic the same way :, 
  `` join the army !, 
  it 's like cod but without respawns ! '', 
  or , as we call it here , `` shoot the gay '' . 
  ( police ref . 
  during protest/gaypride ), 
  xin ( commando ), 
  copied dancing_bagel 's layout because it 's the best and i dont want to improve , plus the thread remains consistent . 
  ** about me **, 
  i 'm 25 , redditing and loling all day every day for enjoyment . 
  i used to study architecture * engineering * but felt like it 's not for me . 
  i learned computer engineering and architecture * techician * stuff and basically play lol for fun . 
  if i would describe myself in 3 words , i would say : inteligent , outspoken , melancholic . 
  ** time on lol **, 
  12 + games a day , plus hours of redditing . 
  sometimes more . 
  ** how long have you been lol ` ing ? 
  when i joined the newest champion was irelia . 
  so , more than 18 months i believe . 
  ** availability **, 
  weekdays all day ( usually 10 am - 12 pm cest ) , weekends depend on how many housework i have ( we are renoveting the house and sometimes i have to work on it for hours straight , otherwise i check reddit evey 10 min or less ), 
  ** feelings **, 
  i understand how `` hard work '' moderating is , and even if it looks like the moderators doesnt do their job ( i remember my own posts qqing about how shitty the moderation is . . ) they might be working on things we wouldnt even think about , so my most motivation is , to just have a * proper * subreddit fitting most ppl 's needs . 
  ** changes ? 
  i think we dont have a consensus about what to moderate or not ( some people actually like celeb posts ) so what i want to do is make this whole community ( or at least the widest mass possible ) involved in a survey about what they want to see in * this * subreddit and what they want to see elsewhere ( for example regarding / r/lolfanart and the scarcity of ppl there , yet fanart posts here are popular ... ), 
  ** cool events **, 
  in addition to the events already held , we could make daily , or even constantly flowing events here or on the reddit chat room , for example aram games for redditors , maybe even with tourney , , or a subreddit to organize games , with extra features reddit can provide ( blacklist of people who leave at champselect for example ) . 
  organizing some services provided by redditors would be awesome too , for example helping new players , helping people on a ceartain champ ( of course beyond / r/summonerschool i mean ), 
  ** why me ? 
  i want to give to the community , and right now it would mean me a lot to provide me with some work which i can be proud of , as staying at home all day without any work/school is pretty . . depressing . 
  plus , i mained eve when it was * not * cool , for a very long while , defended her in arguments like no other , against more thatn a year of `` why are you maining a shitty champ u retard '' etc , so my enthusiasm got trained to be veeeery high . 
  ( recently i picked up eve again after a short gp-maining hiatus ), 
  ** what changes ( again ? 
  nothing really , the foundations ( ban spammers/scammers/bmers etc. . ) are set , the thing is working , its simply perfecting/polishing should be done . 
  honestly , even though i want to work as a mod here , i think new mods arent needed * that * much . 
  maybe the existing mods know something . 
  ** any skills ? 
  i have res ( firefox ) and a fast conection . 
  i can say i 'm experienced in redditing , if that counts . 
  regarding the work to be done , i wasnt a moderator ever . 
  i was an admin for a diablo2 private server for about 6 months , plus i have a general good understanding of people thanks to irl stuff and years spent on the internet . 
  ** what if they break the rules ? 
  ~ ~ ban the motherfuckers to oblivion ~ ~ we should have some laws set against differend types of law breaking ( killing people is bad , mmmkay ? ), 
  ** massive attack **, 
  i 'm not that trained in tecnology stuff , but in great danger i have my people to help , and as long as i have any tools to defend any work i 've done , i would do it . 
  i usually see project i participate in as my child anyway . 
  and i 'm a good parent ... 
  ** how much time ? 
  i enjoy doing work , and i 'm motivated , so i can do this in all my free time stated above . 
  so , about 10-14 hours a day . 
  ranked solo queue is demotivating anyway , so i could use something to do instead of being a scapegoat . . , 
  i can say you have an affinity for scales , am i right ? 
  didnt start with ulti , you dont need resist vs baron if you have consume . 
  for a while , yes . 
  now im back . 
  ... now , to my question . . 
  flairs purpose is to reflect us somehow and having his flair switched many times is not bad in itself ; maybe shows he was interested in many champs . 
  i 'm interested too , i just dont think i am `` allowed '' to change flair without knowing that champ inside out lol . 
  that said , i dont think i shouls set my flair to more than a handful of champs : eve , gp , yi , morde , ww , malz , maybe mundo and galio , but nothing else i 'm confident when playing with . 
  perhaps he has more knowledge ? 
  or just more confidence , who knows . 
  fuck yes eve buffs,
