  hell fucking no i dont want to go back to the days of `` omg eve trollpick , report '', 
  so you didnt met release xin zhao huh ? 
  another nerf , i 'm staing to get pissed off on riot with this `` remake this to something useful then nerf it to oblivion again '', 
  no really . 
  this doesnt make me play another champion ... 
  cool design does . 
  they need to make a more complex survey imo , about champion preference regarding to nerfs/changes . 
  how many people turned to a more op champion after the diana nerfs ?

  i see what you did there , huehue, 
  oh yeah lol , remember when they adjusted numbers on eve base stats ? 
  just to fuck over anyone who tried to fit her in the jungle after being nerfed so hard she cant roam anymore . 
  wayyyyyyy to force the meta . 
  oh heys she got lategame still !, 
  * cd nerf , ap ratio nerf *, 
  nevermind . . 
  lol fuck you , a jax with a triforce poops on eve , even with a 4k gold disadvantage ... 
  she could , but fucking morello man . . 
  cant wait until she becomes viable again . 
  possible with a global stun i guess , to keep up with the increasing scale with each nerf cycle, 
  that would mean too much skin disadvantage i guess , as mf has blonde skin, 
  oh hillbilly gragas , how could i forgot !, 
  astrology would make more sense for soraka ? 
  he gets a lot of attention because of his behavior which is kinda questionable , but he uses that attention in a good was ( charities/thoughtful videos etc. ), 
  i think the problem with him , that causes many people to hate him , is that he seem to get this fame from being a good player , but actually he is famous because he is a professinal troll . 
  and everybody with half a brain knows that . 
  he is a mediocre player at best ... no one believes he beat alex ich , we all know it was a guy who stole his name after the real one changed his name . . 
  then , he makes a good , serious video [ \\ ( like this \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srnsw38cwo ) and people start to think . . hey !, 
  its like an olympics winning athlete releases a football teaching video . 
  it 's like athene really thinks he is a pro lol player/has the renown to do that . 
  the reality is , athene is passively makes us to realize that, 
  1 . people are too serious about everything , from fame to gaming, 
  2 . not just the best player can have a good opinion voiced . 
  i think he makes good points and i respect him for that . 
  but i really wan na know what is on his mind . . does he really believe he is a pro player . . because if yes . . that would be weird . 
  people need to start looking at him with a different mindset . 
  not everyone is black and white , lol, 
  wasnt so hard with eve , honestly . . 
  i mean , if you are at low levels of play , playing an easier/stronger champ might be the difference to win or lose a game . 
  basically your picks affect your elo . 
  i learned it by maining eve since season 1 . 
  she was considered a troll pick , then an op pick , then a trollpick again , then a decent pick , then an op pick again , and now she is back to almost decent/up . 
  sad thing is , the team acts accordingly and my elo was rollercoasting along this . 
  if you can have 50 % winratio with champs that have 50 % winratio overall . . that means your real wins . 
  i mean , remember preseason3 patch ? 
  the team that can have panth/talon won . 
  if there was one on each team then it was a race of `` who can get 4 cleavers first '' . 
  like everyone , i tried to pick panth every game , and stack 4 cleavers to get free elo . 
  i felt bad . 
  it 's not my elo . . 
  i realized i play to get better . 
  if you are so proud of having an 50 % winratio it might show you play to get better too . 
  so go and try it with a champ that has weaknesses . 
  that said that doesnt mean you should stop playing eve , she will be nerfed to oblivion very soon anyway , if you can manage an 50 % winratio after that , you can be proud !, 
  sorry if i hurt you . 
  i 'm kinda tired to rephrase my thoughts to express myself better . 
  hope you undertand .

  it was the person who got awarded , not the action so it was 100 % legit they took away his prize ? 
  but yeah you dont have to tell me about how someone feels other champs inferior because he plays them worse lol . 
  i got 700-1k eve games , and always feel worse when playing other champ because i didnt play them that much . 
  aww shit the bane of mobas . 
  champion looks/preference  all . 
  how do you know its real ? 
  really ? 
  now i 'm fucking pissed . 
  i 'm completely convinced now that riot champion designers/ppl in charge arent even playing the game even near top level . 
  ever played early game eve ? 
  she ran out of mana quickly anyway . 
  jesus . . what the fuck riot you cant even nerf ? 
  even i , an 1300 elo player , can mention at least 5 different ways to nerf eve while still maintanining her viability . 
  now she is useless again . 
  thanks . 
  i 'll be back when you buff her again ... 
  exactly . 
  nowadays my ip output is so high i can immediately buy every champ on release , plus when i didnt have all the old champs i could buy about 1-2 a week .
