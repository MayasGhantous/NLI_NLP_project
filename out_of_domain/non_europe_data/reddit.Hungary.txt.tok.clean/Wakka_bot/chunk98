  i bet they have it somewhere anyway . . 
  da fuck is cod ? 
  you might wan na check out xj9 stream for some vi action, 
  what the fuck ? 
  you got a present from your mother and you feel terrible ? 
  ungrateful shit . . 
  a hard one, 
  i just mean , if you get a present it is something which you should never , in any circumstances , should feel terrible about . 
  the revolver idea seems nice . 
  also the ultimate could be some kind of upgrade to weapon like pfe but with jayce/elise ult, 
  aaaaand fuck me its not available in my country, 
  hungary actually . 
  yes , leve 2 is easily reached with the help of teammates dmg on wolves and blue so i think it spares a pot as well, 
  it has a client ? 
  lol no , never even know about anything similar, 
  wow how comes that this karmacow still has milk ? 
  how about no, 
  i think i as dgnjsgjaerbn g\u00e9kjbnd \u00e9fgkd\u00e9 for a second, 
  i synched it with facebook if that matters ... 
  or ... just learn to read, 
  this , with the idea of having more xp gain if you win , would promote `` mastering '' champs in normal before playing it in ranked . . 
  i have to wholeheartedly agree . 
  great idea . 
  meh , i got 8k + games , by now i would have like 30 champ badges at least . 
  maybe some bronze -  plat outlines depending on how much games you played / how much your winrate is ? 
  ( `` i 'm in silver league but i 'm plat with karma , noob team gg '' ), 
  as/tank ww ( wits , malled , frozen heart , visage ) is just way uperior to ap ( in any form ) lategame . 
  i dont know , i feel like i 'm in / r/circloljerk, 
  wasnt disappointed, 
  silver ad to the rest of the team :, 
  fucking initiate then , goddamned piece of shits !, 
  maybe switch servers at the top of the page . 
  yes , me too, 
  i 'm fast and delicate, 
  s3 items are good on her . 
  way better than s2 items were . 
  liandrys , new nashors , new malady , etc. . . 
  . . now you see . 
  someone to hear your prayers . . 
  lee sin ult doesnt work though :(, 
  nope, 
  no , i cant count how many times i used teleport without getting interrupted by lee . 
  same with shen ult . 
  cait coming to lane level 2 is an even bigger problem :(, 
  meh , i got to ranked after 800 + games and still got raped . 
  might be just me though, 
  ( and it was mid season 1 ), 
  tank harder , or sustain harder . 
  i won three fucking hundred games with revive smite eve . . 
  i blame him for the eve nerf . 
  rip eve , may you rest with the yorick patch . . 
  model : caitlyn, 
  passive : skarner, 
  e : sivir, 
  r : karthus, 
  q : eve, 
  ** iii . 
  this one would be funny to watch, 
  ** summoner id : ** wakkawakkawakka ( euw ) do n't have a level 30 acc on the na server , can get one to 30 in a week or so . 
  ** bracket : ** silver 3, 
  ** favorite role : ** top or mid, 
  ** top 3 favorite champions ** : gangplank , evelynn , malzahar ( i very much enjoy master yi and twitch too ), 
  ** time zone/availability : ** gmt +1 ( aka cet ) , mostly from 10 am to 12 pm . 
  can be more, 
  ** do you think you 're a good player for the amount of time you 've played the game ? 
  ** no , others learn faster , but thats fine if we look at my irl situation . 
  i just recently became a person who is eager to learn . 
  ** when you lose in solo queue what is the main reason ? 
  ** i risk too much when overextending , mostly because i try to push my limits . 
  or , i 'm not able to stop the flame war ( i never start it tho ), 
  ** what is your biggest game-play flaw ? 
  ** probably knowing what to do in midgame teamfight situations . 
  like in a baronfight , do i finish baron or turn back on enemy ? 
  ** why are you interested in this ? 
  ** i want to be a better player and play with good people who dont flame . 
  these two usually dont go together . . 
  ap nasus flash ults anyone ? 
  you create 1 prison server per world ( like pbe ) and then everyone else outside na will have 200 ping . 
  how am i supposed to outplay my laning opponent with that ping lol . 
  also if he has like 20 ping then im gon na lose lane --  flame war started ( at least in low elo ), 
  for the last fucking time . 
  it 's called f-o-o-t-b-a-l-l in the civilized world !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ its ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ joke ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ fucks ^ ^ ^ ^ sake, 
  you americans . . 
  i can trace back my family longer than you can trace back your nation :d, 
  you mean ... 1100 years ? 
  you are welcome to try ... 
  dude . 
  you might not realized , but we didnt really took it seriously , it was just friendly bashing . 
  woooosh . 
  you mad ? 
  just dodge, 
  roam mid , kill the jungler or steal buffs . 
  also oyu can take tp and gank bot with it, 
  ... woosh, 
  disagree , more kids in my game , harder i snowball . 
  although i need a duo partner in those games . 
  soloq i recommend schooltime too .
