  i did actually read every post but my memory is terrible . 
  moving on now :, 
  ** elizabeth 's rapture id ** - correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't remember any kind of id for rapture citizens mentioned anywhere . 
  every resident in the city was merely trusted to have connections to core residents and higher ups either through invitation or contract ( like the dockworkers and such ) . 
  johnny topside was widely known to be an outsider , he did n't exactly make a secret out of it . 
  it only came to ryan 's attention when it already made the headlines . 
  there was nothing special about the guy aside from the fact that he happened to stumble on the city , which ryan thought to be suspicious and therefore did n't deem it worthy of the risk . 
  on the other hand , elizabeth was secretive about her identity ( no one other than suchong actually saw her enter the city , she never told anyone of her origins , she did n't stick out from the rest in anything ) , she had special powers that suchong , and therefore ryan knew about . 
  ryan very much knew about her presence in the city , and also knew she had n't been invited . 
  he even calls her out for being a `` thief '' that broke into his city , then manages to throw a dozen of his men on her . 
  it 's not far-fetched to think that it took 2 months for suchong to relent and forward the info to ryan instead of fulfilling his scientific curiosity any further ( plus he recently lost access to his lab anyway ) . 
  ** elizabeth struggling to summon old man winter ** - that 's where development info becomes relevant . 
  ep2 's rewrite happened after ep 1 was already released . 
  i find it likely that liz was supposed to have a power drop ( that way a tear mechanic in ep2 could have been more manageable ) , but after the rewrite this particular scene remained a leftover of an obsolete concept . 
  furthermore , why is it a problem that drinkable plasmids required 10x adam in rapture ? 
  fontaine even acknowledges it , that 's the reason he ordered suchong to cancel its production in the first place . 
  it might be one of those hamfisted retcons , but its not inconsistent with itself . 
  ** columbia existing ** - what i agree with is this part is very poorly explained in bas , as in not at all , that does n't mean it 's not possible , in fact it makes a lot more sense than the columbia worlds all `` ceasing to exist '' altogether . 
  columbia is part of the time paradox , same as the luteces and elizabeth themselves . 
  since time is an ocean , there 's actually no way to `` erase '' anything that existed at any point in time , this was never mentioned like that anywhere . 
  this is the exact same paradox as elizabeth 's existence , and therefore has a similar result . 
  it 's unclear if columbias `` fused '' together like liz did or if they remained separate but unhinged from the universe as they were , but they were definitely not deleted . 
  as a result of the paradox , they continue to exist in a bubble universe of their own that does n't originate nor conclude anywhere , it is just cut off , chained to other timelines like rapture and other timelines they shared technology with it forever . 
  bas elizabeth simply returns to that bubble universe , she was always there in fact . 
  we just did n't see her when we first went to finkton with booker . 
  chicken and egg situation , no one was there `` first '' . 
  sure , retcon , but it 's a plausible and imo quite clever one . 
  the rest of your list i completely agree with , as in the bouncer attack , the empathy bond , the 3 stores creating branches , the plane crash , liz losing her powers etc. 
  ( i split this into two because i apparently went beyond the character limit , sorry in advance , reddit is poopy ) . 
  * but i never connect a final product to circumstances that occured during its creation , because in this case , it 's kinda like `` oh , he 's been in a car accident , but it 's not really his fault - he was rushing '' . 
  * - i suppose that 's one way to look at it , i rather would n't have you as my boss though :d i personally take these things into account and i 'd certainly would n't judge a person 's `` rushed job '' that harshly if his house just burned down that week . 
  * elizabeths problem - i remember her saying she 's felt what every version of her felt , but still , i do n't take anything from burial at sea as a solid fact ( because there 's already so many nonsense in its story , so it 'd be hypocritic to pick one and reject another ) . 
  * - hypocritical ? 
  it sounds a bit absolutist to me instead . 
  criticising its faults is one thing , disregarding all of its content because it has a lot of faults to begin with is frankly unfair and sounds more like a grudge against the game . 
  which is fine to have , but that 's not objective criticism , more like a low-key rant , no offense . 
  at the same time you cite the rapture novel as a source , with its own fair share of questionable additions and contradicting chronology . 
  just seems a bit arbitrary to me . 
  * anyways , when elizabeth was resurrected as a normal girl , she would n't be a singularity anymore - she 's a completely normal person now . 
  the only clue for her existence can be found in burial at sea , but since it 's not a trustworthy source of information , i can not agree that during the infinite 's ending , all the elizabeths must have been merged together . 
  aside from logic and theories - this completely ruins the infinite 's mood during the end . 
  * - and that 's your real problem with this , i presume . 
  it overwrites the ending you preferred , therefore meddles with your attachment ( for a lack of a better word ) for infinite 's original conclusion . 
  which is again fine , i felt the same way for some time , but at this point you 're looking to justify your dislike of change with a kind of nitpicking you presumably have n't done with the original game ( and let 's face it , there 's plenty of opportunities for that with infinite as well ) . 
  i agree that levine and co reopened that specific can of worms that they once closed more or less efficiently in infinite 's ending , but from a storytelling standpoint there really was no way of completely shutting it again once they settled with the story and the location . 
  using both infinite 's protagonists and rapture for the dlc may not have been the most plot-hole-proof idea , it was really the best option from a marketing standpoint . 
  i do n't personally hold this against them ( this branching issue alone would n't really shake my suspension of disbelief in itself ) , in fact i appreciate that they really wanted to please everyone as much as they could : bringing back rapture for those who did n't like the new setting that much while also keeping the link with columbia , bringing back the characters that were arguably the best of both worlds ( liz , cohen , ryan , luteces etc. ), 
  while at the same time presenting a story that * can * be ignored if one happens to think it ended with the main game , but continuing it in a meaningful way nevertheless . 
  the idea itself was n't bad imo . 
  couple it with the fact that they did n't start this with the final ending in mind . 
  i would n't have given a rat 's ass about a minerva 's den sort of dlc where the content is basically separated from the main storyline in every way , starring exclusively new characters i personally do n't care about . 
  there certainly could have been other ways to use the two protagonists while not fiddling with the original game 's timeline and conclusion at the same time ( like martyr booker 's timeline for example ) , but i doubt it could have been done with rapture involved . 
  so adding to the original point , the branching issue is indeed a plot hole , but it 's a rather minor one in the bigger picture , i would think . 
  ( if say , rapture comstock would have been a brand new resident instead of a long-time one once liz encountered him , i would n't even have thought about it ) . 
  * as for your question about singularity of timelines and their points of origin , multiverse can be depicted as a tree , pretty much . 
  * - the tree analogy is nice and all , but even the baptism can be torn apart by the same train of thought you brought up with the rapture-branching . 
  as you said , the world never revolves around only one person , so even in booker prime 's timeline , there must have been quite a lot of branching originating from other people around him , even if we presume that only one booker out of infinite decided to go to the baptism . 
  this also ignores the possibility of it being a constant ( meaning that it happened to every booker ever who was there at wounded knee ) . 
  looking at it the same way you analyzed rapture comstock 's timeline , there 's no way in hell that there was only a single baptism . 
  so this again seems like a double standard to me . 
  * to be honest , even after considering all these contradictions , it 's still less messed up than burial at sea . 
  * - we might disagree about the quality of that novel here ( i prefer bas 's artistic additions to the series over the novel 's zero new ideas and filler feel overall ) , but fair enough , i did n't remember ids being mentioned ( i doubt that ken did either , he had little to do with the book after all ) , so let 's say it 's canon . 
  what stops liz from faking one ? 
  she 's still full-powered at that point and has access to all sorts of future technology from photocopying to 3d printing , not to mention that she might not need even that seeing that she can pick any lock and break any code . 
  even ignoring that , sander cohen is n't exactly the type who would be hung up by the lack of papers if he sees talent in someone . 
  the id stuff is really such a minor nitpick that it is a lot easier to explain away than even bringing it up as a drawback of any kind . 
  i have n't heard this thrown against bas until now and i 've sure talked with a hell lot of people who wrote its \u201e sins '' on a list . 
  it 's kind of on the same level as the unbruised liz model in the anna flashback . 
  the \u201e sure , it 's an oversight but who cares '' type . 
  * drinkable plasmids could have existed soon after adam 's discovery , but before little sisters were created , even though it still does n't make much sense - after all , fontaine 's crippled worker was bitten by a sea slug ( and its venom was injected into the man 's hand ) . 
  * - i still do n't see how this invalidates the idea of drinkable plasmids in rapture . 
  there 's no statistic about how much adam fontaine could produce pre-little sisters , but it was already confirmed in-game that it was not enough . 
  bas actually ties up that specific retcon pretty neatly , as opposed to a lot of others already mentioned . 
  * that 's the idea of quantum mechanics - when you observe something ( like an atom ) , you see only one of its possible states , no more . 
  so columbias technically ca n't be merged together - because they 're already the same , but in different states . 
  same with elizabeth * - well , same as with my theory , none of the games support that idea . 
  bringing examples of real life quantum theory ( only one of many btw ) is n't going to prove anything in-game , since infinite 's interpretations already departed from that at more than one point . 
  bas states they ( at least liz ) merged together , and there 's nothing in infinite that contradicts that idea ( in fact , things and worlds getting merged together already happened in infinite , just think about the lack of a dead body for booker in the martyr timeline , the half-insane dead soldiers , the lack of another elizabeth and a damaged tower at the end of the game when it should look untouched ) , which again makes it a better-delivered retcon you do n't happen to like ( or i 'd wager that it 's not even a retcon rather than just new info ) . 
  * elizabeth clearly says that a younger version of her wo n't spot her , because she already did n't . 
  so one the one hand , the past can be changed ( infinite ) , on the other something has to happen because it already happened ( burial at sea ) . 
  these two theories strongly collide with each other . 
  * - what makes you believe that they changed anything ? 
  according to my theory , columbia always existed in a bubble universe , connected with the rest only by the points we 've seen . 
  the decision to \u201e end '' it was a grave decision , yet never really a decision at all . 
  maybe , but nothing disproves it , as opposed to complete \u201e erasure '' , and i personally quite like the thought of this ambiguity . 
  i do n't think it takes away any agency from the characters anyhow , because for all we know they * did * create the paradox with their decisions and the other way around at the same time . 
  you claim you do n't view it with back to the future logic , but when you suggest that liz changed an existing course of events to become something entirely different therefore erasing all that came after , you imply linearity at the same time . 
  which infinite itself never explicitly supported ( the only evidence of that would be all elizabeths disappearing or getting \u201e erased '' , but that did n't happen ) . 
  even if you go by the dbz logic ( changing the past sprouts new timelines instead of erasing old ones ) would probably be closer to the truth here , though not quite . 
  * either way , to accept this theory , we have to reject the cause-result dependence . 
  if result can somehow exist without a cause , then comstocks can live even though the died during the baptism . 
  * - cause-result dependence is again linear thinking . 
  bsi leans a lot more towards chicken-egg situations with a handful of paradoxes thrown into it . 
  just think about the impossibility of the thing . 
  if comstock was indeed erased , rendered to something that never actually existed , then how come booker met him , how come we 've seen him in a place that also never supposedly existed , 123 + times no less ? 
  despite your theory , a result * already exists * without a cause , since time is an ocean . 
  liz going back and changing a baptism is not a past event , since past does n't exist . 
  it happens within time itself . 
  clearly , a logical out-of-game explanation would be \u201e because we would n't have a story to show otherwise , duh '' , but not much beyond that . 
  * the easiest solution for the problem is : after the release of infinite , some fans demanded to see rapture - they 've got it , but since many of gamers have n't played the first two games ( their loss ) , they demanded to go back to columbia once again - after all , that 's a familiar place for them .
