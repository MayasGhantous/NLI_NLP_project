  once i even stretched my walk to 10km . 
  i do n't carve fast food anymore , either . 
  too bad i underestimated sugar cravings , even as my sugar tasting ability increased a bit . 
  i 'm proud of my accomplishment nonetheless , as this was the first time i 've tried anything like this . 
  see ya next year !, 
  putting it here so anyone interested can find it . 
  taken from an old ( and bad ) joke , which asks :, 
   how does zorro carve his sign in the czechoslovakian edition ? 
  the answer : ** \u017d ** , which we named the czechoslovakian z ( written as * csehszlov\u00e1k z\u00e9 * in hungarian ) . 
  hello folks !, 
  as the title says , i 'm looking for a winamp5 alternative for linux . 
  of course i have a few requirements which i 'm not willing to let go of :, 
  - wma ( ffmpeg ) support , which is non-negotiable . 
  if the application ca n't play wma on its own ( like audacious or vlc ) it 's disqualified automatically . 
  - a good media library with multiple views , album artist support and watch folders ( just like in winamp ) . 
  - album replay gain ( i do n't think it needs any explanation ) . 
  - gapless playback ( for live albums or `` connected '' songs ) . 
  there are a few other features i 'd like to have but i can manage w/o if necessary :, 
  - mass file converter with wma ( ffmpeg ) support , preferably supporting a file/path patterns based on tags like * `` albumartist \\ year - album \\ nr - title.ext '' * . 
  - replay gain calculator ( with album support of course ) . 
  i 've previously tried wine with zero success ( on ubuntu ) . 
  also , i 'd like to avoid using a vm just to listen to music ... 
  i do appreciate what the youtube mgtows are doing , however , i prefer reading to listening ( my echoic memory is complete garbage ) . 
  i already know about * shedding of the ego * ( bar bar 's ) , * the black pill * ( aka omegavirginrevolt ) , * black poison soul * and some that you guys write . 
  any other recommendations ? 
  * think of the children !!!!!!, 
  ! 44 ! 4 * unicef has launched an anti-molestation advert that is strongly biased against fathers . 
  strongly implying the feminist meme that all men and fathers are pedophile monsters , the [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0iig9h8ibk ) ( with english subs ) shows a little girl showing tips how to lock yourself in your room `` if you want to be left alone '' . 
  the author of the article ( [ original ] ( http://magyaridok.hu/belfold/az-unicefben-aberraltak-dolgoznak-632266/ ) or [ google translated ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=utf-8&u=http%3a%2f%2fmagyaridok.hu%2fbelfold%2faz-unicefben-aberraltak-dolgoznak-632266%2f&edit-text=&act=url ) ) is of course pissed off and feels ashamed because he saw it in the movie theater with her daughter also present . 
  he then goes on a rant about this advert being anti-family ( rightfully so ) .

  there are numerous reasons why prenups get thrown out , tfm lists these ones :, 
  1 . because it 's `` unfair '' to the woman, 
  2 . she can claim you promised to nullify it anyway ( no proof required ), 
  3 . loopholes in law :, 
  - coercion, 
  - preexisting conditions ( cohabitation , children etc. ), 
  - being under the influence ( prenup rape ), 
  that is all . 
  watch and hear * no holds barred * as he turns feminist `` logic '' against itself, 
  tfm debunks a stupid female anti-feminist in this video who claims that * mgtow is like feminism and everybody should just get along * . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub6ofljj-wi ), 
  old school stardusk . 
  he talks about `` love '' ( in the bluepilled sense ) , the red pill rage , the void , and other topics . 
  highly recommended video . 
  [ video link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zi_6eam5eq ), 
  and repeating this like a mantra is only giving pussy pass for sadistic and psychopathic behavior of women . 
  messenger rising 's rant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htwldrxg5t8, 
  this is a message to all who think they 've found their unicorn , that think we 're wrong because nawalt . 
  you might be even right , but only if you expand your acronym a bit further , getting not all women are like that ** right now ** . 
  she seems perfect , right ? 
  how about in 30 years when the kids have already left university and are living on their own ? 
  will your precious be the same unicorn you committed your life to , forever together in good and bad like your marriage vows said ? 
  ** or will she divorce rape your sorry ass once you 've outlived your usefulness ? 
  do you really want to bet your life 's work on it ? 
  ** divorce rates vary from country from country , and the usa has it pretty good with its 50 % . 
  others ( especially bloopers ) just wan na prove awalt wrong by saying nawalt and trying to hold up a counter example . 
  the only moment you can be exactly sure about her unicorn quality are the last seconds before she dies , and only if you know her complete life . 
  and after that , she dies , and you 're back where you started . 
  ( as for proving awalt : just look into evolutionary psychology , the answer is there , this post is n't about that . ), 
  what then ? 
  go mgtow and you 'll spare lots of headaches in the long run , meanwhile enjoying life !, 
  and your `` obligations '' towards society ? 
  ** why the fuck would you care about a society that does n't care about you ? 
  ** fuck them . 
  found this quote at the end of the [ los bambinos del satan - on the road with mayhem ] ( https://youtu.be/5rf3b-rjwdg?t=28m27s ) documentary :, 
   i come home from a tour , exhausted , with my basses , suitcases , loads of plastic bags , and my tax-free quota . 
  then i find out i have forgotten my key . 
  i have to break a window . 
  it 's ten degrees below zero inside . 
  the toilet has cracked . 
  the tv has frozen . 
  and so on . 
   and i think about my bandmates , who were picked up by their girlfriends and driven home to a hot meal and a clean bed . 
  a warm house . 
  why do n't i have that ? 
   then the fireplace does its job . 
  the tv comes to life . 
  the electrical equipment starts working . 
   and i think : right about now they 're getting yelled at about what happened on tour . 
  what were those facebook pictures ? 
  and i think :, 
   maybe my life is n't so bad after all ? 
  in other words , the water is wet : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmq9quvzbte, 
  `` she '' has even disabled comments . 
  just another tradcon that wants to go back to a time that does n't exist anymore . 
  `` she '' `` understands '' our plight but still wants us to man up and get married ... 
  this is a rant about the player types that think that * you have to be able to get laid to be mgtow * and the celibate ( both ) types that say * having sex is still bluepilled af * . 
  you know who you are , and you 're all retards . 
  sure , both behaviors can be so extreme that you define yourself by them , and then you might not be mgtow yet and need more time to help with your thinking . 
  but as long as you live for yourself and you do n't do these obsessively you 're fine in my book . 
  ca n't get laid but you do n't care about it that much ? 
  you can find nsa sex any day but you do n't let it get to your head ? 
  good !, 
  both are great ways to be mgtow and it 's up to you . 
  those who do have still some learning to do .
