  it seems they have n't learned from gamergate ... they have n't learned that fucking with omegas is like shooting yourself in the ass with a nailgun . 
  and i 've said it many times but i 'll say it again . 
  trp is not going anywhere . 
  sjws ca n't push their agenda if they do n't have someone to point at as ** the ** enemy . 
  summoning / u/rollo-tomassi as he might want to do something about it . 
  lots of shit gets blocked by firefox too ( no flash or java plugin , abp etc. ) . 
  if i ever download something suspicious ( 2-3 times a year max ) i immediately upload it to virustotal for a quick check . 
  and once in a month we have the malicious software removal tool via windows update . 
  because that 's the way of the blue pill . 
  i like this plan . 
  she ca n't get a restraining order against all white males of the country ... 
  i find it funny that feminists could use this quote to `` prove '' the patriarchy . 
  i hope you realize that having children and not marrying are ** not ** mutually exclusive . 
  not these days . 
  you still wo n't have you pay alimony if you were never married ( even common law ) . 
  sweden yes !, 
  of course they do n't , sj is a religion on its own ( `` listen and believe '' ) . 
  hopefully . 
  he 's rumored to wear high heels on set to appear taller . 
  damn it , man . 
  i know our women are beautiful to outsiders but seriously , stop and think for a minute . 
  they 're also being westernized , so no unicorns here either . 
  never forget awalt , they all seem perfect up to the point you gave yourself over , then you 'll see what they 're really like . 
  the best course of action would be to next her and get a few more plates until you forget her . 
  you will have regret for leaving her , but how much regret will you have when she takes all your shit and makes you pay child support ? 
  it 's simply not worth it . 
  you do n't believe me ? 
  move in with her ( make sure common law shit does n't apply ) and after a while you 'll see what she 's really like . 
  an old bmw like the [ e30 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bmw_3_series_%28e30%29 ) would be a nice choice for me , but i do n't actually need a car as public transportation is good enough ( think about rush hour vs trams/trains/underground ) . 
  looking at our history and our location on the map it 's almost true . 
  genetically it 's like the usa , simply with mostly caucasian material , with some invaders here and there . 
  you do speak like someone with a major oneitis . 
  apart from that , watch sandman 's [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hekmpa6ihbk ) on eastern women ( we are often regarded eastern ) , and you 'll see how awalt is not caused by feminism , it was simply brought in the spotlight . 
  6 months are not enough , sometimes it takes years for a woman to show her true colors . 
  our family cat is dumb as fuck ( even compared to other cats ) , but sometimes even she seems to be smarter than your average feminist . 
  all feminists `` live '' in the past , as far as arguments go . 
  the moment i point that out they launch an all-out ad hominem . 
  after that i just start linking [ fallacies ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ ) and laugh in their faces . 
  if you have n't read [ this gem ] ( https://archive.is/mv9ks ) about feminists ( trp archive link ) do it asap . 
  the most extreme mgtows i read do define doing anything with/for women as gynocentric , even paying taxes . 
  that 's what the sub is about , although not exclusively . 
  a lot of ( ex - ) incels and divorced men find the sub day after day . 
  most of them wan na make up for missing out . 
  i personally found it on a self-improvement blog ( thumotic ) . 
  i do n't even remember how i came across it but must have been from an mra site . 
  i do n't find any of these to be mutually exclusive ( except roosh ' neomasculinity bullshit ) . 
  blue pill men usually believe women more , so i 'd recommend a female `` mgtow '' ( i know ... ) , her name is diana davison and her yt channel is named [ feminism lol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucvrqqugdrbevsdgoee1dl3a ) . 
  dunno which would be the best choice but you can check her out and choose a video yourself . 
  i 'll start gathering the reasons why the eu must fall , and fall heavily . 
  even if our current government is against neoliberalism they still infect our lives . 
  it 's also funny how these anti-gender idiots want children to have two genderless ( male-female hybrid ) parents instead of a man and a woman . 
  they 'll fall so hard when the libtard way will fail !, 
  some mgtows think of trp as a gynocentric shithole , though . 
  if op 's country has neutral discrimination laws ( and not the pc bullshit ) he could just out them for it and watch how they get a huge fine . 
  but yeah , do n't work there . 
  she also sounds post-wall . 
  why do n't you just next her ? 
  you googled wrong bro : http://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/ministry-of-culture/, 
  it seems like someone did n't care for the sidebar ... 
  and feminists are complaining that rape accusers are not taken seriously ... 
  i simply have * no idea * why !, 
  of course it wo n't happen but i hope she gets a few years eventually . 
  sandman ( mgtow , youtuber ) lives there and he claims that it 's the worst place feminism-wise . 
  another nocturnal reporting in . 
  i 'm usually sleepy all day ( unless i drink a coffee or two ) but would awake as the sun goes down . 
  not anymore though because i 'm too tired from not sleeping enough ( i can almost never sleep before midnight , and maybe i 've never slept well in all my life , which is a quarter of a century ) . 
  another reason for that might be i 'm consciously spending more and more time out in sunlight , even sunbathing at some weekends . 
  i tried not going to sleep at all for a day to reset my cycle , but it did n't work . 
  going to bed earlier also did nothing as i got pissed by not being able to sleep ( and the noises ) . 
  the environment also counts , as it was pretty hard to fall asleep in a dorm where everyone is too loud , even if they 're doing their best ( earplugs helped a lot with that ) , so you might to change your accommodations ( moving out of dorm was a wise choice ) . 
  what else have you tried ? 
  [ of course ] ( http://scgnews.com/leaked-documents-ukraines-new-president-works-for-the-us-state-department ) he did , he works for the usa . 
  i do n't really know about any politicians that are n't corrupt and wo n't steal if they can . 
  not here anyway . 
  also , the previous cabinet did basically the same thing , they were only privatizing to their friends instead of collectivizing ( and public face ofc ) . 
  the phrase means that you should n't deceive people about your personality . 
  on the other hand , most people have no idea what they should answer to these questions , so this answer remains . 
  also , it does n't forbid self-improvement . 
  you can always lose weight . 
  the progress content and the community of r/keto is very promising and supportive ( that 's why i hopped in ) , and you can do a lot of exercises at home or without others . 
  do n't do that for acceptance , do it for your health . 
  i guess it 's time to boycott the place . 
  tell all your friends , have them tell all their friends , even include women in this . 
  if you do it well the place will suffer financially . 
  the site you need is archive.is ( inb4 they blacklist that too ) . 
  edit : ca n't the automod be programmed to auto-approve avfm links ? 
  how about a different bot ? 
  thanks for the heads up . 
  just leave the usa . 
  i 'm sure that western europe will be more than happy to take you in , and it 's safer here than there . 
  did you remove the top flair links on purpose or is that a bug ? 
  it 's there , but now the top bar looks empty . 
  were n't people finding the links on top or why was it changed ? 
  sub style as i did n't even know about res until now . 
  i 'm also sure it ca n't be adblock plus as it was visible before the sidebar update ( and nothing changed in my browser ) . 
  that 's why i asked if it 's a bug or was on purpose . 
  the sidebar itself is ok , and i made a [ picture ] ( http://imgur.com/pojvcj2 ) of what 's missing . 
  you should pm him about this . 
  i 'm sure he would approve , but maybe he would want to do it himself . 
  if you are using firefox on your desktop or laptop , it will load the . pdf in a pdf viewer in browser , and not automatically download .
