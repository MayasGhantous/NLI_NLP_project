  you ca n't split the world as good vs evil . 
  divide and conquer , bro . 
  part of the media protects white people , while the [ sjw ] ( https://i.imgur.com/i40qasw.jpg ) media hates whites with passion . 
  that makes whites hate non-whites and non-whites hate whites . 
  sjw-ism can be related to feminism , which is known to be of [ jewish ] ( http://theendofzion.com/feminism-a-jewish-war-on-femininity/ ) origin . 
  and who are constantly harassed by feminists ? 
  normal white guys . 
  i 'm sure they 'll make up a reason how this is our fault like everything else . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i find it funny how you go all condescending on me instead of providing a picture ... 
  i 'm not even murrican , how would i know it 's windy ? 
  but surely there must be a huge still lake to demonstrate ... right ? 
  if you keep reaching out but they never reciprocate you 'll realize that they simply do n't want you around . 
  finding a new group wo n't be easy , but probably easier than fighting fruitless battles for a bunch of people . 
  this is why i 'm proud of our current government : they give the middle finger to brussels . 
  they can take away the financial support , we 'll live as we always have . 
  everyone seems to forget about us ( hu ) while we also get similar amounts via serbia . 
  works for me . 
  unfortunately , i was n't entirely serious about this . 
  as far as i know that was a simple disinfo, 
  by not banning them reddit goes as far as supporting war and genocide . 
  if only their sponsors knew ... 
  they also jail you for [ paternity testing ] ( https://archive.is/b0fq4 ) . 
  seriously , fuck france . 
  you 're probably right . 
  ask the [ rockefellers ] ( http://www.savethemales.ca/130302.html ) . 
  why do n't you guys just use firefox or something more hardened ? 
  you guys need a shit ton of guy fawkes , just saying ... 
  it 's only a gut feeling and i have no proof . 
  they 'll nuke a city . 
  not in the name of is , but either russia or china , and then we 'll have ww3 on our hands . 
  corporations will have more political power than countries signing this deal . 
  an example : ttip is much like tpp ( for the eu ) . 
  where i live growing anything gmo is banned and the government has repeatedly destroyed gmo corps . 
  if this deal passes , we 'll all be forced to eat their gm shit . 
  i hope that either the eu rejects the deal ( not likely ) or we simply leave the eu . 
  they 'll blame it on the brics somehow , i 'm sure of it . 
  from here 9/11 also seems `` too bold '' it still happened . 
  sure , not the same magnitude , but treason nonetheless . 
  salon is soo trustworthy ( sarcasm ! ), 
  that i 'd rather take cia at face value before believing that site . 
  note : i do n't believe anything cia says, 
  edit : rolling stone + uva rape hoax ? 
  no thanks !, 
  these sources are not `` meh '' , they 're known propaganda sites . 
  and let me see the other `` great '' sources , because until then it 's nothing more than disinfo . 
  at least he did n't suffer an `` accident '' for whatever he knows . 
  rape and cp claims are well known disarming tactics . 
   this has been confirmed and verified by multiple sources like mr. snowden , wikileaks , various whistle blowers and independent journalists . 
  how about some links to your claims then ? 
  open up audacity , start recording and start knocking on your computer everywhere w / the same strength . 
  or maybe snowden is a cia agent , right in russia where he can do the most damage ... 
  because he 's no vassal of the usa . 
  the sooner the eu realizes that we 'd be better off with them than with the usa ( or even neutral to both ) the better it would be for all of us . 
  they also feel the same about orbiters too , believe me . 
  thanks . 
   you can triple fact check, 
  what 's good about being `` friends '' ( slaves ) of the usa ? 
  forced multiculturalism ? 
  `` rape culture '' ? 
  `` protecting '' ( covertly occupying ) our lands ? 
  freedom ? 
  even their citizens are n't free anymore . 
  look how they 're manipulated into martial law ( shootings , jade helm 15 etc. ) . 
  r/conspiracy is your friend . 
  if you want traffic enable comments ( possibly w / captcha ) . 
  or maybe you 're too lazy to check the rules of arguing . 
  unless they 're gon na ban everyone they have no chance . 
  `` dear monsanto , how does it feel to be [ war criminals ] ( http://humansarefree.com/2015/06/monsanto-supplied-us-and-israel-with.html ) ? '', 
  if you make a claim and someone asks for proof then you provide it , not this `` you can google it yourself '' shit . 
  also , there 're different sources of knowledge that contradict each other , so debates are a good way to shed light on incorrect details . 
  since i claimed your sources as worthless all you do is attacking me instead of my point . 
  just a distraction about things that really matter ( like tpp ) . 
  head over to the conspiracy sub for more info . 
  why was the sidebar image changed and what 's the story behind it ? 
  i missed it somehow . 
  archived image mirror [ here ] ( https://archive.is/p2gzg ) . 
   china , a partner in the tpp, 
  tpp was designed to ** exclude ** china ( check a map ) , not to take them in . 
  please take your sjw shit somewhere else . 
  in the past men worked at workplaces and women worked at home . 
  raising a family is huge work even if feminists say it 's not . 
  the whole oppression shit is a lie perpetuated by the elites to create race and gender warfare while they can rob everyone . 
  watch some videos by tl ; dr to get back to reality . 
  [ erin pizzey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erin_pizzey ) . 
  got a tl ; dr for that video ? 
  i do n't really have the time to watch it . 
  i did check them but as these sites are generally spreading bullshit i rather not believe what they say . 
  to break it down :, 
  - rt : anything close to a government should automatically be suspicious and they have repeatedly been caught lying, 
  - salon , huffpost and rolling stone are well known feminist clickbait shitholes, 
  - infowars : i 've seen it slammed as disinfo at multiple places ( even here ) , it 's also too sensationalist to my taste ( another red flag ), 
  - drudgereport asks for login, 
  i trust nothing blindly . 
  i 'm yet to come across a news site that 's actually neutral ( reuters maybe coming close ) . 
  apart from that : no obvious and overwhelming political bias , respect towards readers ( not the condescending tone of leftist media ) and preferably containing/sourcing proof that can be scientifically tested . 
  i heard a rumor that they want to leave the eu `` because of the hungarians '' . 
  how much truth is to that ? 
  thank you for a better source . 
  it 's good to see that even the usa ca n't evade the fate of huge empires .
