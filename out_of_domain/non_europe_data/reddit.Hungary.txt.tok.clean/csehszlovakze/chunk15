  all sjws i came across are seriously fucked up in the head and in the looks department . 
  happier now ? 
   hurt me ** in **, 
  sounds like buttsecks . 
   admins may also shadowban your whole account if you are caught brigading . 
  well , yeah . 
  except srs . 
  they can even dox someone without penalty . 
  i ca n't wait till a `` war '' erupts between muslims and sjws . 
  bring the popcorn !, 
  which one ? 
  the present one or the one they used to be ? 
  because right now they 're selling out , leaving all the far right stuff behind . 
  the old jobbik was pretty anti-semitic and against gypsies ( when their paramilitary was still active ) . 
  now vona ( party leader ) has gone all `` cutesy '' ( posing with puppies ) and reprimanding a member for speaking out against gypsies . 
  on the other hand , they do support men 's rights issues , being the only ones here . 
  i do n't really trust them . 
  in fact , i do n't trust any parties in this country or anywhere else in this world . 
  `` all politicians are like that '' is something that 's often said and rings too true . 
  it might be so . 
  however , there 're rumors about some old members leaving and wanting to create a new party that will be true to its roots . 
  yeah , fidesz started to move closer to the far right , mainly to take away votes . 
  i ca n't say it 's not working . 
  people not brainwashed by neoliberalism have always been suspicious of gypsies and immigrants , and orb\u00e1n is now attacking the latter group . 
  might be only for votes/show ( should have erected the fence in total quiet ) . 
  the opposition is doing nothing , though . 
  sometimes they say this or that but i 'm sure they 're content with the money they get . 
  only [ democratic coalition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_coalition_%28hungary%29 ) can be a real threat , as they 're [ covertly ] ( http://bbj.hu/politics/government-forwards-evidence-to-brussels-regarding-altus-affair-_98726 ) supported by brussels . 
  the sub r/european has already made a backup forum over the site made by the mods ( european guardian ) , why is n't trp doing the same ? 
  he 's probably more busy with building his empire than actually helping the people . 
  we ( the hungarian people ) are left alone with our learned helplessness , just the way the elites like it . 
  no winning alternatives here . 
  some polls indicate that the majority would simply choose `` none of the above '' on an election if that was possible . 
  puerarchy does n't have a functioning forum now ( as far as i can tell ) , while the mods of r/european have already urged us to `` pack our stuff '' and start using the forum instead . 
  not actually buying of course , just setting a few values here and there ... 
  this shows how useless alt medicine is ... ( it is n't ), 
  i 've seen it back when it was n't banned , it was like an anti-conspiracy tentacle of srs . 
  / u/ramblinrambo3 teg still does n't have an rss feed :(, 
  good idea . 
  we need to do the exact opposite of what ttip stands for . 
  [ not it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oracle_america,_inc._v._google,_inc . 
  have you read what i linked ? 
  oracle just ensured the death of the it industry by making apis protected by copyright . 
  the precedent and the chain reaction will kill most it companies ( vendor lock-in is the least problem ) , linux will be sued off the face of the internet . 
  every bubble bursts once , it seems like this is the time for us . 
  it would have been way too trivial . 
   violence is not the answer , violence is the question , and the answer is yes . 
  joke aside , soon people will realize how full of shit the left is ( hopefully not too late ) and when conditions become unbearable they 'll fight back . 
  they will fight once there 's no other way . 
  and when that happens god save the usa because the collective wrath of europe will turn against them . 
  of course it does n't work when the problem seems to be `` too far away '' from their complacent lives . 
  source ? 
   even the men are female today, 
  unfortunately you 're correct . 
  what do you think , would have been there an `` outrage '' this big if a male employee was fired ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   do you ever see parallels between your orban and our erdogan ? 
  exactly what i was about to mention . 
  most definitely . 
  and they 're surprised that more and more people turn their heads towards russia . 
  the eu should die , at least in its current form : a failed neoliberal dystopia run by sociopaths . 
  from that on we 'll either have a different kind of alliance or we go back to older times , a bunch of nations . 
  at least we wo n't be raped by ttip if we do . 
  my guess is that some idiots were jealous of the usa and wanted to copy them badly . 
  too bad the usa was more-less homogenous when created . 
   who contributed as much as she did, 
  you mean doing what they 're payed for ? 
  where was the outrage when the guy with leukemia was fired from reddit ? 
  no mass-blackout , that 's for sure . 
  so many manginas on this site ... * sigh *, 
  too bad the eu is more a lapdog of the usa these days . 
  i did n't really expect this site to be linked here . 
  i wo n't address everything , but in short : you 're extremely naive ( or a shill ) , and you ca n't see the `` soviet usa '' unfolding right before your eyes . 
  you should check out some posts over r/conspiracy so your eyes will open to the betrayal your elites have committed against you . 
  i just like calling them ** international monetary fraud ** . 
  i feel this sub wo n't be around for much long . 
  no , no , no , no , no !, 
  if that was the case r/theredpill would have been killed off ( a shitload of leftist websites have called to end it ) and it 's still up and running . 
  no , fph was removed because they started to mess with imgur staff , who could have sued the whole site if it was n't contained . 
   the u.s. was founded as a free nation for free whites . 
  that 's why i called you naive . 
  it * was * free but it 's not anymore . 
  note i have no problem with nationalism ( i 'm one too ) but you should n't trust your current political elite . 
  most countries need a huge ass revolution to remove the elite , and to decrease the influence of big corporations later on . 
  i know it 's not the average guy 's fault , do n't worry . 
  we have a common enemy . 
  there 's a difference between being allies and being vassals . 
  the latter is more because of nsa and the power of the possible knowledge that represents ( meaning : blackmailing ) . 
  no , i simply consider gynocentrism and the general userbase . 
  i , for one , would be more pissed because of dacvac ( i do n't let it phase me , though ) . 
  reddit can be happy they 're in the usa because here in europe they 'd be hit with a huge ass fine as stuff like that is perfectly illegal here . 
  on the other hand , i have seen other admins far more active than her , and i 'm sure most users would n't shed tears for them either ( not talking about the asshat admins but the normal ones ) . 
  i can understand , though . 
  she 's indeed attractive , and might have fallen for her myself a few years back , now i simply know better . 
  i do check it out myself sometimes , but you know , * `` hurr durr conspiracy '' * . 
  this sub now feels even more open than before . 
  not for long . 
  too bad the nice guys these `` women '' settle for ( after hitting the wall ) will get it as well . 
  feminist saying stupid shit ? 
  so surprising !,
