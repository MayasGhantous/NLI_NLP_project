  if i were a mod i 'd ban you for linking to clickbait shit directly . 
   ca n't seem to find anyone in r/conspiracy who is willing to really engage this thesis on the merits, 
  do n't want to go to prison . 
  go and check our r/theredpill if you have n't yet . 
  internalize it all , become good at it . 
  by the time you master it you either wo n't give a shit about others ( bad from our point of view ) or you can covertly ( w/o the lingo ) teach the principles to others , especially to your ( future ) children . 
  get used to the feminazi tyranny then . 
  sluts doing sex tourism ? 
  in other words , the water is wet . 
  gypsies . 
  of course they call themselves hungarian when shit 's around the corner , painting us in a bad light . 
  trp is a huge chunk of info , take what you need , leave the rest . 
  i also said `` something '' about the selfishness , and you 'd know it if you actually read my comment . 
  trolling both them and the sjws , probably even turning them against each other . 
  awesome !, 
   seek to cut them off all of their friends and interests, 
  shit test . 
  i 'm staying . 
  hopefully we can get rid of all the political parasites in 2018 and hopefully it will all get better then . 
  however , i 'm not getting my hopes up . 
  if all turns shit ( like the whole country bombed ) i 'll either leave for finland or russia . 
  that 's much older . 
  no ma'am ( a mgtow blog ) has posted that back in 2001 : http://no-maam.blogspot.com/2001/01/roissys-sixteen-commandments-of-poon.html, 
  `` if it looks stupid but works it ai n't stupid . '', 
  or gamergate . 
  `` rational `` wiki is even worse . 
  it 's an anti-corruption movement in the gaming industry . 
  since lots of female game developers are on the bad side , the sjws keep labeling the movement as misogynist . 
  check [ kym ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate ) or r/kotakuinaction for factual info . 
  ( from hu btw ), 
  snowden is allegedly a cia agent , right where he needs to be ... 
  can you remember a post about `` moderate feminists '' on here ? 
  ( [ link ] ( https://archive.is/exhce ) ) that leaves anti-feminists ( she is clearly one , just check her other videos ) as allies of the mra cause , so imho the video has a place . 
  on the `` young woman '' part i agree to an extent , though . 
  you spelled * money * wrong , bro . 
  now i know why i get downvoted by idiots when asking for proof of their claims . 
  ** listen & believe \u2122 ** , just like at the sjw camp . 
  seriously , fuck you guys . 
  too bad that would reduce their population badly , but i can offer some sort of compensation : they can take all the gypsies !, 
   he is the only european leader truly trying to stop his country from being overrun with migrants, 
  no , he 's not . 
  he 'd have restored border patrols by now if that was the case . 
  i see you misunderstood me . 
  i tend to be actually skeptical , unlike some inhabitants of the sub ( e.g. 
  seeing the fake sandra bland post get almost 1k upvotes ) . 
  i also dislike random claims so i ask for source . 
  it 's always downvoted , even if i get the source later and the claim turns out to be complete bs . 
  also , ever heard about the fallacy * [ burden of proof ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof ) * ? 
  i already know what orb\u00e1n would answer to her :, 
   go back to the kitchen, 
  what 's wrong with not being constantly materialistic ? 
  that 's how our lives became devoid of fulfillment and happiness . 
  while religion is an important aspect of spirituality , it 's not the only one nor the only way . 
  the `` rolled up eyes '' pic is most definitely fake , as you can see the original position of her eyes under the whitening . 
  also , if her eyes were really up on the pic her iris was narrower , not full-width . 
  no idea about the other picture , though . 
  at least he does what jobbik was originally made for . 
  those shitbags only bitch when it 's the `` straight white cis male '' and only because they can do it w/o consequences . 
  dear sjws : try doing that to a migrant ... they would cut you into little pieces . 
  the funniest is that some guys are on the list because of r/subredditcancer , as they ca n't really justify that sub with sjw shit , can they ? 
  that shows their real colors perfectly . 
  the you 'd be banned instead , not the ones you 'd complain about . 
  they wo n't do shit unless the sjws hurt them economically . 
  too bad this type is easy to con with useless shit ( e.g. 
  merch ) , so they are the primary target of all the ads . 
  unless a huge political change happens and they get to seen as the bad guys , they 're staying . 
  if you ever came across jessica `` i bathe in male tears '' valenti there you 'd know that none of their shit is to be trusted . 
  letting a feminazi spread her venom , and even being supportive ? 
  no thanks !, 
  you do n't even know what np is for . 
  it 's a simple css `` hack '' that will tell you that you should n't vote on shit ( or hiding the vote buttons altogether ) . 
  also ,, 
  url.replace ( ` www.reddit ' , ` np.reddit ' ) ;, 
  is bs because there 's something you could call a localized url , e.g. 
  fr.reddit.com for the french translation of the site . 
  so basically you 'd go after all localized links . 
  i do , probably better than you . 
  np is used by some subs on their discretion . 
  there are other subs that enforce ( or not ) np rule . 
  and , unless some policies in this sub have changed , here 're the rules of 3 subs i frequent :, 
  - r/conspiracy will let normal reddit links but with an automod warning ( which is annoying as fuck ), 
  - r/european only allows np-links , automod deletes normal links, 
  - r/theredpill allows no reddit links at all ( screenshot or archive site required ), 
  from a few comments here and there i can surely say that site coders are lazy as fuck ( see shadowbans vs no `` normal '' site-wide bans ) . 
  check out the source on github to see how whe whole site is nothing more than a `` hack '' . 
  that might be my fault as i wrote to the mods that they should either remove the annoying `` warning '' or start enforcing the np rule . 
  they are probably too lazy to search-replace thousands of links ( and i 'm not sure they have the permission to edit comments ) . 
  yeah , i shit my pants every 5 minutes upon seeing that horse face . 
  so what ? 
  rt does the same thing , they are still kremlin-owned ( state propaganda ) . 
  so , apart from the usual qualifiers , upon auditing a woman for work she should be young , married , a bit chubby and say no to `` do you even feminism , * bro * '' . 
  makes sense , actually . 
  how are you with physical exercises ( e.g. 
  weightlifting ) ? 
  it wo n't cure your depression but it will help to an extent . 
  sorry brits , but i hope that will happen . 
  it will hurt on the short run but i 'm sure that the next election will be won by a `` xenophobic '' party , just like everywhere else , and then we can start cleansing of our continent . 
  i agree with the post title , but not with the body . 
  some guys who post about them seem to be bitter about that sub , and they come here for a europe-hater echo chamber . 
  just like a child or a crazy ex-girlfriend .
