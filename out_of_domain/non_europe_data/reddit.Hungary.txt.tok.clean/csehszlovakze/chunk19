  i 'm sure we 're better than this . 
  we all know that that sub is a libtard shithole tyranned around by sjws . 
  we all know that they hate the `` straight white cis male '' , the majority of this continent ( i hope we 're still the majority ) . 
  does * bitching and moaning * about a few shitheads change anything ? 
  are they representative of europe ? 
  i do n't think so , most definitely not of the eastern regions . 
  how about the migrants ? 
  i 'm sure we all wan na know the news , either good or bad . 
  maybe to pass around a few petitions , or anything else that can help save our heritage . 
  i say we shall not talk about * the sub that shall not be named * anymore . 
  hacking it and changing a few words ( especially in sandnigga speech ) to make them avoid us . 
  i ca n't help , though . 
  neo-nazis and immature kids tend to name their pets after hitler . 
  uhm ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2nkjnvwuau, 
  i said what 's true around here , not necessary on the whole planet . 
  well said . 
  both the usa and russia are enemies of an independent white europe , both sides of the same coin , which is called the [ nwo ] ( https://deusnexus.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/brics-two-nwos/ ) by some . 
  got a non-paywalled link or text ? 
  gim me a working winamp ( wine ? ), 
  with wma ( ffmpeg ) support ( no virtual machines ) and i 'm out . 
  until then i 'll have to keep using win7 . 
  the whole reason i stayed on win7 so far is winamp + wma ( ffmpeg ) playback . 
  all other media players i 've tried are unusable for me and i 'm not willing to convert months worth of music to mp3 ( which has shitty metadata support ) , other formats are also out of the question ( my small player only supports these ) and running a vm just for music is bullshit . 
  there 's a far better hack : do n't update . 
  i know , but its media library functions are less than basic . 
  it sounds better than same rate mp3 , wo n't eat all storage like flac ( and most cheap players do n't support it ) and has better metadata handling . 
  when i looked i found nothing . 
  it 's very tiresome to delete and re-add everything when i add a new album to the collection . 
  for videos i use it as well ( even if it takes a minute to start and the dev wants us to whitelist it on antivirus ) . 
  never came across any usb player that supports aac and i do n't want to do anything with crapple . 
  tried it once on linux , did n't even want to touch wma files and i had everything installed . 
  the only success story is vlc but its media library handling is close to unusable . 
  i know . 
  i always clean tags first ( embedded album art is my nemesis ) then tag manually with winamp . 
  the problem comes when you have international characters , which is handled well in wma but not in mp3 . 
  this was a few years ago , and have n't checked since . 
  it might have been fixed since then . 
  it was an ubuntu 12.04 install if i remember correctly . 
  not only that ... is that even legal ? 
  where i live it is n't . 
  i 've seen broken id3 tags on many platforms ( including small usb players ) , none with wma files . 
  i know that . 
  i also stated in a comment that i have n't come across a simple usb player ( or '' [ mp3 player ] ( http://www.tuvie.com/wp-content/uploads/sony-walkwam-nwz-b160-music-player4.jpg ) '' as it 's called here ) that would do anything else than mp3 , wma or wav ( or too expensive for a small stick ) . 
  i also stated that lossless takes up too much space compared to lossy . 
  i know that vlc works with wmas ( the only player that does out-of-box , or at all for me ) but its media library functionality has much to be desired ( e.g. 
  not having to re-add everything if an album is added ) . 
  the only problem with ** win ** amp is bolded , but i 'm sure they 'll go cross-platform once they refactor `` problematic '' code . 
  did n't really have much success upon trying alternative music players ( meaning : i hated them all ) . 
  thank you . 
  we need to find our own way , as both the western and the eastern have failed . 
  most people ca n't do better than binary thinking . 
  as someone in center europe i realized that neither the usa nor russia will be good as `` overlord '' , we need to find our own voice . 
  sandman and tl ; dr have showed in their videos how feminism has done so little for women 's right to vote . 
  if we could only correct this misinfo , feminism would cease to exist in a short time . 
  not yet but i 'll check it out when i get around to it . 
  i already have winamp for windows . 
  all the alternative player stuff would be so i could leave permanently . 
  i got a few ideas in this thread yesterday which i 'll try in a vm later . 
  i realized that . 
  you 'd think that folks on this sub would be more open-minded and intelligent but i 've lost my faith in this community after a while . 
  i 'm sure this comes from childhood when relatives/friends/classmates / villagers were quick to make fun of the smallest mistake . 
  you all need to remind yourself that that time is now over . 
  both windows down ? 
  throw them a smoke grenade then floor it . 
  ( i 'm kidding ofc . ), 
  not low enough . 
  not yet . 
  so how do you propose we kill feminism in europe ? 
  having border patrols restored would do far more good to us than a simple fence . 
  cucks ? 
  how strong is leftism over there ? 
  i could say the same about isis and the [ usa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2nkjnvwuau ) . 
  still not the fathers of isis like [ some other country ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2nkjnvwuau ) ... 
  i define it as it 's on the west , ie . 
  sjws , feminists and other lowlifes . 
  yep :, 
  sandman : [ destroying male spaces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iff0t3otsr8 ), 
  tl ; dr : [ onision does n't understand women against feminism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utabyxu_u-i ), 
  ( edit : markdown sucks ), 
  no , i 'm sure that radioactivity has no effect on algae . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  fukushima has n't been contained yet ( radioactive water is still getting out ) and it 's been going on for 4 years . 
  now the whole ocean is filled with radioactive crap . 
  even the west coast of usa [ is affected ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-thyroid-cancer-ess.html ) now . 
  mind giving some sources to your claims ? 
  because until then , those are baseless claims . 
  zerohedge also disagrees with you . 
  no sources then . 
  class dismissed . 
   i will gladly take my chances and have my kid vaccinated, 
  murderer . 
  if you 're so concerned with guilt by association y u no just gtfo ? 
  either controlled opposition or the selected front for the nwo . 
  he 's too likable not to be suspicious as fuck . 
  whatever , bro . 
  i do n't think so . 
  too bad . 
  you know the saying `` just because you 're paranoid , that does n't mean they are n't out there to get you '' , right ? 
  i 'll make a similar one :, 
  * `` just because you 're labeled anti-semitic for your statement it does n't necessarily mean you 're wrong .
