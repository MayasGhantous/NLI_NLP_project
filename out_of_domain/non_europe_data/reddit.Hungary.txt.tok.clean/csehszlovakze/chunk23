  actually no , i was n't . 
  i 've lived long enough not to trust women and their words . 
  gww is an mra in my book and i treat her as such . 
  and sweden of course . 
  lol, 
  that 's because these `` trade '' `` agreements '' are crafted against brics . 
  there 's a `` lesser shadow ban '' per subreddit and is controlled by the mods , probably via the beloved automoderator . 
  you can see the user page , even their comments on the sub , but you ca n't see the same comments on the subreddit itself . 
  because sjws have infested the media . 
  they also provide much needed distraction ( for tptb ) from the things that actually count . 
  the following around part for example . 
  slightly unrelated , but i personally consider the `` girl asks guy out '' thing to be a huge red flag . 
  it 's a gut feeling and ca n't really explain it . 
  you really underestimate your enemies if you think it 's just the conservatives against you ... even the silent majority hates your kind but are too scared because there 's no one to protect them from your online mobs . 
  by default idgas about post histories because it 's easy to post a few fake comments , but all i saw is you defending sjws and bitching about conservatives ... even bigger fail because i 'm not even close to being one , even if you 're desperately looking for made-up reasons to demonize me . 
  nice try , sjw !, 
  * look at me !, 
  i have so much comment karma !, 
  i am the best over here !, 
  * seriously , * bro * , who gives a shit ? 
  if you would have done your homework you 'd see how i 'm not a tradcon ... but i guess everyone who disses your kind is one . 
  your inability to think only in black and white shows that you 're an sjw . 
  and since you 're so obvious and we 're here on r/conspiracy i 'll go ahead and say that you 're an undercover sjw , looking for targets . 
  so , what 's next ? 
  threatening my family ? 
  nuking europe , just to be sure ? 
  come on !, 
  maybe i misinterpreted op but i did . 
  i would n't consider it to be a red flag in the western world , but since i 'm in a post communist country ... here if you get more than iois it 's a red flag . 
  probably plain crazy , or maybe just no one wants her , and certainly with a good reason . 
  i do n't install recommended updates , but i hid the update as soon as it was offered , just to be sure . 
  on * ` us ' * ask the article author . 
  i hope they 've also disabled canonical 's spyware shit in mint . 
  more shaming language ... come back when you have basic conversation skills . 
  depends . 
  if only a few attacks it could be a ff . 
  but if isis went on to actually hit them hard ... 
  people forget pretty fast . 
  india is practically an [ sco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_shanghai_cooperation_organisation ) member now . 
  i mean they actually move their asses over to israel and take land from them ( at least try ) , like they did until now . 
  until that , isis = mossad for me . 
  if you go and assume no nukes then bitcoin . 
  seal it into a faraday cage so it wo n't be wiped by emps . 
  if all turns the worst ( global nuclear war ) it probably wo n't matter anymore . 
  because there were no occurrences in history when men made `` silly superstitions '' a reality to control the stupid masses , right ? 
  to me you sound as an isis supporter ... so yeah , they should attack israel with full force . 
  i know it 'd be suicide on their part , but 1 ) they 'd have their precious jihad fulfilled 2 ) wiped out 3 ) israel could do something useful for a change . 
  but we both know it 'll never happen . 
  does it matter ? 
  why not ? 
  because both the usa and russia want the same : power . 
  to us europeans both should be considered hostile and somehow avoid conflict with either of them . 
  not really possible but one can dream , right ? 
  they do n't have feminism . 
  how about their apocalypse ? 
  it 'd be fitting ... 
  willingness ? 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  just because i know something exists i wo n't automatically believe ( in ) it . 
  get your head out of your ass , pls . 
   but i 'm going to make look stupid . 
  you just did to yourself . 
  if you 're in [ germany ] ( http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_13827.asp ) , [ france ] ( https://www.ibdna.com/paternity-testing-ban-upheld-in-france/ ) or [ israel ] ( http://www.family-laws.co.il/paternity-genetic-testing ) , the results of a paternity test will be ignored and you 'll be fined/imprisoned . 
  fun , eh ? 
  they also forget that it can be reversed and you can still freeze sperm if the reversion fails . 
  too bad it 's illegal here so i have to get abroad first . 
  that does n't justify shit . 
  i 'm still waiting for a personal emp shield that turns on automatically upon detecting a target . 
  nasa is cgi fraud . 
  it does n't matter because it 's been done by ~ ~ cia ~ ~ google . 
  either use a compatible mod or nothing . 
  this . 
  but do n't forget that mint is also an ubuntu under the hood . 
  all i 'm looking for is a distro based on debian that 's not thousands of years old ( like deb itself ) and has no ties to canonical . 
  got any ideas ? 
  i refuse to use anything rpm based because all they do is infuriate me with constant errors . 
  no exceptions so far . 
  and people wonder why no insider supports a mgtow `` documentary '' ... fuck bbc . 
  to * them * every unflattering information is . 
  any ideas about an alternative browser for windows that is n't spying on me ( ie/edge/chrome / opera/safari is nope ) and is n't appeasing sjws ( firefox ) ? 
  it 's still developed by google and they have been caught [ fooling around ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/google-eavesdropping-tool-installed-computers-without-permission ) . 
  just look at the `` dark side of the moon '' `` photos '' ... 
  i can do the same in 3ds max in 10 minutes ( too bad i have no license now ) . 
  sadly it 's [ also ] ( http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/watch-out-chrome-theres-two-new-browsers-in-town/ ) a chromium fork . 
  maybe i 'll ask on another sub or site , but thanks for the suggestions . 
  might be downvoted to oblivion but i do n't care :, 
  crazies are more frequent among feminists and occasionally will frame you with false rape accusations . 
  getting married might be the biggest mistake in your life . 
  no love is forever and a divorce is a pretty costly business . 
  do n't get married . 
  we `` only '' had close to 160k until now . 
  you can track it `` real time '' on www.alfahir.hu in the box titled `` illeg\u00e1lis bev\u00e1ndorl\u00f3k sz\u00e1ma janu\u00e1r elseje \u00f3ta '' . 
  another fun fact : that site is banned from r/hungary because the mods are liberal shitheads . 
  in your place i 'd have just left because even listening to feminists is tiresome and a waste of time . 
  just nod in ( fake ) agreement and go on your way . 
  i once reported an anti white male photo for hate crime , and what did they do ? 
  not a thing . 
  the poster was a jewish woman btw . 
  it 's funny , because my father 's late friend used to bring a straight razor with him when they hit the clubs ( a few decades ago ) . 
  no one dared to attack them , even as they were surrounded .
