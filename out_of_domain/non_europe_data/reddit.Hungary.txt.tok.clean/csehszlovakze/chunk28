  try getting a pet . 
  [ all feminism that matters is radical . 
  ] ( https://archive.is/ittuh ), 
  there was a post where an admin said it 's pure bs . 
  without writing a whole book : because that 's what resonates with me the most . 
  they think so because they do it all the time . 
  they think others do it as well cause projection . 
  do n't be so soft . 
   from immortal, 
  not anymore !, 
  fuck your blessed trinity !,

  if there 're any chicks close to a mosh pit you 'll instantly see white knights jump on her defense , even if she wants to jump right in . 
  also , if you dare to even accidentally toss her a bit he 'll want to rip your head off . 
  chicks should just stick to european power metal , and leave the heavy stuff for us guys . 
  i think you do n't get what mgtow is . 
  we are n't fighting anyone , we packed our shit and left . 
  i have one for communication and shitposting but not much else . 
  and as putin called out obama on isis the day was his . 
   because when he dies he will leave them a nice estate, 
  that can not be stressed enough . 
  awalt . 
  right now i do n't know the answer to your question , but i 'll have shitloads of time to think about it . 
  i have a dog and a cat back at my parens ' house . 
  they can make me forget most of my problems for a while , too bad i can only see them rarely . 
  moving any of them here is not an option either . 
  from a mgtow perspective i 'd :, 
  - silently outlaw all forms of feminism and expose the movement as a whole, 
  - restore all-boy and all-girl schools and remove coed schools, 
  - teach the boys some red pill knowledge , physical exercise and other stuff actually useful, 
  - actually equal rights to everyone , so let 's outlaw affirmative action and `` positive '' discrimination, 
  - give men reproductive rights, 
  - outlaw no-fault divorce and only allow it for stuff like cheating, 
  - no asset splitting ( mandatory prenups ), 
  that 's for starters . 
  committing to a woman is an automatic disqualification imho , but so is being `` blue-pill '' . 
  come to r slash european for a reddit-based source with free speech . 
  just think of the mental gymnastics that article required . 
  it was feminists who drove men out of higher education cause patriarchy \u2122 , and now they blame us because there are n't enough of us there . 
   that damn username again, 
  lol . 
  it 's even harder as you probably do n't speak hungarian . 
  do n't hold your breath , it 'll never happen . 
  i have a better explanation : https://www.rt.com/news/316186-germany-us-nukes-upgrade/, 
  got a non-paywalled version ? 
  i can present some [ proof ] ( https://archive.is/oabd6 ) , unlike them . 
  then you have a much more important task than slaying pussy , no ? 
  then get your financials together so you can have them ? 
  lots of people say that you have to be motivated/disciplined for the right reasons otherwise you might revert , but who said you ca n't change your reasons ? 
  there are a few subs dedicated to this ... and if it was easy everyone would be a billionaire . 
  start with the easiest problem . 
  i 'm not surprised , but the admins wo n't give a shit unless a scandal may hit them financially . 
  seeing logic in feminism is impossible . 
  it tries to justify its existence by sounding moral on the surface , but it 's nothing more than `` beta women '' hating on men . 
  these women are exploited by the elite for numerous reasons , but the main motivators are money and power . 
  feminists will never realize they are nothing more than worthless pawns on a huge chessboard . 
  mgtow is actually a blend between the first two . 
  it is basically `` knowing the enemy '' ( being redpilled about female nature and white knights ) and not committing to them ( via cohabitation , marriage , children etc ) . 
  from that point you can go either for ltr/ons game , pay hookers or avoid it all together . 
  self-improvement is also considered important there , be it physical or financial aspect or `` just '' becoming good at a hobby , let it be video games , playing an instrument or even hunting . 
  the mgtow sub has lots of venting just like here . 
  methinks she 's trying to fish for bb . 
  her best option post-wall is a white knight bb that would do anything for her , including marriage , paying for her ( and her kids ' ) shit and losing everything in a divorce after she gets bored of him . 
  a few people are shadowbanned around here ... 
  maybe you 're just plain ugly . 
  it should just die already . 
  time to start building the fence on the romanian and ukrainian borders ... 
  switch to ublock origin asap , as it 's not corrupt like this or abp, 
  i used this hand to masturbate !, 
  sjws fucking with my metal ? 
  over my dead body maybe !, 
  feminists hate children because they receive more attention and love than them . 
  feminism and logic do n't mix, 
  do you know now who leads the * human rights council * ? 
  ** saudi arabia . 
  yeah , you read that right . 
  russia i 'm afraid : /, 
  our prime minister , orb\u00e1n has always said this :, 
  pay attention to what i do , not what i say . 
  that actually shows him in a worse light than his supporters around europe would suggest , but it 's still the truest sentence any politician has ever uttered . 
  so , to answer your question : putin might have done some shitty things but his good deeds still vastly overcompensate . 
  i still would n't choose either . 
  both the usa and russia are big bullies who play chess with the world and i wish they 'd just stop . 
  but i have a feel that they wo n't and ww3 is coming fast if it 's not here already . 
  you should try on / pol / or maybe on / b / instead . 
  it 's funny because the kurds fight against isis and turkey , and by fighting the latter they fight nato . 
  i 'm sure the kurds wo n't attack russia , they 'll use these weapons against turkey . 
  as of al nusra front or the fake fsa ? 
  i 'm sure they wo n't be much of a problem for putin . 
  there 's no way the usa can win this without losing face even more . 
  lol 'd at romania, 
   he is propping up a dictator and an ally for his weapons industry, 
  that 's obama , not putin . 
  see saudi arabia and isis . 
  putin is supporting the ** legitimate ** government of syria . 
   good deeds, 
  eaeu ? 
  standing up to the usa ? 
  the same way r/offmychest banned anyone having karma in a non-approved sub , this sub should ban anyone from a sjw sub . 
  the hell are you even doing here if you lack the discipline to read the sidebar of the main sub ?
