  and while neomasculinity started out as traditionalism + red pill knowledge , it has become bluer and bluer since its birth . 
  kek, 
  ahmed pls, 
  he might suffer from depression . 
  must be canadian, 
  beta and bp ( bluepill ) are not the same thing . 
  why the fuck do you even go near subs like that ? 
  it 's not really good to one 's mental health ... 
   what happened to sjw 's giving convicted people a second chance, 
  that only happens if you are n't a straight white male ... 
  sweden yes !, 
  there 's a small problem with all this : it 's simply not true . 
  oil prices have indeed fallen , but so has ruble compared to usd , and oil prices are in usd , so the relative price stayed close to what it was . 
  also , most of their debt is domestic and it has lost value too . 
  i know how much atlantists and their shills want russia to fall ( and steal their resources ) but it wo n't happen anytime soon . 
  social justice is an expansion of feminism : it also includes race , sexual orientation ( lgbt ) , cultural bs . 
  while theoretically possible , i do n't think there are many sjws that are n't also feminists . 
  sounds like the same thing to me . 
  i might be wrong but then show me the difference . 
  this is why i always laugh people in the face who say that eastern european * women are different ... 
  \\* to me central europe is a bs term and west/east can be easily determined by cold war factions , so yeah , we are in eastern europe, 
   your uterus is about as suitable for human life as chernobyl 's reactor room, 
  lolololol stealing this, 
  r/asktrp to be precise, 
  awalt . 
  not even then . 
  mgtow still does n't equal celibacy ... 
  if you ask sjws : everyone is a `` far right nazi '' who is n't them, 
  [ not ] ( http://img.memecdn.com/hungary-best-turkey_o_6045909.jpg ) .

  did n't know this sub turned so blue pill that it 's hip to shame others like a feminist ... 
  no , you 're only her investment for her old age, 
  not in a `` muh legacy '' sense , mothers expect their sons to drop everything and care for them when they get old . 
  the only thing not typical about her is her weight ... 
  [ venom - lap of the gods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esbpvcpn8io ), 
   use these next few years to get yourself a guy you can have kids with and spend your life with . 
  i wo n't tell girls anything like this because they 'll think it 's an offer . 
  he even managed to have [ russia today ] ( http://archive.is/o457x ) show its true colors, 
  no mvpness will save his ass if the potential damage is great enough ... 
  more like very dumb . 
  she now has the power to destroy his life . 
  if you really had the idea you would n't have done what you did, 
  i know a few lesbos and even the dykes are like that . 
  nah , they will just outlaw all male sexual aids , maybe even masturbation . 
  she 's so blind ... women support sanders because he 's a communist white knight . 
  you might or might not like sandman but he 's right on this one . 
  \\  wikipedia, 
  thank you captain obvious, 
   why lie that feminism is for both women and men ? 
  to shut up any dissent, 
  the sabotage of the `` cultural marxism '' article was way enough to me , and of course there is gamergate , too . 
   what do women want ? 
  more . 
  [ fr\u00fchling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvfqqjenf08 ) by nargaroth :d, 
   star trek, 
  are you talking about the latest movies made by jar jar abrams ? 
  the moment you step outside lol, 
  you do n't if you do n't care as much, 
  why do i get the feeling that she 's post wall and not married ? 
   you 're a ugly hunchbacked weirdo/creep/pervert / subhuman filth for buying one of these, 
  `` then you should be happy i 'm not in the dating pool anymore '', 
  i want to but it 's illegal here unless you 're over 40 and had 3 kids ... 
  i 'll save some money to do it abroad . 
   romance, 
  that means `` ravaged by an alpha male '' in womanese, 
  hungary . 
  and no , the women are n't unicorns either , just more covert in their ways than westwards, 
  at least they leave us alone, 
  now i know why messenger rising is in the sidebar ... 
  i just took vain bitches off my stream . 
  when i go online it 's mostly page posts . 
  even female rapists have incognito because vagina ... it was in one of turd flinging monkey 's videos, 
  as far as i can tell from europe it 's already happening in the usa . 
  consent forms will be thrown out in court , and the next step will be making recorded evidence illegal ... 
   my body my choice, 
  that 's only for women i 'm afraid ... 
  vasectomy still legal in slovakia ... yet ... 
  it 's the depression phase of unplugging , it 'll pass . 
  living in a country that is n't a feminazi stronghold helps a lot , too, 
  to me * taking the red pill * helped far more than any psychologist . 
  that sub still cracks me up every time . 
  tl ; dr is a good thing to decide if you want to read something at all . 
  some people write awful intros which would kill my interest , but after that it can become interesting . 
  ok , that horse kissing the preggo 's stomach killed me . 
  god damn it . 
  it 's the same everywhere . 
  you did the right thing . 
  the wall is n't about having sex , it 's about getting commitment from a non-beta, 
  lol, 
  lol you just triggered bar bar, 
  apart from that , i agree with you . 
  clueless people are far easier to control , and fathers are in the way . 
  as of the migrant crisis , imho it 's partially to defeat the ` marriage strike ' ( you go your own way in protest ? 
  we just brought in a million horny men in your place ), 
  how do you know he does n't know about mgtow ? 
  maybe he feels the same about you . 
  some of her clients might be young guys going for a `` mommy experience '', 
  just like roosh v and his `` pro-rape '' clickbait ... 
  yeah , but they do n't know that ... they hit the wall ( in a mental sense ) when they realize this,
