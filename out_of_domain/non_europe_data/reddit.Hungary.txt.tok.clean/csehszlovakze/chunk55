   then you are an idiot . 
  more and more shaming without any proof . 
  \\* yaaaaawn \\*, 
  so fucking what ? 
  if they want `` evidence '' to show that we 're losers they 'll just make some . 
  that 's child support , not alimony, 
  wtf is that ? 
  what i want to say is basically covered by u/dirtydog413 and u/asexualmamba . 
  you 're not a leader and mgtow is not an elite club for successful guys who swore off women . 
  no , mgtow is a bunch of guys who decided that they do n't want legal entanglements with women , be it marriage , children , mortgage , whatever . 
  thx, 
  lol he 's flip-flopping again, 
  \\  preventing brigading, 
  kek, 
  it 's literally worthless unless the target sub implements the css hack , but even then it 's worthless because that 's an unofficial hack . 
  if you wan na go semi-certain you can start demanding archive.is links or screenshots and then the problem is solved . 
  it 's the same in hungarian : `` kapuz\u00e1r\u00e1si p\u00e1nik '', 
  too bad here it 's mostly used to shame men before their 50th birthday ... 
  are you strawmanning me on purpose or maybe you just ca n't read ? 
  please re-read what i wrote !, 
   legal entanglements ** with women ** , ... 
  since when does that mean that you ca n't get a car or a house w / mortgage * on your own * ? 
   you buddy might have lost , but he was living his dream . 
  and when you both are old and dry , at least he can say that he went for it . 
  he gave it his all . 
  this . 
  op 's friend is more mgtow than op himself . 
  indeed . 
  compared to what i heard about the usa , our public transport system in the capital is excellent , so you do n't need a car to commute to work or shopping ( if you can hold all things at once anyway ) . 
   i have nothing to gain from this, 
  of course you do : social status . 
  you want mgtow to become the new elite of men . 
  let me tell you something : it wo n't work . 
  anyone that ever tried to mold mgtow to his own desires has been ostracised from the community . 
  you should lurk a bit more and start watching videos because these questions have already been answered by many ... 
   not fucking mortgages . 
  how the fuck are you going your own way if you have a mortgage with a fucking woman ? 
  and it seems you still ca n't read , maybe you should stop embarrassing yourself . 
   losers , that have never earned or worked for anything in their life , calling themselves mgtow, 
  and why does that hurt your little ego ? 
  it 's almost like you want to force them into marriage as a penalty because they are n't `` successful '' by your shitty standards that actually come from women ... tradcuck detected ? 
   this group provides a safe place for ** babies ** or psychos, 
  tradcuck confirmed . 
  your kind belongs to avfm , not this community . 
   being a responsible human being is not gynocentric . 
  but his standards on what that means ** is ** . 
  and yet you sound far more bitter than the guy you bitch about . 
  sure , he had a depressed moment . 
  and yet , he lived a fuller life than you ever will . 
  how about you stop being jealous and start doing what you actually want to do instead of going back to the plantation ? 
  you know , like an actual mgtow . 
   my standard is self sufficiency . 
  your standard is pretty much what women want . 
  you can be self-sufficient without any of those things you mentioned in this post . 
  i 'm sure if you repost this at trp you 'll get a gazillion upvotes and the fake online respect you seek so hard . 
  but not here . 
  you still have n't answered a question , tho : if you 're so awesome and have it all together then why bitch about it on the internet so much ? 
   he 's lucky i love him, 
  damn it , you sound like a narcissistic woman . 
  you should 've hissed at her like a cat , she 'd 've understood that :p, 
  link pls, 
  maybe a little , 
  sexual strategy itself is amoral , its application is n't ( necessarily ) . 
  here legal escorts have regular checkups ( you can demand papers ) so yeah . 
   what guy fucks them ? 
  a desperate one, 
  it 's none of her business unless she 's ready to suck dick, 
  same here . 
  i do n't know of a single web 2.0 site that does n't have this problem . 
  also , trp has lots of shitty content as well , far more than a year ago . 
   tfw feminists want to force women into jobs almost no woman wants, 
  how democratic of them, 
  i do n't watch most videos because i usually do n't give a shit , but if you mean videos with anecdotal evidence : i think those are important , because that 's what a lot of guys can relate to , not academic level stuff . 
   the title says all i need to know, 
  you must be new here because that 's the exception , not the rule, 
   almost every attempt to organize some sort of a meeting here failed, 
  do you want to get lynched irl ? 
  because that 's how you get lynched irl . 
  keep mgtow online , bro , for your own sake . 
  afaik he has hungarian origins and we 're white as fuck ( if you do n't count gypsies ) . 
  also , he has been doxxed before and doing a quick google search will show you his pale bald head . 
  the question is : are herbivores considered mgtow ? 
  because if so then mgtow is mostly yellow , not white ... 
  low quality bait, 
  a boy died after the 42th time in a row ... 
  you can get some inspiration at r/nonothingnovember as well, 
   what do women want from male spaces ? 
  they want to control us because they believe we talk about them constantly ( sheer projection ), 
  let 's start calling sex bot opposers botphobic bigots , 
  your daughter sounds crazy enough to use the pedophile card against you regarding her kid at any time ... 
  there 's nothing you can do to help her , really . 
  cut your losses and move on . 
  blue pillers frequently link to us , maybe srs has done it a few times as well . 
  \\  implying r/mgtow is the only male space left, 
  aspergers and bpd have very similar symptoms but there ** are ** differences . 
  [ this ] ( http://aspertypical.com/2013/06/12/the-borderline-of-aspergers-the-similarities-between-borderline-personality-disorder-and-autism/ ) long blog post can help with differentiating the two , however , the two might even coexist theoretically . 
  you 're welcome ( partially because i was the one bitching about flairs ), 
  \\  married, 
  pick one, 
  lol the first sentence is already incorrect ... did n't even read further .
