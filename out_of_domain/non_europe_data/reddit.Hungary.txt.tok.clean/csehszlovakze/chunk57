  and being the little princess she is this drives her insane . 
   having douzens of terminals open, 
  i use only one with dozens of tabs open , 
  i do n't so i ca n't really help , but afaik it 's almost impossible for a single male to adopt a kid because * muh pedophiles * . 
  thanks for the rundown , much appreciated . 
  i also have a question : how do islamic teachings relate to mgtow itself ? 
  because afaicr christianity encourages it if you can and are willing to stay celibate . 
  ( not peer/family pressure , because that exists in every society . ), 
   i wonder , how are false harassment/rape accusations dealt with in the middle east ? 
  afaik most rapes are n't even recognized there as such because it needs 4 male witnesses or something like that . 
  and of course the woman can be punished for adultery in those situations . 
  i 'm more concerned about sharia law tbh . 
  seems like sharia law takes false rape allegations very seriously ... 
  sharia has far more restrictions on women than on men as far as i can tell ... 
  i 'm not saying it 's good or fair but maybe the creators of it knew some bits about female nature and tried to counter it, 
  yeah , except tbp has been linking to * us * as well for some time ... 
  my tinfoil hat is tingling a bit ... why do i get the feeling that rps has `` nuked '' posting because he knew trp would be chosen and wanted to show the better face of the sub ? 
  r/debatede comes to mind, 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  please do n't strawman me . 
  of course there are times when his occupation is trivial to women . 
  at others , it 's not . 
  no one forces him to tell about his occupation in a pub for example . 
  do n't worry , i 'm not a fan either , i just want to see the whole picture , especially if eurabia happens in a few years . 
  the jealousy is strong in that thread ... 
   live your own life not one that others tell you that you should live based on a standard think everyone should go by . 
  this right here . 
  women are like children : they want what they ca n't have . 
  nothing really, 
  op is a feminazi faggot, 
  np links are worthless and it 's up to the mods to disallow reddit links ( the same way they disallowed youtube links ), 
  i agree . 
  imho the autobot should disallow any kind of reddit links and only accept archive.is instead, 
  sure , but surrogacy is not only illegal in most places but costs way too much . 
  i also read it somewhere that at some places the surrogate mother can keep the kid if she wants to and sue for child support . 
  indeed , so dark it 's actually black , 
  i 've spent quite enough time on mra sites to see that this is exactly how they think . 
  found the bluepiller cuck, 
   when you visit the np link , you ca n't up or downvote . 
  that only works if the target sub implements the necessary css hack and most subs do n't so it 's worthless, 
  y so mad, 
  what u/itsigno said . 
  also , what do you think where do all files ( including * . css ) come from ? 
  and his butthurt post makes his username pretty ironic , does n't it ? 
  have n't seen any eps but i 'm hardly surprised, 
  tfm made an awesome [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvodwzbf3o8 ) about how migrant women use the refugee crisis to get rid of their husbands in europe, 
  pls go fuck yourself cause not everyone understands the * arbitrary retarded rollercoaster * ... 
  depends on how you define overpopulation . 
  imho if the unemployment rate is high ( with no prospects ) then that place is overpopulated, 
  you know you can ask them not to talk about this because you do n't want to hear that all the time , right ? 
  \\  using cancerbook for anything else than talking to friends/family, 
  of course there will be , this guy sounds like a total cuck, 
  she has probably bullied him for so long he does n't want to do anything with her , he 's just trapped, 
  it 's how feminists react when their `` great '' ideas turn out to be worthless, 
  if your neighborhood is safe enough you can always get a cat and let it wander around during the day, 
  also congrats to the 150k subs in advance, 
  i was n't talking about this case in particular , only past ones . 
  maybe start by looking at yourself then, 
  then why are you constantly in tbp ? 
  too bad i have n't archived your profile because you cleverly deleted all your posts from there ... 
  \\  muh imaginary internet pointz, 
  pls, 
  if a cat is properly fed it wo n't hunt that much , only occasionally , and even then they prefer mice/rats . 
  and if it comes to birds , pigeons here are overpopulated and sometimes are even culled by men, 
  maybe . 
  but you 're lucky you are n't here because who - / whatever hurts my pets will have to deal with me ... 
  i disagree because originally both cats and dogs are outdoor types , so locking them inside a house is far worse , maybe outright cruelty ( for some pets anyway ) . 
  my cat even prefers to sleep outside if the weather is good enough . 
   i see in the forums and vlogs ** of the internet ** are very much a different monster . 
  there you have your answer why , op . 
  not here ... ;-), 
  y u no post this as a link post ? 
   four children and she 's acting like she can pick and choose, 
  that 's because she can . 
  sure , not anyone she wants but cucks will still line up and throw each other under the bus for a fake smile . 
  for not bowing to pua ? 
  pls, 
  lesbians love that brand as well kek, 
  i personally use str8 cause that smells the best for that price, 
  they already have ... 
  i only care to respond to part of # 2, 
   why does this have a scientific sounding name like it is n't hogwash ? 
  because it ** is ** scientific , but you 'd know that if you googled what briffault 's law is . 
   so men do n't have the power to determine the conditions of a relationship ? 
  no , because then the female will scream rape and even if the law does n't finish the revenge , the white knights will . 
   but these ideas need to be ridiculed, 
  and you wonder why people hate you this much ... 
  pretty sure it 's manboobz himself lol, 
  it 's a pua term , that 's what . 
  nagging ? 
  just do n't get married . 
  [ sure bro ] ( http://www.pick-up-artist-forum.com/most-common-shit-tests-and-the-proper-answers-vt2819.html ) ( post is way older than trp ), 
  mobile and console is slowly but steadily taking market from pcs , and pc gaming nowadays is mostly through steam . 
  so when valve moves to linux , windows gaming will die a slow and painful death . 
  yeah you 're right, 
  if you care about female validation this much wtf are you doing here ? 
  if you really wan na do this , try posing as a woman on the internet and start pitting them against each other . 
  then post results so we can laugh our asses off , 
  \\  wants proper scientific answers w/o putting in the effort herself, 
  come on guuuuurl !,
