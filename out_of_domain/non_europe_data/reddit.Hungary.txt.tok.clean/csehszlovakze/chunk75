  the alpha widow, 
   i 'm going to get straight to the point here . 
  and yet you managed to write a novel ... 
   i am a woman, 
   i want to know what not to do as a girlfriend in an ltr, 
  r/redpillwomen and r/redpillwives, 
   i know you 'll just dismiss me as a nawalt, 
  no , we 'll dismiss you as awalt . 
  also , your claim to be * so different * is already a red flag , probably a female chameleon, 
   who threatens your narrative, 
  not our narrative , our way of life , or even our life itself . 
  exposing us could very well mean us getting beaten to death by white knights , the government making marriage mandatory etc. 
   how do i become a decent human being * in the eyes of mgtow *, 
  see [ my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mgtow/comments/57qj04/an_open_letter_to_women_who_hate_mgtow_heres_how/d8u4dnc ), 
   i do n't know what you want from me . 
  you specifically ? 
  to leave us alone and not to meddle in our lives . 
  \\  have women stare at you, 
  that 's not how it works . 
  [ cultural marxism at work ] ( https://i.sli.mg/02rux5.jpg ), 
  that 's newer info than i remembered ... good thing the alt right kicked him to the curb, 
  i know right ? 
  someone is already trying to shame me for not being a white knight , and this female is getting way too many upvotes ... probably brigading . 
  nobody cares about your precious feelings , especially after your shaming and tone policing attempt, 
  found the low-effort troll, 
  asexual women are n't asexual for the right guys ... 
  there 's an exception to every rule . 
  was she lesbian or completely asexual ? 
  kids under 13 should n't even come near this site , let alone make an account and post here ... it violates the tos, 
  then maybe you could have been the right guy , so to speak, 
  if he provided his real name then it should n't be too hard to doxx the bitch but i 'm not going to do that cause that shit is illegal here and i wo n't go to prison because of some roastie if i can help it, 
  wtf is this cancer, 
  nice to meet you , lol braindead faggot , i 'm csehszlovakze . 
  is that the same aaron clarey who doxxed barbar and stardusk ? 
  if so then he can go fuck himself, 
  [ barbar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob5jvbowqt4 ) 's and [ stardusk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugxmjxrbe6k ) 's video about them getting doxxed, 
   well , if i am ignoring them , then how can i notice them ? 
  peripheral vision , reflections etc. 
   i wonder if it 's the side effect of them inviting all those migrants here . 
  no migrants here and it still happens, 
  i 'm already at the point that if a woman behaves like a unicorn it 's a red flag . 
  i know that by going full chameleon she 's either on a slave hunt or is a borderline . 
   insensitive female, 
  who is surprised ? 
  no one ? 
  good !, 
  awalt, 
   apologies . 
  that was my lame attempt at humor . 
  i know , but i had to be a smartass for those who do n't . 
   i suppose they just want male attention . 
  if they are not getting any , they wonder what 's going on . 
  zyzz, 
  found the twerp migrant kek, 
  it 'd be tim kaine running the show then ... 
  lem me help you :, 
  q : do you have a girlfriend ? 
  a : yeah , but nothing serious . 
  and, 
  q : when are you getting married ? 
  a : when i find the right one . 
  two very effective lies that 'll fool anyone . 
   why women are only in love with the idea of being in love, 
  because men in love are much easier to manipulate than those who are n't, 
   you probably should risk getting burned a little, 
  too bad you ca n't get burned just a little in contemporary society , not in the first world , anyway . 
  it 's more like russian roulette with n bullets instead of one , where n highly depends on your skill to navigate in the sea of crazy to find a non-crazy that wo n't fuck you over even without commitment . 
  i think our `` job '' as mgtow is to warn guys of the possible risks and then let them do the decision . 
  women are inferior because , evolutionally speaking , they never had to be superior but we men had to . 
   even when i tried to get dumped, 
  what was your strategy ? 
  because going full beta and needy always works, 
  we did n't compete with women , we competed with hostile tribes . 
  also , you wo n't undo millions of years of evolution in one decade ... do n't forget that some form of mgtow has existed in all of our history . 
  the smaller the company the less likely that women will be in it because startups demand actual work unlike a software giant . 
  you just ca n't win with these idiots ... you 're either replying too early ( neediness ) or too late ( mooning ) ... 
  and then the roman empire was killed by feminism . 
  that explains why most websites and apps look like cancer, 
  is that david futrelle ? 
  kek, 
  spam but it 's already deleted, 
  i do n't like most people regardless of their sex, 
  the label does n't matter , though . 
  enjoy life , brother !, 
  depends on where op lives , because if he 's in france , germany or israel then he 's fucked . 
  the thirsty one, 
  pinging u/yetanotheraccountolo cause reasons, 
  you actually do n't disagree with op , what you two said go together pretty well, 
   what our fathers failed to realize is that type of woman does n't exist today . 
  feminism killed her . 
  this type of woman has never existed , they 've just dropped their masks because they do n't have to pretend anymore, 
  we have this , too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constructive_vote_of_no_confidence, 
   probably get your heads chopped off . 
  lolnope ... syria and other muslim countries also have male surplus on the sexual marketplace , and if you add polygamy to the mix , you 'll be left with lots of men who do n't have access to women at all . 
  most of these `` rapefugees '' have been kissless virgins before arriving to the eu . 
  do n't the electors choose whoever the fuck they want ? 
  because then voting does n't matter at all . 
   this is quality commentary on the degrading intellectual performance of what happens here . 
  then it ** is ** tone policing . 
  no tone policing pls,
