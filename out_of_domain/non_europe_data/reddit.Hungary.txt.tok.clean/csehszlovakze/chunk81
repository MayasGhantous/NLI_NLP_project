  that has already been disproven in said threads, 
  my theory : he was `` elected '' to be president so the tptb can kill assange in relative silence, 
  what if the dms was triggered when dyn was ddos 'd so hard that half of the internet was inaccessible ? 
  too bad for rule 6 , so i 'll only say that [ your post history betrays you ] ( http://archive.is/fws0e ) ... 
  [ here you are ] ( http://archive.is/ceehq ), 
   by being a rational commentor, 
  and now it 's my time to say lol, 
  zero facts , endless mockery , too high karma for someone who 's constantly downvoted , do n't you think ? 
  the last time it happened they responded immediately and updated the canary the next day, 
  / thread, 
   if i was constantly downvoted i would n't have too high karma . 
  unless you cheat of course , 
   its hard not to mock some of the crazies around here . 
  you did it again , proving me right , 
   as for 0 facts i think you need to read again , 
  it 's you who needs to start using actual arguments instead of concern trolling ... 
   wikileaks twitter tweets out to stop ddos ` ing ( to its supporters ), 
  methinks it was n't wl writing the tweet but the agency that seized control over it, 
  and of course you still have n't provided any counter-arguments ... 
  but i 'm done feeding you , little troll , consider yourself muted , 
  did he say he knows better because `` you 're just a woman '' ? 
  they keep talking but wo n't update the warrant canary , which can mean only one thing ... 
  have you seen their latest tweet demanding people to stop asking for proof of life ? 
  but they can link to a different blockchain ... 
  do n't be so hard on the nsa , maybe they put some malicious code in it , 
  you 're assuming everyone checking pgp will download all public keys and not just download it every time they need to . 
  i think it 's not wikileaks and it 's a honeypot to catch more key people . 
  c is canary not chicken, 
  do you think they care which puppet `` leads '' the state ? 
  is it possible that the dead mans key has already been released ? 
  according to the most popular theory it has been released back on oct. 21 , and that 's why dyn was ddos 'd the same day . 
  if that 's the case and there 're no other trigger dates then we lost the dms forever . 
  kek, 
  i do n't think non-american people/organizations can be gagged by the nsa . 
  well , not in a legal sense , anyway . 
  have you checked any browser plugins ? 
  imho they did n't use the ddos to * prevent * the dms from triggering , they used it to make it unaccessible to anyone while they got in and removed the files . 
  and while there certainly are more dmses i think they 've already got shut down during the same ddos . 
  how ? 
  the agencies have vast resources at their disposal , whether it 's torture , agents inside or just hacking wl 's systems . 
  i know what a gag order is , but the nsa ca n't legally silence me because i 'm not american so those laws do n't apply to me and i do n't think anything like this exists here . 
  come on !, 
  that rule is telling them it 's okay to concern troll the shit out of this sub . 
  the nsa probably, 
   ok , i can ** n ** barely type this but my hand i ** s ** stuck insdie the vendign machine ** a ** and if i let go i lose the snickers , tell me what to do boss . 
  is this one of those `` unindexed '' emails ? 
  no one is putting a gun against your head to read it, 
   is his internet back on ? 
  in the age of smartphones this excuse is ** complete bs ** . 
  all you need to do is to enable usb tethering and to connect the pc and the phone with the cable . 
  lol 'd at that shirt, 
  how about professional voice actors ? 
   we did n't discredit wikileaks . 
  they did that themselves . 
  / thread, 
  the sanctions are n't against russia , they 're against the eu , because we 're economic rivals for the usa . 
  does the usa itself sanction russia ? 
  nope !, 
   the movie they did about wiki leaks with benedict cumbersquash, 
  have n't seen it yet , got an imdb link ? 
  and what is the funniest ? 
  both hrc and trump are just mere puppets . 
   being flooded with pizzagate posts, 
  prove it, 
  screenshot or it did n't happen, 
  thanks !, 
  this . 
  also , did anyone notice that op 's account is brand new ? 
   thats clearly distinguishable from real voice, 
  to you maybe, 
  not everyone lives on the internet you know, 
  who is she ? 
  thank you based bot, 
  top kek, 
  why would he do anything for assange ? 
  especially after backtracking on almost every issue he promised in his campaign ... 
  i 've already put some of them on res ignore list , 
  exactly what i was implying, 
  you should post this as a new post with links proving these points , that would shut up the shills for a while . 
  in other words : business as usual, 
  snow panda is a female , not a white knight, 
  i 'm not in the anglosphere and i check multiple news sources ... so how about the muslim database ? 
  how about putting hrc in prison ? 
  cancelling obamacare completely ? 
  how about all male celebrities that get divorce raped ? 
  you ca n't out-alpha the system . 
  okcupid has already proven this to be true ... see link above/below . 
   marry an educated woman who has a career , do n't ask her to give it up, 
  [ bullshit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evgr8jpjcmg ), 
   and get a prenup, 
  [ also bullshit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q504lcdspk0 ), 
  i do n't , it 's just how hypergamy ( female instinct ) works . 
  it 's not a redpiller thing , it 's more a white nationalist thing . 
  and meanwhile immigrant and minority violence is always higher than the main population ( and supported by statistics made by the police ) there still have been dozens of false `` migrant rape '' accusations for the very same reason false rape accusations happen generally, 
  you spelled `` lawyer industry '' wrong . 
  seems like * someone * ca n't handle not being worshipped 24/7 , 
  all it takes is a car accident ... 
  no offense , but formatting abuse should be disallowed as well , it makes posts pretty hard to read . 
  i 'm here to find out what happened to him . 
  when i do i 'll decide if i stay or not , whether he 's alive or dead ( methinks the latter is true ) .
