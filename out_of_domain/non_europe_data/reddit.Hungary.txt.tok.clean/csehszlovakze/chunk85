  kek, 
  lol, 
  it 's not your fault when you 're brainwashed since birth, 
  i 'm someone who thinks that all politicians are the same but you 're so fucking annoying i 've just put you on my res ignore list . 
  there are mgtow subs that do n't allow posts about women . 
  why do n't you go there instead of concern trolling and tone policing this sub ? 
  aj is controlled opposition , never heard of this faggot tho, 
  both the alt-right lgbt folk and the libtard lgbt folk are delusional morons , because they support extremes ( far-right and muslims ) who would slaughter them in a heartbeat given the chance, 
  kek, 
  sure :, 
  - r/mgtowbnattaw ( private ), 
  also check out r/mgtowmusic for related content, 
  start reading / pol / and you 'll see what op means, 
  \\  should of, 
   and is n't realistic at all, 
  no , you 're just inexperienced af, 
  \\* [ cultural marxists ] ( https://sli.mg/02rux5 ), 
  ** we 'd get nuked by the gynocracy .

  well , then you had different experiences than him or the rest of us, 
  this wo n't compile under java ( and the app is written in it ), 
  you da real mvp, 
  in a he-said-she-said situation the female wins usually and you might go to prison in the worst-case scenario . 
  you ignored two rules that are in place for a good reason :, 
  1 . do n't shit where you eat, 
  2 . do n't stick your dick in crazy, 
  journalists are cancer, 
  i do n't really like him to be honest . 
  the first thing i noticed is that he 's consumed by revenge fantasies . 
  the second is that he 's trying way too hard . 
  trp does n't know what trp is nowadays . 
  i started reading it 2 years ago , it was entirely different back then , basically a hybrid of mgtow and pua . 
  nowadays it 's full of con artists begging for money and tradcons , both shaming mgtow because we 're not willing to throw money at them . 
   red pill rule # 1 is `` do n't get married '', 
  it was two years ago ... 
  lol, 
  show me one country where you wo n't get fucked over if you get married, 
  * protip : you ca n't *, 
  quality hoes cost half as much here , 
  \\  work, 
  \\  get shitload of money, 
  \\  buy my own house in a quiet place, 
  \\  retire early, 
  meanwhile go for my hobbies instead of mandatory `` vacations '' with a spouse, 
   or should cut off the friendship . 
  yep . 
  your spidey senses are n't wrong , you just do n't know why they 're tingling ( yet , but you should n't stick around to find out ) . 
  ouch . 
  i feel for you bro . 
  it 's called cognitive dissonance, 
   why did she decide to contact me ? 
  because she hit the wall and/or has a bastard child, 
   i hope getting blocked was worth the wait, 
  she 'll just make another one ... set your privacy settings so only * friends * can see what you 're doing , and do n't add anyone you do n't know, 
  sure . 
  i 'm talking about our capital , the countryside ofc is cheaper . 
  and of course there 're the gypsy hoes who i would n't touch in a space suit lol . 
   and now she 's telling me she never forced me to take pharm prereqs and that i forced it on myself . 
  [ gaslighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaslighting ), 
   eastern europe, 
  yeah , no . 
  it 's next to me , and while these places seem traditional to a westerner , they 're not . 
  my country is also regarded as eastern by some people , but we have one of the highest divorce rates in the world ( 67 % ) . 
   she said that out of everyone she had dated , i was the only one that she could n't out-whit . 
  she admitted to admiring that, 
  i hope you told her `` nice try '', 
  kek, 
   seriously , why is n't paternity testing standard ? 
  in germany , israel or france it 's not even legal, 
  such conversion , wow, 
   anyway , she 's right up there with nikolai tesla . 
  kek, 
  i 'd need so much alcohol for this woman that it 'd be rape if the roles were reversed . 
  are you the roastie who made the video ? 
  lol !, 
  [ top kek ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/001/369/6a2.png ), 
  oh , so you 're just a troll . 
  this would have been a good idea before regret rape became a thing, 
  kek, 
  i know right ? 
  all political parties here are corrupt as fuck , and while they pretend to be fierce enemies , in reality they sell our shit to their friends and laugh at as in private . 
  wo n't link to a specific video because i 'm not following him all the time but [ vention1mgtow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/vention1mgtow ) is mostly posting about other aspects of mgtow , not female nature, 
  that sub is pro-marriage as far as i can remember, 
  you 're better off without her , believe me, 
  go to r/theredpill or r/mgtowbwbaw if you do n't like it here, 
  we did n't start the feud , the con artists at trp who ca n't get a penny from us did, 
  most of us are here because of this reason . 
  the difference is that some guys have made the mistake of marriage before finding mgtow , while we , the others are lucky to learn from their mistakes . 
  i blocked the doodles in ublock origin a year ago , i recommend the same to you . 
   a healthy , intimate connection, 
  that thing does n't exist , bro . 
  returnofkings has started it http://archive.is/utnzh, 
  i know , but that was n't the point of the author . 
  his point was the prominent anti-male attitude among mgtow-minded men . 
  no , it was an example ( among others ) for causes of male depression/suicide . 
  the mrm does n't like bachelors because it 's infected with women , while mgtow does n't like poor people because it 's infected with libertarianism . 
  i can understand where he 's coming from because i grew up in poverty , and while i managed to climb out many men wo n't be able to for many reasons ( not everyone can be a software developer or an entrepreneur for example ) . 
   mgtow is not a libertarian organization .
