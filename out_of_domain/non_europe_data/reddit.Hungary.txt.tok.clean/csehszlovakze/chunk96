  hoooly shit i earn less than half of that, 
  kek 'd, 
   we need help from all people , and woman make around 50 % of the population . 
  this tactic has been [ completely ineffective for a century ] ( https://i.imgur.com/h6w4vhe.jpg ) now , it obviously does n't work . 
  wymyn wo n't help men . 
  mgtow was n't `` designed '' to fight feminism but might have more success than the mrm . 
  the moment 15-20 % of men go mgtow wymyn will have no other choice because they wo n't get the desired commitment anymore . 
  i do know what i 'm talking about , you 're just not listening to me . 
  my last amd `` product '' was an athlon 64 x2 5600 + and after i got fed up with them i switched to intel ... first an i3 ( ca n't remember which ) and the current one is ( copied from lshw ) :,

   constantly mentioning * ryzen * and * threadripper * in every response, 
  if anyone needed any proof that you 're a shill , here it is . 
   no 64-bit architecture, 
  \\* cough \\* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/itanium \\* cough \\* sure , not for `` mortals '' , but it 's 64 bit ... and since then we have arm64 as well ... 
   people who need to worry about living do n't need to invent new problems . 
  if this is about feminism then you 're wrong . 
  they invent new `` problems '' ** because ** they need to worry about their livelihood ( $ $ $ ) as no one that they find desirable would marry them . 
  hungary used to have 67 % divorce rate a few years ago ( you can check on eurostat ) and the feminists are quite active here despite us being one of the poorest eu members, 
   games, 
  back then i did play metro2033 for a while and liked it , but then i had other things to do , and that way i stopped playing games altogether ( except for tiny html5 games ) , which also made the switch to linux possible as i was sick of microssoft already . 
  the stalker series is my personal favorite , i 've played all 3 games vanilla and with different mods as well . 
  i love it this much because of the atmosphere and because it 's a perfect blend of rpg and fps . 
  if the stock cooler sucks , then the whole `` product '' sucks ... how come intel can supply adequate cooling while amd ca n't ? 
  as of the rest of your comment vomit ... 
  i wo n't waste my time with you anymore as you ca n't even be bothered to use paragraphs ... in other words , you 're blocked . 
   expect vpn service ~ ~ price ~ ~ to ~ ~ start increasing ~ ~ be banned in these countries . 
  fixed that for you ... [ russia has already done it ] ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-internet-iduskbn1af0qi ), 
  ( s ) he posts in lots of libtard subs ( r/europe being an example ) so it 's likely, 
   this is more of an incel post than a mgtow post . 
  imho the incel has the additional meaning of being excessively obsessed with wymyn ( like elliot rodger was ) ... once he 's past that he can become mgtow . 
   also , since when are we doing field reports ? 
  some variation ca n't hurt , 
  once i fully digested the red pill i realized that i ca n't get oneitis anymore ... sure , a truly attractive woman will be on my ( smaller ) mind for a while , but i wo n't catch any feelings because now i know better , my `` operating system '' has been updated so to speak . 
  it also helped to see all the wymyn i know in a different light : awalt . 
  now [ goolag ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3693/89/1600/goolag.jpg ) has flagged you as a nazi :d, 
  the russians were clever enough to use less concrete terms and they banned any technology that can be used to avoid their censorship ... on the other hand , if a vpn provider does block everything they 're required to , they might get a license to operate, 
  this `` guy '' sounds like a total mangina ( female inside ) so just cut contact imho, 
  and at the last level it 'll become [ trigglypuff ] ( https://media3.giphy.com/media/o6sqrr0etm90y/giphy.gif ) :d, 
   she has also told me that she want to find a guy who can provide financially for her because making art does not make her a lot of money . 
  she does n't want you for you , she wants you for your money ... that usually means trapping you with a baby ( maybe not even yours ) , marriage , then after a few years comes the divorce rape and long years of child support ... 
   sometimes i suspect that she does not mean the words she says to me . 
  maybe i should trust my gut instinct . 
  you can sense some red flags , that 's good . 
  you 've probably stumbled upon a female chameleon who will appear as the girl of your dreams , only to change radically once she got commitment from you ... 
  except if it 's a tranny kek, 
  you just gave them another idea to ban :d, 
  pic # 1 : pure projection . 
  wymyns ' life must really suck without a man to leech off financially and emotionally , while we are happier without them and can focus on what we actually want to do , instead of slaving away and breeding, 
  nor would i want to , i have better things to do !, 
  i do n't even have a smartphone cause i do n't need one . 
  family members can call , while the rest of people can wait till i 'm on a computer . 
  [ haha benis : ddddd ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/019/615/120_-_benis.jpg ), 
   eu isnt for me . 
  too liberal ,, 
  sure , the western half, 
   too many expenses just so you can survive, 
  especially true here in hungary ... if i knew i could easily get an it job in norway or finland i 'd jump ship in a heartbeat ... 
  i could n't care less about the rest of the continent , and the rest of the anglosphere is such a huge cancer i 'd never move there willingly ( that includes the usa as well ) . 
  the rest of the world does n't seem very inviting either so for now i 'm stuck here ... 
  really ??? 
  that 's the last place i 'd move to , since any random woman can name you as a father of her disgusting spawn and ** there 's nothing you can do about it ** . 
  fuck texas, 
  that 's partly why jobbik wants to abolish universal suffrage in my country ... ( [ hungarian link ] ( https://alfahir.hu/2017/08/03/valasztojog_demokracia_korlatozas_analfabetizmus_duro_dora_jobbik_szavazatvasarlas ) ), 
  why should people that ca n't even finish primary school vote ? 
  this, 
   do you enjoy being alive overall ? 
  nope but it has been improving since going mgtow ... 
   do you believe life is intrinsically good or not ? 
   would you have children and subject them to this life ? 
  i wo n't because i ca n't stand anyone under 10 ... the younger the more dislike from me ... 
   not going to turn this into a right vs left discussion, 
  there would be no point because both sides are gynocentric and anti-male , they just use different smokescreen so the sheeple will keep voting for them . 
   the mate with harsher parental duties ( not necessarily just pregnancy ) is the more selective breeder . 
  you just have to calculate how many children a person can make during their lifetime ( not counting twins because it 's easier this way ) . 
  - woman : fertile from age 15 to 45 ( approx ) , if she gives birth once every year then 30 kids, 
  - man : even if he impregnates only one woman each day from his teens to [ the rest of his life ] ( https://www.livescience.com/24196-male-fertility-limit.html ) ( 68 is the world average ) , that 's ( 68-13 ) * 365.24 = more than 20k kids !, 
  prove me wrong, 
  protip : you ca n't, 
  haha no, 
  two rapes a day keep feminazism away ... 
  it 's your fault !, 
  that sex doll is cuter than most wymyn i 've ever seen, 
   funny enough , she stayed around for a while after that . 
  shit test, 
  and then she 'll claim you raped her with the pie ... 
  this should be upvoted much more because it 's truth, 
   pussy is already free . 
  why spend $ 5000 on a rubber woman ? 
  because it 's always ready for a go and it wo n't accuse you of all fake shit ?
