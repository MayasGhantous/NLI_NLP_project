  i do n't think anyone could fix this , you have to bail out asap . 
  only with two fingers . 
  spoiler alert : the guy is a chad in incognito . 
  i guess it 's humor or something . 
  and also he is tall . 
  that is the most important , actually . 
  also , if a man really likes her girlfriend/fianc \u00e9 it will not matter . 
  i do n't know , maybe it would be better if he would hold his breath . 
  or maybe i am a bit prejudiced . 
  this is serious , he needs help . 
  yeah , but shaming potential mass shooters will just make more mass shooters . 
  we should ignore him , then wait until he kills a bunch of people and then we could finally say : `` this was just a evil madman !, 
  how could anyone have predicted this ? 
  no one could do anything to stop him ! '' . 
  then repeat . 
  \\* * ahem * \\* m'lady , can i be your evangelist ? 
  \\* * tips cross respectfully * \\*, 
  the backpedaling always gets me . 
  the last comment is just so perfect . 
  and this is how you get to the ** manfriendzone ** . 
  nice strawman `` argument '' . 
  exactly . 
  but , let hate flow !, 
  harry potter 's mother ? 
  i guess they mean , that they are `` beta '' which , by definition comes after the `` alphas '' and `` normies '' ( normal people ) . 
  back when forced marriages were the thing . 
  nothing , it 's just venting . 
  nothing , it 's just venting . 
  nothing , it 's just venting . 
  yeah , all those who had a hard time to deal with rejection are idiots , right ? 
  i know that feeling bro . 
  it 's hard . 
  guess , you are lucky . 
  yeah , i think he is a chad . 
  are you kidding , right ? 
   i love how career choice is a problem ... 
  for a lot of people , it is . 
  she is not a third-wave feminist , though . 
  i guess she already rejected her . 
  not that if it 's matters , just saying . 
  have you ever been on the internet before ? 
  his next book : the real story of how a chad stole my bucks , by beta bunfry . 
  this `` they owe you nothing '' gets really boring . 
  no one said that . 
  this is what he said :, 
   in my experience , the fourth box rarely happens . 
  i 've experienced various combinations of awkwardness or coldness in the interest of not leading me on . 
  now , you said :, 
   he gets mad and upset . 
  if you got rejected it 's normal to be upset , but he never wrote that he got mad . 
  that of course is not okay . 
   guy asks the girl out , for reasons ?? 
  she obv says no , you are a friend . 
  how would he know if he did n't ask ? 
   yeah , its not expecting anything , but if you keep doing it , it is expecting friendship with a girl to lead to love . 
  okay , but he never said that either . 
   if you tired of hearing it , you probably need to hear it more . 
  that just does n't make any sense . 
  being yourself is really hard with someone you `` like like '' , because if she rejects you she rejects the real you . 
  also you want to be nice , you do n't want to offend or push away her with your bad personality traits . 
  but this makes you generic , expandable , dishonest and that is what really could push away people . 
  this is the real source of niceguyism ^ tm . 
  i think we all been there or still there , it 's really hard to grow out . 
  i hope we can get there . 
  it 's never too late to start making them . 
  yeah , but the orbcomm-2 mission was a `` land landing '' , so the footage was already there , no need to transfer it from the ship the whole process was much easier . 
  but i really hope we get a new recap , that would be phenomenal . 
  so , that means , i am allowed to complain ? 
  sometimes this sub can be as stupid as niceguys themselfs . 
  but there are a lot of man who are obsessed with gingers , i do n't know if it 's true for short man on the other side . 
  i do n't get it . 
  but , he does n't even react it in a nice guy way . 
  he is just sad . 
  i live in a western-ish society , still do n't see what is the problem . 
  when you find out his net worth . 
  but sometimes , is n't the way some people express themselves makes them a niceguy ? 
  this is so true . 
  because you are a woman , man have to always come forward trying to `` woo '' you . 
  on the other end this is rarely the case for guys , especially niceguys . 
  they ca n't just move along , because if they got the courage to try to even speak to their crush , then they already put her on the pedestal , idealizing , without even really knowing her . 
  could easily saved with : `` yeah you see , we can already agree on this thing . 
  [ blabla something flirty ] . '', 
  genuine question : what happens if she does n't made it clear that she sees him as a friend , but also did n't said yes to his invitations due to some reason ? 
  it 's basically the same when niceguys assume that man who are great with woman are all assholes . 
  so the one who can win a fight with his majestic sword , protecting his one true waifu ? 
  oldie , but goldie . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh_el5iexp0 man sees his girlfriend 's period blood for the first time, 
  just buzzfeed being buzzfeed ... 
  i thought he meant scene . 
  like leaving him on the scene . 
  weird . 
  yes , i know that , but this was my first interpreation . 
  that escalated quickly ... 
  yea , but she also allows this , because of the money ... 
  and now they are not even friends , right ? 
  i hate neggers . 
  neg them into slavery ? 
  sure . 
  like everybody that i know . 
  niceguys would really love that .
