  just think about it , the group has been active for 25 years now , for 10 years it was basically what we call al-qaeda . 
  when the syrian revolution started the al-nusra front became the main jihadist organization , and you have to know that al-nusra even today a branch of of al [ qaeda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-nusra_front ) . 
  basically the nusra front is the representative of al-qaeda in syra . 
  but most fighting took place in the west of the country , where most big cities are and therefore population as well . 
  aqi still under this name simply went into syria from iraq by the loosely guarded desert border between iraq and syria . 
  it was ** very ** easy for them to expel the fsa ( free syrian army ) from al-raqqa , if i know correctly there was n't even a fight for the town as the fsa did n't give strategic importance to a town in the middle of the desert . 
  but now al-qaeda faced a problem , as they did n't want two separate braches in syria . 
  al-zawahiri the leader of al-qaeda gave an ultimatum ( sorry ca n't give reference but if you dig in , you 'll find information as the letter is public ) to aqi to either join the al-nusra front or continue the jihad in iraq . 
  of course al-baghdadi said no , and so they became an independent organization , changed their name and isis was born . 
  i have to repeat , that the absolutely ** only ** reason we think they are more brutal than al-qaeda is because they post hd videos of their mass executions . 
  this is the only reason , every side in this war ( and many other wars ) does mass executions , radicals chop heads off unfortunately , and show off the head of the victims . 
  no one else brags about it and does hd documentaries . 
  even to this day i 'd rather get my head cut off than be in assad 's prison and die by [ hunger ] ( http://www.pierrepiccinin.eu/pages/syria-a-journey-to-hell-7890737.html ) and [ torture ] ( http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/photo-gallery/syria-army-defectors-photos ) ( ** highly nsfw ** ) in assad 's prisons . 
  of course i 'm not a supporter to is in any way . 
  can confirm that as i had to quit at 18 because of a knee injury . 
  all the people who try to go pro sacrifices many things `` inside '' as well . 
  i realized that my problem solving was terrible : for example if a girl would reject me or if i 'd get a bad mark i 'd be devastated , but when i played hockey i had trainings in the same evening and did n't care about anything else . 
  `` fuck it i 'm going to be a hockey player '' was my mentality . 
  i know for a fact that i ( and most athletes as well ) was so extremely confident and cocky because i had a great career . 
  it 's probably not healthy , because you should n't rely so heavily on one single thing , but ... if you go pro you more or less have to . 
  first of all i 'd like to thank you all for all the great work . 
  my suggestions :, 
  - i 'd love to see more ama 's as stated before . 
  but i 'd like to point out that any user can set up an ama it should n't be the mods job alone , i think their approval suffice . 
  - someone pointed out that this sub should solely relate to the syrian crisis and i strongly disagree as any gains in iraq has a direct effect on the syrian crisis . 
  for example when the us vehicles were seized by is in mosul everyone here started saying that they 're going to show up in syria , as they did . 
  thanks and keep up the great work . 
  this page is still number one on the syrian civil war for me . 
  it sure is a big amount , but i 'd have to stress that much of that territory is desert . 
  that territory in my opinion is n't a game changer , except on the oil production . 
  do you really these people really are alive ... ? 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  we know is is capable of this , so why would n't they actually do it . 
  oh right , i misunderstood . 
  apart from what other people said that showing to whole beheading would alienate the group even more , i ca n't think of any other reason . 
  to be honest i never watch the until the very end . 
  it just would n't be any logic in faking it , in my opinion . 
  i honestly ca n't figure out any reason why they would n't kill these men unfortunately . 
  life is beautiful, 
  thank you sooooooooooo much for setting this up !, 
  you guys are amazing . 
  apart from a few families , there are no civilians left in jobar . 
  p\u00e1l d\u00e1rdai takes over until december . 
  not that i like him or think pint\u00e9r is a good coach , i 'd rather have kept him until we find a good replacement . 
  i like d\u00e1rdai , but the guy is the head coach of hertha u15 team , it 's ridiculous that you can lead a national team from there ... 
  i 'm all for a foreign , preferably scandinavian guy taking over our team , who has limited powers on the youth front as well . 
  i like v\u00e1rhidi , but i would rather have someone who has more or less proven himself on an international level . 
  no bajner no party !, 
  besic can play cb . 
  things do n't seem to get better either ... 
  the u19 ec which was held here in hungary ended in a fiasco for us . 
  the coach of our senior team was sacked after his first competitive game last week after we lost against northern ireland at home . 
  d\u00e1rdai , who has taken over as interim coach , comes from training the u15 at hertha ... 
  terrorist enablers ??? 
  air support for is ??? 
  it is very sad that someone thinks this way ... 
  keep it in case , something really happened , 
  good pass as well . . 
  did anyone else see that old man cheering after the goal missing a bunch of tooth ? 
  thought that was funny . 
  hope valencia makes cl this season , they are looking really good so far this season . 
  edit : valelcia, 
  yeah sorry about that ... 
  yeah , but we 're not talking about a couple of scouts either . 
  they have somewhere around 10 employees whose only job is to watch games on tv , imagine that . 
  they might pick out one or two players from swedish second division , or ghana , then the `` real '' scouts take a look at them , and eventually there might be a signing . 
  their scouting is one of the best in the world when finding unknown players from very low reputation leagues . 
  milan and the big teams do n't need to have that kind of scouting to survive as they have the resources to buy the already proven players . 
  you ca n't really buy `` a few of them '' as udinese buys like 15 players/window ( just check transfermarkt ) with 80 % not turning out well , but they make money of the 20 % . 
  obviously they do n't know beforehand who will turn out to be the next asamoah , isla , pereyra . 
  if you look how they are performing , one season they are all right ( el ) next season they are mid-table , that 's something milan just can not do . 
  4th knee surgery from ice hockey over here . 
  acl , mcl , meniscous has been operated 3 times ... physiotheraphy is really painful as i can still not bend my knee fully . 
  sorry to hear that , try to find other hobbies , replace sport with something else , even though it is difficult . 
  here is their squad that year : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%e2%80%9304_ottawa_senators_season, 
  i just ca n't thank you enough !, 
  / u/raduev , you 're so biased , i can never get strength to reply any of your post because , i 'm pretty sure there is no way i can change your mind ... for anyone who is interested in the relation between the assad family and extremists i suggest a great summary of a book written by professor neumann , a teacher at king 's college , so not some nobody . 
  me personally , half the man mr neumann is , do n't think that there was a signed deal between is and the regime . 
  i do believe however that both of them were happy with not attacking each other . 
  it is no coincidence that assad only bombed al-raqqa with his airplanes when the us started bombing is in iraq , the regime was waiting for that moment . 
  it is no coincidence in my opinion either that isis did n't attack the army bases in the raqqa region until their capital was hit with airplane missiles . 
  sure there was n't a written agreement signed by lawyers or anything like that ... 
  while it was punishable by death penalty to pray publicly in syria , in the prisons however used religion as a tool . 
  in the 2011 pardoning , it was n't the human right activist who were set free , but people the assad regime intentionally radicalized , firstly to send to iraq especially to hurt western interest . 
  now he could use them to radicalize the revolution . 
  anyone who does n't see that the regime has uses extremism for their own purposes , is either to biased , or have n't read the history of this country . 
  edit : spelling, 
  thanks for this great summary !, 
  i 've got a feeling that in medium-long term , if things do n't stabilize in syria and iraq , jordan will be in a very difficult position . 
  i 'm sure the al-nusra leader thinks that jordan is ruled by `` persian & jews '' . 
  obviously instigating something right now would be a bad strategic move ( even though with is we never know ) , but i think there are elements outside of amman who would be receptive . 
  anyways this is a big if , no one knows what the future holds . 
  it is naive to say that the rebels only got weapons from other gulf countries , as for one , it is fairly easy to get weapons in the middle-east , and the syrian government has a bunch of weapons as well . 
  many rebel groups have tanks now , obviously they were n't airlifted to them by external supporters , they were wither stolen , or handed to them by defectors . 
  i think many people ( especially regime supporters ) overestimate foreign support for the rebels . 
  this revolution would still take place with or without them , probably the rebels would n't be in such a strong position without it , but an armed rebellion would have still taken place . 
  it 's crazy that you got downvoted because of your flair and for you being pro-opposition ... 
  i 'm not pro opposition , neither pro assad , but it 's fair to say that assad caused and escalated this crisis intentionally . 
  if he would have left power in the beginning , i 'm pretty sure we would n't have had 200.000 people dead at this point . 
  sure , we could easily have seen something that is happening in libya right now , but with a smooth transition of power there is no way things would be this bad ...
