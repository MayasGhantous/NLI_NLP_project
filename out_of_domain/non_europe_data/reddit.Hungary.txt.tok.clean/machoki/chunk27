  i took a wrong turn once and ended up in a ghost town just outside dahab . 
  on the road from dahab to sharm ( or from dahab to nuweiba ) there was barely anyone on the road , almost no buses , no cars . 
  i saw at least the same amount of army pick ups as civilian cars . 
  the tourism in this region is fucked . 
  exactly . 
  it 's going to be interesting to see how the team performs after ibra retires from the nt . 
  on paper dzsudzsak but kleinheisler has been really good in the nt . 
  hope he 'll be in the starting 11 at werder bremen next season . 
  probably not the full 90 min every game but he 'll get his fair share . 
  probably the only person watching this in egypt . 
  as a hungarian . 
  long live hockey . 
  we will ressurect . 
  i can share a funny story :, 
  a lot of people hate the atlanta spirit group and bruce levenson . 
  about then years ago a quite young me sent an email to him ( i found his email on the thrashers site ) . 
  i wrote something like i love the team and keep up the good work . 
  well he answered and from that every year we emailed each other two times : merry christmas and at the end of the season . 
  a couple of years later he asked for my adress . 
  it 's worth to note that i lived in hungary which is probably a place few people heard of . 
  he sent a signed autographed trashers jersey . 
  it was signed by my favourite player , ilya kovalchuk . 
  you can imagine how happy i was . 
  so yeah he probably messed up big time in atlanta but i 'm sure he 's a great person . 
  source ? 
  no of course not . 
  just wanted a source . 
  i 'm not sure what 's the problem here . 
  i consider myself somewhat informed about the subject , and it is obvious that turkey is supporting the rebels and daesh by all means possible . 
  i know that , and i can easily find sources . 
  what 's the problem with asking for another one ? 
  the more reliable sources the better . 
  the more information , the better . 
  i wish . 
  nothing like the thrashers , but i keep an eye out for the kings and montreal . 
  a bit for toronto as well , however bad that sounds . 
  i like the passionate fans over there . 
  i posted it two times before as comment . 
  and once on hfboards when a lot of people were bashing the sale , but that was years ago . 
  i follow our former players who stayed with the jets . 
  they even have the `` thrashers line '' or whatever it 's called . 
  but it 's not the same thing for me . 
  and winnipeg leadership , fans and even some former players have been quite nasty against the thrashers community , so no i definitely do n't support them . 
  i always chuckle that they are performing as badly as the thrashers did or even worse ( sorry jets fans ) . 
  thank you kind stranger . 
  i remember using sopcast back then . 
  oh yes budapest is beautiful !, 
  and the women ... 
  it was mostly when the team was sold . 
  things were said that we never had fans , and team sucked ... 
  i think a few players said some nasty things as well , which hurt . 
  some felt sympathy though as well !, 
  i 'm not mad on the jets though , because you 're a bigger hockey town , you deserve a team , and you 've lost one as well before . 
  yes of course , you had every right , and as i said you deserve a team !, 
  unfortunately it was the thrashers . 
  i got some kind of a certificate as well with it , i would post it but i 'm not at home for a couple of weeks . 
  `` and the all the benefits from the success a sugar daddy would bring '' . 
  it would be a win-win situation for him . 
  he could blame the new owners if there is no success and take all the credit if there is . 
  i was living in sweden as a kid , and started playing hockey there . 
  i think i thought the atlanta thrashers was a cool name , and they became established when i started following the nhl in the newspaper . 
  they did it at a framing place . 
  not perfect that 's true . 
  i was watching the game . 
  al ahly scored the first goal , and that 's when the two players from arab contractors were sent off . 
  it happened like this :, 
  shot from about 25 meters , the al ahly player is first on the rebound , and makes contact with the goalkeeper . 
  the ball trickles in the goal . 
  i could n't really see if he actually touched the ball ( i think he did ) , or the defender just behind him scored an own goal . 
  neverthless the goal counted and the majority of the ac players went to the referree screeming and shouting . 
  one red card , and soon thereafter another one . 
  they did n't or barely touch the referee , they were protesting just like they would anywhere in europe after a dubious decision resulting in a goal . 
  of course i do n't know what they said , but it 's shocking that they recieved two red cards simply for protesting . 
  the 20 % is not on top of the transfer fee . 
  it 's part of it . 
  an awful lot of insurgents killed compared to egyptian military forces . 
  wonder what 's really happening . 
  is that plane syrian or russian ? 
  it has a syrian flag on it , but seems to be run by russian soldiers . 
  has it recently been supplied to the gov. 
  my guess for the starting 11 . 
  we 'll be interesting to see where gera will play , as he 's been used at cm as well . 
  then perhaps n\u00e9meth will play on the wing . 
  i think it will be key for elek to be fit for the euroes as he 's been out for almost a month now . 
  since i 'm bored , and y' all probably barely know any of these players i figured to give a run down on each one of them . 
  ** g\u00e1bor kir\u00e1ly ** he will start in the gk position . 
  has been really solid in the nt the past couple of years , and is playing back at is home town club halad\u00e1s . 
  it 's a no brainer . 
  ** d\u00e9nes dibusz ** starting goalkeeper for the hungarian champions ferencv\u00e1ros , and he 's been waiting to make a move to western europe . 
  we 'll see what will happen , he did n't have a very good spring , and might just as well stay in budapest for the cl qualifications, 
  ** p\u00e9ter gul\u00e1csi ** plays for everyone 's favourite promoted club rb leipzig of germany , and he 's been there starting goalkeeper this spring . 
  he 's pretty solid , and was in liverpool reserves for a couple of years with the former wonderkig turned bus kriszti\u00e1n n\u00e9meth . 
  defenders, 
  ** barnab\u00e1s bese ** our coach storck likes to try out young wing backs , and he 'll most likely just be on the bench on this one . 
  will be a nice little experience for him . 
  plays in n\u00e9meth 's and gul\u00e1csi 's youth club mtk in hungary . 
  ** attila fiola ** finally we have a solid right back , we 've been waiting for that for years . 
  he 's solid defensively and he can go forward . 
  he 's 27 ( i think ) , and he 'll try to sign abroad as his team felcsut just got relegated . 
  ** rich\u00e1rd guzmics ** signed for wisla krakow this summer and has been playing good .
