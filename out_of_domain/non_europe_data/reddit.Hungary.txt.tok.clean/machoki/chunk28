  he we 'll be one of the cbs . 
  big , tall and slow , but he does his job in a decent manner . 
  ** roland juh\u00e1sz ** the former anderlecht cb is now about 32 and plays back home in videoton . 
  given his experience i would n't be surprised if he would be the other cb this euroes . 
  as his companions he 's big , strong , tall but very slow . 
  good in positioning though so that helps, 
  ** tam\u00e1s k\u00e1d\u00e1r ** plays regularely in lech poznan , he 'll start imo in the left back role , but he can play cb as well , and has been doing that well . 
  either way he 'll be in the starting line up . 
  ** korhut mih\u00e1ly ** if k\u00e1d\u00e1r plays as cb then this gentlemen who has been playing very well in debrecen back home will play as lb . 
  good going forward , but has yet to play on the international stage . 
  he might be good enough though . 
  ** \u00c1d\u00e1m lang ** this young videoton cb is on the bench ( behind juh\u00e1sz ) in his club , but played as guzmics 's pair in the play off against norway . 
  he has the opportunity for the starting eleven ( again if k\u00e1d\u00e1r will be lb ) . 
  he 's thin but fast , something we lack . 
  midfielders, 
  ** \u00c1kos elek ** he 's our only box to boy midfielder , and we desperately need him to be fit . 
  plays in di\u00f3sgy\u0151r back home , and at the age of 27 this is his last chance for a contract abroad . 
  played in china and turkey before . 
  seem clumpsy and bad tecnically , but when he manages to run with ball he 's the poor mans pogba . 
  if fit he 'll be in the starting 11 . 
  ** zolt\u00e1n gera ** he 's 36 now ( i think ) and plays in ferencv\u00e1ros . 
  he 'll either play as cm , or rm . 
  to old and slow to play the full 90 min ( at least in every game ) , but his experience we 'll be invaluable . 
  if he would be younger he would be a key member of the squad . 
  he 's been showing his age, 
  ** l\u00e1szl\u00f3 kleinheisler ** werder bremen signed him this winter , but has had rerely any playing time . 
  he 'll start in the am position though . 
  he 's small but really good dribbler , and good in small spaces . 
  hard to take the ball from him, 
  ** gerg\u0151 lovrencsics ** did n't have the best season in lech poznan . 
  in the rm position he have n't scored a goal , but has a decent shot from long range , and good crosser . 
  he will sit on the bench , and hope to continue playing abroad next season . 
  he has showed that he has the quality but injuries have plauged him, 
  ** \u00c1d\u00e1m nagy ** this 21 years old young ferencv\u00e1ros player has been regularely earning a starting position in storck 's team . 
  he 'll probably start as a cm . 
  he 's small , weak , but fairly good with the ball . 
  his job will be to link up play . 
  he 'll try to sign abroad , but given his qualities he can just hope for a team trying to avoid relegation in the big 4 leagues . 
  if elek is not fit , i can see this man play instead of him . 
  sort of the same playing style as the former , but even worse with the ball . 
  i can see him being used to shut down portugal . 
  ** zolt\u00e1n stieber ** rm in n\u00fcrnberg where he 's on the bench , before that in autumn he played around 10 minutes total in hamburg . 
  he was a regular starter in the nt when he was playing for his club as well . 
  needs confidence to play good ( and then he 's good ) , but he lacks that now . 
  he 's to weak , but fairly good crosser and dribbler . 
  srikers, 
  big target man who 's about 100 kg and 28 years old . 
  he 's in the right position at the right time , and he 's better technically than akinfewa . 
  i can see him being thrown in the last 10 minutes to shut a game down , or force one in . 
  ** bal\u00e1zs dzsudzs\u00e1k ** our best player , who will want to leave bursaspor after a mediocre season . 
  he 'll be on the left wing . 
  exceptional shot and left wook , but tends to drift out of the game from time to time . 
  much will hang on his performace . 
  ** kriszti\u00e1n n\u00e9meth ** decided to leave kanskas city to sign a big contract somewhere in quatar . 
  he might start on the right wing , but doubt it . 
  he is a failed wonderkid who have never managed to perform in the euroes . 
  might be good if we can control a game ( iceland ? ) . 
  ** tam\u00e1s priskin ** about 30 years old failed former watford pl signing striker who has been playing fairly well for slovan bratislava . 
  szalai will probably be our main striker , but priskin is better than him technically , but worse physically . 
  will get his time in the ec in my opinion . 
  ** \u00c1d\u00e1m szalai ** played in hannover on loan from hoffenheim this season and has n't scored a goal in the bundesliga for two years . 
  storck loves him though , and he 's right in the way that szalai is our best target man . 
  but with 0 confidence the chances of him scoring our making plays are slim . 
  if our team wo n't get a point , the public we 'll blame him . 
  lang has never played left back . 
  no one in your midfield is good in defending . 
  this might work against weaker teams , but not stronger ones , in my opinion . 
  sorry , forgot to write about him !, 
  ** nikolic nemanja ** he has been in amazing form for legia warsaw , winning the top goalscoarer award in the league . 
  until february he had one goal/game ratio . 
  unfortunately for him , the tactics just do n't suit he 's style of play . 
  even though he 's our best finisher and poacher , he 'll probably not get a lot of playing time . 
  you are very welcome sir !, 
  yeah he 'll definitely start . 
  he 's still under contract at halad\u00e1s for next season . 
  yes he does !, 
  it 's a shame he never made it at newcastle . 
  how did he perform there do you remember ? 
  anyways , after newcastle he went to holland ( i think roda ) , before turning back home to di\u00f3sgy\u0151r in the hungarian league , where he became the team captain , and started to play regularely in the nt . 
  lech poznan bought him , and he is in their starting eleven . 
  he has probably become our most importan piece in the defence . 
  he 's still only 26 . 
  well this is dusgusting . 
  so a couple of guys can say someone is isis without any notable proof ... easy way to get rid of your enemies . 
  since rojava produce an abundance of flour , wheat , and other agriculutaral products , where is it being sold ? 
  thank you . 
  do you sometimes export to rebel/isis/government held territory as well ? 
  i do n't think that 's a problem , as with these food exports the only people who gain from that is the average citizen . 
  thanks for the video !, 
  this happens all the time , unfortunately . 
  when you mean by air , does that mean the government ? 
  yeah i understand what you mean , but i hope you 've got nothing to worry about . 
  i think there is a bigger possibility of him fucking up than leaning towards one team . 
  there are four williams in the squad . 
  i always mix up the end !, 
  as a lech poznan fan what is you opinion about k\u00e1d\u00e1r ( who has been linked to the pl now a bit ) and that you are releasing lovrencsics ? 
  okay , i 'm just going ahead and answer all the questions about our goalkeeper . 
  - yes he 's wearing a pyjamas . 
  - why ? 
  because he feels comfortable in them .
