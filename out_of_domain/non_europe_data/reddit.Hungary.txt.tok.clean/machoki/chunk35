  happy times . 
  i know kuftari 's on bashar 's left , but who is on his right ? 
  it 's always the same person at eid prayers . 
  would n't call us ' and russia 's participation in syria as some kind of a proxy war . 
  both are conducting airstrikes . 
  both are directly involved on the ground as well . 
  we have seen the russian sniper complication for example . 
  us special ops have conducted raids inside syrian territory and moreover are supporting the ypg with artillery ( perhaps even manned by us soldiers ) . 
  us armored vehicles are stationed and are patrolling to deter further turkish expansion . 
  we have seen coalition soldiers fire tow missiles ( i think it was in syria , but perhaps iraq , i 'm not sure ) . 
  a proxy war would be if an actor would fund another actor on the ground . 
  this is much more than that . 
  i would rather call out the saudis , the qataris and the jordanians as players who are conducting a proxy war . 
  even with all these relief efforts , i think that capabilities and resources are n't enough to feed half of the syrian population .

  us does n't fund refugee camps who 're in syrian regime territory ( surprisingly the eu does aid them as well as the un ) . 
  concerning the camps outside of syria :, 
  eu as a whole biggest funder and then the us . 
  from the interview : `` if this decision goes into effect , i 'm going to turkey -- no doubt about it . 
  this is how most of my smoker friends i 've spoken with about this decision see it . '', 
  now that 's some serious addiction . 
  `` national identity '' faaar younger than that . 
  can someone send me a mirror of this please ? 
  most parties are close or even rely on the egyptian regime/army , so it does n't really matter imo . 
  not all articles on moc are translations . 
  for example this one is n't . 
  out of curiosity , why suggests the words you highlight , that 's it 's written by a french person ? 
  sort it by new . 
  unfortunately that 's the best way nowadays . 
  it means `` from the roots '' in hungarian . 
  yeah , the downside with this is that you have to dig deeper . 
  so no fast news checks . 
  on the plus side you can find content that you would n't otherwise , such as in-depth articles or reports . 
  i would like to score a point at my university teacher . 
  i 've read that it could be a sort of gold money , italian slang ect . 
  is there one definition ? 
  he gave an interview to al-akhbar 's arabic version today it seems . 
  officially it will be broadcasted next thursday in tv , but would be cool to be able to read it before . 
  he 'll probably say the same old stuff but still . 
  any help would be deeply appriciated . 
  arabic version : http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/208308, 
  personality wise !, 
  for me its that bosnian asshole called zlatan ibrakadabra . 
  captain of the swedish side , and admitted that he does n't know the national anthem . 
  and sees nothing wrong with it . 
  hello everyone . 
  i 've injured my knee pretty bad a couple of years ago , and i 'm required to do my 4th acl surgery . 
  it 's pretty much last chance . 
  i got to speak with a doctor call gy\u00f6rgy kov\u00e1cs , and he seemed really good . 
  the operation is really expensive though , it 's in a private hospital called mein klinik , http://www.mainklinik-frankfurt.de/# !, 
  i the doctor said that he operated bundesliga players ( i had an ice hockey injury ) , but unfortunately i have n't found any reliable information about him , or who he operates . 
  maybe they ca n't give any information out about the surgeries , but i have serious doubts if i should go there . 
  does anyone have any information about this hospital ? 
  di\u00f3sgy\u0151r - birkarkara 2-1 : winning goal 93rd minute , birkarkara 10 men second half . 
  shots : 15-10 , possession : 57 % -43 % . 
  draw would have been deserved . 
  13 shots for sliema + post and missed penalty . 
  11 for ftc . 
  possession equal . 
  sliema should have easily win by more . 
  there is n't really much to say to this . 
  last year the videoton in cl got knocked out by a montenegrian side . 
  apart from szalai and huszti no players in top 5 leagues . 
  neither of them gets invited to the national team . 
  last player sold to top 5 league was 3 years ago . 
  holland-hungary 8-1 last year . 
  my dad said something tonight and was spot on : the coach before , and commentator during the game was mocking the referee because he 's from andorra . 
  i was n't to happy about that either . 
  he said : `` they sent him here because we 're on this level '' . 
  the same time huge amount of tax payers money are being poured into the football the last 4 years with stadiums buit and renovated ( that does n't improve youth coaching ) . 
  for example : home village village of the prime minister they 're building a stadium of 4500 . 
  population 2000 . 
  crazy . 
  the generation of pusk\u00e1s did n't deserve this , and neither the fans . 
  so i 've been using a modafinil the last month or so . 
  i 'm having a knee surgery on tueasday . 
  when should i stop taking it to be safe ? 
  i really would n't want to , but i guess i 'd have to tell the doctors as well . 
  so i have 2 players , both wingers , both have won every imaginable awards . 
  my team has won the epl 2 times in a row , and champions leauge two times in a row as well . 
  still i ca n't get any offer more than $ 53 million for neither of them . 
  they are 24 , not injury prone or anything . 
  i 'm not saying they are on the same level as ronaldo , but they are top 5 in the world , arguably one of them might be the best .
