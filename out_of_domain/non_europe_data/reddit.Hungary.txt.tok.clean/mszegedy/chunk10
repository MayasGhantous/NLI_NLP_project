  i legit have no idea , possibly unlike you . 
  maybe `` wife beater '' ? 
  ( i am not going to rant about how stupid references to xkcd are ; i did that already . 
  instead i give you ... this comment . 
  but i suppose this instance is passable anyway . ), 
  also posting , just write `` see above '' or something, 
  impressive !, 
  just a few nitpicks ( assuming you 're not annotating suprasagimentals ) :, 
  / juz / would be better rendered as a diphthong ; i , being a eurocentric fuck , might use / jyuz / , but i think the actual sounds might be closer to / j\u028auz / . 
  likewise , & lt ; ay & gt ; , which you render as / e / , is actually written / e\u026a / . 
  this is indisputable . 
  there is a wonderful ipa character for referring to english `` uh '' , and it is / \u039b / ( not this unicode character , this is a capital lambda ; i 'm too lazy to copy/paste from wikipedia from an iphone ) . 
  & lt ; plebeians & gt ; is pronounced / pl\u0268bi\u0259nz / . 
  & lt ; no & gt ; contains yet another diphthong : / no\u028a / , and were you british you might even pronounce it / n\u0259o\u028a / . 
  & lt ; there & gt ; and & lt ; their & gt ; contain the previously discussed diphthong / e\u026a / . 
  otherwise , really impressive !, 
  i can never get myself to write full ipa transcriptions , because i am a lazy bastard . 
  `` lose '' rhymes with `` chose '' . 
  but `` chose '' does not rhyme with `` chose '' . 
  so fuck that . 
  edit : no , i 'm a fucking dumbass . 
  hey guys i discovered an instance of orthography in which the `` oo '' / `` o '' situation is reversed, 
  as a speaker of the obscure european language hungarian , which has the exact same vocabulary as german ( but with more demonstrative pronouns ) , i must ask : is n't it the same in every single fucking european language ever ? 
  ( by the way :, 
  really common : german, 
  common : slovak ( ian ? ), 
  obscure : hungarian, 
  really obscure : chuvash ), 
  huh . 
  this is one german compound that does n't appear in hungarian ( we have `` keszty\u0171 '' , made up of `` k\u00e9z '' , `` hand '' , and never mind i take it back ), 
  just leaving this up here for posterity and humor . 
  commenting for future reference . 
  this is why i love reddit .

  i do swear , once , i was cutting fried pork with that knife , and was going all , `` damn these rubbery ligaments , they are kind of annoying to cut , '' and it turned out i was cutting with the wrong side . 
  so bwraf, 
  i 've always thought that this was common knowledge ... 
  so now this is a place for content ? 
  cool, 
  i like this drawing very much !, 
  it is incredibly detailed , accurate , and realistic .

  \\* pun made somewhat less funny by the fact that both words have the same etymon *,

  here in eagleland , it 's singular `` staff '' , and plural `` staves '' .

  the vast majority of games considered `` good '' by gamers are unsuitably violent for children of the age you have described ; they are not very much so , containing little of the stereotypical blood and gore limned in frothily scathing tracts by virtual gaming opponents ; however , they contain ample violence to raise enough eyebrows to be unsuitable for such a gift . 
  without deeply penetrating consideration of the matter , i am able to address two games that fall under both of your criteria ; that is , educational , and pure fun . 
  the first is an indie ( developed by one person ) game called minecraft . 
  it is a game in which you control a builder in a three-dimensional , low-resolution world of blocks . 
  it is very similar to the physical toy of legos , only one 's building space is literally infinite in all directions ( except the vertical , where one is restricted to 128 blocks in height ) , there is the added challenge of collecting the blocks ( the easiest block to acquire is dirt , which comprises the ground , then wood , which comprises the trunks of trees ; there are several ores one can obtain by spelunking , etc. 
  ) , and that of staying alive ( there is a day/night cycle ; in places that are dark , very , very low-resolution monsters will spawn , threatening the player , and sometimes his work ) , and finally blocks have certain purposes and unique properties ( grass can grow on dirt , and one can also farm wheat , watermelons , and pumpkins on dirt ; all wooden blocks will burn ; magma will burn the player and destroy items ; etc. ) . 
  there are creative modes as well as survival modes , and it makes a great game for one seeking to create . 
  the second game that i must mention is portal , and its unanimously-determined-to-be-better sequel , portal 2 . 
  i will herein focus specifically on portal 2 , as portal is too short to qualify as a long game ( that is , one that can not be beaten in a single day , and rather takes months to complete ) , and lacks several of the things that make portal 2 an enjoyable game ( such as a proper plot ) . 
  portal 2 is a linear ( rather than open-world like minecraft ) three-dimensional platformer ( a game that centers on the player moving around on a stage/level ) with nearly photorealistic graphics , wherein the player must solve puzzles in a rundown scientific facility using the only tool at their disposal , a gun that creates two portals linked to each other at any distance . 
  this means that anything that enters one portal ( usually you ) comes out the other . 
  only two portals may exist at once , one linked to another . 
  the puzzles center around getting to the exit , performing tasks with one 's pair of portals that would have been otherwise impossible to pull off ( such as crossing chasms , getting up to high ledges , etc. ) . 
  elements are added gradually to the game that makes these puzzles more and more difficult , such as surfaces that do not conduct portals , doors that only open when a cube is placed on a pressure-sensitive plate , plates that catapult the player and other objects when stepped on , intangible fields in the air across which one can not fire portals , etc. 
  the plot is gripping . 
  the ( silent ) player is the only human character , aided alternately by a patronizing female a.i. 
  with a grudge and an absentminded male a.i. 
  who is not very bright , becoming antagonists when not helping you . 
  the story takes you deeper and deeper into the facility , exploring the tale of the brilliant madman scientist founder with a comical lack of business sense ( he invented a gel that annuls all friction , and tried to sell it as a food additive -_- ) . 
  it is truly very enveloping , and has a beautiful and satisfying ending . 
  i must warn that the puzzles become quite hard , especially it one has not yet learned to `` think with portals '' ( a phrase from the first game ) , and instinctively apply the logical consequences of using portals to the problems , such as the law of conservation of momentum ( one excellent way to vault oneself across the room is to create one portal very high on a wall , and another one directly below it on the ground ; the player goes into the portal on the bottom , jumps out the top one back into the bottom one , accelerating due to gravity , and shooting out of the top one at a high velocity ; wikipedia has an excellent diagram ) . 
  in conclusion , this is an excellent , challenging , educational game , with the added veneer of an absolutely wonderful plot and blindingly high-resolution graphics . 
  i humbly hope you will consider my analyses here presented for your perusal . 
  good day . 
  i hope so too . 
  everyone deserves to play these masterpieces , irrespective of their equipment . 
  i agree with this selection . 
  it is a well-built two-dimensional platformer that will entertain nearly anyone . 
  a bit short though . 
  ( i do worry that portal may be a tad hard , but my sister at nine years old was able beat the sequel quite soundly . 
  i suspect a seven-year-old would have a similarly small amount of difficulty ; there are two-ayer cooperative puzzles , anyway . 
  minecraft is , in my opinion , suitable for the two younger children , and for the three year old perhaps a humongous entertainment game would be the ideal choice . 
  i also worry somewhat about your processing power ; you will definitely have to tone down the graphics of portal to make it run smoothly on your pc , but i think it is completely doable . 
  minecraft will run without question , on somewhat low graphics settings for perfectly smooth playback , a little higher for a bit more choppy but more convenient and pretty graphics . ), 
  wait for it ... like clockwork ... 
  edit : yup , there it is . 
  cat fact bot strikes again . 
  would it be possible to tone down my cat fact level , to , say , 50 % of my posts , as opposed to the current 100 % of my posts ? 
  in this thread in particular , your cat facts have become more of a hindrance than a boon . 
  yeah , but it 's been forever since they have released anything half-life related . 
  it is acceptable to take one 's time , but unacceptable to take years and years without any notice . 
  i feel stupid . 
  what movie is this from ? 
  if i knew how to make cakes ( ice cream cakes , the kind of cake that i actually like ) , then minecraft would so be on my list of game-cakes-to-be-created . 
  along with settlers of catan , dwarf fortress , portal , conway 's game of life , and homestuck ( oh shut up parts of it are a game ) . 
  epic job , i wish i could do this !,
