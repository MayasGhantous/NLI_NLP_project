  it 's saying that they are n't perfect . 
  failing god just means that you have some self-improvement left to do . 
  and who does n't ? 
  are you saying that everyone should have utter self-confidence ? 
  foolhardiness is n't a positive virtue . 
  you 're lying to yourself if you think you 're perfect .

  i 'll do this . 
  brb .

  why is he getting downvoted ? 
  he was n't criticizing the joke . 
  he was adding to it . 
  we have ~ 150 teenagers on here ? 
  i feel bad for badmouthing them . 
  ( kidding . 
  i 'm one of them . ), 
  but it 's pandering !, 
  having spent lots of time in the us ( eastern part mostly ) , / r/atheism is the first time i heard of chick-fil-a . 
  they sound delicious , though ... 
  as did i. i 'm with you here . 
  no , i do think it exists . 
  it 's just presented in a format that it seems so much like something that redditors would make up ... 
  but this is the sort of thing this subreddit is for . 
  if you 're tired of it , no one 's keeping you here . 
  ... but it 's a * shitty * troll !, 
  op clearly does n't have autism . 
  it 's almost painful to watch . 
  construct a language based on naks ? 
  i could do that . 
  ( but what you 're probably actually doing is making a thing that reads things aloud . 
  cool !, 
  i would n't base it on fundamental phonetics , though ; way too many things to record , as english , and indeed most languages have subtle changes in phonemes based on the phonemes surrounding them . 
  that , and tonality . 
  and the fact that it 'll sound discordant , i.e. 
  please , just use words ! ), 
  [ * n * ] = on a scale of 1 to 10 i am * n * high on weed, 
  no , i do n't . 
  but i do think that a6 a1-5 will follow the same format as a1-5 . 
  a6a4 will be the alpha kids mucking around in the medium . 
  a6a5 will be after they 've met with the beta kids , during which much shit goes down . 
  a6a6 , i do n't know what 's going to happen ( u/u play sburb ? 
  ) , but it 'll be awesome . 
  he was just making a ( funny ) reference . 
  he knows we know hiw magnets work . 
  he made the reference because it related to how he wanted to explain that we do n't know enough about the sun 's magnetic field . 
  not magnets . 
   alien languages might be unimaginably different from human languages in every way you can think of, 
  ooh boy , this gives me ideas . 
  i wonder what a language without \\* any \\* of the parts of speech that we are accustomed to would function like . 
  i do n't even think that 's possible ... 
  ( sorry if i sound a bit uneducated linguistics-wise . 
  i 'm not !, 
  i just like immature speculation . 
  if there 's a universal theory that flatly contradicts me , though , feel free to point it out ; then , i 'll feel foolish . ), 
  you know , it 's people like you ... 
  ( and he was n't validating us . 
  he was * thanking * us . 
  why ca n't he do that ? ), 
  source ? 
  just sometimes . 
  the wiki does n't accept it . 
  also , does your username have any connection whatsoever to the username of popular poster here / u/almostnever ? 
  they show you literal blue waffles . 
  i sometimes try to make them , without much success . 
  ( i refuse to use food coloring . ), 
  but let 's get back on topic , shall we ? 
  maybe even in the negatives ? 
  or was it more like :, 
  edit : i 'm on an iphone . 
  am i able to draw for shit ? 
  edit 2 : [ fuck it . 
  no , i know what it is and have seen pictures of it !, 
  it 's just that the majority of the results are literal blue waffles . 
  or , anyway , if you are standing in front of le 's universe beam or whatever the fuck . 
  and i suggested that people should use them for engineering tanks 'n shit . 
  have we heard this music before ? 
  ( i mean the exact same track . ), 
  but if it was reddit users on stackexchange , then that system would break , too . 
  do we have to turn everything into a stupid xkcd reference now ? 
  how does this have so many upvotes ? 
  i do n't know whether he does british spelling ... 
  a coincidence can not be what is taking place here . 
  they \\* do n't have prototyping towers *, 
  but , he 's the pimp * slayer * ... 
  they \\* do n't have prototyping towers *, 
  his eyes have always been red ... 
  lord english 's powers outmatch green sun powers , though . 
  what i 'm saying is , the two queens ca n't become the two universes . 
  because they ca n't get prototyped . 
  nothing was prototyped anyway , just two kernelsprites with each other endlessly . 
  ( since it takes about five seconds to prototype , the masses of the kernelsprites doubled every five seconds or so . 
  exponential growth if i ever saw it . ), 
  oh sorry , i thought i was replying to an identical post about having stuff prototyped with the uuniverse . 
  they claimed that the two queens ( whire and black ) would become the a and b universes , which is absolutely crazy for a number of reasons . 
   lopan , lotak , and lomax are almost definitely the b2 kids ' planets . 
  well , duh . 
  we know that . 
  but more specifically .
