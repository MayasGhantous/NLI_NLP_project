  i 'm pretty sure that it 's a popular one . 
  however , i have never experienced `` true '' love ( i.e. , marital love ) , or in fact any emotion that i would be willing to label `` love '' , and , being in high school , i am somewhat short on examples of the former . 
  i hope that my perception will change with experience , though . 
   anecdote : i do n't show emotion . 
  good , bad , whatever . 
  i 'm always the same - not blank , just kind of laid back . 
  you sound exactly like me . 
  maybe i 'm not that special ? 
  why ? 
  the mlp fandom is pretty harmless . 
  kind of weird , but harmless . 
  whereas we ruin conventions and crush newgrounds beneath our heels . 
  where 'd all this angst come from ? 
  ca n't we keep this civil ? 
  this is n't youtube . 
  either vista , or 7 , judging from the way the explorer icon looks . 
  he just has it set to a classic theme . 
  my favorite performance was wilhelm kempf 's . 
  ( it 's available in the itunes store . ), 
  / r/doctorwho ? 
  look at my tardis mug !, 
  look at my tardis dog leash !, 
  look at my tardis toilet seat !, 
  my tardis tampons !, 
  reported . 
  the plural of lusus is lusus . 
  it 's a fourth declension noun , which are declined - us , - \u016bs in the nominative . 
  ahahaha , you should know that intuitively !, 
  adults r just kids wiff money am i rite ???? 
  lol xd xd xd, 
  im getting really tired of this, 
  hahahahahahahahahahaha . 
  your comment is very misinterpretable ... 
   by her account they 're a bunch of dirty nogoodniks who use rented living spaces as stables and teach their barefooted children pee on shop floors to distract the employees so that they can steal merchandise, 
  this is the mindset of my entire nation , hungary . 
  some other things that people like to claim is that they break all of the housing ( windows , copper pipes , etc. ), 
  and melt them down and sell it . 
  and once , we sent them over to france , and they sent them back because even they did n't want to put up with them !, 
  they 're a bunch of uneducated know-nothings who steal tax money !, 
  they 're * literally hitler * !, 
  he 's quoting nukethepope , at a guess . 
   but then , he also wears glasses and we all know who wears the shades in homestuck . 
  dude , about every other character in homestuck has eyewear . 
  at a wild guess , jeff fits sollux the most . 
   2 days, 
  what are you a prodigy or something, 
  it 's not a secret flash , just a secret part of a flash . 
  and it 's not exactly * secret * , either . 
  the first four axioms seem to be saying the same thing . 
  ( it would do no good to restate it a fifth way . ), 
   though i have noticed that a lot of people below the poverty line are obese , and a lot of people above the poverty line are skinny . 
  that probably has more to do with societal values though . 
  this is because unhealthy foods are cheaper than healthy foods , and nothing more . 
  is anyone else somewhat bothered by mr. neely 's comments ? 
  i 'm a bit too tired to nitpick right now , but i think his main problem is differentiating between cause and effect . 
   class warfare at its best ... the top 95 % , income wise , pays most of the taxes ... look at the education statistic ... that tells the story in my mind ... those who are educated make many times more than those who are n't ... it is how a capitalistic society works ... if i make a `` c '' on a test in school , and someone else makes an `` a '' , we do n't average to two and give both a `` b '' ... this is a merit based society ... if you are n't happy with where you are finically , go back to school ... i make a lot of money , but i went to school for 10 years ... you ca n't do things the non-conventional way , and still reap the benefits that those of us who invested in ourselves early on enjoy . 
  do the poor spend a greater percentage on necessities ... yes , of course . 
  we all have a minimum amount that we have to make to get by ... it is interesting that this does n't change that much from poor to `` rich '' ... the rich just have more left over at the end , so they get to save or invest it ... does n't make them hogs , just makes them the smart and down to earth wealthy people that i know ... i 'm sure this comment will not be popular , but , sometimes the truth hurts a little, 
  he also congratulates himself on being rich . 
  i kind of hate internet-dwellers ' habit of pretending to make six figures and then proceeding to be condescending because of this imagined attribute . 
   while 150,000 may be rich to some , its a pittance for those of us who own a business and employ many employees ... thats right ... its job creation that helps the economy , and how can we create new positions with excessive taxation ... jobs , the golden egg for the downtrodden ... they come from us `` rich '' dudes ... 
  but we are here to talk about economics , not complain about people . 
  i was going to comment , '' [ who were you expecting , the thooth fairy ] ( / dunkass ) '' , but this is simply too amazing for that . 
  ( the related link is [ this ] ( http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/fst?before=1343577793 ) . 
  it has nothing to do with the sbahj comic . ), 
  i do n't mean that target is cheap and unhealthy . 
  i mean that potato chips are cheap and unhealthy . 
  the location is somewhere on the wiki ... , . . 
  i have tried , in this order , `` wall '' , `` punched wall '' , `` broken wall '' , and `` exploding wall '' . 
  next up , `` exploded wall '' and `` blown up wall '' . 
  edit : i tried `` wall explosion '' after that . 
  but do you know what yielded the best results thereafter ? 
  `` wall : break . '', 
  that 's the one that i found in `` wall : break . 
  '' , too . 
  i found homestar runner at 35 pages . 
  close enough . 
  one of the characters used `` lusii '' . 
  characters make mistakes . 
  even ( in fact , especially ) when that character is andrew hussie . 
  \\* sigh *, 
  ( i 'll do it for you : * `` girl look at that body ... '' * ), 
  great cosplay , but why are n't the legs painted [ greay ] ( / dunkass ) as well ? 
  some things , i can live without . 
  if you frequent *** the *** wiki ( yes that one ) , then it 's reasonable to assume that you know of it . 
  it 's neither worse nor better than where i come from . 
  but this is just at a glance . 
  edit : actually , one thing i like is that gas is cheap . 
  it 's page 11 . 
  if you search for `` exploding wall '' , you get an exploding ball , an exploding well , an exploding dog , an exploding walnut , the atari game `` exploding wall '' , and davexjade . 
  nyc , princeton , tuscon , san francisco . 
  if you count flight connections ( which you should n't ) , houston . 
  one of the places i stayed was princeton , and i have a friend who lives just north of it ( hence why i stayed there in the first place ) . 
  i did n't see anything wrong with new jersey , and my friend does n't complain either . 
  what 's wrong with new jersey ? 
  wait , which one ? 
  `` i 'd lather you did n't rinse all the humor from this thread '' ? 
  ow , my eyes ... 
  but why is its gdp so high ? 
  what does it produce ?
