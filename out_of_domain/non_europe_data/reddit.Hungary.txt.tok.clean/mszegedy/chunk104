  i never said the post that i pasted was bad . 
  i was actually endorsing it for explaining all of the anti-american prejudice really well . 
  sorry for all the hate !, 
  you 're the most informative commenter here , i think ... here 's a genuine rebuttal posted by someone else somewhere else :, 
  & gt ; a public education system that continually lacks behind the rest of the developed world, 
  this is ridiculous . 
  some of the best public universities in the world are in the u.s. , and as a whole the u.s. dominates the list of top research universities . 
  ** editor 's note : this is a dumb argument , since you were obviously talking about k-12 . 
  & gt ; ailing and failing infrastructure, 
  what ? 
  this is no more a problem in most of the u.s. than it is in europe or anywhere else . 
  if they want to see failing infrastructure they should check out some of the former soviet territories . 
  & gt ; the war on whistleblowers, 
  dae julian assange ? 
  & gt ; the ever expanding surveillance state, 
  is reddit seriously trying to say that the state is more intrusive here in the u.s. than in europe ? 
  because if so then wolololololololololol, 
  & gt ; sopa acta ttp and all the cyber security bills to follow, 
  the same as in europe . 
  & gt ; endless wars, 
  thank europe for a lot of these . 
  & gt ; the war on drugs, 
  & gt ; ( the war on drugs , the war on terror , war on whistleblowers , drone strikes to name a few ), 
  til republicans . 
  i wanted to , but :, 
  i could n't bring myself to lie, 
  i could n't think of a believable title, 
  hey , me too !, 
  join the dyslexia club !, 
  i 've always figured that * having done it * before going out and doing something important is better , because of the norepinephrines that sort of `` put you in your right mind '' . 
  haha , kids these days if they see one will probably do something stupid with it like leave it on too long and then touch the screen and get shocked . 
  dae 90s kids are smart ? 
  edit : also , curious , what default subreddit do you have ? 
  i have / r/truegaming , but that 's * it * . 
  i do n't even subscribe to / r/science ( instead , i subscribe to scientific subreddits on a topic/area by topic/area basis , as well as / r/scientific , / r/scholar , / r/hardscience , and so forth ) . 
  dude , i 'm going to make your orangered orangered for no fucking reason at all ; have a nice day, 
  is it from newegg ? 
  personally i think this comment deserves to be downvoted much more than your other one, 
  so brave, 
  just as anticipable . 
  the thing with the crossing lights abounds elsewhere , too . 
  it 's definitely not a thing in my country !, 
  it does n't . 
  ( as far as i remember . 
  only the biggest city has pedestrian lights , and my luck is that i live in only the * second * biggest city . ), 
  what was it previously ? 
  osha or what ? 
  as someone who 's studied japanese culture to great lengths , and lived there for an extended period of time , and thought it would be nice to move there , especially to research there , i hope to le sagan ron degrasse le paul neil carl le tyson that this does n't become an actual jerk . 
  i mean holy fuck . 
  i really , # # really # # hope that this is just a one-time thing . 
   aboot ( lol ), 
  what are we srs or something, 
  good argument , but , say it with me :, 
  ( your misspelling was consistent , so i thought i 'd take the opportunity to correct you ! ), 
  they 're in all sessions now . 
  where do you live ? 
  the most vocal pedestrian lights i have seen were in singapore . 
  man , that place had transportation * down * . 
  i swear , i could get anywhere with one magic card ... or even just walking ... dae singapore the next sweden ? 
  what does `` ameriborn '' mean ? 
  where does the word come from ? 
  relevant username is relevanthappy cake day, 
  wait , are you being sarcastic ? 
  i ca n't tell whether to upvote or downvote you . 
  the strawman is strong with this one . 
  psst , your links ... you 're supposed to put the first part , the text , in square brackets , and then the second part , the address in parentheses ... 
  / r/truegaming * has * gone downhill , but not very much . 
  it 's still worthy of being one of the two games-related subreddits i subscribe to , next to / r/ludology . 
  but specifically , `` why do n't they read ndt [ instead of being a fan of jb or kk ] ? '', 
  who 's actually said that ? 
  but they do n't want to discuss it . 
  just go , `` dae this ???????? '', 
  i used to play a game on a console , upvote me, 
  i mean specifically ndt . 
  i know that `` lol why not science , if you know pop culture your dumb '' is a widespread thing here ( and by `` here '' i mean / r/atheism ) . 
  i just object to the person i replied to having used ndt as an example . 
  ah , i 've visited new zealand !, 
  stayed there for two weeks , too , in various places like wellington and rotorua . 
  ( it was the only time i 've ever rented a camper van . ), 
  it 's funny because my next stop was australia , and we met a nice australian family there who later provided me shelter when all the hotels in sydney were overbooked ( because the queen was visiting or something ) . 
  / tangent anyway , i totally loved that place . 
  it 's one of the few places i would n't mind moving to ( along with switzerland , singapore , japan , germany , and not much anywhere else ) . 
   i 'm female , young, 
  better . 
  hit the facebook , gym up , delete the lawyer !, 
  i read it before you . 
  i was contemplating putting it on reddit for nearly an entire week . 
  it 's just that i 'm on a phone , so it 's sort of really painful . 
  but who cares who posted it !, 
  the link karma is meaningless , and nobody will remember * me * for posting it . 
  no one would have remembered * you * , either !, 
  if you 're worried about a `` personal identity '' , then i 'm afraid that that 's not applicable on reddit !, 
  ( except if you 're * really * famous , like being a mod ( like / u/hiddenkrypt ) , or showing up pretty much everywhere ( like / u/trapped _ in_reddit , / u/karmanaut , / u/se7en _ sinner , or lately / u/apostolate ) , or both ( like / u/andrewsmith1986 ) . ), 
  chemically , it 's pure carbon . 
  but there 's probably an atom or two of something highly radioactive in there . 
  as have you . 
  god , why is there suffering ? 
  even from natural disasters ? 
  duh , god is black .
