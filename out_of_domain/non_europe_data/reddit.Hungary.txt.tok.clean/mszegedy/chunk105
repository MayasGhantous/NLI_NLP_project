  nope . 
  not a chance !, 
  ( disclaimer : i 'm not god ), 
  look at all those sticky notes they 're wasting . 
  this * has * to be illegal . 
  ` k , i 'll post it there then !, 
  we do n't want to be the same thing as 4chan . 
  let me correct you :, 
  edit : he was in the far negatives when this comment was made . 
  that is all . 
   that 's if you do n't get beaten up by the mods for putting another damn [ meta ] flag on a post . 
  i hear they turn unsuspecting redditors into pinatas for that . 
  shit . 
  where do i complain at you guys , then ? 
  i think it already has . 
  alas , my question !, 
  but what does it mean [ 13 ], 
  do i have a clone running around somewhere ? 
  have you met him ? 
  that 'd be awesome !, 
  good plot , terrible , just terrible , science . 
  i reccommend it . 
  '' * ed * '' is old english / \u00c6nglisc for `` to '' !, 
  as in the preposition !, 
  i feel like a fucking idiot for not having noticed this before . 
  cal to scratch !, 
  li'l cal becomes doc scratch !, 
   plot-centric item, 
  usually specifically one that 's coveted . 
  [ now the only question there is to ask , , is why ? 
   have n't seen it mentioned it around, 
  because it was too obvious to point out further than the update in which it appeared , five and a half weeks ago . 
  or even just call people stoners . 
  extra points for insulting them for smoking , pointing out various ill effects of marijuana , and negatively generalizing about the population of the subreddit . 
  i see what you 're saying , and it 's a good argument , but , at least where i live when i live in the u.s. , in new jersey , saying `` comrade '' does n't automatically evoke mental images of stalinist russia . 
  people still use it sometimes !, 
  and they do n't elicit dirty looks , either . 
  the association is far from tangible . 
  but your point is still invalid . 
  edit : oh , never mind . 
  i see it . 
  you have skill , certainly , but i would have appreciated a more loose interpretation of it , rather than just copying down the top and bottom parts of the panel ( eheheh look at how squashed that volcano is in the middle ) . 
  guys hussie invented gravity, 
  not enthusiastic enough . 
  do it like this :, 
  prefix the line you want to emphasize with a hash sign . 
  one hash : ( ` #hussiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee ` ), 
  two hashes : ( ` ## hussiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee ` ), 
  three hashes : ( ` ### hussiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee ` ), 
  four hashes : ( ` #### hussiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee ` ), 
  it stops there . 
  you can also do this by doing something with = signs and hyphens in the line below , but it offers less control , and i do n't know much about it anyway . 
   asking for payment on the day of the wedding is severely insensitive , even uncouth . 
  just do n't do it . 
  you will get a check in the mail eventually by the year 2016 . 
  ouch !, 
  right in the truth !, 
   25 points if you win a game of draw something . 
  something tells me that this is n't completely made up . 
  i 'm imagining one particular infamous incident ... 
  dwarves . 
  dwarrow . 
  it menaces with spikes of bread . 
  i did mean the mspa wiki . 
  and having read all the character pages and maybe clicked on a few links is perfectly reasonable to assume . 
  i think i found that particular page after i first got told about trickster mode a few months ago ( despite having followed homestuck since its inception , i have been somewhat immune to all social media surrounding it until recently , especially the forums ) , and clicked on the article for the earthbound easter egg in the related links . 
  i mean, 
  ** [ come ] ( / dunkass ) **, 
  ### [ on ] ( / dunkass ), 
  why the monty python statistic ? 
  it always turned out to be 0 . 
  much more useful would have been statistics for the mentions of certain people : mitt romney ( / r/politics ) , gabe newell ( / r/gaming ) , neil degrasse tyson ( / r/atheism ) , nikola tesla ( reddit in general ) . 
  those would have been interesting . 
  ( not that i have anything against the monty python statistic . 
  it 's vestigial . 
  languages that :, 
  - have a lot of different phonemes with many different placements , but few different kinds of voicing and formation, 
  - have little tonality or syllable stress, 
  though , if you 're both very * logical * in your arguments ( that is , you both have ~ ~ sound ~ ~ valid arguments ) , then the deciding point can indeed be which argument is based on more accurate information ( that is , which argument is ~ ~ valid ~ ~ sound ) . 
  edit : yeah , i always mix the two up . 
  i do n't listen to bartok much , but my first language is hungarian . 
  does the `` sz . '', 
  ( i love your playing , by the way ; you are up there at the point that i ca n't actually tell you apart from anyone above your skill level ), 
   stop being condescending for a moment , seriously . 
  aw , no , what did i ever do to give you that impression ? 
  d : i 'd never think i 'm better than anyone who i 'm conversing with !, 
  i 'm sorry if my speech came off that way . 
  you might be reading too much into the internet-words !, 
  if it looks like a slight , it 's definitely only a joke . 
  maybe the bold and italics on `` the '' might have clinched it , but i 'd never interpret that sort of comment in such a way !, 
  trust me , i sincerely believe that i 'm inferior to all of you . 
  ( except those racists in / r/videos , and those nuts over in / r/anarchy and / r/communism . 
  and the sexists in / r/mensrights , and the people who act like they 're entitled in / r/politics and the people who act condescending in / r/atheism . 
  but even so , i still respect all those people , despite how i might think that i have a superior worldview to them . ), 
  point is , i 'm not picking any fights !, 
   first of all , [ this . 
  ] \\ ( http://xkcd.com/someurlicantrememberandimonaphone$, 
  urrgh , i do n't really like xkcd references , but point acknowledged , even previous to your comment . 
   second , i use the wiki almost exclusively to fact check against the character bios or pages related to sburb mechanics . 
  it 's easy to miss the trivia pages if you do n't wikiwalk .
