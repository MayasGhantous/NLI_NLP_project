  frequenting the wiki does n't automatically mean following the same link path you did . 
  i mean , you did n't even hear about trickster mode for the first 3 years of homestuck ; how is it surprising to you that people do n't always know trivia ? 
  sorry , but i do n't understand your point !, 
  are you saying that it 's unreasonable of me to expect any one person to know about it ? 
  come on , it ca n't be * that * obscure . 
  come to think of it , besides the wiki article , i might have accidentally stumbled upon it in-game , and forgotten . 
  ( i have severe memory loss sometimes . 
  i can never remember what i have done . ), 
  i do n't posit that the wiki ( yes * that * one , amirite ? 
  :p ( the smiley is to let you know i 'm not being serious ) ) is the only source to have learnt about it , either . 
  although i myself have only come upon the social media scene relatively recently , most people would be compelled to explore others besides reddit and the wiki , like the forums and tumblr and so forth . 
  i do admit , though , that this argument is n't a very good one , because the forums and tumblr and facebook et cetera only focus on the current update , generally , when discussing plot . 
  so , the people who [ s ] entered the homestuck fandom after that point are , to be honest , disadvantaged by a lot . 
  whether it 's actually reasonable to assume , though , we can solve using math and statistics . 
  ( i assume you like those , since you read xkcd . ), 
  ** shit , this seems a bit too involved and obvious . 
  skip to the red text if you want to avoid me going around in pointless mathematical circles . 
  i swear , it 's just a tenth grade math lesson . 
  also , i was totally sleepy when i wrote this . 
  just skip it . 
  ** let f ( t ) = p be a function wherein t is a time , and p is the population of the homestuck fandom at that time . 
  this would make df/dt be the function with the property that the integral of the whole thing is the population of the homestuck fandom , so we can take integrals of specific parts to see how many fans accumulated over those leriods of time . 
  let b be the t at which the flash occurred that made that reference . 
  what we want to know is whether the integral of df/dt from minus infinity to b is greater or smaller than the integral from b to infinity ( assume the function drops to zero after it passes the exact point in time when we are ) . 
  to compute integrals , you just have to subtract the values of the function that the function is a derivative of at the two ends of the integral from each other . 
  luckily we already have that function . 
  [ so all you really need to do is subtract the current population of the fandom from the population of the fandom when the flash was released , and compare it to the latter number . 
  i swear , a fourth grader could have told you this . 
  i am nothing but smart . 
  ] ( / tg ) jesus christ i kind of hate myself . 
  ah well , liking ( really basic ) calculus is n't a sin . 
   and note : references rely on familiarity with the work being referenced . 
  lots of people never played earthbound and many have never heard of it . 
  homestuck makes only subtle or otherwise hidden references to earthbound ( title aside ) so it 's not like people notice that they 're missing anything and go to look it up . 
  also very true . 
  adds another variable . 
  although , i 've never played earthbound ( i know , right ? 
  i totally should ) and i still understood the reference , because i have picked it up from pop culture ( i think the first time i was introduced to it was super smash bros. ) . 
  so in reality it 's a far wider range of people that you can expect to at least have understood the reference than just those who have played it ( not a small number of people by itself , either ) . 
  sorry for rambling . 
  :( i have no enmity for you , or anyone !, 
  really !, 
  i was just pointing out that it 's not the best-kept secret in homestuck . 
  ( i am too asleep right now to take a stab at what * is * . ), 
   philosopher, 
  no , propositional logic !, 
  but anyway , then you 're right and i dun goofed . 
  should be backwards . 
  i just could n't think of anything more closely related . 
  and interstellar mass transfer !, 
  ( this fits better ), 
   perhaps i should have a list of proper nouns to look for . 
  it 's not that simple , though , as i 'm sure you know . 
  neil degrass tyson is also commonly referred to as ndt and ndgt , gabe newell is usually called gaben or gabe , and mitt romney is usually only referred to by his surname . 
  what the * fuck * ? 
  i need to visit wherever this is , right now . 
  ( fan publicity project of epic proportions ? 
  photoshop ? ), 
  edit : are * all * of these shooped ? 
  tl ; dr : description , not prescription . 
  he was n't trying to educate you . 
  he was agreeing with you and affirming your statement . 
  rephrasing the obvious , so to speak . 
   also , the little piece of music at the very end was from savior of the waking world , which played when john got his tiger . 
  a remixed version played when jade got her tiger , so it can be said that this music is associated with god tier . 
  this seems to support the idea that caliborn/english reached god tier during or soon after the flash , although i 'm not convinced he was n't already god tier . 
  not exactly . 
  the music is the theme `` doctor '' , by george buzinkai , and is heavily associated with john . 
  the first time it played was when he first walked upon the surface of lowas , at the beginning of act 4 . 
  it 's been remixed to death , and almost all of the remixes have to do with john . 
  here 's an incomplete list of remixes of it :, 
  - [ `` doctor '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-2 ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` savior of the waking world '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/savior-of-the-waking-world ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` planet healer '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/planet-healer ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` land of the salamanders '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/land-of-the-salamanders ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` medical emergency '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/medical-emergency ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` plague doctor '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/plague-doctor ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` doctor remix '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-remix ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` heir transparent '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/heir-transparent ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` phrenic fever '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/phrenic-phever ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` heir conditioning '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/heir-conditioning ) , from strife ( i stand by my selection of this one ; the actual melody is n't present , but the counterpoint is obvious ), 
  - [ `` savior of the dreaming dead '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/savior-of-the-dreaming-dead ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` prospit dreamers '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/prospit-dreamers ) , from prospit & derse, 
  - [ `` cascade '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/cascade ) , from homestuck vol . 
  8 ( cascade , you are a doctor remix . 
  how do you feel ? ), 
  - [ `` green ghost '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/green-ghost ) , from colours and mayhem : universe b, 
  - [ `` do the windy thing '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/do-the-windy-thing ) , from colours and mayhem : universe b, 
  - [ `` miasmajesty '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/miasmajesty ) , from homestuck vol . 
  9 ( no , really ), 
  meenah 's question about whether she can die again seems so sad now . 
   the ending of descend, 
  primarily , it 's the beginning of umbral ultimatum . 
  in fact , i think if you go look at the bandcamp , i do n't think that last part is even in the track . 
  it was meant to be foreshadowing [ s ] jade : enter . 
  like a true homestuck fan . 
  i wish i had the time and ability to make fanart . 
  ( also the materials , but that 's slightly more fixable ), 
  i thought his was a second-level comment . 
  this has been known for like forever .
