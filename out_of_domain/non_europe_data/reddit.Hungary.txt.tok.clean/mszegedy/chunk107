  what 's the name of the team ? 
  ( do they have timelapse videos ? 
  how did you find this thread ? ), 
  the hilarious thing is that this shows up on / r/atheismbot . 
  i made a `` fixed '' of it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xqlmt/does_anyone_else_feel_that_this_is_the_case_with/ ) . 
  that big red circle was just too much of a [ reference ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007161 ) to pass up . 
  no , social rebellion and the chance to feel superior to theists . 
  * [ it ] ( / ga ), 
  edit : [ huh . 
  ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005211 ) did i get the impression from how it 's misquoted here ? 
  whoops . 
  well , i still like my version better . 
  there 's even more where that came from . 
  also , the clockwork theme has a similar number of remixes :, 
  - [ `` endless climb '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/endless-climb-2 ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` clockwork melody '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/clockwork-melody ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` clockwork sorrow '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/clockwork-sorrow ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` clockwork contrivance '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/clockwork-contrivance ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` vertical motion '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/vertical-motion ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` enlightenment '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/enlightenment ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` earthsea borealis '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/earthsea-borealis ) , from homestuck vol . 
  - [ `` rustless fall '' ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/rustless-fall ) , from colours and mayhem : universe b, 
  this list is even more incomplete than the doctor list , and if you know anything i left out , i 'd appreciate it if you made me aware of it . 
  in fact , the sburban theme might even beat this , but my list for that just got deleted earlier today , so it 'll take me some time to recompile that . 
  he was talking about the curtain colors , not the sburb symbol colors . 
  the curtain colors are always the color of the sburb symbol of the scratch-inverse session of the session currently in the act . 
  for example , the pre-scratch kids session had a green sburb symbol , but red curtains , whereas the post-scratch kids session has a red sburb symbol , but green curtains . 
  it makes me excited for act 7 , which will feature white curtains . 
  they were n't invited because they 're * asia minor * . 
  ( well , okay , no , that 's a narrow understanding of it that i do n't want to look like i have , but still . 
  they 're kind of removed from us . ), 
  [ guys we should n't trust the media ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xptjd/this_is_the_result_of_glorifying_religious/ ), 
  what does this have to do with atheism ? 
  the person to whom you 're replying is an atheist . 
  they 're blown away because they 're horrified at the picture . 
   poltroonic, 
  guys , i made up a word !, 
  and i feel smart for it too , because surely no one will know what `` poltroon '' means . 
  i need to * seem * smart , because i ca n't seem smart just by making a good argument , or having helpful things to add because i am knowledgeable . 
   have a wonderful day . 
  i ca n't find anything substantial to end my post with , so instead i will make ironically rude remarks !, 
  ( i , mszegedy , am impartial to the actual issue discussed in your post , so i 'd prefer not to debate it . 
  nor do i therefore want to appear that i am defending / u/mrspiffy12 . 
  i just think that certain parts of your posts are very immature , and i 'm only ** brave ** enough to criticize the easiest-to-criticize parts of it . ), 
  do n't forget * obtuse * . 
  no , i mean i do n't know why he put it there . 
   but you feel so defeated in this discourse ( go check to see if i used that correctly ) that you just ca n't let it go . 
  i do n't know what this sentence means . 
  when did you defeat me in any sort of discourse ? 
   i already fixed that one ( see above ) , and admitted my mistake . 
  that 's not my point . 
  my point is that you need to use obscure words to appear intellectually competent . 
  though it did n't help that it was n't a word , either . 
  no , you 're not listening . 
  you said :, 
   ( though i do n't know why you placed rhetoric , futile , and plethora in there ), 
  i was adding * obtuse * to your list . 
  because i do n't know why he listed it , either . 
   i 'm completely open to any argument that i use words incorrectly , but have n't given me any examples . 
  do n't worry , you do n't . 
  you do know the meanings of the words you type . 
   i really am terribly sorry you feel this way . 
  thanks . 
  i appreciate the empathy . 
   i have a degree in ist and a degree in philosophy . 
  i 've been to school for quite some time . 
  cool . 
  the latter is n't very well-respected on this website , which i think is a shame . 
   i 'm sorry that these words intimidate you ,, 
  no , they do n't . 
  i just do n't like that you are using them without good reason to do so . 
   but i need to use the english language in order to express myself in writing . 
  the english language abounds with less obscure words that would * not * evoke the connotation of having used them to appear intelligent . 
  how many synonyms for `` poltroonish '' can you think of ? 
  there 's an unusually large amount of them . 
  if you 're not using obscure words because you want to articulate yourself precisely in contrast to very similar words with slightly different meanings ( `` poltroonish '' does n't mean the exact same thing as `` stupid '' , obviously , so if it were employed as contrast to it , then it would be acceptable , or if none of its synonyms were close enough to the meaning that you desired to convey and that 's why you used it , that would be acceptable as well ) , or because you want to avoid reusing the same word ( if you had exhausted most other synonyms of `` poltroonish '' before using it , then it would also have been acceptable ) . 
  but here it serves no purpose other than to illustrate your intellect , which no one appreciates . 
  so is obtuse ( and , in fact , futile ) , which is why i said that it should be on your list of words that you do n't know why he listed . 
   again , i 'm sorry you feel this way . 
  less used words are a pay-it-forward for me . 
  if someone uses a word that i do n't know i always ask them what it means or look it up . 
  this increases my vocabulary and allows me to better express myself . 
  likewise , when people see a word they are not familiar it would be in their best interest to educate themselves . 
  it 's not like i 'm using kanji or ge'ez script ; i 'm using english . 
  sorry , you gave off a different impression . 
  i have no quarrel with you , then !, 
  ( by the way , are you doing the same thing with languages by mentioning japanese and ge'ez ? 
  because this can give off the exact same sort of impression . 
  i had to remind myself not to be angry about the ~ ~ difficulty of interpretation ~ ~ i mean general relative obscurity of these examples . 
  you 're only trying to widen my horizons , which i appreciate ! ), 
   you make it sound like this is a bad thing , that we should all stay superficial and only use mundane words . 
  maybe i do ... but i have nothing against using obscure words per se , only advertising one 's knowledge by doing so . 
  i think it 's fine to use them in other contexts . 
   it 's quite the paradox that you chastise `` contemporary education , '' yet it 's the only education once could receive . 
  i never said anything about that !, 
  maybe you 're confusing me with someone else ? 
  these words have never been uttered before . 
  but then you can do reverse-frog breeding with it . 
  but then you can do reverse-breeding with it . 
  plan for it to be goo , and appearify it after that .
