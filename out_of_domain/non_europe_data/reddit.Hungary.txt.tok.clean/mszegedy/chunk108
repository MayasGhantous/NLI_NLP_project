  i.e. , plan to appearify it after you appearify it . 
  ( it 's the same as planning to catch it , but you 're catching it with the appearifier . ),

  [ too late ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xptjd/this_is_the_result_of_glorifying_religious/c5ok46z ), 
  i do n't know whether your comment is parody , so i do n't know how to vote on it ... 
  thanks for owning up . 
  he mentions it in his post , briefly . 
   ( do n't even get me started on rugby or australian football ), 
  ( also , since you are a loud person , may i introduce you to / r/karkat . 
  it 's a place to act like everyone 's the same person , and insult each other in all caps . ), 
  loads and loads and loads and loads of cases , ripped straight off of wikipedia . 
  i find this slightly offensive because i speak hungarian , which has like 16 or something . 
  oh my god you guys are still at it . 
  someone stop it . 
  aww , shit , son !, 
  now i 'm all converted 'n' shit to atheism !, 
  ( not . ), 
  i object to you having misspelled my name in the top post . 
  copy the text between the brackets : [ mszegedy ] . 
  looooooooooooololol discoard ( i prefer the [ living tombstone remix ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw_cpvmjy9u ) ), 
  nice , but not very relevant . 
  also why the [ s ] ? 
  no audio data . 
  the curiosity rover has descended on mars !, 
  ( but it sadly has nothing to do with homestuck . ), 
  i 'm sorry but i think you 've got the wrong person . 
  ahhh this is the * [ second ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/v2qid/homestuck_pickup_lines/c50t3yl ) * time on / r/homestuck when i 've helped out a person and they deleted their comment !, 
  whyyy, 
  his godtier is dr. manhattan ? 
  yeah , but your artifact grist needs to be negative in order for you to make something with it . 
  this was proved on christmas eve not of last year , but the year before . 
  pfft . 
  i am making a list of all the melodies ever ( that is , all the pieces organized by melody ) . 
  keep an eye out for it !, 
  there 's already a pastebin for it , but it sort of self-destructed , so i do n't want to link you it just yet . 
  i feel you . 
  my art skills are better than caliborn , but worse than karkat . 
  but i 'm really good at image manipulation , however . 
  i still want to learn to draw , though . 
  huh . 
  i 've always referred to propositional calculus ( and quantitative reasoning ) as a field of math . 
  good to know !, 
  gamzee may not have , if he is n't actually godtier . 
  it 's a long shot , though . 
  ( and we 're not certain that caliborn has ever died . 
  he could be godtier as le , but he could not be . 
  le probably was n't killed in his attack , either . ), 
  and all of the jack noirs . 
  ( but especially spades slick . ), 
  well , i 'm not sure it counts when whats-his-name pulled his pin on the doll . 
  he never really `` died '' . 
  it 's just that there 's a universe where he does n't exist . 
  oh , you 're right . 
  maybe that was n't an actual timeline , though , and instead an imagined possibility ? 
  sorry , this idea 's already been run into the ground . 
  i 've always supported it though , because caliborn refers to the female characters as nothing but [ the bitches ] ( / uu ) . 
  no , it has n't run * aground * . 
  it 's been run * into the * ground . 
  oh , that 's not what i meant by `` run into the ground '' . 
  i meant `` discussed to death '' . 
  it 's an old theory that originated on the day that the cherubs ' nature was revealed . 
  [ promised and delivered !, 
  i 'll have to reorganize it , though , because if i try to add anything it 'll give me a `` too many characters '' error .

  it ... it looks like a pumpkin . 
  thanks !, 
  i think the sequence of dissension pieces is a good metaphor for homestuck in general . 
  by the way , happy cake day . 
  no , he was just offscreen . 
  i 'd appreciate contributions , though !, 
  and you might be disappointed by some entries . 
  there are some very loose matches in there !, 
  like , how is miasmajesty a doctor remix ? 
  that secret is confined within me .

  thankfully almost all the comments are calling it out . 
  i plan to list all the flashes as well , and add youtube playlists so that you can listen to all of them in a row . 
  i 've run out of space in these submissions , though , so i 'll need to put those in four or more brand new submissions .

  america !, 
  one of the artists even said it on their blog .

  but i got linked that particular post here on reddit !,

  i listed pipeorgankind ... but i 'll go check lifdoff .

  edit 2 : i bumped out lifdoff to put cascade under sburb . 
  sorry , but it was more of a definite fit !, 
  get that shit out of here right now .
