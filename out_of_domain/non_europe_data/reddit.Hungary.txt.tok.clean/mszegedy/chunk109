  damn ... 
  i could have saved so much work ... 
  edit : nope . 
  but there 's a helpful list of tracks not on bandcamp . 
  youtube away !, 
  i love how they expand in * water * . 
  does that mean that it 'll be wet when i use it ? 
  ( equius could just rub it against his skin ... ), 
  also , robots have skeletons . 
  no , hussie got him out of that . 
  that spades slick that hussie has is the same person . 
  he * does * die though in an alternate universe where quarters killed him . 
  in the alpha timeline , he got rescued by snowman , though , and then they embraced and kissed . 
  no , he climbed out in [ s ] dd : ascend more casually . 
  he 's with ms. 
  paint now . 
  thanks , got ta go check ... 
  edit : you 're right !, 
  and guess what it turns out the english theme and the homestuck theme are the same thing , holy shit huge revelation, 
  \\* head explode *, 
  what 's `` tbosre '' ? 
  edit : it 's `` the beginning of something really excellent '' . 
  what 's penumbral phantasm ? 
  sounds like it 's related to umbral ultimatum . 
  but problem sleuth is more injoke-based and less plot-driven . 
  homestuck is a better choice beacuse you have well-developed characters and a logical progression of events , less polluted by gags . 
  did this come from grant money ? 
  jesus h. dick . 
  that 's ... $ 17,040 precisely . 
  i could buy a car , or a really shitty living space with that money . 
  huh . 
  also , i love how , despite that this is a very over-the-top build , you picked the shittiest dvd player you could find . 
  some things never change . 
  you 'd have to combine it with google 's 1 gbps sol connection . 
  17,000 fps !, 
  one for each dollar . 
  too bad that at that point you 're limited by the screen . 
  ahaha i keep confusing ebonpyre and beatdown , i am so shitty at this . 
  gon na fix derse dreamers . 
  ( i had n't listened to it all the way through in a while , so i did n't know about the clockwork thing . ), 
  and if you say so about miasmajesty , i 'll remove it , since it 's honestly a terrible notion . 
  thanks !, 
  fuck , that 's not what i meant at all ... 
  but ... karkat 's subreddit has [ karkat 's number ] subscribers !, 
  it 's not * funny * , it 's ... [ complete this analogy : a joke is to funny as a coincidence is to ... ? 
  how does compressed washcloth end up being a preorder bonus to a game ? 
  i. . . never even thought about downvoting . 
  maybe i 'm just not that smart ? 
  10000 characters . 
  :( also , i love sun _____ , but i was only aware that it was in sunsetter and sunslammer . 
  so on the list it goes , when i get out the next iteration !, 
  shut up , i knew i 'd get a comment like that . 
  :d what i meant was that everything has a cause , as opposed to problem sleuth being just a collusion of things that [ hapen ] ( / dunkass ) out of nowhere . 
  seems like it . 
  but this means that it 's been unreleased for like forever . 
  years . 
  yeah , i know that !, 
  it 's just really funny . 
  the one advantage to cds , though , is that they 're r [ eeeeeeeeaaaaaaaa ] \\ ( / ag ) lly cheap . 
  for example , i have a friend who works as a diving photographer in the netherlands , on the caribbean . 
  ( they have a few islands there . ), 
  when she sells the pictures she 's taken , she sells them on cd , because a usb drive or a shitty sd card would double the price . 
  what she * could * do is upload it to a server , and give the recipients a super-secret download link on a piece of paper or something , but since they 're not receiving it directly and immediately , they 're more likely to lose it/forget about it/whatever . 
  so , 40 cents cds are the way to go !, 
  they 're not exactly completely dead yet . 
   i sometimes confuse `` he '' and `` she '' ( tagalog 's 3rd person pronoun is gender neutral ) . 
  this is interesting , because i do n't do this ( almost never , anyway , not more than regular english speakers ) , despite hungarian also being completely gender-neutral . 
  my mother , however , * does . 
  * i wonder what makes this sort of thing vary from person to person like that ... 
  pretty good art , but the words are hard to read and it flows very poorly . 
  ( also , '' [ egg ] ( / cg ) '' ? ), 
  you sure ? 
  i just told you to shut up . 
  that 's the most insulting thing i 've ever said to anyone . 
  i 'd understand it if you were at least a little offended . 
  it fits , too , because jake thereafter ( eventually ) kissed dirk . 
  it appears to be the piece from which the theme from the last few seconds of descend and the first few seconds of jade : enter originate . 
  i 've always just thought that it was a rhythmically different take on doctor ; the notes are the same , just with different timings . 
  maybe it 's the piece found in null.mp3 ? 
  nope , netherlands antilles . 
  they have islands on the caribbean . 
  no , they have no relation . 
  null.mp3 is an eight-second snippet of a doctor remix . 
  i totally never noticed it in davesprite . 
  why did n't i notice it in davesprite ? 
  unbelievable . 
  ahh . 
  were n't they trying to get inducted ? 
  the antilles island in specific , bonaire , where my friend is , is not yet autonomous . 
  they are trying to turn themselves into a sort of diving hotspot - the place is covered in dive shops and dive resorts - but it 's not enough . 
  they still have to regularly pipe money in from holland , and they are singularly dependent on them for food shipments as well . 
  what they need is advertising , i think . 
  they 're not very well-known . 
  that 's why i like to go there ( but not why my friend lives there ) : the prices and accomodation are n't very tourist-oriented ( i.e. , high ) , despite almost all of their money coming from tourism . 
  it 's a steal , for an island on the caribbean . 
  but yeah , given this dependence , i can see why it 's not exactly its own country yet . 
   some if not most are probably just condescending comments . 
  but those people who do n't use reason readily really do think they are helping you with their magic prayer powers by liking a status on facebook .
