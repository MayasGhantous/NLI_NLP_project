  that high tonality and the abuse of approximants makes me want to cry ... as well as all those stupid american-sounding diphthongs . 
  but seriously , two reasons :, 
  teenagers think they 're deep when they say it ... 
  ... and then proceed to use it as an excuse to do stupid things . 
  and it sounds stupid . 
  just look at that godawful pronunciation : [ ` jo\u028a\u026bo\u028a ], 
  at least teenagers do n't like * carpe diem * because they ca n't understand it . 
  y is a vowel . 
  a comment from that thread : :, 
    `` i 'll tell you what you did with atheists for about 1500 years . 
  you outlawed them fr } om the universities , or any teaching careers , besmirched their reputations , banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind , drove them into exile , humiliated them , seized their properties , arrested them for blasphemy . 
  you dehumanized them with beatings and exquisite torture , gouged out their eyes , slit their tongues , stretched , crushed , or broke their limbs , tore off their breasts if they were a woman , crushed their scrotums of they were men , imprisoned them , stabbed them , disemboweled them , hung them , burnt them alive . 
  and you have the nerve to complain that i laugh at you .

  the only keyboard on which the curly bracket is even close to the letter r is the dvorak keyboard . 
  i 'll bet he feels so edgy and * nerdy * using it . 
  i will only upvote it if i * know * that it 's satire . 
  otherwise , i fucking hate exaggeration et cetera ... op , if he is actually complaining about america , is a complete baby . 
  ( also so brave and a fag . ), 
  or , alternatively and more accurately , everyone who says that that 's * typical * of america is * deluded * . 
  either way , this thread should feel bad for itself .

  this means that they * wanted * children .

  this is the part where someone makes a condescending comment about what a sheltered life you have led . 
  condescending prick on internet = / = condescending prick irl , though . 
  just check out my [ comment history ] ( / u/mszegedy ) . 
  i 'm incredibly condescending a lot of the time . 
  i have even been called out for it once . 
  but irl , i 'd never talk to anybody like that . 
  i think it 's the same way with a lot of these people . 
  although they appear to be a condescending prick here , they do n't necessarily act that way irl . 
  so your assumptions that that 's because they are discriminated against irl are n't solid . 
  ( more likely , they have a victim complex . 
  condescending again ! ),

  but these people generally intersect , for whatever reason . 
  we could go out of our way and do a proper study to prove/disprove it , but that would be a waste of time . 
  there are bigger things in the world than reddit . 
  one argument that i 've been given for using obscure words in the favor of common ones is that people will look them up and improve their vocabularies . 
  this is what i pretend every time someone does this , instead of interpreting it as a need to be seen as intelligent . 
  i do n't follow , either . 
  it might be equivalent to prototyping a kernelsprite and result in a black hole . 
  but that 's unlikely because the black hole comes from a very specific physical loophole , which is that when you prototype a kernelsprite , the original kernelsprite you prototyped is n't destroyed , so it keeps prototyping ad infinitum because the kernelsprites keep happening . 
  this would n't happen with a ring , though ; i assume they are destructible . 
  what might happen is that your kernelsprite would simply explode when you prototype it , or it would become a source of endless red miles . 
  what would happen to the queen would be similar - either the ring would explode on her finger ( taking off her arm , possibly ) or she would lose control of it and destroy all of her moon and maybe even the whole medium . 
  but i really do n't know .
