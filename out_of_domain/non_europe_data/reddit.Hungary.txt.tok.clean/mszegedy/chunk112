  [ this thing .

  no , it was practically the only thing anyone ever mentioned in the update thread . 
  what 's worthy of note about this one is that it 's the one cruxite artifact we 've seen that 's not completely unicolor . 
  `` provable '' is a word . 
  `` provably '' is also a word . 
  they mean `` able to be proved '' , except that the latter is an adverb . 
  that , too , but the kernel would move out of the way if you tried to prototype it with another kernel , too . 
  this is the unusual case that you are actually able to prototype it . 
  as one who is n't a native english speaker , i am in the dark on this . 
  what does it mean ? 
   the dave furthest along on the timeline is the `` alpha dave '' ,, 
  wrong , unless you are using a nonstandard definition of `` furthest '' and `` timeline '' . 
  alpha dave was less than a day along his timeline before doomed dave from the lifdoff timeline hit 4 months and decided to travel back . 
  but ... is it so hard to find original content ? 
  why ca n't we always have that ? 
  the argument of `` well , i have n't seen it before ... '' does n't hold up well either ; what 's the difference between one piece of oc and another piece of oc to someone who has seen neither ? 
  why ca n't it then be the piece of oc that is oc to more people ? 
  i put together a torrent for almostnever . 
  let me go look through the archives for it . 
  i 'll edit my post when i 've found it . 
  edit : https://www.dropbox.com/s/9xdb4n11f9hjqw7/homestuck.torrent . 
  i 'm totally torrenting it at this exact moment . 
  it 's also on almostnever 's comp , and probably a few other peoples ' too . 
  it 's great ; i watched all the flashes on the plane for like 8 hours a couple days ago . 
  the looks the flight attendants tried to not give me were hilarious . 
  or he could be 15 years old , like me . 
  ( he is twelve and so am i ), 
  edit : [ no , wait . 
  he self-posted to / r/ladyboners . 
  he looks about 20-something .

  edit 2 : no , wait , my fault . 
  somehow i mananged [ sic ] to mix this thread up with the facebook thread , because i edited this post from my profile and did n't double check what thread this was in . 
  i apologize for everything !, 
  pseudo-philosopher guy and facebook guy are n't the same people . 
  the waste of time . 
  no , wait , then he 'd type by bracketing [ ent ] and numbers . 
  oh , and [ le ] .

  i got 6 , 7 , and 9 wrong . 
  i ca n't believe 6 is an actual post ... and , well , i assumed that 9 had some sort of self-post text or a quote on an image or something . 
  \\ # 4 was actually an actual / r/atheism post .

  new canon : le is dead . 
  edit : also i love how even the clock hands are spades . 
  [ how do you expect to outrun him ... ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006011 ) [ when he 's already king ?!, 
  ( seriously , though , which dead king did you have in mind ? 
  none in particular ? ), 
  i 'm sure ; it was confirmed in the facebook thread before he deleted his account . 
  again , the platonic redditor ... ( notice : has cat , will whore for karma , and disregard submission rules ), 
   `` i have n't really changed my standards for what it means to actually be friends , '' he concluded . 
  `` it 's just that i use the word ` friends ' more loosely . '', 
  self-contradictory , much ? 
  next time we meet , i 'll shove you down a friendly flight of friendship stairs ... 
  nitpicking : `` does detract '' is acceptable grammar here . 
  the only thing he got wrong was the pair of comma splices , and even that 's dubious , considering that the preceding fragment in the first one can be viewed grammatically as functioning like an interjection , making it perfectly legal to connect it with a comma , if not more so than with a period . 
  but your actual point is still sound . 
  i thought that i was posting in another thread . 
  this is not the same as the facebook guy !, 
  how did i mix these two threads up ? 
  huh . 
  i 'm sorry for deceiving you !, 
  [ he 's not fat . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ladyboners/comments/uq1a5/i_was_told_to_post_here_theres_a_rule_for_no/ ) he does work at the ren fair though . 
  ( i will freely admit to having abbreviated it as such because i did n't want to think about how to spell `` renaissance '' - aha , see , i got it wrong there . 
  there 's only one n. ), 
  op is the most platonic example of a neckbeard . 
  it 's like , you know how there 's this weight in a palace in paris somewhere that is the ultimate and official reference for a kilogram ? 
  well , this guy 's the ultimate and official reference for a neckbeard . 
  he 's incredibly smug , and thinks he 's better than everyone he meets on the web because he bothers to use proper spelling and grammar ( but not proper typography , but that 's a nitpick ) . 
  he 's antitheist , and thinks that theists are intellectually inferior for being so . 
  he is a fan of carl sagan , and , i think , if you asked him , he would also feel the same way about neil degrasse tyson . 
  he likes to quote them out of context . 
  he thinks that he is incredibly sexy , and that women would be privileged to date him . 
  however , for reasons he can not fathom , he can not find a date . 
  this leads him to say that he follows a childfree philosophy , and rationalize that those who do n't are similarly intellectually inferior . 
  he has n't graduated college . 
  ( actually , atypically for a neckbeard , but all the more hilariously , he says that he decided that college was n't for him . ), 
  he is racist and sexist , but in fact he wants to feel and appear progressive , so he will defend them when he is not making fun of them . 
  he will also defend lgbt , but he probably wo n't make fun of it . 
  he works at the renaissance festival . 
  welp . 
  i 'm dead . 
  ( i own crocs and an iphone . ), 
  my greatest friend is dead . 
  ( dr. dre headphones ; i know what these are from him . 
  he produces music .
