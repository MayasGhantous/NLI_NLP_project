  iphone . ), 
  a large portion of my family is dead . 
  ( twilight . 
  oh , and iphone again . 
  in fact , crocs , too . ), 
  i have a friend who makes a living producing music , and he does it on a mac while wearing beats headphones . 
  it just comes from how these sorts of people tend to have neckbeards . 
  ( like , beards on the undersides of their heads . 
  it 's like pubic hair . 
  ewww . ), 
  from the page you linked :, 
   [ rose : that meteor however could have been propelled through a portal by any means , not just via the reckoning . 
  the temple meteor came to earth * despite * the absence of a reckoning . 
  but even without the quote , we already know that tidbit anyway ; for , how could dirk and roxy then have entered the temple in the veil , and come out of it on jake 's island ? 
  the temple must have gotten from the veil to earth in the meanwhile , somehow . 
  this has n't yet been revealed , but i do n't think it 's pretty important , maybe not even important to be explained . 
  i am prepared to eat my words if the way that it gets there is that le flings it at skaia or something ridiculous . 
  well , i did mention a way . 
  it 's just astoundingly unlikely . 
   jade could prototype herself . 
  i mean specifically post-scratch-her ashes . 
   also , time capsule and then prospit transportalizer . 
  okay , but the sprite itself would still have to be on prospit . 
  [ kernelsprites do n't ** doo ** that you chumpstick ] ( / dunkass ), 
  this works , but why would anyone want to appearify it ? 
   the b2 players all think they 're supposed to prototype dead bodies in order to resurrect their ( b2 ) guardians, 
  where was this explicitly stated ? 
  or alternatively , can you list me 2-3 overt hints ? 
  ( you probably also want to click [ the second half of the link ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006583 ) ; it 's a proper portrait of him ), 
  extra points if they 're in russian . 
  ( i 'm in a former soviet property , hungary . 
  any decently old score is written with the cyrillic alphabet . ), 
  wow . 
  pretty deadly ( excuse me , [ deudly ] ( / dunkass ) ) alchemy . 
  you mean casualties , or any deaths whatsoever ? 
  because bribery counts . 
  guys , [ sexism ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/y323l/pick_a_commercial_product_and_everyone_that_owns/c5rw9el ) :, 
   i bet you 90 % of people that make fun of twilight have n't see the movies or read the books . 
  they just karma whore, 
   edit : i myself have n't read the books , but i 'm sure to men they are horrible just because the target market is women . 
  their brains enjoy a different style ; one that is n't terribly logical and rational but descriptive of emotions . 
  so i can understand the hate on the books . 
  for the movies , i 'm solely talking about the first one . 
  i did n't find the first movie to be great by any means , but it is entertaining if you watch it with an open mind . 
  and that 's all a movie is supposed to be . 
  the movies beyond that are just to exploit the success of the first and make more money , just like nearly every other sequel . 
  just a few weeks or so . 
  ( a lot of time on reddit , though ), 
  what 's wrong with them ? 
  i checked their website , and they 're just t-shirts that have the word `` tapout '' on them with a really big and detailed logo . 
  or is there some sort of social connotation to wearing them ? 
  ( i 'm not from the u.s. ), 
  you 're taking us a little too seriously . 
  i 'm hungarian !, 
  i * dare * you to ask me about romanians . 
  etc. ), 
  further down : [ guys relant xkcd is relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y1qzt/new_rules_for_ratheism/c5rn5op ), 
  to be fair , five guys is awesome . 
  i eat there once or twice whenever i go to america . 
  ( i have never heard of in 'n' out . 
  east coast , i think . ), 
  but it 's true that logic and reason ( aka atheism amirite ) do n't apply in this thread very much . 
  [ about the downvoted comment  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/y3xp6/this_guy_really_loves_his_food_hilarious_review/c5s9vvh ) i 've never found their prices to be * so * ridiculously high , but maybe this is because i 'm used to paying the `` tourist price '' and the joint i visit is pretty new . 
  can someone remind me how much a regular burger costs ? 
  ( one thing i * will * complain about is that they never actually give me all of my toppings . 
  i can never taste the hot sauce , at least . ), 
  nonono , he decided college was n't for him . 
  ### brave level : so, 
  for future reference : dude 's name is / u/nemesai , although this does n't apply anymore because he deleted his account . 
  hussie said that this was just artistic style . 
  i 'm terrible at formspring/twitter/reddit , so i do n't know where he answered this . 
  but it came up way back when it first became clear that dead people have white eyes ( i think the bit with aradia that explained the codes ? 
  that 's what i figured . 
  i just did n't really understand it one way or another , though , since it 's already on their tumblr ... ? 
  i 'll delete this if that 's how it goes down , but i just wanted to know why op deleted it in the first place . 
  i know it 's not really any of my business , but i thought it might have been an accident or something that no one would have caught otherwise . 
  welp . 
  i do n't actually know anything about tumblr , so i had no idea that that 's possible . 
  okay . 
  i think i 'll remove the tumblr link for now , but leave the post up . 
  ( i could n't do anything through reddit , because the username was deleted from the post , and nobody ever commented . 
  i figured that a public thing was the only way to go , since i could n't contact op through personal means . ), 
  do n't hate . 
  he 's `` 16 in 11th grade '' . 
  ( i 'm not one to criticize , though . ), 
  but what hobby groups are people * passionate * about here ( and by `` here '' i mean / r/all or really just the defaults ; that is , general subreddits that are n't actually geared towards whatever hobby that he 's looking for ) ? 
  i 'd hardly count `` gaming '' as a hobby , if that 's what he 's getting at . 
  ( i 'm literally the only hungarian that i know that * is n't * totally racist about them . 
  i do n't like gypsies very much , though . 
  but at least i do n't go `` ermahgerd their runining the country '' . ),
