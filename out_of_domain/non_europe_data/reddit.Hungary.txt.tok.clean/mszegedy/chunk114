  cue suggestions of smug replies . 
  ( * we 're * also taking * you * too seriously . ), 
  no , there 's a couple of these comments on * every * / r/atheism post . 
  it 's , like , such a shitty sub , that the shittiness is * lossy * , but somehow still retains critical mass . 
  yes , it does , and it 's one of the closest languages there is to latin . 
  now repost it for karma, 
  well , you 're getting downvoted , are n't you ? 
  ( feel free to say `` whoosh '' at this point ), 
  allllllll the humans !!!!!!!, 
  yeah , but it 's a terrible argument . 
  science does n't work the same way orthography does . 
  [ science is exactly the same thing as english orthography !,

  [ literally this comment thread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y4654/because_creation/c5s8tkk ), 
  i will revoke my downvote if you say that you only made this up to troll people . 
   those qualitites of humans our race seems to forget about . 
  like science , i 'd like to think . 
  where were they during grades 1-12 ? 
  if in the usa , kindergarten too ? 
   my most upvoted comment ever was just me being captain obvious, 
  / u/knale , meet reddit . 
  / u/smugpieceofshit , are you an alt account of another redditor who does n't want to be associated with this sub ? 
  edit : okay , quit downvoting . 
  face it , `` smugpieceofshit '' is a totally perfect ironic name for a circlebroker . 
  why could n't i assume it in my question ? 
  i was thinking the less topical defaults , but most prominently / r/askreddit , where users are actually * obliged * to reveal shit about themselves like that . 
  but it applies even outside of there . 
  like , sure , no one in / r/pics asked about redditors ' musical preferences , but i can tell exactly whom they like just from browsing that particular subreddit . 
  redditors still leak things about themselves , because they want to build an identity ( although that 's kind of dumb given how big a website this is ; the only people i know on reddit to whom i ascribe identities to are most of the / r/homestuck browsers , / u/nukethepope ( god what an asshole ) , and / u/godofatheism ( but only because he does the megathreads ) ) .

  literally just ctrl-f ` ed this , was not disa [ le ] oint . 
   god-tier stage, 
  waste of time ? 
  wow , vriska through gamzee are totally indistinguishable from each other . 
  terezi is only so through the expense of being a weird turquoise green . 
  they look yummy though . 
  [ ] ( / sweetcatch ), 
  no but seriously , i missed that . 
  the last thing we need . 
  more daves . 
  i thought feferi thought gl ` bgolyb was talking about seadwellers vs. landdwellers , but it was really talking about trolls vs. humans . 
  nope . 
  not that i know of . 
  it 's just a rock . 
  yup . 
  yeah . 
  it 's not necessarily `` circlebroke material '' , but it 's very relevant to circlebroke . 
  we are here to discuss why reddit is bad . 
  op of the other thread discusses why reddit is good . 
  the interesting part is that all of his reasons contradict ours . 
  dae atheism = = = logic and reason ?? 
  or maybe op deleted his account . 
  possible ... no , wait , i ca n't find the link on the front page . 
  i am able to find a hilarious parody , though . 
  claw machine ? 
  write it in a ridiculously inefficient language . 
  make it completely isolating , and include useless things like noun class and evidentials . 
  unfortunately , i know of no less efficient language than our very own english . 
  at least for your part of computer science , when people assume that you program , you actually program . 
  it 's * hard * being a theoretical computer scientist ... :(, 
  that might bite them in the back if someone shows up with an actual rifle and is able to sneak it in because they painted an orange circle on it . 
  i could actually imagine this happening . 
  the comiccon 2013 massacre . 
  some insane person thought we were part of a satanic cult or something and needed to be destroyed . 
  it 's the perfect plan . 
  it 's ... 
  it 's ... 
  ### it 's ... 
  le midnight lol xd reddit secret club amirite ? 
  excuse me le sir but i think you misspelled le 90 's !!!!!!!, 
  it 's part of a story about a really dangerous and important game that 's screwed up over a period about 5 or so game sessions . 
  each session is supposed to last about 600 hours , but a lot of them have something really wrong with them ; the one that the comic centers on for the most part takes under a day ( unless you discount the time-traveling , which took like 4 days then ) . 
  lord english here is either directly or indirectly behind every event that led to this massive failure . 
  the only words we 've ever heard him speak are `` how can you outrun me ... 
  when i 'm already here ? '', 
  he 's famous for killing the author and , most recently , to the shock and horror of the entire fandom , then descending into the afterlife to permanently kill everyone who was already peacefully dead . 
  most of the comic takes the format of panels with moving gifs on them , usually subtitled by a large amount of words ( sometimes enclosed in a `` pesterlog '' , which is an im transcript that reads like the script to a play ) . 
  occasionally there are adobe flash ^ \u00a9 animations like the one i showed you that are really cool . 
  [ some of them are games . 
  ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/index.php?s=6&amp;p=004692 ) they 're all really anticipated . 
  the one directly preceding the first one i showed you is the longest one ever , and the website it was hosted on ( newgrounds ) went down less than two minutes after it was put up ( the flash itself is 13\u00a01/2 mins . ) . 
  sorry for two entire parargraphs about irrelevant stuff !, 
  it 's just that homestuck ( the webcomic ) really gets me talking . 
  i 'm not going to pretend that this is n't a thinly-veiled attempt to pique your interest in it , but i do n't get to know either way whether it worked so you can draw your own conclusion . 
  my language is hungarian . 
  it 's agglutinative and synthetic and way more efficient than your language . 
  hungary , fuck yeah !, 
  edit : also , `` neutral pronouns '' ... ... pfffffffft ... ... 
   it 's funny , pure and simple . 
  so he should have put it in / r/funny , as it 's barely relevant to gaming . 
  therein lies the problem . 
  xxxxd, 
  it probably would n't . 
  i 'm curious is all . 
  about the background of his username . 
  it might be the screen and color profile i 'm using . 
  ( apple lcd on both accounts , but it happens to be on a really old and shitty macbook , back when the lcds were n't the best . ), 
  okay , that was condescending as fuck .
