  i was in le europe , and , honestly , they did n't bleep `` shit '' . 
  my country is particularly foulmouthed though . 
  why not ? 
  off-topic / r/atheism submissions get jerked about often enough for no other reason . 
  what makes this different ? 
  the worst part is , { people you are n't allowed to criticize } \u2283 { people who rule over you } , but { people you are n't allowed to criticize } \u2260 { people who rule over you } . 
  ( guys i used math symbols , watch out i 'm so edgy ) the top comment i think is pointing this out in a sarcastic manner . 
  crosspost . 
  press the f key . 
  you 'll escape it . 
  but ... that 's always true , for a sufficient definition of `` vast majority '' !, 
  ( it does n't invalidate your point , though . ), 
  ( i am not the person you replied to . ), 
  i never knew what the game acronym stood for , so i always substituted in `` death of the author ( by le french guy ) '' . 
  how is his attitude towards storytelling dota ? 
  besides , i mean , having a large art team and music team . 
  or is that it ? 
   the fact that - early on , at least - the story was dictated by the fans . 
  ah , yes , i totally forgot about this for some reason . 
  no , he 's making a point . 
  and also assuming that you wish death on the term `` yolo '' . 
  ( wow i swear i 'm not trying to sound condescendingly intelligent by using old-timey grammar ; that 's just the way the sentence formed in my head . 
  i hate myself even more now . ), 
  i do n't have a counterargument to his counterargument because i ca n't justify my hatred for `` yolo '' . 
  maybe i 'd hate it less if its context was more neutral . 
  but no , it 's always got to be teenagers wanting to sound deep . 
  well , fuck them . 
  they 're not deep . 
  i 'm not deep . 
  i do n't follow . 
  you 're in the wrong subreddit to say something like this . 
  that arrow is pointing the wrong way . 
  do you really think / r/gaming could answer a question about math ? 
  you 're right . 
  you just pick a boring old string and tie two ends of it together . 
  what was it before he deleted it ? 
  something like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/y76ci/is_this_topologically_equivalent_to_a_circle/c5syhbf ) ? 
  i 'd think so , since you can map any point on the rope to any point on a circle . 
  i 'm not an expert on topology , though . 
   have you seen the geeks over there , they most certainly could answer math questions and ,, 
  you 're giving them too much credit . 
  what makes them `` geeks '' ? 
  how is the average / r/gaming visitor a `` geek '' ? 
   more importantly , it gets portal nonsense out of here and over where it belongs . 
  it 's just mechanic used to explain his question . 
  no one 's going `` lol the cake is a lie '' . 
  they are honestly answering his question . 
  though , the most important problem here is actually something i failed to mention : it would be completely off-topic in / r/gaming . 
  ah , so then like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/y76ci/is_this_topologically_equivalent_to_a_circle/c5sy00i ) . 
  that 's a really good question , and it probably has to do with how the portal edges work . 
  i 've always imagined that they were infinitely thin and therefore razor sharp , so they 'd just cut the rope to pieces anyway . 
  but , assuming that does n't happen , and they just suspend the rope , i guess you ca n't . 
  i ca n't prove it , though . 
  ( however , it makes a killer tightrope , in a pinch . ), 
  edit : actually , if you bring the two portals together , then it 's the same as if you looped a rope through a solid ring and tied it together . 
  i 'm sure there 's a proof out there somewhere that says you ca n't remove two interlocking rings to be independent from each other . 
  so , if portal edges are solid , then no . 
  ... there 's a / r/gaming thread ? 
  i have to go check it out . 
  also , may i point you to / r/circlebroke , if you want to complain about it more . 
  oh my god . 
  what makes the latter different from the former ? 
  ( i 'm new to this . 
  as i said , i 'm not an expert on topology . 
  intuitively , i understand homeomorphism , though . ), 
  no , but it 's psychologically interesting . 
  we 've found someone who thinks in image macros . 
  like , he thinks a thought , and his go-to medium to conceptualize it is an image macro . 
  that 's fascinating . 
  actually , / u/erictheweirdo , the person who posted that , is an avid default poster , by the looks of his history , posting primarily in / r/pics , / r/adviceanimals , and / r/funny . 
  he occasionally makes [ extremely intelligent ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/whoselineisitanyway/comments/xzoux/censors_s4e27/c5r07ds ) contributions to / r/whoselineisitanyway . 
  he [ has acne ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xmd1d/six_long_months_on_accutane/c5no9e9 ) . 
  not really . 
  if it is , it 's incredibly lazy stalking . 
  i was just wondering whether / u/muldarthegreat got his post content based on / u/erictheweirdo 's history . 
  i only looked at like the first two pages of his history and drew a few ill-justified conclusions . 
  it was actually sort of necessary , to make sure / u/muldarthegreat was n't being unfair to / u/erictheweirdo . 
  someone posted this :, 
   [ -- ] lawyered _ 3 points 4 hours \u00f3ta ( 15 | 12 ), 
    having sex with his girl without a condom, 
   how someone can be so dismissive and insensitive about a possible sexual assault astounds me . 
  then again , this is reddit . 
  ### [ but this person is so , so , so literally brave  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/y625c/dotcom_accused_of_assault_with_his_stomach/c5t1c7q ), 
   [ -- ] ladym [ -1 ] 5 points 56 minutes \u00f3ta ( 11 | 5 ), 
   how someone can be so dismissive and insensitive about a possible false accusation of sexual assault astounds me . 
  then again , this is reddit . 
  what does this have to do with `` today 's situation '' ? 
  ( i am not the person you replied to . ), 
  [ i posted it , too . 
  i think i did it better , though . 
  :p ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/y72ec/post_compares_kim_dotcoms_arrest_to_nuking/c5t2hci ), 
  you might 've posted it during off-hours or something . 
  or given it a bad title . 
  his first piece that i was introduced to was `` three pieces in the form of a pear '' . 
  the album in question that had it , * exotic moods * ( i know , right ? 
  ) , only had the first ... movement ? 
  though , and in my limewire quest ( no , i had no money ) to find the rest of it , i basically got all of his pieces * except * that one . 
  and i really like them . 
  i do n't think this counts , but no one i 've talked to has heard of camille saint-saens before . 
  it 's kind of weird .
