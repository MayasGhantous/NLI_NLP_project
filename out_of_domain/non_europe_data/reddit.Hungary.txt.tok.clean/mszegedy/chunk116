  ( but i always forget to mention danse macabre to them . 
  i just do n't think it 's very representative of him . ), 
  dammit . 
  i love pessimistic music . 
  i 'll give him a look . 
  but would n't that only work if portals have thickness ? 
  ohhhh . 
  i thought you were disagreeing with / u/iamnotyourboss . 
  okay . 
  the one that guy found `` five years ago '' ? 
  a meme is an idea that spreads itself . 
  which is sort of like a gene , i guess . 
  in linguistics , i study [ - emes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emic_unit ) all the time . 
  sememes , morphemes , graphemes , lexemes . 
  i think the term you 're looking for is [ `` seme '' ] ( http://goo.gl/p18xi ) , the fundamental unit of meaning . 
  though , that does n't entirely fit , either . 
  what would an actual word for an `` easily relatable idea such as a social construct that is fairly common to a lot of people on the internet '' be ? 
  i guess any one of these could be a meme ( easily relatable ideas tend to spread themselves ) , but the two are n't one and the same . 
  easily relatable ideas do n't * always * spread themselves , and memes are n't always easily relatable . 
  i guess you 'd find the answer in a [ pragmatics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pragmatics ) lexicon . 
  an idea that 's fairly close is [ deixis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deixis ) , or context-dependence . 
  i guess your not-meme would be best described as the opposite of a deictic - something that you need no context to understand , because it 's relatable . 
  so , i hereby , with all the linguistic power vested in me , dub it an antideictic . 
  ( this is still far from perfect , though , but whatever , semantic descriptivism ftw . 
  it means what i say it means . 
  though if i mentioned the term offhand to someone else , it would sound like it means `` a lexeme that 's understandable regardless of context '' , which is n't what i 'm making it mean here , so really it 's bad composition . 
  oh well , english can suck it . ), 
  i have another question , actually . 
  what do you mean by `` these things '' in your second paragraph ? 
  antideictics ? 
  why do we `` think about them all the time '' ? 
  i hope he knows this because he 's the one who has written it . 
  i think it 's just not very accessible . 
  i think a large portion of the owrld could potentially be into homestuck , it 's just that it 's really hard to talk about it to someone else ( hence `` let me tell you about homestuck '' becoming an entire meme ) , and if you 're seeing it for the first time , it 's even harder to find a reason initially to stay . 
  and so we remain niche . 
  and that 's not a bad thing , because i hate publicity for things that i like , unless it would mean that the author gets more money ( which hussie almost definitely would ) . 
  really , i 'll go full-on hipster and say `` i hate the mainstream . '', 
  it 's bad enough having to deal with goofy homestuck fans who are too into it ; it would be worse having to deal with people who are only into it because it 's cool ( i.e. , not into it at all but still hang around regardless ) . 
  they come from b1 , just like all the a1 meteors came from a2 . 
  that was the glitch all along . 
  they get duplicated between sessions . 
  hiiiiiiii, 
  mostly how people tend to say lol relevant xkcd all over the place and feel so smart for being a fan of a work whose most complicated concepts are covered in introductory physics in high school ( and let 's not forget programming ) , and advocates condescension or just straight-up misanthropy towards unintellectual people ( i.e. 
  anyone who never went to college , although that 's a bit generous towards mr. munroe , as i do n't think he , or at least his fans , are fond of liberal arts majors ) . 
  ( you seem okay , though . ), 
  and it 's generally usually terrible anyway . 
  it used to be pretty good ; i can stand the first 400 or so comics . 
  but the rest is just preachy , pandery nonsense . 
  ( there 's still a few good ones that tend to pop up , though , occasionally . 
  i liked united shapes , and several other ones before it . 
  i have yet to see the latest . ), 
  you do realize that you could make the exact same comment on all the posts here ? 
  / r/circlejerk is such a special snowflake ... 
  edit : ( pun , it was a pun ), 
  this is old news . 
  it happened months ago . 
  ( and i must assure you as a hungarian that everyone regards the jobbik p\u00e1rt as the `` crazy '' party . 
  ( my apologies if that was n't sarcastic ) it 's descriptive . 
  the title and author of a piece are the two things you want to know when considering it . 
  well , maybe also the performer . 
  but this is a better title than `` a piece by erik satie '' and marginally better than `` gymnopedie n \u00b0 3 '' . 
  the worst title for it that would still apply to it would be `` a piece on the piano '' or something ridiculous like that . 
  ( the worst title of all , i imagine , would be composed entirely out of racial slurs . ), 
  well , * someone * did n't pay attention in middle school ... 
  not really . 
  ask a random person , even on reddit defaults , what it is , and they wo n't know . 
  where did that come from , anyway ? 
  chess is a metaphor ? 
  personally , i think you 're just imagining things . 
  ( but , seriously , this is pretty amazing . 
  who here 's read * [ aaaaaaaallllllllllllllll ] ( / ag ) * the poems ? ), 
  but he would n't 've misspelled it . 
  misspelling things is roxy 's thing . 
  ( and a sbahj thing , but dave does n't do that out of sbahj context . ), 
  well , yeah . 
  but they are far from the majority anyway . 
  ( and , as long as we 're getting our sources from wikipedia , they only got 12 % in the second round . ), 
  ( fuck yes ), 
  no , the meteor that destroyed john 's house carried wv 's capsule . 
  the meteor that carried jake was another one . 
  it got duplicated when the scratch happened . 
  the first time it landed was a long , long time ago near i think colonel sassacre 's house . 
  he accidentally killed sassacre and grew up in the past with jane . 
  they respectively became grandpa harley and nanna . 
  in the post-scratch universe , his meteor landed wherever jade 's meteor landed in the first universe . 
  probably on that island with the forge on it . 
  wow . 
  that 's beautiful . 
  i would be so proud of myself if i were able to make a thing like this . 
  hexagons are classy . 
  so are glowing edges .

  i have an old book that i could dig up that teaches calculus with basic , but it 's not quite the same thing . 
  ( and who needs basic anyway . ), 
  though i dislike the syntax . 
  anyone back me up ? 
  source , point numbers , post age ? 
  it does . 
  but only in form .
