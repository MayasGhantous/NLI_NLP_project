  the way it gets there is meteorsplosion . 
  why would she try to copy it ? 
  ( and since when anyway is gamefaq interuniversal ? ), 
  i feel like i am about to pass out from this . 
  but of course i 'm completely fine , and i will continue to distribute my uptokes and downromneys . 
  yeah . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; ggggggggg . 
  jack existed even before homestuck , so you had a lot of time !, 
  as is always with deleted posts , someone has to ask what it was ... ( it 's me , i 'm the one who 's asking ), 
  i do n't know . 
  the first time i saw it was an adviceanimals post with a ( fat , redhead , bad teeth ) girl holding a goosebumps book and proclaiming in impact : `` gershbermpsh is woner my farite bersh ; i love berksh , '' or something to that effect . 
  but i suspect that that was long after the meme 's inception . 
  ( it took me a very long time to understand the joke , as i thought that it was a setup/punchline combo . ), 
  edit : huh . 
  turns out that that was the first one . 
  what are the odds ? 
  that was the only time i ever decided to look through / r/adviceanimals . 
  it * ca n't * be real . 
  someone who was serious about it would at least use the correct gender pronoun . 
  anything but `` it '' . 
  ~ ~ wait , exactly what 's both by / u/apexvibe541 ? 
  i do n't get it either . ~ ~ no wait i get it .

   this shows how the perception of trolling has changed with the facebook generation . 
  trolling used to means something , but the internet has really taken a hit since facebook came on the scene . 
  ( sorry , pm 's apple and tree was at john 's house . 
  the capsule was at rose 's house . ), 
  see [ '' [ s ] wv : ascend .

  only if their users were familiar with the unholy black magyckks . 
  ( and roxy , to be fair , is . ), 
  but rose 's walkthrough was a big , important thing . 
  an offhand comment about an eggy loking thign is n't enough to warrant an interspatial server . 
  sorta changes letters of a word/phrase so it makes a different word/phrase . 
  at least , that 's what i 've gleaned from this example . 
  he 's the deep blue of weird plot shit !, 
  i think most of the front page submissions are pretty okay for / r/gaming , actually . 
  what rustles your jimmies ? 
  ( i hate that phrase , actually ), 
  oh come on surely it ca n't -,

   i want to cum inside twilight sparkle, 
  `` ectobiologist '' becomes `` contraception '' . 
  caliborn becomes `` bloomer '' . 
  lord english becomes `` bad fortune '' . 
  ( who saw that one coming ? ), 
  so does dirk strider . 
  calliope becomes `` collapse '' . 
  ( how creepy . ), 
  bro becomes `` fail '' . 
  ( understandable . ), 
  `` green sun '' becomes `` gruesome '' . 
  ( dae think we 're looking for meaning too deeply in these ? ), 
  `` red sun '' becomes `` hostage '' . 
  ( this is literally foreshadowing . ), 
  `` black hole '' becomes `` melancholy '' . 
  `` cascade '' becomes `` company '' . 
  ( come on , pretty much any random word would have been just as relevant . ), 
  `` s cascade '' becomes `` prejudice '' . 
  ( except that one . ), 
  and , finally , karkat vantas becomes `` nonke attack '' . 
  whatever that means . 
  i have seen the pony thread simulator before . 
  it was in the relevant bar in a homestuck thread simulator . 
  that would be more b2 .1 , and it does n't work because the players are n't humans . 
  ( though actually cherubs could just as well exist in the b universes . ), 
  hussie has so far made a point of focusing on one planet per frog . 
  b1 bro ( old dirk ) and b2 bro ( old dave ) strife-ing . 
  but why ( do argument ) and not do ( argument ) ? 
  but ` do ` is n't the first item in the list , but the command that executes its arguments . 
  ` do ( argument ) ` would of course still have ` ( argument ) ` as a list . 
  it 's almost like ( actually , this are the internal semantics that i use ) the opening parenthesis `` executes '' ( i.e. 
  interprets as a command ) the item directly after it , except when i `` neutralize '' it with an apostrophe . 
  i 'd much rather do away with the apostrophe for entire lists , and instead have ` ( items ) ` represent a list , and ` command ( items ) ` represent a command being executed with those items as an argument . 
  not have the command inside the list . 
  that 's dumb . 
  ( of course , sometimes list items need to be commands anyway . 
  that 's what we have backticks for . ), 
  though , i do dislike facebook , simply because everyone 's on it , and it reminds me how many people there are who are \\* incredibly stupid \\* . 
  like , ca n't - follow-order-of-operations-and-then-berate-the-people-who-do stupid . 
  ( i am talking about a specific post that i got in my newsfeed . 
  i will never forgive it . ), 
  and , well , besides that , how incredibly * boring * the thoughts that my peers have that they wish to communicate are , and how everyone else seems to think it 's da shit . 
  or , at least , the people who `` like `` d , and the people who commented ( the latter tends to be a subset of the former ) . 
  i just do n't want that kind of insight . 
  i 'd rather stay pointlessly idealistic and think that everyone is deep and fascinating and intelligent and is n't deluded , all in their own ways . 
  ( and do n't respond with a sarcastic `` oh , but you , you have it figured out '' . 
  that 's mean . 
  i do n't . ), 
  oh , and it keeps sending me emails every time someone posts in one of the like three groups i 'm subscribed to or whatever . 
  is there any way to fix that ? 
  my inbox is becoming very , very cluttered among the facebook emails and the slacktivism newsletters . 
  trying to remember what function executed stuff ; was it ( lambda lolwhatever ) ? 
  ( i never did get the point of anonymous functions , so i just remembered it as that . ), 
  so then i guess the string ` '' ( somefunction arg1 arg2 ) '' ` would get passed to the interpreter as ` ' ( somefunction arg1 arg2 ) ` , and then it would become ` ( lambda ( car ' ( somefunction arg1 arg2 ) ) ( cdr ' ( somefunction arg1 arg2 ) ) ) ` , if i remember how to do this right . 
  ( it 's been a while since i 've programmed in lisp . ), 
  clever . 
  yeah , that 's what convinced me to use it in the first place .
