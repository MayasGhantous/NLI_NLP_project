  want to hit up a lab coworker in maine ? 
  you got it . 
  that dude whose place i crashed at for a week in sydney ? 
  no problem . 
  all these people with whom i could potentially be friends with would otherwise be separated from me by distance . 
  though , the more that i try this sort of thing , the more i find that i just do n't want friends . 
  i guess i 'm just antisocial . 
  that 's going to be a problem when i apply for college ... 
  well , i mean , okay for * / r/gaming * . 
  i do judge it by different standards . 
  i expect it to be full of memes and cheap laughs and `` dae this ??? '', 
  and it is !, 
  so all is well . 
  it 's not going to be a solo album is what i 've gathered . 
  i expect it to be in vol . 
  10 , which of course will be all about the cherubs . 
  you should get this added to the sidebar . 
  do n't forget xkcd :, 
   his content is digestible in the form of a well-known comic . 
  reddit loves munroe , too . 
  good armok ... 
   an educated article about science, 
  that 's really educated of him !, 
  * science ? 
  * wow !!!!!!!, 
  actually , i remember them , too . 
  i 'm not sure how .

   exactly . 
  he does it because he 's passionate about tesla , not because some corporation paid him to do it . 
  even despite the fact that it will reappear ( and if you delete that , people will go `` omgz mod censorship imma file reddit a request '' ) , it does n't really stop neckbeards from being neckbeards . 
  it 's not breaking rules , as far as i know , so there 's no real reason to delete it . 
  ( but it would be hilarious to deny op the sweet karma . ), 
  edit : oh , it 's not news ? 
  ok then . 
  i mean hear it . 
  eston `` silence '' schweickart - another chance [ bonus ] is a wsw remix . 
  you 're imagining it in sarabande , though . 
  3d printed anything still amazes me . 
  ( and by `` average '' , they mean `` median '' . ), 
  people usually use `` average '' to mean `` mean '' . 
  there 's other types of average , too . 
  one that i have to use often is `` half maximum '' . 
  ( i know , right ? ), 
  the solution is multivac . 
  that 's what people who * are n't * scientists say . 
  the comic specifically said `` futurists '' , not `` scientists '' . 
  you 're misquoting . 
  scientists would n't base their results entirely on wishful thinking . 
  if it was an entire experiment , then that 's not what would come out , `` the remaining amount of time left in the scientist 's life '' . 
  these opinions come from uninformed people who did no research at all , or did minimal research with confirmation bias . 
  i say it will be another game . 
  on the meteor . 
  you start off as dave . 
  holy moly . 
  27,000 + comments . 
  i have never seen the likes of that before . 
  [ how ` bout i explain in pictures !, 
  yeah , but he called the next update a thing for us to see . 
  he would n't just call a panel that !, 
  ( also , games require minimal effort for him ; just a bunch of writing . 
  the rest of the work , drawing and programming , is done by the teams at his disposal . ), 
   reddit 's already got reporters on the scene . 
  awesome .

  ( by the way , you can bring in as bigass of a downvote brigade as you want , it wo n't do * shit * against this comment . ), 
  whenever someone says this on reddit , i assume it 's an xkcd reference . 
  * fuck * xkcd references . 
  / r/random only picks from the top 1,000 . 
  edit : i clicked it * once * , and got / r/marijuana . 
  make of this exactly what you will . 
  wishful thinking ahoy !, 
  i say the wait for cascade was n't even that long . 
  2 months ? 
  [ pfffffffft . 
  it 's a bad comic , full of strawmanning and pandering to ( faux - ) nerd culture . 
  i added the `` faux '' because really , you do n't have to be terribly intelligent to understand any of the comics ( but people like to make it out that they 're smart because they do ) :, 
  - [ lol some people are bad at computers ] ( http://xkcd.com/763/ ), 
  - [ lol scientists are scientific ] ( http://xkcd.com/833/ ), 
  - [ ahaha binary , also sudoku ] ( http://xkcd.com/74/ ) ( i actually like this comic because it 's a funny combination ; it was before the entire reddit-esque fanbase sprang up around it ), 
  - [ lol , java !, 
  and wolf blitzer ] ( http://xkcd.com/801/ ), 
  - [ actually this comic is just boring ] ( http://xkcd.com/707/ ), 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/771/ ), 
  - [ we think like scientists !, 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/678/ ), 
  - [ lol science + sex , so novel ] ( http://xkcd.com/507/ ), 
  - [ extra mega graph comic ( everyone cares about these statistics style ( statistics are scientific ) ) ] ( http://xkcd.com/715/ ), 
  - [ dae we 're smarter than scientists ? 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/171/ ) ( this comic gets a pass because it was written pretty early ), 
  - [ ahaha dae the periodic table of elements ? 
  we 're so smart cause we know about it ] ( http://xkcd.com/965/ ), 
  i got all of these by clicking the random button , like , twenty times . 
  this subreddit sucks , and i do n't reccommend ever being subscribed to it , but why did you specifically unsubscribe after * this * comment ? 
  the conversation is supposed to be funny/witty as a whole , funny because of the ridiculousness of the medium of communication . 
  more than one comment of the nonsense does n't necessarily have to be bad and/or unfunny . 
  they complement each other . 
  but yeah i 'd never vouch for this subreddit , or any of the defaults .
