  they all suck ( especially / r/atheism ) . 
   i get where you 're coming from , but i just find it entertaining because the jokes are funny . 
  i understand if you do n't like people thinking they 're smart because of it , but i like how the jokes are semi sophisticated without going over anyone 's head entirely . 
  a comic directed solely at really smart people would n't be entertaining to the vast majority of comic readers , so the faux nerd thing is really just making the comic accessible to people who maybe would n't understand all the science jokes . 
  it 's really not randall munroe , but the fandom that ruins it for me . 
  a lot of the people that read it ( the commenters , at the very least ) genuinely think that they 're real smart for reading it , and oh so much smarter than the plebs that do n't . 
  `` lol only smart people will get this joke about prime numbers '' is a real thing . 
  it 's sort of disgusting . 
   instead of worrying about who the author is pandering to , maybe you could just read the jokes and enjoy them at face value ? 
  [ some ] ( http://xkcd.com/455 ) [ of ] ( http://xkcd.com/475 ) [ the ] ( http://xkcd.com/631 ) ( wow that last one i linked was the worst . 
  oh and nsfw ) [ jokes ] ( http://xkcd.com/432 ) [ are ] ( http://xkcd.com/455 ) [ bad ] ( http://xkcd.com/513 ) . 
  but that 's okay , a lot of the jokes in a lot of perfectly acceptable works are bad . 
  so that 's not a problem . 
  i can also deal with the fact that it comes off as [ smug ] ( http://xkcd.com/558 ) and [ preachy ] ( http://xkcd.com/519 ) a lot of the time . 
  i can even deal with things that have no purpose other than to [ pander ] ( http://xkcd.com/477 ) , and some of the most egregious [ white-knighting ] ( http://xkcd.com/1027 ) i have ever seen . 
  i would still be able to read it . 
  but reading each new comic , i just ca n't keep the thought out of my head that `` oh god the fanbase must be getting off so much on this '' . 
  it completely ruins all of it for me . 
  which is why i want to kill every mention of a `` relevant xkcd '' and the stupid memes it produces ( sorry , i * am * talking about `` so it has come to this '' ! ), 
  by [ accelerating them to 0.9 c and watching everything explode in a plasma fireball .

  how ironic !,

  what 's a calendar ?

  intermission 2 was nothing * but * a flash . 
  for all we know , we could have the same deal here . 
  i 'm kidding !, 
  kidding !, 
  it was a mildly clever way to say `` i did n't mark it in my calendar , because i hardly know how to use one . '', 
  the latter statement is n't exactly true , either !, 
  i just * do n't . 
  probably , but we 're talking about 7,000,000,000 people here , so mean being a little off is already at the very least millions of people . 
  the actual `` joke '' operates on how 100 iq is by definition the median intelligence , so by definition exactly half of everyone will be `` below '' it . 
  but ... you just called me a `` childish little shit '' for disliking the comic !, 
  this is exactly what i 'm talking about !, 
  how can you say that i ca n't dislike a comic for its fandom , and act like what i hate about the fandom in the first place ? 
  also , i 'd like to see some reasoning for your discredit for my argument about `` white-knighting '' . 
  i 'd cite you ten more examples , but i do n't have that kind of time , or data plan . 
  * my * guess is that you are 16 years old . 
  i 'm probably even being too generous . 
  ( at least , you are about as mature . 
  or `` trolling '' . ), 
  i was n't calling you a troll to win anything . 
  i was only being a bit cowardly and allowing for that you would suddenly change your demeanor and say , `` hahaha , i was just trolling you !, 
  i am in fact a nice person and have no problem with your opinion of xkcd . 
  man , you totally fell for it !, 
  called me a 16-year old and everything ! '', 
  that 's shitty trolling , but people * do * do that on occasion , and it 's really annoying . 
  i just did n't want to be caught off guard . 
  my general opinion remains that you are an angry high-schooler . 
  ( sincerely , shithead . ), 
  i thought he moved there as well . 
  ( on an irrelevant note , do you bear any relation to / u/jamesobscura , besides first name and identical capitalization style ? 
  you both frequent / r/homestuck , and i 'm starting to think you 're alts . ), 
  come on , guys , give this guy a break . 
  it 's hard to make appropriate posts when you 're drunk . 
  who was the person who made money off of reddit for looking at a video ? 
  ( i would n't be mad . 
  if 1 minute of my spare time is worth money to someone else , i 'd gladly donate it if i was going to do it anyway . 
  no , that sentence does n't actually make any sense now that i 've typed it out . ), 
  i missed out on this scandal . 
  engineer of prosperity ! ( !!! 1 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1211 !!!!!! 11 ! ), 
  ooh !, 
  i destroyed a hard drive by sticking the molex into it while it was still hot !, 
  i 'm so proud of myself . 
  ( it was my old emachine 's . 
  i 'm sad about my data . 
  i might invest in a platter transfer someday . ), 
  science , technology , engineering , mathematics . 
  like , create your own social networking site ? 
  why would anyone use that ? 
  ( quickly enough for you to write a dissertation on it , at least . ), 
  i 'm kidding , kidding !, 
  it was the title of a fantroll on / r/homestuckcirclejerk . 
  do they want their primary export to be !! science !!? 
  if so , they need to build an actual university there first ... 
  reddit has good parts . 
  thanks !, 
  do n't turn it into a false dichotomy . 
  i 'm sure that there 's a level of emotional return that reddit would be okay with . 
  i agree . 
  2 months is barely any amount of time at all .

   technically even if the us wants to bomb the shit out of our island , the fact that it 's in the middle of the sea wo n't do much to help us . 
  also i 'm guessing that some countries would allow new settlements to have their own police and/or avoid the state police . 
  i have no intention of buying land in or anywhere near the us ( i.e. 
  mexico , canada , europe ) . 
  ideally this land would be somewhere where the government is slightly less commercialized and corporately controlled . 
  ohhh . 
  but you still need user participation , right ? 
  it gets processed as either an empty bullet or a header , neither of which leave a mark . 
  i have to ask . 
  and now i know what a parametric equation is . 
  same thing , but ` a ` , ` b ` , and a third variable by the name of ` d ` fluctuates , as well as the value that ` t ` goes up to ( which sort of remains a mystery to me ) . 
  i could n't for the life of me figure out how to animate a parameter , even though i know it 's possible . 
  edit : okay , i got it . 
  the trick is that you need to first define the animated variables , and , moreover , the thing you define them as has to be a constant ( i.e.
