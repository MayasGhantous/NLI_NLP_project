  however , one can see the rationale behind this . 
  you do n't need to know programming to surf the internet . 
  you do n't need to know programming , unless you want to , in which case with all likelihood you already do . 
  of course , this reasoning is wrong , but do n't tell me . 
  the point , though , is that it was n't necessary for you to learn basic as a kid , and it is n't necessary for kids to learn c today . 
  but i 'd be grateful were it so . 
  no , i mean ones for cutting trees . 
  so if i make a [ battleaxe ... ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8grhzsku88y/thuczwi34qi/aaaaaaaaabq/_new1vkbsjw/s1600/mba.jpg ), 
  im a classical music and i 'm offended, 
  dwarves are awesome . 
  a few ( he means the vowel specifically ) :, 
  neighbor, 
  weigh ( these two are from the original rhyme ), 
  neigh, 
  inveigh, 
  the rest are basically compounds of `` weigh '' and `` sleigh '' . 
  if you do n't know what `` inveigh '' means , it 's a very useful word that means similarly to `` berate '' . 
  basically , all words of latin origin violate this rule . 
  so if you knew latin , you could tell them apart ( the compounds of * facio * alone bring the total to at least 50 ; counting * scio * , it 's got to be near a hundred already ... ) . 
  successful troll is successful :(, 
  yeah , but the fact still stands that no journalist is going to ever so much as ever set a toe in that code . 
  im an azi and i 'm affended, 
  no , port minecraft to dwarf fortress to minecraft , thats way easier because theres too mine crafts and df is mostly like minecraft anfywaf, 
  so barve, 
  what textucue capkc is ihns, 
  nonononno your diong it worng we need to apdd coper, 
  so barev, 
  no , he 's mexican, 
  i feel they should replace it with ~ ~ korean ~ ~ wait shit i know that chinese characters to make it actually hard to read . 
  ooh , now i 'm tempted to program something like this ... not necessarily with rules for fluid , though !, 
  well , it 's got to be racist somehow ... we ca n't just call it `` british telephone '' or `` italian telephone '' or `` german telephone '' , it must somehow refer to a minority and insult it . 
  it entered the medium with dave and the rest of the items in his house . 
  he was actually on it as he entered . 
  oh thanks, 
  this does n't really apply to dwarf fortress for a start , being high-rate fluid dynamics and such built for a mouse , and furthermore would n't even work for an actual fluid engine because the water has a tendency to multiply ( it goes from a bank screen to an irreparable array of paragraph marks ) . 
  `` poster art for an upcoming animation about a story from dwarf fortress called boatmurdered '' !, 
  that 's going to be epic ... 
  holy shit , i wonder whether this is still playing in some countries ... it came off the networks in hungary a while ago . 
  you do n't even need an intermediary step ... 
  i got to play the solo violin for mvt . 
  2 . :d i was so happy !, 
  it was very fun . 
  hell , like i can, 
  texture pack, 
  no it wrodl deit foal, 
  i had the european one for a few years ( i 'm hungarian ) , and then got the american one to play the american cartridges i kept getting from family ( there was a slight slowdown if you placed american cartridges in european consoles ) . 
  at first i thought that the european one looked way cooler , but then got accustomed to the american one as well . 
  it 's hardly different at all . 
  except south america seems to be raping north america up the front and the nazca plate is nowhere to be fucking found . 
  \\* gasp * you use wikipedia ? 
  do n't you know that 's a disreputable source ? 
  how dare you !, 
  \\* upvotes *, 
  relatively hardly anybody has seen that , and all the people that did thought it sucked . 
  it took me a bit to get that, 
  i had to google that , and then went `` ohhh '', 
  i seriously ca n't get rid of the thing, 
  [ this exact thing , but i died . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/pbvh8/today_i_was_modifying_a_river_before_it_melted/c3o86gg ), 
  lost all my axes . 
  did n't notice tree cutting commands were n't being carried out . 
  when i did notice , i had run out of wood . 
  how does one limit the number of barrels committed to each stockpile ? 
  i have tried telling it to unsubscribe me numerous times , from simple posts containing `` unsubscribe '' to elaborate pleas to leave me alone . 
  it never works . 
  is that high a position normal for the pipa ? 
  texture pack ????????!?!!, 
  please could you unsubscribe me ? 
  hahah , this just happened to me . 
  i embark on the new map ... and my very first message , coming from the very bottom layer , `` warning : part of the cavern has collapsed . '', 
  i pulled out all the stops and dug straight fucking down , and indeed there were caverns on the bottom layer . 
  the fuck ? 
  heh , on the map i just started , the layer i use for my bedrooms is pitted with large veins of tetrahedrite , gold , and silver . 
  i 'm still in the process of completely dismantling my walls ...  _ <, 
  lock, 
  down, 
  everything, 
  this happened to me the other day , but the mechanism was made of chalk . 
  a liquid computer that runs entirely on magma , that controls the flow of magma , sourced by the computer itself . 
  a complete open circulatory system of fun . 
  i could use it to instantaneously flood any or all of twelve different trading areas at once . 
  it also ran an automated sequence that flooded the south halls every one hour in real time . 
  the magma came from a renewable underground source , pumped up thirty-two layers . 
  fps was such a bitch , you have no idea . 
  i eventually abandoned the fortress , though . 
  how do i make sure the food is dumped to the proper place ? 
  like , not my usual dump site for my 500 tonnes of stone . 
  build a dwarven a.i. , it always works . 
  so brave, 
  `` you did this in paint ? 
  lol '', 
  do n't worry , us hungarians think so too . 
  always has been and always will be . 
  just putting up with it . 
  it 's very bland , and it takes forever to chew yourself through it . 
  i recommend that you skip straight to the magma layer instead . 
  they 're just relatively ugly ; the ugliness standards keep increasing at an exponential rate towards infinity due to evolution 's tendency to select the traits most optimal for heterosexual reproduction . 
  scientists predict that it is probable that by 2060 a `` pulchritudinal singularity '' might occur , simultaneously collapsing and exploding the universe as we know it . 
  they will be brought out in about twenty to thirty minutes . 
  the platter includes twelve medium-size wings , which tend to last about ten minutes , assuming you eat one every fifty seconds or so , which has been found to be the customer average .
