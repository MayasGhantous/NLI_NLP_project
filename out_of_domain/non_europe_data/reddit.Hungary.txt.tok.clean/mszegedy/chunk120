  a number ) . 
  edit 2 : [ here 's ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?6v9jlq82pjpep8c ) ` b ` being varied , from -2 to 2 . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?jhtu2tu94gmhr76 ) ` d ` being varied , from 1/2 to 5/2 . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?i1fcchra9bb3c7s ) the 10-cusp sburb spirograph getting drawn . 
  i think it 's supposed to be `` animate parameter ( alt a ) '' , but it 's greyed out at all times for me . 
  edit : okay , i got it . 
  the trick is that you need to first define the animated variables , and , moreover , the thing you define them as has to be a constant ( i.e. 
  a number ) . 
  well , you ca n't animate it just as a simple linear changing of any variable . 
  they fly around erratically , stopping for a while at certain points . 
  also , the thing rotates , which is mega-hard to calculate for a lot of things , involving a bunch of bullshit like sines and cosines and things that no reasonable person would want to involve himself in and rationalize as not a complete waste of time . 
  but , theoretically , if you had a real advanced grapher program , that you could set , like , meta-functions for , like ones that control the variables at certain times , as well as some other stuff like what color to draw with and what line thickness to use , then you would be in fucking spirograph heaven . 
  but that 's completely pointless because it takes less time to just draw the thing on paper . 
  ( i totally suck at that , though , which is why i 've resorted to this mathematical drunkenly staggering around act . ), 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?6v9jlq82pjpep8c ) ` b ` being varied . 
  i set a limit ( heh , more like did n't know how to remove the limit of ) how far it would draw the curve before stopping , so get ready for some interesting segmentation . 
  the variable goes from -2 to 2 . 
  nope . 
  guess again !, 
  it 's a single continuous curve . 
  edit : well , i guess they 're * sort * of like cardioids . 
  but they 're not * closed * cardioids , which makes them not cardioids at all !, 
  hold on , i 'm uploading a video of the spirograph getting drawn ( plus a few other things ) . 
  they 're not \\* really * cardioids . 
  they come close , but they 're not `` closed '' cardioids . 
  the indent part is like totally ripped open . 
  edit : [ here 's the video !, 
  ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?i1fcchra9bb3c7s ) ~ ~ goddamn , it takes up a whole fifth of my mediafire . 
  i totally should 've compressed it before uploading . 
  the other two just keep getting bigger ... the last one is over twice the size . 
  and length . 
  i should make a shorter one . ~ ~ while writing this message , i in fact compressed ~ ~ the second one ~ ~ all of them . 
  who knew that zip compression would work so well with mov ? 
  that 's totally unreasonable . 
  no worries , i got it . 
  turned out you had to have `` x = k '' written in the box , where x is the variable you want to animate and k is an integer . 
  i do n't really get the logic but it works . 
  thanks !, 
  i was looking for the cartesian form , myself . 
  i was only newly introduced to parametric equations after this `` exercise '' and wished that i could somehow derive the cartesian form without actually having to do the work of solving for ` t ` and simplifying 'n' shit which are things that i partly do n't know how to do ( solving for ` t ` i do , at least , but when i simplify all those goddamn trigonometric functions they 're supposed to somehow cancel out ) and partly do n't * want * to do ( fuck substitution ! ) . 
  but yeah i ` da converted it to polar as well . 
  i do n't like the x-y plot at all . 
  the equation for a circle made no fucking sense to me until i realized that it was really just cheaply playing along to those two lines that should have no role in the shape that i 'm envisioning at all . 
  that 's why i 'd put together a bunch of those equations . 
  the first time i figured out how to graph a circle was the first time i figured out you have to draw the top and bottom part successively . 
  ( i think the spirograph would require six equations , correct me if i 'm wrong . ), 
  yay !, 
  you found this at the `` top links of all time '' , right ? 
  no , you 're right . 
  it 's exactly 14 . 
  this is why i have to draw ` t ` out to 14pi . 
  now if i had a way of calculating how many equations for any epitrochioid , i would be completely solid on spirograph graphing algorithms . 
  man , valve jokes !, 
  why wo n't you go away ? 
  i unsubscribed from / r/gaming over you . 
  :( ( i guess they 're okay this one time in this subreddit , though . ), 
  nonono , i 'm [ 0kay ] ( / aa ) with them here . 
  it 's just sort of hilarious how they keep following me around on reddit . 
  it 's almost like they pop up everywhere at once . 
  you 're correct . 
  i 've fixed the link . 
  i did know that epicycloids were a subset of epitrochioids , and the ` d ` from the wikipedia equation is exactly what i 've put in my ` d ` animation , which you 'll be able to view now that i 've fixed the link . 
  it 's not `` a lot more versatile '' ; it 's just one more variable . 
  but it * is * the thing that makes the squiggles in the sburb animation . 
  yeah , i have been subscribed for a fairly long while , and these days it seems more and more that the submissions have some sort of political slant to them . 
  and this slant is / r/politics 's . 
   - a red flippy-lever is called a flag . 
  the origin of the thing was that he accidentally drew lord english , and vocalon submitted it as a link . 
  hence why i focused on le . 
  that latter one definitely gets the `` best photography award '' or `` best choreography award '' , but [ that davesprite cosplay towards the end ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pl4dc#fvcrs ) was ridiculously lifelike . 
  ( also , wow , was that watermark on that one an accident or on purpose ? ), 
  and neither are the handmaid 's . 
  one panel was missing them before hussie surreptitiously fixed it . 
  i think that particular cosplay was posted on here before . 
  but it could have been a different mind-blowingly detailed one . 
  dude , we 're not hsg . 
  i think they 're either vesicles or lysosomes . 
  right . 
  hussie in fact stated to the contrary . 
  if anyone wants to talk about how bad that game was and how it did n't live up to its potential , i 'm here . 
  a hero of hope hoodie !, 
  have you been told about homsetuck yet ? 
  did you know that there 's a subreddit for it ? 
  learn typing with garfield ? 
  euler is literally your name ? 
  that 's incredibly cool . 
  do you have any data + inferences to back yourself up ? 
  joinusjoinusjoinus, 
  the game was a letdown as a whole , though . 
  what do you expect this subreddit to be full of ? 
  theories and fanart ? 
  ( obviously those are two things i come to this subreddit for as well . 
  but not exclusively . ), 
  `` telling [ x ] about homestuck '' is a significant feature of homestuck `` culture '' . 
  i think it has every right to be in this subreddit . 
  edit : and , let me make a comparison : would n't you agree that this is far better than content like `` guys look betty crocker stuff '' or `` guys look a bucket '' ? 
  heh , i love this . 
  good job on taking a shot at drawing the cairo overcoat without animating it !, 
  ( however , this is n't canon . 
  that 's okay , though ! ),
