  however , they were n't granted at this point yet . 
  the irony is that blue light is one of the colors that carries the highest amount of energy . 
  that ... looks fairly useless actually . 
  what if i need the systems in separate places ? 
  wow , he is !, 
  judging by the little meme thumbnails ... 
  i actually have no idea what subreddit it is . 
  i like it !, 
  how did you get it to show up green like that , btw ? 
  i am still learning my way around grapher . 
   many [ redditors ] live ( d ) sheltered lives in the suburbs , and probably never interacted with minorities or had any opinion forming experiences outside of tv , movies , and music . 
  when someone like that first has an experience with a different culture , the experience is probably quite jarring . 
  `` people call this shit music ? '', 
  an especially classy neckbeard might say . 
  `` i only listen to really deep stuff like queen '' . 
  i do n't get how these people can be * this * sheltered . 
  i am a white christian male living in the suburbs , and i have been exposed to all of this culture that you are making these people out to be deficient in !, 
  i mean , i do n't * doubt * what you 're saying ... 
  i just do n't understand how it 's possible for it to be true . 
  people think that * adult * trolls ' skins are black . 
  and they could 've been right , since adult trolls are always depicted with this shadowy art style that never quite made it clear whether their actual skins are black . 
  however , i have found the one exception to this art style . 
  jumpsuit ? 
  do n't forget how little he knows about sports . 
  remember the last time this was posted ? 
  [ this is what the neckbeards have to say about it .

  these are her last moments , before she loses the battle with the condesce . 
  i. . . have no excuse . 
  as much as i dislike the comic strip and referencing it in general , randall munroe sums it up nicely ( but somewhat incompletely ) : http://xkcd.com/793/, 
   it 's probably because he 's got such a massive amount of karma he does n't have to worry quite as much about pandering and can just speak his mind , since he can take the negative karma if it comes to that . 
  * no one * has to worry about karma . 
  * everyone * can take negative karma . 
  karma does n't have any effect on anything whatsoever . 
  i do n't think the posters should really count , since those are n't really `` trolls '' depicted in those posters , just humans with horns . 
  ( i mean , of course they 're supposed to be trolls , but they ca n't be entirely anatomically accurate , because you ca n't change the actual picture of the human , just put horns on it . ), 
  what 's the other fandom ? 
  this seems vaguely familiar . 
  edit : [ explained !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/ynd1x/d_strong_sloth_warning_fandom_clash/c5x50h1 ) okay i * am * familiar with that work . 
  hooray !, 
  but this person ended up with a product that is objectively worse to have than separately having an xbox and a ps3 . 
  the advantage is that you can have them in separate places . 
  ( i often need to have a console in a completely separate place from , say , any other computational device of mine . ), 
  he gained nothing from combining them into one case , except some superficial case modding experience that he could have acquired otherwise . 
  all he did was lose the ability to separate the two consoles . 
   i bet the air flow is a hell of a lot better though and both systems will last longer in that case . 
  okay . 
  that certainly is a point , and it makes the issue more complicated . 
  now you have to weigh which benefit is worth more to you . 
   back to my original point , we do things because we can and it 's cool/fun , whatever you want to call it , to do so . 
  but with that energy you can also do something that is both fun * and * useful . 
  to take an extreme , it might also be fun to burn down your house , but that 's not something you should do anyway despite how fun it is . 
  or , to take something completely neutral , it might also be fun to ... eh ... say ... masturbate , but that does n't benefit anyone at all , and is essentially a waste of your time , so nobody 's advocating that , either . 
  please note that i 'm not comparing casemodding an xbox and ps3 together to burning down your house or masturbation . 
  there * are * things to be gained from it : i mentioned experience , and you mentioned airflow . 
  but what you lose with it might make it altogether a less good way to spend your time than a more purposeful casemodding project . 
  to retain the two benefits of both airflow and experience , you could mod * both * of them into separate , complementary cases . 
  it takes more money though , and is slightly less original , but it 's an equally interesting project . 
  bonus points if you can attach the two cases to each other and carry them around as a unit ( but still be able to separate them ) . 
  i do n't get it .

   you forgot about the pnac document from 2000 that stated that the us needed a new pearl harbor in order to achieve its goals of being the dominate nation in the 21st century .

  it 's you . 
  edit : i might as well edit in an actual reply , while i 'm at it . 
  i thought that this was a very common theory . 
  not `` very common '' as in `` a belief held by a majority of homestuck fans '' , but `` very common '' as in `` popular among the minority of homestuck fans '' . 
  the first ( and last ) time i saw it was on here , and it 's troubled me endlessly , because i could n't find a counterexample ( and no , i did n't think the posters counted ) until i found this panel . 
  i posted it here after that . 
  ... it makes sense, 
  pyramids and triangles are n't actually that hard to derive the formulas for , though . 
  if he had said something real hard like ... 
  i dunno ... a torus , or a folium of descartes ( still not impossible to derive ) , then i 'd be doubting him . 
  well , i still doubt him . 
  but at least this is possible . 
   as a nickelback fan, 
  fuck you ; never come on reddit again !, 
  we only allow * cultured * people here , who listen to queen . 
  ( i do n't know what queen is . ), 
  why did i have that upvoted ? 
  i do n't even know who nickelback is . 
  this is either exactly or exactly the opposite of a thread that happened , like a month ago . 
  points for originality , i guess !, 
  looks more like an heir of time thing , but fun !, 
  you 're not alone , but i do n't support it . 
  i still like to discuss in the smaller subreddits . 
  i 'd be sad if reddit disappeared . 
  i do n't care that / r/picsofdeadkids exists because it does n't affect me or anyone else i care about in any manner . 
  it could go on existing forever , for all i care . 
  it does n't do anything to me . 
  do it !, 
  publish the results . 
  i 'm sure you 'll get helvetica 'd for it , and i 'd love to see . 
  i 'd do it myself , but i never actually visit the subreddits we usually complain about , and i do n't want to start to do so now .
