  ( wow , ten monosyllabic words in a row . ), 
   the veil that cover the heads of normal people . 
  you 're probably talking in terms of * their * beliefs , but still , please reassure me that you did n't just call hate for pedophilia a veil that covers the heads of normal people . 
   no shit it is n't normal you moron , that is why it has a name . 
  if it was normal , it would n't have a name . 
  i do n't want to get involved in this argument , but i do want to point out that lots of normal things have names . 
  to take a vaguely similar example : heterosexuality . 
  that 's always been considered a normal thing , by any definition . 
  or , pretty much any everyday object , or umbrella names for them . 
  food . 
  air . 
  those are still normal , and have names . 
  maybe you meant to make a different point with it ? 
  wait , i do n't get the point you 're making by posting this . 
  are you saying that we * should * give / u/jakenichols credit for pointing this out ... ? 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i mean that it sounded like you were sympathizing with the neckbeards . 
  but okay !, 
  a seer hood is just a hood , though , without any sort of curly or curvy thing . 
  #### literally this, 
  [ oh my gog , * literally this comment *  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/v8yzm/how_to_determine_who_to_unfriend_on_facebook/c52fvro ),

   same with me . 
   likes from my friends list :, 
   today , i died a little inside . 
  i understood `` primary '' to be `` 1-12 '' . 
  huh . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm [ literally from sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_school#sweden ) . 
  ( i 'm not . ), 
  it 's literally hitler . 
  i recommend staying as far away from it as possible . 
  i 'd tag just from the submissions from circlebroke , and that would make me a lazy shit when there 's so much more data to be had out there . 
  do an ama . 
  [ and here 's the paper , also taken from / r/programming . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=a%20whole-cell%20computational%20model%20predicts%20phenotype%20from%20genotype ) this excites me so much . 
  i 've always wanted to do this , and now it 's a reality !, 
  i 'd love to see systems of these . 
  wow ... 
  wow , i 'd love to read that . 
  asimov has written some of my favorite science fiction , like the foundation trilogy and the last question . 
  do you have a link ? 
  i stopped reading after it contradicted known canon ( with the black hole theory that turned out to be false ) . 
  it 's still valid for the most part , though , and i 'm adopting it . 
  life . 
  it 's on my list of things to do , but i 'm pretty busy . 
  right . 
  augh , the page wo n't load for me at all . 
  they told me that undescriptive titles like `` i 'll just leave this here . '', 
  are bad , but i did n't listen and said , `` i 'm just going to click on it anyway . '', 
  now i feel the * true * agony of titles like that . 
  whyyy could n't you say what it was where you were supposed to ... ( i can see the thumbnail and the fact that it 's a youtube video , though . ), 
  no , one of the * other * black holes in homestuck . 
  then prototype with it . 
  eh , the knight `` hood '' looks more like a coif . 
  it 's really tight . 
   you know , people can be republican ( edit : or even support mitt romney ! ), 
  and be nice , interesting , creative , and intelligent people . 
  get out of your box . 
  how edgy !, 
  in mine , `` right '' literally means `` better '' . 
  but you could say something similar for english , too . 
  i did n't remember that line . 
  the worst part about quoting that is that they act like it invalidates your argument . 
  it was his * sun * that was dead . 
  butthurt stem major detected ... ( i 'm kidding , though . 
  i do n't agree with his point either . 
  it 's a pretty bad joke , too . 
  but you ca n't deny the correlation . 
  at least , the correlation from our sample . ), 
  okay , thanks !, 
  ah , i see now . 
  ctrl-f ctrl-f , was not disappoint !!!!!!!, 
  ### so brave, 
  an * entire * black kid ? 
  smooth . 
  i think the majority of his stuff is made up , similar to the significant portion of stories made up here in general . 
  the difference between a 4chan greentext story and an askreddit story is that , while the former may * obligatorily * be fiction , the latter is always posted under the pretense of being true . 
  thus , people feel more of a need to conceal this fact . 
  but the * hair * is n't sprite-flipped . 
  well , it 's only * mostly * spriteflipped . 
  that top part remains the same . 
  is this then the opposite of planepacked ? 
  care to share ? 
  quotes on pictures ?!?!, 
  what have we become , / r/atheism ? 
  the algorithm favors subreddit diversity over voting accuracy . 
  [ someone ] ( / u/jamesobscura ) tagged me this ( i think the tag reads something like `` massive shithead '' ) . 
  now i get not only a downvote , but a rude comment every time he sees me . 
  one of the best books that i 've read that centered around `` cool '' chemistry was * the poisoner 's handbook * by deborah ... someone . 
  fuck you !, 
  you 're not an intelligent linguist like me , who has the * privelege * of arguing about what to call it !, 
  ( / jerk it does n't matter , there 's really no difference between the two . 
  jerk ron paul 2008 !!!! ), 
  jeez , i thought this class was only required exclusively for a biomedical engineering major . 
  turns out people are taking this all over the damn place ? 
  i did n't know it was so popular . 
  anyway , what a condescending professor . 
  that 's a bad way to justify this . 
  the barcode did n't flip because that was what advanced the plot . 
  the hair is a cosmetic issue that has no reason not to follow the normal rules of 4-dimensional rotation .
