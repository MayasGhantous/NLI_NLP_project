  [ guys , here 's a ragecomic about how a professor totally showed someone who was literally a stupid fundie !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/yskod/well_the_professor_seemed_excited_anyway/ ) or , more accurately , the professor did n't do a damn thing , just make a condescending comment . 
  [ i was going to link this one , too . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/yhjd3/please_dont_comment_like_this/c5vnaww ) it 's * literally * the christians ' fault . 
  they 're simply that sneaky . 
  it 's not your fault . 
  he misspelled it so that it looked like it was what * he * though . 
  / r/circlejerk + politics . 
  it 's a fun game !, 
  this is the thread where we * specifically look for * articles from / r/politics to complain about . 
  whoops , that made it sound like this thread itself incites people to go scour / r/politics for bad submissions . 
  it does n't . 
  the entire purpose of / r/circlebroke is to point out what 's wrong with reddit . 
  / r/politics is a big part of that . 
  there 's lots to complain about in there . 
  so , to avoid the / r/circlebroke front page being flooded with submissions about it , all of the complaints about / r/politics are collected in this one thread . 
  they 're a bit lower-quality than the rest of the sub , since it all takes place in the comments , and submission standards are lower . 
  there 's already something like that , but it 's deep inside the faq . 
  [ come on ] ( http://www.advocatesfnm.org/oldgrowth/images/lateral_root_diagram.jpg ), 
  i * know * that `` i hate something popular '' is n't a minority opinion !, 
  sorry , my personal example was a pretty bad one . 
  it should n't be like that . 
  `` i like nickelback '' * is * a good one , because reddit generally hates nickelback . 
  `` i hate something popular '' is the entire reason i made this thread !, 
  i hated that `` post controversial opinions '' posts were full of that , so i wanted to find answers that were * genuinely * controversial by the standards of reddit . 
  edit : aha , you edited your post . 
  i 'll edit mine , then , too : then why do i get downvoted every time i complain about xkcd ? 
  i think the best possible way to live is being able to see beauty in * everything * ... 
  if you do n't like it just leave ^ leave ^ leave ^ leave ^ leave ^ leave ^ leave ^ leave, 
  is it linked to `` it.reddit.com '' because you use italian reddit ? 
  i have my reddit language as hungarian , and my urls still begin with `` www '' rather than `` hu '' . 
  excuse me , but * some of us * have school year-round . 
  it 's a form of quality control , i 'd say . 
  no , i mean that flipping did n't operate on a complete basis . 
  like , it flipped certain `` properties '' of his body , but not the arms ( only the cutoffness ) , thus he was able to use the barcode . 
  do n't tell me that the spriteflipping functioned in an inconsistent way not because it advanced the plot . 
  as long as i 'm asking questions in / r/theoryofreddit , may i ask how you turn on the green modflair on a subreddit if you moderate it ? 
  ( i 'll delete the link , though , if you ask . 
  i 'm leaving it up for those who may have the same question , but in the future i 'll make sure to post such threads it / r/help . ), 
  why is it sufficiently disproven ? 
  what empirical evidence do you have against someone having created the universe ? 
  ah , i already have a pair of subs , [ one that 's relatively thriving ] ( / r/karkat ) and [ one that 's not in use yet ] ( / r/truehomestuck ) . 
  that 's why i want to know , because i ca n't find any sort of button that does that . 
  i 'll look for it , thanks !, 
  hey , me too !, 
  i still tend to eat it , though , when it 's a variety i like . 
  i 'm hungarian , which means that 90 % of the things i eat are meat , which include `` szalonna '' , our equivalent of bacon . 
  this is the thing that i * do * eat . 
  i think that might just be your terrible connection . 
  i do n't * want * to be a moderator of anything . 
  i do n't have time for that . 
  i just want the credit for having created it . 
  i 'll totally pick mods for it if it comes to that . 
  or i 'll hold a vote or something . 
  i do n't agree with the feudalistic nature of reddit moderation . 
  that this subreddit devolves into memes and bucket jokes , the moderators leave , it 's invaded by a shitton of new subscribers , etc. 
  it 's basically a failsafe for good content . 
  what 's funny is that aside from her typing quirk , she uses the best grammar ( capitalization and punctuation-wise ) out of all the other trolls ,, 
  i 'm 50 % sure he 's male . 
  that does n't really have anything to do with anything . 
  this seems to be a * personal * sort of hate , regardless of the general character of the person that his username may or may not indicate . 
  yes . 
  * any * religion 's whatsoever . 
  heh , lithium fuses so fast that it 's considered to be the one element that there 's a limited amount of in the universe . 
  but anyway , i do n't think that the green sun is necessarily and actual star . 
  after all , it does n't emit light like one ; not only does it burn green , but it burns with something of the luminosity of a lightbulb no matter how far it is from you ( and , since everyone is still able to breathe no matter where they are in the medium or the furthest ring , no matter how much air it has to go through ; this would also spectrallly shift it away from green ) . 
  it 's like the light from it teleports directly to your eyes . 
  ( i 'm not going to use that sentence as a springboard to a theory . ), 
  my pet theory ( i.e. , headcanon ) is that it 's sentient to a degree . 
  [ sam hughes wrote a story like that once . 
  ] ( http://qntm.org/solaris ) i do n't know what it 's really made of -- it seems to be hollow enough to support scratch 's castle being intact with lord english coming back . 
  whatever it 's made of , gravity does n't really work on it . 
  it was confirmed by rose to have mass , though , so it 's not like it 's not affected by gravity because it 's massless . 
  green sun powers probably come from its direct mass-energy conversion , anyway . 
  bottom line , it 's pretty much a mystery , what it 's made of . 
  to your edit : me , not for a second whatsoever . 
  i 'd picture caliborn 's body type more unisex , like how i picture the rest of cherub biology ; after all , he has a female counterpart who uses the same body . 
  on a related note , it 's not hard to look at calliope and caliborn as the same person , if you accept that they share a brain . 
  what might throw it off is that they do n't share memories . 
  but still !, 
  remember the 16th century ? 
  yeah , [ mean either . 
  o , francium , why do you have to be so hard to obtain ? 
  please , next time just shut up and pretend to be a 20-something like the rest of us . 
   have been to most of europe . 
  greetings from the entire area of eastern europe ( though my country likes to think of itself as `` central '' ) , where almost everyone is a christian !, 
  but could n't he use something cheaper that 's * not * specifically scented for dogs ? 
  i do n't feel that way , at least . 
  you could be thinking it because there are two beams coming from the scratch , and the left one brackets the beat mesa neatly , but the right one misses a pipe/gear on that side . 
  but [ literally this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/yuxlm/i_say_neil_was_exploited/c5zbrau ) :, 
   that kind of accuracy has christianity written all over it . 
  what 's the tesseract for ? 
  i figured that he was a * student * ... 
  i 've been looking for this !, 
  thank you . 
  if they are burning it to mock your religion , then no . 
  really ? 
  i thought it cost a pretty ridiculous amount per gram . 
  do n't worry , i reported it . 
  ( as in , i reported myself , with an alt . ),
