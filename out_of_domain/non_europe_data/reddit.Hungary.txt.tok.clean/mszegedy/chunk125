  thanks , i 'll check there . 
  no , because then you 'd be brought down by the mistakes of past players . 
  i dislike reddit as well , although not as much as i dislike redditors . 
  i blame the content-suppressing voting system as well as the voters . 
  what are you , sexist ? 
  it 's a * toddlers ' show * , not a girls ' show . 
  i read * homestuck * , which is a webcomic that occasionally incorporates flash animations . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006009 ) is an example of a particularly long such animation . 
  most recently , we got our [ first update ever ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007163 ) that was an html5 canvas instead of a flash animation . 
  i ca n't imagine any such thing with any different a medium . 
  actually , i 'd be grateful if someone could point me to an alternative , more modern medium , with the same capabilities as flash . 
  i can find no substitute . 
  i threw that idea out straightaway because i do n't think they 'd ever cover the pupils like that , and the brightness also seems to be being applied to the whites , which would make no sense for contacts . 
  why in the world would we * ever * want that ? 
  what , her hair ? 
  ah , lookit latula using capital letters ... also , the thumbnail is great . 
  you are exactly correct . 
  check out this part of the dialogue : http://i.imgur.com/krn2e.png see : '' [ twisted redux ] ( / ga ) '' , '' [ #the o + utco + me was so + mewhat different this time ] ( / ga ) '' . 
  * papal * density . 
  / r/politics also has that last bit . 
  oh , * that 's * why it looked weird !, 
  and that 's supposed to be `` and really , '' , not `` but really '' . 
  point is , it 's all his other dialogue . 
  hey im an 18 year old scientist too , i do real research and everything, 
  * please * find me that post . 
  yes , i do n't get this either . 
  it was a great comment . 
  ( also , it was in the top 4 top-level ones , so no wonder . ), 
  edit : and you will see in my post that my res marker for you is [ +7 ] ( now [ +10 ] ) . 
  they 're officially ( / s ) classified as `` about to fail '' . 
  they have way too many social and economic problems . 
  i remember this one !, 
  i signed it . 
  does that make me a neckbeard ? 
  ( where da phd in neckbeard at ), 
  this one was a troll . 
  link to original post , please ? 
  also [ ] ( / sobrave ), 
  you 're not even typing in your color . 
  do you even know anything about how this subreddit works ? 
   i hate holier than thou people on reddit . 
  if something like that happened to your loved ones , you would want torture too . 
  quit trying to act like you 're morally above everyone with sarcasm . 
  oh my god . 
  it 's * these * people . 
  i 'm speechless . 
  no , wait , i 'm suddenly not speechless . 
  why do these people always think that the goal of letting people know that their post is bad is * feeling superior * ? 
  it 's as though they ca n't conceive of any more complex motivation than `` i want to feel like i 'm better than you '' . 
  * maybe * i want good content on reddit !, 
  * maybe * i do n't like looking at people jumping to conclusions !, 
  * maybe * i want more reasoned discussion !, 
  * maybe * i 'm a * nice person * , and i have * better things to do * than look at posts and think `` i 'm better than this guy '' , and i just want to write a small reminder * not * to get a little too circlejerky !, 
  * why * does it have to be `` well , your opinion is invalid because you 're just using it to feel superior to me ? '', 
  ; - ; i like to tell myself that they 're just projecting ... 
  ohhh . 
  i 've never seen the series , so there 's no way that i would 've understood the reference . 
  thanks !, 
  so , batman ? 
  ( disclaimer : i know nothing about batman ), 
  i think prototyping with the same thing twice would be equivalent to prototyping with just one instance of that thing . 
  but that 's a really boring answer . 
  and i 'm okay with this , because it makes their etymology more clear . 
  exactly this , me too !, 
  ( i 'm actually serious , though . 
  i do [ this thing ] ( http://www.mdibl.org/high_school_application_process.php ) . 
  marvel at its legitimacy . 
  i am a real scientist , doing scientist things . ), 
  this seems really cool , but i 'm not sure whether it 's appropriate for me . 
  what are the prerequisites ? 
  i am good to go , then . 
  sign me up !, 
  yes . 
  moreover , it belongs to a circlebroker . 
  it could be any one of the 10,000 + members of this subreddit . 
  this weekend is special . 
  most of the rules do n't apply . 
  hell if i know . 
  i do n't think the mods have a no-tolerance policy on novelties , though . 
  wait , which language was copyrighted ? 
  the first two stanzas were in latin , so it 's probably not them . 
  are you talking about the second two stanzas ? 
  what are those ? 
  that elfin language from lord of the rings ? 
  oh , i thought i had just missed that chest last time . 
  good sketches , bad photography . 
  do you own a scanner ? 
  where ? 
  indeed . 
  look at that oxygen pimpin ' it up in the top right corner , forming four bonds at once !, 
  the inuits use the same alphabet , so op was right . 
  it is absolutely * not * a bigger jerk . 
  remember faces of atheism ? 
  i never really realized how good this piece is . 
  ( oh , and i 'm totally with you on this . 
  good job finding it ! ), 
  i like the emphasis on how hairy jake 's legs are . 
  i see why some people would prefer * not * to have the godtier jammies . 
  at least , page players . 
  biology .
