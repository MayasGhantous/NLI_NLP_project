  i.e. , psychology . 
  i reported it . 
  this is stupid content . 
  i remember a facebook post i saw just a little while ago reading `` 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 \u00d7 0 : like if 0 , comment if 14 '' . 
  predictably , it had about 15,000 likes and about 7,500 comments , although there were on average about 3 comments to a person , and some of the comments read `` oh my god 7,500 comments i want to kill myself , anything multiplied by 0 is 0 guys how can you be such idiots '' . 
  most interestingly , there was a splinter group who commented that the answer was in fact 5 , which kind of illustrates what 's wrong with just teaching people `` pemdas '' . 
  ( although if you actually process it in pemdas order , it should i think come out to 6 , but i digress . ), 
  that 's okay , though . 
  i 'm hoping all these people will grow up or something . 
   aranea has been described as a spidery-vampire . 
  oh come on . 
  you have * no * excuse for that . 
  the rest of your points are sound , though . 
  i ca n't tell from here . 
  are the glasses the right shape ? 
  to be fair , i 'd also take any cop-out not to multiply out ( x +2 ) ( x-3 ) . 
  i hate multiplying polynomials . 
  my cop-out in this case is that it 's already factored for me , so that the answers are { -2 , 3 } . 
  no , i can multiply them !, 
  it 's just mentally painful . 
  oh , i know how to expand it . 
  but it takes me a good 5-10 seconds to do it . 
  i fucking hate multiplying stuff like that . 
  the higher degree a polynomial is , the worse it is to multiply with it . 
  so much shit to account for . 
  then you got ta add it ... no thanks . 
  ( i mean , i have to do it anyway very often , but that does n't stop me hating it . ), 
  forget about the zero completely , i think . 
  i was too lazy to check the first time around , but then i forgot the whole thing except the general pattern and numbers 14 and 5 , and in solving for the system a + b-2 = 14 and a-b = 5 , i realized that that 's impossible to do with just 1 's . 
  and so i 'm baffled at how they got 5 in the first place . 
  but i 'm certain it was those two numbers . 
  i guess they were n't using pemdas at all . 
  or , well , not religiously . 
  maybe they 're the same people from the top comment who think addition and multiplication are the same thing ? 
  they learned that addition takes precedence over subtraction . 
  that is , pemdas . 
  i have n't reversed the cause and effect . 
  first , andrew hussie , probably in his very early youth , learned about the zodiac symbols . 
  then , later , when he was writing homestuck , he decided to write 12 characters based on them . 
  the question is whether the 12 additional characters related to these characters will have a similar correspondence . 
  unless of course you take homestuck as literal gospel , in which case i regard you as delusional and do n't entertain your opinion any longer . 
  but the character herself has no relation to spiders . 
  the fact that she was described as spidery by another character has no bearing on what she actually is . 
  do you honestly see anything inherently spidery in her ? 
  ( n ) represents - n in finance ? 
  this is news to me . 
  wow , the system is really evil , is n't it ? 
   that does n't require memorization, 
  why would multiplying polynomials ever require memorization ? 
   even if yhuu do multiply before yhuu add itsz still fuckinq zero . 
  i am so ashamed for my country , i think . 
  ( the country in question is hungary . ), 
  we 're supposed to be real good at math !, 
  we 've done lots of important stuff in math !, 
  the most recent abel prize winner was hungarian !, 
  ( szemer\u00e9di is a cool guy , by the way . ), 
  what business does this person * have * not knowing order of operations like that and using hungarian orthography to english ? 
  this person needs to go back to school . 
  well , a lot of people need to go back to school . 
  but this person seems like she failed english * and * arithmetic . 
  edit : and what 's the q doing there , anyway ? 
  edit 2 : turns out the person is american . 
  my mistake !, 
  it 's kind of funny how it turned into prefix notation anyway when functions were first introduced . 
  what even is 6/2 ( 1 +2 ) ? 
  i 'd vouch for the one on the right , since it 's processing them in left-to-right order , like equivalent-order operations should be . 
  do you remember ( know ? ), 
  that asimov story where everyone has forgotten how to do math on paper or in their heads , and the person who rediscovers it is hailed as a genius ? 
  i forget its name , but it was in the same collection that included `` the last question '' . 
  [ for one thing , she considers herself spider-themed . 
  ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004553 ) though that does n't necessarily make her that . 
  what about when she caught tavros in a web ? 
  that 's pretty spidery . 
  she likes to [ manipul8 ] ( / ag ) people , evoking an image of a many-armed spider reaching into many places . 
  ( that last bit was somewhat corny of me to say . ), 
  or , more straightforwardly , we can say that she 's got everyone metaphorically caught up in her spidery web , spinning all of these ridiculously complicated plans , ensnaring her victims . 
  this has indeed been referenced multiple times in a comic , mixing the metaphor with the one about irons in the fire . 
  it 's pretty short . 
  i 'll dig it up for you in a moment . 
  edit : [ aha , here it is !, 
  ] ( http://www.themathlab.com/writings/short%20stories/feeling.htm ) `` the feeling of power '' . 
  i ca n't say i can vouch for it , though . 
  the premise is good , but everything else is wrong . 
  computers are far superior to humans in the application that asimov writes for it . 
  or , at the very least , you can have humans remotely controlling them , if you absolutely need humans . 
  huh . 
  that 's because you 're used to automatically instantly multiplying a coefficient into a parenthetical expression , and also used to using the division sign as a grouping symbol , always grouping things on either side of a division sign with parentheses . 
  but this is a trick !, 
  the division sign here is just a division sign , not a vidicum ( which qualifies as a grouping symbol ) , and it only divides the two things on either side of it . 
  and since the thing on the thing on its right side is involved in a bit of multiplication , it 's proper * not * to multiply it out , because multiplication does n't take precedence over division . 
  exactly !, 
  jade has access to teleporters and radiation cookers and refrigerators that involve metastorage . 
  why would n't she have access to a razor ? 
  that 's because it takes 3 nanoseconds to travel one yard . 
  it is the hungarian word for `` archer '' . 
  edit : huh , he even wrote it out . 
  stupid stupid dumb , i should learn to read everything before posting about it . 
  [ < 3 ] ( / tg ) [ < 3 ] ( / docscratch ) [ < 3 ] ( / gg ), 
  edit : shit , it looks like the italian flag . 
  that happens a lot .
