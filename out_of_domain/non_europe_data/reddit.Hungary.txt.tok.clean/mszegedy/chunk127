  they are n't * caliborn * bad . 
  this is a good reason !, 
  but maybe not a true one ? 
  i 've never seen anything stating that this is how it is . 
  whaddaya mean useful ? 
  that 's okay !, 
  i thought you were n't assuming such a thing , rather advocating the exact method mentioned in the article , using the partial-products-y sort of multiplication . 
  what i am complaining about is multiplying them in my head ( sorry for not stating that !, 
  ) , so i was like `` this does n't exactly apply to me '' . 
  then i noticed what you said about memorization and i did a & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; . 
  joke 's on you : what if the initial numerator is n't 1 ? 
  who are the two people on the right cosplaying ? 
  he 's a douchebag . 
  edit : i do n't regret this post . 
  why are all `` fansongs '' solo acoustic guitars with female vocals ? 
  it 's like an entire genre . 
  one that i do n't care for . 
  ( not that i mind seeing it here . 
  i just want to see * other * kinds of fanmusic , too . 
  ones that i can appreciate as well . ), 
  then i 'm doing multiplication and division wrong is what i 'm doing !, 
  but , seriously , sometimes it 's better to write something as 1/n times something . 
  maybe it 'll make it neater . 
  no , i mean that i was counting wrong when i was replying to you . 
  but read the edit , though !, 
  regardless of gender , you can get all sorts of body hair by age 13 . 
  yes . 
  this is like / r/tifu except after the firing has happened . 
  you should 've just forbidden the items immediately . 
  also , gives me another excuse to dislike the phrase `` yolo '' . 
  so , if a pe group wants to buy my company , i should be offended ? 
  still better than how well i can draw . 
  you 're right , i 'll edit that in . 
  ( for future reference , i said milliseconds . ), 
  i 'm familiar with ash ketchum ( ketchim ? 
  ) , but who 's carmen sandiego ? 
  i googled it but all i can find is edutainment . 
  aaaaaaaand i see this * after * submitting that website here . 
  oh well , we 'll see how it does anyway !, 
  joke 's on you , this has already been submitted to [ my subreddit ] ( / r/karkat ) a while ago !, 
  somehow i ca n't help but feel that all those hugs were n't meant for me . 
  yeah !!!!!!!, 
   uphill both ways, 
  i suddenly do n't understand the metaphor . 
  are you saying redditors actually exaggerate the actual things that happened to them when they complain about how much harder their childhood was ? 
  if so , i do n't think this is the case . 
  ( unless you can link me some evidence , which i 'd love . ), 
  i can not * believe * all that html5 works on my shitty smartphone . 
  that 's okay , you 'll get better if you practice and take classes !, 
  i fucking suck at drawing , but i 'm looking to improve , and i will . 
  keep trying !, 
   real, 
  are there any cosplayers out there crazy enough to do that ? 
  that picture originally had john 's mouth upside-down from what i see here , right ? 
  these are so stupid . 
  i have n't ever heard any puns that are worse than these . 
  i never knew it was possible to have puns this shitty . 
  ... of course , that 's what makes this post awesome . 
  submit it !, 
  the most interesting part about this is that this is website is apparently the guy 's full profession !, 
  i 'm not sure whether that 's lame or really cool . 
  does anyone else think the interface is way too cluttered and seizure inducing ? 
  [ sort of like this parody ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002725 ) and the following page . 
  i think i could make parallax scrolling spacey images like that , too . 
  but i would n't . 
  rufio is alive !, 
  quick , fix his eyes !, 
  fuck you . 
  just because we do n't want her around does n't mean we ca n't be accomodating . 
  that would be rude of us . 
  wait , really ? 
  i thought they at least understood the concepts they were extolling . 
  example plz ? 
  but then there 's the argument that you ca n't really discuss that . 
  he is literally fat . 
  because karma . 
  [ say hello to my evil plan . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/myevilplan/comments/yz9x3/getting_reddit_to_do_something_good/ ), 
  how are they pluralized then ? 
  yeah , but it takes a while and requires me to move things around in my head . 
  i 'm lazy . 
  i * live * in glorious europe , and i say `` leg\u00f3k '' in my native languagr , which is equivalent to saying `` legos '' in english . 
  are you saying i should only say `` leg\u00f3 '' ? 
  that sounds stupid . 
  my quibble is that you can see kankri 's pockets , which you should n't be able to do , since his pants go up to his shoulders or something . 
  i know , right ? 
  i asked for it because i think it looks cool , but then later one of the mods ( dhamster i think ) pmed me that he 's gon na take it off , and i was like , `` alright , you must have a pretty good reason , '' and i have n't had comic sans since . 
  people actually pay attention to that stuff ? 
  a for effort , caliborn !, 
  pfft . 
  we call beijing `` peking '' !,
