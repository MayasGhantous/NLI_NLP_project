   - the pc gaming master race jerk ( you tried to play this mac compatible game on your mac and got an error ? 
  you are a literal serf for not buying a pc . ), 
  i thought reddit was anti-pc ? 
  i like how the op felt he needed to mention that he tweeted `` yolo '' . 
  it 's almost like a / r/circlejerk post . 
  he was drunk and was driving very fast . 
  i do n't feel very much sympathy for him , either . 
  just some . 
  i know . 
  it would n't make sense to say `` you are a literal serf for not buying a political correctness '' . 
  sorry , i saw a / r/circlejerk post that was parodying anti-pc , so i assumed that the thing that / r/circlejerk was parodying was a general reddit jerk . 
  / r/gonewild + circlejerk + atheism + gaymers ( click it for a good time ), 
  i love you , but you 'll never be as bad as / u/arrowstotheknee . 
  [ here 's mine . 
  ] ( http://seaquence.org/j25g ) i swear i 've composed much more impressive things . 
  cool !, 
  i never thought of arranging the dots logically like that . 
  i mostly just did geometric patterns or such . 
  why ? 
  he obviously never intended to be funny . 
  just annoying . 
  and it works . 
  so why stop ? 
  she is also a feminist and also goes around acting like everyone 's mother . 
  `` sexy '' is n't her only thing . 
  hence the white eyes . 
  being very annoying . 
  feel free to make it . 
  to be fair , it 's usually incredibly hard to identify whether something is wood . 
  or is it metal ? 
  i have no idea . 
  wait , why do they love chomsky then ? 
  what does he do outside of linguistics ? 
  as one whose first language is one whose number of speakers is actually declining , these people can go fuck themselves . 
  ( i am also very learned in linguistics ; i do field linguistics in my area as a hobby sometimes , most recently collecting phonetic data about slovak accents in hungarian . ), 
  despite not really being a linguist , i 've said `` as a linguist '' before , and i felt sort of horrible about it . 
  but i * do * know lots about linguistics !, 
  i really do !, 
  i even do field work , which can be fun . 
  i 'd just never want to make a living off of it . 
  i learned most things i know about linguistics from my mother ( who has/d a degree in it ) , and she brought up chomsky a lot , as you may imagine , and the closest i came to learning that he 's a political commentator was the following exchange :, 
  mike : so , is chomsky actually still alive ? 
  stef : oh , yes !, 
  alive and well . 
  mike : does he still do linguistics ? 
  stef : no . 
  mike : that 's too bad . 
  and that was that . 
  but anyway , it makes sense reddit would love him if he critiques the us . 
  i 'm not exactly surprised . 
  ahahaha no wonder then !, 
  i just wonder how he can keep their attention . 
  i always fall asleep reading his material . 
  i do n't think i 've taken in a single word of it . 
  ### how much karma ?????????? 
  that one had another sequel , * space trigonometry *, 
  not in the same vein , but dae napier rods ? 
  they 're like an abacus but way better . 
  mszegedy, 
  so , roughly twice as much as me . 
  [ here is my rebuttal . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/z5688/if_you_hate_reddit_so_much_why_dont_you_just_leave/ ), 
  but ... ... this is hosted on imgur . 
  yes , duh . 
  why , why did * you * go into neuroscience ? 
  they teach that now . 
  it 's called `` lattice multiplication '' . 
  * all * video formats use only the difference afaik . 
  do you know how ridiculously huge a video file would be if every frame was stored individually ? 
  like , say you have 30 fps video , consisting of bitmap frames , 8-bit color , 640x480 . 
  the size of 1 minute of video would be 1 byte times 640 times 480 times 30 fps times 60 seconds . 
  the end result is 552,960,000 bytes , or ~ 527.3 mb , or a little more than half a gigabyte . 
  not ideal at all !, 
  especially considering modern framerates of 60 fps and modern resolutions of 1920p . 
  kill me now if each frame is stored individually !, 
   i thought she only acted like a mother to kankri , i have n't seen her acting motherly to anyone else yet ( she even flirted with karkat a little if she was gon na be motherly to anyone else it would be him ) . 
  her conversation with karkat , and her conversation when you talk to her as latula make me think otherwise . 
   also having other aspects to her does n't stop her being sexy , if anything it makes her more interesting as she 's not just a one-dimensional character . 
  of course . 
  i was only posting a reminder that she is n't just `` sexy '' . 
  he never got to fly . 
  there are/were definitely at least two dream bubble jades running around somewhere : jade fron the doomed lifdoff timeline , as well as dream jade who then got brought back to life after an indeterminate amount of time . 
  lol risky click lol !!!!!!, 
  why do i have you tagged as `` hijack doctor '' ?? 
  the color is `` vomit '' btw, 
  ggggggggggggggggg !, 
  ggggggg !!, 
  [ here it is !!!, 
  if you expected never gon na give you up , you have failed as a redditor . 
  [ here you go !, 
  guys !, 
  skulls !, 
  i 'm placing a two way bet on the heir either being makara or ampora . 
  as opposed to captor . 
  nonedit : actually , just ampora . 
  you 're reading it wrong . 
  it 's 41.5 * kibibytes * , which is approximately 612 gigabytes . 
  i do n't understand . 
  [ 4chan , stop being an idiot .
