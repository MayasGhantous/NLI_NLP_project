  what flavor sauce would you like on that ? 
  it 's made primarily from gasoline ( what works in your car works on you ) , diamonds ( the more we put in it the more expensive it is , and therefore the better the cure is ) and lots of air ( the less you have it the worse you are , so the more you have of it the better you get ) . 
  actually , recently , researchers have been able to reduce a single atom to wyoming for nearly a millisecond . 
  they were lauded as being the first to artificially synthesize manmade wyoming in a lab , but it has been suspected for years that china has been continuously producing small amounts of antimatter in the state of wyoming for over three decades now . 
  estimates predict that a single gram of alpha-charged wyoming helium would cost nearly sixty trillion dollars , so such claims may be discounted as dubious at best . 
  move to some other country ; it 's normal there . 
  really ? 
  i believe the example in the guide uses less than that . 
  equius became kanaya 's server player before karkat could . 
  on a macbook pro it takes like thirty seconds before the menu screen loads . 
  it was my friend 's . 
  first time i ever played civ , not counting classic . 
  i was noob enough to open it in window mode the first time , so we had to quit and restart it again to do it fullscreen . 
  those two intros constitute my entire experience with civ intros . 
  native hungarian here : til that the locative for `` p\u00e9cs '' is `` p\u00e9cset '' ( the accusative case ) . 
  i thought it ran well , just the cutscene took long .

  why thank you, 
  so appropriate, 
  it 's easier if you replace the for loop with six and gates and a couple repeaters,

  this is why italian restaurant owners are typically retired physicists, 
  recessive genes ; it was n't expressed in his parents , just a grandparent or somesuch who did n't come out, 
  go to shittyasksemantics , they could supply an answer probably, 
  they 're too unstable to be observed because their charge is n't a logarithm of pi, 
  you 're imagining it , there are no pain receptors in your eyes, 
  holy shit , you were serious . 
  why you got ta ruin my day, 
  actually , `` insane '' is of latin origin , and the city in question followed the rules of latin declension , so it was originally called `` sanis '' . 
  it became '' - sane '' in the word because it had to take the ablative case which ends in e. 
  i actually do use a macbook : the early 2008 version . 
  portal is completely unplayable on it ( it used to let me play it , but i could n't get any sound ; now i 'm locked out by default ) . 
  another friend of mine and i swapped steam ids so that i could play civ 5 ( and he could play portal ) , and it runs basically fine . 
  my specs are basically the same as yours ( 2.26 ghz , and ram is ddr2 which means halved access speed ) . 
  my hard drive is nothing special ; it 's 500 gb , and 5400 rpm . 
  what am i doing right ? 
  ( note : graphics card crappy as fuck , intel gma x3100 144 mb ) . 
  [ ah , the old reddit switch-a-roo .

  i like it a lot , but there are n't enough abruptly blocky structures like in minecraft and the real world . 
  but still pretty awesome !, 
   - adds +45 buildings , +150 creatures , +160 plants , +120 trees , +25 intruments , +85 toys , +85 food types ,, 
  +85 weapons and armor , +75 engravings , +250 pref-strings , +20 civs . 
  the amount of stuff in dwarf fortress is already pretty overwhelming for me ; i do n't think i could stomach all of these new additions . 
  it 's worse in safari ; each link opens in a new tab . 
  edit : huh , a downvote for having a mac . 
  probably . 
  do n't worry , i use windows , too . 
  hmm ? 
  i got the impression that the person hugging the creeper was male . 
  how did this nomenclature come to be ? 
  oh , i 've always loved this video . 
  i was just never able to acquire this music . 
  makes sense . 
  i vote to rename the `` lipid raft '' the `` lipid blimp '' . 
  it 's nice when these entries end on a high note . 
  the sort of fax machine that makes horrible screeching noises on the network when in use ?

  do you have a mason ? 
  if not , awaken someone 's interest in masonry with, 
  v -  [ navigate to dwarf about to be made mason ] -  p -  l [ this is a lowercase l ] -  [ navigate to stoneworking ] -  [ navigate to masonry ] -  enter -  enjoy your new mason, 
  and it has a cape , too !, 
  that 's awesome ... 
  what am i looking at for the second video ? 
  by the way , i 'm planning to test the ai i 'm building with minecraft as well . 
  really ? 
  \\* friendly eyebrow raise * why does no one else complain about it then ? 
  i think it would help if it used actual unicode graphics . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love texture packs ( not to use ; i prefer the ascii ) , but i think it would save a lot of processing if rather than loading an image , it would just use proper characters . 
  no thanks, 
  for shaem, 
  oh , makes sense ; i had `` mute '' on .

  then again , it appears in such messages ... 
  holy shit . 
  my record is , like , three tabs . 
  he says that there are adequate materials . 
  and this sort of thing is why i want to move thither . 
  and will do so , as soon as i finish my secondary education ( over a decade of med school and such ) . 
  no video yet , sorry !, 
  i do n't have that much coding done ; i 'll only be able to test the ai once it is nearly done . 
  i can hear his voice with perfect clarity as i watch this gif, 
  no , no , it 's portal 2, 
  from what ? 
  hello i am a person who hates xkcd ; downvoooooootes, 
  \\* so worth it *, 
  newest comic was okay though, 
  niggers, 
  no , it autodetects my specs , and determines that they are too crappy to run portal .
