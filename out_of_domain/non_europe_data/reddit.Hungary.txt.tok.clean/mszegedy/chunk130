  the `` trends '' is a na\u00efve calculation based on old data and the growth so far . 
  to see an actual `` projection '' , click one of the red tabs . 
  unfortunately , there is as of yet insufficient data for a projection , because the project has n't been going on for even 24 hours . 
  then again , i * would * be rapt for a homestuck movie . 
  ( a * really good * one , of course . 
  lasting at least 6 hours . ), 
  it 's okay that that 's not happening , though . 
   144 ways to play the game, 
  168 ways . 
  personality tests always suck . 
  always . 
   the first redditor to actually cash in his karma for a real reward, 
  second . 
  early on , once , a redditor complained about not being able to cash in his karma , and got reddit merch for it . 
  it 's crazy how everyone knows his name . 
  i know , right ? 
  not everyone can use `` inspect element '' . 
  it takes a special kind of computer user to do it . 
  keep in mind that this is n't going into hussie 's personal bank account for use by him . 
  this is strictly for funding the game . 
  who are you roleplaying * now * ? 
  let me reaffirm that this needs a fucking gif . 
  augh , not microwave . 
  do n't you dare put that in a microwave . 
  bad things will happen . 
  because that 's too fucking much . 
  i do n't want to underestimate the homestuck fandom , but $ 4,130,000 does n't exactly seem realistic , given our currently relatively glacial pace . 
  right . 
  but the point is , we ca n't say `` aaaaaaaand hussie is now a millionaire '' . 
  it 's not his money . 
  oh god , did n't bill watterson specifically say not to put his comics on the internet like that ? 
  they should fix that in the css , if possible . 
  all of the other subtle improvements are really cool , and i do n't think anything 's stopping them from making another one . 
  he 's not a troll . 
  his sarcasm is real . 
  he really does disagree with you to the extent of putting his opinions on the internet in this form . 
  but he * does * have too much free time , and there are much better ways to express disagreement than capslocked sarcasm . 
  maybe he should try actually arguing his point . 
  but yelling is easier . 
  do you think it 's bad ? 
  are you sure ? 
  that metal looks suspiciously conductive . 
  but ... 
  i 'm a hipster and i freely admit it . 
  does that make me not a hipster ? 
  ( also , would n't this make most teenagers hipsters ? ), 
  yourself , then , evidently . 
  except you also have a quirk ( capslock minus punctuation ) . 
  also you get the kickstarter exclusive print . 
  which is , well , swag . 
  ahahaha think of prospit and derse and the battlefield , the fractal geometry does n't stop from getting deeper, 
  well , obviously not blow up . 
  just spark 'n' shit . 
  maybe catch fire a little . 
  the site , if anything . 
  the counter is designed not to break . 
  [ right here ] ( http://worldofsolitaire.com/ ), 
  sure , but that limit is somewhere in `` andrew hussie is the world 's third largest economy '' territory . 
  a longint will overflow at somewhere around 800 million , but that 's minimal compared to how far ahead kickstarter has conceivably planned . 
  do you really think they 'd let the biggest feature of their website break that easily ? 
  special kind of computer * user * . 
  not everyone 's up to the task . 
  to be fair , you also get to discuss it in this thread . 
  the link karma is just a bonus . 
  wow , when i saw the thumbnail i thought it was some sort of really special nudibranch . 
  this is great !, 
  you should xpost . 
  it to / r/marinebiology . 
  ( shameless plug , too ), 
  * in what fucking way is this * ableist ? 
  * do you know what 's ableist ? 
  assuming that i can listen to the shit that comes out of your mouth . 
  i just do n't like it when people get the wrong impression of me . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( also ^ ^ ^ thank ^ ^ ^ you ! ), 
  okay , but at the time of this writing , we have n't even made it to $ 600,000 yet . 
  ( although we 're [ extremely close . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uenll.png ) ) it 's not even a guarantee that we 'll make it to $ 700,000 . 
  ( a sad thought . ), 
  90 % of people who wanted to donate have already donated , in the first day . 
  homestuck fandom function . 
  i do n't know , but i want to see whether it syncs to my timezone . 
  let 's agree to disagree and say chrome is better . 
  [ ( heheheheheh ) ] ( / gt ), 
  i have no rage for it whatsoever . 
  in fact , i specifically tried to phrase it so it emphasizes how friendly i 'm trying to be in expositing my opinion . 
  i 'm not going `` raughaurgh valve jokes are the stupidest shit ever , you should be fucking banned from this subreddit '' . 
  if you * really * want to make valve jokes , i can get over it . 
  i just wanted to voice my displeasure with a little bit more than a downvote . 
   some say she should be setting an example during tough economic times . 
  pfft , `` some say '' . 
  now we know * this * particular newspaper 's ( or , in any case , newswriter 's ) slant . 
  actually , i do n't think it 'll go into hussie 's personal account . 
  if what pumpkin has an account ( bet it does ) , maybe it 'll go there . 
  or maybe it 'll go in the indie developer 's account . 
  each other option is infinitely more likely than andrew 's . 
  i never really understood the difference between the two subreddits . 
  i mean , you can explain to me the differing philosophies of the two and how you 're supposed to submit different things and all that , but that still wo n't make me understand the * practical * difference . 
  they 're both aggregations of good , long , interesting comments . 
  thought-provoking , if you will . 
  circlebrokers have different opinions than the rest of reddit ?
