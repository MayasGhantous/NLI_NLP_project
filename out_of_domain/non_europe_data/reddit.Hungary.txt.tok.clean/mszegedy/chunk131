  have you seen the post where / u/erotic _ reply complained that people always expected him to do his novelty act ? 
  let 's hope you do n't get the opposite of that : everyone complaining when you even * mention * bravery . 
  [ deleted ], 
  all i see is a disgusting little noisy shit who drools , makes messes , and generally destroys everything . 
  i want to slap the little fucker across the face . 
  ( / s , he 's adorable ), 
  i actually have no idea what happened here . 
  i was only able to reply via sw33t h4xx . 
  anyone have any information ? 
  for some reason , i trust you * a lot * . 
  ah , thank you for providing a more informed opinion than mine . 
  many different standards and formats to choose from ? 
  just like it should be !, 
  ( also , the ultimate uncompressed video : gif . ), 
  `` the forums '' ? 
  latin does n't even have an empty verb . 
  you should feel bad for using * faci\u014d * as one , a verb * loaded * with meaning . 
  instead , say `` eg\u014d . '', 
  i wish i had the money for the $ 5k . 
  i 'd commission a b&w of all 48 players from the session that made the troll universe , with each player labeled with their name and title . 
  i 'd tell him to draw two of each player , one in in their normal clothes and the other in god tier . 
  me too !, 
  i thought i was only going to get the $ 100 tier , but a friend made a generous donation and now i have $ 250 . 
  i was one of the last ones to get it before it sold out !, 
  do you think i should be greedy and look towards the $ 400 tier ? 
  you mean $ 405 ? 
  shit , now it 's fucking gone again . 
  what part is kankri ? 
  where 's that picture of aradia when you need it ? 
  it 's amazing how convincing this comment sounds . 
  every comment in your history has the word `` horse '' in it , if you count your username . 
  by the way , are n't you guys losing money over this ? 
  like , i pledged $ 250 , and i get whole bunch of stuff : a scalemate , 4 pins , a tote bag , a tee shirt , a print , plus the game merch . 
  i know this is exclusive stuff , so i do n't really know how to calculate the `` normal '' cost , but are n't you selling this at a discount ? 
  how much money does it take to produce , say , a scalemate ? 
  if we keep going at the same rate , it should take like another day . 
  oh right !, 
  i completely forgot about that asteroid !, 
  but we know it 's not a sburb asteroid because those come out of portals , not deep space . 
  but then it wo n't get released for [ obscure video game platform ] !, 
  not really . 
  it 's just 8312 - ( 2,301 +1838 +304 +727 +144 +1 ) = 2,997 . 
  which , okay , is a pretty huge number , but it 's much less than 8,000 . 
  yeah , but the destructive ones only appear after people have started playing the game . 
  one thing i * like * about homestuck is the * lack * of pop culture references . 
  i mean , there 's certainly no shortage , but they only make up about 5 % of the thing and the rest is all a self-contained story . 
  not understanding them does not get in the way of the story whatsoever . 
  i agree that homestuck is n't complicated or deep , but it 's not the * pop culture * references that make up the thing . 
  ( unless i 've somehow managed to stay completely oblivious to the vast majority of them , which is a possibility i will permit . ), 
  when things happen in the same universe , there is . 
  that 's not what we 're saying . 
  we do n't like it when they assume that * only * the baby 's mother thinks it 's cute , and it is in fact repugnant to everyone else . 
  ah , the old reddit switcheroo ... 
  ggg ? 
  one that flashes ? 
  i do n't really get it , whatsoever . 
  wow , some people are seriously of the opinion that it 's irresponsible to donate to the kickstarter until you actually know exactly what it 's going towards ? 
  what jerks !, 
  i 've been waiting for a long time for an opportunity/excuse to throw a bunch of money at hussie , because i 've always felt that he deserves more for his webcomic than just what he has . 
  in other words , i appreciate homestuck enough to pay for it !, 
  it 's not about the game at all . 
  i 'm donating money * in retrospect * after having gotten to read and appreciate homsetuck for three years . 
  just like you said : it 's a thank you !, 
  to hussie !, 
  i 'm certainly excited for the game , but i feel they 've really missed the point . 
  it 's not impossible . 
  just use an [ arduino lilypad ] ( http://arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoboardlilypad ) . 
  it 's specifically designed for that sort of thing . 
  you 're supposed to sew it into clothing . 
  it 's exact purpose is flashing colors in clothing . 
  it 's got 14 output pins , so two or three of these are enough for a cairo overcoat . 
  i 'd do it with two , one for each side . 
  [ ( more accesories for the lilypad can be found here . ) ] ( https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/135 ? ), 
  more likely to get a pyralspite ? 
  why ? 
  but why pyralspite ? 
  [ this is his kickstarter profile . 
  ] ( http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/400614200 ), 
  i might use it for a cosplay sometime . 
  i 'd also be worried about the $ 10,000,000 and $ 100,000,000 tiers . 
  they can be used to spread some sort of message , and there 's pretty much no limit on how long you can make it . 
  people will read it just for the sake of reading it . 
  if i had that opportunity , i 'd use the fuck out of it . 
  i do n't know what i 'd say , but it would definitely be some sort of lengthy dissertation on some topic or other . 
  if you knew ten thousand or more people were going to read what you 've written , what would you write ? 
  yeah , that 's the most important one . 
  besides that , you should also read the comment about the troll being thief of hope . 
  and rose presumably wore a clubs shirt once , though we do n't get to see that . 
  right . 
  that 's why i specifically stated `` the person 's name '' as opposed to `` his name '' . 
  i do n't think pc sj is inherently wrong . 
  `` sappy '' need not apply , or may not necessarily be a bad thing . 
  the only time when it 's bad is when they think that \\* all this * makes them better than everyone else . 
  which is wrong . 
  also , he uses an annoying ( though at least legible ) typing quirk . 
  that 's not very mature of him . 
  nonono , you 're reading it wrong . 
  the person who created the fantroll is named jedidiah long . 
   like i said , she 's like me ... as i said , mary sue-ish . 
  either this person does n't know what mary sue means , or is so full of * hir * self that i want to throw up .
