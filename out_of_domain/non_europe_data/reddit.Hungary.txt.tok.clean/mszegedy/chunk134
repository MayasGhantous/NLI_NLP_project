  probably because the game is n't a corporealization of sburb , but a little adventure game that tells a story . 
  like earthbound !, 
  man , i 'd totally play it if it was anything close to a homestuck-themed remake of earthbound . 
  i enjoyed that game so much . 
  i 'd enjoy this one , too , if it were like that . 
  we 'll probably choose one , the same way we 'll choose tshirt ( tee shirt ? 
  t-shirt ? 
  t-shirt ? 
  t-shirt ? ), 
  sizes and whether we 'll get a gamebro or gamegrl tshirt . 
   new to reddit, 
  i 'll have you know i 'm a member of / r/circlebroke , / r/circlejerk , etc. 
  etc. ... ( do n't worry i 'm not offended ), 
  i know what that is , and i do n't think it has anything to do with it . 
  john is also the youngest of the four , so jade would be fifteen as well . 
  we already know that particular thing , though . 
  there is a dave sun under the beat mesa , and that 's about it . 
  it 's not mainstream yet , do n't worry . 
  the mainstream hates it . 
  i was n't cool enough to be in it . 
  do n't forget the warehouse fire ( s ) . 
  i like it a lot . 
  it 's a perfect place to learn about how to make small talk . 
  you could name it that , in fact . 
  / r/smalltalk . 
  except that was already taken up by the subreddit about the programming language . 
   regrettably , i 'm far too negligent when it comes to the interior . 
  that 's pretty common , from my experience . 
  are you offended that i called your post a circlejerk ? 
  i apologize if you are . 
  aaaaaaaand ... ... 
  andrew confirmed that he had n't seen it . 
  do n't ask me for a source , though : i 'm horrible at indexing the formsprings and stuff . 
  wow , 16 ? 
  that 's surprising . 
  i thought it might have been slightly older . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  tell me though , how do you spell `` tshirt '' ? 
  get on with it , windbag . 
  that 's the funny thing , i 've always assumed it was true , but then i asked / r/classicalmusic what are some actual `` bad '' pieces of classical music ( since my tastes are confined to that genre but pretty much indiscriminate within ) , and they could n't list me a single example . 
  it 's the darndest thing . 
  well , preexisting jerks notwithstanding , the reason i called it a circlejerk because its sole purpose is `` hey guys we 're so great '' . 
  i happen to agree , though , so i 'm not annoyed in the least . 
  well , pre-order one . 
  also they 're signed . 
  that 's not even the problem . 
  no , because no one on reddit cosplays valve and produces like 200 mb of fanart per day on total , 50 mb of which is porn . 
  and also they 're much louder and more obnoxious and unforgiving . 
  reddit at least likes to pretend they 're le gentlemen . 
  it 's because the fandom is horrifying and essentially does n't deserve it . 
  ( not that i support this view . ), 
  i oppose marijuana legalization . 
  drop some numbers on me . 
  thread b had , at least , better pictures . 
  i mean , pictures that conveyed more information . 
  thread a `` after '' had only the girl 's face , which , while is an okay source for judging a person 's weight , would be loads more clear if augmented by a picture of the body itself . 
  thread b had carefully lined-up pictures , with the kid standing in the same pose for each one , clearly displaying the stomach outline so that you may easily see how it changed over time . 
  good god why do i do this . 
  they alchemized some timetables . 
  ( since davesprite gave his to dave i believe . ), 
  [ do n't forget this . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/zjfnz/update_7172_a6i3/c658151 ), 
  they 're not really `` activists '' . 
  i do n't think they fall under any sort of nomenclature . 
  it 's just a general `` you 're doing x , why do n't you do y instead which will help the world much more '' . 
  which appears always . 
  i 'm talking about the majority ( or rather , `` mainstream '' ) of reddit ; it would be more appropriate to cite / r/gaming . 
  * never * complain about downvotes !, 
  but i 've already said that i do n't mean `` better '' !, 
  i mean `` more informative '' !, 
  but even that 's not what i wanted to say . 
  the thread b pictures do a better job of fulfilling the purpose of the post than the thread a pictures . 
  the purpose was to show how much weight the subject lost . 
  thread a presents an inherently poorer metric than thread b , because it 's harder to tell how much weight was lost !, 
  we already know that from the last thread . 
  because we do n't want to see posts like this . 
  though , i personally usually do n't visit this subreddit , because i think it 's irretrievable . 
  maybe i should visit / r/gaming more often , so as to stay informed . 
  but it seems to me that reddit is still more screenshots 'n' memes-oriented rather than fanart 'n' cosplay-oriented . 
  ( though that is a cool tf2 cosplay further down this subreddit . ), 
  i mean , check out / r/valve . 
  it 's all news articles and references , as opposed to fanart and cosplay and like fifty injokes . 
  but / r/valve might not be as good as a sample that represents all of reddit . 
  let 's look at / r/gaming instead . 
  the 3 highest valve-related submissions are only found in the 40 highest submissions ( this is abnormal : is there something going on ? 
  ) , and the highest is a cosplay ( a good one too ) , but the second is a screenshot of less well-acknowledged part of the game , and the third is a post about a mod for hl2 . 
  this does n't mirror homestuck behavior at all !, 
  homestuck readers tend to spend more of their time writing about their ships and making one-sentence exclamations on the latest update , and besides that getting their fanart and cosplay on all the time . 
  if you look at a random homestuck fan on tumblr , it 's safe to say that they have at least drawn something homestuck related once . 
  substitute `` redditor '' for `` homestuck fan '' , and `` valve '' for `` homestuck '' , and you do n't get true statements . 
  i only upvote posts with the letter v in the title . 
  should i be considered when talking about the success of submissions ? 
  you ca n't say , `` well , it was unjustified because they could have had different standards . '', 
  while people may judge posts somewhat differently from each other , taking a general , reasonable case of that judgement is n't invalid just because all of the standards are subjective . 
  people look for certain things . 
  ^ ( ( also that was extremely condescending !, 
  ... so , you * want * to see posts like this one ? 
  finally . 
  i have no reason not to convert to linux now , seeing as though the only video game i 'm interested in is available for it . 
  yes , that 's what i was expecting , considering that one of the part-pickle gifs was posted in one of the update threads .
