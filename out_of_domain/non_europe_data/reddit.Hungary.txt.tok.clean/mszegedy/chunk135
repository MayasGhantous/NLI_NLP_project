  so , then the article is wrong about encode being responsible for the discovery ? 
  i never blamed anyone !, 
  i just said that they were different . 
  i * like * cosplay and fanart and fanmusic and one-sentence reactions to the update and unreasonable theories and unreasonable ships . 
  hint : never say `` mature for my age '' . 
  it 's unoriginal . 
  something like it ( but not exactly so ) resurfaces every few weeks or so . 
  `` every time i play a multiplayer fps , it seems like the opposing team is very coordinated , while my team refuses to cooperate at all !, 
  in fact , i 'll show you in metaphorical pictures . '', 
  that exact same thing . 
  but maybe with a different font or different pictures . 
  it 's a very common and very boring sentiment . 
  why ca n't people come up with better content ? 
  armchair activists are people who pretend to be * all about * complex world issues , and bring them up all the time , but then never actually do anything about them themselves . 
  some of the responses probably come from these guys , but some of them might also come from real activists , and most of them come from people simply exercising common sense without any deep thought . 
  `` wow , you guys are willing to donate so much to a game , but not to xyz charity ? 
  how selfish . '', 
  you do n't need to be any sort of activist to follow this train of thought . 
  just know that there are some causes that help the world and require money . 
  will there be written assignments ? 
  i hope there are . 
  why ca n't i downvote it * and * complain about it ? 
  complaining might be more effective if op or other pople read it . 
  i could always be doing something better with my time . 
  if i wanted to make the best use of my time , i 'd never visit reddit !, 
  but since i * am * visiting reddit , i want to at least give feedback on it so as to improve my experience . 
  \\* shrug * complaining is , at least , cathartic if nothing else . 
  yes . 
  not the entire thing , though . 
  you 'd still have to look for it !, 
   you can be a jerk completely anonymously, 
  this is the problem with the entire internet in a nutshell . 
  though , i feel that it 's possible for metareddit to completely misrepresent someone , like , for example , [ me ] ( http://metareddit.com/stalk?user=mszegedy ) . 
  over half of the subreddits it displayed for me are ones i 'm not even subscribed to !, 
  fffff , jjjjj , ooooo ... that was just one round of linkwriting . 
  worse , it included / r/askreddit , / r/gaming , and / r/atheism , which i do n't want anything to do with . 
  i similarly deny connection to / r/circlebroke2 and / r/circlejerk . 
  what my primary reddit experience really is is hanging out on / r/homestuck , reading submissions from / r/biology , / r/astronomy , / r/math , and / r/chemistry , and occasionally reading the latest complaints in / r/circlebroke and checking out the threads they reference . 
  i am not , as metareddit would suggest , about fun and games and cynicism at all . 
  i guess the lesson is that you should n't read too much into it , but then what 's it for ? 
  i do n't mind it enough to want to change it . 
  like i said , i hardly ever visit / r/gaming . 
  the action that i took was unsubscribing . 
  but it 's still somewhat sad to occasionally visit and see that it has n't improved . 
  but i 'd never try to actually `` take action '' ( whatever qualifies as that on reddit : write a scathing self post about addressing some issues in the subreddit ? 
  bribe/blackmail the moderators ? 
  email the reddit admins and petition for ownership of the subreddit ? ), 
  against it . 
  it 's a harmless internet website . 
  i do n't need to be part of it . 
  i 'd also like to disagree with your implication that it 's always better to `` take action '' straightaway than to complain about it . 
  complaining about it makes it more tolerable , to the point where you may agree to just leave it alone for everyone who enjoys it to enjoy . 
  enforcing your ideas upon other people is usually not actually a good thing . 
  also , complaining takes less time than doing . 
  i tend to be very busy a lot of the time ( although not presently ) , and i may not have time to `` take action '' ( though i still do n't know how i would do that , considering that the mods rule the subreddit for the most part and besides that it 's the enthusiastic voters who are upvoting bad content and the shitty submitters who are submitting it ) . 
  however , raising the issue may motivate other people who * do * have that time to put in the time necessary to try to change the subreddit . 
  then , it works out better for both of us because i do n't have to sacrifice any of my time , those who feel so strongly about it get to affect it , and both of us see a change for the better . 
  school . 
  ca n't you just defragment it ? 
  what 's in it ? 
  it could be the name of a game or something . 
  ggggggg ggg ggg gggggg gggg gggg . 
  ggg [ g ] - [ g ] = ( ggg - 1 ) [ g ] . 
  i can certainly imagine these people existing in real life . 
  boy , that was in * this * thread ? 
  sorry about that . 
  i was being mostly sarcastic/agreeing with the jerk . 
  hooray !, 
  i admire you for your ability to change your mind . 
  people rarely do that sort of thing . 
  but the traits that change do n't seem to be visible . 
  he is also not a pirate but a skipper . 
  / r/minecraft , remember it ? 
  wow , this really gave me a lot of insight into the drawing process !, 
  god dammit , i thought we were finally going to get actual dialogue !, 
  damn you hussie . 
  also , i agree with op : i liked the movie , too !, 
  wow , i hope this new medium works out for hussie . 
  ( and then '' [ s ] john : take bite of apple . '', 
  happened , and it was the best thing ever . ), 
  i 've always wanted to see a sea butterfly . 
  i 've also always wanted to taste one . 
  i do n't see anything 3d-modeling-like about it , crappy or otherwise . 
  maybe you 've been playing too much n64 ? 
  there was n't enough time to win . 
  the spamfilter identifies actual content , and carefully filters it out . 
  and of course , we have those too . 
  got ta find the damn things first , though . 
  quake 3 was for the guy giving away copies of minecraft . 
  i 'd like to be a time player but i think the most likely title for me is seer of mind . 
  i 'll still play , though . 
  if / r/gaming were leaking , it would n't be in paragraphs . 
  the hell kind of material is that , anyway ? 
  it really does make you look like a plastic figurine . 
  ( not that that 's bad in any way at all . ), 
  why ? 
  redglare was serious . 
  latula was n't , but they 're two different characters . 
  that 's okay . 
  we 're accustomed to waiting long periods of time for hussie .
