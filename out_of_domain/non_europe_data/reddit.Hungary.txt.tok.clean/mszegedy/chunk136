  i consider my gaming rig to be worthy of good games , and yet i ( will ) have only put a physics simulator ( sandbox universe 2 ) , minecraft , and [ a game that will be released in 2014 ] ( http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/14293468/homestuck-adventure-game ) on it . 
  why ? 
  once i spent my savings on the rig itself , my slow trickle of money ( somewhat because i 'm a lazy asshole ) has n't been enough to pay for actual games . 
  ironically , i had a substantial amount of money to potentially spend on games , but i donated all of it ( $ 261 ) to the aforementioned kickstarter , because i have been enjoying its author 's content for free for a long while now ( well , it was ad-supported , but come on , how much revenue could i possibly have generated ? 
  a few dollars , at most ) . 
  besides that , since making the rig , i have experienced a general lack of interest in any games whatsoever . 
  this is n't bad , obviously , but it does put me in the category of people with a good rig but no games to play on it . 
  i 'm fine with it , though . 
  this is me , and i 've used this justification to pirate a little in the past , but i do n't think my demographic is that small . 
  i have next to no money ( but bed and board and a bright future ) : is that really so uncommon ? 
  exactly . 
  i 'm not seeking to justify pirating , but , coming back to your first point , if my pirating does n't affect the company at all ( assuming that i would n't have been able to buy the game anyway ) , why does it matter that i pirated it ? 
  at that point it 's just `` stop enjoying yourself '' . 
  jesus christ , a philosophical teenager . 
  ugh , actally running around irl ? 
  g , g !, 
  = * 1 * , g g + g ^ ( g ) . 
  gggg ? 
  ggg ggggggggg ... ... 
  i would have seconded this a while ago , but i 'm amazed at the sudden bump brought by the introduction of the slickpak . 
  now i 'd be more willing to say somewhere slightly north of $ 2m . 
  could you tell me about this math ? 
  i 'd like to do math on it as well , and so far it hinges on derivatives squared .

  dude , you can have all of my karma , if you want . 
  it 's really just an approval score . 
  not even that , because most of the time when you post something people do n't attach it to your name . 
  downvote , because terrible content . 
  i mean , look at our front page !, 
  hardly any discussion/recommendation/sharing of classical music anymore !, 
  edit : no , really . 
  would you rather have actual classical music submissions , or `` here is an image post of a musician or composer '' and `` here is an image post of a meme or something '' ? 
  i mean , recently our top post was a picture of a fucking cat which was only relevant because it was a famous composer holding it . 
  is that * really * what you want this sub to be ? 
  `` guys , i have a picture of xyz thing related to classical music , upvote me '' ? 
  ( and also , i have the right to downvote to affect the flow of content . 
  so do you , of course . 
  what * if * i downvote ? ), 
  are n't you treating him too much like an object ? 
  maybe . 
  consonant cluster marks have never been cooler . 
  the bravery of that thread is incredible . 
  i 'm very surprised no one 's called it out . 
  [ ] ( / sobrave ), 
  [ ] ( / r/magicskyfairy/faq #definitions ), 
  it 's interesting how the drawing tints her hair with her blood color . 
  her name is damara . 
  why ? 
  we 're about as sure about it as anything else . 
  we 're more sure about it than we were that caliborn is lord english before the a6i3 canvas came out . 
  it was n't a flash , since it was n't made in flash . 
  the technical and official term for an html5 object like than is an ( html5 ) canvas . 
  aranea and maybe dave and meenah talked about them as though they were one and the same . 
  not that i disagree with you , but i would like to point out that acting like a little kid is almost never viewed as a positive thing . 
  i have n't watched the movie , so i must ask , how did they sterilize it ? 
  surely not hot steam . 
  that would be too boring . 
  i have n't seen the series in question , but could n't you have `` ftp '' mean something else , and have the computer on the other end ( assuming it 's not also a shitty flip phone ) do the rendering work ? 
  they can [ pull information out of nowhere with an enhance function ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/zpxf4/biology_has_ruined_so_much_scifi_for_me/c66su4q ) ; what 's to say that the same mathematical loophole in that universe may be responsible for supercomputation that could potentially render the face in real-time ? 
  or , it does n't even have to be that advanced of a computer , depending on how bad a render of a face it is . 
  either way , it 's a finite amount of computation that may be performed however fast depending on context by the other end . 
  did it specifically imply/state that the centrifuge was an analytical machine ? 
  `` making some enzyme '' with it is ridiculous , but there 's plenty of things that i , for one , would need to `` get back to my lab to my centrifuge '' for . 
  specifically , things that require centrifuges . 
  are the nights 22 years long as well ? 
  would n't that make it at least somewhat , more than a bit , more plausible ? 
   `` shoot it through the mass spec '', 
  and it comes out the other side , or what ? 
  where was that one article written by a paleoclimatologist ( ? ), 
  on * the day after tomorrow * ? 
  \\* shrug * i was just curious . 
  you * should * feel sorry . 
  the hell kind of shitty joke was that ? 
  barely passable . 
  only eight or nine people got it !, 
  * eight or nine !, 
  * leave this subreddit and never come back again . 
  next time i see you , i 'm reporting you to the moderators . 
  wow , what ? 
  really ? 
  source ? 
  the chart does , yes , but read the numbers in the top right corner of the chart . 
   designing a video game, 
  the game flashes/canvases certainly count . 
   managing a company, 
  he has whatpumpkin , and is certainly adept at managing , at least , a rabid fandom . 
  that 's different , though , obviously . 
   did we just throw this guy two million dollars and not check if he could actually do it ? 
  we gave him money because he has produced good , no , excellent content in the past , and he has promised to do so in the future if we gave him money . 
  he has a good track record at making us pleased : why would we doubt him now ? 
  ( allow me to answer that : because he 's transferring to a new medium . 
  well , that 's what we thought when he began homestuck , too !!! ), 
  man , hussie !, 
  why did you have to make a worthwhile ship canon ... and skip right over the part where it was in action ??? 
  not a real one , obviously . 
  okay , then we can properly get out the pitchforks . 
  the length of the ship expressed in time is the amount of time it takes light to travel across it . 
  so , not relativistically , the ship should last somewhere around .1 miliseconds . 
  no , i mean , if you look at time as a spatial dimension , then the amount of length that a time is equal to is equal to the amount of time it takes for light to travel it .
