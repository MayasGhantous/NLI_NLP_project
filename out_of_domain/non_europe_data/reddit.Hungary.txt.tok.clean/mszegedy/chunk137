  well , slightly more , because of relativity ( we are already moving at a tiny amount of speed ) . 
  i do n't want to explain how it works right now ( assuming you do n't know it ; maybe you do ? 
  ) , because it would be kind of hard to do and i 'm not sure i 'm up to the effort , but the point is that you can directly convert between time and distance and actually have it be true . 
  3 years is , in length , equal to 3 light-years . 
  but of course if you 're not talking about the literal length of the trip , but the `` length '' ( that is , time ) of the cruise , then disregard this sort of thing . 
  i just thought it should make more sense physics-wise !, 
  but okay , then . 
  hey , that comment was funny . 
  it was n't serious , but it did n't have to be . 
  i do n't mind that it was there . 
  why are all of these fantrolls seadwellers ? 
  is it more exotic to be a seadweller , or what ? 
  is it the royalty that appeals to people ? 
  that 's new . 
  this is ... old . 
  yeah , but afaik dante is n't poor . 
  go for a phd ? 
  the funny thing is that decks of cards usually sell for like $ 5 ( more like $ 2 over here ) . 
  keep practicing drawing !, 
  yeah , they 're only adding 50 at a time . 
  heheheh , [ suckers !, 
  ] ( / docscratch ), 
  what does `` tw '' mean ? 
  i think i realized it a few days before , but i 've forgotten it again . 
  i do n't know , i just remember seeing this before , multiple times , a long time ago . 
  it may not have been here , though !, 
  but ... the game wo n't directly involve any of the homestuck characters . 
  the only thing familiar within it will be elements consistent within sburb . 
  hussie said it 's a * new story * . 
  well , i did n't think you were being serious . 
  edit : [ yessssssss ] ( / ag ), 
  some of these are spot-on !, 
  karkat 's applies to him ( although a lot of these would apply to him ) , vriska 's is ... applicable , as is equius ' , eridan 's is exactly descriptive of him , and tavros ' is hilariously the opposite of him . 
  gamzee 's neither applies nor is in opposition to him . 
  see the other thread . 
  i want to go there so badly and say , `` as an engineer , this is totally true . 
  [ something about how easy engineering is and how little thought/creativity goes into it . ] '',

  you should enjoy / r/politics and / r/worldnews , then . 
  you do n't even * need * to read the actual article !, 
  fuck you !!!!!!!!, 
  all fundies , no , every skytheist should * literally * die . 
   one of the most inspiring treatise on the afterlife in the entire bible, 
  you think the bible has anything worthwhile to offer you ? 
  obviously a fucking skyfundie . 
  we elightened atheists do n't * need * the crutch of religion to tell us how to behave . 
  we can think for ourselves !, 
  that 's why i read so much carl sagan and follow neil degrasse tyson on twitter . 
  go on . 
  edit : oh , that 's what it means !, 
  stupid stupid dumb . 
  thanks !,

  edit : [ right here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/zrq0n/theres_another_fan_troll_thats_canon/ ), 
  it 's impossible to make a / r/atheism comment nowadays that 's so stupid that no one would believe that it is n't parody ... :(, 
  ( i mean who actually uses the term `` skytheist '' unironically ? ), 
  ahahaha , no problem . 
  always be on your guard here , i see ... 
   it 's the complete antithesis of what nearly every wise man the bible describes , who says , `` your ways are higher than mine . '', 
  heh , i try to believe this all the time , and it works in practice , but ... 
  i always have this doubt in the back of my mind . 
  `` what if i * am * right ? 
  is n't the point of believing something that you think it 's actually true and other things are wrong ? '', 
  i push this out of my mind , of course , but i do n't think i 've ever succeeded in being genuinely humble . 
   i believe in a kind , merciful , loving god , because i want to believe that the best things a person can be are inspired by something even better than what we can ever even hope to be . 
  a reason good as any !, 
  i believe in a god as well , but i doubt his kindness and mercy , because of the existence of suffering . 
  i 've never been fully satisfied with any theodicy i 've read so far . 
  i 'd buy the theodicy that says that we all need suffering in order to become better people if everyone suffered equally or proportionally to exactly how much they needed it - but they do n't !, 
  people instead suffer based on geographic location , which makes no sense from a moral point of view . 
  wow , we 're pretty much talking past each other here . 
  i needed to get that out , all the same . 
  it 's a joke !, 
  check your privilege !, 
  do n't go around saying trigger words like that . 
  thanks !, 
  is the demeanor also like kanaya ? 
  this sort of superfluous proclamation of something that happened to the person is indeed occasionally characteristic of kanaya , particularly when she is nervous . 
  `` ableist '' is an ableist slur ( to those unable to communicate whatsoever ) , check your privilege . 
  pfft , cds are outdated . 
  no one should have to use them anymore , now that we have wonderful things like usb and bittorrent !, 
  yeah , well , that 's obviously * wrong * , duh . 
  you saw it here first , folks : it 's `` instead of '' !, 
  do n't forget that * amnesia * is also an adventure game . 
  i would n't mind it if it were more flexible like that !, 
  too late !, 
  homestuck will be over by then !, 
  ( maybe ), 
  i 'd try a bar graph but it 's nearly midnight in est. 
  i want to state for the record that i never implied any scorn towards them in the title . 
  but anyway , what i personally feel is what you stated , only maybe stronger : why are they waging actual , multiparagraphed discussions in a kickstarter comments thread ? 
  i think what originally set them off was that the newest troll is gay , not bisexual . 
  but i mean ... jesus chris ...
