  i ca n't believe it got turned into such a `` federal fucking issue '' . 
  that 's okay by me ... it 's just weird , though . 
  ( however , i * could * argue about time and place , but really who cares . ), 
  yes !, 
  i ` da made it 2d , though . 
  solution : logarithmic scale . 
  you 're right !, 
  this is why i 'm torn about which medium i want . 
  on one hand , cds look awesome , especially if it looks like the sburb disc , but if i got it on a usb , then that would be the first game i own like that , plus it would be longer-lasting and generally more practical . 
  i guess you have to pay for impracticality ... after all , the most practical method , digital download , is also the cheapest . 
  wait , you 're from le sweden ? 
  you must be popular on reddit !, 
  edit : of course i do n't mean to disrespect your country or anything . 
  sweden is co ^ \\ ( ld ) ol !, 
  but you * really * must be popular on reddit . 
  man , now i 'm paranoid about whether your comment came first or mine !, 
  i think / u/astoyabi means that , if you did n't know about homestuck , you 'd assume meenah was male , not female . 
  as in there are n't enough sexually differentiating characteristics to tell that she 's female . 
  as opposed to that she 's simply too masculine for a girl . 
  allow me to present you the distilled form : ** so brave **, 
  i think it was the same person who kept doing it at the beginning . 
  ( the troll in question is another fucking seadweller . ), 
  what 's wrong with a word ? 
  it 's not a slur or anything . 
  how can you guys all sit there and look at food like that , throughout an entire game ? 
  i 'd eat first and * then * play . 
  i 'd never be able to play a game wherein the board was composed of food .

  man , how did they manage to fit an atheism jerk in there ? 
  i 've never heard of anyone pirating classical music . 
  but , anyway , yes , they , do pirate more , but the jerk here is that they 're assuming that other people do n't pirate because they 're * stoopid * . 
  i mean what kind of a stuck-up asshole do you have to be to believe that ? 
  depends on who played it . 
  if the recording is over 90 years old or something ( which is pretty much completely impossible ) then it 's free content . 
  * shrug * i have no idea what christian punk is , and i took it at face value . 
  i suspect many of the voters did as well . 
  it 's still an atheism jerk : after all , how much could people know about music that they do n't listen to ? 
  yeah . 
  what you were talking about at first was the score . 
  i have totally pirated scores before ( so fucking expensive ) , but never music , which happens to fall under the copyright of the recording , not the composer . 
  i assumed you thought that it applied to recordings as well . 
  right . 
  i mean , i just have n't heard anyone who was into classical talk about pirating it . 
  maybe they are ? 
  : / who knows . 
  i prefer legitimate acquisition ( if you can call sometimes ripping library cds legitimate ) , but i have n't actually ever asked . 
  well , i was also clarifying for potential onlookers who may have thought that . 
  i got the impression that you at least knew what you were talking about . 
  once i tried to pirate some erik satie . 
  i ended up with pretty much everything he had ever written except the piece i was looking for . 
  i 'm shitty at torrenting . 
  my country also lacks spotify , as well as pandora . 
  i do n't know what the former is , but also do n't really care . 
  i 'll check out grooveshark , though !, 
  it 's an automated algorithm . 
  it ca n't `` doubt '' . 
  only come to a conclusion based on data . 
  but maybe that 's not how it works !, 
  maybe it has a fixed dictionary of similar words , with immutable frequency values . 
  it might not be a sort of `` how many people search this '' thing at all !, 
  they have lan to play mmos with , so they definitely have * something * . 
  wait , really ? 
  the relation is that jerks are insensitive . 
  now the guessing game as to which kind of cancer davesprite has !, 
  skin cancer ? 
  testicular cancer ? 
  leukemia ? 
  i 'd program the best game . 
  or maybe do biological experiments on the sprites . 
  or physical experiments on the alchemiters and the items they produce . 
  if they have access to cruxite , i 'd also physically analyze the shit out of that . 
  maybe chemically too . 
  you 're just * waiting * for someone to ask you , `` huh ? 
  why ? '', 
  no one asked you !, 
  i do n't understand . 
  `` michael '' is one of the most common names in the usa !, 
  how do people still misspell it ? 
  ( i share it with this dude ! ), 
  this should be higher in the thread . 
  i said it ! ), 
  also it was originally a top hat, 
  instead of `` blackest heart '' , they should 've used some rendition of `` ruins '' . 
  i 'm one of the two who upvoted you , and i suspect that the other is whoever you replied to . 
  how is oag anything but `` internet/reddit-famous '' ? 
  her entire career revolves around reddit . 
  ### so brave, 
  yes . 
  those are stalked tunicates . 
  they are all the rage today . 
  ( if you look it up on wikipedia , the reference picture of course looks nothing like them . 
  but i assure you that those are stalked tunicates . ), 
  yeah , but that 's what we 're here to do . 
  they complain about it because they actually think that it 's actually important . 
  no one 's trying to feel `` better '' than anyone else ; but do n't pin us for hypocrisy . 
  or / u/shitty _ watercolour . 
  actually , any non-stem major . 
  it really sucks . 
  that was really shitty of you to say .
