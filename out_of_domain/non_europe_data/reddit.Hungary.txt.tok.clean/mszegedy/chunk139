  same as the one i punched into grapher the other day , let me give myself a moment to dig it up . 
  on the subject of how i set it to use parametric equations , i pressed `` mode '' , then went to the first item , something like `` graphing type '' , which was set to `` function '' , which i rectified to `` parametric '' . 
  then i went into the y = editor and put in the equations for x and y. 
  [ here 's the link !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/yh5he/success/ ) i put in `` 17cos * t * - 7cos ( 17 * t * / 7 ) '' for x , and the same thing for y except with sin . 
  huh . 
  never knew you were a fan of homestuck . 
  do you have an alternate account or something you use here ? 
  i want to be-lieve ... 
  `` goody two shoes '' ? 
  she was nice !, 
  why are you complaining about a troll being nice ? 
  excuse me but ~ ~ violet ~ ~ purple blood has psychic powers !, 
  they can solidify the object of a person 's nightmares , like gamzee did with the accursed mascot and john , and lil cal and dave . 
  this was useful to subjugglators who needed to pacify the population . 
  6 letter rule !, 
  `` atsknk tvegef '' will do . 
  or if you prefer, 
  i swear that was on there before ... not sure why it is n't now !, 
  fixed , derpe . 
  this is the mark of a true story, 
  then again , it takes far less than a day to read , and secondhand experiences have much less emotional impact than those experienced firsthand . 
  i do n't think this thread will turn down my month hardly if at all . 
  thanks for the compliment !, 
  i do try . 
  though posts like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/zu7fb/and_then_there_were_three_any_clues_on_the_newest/c68e31t?context=3 ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zraq2/too_goddamn_far/c68d0p8?context=3 ) do n't reflect very well on me . 
  but [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zw3re/overly_attached_lynchmob/c68cwo9?context=3 ) was intended to be entirely lighthearted !, 
  * a * penis . 
  it 's funny because of the coordination required to do it . 
  thousands of posts of people saying nothing but `` a penis '' ... that requires effort !, 
  it 's a bit beautiful how sometimes so many people can band together for a bit of fun . 
  it 's also immature , but can you think of a better answer ? 
  i mean , one that 's easy to read/comprehend ( and therefore simple to type out ) , as well as equally funny ? 
  [ instead of going to all that trouble ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/levenshtein_distance ), 
  it 's really expensive , though . 
  something to the [ tuna ] ( / ca ) $ 150 !, 
  i do n't think they even sell it in my country . 
  okay , okay !, 
  [ link to destination .

  i find it relevant to homestuck , considering all of those lines about networking problems and server overload . 
  now that i 'm in the ` states all of the ads seem to be in english . 
  cool !, 
  they 're fine relative to each other . 
  the setting does n't matter so much , besides assigning a sense of scale . 
  but we 're not trying to be extremely realistic here . 
  it sounds like it comes from some sort of syllabic asian language should be pronounced [ ` walnak\u025b ] or [ ` walnake ] . 
  i 'm * training * myself to mentally say , [ ` w\u0251lne\u026ak ] . 
  english , why your orthography got ta be so deep ? 
  it 's nearly up to my waist . 
  i think he knows that !, 
  it 's a clever result of `` working with the poor quality of the best don knotts image [ he ] could find for it '' . 
  i think it 's an ingenius solution !, 
  you should 've added some feather when cutting out the fur . 
  unless you like the effect ... ? 
  it 's hungarian for `` from [ szeged ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeged ) '' . 
  roughly . 
  the actual word is `` szegedi '' , which is also a common last name . 
  well , surname : we switch the order to make it sound like the surname is an adjective describing the given name . 
  the twist about my name is the `` y '' . 
  the letter is never meant to stand alone in the language , except at the ends of surnames . 
  if you have one instead of an `` i '' , it is an indication that you are of noble descent ( e.g. 
  [ r\u00e1k\u00f3czy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a1k%c3%b3czi ) ; the `` cz '' is also not normal for the language ) . 
  a long while ago , the noble families decided that they needed to sympathize with the masses more , so they changed their surnames to end with `` i '' . 
  sometime later ( or right around then ) , an unassuming scholar by the name of `` szegedi '' thought it would be cool to change his name to `` szegedy '' . 
  and that 's why i have this name !, 
  the letter `` s '' by itself is pronounced like english `` sh '' ( hereinafter denoted [ \u0283 ] ) , and digraph `` sz '' like english `` s '' ( hereinafter denoted [ s ] ) . 
  digraphs and trigraphs are considered individual letters . 
  if it 's long , [ s\u02d0 ] , it 's written `` ssz '' , not `` szz '' or `` szsz '' or `` sszz '' or anything like that . 
  that 's considered two letters ( and i know this because it 's not in the alphabet ) . 
  the problem is that some words also contain the sounds [ \u0283s ] , which is written the same way , but that rarely happens , so it 's easy to memorize . 
  there is also phoneme [ \u0292 ] ( the way the `` g '' is pronounced it `` fudge '' ) , written `` zs '' . 
  we also have `` dzs '' , pronounced like english `` j '' , or [ d\u0361\u0292 ] . 
  everything else is spelled and pronounced completely predictably , except that `` j '' and `` ly '' are both pronounced [ j ] ( like english `` y '' ) , although `` ly '' might be somewhat lateralized and pronounced like [ lj ] . 
  i specifically checked in the video . 
  it 's michael . 
   why ?? 
  [ there 's much much more ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/sfh0j/i_composed_a_grammar_and_vocabulary_system_for/c4dnf4y ), 
  he 's getting downvoted because he assumed that you can only interpret music if you 're high , rather than just educated . 
  i know * i * was offended . 
  we 'll be able to carry around at least five computers at a time , like sensible people . 
  but le is so much more awesome !, 
  wow , you 're so on top of this !, 
  how ? 
  shipping ? 
  who with whom ? 
  do n't forget / u/i _ rape_cats . 
  i 'm sort of sick of people using that comic as an argument . 
  try something else ; just because he might be dismissing us to feel better than us does n't necessarily invalidate what he actually said . 
  not that his argument being correct is what 's happening here . 
  if you can call it an `` argument '' . 
  but the comic is n't telling him that we 're all aware that we 're circlejerking . 
  it 's telling him that his argument is wrong because he 's using it to feel superior to us . 
  maybe it 's a case of [ jo\u0279 ] vs. [ jo\u0259\u0279 ] . 
  or [ jo\u0279 ] vs. [ j\u028fu\u0259\u0279 ] ( the / \u028f / usually is n't included in english ipa ; just a heads up ) . 
  either way , he is incredibly stuck up saying that , because he should know full well that it 's very common in english for them to be homophones . 
  or maybe they went to all the ones in middle school and determined that parties sucked . 
  ( i do n't exactly blame them . 
  i 'm not a party person either . ), 
  why would you want ar after you have vr ?
