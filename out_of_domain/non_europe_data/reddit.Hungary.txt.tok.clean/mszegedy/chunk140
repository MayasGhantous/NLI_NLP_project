   interesting that it neatly tapers off around 24 hours , i imagine it 's intentional . 
  i 'm almost positive that that 's because of constant 12.5 , which would bring down the coefficient to 1/100 by 25 hours . 
  / r/jailbait, 
  well , there was the whole snafu over / r/jailbait . 
  if they let that exist , why not / r/creepshots ? 
  i never knew that place had regular visitors ... 
  sounds ridiculously expensive . 
   [ if you are a muslim and are not actively fighting the radical elements in your religion they you are as bad as they are . 
  you are an accessory to crime .

  wow , this post was so bad that it managed to offend even * me * , a greek catholic . 
  i 'll bet he feels that this does n't apply to him because all radical atheists do is drink and talk about space . 
  edit : i like the reply , too :, 
   the thing is , the number of moderate muslims is much , much lower than certain factions wants you to believe . 
  i suddenly ca n't breathe ; i 'm drowning in references . 
  basically , it boils down to `` if you do n't fight evil then you 're part of it '' . 
  is this the `` with us or against us '' fallacy , or the false dichotomy ? 
   `` we have our own opinions and do n't want to hear others '' . 
  this is called a circlejerk . 
  ( though your account is five years old , so i doubt i need to tell you that . ), 
  i posted this in the facebook thread :, 
   this is incredibly offensive to christianity . 
  why would you insult our faith like this ? 
  we get it , you think evolution is real . 
  stop perpetuating a false idea . 
  what sort of evidence do you have for evolution ? 
  so far , not a single extinct organism has re-evolved yet . 
  also , if it takes `` hundreds of millions of years for a species to evolve '' , how can you say that humans are only a hundred thousand years old ? 
  the entire argument is stupid . 
  some things , you just * ca n't * explain with science . 
  like weather . 
  heh , greek catholic is the name of the subdivision , not the country . 
  i live in hungary , but am currently studying in the us . 
  hugs to you too !, 
  yeah , where was he during history class ? 
  do i really need to mention their early contributions to mathematics and science while europe was in shambles ? 
  [ like roman catholicism but different ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_catholic_church ), 
  / r/atheism does n't really elicit a feeling of `` superiority '' for me , rather one of `` complete irrelevance '' . 
  then why do you do it ? 
  i can understand and even get behind the reasoning for posting dissenting opinions there , but why read it if it 's painful ? 
  i 'm 100 % sure there 's something better you could be doing with your time . 
  we also have this thing called `` being a decent person '' . 
  you might be taking his comment a tiny bit too seriously . 
  i 'd never , ever , ever , ever , ever advise anyone to go `` kill themselves '' . 
  whoever wrote this needs to learn about human decency . 
  and the huge amount of emotional baggage that comes with suicide . 
  why are some of the characters useless , and some others completely overpowered ? 
  i 'd be happy with a white usb with a lime green spirograph on it . 
  when he was in office . 
  now that he is n't president , he 's smart . 
  but the point is that it 'll always be better to use certain characters over others . 
  regardless of pvp . 
  cherub genitals are shaped like spirals , so that they geometrically complement each other in a unisex fashion . 
  you 're welcome for that mental image . 
  do you like `` base_2 '' ?

  [ the meta pile does n't stop from getting taller ... ... . . ] ( / dunkass ), 
   just as bad as / r/atheism, 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  or how about unicorns and centaurs ? 
  huh ? 
  give the human imagination a little credit . 
  but if the idea of god is one invented completely by humans , how does that prove his existence ? 
  it 's a simple idea ... it 's not surprising that it would be independently come up with by many different cultures . 
  i ca n't speak for the 40 + upvoters , but every single one of the comments are pointing out that the logic used in it is bad . 
  also , [ be careful about singling out individual posts like that !, 
  ] ( http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/composition-division ), 
  we 're talking about * suicide * , and you 're telling me to `` loosen the fuck up '' ? 
  no , i know . 
  i was using one as a name for the other . 
  i was asking whether it was an example of it at all . 
  god dammit . 
  did you at least buy them ? 
  only the sburb players get dream bubbles . 
  nanna never prayed sburb : she never had a dreamself or anything . 
  when she died , she just died . 
  like bro . 
  the power of the wand came from all those angels he killed on lowaa . 
  doc scratch said so . 
  maybe she understands timeless physics ? 
  for reference , light travels just shy of 300 million meters per second . 
  that means it takes 3.3 nanoseconds to travel a meter . 
  ( or 3 nanoseconds to travel one yard , like [ here ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006190 ) . ), 
  this is why she 's a hero of space . 
  i wonder how much kanaya knows about physics ? 
  what about porrim ? 
  does he really need the hard drive space so much that he ca n't just put them in a separate folder ? 
  what a douche . 
  ( this is great by the way , kudos on the effort and creativity ! ), 
  guys , i think he was being sarcastic ... 
  oh okay , it sounded like you meant something else . 
  carry on then !, 
  well , i thought that you meant that the standard middle eastern person was `` buttbackwards '' in all his lifestyle and needed the `` enlightened world '' on the outside to tell them how to behave . 
  this is obviously pretty far from the truth : they 're just like us , mostly !, 
  but now i see that you meant that all of their political turmoil their * governments ' * ( or whatever ruling bodies ' ) collective faults , which is true to a great degree . 
  maybe they really * should * take clues from the more peaceful states of the world !, 
  `` reddiquette is dumb as fuck imho '' is n't exactly the pinnacle of content , either . 
  one thing though , `` flount '' is n't a word . 
  it sounds like it should be , though . 
  though , you do n't go on the internet to learn about history .
