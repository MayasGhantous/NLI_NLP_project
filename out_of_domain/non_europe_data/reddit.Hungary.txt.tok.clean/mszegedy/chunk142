  but seriously , so do you live in france or what ? 
  if not , how long 's it been since you moved out of the country ? 
  let 's downvote him more , though , because it 's funny . 
  morality is objective ? 
  news to me . 
  no , check the wiki . 
  what kind of chrome theme is that ? 
  i made my own and personally think it 's great , but i would still consider switching to this one . 
  dammit , the 0 key is in the far top left corner for me . 
  take on some sort of research internship that pays a weekly stipend . 
  that 's how * i 'm * paying for it , at least . 
  that would be if i had written `` knoww wwhether '' . 
  also , i fixed it to completely invalidate your comment . 
  what field do you want to go into ? 
  a work-in-progress that i 'm reading just produced one of the best quotes ever :, 
   '' ... and if you 've spent as long as i have staring futilely at the tsiolkovsky rocket equation wishing it was n't such a bitch , you 'd understand how much of a bitch it is . '', 
   `` actually , i have . '', 
   `` to get a delta-vee of four times the effective exhaust velocity we need fifty-to-one propellant-to-vehicle mass ratio !, 
  fuck that !, 
  you know this . '', 
  [ ( incidentally written by a homestuck ) ] ( http://qntm.org/space ), 
  this makes me unable to perceive the photoshop as anything but a white brush polluting a picture of mars . 
  upvoted because i agree . 
  upvote if you agree . 
  i really do n't think this is anything special , also having this `` gift '' ... but the replies convince me otherwise !, 
  way to make me feel good , i guess ? 
  i think i feel too neckbearded saying this . 
  * why * could n't i be physically good at something useful , something * respectable * ? 
  like fucking archery or some shit . 
  this is embarrassing . 
  `` look at me , i 'm good at * doors * ! '', 
   was n't there a thread a while back about how gross it is to breast feed your kid in a restaurant , because it 's body fluids or some other such bullshit ? 
  in this case , i do n't think the people involved in the reactions overlap . 
  though i would n't 've used `` selfish '' . 
  he does n't actually benefit from insulting other people . 
  it 's more like ... assholish . 
  no , listen , look what i can do :, 
  it 's the most wonderful feature of chrome !, 
  on second thought i 'll keep the one i made , but thanks !, 
  that 's actually surprising . 
  good . 
  oh , good !, 
  i 'm reassigning him to ' \u00f6 ' . 
  i know !, 
  i was saying it ironically , as an alternative to '' ** so brave ** '' . 
  okay , i 'll edit that in . 
  like so :, 
  upvoted because i agree . 
  upvote if you agree . 
  this is unfortunately our problem . 
  it 's mostly dispelled by reading the sidebar . 
  the ... 
  heir transparent ? 
  just about * everyone * except me was born in february . 
  how interesting . 
  read the fan adventure ''  be the seadweller lowblood . '', 
  it puts a lot more character into eridan , compared to how little screentime he gets in homestuck . 
  sollux , not so much . 
  he just gets plainer . 
  cool !, 
  both are interesting to me ( i wanted to minor in physics until it became apparent that that 's utterly impossible under a double major if i want to still have courses i take for fun , like `` mineralogy 101 '' ) , but my heart is set on biomedical engineering , which i will totally have a phd in in a decade or two . 
  where do you see yourself after grad school ? 
  personally , i want to research forever and ever , but maybe i 'll change my mind after getting to do a bit more of exactly that . 
  me too !, 
  amazing how we still have 1/2 off the kickstarter left over , though . 
  ( it seems like just yesterday that it started , too ! ), 
  i 'm using alienblue , so your trick does n't work , whatever it 's supposed to do !, 
  it 's easy to get the `` trend '' . 
  just take the amount of money the kickstarter has made so far , multiply it by 30 days , and divide it by the amount of time it 's been going on for . 
  it assumes that the amount of money that we make is overall linear , which might not be far from the truth on the long term , but it does n't work for short amounts of time like this . 
  i mean , hussie 's used pretty much all his cards now . 
  i expect the rate of growth to slow down * a lot * . 
  i know , right ? 
  it 's because of that one video that was made recently ( and has already been linked to you ) . 
  i mean , god dammit . 
  get alienblue or baconreader . 
  reddit was n't meant to be used from a phone browser . 
  but both question mark bullet points are filled in the $ 5,000 tier . 
  those were the slickpak and seerpak . 
  there do n't appear to be any such things anymore . 
  upvote this for visibility !, 
  forever and ever . 
  checkmate atheists, 
  also , `` vanilla '' is used as a descriptor of plainness for a lot of other things as well . 
  what exactly is `` free society '' ? 
  but how do i use it ? 
  this is n't fair until the rest of the a1 trolls are revealed . 
  1 now . 
  who was it ? 
  how can he be your * favorite * troll ? 
  makara seems to be one scary dude . 
  then that means i do n't know what prison rape is . 
  though sometimes the content is also ... a little eyebrow-raising . 
   another 1000 snoutpaks, 
  but then i 'd feel less special !, 
  ggg . 
  huh ? 
  how about, 
  ** `` some people , when confronted with a problem , think '' ** i know , i 'll use multithreading . 
  ** '' now have they problems two .
