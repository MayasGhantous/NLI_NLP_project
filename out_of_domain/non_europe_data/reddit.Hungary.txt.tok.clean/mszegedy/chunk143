  i actually like the style . 
  a bit like the papyrus font , but with better kerning . 
  that last picture was unforgivably blurry , though . 
  big plastic bags of water , hung up everywhere . 
  it actually works !, 
  hooray !, 
  it 's surprising how our subscriber count keeps growing , even during such unusual times . 
  let 's celebrate when we hit 6,120 !, 
  those are mathematically largely impossible to do it like that . 
  gradually changing any one or two or three values yields cool stuff , but not what is pictured on the loading screen in homestuck . 
  you 'd have to make them erratically , discretely jump from one value to the other . 
  i 'm sure you could compact that into some sort of function , but that would be too much work . 
  do n't even talk to me about rotations !, 
  ^ ( ( please note that i am in no way an expert in this ; i study cells for chrissakes ) ^ ), 
  but she ca n't do that to humans , unfortunately . 
  well , til . 
  ( sticking to alienblue though . ), 
  you could always become an astronomer . 
  all the astronomers i know were physics majors . 
  i would n't recommend it , though , if you 're not actually into it ; it 's kind of its own reward , because it does n't exactly pay much . 
  if you go into geology , though , i have no idea what sort of job opportunities are in that ... when i was little , i always saw pictures of those dudes in shiny foil getup , exploring volcanos and stuff . 
  i was like , `` i do n't care how dangerous and uncomfortable that looks , i totally want to do that some day . '', 
  now i realize that volcanologists must be some form of field geologist ... but really i ca n't think of any other profession involving geology or something like it . 
  there 's cartography , i guess , but that 's boring . 
  well , best of luck , then !, 
  i hope you find something to do . 
  [ my sources say otherwise  ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004874 ), 
  [ ag : yes , that seems to 8e the limit to what i can do to your primitive species . 
  [ ag : i guess our 8rains do n't really work the same way ? 
  who knows !, 
  yeah , more like outright contradiction . 
  i assume that there is a god . 
  he says , `` no . '', 
  neither of us are criticizing the other , when neither assumption can be objectively proven . 
  if there had been an argument made for the case that there is a god , and / u/kisarubandit posted a counterargument , that would be criticism . 
   why does it seem that adults want to press their ignorant `` adult life '' on to you ? 
  why do you call it ignorant ? 
  it seems to be working so far , yes ? 
  no problem , that 's sort of what i 've always thought anyway ... 
  i do n't think there 's really any proof either way . 
  i sort of doubt it . 
  why ? 
  i had that until a few months ago . 
  all i see are subpixels, 
  that 's not how sbahj did it . 
  i see no reason to depart from their words , as long as we 're memetically quoting them . 
  everybody can beta test the adventure game ( the one that comes out in 2014 ) . 
  only $ 50 + backers can beta test the next homestuck minigame . 
  that 's all in the chart . 
  careful . 
  i might start criticizing your taste in subreddits . 
  [ ** cannon glasses ** ] ( http://glassbloggery.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/glass-cannon.jpg?w=640 ), 
  ( yes that is the first google result , do n't bothe rsearching ), 
  [ ] ( / johnderp ), 
  there 's only one clock afaik , which decides for all players . 
  but what if the clock being broken on `` just '' for `` light '' affects rose as well ? 
  i 'm with you on this mostly , but did you really have to add the `` we did it reddit '' ? 
  that 's insulting . 
  we 're nothing like the people who say that . 
  95-99 % of the kickstarter money comes from homestuck fans . 
  and we do n't pretend that this will help the world at all . 
  it 's a fucking game . 
  i think that he knows that . 
  unless he '' [ [ did n't ] give a shit about ancestors ] ( / cg ) '' in such a manner that he actually missed that part of his cultural folklore . 
  yeah but he 's the * waste * of rage, 
  noooooooooooo not again, 
  no , karkat . 
  you 're very late to the party . 
  but these universes are all connected by the green sun . 
  they 're all in the same local group . 
  let me try that in / r/circlejerk . 
  local group : all sburb sessions with the green sun . 
  i do n't get this joke . 
  edit : ( i tried googling `` sea tribble '' , to no avail . ), 
  i want to split it up into more lists , because i 've run out of space to add new items . 
  i do n't suggest using it ( and all three titles contain the same typo , wow ) . 
  i 'd suggest either a homestuck track or your favorite symphony ( this might not apply to you , though ) . 
  no , they 're in the medium . 
  the medium is outside the human universe , not in its future . 
  maybe !, 
  i only know him from one movie , * the departed * . 
  what movie/television show is this ? 
  the game ... will be a separate story from homestuck !, 
  it 's in the faq !, 
  it will only be tangentially related to homestuck !, 
  it probably wo n't have any characters in common with it , except the carapacians ( which do n't talk ) !, 
  edit : for some reason , i wrote `` sleep '' instead of `` talk '' . 
  i think it 's a sign . 
  no it 's that sticker sheet that was added at the $ 1.5 m tier . 
  it 's added to all $ 105 + tigers . 
  wow , that totally backfired . 
  the tier addons were supposed to make * extra * money . 
  huh . 
  i did n't see any cards with unusual races on them , but either way that 's pretty stupid . 
  i thought that it was because the strilondes were depicted as black on the new sticker sheets . 
  it 's possible not to do that ? 
  i 'm not an electrician myself , but is really no one watching ? 
  ( actually i see nothing wrong with any of them , but i personally would n't touch / r/adviceanimals with an 11m extendable pole ), 
  ohhhhhh [ ] ( / johnderp ), 
  i want to make a new one , because these have all already filled in over the character limit .
