  well , just under , actually . 
  either way , i ca n't add to these anymore . 
  i 'll wait until the third album comes out ( i think it 's radiation 's ? ), 
  and then i 'll make a new list , split into 5 or 6 parts . 
  what does that mean ? 
  that 's the way it looks , but if you read between the lines ( literally : there is a reason for the amount of line breaks , and it 's emphasis ) , the post 's author 's opinion can definitely be derived . 
  it 's only that the ironic tone gets lost through the medium . 
  ( the reason why someone is replying to your post five months after you posted it : someone posted this link * again * . ), 
  yeah , but i ( a consumer of this content ) do n't browse those subreddits , and thus only see these for the first time . 
  it 's relevant to this subreddit and therefore relevant to my interests ( as i subscribe to subreddits based on interest ) , so this content was valuable to me , and would also be valuable to anyone else who does n't browse / r/pics but browses / r/chemicalreactiongifs , who may be missing out on / r/chemicalreactiongifs-worthy content because it is n't posted there . 
  therefore , i consider this post a reasonable submission to make in this subreddit . 
  if it were posted to / r/pics or / r/wtf for yet another time , that would n't be appropriate , given that it already exists on there , and nobody is looking specifically for content like it . 
  but i mean can they get away with using non-plenum-rated cable ? 
  it * looks * like one , but what does a heart urchin exoskeleton look like ? 
  ( i * do * know what sea urchin exoskeletons look like in general . ), 
  exoskeleton minus spines , i mean . 
  why 431 ? 
  oh god no, 
  ... you reddit while driving ? 
  good luck on your swift death . 
  i mean what do you mean by `` article '' ? 
  if you took off the spines and bleached it , it looks a lot like that bilaterally symmetrical sand dollar exoskeleton pictured above . 
  this is potions class . 
  blah , fuck . 
  he deleted the post . 
  i got to the end , but nothing . 
  you just know some smug / r/atheism-reader will come here and post some really obnoxious generalization about christianity . 
  hypothetically , fuck him . 
  but seriously that 's a bad idea ( unless you are joking ) . 
  i do n't think they 're racists . 
  they 're just people who do n't like having their headcanons ruined . 
  ( and having them as white in headcanon is n't racist at all . 
  unless it is , in which case the majority of homestuck readers are racist , and therefore we should cancel the kickstarter altogether . ), 
  [ ( here is an identical comment of mine ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/107o8v/money_is_being_pulled_from_the_kickstarter/c6b5ysm ), 
  they could be east asian , if you 're interpreting their white skin as actually white ( or about as white as white gets when talking in terms of human skin ) . 
  i do n't think they 're racists . 
  they 're just people who do n't like having their headcanons ruined . 
  ( and having them as white in headcanon is n't racist at all .

  [ ( here is an identical comment of mine ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/107o8v/money_is_being_pulled_from_the_kickstarter/c6b5x6x ), 
  okay , but they do n't necessarily believe that . 
  well , dave * is * a hero of time . 
  [ i 'm fairly sure it was n't supposed to end here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/o5rhq/is_it_just_me_or_does_hitlers_mom_look_a_lot_like/c3emtio?context=1 ), 
  it depends on how mad they are and exactly why . 
  they 're assholes , definitely , but it does n't sound to me like any of their behavior is indicative of a belief of white superiority . 
  so , then , why 431 ? 
  it does n't seem forced to * me * . 
  maybe you 're just projecting you 're opinions onto hussie ? 
  ( actually i only just noticed that geromy was black , huh ), 
  [ no , apparently this is an actual usage of it !, 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dip ), 
  edit : downvotes , really ? 
  ( in case you missed it , this is the ol' reddit switcheroo at work here ... am i allowed to say `` whoosh '' ? ), 
  by the way , who took the pictures ? 
   tim cook, 
  do you ? 
  i will now proceed to fawn over you , based on your geographical location . 
  oh , no , i was n't calling you the / r/atheism reader !, 
  i 've only just now realized that it was possible to interpret my post that way . 
  what i meant was that someone might make an obnoxious reply to your comment in the form of a generalization . 
  okay , that 's a good explanation . 
  i could n't explain their behavior until now . 
  thanks !, 
  ( hussie did say something to this effect as well . ), 
  does this qualify as a different language ? 
  this is like if someone wrote english with different orthography and called it a new language . 
  ( shh , do n't mention the word `` cipher '' . ), 
  yeah . 
  one was in fact posted just [ yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/105qj9/brought_her_in_from_the_cold_and_the_rain_i_think/c6amh4w ) . 
  the top link is actually pretty funny , though . 
  it 's not a joke about black people ; it 's a joke about the kkk . 
  is it getting so many upvotes because it was linked [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/107acu/professor_knows_his_shit/c6b11h5 ) ? 
  exactly 100 % ; i only listen to classical music . 
  ( well , if you want to get specific , music from the romantic period , classical period , baroque period ( but not the renaissance period ) , some gregorian chants , and a lot of stuff by dvorak and his contemporaries . 
  it 's not a matter of taste . 
  it 's a matter of racial insensitivity and personal maturity . 
  can we really say `` it created a new language '' ? 
  there is a con ... in * detroit * ? 
  i mean , i 've only heard about the place , but is n't that like the most run-down major city in the us ? 
  i love the art style !, 
  you do a good job at visually characterizing the formerly-faceless characters . 
  because roman catholic priests are n't allowed to marry because jesus was n't married . 
  at least , that 's the explanation that i 've always known . 
  okay . 
  what makes it funny , then ? 
  sorry , i thought you said you thought it was . 
  i misinterpreted your comment . 
  huh . 
  i guess you 're a more reliable source than my mother . 
  veruca salt was flat , though . 
  what 's that ` w ' doing there ? 
  would n't that make it the 729th day ? 
  if not , it would be more appropriate to call it the beginning of the 3ird year . 
  what are the transfer speeds up in that bitch ? 
  it leaks . 
  is n't that 70 \u00b0 f ? 
  that was mean . 
  but would n't that be pronounced [ ` pin\u025b ] anyway ? 
  granted , i 've never been formally taught how to pronounce japanese .
