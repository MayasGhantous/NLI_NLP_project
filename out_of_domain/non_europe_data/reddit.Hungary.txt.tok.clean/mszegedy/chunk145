  yeah , but is n't that only when it 's someone else 's post ? 
  huh . 
  thanks !, 
  i ca n't read katakana ( only hiragana and a few kanji ) . 
  huh . 
  thanks !, 
  i ca n't read katakana ( only hiragana and a few kanji ) . 
  by the way , when is the course starting ? 
  i hope you can explain why it 's important , though ? 
  i learned derivatives in one evening by punching functions into wolframalpha !, 
  look at meee !, 
  okay !, 
  just checking . 
  some people like to be mad at things just for the sake of being mad . 
   `` not a flash '', 
  canvas . 
  html5 canvas . 
  ahahaha i googled `` the shining bro '' at first . 
  but then i remembered that that king novel was made into a movie . 
  cool !, 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't know , i liked hussie 's foreshadowing-rant about it , too . 
  wreath some hair . 
  every room is able to be sealed off from any other room . 
  once i find magma , i install a system that pumps lave into any room after i quarantine it . 
  the first place i set this up for is the room with the trading post inside , because i 'm actually likely to use that . 
  sometimes it 's happened that i flooded the trading post room so regularly that i was always preoccupied with installing the system for the next trading room , rather than for the rest of the fortress ( the next place would have been the nobles ' quarters , which i do flood sometimes if the mayor makes an impossible request ) . 
  i also install a lever that opens * all * of the quarantine floodgates . 
  if by that time i 've amassed enough magma in lots of different rooms , this is an effective final `` fuck you '' . 
  one particularly glorious moment was when i made everyone burrow to the lever room ( which i had installed a miniature fortress in for this exact purpose ) besides one guy , who released the clowns while the lever room was sealed off . 
  then i flooded most of the fortress with magma . 
  that was the most successful session of df that i 've played to date . 
  i also like keeping at least one mosaic of the power ( you know , on/off ) symbol around , as a sort of depiction of what the fortress stands for and a good luck charm . 
  once , i built it out of crops on my farm . 
  walls ? 
  floors ? 
  just pick any instance where the fans of a story get mad because of a change to the story . 
  some of those cases are because they think the alternative is `` better '' , but lots of the outrage comes from contradicting how people imagined it . 
  i only recongnize a few . 
  caffeine , codeine , cocaine , hcl ... why do they have cocaine , anyway ? 
  wow . 
  that 's a lot of friends . 
  ( i like the art , too ! ), 
  new otp . 
  right here . 
  i did n't know that , huh . 
  is it an an\u00e6sthetic ? 
  totally welcome back and everything . 
  it did n't , and now there 's no room to add any more . 
  once the third album comes out , i 'll post a new series of this , split into five sections rather than three . 
  or , at the very least , they could downvote * and * tell you why you are wrong . 
  what happens when it even * approaches * the population of arizona ? 
  wow , an electrode that pokes inside a single cell . 
  that 's ridiculously precise . 
  how much does equipment like that * cost ? 
  pfft , only one year ? 
  there are way too many obnoxious le \\ / r/atheists on this site , but i do n't think they 're the problem here . 
  that 's actually really useful to me . 
  the place where i live is infested with the stuff , so much that i 've developed acquired immunity . 
  what the fuck, 
  what ? 
  i 've never had food included in a concert !, 
  i 'm missing out , apparently . 
  i 'm not orthodox myself , but many , many people i know are , and i 'm pretty sure if you went up and asked anyone in my location on the street about eastern orthodoxy they 'd probably give a decent sort of answer , so i can sort of empathize . 
  hunting cap . 
  so what ? 
  what , do n't you care about content ? 
  welcome to / r/facepalm ? 
  i do n't see your point . 
  the content is objectively bad . 
  why not complain about it to at least give the appearance of self-awareness ? 
  what would you prefer instead ? 
  what 's soft about it ? 
  my tongue ? 
  my brain ? 
  wow . 
  i knew reddit was racist , but i did n't know they were * so * racist as to use the term `` niggerspeak '' . 
  i think complaining is more effective . 
  people are much more likely to disregard a little blue number than some words . 
  where the * fuck * is rufio ? 
  [ rufio , , , ] ( / at ), 
  it 's also great for both coke and mentos as well . 
  i once pmed the moderators to give me comic sans flair , and it worked for a week or two until dhamster got the idea to remove it ( because he was out of the loop on why i had it ) . 
  he was n't when i made this comment . 
   \u222c gggg \u2202 g ^ *** { g } *** = ** g **, 
  ggg ? 
  ggggggggggg ? 
  ( tbh the only thing i think i 've missed is matrices , if that makes sense in any way ... 
  i did trigonometric functions , logarithms , nth roots , things to the power of x and so on ... ), 
  it 's not stupid at all . 
  after all , the a1 trolls do n't know which ones of them got god tiers . 
  quest * cocoons * . 
  you messed up his quirk . 
  6 's are b 's , and 9 's are o 's . 
  i 'm actually kind of surprised that this argument is getting made . 
  i mean , could n't you say the exact same thing about gender ? 
  both are biological differences that are only separated by human boundaries . 
  plants snd animals get reclassified all the time , which just shows how arbitrary the whole thing is . 
  of course , saying `` socially , i 'm a tiger '' does n't make sense , because tigers do n't participate in society . 
  in fact , if you go by those standards , saying `` socially , i 'm a troll '' makes much more sense , because they actually have distinct social characteristics .
