  it 's not possible . 
  this is clearly a dream bubble : shaped like one and everything . 
  it has troll prospit in the background . 
  it also has the mangled troll skaia in the background , with a frog limb in it . 
  you could argue stylistic choice , but it 's a hundred times more likely that instead of those things being there because they are jack 's stylistically portrayed memories , they are actually jack 's memories being projected because he is obviously in a dream bubble . 
  hussie confirmed that the vrillyhoo resulted in john 's alchemy of the zillyhoo with the fluorite octet . 
  nope about the first thing , i made this mistake in an earlier thread and got downvoted . 
  the trident actually penetrated him and then he woke up . 
  do n't you hate it when ... 
  but it 's le that 's the time lord ... 
  it was easy to miss . 
  you had to look at it really closely . 
  hussie and newell can race . 
  make sure to give him the title '' ~ ~ heir ~ ~ waste of rage '' or something . 
  ` sokay , you probably would n't 've gotten the godtier title you wanted anyway . 
  i used him for a long time , but then i found out that ness was even more overpowered . 
  once , i won with ness against a pretty competent player ... 
  i had two broken thumbs . 
  i do n't think i could 've managed this with luigi . 
  and the gba version of smw , i believe .

  ( clearly , their eyes are closed too . 
  especially dirk . ), 
  what , you need the game to give objectives to you ? 
  ( also , obligatory and tangential : inb4 / r/firstworldanarchists ), 
  wtf is a `` sun '' ? 
  alas , it was not meant to be . 
  toosh . 
  why are you so excited ? 
  do you like thunderstorms , too ? 
  i like thunderstorms . 
  the page in sburb is often this , but after lots of leveling up there is a combat payoff . 
  it 's still a generally pacifist class , though . 
  the bard is similar , but after a certain point attacking is encouraged . 
  the game does n't really qualify as an mmo , though ; not everyone plays in the same session , and sessions are limited to a small group of players anyway . 
  yeah , but the antecedent of `` he '' in your sentence is `` doc scratch '' . 
  which makes doc scratch the one who is regenerating . 
  but only time lords regenerate . 
  doc scratch is n't necessarily a time lord . 
  le is the one who is a time lord . 
  sorry , i confused you with someone else . 
  of course you 're waste of rage . 
  this is / r/gaming , one of the most active subreddits on reddit . 
  though i do n't visit it very often . 
  just check up on it occasionally . 
  this was a cool post , so i looked at the comments . 
  [ round ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypraea_nebrites ) shell . 
  great otherwise !, 
  make sure to remember to preserve the shell 's handedness . 
  i 'll never get tired of explaining it , although i find the metaphorical language a bit cheesy : hussie does n't plan that far in advance . 
  what he does instead is leave these little `` plot hooks '' for himself to come back to and reference later on . 
  for example , he included killing a cat in the book 's description . 
  thenceforward , he knew that , if he wanted to kill a cat , that book was the way to go . 
  i 'm not sure whether this counts as overestimating him or underestimating him . 
  what if you live in the middle of eastern europe ? 
  no , they banned it because the keyboards are distracting . 
  you do n't think a bunch of senators are so immature as to browse facebook ? 
  sorry , i meant to edit that post . 
  but anyway the keyboards were the main distraction . 
  banning laptops means that they do n't have to implement a wall like that . 
  how little they care about it is shown by the fact that they still allow tablets . 
  i 'm not entirely fond of the fandom . 
  ( cue downvotes ? 
  maybe ? ), 
  a lot of times they tend to be altogether too serious about a lot of things , and make homestuck out to be a lot more than it really is . 
  and by a lot more , i mean `` an entire lifestyle based on pointless references '' . 
  i also do n't like referring to fans as `` homestucks '' , though i ca n't explain this any further than that i feel that it reflects that one feels that they are * defined * by homestuck , which should n't in any measure assume such a role . 
  edit : i do want to note , though , that i have no way of knowing ( or , anyway , simply do n't know ) whether what i described is really the average homestuck fan or simply an annoying minority . 
  blue fathoms or the like . 
  i just visualized those streams as solid tendrils used for fatally piercing skin , and realized that i had visualized a miniature red miles made of wind . 
  badly , not necessarily worse . 
  never mind , i 've come up with a brilliant solution ( i forced the population to curve logistically towards an asymptote ) . 
  a name i made up a while ago before jane : enter to describe how the condesce flooded the planet . 
  it turned out to be catchier , though : blue leagues . 
  i thought i 'd use blue fathoms again . 
  :p unfortunately , as of yet the images have only partially loaded for me ( although today is a new day ) , and i was preoccupied with other things . 
  i quickly typed up the former response , because i do n't like seeing the misconception that the sassacre description was deliberately meant for roxy to kill jaspers with . 
  i 'll review your argument and attempt to actually look at the pictures . 
  / r/wtf goes in cycles . 
  every so often , when the content is especially bland , the subscribers vow to `` take it back to its roots '' , and then the subreddit becomes gory for a while . 
  over time , it starts to lose its edge , and the cycle repeats . 
  personally , i do n't feel like the subreddit is a particularly good idea in the first place ; i ca n't imagine any submission content that would actually make me go , `` what the fuck ? '', 
  i do n't think this explains the cycle , though . 
  it just makes me acknowledge that i do n't know how to fix it . 
  what purpose would that contraption serve for a * hand * ? 
  that 's horrible !, 
  all that energy , wasted ... 
  that is just so adorable . 
  especially # 4 . 
  it 's not just a fanadventure . 
  it 's one of those games which is played mostly in the real world , with all these random clues around in certain locations across the world . 
  but i do n't appreciate the penis joke , either . 
  why have you decided to infest this subreddit ? 
  if you want to dole out actual compliments , do n't sound so sarcastic about it . 
  what browser do you use ? 
  it does n't work in my chrome , so i downloaded firefox and it played it just fine . 
  by the way , are you using some sort of algorithm to generate these comments ? 
  they seem very formulaic . 
  what it looks like is this :, 
  first it picks an onset extolling the comment out of a reasonably large list , like `` this is a truly amazing comment '' or `` this is a great comment '' or `` this is a truly astounding comment '' .
