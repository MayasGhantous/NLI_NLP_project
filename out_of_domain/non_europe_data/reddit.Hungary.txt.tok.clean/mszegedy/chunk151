  my favorite ones are the ones that are multiple sentences , like `` this . 
  so much this '' . 
  then , after a '' , '' , it inserts a nucleus complimenting the writer of the comment , like `` you magnificent bastard . 
  '' , or `` you brilliant person . 
  '' , or `` you brilliant genius sir scholar bastard !, 
  it adds a coda maybe mentioning votes , like `` you deserve more upvotes . '', 
  or `` to the top ! '', 
  or `` to the top ! '' . 
  finally , it might add a reaction gif at the end . 
  do note though that sollux likes to abbreviate people 's names . 
  he would n't say `` karkat '' ; he 'd say `` kk '' . 
  similarly , `` gz '' for `` gamzee '' . 
  cool !, 
  so are you normally a bot , or do you actually post these ? 
  i 'm offended . 
  i thought you were talking about this subreddit . 
  never mind , then !, 
  it 's a bot that / r/braveryjerk made and operates . 
  recent updates . 
  was this made by a homestuck fan or what ... ? 
  yes . 
  john was contemplating how jade and davesprite 's relationship could work out physically , and referred to davesprite 's genitals as a `` ghost butt '' . 
  does that mean a middle finger ? 
  sbahj is notorious for foreshadowing important plot events . 
  [ i have what you want . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mvbm2.png ) ( the grid would n't be there obviously . ), 
  we do n't talk about them very much . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( i ^ ^ ^ said ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ straight ^ ^ ^ face ), 
  it makes me laugh , but i have to force myself to think about it somewhat . 
  i know from intuition that a crab-based computer would be impractical , but engineering a feeding and breeding system for them would be some serious shit . 
  get a look at * that * processor ... 
  on the other hand , calculating the potential size of a crab-based graphing calculator would be fun . 
  ( they did it in minecraft , why not here ? ), 
  yes . 
  i 'll upload the . m4a in a moment . 
  ( soundcloud does n't allow m4a uploads for some reason . ), 
  edit : [ here you are !, 
  ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcbs9u8c6fwbnr6/purpletyrant%202.m4r ) since i have n't ever downloaded a ringtone off of the internet before , i 'm not sure what you 're supposed to do with this , but it 's the format that it 's stored in on my computer so that 's what i 'm uploading . 
  that would certainly be a big twist . 
  probably the biggest one in homestuck . 
  i 'm not on board , but only because i want to be surprised when it happens . 
  good , i was going to ask you to do so . 
  thanks for taking charge !, 
  d : people on the internet know my real name now !, 
  this is creepy !, 
  i just made it the max length garageband can export . 
  i know . 
  it 's because i used `` log in with facebook '' . 
  my car also recently received some damage . 
  i had a flat in the bad part of town at 1 am this morning . 
  fortunately , a bar security guard helped exchange it with a spare . 
  he was pretty nice . 
  he would n't accept any money , though . 
  well , but crabs are n't the future of computing . 
  proteins , i 'd buy that . 
  but not crabs . 
  i 'm hungry , too . 
  there 's a `` flagel '' and some smoked salmon in the fridge , but i do n't feel like making dinner for myself . 
  is there some sort of scientific article that i could use to support my claim that complaining is psychologically beneficial ( to the complainer ) ? 
  why do people upload to imgur , and * then * provide a source ? 
  if you 're worried about res compatibility , then the tumblr link like you posted here works too ... 
  edit : my comment is rendered obsolete . 
  the artist changed their url , and now it does n't work for me either . 
  well !, 
  edit 2 : weird how people started upvoting * after * my comment became incorrect . 
  are n't you able to see for yourself ? 
  the tumblr link is better in a lot of ways , because it also shows the title and the description of the composition . 
  edit : see above . 
  it does n't work anymore . 
  besides the squid and shellfish , it had salmon . 
  it said penne , but it came with spaghetti noodles . 
  i was n't disappointed , though . 
  huh . 
  what browser do you have ? 
  would n't you be able to recognize chocolate on sight , though , without resorting to chemical tests to figure out what it is ? 
  well , i 'd do a chemical test on it for sure ... in my mouth ... 
  edit : to clarify , i was joking about putting it in my mouth . 
  i 'm too much of a hypochondriac about cross-contamination . 
   almost everyone, 
  that 's a lot of people . 
  pretty much . 
  oh no ... poor jack is gon na die . 
  :( probably by pm ... 
  do top medical schools pay higher stipends ? 
  what 's aranea holding ? 
  i suppose you 're right . 
  then , have you tried forcibly updating res ? 
  ( uninstalling and reinstalling it ? ), 
  i * will * do a md/phd . 
  so , thanks for the input . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  why ? 
  what ? 
  you misread my comment . 
  * jack * is going to die . 
  i think the most likely outcome is that john keeps him occupied until pm finds them and slays jack . 
  be teenage, 
  convert to zen buddhism, 
  be peaceful, 
  edit : the ???
