  if you did n't learn this in high school , then ... 
  * this * is pix -- oh , huh . 
  i do n't get it . 
  how can you tell that he used bases ? 
  the poses do look generic , but i would n't be able to definitively say `` that 's totally a base '' . 
  i 'm not disputing you , though , since i know little about art . 
  the only one that seems properly male is mituna . 
  okay , that 's what i thought . 
  thanks !, 
  wait , that 's it ? 
  took him/her a while , but wow . 
  what an asshole !, 
  ooooooh , i knew i was missing something . 
  thanks !, 
  adding to that , apparently the whole rest of the piece is lots of doctor in lots of guitar . 
  it 's , like , the part where they strike back or such . 
  edit : ( but yeah lotr is n't very long , which is my point . ), 
  listen , hussie , you want that money , right ? 
  then why do n't you update the kickstarter page as fast as possible ? 
  there 's only 66 hours left , and we do n't even know what the next goal is !, 
  ( i doubt we 'll reach it , unless we get some sort of especially excellent pak . ), 
  edit : even kicktraq 's most optimistic projection thinks we 'll only get up to $ 2.2 mil or so . 
  yeah , i was a bit off . 
  wow . 
  john , you are never getting sucker stabbed again . 
  yeah , like that 's what was on his mind for two years !, 
  i think it was a good moment to introduce a new power of john 's . 
  like , one that he sort of did n't have originally , and then leveled up to have . 
  like , hey guys , john is a more powerful/badass , come get a ruler and check this out . 
  it 's not a deus ex machina . 
  it 's a sign that john is getting better at this . 
  that seems unrealistic . 
  but this way he gets to keep being in the dream bubble . 
  because maybe it 's a common occurrence ? 
  dyjhiw ... ? 
  i can beat this :, 
  i do n't get it . 
  and this is after five years of latin education . 
  and two of stage . 
  ( though the latter is nothing . ), 
  lol . 
  not 314 $ ? 
  shame !, 
  ( if i had to pledge in my country 's currency , i 'd pledge 61,200 ft ; that 's a little more than $ 300 . 
  how much more wildly varies depending on time of day and whether our respective national leaders decide to make good decisions or not . ), 
  edit : [ what the fuck ? 
  ] ( http://wolfr.am/qfczry ) since when did the dollar decide to become 220 ft ? 
  i blame [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_orb%c3%a1n ) . 
  i even share a birthdate with the asshat !, 
   two to the millionth power dollars, 
  [ wolframalpha is speechless . 
  ] ( http://wolfr.am/o1styk ), 
  ( but if you just put in 2 ^ 1000000 , it 'll calculate for you , but what 's the fun in that ? 
  all you get is this ridiculously huge number . ), 
  crazy damage bonk, 
  googling did n't work . 
  well , yeah . 
  tell that to hussie , not me . 
  ( more precisely , 2 ^ 20.932 . ), 
  fuckin ' finally . 
  good job !, 
  not to get into this argument ( i really do n't want to ) , but how do you feel about the fans on this site and many other sites offended by the fact that justin bieber has fans ? 
  ( i do n't want to underestimate your capacity for empathy , but i want to get this out of the way : if you use the argument `` well , bieber is objectively bad '' , then my retort is that xkcd haters think xkcd is objectively bad . ), 
  disclaimer : i like randall munroe for the most part . 
  i like a lot of parts of xkcd , but not enough to make me like the comic as a whole . 
  i do think it 's overrated , and i do of course think that it 's the fans ' fault ( who else 's fault would it be ? 
  ) , but i 'm happy that it gets a lot of attention , because munroe knows what to do with it . 
  he makes lots of people happier , and i respect that . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gog ^ ^ ^ ^ gog ^ ^ gog ^ gog gog ** gog **, 
  the xkcd hater demographic is the same as the xkcd fan demographic . 
  ( but anyway , good on you !, 
  you 're a complex person with well-examined opinions . 
  it 's not my place to be the judge of whether you are , but the reassurance is at least nice , right ? ), 
  you should probably turn autocorrect off . 
  it changed my ~ ~ life ~ ~ typing experience when i did it . 
  never going back . 
  where did you get the idea that i 'm passionate about it ? 
  i was lightly poking fun at his wording . 
  i want that reward more badly than anything in the kickstarter . 
  the worst is being powerless to ensure that i will get it . 
  he will probably convert the flashes to videos ( maybe mpeg-4s or something ) . 
  i do n't know about the games , though . 
  xenocide is objectively wrong . 
  you do n't kill people , especially people you do n't understand to begin with . 
  yes , and it was wrong to wipe out the buggers . 
  i do n't hold ender responsible , since he did it without his knowledge , but it was wrong nevertheless and i ca n't blame people for hating him . 
  edit : ( in the hypothetical situation in which this happened . 
  i mean that if this exact thing did happen , then it would be understandable that he would be infamous as space hitler . ), 
  i was thinking that . 
  but first i 'd wait for the kickstarter to fill up , and then donate the minimal amount via paypal . 
  has this been posted in this subreddit before ? 
  if not , i 'm fine with it . 
  i do n't subscribe to defaults or subreddits like / r/woahdude , so i would have completely missed it otherwise , and would n't have had the opportunity to see it or anything like it . 
  well , leave off `` writesomeerror ( ) '' , since i will never be 5 . 
  i did n't know you had to have a break ; for case-switches in each statement in order to avoid the program doing all the rest of the things as well ... 
   ` else print ( `` error to many clips !, 
  this was the best way too top it off . 
  mb or mb ? 
  ( megabits or megabytes ? ),
