  edit : hey , it works for me too , now !, 
  cool !, 
  ( being serious here for a moment : maithuna is sanskrit for `` union '' ( usually sexual ) . 
  they could conceivably be distantly related , etymologically , but probably not . 
  english `` two '' comes from proto-indo-european `` duwa '' , but no one 's bothered to make conjectures about the sanskrit etymology . 
  the word has a homographic cognate in hindi , though . ), 
  the games can take up to an hour each . 
  what ? 
  the creator of bard quest ? 
  who 's that ? 
  [ ] ( / johnderp ), 
  so fucking beatuiful . 
  what do you have to say for yourself ? 
  great pictures of fire , but it was covering the entire planet ... :\\, 
  now we know the secret of how to get updates !, 
  just make him as miserable as possible . 
  he 's probably crying right now from happiness about the kickstarter having reached such a high goal . 
  crush his hopes , and we will get updates forever !, 
  guys , everyone withdraw their money . 
  great picture , but i think his limbs might be carapacian . 
  joke 's on us : hussie gives us nothing . 
  how did you find this article ? 
  do you go to school there ? 
  it 's been not working for me for months now . 
  i just ignore it . 
  it 's too glitched to bother with . 
  yeah , i 've gathered that now . 
  wow , this person does n't even know how to use case-switch properly ( at least , i assume so , since if writesomeerror was supposed to be executed , it would n't be called `` writesomeerror '' ) . 
  to be fair to him , though , i only have to use case-switch so infrequently that i did n't know that it cascades . 
  that 's cat z. 
  what 's the two thumbs part supposed to be about ? 
  am i not remembering some part of some episode ? 
  wait until it potentially also includes `` digital copy of homestuck '' . 
  huh , what ? 
  man . 
  why did no one tell me a new series 's come out ? 
  the finale is already out ? 
  love it . 
  grad student ? 
  or undergrad ? 
  oh ... like last season ... 
  ( also i knew that spoiler ), 
  who 's paying your tuition ? 
  do you have a loan ? 
  whoa . 
  those are some sweet scholarships . 
  have you looked into paid research internships at local independent laboratories ? 
  that 's where my kickstarter money comes from . 
  they do n't pay much ( $ 150 a week ) , but i am still getting used to the idea of getting paid to do something i want to do and it marginally helps my tuition situation . 
  or you could just always suck it up and work at a fast food restaurant . 
  i think . 
  if you sending me a pm reminding me to do so after it arrives , i 'll scan mine in for you . 
  ... wait , is the 97 at the end of your username the year of your birth ? 
  wait , i 've got it . 
  it 's called 50/50 because the edge angle is measured in gradians . 
  bottom line , though , you ca n't expect everything at once . 
  you have to pick one thing . 
  being not surprised , though , that 's possible . 
  just wondering , since you 're not financially independent yet , so i figured you must be in high school . 
  was that na\u00efve of me ? 
  ( honest question ), 
  [ ^ ^ gog ] ( / tc ), 
  ### [ gog ] ( / tc ), 
  [ ^ ^ gog ] ( / tc ), 
  ### [ gog ] ( / tc ), 
  ^ ^ [ gog ] ( / tc ), 
  ### [ gog ] ( / tc ), 
  why do you capitalize the first letter of every word ? 
  it 's hard to read . 
  these are pretty phenomenal . 
  i like how the kids are actually drawn their age ; as opposed to , you know , people who look like they 're 18 or 20 . 
  how/why are the a1 trolls 39/2 ? 
  when did it say they turned 14 sweeps ( i think that 's how much a sweep is ? ), 
  huh . 
  i should remember to visit that list . 
  but it takes me only one keystroke and a shift to type $ , whereas \\ ( requires me to go out and type \\ , come back to shift and stretch my hand to simultaneously hold down 9 or 0 . 
  ( also , my right hand is broken , as opposed to my left hand which is fine . 
  but that 's specific to me . ), 
  i understand that it 's newer , but how is it better ? 
  huh . 
  hussie will probably shadow-edit that in . 
  you have to live in a very tiny world for that to be what comes to mind . 
  dammit . 
  i want one . 
  i also want one the color of lord english lime . 
  fuck these tests , i make up my own shit . 
  seer of mind, 
  land of sulphur and sunsets, 
  polynomial modus ( i would have wallet if the game were to allow it , since it 's the most overpowered ), 
  screwdriverkind, 
  unendingardor ( it 's kind of a valid base pair ), 
  nuparu inika ( these cannisters are lying around here since 2006 ; i have a choice of any one of the six but jaller ), 
  edit : also / r/firstworldanarchists, 
  what 's the wavelength of declining sinusoid 6x ^ -0.6 sin ( x/7 ) ? 
  ( i think i did that right ), 
  ~ ~ but emerald is the gemini birthstone ~ ~, 
  so have us all . 
  if sin ( x ) returns a value in radians , then it 's 7\u03c0 . 
  ( just take the reciprocal of the coefficient of x and multiply it by pi . ), 
  edit : and 7\u03c0 is a little more than 21 .
