  edit : well , technically satan 's work . 
  but it 's definitely for the better . 
  well , that 's one way to do it . 
  let me at this point plug [ / r/karkat ] ( / r/karkat ) . 
  a pony from a `` pony detective '' story , and a robotic ninja rabbit from homestuck . 
  that was mostly fans , and it was more that it seemed like the logical conclusion . 
  shit , i want more of this . 
  like , ten times more . 
  really ? 
  i never knew . 
  and i call myself a fan . 
  pfft , sound pads are the oldest trick in the book . 
  despite this being a really immature joke , it actually did make my day a bit brighter . 
  so , thank you . 
  really ? 
  there 's no speed penalty of \u221a 2 for diagonal movement ? 
  so then a dwarf * does n't * perceive square architecture as round . 
  now it 's cambria , but what i 'd really like is a good slab-serif font . 
  i 'd be happy with even rockwell , but if there 's a package available that contains the one used on the kindle , then i 'd totally take it .

  `` better '' is meaningless in this context . 
  better for women ? 
  yes . 
  better for men ? 
  maybe . 
  but just `` better '' is n't something you can say . 
  and l ; do n't forget l. 
  i imagine the vowel harmony must get to a lot of people . 
  that 's exactly the intermission telehax means . 
  intermission 2 is n't really an intermission , and these act 6 intermissions are n't intermissions either . 
  this . 
  if nothing else , practice . 
  in middle school , i was put through months and months of hours and hours of factoring binomials . 
  guess what 's become second nature since then . 
  i want a shirt with one on it , but luckily i 'm resourceful and already have one . 
  i 'd rather / eb . 
  it 's not completely relevant to the rest of the story . 
  sure , it provides lots and lots of background for all the characters present for the rest of the story , especially doc scratch and vriska , and it kills the big reveal of `` rose has been talking to doc scratch omfg ???? 
  '' , but it 's possible to follow the rest of the story without it . 
  it 's largely self-contained plotwise , and if you do n't want to take part in that plot then you mostly do n't have to . 
  serenity was introduced as such at a time when i was extremely aware of * firefly * , so i recognized the reference immediately . 
  i guess ... others ca n't be so lucky . 
  you mean , less is easier to process and upvote . 
  what ? 
  this appeared in a much larger ( by about 70 times ) collection of gifs earlier . 
  anyone have a link ? 
  i tried to save it back then , but my internet was drifting in and out of existence and when i clicked the button must 've been an `` out '' moment . 
  it 's probably just a red pigment . 
  it has n't been proven for certain that it 's not chemically and physically identical to the blood of humans or carapacians , but it 's much simpler to assume that he has a mutant pigment than an entirely different oxygen carrier from other trolls ( trolls have to have a transparent oxygen carrier or simply no oxygen carrier at all if they want to remain so diversely pigmented ; how [ icefish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channichthyidae ) do it at least is that the oxygen dissolves in the blood plasma ; if trolls did it this way , it would mean that they have no blood types ) . 
  edit : although it would seem that trolls would be more similar to insects in this aspect , since they are clearly genetic chimerae of such ( horns as calcified antennae , grub-like larval stage of development , chitinous internal organs , addition of insectoid wings upon godtier as an unintentionally activated ancestral trait ) , as insects have `` clear blood '' , insect blood ( well , [ hemolymph ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hemolymph ) ) is only clear because it does n't transport oxygen because it 's just absorbed through the insect 's body . 
  when hemolymph does transport oxygen , it contains hemocyanin , which is , unsurprisingly given its name , blue . 
  so plasmic dissolution is still our best-supported model for the transportation of oxygen in troll blood . 
  it 's a joke . 
  surely you know of the fat vriska meme ? 
  it 's a meme . 
  it 's a self-spreading idea . 
  most things are memes . 
  at least a little . 
  everyone hears about fat vriska eventually . 
  i was spreading it just now in the preceding comment . 
  that 's definitely a meme . 
  more than a little . 
  one thing i never understood was why polylogarithms were called that . 
  it 's a function , an interesting one , but it does n't include logarithms at all , or combinations of them . 
  what makes it a `` polylogarithm '' ? 
  edit : never mind , i see that it 's basically the series representation of log but with an additional argument . 
  oh [ ] ( / johnderp ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  a monitor * is * a reptile and that 's how the game is using it here , unironically . 
  edit : dammit i said `` ironically '' first , sure as hell is n't ironic, 
  livelily as ever, 
  no , there 's a difference between godhead pickle inspector and part-pickle inspector . 
  it sounds as though you 're saying it with a retainer in your mouth . 
  ( sorry i 'm still catching up on all these memes i never partook in ), 
  ( help !, 
  i do n't get what the refrance ! ), 
  no , i mean in the post i replied to . 
  i do n't know what the dead horse is . 
  i know livelily is n't a word . 
  [ i do n't think you get what the refrance . 
  i never misspell anythign . 
  edit : [, 
   sarah jessica parker looks like a horse, 
  this is the refrance i did n't get . 
  thank you !, 
  i assume she 's an actress . 
  thank you . 
  i do n't use that one very often . 
  same here ( in hungary ) . 
  my grandparents spent all of their free time watching tv . 
  ( kicker ? 
  my grandmother never even retired from the position of the owner of a private hospital . ), 
  you could always resort to cloudbrowse . 
  i actually played the most recent walkabout canvas that way . 
  it was a pretty shitty experience , but i was actually really satisfied . 
  but there are much better ways to acquire those . 
  the purpose of gaming is not only primarily but overwhelmingly entertainment . 
  shit . 
  five years of latin have n't prepared me for this much italian .
