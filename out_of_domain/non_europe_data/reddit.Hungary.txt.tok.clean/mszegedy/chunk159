  i ca n't tell whether you 're racist . 
  oh , you were copying what was written ? 
  huh . 
  multiple ones exist . 
  see : any flash where dave strifes . 
  i do n't know , i think everyone has at least one `` oh god why '' moment like this in their childhood . 
  i 'm sure any reader of this comment can , given enough effort , think of one such thjng . 
  i have one , but i 'm too embarrassed to tell . 
  i still do n't get it :, 
  who said they are ? 
  jokes can be memes . 
  who cares either way whether it 's watermarked ? 
  it 's not like they pretend that they made it any more than reddit , which is hardly . 
  and how much is a funny screencap worth as intellectual property anyway ? 
  i plan to forget about this screencap instantly after i leave this thread . 
  wow . 
  i wish i was this talented . 
  i 've always wanted to draw good and math good , but everything i draw looks like ms paint and i make mistakes in basic arithmetic . 
  edit : i mean like sbahj , not mspa . 
  i did n't really notice it in the title . 
  probably because i did n't read it . 
  and now i ca n't bring myself to be even annoyed with it . 
  edit : and `` are n't bad '' ? 
  he deserves a lot more credit than that !, 
  they 're pretty amazing afaiac . 
  cool drawing !, 
  though , it makes her look like she 's not blonde . 
  i 'm sort of disappointed . 
  let 's repost this in every subreddit . 
  yes , thanks . 
  the plots look like an octopus . 
  ( as does any series of functions with equivalent constant terms . ), 
  i like the idea , and props for all the effort ; it turned out really nice-looking . 
  but it seems really uncomfortable to use ... how is it , using it ? 
  i give it a 1.5 . 
  oh my god, 
  i have to go here for grad school . 
  wherever this is . 
  honestly , it looks like shit to me . 
  but i 'm not going to judge your taste . 
  it 's ... glorious . 
   edit : its about time you got here , srs . 
  i 've got another 100 accounts linked to my upvote bot ; i appreciate you volunteering for testing . 
  let your downvotes commence !, 
  ( christ , this was just too easy ), 
  wow ... reddit points are such serious business . 
  ( i 'm not trying to be condescending , only making an observation . ), 
  it represents a milestone in religious tolerance is why it 's important . 
   whom is male, 
  the subjects to linking clauses take the subjective/nominative case , not the objective/accusative . 
  i was thinking 10 or 20 , but it may as well be . 
  i am picturing you . 
  bowing . 
  yeah . 
  that 's okay . 
  at least you bother to try to use `` whom '' . 
  i 've been drawing for nearly two decades . 
  same deal with arithmetic . 
  i acknowledge that i can and will improve my drawing , but i think the arithmetic is a lost cause . 
  whenever the relative pronoun is n't the subject of the relative clause : `` the person whom i verbed , '' `` the person with whom i was , '' `` the person whom i gave the thing , '' and variations on these three . 
  every time it 's the object , the indirect object , or the object of a prepositional clause , then you 're good to go . 
  what 's strange is that english likes to exhibit a `` double genitive '' for `` of '' , but i 'd regard both versions as correct in the case of `` of whom '' vs. `` of whose '' . 
  no , thank you !, 
  i am a huge fan of hydroponic systems , and , while i do n't have a spare greenhouse i could fill up with a whole lot of lovely tubes , i 've been looking to make a cabinet like this for a long time . 
  your work is great motivation and inspiration for the undertaking of such a project . 
  hydroponics has always seemed so future-y and science fiction-y to me , and has always been confined in my imagination to the shelves of brilliantly lit glass buildings in well-funded research or agriculture institutions . 
  seeing one made by a `` consumer '' , it just feels ... 
  it feels like a very special achievement . 
  achieved by you , of course . 
  i really , really must congratulate you on it . 
  you just click on the dime ... :\\, 
  thanks , i 'll be sure to take note !, 
  but , anyway , nowhere near evidence for a simulation . 
  wow , what ? 
  you taught me contour integrals and homeomorphism . 
  ... thank you so much . 
  tips :, 
  - if it contains the word `` instantons '' , then it 's snarxiv ( dead giveaway ) . 
  - if the latex is bounded by $ signs , then it 's almost always arxiv . 
  - if the latex is n't bounded by $ signs , then it 's almost always snarxiv , except when you 're raising the letter * e * or e to a plus sign or minus sign . 
  - if it contains '' \\ ^ { \\ mathbb { h } } '' , then it 's snarxiv . 
  - if the latex uses parentheses instead of curly brackets , it 's snarxiv ( dead giveaway ) . 
  - if it contains a parenthetical , especially beginning with `` including '' , then it 's probably snarxiv . 
  - if it contains the phrase `` center of the universe '' , or `` edge of the universe '' , then it 's snarxiv . 
  - if it contains the element `` iia '' / `` iia '' , then it 's snarxiv . 
  - the following generic formulas are popular in snarxiv : `` why x is/are y '' , anything with a colon , `` on x '' ( tough i know ) , `` from x to y '' , `` an x approach to y '' , `` x deformed by y '' ( this is the most obvious one ) , `` towards x , y , and z '' , and a few more that i ca n't remember, 
  - good luck !, 
  edit : [ i found a paper that actually has `` instantons '' in the title . 
  ] ( http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9712135 ), 
  comment may not have been reproduced exactly verbatim . 
  all of them , such that `` adjacent '' is meaningless . 
  ( in this context . ), 
  edit : fine , technically `` inspecific '' , not `` meaningless '' . 
  besides all the other issues with this , maybe pain did bring them closer to christ . 
  though i think if this really did happen ( unlikely ) , she should 've used painkillers anyway , since there are better ways to get closer to christ than bodily suffering . 
  why do people closer to the beginning of the alphabet get buttdialed more often ? 
  i am a michael , and my surname begins with an s , and i get buttdialed pretty often . 
  solid spheres are the least practical and most impossible version of dyson 's idea . 
  i was , indeed , referring to the cloud type things . 
  right , sorry .
