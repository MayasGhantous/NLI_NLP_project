  that 's a solution . 
  i love these so much . 
  feferi does n't quite look like herself , though . 
  if anything , if i had n't been told that that 's feferi , i 'd say it 's jade , despite the horns and fins and outfit . 
  i guess it 's partly due to the limited palette , though , which you did a great job with !, 
  the shifting colors on the fabric are a novel and well-applied idea . 
  speaking of the fabric , though , the witch hood is split into two branches . 
  ( i do n't want to even hear anyone * think * the word `` bifurcated '' . ), 
  i do n't get what that 's supposed to mean , though . 
  does it have something to do with locah or the game halo ? 
  could you clarify your statement ? 
  it sounds like you 're saying that , despite not being placental mammals , trolls will have navels because it 's in their genetic code ( which it is n't because they do n't even have placentas in the first place ) , and , despite not having gone through a developmental stage involving a placenta , humans will have them because it 's in their genetic code to have them ( which it , strictly speaking , does n't ) . 
  ( and that , my friends , is an example of latin 's huge influence on hungarian . 
  for example , the first word i used , the word for `` literally '' , almost literally means `` literally '' . 
  it 's a lot more impressive than it sounds , given that `` literal '' comes from `` littera '' which means `` letter '' , and the '' - ally '' suffix comes from '' - aliter '' , the '' - al - '' of which first turns it into an adjective , read a lot like `` by the letters '' , and then the '' - iter '' turning it into an adverb . 
  and the transliteration of the hungarian word `` sz\u00f3szerint '' is `` by the words [ adv. 
  ] '' , which is basically the same . 
  and also , notice the word `` intelligens '' . 
  lots of latin words were copied straight out of the dictionary into the hungarian lexicon with no forethought or edit , so now words like `` sors '' , `` biol\u00f3gia '' , `` democracia/demokr \u00e1cia '' , and a jillion other words are the same and mean the exact same thing in both languages . ), 
  if you just acknowledge that it 's more complicated than suomi , we 'll get along just fine . 
  so we 're literally first graders now ? 
  no it 's more like, 
  ~ johns ~ egbert of wessex, 
  \u00b7 johns \u00b7 egbert of wessex, 
  wow , the information you stuck in there is so dense that the image 's resolution is n't enough to represent it . 
  i thought it was vectors and matrices that were lumped together , which are generally taught two courses before calculus in algebra ii . 
  from my experience . 
  i still do n't get it , though . 
  i mean , i got * that * part before the question was asked , but why do n't they just build the trains so that the passenger level floor is only a little bit above the train 's bottom ? 
  wow , could you do some of the other trolls ? 
  also the humans and everything . 
  just draw everything . 
  but seriously , i 'd love to see more of these sorts of things . 
  i 'd do a challenge like this myself but first i have to do more fundamental stuff , which i 'm still in the process of doing . 
  exciting to hear !, 
  i hope it turns out well . 
  you use a drawing tablet , right ? 
  i have ai cs4 ( ridiculously good combo deal with my 4-year-old macbook ; it felt almost like pirating ) . 
  i do n't have an expensive tablet to go with it , though . 
  no , i just do n't care about it . 
  i do n't care about a lot of things . 
  but sometimes i do get worked up over things lots of things other people do n't seem to care about . 
  it would n't be very nice of me to dismiss other peoples ' cares like that ; i 'd feel pretty offended if someone dismissed mine . 
  maybe i 'm wrong about them , then . 
  i just do n't like the impression it gives , at any rate . 
   around the deccan traps ( a huge basalt formation that 's half a million square kilometers and 2 kilometers thick ), 
  thank you for providing that wonderful context . 
  this is why i love geologists . 
  that 's really strange . 
  i suppose it does n't have anything to do with rock just expanding and contracting , either due to heat or stored compressive energy from getting pushed on ? 
  and latulaxmituna, 
  he is going to literally kill terezi . 
  that was just for a day . 
  your flair says `` bard of blood '' . 
  you got ta commit , man !, 
  how can anything possibly not develop from this ? 
  john gives tavros the ring and literally blows away in the wind ? 
  and john . 
  and it 's going to be \\* really * awkward for vriska . 
  i always went to bed . 
  i ' v been staying in the us for two months now , and the updates come out on average at around midnight , so if you 're not in the uk it 'll most likely come out at 6 in the morning , which i used to stay up for on weekends but is a generally terrible idea to wait for . 
  if you 're in the uk , it 'll most likely come out at 5 in the morning , which is still a really bad idea to wait for . 
  but john is only capable of one , and tavros ' solicitation is strictly red .

  i do n't know whether that was a one-way crush , though . 
  i 'm also a big fan of diatomaceous earth . 
  too bad it 'll eventually run out . 
  because he got promoted in the meantime for being so effective . 
  because , you know . 
  he worked twice as hard as any other employee . 
  well , what about things in the english language worse than commas ? 
  i like ( read : downloaded ) a whole lot of these , like the midnight crew one , the one with quentin tarantino calliope and caliborn , , the one with doc scratch and his shadow , and [ holy shit this one is good ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zz1eu#33 ) . 
  i like the idea behind the one with the 12 trolls and something related to their signs . 
  i wonder what inspired the one that looked like tribal art ? 
  also , everyone seems to have the `` democracy '' one , and every time it 's posted everyone goes `` how have i not seen this before '' . 
  it 's really strange . 
  good point . 
  although i ca n't think of a way to phrase your sentence in a concise way that is propositionally correct . 
  did you rehost it on that one image hosting site that puts the spiral watermark over its pics just so you could see how long it took us to notice ? 
  well , !! f1rst !, 
  ! , bitch . 
  well , hearts boxcars is safe and sound . 
  he 's still farming all those damn horses . 
  fuckin ' pain in the ass . 
  aww . 
   is whom, 
   an direct attack, 
  judging by how often everyone likes to correct everyone else on their grammar ( a lot ) , i 'd think these mistakes are intentional and this is a troll . 
  but that has been proven to not be the case . 
  that 's very surprising . 
  you can still use safari !, 
  and have you ever heard of m.reddit.com ? 
  these people need to learn about / r/buildapc . 
  or maybe i 'm paranoid and consider every source unreliable . 
  what is a fundamental unit of guacamole ? 
  because then we 'd be able to figure out how much one mole of it is ... 
  it would be far less work for everyone on the whole if it were stated here . 
   nothing good comes of it, 
  this applies to nearly every other subreddit on reddit , including places like / r/videos . 
  i 'm not a fan of srs and would n't miss it , but this is n't a good reason to close a subreddit .
