  ca n't find any metal ? 
  but ... oh , right , aquifer . 
  yeah right . 
  what about planepacked-type artifacts ? 
  that 's ... surprisingly elegant and plausible . 
  that was :, 
  well written , with a good argument . 
  so brave . 
  would n't you be limited by the speed of light at some point as you get higher and higher in pitch ? 
  i did n't know the word `` indigo '' ever implied a red ( i.e. 
  purple ) tint . 
  i know . 
  just take it for what it 's worth . 
  it 's not often you see something even this relevant . 
  see the bottom of this page . 
  the very , very bottom . 
  also , gankro 's name . 
  i forget his surname , but they were both included in practically all of the troll naming threads . 
  thank you !, 
  it comes from tyre , a city part of phonecia , an ancient civilization on the coast of the mediterranean . 
  they had a unique dye , tyrian purple , which they got from processing the shells of certain ~ ~ poisonous ~ ~ predatory [ snails ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muricidae ) . 
  it was one of the only purple dyes in existence for a long time . 
  they made a lot of money off of it . 
  only wealthy and powerful people could afford to buy it . 
  i know . 
  i 'm saying that people used his name , too . 
  disregard . 
  there are * two * gankros ? 
  nitpick : the properties should be outside of the circles , not inside them . 
  that gets you room for three more composers per diagram , even !, 
  i saw this mentioned at one point in the manual , and could n't find it later when i wanted to . 
  the internet did n't help . 
  this brings back a painful memory . 
  install windows me . 
  works every time . 
  now all we have to do is work `` diamond '' into a pun . 
  too bad neither `` diamond '' nor `` diamon/dime-on/dye-mon etc. '', 
  are verbs . 
  ( edit : wait a minute , `` demand '' !, 
  okay , i <  bacon . ), 
  also , preemptively shooting down anyone who dares argue that everyone is subscribed to / r/funny , therefore this should n't be posted here : no , not everyone is subscribed to / r/funny , and i 'm grateful that this was reposted here , because i 'm not . 
  i subscribe to here for homestuck content , and , lo !, 
  homestuck content . 
  i am interested in seeing homestuck-relevant content , not jokes . 
  this one happens to be both , so i have good reason to see it . 
  i should n't need subscribe to / r/funny to do that , when i 'm not interested in / r/funny 's content . 
  fucking gypsies , man . 
  what 's up with them ? 
  they 're so degenerate and everything . 
  its acronym is pretty unfortunate , though . 
  i 'll bet you ran into that problem in your comment : `` aids is amazing '', 
  pfft . 
  - egberts/harleys are japanese, 
  - lalondes/striders are german, 
  i 'll come back to this and add actual plot things , but this is what i could come up with atm . 
  glades plugin . 
  que ?

  ohhhhhhh, 
  but those would be impossible to do . 
  3d models are vector-based . 
  it 's not a resolution problem . 
  it can be a recursion problem , but it 's mostly simply just a complexity problem . 
  it would take a lot of time to generate , and in the end it would be a jumbled , incomprehensible mess . 
  it would n't look good . 
  yes . 
  / politicallyopinionated, 
  straight stereotypes ? 
  i ca n't imagine that sort of thing . 
  since everyone automatically assumes that everyone they meet is straight , they ca n't actually build any sort of stereotype , can they ? 
  [ half-assed , immature insult ], 
  wow , you 're one of the people who got the bropak ? 
  may i ask why ? 
  i do n't understand why they sold less well than any of the other paks . 
  wow , before i saw what thread this was , i thought that someone was giving me personal advice . 
  count them ... ... 
  ### baaaaaaaacoooooooon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  good , that 's exactly what i wanted . 
  no , i mean it !, 
  i 'm happy you vote with discretion . 
  why ? 
  it 's been made quite clear that calliope is biologically dead , though . 
  caliborn can go to sleep and hear her name all he wants , but he 'll still be caliborn . 
  otherwise , `` calliope is dead '' would be meaningless to say . 
  solution : text to the left of images . 
  to be clear , i do understand that you are sarcastic, 
  her survey has done us all a favor . 
  that bar graph so perfectly illustrates reddit . 
  edit : misspelled `` perfectly '' as `` purrfectly '' . 
  looks like i make cat puns without even thinking about them . 
  besides `` none '' , the most popular answer was `` church '' . 
  why ? 
  acoustics ? 
  religious reasons ? 
  you are satan/a demon , and physically ca n't ? 
  oh no , do n't vandalize wikipedia ... :(, 
  really funny joke , though . 
  what inspired it ? 
  what 's wrong with romantic , though ? 
  this is perfect for a climax !,
