  but we can get more mileage out of it if we spread it out over more episodes ... 
  how did you ( not ? ), 
  do the jade double-hood ? 
  i ca n't see from here . 
  very good , but the mage costume has some sort of fucking cape , and the rogue costume a longer hood . 
  glad i missed that drama . 
  well fuck . 
  nope , disproven . 
  i ca n't remember how ( something to do with tavros and page stuff ) . 
  either way , mituna has a long heir hood and and the costume up there is breath anyway . 
  but sharing clothes does n't constiute an emotional bond . 
  i gave my neighbors my old clothes all the time . 
  huh . 
  i guess i have n't seen enough romance movies . 
  that makes the context pretty dirty . 
  i found this on the jerseystuck facebook group . 
  word of mouth is powerful , i guess . 
  think bigger !, 
  it does give the theory a bit more leverage . 
  but we can all agree that it 's not a confirmation . 
  is that always your comeback ? 
  i heard/hear it all the time even in primary school , but my father 's side is 100 % mathematicians , and one of them is a topologist ( if that 's a word ) . 
  i was using the word `` dirty '' to mean `` having to do with sex '' . 
  i did n't know it had any further strict connotation !, 
  heh , sorry , english is not my first language . 
  i infer meanings from literature . 
  thank you for explaining . 
  cool !, 
  thanks . 
  insert arctan or the logistic function for x. i 'd do it for you but it 's 3 am and i see others have beaten me to it . 
  actually , a very significant number of those backers were kickstarter regulars , meaning that they were only pledging because it was a popular kickstarter . 
  which is amazing . 
  they 're all infinitely dense spirals from one point to its opposite , are n't they ? 
  what 's wrong with the void and life colors ? 
  also , people used to think space was lime green . 
  assignments that require word-like properties , like default word margins and such . 
  really ? 
  huh . 
  me too . 
   of course , when we think about fireworks , we usually think about the chemistry involved ... 
  heads up from a person whose native tongue is a synthetic language , rhyming sounds terrible when it 's on morphological endings that mean the same thing . 
  it 's like trying to rhyme `` puppet '' and `` muppet '' , or `` stormcloud '' and `` raincloud '' : it 's fucking cheap . 
  { i actually do n't get the reference . 
  i mean , i see the reference a lot , but i do n't know where it comes from . }, 
  all i see is '' \\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\* \\* '', 
  / r/circlejerk has suffered a mortal wound , and is hemorrhaging blood all over the fucking place . 
  hungarian . 
  and we have, 
  lifdoff, 
  \\* explodes *, 
  thanks , i looked it up after i wrote this . 
  as someone who 's never had the time to learn regex , that jumble of parentheses and symbols in the ` split ` argument is hilariously incomprehensible to me . 
  hmm ? 
  iron engineering ? 
  right , but i mean in subsequent examples . 
  * that * i understood . 
  although i do n't understand why that did n't produce ` `` the shining '' ` , since it was told to split at the parenthesis , not one character before it . 
  it was n't heph\u00e6stus ; it was just an especially powerful monster , like those that the guardians are shown beating up in jack : ascend , but probably much tougher . 
  that was where my mind immediately went as well . 
  pretty tactful , but it sounds horrible because my brain keeps separating them . 
  i ca n't listen to it . 
  gamebro 1994 and gamegrl at least did n't torture the listener this way . 
  now i understand why people with perfect pitch give hate it when you play repetitive music . 
  edit : actually unite grlbrocrinization sounds very good . 
  forget karkat , think about kankri . 
  ... what is it ? 
  edit : http://electricboogiewoogie.com and http://movenowthinklater.com are * amazing *, 
  dust will be a problem . 
  i hope you keep it clean !, 
  two le 's , same characters . 
  my post  your post . 
  also :, 
  this is amazing . 
  i will use it sometime . 
  the trick is that it 's multiple tracks being played over each other , and once one track hits a low enough tone , a very high track is introduced over it , softer so that it 's not entirely obvious . 
  but you might have already known this . 
  no no , he 's talking [ a69ut ] ( / tg ) how witches used to be ... actually he 's right , there 's a lot to explain . 
  i 'll do the easy thing and say `` outside of homestuck '' . 
  intel !, 
  core i7-3770k !, 
  he can slow down time around him , brought the computer into his own personal time-bubble , and aged it 20 years . 
  ^ ( ca n't fucking get halo 4 until 3 years from now fuck ) ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ fuck, 
  ^ ( ( because mind your own fucking business ) ^ ), 
  huh , i though `` cmd + space '' was default . 
  i know what you mean . 
  i use dvorak , but with an added dead key on j to account for the double acute accent on some of the letters in my native language . 
  ( bonus points if you use google to figure out what it is . ), 
  i 'm guessing just a polynomial fit does n't cut it ? 
  you got me . 
  m\u00e0gy\u00e1ror\u00f2roror\u00f5ros\u017aag\u00ec it is . 
  ( also , polish has sz 's as well ! ), 
  but really , it 's fine if you can convey an arbitrary message with it to other people . 
  i 've been convinced for years that exponents do n't work . 
  i 'll try again tomorrow . 
  edit : this is amazing, 
  well , of course . 
  i 've graduated fifth grade . 
  i mean , other people who speak the language , dammit . 
  though i understood about 2/3 of what you wrote . 
  ( and no shut up it 's terrible for my eyes .
