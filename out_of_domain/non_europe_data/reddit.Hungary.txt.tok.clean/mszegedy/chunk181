  if only stable time loops are allowed , then we 'd have p = np and that would have serious implications in cryptography . 
  if it were anything else , and you could change the timeline , then someone would probably destroy it and information about it before anyone got to do anything significant with it . 
  the beauty of god 's creation is definitely one of the things that i attribute my interest in the subject to . 
  well , he did give us an opportunity for discussion . 
  the problem is that he was rude about it . 
  ohgodyes , you 're right . 
  view the source by selecting `` reply '' and then `` view original post '' . 
  did you downvote yourself, 
  we both know programming and give very few shits about things . 
  that 's it . 
  aaaaaand time to link to / r/marinebiology again . 
  that subreddit needs more publicity . 
  the funny thing is the more and more crabs that i study , the more and more crabs that i find out are inedible , and therefore the more my disgust at eating crabs grows . 
  and yet i 'm always so hungry for crab bisque and crab cakes . 
  biology is the field that i study , so this is definitely a subreddit that i visit . 
  but ... is n't that racist ? 
  i thought you 've been outed multiple times for being called tim . 
  or am i thinking of someone else ? 
  but you know which one it is , so you are able to visualize it . 
  no , the words `` sweet catch '' in green , the former word stacked on top of the latter . 
  would n't # 12 be a regular hexagon of side length * k * such that * k * is an element of z + ? 
  the rest are fucking impossible . 
  edit : i 'm an idiot , * any * two points . 
  well , fuck, 
  edit : # 17 , though , you could just convert into all natural logs and it would be fine . 
  what subdivision ? 
  you can see my flair , so you know what i do . 
  ( i am majoring in cheme alongside it , but only in bioe will i pursue phd . ), 
  slash shipping ? 
  now i 've seen everything . 
  what if they 're good friends of yours ? 
  or they 've known you for a week ? 
  two weeks ? 
  a month ? 
  two months ? 
  three months ? 
  it probably varies on a case-by-case basis . 
  win7 * enterprise * ? 
  this is a company computer ? 
  so ... cool ... 
  yup . 
  insulting ... to / r/iama ... what is this , a serious institution ? 
  have some perspective for heavens ' sake . 
  it 's not like we 're entitled to anything . 
  be glad he 's here at all . 
  he did not come here to be your conservative punching bag . 
  he 's the one who gets to choose which questions he answers . 
  one option is to wait it out until everybody forgets about it . 
  i think ... maybe i 'm getting trolled here ? 
  or are you actually racist ? 
  ( if you do happen to be racist , then you do n't have to reply , and i 'll take it as tacit verification . 
  best not to get into an argument and waste each others ' time . ), 
  of course . 
  ah , you remembered my submission from a while ago . 
  edit : [ porf ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/w490d/what_do_you_call_half_a_hundred_homestuck/ ), 
  then i am obligated to say that i reposted it from the jerseystuck facebook group . 
  i mentioned it in the post , but no one really cared . 
  it 's my luck that no one on jerseystuck is a redditor . 
  man , why even bother arguing with this guy ? 
  sure , his arrogance is enough to capture an asteroid or two as a moon , but i doubt you can do anything for him . 
  i 'd think that there are way more than 3 % of redditors that are under 15 . 
  not the majority , but certainly not 3 % . 
  its age distribution seems to be rather normal ( in form ) , centered obviously on undergrad-age , but also relatively flat . 
  apparently it was blatant racism . 
  i 'm not sure what kind , though . 
  i do n't find this ship especially plausible , either , but i 'm definitely more open to dave < 3 karkat . 
  because that one comic . 
  you know the one , where terezi was hatesnogging gamzee and then karkat was extremely sad and then dave hugged him from behind and was totally sweet . 
  the mass of his arrogance , then . 
  no doubt his mass as well , but i think there 's enough fatty-shaming on reddit . 
  although some of it is legitimate . 
  i still do n't understand a word of what you wrote !, 
  maybe try using some of these : . 
  , : ; '' treat them with care . 
  there 's a power difference here , though . 
  she was physically much weaker than the guy who punched her . 
  this is a rather poor comparison , but do you laugh every time an overgrown bully punches a midget kid in the face ? 
  but you were sober enough to conceive that sentence and grasp it in your mind ? 
  ow , my temporal lobe . 
  careful about saying `` everyone on reddit '' . 
  you know it is n't true , and ever since that one theoryofreddit post about it , those who scrutinize us have this concept that the reddit counterculture thinks that they are superior to the `` average redditor '' and thinks that the `` average redditor '' is a terrible shithead . 
  maybe if we avoid making generalizations like that in our speech , that conception would go away ? 
  then why care what * anyone * thinks ? 
  e ^ ( i\u03c0 / 2 ), 
  that tv must be at least ten years old . 
  maybe twenty . 
  i do n't have enough emotional subtlety to discern whether that 's actually romantic or just platonic . 
  i 'll leave it to those who do . 
  [ avoid grad school at all costs !, 
  wahaha i can relate . 
  i 've so far done this more times than i 've built a computer with a case . 
  * tax maybe ? 
  they do like to mention it a zillion times in the instructions . 
  i did . 
  i do n't remember why , though . 
  i do n't usually read instructions unless i 'm having problems , and i was n't . 
  now i remember !, 
  i was convinced that they had n't included enough standoffs . 
  but they had . 
  i just spent an entire , literal minute laughing at this .
