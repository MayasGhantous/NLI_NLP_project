  that 's okay , we still have sburb . 
  ^ ^ ^ sosorry, 
  gaaaah that was n't planned as such . 
  hussie just left that there so that if he ever needed to kill a cat , then the sassacre book was the thing to use . 
  i still do n't understand the direct connection . 
  i know these things , and it 's obvious that they are related ironically somehow , but i ca n't put my finger on how . 
  his head needs to be about four times bigger . 
  otherwise , it 's really cool !, 
  what 's wrong with the imperial system ? 
  this is coming from someone who grew up on the metric system . 
  okay , the [ prices and values ] ( / dunkass ) are unintuitive ( 12 inches in a foot , 3 feet in a yard , some number of yards in a mile , 16 ounces in a gallon but 8 ounces in a pound ) , but why does that make it better ? 
  if you 've already memorized both , what 's the difference ? 
  i detect someone still getting the hang of english !, 
  ( your sewing skills are fine , btw ; i 'd love a plush like that . ), 
  a note on sentences where you describe something : you * always * have to include the verb `` to be '' . 
  you would have to put the word `` am '' after `` i '' so that you can say something about yourself : `` i * am * not really good at sewing . '', 
  every sentence in english has at least one verb . 
  it 's pretty stupid , i know ; this was hard for me to learn , because in my language you drop `` to be '' most of the time . 
  i suspect you speak a similar language , so i just want to warn you that you have to say the verb in english \\* all the time . \\*, 
  so that 's what that stands for !, 
  people always use `` dota '' here to refer to a game , and i never knew what it stood for , but it never really occurred to me to google it , for some reason . 
  omg . 
  oh my god , i 'm so sorry !, 
  that was so stupid of me . 
  you must feel so offended !, 
  heh , i do n't really know anything about english grammar ; they were just pretty ... thorough ... in teaching it in hungary . 
  ( yes i 'm here from that one thread , shh ), 
  * decimal * ? 
  whatever for ? 
  a day is about 86,400.002 seconds , depending on time of year . 
  you want to decimalize that ? 
  better stick to useful units . 
  yes , i think a second is a good unit of time . 
  it suits us easily . 
  just like a meter and a yard are intuitive measurements because they can be easily related to the body , as , say , spans of the arm , the second is intuitive because it is very close to the time it takes for one heartbeat to occur . 
  maybe a bit quicker . 
  a * lot * of things in the body are defined by the heartbeat . 
  it 's easy to conceptualize amounts of time in seconds not because of indoctrination , but because it 's close to what 's already in our own minds . 
  but he did n't overtly think to himself 2-3 years ago , `` okay , i 'm going to foreshadow here that jaspers is going to die from getting the book appearified on himself by roxy '' . 
  all he did was go , `` i am going to say something about killing a cat with this book . 
  this might pay off later if i actually want to kill a cat . '', 
   asia ( where there are many more pedestrian collisions and governmental standards regulating them ), 
  does this validate that one stereotype ? 
  ( not that i am looking for validation ), 
  these are * excellent * . 
  i love every last one of them . 
  good job to the creator for making them look properly like kids , too . 
  what 's terezi doing with her hands , though ? 
  well , but you still have to find an actual tattoo artist in the area you 're permitted to be in in order to get a tattoo in prison . 
  it 's not like you jam the needle into your own skin or whatever . 
  there 's semi-proper business involved . 
  there is a resident tattoo artist . 
  hell , maybe even two . 
  you pay them cash , which they use to buy things . 
  he has black pupils . 
  i think that officially makes him not an albino . 
  whenever someone says that the kids ca n't be a particular race . 
  * why ? 
  * what characteristics about them make them any particular race ? 
  * why * ca n't you envision a person of x race in their place ? 
  does it have to do with the way they act ? 
  why ca n't a person of x race act that way ? 
  you do n't have to conform to racial stereotypes in even the slightest to be a member of a race . 
  if you ca n't imagine a person of x race doing y thing , then that 's racism . 
  a corollary : if you hear about y thing being done and immediately think that the perpetrator is x race , that is likewise racism . 
  this applies to homestuck . 
  * surely * you have enough imagination to get over the fact that their skins are physically represented as white ? 
  then what is the problem ? 
  i like windypaws . 
  two characters do n't have to meet to be a legitimate ship . 
  it 's fine to think , `` oh , they 'd be so cute together ! '', 
  or similar things . 
  try to * hypothetically * imagine them together . 
  would it work out ? 
  if you think so , then it 's a legitimate ship . 
  edit : oh , come on , three downvoters . 
  i 'm actually very interested in your points . 
  so if you 'd please make a comment so that i can read them ... ? 
  ] ( http://albinisim101honors.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/bee83_lux7_l.jpg.w300h358.jpg ) it seems to affect , at least , different species differently . 
  it 's definitely possible that both variants exist . 
  i 'm down with the whole `` albinism '' idea in theory , since the striders wear shades and the lalondes live in dark places . 
  but i figured it would be a tiny bit more obvious if they were albinos . 
  the age of this joke is measured in * years * . 
  why are you making it ? 
  ( something something `` all your base '' `` rickroll '' `` in ur base '' [ even older memes ] ), 
  die , racist scum !, 
  but you get a pass on that one . 
  although it 's probably happened before . 
   people are way too passionate about their headcanons, 
  i tried to make this argument about the people who withdrew their kickstarter bids because of the tarot cards , and got called ~ ~ a racist ~ ~ a shithead . 
  how do you do it ? 
  to the rest of your post : i see how that can get in the way . 
  i myself can mostly only visualize them by taking a very general view of their features , and forgetting most details . 
  [ ` t\u03b5r\u03b5zi ] . 
  if forced to give an anglicization , then i 'll give you [ ` t\u03b5\u0279\u03b5zi ] . 
  i do n't see how . 
  ( `` mit-you-na '' is how i pronounce it . ), 
  but really , he does a very good job at making it clear to people who might not know this . 
  edit : come on , this is reddit . 
  why ca n't we at least assume that everyone knows their periodic tables ?
