  dude , imagine if your house was alive . 
  and stung intruders . 
  life is awesome for these fish . 
  you are not getting orangered today , mr. evil-ploy !, 
  i would n't say it 's bad . 
  your opinion was based on something , and , generally , an opinion is better than no opinion . 
  it 's all good as long as you remain open to persuasion by the other side of the argument . 
  but he * does * know something about it . 
  or , at least , he thought he did . 
  reddit told him that they were n't serious headphones . 
  that 's something . 
  some skepticism would 've been helpful , but it did n't really hurt me . 
  jerk level : [ = = -------- ], 
  brave level : [ = = = = = = = = -- ], 
  left level : [ -- \u2022 ------- ] < - pretty far left, 
  wit level : [ = = = = = = = -- ], 
  humor level : [ = = = ------- ], 
  to be honest i ca n't completely distinguish the personalities of obama and romney . 
  if you gave me a handful of quotes from them that were n't about policy , and told me to guess which ones are obama and romney , i 'd do badly . 
  can anyone explain what makes them different in this aspect to me , in detail ? 
   a telling sign : the best `` insulting '' nickname they could come up with for him was `` mittens '' . 
  `` r-money '' was a pretty good one . 
  not even everyone on reddit ? 
  i mean , obviously not 100 % of everyone , but most people on here are of scientific background , or have at least graduated high school , where they should have hopefully learned their periodic tables . 
  neither do i. i only only know ( roughly ) atomic mass . 
  you really should know at least the leftmost and rightmost columns of the periodic table , if not even by specific numbers . 
  air is like 20 % oxygen gas ( atomic number 8 , atomic mass 16 ; this is definitely something * everyone * should know ) , and 80 % nitrogen ( atomic number 7 , atomic mass 14 ; i am assuimg the average redditor knows this ) , giving it a mean molecular mass of 30 . 
  helium and neon are obviously much too light , since they 're only in the first two rows . 
  fuck argon , for some reason . 
  the other two are properly `` towards the bottom of the table '' , where atomic masses start to get pretty huge . 
  you do n't even need numbers for this ; it 's just common sense . 
  these fuckers are going to sink . 
  comments on news articles seem like they might have some effect, 
  it gives you le-color text . 
  edit : holy shit , i visited it from a browser and oh my god . 
  really ? 
  it was in modmail . 
  :\\ i requested it . 
  i have n't really seen any extremely fanboyish/fangirlish people on here . 
  there are occasionally people who use `` moirail '' and `` matesprit '' like they are actual words , and there are * very * occasionally people who type in quirks , but both of these are only minor cases of fanchildism and are rectified quickly once they realize that it 's not socially acceptable here . 
  it 's not like we have trollkin or anything of that sort . 
  then again , i 've been on here for less than half the sub 's lifetime , so i 'm not necessarily a good judge . 
  whoa , what the fuck ? 
  that definitely was n't my idea . 
  more to the point , why was the username `` lord_english '' not registered yet , and why did whoever registered it ( 3 guesses ) use all lowercase ? 
  pfft , like anyone * chooses * their employers . 
  unless they 're incredibly accomplished and well-known in their fields .

  pfftheheh , got ta love that [ hypotrochoid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypotrochoid ) curve that wants to look like a 10/7 epitrochoid ( spirograph ) . 
  i 'll post some serious musical criticism later . 
  i like this one better than witc ) ( ing hour/fuchsia ruler , though . 
  the highest possible iteration is something like 7 or 8 , and someone 's already done it by hand . 
  unless you use mods to extend the height limit . 
  edit : never mind , i 'm stupid , i was thinking of something else ; i was thinking of the menger sponge, 
  it has to be scripts . 
  nobody would be masochistic enough to place all those floating blocks . 
  i love this to death . 
  i wish my place had a mural like this . 
  rexono = andrew hussie confirmed, 
  that 's an interesting choice of hair for roxy . 
  also , just , `` brown '' ? 
  but what makes it sure that it 's caused by us ? 
  i 'd settle for `` balls shrinking in cold '' . 
  you can read the thread . 
  let me dig it up .

  regardless of the console 's actual quality or features , i 'm destined to get it , buy smb u , mario kart u , and ssb u for it ( whenever those games come out ) , and play it with my friends for another decade or so . 
  copypastas , you say ? 
  here 's my favorite ( i take all the credit for popularizing it ) :, 
  it should be noted that i 've upvoted every single person who 's disagreed with me here , as far as i know . 
  that said . 
  in 7th grade , i took an sat test without preparing for it at all , it was spur-of-the-moment , i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did n't do any research or anything . 
  i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area . 
  an iq test has shown me to be in the 99.9 th percentile for iq . 
  this is the highest result the test i was given reaches ; anything further and they 'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test . 
  my mother 's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech . 
  at the age of 15 , i understand physics better than him , and i owe very little of it to him , as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything , just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics . 
  he 's not particularly successful as an engineer , but i 've met lots of other engineers who are n't as good as me at physics , so i 'm guessing that 's not just a result of him being bad at it . 
  i 'm also pretty good at engineering . 
  i do n't have a degree , and other than physics i do n't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer , but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things . 
  for example , i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were , and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions ( my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy ; admittedly not the best plan ) . 
  i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i 've come across . 
  every question of existentialism which i 've seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else , the thoughts have n't been new to me . 
  philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me ; i 've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is . 
  psychology , i actually understand better than people with degrees . 
  unlike engineering , there 's no aspect of psychology which i do n't have a very good understanding of . 
  i can debunk many of even sigmund freud 's theories . 
  i 'm a good enough writer that i 'm writing a book and so far everybody who 's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published . 
  and that 's not just , like , me and family members , that counts strangers on the internet . 
  i 've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far ; people have critiqued it , but not insulted it . 
  i do n't know if that will suffice as evidence that i 'm intelligent . 
  i 'm done with it , though , because i 'd rather defend my maturity , since it 's what you 've spent the most time attacking . 
  the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code . 
  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future . 
  if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii , i would be against executing him . 
  in fact , if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was n't just faking it , i 'd even support the concept of letting him go free . 
  this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future , and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self 's actions , it should n't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment , especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them .
