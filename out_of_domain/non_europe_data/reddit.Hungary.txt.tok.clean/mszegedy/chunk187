  lack of trust in the company . 
  and it 's definitely not your fault . 
  it 's a symptom of statistical unreliability , and valve not being able to create an environment that the consumer feels secure using . 
  valve has its own history of * errors * , and , while making it more human and relatable , it also leads you to conceive a possibility of failure . 
  * is * there a possibility of failure ? 
  well , evidence leads us to say `` yes '' . 
  steam is not the ultimate , unhackable platform . 
  valve * can * fuck up , and if it does , your dependency on it for games definitely makes it a weak point . 
  however , the performance of companies depends in large part on your confidence in them . 
  confidence brings cash , and a large part of that cash is used to ameliorate the company . 
  but it 's a vicious cycle in both directions . 
  on one end , you have hyperbolically dropping confidence , correlating with a decrease in revenue and quality , which affects the confidence even more . 
  on the other end , you have the inverse : as confidence increases , so does revenue and quality , increasing confidence further . 
  with this in mind , could we have a little more faith in the companies that serve us ? 
  if we believe hard enough , it might just become true . 
  slightly different : / r/randomactsoftextbooks, 
  some of the points are bogus , but the rest are pretty convincing . 
  the whole blood thing completely derails it , though . 
  the author seems to be forgetting that cherubs aren ' f trolls , there ; there is no reason for their biologies to be related to each ofher anyway . 
  what even is a homestuck tabletop ? 
  ohh , as in tabletop rpg !, 
  i get it now , thanks . 
  now * that 's * a stretch . 
  gah , class and aspect titles can only be one syllable each . 
  ouch , my sensibilities !, 
  great article , but dat fucking thumbnail . 
  this is pretty ambiguously defined ( but cool ) . 
  why is `` ah '' on there ? 
  are `` natural '' interjections words now ? 
  if so , why is n't `` um '' on there ? 
  and i see that the word `` light '' is in there . 
  is it just the adjective ? 
  is it the noun ? 
  is it both ? 
  if so , does it count as one , or two ? 
  if the adjective is part of it , then is `` lighter '' a separate word , or is it recognized as an inflection of the adjective ? 
  `` lighter '' is also a noun . 
  if it allows `` lighter '' , does that mean i can also say `` lighters '' ? 
  `` light '' has a third homograph , too : it 's a verb as well . 
  can i put `` lights '' ? 
  some things just are n't so simple . 
  `` everything i love dies ! '', 
  `` quick , love jack noir ! '', 
  yeah , but , statistically speaking , things should have gone nonlinearly at least once by now . 
  but even a sample like this . 
  is n't it suspicious that all of the important plot events just happen to happen in the right chronological order ? 
  ( write that one up for / r/nocontext . ), 
  it 's unlikely , especially given how twisted the furthest ring is . 
  i 'm only playing devil 's advocate . 
  i think the fact that the plot is linear can be attributed to the theory of narrative causality : it 's convenient for the plot . 
  however , either there are inferences to be made from this about the furthest ring , or it 's very , very , unusual . 
  blah , at least it runs . 
  fact : i 've never been able to run tf2 on my computer , because it complained that my graphics card was too shitty . 
  ( it 's a laptop . ), 
  what makes you so sure that this is part of a jerk ? 
  restaurants where you have sex with the animal before eating it are ludicrous in any context . 
  you do realize that you 're defending someone who fucks animals , right ? 
  our ancestors have been eating meat for tens of thousands of years . 
  and that 's just homo sapiens sapiens . 
  but if it 's arbitrary , how do we know where to draw the line ? 
  while i agree with you , you only think that having bestiality is nasty because it is status quo . 
  it 's possible to be taught , * ab tabula rasa * , that there is nothing wrong with bestiality ( but having sex with a tree is not okay ) . 
  what makes * this * status quo better than any other status quo ? 
  there are answers to that question , but to find them , you * do * have to get into why bestiality is objectively immoral ( i.e. 
  rape ) . 
  btw , http://sometimesredsometimesblue.com , for a more minimalistic/general version of this . 
  ah , now * this * is why i stay up until 4 am . 
  `` small subset '' ? 
  more like `` majority '' . 
  you bastard . 
  i 'm still broke from the kickstarter . 
  playing the other side of the argument now : just because something is natural does n't mean that it should be . 
  for example , some gorillas practice infanticide . 
  that does not make infanticide okay . 
  you could argue that just things that are natural for humans are okay for humans , but there are other counterarguments for that ; for example , the penis tip is shaped in a manner such that , during intercourse , it removes the sperm of competing males . 
  does that mean that we should give up monogamy ? 
  the last time anyone tried to apply natural phenomena to ethical thinking , we got social darwinism , and i do n't think anyone 's advocating that , either . 
  but you 're using pretty much the same argument as social darwinism , except inverted : the former was `` it 's natural , qed '' , and this is `` it 's not natural , qed '' . 
  there are lots of things in our society that are n't natural , but no one 's saying that they 're bad . 
  i agree with your conclusion , i just do n't think your argument is sound . 
  okay . 
  i know that feeling . 
  once , not long ago , i asked / r/anarchism to justify anarchy . 
  it went on for days . 
  yes . 
  okay , but what * is * an rss feed ? 
  wait , what 's the joke ? 
  the physicist got it correct . 
  ah you see, 
  i have a problem, 
  with singing, 
  does that count as a mini-haiku ? 
  3-5-3 instead of 5-7-5 . 
  pretty interesting video , but ... what the fuck ? 
  is that all cgi , or ... what ? 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  though i do n't think you 're agreeing with me . 
  except now he 's deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaad !!!!!!!!!!, 
  he killed all the trolls ? 
  the only trolls he killed were nepeta and equius .
