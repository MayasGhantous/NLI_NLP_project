  the rest died differently . 
  obviously still enough for a just death , though , especially since he desecrated their corpses afterwards ( ... wtf ? 
  just any radian angle that you can calculate the sine/cosine/tangent of without a calculator . 
  no no , one wing is a smiley , and the other is a frowny . 
  that has been canon ever since that word was first prefixed by the word `` motherfucking '' on andrew hussie 's tumblr . 
  i am prepared to post a humongous `` dude you totally called it '' . 
  i 'm still not entirely convinced that he 's not god tier . 
  i mean , why would he cosplay as god tier in the first place ? 
  fucking finally , right ? 
  god-tiers are n't very immortal . 
  they do n't age , but if you 're killed , it 's hard to hit that gray area between `` just '' and `` heroic '' . 
  six people already answered the question before you . 
  why did you feel the need to post a seventh response ? 
  easily a neutral death ? 
  are you so quick to forgive the deaths of nepeta and equius ? 
  how could you ? 
  of course . 
  i 'll bet tavros could do it even better . 
  good point . 
  thank you !, 
  i vote this `` most helpful in thread '' . 
  man , would n't it be cool if we could do stuff like confirm answers , like on stackexchange network ? 
  seriously . 
  and every carapacian ever , included but not limited to the white queen , black queen , ar , snowman , the b1/2 hb 's , b1 cd , every single b1 carapacian except pm , etc. 
  also , b1 session 's bilious slick . 
  for that matter , a2 session 's bilious slick . 
  also , hussie got a `` dead '' , but he 's perfectly fine . 
  it 's more of a list of exceptions to a rule than a rule . 
  exactly . 
  let me draw upon new series doctor who for a moment . 
  remember how the doctor went an entire series with his death looming before him ? 
  and remember how the first thing we saw of river was her death , years and years ago , and she 's * still * in the show ? 
  this is good for drama . 
  hussie would never waste the opportunity . 
  no , pi/6 !, 
  funnily enough , 1 does n't have an easily expressible sine , cosine , or tangent . 
  it 's all good for sin ^ ( -1 ) , cos ^ ( -1 ) , tan ^ ( -1 ) , etc. , though ; it 's pi/2 , 0 , and pi/4 , respectively . 
  i have the same problem , often . 
  but i do n't get get to use extension cords . 
  ah , i mean anything with vocals . 
  certain operas are an exception . 
  ( like leoncavallo ... \\* swooooon * ... ), 
  is this what we 're doing now ? 
  homestuck + / b / ? 
  because the `` photoshop the weird eldritch glow '' one was funny because it was relevant , but this one completely lacks context and is only funny as an injoke , which is n't something very funny at all . 
  we still have legitimate discussion threads outside of updates . 
  i just posted one the other day ( was it 4:00 am this morning , or the morning before ? ) . 
  and , it was n't so long ago that someone made something cool ... the most recent that i can remember is that there was the girl with that vriska arm . 
  i shoulda tagged her !, 
  i do n't think that was more than a month ago , was it ? 
  ( also , there * is * / r/truehomestuck , but i 'd prefer that that place remain virgin for the moment . 
  this subreddit is far from awful or irreparable . ), 
   the only book i 've ever encountered that was able to keep up language such as this for 150 pages was a clockwork orange by anthony burgess . 
  from here , i can see , far off in the distance , finnegan 's wake . 
  to be fair , we have n't seen hussie yet . 
  no , do n't !, 
  that was * my * premise . 
  hussie ca n't take that away from me !, 
  he just ca n't !, 
  what about armant erebus and that other fantroll ? 
  when are they going to show up ? 
  99.99999999 % probably not here , but it should be soon . 
  tbf , there was n't much else it could have been . 
  i 'm sort of vaguely reminded of the red star from bionicle , but the thing seemed grounded and small rather than an eldritch facility hiding out in space . 
  i do n't follow . 
  why ar in particular ? 
  i mean , the hal-9000 visual reference does point that way sort of , but it far from clinches it . 
  there 's no plot reason that it could be ar . 
  hash tables are the way to go . 
  ( except not really ; they 're pretty much the opposite of what we 're looking for . 
  but you guys took all the good ones ! ), 
  be-a-you-tiffle . 
  beayoutiffle . 
  beee - * you * tiffle . 
  beyoutiffle ? 
  byoutiffle . 
  byou ... * tifful * . 
  byoutifful . 
  tiff ... tiff ... * tif * . 
  byoutiful . 
  byoutiful ; byou ... you ... * yu * tiful . 
  byutiful . 
  byutiful , byutiful , byutiful . 
  byeahutiful . 
  b * yea * utiful . 
  * beautiful . 
  * beautiful !, 
  beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !, 
  beatuiful ? 
  ( i do n't think the `` trick '' works very well . ), 
  tautologies are usually either karma grabs or not karma grabs . 
  fear not !, 
  as we speak , i am avenging you !, 
  i eat * fields and fields * of the things * literally * for breakfast . 
  i have crucified more pairs of vectors than any other person * in the galaxy * . 
  i use advanced guerilla tactics to locate them , even the pesky eigenvector vermin hiding in matrices . 
  locate them ... to * exterminate * them . 
  you can let me take care of the vector-crunching for you . 
  wonderful passage , but it does n't really appeal to me because it makes it sound like only weak people need christ , which is simply not true . 
  christ is for * everyone .
