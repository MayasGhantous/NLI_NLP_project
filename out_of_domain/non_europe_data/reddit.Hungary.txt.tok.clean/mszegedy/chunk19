  `` you should speak me [ in the future ] '' ? 
  :d i really did forget to show how to show the indirect object , did n't i. . . 
  i think i 'll go stealth-edit it back in . 
  let 's say postposition `` daxh '' means `` to '' , in the lative sense ( not the `` indirect object '' sense , the two of which are barely different really ; i want to have another postposition to clarify that though ) . 
  so then :, 
  ( do note that i did n't make any effort to match the romanization up with the df alphabet at all . 
  i like the phonology a lot , though ; i worked very hard at making it dwarfy . 
  the alphabet can change , but my life before the phonology . 
  let 's say \u00e2 is / \u028c\u02d0 / , and invent similar suprasegmental modifications as we go along . ), 
  heh , i recently went through the experience of building a pc because i was a bit fed up with mac . 
  it 's built mostly from amd parts , though ( unlike your intel-based comp ) . 
  the motherboard is asrock , but has an amd chipset ; the optical drive is asus , the ram is crucial ( * obviouslyyy * ) , and the hard drive is seagate . 
  but processor and extra gfx card ? 
  totally amd . 
  oh , and the case is frisby . 
  why do you call them gimmicky ? 
  the ps vita supports practically photorealistic graphics ; i love the way those detailed pictures fall on my eyes . 
  and the 3ds 's 3d graphics are not a gimmick either ; it 's the improvement , and it 's a really big one . 
  i was endlessly excited for it ... viewing 3d like that , without glasses or * anything * , is just an amazing experience . 
  it 's like those 3d displays that they have in futuristic movies are finally here ... 
  they 're both graphics upgrades , in two really different and nearly equally awesome ways . 
  they actually improve the experience , a lot . 
  that 's not a gimmick . 
  it 's kind of a ways down . 
  i 'm not going to go throuh the tedium of opening df now , but i believe the bottom number was in the 20s or 30s . 
  if you embark on a glacier , for example , you need to find a cavern * right away * ... unless you 're awesome , anyway . 
  actually , i have a special embark profile for glaciers . 
  each dwarf is trained in 3 military arts with successively less proficiency , plus some basic skill in dodging . 
  ... hello ? 
  the guy who wrote that was an idiot anyway, 
  killed it, 
  my first fort = aquifer embark ; i managed to keep myself up with a ton of farming , but eventually i lost because of lack of any stone whatsoever . 
  it depends on what sort of plastic the keys were made out of ... 
  [ well ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=006386 ), 
  * before * entry ? 
  from now on this is what i show to people when they ask what homestuck is . 
  it 's sbahj, 
  meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  my first alchemy was with a sonic toothbrush . 
  eventually i alchemized it with a cyclotron . 
  needs more elephants . 
  and lava . 
  have you ever had a broker ? 
  most of it 's just [ s ] enter . 
  the rest is [ s ] rose : fast forward to now , some scrapbook stuff , and ... 
  i do n't remember when the `` take mah laptop '' scene is from . 
  i have now watched this more times than cascade . 
  not a big deal , seeing that it 's like ten seconds long . 
  of course . 
  it 's really efficient . 
  this is what i do with my children . 
  around 50 % die , which is not enough . 
  i love how there 's like none of the actual mountain remaining . 
  no picks ? 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; how ... elven . 
  when every last dwarf of mine dies . 
  hmm . 
  not doubting you , but why ? 
  [ s ] dave : accelerate . 
  has worked out surprisingly well for me , even after five seconds . 
  it usually only happens when i embark on a glacier and my first seven die nearly immediately in the caves , but there 's that . 
  you 're mixing recipes . 
  a sign is one stick , six planks , and a pickaxe is two sticks , three planks . 
  two planks yields four sticks , so one stick is half a plank . 
  1/2 ( 1 ) + 6 = 6\u00a01/2 , and 1/2 ( 2 ) + 3 = 4 . 
  so , objectively , signs really are more expensive than pickaxes . 
  however , say you only had logs . 
  how many logs is a pickaxe , and how many a sign ? 
  for a sign , you need two : the first one gets you two planks for the sticks , and the first two for the top , and the other gets you the remaining four planks , leaving a tidy remainder of one stick . 
  a pickaxe also needs two logs : you use up one for the two planks for the two sticks , and you get two for the top , but you still need another one plank for the top , so you have to use up another log . 
  you 're left with three planks and two sticks , objectively more than one stick . 
  so yeah , no matter how you look at it , it costs the same or more to make a sign than a pickaxe . 
  things can be game breakers even if they are actually implemented , but that does n't make this one . 
  i 've always legitimately wondered what would happen if i made a sphere out of a one-way mirror , and made the inside a mirror . 
  what would ? 
  ... huh ? 
  really ? 
  i must see the op for this . 
  that 's the height of the ceiling , which is a hell of a lot more than the minimal 3 . 
  [ yes , see above .

  he 's talking about the initial area he mined out that we are seeing , not the pyramid . 
  go to germany and buy the ones they have there : * die siedlers von catan * , i believe . 
  i do n't know what edition that qualifies as , but you get honest-to-god water tiles , and simple watercolor artwork . 
  i have a hungarian version of the original and the cities and knights expansion , plus fourth edition versions of seafarers and the original . 
  is there any way to control the size and distribution of the clouds in photoshop 's `` render clouds '' ? 
  ( i plan to do bump maps for lohac as well . ), 
  edit : and is it possible to make them tile vertically as well ? 
  edit 2 : never mind , i kinda solved those problems . 
  [ fixed album here . 
  edit 3 : i plan to do lowas next , based on [ this ] ( http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/medium ) . 
  holy * shit * . 
  yup !, 
  i 'll add a `` bump map '' later . 
  i wan na do all the textures first , though . 
  edit : and check out the new render , i think it 's a million times better . 
  where do you live ? 
  and you can always order it , i 'll bet ... 
  for a moment there i thought ar was relevant to the exile . 
  then i was like oh .
