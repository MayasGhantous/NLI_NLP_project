  yeah , all the recent astounding cosplay submissions in this subreddit have me doubting my abilities . 
  it 's been a very humbling week . 
  does `` race jerk '' = = `` racism '' ? 
  dude , this is going to cost you so much . 
  * why ? 
  * i am very grateful , but * why ? 
  * surely even very rich people have things that they could better rationalize spending money on . 
  this comment made you seem very untrustworthy !, 
  whoa . 
  how did you find this thread ? 
  the only way i can think of is through the `` submitted '' on my profile . 
  oh , nothing so contrived . 
  it 's just that there 's a little bit of everything in everything . 
  of course , it 's measured . 
  certain kinds of minerals , for example , have a particularly high likelihood of having a few atoms of francium in them . 
  a low , but distinct probability . 
  here , our subject is theoretically made of pure carbon-12 . 
  but the atomic mass of carbon is n't listed as twelve , is it ? 
  it 's 12.011 . 
  that 's to account for that there 's actually a bit of carbon-13 , carbon-14 , etc. 
  in it with increasingly low probabilities . 
  there probably * is , * just by chance , just a bit of carbon-14 in there , already radioactive , and there could also be heavier isotopes in there as well ; just a few atoms . 
  there 's probably a lot of other elements in there , too , caught by the atom . 
  maybe one of them is francium . 
  who knows ? 
  i thought it was '' [ i thought * that * was obvious ] ( / ga ) '', 
  maybe it was a large envelope that contained two smaller envelopes . 
  you get to my age , you see shit like that . 
  me too . 
  my heart actually started hammering before i even clicked on the link . 
  i could hardly hear the audio from the blood in my ears ( or whatever makes it hard to hear when you 're completely terrified ) . 
  i had to listen to it again . 
  whoa . 
  i did n't know anyone browsed that far back . 
  good for you . 
  inconceivable !, 
  i love all of it . 
  i would have given karkat a huge mouth , though . 
  [ text ] \\ ( / lordenglishsecrettext ) = =  [ text ] ( / lordenglishsecrettext ), 
  edit : no, 
  shit, 
  let 's try this again, 
  [ text ] \\ ( / le ) = =  [ text ] ( / le ), 
  [ ] ( / yourewelcome ), 
  right , sorry , that 's why i edited . 
  * inception . 
  especially in light of recent concerns regarding the environment . 
  to make it be seen more than how you have it : `` i sit on the * w * eb a lot . '', 
  that 's sort of ironic from the kankri perspective . 
  after all , he was greatly interested in social justice . 
  do you type these during lectures , or what ? 
  signed , a freshman, 
  you mean * i * can do this * too ? 
  he 's probably saying so because it might look like a chemical reaction if you have n't heard about gallium 's amazing melting point . 
  who even gets to the idea of making a gallium spoon ? 
  but that 's okay !, 
  i do n't like it , because it 's always interesting to see who 's posted the latest update . 
  i mean , not so much who , but there 's more of a feeling of community behind the user-controlled update posts than the bot-controlled ones . 
  plus there 's always the secret hope that someday i 'll post it . 
  huh ? 
  ( sorry , this is n't a challenge ; i just do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  the trait of fixing one 's flaws is in no way associated with america afaik . ), 
   a skill set , that while valuable , has little real world application out side of cs, 
  i disagree . 
  being able to make a computer do a whole lot of thinking for you is immensely valuable in at the very least academic professions . 
  that 's why we use mathematica/matlab/maple . 
  well , it 's not like i can find it , so you 're safe . 
   plus wiki.teamfortress.com does n't have ads . 
  is n't that a good thing ? 
   elements of statistical inference, 
  statistical * learning * , right ? 
  thanks !, 
  i know : matrix addition , multiplication , inverses , and determinants , and vector addition , dot products , cross products , norms , and determinants , and eigenvectors . 
  i 'm also reasonable confident in my ability to work with vector fields , although i have never had any formal education that pertains exclusively to them ( but i have learned about gradients and divergence and curl ) . 
  is that enough ? 
  oh , it is n't about reposting ? 
  :( ( i completely ignored the second part of your comment for five minutes straight . ), 
  why ? 
   context-sensitive input assistant, 
  fucking finally, 
  well , they look like fish . 
  yeah , i 'm waiting for a flash that picks up right where '' [ s ] jane : enter . '', 
  did , musically . 
  that would be sweet . 
  that 's how they do it ? 
  hrrrrnnk ... 
  they 're the undo button . 
  this extends from simple time-jumping to the scratch . 
  it means that if there 's a function that i 'm unaware of and i type the first letter or two of its name , i 'll become aware of it , and several functions with similar names . 
  it also means that it takes less keystrokes to type things like `` standardnormaldistribution [ ] '' . 
  i thought gallium was too poisonous to do that ? 
  but , anyway , i 've always compared it to chocolate ; that also has a melting point right below body temperature . 
  now i 'm tempted to try to make a chocolate spoon , and ~ ~ do bending tricks with it ~ ~ ~ ~ eat chocolate cereal with it ~ ~ stir hot chocolate with it oh my god that would be so good ... . 
  yeah , but this way it * shows * me before i type it . 
  it 's hard to disagree with a robotics professor , then . 
  \\* cough cough * ... 
  i think i 've been infected ... 
  i guess i meant to say what five days in a lab * wo n't * get you . 
  just like every other relationship ever ? 
  it 's only particularly apparent here because dirk is such a strong character .
