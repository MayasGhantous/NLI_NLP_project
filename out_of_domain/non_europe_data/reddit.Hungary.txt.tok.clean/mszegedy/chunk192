  oh my god how could you type all that out, 
  that is a usage of copy/paste that i have n't considered . 
  i still do n't buy into aspect duality theory . 
  in any way . 
  not knowing beforehand what kingdom hearts was besides a popular fantasy rpg , this is the impression that i got . 
  the impression that i get from your comment is that my first impression may be wrong . 
  it sounds like people draw characters with keyblades because they are a cool and unique weapon . 
  i can get behind that . 
  what you should really do is make a table of two-dimensional coordinates . 
  fakedata is your fake data that you generated based on the fit . 
  thanks !, 
  http://khanacademy.com has good lectures on that material , too . 
  as a biologist , concerning the film ... 
  does autocad have any parametric draw ? 
  because that could have been used to create , at least , the sburb spirograph . 
  most of them look like something out of dr. seuss . 
   [ happy birt ^ ( h ) day janey !!!!, 
  ftfy, 
   remember , he 's a void player , so him being in a sprite on his own makes sense . 
  - equius is a void player, 
  - for all void players , ???? 
  implies something about being in a sprite on one 's own, 
  - therefore equius will be a sprite on his own, 
  what is the ???? 
  there 's a noticeable and therefore significant amount of foreshadowing that sprites do n't last very long anyway . 
   complimentary, 
  whereas all the a2 , and i 'm assuming a1 as well , sprites are dead . 
  but they 're all sort of special cases , especially aradiasprite . 
  what i meant was all the business with davesprite losing hair and stuff . 
  wait , really ? 
  i can use `` complimentary '' to describe colors ? 
  that changes * everything * . 
  well , a bit . 
  but i mean , `` complimentary '' , not `` complementary '' . 
  i was making fun of op and o-op for saying `` complimentary '' instead of `` complementary '' . 
  `` complimentary '' can be used to mean the same thing ? 
  also , it 's supplementary angles that add up to 180 \u00b0 . 
  complementary angles add up to 90 \u00b0 . 
  professional opinion : photoshop . 
  i can tell by the pixels , obviously . 
  of course . 
  that goes without saying . 
  on the other hand , it recommended me a great book ( series ) . 
  i thank op for it , and i have upvoted accordingly . 
  goddammit , no one ever appreciates * my * constructed languages . 
  except that one person who pmed me about my first conlang ( gallifreyan , with authentic circles and things ) . 
  nope . 
  let me dig up the pdf . 
  if i may say so , my interpretation was so much better . 
  edit : [ holy shit , i wrote way more in the thread than i remember writing . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/sfh0j/i_composed_a_grammar_and_vocabulary_system_for/ ) i mean just look at the comments . 
  also , it 's occurred to me that past me is an idiot . 
   partially unsaturated lipids, 
  are n't those good ? 
  i 'd worry more about saturated fats and their trans-isomers . 
  nope .

  or maybe serenity is special ... ... 
  ( i 'm holding on to the theory that serenity is calliope . ), 
  actually , i think people would start to leave because they did n't want to work in such a delusional store . 
  aww , how can you say that ... [ * this * ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006997 ) is a loveless , unfeeling creature ? 
  have you read anything on http://lesswrong.com ? 
  i find that it is the most complete compilation of ways of thinking with regard to rationality . 
  plus , there 's also a good ( i do n't want to use the word `` intuitive '' , because it 's almost inherently unintuitive ) explanation of quantum mechanics , and a community . 
  the main writer , e. yudkowsky , also wrote the best fanfic that i 've ever read : http://hpmor.com, 
  i never really liked this one . 
  i feel like the lyrics do n't apply enough . 
  you read homestuck and you still give a shit about capitalization ? 
  you bastard , we hungarians are proud of our unique double acute accent , and you turn it into an umlaut ? 
  you oughtta be hanged . 
  ( kidding , thanks for the link ! ), 
  ... i 'm afraid to ask in what part of your body . 
  oh , i missed that somehow . 
  thank you !, 
  the `` reverse circlejerk '' would be just as annoying as the regular one . 
  i do n't think hitler would have mentioned `` spanglish '' . 
  we can assume that it 's a translation , that . 
  it 's a contradiction . 
  fefetasprite * knows * that 3833 is actually more than 383 , but purposely stated otherwise , out of sarcasm . 
  this explains why one killed my shih-tzu a few years ago . 
  ( in hungary , where you ca n't just `` sue them '' . ), 
  thank you for the information . 
  i do n't think that we should cut music out of schools , but what makes this an argument against cutting music out of schools ? 
  there 's no benefit , and also no drawback , as far as i can see . 
  it 's just a phenomenon . 
  okay , but this specifically is not inherently beneficial . 
  you said that it 's because , after creating this study , we understand the benefits from this . 
  i 'm asking what the benefits are . 
  they ca n't be `` understanding what the benefits are '' . 
  all that we have seen here is that , if you attach eegs to musicians , then they 'll all click at the same time when the musicians are playing . 
  how does having synchronized brainwaves directly help people in any way ? 
  you can talk about other studies , but i want to know about * this * one , since that 's what you implied was a counterargument to cutting music from schools . 
  it 's deliberately kitchen-sink . 
  gallifreyan looks complicated , so i made it complicated . 
  mathematically : x = sin t , y = cos t is a circle , and x = sin - t , y = cos - t is still a circle . 
  nak nak nak nak no wait let 's not turn this into a spam-fest .
