  / r/nak for those interested . 
  it 's relatively dead , similar to my own sub / r/karkat . 
  only one session has to create the babies . 
  karkat created them post-scratch , which means that kankri did n't have to . 
  or , to look at it another way , kankri did n't create them , so in order to avoid violating causality , a scratch * had * to occur . 
  this probably got explained to the beforus players at one point or another . 
  that does n't mean that kankri not creating the trolls was the sole reason that they lost their session . 
  they were obviously a bunch of incompetent fuckwits . 
  it was just another symptom of a glitchy session chain . 
  posted somewhere else in this thread . 
  i am jealous . 
  take as much physics as possible ( but it 's also important to seem well-rounded , so take arts and things too ) . 
  take as * high-level * physics as possible . 
  you ca n't know too much physics . 
  especially if you want to major in physics or a physics-related subject . 
  outside of college application and just in terms of educating oneself in physics , get an appealing , broadly-ranging physics textbook , and read it in your spare time . 
  maybe do problems from it , even . 
  your understanding of the various goings-on in the universe will grow all the more . 
  but that happens whether or not the eeg reads that their brainwaves are in sync . 
  we knew that * before * the study . 
  you give many good reasons for advocating musical education in schools , but the eeg readings do n't affect your argument . 
  you could have said exactly this even before the study was performed . 
  musicians have consciously been working in sync for hundreds of years ; the eeg does n't add anything to that . 
  the best use of it that i can think of is * further * evidence of what you talked about , but even using it like that would be borderline fallacious , since being in sync causes brainwaves to be in sync , not the other way around ; that is , since brainwaves being in sync does not affect one 's ability to coherently form a collective ( a benefit of musical education ) , brainwaves being in sync does not change our expectations about the benefits of musical education . 
  if someone * doubted * that the musicians were * in sync * , then we could use it as evidence that they were in sync , since brainwaves synchronize if and only if musicians synchronize . 
  however , that 's different from showing that musicians synchronizing is beneficial to them as people . 
  you need other arguments for that . 
  i completely understand !, 
  if you are going to be a serious advocate , though , i think it would help if your arguments were rational , though . 
  ( and if you 're actually interested in rationality , http://lesswrong.com is a good place to start . ), 
  jake is fine , but the girls ' hairdos look weird . 
  jane 's is too boyish , and roxy 's makes her look like a neanderthal . 
  i do n't think you should be either . 
  i want * everyone * to be aware of rationality . 
  it 's one of the few things that i 'm passionate about . 
  the resolution of the image is low enough and the picture is good enough that it 's completely impossible to tell whether it 's a photograph or a drawing . 
  but ... my comment argued that this was n't direct evidence that musical education was beneficial , only that the musicians were mentally synchronized . 
  has anyone noticed how he * does n't golf * ? 
  '' [ can dream selves be drunk ? 
  '' [ yes . 
  initially , roxy 's dreamself was drunk . 
  and meenah . 
  there 's something about hussie and the best sorts of metaphors . 
  `` best example '' ? 
  it 's the only example so far , and might be the only example forever . 
  hussie is n't going to pull the exact same minor plot arc on us a * second * time . 
  well , 61.2 squared would have to have two decimals after it , so it 's not like that was a surprise to anyone . 
  reusing gags , not plot arcs . 
  hussie is n't stupid . 
  he knows that repetitive plot is bad and boring . 
  it seemed to me exactly like the kind of thing i 'd find on here , so i posted it here . 
  i 'll assume from now on that if it is n't a phase change or a non-newtonian fluid , i 'll post it in / r/physicsgifs instead . 
  i do biomedical engineering , but i 've always felt that i 'm just a degree short of being a marine biologist . 
  so you might be on to something here . 
  maybe if i had an easily-portable microscope with a photograph attachment , my vacation photos would be like this . 
  or a camera that goes underwater . 
  as much as i want to make sure that everyone knows their cognitive biases and try to move towards canceling them out within themselves , i feel like this is bound to generate a whole lot more feeling-sorry-for-oneself than helpful improvement . 
  a better way to frame this would have been to use ui as an example in the context of teaching the halo effect , rather than using the halo effect as a phenomenon in the context of ui . 
  that way , people are more likely to go on and apply awareness of the halo effect to other topics , and become more rational . 
  this is related to the positive bias ( which strangely lacks a wikipedia article ) , where people tend to only test for things that they think will yield a positive ( as in `` favoring the hypothesis '' , not `` favorable '' ) outcome , and do n't test for things that would reject the hypothesis . 
  it 's not quite the same , but you can see the pattern : give people a box to think in , and they 'll probably stay there . 
  he spontaneously offended my religion , so i downvoted him . 
  the universe will collapse !, 
  atoms will implode , for example !, 
  do n't do it !, 
  what ? 
  no , i mean that there are other examples but i 'm not mentioning them because i do n't know what they are . 
  also `` grimdark '' ? 
  turing tar pit , is that a technical term ? 
  i think it has to do with the grey pants . 
  hah , i have something more mundane but three times as horrible :,

  what is this ? 
  it 's the [ cubic solution equation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cubic_equation#general_formula_of_roots ) . 
  mine is a modular , tabletop version . 
  a watermelon does n't fit . 
  i 've wanted to try using a lime or tomato , but i 'm afraid i might break something . 
  what i ended up doing was aspectratio -  2 / ( 1 + \u221a 5 ) . 
  what bothers me about it , though , is that was n't that supposed to be the default ? 
  or is that only for plot [ ] ? 
  i know vector and 3d plots are square . 
   unite synchronization has homestuck in it ? 
  not if you 'd ask me . 
  hmm . 
  it 's the main theme of the entire piece . 
  it 's slightly different ( after the first two notes of the melody , it goes down rather than up ) . 
   these 3 posts should be sidebarred . 
  i want to update them before that happens . 
  i 'll probably post a new series of 5 posts . 
  these 3 are already at their capacity , character-wise .
