  is n't combining pdfs complicated ? 
  that makes things simple , i guess . 
  my beginner 's statistics textbook told me it was non-obvious . 
  i guess it assumed that i did n't know calculus . 
  ( dude , thank you for showing me !, 
  i will cherish this knowledge forever . ), 
  noir 's initials are `` ss '' . 
  umm ... okay ? 
  i mean , i do n't think that many more people are going to read it . 
  his initials are an immutable fact that you can not change about him . 
  ( that was a joke . ), 
  i recommend http://hpmor.com as mandatory reading then . 
  it 's okay if you have n't read the original . 
  your joke was funny , and mine was n't .

  eliezer yudkowsky is a pioneer of rationalism ( his gigantic corpus can be found in large on http://lesswrong.com ) , and one day he thought it would be fun and educational to write an alternate-reality fanfic of harry potter with harry having grown up a rationalist instead of not a rationalist . 
  what follows is like ender 's game meets harry potter meets http://lesswrong.com meets artemis fowl , and it 's one of my favorite things ever written . 
  ( if you 're looking for something less heavy-handed , i 'd recommend things from sam hughes : http://qntm.org . 
  he has nothing to do with anything i have previously mentioned . ), 
  there are lots of pleasures that i can experience that would be morally wrong to do so . 
  visiting north korea is one of them . 
  notes ? 
  you have * notes ?

  hussie is relatively poor . 
  that 's the only kickstarter he 's ever done , and it 's not spending money . 
  he did n't `` make '' the money ; he 'll make money when he uses the money to develop and sell a game . 
  we 'll see how much that makes him . 
  it was a reference to a sexist comment , i 'm sure . 
  it is historically realistic for dd to be making sexist comments . 
  it 's part of his character . 
  you would n't want to read a story set in the prohibition where society was egalitarian . 
  man , i 've seen this in person so many times that the effect of the picture on me was like someone posting a picture of the inside of my house . 
  that said , great pic ( why did i never think of using a camera ? 
  ) , and it 's nice to see a little reminder of something that 's been such a fascination to me since i was growing up . 
  i think he was championing the existence of the flaw rather than the flaw itself . 
  no , i meant that it seems that he likes the fact that hussie gave dd a historically accurate flaw , which improves dd 's character . 
  he does not necessarily think that the joke is funny , or that the joke is okay . 
  the first statement of this paragraph describes my position , but i do n't know for sure what the initial poster 's position on the matter is , except that the words that he uses could express my position ( if not very tactfully ) . 
  i am therefore most inclined to believe that the position expressed by his words is indeed the same position as mine , as it is both charitable and familiar , and certain axioms of belief that i follow make me favor both charitable and familiar judgements over uncharitable and unfamiliar judgements . 
  of course , his position may very well be `` sexist jokes are funny '' . 
  you never know . 
  what ... 
  i like tea a lot , much better than any other drink , but really ... ... 
  guys . 
  he 's coping with schizophrenia . 
  it 's rude to downvote something he has little control over . 
  that 's true . 
  i 'm not sure whether he notices the social connotation of downvoting . 
  but the correct thing to do , i think , is to report , not downvote . 
  a sensible mod who would prefer that things remain on topic would delete it straightaway . 
  by the way , this does n't have to do with much , but since this * is * / r/compsci ( nonono theoretical computer scientists , no eye-rolling ) , sparrowos actually wrote a killer os , named sparrow os , that i suggest you go check out . 
  he may not be a conversationalist , but damn , he 's excellent at programming . 
  it 's funny how these sorts of conjectures can be disproven easily with computers . 
  i 'll bet that i could cook up a checker for p\u00f3lya in python in less than 30 minutes . 
  hardware manufacturers take `` gigabyte '' to mean `` one billion bytes exactly '' . 
  it 's even written on the hard drives themselves . 
  os manufacturers ( that is , commercial os manufacturers , namely microsoft and apple ) , take `` gigabyte '' to mean `` 2 ^ 30 bytes exactly '' . 
  this is a problem , but not a big problem . 
  i do n't know how stuck up this makes me sound , and i sincerely hope that it 's as little as possible , but this is pretty obvious to anyone who 's taken calc 3 . 
  generalizing integration to r ^ n is just about the first thing you learn , and i * hope * that by this time you 've learned the `` rigorous '' definition of a r ^ n sphere , and the distance formula in r ^ ( n ) . 
  sorry if i come off as mean ; i just do n't think that this is that impressive . 
  math is n't like science in that all the axioms of the scientific method apply . 
  you ca n't use bayesian reasoning on a proof . 
  you work your way through it , and it 's either correct or it is n't . 
  in science , if an experiment falsifies your hypothesis , then you 've learned just as much as if it had confirmed it ( unless your hypothesis had a significantly lower probability of being true than not being true ; but you 've still learned something ) . 
  if your hypothesis is falsified , then it 's not like you 've made a mistake , and gone wrong ; you 've succeeded in narrowing down the model of your world . 
  pure mathematics is different . 
  there 's no probability of truth of your assertions ; there are axioms and your assertions either follow from them or they do n't . 
  if you believe that they follow from these axioms and prove it , but your proof turns out to contain errors , you have n't even falsified a hypothesis . 
  you 're just wrong . 
  this is analogous to making an experimental error in science : you botched some part of your methodology , and the results you got did n't reflect reality ( enough ) . 
  it 's scarier in science because there 's no definitive way to tell that you * did * mess up . 
  maybe it really is that way . 
  however , this does * not * make an incorrect proof worthless . 
  if i come up with a brilliant way to test something , but i make an experimental error , then maybe i have n't verified or falsified a hypothesis , but i 've * still come up with a brilliant way to test something . 
  * someone else , or maybe even i , could go back and correct the errors in the methodology of the experiment , and * successfully * perform the experiment , verifying or falsifying the hypothesis . 
  it 's the same with proofs . 
  while the proof is , in all likelihood , incorrect , it 's completely possible that he 's laid innovative groundwork for a * correct * proof . 
  we can still learn from his methodology , although his results were incorrect . 
  he could have invented new mathematical tools for us to work with along the way . 
  and that 's why you should n't simply toss out his proof just because it 's incorrect . 
  yeah , i mean the volume is obvious . 
  the method described in this post is ... not . 
  i can post the calc version if you want . 
  that 's definitely worthwhile . 
  okay . 
  so , first of all , our definition of an n-sphere is all of the points that are exactly a certain distance from a point . 
  coordinate geometry-wise , this may be represented as [ ; r = \\ sqrt { ( x_1 - a_1 ) ^ 2 + ( x_2 - a_2 ) ^ 2 + ( x_3 - a_3 ) ^ 2 + \\ cdots + ( x_n - a_n ) ^ 2 }  , where r is the constant distance . 
  we need to make the center somewhere where the entire volume of the n-sphere is above the ... uh ... hyper-plane on which [ ; x_n = 0  . 
  or , we * could * , but as luck would have it , if the center is on the [ ; x_n = 0  hyperplane , then our volume is just twice whatever is over that hyperplane !, 
  so , in the interest of simplicity , we make the center the origin , getting [ ; r = \\ sqrt { x_1 ^ 2 + x_2 ^ 2 + x_3 ^ 2 + \\ cdots + x_n ^ 2 }  , keeping in mind that the area between the curve and the [ ; x_n = 0  hyperplane is only half the volume . 
  now we solve for [ ; a_n  to get an n-dimensional function , [ ; f ( x_1 , x_2 , x_3 , \\ cdots x _ { n - 1 } ) = \\ sqrt { r ^ 2 - ( x_1 ^ 2 + x_2 ^ 2 + x_3 ^ 2 + \\ cdots + x _ { n - 1 } ^ 2 ) }  . 
  it 's square root and not plus-minus square root so that we only get the part above the curve . 
  finally , we integrate the hyper-surface to find the hyper-volume , written [ ; 2 \\ int \\ !, 
  \\ cdots \\ !, 
  \\ int_v \\ sqrt { r ^ 2 - ( x_1 ^ 2 + x_2 ^ 2 + x_3 ^ 2 + \\ cdots + x _ { n - 1 } ^ 2 ) } dh  , where v is the entire function ( from minus infinity to plus infinity , times n-1 ... ) , and h is [ ; dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 \\ cdots dx_n  . 
  actually integrating it is left as exercise to the reader ( but is easily solved with trigonometric substitution ) . 
  not in * my * / r/homestuck .
