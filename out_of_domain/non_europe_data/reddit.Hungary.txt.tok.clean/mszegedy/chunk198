  we should remember that more often . 
  could you please not get on my case for that , i 'm not having the best day ever, 
  thank you so much, 
  ignore what ? 
  that 's true . 
  you should 've linked to the list on the [ wiki ] ( http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/powergoal ) , though . 
  this looks like it 's attempting to have complex graphics and be an mmo as well , so i 'm not sure how much time could be spent on developing its mechanics before they perfect the engine , which might make it less possible to make mechanical changes in the future . 
  then again i know ~ 0 about game development . 
  oh sorry , i did n't even know . 
  i saw this on / r/homestuck [ ( here ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/14s127/this_is_a_little_too_much_like_sburb/ ) , and it was pretty relevant there ( sburb is a game inside the canon of homestuck and it 's vaguely similar to this ) , and the person who posted it looks in no way like a scammer and raises a valid point . 
  so not a scam , though now i ca n't help wondering about that referral reward and what i could 've gotten for it if i had done it properly . 
  edit : just noticed , they ca n't even spell circumference , and i 'm not sure what that says about them . 
  wait , modeling pictures with equations gets you karma now ? 
  :p okay , here 's my terrible model of what it * should * have looked like : | sinx / ( x ^ ( 1/2 ) ) |, 
  i do n't think it 's actually ever closed . 
  can confirm , i 'm op too . 
  somehow , i ca n't . 
  i 've half-forgotten what it sounds like . 
  careful . 
  maybe you 're only using that interpretation to validate your previous expectations . 
  it-mex ? 
  there 's also [ * introductory calculus for infants * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/introductory-calculus-infants-omi-inouye/dp/0987823914 ) . 
  fragile and endangered ? 
  i do n't think so !, 
  that 's really flawed reasoning . 
  you have to look at how many people are christians and how many are atheists and * then * compare . 
  [ 78.4 % of people are christian , and 1.6 % of people are atheist . 
  ] ( http://religions.pewforum.org/reports ) a statistician would say that religion and crime are uncorrelated . 
  if everyone was an atheist , then 100 % of prisoners would be atheist . 
  [ it 's like this xkcd comic . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/1138/ ), 
  the statistics sound legitimate . 
  [ 78.4 % of americans are christians , and 1.6 % of americans are atheists . 
  ] ( http://religions.pewforum.org/reports ) which means that , assuming religion and crime are uncorrelated , roughly 75 % of prisoners should be christians , and 1 % of prisoners should be atheists . 
  it 's not a stretch . 
  it 's just that you ca n't use it to say that atheism has a much lower crime rate than christianity . 
  p ( a | b ) \u2260 p ( b | a ) . 
  and that 's what bayes ' theorem is for . 
  right conclusion , wrong reasons . 
  the statistics given in the comment show that religion is uncorrelated with crime , since about 75 % of people are christian and 1 % of people are atheist . 
  speaking entirely technically , there is no real difference between sounding and being legitimate . 
  no study or experiment or anything is perfect . 
  there are studies and experiments that you can trust more , and there are studies and experiments that you can trust less . 
  this is definitely the latter kind , though . 
  plugging it into bayes ' theorem ? 
  i 'm drawing a blank here . 
  oh , i 'm not saying that they carry the same legitimacy irrespective of basis !, 
  of course a study you can trust more will have a justly higher impact on your beliefs . 
  i 'm simply saying it 's all relative . 
  my point is pretty irrelevant and i do n't know why i brought it up . 
  i 'd quickly disbelieve the cited study if offered a more legitimate source with information contradicting it . 
  - ln ( number of fucks i give ), 
  hmm , judging by the lengthy review and a few less lengthy reviews , it 's not the sort of book that i like . 
  i like exposition with few examples , as opposed to this . 
  however , the reviews did have the fortune to lead me to two searchable and me-approved books : [ this one ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-probability-tutoring-book-scientists/dp/0780310519/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk ) and [ schaum 's ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071632891/ref=rdr_ext_sb_ti_sims_2 ) . 
  thank you !, 
  since it 's christmastime , there 's little need to be modest , and i 'll get both . 
  thank you for your recommendation !, 
  i eventually decided to go with schaum 's outline and [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-probability-tutoring-book-scientists/dp/0780310519/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk ) . 
  fuck , still too long . 
  well , the foundations of the data points given are very shaky , as noted further down in the thread , so i do n't think i have the privilege to make that conclusion . 
  genius . 
  this is why i 'm not a programmer . 
  because dave wears shades . 
  i dunno , i 've read an above-average amount on statistics and decision theory and i ca n't think of an obvious answer myself . 
  i 'd answer `` none '' , because i 'm not willing to risk my life p = 0.01 for anything except other lives . 
  dad is bald and has a nose . 
  you can have a life and reddit at the same time . 
  i make tens of posts per day , but reddit takes up , cumulatively , less than an hour of my time per day . 
  the key is not to put too much thought into your posts . 
  combine this with browsing / r/all a lot and tada karma . 
  i feel the same way . 
  i was only slightly offended by saying that you have no life . 
  you implied that it was evident from your karma count . 
  but i was only offended enough to make a post !, 
  which is hardly offended at all . 
  to be fair , requiring a constant internet connection is pretty horrible . 
  i play games primarily on my laptop on planes . 
  that does n't give them the right to pirate , though , obviously , and fuck them for bitching about it entitledly . 
  if i do n't think i would enjoy playing a game for whatever reason , i do n't buy it . 
  and if i have a chance to tell the developer , then i 'll give polite feedback on what measures could have been taken to make me buy the game . 
  not whine on and on in an overtly accusatory manner . 
  i know !, 
  it 's just the largest number i can conceive of , despite its nonexistence . 
  i was n't trying to win , just fulfill my own version of the requirements . 
  that 's true . 
  it is in fact a very good idea . 
  that was one that i was considering , but the problem is that the science is especially bad and the doctor is absent for most of it . 
  * shhhhh, 
  doctor , romana , doctor 's mother vs. rassilon & co. , master ? 
  am i missing anyone ? 
  he should tell us his birthday . 
  i would literally mail him a cookie . 
  pfft , you have a * tree ? 
  * who needs trees . 
  not me . 
  no , just underpaid . 
  it 's possible that her initial birthday was recorded incorrectly and she is either older or younger than her official age . 
  but , either way . 
  dat feel when you can read almost half of these .
