  i could make them smaller , but i 'm not trying to make them look like cogs . 
  it 's based on [ first image you get for googling `` lohac '' ] . 
  well , i plan to render the whole medium in a couple of shots , so i do n't think that small-scale structure is going to matter if i still have to include all the planets as well . 
  check out the newest variation !, 
  i think this 'll be the final one , plus a bump map . 
  [ the relevant link . 
  someone else also has `` octoroon rangoon '' as a favorite !, 
  also , your summary of homestuck does n't do it nearly enough justice . 
  and i was under the impression that `` chorale for jaspers '' was rose 's theme ? 
  welp , time to gen a new very large world ... pity , the one i had was going along well . 
  yeah , that guy was the grand high ( blood ) . 
  edit : no , wait , there 's totally no way to make this come out to eight characters . 
  what ? 
  the problem is , gamzee also often uses a hammer . 
  no fuck you, 
  in case you do n't get it the jovke is that it sounds liek fail, 
  you 'll never guess : for me it was veridiyaguru 's hastily begun and quickly discontinued lp . 
  well , it \u00b4 s better than , `` holy shit you \u00b4 re good , it \u00b4 s like you \u00b4 ve had practice being a faggot . 
  can ` t you use the apostrophe for single quotes ? 
  whenever i see one of these threads , i think , `` i 'm sure there 's a cop reading this right now who probably feels rather offended ... '' but it 's not really reddit 's obsession with unfriendly american police departments . 
  a significant number of these people actually * do * turn out to be assholes . 
  what the fuck ? 
  holy shit , `` fandom history lesson '' . 
  we need more of this . 
  i already plan to teach a college course `` internet literature '' with homestuck as required reading , but this sounds epic as well . 
  to quote someone else from another thread , `` it does n't look like any known species of dream bubble . '', 
  [ humanity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler ) [ is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalin ) [ also ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mao_zedong ) [ relatively ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genghis_khan ) [ peaceful ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hammurabi ) . 
  they 're saying that , judging by the background and stuff , it 's not actually a dream bubble . 
  obviously , it means that in this case * you 're * the idiot . 
  / customerview, 
  fun fact : apple 's siri is able to convert the word `` mysequel '' to proper text just fine . 
  i plan to do this just now . 
  thanks for giving me a point number to aim for !, 
  i have two copies of original settlers ( one ~ ~ german ~ ~ hungarian and one american ) , one american copy of seafarers , and one ~ ~ german ~ ~ hungarian copy of cities and knights . 
  now if i could figure out what the gold tiles are for , i could play a decent game with this . 
  let me guess , you were blue , and op was orange ? 
  the trolls never performed a scratch , though . 
  see the succession of universes :, 
  o some sorta 48-player session, 
  peaceful alternia universe o = =  o our trolls ' universe, 
  scratch, 
  our kids ' universe o = =  o the new act 6 universe, 
  scratch, 
  that 's one sixht a cube . 
  what are you , a dadaist ? 
  this is ... incredibly well-thought out . 
  stfu, 
  how have i never thoguht of this, 
  \\* the obvious solution is to create as many novelty accounts as possible *, 
  edit : i is idiot . 
  how did i not get the `` chairman meow '' reference to mao ? 
  yeah , that 's why i was like , `` noooo i need ta regen nao '' in the last thread . 
  :( if you generate a very large world with over a thousand years in history , these things are gon na make you sad ... 
  silver hammers are also to be feared . 
  [ insert obligatory beatles reference ], 
  well , the processor was relatively good ( amd athlon ii , dual-core 3.4 ghz \\* overclocked * ) , and i left it running for a while . 
  but yeah , it kinda sucked to have to regen it , but it 's not like i was planning on playing df that day anyway ( it and reddit are the two biggest time-wasters i have ; for some reason i seem to be immune to tv tropes ) . 
  [ all ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elder_futhark ) [ runes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-saxon_runes ) [ look ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/younger_futhark ) [ essentially ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medieval_runes ) [ the ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalecarlian_runes ) [ same .

  wrong answer . 
  :d you 're supposed to say that dwarven orthography has less depth than english , and that runic '' | '' actually stands for phoneme / a\u026a / , and that `` m '' stands for / i / at the end of words and / \u0259 / at the beginning . 
  \\* on a related note i have actually composed an orthography for dwarves , pity i did n't bring it home with me today . 
  it 's an abjad with optional vowel marks for beginner engravers *, 
  but that does n't happen . 
  it only creates one new session , horizontally on my chart . 
  exactly . 
  i swear , it slows down like a harmonic series . 
  me too , but that might have partially been because i read your comment in my peripheral vision . 
  heheh , i 'll do a shitty ms paint mockup tomorrow once i have the paper that i wrote it down on . 
  in the meantime , enjoy this ascii / k / :, 
  edit : oh shit forgot to bring papers home again . 
  will try again tomorrow, 
  holy shit , i never thought i 'd find someone on the internet with the same set of interests as me . 
  do you like minecraft and dwarf fortress , by any chance ? 
  ( i 'm not exactly a brony , though : i was only into it before it was cool . 
  i have n't watched any ofthe new series . ), 
  is there a reference i 'm not getting here ? 
  would n't a scythe have a long handle ? 
  prospit and derse would have fractal geometry , and heroes would outnumber citizens five hundred to one . 
  you should feel smarter , because you just got edify ` n. 
  the fuck ? 
  why 's your post empty ? 
  heh , i 'm using alien blue . 
  i guess that 's why . 
  i figured i was n't the first one to come up with it , but i put it up anyway . 
  interestingly enough , i thought of thief of time first , and my train of thought \\* somehow * rolled up to reddit . 
  i 'm trying to create a 3d set of the medium . 
  i have nearly finished lohac , and am trying to do the rest of the kids ' planets . 
  what i mean is , you see the view of lolar from space from the wiki ? 
  you see those patterns on the surface ? 
  what mineral is that supposed to look like ? 
  i may go with marble at this point . 
  ` sit free ? 
  i see what you did there . 
  and a few other things . 
  i genuinely want to be able to generate a random 2d map of a land of x and y. 
  but i want to use my customized diamond-square generator for the renders as well . 
  yeah . 
  it 's always fun to use some standard implementation , and say , `` hey , i can make this better and more useful to me ! '', 
  hmm .
