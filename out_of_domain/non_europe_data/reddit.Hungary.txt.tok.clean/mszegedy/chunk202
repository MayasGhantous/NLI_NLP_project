  except : fuck prescriptivism . 
  hahahaha , i totally predicted this back when ar was first introduced !, 
  too bad that i do n't have any posts about it to prove it . 
  but it would only follow that if dirk has a tendency to create precise digital copies of him , so would his precise digital copies have that exact same tendency ... 
  it 's photoshop . 
  it reminds me of that scene from the cat in the hat movie . 
  towards the end , in the realm of imagination . 
  the house on the left is different , and the cobble should have shown in the original . 
  maybe the original is photoshop and they tried to replicate it later irl ? 
  or the other way around ? 
  either way , something is fishy here , and * something * is photoshop . 
  / r/techsupportgore, 
  mmmm solder, 
  that sounds a bit rude , though , does n't it ? 
  `` hey , people on this server , why do n't you leave and come to a different server ? 
  * my * server . 
  no seriously , this place is shit compared to what i have . '', 
  whee , making that list was even more worth it , i guess !, 
  i really should reorganize it , though . 
  oh ... \\* jumps out window *, 
  huh ? 
  have you tried clearing the cmos settings on your mobo ? 
  ( not completely sure whether this is supposed to help ), 
  how do i `` download a copy of windows 7 '' ? 
  do i have to torrent it ? 
  what about feynman 's lectures , do n't they deserve a mention ? 
  you mean the french ? 
  why ? 
  wait , what the fuck ? 
  he was going to * kill * a sentient being , and you lost respect for him when he * did n't ? 
  yes , and you 're going to kill * that ? 
  * just because he might be villainous ? 
  38 minutes have passed since he made his comment , and he 's at -37 . 
  but i do n't understand why he 's getting downvoted . 
  how many times have we seen that exact comment before ? 
  `` some people just want to watch the world burn '' ? 
  someone open a window ; i need a breath of fresh air . 
  okay , but it 's still in the air why people disapprove of it at * all * . 
  it 's not about the downvotes ; it 's about the people giving them . 
  i used to go there , but i decided to stop spending time there . 
  reddit is n't important enough to me to complain about . 
  plus , it sort of breeds condescension , and i did n't want to be a part of that . 
  one thing , may i ask why you decided to make your question mark like that ? 
  that sounds like a pretty niche subculture . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ swear ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ god ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ anyone ^ ^ ^ ^ links ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ relevant ^ ^ ^ ^ xkcd ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ flip . 
  reaches masses that are n't / r/classicalmusic posters , and sought after by people who are n't / r/classicalmusic posters . 
  there , fixed . 
  that 's not the point . 
  it does n't have to do with this being / r/classicalmusic . 
  it has to do with doing-your-mom jokes not being funny , and being non-content in general . 
  non-content is terrible and should stop existing everywhere , not just because this is a `` high-standards '' subreddit or whatever . 
  i 'd hate to see this post in / r/funny , too . 
  ( unfortunately , it 's way harder to control for this sort of thing in such a large subreddit as that , so that 's probably just going to not stop happening , ever , in that particular subreddit , unless the subscriber count is reduced some thousandfold , maybe . ), 
  well , it does seem sort of obvious in retrospect , does n't it ? 
  i swear , either people read my comment history , or ... well , anyway , first i post something about french punctuation , and then shortly thereafter , in a completely different thread , someone replies to me , using french punctuation . 
  then i complain about people overusing the phrase `` i just wan na watch the world burn '' , and lo !, 
  so , either it really is that overused , or my paranoia is justified . 
  shit , we got the same present !, 
  seeing as he corrected it , apparently it was n't a joke . 
  so , what 's french punctuation ? 
  i swear to fucking god , everything in this subreddit gets spamfiltered these days . 
  lots of times , people do n't vote what 's best for them . 
  like also they do n't spend their time in ways that are the best for them , and i do n't even mean in terms of productivity . 
  it 's hard to notice how bored you are browsing / r/all , except when you are conscious of the fact that you could be having the time of your life doing something more interesting . 
  this applies to voting as well . 
  cheap laughs attract more votes than elaborate and/or thought-provoking content , because people * notice * how amused they are by them , and * do n't * notice that they are more of a waste of time . 
  right . 
  in my opinion ( which , like any other opinion , i will readily discard if given good enough evidence to the contrary ) , democracy just like that is n't a good way to run things . 
  maybe a long-term representative oligarchy might be better , or something . 
  but i do n't really have the answers to that sort of thing . 
  not at all mathematically impossible . 
  i 've already defined and tweaked the different parameters ; if i ever have enough time , i 'll make a few polynomials as functions of those parameters , and animate them linearly , so that it results in a comprehensive animation . 
  but that 'd take time and it 'd be pretty boring for me . 
  made me look . 
  what can we use tensors for to model things ? 
  if i want to make a coordinate transformation , what does my transformation ( am i using the terminology correctly ? ), 
  tensor look like ? 
  in general , how do tensors behave ? 
  it 's not that hard to conclude that multiplication by a scalar results in the multiplication of every value in the tensor , for example . 
  a different approach than usual is found for free [ here ] ( http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/ ) . 
  in this , the author treats quantum mechanics like it should be treated : it is how your own universe functions , and it is reality and has been reality for trillions of years , and anyone who calls it `` weird '' should be shot , because it 's their own universe that they 're talking about . 
  it 's an entertaining perspective , and i like the tutorial a lot , but a few things are omitted at the beginning that make it more confusing than it has to be ( which are essentially summarized in the revelation that `` the modulus squared of the amplitude of a configuration is proportional to the probability of that configuration being what actually is ( which is why an event with amplitude 0 will never ever happen ) '' ) , and , like nearly any other textbook , the author goes off on philosophical tangents about scientific thought sometimes ( relevant here because when people first did experiments on quantum mechanics , they thought that the fundamental act of observing the particles changed how they behaved , which was n't really what was happening ) , which , unless you enjoy listening to eliezer pontificating on rationalism and science et cetera ( which i do , but i ca n't imagine many people would ) , you would probably want to skip in favor of the parts that actually teach qm . 
  there is actually a subset of the posts specifically selected and organized so that they only include the actual qm instead of everything else eliezer has to say ( first link on page ) , which you might want to read instead . 
  hah , but where would i ever get one of those ... 
  edit : [ whoa , it 's easier to make one than i thought . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=400xfgmslqq ) but i 'd need a camera focused on it and connected to a projector to demonstrate it . 
  which , of course , i can totally do . 
  you mean united nuclear ? 
  i 'm guessing that such a device would be on [ this ] ( http://www.unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cpath=25_30 ) page , but i could n't find it . 
  hah , i completely do n't intend to store them . 
  after they 're produced and detected , they can go screw themselves , for all i care , unless i can do something cool or useful with them . 
  ( they 're positrons , after all . 
  that is definitely a cool and useful thing to be . ), 
  trapping them goes beyond my expertise ( i.e. 
  i have n't read volume 2 of feynman yet , or taken an electrodynamics course ) , and it 's not necessary for me to trap them . 
  just make some and show them off . 
  `` look at me , i can make fucking * antimatter * . '', 
  thank you for your advice , though . 
  edit : sorry , i did n't realize i said `` store '' right in the title . 
  whoops .
