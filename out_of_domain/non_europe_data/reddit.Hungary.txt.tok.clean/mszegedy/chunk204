  thief of light ? 
  fuck , i am so getting left behind by all these people who have 3d printers . 
  the applications in personal robotics alone would be huge . 
  not to mention pretty much everything else that you could do with a 3d printer . 
  ( i had a huge list here but i decided to remove it rather than finish it . ), 
  huh ? 
  well duh . 
  i thought he was referring me to the website . 
  well , any beam of light intense enough to pass through the atmosphere can technically hit the moon . 
  the part that matters is making it visible . 
  and a blue laser will definitely not do that . 
  in fact , not even a green laser , although satellites taking pictures of the area will be able to see the green laser and maybe even the blue laser . 
  you 'd need a much brighter laser to be able to be seen from the moon . 
  lol if only i could modify a laser to make a limited number of photons with the same power . 
  i have a 500 mw green laser from the same company , and those watts ai n't going nowhere but into heat . 
  no i know that . 
  i mean that i thought that harry was literally thinking of that and just applied it in a metaphorical sense . 
  but it turns out that it was asimov who was making the metaphor . 
  i am dumb , apparently i know less about hannukah than i thought . 
  ( specifically i thought it lasted a week . ), 
  no , but i should . 
  i 'll wait until i actually have a 3d printer . 
  i never really watched tv at all . 
  i mostly read books . 
  but it 's even more useful in pretty much every area . 
  to summarize an extremely long list : you can nearly infinitely replicate any object whose function relies solely on its form ( as opposed to its material ) . 
  that 's a really , really huge power you 've got there . 
  it 's not that i 'm specifically working on immortality , though . 
  in the sense that i 'm using it , every biomedical engineer is working on immortality , and everyone in pharmacology as well : contributing bit by bit on different fronts to end death . 
  although there are dedicated bio eng efforts to create immortality as well . 
  i ca n't remember the name of the institute that i 'm thinking of , though . 
  seriously though , that 's an odd usage of that emote that you have there . 
  i do n't want to ruin it for you , but i hate it when hs fans do this . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ \\ ( i ^ ^ ^ ^ mean , ^ ^ ^ ^ come ^ ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ 10 ^ ^ ^ ^ years ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ look ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ comment . ), 
  i only counted an 8 post jump followed by a 32 post jump . 
  does tumblr work quickly , or are there alternative explanations ? 
  ( post deletions ? ), 
  bro , do you even normal discourse, 
  was n't it tumblr -  / r/homestuck -  / r/trees -  / r/homestuck -  / r/funny ? 
  they shot a video of a ferris wheel , took a still , and animated the mirror but not the wheel . 
  seriously , it 's not that complicated . 
  yes !, 
  yes it is !, 
  thank you for reminding me . 
  how did you hear about them ? 
  i know that fact from conway 's game of life . 
  that 's how i knew that it was that place once you told me ; i guess you just have a better memory , since i heard about it only a month or two ago . 
  yes but nepeta belongs in a webcomic . 
  caliborn 's learned to art !, 
  that is so great of him . 
  he did n't necessarily trace it . 
  he could have just copied it . 
  man all i thought it was used for was to make a funny face, 
  could you diagram that sentence ? 
  i do n't understand how it makes sense grammatically . 
  well i mean, 
  that . 
  well , it 's not like le had to seduce scratch before he could be his host . 
  okay , but the simplest explanation is usually the best . 
  maybe skaia generated scratch specifically to serve le ? 
  asking reddit for advice is usually a bad thing to do , unless it 's a small sub with a very specific kind of audience . 
  / r/pics has the most general kind of audience on reddit , and consists mostly of young male atheist stem undergrads ( in general ) , and are not the ideal place to get advice from on your life decisions . 
  i mean , you could still take it , just i think the confidence you should realistically assign to it would be too low to actually impact your judgement . 
  if any hungarian wants to talk about how this should be ours , i 'm here . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( personally ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ think ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ eu ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ solution ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ problems , ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ opposed ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ fighting ^ ^ ^ over ^ ^ ^ it . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ progressive , ^ ^ ^ are n't ^ ^ ^ i ? ), 
  edit : wait , do n't think i 'm one of those jobbik nationalists/racists . 
  i 'd just prefer that comments like that were relegated to one place . 
  i 'm actually not in favor of redefining our borders to include transylvania ; that 's just asking for bad relations . 
  what 's past is past ( what 's trianon is 1920 ) . 
  to improve the global standard of living . 
  ( at least , i hope . ), 
  you do n't even need one . 
  just use / r/reactiongifs and / r/gifs . 
  augh i mean the first paragraph i am so sorry to put you through this, 
  i am so lost, 
  you forgot the red line from cb2 to cb . 
  it 's what my parents use to tell me apart from the household pets . 
  eh , it 's pretty outdated and incomplete . 
  i keep telling myself that i should update it , but there 's always something more important that i could be doing . 
  the thing that keeps me from simply editing them is that every text submission may contain no more than 10,000 characters , and so i 'd have to find a new way to organize these if i wanted to add anything . 
  is n't / r/technology a default ? 
  and what 's wrong with posting from relatively niche subreddits , anyway ? 
  dvorak , bitch . 
  why , what 's wrong with it ? 
  i think the interface is slightly badly designed ( with me needing an extra right click to go between the start menu and all apps ) , but that 's super unimportant . 
  i do n't really look for much in an os : i want it to be able to run chrome , i want to be able to run mathematica , matlab , or maple , i want to be able to use latex to typeset things , i want to be able to program things in c , c++ , python , and lisp , i want to be able to play dwarf fortress and civilization , and i want to be able draw things , either with a mouse or tablet . 
  also , unix is n't really asking too much , either , but i 'm willing to go without it because it 's not a major facet of my life . 
  these criteria fit pretty much every operating system currently on the market . 
  therefore i can never really understand what people are arguing over when they are comparing operating systems . 
  windows runs the most games . 
  mac is the simplest to use . 
  linux is the most powerful ( and you can pick a distribution that you like best ) . 
  what makes windows 8 so terrible that you hate it so much ? 
  i 'm just really curious because i ca n't imagine an operating system that i would hate so much that could actually feasibly be marketed to the majority of computer users . 
  one symptom is typing in caps . 
  no it 's not the caps itself , it 's the whole attitude . 
  `` has a fantroll '' or `` types in caps for emphasis '' or `` uses weird formatting for emphasis '' or `` is too excited '' do n't individually describe the problem ; all of them are okay by themselves , except maybe `` is too excited '' . 
  it 's all of these together that combine to form the integral `` screaming/obsessed fan '' that i do n't like . 
  i 'm not looking to pick a 90-year-old fight .
