  that 'd be pretty pointless . 
  i 'm not making the assessment of his character , i 'm making the assessment of the comment and saying that he * sounds * like a `` screaming/obsessed fan '' . 
  i 've been on this subreddit for a while , and so has supahweegeeman , and i 've seen a lot of his comments , and this is highly atypical for him . 
  and i 'm not in the habit of making judgements about people like that based on short interactions anyway . 
  it 's just that the comment itself looks terrible and reflects an undesirable state of mind if it is unironic . 
  ^ ( and i use my formatting with * dignity . 
  * but you 're right , i should n't have listed that . 
  repeated letters can go to hell , though . ), 
  reddit could still * be * here in 20 years . 
  but probably no one is going to browse it . 
  wait , no one uses icq anymore ? 
  edit : i 'm not trying to be a hipster . 
  i never used icq ; the reason that i ask is precisely the fact that i only ever heard of icq on one day of my life , and that day does n't seem too long ago ( like what , 5 years ? 
  ) , so i 'm surprised that this internet thing that i heard about stopped being a thing so quickly . 
  and you go ... okay there 's no good retort for that . 
  seriously though i could n't care less so who owns it as long as transylvania exists to visit . 
  it 's just that i knew that it was likely that this argument would come up , and i wanted to take control of it before it happened . 
  wait , why ? 
  well , you should n't use proportions . 
  366 days is n't actually that much . 
  i misread your comment and thought that you * were * seeking reddit 's advice . 
  my mistake . 
  though , why are you complaining about obnoxious titles , and then posting a submission with an obnoxious title ? 
  the point of noticing flaws is to fix them . 
  adding an obnoxious title to a submission is in no way going to fix the problem . 
  the idea is to have read a lot of books , and then talk about books you have already read . 
  just took a quick look at wikipedia , and i 'm not exactly sure how focalin actually helps your mind work better . 
  like , adderall is made of amphetamines , which work directly on `` higher-order '' cognitive function . 
  focalin works on catecholamine receptors to make them take in more , which are the receptors that take in things like dopamine , adrenaline , and noradrenaline , which i have , up to now , associated with pretty much every other kind of cognition than intelligence . 
  of course , i 'm only speculating based on incomplete information about the endocrine system , and a 2-minute search . 
  how would you say you feel after you take focalin ? 
  have you ever taken it with any other drugs ? 
  ( that sounds fun . ), 
  have you taken any other adhd medication , and if so , how did they compare ? 
  the joke was ruined for me because i 'm using alien blue , which does n't show exponentiation , so i thought you were phonetically spelling out `` x '' and i was like `` but sxdx = x ^ ( 2 ) / 2 + c '' . 
  but d ( e ^ ( x ) ) / dy is still e ^ x dy/dx . 
  you 'd need a partial derivative operator to get rid of it completely . 
  a neutron walks into a bar . 
  a hydrogen anion leaves the bar . 
  you know , there are sir cumference children 's books about basic mathematical concepts , told from the perspective of said knight . 
  unfortunately , as a child it taught me to spell `` parallel '' wrong . 
  the book on parallelism talked about a kindom named `` lell '' . 
  the same joke showed up further up , but they spelled it properly , and i thought it was n't very funny , because i was pronouncing it `` moo '' in my head , and started imagining an alternative joke involving a cow on a roof . 
  too soon . 
  highest magnetic moment , right ? 
  personally , i think that 's a bit too roundabout a way of saying it . 
  you could just * say * that she 's made of holmium . 
  the stuff about the nucleus made me think of radioactive decay instead , so i offer my improved version , in which the 67 becomes an 82 . 
  now she 's fat , and as fat as possible . 
  \u2202 ( e ^ ( x ) ) / \u2202 y, 
  alt-d on mac . 
  probably not so simple on windows . 
  it looks like ... it was made by 4chan ? 
  edit : also : http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/sp/image/1343/42/1343427984644.png, 
  that 's not funny . 
  it 's not the swearwords themselves , or the fact that it uses simple vocabulary . 
  there 's value in being able to express complex ideas with simple words . 
  it 's the fact that the tone is meant to be funny , in the face of the reality that that tone , which consists in large part of swearwords , allcaps , and faux-arrogance , is in no way funny . 
  that 's what 's terrible about that submission . 
  see , i could n't wait so i made the post myself . 
  and this is what i get . 
  what if it 's hard ? 
  what 's inherently wrong with ca 's comment ? 
  it 's not like he displayed arrogance , and said something like , `` i doodled celtic knots as a kid , therefore i understand knot theory '' . 
  i would n't blame anyone for being angry about that ( although even then , he is still a human being making a human mistake , and i ca n't actually come up with a good reason for downvoting anything unless it contains no content , or is outright offensive , i.e. 
  racist or sexist or homophobic or something else ) . 
  but all he did was make a remark that the field seemed interesting to him , despite his lack of background . 
  surely that 's not deserving of anyone 's anger ? 
  i mean , i 'd sort of understand it if you downvoted his post because it 's not a useful , knowledgeable contribution to the subreddit , because that 's a consistent and logical basis for casting votes . 
  but just because he is n't mathematically educated , really ? 
  that 's terrible . 
  i hate using google docs like that . 
  things that link to webpages should be webpages , not documents . 
  and i create my documents * and * webpages wysiwym , no exceptions . 
  so i 'd be latex typesetting it and uploading a pdf , and gah links to webpages simply do * not * belong in documents , regardless of whether they are docs or pdfs . 
  i guess you can probably forget about picking up women , then ? 
  he is a person , on the fucking moon, 
  dammit , i thought they were gay bayesians . 
  :( that would have been so much better . 
  ( although those properties generally do n't influence each other 's results , so that would have been a weird combination . 
  maybe they could hold competitions to see who could predict which areas will revise their marriage laws next . ), 
  thank you !, 
  wait , i have to do this every time the os updates , do n't i ? 
  and , how do i get it back ? 
  and every computer scientist has heard of an `` ancilla bit '' , right ? 
  ( `` ancilla '' is `` slavewoman '' . ), 
  not that far actually , i generally just read the top-level comment and then minimize the comment thread , unless there 's follow-up content . 
  is the curve all due to friction ? 
  is it bad that i found the reference timeline at the bottom more helpful than the rest ? 
  also , it left out vivaldi . 
  oh , and debussy . 
  you would * need * it to compete on the job market , though . 
  i thought that you just * left * those holes there . 
  that would be a difficult game . 
  ggg gggg, 
  forget arguing over transylvania . 
  this was a theory a while ago , and i never stopped believing in it . 
  this seems like the final piece in `` how did le get to be caliborn '' puzzle . 
  well , aside from `` how did le get his powers '' . 
  and we can infer something like , `` he got them from doc scratch '' , `` but where did scratch get his powers '' , `` he got them from the cueball '' , `` where did the cueball come from '' , maybe it 's the two jujus ?
