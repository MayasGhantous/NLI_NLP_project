  not if i do n't try to make it not be that way first . 
  hahaha lol, 
  how is it not full of textbooks ? 
  that sounds really , really fun . 
  well , it was removed . 
  i we have/d action replay in the us , too . 
  at least in theory . 
  whenever i asked my local game retailer , they 'd say that they are out . 
  i never knew about gameshark , sadly . 
  i 'm in / r/funny , right ? 
  this is too unfunny even for this subreddit . 
  dude on bottom probably ran out of food or inventory space . 
  if you read five words into the article you posted ... 
  do gifs have any compression on them whatsoever ? 
  it 's unfair how long this pointless gif took to load . 
  i 'm not denial . 
  i 'm scientific progress . 
  i actually get things done . 
  i devote a relatively minimal amount of time to reddit . 
  til . 
  i mean , my first language is hungarian , but still . 
  i thought of doc scratch from homestuck . 
  * shared by me *, 
  not just humanity , individual humans . 
  but yes . 
  i mean ... what can you really say about this ? 
  it 's woman doc scratch , and he 's cradling ! her in his arms . 
  this comment seems too cynical . 
  a plurality of tumblr fans are homestuck fans . 
  statistically , a plurality of tumblr sjws should then also be homestuck fans . 
   long and complicated, 
  atoms bond together . 
  each atom has up to four bonds that it can make . 
  sometimes , two atoms use up two bonds at a time to bond together . 
  that 's a `` double bond '' . 
  imagine two large groups of atoms bonded together with a double bond . 
  the double bond is like an american or european electric socket ( without a grounding pin ) . 
  you can plug it in one way , or the other way that is upside-down compared to that way ( or flipped around 180 \u00b0 ) . 
  double bonds work that way , too . 
  there are two ways to attach groups of atoms on either side of a double bond . 
  we call one way the `` cis '' way , and the other way the `` trans '' way . 
  come on , it 's not * that * much of a long and complicated story . 
  if i had a model with me , i could explain it with one and a half sentences plus a physical demonstration . 
  i think / u/statue _ junction might be joining us soon . 
  he needs to try performing mass spectrometry and other tests on purportedly `` magical '' matter , like phoenix feathers and unicorn hair . 
  there has to be a wizard 's equivalent of united nuclear where he can get small amounts of those things for minor sums . 
  it should n't take him long to formulate some sort of theory of the association of magic with baryonic matter . 
  long chains are bad , and harry knows that . 
  i think the theories that he 'd be formulating would be more immediate than that . 
  ( though the whole backwards-induction thing with snape was pretty well-reasoned . ), 
  yeah , but he 's been a member of the mspa fandom for longer than homestuck has existed . 
  seniority deserves some respect , when concerning fandom-related issues . 
  what the flying fuck are you * doing * here . 
  get back to / r/homestuck !, 
  \\* hugs strongly \\*, 
  fundamentally , rationalism does n't have anything to say about ethics . 
  it can be applied towards any utility function , including selfish ones . 
  i saw that one too . 
  the kids around ! her are the beta kids ?? 
  best i can do is `` cascade.swf '', 
  but the ending - on is exactly the same thing as the ending - um , the neuter singular nominative/accusative , but one is greek and the other is latin . 
  this is a widely known association between the two . 
  it looks exactly like as though it costs just one zillium to make a zillyhoo . 
  but ... if you have a word of greek origin in latin that ends with - um , the equivalent greek word is the same thing but with - on ... this is reflected in different languages different ways ; hungarian for example likes to use '' - on '' , where english would use '' - um '' ... zillion = zillium ... \\* gets dragged away \\*, 
  \\* gasp \\* dayglo contains * chemicals * ? 
  never using it again !, 
  ^ ( i liked that video a lot ), 
  well , just the way that the em force works implies that if you can relatively easily snap something in two with your fingers , it 'll burn up in a mass spectrometer as well . 
  this has n't been demonstrated yet , but if you could n't snap phoenix feathers or unicorn hair or dragon heartstring in two with your fingers , they might be used as materials for other , more ubiquitous things as well . 
  although that 's really weak evidence , because maybe they 're just * that * rare . 
  but , if they really are hard to break/burn , if harry ( or someone else ) could find a way to synthesize wand core-type materials , they could be used to build space elevators , or really anything where you need tight , impenetrable rigging . 
  since my degree is/will be in biomedical engineering , though , i do n't know what that would be . 
  but harry did n't seem to update his beliefs after he learned that bit of information . 
  that should have completely rearranged his hypothesis space . 
  it means that * wingardium leviosa * is an incantation invented by people , and not a fundamental facet of the universe . 
  and spells only work right when you say them right because it 's a command that was implemented by * people * , who expected that you would access it in the correct way , and all the ways that are only mostly similar to it do n't work because they are different parts of the namespace , which can still be allocated like we saw with * stuporfy * . 
  there has to be something that processes the commands and creates output , and it 's almost 100 % definitely not a fundamental facet of the universe either , since hand movements and noises from your throat are n't fundamentally physically different from the motions of any other movement of particles anywhere else . 
  they 're different by the fact that they 're being done by a human , but physics does n't care what a human is . 
  there has to be some sort of atlantis machine . 
  but , purely probabilistically , what 's the chance that a spell stuns you * and * moves forward until it detects itself getting further away from the subject * and * then swerves * and * looks red * and * sounds very similar to * stupefy * ? 
  granted , similar pieces of namespace correspond to similar spells ( see * oogely-boogely * ; different feet produced almost identical results , although the `` optimal '' result was the one that was listed in the spellbook ) , but even given that , it 's unlikely that the spell he wanted would have exactly optimal properties . 
  that 's true . 
  but this could be an exception ; after all , grist amounts are n't written out using words anyway , and `` zillion '' is n't even a number . 
  it ca n't mean `` infinity '' , because john used a finite amount of grist to make the vrillyhoo pop-a-matic , and it 's been shown that , in general , it takes ( a lot ) more grist to make a combination of two things than either one or the other . 
  though if `` one zillion '' can be an exception to display rules , then so can it be an exception to the correlation of usefulness with grist cost . 
  that would make it a headcannon . 
  would it be considered blasphemous to remap `` hjkl '' to '' , aoe '' ? 
  ( the dvorak equivalent of wasd . ), 
  there 's no actual good defense for not being vegetarians . 
  it 's just tasty . 
  however , creating new farmland does generally destroy the homes of countless small animals , so at least we sort of have an upper hand there , since farmland can feed more people per square meter if you fill it with cows or chickens than if you fill it with corn or something . 
  i see !, 
  the logic behind telling someone that they ca n't be vegan if they 've had an abortion ( i.e. , that veganism and having abortions are mutually exclusive in a consistent moral system ) is that abortion is killing babies ( which are sentient , if not necessarily yet sapient beings ) , and the moral grounds for being a vegan is that you do n't kill sentient beings ( regardless of whether they are sapient ) . 
  ergo , if you 've had an abortion and want to be a vegan , you are being morally inconsistent , because you have killed a sentient being , and moral veganism assumes that you hold that kind of thing to be wrong . 
  now , * this * poster is concerned with `` manarchy '' . 
  now , i do n't know what that is , but one axiom of manarchy is clear : if you oppress women , you are a manarchist . 
  and telling women that they can not have abortions is oppressing them . 
  therefore , if you tell women that they ca n't have abortions ( for whatever reason , here cited as `` because they are vegan '' ) , that makes you a manarchist . 
  wow , i do n't even use tumblr , but i think i 'm getting pretty good at this social justice stuff . 
  of course , i find that both of these deductions are wrong , for reasons that i wo n't outline here , because it 's 2:12 am and i should sleep and this is pointless .
