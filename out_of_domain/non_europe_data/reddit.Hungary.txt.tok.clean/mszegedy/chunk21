  games can still be objectively crappy despite one 's preferences . 
  however , i have n't read the list , so i do n't know whether the previous commenter 's opinion was based more in objectivism or elitism . 
  engineer a cave-in below the adversaries . 
  sacrificing a dwarf for this is totally worth it , but if you have materials , i think simply using a series of floodgates as temporary and remotely-removable support should work .

  sorry , i do n't get it ... :( i 've been living in new england for a while , and we pronounce it [ \u02ccg\u0259\u02bd\u0279\u0251\u02d0\u0292 ] . 
  is there an alternate pronunciation i should be aware of ? 
  til .

  no , the head of the drama department . 
  she 's also married to a seventh grade algebra teacher . 
  they 're both quite old people , but you would n't see it on her . 
  once , she gave me a ziplock bag with over a thousand pencils in it as a present . 
  i had opened up a business to sell students strapped for pencils writing utensils . 
  the algebra teacher told her , who then dug up all of the pencils and pens she had amassed from students losing their utensils in the drama hall over a thirty year period , sealed them in a ziplock bag , and handed them to her husband to give to me . 
  it went well . 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
  [ and ] denote the actual phonetic pronunciation , as opposed to how it 's supposed to be pronounced in theory ( denoted by / / ), 
  \u02cc means that the syllable after it receives secondary stress, 
  g is pronounced like g in `` gift '', 
  \u0259 is pronounced like the first letter of `` obnoxious '', 
  \u02bd means that the syllable after it receives primary stress, 
  \u0279 is pronounced like r in every american english word, 
  \u0251 is pronounced like `` ah '', 
  \u02d0 means that the vowel before it is long, 
  \u0292 is pronounced like the way news reporters ( incorrectly ) pronounce the j in `` beijing '', 
  [ ( i identify as hungarian , though . 
  ) ] ( http://images.nationmaster.com/images/motw/historical/shepherd/austria_hungary_races.jpg ),

  i 've been diagnosed with it by a psychiatrist . 
  ( which is why i plan to leave permanently as soon as possible . ), 
  reddit is of a latin stem . 
  following the rules to get `` reddit '' , name of your list should be , quite simply , `` empt '' . 
  in english , if there are two nouns in the same clause that are not part of prepositional phrases or conjunctional arguments , the first one is considered the indirect object , while the second is considered the direct object . 
  `` kid sister '' is a compound noun . 
  so , in `` i bought my kid sister minecraft '' , `` i '' is the subject , `` minecraft '' is the direct object , and `` kid sister '' is the indirect object , being modified by the adjective `` my '' . 
  it may be rephrased as `` i bought minecraft for my sister '' , `` i bought for my sister minecraft '' , `` for my sister , i bought minecraft '' , `` minecraft , i bought for my sister '' , `` minecraft , i bought my sister '' , or `` minecraft , for my sister i bought '' . 
  bluh , i 've never figured out how to pronounce / \u0268 / . 
  makes my chinese and russian sound terrible . 
  i know . 
  : / but still . 
  it comes out more as / y / for me . 
  i 've seen my share of lcd leakage in my day , and i must say , this is one of the worst ... 
  ah , the old reddit -- wait .
