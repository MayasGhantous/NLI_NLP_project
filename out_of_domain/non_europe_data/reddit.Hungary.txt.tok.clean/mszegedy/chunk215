  that 's pretty significant evidence that it 's a kind of book that this person would like . 
  ( assuming he 's the average redditor . 
  which he is n't , not exactly , but there 's nothing much more statistically convincing that we can assume . ), 
  wow , when i first learned python , i was like , `` this is amazing , it 's like c and lisp got married and had a baby '' . 
  now i 'm like , `` this is amazing , it 's like python and scheme got married and had a baby '' . 
  thank you so much , i love working with these kinds of constructs . 
  heheheh , lazy evaluation ... 
  edit : okay , so , i 've only ever programmed in c and assembly , and a bit of lisp . 
  i started learning python about a week ago . 
  i knew all about the functional programming mindset , but wow . 
  generators ? 
  i 've never heard of this before , and it 's fucking wonderful . 
  thank you , thank you , thank you !, 
  slytherin !, 
  just kidding , ravenclaw !, 
  be sure to check out the thread below this one , it mentions it . 
  i do n't understand . 
  when i broke my right arm , i was perfectly capable using the left . 
  the politically correct term is `` hitler balls '' . 
  it seems like an appropriate way to repurpose something that is otherwise completely useless . 
  the machines of destruction deserve it . 
  and potatoes . 
  i do n't really think of it as a harry potter fanfic . 
  yudkowsky needed a way to communicate the importance of rationality , and he found that the harry potter universe is a uniquely good vehicle for that . 
  it 's to increase traffic to http://lesswrong.com , and it works . 
  and if you can sympathize with hjpev , then it 's a pretty good story standing alone as well , since then it * is * enveloping . 
  but obviously not a uniquely good piece of fiction . 
  however , it * did * point me to a lot of * good * things to read . 
  i really enjoyed * g\u00f6del , escher , bach * , but also the feynman lectures and * influence : science and practice * . 
  i bought * judgement under uncertainty * for a friend for christmas . 
  i wish there was an e. yudkowsky recommended reading list or something so that all of that is in one place . 
  i thought that machine translation would never get around the need for contextual information , and we 'd have to wait until strong ai for that kind of thing to happen , but statistical machine analysis is a really clever circumvention . 
  it 's surprising that you do n't have to know directly what a word corresponds to and how that thing behaves for you to translate it in a situation where it could ambiguously refer to something else , and the correct result is dependent on recognizing that certain translations do n't make sense semantically . 
  i mean , you could build a sort of semantic library for these sorts of situations -- a library where everything has certain properties annotated , `` things that move '' , `` things that can have colors '' , `` things that are only done by things that move '' , `` properties that can only be had by tangible things '' , et cetera , and rule out nonsense translations this way . 
  but that would be near-impossible to tune , and would end up being either not strict enough , too strict , or both . 
  but `` let the humans do it for you '' is a really clever alternative . 
  this is the wrong way to go about it . 
  do n't make a list ; make a continuous work that can be read like a book . 
  and also explain how to use and combat these fallacies . 
  ( [ it exists . 
  ] ( http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/how_to_actually_change_your_mind ) ), 
  hmm . 
  either [ s ] enter or [ s ] descend . 
  or maybe [ s ] cascade . 
  [ lol , buckets ] ( / r/buckets ), 
  i do n't think it 's that it 's a meme , i think it 's that it does n't make sense to put it there . 
  [ as seen on google croatia . 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/doodles/andrija-mohorovicics-156th-birthday ), 
   and our first-past-the-post system mixed with a 3 parties means the party with 34 % popular support wins an overwhelming majority and 60 % of canadians votes do not end up electing someone , ergo 60 % of canadians are not represented in government . 
  freedom, 
  that 's fallacious . 
  but i do n't understand what the other guy was talking about . 
  obviously you can choose from a space of more than two particular viewpoints , even if there are only two parties . 
  is he saying that if he moved away from canada , his mind would change how it works ? 
  i googled that and now i know a tiny , tiny bit more about scientology . 
  compared to knowing nothing about it before , this is an improvement !, 
  even though correlation not implying causation is an actual argument , whereas cognitive dissonance is hardly more than an insult !, 
  `` you believe contradictory things at the same time ! '', 
  is too vague to be a useful point . 
  good catch . 
  i ca n't believe he just did n't tag an nsfl post like that . 
  thank you , will make sure to open in dark room after having pupils dilated , and view screen through a pinhole from other side of room with a pair of unfocused binoculars . 
  you 're doing god 's work , son . 
  jongmin kim is n't a savant , but i love his html work . 
  you 're like richard stallman , but sexier . 
  more like `` sure-de '' . 
  pronounce the `` de '' like you 're german . 
  the problem is , all the best salads are also fattening . 
  i do n't even mean chicken , i mean cheese and dressing . 
  * certain * video games . 
  wii tennis , for example , does n't cut it . 
  cruel ? 
  absolutely . 
  entertaining to watch a gif of ? 
  lol , look at that cat bounce around !, 
  bouncey cat !, 
  sorry , those plants are way too late to be cambrian . 
  they have vascular systems and stuff . 
  what did you * think * it was made out of ? 
  lollipops ? 
  well , he 's one of the only ancient mesopotamian kings that you learn about in history class ( ie one of the only names you learn during the first month or so in a history class that starts at the beginning ) , so it 's pretty hard * not * to learn how to spell it correctly ( unless your history class just skips over it ) . 
  plus he 's in most textbooks that summarize ancient history , and it 's the same deal there . 
  you do n't even have to remember the history lesson , just look at the word once in the history book . 
  or , by syllable : ne - bu - chad - nez - zar, 
  hey !, 
  there are people that read college textbooks for recreation . 
  i 'm hurt !, 
  it 's reddit 's fault . 
  is this a pun thread that i 'm not getting ? 
  careful , your karma is on the line . 
  always trying to find the more favorable interpretation , right ? 
  no i mean of course , you should always look for a more favorable interpretation . 
  failing to recognize the fact that most of the traits you see in people when interacting with them for a short time are n't persistent traits that they always have is known as correspondence bias , and it 's an important thing to correct for . 
  i just found it funny that normally the way to correct for correspondence bias is to look for a more favorable interpretation , and you did the opposite . 
  well , it 's more favorable for the bystanders , but it 's just something about assuming that the guy 's an asshole . 
  it 's easier to forgive laughing at that , since it 's human to do so . 
  it 's a lot harder to forgive being an asshole . 
  so the net favorableness goes down . 
  i think it looks like it 's chambered , so that would make it an ammonite or nautilus of some kind . 
  but i ca n't get more specific than that unless you provide scale bars .
