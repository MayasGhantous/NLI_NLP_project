  i have a reference book but ... well ... 
  i 'm suddenly 10 % sure that it 's [ psiloceras sp . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psiloceras ) it 's really quite a common critter . 
  where did you find it ? 
  that would really help . 
  edit : oh , nevada ? 
  i have no idea whether that helps . 
  i do n't know devonian geography well at all . 
  do n't use it as a resource for particle physics !, 
  they had n't discovered quarks or in fact formulated the standard model at all yet . 
  they had n't discovered the strong force , either ( which is part of the standard model ) . 
  you should be fine on everything else . 
  was n't the standard model formulated in the 70s ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  / u/coattails 's comment was downvoted because it was irrelevant , i thought . 
  or is he somehow spitting on the grave of feynman ? 
  oh , it was n't life-threatening or anything . 
  it just went to the bone . 
  is this a terry pratchett quote ? 
  who said anything about coming to reddit for oc ? 
  you can also do this : only subscribe to tiny subreddits , and mostly use reddit for commenting in them . 
  mine did this too , until it broke and they had to do it by hand . 
  then it was always fast and silent . 
  jesus christ dude , stop being so disdainful . 
  that 's hypocritical . 
  just , whatever , okay ? 
  personally , i do n't like it because i associate it with teenagers thinking that they are deep , and using it as an excuse to do dumb things . 
  also , i do n't like the way it sounds ( that 's a really bad reason to use as a general argument against it , but i 'm entitled to feel that the aesthetic quality of something is unappealing to me ; i 'm not going to go around wanting to censor it for that , because like everyone else , i recognize that tastes differ between people ) . 
  if you find nothing wrong with it , that 's fine , too . 
  and of course you have the right to argue with people about that who disagree with you . 
  you 're practically obliged to . 
  but you ca n't talk down to someone like that , not if it 's with `` stop feeling superior to a particular person/group of people . '', 
  talking down to someone is tantamount to feeling superior to them , so you do n't have the right to criticize them for that . 
  sorry in advance if you feel that i 'm being unfair to you in my post !, 
  it 's hard interpreting people just based on a single interaction with them , and it 's even harder if this interaction is nothing but reading some text they typed in from their computer . 
  i know `` jesus christ dude '' is usually a pretty provocative statement , but i was just summarizing my feelings ( that i am surprised at the amount of negative content in your post ) , not trying to act disdainful . 
  that would be really hypocritical of me . 
  and then they complain about it , do n't they ? 
  well , at least you 're a better biology student than [ this dude ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/17706b/my_sister_teaches_biology_for_failing_high_school/ ) . 
  ( i 'm probably being really unfair to them , they 're probably the child of an illegal immigrant or something . ), 
  it raises really interesting questions about the true meaning of `` living '' , though . 
  kind of makes you think about it . 
  of course , they 've already come up with exact criteria for it , and i hope they taught something like this to the kids . 
  these are the ones that i learned :, 
  reproduces, 
  has information system ( like genes or something ), 
  reacts to environment, 
  i do n't remember the other three ( i think one was `` composed of cells '' , but that 's non-extraterrestrial-life-proof , so i ignore it . ), 
  if it has all of these properties at any point in time , it 's considered a biotic thing . 
  you should n't force something that people do n't necessarily want on them . 
  especially something incredibly , majorly life-altering like that . 
  very few of those people ( at most 0.001 % ) , given the opportunity , would choose the virus instead of developing normally . 
  not to mention the complicated developmental psychology involved in maturing without going through puberty and having the brain age normally for a few decades , but that 's beside the point in terms of the hypothetical situation we 're talking about . 
  who says that he failed to understand your plan ? 
  well , there * is * mental retardation , which decreases * de facto * intelligence in all or most areas , but even then , it 's mean to say `` stupid '' . 
  well , if we 're going down that road , there 's also zillywether , zillywenss , zillywither , zillywearfor , zillywear [ any preposition ] , and zillyhooz . 
  but ahab 's crosshairs are objectively nothing compared to any kind of wand , ie the thistles of zillywich . 
  i feel like your comment made a true statement . 
  because it has a half-life measured in nanoseconds . 
  damn chrome, 
  i was just thinking that . 
  we have reserves . 
  roughly , the person confused the word `` alive '' with `` functional '' . 
  it 's relative pronouns that it uses , and you can make a relative pronoun out of any preposition by putting `` where '' in front of it . 
  it 's equivalent to '' [ preposition ] which '' , as in `` the cabinet above which i placed '' vs. `` the cabinet whereabove i placed '' . 
  you can also use them with `` here '' and `` there '' to mean '' [ preposition ] this '' and '' [ preposition ] that '' , like this : `` in the section herebelow , i describe how to use ... '' of course , no one ever ever does any of this ( except `` whereof '' and `` thereof '' and sometimes `` hereof '' ) because language is good for anything when most people who speak it know what you 're talking about when you use it . 
  edit : and `` whereupon '' , `` hereupon '' , and `` thereupon '' work , too . 
  yeah . 
  i thought those were excluded because of , `` does not react to environment '' . 
  because viruses really do n't !, 
  they 're just molecules ( and groups thereof ) with shapes that are exactly right for them to be mistaken for something to be transported into the cell , which then get transported into the cell . 
  or at the very least their dna is . 
  i 'm not sure ; i have n't taken a course in virology or anything . 
  i feel like i just wanted to use `` i feel like '' for ironic effect . 
  circumcision is still completely not a big deal compared to this . 
  ( also , i also believe that circumcision has the same problem . 
  i 'm against it . ), 
  it 's not a question of nature screwing up , or nature deciding anything at all . 
  there are real benefits to developing bodily over time , such as the ability to bear children , and also social respect , although that might be able to change , although i doubt that it would be much better even after a millennium if this was actually implemented . 
  it 's a question of what people * want * . 
  we should n't do anything against the will of people . 
  the greater a negative impact it has on those people , the harder it is to justify it . 
  a youth virus is nearly unjustifiable that way . 
  ( only nearly , though . 
  if there was , say , some sort of constant threat that the entire human race would get wiped out save for bodily children , but the threat was only 10 % probable to occur in a 75 year span , then you might be able to justify it . 
  then the people might actually be glad that they contracted the virus , as well , though that 's not likely . ), 
  it has a very large negative impact on these people , compared to the tiny positive impact of sexual satisfaction that it would provide for pedophiles . 
  in fact , ironically , it would n't solve the problem of making pedophilia morally justifiable , because it was morally wrong to convert these people to perpetual children in the first place !, 
  he only seemed indian in the thumbnail . 
  i admit i do n't understand that one, 
  yep, 
  i said roughly !, 
  i could explain a detailed thought process behind this , but i have to sleep , because i 'm really tired . 
  i 'll get back to you tomorrow ( maybe ) !, 
  and also he said the pen was biotic , not non-biotic . 
  but do n't you know , man ? 
  it 's the women 's fault for being attractive . 
  i 'm * obliged * to creep on them . 
  really , you ought to be more socially conscious . 
  i never knew that people other than teenagers had tumblrs .
