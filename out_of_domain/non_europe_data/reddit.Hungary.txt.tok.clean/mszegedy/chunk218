  jc that 's just asking for a car crash . 
  even if they 're only skyping . 
  no , from ender 's game . 
  he saw him hard at work , in a commercial . 
  or on reddit . 
  he still saw him !, 
  gum , i think . 
  where can i go to practice ? 
  i know python , but it takes too long to write something to generate problems for me . 
  what does that mean ? 
  `` know thyself '' ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  you think it 's a good idea to use your laptop and drive at the same time ? 
  i mean , i 'd completely understand it if it you were parked or sitting in a traffic jam , but those are special cases . 
  this is not okay outside of that . 
  it 's where i first internalized kepler orbits from . 
  although it gets repetitive and boring after a while . 
  but it 's really fun for the first several hours !, 
  almost have to have observed a system where a massive object got hurled through the system of a star with bodies orbiting around it ? 
  why ? 
  space is extremely empty . 
  even given two colliding galaxies , it 's unlikely that this happens . 
  huh . 
  i was just guessing based on what i know about latin ( where there is the verb `` cognoscere '' and the pronoun `` se '' , meaning respectively `` to know ( as in to be familiar with ) '' and `` himself/theirself '' , and this looked similar , what with `` gno '' being in both of the `` know '' verbs and `` se '' being a reflexive root for both languages , and '' - on '' being the ancient greek accusative ) . 
  thank you !, 
  glad you were okay . 
  also , it 's really funny that you spelled `` lieutenant '' right , but got `` you 're '' wrong . 
  [ honk ] ( / lordenglishsecrettext ), 
  well , i mean , she definitely comforted * me * with * something * , but i just do n't think `` mustache '' is the right term for it . 
  `` other ( please specify ) : '', 
  going further , several of those look tolerable to me , assuming i live in a low-income family as a kid ( i sort of did , but it was in a second-world country , so it 's not like i was behind the majority of the country 's population ; actually , i think i was better off , considering the good school i went to ) . 
  they look like something a poor kid would have gotten for his birthday six years ago and still uses , or the only family computer in a tiny two-bedroom in a ghetto somewhere . 
  and there were one or two that looked very much just like `` i moved into a new apartment and i have n't bought furniture yet '' . 
  it 's the ones with all the shit strewn about that are unappealing , because obviously they 're places where a tenant spends * most * of his time , and not just a low-budget setup because you 're part of a poor family and this is all you can afford , or a temporary setup while you acquire possessions . 
  edit : okay , i sorted them :, 
  i 'm poor and have a family , and this the family computer : [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/moqxe.jpg ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/loivsh.jpg ), 
  i just moved into a new apartment : [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j81c2h.jpg ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zw72u.jpg ), 
  i have a very low-paying job and own a small living space : [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0gbdzh.jpg ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7uwwe.jpg ) [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/73c4c.jpg ), 
  i just never clean my keyboard : [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f1acrh.jpg ) ( seriously , everyone on my father 's side of the family have keyboards like this , even though they 're perfectly normal people working high-paying jobs ), 
  i 'm not an upper-class person : [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7gi3dh.jpg ) ( i really do n't understand what 's wrong with this one . 
  the dude owns an apartment and keeps it clean . 
  he does n't buy much furniture , because he 's not rich . 
  he might be a grad student or something . ), 
  it would n't , i was making a joke . 
  the foreshortening still is n't done very well , though . 
  her fist is n't in proportion with the rest of her body . 
  the fact that 3027 even had that reaction should already raise an eyebrow at the artist . 
  edit : or python 3 . x :, 
  aargh with all my internalization of greek orthography , i 'm so ashamed that i can understand you, 
  for example : [ thyestes is one massive asshole parade ] ( http://bettermyths.com/thyestes-is-one-massive-asshole-parade/ ), 
  wait , * i 'm * the snooty person ? 
  ( also actually i 'd say that physics majors would find it more funny than math majors . 
  but what do i know , i majored in biomedical engineering . ), 
  well , that picture is kind of an exaggeration . 
  and one of my uncles does n't ; he works at google and they do n't tolerate that kind of shit there . 
  but yeah , it 's actually really gross even so . 
  and sometimes i have to debug them . 
  well , build him a coffin . 
  you could have hit someone in the head and killed them !, 
  haha !, 
  sorry , too many people on the internet have misunderstood my attitude as overbearing ( when i 'm going for `` friendly '' ) . 
  not the nose ? 
  short answer : no . 
  i am genetically compatible with humans thousands of years back . 
  my kids will be , too . 
  edit : `` no '' to `` are we a different species '' . 
  wait , but homestuck-themed memes like 413 , 612 , 1025 , and 111 are okay ? 
  no it should n't , big subreddits are bad . 
  well , it ca n't be * that * badly-written if it worked on germany . 
  but i agree . 
  they should have ben a flash , dammit !, 
  can you imagine this with moving pictures and music ? 
  why ? 
  i know that he is a leading homestuck theorist , but which of his papers does it specifically reference ? 
  i do n't read them . 
  that 's not a good argument for it . 
  its uniqueness in that it caused wwii in a way would be a good argument for reading it from that point of view , but people who have read it say that it 's unremarkable , so that one gets tossed out the window . 
  we could have done that before the flash . 
  then had the flash . 
  oh god i just had a flashback to algol, 
  but i want * these * moments as a flash . 
  i just would have liked to see a flash of this , that 's all !, 
  i like flashes . 
  i do n't claim to know anything about storytelling . 
  i 'm a really shitty storyteller . 
  i understand , but when i see very dramatic moments in the story that have visual buildup , it looks to me like something that would make an enjoyable flash , regardless of where they are in the story . 
  if it ruins the structure of the story if it 's made into one , say if things get even more tense from this point on , then of course it 's not worth it to make it a flash ; on the other hand , if this was a large climax , then it seems reasonable to me to make it into a flash . 
  and we can only know whether that will happen if the story continues . 
  you ca n't take a derivative at the boundary of a function . 
  ( however , there is such a thing as extrapolation . 
  which is what we 're doing now ? 
  whatever , hussie knows best . ), 
  i thought it was a kiwi . 
  i feel your excitement . 
  someday i hope to accomplish something like this in the field . 
  actually , 8 is the only ball that * does n't * flash on le 's face . 
  except in that one panel with the gun . 
  no fuck you, 
  huh . 
  well , at any rate , jack 's eyes were n't flashing black .
