  they solder ram to the motherboard ? 
  that 's pretty ... hardcore . 
  ohai , english is my second language as well !, 
  and yeah , the internet is largely preoccupied with what level of english you speak at . 
  here 's an excellent copy pasta from another website that largely sums up the matter :, 
  why does everyone think that the level of english is the most accurate indication of someone 's intelligence ? 
  on the internet , making a grammar error makes you some sort of retard , and everyone likes to go round correcting every mistake they see , because they 'll be seen a geniuses . 
  you think people who use text speak on facebook walls are idiots ? 
  if you actually had any non-idiot friends , you 'd know that a lot of intelligent , educated people use text speak . 
  from my experience , those who type properly with caps and punctuation are mostly pseudointellectual drop outs , artistic liberals , etc. 
  on the other hand , being bad at math is totally cool : `` i 'm so terrible at math i ca n't even add lololol , '' when mathematical ability correlates directly with intelligence , and skipping it serves no intelligible purpose . 
  i 've wanted to upgrade my macbook early 2008 's video card for a while now ... the first time i opened it up , i was greatly disappointed . 
  ( it has replaceable ddr2 ram , though . ), 
  are you in on the joke ? 
  mail one to him , maybe ? 
  well , we 'll get sandstone stairs eventually . 
  but tell me about your arcane `` map markers '' . 
  [ you do n't get the joke .

  my friends and i beat you to this . 
  we played catan on our minecraft server over six time zones !, 
  it was epic , and lasted , like , four hours . 
  ( we used a much , much larger board than normal and had eight players ), 
  sideways female torso ? 
  [ i have ... ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/116/253/i_have_the_weirdest_boner_right_now_344.jpg ), 
  oh , that 's what you mean by map marker !, 
  i had no idea what you were saying . 
  hmm , sounds tricky to implement ... 
  please tell me where this is from . 
  that is too ingenious for me to believe that you thought of that on your own . 
  i did , but my hard drive failed last weekend . 
  d : one of my friends has a couple i think , but he 's asleep right now . 
  pretty much, 
  have you enabled pigtails in the farm query under the season you want them to grow pigtails ? 
  are you sure you have pig tail seeds ? 
  the minecraft one, 
  relevant , now . 
  guise check it out someone on reddit has a girlfriend, 
  rape - * ih * . 
  but yes , the `` rape '' is in there . 
  holy shit , that fjord looks epic . 
  you know , if you have a novelty account , you can upvote yourself . 
  i 'm sorry , but that makes no fucking sense . 
  upvoted in the name of hungary, 
  but i believe it 's vizsla, 
  so , like `` carriage '' but with short [ \u0279 ] and [ a ] instead of [ \u00e6 ] ( and , i guess , [ \u0268 ] instead of [ \u026a ] ) ? 
  copied your tag exactly . 
  red background . 
  holy shit , thank you for showing me that . 
  i purchased it legally , and was able to play it to the end . 
  i kind of liked it , actually , half the time , and the other half the time ,, 
  features, 
  that thumbnail ... 
  did you ? 
  what does this exactly do ? 
  oh , i remember this !, 
  i saw a video of this a while ago ( i think , i know it was the same mod ) !, 
  i 'm not one for mods , but i liked it very much . 
  good job !, 
  how did you do this ? 
  if there is a google bombing utility somewhere , i want to know about it . 
  this is actually a good idea . 
  for a mod , anyway . 
  jeb ca n't fix every little thing . 
  upvote for self poast, 
  when i upvote this , its just a substitute for downvoting it, 
  what about backspace on macs ? 
  would n't she be able to identify you by voice ? 
  and , nice username . 
  too bad this is too short to be an actual post ; would have made an excellent . 
  they 're very similar cases actually . 
  in both , the problem is that the end user does n't like being told that they 're wrong . 
  just slightly different ways of coping . 
  jesus that 's stupid . 
  he could have had a hearing difficulty and been too embarrassed to ask you to repeat it a couple more times . 
  i know , because i often do this on the end user side . 
  i do n't have a hearing disability , just a weird difficulty with understanding the spoken word ( in english , anyway ; other languages are fine ) . 
  til there was such a thing . 
  where is it ? 
  ( maybe i just automatically gloss over it in the menu or something and have looked at it a ton of times but never noticed it ? ), 
  wow , this is by far the most immersive story i 've read here or in talesfromtechsupport . 
  great job on telling a detailed and realistic story !, 
  ( that , like all the others here , is sadly true ), 
  ... where are you from ? 
  the - y ending is indeed pronounced [ \u026a ] in the more upper class british accents , but in , say , america , it 's pronounced [ i\u02d0 ] , so unfortunately your comparison does not work across multiple dialects . 
  well , modding was fairly okay for it . 
  i actually made a few mods myself . 
  buzzsphere ( descendant of betterspore ) was a good mod for it . 
  what part ? 
  novelty account created fifteen minutes ago ? 
  hmm ... 
  yeah , it looked like a fridge with two of those thin plastic segmented pipes coming out of it . 
  this could have been an intermediate model . 
  yeah , but witnessing the creation of one feels kind of stupid . 
  grats, 
  you have figure out hiragana, 
  by the way , in latin the interrogative pronoun in the accusative is `` quid '' , not `` quod '' . 
  but that 's okay . 
  [ that explains it then .
