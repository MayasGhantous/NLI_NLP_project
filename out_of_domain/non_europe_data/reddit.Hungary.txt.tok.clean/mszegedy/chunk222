  i think it 's unfair that the effort/money curve looks like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w89umja.png ) ( sorry the scale is inconsistent , i could n't do a lin or log scale without getting too invovlved ; also sorry for any inaccuracies , be sure to tell me ) , and it depends instead on the factors that you mentioned . 
  instead , i think the correlation should be linear , without too much influence from genetic factors . 
  i personally do n't really need to worry about it , since i 'm studying to be a biologist , but then i 'm also annoyed by the linear correlation of social status with money ( i think it should be sqrt ( effort ) or ln ( effort ) . ), 
  then again , it 's kind of difficult to judge people at all , because everyone is a composite of their experiences and physiological traits and not much else , so maybe social status and money should be constant with respect to effort and we should work towards educating people to give optimal ( not 100 % , once it goes above a certain amount , it 's sub-optimal in various ways ) effort all the time ? 
  i know it 's a popular opinion , and also a lot to ask , but i 'm putting it here for anyone who wants to disagree with me . 
  debate is fun !, 
  what would you suggest ? 
  i went by `` mentally taxing + physically taxing '' . 
  i did n't say weapons , i said that they carry them around . 
  actually , they 're being upvoted by more angry teenagers . 
  wow , that 's a really good idea in general . 
  also , he can use his left hand , probably just like he 's going to use it for everything else . 
  would that be silent ? 
  when i was going through puberty , i had to hush my mother , not the other way around . 
  i 'm probably one of the most privileged people on a planet , but i have n't come across that behavior not taking place in me , including when it did not relate to me or a group of people at all . 
  are you sure it 's because of privilege ? 
   [ on books ], 
  i read mostly textbooks . 
   scientism, 
  i 've only heard that word used once before , and it was when i made a ( relevant ) post in / r/catholicism in which i typed like i was a passionate ( but respectful ) , dramatic atheist ( i do n't know why but it was fun ; i do n't normally hold these views , and i 've only ever done that sort of thing twice ) , and i received a polite reply that included this word . 
  it used it as though it meant `` the belief that science is the solution to everything '' . 
  wkipedia [ agrees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientism ) . 
  i confess that i do believe that science is the solution to most things . 
  is that the definition that you meant to use when you included it in your post ? 
  i read it more as `` holding a high opinion of science without knowing much about it '' . 
   [ on the singularity ], 
  hey !, 
  there 's educated and resourceful people working specifically to create it . 
  they 're called the [ singularity institute ] ( http://singularity.org ) and affiliates , and they 're working to create strong ai ( very carefully ) , which should enable us to just ask it to solve any problem we want , which would bring about a great change in society . 
  since you said you do n't believe that the singularity that will ever come to pass , do you :, 
  - believe that we will never invent strong ( and friendly ) ai ? 
  - believe that it will not solve our problems ? 
  - believe that solving our problems via ai will not fundamentally change our lifestyles ? 
   [ on determinism ], 
  ca n't laplace 's demon for an outside observer be modified to be compatible with qm ? 
  i believe in determinism in the sense that i believe that if you took the universe and ran it from start to finish again , then on the whole it would be exactly the same in every way ( assuming everett rather than copenhagen ) , since otherwise the laws of physics would have to be fundamentally inconsistent . 
  ( i do n't know too much about qm , but i thought that amplitude flows are deterministic . 
  please , please correct me if i 'm wrong and talking nonsense . ), 
  paradox space has air . 
  it 's just bosonic instead of fermionic . 
  hs characters breathe massless bosons , not fermionic air molecules . 
  ( this explains how everyone can breathe , but there 's no fluid friction for neither the ship , nor the asteroid , and they can breathe just as well at the speed of light as standing still . 
  but it contradicts how john is supposed to be able to control wind . ), 
  or maybe hs characters do n't breathe . 
  quick , have we ever seen anyone suffering from a lack of something to breathe ? 
  well , either way there 's fluid on at least the asteroid , since terezi can use smell to sense stuff . 
  the furthst ring has no geometry ; `` center '' is n't something you can hse to refer to anything . 
  ~ ~ but the circadian clock is periodic to one day , and a week is a multiple of a day ! ~ ~, 
  ignore me im an idiot, 
  well i guess either it explains it or is refuted by it . 
  hmm ... . . , . 
  well , obviously either we 're at home and he 's just come out of the sauna ( they got a sauna built , i 've never tried it ) , or we 're at the city swimming pool and we 're swimming . 
  if we 're anywhere else ... well , i guess he did n't feel like taking the speedo off ? 
  or oort cloud . 
  i do n't see why you 're getting downvoted . 
  i think the original was better , too . 
  hit me up . 
  this is not worthy of depthhub at all . 
  this is something you learn in eighth grade us history class . 
  ( if you live in the us . 
  if you do n't , you 'll learn it whenever you first take us history . 
  if you do n't take us history , then why would you want to know in the first place ? 
  or you can even just visit ellis island , goddammit . 
  or read books . ), 
  yes , america used to have especially many immigrants , and yes , those immigrants had cultures , and yes , they used them to distinguish themselves from other immigrants with other cultures . 
  this is not a new fact !, 
  it 's a well-known , well-studied period in the history of america . 
  also , it 's , like , two paragraphs . 
  it 's nearly impossible to say anything involved and worthwhile in two short paragraphs . 
  i 'm only talking about the comment , which i do n't consider `` insightful '' . 
  sorry , i misread it , i guess . 
  well , gravity * is n't * comapatible with the sm , so if you were actually taking a class that taught you the full sm , then they probably really would write it that way . 
  ( unless it * is * compatible . 
  i thought it was n't , but do n't take it for granted that what i believe is true . ), 
  well , but that was after homestuck had amassed some thirty or so characters already , possibly even more depending on who you count . 
  also , not * all * the a1 trolls were flat characters . 
  i 've never liked his compositions . 
  i 've always felt that he does n't really know how to compose for the orchestra . 
  he has no sense of development , and is bad at mixing instruments , both in instrument choice and in instrument volume . 
  his rhythm is very boring to listen to . 
  he should listen to some successful symphonies and see how they are structured . 
  and believe me , if i knew how to write a * good * orchestral piece , i 'd do it myself . 
  it 's pronounced like `` heh '' but with a glottal stop at the end . 
  and that ubuntu machine needs to be a vm run on a mac . 
  i tried , but could n't without breaking it up into separate lines . 
  here it is ignoring that rule :, 
  ## *** house ***, 
  *** of leaves ***, 
  ( bold because why not ), 
  gee , how gracious of you . 
  i was practically dying for your approval . 
  that sounds amazing . 
  how does such a thing even exist ? 
  would n't it have to be like a blender ? 
  but , randomly , for no reason . 
  if you need a laptop , you have to buy one . 
  avoid sony . ), 
  otherwise if you 're fine with a desktop , you should use that money to build the best damn gaming pc there ever was . 
  time for the karma train, 
  michael j. phelps ?
