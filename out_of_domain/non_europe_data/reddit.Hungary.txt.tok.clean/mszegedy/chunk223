  [ this ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&amp;p=001597 ) was the first mspa panel i ever saw . 
  it was on the day that it was posted . 
  i 've been a fan since . 
  scarves are too mainstream . 
  exactly how it 's spelled . 
  that 's seven words . 
  edit : [ ] ( / docfacepalm ), 
  19th century london had a higher death rate than birth rate . 
  ( source : my high school world history book ), 
  it comes out so beautifully . 
  there 's been papers on this . 
  it 's a natural tendency for stringy things like these and cables to do this . 
  it also depends on the rigidity of the substance of the stringy thing . 
  on average ( invariant even when restricted to grade level ) , i perform at a 89 % on any math test , even ones involving single-digit addition . 
  this is why my teachers in high school never believed me when i said that i inderstood the material perfectly . 
  i just realized that i 've never referred to it out loud in english , because all of the people i ski with regularly are hungarian , and so we speak in hungarian , not english . 
  oh well , disregard . 
  at least you know how to pronounce it in hungarian . 
  ( that * is * how it 's pronounced in hungarian . 
  stress the first syllable . ), 
  edit : it 's pronounced the same in english , except the first syllable is a high a , like in `` bad '' , and you stress the `` clah '' . 
  [ ] excellent, 
  [ ] good, 
  [ ] okay, 
  [ ] bad, 
  [ ] completely terrible, 
  [ ] so bad it 's good, 
  [ ] so bad it 's even worse, 
  [ \u221a ] this joke, 
  this is a completely horrible joke and you should feel mildly ashamed for making it . 
  instead of awkwardly proud of how popular your thread is , despite knowing that it is an especially meaningless pursuit , and the approval of reddit users is n't an existentially satisfying or otherwise beneficial thing . 
  the upvoters should also feel ashamed of themselves for thinking it was worth upvoting . 
  just for a moment there , they suspended their judgement so much as to allow themselves to upvote this joke . 
  it was a lapse of intellect bordering on nonsentience . 
  they should exercise more thought in their voting next time . 
  damn i dislike that orthography . 
  it 's just a creative cipher . 
  how about someone construct a real gallifreyan language ? 
  i 've done it before . 
  ( i do n't have time to post the link . 
  if anyone shows any interest , i 'll do so . 
  be warned : it 's a logographic language with no established vocabulary ; i just laid down a zillion grammar rules . ), 
  edit : http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/sfh0j/i_composed_a_grammar_and_vocabulary_system_for/, 
  then why did n't mario die ? 
  i try to think of it as performance art , not sincere commenting . 
  it was a bad joke , but it does n't deserve hyperbole . 
  pay a nickel ? 
  you 're ... someone who 's heard of photosynthesis ? 
  he was n't necessarily referencing anything . 
  it 's a comment that anyone could have written . 
  tada, 
  ( look up ; i spent the last full hour looking for it ), 
  it works fine for me . 
  it 's a link leading to a reddit link leading to a forum post leading to a mediafire upload , correct ? 
  which one does n't exist ? 
  i can upload it to my dropbox if you like . 
  that 's very strange . 
  i 'm on the latest alienblue on the latest iphone , and i can access it just fine . 
  try searching `` gallifreyan '' on the forum if all else fails . 
  you know what , though ? 
  fuck my policy of non-interference regarding phonology and syntax . 
  northeastern gallifreyan is not a tonal language on the syllabic level , but very much so on the suprasegmental level . 
  there , i said it !, 
  we should n't use quantitative methods for anything relating to people in the first place . 
  ( this is not what i believe , but w/e ), 
  yeah . 
  this is a pretty pitiful sample size . 
  n = 1 is never enough . 
  it 's harder if it 's in an obscure language you do n't know , and the answer key is in english . 
  in march or so ( the 22nd maybe ) you 'll all get to enjoy one such thing . 
  ( your saving grace ? 
  the obscure language has noun genders with endings , and all the words you have to find are either nouns or verbs . 
  and you 're given a couple words to start . 
  the real test is n't he word search at all , really . 
  it 's translating the words . ), 
  ~ half hr delay . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  it still reads like it was written by twelve-year-olds . 
  ... wait , it is n't ? 
  i mean , i 'd value them all the same , but then if you want to put people on a scale , then that 's not the metric you 'd use ? 
  i once saw an article from a cracked author that told you to man the fuck up and start being useful to people , since that 's the only time when people like you . 
  where did it get to ? 
  write an autobiography, 
  cite it, 
  that 's bad . 
  rational practice is to approach every argument with equal skepticism , including ones you initially agree with . 
  otherwise it will become difficult to change your mind about anything . 
  and that 's bad , because your beliefs are rarely optimal . 
  worth in society : what people can get out of/from you . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  well . 
  i mean . 
  is n't that sort of our society ? 
  i ca n't really think of anything that is n't like that . 
  even making friends is that : we want company/dialogue/drinks from them . 
  raising children is the only potential exception i can think of , but even then it 's almost always motivated by something other than complete selflessness . 
  maybe it 's to please your partner , or to have something to be proud of , or social approval , or something else , but it 's almost never `` i want to raise children because all i want to do is make them as happy as possible for the rest of their lives . '', 
  ed 's point is to be funny , while offending everyone equally , and maybe actually covering stuff to some extent . 
  except that it reads like a compilation of sentences that twelve-year-olds thought sounded funny . 
  that 's not funny , that 's embarrassing .
