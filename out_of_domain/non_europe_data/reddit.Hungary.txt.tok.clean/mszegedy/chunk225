  but there 's similar stuff out there . 
  there 's also just camps that are general summer programs whose curriculum consists of `` do stuff outside '' . 
  i think that 's what most people refer to when they say `` camp '' . 
  and then there 's camps that are only called that because they are extracurriculars , and maybe happen during the summer , and maybe they 're `` hands-on '' in some way . 
  but they 're not the typical `` do stuff outside '' camp . 
  brag level :, 
  keywords :, 
  `` northwestern '', 
  `` for fun '', 
  `` as an eighth grader '', 
  ( it 's okay , i learned calculus for fun when i was little too . 
  i do n't bring it up on the internet , though . ), 
  i did n't say it wasn ' f hypothetical situation . 
  i 'm saying that it considers the hypothetical situation as though there is a possibility that it is reality , whereas the `` were '' substitution does n't . 
  no , just that it considers it with equal weight with respect to other possibilities . 
  the original sentence was specifically implying that this might be the case . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  it 's the wrong tense , which brings other errors into it . 
  `` was '' is a hypothetical past situation that could be a reality , and `` what if '' offers the phrase as a likely factual past event . 
  `` were '' is a hypothetical strictly counterfactual present situation , offered by `` what if '' as a replacement for the present situation . 
  it was relevant . 
  i 'd start with just modeling , rather than animation . 
  the most remarkable first-year student ? 
  yes . 
  there 's one in nearly the exact spot that i was born ( check out miskolc , hungary ) , but it 's from 1559 . 
  ... i have a confession to make . 
  i 'm not actually contemporaneous with you guys ... 
   land of latex and touch, 
  i 'm going to pretend that it wanted to say latex . 
  because it 's more interesting that way . 
  where do you see that last bit ? 
  all i see are pcbs . 
  okay , we can all go home now . 
  there will never be anyone on reddit better than him . 
  we 're not worthy to comment on the same website as this guy . 
  we should turn reddit into a blog for him , so he can dispense more valuable life lessons like `` stop being angry at people on the internet and go outside '' . 
  in all seriousness , though , first of all , if you followed your own advice , you would n't be making these comments in the first place . 
  second , who said anyone was angry ? 
  maybe we 're just doing other readers a favor so that they can not waste their time reading your comments . 
  that 's got nothing to do with you personally ; just no one benefits from your comment . 
  it 's a trite , boringly contrary opinion that there is already a huge amount of more worthwhile literature on , accompanied by stupid bragging . 
  no one wants to read that . 
  that 's what downvotes are for . 
  if you did n't like reading a comment , and you think someone else would n't either , then you downvote . 
  it 's how it works . 
  anger takes no part in the process . 
  why ? 
  who really cares at all ? 
  it 's a bit more enjoyable if it 's real , and it makes no difference either way ( unless you try to cite it as evidence for something , which you should know not to ) , so why not assume it 's real ? 
  honestly though , ignoring it is the best way to treat it . 
  i 'd appreciate it if you linked to more obscure tropes , instead of ones that everyone 's already seen . 
  that way it 's less boring . 
  i 'm not a fan of clumsily extended metaphors . 
  i 'm okay with character * development * . 
  not ... character boringification through hanging out with the wrong crowd . 
  can we get tvtlinker up in here ? 
  i do n't know , would you be sad after a blackrom breakup ? 
  maybe ? 
  i think so ... 
  wait really ? 
  what about scratchstuck ? 
  so then its existence is terrible because it 's pointless . 
  and that 's mcd 's fault . 
  you should n't take advantage of people like that . 
  also , i do n't completely agree . 
  if you 're very poor , then mcd is the only option for you to buy food from . 
  imagine if that option were taken away . 
  edit : apparently mcd is more expensive than i remember it being . 
  nvm then . 
  huh . 
  i remember buying a big mac for a dollar . 
  what happened to that ? 
  more expensive . 
  well , then i retract my previous statement . 
  damn . 
  you too !, 
  when i first implemented qsort in erlang in one line , i was so delighted . 
  it 's beautiful if you know python !, 
  i 've always loved using that . 
  six characters to accomplish that ... 
  reddit comments were pretty much never intelligent . 
  not front-page ones , anyway . 
  well five lines technically :, 
  - module ( qsort ) . 
  - export ( [ qsort/1 ] ) . 
  qsort ( [ ] ) -  [ ] ;, 
  qsort ( [ h | t ] ) -  qsort ( [ x | | x < - t , x < h ] ) + + [ h ] + + qsort ( [ x | | x < - t , x  = h ] ) . 
  i 'll admit that i forgot about the base case , but i was referring to that last line , since that 's the one that makes it qsort . 
  flanderization is different , it 's exaggerating already present and prominent qualities in a character . 
  terezi would have entirely new qualities that are boring and terrible . 
  good choice choosing an archaic one . 
  going for the most recent phylogeny would have problems , in that it would become out of date in two minutes after you got the tatoo . 
  this way it does n't matter , because the value is historical . 
  ... is n't that a documentary ? 
  i 'm still not getting it . 
  hey , you could perfectly understand surgery and still leave a pigeon inside someone 's ribcage . 
  i perfectly understand addition as arising from first principles , and yet i sometimes get 6 + 7 = 15 and such by accident . 
  english does n't even * have * cases . 
  except possessive/genitive , and accusative/objective in pronouns . 
  ( i prefer the terms `` possessive '' and `` accusative '' respectively , myself . ),
