  i wish we spoke something more synthetic , like german or something . 
  that would be more fun and less ambiguous . 
  play antichamber . 
  it 's a fun puzzle game . 
  or minecraft , if you want to build stuff in 3d . 
  ( go to / r/minecraft , it 's really inspiring . ), 
  there 's a lot of other games , too . 
  or go and read something . 
  there 's a lot of interesting literature out there . 
  or go and watch something from mit ocw . 
  or there 's a qm course on edx right now that you could sign up for if you do n't know qm yet . 
  or you could program something , maybe a game or organization software or computer algebra system . 
  if you do n't know a programming language , learn one , it 's fun . 
  i suggest python or lisp . 
  i used to suggest c , but what kind of beginner wants to deal with memory management ? 
  or there 's always the no excuse list . 
  ( google it . ), 
  those are n't cases . 
  cases are specifically inflections of nouns that are used in different situations . 
  [ if you do n't believe me , ask wikipedia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_case ) or a linguist . 
  well , you can read [ this ] ( http://lesswrong.com/lw/f4e/logical_pinpointing/ ) . 
  or some other stuff . 
  check out peano arithmetic . 
  ooh , also you could read godel , escher , bach . 
  it 's about a lot of stuff but you 'll learn numbers on the way too to some extent . 
  it 's a really fun book , so i really reccomend it . 
  the first chapter of spivak 's calculus is also something that deals with fundamental axioms for arithmetic , if you want to read that . 
  http://codecademy.com has a moderately good interactive python course . 
  it 's also got ruby and some web dev things . 
  i do n't understand , are you being sarcastic , or did you misspell ateeism ? 
  the idea of this sub is , on one level , to make fun of / r/atheism . 
  this was a / r/atheism post , and op here only changed two letters . 
  it 's funny , because it sounds so made-up and whiny when you substitute golf for religion . 
  it 's got every right to be in this sub . 
  teeists are starting to take over this subreddit . 
  i fear its future is grim . 
  or at least , their environments have certain properties that hell also has . 
  ^ ( also come on , `` vast majority '' , really ? 
  i 'll accept at most `` one third '' without any citation ; sources please ? ), 
  also to increase the amount of straw that touches the ice . 
  currently it 's way not enough . 
  why not just mix the drinks ? 
  the second word is `` cursor '' . 
  the first one is probably a verb . 
  hey it 's not that bwahahahahaha, 
  what did i do wrong ? 
  ( english is n't my first language . 
  i thought `` way '' could be used as an emphatic , though ? ), 
  ... not necessarily ? 
  why does it have to be a tesseract , as opposed to anything else ? 
  and it 's not even possible for it to be a tesseract , since some of its geometry is ( hyper - ) toroidal ( for example , many paths to nowhere ) . 
  this is the least witty satire i have ever seen . 
  yes . 
  i mean that this post is the least witty satire i have ever seen . 
  the hs is fine . 
  just , taking hs text that 's already obviously referring to a particular thing , and then putting the obvious label on it ? 
  that 's completely not creative in any way . 
  that 's like looking at a home video of a two-year-old destroying something , and slapping `` bush '' and `` science '' labels on the kid and the something respectively . 
  it 's the obvious comparison that anyone could have thought of , and someone saying it out loud gives the impression that they actually think that they are * smart * for having said it . 
  demos are usually released after pre-alphas but before alphas . 
  ( nobody mention minecraft , just please do n't . ), 
  that does n't make any of what he said not possible . 
  we started with zero . 
  probably one that is painless . 
  gunshot wound to head is painless , but there 's a large chance of error . 
  some sort of chemical anaesthesia sounds like it meets that criterion , though . 
  does overdosing on sleeping pills give you headaches , or just kill you ? 
  yeah , it 's like the person who placed the shades was blind or something . 
  hmm ? 
  define `` twice as good '' , also cite your sources . 
  so do i , it looks fascinating . 
  solution : refresh . 
  you can use a keyboard combo or a new window for a duplicate tab . 
  no , it 's very not helpful , due to complete clutter . 
  99 % of people on this reddit already understand trigonometry ; why bother us with this when you could link to an interesting paper instead ? 
  never . 
  pi is too much of a standard to stop now . 
   yeah !, 
  we can write in secret code and english at the same time !, 
  in hs i had an analysis teacher that only took the verb `` shrink '' for when you scaled either axis of a function using a coefficient 0 < k < 1 . 
  i said `` squash by 3 '' once because i could n't remember `` shrink '' , and i got points off . 
  when i asked whether i could say `` scale by 1/3 '' , she said no . 
  `` shrink by 1/3 '' only . 
  not `` shrink by 3 '' . 
  not using any other verb than `` shrink '' . 
  it was the same thing for coefficients k  1 , but i do n't remember the verb , because i never got it right and the forgot to ask about it . 
  it might have been `` stretch '' , but i 'm only 40 % sure . 
  `` okay , i have an opportunity to create a very large artistic sculpture , in a public place , in an eye-catching medium . 
  '' ... better make it of a napkin . '', 
  mrcheeze , meet chainsaw . 
  peanut butter is a standard thing to put in some noodle dishes . 
  specifically , the fifth percentile of deliciousness . 
  it probably works just as well with ramen . 
  also / r/hpmor, 
  anecdotally , i think i 've seen about half an hour of them . 
  once in a theme park when i stood in line , once on tv , and once when i looked them up from tvtropes . 
  / r/all/top / hourly or whatever, 
  it 's the other way around than that . 
  i 'm in the exact same boat as you , but i 've felt this way for a long while , ever since act 6 started .
