  i think it would be more fun if you replaced them roughly based on phonetics , rather than look :, 
  s -  \u03c3 ( \u03c2 at the ends of words ), 
  long o ( correct phoneme in rp for ancient greek ) -  \u03c9, 
  i \\* e , \\* i , \\* ie , y -  \u03b1\u03b9, 
  ( i defend my choice for epsilon as i and iota as e , since our usual pronunciation for i , [ \u026a ] , is way closer to the pronunciation of epsilon , [ \u03b5 ] , than the pronunciation of iota , [ i ] . 
  for e it 's split about fifty-fifty between [ \u03b5 ] and [ i ] , but between epsilon being a better match for i than iota , and [ i ] being the exact pronunciation of iota as well , and the letter itself having the name [ i ] , iota is the clear choice . ), 
  a lot of these only make sense for ancient greek , particularly eta and omega and part of beta , but then phi and chi only make sense for modern greek . 
  but artistic license is a thing . 
  it does n't have to be a 100 % correspondence . 
  just one that 's based on phonology than orthography . 
  brb , implementing this quirk in pesterchum . 
  are you a lisp brother ? 
  or the ; makes me think c-type . 
  but the nil parentheses beckon . 
  it 's like if roxy and jake had a baby ... 
  i 've always wondered : why do these textbooks show the electron pairs on oxygen ? 
  i mean , it 's 4 - ( number of bonds ) , which is usually 2 . 
  they do n't need to be so explicit . 
  thanks !, 
  hey , i 'm assuming , that you 've taken an ag class before . 
  how do you guys pronounce phi and chi ? 
  extra-aspirated p and k , or f and h / [ x ] ? 
  ( i take latin , and the aspirated pronunciation is obligatory . ), 
  damn . 
  me too . 
  so c-type . 
  that 's okay . 
  you can always join us if you like . 
  well , in many shells , commands run as root are prefixed by the shell with hash signs . 
  you have to `` log in '' as root to do that . 
  if you do n't feel like logging in to do things as root , you can run a single command as root by manually prefixing it with `` sudo '' . 
  you 'll have to type out the root password , though . 
  but the point is that if you 're root ( indicated by your commands getting prefixed with a hash sign ) , then you do n't need to type sudo , 'cause you 're already root . 
  i do n't get it , what is a `` space '' in coffee terms ? 
  no , for a shell . 
  like the unix shell . 
  it 's most commonly known from there . 
  oh my god . 
  i 've finally met one . 
  transfiguring antimatter is easier , though . 
  and it 's not like he would n't be able to deploy it without blowing himself up . 
  he has both magic and science at his disposal ; one easy way would be teleportation rings ( if they exist ) ; the explosion would destroy the ring on the other side . 
  or he could magically levitate it in a vacuum chamber . 
  finally , the first actual id on the page . 
  not that understanding that touching is very bad is not an important thing , but ten posts like that are not helpful . 
  why ca n't you transfigure matter into time-reversed matter ? 
  for that matter , why could n't harry make himself forget timeless physics , and transfigure antimatter thinking it 's another form of matter ? 
  actually , that would be a funny dichotomy for transfiguration if it worked . 
  antimatter is exclusive to not knowing timeless physics , and partial transfiguration is exclusive to knowing it . 
  but of course we do n't know whether that 's likely . 
  or more precisely , i 'm too tired to figure it out . 
  how do you know ? 
  it 's pretty hard to tell . 
  you 're thinking of the eszett , \u00df , from german . 
  that 's different . 
  i do n't know how the orthographies got so similar ( but you can look it up ) . 
  they might be related . 
  caf is really impressive , if that 's that . 
  i am stuck with cs4 . 
  yup . 
  well , then that is a problem . 
  but he could still transfigure it with a container . 
  it says that octopus is old and common , and that there 's no reason not to pluralize it the english way ( by adding - es ) . 
  because that 's what we do to english words . 
  dammit . 
  that person is now confused . 
  i hope the second person is happy . 
  this is the only version i 've ever seen . 
  i 've been wondering what the harlem shake is for a while ( not curious enough to check ) , and i think i have a pretty good idea now , beyond `` it 's a danec '' . 
  or maybe there are , and we 're all just quiet . 
  no that too, 
  blissymbols ? 
  or , `` this is not a chemical reaction , this is a physical reaction '' . 
  sure , but then chemical reactions are a subset of them still . 
  so then the complaint becomes `` this is a non-chemical physical reaction '' , which is 0 % better . 
  or any abjad . 
  same here !, 
  five fucking hours , too . 
  the `` word '' `` xd '' features more on this subreddit than , say , `` ship '' ? 
  what the hell . 
  i 'm a bit sad that discussion of a topic in addition discussion of reddit 's treatment of the topic is no longer encouraged . 
  i used to go here to discuss more controversial topics in a less one-sided way . 
  people here had interesting opinions that they were willing to argue . 
  i 'm not really interested in bashing reddit -- it 's sort of fun , but ultimately who really cares . 
  i 'm more concerned with the relatively small community providing a better environment for discussion . 
  i do n't really visit this sub anymore , since i do n't really have time , but it would be nice to discuss a topic once in a while , with a reddit thread as shared literature . 
  it 's fun and useful . 
  taking that away is sad . 
  oh well , maybe it 's for the better ; i 'm not sure how likely it is that i 'll find someone who does n't share my opinions , anymore . 
  yeah , i know . 
  she 's like a comb jelly , floating free in the e-water column . 
  brilliantly done . 
  where are all the men , though ? 
  damn , i was so sure that would be a real subreddit . 
  / r/microporn or something exists , though . 
  edit : yup, 
  i experienced the opposite last year in math class . 
  my teacher completely hated anything extracurricular , and made me do all my homework by hand in pencil . 
  and a whole lot of other things . 
  i really hated having her ; i had to be taken to a psychiatrist .
