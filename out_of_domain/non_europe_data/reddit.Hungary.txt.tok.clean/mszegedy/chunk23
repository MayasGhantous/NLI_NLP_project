  daves hare is a berd, 
  how did i not realize this ? 
  edit : what did seven people find wrong with this comment ? 
  i was merely likening the situation to that of the instance with the suddenly apparent avianness of dave 's hair on 4chan ... 
  it 's `` pastebin . '', 
  i was directed to mspa by xkcdsucks . 
  hussie was wrapping up problem sleuth back then ... specifically , it was at the traffic light particle accelerator bit inside the chicago overcoat . 
  that 's if your motherboard has more than one pcie slot ... xd i 've seen people get multiple pcie cards and try to install one or more in the extra pci slots . 
  you can turn this knowledge towards profit . 
  use an amd build for the mobo and processor , rather than comparatively expensive intel . 
  their tricore processors can be unlocked to quad-core with little risk ; you can get the athlon ii x3 3.3 ghz for $ 80 , which performs the same as a phenom x4 3.3 ghz . 
  you 'll need the cooler for it , though . 
  switching out the mobo ... due to my being on a phone , i have n't taken the initiative to see whether your hard drives need sata3 or not , so i have two proposals . 
  sata2 : [ asrock m3a770de ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-m3a770de ) . 
  my friend has this with the same processor , and it works excellently for him . 
  it 's also very cheap , at $ 65 . 
  sata3 : [ asrock 890fx deluxe4 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-890fxdeluxe4 ) . 
  this is $ 125 , and i personally have no experience with it , but it 's the closest i could find to the one you have , currently , and hey , the transfer rate is twice as fast !, 
  gee whiz , that 's way out of my price range !, 
  but that sounds pretty awesome . 
  i 'll definitely look this way when i have more money ... 
  good call , i 'll definitely do this . 
  the 6570 really seems to be the affordable one . 
  the other one is too expensive to consider , but i 'll wait to see if it goes on sale . 
  this probably does n't apply to you , but the local mediamarkt where i live stocks about five cases at a time , one microatx , three atx ( one mid tower and two full towers ) , and one ( invariably extremely heavy ) atx + , always a sight to behold . 
  the lesson i have learned from this is that it really does n't pay to try to acquire a good case from a store ; better just order one online , cheaper and better suited to your tastes . 
  holy fucking shit . 
  i want to move * in * here . 
  forget a boner , i just had an orgasm . 
  you lucky , * lucky * bastard . 
  i do n't want to overclock per se , but i have a tricore amd processor which is not going to stay tricore for very long . 
  thanks for the help besides , though !, 
  looks like i do n't need to actually spend that much money on this as i thought . 
  i have the same !, 
  but i do n't have antenn\u00e6 for it yet . 
  do i just walk into a radio shack ? 
  my current choice that i 'm definitely throwing out is $ 35 . 
  i think my upper limit is $ 45 or so . 
  very interesting , i play the gauss triangle myself . 
  try decrementing your dimensions , it should work . 
  that 's ... completely fine with us . 
  the heck ? 
  no , it 's `` lettucia '' . 
  you must be mistaking someone else for him ; he specifically stated that he * does n't * exist in the dimensions in which he gets drunk . 
  so , either that 's not him , or he 's more drunk than he thinks he is , and that m-theory wine is some cheap foreign knockoff . 
  it has n't aged enough . 
  all the wine i drink is einsteinian ; for more money you could get newtonian , but on real special occasions i get aristotlian champagne . 
  a real kicker , i tell ya . 
  thank you !, 
  my grandfather wants to put his inside large cabinet ( `` spajz '' in hungarian ) , and basically hide all the wires possible . 
  i was n't sure how this would impact everything else though , but i 'm sure that this would impact ventilation negatively ... 
  this is excellent . 
  blue fathoms ? 
  i fail to see how this is relev -- ohhh . 
  half of this we already knew , but the other half is indeed an interesting perspective to consider . 
  let us ponder, 
  naw , the hair, 
  aha , thank you , i was wondering . 
  it still seemed like a good way to shave off some money . 
  well , would my case qualify for an aftermarket cpu cooler ? 
  my fan is designed for a tricore processor , but i 'm just unlocking to quad-core ( the thing is 3.3 ghz ) . 
  what makes intel so much better , anyway ? 
  cutoff is ugly . 
  it 's possible , with a tiny bit of thinking ( unless the buttons somehow have `` float : bottom ; '' , which i do n't think exists ) , but that particular cutoff is worse looking than the one on the title model . 
  hurr durr its fake cuz the flag, 
  if this is you : it 's held up with wires , you dolt . 
  to be fair , developing space travel currently has no forseeable positive economic consequences , at least not ones that outweigh the costs . 
  it does , thank you !, 
  ... where do you live ? 
  it sounds half magical and half greedy as fuck . 
  and 90 % unsustainable . 
  i have heard this one somewhere ... 
  what , you expect him to hang around till the end of the universe and be * alive * ? 
  he 's basically * literally * dead . 
  hussie just rescued him from oblivion with his author powers . 
  this is what makes it nigh impossible for me to upvote or reply to you in alien blue, 
  if it were a second declension noun , then it would be `` lusi '' , not `` lusii '' . 
  but it 's fourth declension , so it 's `` lusus '' . 
  the difference is that the second u is long in the plural . 
  it 's visible if you use longmarks : `` lus\u016bs '' as opposed to `` lusus '' . 
  i said `` forseeable '' . 
  that 's such a long way off as to be considered negligible . 
  whee , thank you for the formatification !, 
  i 'd definitely switch the hard drive for an ssd , though . 
  we primarily chose the mobo because it has the thusly-named `` realtek alc892 7.1-channel audio codec '' . 
  i realize that this does n't mean particularly much , as every motherboard has onboard audio , but the whole setup seems very modern , what with it being full of sata3 's and such . 
  the whole thing is coming out of his pension , and , being a ( retired ) musician ( and ceo ) , he wants the best possible hardware for audio ( excluding the elemental part of speakers ) . 
  brilliant and sane . 
  we want to purchase the case on this side of , uh , europe , though , from some random store ( mediamarkt ? 
  ) , as well as the psu , though , the latter of which i have mentioned . 
  o , and the monitor as well , heh . 
  alien blue as well ; it displays all the links in the posts in neat rows , as well as what part of the text was assigned to it . 
  but maybe not literally beets , but ... 
  * beats ? 
  * the next minecraft update will clearly have more music in it !, 
  you 're technically right ; `` do '' is accidentally written as `` to '' . 
  that does n't make you any less of a jackass , though . 
  i would have been the last person to notice this . 
  `` minceraft '' seems much more natural a word to me than `` minecraft '' , which i have always read as [ minec ] + [ raft ] . 
  good job on exploiting this !,
