  ( my younger cousin goes to school in nj , and we 're constantly jealous of the people from there . 
  my family tree in general is too poor to pay to relocate them near hth and then pay for it too . ), 
  i will be looking nnj up and seriously considering it as an option , thanks to you , although i wo n't be involved in the final decision . 
  your principal should give you a gold star for advertising . 
  makes me wonder how many famous people i 've brushed past at the airport in the past literal two hundred times i 've had to use it . 
  i ca n't think of a single face that i would recognize , except hitler who is dead . 
  wait , huh ? 
  if you do n't own a digital camera , what do you use to take serious pictures ? 
  i 've seen pictures of him without it ; i would .

  i 've seen a car in new jersey with a license plate that read `` susy '' before . 
  i 'm not 100 % confident that they were referring to supersymmetry , thought . 
  everyone 's heard this one ten times before . 
  what 's the purpose of saying it again ? 
  \\ # 4 is terrible , but the sheer magnitude of how terrible it is makes it kind of funny . 
  # 6 is old and was only funny when i was in first grade . 
  # 7 is so bad that i think you would have to have a very unique mind to come up with it . 
  # 10 sounds clever , but really is n't . 
  they forgot to credit zach weiner for # 15 . 
  # 16 is made slightly more annoying by the existence of the fresnel integral functions . 
  # 20 takes second place for most terrible , after # 7 . 
  i like the relative subtlety of # 21 . 
  # 23 should be replaced with a cow . 
  # 25 would have been mildly funny if they had bothered to write out d/dx on the correct side of e ^ ( x ) . 
  and the best kind of navy recruitment , superluminal . 
  that 's probably the idea . 
  institutional discrimination , sort of . 
  meanwhile , mrcheeze and i laugh at you non-godel-escher-bach-having-read plebians . 
  personally , i like randall munroe 's interpreration of hofstadter : i 'm so meta , even this acronym . 
  why , is n't there another , more minor institution with their own pope ? 
  well , if they lose an arm , they 'll know where to look to buy a new one . 
  some of these are not homophobic at all . 
  `` i 'm so gay for [ actor/singer/comedian / male model ] '' , for example . 
  but ca n't they just be clarifying , since the sexuality of a person is usually unclear , and it 's rude to ask , and sometimes it changes , and some people hide it anyway , so all anyone can do is make guesses , which might be incorrect ? 
  i 'm not promoting usage of the term in general , i 'm just saying that this seems like a large enough category of situations in which it could reasonably be used . 
  no clue whether it actually is , or whether people actually use it that way . 
  `` i 'm not jewish , but i celebrate passover , yom kippur , and chanukah . '', 
  and * gnostic * christians at that , whose views diverged a lot from any of the christianity we know today . 
  sure !, 
  you can actually use a backslash to escape the bracket .

  edit : huh , why i never . 
  i could have sworn and everything . 
  this album was a bit too short and atonal for my tastes . 
  how am i going to subsist on this for the next three months ? 
  ; - ; but what the hell , it 's great music . 
  thumbs up !, 
  pi r squared , and the periodicity of the tangent !, 
  but really , i agree with you . 
  just because * someone * a few thousand years ago preferred to think in terms of the diameter , not the radius , now we 're stuck with dumb formulas like 2 pi r and s f ( x ) e ^ ( -2 pi i theta x ) dx and so forth . 
  though i think tau was n't the best choice for the doubled constant , since it looks so much like t . but i guess you ca n't have everything . 
  there were n't any other letters they could really have claimed . 
  you comb through / r/all/new and that 's how you found this post , right ? 
  yeah , the cherub relationship is recursive enough that it seems that there is less difference between a snake biting its own tail and two snakes biting each others ' tails than might be worth distinguishing between . 
  why would it run counter to the themes of the story ? 
  does `` power fantasy '' sound like `` chronology '' from * lofam 2 * on purpose ? 
  i never read it ; i 've just always thought it was stupid that we use pi instead of tau . 
  something something phony god 's blessing . 
  i 'm going to travel back in time , and make `` plutonium '' slang for `` penis '' . 
  not because of your comment , but because maybe it will prevent the cold war . 
  imagine : `` we need more plutonium bombs ... okay , that sounds ridiculous . '', 
  man , mine just came in the mail yesterday . 
  i never thought to post it here . 
  are you using this with a laptop , or a desktop ? 
  some laptops ( lenovo thinkpad ) come with extra slots for these . 
  nothing else fits in the slot ( actually , i think wwan does too ) , so why not put a hard drive hard drive there ? 
  hmm , the msata drive in my laptop is also a wwan slot ; you ca n't do both simultaneously . 
  once the laptop arrives in the mail , i 'll see how it 's set up . 
  no , sometimes they do . 
  sometimes this bot does , especially . 
  if it 's a container , put it * inside * ... oh wait , that still does n't work . 
  hey guys , i think this guy was using insincerity to make a point about a topic . 
  no need to downvote him . 
  i ca n't make a head or tail of this picture . 
  there are a lot of parallel lines , plus a thing on the right that looks broken , that 's all i know . 
  can someone explain this to me ? 
  do n't you get it ? 
  you need at least three charms for a trove . 
  anything less is degenerate and unstable . 
  and clubs deuce is a carapacian , not a leprechaun . 
  which means that there are now 2 ^ 9 = 512 different ways to ship people ( i am assuming troll romance is included within leprechaun romance , like human romance is included within troll romance ; if not , then there 's 515 + log-base-2 ( 3 ) ways to ship two people ) . 
  say homestuck has 150 characters , then naively there 's about 150 ^ ( 2 ) * 512 ships for two people . 
  which is 11520000 ( eleven million , five hundred and twenty thousand ) .
