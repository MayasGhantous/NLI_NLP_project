  why is this getting frontpaged ? 
  this is nearly the only guide to x64 assembly there * is * . 
  anyone interested in learning x64 assembly would have already searched it up and found it . 
  i never got anything !, 
  and i 've been here longer that * both of you !, 
  * ( my moderation application was really pathetic-looking , though . 
  i wish i had time to revise it . ), 
  what if he stuck his head through ? 
  would he gain knowledge of all of homestuck at once ? 
  you lazy bastard . 
  you ca n't just take the sidebar image and repost it . 
  [ that has got to be the literally most karma-grabbing thing anyone has ever done .

  it looks like a cross between a seal and a sloth , but tiny .

  also * chill . 
  yess , you just reminded me that i am finally capable of playing team fortress with my new computer . 
  i 've already downloaded it . 
  i am going to * play * this . 
  you have to think creatively for that , though . 
  i would n't have thought of it . 
  ( though , i 've hardly seen one . 
  held one once . 
  dropped it on my foot , broke my big toe . 
  besides that , though , played one once or twice . ), 
  i once dropped an xbox on foot , and broke my big toe . 
  john 's in that panel . 
  how the hell can the felt bleed so much when they 're fucking * puppets ? 
  what i mean is , made of felt . 
  they 're plush . 
  but xrange is a generator , is n't it ? 
  i 'm uncomfortable with generators . 
  but , they did n't just go , `` hey , i 'll be a dick and abuse the workers that helped that woman ! '', 
  they had some sort of internal reason for it . 
  what was it ? 
  but `` just dicks '' is n't an answer . 
  people are n't naturally predisposed to go and be mean to people that obviously did a good thing , and there 's no `` dickishness syndrome '' that makes people act mean to other people just for the sake of it ( unless their mental functioning was severely altered at that moment , but we can ignore that possibility , because what 's the chance that a significant portion of them were like that ? ) . 
  so either something made them hate good acts on principle ( very unlikely ) or they do n't view it as a good act ( also very unlikely ) or something else ( also very unlikely , i just do n't see how anyone could do it in the first place ) . 
  what happened ? 
   you could be plugging a data-transfer cable into life and be transferring data back and forth between yourself and the universe . 
  this definitely makes sense , as that link is almost completely severed while sleeping , and disconnecting it would let you rest . 
  alas , i never upgraded from ide/pata . 
  how did it come to be that the majority of goggles users are homestuck fans ? 
  in most european languages , it 's `` julia '' , not `` juliet '' . 
  exoate was probably foreign or bilingual . 
  what do undergrads see in jetpacks ? 
  they 're impractical . 
  nanopure , maybe ?

  how is this relevant to the previous comment ? 
  what 's wrong with feferi ? 
  ( we all know what 's wrong with eridan . ), 
  also , they 're magical . 
  q : how is that better than peer-reviewed science ? 
  a : it is n't , it 's worse . 
  i appreciate what the mythbusters are doing , and i appreciate the widespread respect for them , but their experimentation has nothing on actual research . 
  three . 
  i 'll invite you afterwards if you want . 
  [ that is totally not what radioactive waste looks like . 
  ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0022311507001900 ) ( look at figure 1 , that is totally not a green emission spectrum . 
  and besides the emissions , the only other color the waste would have is silver . ), 
  you 're looking at it very too closely . 
  also , you turn grain into flour , not bread . 
  i offer a revised version :, 
   there is so much grain in that picture, 
   that you could make flour with it, 
  actually , nowadays they do n't really . 
  or if they do , it 's with variety . 
  it 's surprising . 
  i 'm just trying to make it funnier . 
  that 's more skillful than anyone i 've ever asked to investigate something . 
  they do n't even think to google , or analyze the evidence at hand . 
  nice people and all , but ca n't research their way out of a paper bag . 
  probably because we know . 
  ( although i personally left your comment alone . ), 
  \\* shrug \\* i do n't really notice them , i guess . 
  but it even * looked like * `` of course '' , obfuscating the joke . 
   peel off like rotten fruit, 
  i do n't understand . 
  well ... you 're commenting in it , are n't you ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  it has to do with the fact that british people are supposed to drink tea , right ? 
  but think about it .
