  i 'll believe that , but who does n't hear about dropbox and `` the cloud '' ? 
  and who , upon hearing about it , does n't immediately think , `` wow , that sounds really useful for me , since hitherto my data has been stored on these hard disks that i know break every half a decade or so !, 
  finally somewhere secure to store data ! '', 
  especially if you 're storing data you may want to keep for the long term , i.e. 
  longer than the average hard drive lifespan . 
  it 's not * extremely * hard to believe that someone would n't make the connection , but these are grad students -- intelligent and accomplished people . 
  that 's what makes it the most hard to swallow . 
  the fries have always been too big for me to eat . 
  i try to get small as often as possible ( some places actually do n't sell small , i ca n't believe it ) but sometimes i still ca n't finish them . 
  it 's infuriating . 
  i think it 's the salt . 
  it has pros and cons . 
  i have n't found a way to integrate google drive into your file manager/filesystem like dropbox does so easily , but google drive is more streamlined , linked up to your google account , and offers free collaborative editing through google docs . 
  i do n't know about storage space . 
  larger organizations might prefer drive for their employees because they base their employee accounts in google , so it 's under the same identity as their company emails . 
  my neice 's school uses drive for the kids . 
  but who would practice skepticism on a darn quote ? 
  your priorities are skewed if you 're checking behind every quote for a fake . 
  one of the key points of rationality is to evaluate ideas for themselves , independent of who said them or why . 
  facts are a different matter , but quotes are n't about facts ( mostly , anyway ; if a quote contained information aside from ideas , i 'd be wary ) . 
  i 'd say they 're doing the `` thinking for themselves '' part right -- at least , the ones that do n't use it to extrapolate ridiculous things about other people . 
  that 's the opposite of rationality . 
  wait , they laugh at people who mistake quotes ? 
  that changes everything . 
  i do n't care if you submit the best post ever . 
  if it 's from 9gag , it was written by hitler himself , so it 's terrible . 
  r = 1.2 + | sin ( ( 5/3 ) \u03b8 ) |, 
  thoughts ? 
  you can also vary by giving the sine expression a coefficient , making it `` spikier '' . 
  but yeah , eleven-fold symmetry looks great , thanks !, 
  now , how would one go about proving that this is an epicycloid ? 
  i 'm pretty suspicious . 
  i do n't know whether those were the same redditors . 
  and now the ones who get off on feeling smart and also avoided the hunt have something to feel smart about !, 
  your post works against your wishes !, 
  are you really going to make judgments about persistent characteristics of a person just from momentary interactions with them ? 
  why would anything you observed in less than a second be indicative of their overall behavior ? 
  what kind of sample size is * one comment ? 
  * look , this is n't your fault ; it 's a heuristic that seems to exist in all of us , until we notice it and realize that it 's bad . 
  and it 's really bad !, 
  it creates a lot of undue bad feeling between otherwise happy people . 
  if i had to pick the one heuristic that causes cognitive bias that i hate the most , it would be this one . 
  poof , stress and discord out of nowhere !, 
  i ca n't blame you , but please really be aware of how dumb making snap judgments about people is !, 
  / psa, 
  except with more economic and political stability and unity , and less social problems . 
  also populated mostly by the super buff . 
  those would still occur . 
  history is greater than individual people . 
  ideas persist very handily without it mattering who specifically has them . 
  [ eksb\u028aks ] , i 'd think . 
  who it the * world * would get surgery to destroy their eyesight ? 
  too late . 
  english is a language that changes over time , naturally . 
  you ca n't stop it , so you should n't get derisive about it either .

  people who are introspective nearly all the time can still be cunts . 
  i 'm empirical proof . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  not accusing you or anything , but that label is displayed so prominently that i ca n't help but think that there 's at least a 5 % , if not 20 % chance that you 're one of those shills . 
  he just shaved . 
  i can create discrete , cyclic transitions between different numbers of notches , i can create rotations , i can morph the epitrochoid 's notches to be looped , spiky , or flat , i can scale the spirograph , and i can scale the size of the inner circle without affecting the number of notches . 
  do you think that 's enough to create a mathematically pure animation ? 
  w | a does n't output any files for non-premium plebs , as far as i know . 
  maybe i should do it in python/scipy . 
  if there 's a way it can output gif animations like that . 
  or you can describe certain well-known metabolic pathways , like glycolysis or the dark reactions . 
  um , not to sound condescending , but who * does n't * understand thermionic delta * anything ? 
  * people make it out to be so counter-intuitive , but i 've never met anyone who 's bothered to learn anything about it who had any trouble understanding it . 
  i hate the sense of elitism surrounding the subject .
