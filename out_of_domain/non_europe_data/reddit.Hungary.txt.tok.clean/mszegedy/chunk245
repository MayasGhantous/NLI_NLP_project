  poor australia . 
  that movie is the most exciting depiction of field linguistics i 've ever seen . 
  [ holy shit , you 're right . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=jacques+noir&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45645796,d.dmg&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=807&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=hid7ucpbeyma0qhqqydibg ), 
  i 'm prepared for an opposing opinion , but i enjoyed atlantis more . 
  i do n't know why ; stargate was much better put together , and had interesting direction decisions . 
  but the game is only acting as motivation and translating material . 
  it 's not actually teaching you the language directly . 
  there are plenty of sources of motivation for learning a language . 
  i see no reason not to add one to the pile , but it 's not that impressive or necessary . 
  what would be cool , fun to make , and very helpful is a game that really did teach you the language directly . 
  i do n't mean a * mario teaches typing * kind of game , though , since you might as well just have a language book then , but a gta type game that happens to include a large cast of non-english-speaking characters , and is littered with ways to find out how to communicate with them . 
  actually , you could make that most of the game . 
  you could look for documents that describe different grammatical aspects of the language ( i do n't mean the `` simple , progressive , prospective , continuous , perfect , etc. '', 
  kind of aspect , but grammar rules and such ) , and you could pick up vocabulary individually , and occasionally in large lists that allow you to decode a whole conversation . 
  that would be more original and useful . 
  i pay by computational power . 
  `` gadgets '' and other mobile devices , capable of accessing the internet , taking pictures , and running tiny apps , should cost $ 200 - $ 300 . 
  low-end computers , capable of browsing the internet , running gvim , compiling/interpreting code , and running simpler programs should cost $ 400 - $ 800 . 
  high-end computers , capable of low-end stuff as well as holding more and being able to run intensive 3d games and processing large amounts of things at once , should cost $ 1000 + . 
  the glasses fall squarely in the first category . 
  have you ever taken calculus ? 
  your questions will be answered . 
  refuted :, 
  - / r/badtaxidrivers, 
  - / r/sororicide, 
  - / r/zqfmgb, 
  i ca n't fathom why . 
  okay . 
  do we think this strategy works ? 
  ( honest question ), 
  the idea of calculus is that you 're supposed to start intuitively understanding the jump from `` getting closer '' to `` infinitely close '' . 
  once you 've taken the limit , you 're not just gotten * extremely close * , but you 're * there * through the context of the rest of the function . 
  it 's an actual value you get for that point on the function by looking at the context of the point rather than being there . 
  you 're thinking of grad school . 
  gaelic is a celtic language , not a romance language . 
  or / r/scientificmethod, 
  why ? 
  it 's possible to do it safely . 
  i 've lit beer bottle fires using a wick . 
  also soaked very long wicks in vodka and lit them on the pavement . 
  i did n't get burnt . 
  playing with graphing calculator ( the pacific tech one ) on my mother 's laptop . 
   a third of the population deserted the country [ after wwi ], 
  the borders of the country were resized so as not to include them . 
  nobody moved anywhere . 
  adding '' [ fixed ] '' is already covered under `` title '' , genius . 
  do you know japanese ? 
  biologist here . 
  wolves are not simple . 
  reminds me of that famous sign that says `` no dogs or chinese allowed . '', 
  well , that 's not exactly what it said , but it 's the idea . 
  * because it was a run-on sentence with multiple nested clauses , and also pointless, 
  i made one of these , out of each golf club head i have sawn off of my teeist enemies ' gear . 
  i try to add a new one each week or so . 
  stupid teeists , they always leave it in the corner in room 106 . 
  maybe you and i have different interpretations of `` faggot '' . 
  i thought it was a term for a man who is attracted to other men , rather than one who is ass-fucked by other men . 
  oh man , when i saw that fireworm , i cringed . 
  and then they had a moray right after !, 
  my two biggest follies relating to sea creatures are accidentally stepping on a fireworm ( a huge one , about a quarter meter with large spines ) , and getting bitten by a moray eel on my hand ( i had a thick glove and sharp knife ) . 
  my lesser follies are stabbing myself with a perch , grabbing a stinging sea anemone ( it did n't make it ) , and punching an octopus ( it made it ) , all on accident . 
  this video did much to remind me of those guys !, 
  it was so nice seeing those sea creatures being sea creatures , without me interfering . 
  that 's why i 'm moving to sweden . 
  absolutely no discrimination in any way there . 
  woops , you said the trigger words . 
  how about you go grow a pair of eyes ? 
  everyone in that picture but the priest is acting like a fucking * animal . 
  * where do you see any right-wing ideals in him ? 
  where do you see any peace and love in those activists ? 
  i 've never seen this level of pattern-matching without actually absorbing any further information . 
  either that or you meant to post this to / r/circlejerk . 
  sorry to tell you , but unfortunately i do n't think they allow any image posts anymore . 
  or because niceness . 
  ( the / s means sarcasm ; sweden is known both for its sometimes horrifying racism and its reverence on reddit ), 
  i figured the reader would notice that there 's * something * there , and curiously attempt to find out what it is . 
  i guess it 's easy to miss even so . 
  how is he not stabbing himself on that carp a lot ? 
  even if it 's dead , the fins are spiny and the carp is heavy , is n't that the case ? 
  it 's definitely hebrew . 
  it 's full of hebrew characters , even if it 's not strictly cursive . 
  it even has telltale vowel markers . 
  whoever wrote it has interesting handwriting , but it 's hebrew . 
  does discussing an issue become bad just because it 's on the internet ? 
  i ca n't see why . 
  maybe some people * like * having their beliefs challenged ? 
  i have a remote with labeled buttons . 
  there are even different buttons for different fan speeds . 
  huh , i did n't even notice . 
  and i had no idea it was permanent . 
  edit : also , for people bamboozled by the medical terminology : they put bendy spring things in the fallopian tubes , blocking the eggs from coming down . 
  i wonder whether this increases one 's risk for ectopic pregnancy ? 
  uggghhh i shiver just thinking about it, 
  edit 2 : wait , they 'd need sperm for that . 
  never mind . 
  i guess it also blocks the speem then , huh ? 
  well , you could always join me in finding a solution for death . 
  me and all my other biomedical engineering buddies . 
  ( i always tell people i 'm a biologist , to simplify things .
