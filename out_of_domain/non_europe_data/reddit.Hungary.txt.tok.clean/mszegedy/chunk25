  but these will be 5th graders , at a 30-minute workshop , and i 'm not sure on the logistics yet . 
  we only have one desktop computer , and it 's an emachine . 
  ideally , they 'd sit at desks in pairs while i call out instructions , but they have nothing to work with . 
  yes , i nearly lost a hard drive this way . 
  it has since died of a misplaced head , but it took a couple three-hour rounds of diskwarrior before it was working again . 
  by \\* not * doing this . 
  no , he just downvoted you three times . 
  the rest was added manually . 
  intermission 2 : an entire flash, 
  [ are you up to speed on the laws of physics ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newton's_laws_of_motion#newton.27s_first_law ), 
  holy shit, 
  it does n't show up for me . 
  where should i look , again ? 
   harry potter and the chamber of secrets, 
  ftfy, 
  from a guy named `` jesuspoopstoo '' ... 
  i would n't bet on it . 
  i `` d pay money for this, 
  someone fucking ban this guy , this is getting old . 
  no he hacked, 
  no fiuc fyou, 
  holy * shit * . 
  i would buy the hell out of this . 
  they spent so much time and money dying those cables blue and orange at the factory ... only to make the whole scene look like something out of portal 2 . 
  when i first heard it , i thought it was `` abbadee , abbadye '' , but then someone told me that they were actual words , and i spent ages trying to figure out what they were supposed to be . 
  then , hello , internet !, 
  but , an ssd has much , much less storage . 
  and i * am * a cheap man . 
  :p ( also this is irrelevant , but i 'm partitioning the hard drive and putting ubuntu in the smaller piece . ), 
  i 'd say the power supply is more like a fridge that provides the sustenance , not * is * the sustenance . 
  if there 's nothing limiting you , what 's stopping you from building an empire ? 
  i do n't hate anyone . 
  like , literally , anyone . 
  i find it impossible . 
  and , before you ask , no , i have never had a conversation with hitler . 
  this one narrowly lost to the [ logisys communion ] ( http://www.xoxide.com/logisys-communion-case.html ) , which has a psu as well . 
  it 's unsuitable if you want to stuff it full of fans , of course , but i 'm not interested in high-power computing , so i 'm sold on this one . 
  if i had a bit more money i 'd buy the [ nzxt m59 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/nzxt-case-m59001bk ) , which has five fans , but less drive bays . 
  still an awesome price here , though . 
  or maybe i 'd get one of the [ apevia xdreamer 3 's ] ( http://www.xoxide.com/apevia-xdreamer3-black.html ) , for ten dollars cheaper but with a color choice and retaining the lcd readout . 
  only 3 fans , though . 
  this is a story that may make people become interested in dwarf fortress . 
  [ corntext ] ( http://youtu.be/ohg5sjyrha0 ), 
  ahpy cakae day, 
  every time * i * have said this , downvotes . 
  i 'd say it 's literally like this . 
  thank you !, 
  everyone 's so nice on this subreddit ... 
  i concur , as an upvote is n't enough to voice my opinion strongly enough . 
  upvpt 'd, 
  u ile hterns no sutch way to gte brick orc aly in superfalt,

  ur doin it worgn, 
  it seems that i 'm one of the only people who does n't fit either end , as i only do some very basic programming on this thing , some light gameplay ( my 144mb video card ca n't handle much more anyway ) , and lots of writing in word and some in powerpoint . 
  [ it 's all good though , as i 'm building a much improved pc . 
  ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/5drk ) it 's still nice to have a well-integrated laptop though . 
  i like the interface a lot . 
  well , what he means by that it `` works and gets the job done '' is that no matter what he wants to do on it , he knows his computer will be capable , scaling with the price gradient anyway ( like , if you buy one of the lower-rung laptops , it 'll obviously only be good for less intensive stuff ) . 
  a gigaflop ( s ) is a billion ** fl ** oating point ** o ** perations ** p ** er ** s ** econd , one of the myriad ways of quantifying processor strength . 
  i love the comparison . 
  this is of course only suitable for a certain lifestyle , but as a person who was on his fourth us passport by age 15 , i fully approve . 
  mine is \\* bit * more rugged than your suggestion , but also complies with pretty much all countries ' airport baggage regulations ( thus , really little water ) , and contains my spare spare passport ( my german one ; my us passport is my spare one , and my hungarian passport is my main one : eurozone for the win !, 
  interestingly enough , in the books , he had a beard ... anyone willing to retexture ? 
  wow . 
  seriously , if i had an unlimited supply of money , then i 'd build this . 
  except i 'd get a wireless keyboard , 16gb of ram , a case with a gigantic window , windows 7 ultimate , and a blu-ray player . 
  with more monitors , naturally . 
  but besides that : holy shit this is perfect . 
  i prefer to just play foldit . 
  i see, 
  what u did there, 
  thanks !, 
  fun ? 
  probably true, 
  my last two threads here got no responses . 
  one of them was actually about cooling , but just with a damn fan . 
  it 's a really fantastic site , i agree . 
  the folks at [ / r/buildapc ] ( / r/buildapc ) love it . 
  i live in suburban new jersey , about an hour 's drive from sandy hook . 
  the nearest quarry is about thirty minutes away . 
  obviously you 've only seen the jersey turnpike . 
  it 's quite nice here [ ( google street view pic of the house of my first friend that consented ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xtxoj.png ) . 
  we use kris kristie 's fat ass for heating . 
  a valid interpretation ... 
  it 's been proven to not actually improve temperature or performance . 
  i prefer something with a payoff ( the payoff here is that it 's unique and saves energy ) . 
  i have achieved similar results with a microscope . 
  it 's not easy , but if you 've never done it before , it only takes a minute or so to find that sweet spot . 
  when i did this with a microscope , i also had to hold it there long enough for the brightness to adjust , which lengthened it to about five minutes . 
  but in his case , i doubt that this was necessary , so i do n't think it was too hard . 
  actually , yes , but shut up . 
  yeah , eridan gets godtier . 
  how are n't you there yet ? 
  i 've always liked that story about magic . 
  i fully expected you to link to it . 
  my dad 's a tenured professor , i stay away as far away from facebook as possible, 
  this is not a pity upvote, 
  i swear that this has been posted here at least twice already . 
  was it just my imagination ?
