  your face ? 
  why would they want that ? 
  do n't worry , you can still go to :, 
  - / r/circlejerk, 
  - / r/circlebroke, 
  - / r/circlebroke2, 
  to complain about it . 
  - i do n't understand the `` work '' one . 
  - i do n't think the `` bill '' one is true . 
  no , i 've only posted there for the first time today because i was following around / u/memebot _ 5000 to set it off . 
  circlebroke ? 
  no , i 've only popped in today , after making this comment , 'cause i wanted to see how things were going . 
  i used to , but it was only for a short while . 
  circlejerk ? 
  you 're on to something there , but that was a long while ago . 
  i have n't posted there in months . 
  it 's outdated , and a `` first draft '' of calculus , and has really bad notation . 
  back then , in order for any mathematics idea to be accepted , you had to prove all of your theories the euclidean way , i.e. 
  with a ruler and compass . 
  newton wasted a whole lot of time with that . 
  the presentation sucks , too . 
  the audience he was writing for was a bunch of 17th-century latin-obsessed self-important skeptics . 
  you 're a modern english-speaking guy who wants to actually understand calculus . 
  you do n't fit . 
  then you 'd have to have precise kerning as well , lest it look like `` cum '', 
  [ d\u03b5kim\u0251\u02d0tio\u02d0 ] , if you know how to read ipa . 
  our notation was invented by leibniz , who invented calculus just four years or so after newton did . 
  i audibly cried out loud , `` fuck ! '', 
  i am so sorry for you . 
  it 's a [ blue button ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porpita_porpita ) . 
  i used to find these guys all the time in new zealand . 
  it 's related to the [ sea raft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velella_velella ) and , believe it or not , the [ portuguese man o ' war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physalia_physalis ) . 
  that 's harder than trying to actually fix it . 
  you ca n't expect people to be 100 % consistent across every time they have to make the decision , so you have to put a `` usually '' in there to cover the cases where people make a decision that they do n't make as often as the one that they make the most often . 
  holy shit . 
  you are the one true * messiah * of reddit . 
  i 've been waiting for you for my whole loaf . 
  as a python interpreter and nes and snes emulator ( with zsnes ) . 
  i 've installed ubuntu on it as an operating system , with openbox as a desktop ( i 've purged ubuntu-desktop ) . 
  ( no , my ob setup does n't have any panels . 
  yes , i like it that way . ), 
  i develop a game in python on it , which can be played aside from the nes and snes ones . 
  i 'm looking to do more with pi , but i ca n't really think of anything i really need a small computer for ; all of my professional research is microscopic , and i 'm not really curious about anything else that would merit it to actually build a robot that runs raspberry pi . 
  usually i go with arduino instead . 
  edit : i 've also considered getting a second one to convert my personal microscope to be fully electronic ( no pun intended , believe me ) , but it 's not worth it , even for the great pictures . 
  there 's not much you can put under a light microscope worth seeing that you 're not already looking at in the lab . 
  brilliant . 
  i should add that functionality to mine . 
  ahahahaha , i could ( n't ) use that . 
  a plane flies overhead here every five minutes or so . 
  soooooooo not worth it . 
  that looks * really not good for his back . 
  this is completely inaccurate in every way , though . 
  freshwater on earth does n't follow even close to a queue pattern . 
  that 's okay , i 've just finished building my own engine for 2d and i 'm quite happy with it . 
  unfortunately mine is not quite as cinematic : the player contracts , as opposed to the world ; you see things from the static world 's reference frame . 
  however , the game that i am developing it for is a metroidvania , so it 's a much more practical solution . 
  i 'll show you the code once i 've ironed out the ( numerous ) bugs . 
  i 'm still debugging , but i 'd be happy to release the engine once i 'm finished making things not break . 
  - the engine is n't built specifically for relativity ; it 's more general than that . 
  it allows me to play around with physics to a reasonable degree . 
  tweaking the reference frame would be not actually very difficult , but would look ugly because i 'd somehow have to coax pygame to do shearing and because the world is n't loaded outside a relatively small space around the player , so it would n't be able to render much . 
  what the engine is better at is having relativistic physics in one area , and classical physics in the next . 
  ( smooth transitions have yet to be handled . 
  i 'll probably just put buffer areas between them gradual enough that no problems occur . ), 
  - lorentz contraction is handled by scaling the image of a sprite by the inverse lorentz factor for their velocity in each direction ( alas , pygame does not allow me to shear anything ; i might solve that somehow later on , perhaps with mipmapping if i 'm desperate ) . 
  other stuff is handled in a sort-of-more-sophisticated manner that basically still depends only on the lorentz factor . 
  once i 've ironed everything out i 'll show you the code and you can judge for yourself , but i do n't think it 's too sophisticated . 
  - i would n't know any other way than to handle acceleration !, 
  because of that , what i 'm doing right now is converting the player movement from being velocity-based ( going left or right adds a constant amount to your x velocity , jumping adds a one-time constant to your y velocity ) to being force-based ( you accelerate over time left or right to a top speed , and decelerate over time when you 're not holding down any directions ; jumping is basically unchanged except now a force is added to the total forces acting on you instead of a velocity to your personal velocity ) . 
  in summary , it 's more `` relatively simplistic '' than `` relativistic '' , but it has lorentz contraction and fake four-velocity , although it does n't support time dilation just yet ( i plan to have it do so ) . 
  this is only for a particular reference frame , but i 'm still super proud and hope it will still serve my purpose ( give one intuition for special relativity ) . 
  i 'd 've called it `` invlorentz '' . 
  if you say `` gamma '' , it 's slightly less obvious what it is . 
  unfortunately , due to df 's questionable physics , only standing water will put its flame out ; any running water will turn into hot mist . 
  a * meter . 
  * \\* whistle \\* that 's still very huge . 
  i will watch out . 
  we 've all heard of lampreys ( since they are jawless fish ) and naked mole rats ( rufus ) , and i knew a few besides ( star-nosed mole , owing to a book i had as a child , and the yeti crab because i own * the deep * and have seen everything in it like 10 times ) , but this is much more surprisingly obscure than i thought it would be !, 
  and it leaves a question unanswered , too : is the tanuki a dog ? 
  edit : also you 've already heard of fossa if you 've seen * madagascar * . 
  oh , right . 
  thank you !, 
  for some reason i keep underrating the law of conservation of momentum . 
  i ca n't believe i just did that again . 
  ( although , this does n't exactly give me an equation for relativistic drag outright . 
  but deriving it is the fun part , is n't it ? ), 
  i love the idea . 
  i never ca n't decide , so i would fit in perfectly as one who helps out . 
  this happens even if light speed is extremely low ( say , 5 kph ) ? 
  are n't all relevant equations parametrized by c , allowing c to be varied ? 
  i thought it would be a more interesting/comprehensive/in-depth article . 
  i was expecting something like [ what maguire et al did ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/4398.long ) in 1999 . 
  i 'm sure we 'll see something like that someday . 
  hmm . 
  last time bloom filters were mentioned here , i commented on how funny it was that sometimes adding more of something * does * work , in this case hash functions . 
  however , people misunderstood me as criticizing bloom filters , and got very mad at me . 
  i really like this `` opposite bloom filter '' implementation , even if it is n't really strictly that . 
  since i do n't manage large amounts of data , though , i do n't see how i could make use of it . 
  still , i 'll keep it around .
