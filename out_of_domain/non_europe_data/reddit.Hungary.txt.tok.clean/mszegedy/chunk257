  how do you know he 's not lying and actually testing for something else ? 
  anyway , as a guy with a background in computer science and quantum computation , but professionally a biomedical engineer , i once scoffed at the idea of the brain as having quantum computational components . 
  the suggestion had come from a linguist , anyway ( who * are * good at psychology ) . 
  i mean , what evidence is there whatsoever for that ? 
  but if we can pin down the number of steps it takes to perform a computation in the brain , and establish a lower bound on the big o for it computed in parallel , then we can actually rule out the possibility , and make us certain that we 're not missing anything . 
  autistic savants are perfect for testing these things against . 
  prime checking is unideal for this , since an abstract neural network could theoretically do it in o ( 1 ) / neuron time given enough neurons ( one neuron for each possible prime factor , and just do the modulus and pipe all of them to a single neuron that ands them together ) . 
  there 's ways to establish realistic bounds on this for the human brain , but it 's probably easier to just test a different problem . 
  hmm . 
  * can * we pin it down ? 
  that would be really hard . 
  they 're dimensionless . 
  personalities ? 
  that 's hardly anything you can determine from a picture !, 
  you can see how they dress and that 's it . 
  and taste in dress does n't indicate personality well enough that you can make an accurate nudgement . 
  ( and facial expression is 100 % irrelevant . ), 
  my reason is that they 're impossible to get off and they ruin the car 's aesthetic . 
  more like shade of mirror . 
  i 'd rather just have beautiful pictures . 
  for a good estimate , you should also provide :, 
  - an alphabetical handwriting sample, 
  - a sum of how many courses you 've taken that required written homework each night, 
  - how many of these were number-based vs letter-based ( subtle : a calculus course would be letter-based , and a precalculus course would be number-based ), 
  - a sum of how many courses you 've taken that required in-class essays periodically, 
  then , i 'll figure out how many letters/numbers per assignment , and for letters i 'll use the data collected on english so far ( etaoinshrdlu etc etc etc ) ( or if it 's a calculus class i 'll calculate it for d 's , x 's , and integral signs in a 3:4:1 ratio ) , and for numbers i 'll use [ benford 's law ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/benford's_law ) as a distribution . 
  then i 'll figure out the arclength of each letter and number from your samples , and multiply them by however many of them you 've probably written . 
  as a bonus , you also get a rough estimate of how many of each letter you 've written in your life . 
  he was n't yet giving you a reason as to why , just expressing his incredulity as to you not thinking it is . 
  not true ; i definitely do n't . 
  my mother is about to do this * driving from new jersey to central california * . 
  i 'm 60 % sure she 's not bringing along anything quite as big , though . 
  also she bought a large mazda sedan for the drive . 
  but the likelihood that she 'll have something stick out remains , unfortunately . 
  hmm i 'll need lower case and numbers too . 
  but anyway , i will get back to you with the calculations tomorrow ; i am on a phone and should be sleeping now . 
  ( very nice handwriting , btw . ), 
  edit : however i can provide the following data right now :, 
  a college-ruled paper is 33 lines long . 
  assuming you fill up the page for each letter assignment ( not exactly true , but we 're not trying to be super precise ) , and your lowercase letters are about as wide as your uppercase letters ( the difference is probably very negligible ) , and you always write letter assignments in english ( you did n't mention a calculus course or world language course ) , and you always write on college-ruled paper ( probably not true ) , and you fill up half the page in math assignments ( it 's probably less ) , and you leave a space about the width of a letter ( looks about right ) , and you leave a margin on the right of about 1/4 inches , and the first letter of a word has the same probability to be a particular letter as any other letter in a word ( certainly not accurate ) , then i can say this about the amount of each letter you have written in your academic career for homework up from middle school :, 
  you 've taken 17 letter courses and 5 number courses , each of which have had nightly assignments that consume one side of a college-ruled paper each . 
  every character you write is about 5/32 inches wide , and the writing space on a line is about 7 inches wide , which means you can fit about 44.8 characters on a line . 
  the average english word is about 5.1 characters ( thanks wolframalpha !, 
  ) , so ( 44.8 char + 1 `` virtual '' space ) / ( 5.1 char + 1 space ) = about 7.5 words per line , but you must break the line after each word so that rounds down to 7 words of 5.1 characters each , and 6 spaces between the words , each 1 character long . 
  this means that one line will contain 7 \\* 5.1 letters and 6 spaces ( the latter of which we ignore ) . 
  that 's 35.7 letters per line , and there 's 33 lines , but you do n't write in the last one , so altogether that 's ( 35.7 letters per line ) \\* ( 33 lines - 1 line ) / ( 1 page ) = 1142.4 letters per page . 
  say you get , on average , written homework for 160 nights a year . 
  that 's 160 pages , so each course will make you write , on average , ( 1142.4 letters per page ) \\* ( 160 pages ) / ( 1 course ) = 182784 letters per course . 
  ( 17 letter courses ) \\* ( 182784 letters per course ) = 3107328 letters . 
  the average english sentence is somewhere between 15 and 20 words , so we 'll assume 17.5 words per sentence . 
  each word is 5.1 characters , but 1.5 of the words ( a number i just pulled out of thin air ) will begin with a capital letter . 
  we split it up here : 16/17 .5 = 32/35 = 91.43 % of the words you write are all lowercase , and 1.5 / 17.5 = 3/35 = 9.57 % of the words you write will begin with an uppercase letter . 
  so the amount of lowercase letters you 've written is ( ( 32/35 ) \\* ( ( 5.1 lowercase letters ) / ( 5.1 letters ) ) + ( 3/35 ) \\* ( ( 4.1 lowercase letters ) / ( 5.1 letters ) ) ) \\* ( 3107328 letters ) = 3055104 lowercase letters that you 've written . 
  3107328 letters - 3055104 lowercase letters = 52224 uppercase letters ( the dimensional analysis there is a bit dodgy , but work with me here ) . 
  from there you just calculate how many of each letter you 've written using the available distribution :, 
  ( i generated the following markdown with a python script ; first the script , then the markdown ), 
  ltrs = ( ` a ' , ` b ' , ` c ' , 'd ' , ` e ' , ` f ' , ` g ' , ` h ' , ` i ' , ` j' , ` k ' , ` l' , 'm ' , 'n' , ` o ' , ` p ' , ` q ' , ` r ' , 's ' , ` t ' , ` u ' , ` v ' , ` w ' , ` x ' , ` y ' , ` z ' ), 
  for n in xrange ( 26 ) :, 
  from here it 's a simple matter to multiply by the arclength of each letter , and add !, 
  thank you !, 
  i will calculate the arclengths tomorrow . 
  meanwhile , take a look at my edit . 
  did you know you 've written approximately 388060 lowercase e 's in your academic career , but only about 511 uppercase v 's ? 
  i * totally * just lost all my shit over this . 
  hiiiii , cuties !, 
  you 're 3 * billion * years old and really tiny and you 're * still here * and i could just stare at you all day !, 
  i 've always been fascinated by prehistoric organisms , and also by plankton , and i 've always lamented that we 'll never be able to take some seawater from the early carboniferous and put it under a microscope and look at all the fascinating new ( old ) plankton ... this is as good as it gets !, 
  these little guys lived three * billion * years ago , and yet we can see them in front of us here today , their tiny size notwithstanding !, 
  ^ ( ( although , strictly speaking , appearifying things from the past would n't violate causality ... it would be as though they disappeared for that time and then popped back . 
  i guess it violates thermodynamics , though . 
  i am in part a biologist ( bioengineer really ) , and i approach seemingly unnecessary complexity in a non-designed thing in the following way : it was the first thing that came along to solve a particular problem that once was , and while it was n't necessarily the best way to solve the problem at all , it was better that no solution at all , so it stayed , since language generally transcends individual planning ( and most people just do n't think/want to change it ) . 
  ( this is obviously reminiscent of evolutionary theory in biology : cells are a mess because they accumulate random changes over time that happen to improve them . 
  there 's no overall force of coherency that would optimize a cell as a whole . ), 
  gendered words are good for languages that do n't have a fixed word order , because you can connect words by making them the same gender as each other . 
  this is called agreement . 
  you can , as a common example , make adjectives agree with the nouns they modify . 
  consider the latin sentence , `` m\u012bl\u0113s de\u00e6 magnus est , '' meaning , `` the goddess has the great soldier . '', 
  i know that the word `` magnus '' , `` great '' , is modifying `` m\u012bl\u0113s '' , `` soldier '' , because it is masculine ( and nominative , which is a case of a noun that marks the subject ) , like `` m\u012bl\u0113s '' . 
  i can quickly modify the meaning of the sentence without changing the word order : `` m\u012bl\u0113s de\u00e6 magn\u00e6 est. '', 
  `` the great goddess has the soldier . '', 
  all i 've done is changed the gender ( and case ) of the adjective to match the other noun in the sentence , and suddenly it 's modifying it , rather than `` m\u012bl\u0113s '' . 
  this is invaluable to disentangling long sentences with multiple nested clauses , of which the romans ( or their poets , at least ) used plenty . 
  however , old latin had gender , too , so it 's not like the romans came up with it . 
  maybe disambiguation is n't even why gender was concocted in the first place along that particular lineage !, 
  maybe they just genuinely wanted to sort different kinds of objects into different groups . 
  that is certainly how i see gender in niger-congo languages as having developed . 
  their noun classes ( which is what you call gender when there 's more than three types ) extend to tens and occasionally hundreds many , distinguishing between different categories of things . 
  kiswahili , for example , has two classes for people , two classes for natural phenomena ( and trees ) , two classes for groups of things ( like `` eyes '' ) , two classes for artifacts , two classes for miscellaneous things ( and animals ) , and a few extra , the last one of which is for abstract concepts . 
  while it may seem superfluous to sort things like that in speech , it only occurs to you because you 've only now been exposed to it !, 
  one who speaks kiswahili would find it very natural and logical to group nouns by categories , extending to speech . 
  ultimately , though , the evolution of languages is a very chaotic process , like the process of biological evolution that i compare it to . 
  changes happen for not really any good reason ; features of a language arise from habits and desires that happen to impact communication , not from anything sensible like planning and construction . 
  it 's a messy heap of stuff built on older stuff , one tiny brick at a time . 
  so it 's inconsistent and sub-optimal ? 
  how are you going to convince every speaker ever to change the way they communicate ? 
  because you as an individual certainly wo n't be able to change it by communicating differently by yourself . 
  all you 'll get is that people wo n't understand you . 
  billion !, 
  early carboniferous ~ !, 
  thank you !,
