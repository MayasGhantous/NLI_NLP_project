  why do n't you like it ? 
  to me , it looks rugged , and the fact that the whole thing is made out of mesh suggests that it ventilates \\* really * well . 
  it has more mounts for fans and drives than anyone could ever want , and it supports liquid cooling . 
  it 's very heavy , but it 's not like you 're traveling with the damn thing . 
  what 's wrong ? 
  [ http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/offended] ( http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/offended ) actually has a much better troll link at the bottom ( the `` offended by offended '' one ) . 
  do n't click it . 
  i meant the `` buying a mac '' price gradient . 
  i tried , but i could n't copypaste into minecraft , did n't want to actually type it out , and do n't know how to change the seed after world generation . 
  ** so barf **, 
  can you supply me with the proper responses to this sort of dialogue ? 
  my brain is unable to process . 
  same here . 
  i 've lived in both japan and china , and ... no . 
  what did you tell him afterwards ? 
  yeah , i 've been convicted of criminal negligence before . 
  not fun . 
  wow , nice build !, 
  i 'm not a fan of intel , but i was going to get that hard drive ( but ended up with the re4 because of its cache ) , and might get that graphics card if it drops in price . 
  ( also why is everyone obsessed with the haf 912 case , it 's weird . ), 
  you know what i 've noticed ? 
  kanaya looks really tired . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  eridan , because he is a douchebag . 
  a close second is equius , who is slightly less of a douchebag . 
  at least you can actually pronounce `` 23st '' . 
  it sounds like a sports drink . 
  at least you do n't delete all of your downvoted posts . 
  his username is `` thegopkilledjesus '' . 
  what other countries have a grand old party ? 
  wurps . 
  [ here 's the link . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shittytechsupport/comments/q966a/help_wiring_money_to_a_nigerian_prince/c3vv394 ) thanks for telling me !, 
  i 'm new to this subreddit . 
  that 's obviously because they use a color of the palette that 's also used somewhere else on her body . 
  twenty secondred . 
  like `` hundred '' . 
  why do n't you just buy the oem version of windows ? 
  it 's $ 40 cheaper . 
  unless you really want a warranty ? 
  it 's not rectangular ? 
  yeah , but then they dislike me not just for not owning a mac , but * also * for being rude . 
  also palettified ? 
  people disliking me . 
  i find it more convenient than confusing . 
  once i had a cave which was extremely convenient . 
  i could go spelunking for hours , and when i was finished , the damn staircase up would just appear out of fucking nowhere . 
  it was insane , and a little surreal . 
  you 're speaking of the mayor , of course , right ? 
  stupid . 
  why , what 's wrong ? 
  i mean , that 's obviously not the pi seed up there , but still ... 
  upvoting from the comment page does nothing . 
  :( the system adds in extra downvotes . 
  accidentally left out a tray of super-ebola . 
  it should be on the news shortly . 
  i always use wood for `` i wan na make my own x '' . 
  being able to work wood has been , like , the second most useful skill i 've ever learned , next to programming . 
  then again , it 's a fire hazard , but not a big one . 
  kill off john, 
  kill off john again, 
  quickly , someone find that gif, 
  somehow , if a comment has a lot of karma , then it \\* always * has some downvotes . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone that would downvote your comment ; does the system `` naturally '' add in downvotes once a post 's karma is too high , or what ? 
  i still do n't get how it shows black , though . 
  it looks different when it 's just off ... 
  ahhh, 
  interesting . 
  i 'm going to name this the `` szegedy weighting phenomenon '' . 
  people on their phones . 
  humor is irony is unexpectedness . 
  there , that 's shorter , too . 
  i do n't actually dislike you to any degree , but i have a really strong urge to say , `` stop fucking bragging . '', 
  on posts , it does ; it adds in the same amount of upvotes , in fact . 
  but i have n't heard this about comments ... 
  i read that this happens on links , but comments , too ? 
  and yes , fuzzing . 
  wait , what ? 
  how ? 
  are you saying they 're at \\* 0 * karma or less ?

  are you sure you 're the only one that accesses them ? 
  oh ... that 's * really * weird . 
  cool that you 're testing such stuff , though !, 
  it 's triangular . 
  not so . 
  they could be very close relatives ( such as one 's mother in this case ) . 
  it case you 're curious , that hard drive in the picture is for my laptop . 
  i like what my desk says about me , as well . 
  although , i must admit i have never actually played a game that requires a d20 . 
  i do n't like the corner feature because it 's completely invisible . 
  there 's no way to tell that it exists . 
  interfaces should be intuitive . 
  does n't quicktime have a built-in thing for recording ? 
  yes , but then he would n't get every block , i believe . 
  also , this way , width and height are arbitrary . 
  but i 'm tired ; maybe there really is an obvious solution that i 'm missing . 
  how do i `` take off the thermal paste '' ? 
  yes . 
  it 's beautiful !,
