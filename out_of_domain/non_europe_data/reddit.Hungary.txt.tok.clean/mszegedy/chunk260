   for example , what if i wanted to say to you ' i could care less about reddit ' ? 
  you would assume that i mean i 'm ambivalent to it, 
  but that 's the thing , i would n't !, 
  i 'd assume that reddit hardly matters to you , because that 's how people use the phrase `` could care less '' . 
  that 's what makes it not wrong . 
  the other person will always understand what you mean . 
  at least , in this day and age . 
  in the 50s , you 'd be right . 
  but not now that `` could care less '' tells people that you do n't care . 
  you 're the one trying to give it a definition that conflicts with how it is used . 
   ye knowe eek , that in forme of speche is chaunge, 
   with-inne a thousand yeer , and wordes tho, 
   that hadden prys , now wonder nyce and straunge, 
   us thinketh hem ; and yet they spake hem so ,, 
   and spedde as wel in love as men now do ;, 
   eek for to winne love in sondry ages ,, 
   in sondry londes , sondry been usages . 
  look , i do n't have the energy for this . 
  if you tell most people that you could care less about something , they 'll interpret that as you do n't care about that something . 
  if you mean it as it being possible for you to care less about that something , then you 're not wrong , and they 're not wrong , but you 're not being understood , so you 're putting yourself at a disadvantage . 
  nothing is ever linguistically wrong . 
  languages do n't inherently have rules or vocabularies , and are n't stone . 
  we make up rules that allow us to describe most of a language , but those rules do n't tell the language how to behave ; they 're just descriptions of the language . 
  if anything is `` wrong '' , it 's when you make it difficult for other people to understand you . 
  people understand `` could care less '' as `` do n't care '' , so using it to mean that is not wrong under that , either . 
  you 're trying to define the phrase outside of how people speak it . 
  i do n't care if you want to define it as `` do n't care '' or `` able to care '' . 
  trying to define it and then forcing people to comply with your definition is what is wrong . 
  you yourself are free to say `` could n't '' , just if you hear someone say `` could '' , do n't tell them that they 're wrong , because they 're not wrong , especially because you could understand them . 
   i 'm not being understood , so it 's my fault ? 
  that 's what you 're saying ? 
  they think could = could not , so it 's my fault they do n't know what i 'm talking about ? 
  you 're fucking ridiculous . 
  yes . 
  you 're not speaking their language . 
  or , rather , you 're mostly speaking their language , but there 's a rift there , and you can choose to cross it or not . 
  it does n't matter either way what you do , linguistically . 
  but it probably matters to you whether they understand you or not . 
   like when people inappropriately use a word to mean the exact opposite of what it means , confusing everyone who actually has an education in the room ? 
  sounds like it 'd be annoying , yeah . 
  granted , if the people they were talking to really interpreted it as `` able to care less '' , then that would be annoying . 
  but that 's not anybody on reddit , or anybody i know . 
  maybe if you were in a foreign country , they 'd interpret it that way . 
  but if you were on reddit , for example , then people would instantly know that you mean `` do n't care '' . 
  and if people ca n't understand you because of you using a malapropism , then that is indeed your problem . 
  `` could care less '' is understood by people who hear it as `` do n't care '' , so using it as `` do n't care '' is n't a problem at all . 
  but it 's not a mistake if people understand you . 
  on reddit , people * will * correct you , but even the fact that they 're doing that already shows that they know what you mean . 
  knowing what you mean is good enough , and anything beyond that is problematic for a number of reasons ( how long is one to keep defending the `` correct '' usage until it slips out of their grasp ? 
  what if i have ulterior motives for wanting to change the language ? 
  what if my version makes it actually incomprehensible to a large group of people ? 
  of course , most of these problems do n't apply here , but this is what makes prescriptivism in general bad ) . 
  but what makes it worse than the three-character-longer version ? 
  ( well , one thing that makes it worse is that it leads to arguments that can go on for hours . 
  :p you 've got support there . ), 
  it does n't make you harder to understand ; in fact , it 's how a lot of other people use it , too . 
  ~ ~ i 'm no expert , but i think convention is that / / indicates prescription , and [ ] indicates description . 
  at least , that 's how i would describe how i 've seen it . ~ ~ that is dumb and wrong . 
  alas , i was going to say something different but then changed it at the last second . 
  it was closer to the mark . 
  here it is , copied out of the [ * guide to linguistic conventions * ] ( http://www.languagegeek.com/roman/conventions.html ) :, 
  [ square brackets ], 
  indicate a unit of exact phonetic pronunciation -- a phone . 
  each symbol in [ square brackets ] has a precise sound , irrespective of language , so that [ k ] is always a velar voiceless stop , the sound written ` k ' in ` sky ' , or ` c ' in ` scam ' . 
  symbols inside these brackets are typically in ipa , the international phonetic alphabet . 
  / slash brackets /, 
  symbols inside / slash brackets / are abstract , they represent a phoneme . 
  a phoneme represents a sound or group of sounds that the language treats as one . 
  in many dialects of english , the phoneme / l / can be pronounced [ l ] at the beginning of a syllable : as in ` listen ' , and [ \u026b ] or [ \u029f ] at the end of a syllable : like ` call ' . 
  notice how each / l / sound uses quite different tongue position . 
  in some languages -- albanian for example -- [ l ] and [ \u029f ] are distinct phonemes . 
  symbols inside these brackets may be either in ipa or that language 's phonological standard : e.g. 
  [ j ] is often written / y / for english . 
  if it creates any confusion , then i 'll be sure to not use it , and maybe even warn people that it 's confusing . 
  ( actually , maybe i 'll do that anyway , because it * is * confusing to second-language english speakers , since they interpret the phrase literally . 
  i 'll warn people not to use it around them , or to tell them that that 's what it means . ), 
  but i do n't see anyone going , `` hmm , does he mean that he cares about it , and is able to care less about it , or that he does n't care about it ? '', 
  i do n't see anyone being actually confused . 
  just people being annoyed , which is only because they think prescriptively ( through no fault of their own ; `` the way i do it is best '' is a natural mindset ) . 
  okay , good . 
  i have no idea then and google does n't help . 
  edit : google helps . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've since corrected mine . 
  that 's pretty strange . 
  i 'll make sure to say `` could n't '' when talking to you . 
  ( not that i say `` could '' anyway . 
  i like being consistent , and not getting corrected . ), 
  i maintain though that 5 % of people getting confused is not enough to make a phrase wrong , except when you 're talking to that 5 % . 
  huh . 
  what was stopping you ? 
  who , linguists ? 
  i just want people to stop telling other people how to talk . 
  so , i 'm telling people how to tell other people how to talk . 
  the camera is abstract and points out of his chest . 
  ( probably ; or maybe it 's observer-dependent and someone playing as the spy sees something different from what someone else sees ? ), 
  in order to prevent anyone from making a nokia joke , i 'm mentioning it before anybody else does . 
  edit : goddammit it did n't work, 
  huh ? 
  explain plz ?
