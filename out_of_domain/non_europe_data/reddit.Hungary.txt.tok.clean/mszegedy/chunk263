  how does it allow me to figure out how the whole wavefunction changes , if i have more than one object ? 
  what does , say , a generic force being exerted on a particle look like ? 
  you 're right , i may be looking for the dirac equation , but i do n't know what spin would even be in the context of my game , so i assumed i can just model objects in my world as spinless . 
  that was a pretty dumb assumption , as far as assumptions go . 
  i can do it real-time , and my system is n't particularly good ( intel core i5 @ 2.6 ghz , integrated gfx ( not like it matters ) , and i gave it like 256 mb of ram ) . 
  i ran it inside of vbox , and my fans did n't even become loud . 
  i just would n't want to spend all that time typing it out . 
  your description made me think , `` but i could always just go to / r/all , '' completely innocently . 
  but then it dawned on me that that was the joke . 
  but when i entered the subreddit , it was different from / r/all . 
  i was slightly disappointed . 
  right , i understand the bit about the hamiltonian . 
  i meant that a uniform force is exerted on the particle regardless of its position . 
  classically , the lagrangian would be a constant . 
  but since klein-gordon is for a free particle , i see that i ca n't calculate that with it . 
  i will visit your link . 
  what thought process leads someone to think , `` i should ride a penny-farthing to places . '' ? 
  what advantages are there to it ? 
  i can see the disadvantage of looking like a hipster , and that of being less comfortable . 
  but that does n't make me want to ride one . 
  i am so jealous . 
  i wish i could dedicate the time to write an intelligent program that converts google maps maps into zelda-like maps . 
  i was going to say that op 'd have the common sense to tell the guy what equation he wants , but then i realized that this was a gift . 
  oh well , missed opportunity for the first field equation or something . 
  tbf i 'd be very mad if my vacation photos were lost . 
  did they issue some sort of warning ? 
  do n't forget the [ house of wisdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_wisdom ) . 
  or , heck , any of [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_destroyed_libraries ) . 
  i have n't ridden one . 
  it looks uncomfortable . 
  what i 'm asking is , what * makes * it fun ? 
  or better ? 
  the first title was `` the harvest gypsies '' , for the series of articles he wrote that it developed from . 
  * shrug * i 'm not condeming it either . 
  i 'm just confused . 
  hmm , 3/4 for bric . 
  i guess only india uses hindi as its national language . 
  you hear it a lot in the us , too , though . 
  we know, 
  or nsmb wii . 
  the names ' letters are blocks and you are in a room and you get to destroy them . 
  what indication is there that op misinterpreted the picture ? 
  we should quit while we are ahead and reduce logging to sustainable levels . 
  ( yes , like that 's gon na happen . ), 
  everyone does that . 
  you 're unusual . 
  most people it bothers them for the rest of their lives . 
  considering they added english as the us 's national language , they do n't seem to care about constitutions . 
  them committing fraud is less likely than 278256 ^ ( -3 ) ? 
  what if she has the magic power to change the future winning numbers ? 
  for the stichtite/serpentine , i thought i was looking at a rare steak . 
  matrices . 
  scientific ? 
  mathematical at best . 
  i 've been drinking many kinds of iced tea for years now . 
  no kidney stones yet . 
  that is the best way to describe it . 
  nope . 
  the organs that regenerate them ( the pedicles ) clearly got ripped out too , unfortunately . 
  the deer probably died as well ; the pedicles are attached directly to the skull , so it had to somehow break that ( exposing the brain , eww ... ) . 
  but if we calibrate both our scores to 0 once anybody starts handing out chocolate bars , then if you gave me two chocolate bars , then my score would become 2 , and your score would become -2 . 
  if we want to find out the total amount of chocolate bars , we just add back however many we had before calibration , and add our scores together . 
  i do n't understand ; reddit usually loves prescriptivism . 
  has it had a change of heart ? 
  ( i hope so ), 
  it looks blank to me , rather than blue . 
  but anyone can build a much slower one for much less money without a license . 
  at least , one that works on high school lockers . 
  although they tend to have boring things inside . 
  except for textbooks . 
  i gave them back . 
  ( they did n't need them . ), 
  and it 's pronounced [ ` kal\u03b5dvulx ] iirc . 
  ( [ a ] has no direct analogue in english , but is sort of like `` ah '' . 
  [ x ] is like german `` ch '' , greek '' \u03c7 '' , or russian '' \u0445 '' . 
  the rest are pronounced how they look ( [ \u03b5 ] is like the `` e '' in `` kept '' ) . ), 
  my background is practically exclusively in theoretical cs ( it 's a family practice ) , and i would never call cs a science . 
  what i call science is any field that makes conjectures based on evidence , usually testing them via the scientific method . 
  it would be more apt to call cs computer engineering . 
  it looked pretty standard for old computers , dust-wise . 
  i 've had to take apart several for a build-a-computer workshop for middle schoolers , and they were all like that on the inside . 
  those last few look very chinese . 
  why does that mean that you ca n't use it for snake jokes ? 
  i own a ball python . 
  he 's pretty docile . 
  but people do n't * get * computer lessons , unfortunately . 
  although a computer license would be terrible to have to get . 
  it 's ... actually okay that that last pic is shaky . 
  * they tried cooling their computer using caviar ? 
  * i mean , i 'm a fan of science , but that is definitely something they wasted . 
  for some reason , as a kid i thought it was for younger kids . 
  i guess that 's not true , but that 's what mostly contributed to my apathy towards pokemon . 
  i wish someone would invent a more original metaphor than fishing . 
  well , we 're not very smart , and it 's not our responsibility anyway . 
  this is n't even * believable * bullshit . 
  i 'm not sure how that ties in . 
  could you please explain ? 
  ( also , why do you have me tagged as srs ? 
  i posted in srd once , and that 's it . ), 
  but ...
