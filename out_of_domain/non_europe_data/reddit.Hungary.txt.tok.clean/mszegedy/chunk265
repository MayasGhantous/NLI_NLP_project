  i 'm not sure whether it would work on * drosophila * , though . 
  ms paint has no lasso tool afaik . 
  i fully understand that extracting useful work from heat is prohibited by the laws of thermodynamics , but could n't you simply cool the ratchet down every so often with a well-placed electron or something ? 
  yes , but it had a very , very long wavelength . 
  cranial caps are n't vegetarian ? 
  ... * shit . 
  could n't he just pay them to take off the sign ? 
  / r/gw posters have user histories , too . 
  i 'm a biologist ( sort of ) . 
  i do mean things to animals sometimes . 
  but it 's for research . 
  and we always learn something valuable from them . 
  * you have no bitcoins ? 
  biomed engineer here , erasing a tattoo with a laser would never ever work in real life . 
  where are you * getting * that from ? 
  ^ ^ just ^ ^ kidding, 
  ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ case ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ ^ tell, 
  i think it 's one of those accounts that is used to get downvotes especially , on purpose , rather than non-ironically being terrible . 
  ( of course , they 're still terrible , but the person using them carefully coordinates their posts to be hated . ), 
   more than < 12 hours, 
  make up your mind !, 
  as it stands , your statement evaluates to the empty set . 
  well , blaming it on `` summer '' definitely did n't demonstrate an understanding of the account 's nature . 
  i was just making sure the person i was replying to knew about the phenomenon . 
  sure , but his comment said `` more than & lt ; 12 hours '' , which i ( and , i suspect , many others ) read as `` greater than 12 hours * and * less than 12 hours '' . 
  there 's no number that satisfies that . 
  yw , although you do n't sound too happy about it ... sorry , i just could n't understand what you meant . 
  but in book 7 a whole bunch of students died within hogwarts 's walls and none of them caused a soulsplosion . 
  although , if they did have the soulsplosion as a detection mechanic , they probably would have turned it off for the battle , since otherwise it would have become distracting . 
  so it 's still inconclusive , i guess . 
  remember , mr. hat and cloak 's most significant known ability is memory wiping , so he 's implicated heavily . 
  hjpev , not hjevp, 
  `` let a be the set of numbers less than 12 , and then take the set of numbers ( out of r ) that are greater than every number in a. '', 
  that 's totally valid . 
  i was taking them out of a , rather than r. i like your interpretation better . 
  edit : replaced `` any '' with `` every '' , since the former could be interpreted ambiguously as either `` there exists '' or `` for all '' . 
  r is the set of all real numbers . 
  i defined a in the first sentence . 
  otherwise , good show !, 
  hell no . 
  we have caves with ~ ~ large ~ ~ huge selenite crystals though , which are similar . 
  been featured in ng : la `` cueva de los cristales '' . 
  but those are towards the surface . 
  edit : oh , i see someone linked you it . 
  the most likely explanation i can come up with is that the person writing it took ancient greek classes and now mentally substitutes `` ai '' for `` ae '' in the text he sees . 
  or , even more likely , he 's seen the pattern a lot and accidentally followed it here . 
  edit : aaand i mildly dyslexically committed my own error : it 's `` praseodymium '' , not `` praesodymium '' . 
  dammit !, 
  meanwhile , i 've realized it 's `` praseodymium '' , not `` praesodymium '' . 
  what bothers me is that we still downvote them . 
  -  the joke, 
  i 'm interpreting it as having to hold true for every number less than 12 , not just at least one number less than 12 . 
  but he knows what happens in them . 
  for example , there was a chapter in hpmor where quirrel complained about a sixth-year using a dangerous , mysterious curse on another sixth-year , intentionally paralleling the usage of * sectumsempra * on draco by harry in book 6 . 
  well , if we work together to ignore them ... but somehow that 's not happening ? 
  idgi . 
  cationbot - ** 0.02 % **, 
   reddit during class, 
  all things considered , it 's summer . 
  i mean that , for a particular a , a  b must hold for every number b less than 12 . 
  for example , 10 is not satisfactory , because , while it is greater than 5 , it is not greater than 11 . 
  edit : more formally : let a be the set of numbers less than 12 . 
  the answer set , b , is the set of every number for which it holds true that , for any ( wherein this does * not * mean `` there exists '' , but `` for all '' ) number you pluck out of a , it is greater than it . 
  * keep them at 1 * . 
  you 're capable of ignoring someone , are n't you ? 
  what 's the problem ? 
  shooting about it is a very effective solution to most problems , including this one . 
  the rest of the sequences are arithmetic . 
  but reddit 's hate can be quantified . 
  it 's fun to see how negative you can get your karma . 
  now you 're just being paranoid . 
  my desk and floor look like that . 
  are you sure it 's yours ? 
  also , eridan was definitely sort of like that . 
  ... since when was aranea not a light player ? 
  hold on , i think you meant space . 
  * broklyn, 
  or something else, 
  umm ... no fuck ? 
  where did they think the oxygen in its soil came from , if not an oxygen-rich atmosphere ? 
  occam 's razor strongly suggests the second one , but , just checking , how much research has been done on radiation-induced hydrolysis ? 
  it was supposed to be ? 
  i first heard of it several years ago . 
  the whole universe is the hole in eridan 's body . 
  you could easily graph it parametrically using fourier analysis , but i somehow doubt that that 's what 's going on here . 
  1 yen ~ 1 cent, 
  you mean tungsten carbide , right ? 
  or do you mean tungsten boride ? 
   too buggy to deal with, 
  eheheh, 
  but we have long concluded that quirrelmort 's horcruxes are in space , underground , in the atmosphere , etc. 
  it is probably just roger bacon 's diary . 
  do you think a wizard would understand words like `` syntactically '' and `` ai '' ? 
  ach , hungary finally makes an appearance sort of , but we have no interesting accent like the germans or french . 
  central of more probably . 
  i have lm15 as well , and i solved this problem by getting rid of the names altogether and relying on the favicons . 
  it 's much neater . 
  and forehead , and right forearm ... he looks tense . 
  eh , they have a whole tectonic plate , and more ethnicities than you can shake a stick at . 
  they deserve to be a continent imo .
