  `` almost unlimited '' ? 
  that 's like saying `` almost pregnant '' . 
  no of course , i see what you were getting at . 
  i 'd just have appreciated a better assessment of its size . 
  even `` practically unlimited '' would have worked better , or `` maybe unlimited '' ( although the latter clearly is n't realistic ) . 
  they are probably talking about the word `` china '' rather than `` zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 '' . 
  edit : but wait , i do n't think `` china '' means that either . 
  hmm . 
  the middle kingdom is the literal translation of the chinese . 
  i think they 're looking at the literal translation of `` china '' , although i do n't know how that translates to `` riceland '' : `` china '' comes from latin `` s\u012bna '' , and that definitely does not mean `` rice '' . 
  \\* * dubito ut cogitam ergo sum/sim * ( depending on whaz you meant ), 
  grossness of windex ~ grossness of gatorade, 
  do the mayonnaise thing , or the vodka thing . 
  although , you 'd have to finish a whole jar of mayonnaise for the first one . 
  but it 's so hard to remember !, 
  i always remember to do so about half a second after i smile . 
  a * lot * of astronomical events release a * lot * of energy . 
  the shallow bowl : more surface area , less depth . 
  it 's nearly all false color . 
  can you show us an example ? 
  i 've never seen such a thing . 
  ( this submission does n't count , because it 's not real . ), 
  maybe a small jar of [ urea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urea ) , possibly mixed with [ chloride ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chloride ) . 
  plz explain ? 
  how would two primates give birth to a dolphin ? 
  mutagens might get you as far as two flippers ; is that what you mean ? 
  not no information . 
  he has the information that op never notices any girls hit on him . 
  first column , seventh row ; first column , twelfth row ; first column , thirteenth row ; second column , eighth row ; third column , ninth row ; fourth column , eighth row ; fourth column , ninth row . 
  granted , not modern chinese-looking , but surely you admit there is a resemblance , especially to early chinese . 
  is the only way that i can lose money on bitcoin mining that i use non-power-efficient hardware ? 
  and , which part of the process diverts money to me and secures it as mine ? 
  i 'd imagine paragraph 2 , right ? 
  how can gpus compete against asics at all ? 
  it does n't seem possible to just get lucky . 
  also , i do n't think most people here understand the concept of an sha-1 hash . 
  the point is , though , that the particular colors have no significance , since they are arbitrary . 
  sorry , that 's all i 've got . 
  i do n't think you 're getting downvotes because people do n't like what you have to say ( although i do n't think they do ) , but because you posted this in an irrelevant place . 
  i mean , you got the subreddit right , and even the post right . 
  but this thread of comments is n't about making racist jokes .

  do hungarians count ? 
  i am hungarian and am considering doing this . 
  i like the usage of `` i '' for scratch and english : they are unique people . 
  but otherwise i agree . 
  what about it is boring ? 
  free as in ` merica , not free as in no price . 
  it 's the name of the site . 
  i think it 's appropriate , considering that they want to represent themselves as honest journalists . 
  are you a member of / r/astronomy yet ? 
  if not , join us !, 
  or know something about literary theory , anyway . 
  that passage raised the question , though , of why harry was considering literary theory at all as something that related to his situation . 
  if i were considering something real , then story logic would n't even cross my mind , because i do n't live in a story . 
  i thought it would be the same for harry , but it seems like it is n't . 
  obv a stock letter , but that does n't make it any less cool . 
  i included that in my dismissal . 
  ey said so himself : common sense is often mistaken for legilimency . 
  i was waiting for someone to comment on us , but it turns out to be another hungarian . 
  -_- no one ever talks about us !, 
  oh well , that 's okay . 
  cancer is 80 % lifestyle . 
  it 's your fault for not staying away from carcinogens , you idiot . 
  i know , and i find it very confusing . 
  why ? 
  we already have / r/stormfront . 
  you could rip off their css if you wanted to , also . 
  vile prescriptivst !, 
  although , it makes sense . 
  but it * does * work . 
  i 've confirmed it empirically . 
   most hungarian vocab is either slavic or germanic, 
  very off-base . 
  most day-to-day words we use are ugric . 
  how do you know he did n't understand the difference between the two `` bots '' ? 
  maybe he just means cb + is not funny anymore . 
  those are ro anyway . 
  in fact , where is the original post ? 
  most old game cartridges are ro . 
  edit : oh , found if . 
  the guy replaced the rom with an hdd . 
  that so does n't count . 
  more like , `` i took a hard drive and gave it a nes cartridge case . '', 
  this got me thinking about what cartridges * are * rw , though . 
  are ds cartridges rw ? 
  i mean , i have one that takes a microsd , but that 's different . 
  i guess they 'd have to have an rw component , since you can transfer game data between dses using them . 
  how much genetics do you exactly know ? 
  i want to know what level to write this response at . 
  i 'll make an attempt :, 
  dna 's purpose is to code for rna , whose purpose is sometimes to code for proteins , whose purpose is to do stuff . 
  we know what kind of rna will result from transcribing a particular region of dna , and we know what kind of protein will result from translating a particular region of rna .
