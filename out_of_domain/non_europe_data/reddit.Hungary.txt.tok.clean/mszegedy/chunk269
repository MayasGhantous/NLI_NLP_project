  edit : quirrelmonroert acting like a voldemort in the company of death eaters who also treat him as though he is voldemort would still not be convincing , in fact , because of our complete lack of trust in him . 
  i invent the cure for cancer * daily * , only to be distracted by princess leia !, 
  wait , really ? 
  since when ? 
  huh . 
  finally . 
  they were giving this website a slightly worse name than it deserves . 
  thank you for the link !,

  number 6 is mesmerizing . 
  dude , do you know what ~ ~ substitution ~ ~ formatting is ? 
  as a michael , plz spell it `` michael '' , we 'll all be happier, 
  i always translated `` v\u00f6r\u00f6s '' as `` crimson '' . 
  i can think of very little of it . 
  brahms was german ( and probably got the dances from elsewhere than hungary ) , and liszt was austrian . 
  what is a classical hungarian piece ? 
  edit : turns out liszt is hungarian . 
  you forgot a link ? 
  it 's definitely poland . 
  is that africa ? 
  the publishers could maybe make her write a midquel series still . 
  i feel stupid . 
  welp ca n't say i did n't see that coming, 
  i do n't really understand the logic behind the `` ea '' spelling , personally . 
  ( admittedly english is n't my first language ), 
  in hungary , we call it `` pulyka '' , [ pujk\u0252 ] . 
  i have no idea why . 
  edit : [ this etymology dictionary ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=p&amp;amp;qsearch=&amp;amp;qdetail=9275 ) is not of makings any clearer . 
  in hungarian , our equivalent is mih\u00e1ly , [ miha : j ] ( me-hi , hi as in the greeting ; you get nearly a perfect reproduction of our pronunciation !, 
  try inverting the colors for new jersey . 
  also , put an outline of our state in the middle , instead of a star . 
  that 's how we have it on our license plate . 
  impossible . 
  ewww . 
  you do n't just post some code without explaining how it works !, 
  how does it work ? 
  is the compression lossless ? 
  they should have done hungary and romania ; all the negative ones would be each other . 
  edit : that word is so long that i forgot what language i was writing in midway through . 
  the rest is `` because at least i understand that one . '', 
  `` elt\u00f6redezni '' is the root , i think . 
  hungarian sort of has an infinitely long word :, 
  it means `` the inability to be made free of the inability to be made free of the inability to be made free of the inability to be made free of ... a substance that makes you free of hair that does [ this ] ( http://archiv.magyarszo.com/arhiva/2007/04/12/images/110_tv16hajveg.jpg ) '' . 
  how did you get away with using circletool for the castle floor and walls ? 
  speaking of which , the circles on the floor should be ellipses . 
  huh . 
  that 's kind of a funny trick . 
  props for creativity !, 
  `` say that a particular configuration of the universe is where every particle is at once . 
  we used to think the world has a particular configuration . 
  but actually it looks like every configuration is assigned a number , called an amplitude . 
  the laws of physics tell the amplitude to flow around from configuration to configuration , over time . 
  if a couple configurations have both very high amplitudes , we say they 're in ` superposition ' . 
  you can only experience one configuration at a time , and you 're more likely to experience configurations with greater amplitudes . 
  most configurations have an amplitude of nearly zero . '', 
  but then you 'd have to go into the basics of qm phenomena : the born probabilities , decoherence/entanglement , the empirical proof of the bell theorem , the truth behind wave/particle duality ... that 's kinda difficult . 
  also they might not understand the idea of a configuration . 
  well , `` difficult to understand '' . 
  definitely difficult to solve for , but is it so hard to understand the idea of a wavefunction , and of a hamiltonian ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned , if you understand those two , you understand qm . 
  sort of what i do now : biomedical engineer ( with a focus in nanotechnology , but never mind ) , but only teach when i wanted to ( instead of when i had to ) . 
  and i get sabbaticals whenever i want , too . 
  also , can i specify my job as one in which i get unlimited grants ? 
  he was already given an apology . 
  the prime minister did n't pardon him , though , since he did break what was the law at the time . 
  i guess he changed his mind . 
  the point of giving him a pardon is that it means that he never did anything wrong . 
  together with the apology ( which says that the government did something wrong ) , it completes the set of , `` you never did anything wrong , and we did do something wrong '' . 
  but i hate the smell asparagus gives my piss . 
  it 's why i stopped eating it . 
  gmos i agree , non-organic food is still bleh, 
  having kids . 
  actually , the most apt promotional line i 've heard for it was on reddit : `` kids are like programmable friends . '', 
  well , shift between three different superpositions of three different types ( [ matt strassler explains it best ] ( http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/ ) ) , but that 's a technicality . 
  but i thought this was already observed a while ago ? 
  i 'd agree if the pardon were n't posthumous . 
  i feel that the law should be predictable in order to be useful ( see * decisis stare * ) , so you should n't be able to retroactively reverse decisions . 
  however , this pardon does n't actually change anything , since turing died a long time ago . 
  i 'm willing to bet that the percentage of people who are about to commit suicide that look happy is less than the percentage of everybody else that look happy . 
  that is , looking happy is ( probably weak ) bayesian evidence for not being about to commit suicide . 
  sorry , i was n't trying hard to sound intelligent ; i 'm just used to using that kind of language to discuss evidence . 
  ^ ( ( edit : actually , i see nothing about my first post that looks even mildly intelligent ; i even used bad grammar . 
  at most i used the word `` bayesian '' . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  what i mean is , take a look at [ bayes ' theorem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bayes'_theorem ) . 
  it tells you how much evidence changes the likelihood of something being true : how much b being true changes the probability of a being true . 
  in order to to use it , you need to know how likely b was to be true in the first place , how likely a was in the first place , and how likely b is to happen if a is true . 
  in our case , a is whether somebody is suicidal , b is whether they are happy or not . 
  if you can make educated guesses at the right side of bayes ' theorem , then you can guess how likely the left side was . 
  i was making educated guesses at the right side , and i came to a conclusion about the left side . 
  the idea is , though , that if p ( b | a ) ( here , somebody is looking happy , given that they are suicidal ) is less than p ( b ) ( here , somebody is looking happy ) , then no matter how likely p ( a ) was in the first place , it 's now less likely . 
  i think that the probability that somebody is looking happy given that they are suicidal is less than the probability that they are looking happy at all . 
  bayes ' theorem then compels me to assign a lower probability to a person being suicidal , if they look happy . 
  that is , looking happy is evidence against being suicidal , by that judgement . 
  so looking happy * was * a worthwhile thing to include in that list . 
  however , i think p ( b | a ) is similar to p ( b ) ( although lower ) , so p ( a ) does n't change much in the face of b. 
  that 's what i meant by it being '' ( probably weak ) '' evidence .
