  i might 've put a few more bits and bobs myself on the [ instrument ] ( http://qkme.me/3obn04 ) , but it 's really awesome as it is !, 
  what annoys me more about the dialoglog is the unfinished spelling of `` dialogue '' . 
  it 's shit, 
  what 's wrong with the case ? 
  wow , that is beautiful . 
  what 's so impressive about a search ? 
  seconded . 
  or in proper c format :, 
  if ( `` it '' = = `` idiot trainer '' ) {, 
  `` helpdesk '' = `` help me face-desk '' ;, 
  but you ca n't assign to string literals , and the proposition at the top would always return false ... < _ < ( and i know the brackets are n't necessary ), 
  this should be rewritten in lisp . 
  edit :, 
  ( if ( equalp ` it ` idiot-trainer ), 
  ( setq helpdesk ` help-me-facedesk ) ), 
  ... what ? 
  you just second it again . 
  i 'm not sure why this is being downvoted . 
  this is actually a very good point . 
  the philosophy is that you accommodate - anyone - . 
  yup !, 
  heh , i find it brilliant that someone thought of and implemented the same thing that i did ... even if it is excessively pointless . 
  what ? 
  surely it follows the rolling update model . 
  no , just `` seconded '' . 
  i can never be satisfied with those damn stickers . 
  they 're always off-center or improperly oriented ... 
  so , we 're supposed to be dicks to smokers ? 
  exactly, 
  edit : wait , what , female ? 
  when i saw the title , i hoped it was oil ... 
  lots of the it guys i 've met have been real nice with personal use equipment ... once , my hard drive was rescued from death with the school 's copy of diskwarrior ( which i did n't own ) . 
  i 've always been like `` omg thnkx this is mazign of you '' . 
  but i understand this response as well ( more , in fact ) . 
  hell no . 
  anyone here know pascal ? 
  3x3x3 miles ? 
  like watson on jeopardy with a monkey fucking a watermelon ? 
  ... that is badass . 
  i think i 've heard of this before ; did n't it go to 7 ghz ? 
  strangely , i prefer `` analog '' to `` analogue '' . 
  the landmines do the rest . 
  a google did n't show anything . 
  d : i think i 'll just delete this once you reply ... 
  no and no , unfortunately, 
  d : i am so sorry ... 
  same ; this is what reminded me of this instance as well . 
  they 're all duplicates . 
  the thing is , in that particular game , it 's impossible to give a sprite layer priority , due to the nature of the way it uses the platform . 
  it 's possible to demote its layer priority ( i do not know what this is called ) , which will make it go behind scenery and such , even the background layer . 
  this is useful for enemies such as piranha plants , which `` hide '' in pipes . 
  there was a thread here about it ; quite a good one , too . 
  that 's where a lot of people here got it from . 
  it 's by skaia 's direction , so that the new ( old ? ), 
  battlefield has a place to be put . 
  funny , but i 'm always going to pronounce it [ h\u028as\u02d0i\u02d0 ] . 
  ( for those who do n't know ipa : / \u028a / is the vowel you hear in the middle of `` good '' . 
  `` huss '' was pronounced [ h\u028cs\u02d0 ] in the video , / \u028c / being the vowel you hear in the middle of `` but '' . ), 
  seriously , though , what is mayonnaise made from ? 
  is it seeds , like mustard ? 
  [ here you go !, 
  north of what ? 
  here in hungary , a `` northern accent '' means that there 's no slovak mixed in , and standard hungarian does n't contain any / \u028a / vowels . 
  :d the slovak vowel shift might make it so , but its absence is what northern accent means here . 
  i have n't studied english accents very thoroughly , forgive me . 
  the only differences i know concerning them is the differences between rp and eastern american english . 
  i 've worked with the game before , so that 's how i knew . 
  i might have forgotten a way to make the sprite have layer priority , though . 
  but if there 's one thing i know for sure , that sort of programming was n't in the original game . 
  no need for * you * to apologize . 
  reporting from hungary : ~ ~ you 're an idiot . ~ ~ okay , fine , i ca n't blame you for lack of context . 
  but seriously , we ( the hungarian people ) all know that this is complete bullshit on his part . 
  we do n't view the government as part of us ; more like how a toddler views its parents : goddamn it , fine , i 'll comply if you want me to , but i 'll get away with a bazillion other things . 
  no one 's going to listen to that clown . 
  he can spout his nonsense , but no one 's going to take it seriously . 
  i wonder what they 'd have to liberate here . 
  everyone is christian and everything 's mostly farmland and small villages with lots of old people . 
  and we 're not sitting on oil . 
  actually , we have no valuable resources , really . 
  now , if the world currency was paprika ... 
  and we 're all severely butthurt about the 1920 treaty of trianon . 
  could someone please narrate a conversation between them for me ? 
  i really ca n't imagine how it would go . 
  he considered a kismesis with john , though , after he mentioned it . 
  five seconds of googling and it turns out you 're right . 
  so , eggs , oil , and some sort of stabilizer , like lemon juice . 
  hmm ... 
  how did you keep your weapons from wearing away ? 
  or did you just punch ? 
  can you starve to death on easy ? 
  ahh . 
  thanks !, 
  so , yeah , this is the point i was trying to make : he did n't have to be on creative to not starve to death ; he would have stopped losing health at some point . 
  this subreddit absolutely \\* loves * [pcpartpicker.com ] ( http://www.pcpartpciker.com ) . 
  all of the tables here are generated with it , and all of the links always lead to a pcpartpicker page . 
  i 'm not sure you grasp the magnitude of this failure . 
  there was a parallel thread in [ / r/minecraft ] ( / r/minecraft ) , and it was goddamn hideous . 
  that 's okay , i do n't need 1tb . 
  but it 's got half as much cache , which would be much more useful to me than 524gb more hard drive storage space ... d :, 
  actually , the video does n't seem to work , neither the onboard nor the video card .
