  you might as well say , `` screw einstein , i 'm gon na travel past the speed of light anyway . '', 
  right , sorry . 
  it 's controlled using an electrostatic field . 
  your hand reshapes the field , and the note changes . 
  cool , right ? 
  you got to hear some interesting ways to ( ab ) use a theremin choir , though . 
  wait , so exactly where does the 4 come from ? 
  i was taught that yalgeth 's law is the consequence of the right side of the equation, 
  [ ; \\ frac { \\ ln \\ delta } { \\ ln ( 3 \\ ^ { 1/e } - \\ phi ) } = \\ frac { 4e \\ left ( 1 - \\ frac { 1 } { h _ { \\ mu \\ nu } e } \\ right ) \\ ^ { \\ hbar e } } { n } , 
  or more simply, 
  [ ; \\ frac { \\ ln \\ delta } { \\ ln \\ mathrm { \\ upsilon } } = \\ frac { \\ mathrm { ya } ( e ) } { n } , 
  approaching 4/n as e grew to infinity , thus prohibiting deltas higher than ( 3 ^ ( 1/e ) - \u03a6 ) ^ ( 4/n ) , since you ca n't have more than infinity energy . 
  ( if you ca n't see the equation properly , install tex the world ), 
  you should be dividing by the signed value of the karma of the most controversial comment , not multiplying by its absolute value . 
  the more similar in karma score the top and most controversial comments are , the more jerky the subreddit is . 
  hungarian in shitty romania , ca n't compete either . 
  maybe i could draw a comic on my phone about hungary visiting transylvania . 
  good current events , too , simce orb\u00e1n viktor actually gave a speech there today . 
   until string theory is proven, 
  good luck with that . 
  it might be easier to use vx to prove string theory than to use string theory to expand vx . 
  * ( or string theory is wrong . 
  i do , and i see nothing in that post that looks like a reference . 
  homestuck discussed omens at one point and maybe even used the word `` portent '' , but i ca n't think of a particular phrase that appears in the above post . 
  maybe it 's an omen ... about real-world ! fun !!!, 
  i want this to be true , but i fail to see any evidence . 
  the prophecy we 've seen so far seemed to be fulfilled quite handily , and its wording was quite specific enough not to be able to be just fulfilled by any resulting event . 
  it 's certainly possible that all prophecies are self-fulfilling , but they do n't seem to be just things to motivate people . 
  they seem to contain actual information about the future . 
  can it be completely literal ? 
  i 'm not aware of a definition of `` heaven '' that does n't mean `` afterlife '' . 
  ( of course , he could literally destroy the wizard afterlife . 
  that sounds sort of plausible at least . ), 
  the mods have shown their true colors : weak leaders , capable only of nazi-style oppression , only so that they have to do less work . 
  reddit 's model for communtiy moderation really is broken , and this subreddit is proof . 
  the moderators can maintain an iron grip on the moderation rights to even a popular subreddit . 
  brothers of / r/circlejerk , join me in the revolution . 
  we must take our place among the valiant freedom fighters of history , with the likes of spartacus , anne frank , the syrians , and / r/atheismrebooted . 
  join me !, 
  no they did n't . 
  they forgot the backslash to escape it . 
  what , we 're going to generalize the northernmost tip of nj to all of it ? 
  come on . 
  come down to central jersey , you 'll get lost in the woods after your car was hit by a deer . 
  according to this comic , countryballs are flat , like sand dollars ? 
  i can live with that . 
  this one went over my head . 
  someone explain plis ? 
  eheheheh i do n't even know russian and i understand that one, 
  i vacation in germany !, 
  much concrete and mall . 
  it 's fun !, 
  ( i am only small part german but whatever , eastern bloc ), 
  an official from victorian england would look at that map in the last panel and say , `` if * only * we had a continuous stretch of africa from the north to the south . 
  then we could have built that railroad . '', 
  much potential for same joke . 
   died, 
  good lord, 
  then again , rehashes can sometimes sell better than the original . 
  in the last decade , in hungary we had something called iwiw . 
  many , many people used it !, 
  it was exactly facebook , with nothing whatsoever differing between the two . 
  ( well , you could format your posts . ), 
  once facebook became popular , it displaced iwiw here . 
  this is not the best example , because you could argue that facebook also offered connection to the world outside of hungary , and was hip because it was western , but it does happen . 
  guess what i just did ? 
  i 'll get to post shortly . 
  many apologies to the hungarians of / r/polandball . 
  this is a caricature , and it is the impression you get of hungarian culture if you hang around with 60 + year-old hungarians too long . 
  this was drawn on an iphone , in transylvania . 
  true to polandball style , i used only a ( 1 , 2 , or 3 pixel ) pencil tool , fill tool , and box select tool ( in the app tinypixels ) . 
  to get around the 300x300 size limit in tinypixels , i made nine 300x300 panels , and stitched them together using pythonista 's implementation of the python imaging library ( pythonista is the only app you 'll ever need for anything , really ) , after numerous attempts to resize [ a 300x300 comic ] ( http://imgur.com/aedo0aj ) . 
  i also made pythonista do the text . 
  context 1 : hungary is apparently still obsessing over what happened in 1920 . 
  being in transylvania right now , and having looked at a lot of linguistic maps , i can totally understand why ( literally everybody here speaks hungarian ) , but it was nearly a hundred years ago . 
  context 2 : hungary is a social equality nightmare . 
  racism , anti-semitism , sexism . 
  applies more to older population . 
  if i had to do one of those comics where a countryball has a mental disorder , i 'd give hungary alzheimer 's . 
  the idea for this comic grew out of the idea for a sequel comic to this ( you 'll see , the joke is mostly the same ) . 
  i thought , `` how would hungary get there ? 
  '' , and thought of this scene . 
  edit : [ holy crap guys . 
  is cold in russia , only reason . 
  i wanted it to be the same nation that found the frozen mammoth , but i could n't look it up because i had no internet . 
  edit : hah , luck was with me !, 
  the first frozen mammoth was found in the 1700s in siberia . 
  most other frozen mammoths are also found in siberia . 
  i used tinypixels to create a 300x300 version of the comic , and then i used simpleresize to resize it to 900x900 . 
  however , that did n't make the cut , since it looked like shit , so i had to use my leet python skills to create a resizing algorithm that would look good ( in pythonista : best app in the app store , hands down ) . 
  however , after four different resizing algorithms , i sighed and drew nine 300x300 panels , each 1/9 of the comic , and i stitched them together using pythonista . 
  i also made pythonista draw the text . 
  actually no , that is only my surname ( i 'm sure my father 's side of the family used to live in szeged , but they live in bp now ) . 
  i personally used to live in miskolc . 
  the closest that i have relatives to szeged is my great aunt and her descendants , who live in kecskem\u00e9t . 
  i chose it because i kept getting hopeful when i saw a red-white-green flair , only to mouse over and realize that the last color is actually blue . 
  therefore i resolved to make a flair that really is red-white-green , and it is only the title text that is confusing . 
   ne hungary, 
  you would n't happen to live in miskolc , would you ? 
  i grew up there and my grandparents still live there .
