  no , they wo n't like being given lower-value assignments , no , they wo n't like being told that they 're not the best programmer on earth , but i am * obliged * to do both things . 
  it 's my responsibility . 
  it saves a lot more time if you have many cases of beer to open , and it also saves you energy , because opening beer individually takes a bit of strength per beer . 
  [ insert list of burn centers that are not in germany ], 
  well , that 's exactly why it has to mimic alternian sunlight . 
  i just hope she has the spectrum on hand . 
  maybe ask vriska ? 
  ( she could probably approximate it with a fourier series ), 
  edit : oh , i bet aranea 'd know !, 
  whoah , this is the first time i 've expected a post to have a relevant xkcd comment , and it did n't have one . 
  good job , reddit !, 
  i support 3.5 over 4 , as do probably most of the people here . 
  we just think your attitude totally sucks . 
  you 're not smarter/better than people who like 4 , and we hate to see you think that . 
  this is the most realistic-looking picture of texts that i have ever seen on reddit . 
  no silly dragging it out , the top bar is very randomized and contains a semi-obscure phone service provider , and it 's relatively low resolution . 
  10/10 for realism, 
  i 'd rather not try to recreate 21 , heheheh, 
  more work , plus the waves would n't line up if you tried to naively copy rectangles from one pic to the other . 
  you 'd end up lassoing it , and that is a lot more work than a simple long exposure . 
  i do n't mind . 
  you get used to it from the pictures that go with the songs in the homestuck soundtrack albums . 
  i prefer to think of them as nordic [ berserkers ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/berserker ) . 
  i tell myself that if i had bigger hands , i 'd use emacs . 
  you 're fine !, 
  do * you * have big hands ? 
  try gvim . 
  it has as much of a gui as any other text editor . 
  i have the opposite problem . 
  i 'm used to vi being an alias for vim , but on my new os i have to type out vim to get vim . 
  you 'd think one character would n't make a lot of difference , but it annoys me to no end for some stupid reason . 
  ( yes , i 've tried putting an alias in my bashrc . ), 
  why are we being so hateful ? 
  yes , teeists are ignorant , and yes , a * small * minority of teeists is violent , but that does n't mean we should cheer whenever a teeist dies . 
  they are people , like us , and most likely not entirely terrible people , and most importantly , people who can * learn * . 
  remember , we 're supposed to be the bigger person here . 
  do n't hate . 
  educate . 
  what i do n't like about munroe 's interpretation is , why would anybody construct a whole language for a d&d book ? 
  are any of * our * d&d books written in constructed languages ? 
  ( maybe there are lotr tabletop game books written in one of the languages tolkien constructed ? ), 
  and cascade in particular, 
  with all our understanding of cognitive bias , we should understand that you have to be very , very rational to reject teeism and realize that golf is a terrible sport . 
  you grow up around golf , your parents and grandparents play golf , and you get taken to the country club every friday ... is it any wonder that you would then start to play golf ? 
  it 's a defect in the human brain , and it 's not their fault . 
  we should dedicate ourselves to defeating ignorance and spreading awareness . 
  so , quebec french is more french than french french ? 
  i totally understand . 
  i would do that if i were the cat , too . 
  this is why geologists are some of my favorite people . 
  `` you ca n't tell what kind of soil it is just by * looking * at it . 
  you need to * lick * it and see what it tastes like . '', 
  the time of his post is actually closer to the time of the post he replied to than the time of the post he replied to is to the time of the thread that he posted in . 
  no it 's just that my hands are n't the right size to hit all the modifier keys at once for emacs ( esc meta alt ctrl shift , as the saying goes ) , so i use vim . 
  just curious to see how you put up with it . 
    the narcissistic desire to share every last , inane detail about your life via social media . 
   ** ( +1830 , -378 ) ** and ** gold ** . 
  apparently , people on reddit do n't know that they can actually choose not to engage in twitter and facebook , or that you can hide people you do n't want to see . 
  let alone all the basement-dwellers who think the worst thing in life is learning trivial information about another human being 's life . 
  to be honest i do n't really understand why people are supposed to narrate their personal life out via facebook ( or twitter ) , either . 
  i do it , because otherwise my timeline would be rather empty , but i get this weird feeling of being entirely superfluous and boring when i 'm doing it . 
  i get a corresponding feeling of boredom when reading about anybody else 's personal life . 
  i guess in the first world , the average life is very not interesting . 
  it 's not a big deal to me because i only spend , like , 5 minutes tops on fb each day , unless i 'm having a discussion with someone , so it does n't have as much of an impact on me . 
  i think interesting facebook posts are those that are like , `` what are your thoughts on [ issue | event ] ? 
  '' , or `` hey guys look at this article i found !, 
  '' , or `` in case you did n't hear , [ event ] . 
  '' , or `` look what i made !, 
  '' , or `` can you guys help me with [ problem ] ? 
  '' , or `` have you heard of [ place | website ] ? 
  '' , or `` i went to [ exotic place ] , check out the photos ! '' . 
  the common theme in these is that you can learn from them , i think ( i 'm not sure ; i just noticed that after i compiled the list ) . 
  that 's a good , fun experience . 
  i wish i could create more content like that . 
  are you being hypocritical on purpose , to screw with us , or do you really not notice ? 
  the general implication of your comments so far has been , `` fuck anyone who likes 4 better than 3.5 ( i.e. , does n't like what i like ) '' ( see : `` disgusting '' , `` idiot 's '' ) , which is what you 're complaining about us doing to you . 
  you did indeed make a statement very much like `` i am smarter than people who like 4 . '', 
  you called it `` the idiot 's form of fun '' . 
  i 'm not sure how much more direct it could be than that . 
  we do n't hate you ( `` we hate to see you think that '' is a figure of speech , like `` we 'd hate to see something happen to you '' ) , and , i 've said so before , i personally like 3.5 better than 4 , and expect that the majority of people on this sub would agree with me and you about that . 
  the difference between us and you is that we do n't think people are idiots just for liking easier games ( besides , i do n't think `` easy '' is the main problem of 4 , more the fact that it restricts creativity ) , whereas you do . 
  that 's not very nice of you , and we do n't like it when people are n't nice . 
  therefore , we downvote you . 
  the best thing is that even if you walk sideways , you do n't trip , so you can enjoy the view and walk at the same time !, 
  yes , but dark matter galaxies are n't so interesting , because they have no em interaction , so they ca n't form molecules or anything similar . 
  we do n't predict any other forces to exist . 
  dark matter is apparently inert except for gravity ( and the weak force ) . 
  technically , it interacts with the higgs field , but that 's not too remarkable . 
  they 're just particles . 
  very heavy particles , but they 're particles . 
  they 're exotic in that they 're probably not in the standard model ( a case could be made for neutrinos , but they 're probably much too light ) ; they 're probably a very heavy superpartner of some existing particle . 
  they 're dark , in the sense that they do n't interact using em at all . 
  but that does n't mean that they do n't interact whatsoever . 
  we can see dark matter indirectly ( although not much more indirectly than we usually see stuff ) by seeing the gravitational lensing effects that large amounts of it creates . 
  it seems quebec ca n't win . 
  i feel sorry for you guys !, 
  any idea why quebec anglicization is at odds with french anglicization ? 
  i speak german and i very quickly realized that it was not german . 
  it 's something new ... something ** glorious **, 
  i do n't know , it 's more wtf than anything i 've seen there .
