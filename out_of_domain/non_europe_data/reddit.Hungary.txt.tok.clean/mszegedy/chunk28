  now i have , and it does n't work . 
  d : i 'm kind of relieved at that , because extracting my video card every time i wanted to see bios would have been a pain . 
  actually , i checked it with a monitor just now . 
  nothing . 
  wow , thank you !, 
  brilliant detectivery . 
  however , it did n't work . 
  d : what was weirder was that the moment i turned on the psu , the machine started up ... then afterwards it would n't start up when i bridged the power . 
  must have done something . 
  unfortunately , there 's nothing in that thread that helps ... but thank you for taking your time with this !, 
  thank you so much for helping me , i really appreciate it . 
  thank you !, 
  i have not tried the ip . 
  is this a joke , or is someone actually trying to market their server on this subreddit ? 
  literally ? 
  i do n't think i 'll ever see anyone do that ... 
  vacillation . 
  get it right !, 
  i think the oscillation could have started slower in that one . 
  much slower , in fact . 
  she makes * that * face a lot . 
  feels a bit shoehorned , but still really cute !, 
  oh , also , use a different font . 
  i 'm ambidextrous , and i craft to the left, 
  i always mess this recipe up . 
  this , and the bow . 
  the generated ones are completely unsolvable at multiple points . 
  that 's okay with me , but i 've found errors in much , much smaller mazes , so i have no hopes for this one . 
  i know !, 
  it was for this impenetrable fortress i was building . 
  almost completely impossible to break into , and mostly underground . 
  the surface level was an extremely well-boobytrapped , dimly lit maze , with lots of decoy rooms et cetera . 
  i was hoping it would take a while for the people to realize that they have to tunnel through walls . 
  the general attitude towards the government in hungary is like this . 
  defying the goverment ( `` korm\u00e1ny '' , or `` steering wheel '' ) , has come to be routine , in practically every aspect . 
  nearly everybody already hates him unusually much already , and nothing he says is going to make a whit of difference . 
  it might bring him on even terms with a minority of the populace , but it wo n't bring anyone around to his way of thinking , especially not when he 's not serious about it either . 
  hungary is n't like america , where there 's always someone with a weird-ass opinion on things who we can laugh at . 
  people are like-minded , and one is * compelled * to agree with them . 
  partially , this is simply because the population is n't high enough , but it 's more because of a general hivemindedness that applies to all hungarian people . 
  it 's a very interesting topic ; read `` a country [ full ? ], 
  of aliens : a briton in hungary '' for more examination of the topic . 
  as a mobile user of reddit , i am legitimately grateful for lmgtfy links . 
  it 's a lot more work to open up my browser , quit the window that 's already there , type in the google query , wait for the search page to load , * then * finally click , and wait for , the result i want . 
  do n't even * talk * to me about i 'm feeling lucky . 
  is this pseudocode ? 
  oh my god , those were such a fad on the forums ... 
  the election was before he did anything stupid . 
  ( he is mainly accused of selling us to the foreigners . ), 
  every month , this thread happens ... 
  nesed maor ~ ~ hmoelses poelpe ~ ~ ifwi otshposts, 
  smoene mod it noa, 
  no , that only happens in america . 
  the kicker is the `` another '' . 
  just ... terrible science , though . 
  this is on a massive scale , though , right ? 
  i just wonder what it would look like , `` standing '' on the surface ... 
  yes , it 's shifted into the red/yellow chromatic spectrum . 
  if it were left at its original colors , it would appear blindingly white . 
  to be fair , fire is also plasma . 
  that letter also has a dotted version , in , i think , telugu , as a ligature . 
  god dammit , another reminder that i should have gotten a modular psu and an nzxt case . 
  :d damn , that case ... 
  about to . 
  my grandfather wants fast and secure storage , and does n't actually need that much storage space . 
  i believe , the latter . 
  it may have just been my imagination ; i presently have severe jetlag , impeding my mental faculties . 
  ( one can tell this , because i speak thusly , and use an altogether inappropriate number of commas . ), 
  i fucking love the little guys , so damn cute, 
  all of them . 
  also , by the time you read this , hopefully the link will work !, 
  yup . 
  currently i 've pulled out the card and have tried onboard vga instead . 
  well ? 
  what you 're proposing here , unquestionably , is anarchy . 
  and i do n't like that . 
  it 's perfectly logical , and consistent with all other clinical nomenclature . 
  what quibble can one possibly have against such a regular moniker ? 
  holy moly , res tells me i 've upvoted you seven times . 
  what have you ever done to deserve it ? 
  what i mean is , you stated two qualities that are desirable above all others ... and you stated that the only way to ameliorate their position is to decrease law and order . 
  the absence of law and order is anarchy . 
  hence . 
  but it 's way less downvotes than norm !, 
  like , on any other subreddit , if i see a high-achieving comment , i can be sure that it has at least one or two downvotes . 
  but not here !, 
  entire threads can go practically without downvotes . 
  it 's , like , how does that even happen ? 
  this is not youtube . 
  the less downvotes there are , the less negative feelings are !, 
  and we want to reduce negative feelings .
