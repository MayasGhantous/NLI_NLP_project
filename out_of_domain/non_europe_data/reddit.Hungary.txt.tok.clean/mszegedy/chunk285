  option 3 : look in between the couch folds, 
  option 4 : [ maybe thteres a theif ? 
  edit : option 5 : have jane resurrect her ? 
  i mean w/m/l , yes . 
  that 's three whole platforms , that you have to port to as a developer , so that three whole groups of people can play it . 
  yes , but internally you audiate [ io ] altogether for each < \u0438\u043e  , which , if you do n't add a stop to make two syllables , is a diphthong basically equivalent to [ jo ] . 
  plus , [ jo ] could canonically be < \u0439\u043e  or < \u0451  anyway , and there 's not a huge orthographic difference between the former and < \u0438\u043e  ( granted , you 'd use < \u0451  , but it 's still notable that all you need to get canonical [ jo ] is put a single ha\u010dek on each word ) . 
  edit : also , we 're already fudging by considering [ jo ] equivalent to [ jo\u028a ] . 
  my entire mother 's side of the family does the first thing ( `` no , the place you gave us is * not * okay '' ) at hotels . 
  no , the view is bad . 
  no , this room is tiny . 
  i 'll bet they gave us the less good rooms because there 's few of us . 
  no , we want our rooms * next * to each other ... 
  it takes an hour . 
  that 's true ; and , depending on what you 're writing , it 's the same way for several other engines/languages . 
  java , for example , usually runs perfectly cross-platform out of the box . 
   i 'm also not saying rammstein was n't treated unjustly . 
  took me a split second to figure that out . 
  what was the point of this comment ? 
  signaling that you know german ? 
  ( also , to be a pedant , `` ich '' should n't be capitalized ), 
  edit : come on , we all have complaints ... this is one of mine . 
  for the record , i still do n't understand what 's so great about that comment , so i 'd appreciate it if somebody would tell me ( preferably somebody who does n't think i 'm this terrible asshole who thinks he 's above reddit 's humor ) . 
  sorry , i fixed that in an edit ; you must have loaded the page before i did that . 
  i do see the connection , but what was the point of translating that particular comment ? 
  or do we have to have this entire thread in german now ? 
  why even bother translating anything into german ? 
  does this mean i 'll get karma if , any time we discuss anything related to germany , i translate a random comment into german and post it as a ftfy ? 
  that would be so pointless . 
  lol , you did n't have to change it ; it was n't ambiguous or nonsense . 
  thank you for taking the time to do so though . 
  lion 's mane jelly i think ... 
  i 'm not sure though ; there 's a lot of different medium-size reddish jellyfish . 
  i 've touched the bell of a lion 's mane jelly before , it did n't sting . 
  what might have happened with yours was that that jelly 's tentacles previously wrapped around the bell for whatever reason ( turbulent water ? 
  ) , and the stinging cells rubbed off and on to the bell . 
  i 'm trying to break my habit of browsing / r/all , but i hope it 'll get better as everybody goes back to school . 
  i 'm going to try this translating into german thing next time germany comes up , though . 
  any ideas for `` out of grad school with a phd '' besides `` go be a postdoc and apply for faculty positions '' ? 
  ( i do n't have my phd yet , but nearly ), 
  what do you mean `` just do you '' ? 
  good job , you might have actually saved a lot of other peoples ' money/time . 
  looks pretty ... * edgy * . 
  especially with those tiles . 
  it 's so cool , yet so superfluous . 
  just curious , why could n't you make the thirty days ? 
  i know i 'm sometimes very forgetful , and sometimes halfway around the globe for an engagement , but 30 days is a lot of wiggle room . 
  i wonder if you could have called them on the thirtieth day saying , `` sorry i have n't come yet ; could you please hold on to my mother 's ashes for a few days ? '', 
  i do n't think it 's funny , i just want to see whether it really works reliably . 
  ( by `` works '' i mean reddit likes it . ), 
  meanwhile in hungary : `` stand on escalators in crowds as thick as possible '', 
  hungary here , same thing unfortunately . 
  someone should give the eastern bloc a lesson in manners . 
  edit : i am stupid , belgium is not of the eastern bloc . 
  oh well , still applies . 
  then why is n't this an nsfw subreddit ? 
  you know , like / r/imgoingtohellforthis or / r/gonewild , in which every post is nsfw . 
  if your subreddit has the option to add nsfw , i think you should use that option appropriately . 
  i 'll let you know if it does , if you want . 
  ( seriously , i 'm still surprised that anybody would post a comment like that and it would be liked . 
  i 'm convinced it 's just a fluke . ), 
  if the rope wraps helically , there 's no buildup , but if it wraps spirally , there is buildup . 
  realistically , it 's a combination of the two , with there being a finite number of helical turns that can fit on the post before you have to wrap spirally , as well as some spiral wrapping that happens anyway as the rope crosses over itself . . 
  this calls for the scientific method . 
  yeah , i 'm calling / r/hailcorporate on this one, 
  op probably does . 
  i do n't think op is stupid . 
  we 've already forgotten about ben affleck , yay ? 
  to be fair postdocing and subsequently professoring is not bad at all . 
  i just want to know what working for those mythical private companies is like . 
  not true , flounders are very tasty , especially with lemon . 
  having lived in both nj and ca , i can totally believe their respective search terms . 
  nj i ca n't put my finger on why , but ca has a large asian population that i can totally believe would search for asian porn . 
  heck i 've lived in america for years and i still ca n't find kentucky on a map . 
  i agree , but would a state being full of milfs really make it search for milfs ? 
  apparently . 
  great job security , lots of research , lots of authority ... but not much money . 
  oh well , who needs that anyway, 
  thank you !, 
  not to sound like a smartass , but i already got the tip from the several answers already posted , though . 
  yes , that 's what the stinging cells are called ( in case somebody is not sure what you 're referring to ; i 'm sure that * you * know what nematocysts are ) . 
  as someone whose family is from europe and has lived in europe a majority of the time , the way i 've always been able to tell apart austria from anywhere else is that it looks like a chicken thigh . 
  ( it is a rocket chicken thigh . 
  switzerland is the flames . ), 
  [ europe is not impressed with your cartographic chicken legs . 
  wow i find that really funny too ... 
  i guess the funny part is that computers are n't bananas . 
  like naming a dog `` cat '' . 
  like in eight-bit theater !, 
  `` where are we ? '', 
  `` up my a-hole . '', 
  yay , a good social message got to the top of reddit !, 
  i am so proud of us . 
  large enough spheres may be approximated as planes . 
  since planes are impossible to grasp , this implies that large enough spheres are approxomately impossible to grasp . 
  your mother is probably a large enough sphere . 
  ... did i do explaining the joke right ? 
  [ l\u03b5d r\u03b5d ], 
  for maximum clarity, 
  ( yes i know english r is an approximant not a trill , but i 'm on mobile and i 'm not gon na copy/paste from wikipedia just for this comment ; meanwhile , i have a greek keyboard on hand for [ \u03b5 ] ),
