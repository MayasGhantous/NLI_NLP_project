  ~ ~ depends on gender . ~ ~ sorry , i 'm already in a relationship . 
  the thing is , in his universe , john died before he could ecto all of the kids up . 
  so , they could n't even come into existence in the first place . 
  hence , the fundamental reason why it was doomed . 
  what if just the ends of the towers were stretchy ? 
  well , i was thinking like this :, 
  = = = hhhhh = = = = = = = / ~ / = = = = = = = = hhhhh = = =, 
  naturally , '' = '' is solid , and `` h '' is stretchy . 
  does anyone know how i could build a transmitter for these frequencies ? 
  it 'd be fun and handy to open my garage with my laptop . 
  unfortunately , i do n't know any which are that in-depth as to include that sort of information . 
  :( but i can tell you that that one is youtube-specific , and perceived as obnoxious to some degree on the site itself and unquestionably so everywhere outside of it . 
  edit : actually , [ this one ] ( http://www.albion.com/netiquette/book/index.html ) looks pretty good . 
  no guarantee it has the information you 're looking for , though . 
  oh , of course !, 
  let 's see , if there 's a nigh-infinite number of dream-bubbles , then it would take ... approximately ... carry the six ... infinity acts to show them all ( aleph null , to be precise ) . 
  homestuck : act 273859392636392746463893764638393957575 , act 4839395775745744 : timeline fgtgiidfnlppyrefjifdnotdvhi : tavros, 
  no , that would not work out . 
  is this an injoke i 'm not aware of ? 
  i never understood the `` 48-player squiddle session '' reference . 
  i know that a 48-player session spawned the pre-scratch troll universe , but how does this relate to squiddles , who , as far as i understand , symbolize the noble circle of horrorterrors ? 
  how do * you * pronounce `` cliche '' ? 
  i 'm on alien blue , so i do n't see your unruly comic sans !, 
  take that !, 
  i hope not . 
  but still , i was wondering if you did it with an silent `` c '' or something ... 
  i remember that one !, 
  so that 's where i started all , huh ... 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/gwexdg7n7zg ), 
  but , like with a vowel . 
  `` uhleesh '' ? 
  thank you !, 
  i was wondering about this . 
  `` lost '', 
  does punching work ? 
  the article is confusing . 
  no , mlg yadda yadda was the builder , not the griefer . 
  this was made before shears were added ? 
  or he just does n't have iron , i dunno . 
  [ / circlejerk ] actually , they 're texels . 
  [ circlejerk ], 
  see , it 's funny because neutrons have no electromagnetic charge ... 
  ... terrorist ? 
  `` in this permutation of that particular timeline paradigm , only gamzee ascended to godtier , and tavros is missing his left index finger as well as his pinky . 
  next week , watch us examine the permutation in which the middle scar on gamzee 's face is two centimetres below the standard baseline ! '', 
  i have hit just the right ratio of shipping/not caring that i both had romantic irons in the fire , and was completely unaffected by this update . 
  sorry for being so dense , but i need a translation . 
  what letter did he accidentally ? 
  pretty spot-on , but the condesce needs to look more menacing !, 
  i 'm more familiar with the `` leaky pipes '' model . 
  yes . 
  this !, 
  i found rage the hardest wherefor wherewith to come up . 
  edit : ... aaaaand that sentence still ended in a preposition . 
  fuck it . 
  wurt ? 
  sollux saw ( heard , whatever ) the doom of the trolls . 
  me too . 
  i spent a lot of time thinking about them !, 
  page was added last , by process of elimination . 
  what did john drew ? 
  hussie does n't like us ? 
  i am considering changing it to `` knowing '' . 
  the problem is phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs . 
  fuck phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs . 
  what sort of high-level control did sollux have over doom ? 
  you probably know this , but it 's based on the pool term . 
  but i agree with you about english , even if it does make a really fun internet language . 
  but i 'd categorise c as useless , not finicky . 
  it 's kinda stupid because both k and c were originally used to represent / k / . 
  so why have both ? 
  because fuck you that 's why . 
  me too . 
  and , if we replace th and ph with those letters , then how will you be able to tell if a word is of greek origin ? 
  if i may say so , mine as well . 
  is this a meme now ? 
  i 'd buy as many albums as possible , but that 's just me . 
  as far as i understand , they know about mortal kombat , but not the snes . 
  however , the inverse is still a reasonable cause for liking a game . 
  you never listed hungarian !, 
  :o everyone always forgets about us . 
  that 's okay !, 
  :d it 's spelled `` anan\u00e1sz '' in it anyway , but pronounced the same ( because `` sz '' is pronounced `` s '' , while `` s '' is pronounced `` sh '' ; because german ) . 
  i thought maybe that was why you did n't include it !, 
  k , thanks , was n't sure whether people were joking or in earnest and wanting eridan to come back , that douche . 
  he 's lying !, 
  no one on reddit has a moirail !, 
  this merits at least * two * upvotes . 
  take my karma, 
  you know what then ? 
  i 'll have to rewrite some stuff though . 
  d : but it will make sense this way !, 
  see above , in the other mage thread !, 
  after reading your post , i reconsidered the assignments and switched some stuff around . 
  mage is now passive to witch . 
  i originally intended for this to be pen and paper , but it got so complex and difficult to compute that i decided to hand over * some * responsibilities to the computer , but eventually i decided to make the whole thing virtual because by then the * worlds * were being generated by the computer . 
  so voil\u00e0 . 
  i expected this post to be karma suicide ... 
  mother, 
  jury,
