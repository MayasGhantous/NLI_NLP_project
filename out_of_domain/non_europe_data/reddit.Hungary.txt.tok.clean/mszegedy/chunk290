  does it not need direct connection to the launchpad , similar to the hex cans ? 
  also , how do you get that big launchpad ? 
  all i have is launchpad 2 , which is half useless because there is no space for docking ports . 
  and , to clarify , the clamps magically staying in the air means that no matter how precariously the launchpad is built , and no matter how heavy the ship , the launchpad will not get crushed , right ? 
  in that case , i may have to try and build a space elevator , because that would be awesome . 
  even if it can get hotter than that , 30 \u00b0 c is hot . 
  it makes you sweat and if you stand in direct sunlight it gets unbearable . 
  all that happens after that is that it gets even worse later on , climbing up to as much as 40 \u00b0 c. 
  that 's when you wish for death . 
  this is a paper for very * rich * middle-aged men , apparently . 
  ^ ( i mean seriously they 're even literate . ), 
  i did n't play video games as a kid , but i sure as hell could n't figure out which channel was the vcr . 
  protip to whoever made this : `` paprika '' has no diacritics . 
  but ... that was a good book !, 
  you should have picked something else ... although i ca n't figure out what ( even atlas shrugged is useful on occasion ) . 
  it 's a translation from latin . 
  you 're a monk or something . 
  wow , congratulations !, 
  that is impressive . 
  i do n't like xkcd much , but even that is funnier than this . 
  now try it on mun . 
  wow , that middle mouse button thing is gold . 
  i have to try this out . 
  oh , hue hue hue i did n't even notice that pun !, 
  although seaborgium is kind of very not stable enough to be used like that . 
  are you a lisp programmer ? 
  i know you 're an astrophysics major , but still have to point out : you 're not a math major , apparently . 
  i minored in physics ( because of the math ) , and if i had to do it again differently , i 'd minor in math . 
  there is no way that a deeper understanding of the universe is worth the pain i had to go through . 
  physics notation can go fuck itself . 
  / r/unnecessarygif, 
  edit : actually , no . 
  i like his motions . 
  but this is not a well-made gif . 
  how then , does one improve on it ? 
  i 'm actually a biomedical engineering major . 
  ( i tried to double major with chem eng but it did n't work out . ), 
  it 's the entire rest of my family who are math majors , though , so i did have much exposure anyway via limitless amounts of textbooks . 
  i think you hit the nail on the head , though . 
  there 's a huge amount of math , mostly resting on a load of proofs , and a subsection of it that you can use on physics ( and garble the fucking notation while you 're at it ) because it happens to look like physics . 
  you 've got motivation there : `` i 'm gon na use this math because , see ? 
  this corresponds to this , and this corresponds to this . 
  do some stuff and bam , analytical solution . '', 
  the rest , only mathematicians give a shit about , because you have to define them in terms of other math stuff . 
  intentional ? 
  what best illustrates it is i think [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1isizb/question_on_fourier_series/cb7nz17 ) post , by an obvious math major . 
  `` it 's better if you do n't think about it like an engineer . 
  think of it using group theory instead . '', 
  it 's not saying that ( it 's only saying that being able to read and being a train are mutually exclusive , but it does n't say that you ca n't both not be able to read and not be a train ) , but it does leave as an open question whether blind people are trains . 
  does n't that teach someone to form false dichotomies , though ? 
  most of the time there are more options than two . 
  go say hello !, 
  also how baba yaga reproduces . 
  i was like `` well this is going to go over terribly '' , but when i opened up the comment thread i found that the train had already wrecked itself . 
  i back reddit 's opinion , myself , except for the fact that they downvoted op . 
  what the fuck ? 
  why ? 
  it 's like simultaneously arguing with someone and punching them in the face . 
  you 're lucky . 
  i find scratches in my screens , and always try to wipe them off . 
  this happens to me with my keyboard . 
  unfortunately , it remains sticky even after i wash the keyboard . 
  well , you 'd love it . 
  the syntax at the very least . 
  in the russian folk tale , she has tree trunks for legs . 
  ( the scp article might say so too ; i only skimmed it . ), 
  edit : arms . 
  tree trunk arms . 
  yes , but that 's a tiny minority of cases . 
   binding of isaac, 
  have you played super meat boy ? 
  the music was made by the same guy . 
  ( and they have a lot in common besides . ), 
  unfortunately i happen to be looking for such a thing myself . 
  i 've heard good things about [ `` python for lisp programmers '' ] ( http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html ) , but it does n't really say anything about how lisp syntax works or about how to deal with functional languages . 
  then there is [ `` to lisp or not to lisp '' ] ( http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/to-lisp-or-not-to-lisp ) , but then that one does n't actually * teach * any lisp , just talks about lisp . 
  a complete , proper lisp text would be [ * practical common lisp * ] ( http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/ ) , but it 's kind of long ( although on the short side ) . 
  on the other hand , there 's [ `` learn lua in fifteen minutes '' ] ( http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/ ) , and [ `` learn perl in about 2 hours and 30 minutes '' ] ( http://qntm.org/perl ) , which have taught me lua and perl respectively . 
  at least they are shoveling the plot along . 
  i 'll bet if they were n't mind-controlled things would have gone badly quickly . 
  there 's a lot of untold stories in homestuck . 
  in my fanfic , for example , i tried to complete the homestuck cosmology , giving sburb origins . 
  this is absolutely not the best example , since it 's more an expansion of canon rather than an inward extension . 
  but you get the idea : stories compatible with canon , that happened inside of it . 
  damn , made me look . 
  no , polish . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's a pretty okay 2-second summary . 
  `` a linear combination of periodic functions of different periods makes a more complex function '' is how i would have described it , albeit slightly oversimplified . 
  and that , my friends , is how you make napalm . 
  her house has chicken legs , as far as i know . 
  and maybe it 's her arms that are the trunks ? 
  damn , i ca n't remember anything . 
  whoa , lithobraking is an actual term . 
  i thought it was just a ksp analogy to aerobraking ( although mixing latin and greek roots as far as i can tell ) . 
  not sure if faking schizo ? 
  i think faking . 
  as a former cashier , fuck that guy . 
  it 's not about that . 
  the machine does n't have a * slot * for $ 2 bills .
