  this used to be the # 1 most known thing about romans . 
  interesting how it 's not really taught anymore . 
  the point of fecal transplants is that they 're probiotic ; you get back fecal bacteria that you might have been missing . 
  there is little overlap between dog fecal bacteria and human fecal bacteria . 
  i really do n't like the voiceless dental fricative . 
  i do n't know why . 
  it sounds so stupid to me !, 
  edit : do n't blame me , my first language was hungarian !, 
  we do n't have it . 
  my irony detector does n't work through the internet ; i should make a new one . 
  ^ ( i wonder whether there have been any attempts to program ais that can distinguish between sarcastic statements and sincere statements ? 
  i 'm sure there have . ), 
  i have , but i think it might have been metaphorical . 
  also , we ca n't exactly say devastating things , either . 
  yes , i know all of that ; i thought my comment at least showed that . 
  what i am saying is that heatsinks are traditionally stacked much more thoroughly . 
  while convection and radiation might work differently , the amount of both are quadratically related with surface area . 
  therefore you 'd expect convection heatsinks to be driven by nearly the same design principles as radiation heatsinks . 
  convection heatsinks are much more thoroughly finned than this , to maximize surface area . 
  why did they fin this much less ? 
  is it so that photons do n't get reabsorbed by nearby heatsink plates ? 
  i do n't really buy that . 
  then again , i ca n't see what other function they would serve . 
  okay , that makes sense . 
  thank you for looking up the diagram and the q&a , they were interesting and informative . 
  ( although , i * did * know that it worked by radiation , not convection ; i was just doubtful that there would be any significant difference in the designs . ), 
  yeah , that 's what i figured , too . 
  i 'm sure there 's whole textbooks on this !, 
  there you go !, 
  but ... he 's attracted to males only . 
  oh , right . 
  heheheheheh . 
  technically it was their navy flag ^ ( but whatever , what 's important is what it represents to the people who see it ), 
  i 've only heard about candy crush on reddit . 
  i pronounce it more worse : `` oo-krahy-nuh '', 
  * it 's fun *, 
  ^ ^ disclaimer : ^ ^ i ^ ^ am ^ ^ only ^ ^ part ^ ^ german, 
  as a biomedical engineer , my work nearly never requires allen wrenches , but i * still * own a large set . 
  at least you do n't get shocked when you touch a crt . 
  edit : wait shit , other way around . 
  crts shock , lcds do n't , is what i meant . 
  i find it harder to * orbit * than land on mun . 
  no , not even circularly . 
  just , like , at all . 
  - theft, 
  - wait until they are vintage , buy one on ebay, 
  that 's what a comma splice is : two sentences spliced together with a comma . 
  it 's considered ungrammarful in english ( and personally , i think it 's aesthetically unpleasing ) . 
   you do n't learn physics in the historical way . 
  we start right off with calculus using leibniz notation , not bothering to fiddle around with fluxons or whatever weird system i 'm sure galileo used . 
  newton 's notation comes in handy occasionally , to denote time derivatives . 
  landau & lifschitz is full of it . 
  irrelevant , the amount of x-rays emitted by the sun would overwhelm anything we sent through it . 
  but the syntax is dead simple , unless you want half-complicated stuff like tables , figures , or code !, 
  it 's nearly always ` \\ command [ opt-argument ] { argument } ` , and you only need , like , four different commands for a complete document ( sans title ; it jumps to seven if you do ) :, 
  \\ documentclass [ 12pt , a4 ] { article }, 
  \\ usepackage [ margin = 1cm ] { geometry }, 
  \\ begin { document }, 
  % your text here, 
  \\ end { document }, 
  the rest is just googling for a particular feature . 
  a small necrotic patch . 
  or someone took a course that covered the subject ( it could be anything from ancient greek to ancient greek mythology to ancient greek history ) . 
  i wonder if she could just steal the ring . 
  not doing anything voidy , just something roguey . 
  and that word is unvocabulariful . 
  i am a biomedical engineer , i know that figures are something that one uses a lot . 
  but if you are writing an essay as an undergrad , you are not going to need figures , usually . 
  the most dw-like thing to do i think would be to hyperedit it to places . 
  he 's a point mass . 
  that 's awesome , i totally should have told my friends that as a kid . 
  maybe i can still dad-troll my kids . 
  * why * is this so bad at porn ? 
  i thought imgur was full of porn !, 
  it happens . 
  once i fell down several stairs with an open laptop , and did n't break it because i tucked into a roll . 
  i need to improve my reading comprehension . 
  ohhh , that makes sense . 
  thank you !, 
  that is very much not the point in any way . 
  it 's irrelevant whether the word previously existed or not , what 's relevant is that it sounds like `` legos '' , and the product is fulfilling a function similar to legos . 
  that said , i do n't think there 's any way lego could win a suit against them . 
  adorableness of murder = adorableness of murderer - ( adorableness of victim ) ^ ( 3 ) / ( adorableness of murderer ) ^ 2, 
  yes . 
  yeah , i play the `` guess the function based on your five years each of two dead languages '' game whenever i see a word i do n't know , and my thought process was as follows :, 
  it must be derived from the latin word `` pietas '' , from which we get `` piety '' . 
  maybe the cell ( s ) form ( s ) a cross shape , or some other recognizable religious symbol . 
  but wait , `` pietas '' actually means faithfulness/honor/loyalty . 
  maybe the cells get enslaved ? 
  wow that would be so cool if one monocellular organism could do that to another , like , rewire the dna expression and everything to get the cell to do stuff for it ... of course !, 
  viruses do that !, 
  that 's literally what a virus does !, 
  but would we still call it an - osis ? 
  - osises are actions that cells do . 
  i guess so , since getting enslaved is what the cell is doing . 
  okay i have decided that i am going to watch a gif of a cell getting infected and taken over by a virus . 
  this will be great !, 
  \\* clicks \\*, 
  ... damn , i guess it was crosses after all . 
  wait a minute .
