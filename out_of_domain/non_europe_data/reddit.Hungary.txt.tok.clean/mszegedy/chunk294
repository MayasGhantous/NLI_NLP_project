  god dammit, 
  but then it does n't phonetically resemble `` mitosis '' . 
  both 're fine . 
  i can understand them . 
  so can everyone else . 
  new jersey and hungary , alternatingly . 
  why is `` could n't care less '' superior in any way to `` could care less '' ? 
  yes , i am aware of the different things they mean when the words are processed individually , but you still got the message that op did n't care when he said `` could care less '' , did n't you ? 
  in that sense , they both mean the same thing : `` do n't care '' . 
  so why is there any more inherent value in one sequence of words than the other ? 
  most of sub-saharan african have piles upon piles of noun classes , which is also similar . 
  the mun has no atmosphere , so it 's harder to lithobrake onto it than it is to aerobrake onto duna . 
  that said , i think landing on the mun is easier than orbiting anything besides kerbol , a view which i think few people here share . 
  ohh , okay . 
  in what way did taking diff eq help you in understanding this paper ? 
  ( genuinely want to know ), 
  i 'm not exactly asking `` why do you need good grammar ? 
  '' , which is what i got from your post ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  i 'm asking , `` what makes wrong language wrong ? '' . 
  ( it 's rhetorical , though ; it does n't . ), 
  okay , maybe someone who is n't familiar with those phrases ( which is few people indeed ) wo n't understand them . 
  * but that 's literally every word or phrase you have n't learned yet . 
  * for example , dictionary.com 's word of the day is `` fleer '' . 
  have you heard it before ? 
  do you know what it means ? 
  do most people know what it means ? 
  but that does n't stop it from being used to mean what it does ( `` to grin or laugh coarsely or mockingly '' ) . 
  that 's not in any way different than `` i could care less '' or `` all intensive purposes '' . 
  or anyway , became popular/mainstream . 
  i think it 's the mouse . 
  i know ( @ landing in the dark ) , i 've done it tons of times !, 
  ( most of them failures ; this was before i knew about quicksave ) thank you for the rest of the tips though . 
  i figured orbiting the mun before landing would n't be so great , because i 'd have all this stupid lateral momentum i 'd need to take care of , though . 
  it 's called `` paracusia '' . 
  what do you mean ? 
  burger prescriptivist !, 
  next thing you know , you 'll be telling me my bread needs to be made of organic material !, 
  but seriously , language is a thing that goes on between people , not something inscribed into the universe by the hand of god . 
  we only document it , not mark parts of it as `` right '' or `` wrong '' . 
  marking it wrong , now * that 's * wrong . 
  the point of teaching you english grammar and vocabulary was so that people could understand you , not so that you could `` correct '' other people about their grammar or vocabulary . 
  maybe huss forgot to make her eyes white ? 
  it 's happened before . 
  ( in [ s ] roxy : dream ), 
  it 's entirely certain that a relationship does not exist . 
  particle physics did n't even become a field until the 20th century . 
  it probably makes some sort of pattern on the numpad . 
  absence of evidence * is * evidence of absence . 
  if there * were * evidence , you 'd consider it likely that it happened , since there is evidence . 
  there is no evidence , and ... you 're considering that it happened likely anyway ? 
  does the existence of evidence not matter to you ? 
  under the vast majority of real-life circumstances , a cause may not reliably produce signs of itself , but the absence of the cause is even less likely to produce the signs . 
  the absence of an observation may be strong evidence of absence or very weak evidence of absence , depending on how likely the cause is to produce the observation . 
  the absence of an observation that is only weakly permitted ( even if the alternative hypothesis does not allow it at all ) , is very weak evidence of absence ( though it is evidence nonetheless ) . 
  that 's not even the case , though , here ; most ancient civilizations left a ton of evidence behind of themselves , and it all points to , `` we would be surprised by what newton has to say !, 
  '' , rather than , `` we are advanced particle physicists !, 
  from the same page : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_from_ignorance#matters_of_confusion, 
  absence of evidence is evidence of absence when the only time evidence appears is when the phenomenon appears . 
  then it can be assumed that when evidence does * not * appear , the phenomenon is * not * present , by contraposition . 
  this is the case here . 
  do you realize the ramifications it would have today if particle physics had been discovered that early ? 
  you need to know relativity , quantum mechanics , group theory , calculus . 
  you need to be familiar with the original classical mechanics to derive * those * from . 
  that means that this ancient civilization would not only have to have all of the physics equipment necessary for particle physics ( which could maybe conceivably end up getting `` lost '' , if all they had were a few cyclotrons and spectrographs ) , but the physics equipment for * everything else it 's built on * , as well as all the technology derived from it : electricity , for one , but there 's little chance they would n't also have invented the atomic bomb . 
  these would have an impact on the archaeological record . 
  they would also need copious amounts of mathematical literature as well . 
  even if the civilization itself somehow spontaneously combusted , no civilization exists in a vacuum . 
  the knowledge , at the very least its rudiments such as calculus , would disseminate among surrounding civilizations , especially among arab scribes who absorbed most of classical western knowledge sponge-like before and after the roman empire caved in on itself . 
  yet , the highest knowledge of mathematics , let alone physics , that the ancient world can attest to , is that in northern india they nearly discovered calculus in the few hundred ads . 
  the highest knowledge of physics that the ancient world can attest to is aristotle 's lackluster assessment of the composition of matter , and incorrect ideas about motion . 
  that is so , so far removed from being able to do something as fundamental as derive the dirac equation . 
  so , * yes * , there would necessarily be huge historical consequences if some ancient civilization had gotten as far as particle physics . 
  by the absence of these consequences , i conclude that no ancient civilization discovered particle physics . 
  i am so sorry for you . 
  sweet jesus you 're an awful dude, 
  okay , this comment chain stops here . 
  please go and take your lack of understanding of history elsewhere . 
  or , if you do n't , i want no part in it . 
  it 's hard to resist , and sometimes kind of fun to watch for other people . 
  but yeah i 'm not replying any more to this guy ; his last reply to me was , paraphrased , `` i did n't read your comment and you 're stupid '' . 
  `` i had to have this device called a `` halo '' screwed into my skull for the entirety of ... '', 
  \\* line break \\*, 
  '' ... the summer to keep my neck supported and to keep it from moving . '', 
  thank god , i was really worried for you for a second there !, 
  although i 'm sure a whole summer of that shit must have sucked really badly . 
  wait , did no one accompany him because he did n't want them to , or because they did n't want to ? 
  if the latter , that 's surprising . 
  i know i 'd want to , and i ca n't be alone . 
  i was n't going to reply , but wow , that is actually pretty spot-on . 
  i 'm glad we part understanding each other . 
  well , it 's not human-designed ( structurally always , informatically nearly all the time ; of course genetic engineering is a thing ) , so there 's that . 
  but think about the amount of people who do n't know about/care about/want to bother with mods . 
  they exist , and there 's a lot of them ; probably the vast majority of users , even . 
  it 's sad that they 're not experiencing the game as well as they could . 
  these people , too , deserve to enjoy the game . 
  free porn , although shitty porn . 
   erbal space program, 
  in what way is it different from ksp ? 
  it 's something ? 
  psychically,
