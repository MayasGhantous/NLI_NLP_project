  i usually send a cupola and a hitchhiker module . 
  or , if i need to rescue 4 or 5 kerbals , i send a 3 man and a hitchhiker , with the 3 man controlled by only one kerbal . 
  if i want to rescue 6 + kerbals , i use multiple hitchhiker modules , and robotically control the craft . 
  i do n't think a lander can would work , since it would disintegrate upon reentry . 
   working on a linux-related thing, 
  try teleporting them to a plane with impeded magic , and then putting some really nasty monsters in front of them . 
  my personal favorite are radioactive elementals , which , by house rules , can do up to 6d6 damage per round , and poison besides . 
  ( i made elementals chemical elements instead of traditional elements . ), 
  incidentally , that 's approximately the empirical fatality rate of life . 
  ( disclaimer : i know very little about modern music , and late 20th century american pop culture . 
  i recognized one reference , and that was it . ), 
  like , as in rufio 's catchphrase from * hook * ? 
  the 30th rule of stephen wolfram is that a cell only lives when there 's exactly one live cell above it , or when the upper center cell and the cell to the upper right are both live , but not the upper left cell . 
  i 've always felt that that argument is a little wrong . 
  you need to compare the wages/salaries of the game buyers in the area , not the wages/salaries of everyone in the area . 
  i 'd bet that the average aussie gamer makes roughly the same amount as the average american gamer , if a little higher . 
  usually i 'm like `` haha you 're warning me that it 's a tvt link , that 's cute , i absorbed the wiki a long time ago '' , but it 's past midnight and i am fucking stupid for taking 7am classes , so i 'll actually avoid this one . 
  `` pebble '' was a bit of a stretch . 
  that brought to mind an image of a * very * huge baguette . 
  you say q like it 's `` correct '' , but all it is is a translation convention . 
  we could come up with a romanization system for arabic that spells \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0630\u0627\u0641\u064a as `` zqfmgb '' or something . 
  it 's completely arbitrary . 
  i do n't think it 's wrong to use a convention that romanizes \u0642 as `` g '' , especially since `` g '' represents the same phoneme to english speakers as the phoneme '' \u0642 '' represents to libyan arabic speakers . 
  transcription convention . 
  this . 
  do n't support oracle !, 
  in an article about binding * two * photons together , at a low energy . 
  i hate sensationalism , but this goes beyond anything that i 've ever seen . 
  aw man , for the first couple of sentences i thought it 'd be a glueball . 
  oh well , photon-balls are great too , although this does n't really qualify as one . 
  also does anyone else think it 's pretty ironic that atoms are mediating the interaction between photons ? 
  like , that 's material for comedy , there . 
  : s why would he say something like that ? 
   - jack, 
  like a car jack , or what ? 
   considering the english are the only nation to have fought wars to keep people on drugs, 
  maybe . 
  the opium wars are certainly a thing that happened that they 're famous for . 
  but there could have been other events that are n't so famous . 
  edit : [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1n51rl/aside_from_the_opium_wars_have_any_other_wars/ ), 
  beeth, 
  are you kidding ? 
  everyone knows it 's red that 's the fastest color . 
  but it is n't . 
  they managed to bond two photons together through a rubidium medium . 
  a lightsaber is very hot and bright staff ( canonically `` made of light '' ) . 
  given the low energies involved , and the need for a near-absolute zero medium , this is nothing like a lightsaber in any way . 
  it 's more like if they managed to stick two motes of dust together by submerging them in water . 
  could you please explain it ? 
  separate tabs for propulsion and fuel , please !, 
  and separate tabs for structure and decoupling . 
  i thought of that one too , but i mean a war where a nation wants a particular group of people to be on drugs , and so wages war on them , like britain in the opium wars . 
  no , they should be chanting a spell to save france . 
  edit : i accidentally just listened to the whole * wicked * album, 
  heck , high school , or middle school . 
  yes , the mosquito is a perfect analogy for my relative size with respect to society . 
  i 'm pretty sure the amount of money that costs per minute is more than that of a trip to mars and back . 
  i do n't even agree with this image , and do n't even think the art is so super , but it 's got to be one of my favorite images on the internet . 
  it 's so hilarious , and such a fun imagining of the metaphor !, 
  i ca n't even fucking sight , my sees are wrinkle up with laugh !, 
  source 2 !, 
  the two balls are for the 2 !, 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ kidding, 
  and then there 's / r/nofap, 
  i just extrapolated masturbation technique from my rough idea of how sex was supposed to work . 
  it worked great !, 
  you do n't really have to have autism to do that , though . 
  i made that mistake multiple times in middle school . 
  ( although you 're probably not guessing . ), 
  meh , outer and inner . 
  besides the triple-dough crust , is there anything wrong with the image ? 
  i can see the thickness of the crust as artistic license . 
  could n't the two mantles be the upper and lower mantle ? 
  as for the core , they had four items to work with . 
  i 'll grant you the white line , though . 
  ah , you 're right . 
  i 'll let you in on a secret : i 'm a biomedical engineer . 
  i understand you want to read some of his stuff , but i think the best thing for you to do is not start with knuth . 
  try reading some simple programming textbooks first . 
  actually , in order for us to better help you out , it must be asked : for what purpose do you want to read knuth ? 
  nope . 
  apes . 
  it 's not about being smarter than anybody else . 
  it 's about being creative . 
  this is * fun * . 
  ugh , one look at dotsies ... it 's not optimized for letter frequency in any way , and it does n't even use the 32-bit configuration space to the extent that it potentially could . 
  i 've made more informationally-dense * phonemic * scripts than this , and english phonology is only surjective onto orthography . 
  brb designing logographic script for 2d simplex grid . 
  on short notice , this was the best i could do . 
  i could definitely have done better , by making it a syllabary rather than semi-phonemic , but i 'm pretty happy with it . 
  illustrations forthcoming .
