  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  mars has very little atmosphere , and is -60 degrees celsius on a good day . 
  the soil is sterile , and there 's no nitrogen anywhere . 
  there 's very , very little chance that there is ( or was ) life on mars . 
  heck , titan is a better bet . 
  it 's at least chemically similar to earth , just very cold . 
  [ oh god the / r/worldnews thread is terrible . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1n7bh5/the_curiosity_rover_just_found_water_on_mars/ ) it 's being hailed as proof of life on mars . 
  itt : people who do n't grasp how hostile mars 's climate is . 
  it depends on how difficult it is to implement . 
  if it 's with nanobots that we can easily produce using other nanobots , then it 's cheap and easy . 
  if it 's with nanobots that we have to build with more conventional tools , then it 's difficult and expensive . 
  sorry , that 's what i meant when i said illustrations were forthcoming . 
  actually , the most information-efficient way to tile a two-dimensional plane is not squares , but the 2d simplex shape ( the simplest possible 2d polygon ) , an equilateral triangle . 
  i do n't think equilateral triangles would print well , though , so instead i 'll employ right triangles of equal leg length . 
  or , i would , if i had the patience to draw a grid like that . 
  instead , enjoy this equilateral triangle grid from the internet that i filled in with the first sentence of the first article of the universal declaration of human rights . 
  http://i.imgur.com/1varbhp.gif i think it 's entirely not bad , but a lot could be done for readability . 
  maybe color different columns alternating colors . 
  sorry will resubmit with different title, 
  this time is different , and i 'm not being sarcastic . 
  its soil seems to be about 2 % water , which is roughly the same as earth iirc . 
  this is the `` water on mars '' to end all `` water on mars `` es . 
  unless they discover an ocean on mars , which they wo n't . 
  i specifically mentioned cryophiles . 
  they would only be able to survive on mars at the equator , during the summer . 
  ( equators still have seasons , of course . ), 
  and extremophiles were not the first organisms alive . 
  the first organisms were bubbles of lipids in a warm sea . 
  no such thing exists or has existed on mars . 
  aquifers are pretty plausible . 
  titan might have an underground ocean . 
  of course , titan is ice . 
  the point is , it does n't mean there 's life on mars . 
  life is not `` just add water '' . 
  well ... yes , i 'm a biomedical engineer ( with xp in bioengineering ) . 
  tiny uneducated subset ? 
  look at how many points they have !, 
  that 's true , i oversimplified there . 
  to tell the truth , there is no especially probable theory . 
  it 's fairly safe to say , though , that life evolved from protocells , which were blobs of lipids . 
  the devil is in the details : how did the first protocells execute reactions ? 
  how did rna and proteins come to be ? 
  what were the first nucleic acids ? 
  i did n't mention an opinion on that , at least . 
  but it 's true that the environment that protocells came about in is still up for grabs . 
  what specifically did you find condescending ? 
  i did n't mean to do that . 
  maybe it is partially the terse way i write ? 
  if you are talking about `` are you fucking kidding me ? 
  '' , then yes that was condescending . 
  i stand by it , though . 
  except it does n't at all ? 
  i 'm not getting the point . 
  sort of true ; my first language is hungarian ( the wikipedia poster child for agglutinative languages ) , and it is usually the other way around that english makes a distinction hungarian does n't . 
  famous/hilarious exceptions include the piros/v \u00f6r\u00f6s distinction ( they both mean `` red '' ) . 
  we do however have ways to form verbs and adjectives from nouns that english does n't . 
  for example , take the word for the spice paprika , `` paprika '' . 
  we can form an adjective from it , `` paprik\u00e1s '' , which means `` having paprika '' . 
  ( if there were people whose job it was to sell paprika , that would also be their job title . ), 
  we can form a verb from this adjective : `` paprik\u00e1s\u00edtani '' , meaninf `` to make have paprika '' ( i.e. 
  to add paprika to ) . 
  we can further flavor to the verb : '' \u00f6sszepaprik\u00e1s\u00edtani '' means `` to cover in paprika '' , and `` bepaprik\u00e1s\u00edtani '' means `` to thoroughly flavor with paprika '' . 
  i do not , however , think we have any words for face-saving like that , that i know of . 
  we do have a politeness verb system , though , exactly like german . 
  edit : worth noting is that i can then turn these verbs into nouns : '' \u00f6sszepaprik\u00e1s\u00edt\u00e1s '' is the act of covering something in paprika . 
  aww , thanks !, 
  that means a lot to me !, 
  they both mean the exact same range of shades of red . 
  however , something is either piros , or v\u00f6r\u00f6s . 
  balls , paint , welts , bugs , cars , paprika , red peppers , are piros . 
  blood , wine , earth , dye ( which has the word as paint in hungarian !, 
  ) , the red sea , tomatoes , are v\u00f6r\u00f6s . 
  i used to see a pattern , but now i do n't . 
  and * you * way underestimate how cold mars is . 
  even if cryophiles today could survive at some small part of mars , how would they get there ? 
  we only have cryophiles on earth because , earlier , a less hostile environment allowed life to evolve in the first place . 
  whatever , okay , then what about the lack of nitrogen ( or phosphorous ) ? 
  how would they make nucleic acids or the like ? 
  even theoretical exotic nucleic acids like pna use nitrogen . 
  and what about the radiation ? 
  it would be very hostile to genetics , the existence of radio-resistent extremophiles notwithstanding ( a cryophile * and * radiophile ? 
  you do n't get one of those on your first try ) . 
  europa it is then . 
  the fact that we 're taking water as making life more likely * presupposes * that we 're playing in the vicinity of earth rules . 
  if you want to look for possibilities outside the box , go ahead , but the water is * in * the box . 
  hail to accordions from hungary !, 
  ah , a computational linguist . 
  yes , but what is getting returned is n't a function , it 's some other value . 
  look at this sloppily-written tail-recursive function in python :,
