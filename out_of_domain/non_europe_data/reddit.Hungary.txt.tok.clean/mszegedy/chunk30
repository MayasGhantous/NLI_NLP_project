  if you actually follow homestuck as it 's being written , then you always read the pesterlogs , because you want to absorb all the new information . 
  he 'll be 16 as well by the time he arrives there . 
  i could apply them to real life , but i 'd never be able to admit kismesissitude . 
  i started a little before problem sleuth ended, 
  sorry , not $ 40 ; that particular seller turned out to be a fraud . 
  what you 're buying is actually oem ; my mistake . 
  the oem ( original equipment manufacturer ) is a much cheaper version intended for system builders like dell , hp , ibm and whatnot . 
  it 's the same software , but the license is different : you can only install it once , on one pc , and you do n't get tech support ( i think ) . 
  otherwise , same thing , but like five times less money . 
  is that charles dutton ? 
  hindi : the standard language of india, 
  sanskrit : its predecessor ( like latin for us ), 
  shiva : one of the three major hindu gods ; his job is to destroy the world if brahma ( the creator ) does n't like it . 
  but there 's too many other examples to list ... 
  i think i 'll just keep this list right ... here . 
  if squarewave counts , then sprites do too . 
  i think fish puns is just a thing she does . 
  the rest is her natural personality . 
  you can thank latin . 
  i 'm halfway done with the world generator , but the whole game is not necessarily going to get done . 
  it 's set up like canonical sburb : one player is a server for the other . 
  your house is stored and processed on your computer while it 's not in the medium , but your planet is stored and processed on your server player 's computer ( which is then accessed by multiple players ) . 
  skaia , prospit , derse , and the asteroid belt are stored on the gm 's computer . 
  11th and 13th . 
  ... what ? 
  i hope so too !, 
  it would be really cool to play ; i must first find people to play it with , however , preferably people who have n't read homestuck . 
  in the meantime , i must learn how to use ncurses and p2p networking programming !, 
  there 's no conservation of karma , so you ca n't hoard it !, 
  until she gets renamed by hussie . 
  you have got to admit , it 's really catchy . 
  i would n't have guessed the beatles . 
  i know nothing about modern music . 
  shitty drawings are beautiful always . 
  hell , the most modern music i know is antonin dvo\u0159ak . 
  similar , slightly less stupid : [ http://redd.it/qugd3] ( http://redd.it/qugd3 ), 
  wait ... this sounds like an actual answer to me . 
  really ? 
  it used to be , `` ask a legit question , get a stupid answer '' . 
  i find platypus ' answer very ironic . 
  could you please link me some of this shit ton from a credible source , please ? 
  i understand that the votes do n't count for shit , but i do n't think there 's election fraud . 
  a day or two, 
  i think df is more computation than anything else . 
  actually , the corruption of the pronunciation of c and s ( and most other phonemes , actually ) came with the advent of new latin . 
  [ if you take a look a wikipedia 's page on it , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_regional_pronunciation ) , each region came up with their own new and creative regional pronunciation for each phoneme . 
  fuck them . 
  why could n't they just pronounce them the way they were supposed to be pronounced ? 
  ( like , spain pronounced c / \u03b8 / . 
  i mean , what the fuck ? ), 
  yeah . 
  well , if you 're constantly pumping magma , then a lousy framerate is acceptable . 
  but i digress . 
  and anyway , df is n't actual ascii anyway unless you make it . 
  yes . 
  you have to pay a lot for your fps . 
  how can you not figure it out ? 
  he even made the variable names conveniently expository for * that purpose * . 
  * more, 
  at least he said `` indices '' instead of `` indexes '' . 
  normally , yes , but i think it 's possible to get actual unicode on it . 
  he was trying to get around the fact that '' / / '' comments out the rest of the line . 
  the site is dedicated to joke articles . 
  where `` ough '' can be pronounced / o\u028a / or / \u028fu / or / \u028cf\u02d0 / ? 
  less efficient than french , if you ask me ... 
  ( though `` eaux '' for / \u00f8 / * is * pretty ridiculous ), 
  that would n't be very interesting !, 
  also , it 's not really a whole syllable that gets dropped , just the pronunciation of the last letter , usually , anyway . 
  no , i mean , what the hell is an omnipotent kingdom ? 
  anyone else think of [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/guwvwp0usu8 ) ? 
  i 'd prefer to have around five languages or so . 
  one for talking , one for the internet , one for more high-level talking , one for laws , and one for !! science !, 
  you 're probably right . 
  sponges ? 
  like , * war * sponges ? 
  ( that was sarcasm . ), 
  actually , in proper latin , it would be pronounced [ \u0251 ` r\u0251\u02d0n\u025bai ] , or `` ah-rahn-heh-hie '' for those unfamiliar with ipa . 
  ( do n't pronounce the h 's at the beginnings of the syllables . 
  and the `` ah '' in the beginning is short . 
  and the r is rolled . 
  now you 've pretty much hit the nail on the head . ), 
  why , how 's it supposed to be pronounced ? 
  ( get ready for a & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; . ), 
  meeeeeee . 
  i read it in german because i 'm cool like that . 
  it 's not the findings that are supposed to be funny , it 's the subject matter . 
  even assuming that each note can only have 3 pitches , that 's 3 ^ 12 combinations right there . 
  do n't underestimate the huss . 
  just small . 
  everything inside the bubble is surreally big . 
  wait , no , it 's the linux version . 
  those damn linux users . 
  nope . 
  d : verified fact right here . 
  ever wait under a tree for a sapling to drop down ? 
  i have the inventory button mapped to p. you ? 
  ( because fuckin ' java ca n't tell an e from a comma . ), 
  i 've done it , trying to press the space bar . 
  they look lovely . 
  but , ascii escapes ... and memory usage ... why did he have to du it like this ?
