  you can simulate the three legs with kethane drills , if you have kethane . 
  they wo n't support the ship , though , so you can put two legs each on the side of each drill . 
  sort of . 
  if you type something in , it remembers the different times it said that to someone in the past , and remembers what reply they got , and it picks a reply at random . 
  so you do n't end up talking to the same person for more than one line , and the replies you get usually are n't ones that just got typed in . 
  no do n't worry , i am . 
  this sub is surprisingly low-content though , by which i mean skimming some of the comments has n't spoiled * anything * for me . 
  i 'm not sure that 's a good sign , but eh whatever . 
  that 's ... actually pretty close !, 
  it 's only forty or so times far away than the star nearest to us . 
  spqr should have been showing the disembodied head of pompey to egypt , going , `` what the hell is this ? '', 
  ( what would that be in latin ? 
  i do n't like transliterations . 
  of course , wikipedia has a very educational article on latin swear words , but it does n't mention any adverbs or adjectives that emphasized a word or phrase by their profanity . 
  also , i 'm not sure whether i need that hoc there . ), 
  wow , that 's a fantastic comic !, 
  i did n't even get to it while voting , despite going through some 30 or 40 comics , and i would surely have liked this one best of all !, 
  so ... next june ? 
  i was exaggerating for humor . 
  then i do n't get it , why did you correct my comment for realism ? 
  ^ ( or i am just german ), 
  but , what 's funny about it ? 
  finlan has no need of sticks . 
  can into using bare hands . 
  wow , today sealand of flair can into big !, 
  we call them `` lying police '' in hungarian ( `` lying '' as in lying down ) . 
  what , did he * say * he wanted to improve the situation ? 
  '' ** when ** '' the screen smashes ? 
  i 've owned two iphones for four years and one year respectively , and the worst i 've gotten is a couple small scratches . 
  edit : i do n't own a case . 
  on the plus side , internet . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  high five !, 
  man , how do you do it now ? 
  how is it that * every * thread has a / r/thathappened in it ... but this bullshit still makes the front page . 
  it 's mind-boggling . 
  hmm ... maybe it was parody ? 
  this ca n't possibly be real , right ? 
  huh , i always thought it was `` ambisinst ** rous ** '' . 
  i think that was `` underside of each book shelf '' . 
  what movie ? 
  now crawl down one more level to lose the muscles too !, 
  then another one for the blood vessels ( which are also muscles ) . 
  thank you !, 
  the transfer burns are less exciting ? 
  do you not have a soul or something ? 
  quick , tell me something you do that i 'm too lazy to do so that i do n't think you 're horribly lazy !, 
  ^ ( seriously downloading and installing mechjeb is work ? 
  it takes literally less than a minute ), 
  he never said it mattered , he just said that someone who uses mechjeb does n't have any skills ( which is n't true , but that 's not what yiur post is refuting ) . 
  that is a / v / thread that usually exists , right ? 
  even if you know basic nuclear physics you know it wo n't happen . 
  saturn is not big enough , especially not enough that 42 lbs of plutonium will matter . 
  now , if we transmuted saturn to plutonium ( do n't worry , not possible ) , it would n't quite turn into a sun , but it would be ... interesting . 
  what if i know two assholes ? 
  with 6 tentacles, 
  ctrl-z does n't work for me . 
  also the ones in the left column on each page . 
  sloppy , sloppy , sloppy . 
  `` what movie/show is it from '' comments always receive a mix of right and wrong answers , so you have to go with whichever there are the most of . 
  therefore , i 'm going to tell you it 's quantum leap , despite there already being two comments saying it , to further affirm that it is , in fact , quantum leap . 
  that does make more sense than / v / . 
  edit : i found it , and now i wish i had n't . 
  i thought * reddit * was abrasive . 
  edit : 4-3 , actually, 
  is that ... a coral snake getting dragged by a spider ? 
  i learned to program asm before i learned about dollars , so having the dollar sign before the number made sense for most of my childhood . 
  but now that i use it for money , it bothers me because units usually go after numbers , like variables . 
  i asked earlier today about a gif from * the road to el dorado * , and one person replied , and they said * the road to el dorado * . 
  they even gave an imdb link !, 
  the system works sometines !, 
   second, 
  third , maybe ? 
  i do n't know much about us history but i distinctly remember the us going to war with mexico twice in the past . 
  ah , yes , i 'm thinking about the ( second ) spanish-american war vs. the mexican-american war . 
  would n't those be considered two wars america had with mexico ? 
  for some reason , i read that as `` al gore '' . 
  now all i have is my imagination ... 
  / r/hero, 
  hi , you 're me !, 
  my lifters are very huge but very stable within themselves . 
  the problem with my lifters that i have is the * link * between the lifter and the tug . 
  no amount of struts seems enough to reinforce that one measly rockomax-size bond . 
  you should edit your post with a corrected version !, 
  i thought they kind of shrivel up , and crust over after the troll fluid leaks out and dries . 
  i think the word `` troll '' came into such a usage first , and then `` trolling '' , so it 's the monster . 
  or just `` facebook addiction '' . 
  that 's a little * too * gray if you ask me . 
  man , you are so silly for not correcting it !, 
  wow , i thought all morays were bloodthirsty terminators . 
  but that one is so cute !, 
  it makes similar faces to our dog . 
  ( then again , all morays make that face ... 
  i have so far interpreted it as the face of a killer . ), 
  3000 + dives and you do n't wear gloves ? 
  :p or was it one of those gloves where the fingertips are exposed ? 
  short in the meantime ? 
  yes , but i do n't go around saying `` the chemical formula to make rubisco is ho2cch ( nh2 ) ch2oh '' because it contains serine . 
  if you want to say a compound , say its formula , not a formula of one of its components . 
  sugar cubes are not c6h12o6 cubes , they are c12h22o11 cubes .
