  god dammit , this is pretty much a reply that every reply to this thread gets . 
  stop it . 
  oh , that makes sense . 
  thank you . 
  wow . 
  i can see why . 
  i think jetpack joyride inspired the question that led to that article . 
  once , my mother ordered * twilight * on netflix , but somehow got * the princess bride * instead . 
  we watched both movies together , and i liked tpb a lot better . 
  i was able to cram it into 3 minutes ( the first 3 minutes of english class ) when i realized that i had forgotten to read it the night before . 
  i * still * felt sad after reading it . 
  well , a lot of people liked the * twilight * movies . 
  i personally was n't a fan of the dialogue , music , or sound direction in general . 
  the visuals were pretty good , though , and the plot was decent . 
  being able to subscribe to 150 subreddits is nice , too . 
  wow , i never thought of doing it that way !, 
  ssto , to me , is synonymous with `` awesome spaceplane '' . 
  i care about those things , and fps . 
  that 's it . 
  ^ ( edit : also more planets would be nice . 
  having a saturn with rings would be awesome . 
  and a neptune , with a triton . ), 
  ah , you used italics . 
  no fun at all that way !, 
  let me fix that for you :, 
   `` good . 
  item seven . 
  the had had and that that problem . 
  lady cavendish , were n't you working on this ? '', 
   lady cavendish stood up and gathered her thoughts . 
   `` indeed . 
  the use of had had and that that has to be strictly controlled ; they can interrupt the imaginotransference quite dramatically , causing readers to go back over the sentence in confusion , something we try to avoid . '', 
   `` go on . '', 
   `` it 's mostly an unlicensed usage problem . 
  at the last count * david copperfield * alone had had had had sixty-three times , all but ten unapproved . 
  * pilgrim 's progress * may also be a problem owing to its had had / that that ratio . '', 
   `` so what 's the problem in * progress * ? '', 
   `` that that had that that ten times but had had had had only thrice . 
  increased had had usage had had to be considered but not if the number exceeds that that that usage . '', 
   `` hmm , '' said the bellman . 
  `` i thought had had had had tgc 's approval for use in dickens ? 
  what 's the problem ? '', 
   `` take the first had had and that that in the book by way of example , '' explained lady cavendish . 
  `` you would have thought that that first had had had had good occasion to be seen as had , had you not ? 
  had had had approval but had had had not ; equally it is true to say that that that that had had approval but that that other that that had not . '', 
   `` so the problem with that other that that was that -- ? '', 
   `` that that other-other that that had had approval . '', 
   `` okay , '' said the bellman , whose head was in danger of falling apart like a chocolate orange , `` let me get this straight : * david copperfield * , unlike * pilgrim 's progress * , which had had had , had had had had . 
  had had had had tgc 's approval ? '', 
   there was a very long pause . 
   `` right , '' said the bellman with a sigh . 
  -- jasper fforde , * the well of lost plots * , pp . 
  256-257 ( paperback ), 
  i think this could be a pretty good operation if you replaced `` show up as batman and flash '' with `` notify the police to show up '' . 
  they also come from the same organ in my body . 
  maybe it 's time to get a lobotomy for me ? 
  `` died outside of earth 's atmosphere . '', 
  then it was probably more than 36 from what i can see . 
  that 's a shame . 
  if the room was surrounded by earth 's atmosphere , they still died inside earth 's atmosphere . 
  i would love it too , but i would n't get my hopes up at all . 
  i 'm * this * close to just decompiling the game and having at it . 
  i would only be breaking the license agreement anyway , since hungary ( where i live occasionally and presently ) has copyright laws that do n't cover this sort of thing . 
  i did it when i was a kid . 
  one stuck to my hand afterwards !, 
  i made sure it did n't stick too well , otherwise i would have been in a lot of trouble . 
  you forgot the mussel ( s ? ), 
  to the left . 
  edit : no , wait , just another barnacle . 
  i read that as `` culturally unaware biker '' , and i thought for about a minute that a biker had made these cookies/cakes . 
  e ) not a complaint , but why did he change the icing to black for chanukah ? 
  there 's probably a chrome extension that mutes individual tabs . 
  but fuck those websites . 
  both are correct . 
  no , the other way around . 
  it 's legal to decompile them . 
  i mean the outline . 
  the idea is , you 're allowed to play the game , but you 're not allowed to understand exactly how it works , because the details are squad 's intellectual property that they 're not willing to share with you . 
  it 's like a trade secret . 
  surely , it makes sense on that level ? 
  you 're allowed to eat the krabby patty , but are not allowed to know the secret formula . 
  it 's fine , it 's pretty much what i expected . 
  is there any famous `` bugfix '' mod ( besides deadly reentry ) or any other bugfix mod that might help ? 
  most of peoples ' sense of taste comes from their nose . 
  ( to any person without anosmia reading this : try food when you have a cold , that 's what food tastes like without a sense of smell . ), 
  you 're missing out !, 
  most oil is algae . 
  you still hear jokes like this on the radio in hungary . 
  as a biomedical engineer by profession but practically more of a molecular biologist , i think this assessment is spot-on . 
  although , coming from a family of theoretical computer scientists , i am one of those strange exceptions who is good at math and * can * code for crap . 
  does anyone else think ritalin was involved here ? 
  is sticking with a single choice the best way to go always ? 
  ( assuming it 's non-iterated . ), 
  what if you know for sure the other prisoner always defects ? 
  i do n't buy it , literally . 
  more than one person can have the same views !, 
  `` i '' should be capitalized . 
  ^ ( hah , i sure showed him ! ), 
  i 've gone to nearly every body and back , but i still ca n't make an ssto . 
  i love how you 're like `` this is my standard ssto , but a little bit bigger . '',
