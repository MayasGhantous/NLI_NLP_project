  have enough of it and you get diarrhea . 
  or two cats, 
  sorry , i replied to the wrong post, 
  [ the cat part is actually quite a fascinating subject ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat_righting_reflex ), 
  it depends how old she is . 
  yes . 
  hey , what kind of scientist ? 
  i 'm a biomedical engineer and i work on cancer too ( breast cancer , though , not melanoma ) . 
  you 're an asshole . 
  ( then again , that 's what my reaction to most downvoting roman memes . ), 
  huh . 
  i 'm still a grad student . 
  what did you phd in ? 
  if you put the phrase `` nsfw '' in the title , the post is automatically tagged . 
  hah , i know that feeling !, 
  i 'm supposed to be a biomedical engineer ( so , neuro and prosthetics and stuff ) , but my best work is in protein engineering . 
  this could be a pretty great ironic tattoo . 
  but i would n't want to have one forever ; or , really , i do n't like to deal with that kind of nonsense at all . 
  i wonder how this is going to go when reddit becomes obscure sometime in the next decade or so . 
  you should have made the title more subtle by saying `` probably only teaches c major '' or something of the like . 
  ^ ( you should probably only have said either `` c major '' or `` a minor '' , but not both . 
  both would have been clunky . ), 
  also humans . 
  after 80 or so years , we simply just * stop working !, 
  ^ ( also applies to basically every species of anything in existence , except those that reproduce mitotically , and * turritopsis nutricula * , and anything else i may have forgotten about . ), 
  why have such a long rope for the lawnmower ? 
  why not strap it directly to the quad ? 
  the coolest thing is that the outline in the cd ( dvd ? ), 
  picture goes along with the line of the arm . 
  that 's a pretty interesting standard . 
  does she spend most of her time watching porn , or what ? 
  same to you !, 
  err , it 's not an `` irrational , emotional '' question . 
  sure , interpreting the words individually , it 's not the * right * question , but we use it all the time to mean , `` why are you doing that ? '', 
  as a whole , which is totally a sensible question to ask . 
  but dev kits cost more money than consumer products . 
  to be fair , aircraft carriers are amazing pieces of machinery . 
  yes . 
  it meant `` foreign '' . 
  huh . 
  in my experience , the stuff on the underside just softens , and you can blow bubbles with it . 
  and everything is run by the italians, 
  they already said they 're sticking with unity . 
  switching away from unity is filed on the wiki under `` things that will never happen '' . 
  and is n't that one only the lifter stage ? 
  well , they do n't , not really , now . 
  edit : [ my first language was hungarian ] ( http://www.livememe.com/4z7zpk1 ), 
  yup , interplanetary drive . 
  thank you !, 
  i once tried to write fanmusic for this . 
  then i remembered that i suck at composing . 
  okay , but i still need the burn to be short enough to be actually doable in the time period set out for it . 
  as in , i ca n't just do part of a burn once i pass the point , and come back around in an orbital period to do the rest of it . 
  the timing of the hohmann transfer would be utterly destroyed . 
  turkey can finally into eu ? 
  many joys !, 
  ahh i 'm allergic to those , my doctor said hey this is actually pretty good . 
  nice one !, 
  i moved from princeton to berkeley , and i ca n't find any phonetic difference between the accents . 
  i will have to look for the two you mentioned . 
  what is the difference between how `` don '' and `` dawn '' are pronounced ? 
  [ \u0251\u02d0 ] vs. [ \u0254 ] ? 
  [ \u0251\u02d0 ] vs. [ \u0252\u02d0 ] ? 
  ( i never could tell the difference between those last two ), 
  that 's reassuring to know . 
  thank you !, 
  i hear `` engineering '' abbreviated a lot more often as `` eng '' . 
  i work in `` biom eng '' . 
  i tried to make a squares , circles , and triangles logography , in order to prove that the chinese logography aesthetic is not the only aesthetic that a logography can have . 
  it did not go well . 
  mature blood cells do n't have nuclei anyway . 
  they 're zombies . 
  of course , no way it 's only mature blood cells . 
  wait , what about circularization burns when you 're hurtling toward a planet at thousands of relative km/s ? 
  exactly what is into being wrong with hungarian narration , brazilian whore-slut ? 
  hmm , that could work . 
  thank you !, 
  you should try learning any non-kebab african language whatsoever !, 
  for example , standard [ fulani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fula_language ) has 25 or 26 noun classes , depending on who you ask !, 
  hungarian does n't even have any noun classes ( thank god ) !, 
  or try learning chinese !, 
  it has hundreds of dialects that sound nothing like each other , and it 's a tonal language with a syllabic logography to boot !, 
  ( also , `` whore-slut '' is just a translation of the ever-popular slavic `` kurwa '' ), 
  ugandan dictator . 
  often confused for having discovered amino acids . 
  not quite synthesized . 
  extracted , from fedoras and cheetos . 
  kerbal space program : oh man , where to start . 
  the drag model is pretty terrible and not so fun . 
  if you build anything with more than a few hundred parts , the game lags like crazy . 
  looking at the horizon makes the whole planet flicker in and out of existence . 
  the building interface can be practically un * usable * at times . 
  the parts are badly organized ( e.g. , fuel tanks and thrusters are lumped in together ) . 
  none of the equipment under `` science '' does anything * useful * ( thank god that 's going to change ) . 
  there are very few plane parts . 
  it comes with only two tutorials and the wiki is n't much help either when it comes to specifics . 
  physics warp is useless because it makes things blow up . 
  one moon is practically unvisitable because anything that lands on it blows up . 
  there are few planets and moons in general . 
  however , the game is still in development , so it would be unfair to criticize it yet .
