  it 's already very fun as it is , so it remains one of my favorite games .

  right , i did n't need tutorials either . 
  but we 're not everyone . 
  we 're not even most people . 
  lots and lots of people get turned off by a lack of a tutorial . 
  that 's bad . 
  tutorials are comfortable and helpful . 
  ksp should have proper tutorials . 
  also , i 'm not just talking about tutorials . 
  i 'm talking about fine details . 
  for example , if i have multiple rcs tanks and multiple rcs blocks on my ship , which tanks are going to get drawn from first ? 
  and , are vertically consecutive liquid fuel tanks treated as individual tanks , or are they treated as whole tanks ? 
  if you decouple two stages , will the decoupler remain on one of them ? 
  are struts and fuel lines the only connections that can be separated with decoupling ? 
  these are all questions that can be answered by careful application of the scientific method , but i did n't sign up to do science . 
  i signed up to do engineering . 
  actually i like this sign a lot . 
  very boardwalk . 
  edit : website . 
  not sign . 
  website . 
  the researcher , the perpetuator , and a little of the gamer and the snacker . 
  huh that 's way smaller than i thought . 
  i thought any proper rocket ought to be the height of a small skyscraper , not a three-story building . 
  bacterial !, 
  it 's happened before , and none of the other ones are known to cause similar effects . 
  maybe some type of amoeba ? 
  no , those are freshwater . 
   what kind of sick bastard skps the paprika ? 
  romanians, 
  hey , me too !, 
  we should start a club or something, 
  excluding outliers is valid statistical practice . 
  find out a criterion for outlier ( e.g. , + / - 3 sds ) and exclude the ones that do n't fit . 
  50000 would probably fall under whatever criterion you devise . 
  taking away the maximum and minimum for the mean is sometimes a thing that 's done . 
  it 's called the `` truncated mean '' . 
  personally i do n't like it ; it 's better to exclude based on standard deviations than on index . 
  edit : [ huh i could have sworn . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mean#truncated_mean ) never mind , i do n't know where i got that from . 
  hah , some two hours in , i had to go on this subreddit to figure out why my rocket is n't running . 
  turns out ? 
  jet fuel does n't power most thrusters . 
  he 's not stupid . 
  he just wants syntactic sugar . 
  i can get behind that . 
  i want one of those !, 
  it 's so colorful, 
  google could have been so much more . 
  they are n't just a company that runs a search engine . 
  they have their fingers in practically every pie . 
  i 'm not suspicious about them : a lot of my family and friends work there , and the place is pretty much great . 
  but it 's still ironic to hear larry page calling oracle a `` far-reaching company with unclear motivations '' ( or something like it , it was a while ago ) . 
  that one , i learned to spell far earlier than i learned how to say it . 
  that justification makes no sense to me . 
  being cleared of charges would make me ecstatic . 
  so is that no longer an option at all ? 
  not even if i * am * innocent ? 
  no , it is n't . 
  if the same number comes up 20 times in a row , the roulette is obviously biased towards it . 
  keep betting on it . 
  i feel the same way about mosquitoes . 
  mosquitofish and frogs just do n't cut it as a justification . 
  i wrote everything that follows ( including the stuff in brackets ) for a thread in which we were discussing how you 'd explain to a woman from 1916 that her picture had been uploaded to reddit :, 
  i have this really thin metallic disk , that i spin in place using a tiny motor . 
  there is a little implement on top of the disk that can change the magnetization of the disk in small spots , using electricity . 
  it 's also got a feature that if it detects magnetization on a part of a disk , then it can produce an electric current . 
  so this way , i can store information on the disk , by checking whether individual spots on it are magnetized or not . 
  there 's a simple code for converting sequences of magnetized parts to letters . 
  here , you can make one up yourself : five non-magnetized parts after another is a , four non-magnetized parts and one magnetized parts is b , three non-magnetized parts after another , one magnetized part , and then another non-magnetized part is c , and so on . 
  we call the amount of information stored by one of these parts a `` bit '' , and we call non-magnetized `` 0 '' and magnetized `` 1 '' . 
  so a would be 00000 , b would be 00001 , c would be 00010 , and so forth . 
  i could also store numbers . 
  0 could be 0 , 1 could be 1 , 2 could be 10 , 3 could be 11 , 4 could be 100 , and so on . 
  it 's like counting with our ten digits , but there 's only two digits , so you move up places quicker . 
  [ other bases had , i think , long since been invented in 1916 . 
  i mean , the babylonians counted in base 64 , but i 'm pretty sure by then base systems were also part of math education . 
  i 'm not entirely sure , though , which is why i 'm explaining it . ], 
  i can also store colors this way , because a color is just three numbers : the amount of red , the amount of green , and the amount of blue . 
  no , green . 
  no , you 're thinking of cyan , yellow , and magenta , which you can use when you mix paint to get any color . 
  you could do it that way too , but we prefer the inverse , red , green , and blue , since when you mix light , you use those to get any color . 
  no , i swear !, 
  try it out !, 
  anyway ... if i can store a lot of colors after another , these can make up a line of colors laid out one after another . 
  we call that a `` scanline '' . 
  if you stack scanlines on top of one another , you can make a mosaic !, 
  and since there 's a lot of space on my disk , i can make really big and detailed mosaics that , if you look at them from far away , look like regular pictures . 
  in this way , i can store pictures on my disk . 
  i 've also got a camera that can take a picture , and , without developing it , just store it on the disk immediately . 
  it can do this because instead of film covered with a chemical that turn shades of gray when light hits them , instead it 's got little metal pieces of metal in a mosaic grid that emit electricity when light hits them . 
  in fact , it 's divided up into different kinds of pieces so that there 's kinds of pieces that are only activated by red light , and kinds that are only activated by green light , and kinds that are activated by blue light . 
  i think . 
  i do n't know too much about the details . 
  but , anyway , based on the electric charges coming from the little pieces of metal , it can write down on the disk using the reading and writing implement on it which ones were activated , in the format i told you earlier . 
  it can do this nearly instantly , too , since the reading and writing implement can go really fast . 
  [ actually , it 's because cameras use non-magnetic storage !, 
  no need to tell them that , though . ], 
  now , i 've got this small machine , that , besides having a very tiny version of one of those cameras and a small version of one of those disks built into it [ actually the device i 'm thinking of has an ssd , but earlier versions used to have hdds !,
