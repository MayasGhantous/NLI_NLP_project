  ... but how do you use the mouse , then ? 
  i wish i had something to say that i ca n't just say with an upvote . 
  oh , of course no one would know all five languages !, 
  unless they wanted to . 
  but yeah , i think most people would only know 2 ( common and internet ) or 3 ( common , high , and internet ) , with lots of code-switching between common and high . 
  scientists , lawyers , and judges might know 4 ( common , high , internet , and law or !! science !! ) . 
  it would be so cool . 
  i 've even already constructed the !! science !!, 
  language . 
  it accounts for time travel , and its verbs can be conjugated theoretically about a quintillion ways . 
  it is extremely awesome . 
  next , i 'll come up with law , and then pick two of the other languages i 've constructed as high and common . 
  and yes , this is remarkably off-topic . 
  do you want to see my optimal 7-person build following this architecture ? 
  ( i swear the story had no effect on this ; i just think this is the best to have ), 
  seer of light, 
  knight of time, 
  mage of mind, 
  heir of life, 
  thief of heart, 
  bard of doom, 
  prince of breath, 
  just get a tablet and read websites . 
  magazines are n't very good for this . 
  that 's a signature . 
  some are good , some are bad ... it all kind of depends on the subject matter . 
  list 1 is newer , though . 
  do n't worry , next thing i 'm posting is the world generation algorithm for my rpg . 
  i think you will be deeply satisfied . 
  it is really the most awesome thing there is . 
  i 've just got to organize and commit to ( e ) paper some stuff first . 
  after that ... it 's seriously going to be awesome , bro . 
  yeah . 
  as a wise man once said , `` the problem with lojban is it 's only spoken by the sort of people who learn lojban . '', 
  nice chart , but i must mention that we know that the alternia i ancestors are alternia ii 's session trolls , that is , karkat , terezi , vriska , tavros , [ ect ect ect ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  it 's kind of weird to think about , that the trolls we all know and love are actually the * latter * incarnation of twelve trolls from another universe . 
  like , that 's not really them , just a shadow of their initial selves . 
  whoa . 
  so barf, 
  that 's just the thing . 
  all the one 's i 've heard sound like fuck . 
  my friend has logic studio , twice over , and i may be able to crib them off him ( his sound amaaaaazing ) , but in the meantime , i 'm left with these goddamn `` strings '' . 
  what strings ? 
  i have no idea what to liken them to , but they are anything but strings . 
  they are a different timbre altogether . 
  aargh i hate cheap string synths ... :(, 
  and my recordings on my violin sound ever worse , due to having a piezoelectric pickup . 
  hey , idea : demo them on my violin irl . 
  hmm ... 
  edit : whoa , musescore has evolved a lot since i 've last seen it . 
  i still have the crappy rosettaware version on my comp ... 
  [ ahahaha just how *** high *** do you have to be to even ** do ** something like that ... . . ] ( / dunkass ), 
  thanks !, 
  heh , that would work ... 
  i 'll try him , though , first . 
  thanks for the thought , though !, 
  but we all know it 's just disguised notes for the dwarven insurrection . 
  which one is that ? 
  i do !, 
  correct !, 
  i was getting used to typing dvorak on a physical qwerty keyboard , and i mistyped `` etc '' `` ect '' somehow ( it 's the same damn letters !, 
  ) , and could n't find the keys to correct it , so i just copypasted it and put it in comic sans . 
  can i take a stab at what the nominative singular form of `` cetera '' is ? 
  maybe , `` c\u0113tus '' , neuter third declension with genitive `` c\u0113teris '' ? 
  i do n't know what it means ( `` the rest ? 
  '' ) , but amirite or what ? 
  ... you 're everywhere . 
  my tag says so , in gray . 
  the point is n't that they 're internet points , but that that net number of people liked what you said , and took their time to declare it by clicking the upvote button . 
  it means that you are a likeable person !, 
  and i 'm sure that that 's the goal in life for some people . 
  is anything worth anything ? 
  the point is it makes you happy . 
  does he really get that many replies saying that ? 
  we hate them somewhat in hungary for unrelated reasons . 
  but not as much as the gypsies and romanians . 
  i believe you accidentally a link . 
  the finest ram is the one with the highest clock speed . 
  some sects cheat and overclock their ram before sacrificing it , but that is evil and not pleasing to the gods . 
  i hope you continue to follow the path of orthodox raminism . 
  aha , thanks !, 
  wow , was i lousy to not think that it was an adjective ... whooops . 
  but yeah , normally i hate it too . 
  but i beleive in strategic misspelling !, 
  and it 's nice of you to leave it up as well . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's an adjective in the substantive neuter plural ( nominative , naturally ) . 
  no , really . 
  literally . 
  like , stab him in the back . 
  and kill him . 
  lol , you can see the giant cloud on it , even . 
  yeah , but the creeper explodes upon contact . 
  scientifically proven result . 
  we , meanwhile , just brush past them with our heads down . 
  i think it 's just their culture to go batshit insane when someone looks at them directly . 
  'cause it 's , like , real disrespectful 'n' shit . 
  ( not speaking , of course , of when we do attack them . 
  then they have every licence to attack . 
  but they are usually the ones to initiate the confrontation . ),
