  there are very decent caves that are nothing like that . 
  i think most fish have that ? 
  i own a shih-tzu , i 've never heard of the nose cleaning thing . 
  i do have to clean his eyes regularly though . 
   `` the introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home , in addition to a spot of hunting . '',

  hahaha oh man this guy was just asking for it, 
  is regular greentext broken ? 
  [ # 4chan ] ( # 4chan ) does n't work . 
  edit : wait , i 've got it :, 
  [ implying you know how to greentext ] ( #green - text ),

  biomed here , can confirm ( am not woman ) . 
  i think this field is actually more women than men . 
  well , duh . 
  i do n't understand what is the deal with south sudan in the comic though . 
  what ? 
  that is backwards . 
  the us is more socially * liberal * than most of europe . 
  even us conservatives are more moderate than the actual conservatives in europe parties . 
  the exception is places like sweden . 
  the 20 % is n't a chance , it 's the percentage of research that actually goes back to kerbin .

  life ^ 3-ln ( 2 ) / ln ( life ), 
  edit : life ^ ^ 3-log ^ life ^ 2, 
  more precisely , assembly translates directly into binary . 
  what , you do n't wear underpants ? 
  how does kerbal space program fit into your toe ? 
  what about beta minecraft ? 
  loaded in 12 seconds for me on shitty comcast internet . 
  i want to see how many lines of code the ncbi database is . 
  blast can not possibly take up so many lines , can it ? 
  `` where are we ? '', 
  `` inside a giant geode . '', 
  i 'm assuming occlumency works on veritaserum . 
  we 're still indo-european . 
  we just have a small language family . 
  sometimes , i really wish i had gone into field biology . 
  that 's * a * use of it , but who 's to say it does n't work on veritaserum too ? 
  let 's not even speculate , and not just because of the nsa . 
  vx terrorism , however unthinkable , is real and factual . 
  the less people know how to do it , the better . 
  it looks 3d , but not moving . 
  it 's reddit premium , reddit 's way of making money . 
  you either buy it for yourself or someone buys it for you , and it adds a couple extra features to reddit for you , like the ability to save comments , the ability to see what comments are new in a thread , and the ability to get a notification in your inbox when someone mentions your username with a / u / ( like this : / u/krismagus ) . 
  i think the most useful feature is the ability to subscribe to 150 subreddits instead of 50 ; you wo n't notice an upper limit without gold , but if you have over 50 , reddit randomly selects 50 to display on your front page every time you visit it . 
  having gold , you can see all the subreddits at once . 
  i used to think reddit gold was pretty stupid , but just under a month ago , someone bought it for me , and now i respect it a little more . 
  you 'd be surprised at the difference . 
  it 's like a super-upvote . 
  wow , that is one sophisticated-looking fish . 
  i can just hear it sighing nasally . 
  whoa , never noticed before that they had the schrodinger equation in the back there . 
  it 's like rewatching a movie , you catch all the subtle things the second time around . 
  that 's funny , since when ? 
  i bought a cx-5 less than a year ago , and i have n't noticed this . 
  `` there 's no number ... only quantifiers ! '', 
  yes , much much easier, 
  well , for one , the microbe branch should be several times larger than the rest of the diagram put together , and should be split up between archaea , bacteria , and protista . 
  also a cooler diagram would include viruses . 
  also octopuses probably did n't evolve so far back , and are definitely not a major junction on the phylogenetic tree , but then again for soft things like octopuses we really do n't have fossils . 
  an accurate phylogenetic tree would n't branch more than once at a junction . 
  probably a lot more ; just enjoy it because it 's pretty , not because it 's accurate . 
  edit : slugs and myriapods on the same branch ? 
  move the slug down to where the seashells are . 
  the snail , too . 
  wait , it 's got more arthropods branching out of it ... whoever drew this has a seriously hard time separating arthropods and gastropods !, 
  edit 2 : moss was a thing before most other forms of land plants , iirc . 
  edit 3 : fungi are accurate but where are the birds ? 
  well , it was a reasonsble enough concern . 
  bar is used to denote antiparticle in particle physics officially , so i have no trouble with that notation at least . 
  but i 'm not sure whether any recollection i have of the notation meaning `` not '' is a hallucination because of that or an actual memory . 
  so i can not help you unfortunately . 
  wow this comment was mostly pointless . 
  for the record kebab is popular in hungary , but we call it gyros . 
  ( once there was a documentary about a small group of people from inland africa who came to the us for some reason . 
  they said about coke , `` we have this back at home , too , but we call it pepsi . '' ), 
  so english * does * have an equivalent word to hungarian `` illat '' !, 
  after ten years of studying us history to varying degrees , i can finally say that i understand the reference that your username is making , probably . 
  unfortunately not , although i 'd love to teach virology someday . 
  it 's nearly my favorite field . 
  i saw it here first , but since then i 've heard a passing reference to it irl , and elsewhere on reddit . 
  fuck you apple shill . 
  we all know you 're lying now !, 
   studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness ( mme ) . 
  i work in biomed eng and i did n't know people even had a term for that, 
  hmm , i do n't like this tongue-in-cheek argument against pop music hate . 
  children are wrong all the time . 
  that said , i do n't mind pop music . 
  sure , but we still do a lot of that in my ( franken - ) field . 
  i 'm looking at you , twilight . 
  its atmo is mostly co2 , and thin , but it 's there . 
  and all self-respecting atmospheric planets have clouds . 
  it 's a scale from 1 to 10 of how high you are , on marijuana . 
  i do n't think that contributes to the clouds , though . 
  edit : ah , the water in the clouds apparently comes from [ th ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles ) [ e pole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmosphere_of_mars#water ) [ s. ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles ), 
  same here , for a moment i could have sworn that one of the officers got tackled by something yellow . 
  then i realized that the thing tackling him was his hat . 
  viral advertising of what , though ?
