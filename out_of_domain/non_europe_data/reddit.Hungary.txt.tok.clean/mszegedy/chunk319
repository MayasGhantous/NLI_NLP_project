  - there are more conservatives in australia, 
  - australia is less relevant, 
  on the other hand , better education . 
  counterargument : eastern europe , russia, 
  my mother always told me that santa was polish . 
  oh man , i ca n't upvote this comic hard enough . 
  really great going . 
  you even changed the url !, 
  subtle , subtle , subtle . 
  my typical day in high school and undergrad involved going through the whole school day going , `` aw , shit , another assignment ? '', 
  practically every class , and going home/to the dorm and sitting down and thinking , `` wait ... did i have homework ? 
  it 's only like 1 thing . 
  whatever , that can wait until 3 am ; i think i 'll just read til then . '', 
  straight male here , can only orgasm during fap if fantasize about being female . 
  it 's to let you know it 's outdated . 
  a real future message would at least use usb 3.0 . 
  not even that , but that 's usb 2.0 instead of 3.0 . 
  office depot = 11 letters . 
  you know what else is 11 letters ? 
  ** / r/circlejerk **, 
  upvote for visibility, 
  i do n't look at them very frequently , just the ones that make the fromt page and not even the majority of those . 
  i understand the relation of hs 's face to the fourier transform , but i do n't understand how it connects to jpegs , other than that both are applications of the fourier transform ( or rather , jpeg is an application of dct ) . 
  jpeg does n't work with parametric curves , does it ? 
  he was n't being sarcastic !, 
  we 're genuinely happy for you , and we 're glad that there 's * good * news around about chemistry majors . 
  you always hear about how there 's no jobs/jobs do n't pay much/academia is corrupt etc. , it 's refreshing to hear someone having their chemistry degree work in their favor . 
  that 's all !, 
  no , it 's a very long serial story that is about to end in one big burst . 
  yeah, 
  as long as it 's at least 1/5, 
  so han and sui never existed/were too short or irrelevant to show ? 
  i am a hamburger, 
  good luck , and why even would you sell that instead of make it free ? 
  reading it just makes me sad that these are n't going to people who want to make use of them . 
  i mean , how many amphenol connectors are on ebay ? 
  he 's saying 49 states do n't have it . 
  that 's all of them except california . 
  the movie was supposed to be from the white guy 's pov . 
  if you want a movie about someone chinese in china then go watch one , but this one is n't one . 
  ( i recommend * ip man * , for that , for starters ; not a single white guy in sight , and it 's a great story and visually very appealing too . ), 
  the purpose of the movie was to chronicle jg ballard 's time spent in a japanese internment camp . 
  jg ballard was white . 
  the fact that it 's set in wwii ~ ~ japan ~ ~ china ? 
  is n't fundamentally critical to the movie ; the point is , there 's a guy being held prisoner by people who are alien to him , and stuff happens to him , and , bonus , the story happens to be true . 
  you could probably make this story with the protagonist being not white and the alien people being white , and that movie in fact probably exists in multiple forms already . 
  but this one is about a white guy in a japanese camp . 
  you 'll enjoy it . 
  jesus christ i 'm so hungry right now . 
  ignored boobs , focused on gravy . 
  ( that 's gravy right ? 
  it might also be delicious peanut butter sauce . 
  or something else . 
  there 's a whole world of possibilities ! ), 
  those ligatures !, 
  they feel like getting spiderwebs caught on my eyeball . 
  google authoritarian status :, 
  nazi stallman, 
  if sealand were n't on the jlp , one of those bubbles could be it !, 
  thanks !, 
  i think i can into charity much more effectively now . 
  most of reddit is male . 
  if op is a statistically tandom redditor , they 're probably male . 
  person who 's horrible at understanding speech , here : all i could hear was the vowels and the approximants , and it sounded like , `` flanny ` uh roo '' or something . 
  going back i still ca n't hear `` glad you remember '' . 
  how the heck do you parse `` glad you remember '' from that ? 
  i think you 're interpreting these insults as having a little too much weight . 
  it was pretty light-hearted banter with only a little reference to cultural motifs . 
  it was mostly acting out things , not serious . 
  there 's no one there !, 
  it 's so peaceful . 
  same here ... although it was my mother , and i was 6 , and she was pretty nice about it . 
  it was easy to understand because earlier i asked why gold is so valuable and she said it was because it was rare . 
  not only that , but uphill at a jog . 
  op 's gon na be sore all over . 
  could be a bot, 
  not only that , but this is the top post on / r/chemistry . 
  last time i went out for seafood i tried soft shell crab ( usually i like my crabmeat out of the shell ) and i think i prefer just the crabmeat , still . 
  the shell does n't taste very good and the meat tasted a little bland . 
  maybe it was just the resraurant . 
  many worlds says that the entire universe is one big wavefunction , and `` collapse '' is just you getting entangled with the smaller system . 
  copenhagen says collapse actually exists and there really are a lot of tiny wavefunctions . 
  by that logic , middle-schoolers and high-schoolers should never have relationships . 
  ( and , well , plenty of undergrads . ), 
  both of these are photography, 
  the bottom one looks like it would look nice irl, 
  looks like someone has hpv, 
  `` eve rocket '' on duna ( after i landed one on eve and discovered it had nowhere near enough dv to get back ) . 
  that does n't even rhyme !, 
  australian wildlife ? 
  nope nope nope, 
  it is ? 
  i stammer a lot less on `` chance variable '' . 
  linguistics is only a hobby of mine , but i will say that the difference between [ s ] ( at the end of `` chance '' ) and [ v ] ( at the beginning of `` variable '' ) is much greater than the difference between [ m ] and [ v ] . 
  in order to go from [ s ] to [ v ] , you have to slide your tongue backward and bring your lip in . 
  in order to go from [ m ] to [ v ] , all you have to do is open your lips a bit . 
  you could keep the actual computer in a regular tower under the desk , and have the setup plug in to it via usb . 
  we have flow cytometry and coulter counters . 
  it 's the best explanation i could think of . 
  to tell the truth , i do n't find `` random variable '' much easier to say than `` chance variable '' .
