  but even if we do n't attack them at all , ever , they attack us on sight . 
  yeah , that was my first theory . 
  those poor little shy endermen ... 
  why not attack him immediately , then ? 
  a quick note to all those unaware , windows me stands for windows milennium edition , or windows 2000 . 
  only supercomputers are able to run windows me ; only get it if you have professional-grade hardware . 
  also , xp are the roman numerals for a little over three and a half . 
  so , it 's half as expensive as windows 7 , but a little better than half as good . 
  this is why most people have trouble deciding whether to convert . 
  finally , a `` bob '' is an archaic unit of measurement equivalent to roughly a million . 
  if you have acquired microsoft bob , turn it into intel immediately ; they lost the copy they used for watson . 
  oh my god i am so sorry , i meant to pst this on a different subreddit . 
  d : please forgive me !, 
  oh my god , i must have sounded ... 
  i am so , so sorry . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm really sorry ... 
  i do n't even know what i 'm supposed to infer but this soinds hilarious, 
  oh , right , this thing !, 
  i think it was actually the first one i was introduced to . 
  i remember a longer name , though , possibly ending in 2000 . 
  does this ring a bell ? 
  thank you , did so !, 
   whence, 
   from where, 
  this is now my headcanon for minecraft . 
  quick , opinions : is steve a survivor , or was he created ? 
  ( or am i misremembering something crucial ? ), 
  i worked hard for those dirt blocks !, 
  i earned them , with my blood , sweat , and tears . 
  they are going to be passed down in my family for generations to come . 
  i do n't want anyone to steal the fruits of my labors upon which a legacy will be founded !, 
  he had `` whence '' instead of `` once '' . 
  haha , i did n't even think of that !, 
  i guess the logic was that a repeated char can just be declared as a string , but he could n't use strings , so declare \\* two * chars !, 
  yeah , that 's it . 
   i liked sibelius so much better , but i only ever got to use demos of it ... 
  i beleive you, 
  more desirable than making the twelfth chert artifact . 
  you make each, 
  a room . 
  also you are the second person i know who has considered incorporating the hilbert space-filling curve into dwarf fortress , the first being me . 
  :p upvote for you !, 
  once the final round is up , i 'll have no trouble deciding at all . 
  i hate xkcd . 
  which session ? 
  as far as i understand they only scratched their own . 
  it makes you sound like a heart surgeon . 
  are you ? 
  because then i 'm envious . 
  or just proxify.com . 
  seems to be the most popular one . 
  but i guess it can be blocked ? 
  but they 're always the same meteors , just sent to different points in time . 
  dat damn 1 % of upvoters ... 
  oh , okay , i see what he 's ( you 're ? ), 
  saying . 
  thank you !, 
  lol , dude , you should do the closed variant . 
  it actually looks like rooms . 
  but i < 3 the open variant as well !, 
  it 's full of that unnamed colorful molecule-shaped grist !, 
  what 's it called , zillion ? 
  but if you look , the correlation is inverse . 
  the more pirates there are , the less the global average temperature is !, 
  blackbeard must have been an outlier . 
  i imagine they do . 
  seers are a confirmed passive class . 
  i 'm unendingardor , because i prefer rna . 
  and i swear , i read all of that !, 
  i 'm as surprised as you are . 
  i thought it short as well . 
  then i went back and was like , dude , this thing is over a page . 
  yeah , mostly he just kills off characters . 
  especially john . 
  he 's never had pupils . 
  it did n't affect me as much , because of the same reason : hussie is the author , and does whatever the fuck he likes . 
  even now , he is writing lord english 's movements and motives , controlling them on every level . 
  he 's the one orchestrating the whole thing . 
  i would n't be sorry if he died .

  ~ ~ i was only into it before it was cool ~ ~, 
  but they 're made of fucking adamantine . 
  upvote for wit . 
  but keep in mind :, 
   wit is a lean creature with sharp inquiring nose , whereas humor has a kindly eye and a comfortable girth . 
  wit , if it be necessary , uses malice to score a point -- like a cat it is quick to jump -- but humor keeps the peace in an easy chair . 
  wit has a better voice in a solo , but humor comes into the chorus best . 
  wit is as sharp as a stroke of lightning , whereas humor is diffuse like sunlight . 
  wit keeps the season 's fashions and is precise in the phrases and judgments of the day , but humor is concerned with homely eternal things . 
  wit wears silk , but humor in homely-spun endures the wind . 
  wit sets a snare , whereas humor goes off whistling without a victim in its mind . 
  wit is sharper company at the table , but humor serves better in mischance and in the rain . 
  when it tumbles wit is sour , but humor goes uncomplaining without its dinner . 
  humor laughs at another 's jest and holds its sides , while wit sits wrapped in study for a lively answer . 
  why hello , urist mcpumpkinman !, 
  \\  you ca n't run like fuck . 
  i think he means that optifine is awesome .
