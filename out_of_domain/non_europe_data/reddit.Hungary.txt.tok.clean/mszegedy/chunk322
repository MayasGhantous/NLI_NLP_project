  anyway , he is so concerned about copyright maybe partly because it 's about money , which he thinks should be rightfully his , but i think it 's mostly because he 's deathly terrified about someone stealing his ideas to pass off as their own . 
  ( if i had as many ideas as him , i 'd be scared too ! ), 
  i think his concern is not totally warranted , and if he does make it big , he * will * have to get comfortable with the idea of piracy . 
  you left out the smog though . 
  holy heck how did you find that ? 
  it 's why i do n't like cake . 
  on the other hand , for some reason , i love kal\u00e1cs , which is also sweetened bread . 
  i think the difference is that cake is spongy and crumbly whereas kal\u00e1cs is soft and tears off in tufts . 
  edit : google for some reason will show a poppyseed roll if you google the word . 
  kal\u00e1cs is , in fact , just sweetened bread , cooked in a braid . 
  especially if made with cocoa or coconut . 
  have you ever been to sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld / szeklerland ? 
  they make the best k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs there . 
  yeah , i realized . 
  :\\ i do n't like this person , even more now . 
  that makes sense . 
  the lord of ... light . 
  ( who has a time turner ), 
  my stove/oven is from 1955 . 
  all you need for a fun chemistry kit is an electrolysis thingy , magnesium , silver nitrate , and a whole lot of non-nitrate salts . 
  edit : i said electrophoresis instead of electrolysis . 
  whoops . 
  bosnia and herzegovina . 
  huh ? 
  i like people a lot ... 
  ah mostly could n't anschluss anything at all , actually ; as far as i know b&h was its only major addition after 1867 . 
  it got defeated in battle by serbia , russia , [ itself ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar%c3%a1nsebes ) ( although that one was more habsburg than ah ) ... its only victory was against the italian army , and that 's not a big feat . 
  that was a lot of anschluss . 
  ` find - name ` has always bothered me . 
  so , i thought it was a plant virus , from the title . 
  `` nuclear '' i thought meant the virus required entry into the cell nucleus ( like most viruses ) . 
  yes . 
  legos are not turing complete , sadly, 
  it taught me exactly how much percent hw is worth of my grade . 
  :\\ ( i already learned orbital mechanics from osmos . 
  using mindstorms is cheating . 
  i meant the bricks . 
  yup . 
  the only complexity introduced by 3d , though , is that to change your orbital inclination , you need to do a normal burn at an ascending/descending node . 
  prograde and radial vectors remain a thing . 
  ( it also showed me something ksp did n't : how orbits behave in an accretion disk . ), 
  when i made my comment , i did n't realize there was an article ; i thought a layman was asking a question . 
  that 's fine since it 's backwards-compatible with regular notation . 
  ` - name ` though looks like four one-letter flags and there 's nothing to tell you otherwise except the man pages . 
  stability . 
  it would break apart really quickly if you did n't use glue , not even anywhere near building size , let alone planet-size . 
  if you built a planet out of legos , then it 'd be forced into hydrostatic equilibrium and it would become spherical , and the legos in the middle would get crushed to ... petroleum or something . 
  i guess then you could try casting the petroleum into more useful-shaped parts , or try to make some form of glue so you could make more stable lego machines . 
  also , if you had enough legos , you could turn them into a star and get iron , which can be reforged into useful parts . 
  on the stability of large lego structures : the largest i 've seen that was n't stationary and glued is the ball that mythbusters constructed to roll down a hill . 
  it broke into a lot of pieces very quickly . 
  the video is on youtube somewhere . 
  probably the most stable pattern you could make from 2x8s is a graphite-like pattern with layers of tesselating zig-zags overlaid in an alternating 90 \u00b0 turn pattern . 
  but then maybe not ; building internal struts might be a better option for large structures . 
  k. eric drexler did a lot of research on the lifetime and stability of machine parts as a function of size of components , which he conveniently gathered together in his book * nanosystems * ( itself a rewrite of his thesis ) . 
  i have a copy ; i 'll get back to you with the numbers once i get home and take a look at it . 
  i think the amount of failures per unit time was inversely proportional to side length , though . 
  i 'm not sure how well that can be applied to legos however . 
  i wonder what a structural engineer would say about this business . 
  we might be able to work this out ourselves by empirically determining the strength of a lego bond and then extrapolating using a graph-theoretic approach or something like that . 
  knew it before looking at the link !, 
  really though why exactly is it that he used aqua regia rather than a more common compound ? 
  is gold so strongly bonded ? 
  completely wrong . 
  this is a very old satirical copypasta from 4chan . 
  why is it that well-shaded , well-composed entries with a lot of artistic thought put into them like yours ^ ( and mine ) ^ ^ and ^ ^ [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandballart/comments/1qifl6/saskatchewan/ ) ^ ^ [ one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandballart/comments/1qifl6/saskatchewan/ ) get 23 votes , while everything else gets ... more ? 
  on one hand , you used the word `` semiotic '' correctly in a sentence . 
  on the other hand , you added an obnoxious gif at the end that makes you look way too proud about it . 
  i 'd 've preferred coke to beer but anyway that looks like a fantastic time !, 
  i was like , `` chamber of secrets ? 
  whatever the sixth book was named , i ca n't remember ? '', 
  you know what would be an appropriate name for the struggle today 's generation is facing ? 
  world war one . 
  yes , because the frustrating thing about gypsies is that they 're impossible to exterminate completely ? 
  what is this bullshit ? 
  please provide evidence against the interdependency theorem , then . 
  i have no clue what hidden agenda you are pushing but let 's make something clear :, 
  - this is the only solution to the problem that we * have . 
  * banning it is like banning the axiom of choice from / r/math . 
  - it 's parsimonious and non-perturbative , with no hidden complexity . 
  - it 's non-ftl and cpt-symmetric . 
  granted there is no evidence for it yet , but how could there be ? 
  i 'm sorry , but when evidence is lacking for any side then you resort to occam 's razor , and when you apply occam 's razor you get the interdependency theorem , the same way you get to `` there is no god '' and `` many-worlds is true '' . 
  i 'd hate to see this sub go , but if you 're going to take away our right to free speech ( moreover , * correct * speech ) , then i 'm leaving . 
  hey , learn some introductory linguistics and stay a while !, 
  it 's a really fun field and i 'd hate to see you forget about it . 
  although , really , anybody can into lesotho flair . 
  and iran , ireland , ivory coast , and italy . 
  in * texas * , wow !, 
  if you had a 2 inch dick then yes it would !, 
  if you take the definition of male vs. female as wolffian vs. m\u00fcllerian duct , then technically we start out male and then very quickly become both male and female and then later drop one or the other ( kind of like my double major in human biology and biomedical engineering , heheheheh ) . 
  on the other hand if you look at the external genitalia , it 's pretty much ambiguous ; it 's not like differentiation of the sex organs is a much more drastic process for males than for females . 
  i will never understand how `` bad at driving '' has historically been considered a valid stereotype about women . 
  ( or chinese for that matter ; you 've got to have really impressive skills to navigate those monster intersections ), 
  exactly !, 
  by all judgement , she is a * great * driver . 
  hungarian here : nearly all hungarians are this racist or worse . 
  the cross-section on reddit actually contains proportionally more non-racists than there actually are as a whole . 
  i have never met a hungarian face-to-face who was n't a racist of some sort . 
  and would n't the red stripe be orange anyway ?
