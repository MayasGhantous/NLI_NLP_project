  great gif , but unable to teach the concept on its own , since it goes too fast to be able to understand clearly . 
  that 's horrible , but i do n't think it needed a thesaurus . 
  it sounds more like they specifically thought , `` what 's the most complicated way i can phrase this ? '', 
  upvoted , bookmarked and saved !, 
  these are really great , especially the `` microscale transport '' one . 
  ( i am a recent graduate as well ; these are lifesavers . ), 
  it 's a little bad . 
  people are n't just their genes . 
  well , then why did he say that he liked it because the guy `` understood that genetic diversity is good to have in a species '' ? 
  we do n't tolerate other races for their * genes . 
  * it 's because they are humans like us , and feeling , thinking individuals who have just as much to contribute as us . 
  thinking of people as genetic packages is dehumanizing . 
  i mean , having it as a thought at some point is okay , because it * is * a benefit , but having it as your * first * thought ? 
  like it 's the most important thing about interracial marriage ? 
  you should always assume that when you have enough energy to create a new particle , the new particle gets created . 
  what 's weird is , even though my parents are `` asian '' in most senses of the word , in this case the roles were reversed : `` go get a girlfriend already . '', 
  `` what ? 
  why ? 
  i already barely have enough time to study . '', 
  i 'm not talking about you , i 'm talking about / u/andrewjamesdrake . 
  he specifically asked , `` is it bad that my reaction to this is : ` finally , a family that understands that genetic diversity is a good thing to have in a species ' ? '', 
  if that 's really his first and only reaction , then yes , that 's bad . 
  sorry for the ambiguity !, 
  i guess trying to make your comments concise comes with the price of misunderstanding . 
  that 's no cone ... that 's an * inverse square * cone . 
  i think the problem with shibe is that it gets very repetitive very quickly . 
  there 's only a limited set of words to choose from : `` very '' , `` many '' , `` much '' , `` such '' , and `` wow '' . 
  if it had a larger and more variable vocabulary , then it would n't be so boring . 
  you know , having a big brother is n't actually so bad ... 
  many wisdom, 
  we do n't really have the option to change the dna of somatic cells , yet , at all ( the exception is [ gene therapy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gene_therapy ) , but it 's only for a very small amount of cells and is usually only used to treat cancer and genetic disorders ) . 
  genes are only for at most a couple proteins at a time , so you ca n't use gene therapy to make someone grow another limb or something . 
  in fact , all of the major features of a person 's body are the result of a development process that begins before birth . 
  for example , the order in which your body parts are is determined by the [ homeobox ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeobox ) sequence . 
  as you can imagine , this is only relevant very early during the development of organisms ; changing all the homeobox genes in all of your cells now would n't rearrange your body . 
  so , if your function ca n't be done by expressing a few proteins , it ca n't be done . 
  ( on the other hand , it 's possible to activate built-in biochemical processes , such as cell [ apoptosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apoptosis ) , by sending a signaling protein . 
  most of these are pointless , though , and very hard to control . 
  one real-world application of activating apoptosis is trying to activate it in only cancer cells . ), 
  unfortunately , if there is n't a protein that already does what you want to do , you do n't have a good chance of making one that does . 
  protein design is very , very complicated business , mostly because they are very wiggly and the way they behave can be a matter of even quantum mechanics , which takes a lot of time to compute . 
  sometimes we use [ directed evolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed_evolution ) to nudge a protein that already sort of does what we want in a direction that makes it do what we want better . 
  this wo n't always work , though , because you need a regulatory protein that binds the product . 
  as for time , it depends , but usually it takes less than a minute for a protein to get expressed to a noticeable level ( the process of making one protein lasts less than a second , i think ; here 's a [ fairly accurate animation ] ( http://www.dnalc.org/view/15481-translation-rna-to-protein-3d-animation-with-no-audio.html ) ; it 's slowed down very much , but i 'm not sure what order of magnitude ) , and it 'll hang around for at least several minutes before it gets broken down ( if you give the signal to break it down straightaway ) . 
  for reference [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/hyfjux5ly3q ) is a glowing protein immediately getting expressed and then degraded , tied to the cell cycle . 
  this might not be the best example , because it 's not clear when the regulation begins and ends , but you should still be able to get a sense of how quickly protein levels rise . 
  this does n't take into account the amount of time that it takes the virus to infect you in the first place , though . 
  the eclipse period ( the `` setup '' period , when it 's still trying to get its genes expressed , not yet making any proteins ) of a virus is , on average , about 10 hours , but it depends on the virus . 
  hiv , a common lysogenic virus ( meaning it inserts its dna directly into the genome , as opposed to leaving it floating around in the cell ) , has an eclipse period of somewhere between 5 and 10 days , depending on luck . 
  the length of the eclipse period of adenovirus ( a family of viruses used for gene therapy ) is about 15 or 17 hours , depending on strain , but if you want the gene to stick around then it is n't appropriate to use . 
  for hurdles , [ the `` problems '' section of the gene therapy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gene_therapy#problems ) article sums it up pretty well . 
  by the way , what 's stopping some asshole in your world from printing themselves some ebola , or smallpox ? 
  no problem , i love talking about this stuff . 
  occasionally i fantasize about what biochemistry-related movies i 'd make if i were to become a screenwriter but that will pretty much never happen . 
  i 'm glad i could contribute . 
  you should probably stick around for what everyone else has to say . 
  i might have gotten a few things wrong , or left stuff out . 
  did you catch all of my edits ? 
  i kept editing stuff in ; sorry about that . 
   small human tissue that was created with a biological printer to test certain medications, 
  hmm ... biological printers only print cells you 've already inserted into them ( in this case , probably hela cells ) . 
  they ca n't print arbitrary cells , in the same way your printer ca n't print with arbitrary fluids if you only give it ink . 
  for making cells with arbitrary genes , you 'd need oligonucleotide synthesis machinery , plus a whole lot of other things . 
  if you want to take a look at the kind of machinery it takes to make genes ( and gene vectors ) from scratch , then you should visit a place that does it . 
  if you live in the bay area , i know [ dna 2.0 ] ( https://www.dna20.com/ ) does tours . 
  or , of course , you could just handwave it with , `` this is the future , '' which would be a reasonable thing to do . 
  i got it right , though ... 
  we 've already been able to eliminate gray hair , heheheh . 
  he also sells little colorful acrylic models of different biomolecules . 
  i just ordered his panorama poster right now . 
  now , the question is , why would dirk be dating meenah ? 
  eh , more like too few tanks, 
  i was talking to / u/jwreno the whole time , though . 
  first i directly replied to you , saying , `` it 's a little bad , '' and then the rest of the time it was a back-and-forth between me and / u/jwreno . 
  i 'd call it an `` s-smash '' ; the official guides call it a `` side smash '' . 
  wow , i 've always wondered where that was from !, 
  thanks !, 
  if you insert a dx dy on the left , and a double integral on the right , you get ... y = 1 ? 
  * i thought it was jane !, 
  this ... is wrong . 
  jesus christ who writes their master 's thesis in fucking * word ? 
  ** bibtex . 
  now . 
  well , a sprained ankle is a bigger deal in basketball than in hockey . 
  in hockey , you 're skating , whereas in basketball , you 're jumping around . 
  more foot movement . 
  it took me about 10 times as long to read your meme as it takes me to read a regular meme . 
  i kept getting distracted by the fist pump . 
  that 's true , but i still think having skates makes getting around easier . 
  in hockey , you balance and rearrange your feet mostly in a plane . 
  in basketball , you balance and rearrange your feet , but you have to push off of them any time you want to move at all , and you have to lift them up in three dimensions . 
  ( i do n't think that 's enough to account for the disparity between a broken tibia and an ankle sprain , though . ), 
  [ that is , this one ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dark-knight-4-pane ), 
  or even just latex, 
  on an iphone , it looks like you wrote 7080 wpm . 
  i was like , `` it must be a formatting thing ... he probably wrote 70 ^ 80 wpm and it did n't render . '', 
  it seemed reasonable because often i 'll see 1070 where it 's really 10 ^ ( 70 ) , training me to think that a digit-zero-digit-zero pattern has a superscript in the center . 
  ( my comment is gon na be kinda confusing for iphone users ), 
  i have struggled with listening my entire life . 
  it is very , very hard , and i have sympathy for those that do n't do it .
