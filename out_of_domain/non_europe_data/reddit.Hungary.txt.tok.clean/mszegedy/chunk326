  if you were truly in a survival situation , where would you get magnesium from ? 
  have you ever done bash scripting ? 
  are your important text files stored in a plaintext format ( e.g. 
  latex ) ? 
  have you ever needed to do image processing ? 
  if so then programming should be invaluable . 
  probably the best thing i 've written is a perl parser that takes a very plaintext notes file ( with no header or footer , with lines beginning with hyphens as bullet points and colons as headers and with tabs signaling greater levels of nesting of enumerated lists ) and turns it into a pretty latex file . 
  then i wrote a vim syntax file that made syntax highlighting for my note language . 
  collectively it improved my notetaking speed greatly , and has allowed me to just concatenate note files with a bash script to turn into a pretty study guide . 
  writing the perl took 2 hours . 
  writing the bash script to concatenate files took less than a minute . 
  writing the vimscript took an embarrassingly long 6 hours and probably was n't worth it . 
  then there 's also miscellaneous situations where it comes in handy . 
  for example , in late-game risk , turns take really long amounts of time because everybody has large amounts of troops and attack other places with large amounts of troops . 
  a simple python program to simulate rolling the dice a jillion times will work very well to speed up the game . 
  right , i figured that out several seconds after i put forth the `` superscript '' theory . 
  titan is absolutely covered in oil ( not literally crude oil , but lots of different hydrocarbons that could totally be used as fuel ) , but america 's not invading it . 
  * this * one is deeper ? 
  then again , comparing it to dick jokes and such ... 
  would n't g\u00f6del 's incompleteness theorems invalidate this idea , if we 're looking at expressing every possible kind of thought ? 
   i 'm pretty sure most professional biologist share this viewpoint , at least the ones with whom i work . 
  we 're in this field to share our passion and results with the world . 
  i believe there is a very powerful , `` this is awesome , come look at these results ! '', 
  mentality in the community , or maybe thats just how i am . 
  same !, 
  over and over i 've heard described `` academia-itis '' , where publishing becomes a matter of ego and prestige , and other people in the field are competition , but then going into biology i 've found that everybody is friendly and cooperative . 
  we are n't entirely free of it , for example we still do n't like to publish negative results as much , but it 's a lot better than some people would have you believe about other fields . 
  you should n't be scared ; / u/thrillreefer [ put it best ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1qwa0f/revenge_of_the_amateur_biologists_the_diy_movement/cdhlw0a ) : `` ameteur biologists threaten professional biology about as much as amateur astronomers threaten nasa . '', 
  without funding and a proper lab , you ca n't get very far . 
  * maybe * you should be happy . 
  hah , my grandmother on my father 's side always used to gather recipes from around the family . 
  she had a potato recipe from my uncle , a cauliflower recipe from me , a soup recipe from my grandfather . 
  staying at her place was very interesting food-wise . 
  unfortunately she recently died of leukemia . 
  all her recipes are in a book she wrote down , though . 
  well , it 's happened to me , so i believe it . 
  this is how my iphone screen still has n't broken after 5 years of use : i always manage to catch it with * something * , whether it 's my shirt , or my foot , or whatever , and i get real lucky besides . 
  once i put it into my shirt thinking i was putting it into my pocket , but it fell through my shirt and onto the ground . 
  luckily , it was slowed down by my shirt and it landed on hollow ceramic brick , on its corner , so its screen did n't break ; all it did was get a little nick . 
  that 's pretty much the only thing that ever happens : it gets a nick . 
  i kind of like the `` battle-damaged '' look it gives it . 
  edit : my god , it 's been 6 years since the iphone has come out ... 
  one of my uncles used to pluck his hair out hair by hair when he was thinking about a difficult problem . 
  he 's mostly bald now , and works at google . 
  ( i do n't think he ever stopped doing it , actually . ), 
  holy shit that 's my keyboard !, 
  the cheapest wireless ergonomic keyboard there is , right ? 
  asking a 1st grader about their past ? 
  pretty sure all i could remember as a 1st grader was my two years of preschool beforehand . 
  not so good a video , but you 're * amazing * at counter strike . 
  `` wow , i have adobe after effects ! '', 
  i agree with your sentiment - what the hell is this post supposed to mean ? 
  do n't we have this kind of thing already , but with only one rotating chamber ? 
  i ca n't remember what it was called ... 
  but cops like it when you slow down in front of them . 
  exact same spot -  exact same distance from problematic turn, 
  the rest ? 
  couch/comfy chair . 
  then why did n't he say that ? 
  what 's the point of specifying `` man '' , as opposed to , say , something relevant , like `` nice '' ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  it was funnier with the original text, 
  how did you get `` satyr '' from `` pan '' ? 
  ^ ( ( do n't worry i know how ) ^ ), 
  geez , you ca n't use a curseword and three questions in a row on the internet without sounding frantic , can you ? 
  ( oh shit that was a fourth one ) yes , it * was * a spur-of-the-moment thing , but it came out awkward and sounding sexist . 
  that 's not something worth putting on a socially awesome penguin meme and posting to reddit . 
  that one actually goes `` hhhehehe '' . 
  [ here 's a vector image . 
  it comes from brazilians specifically . 
  once , someone posted a picture of a crane game . 
  i mean like one of those boxes you see in shitty arcades at theme parks and hotels for kids . 
  technically gaming , i guess ... 
  yeah i mean it 's reasonable as a thing you say without thinking , i 'm just kind of clueless as to why it 's on reddit ... 
  too much overall jpg i think , it makes it a little too hard to read, 
  ah , i know how you did that !, 
  really cool-looking , 
  i 've seen these before , i just never bookmarked them and i could n't find them later when i needed them . 
  thanks !, 
  but they answered `` no '' . 
  ... `` girl logic '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  it 's tasty , but not as tasty as chocolate chip . 
  i 'd never take off my shirt , it would expose my bad posture . 
  not if he does n't have a good graphics card, 
   the definition of sexism, 
  not a definition , but a general example certainly . 
  i was actually pleasantly surprised by / r/cringepics 's response to that post . 
  i expected them to mostly not even consider the fact that it 's really the guy who is getting embarrassed . 
  japan is actually one of the very few countries that plays american football , though . 
  i kinda like it ... 
  i was thinking more like those little moles that grow out in 3d and hang out of your body that you later have to get cut off by surgeons . 
  glue together end to end . 
  the words `` abccb '' and `` xyzzy '' concatenated together is `` abccbxyzzy '' . 
  ( if you do it in the other order , it 's `` xyzzyabccb '' . ), 
  it comes from latin `` catena '' , `` chain '' . 
  but it 's not interesting to look at . 
  kurwa/kurva is a lot weaker than fuck . 
  slavs and hungarians use it all the time , whereas anglophones only use `` fuck '' occasionally . 
  i am disappointed that grad school is not on the list .
