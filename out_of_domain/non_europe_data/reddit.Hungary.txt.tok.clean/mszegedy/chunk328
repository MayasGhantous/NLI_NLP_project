  it was in one of those `` psa : do n't shave your ass , trim it '' threads . 
  was there ever a mario kart game where you could get blue shells to orbit you ? 
  ( other than , you know , that characteristic turn they make before fucking your shit ), 
  reminds me of xkcd 's duck loop . 
  one of the comics i actually like, 
  is n't the first one not so terrifying and the other unlikely ? 
  [ it 's kind of inescapable though . 
  ] ( http://lesswrong.com/lw/k4/do_we_believe_everything_were_told/ ), 
  i am in the process of building a mathematica/pi device that i may have to distribute many of and this is perfect . 
  unfortunately it 's not really a transitive verb , is it ? 
  not me , i did eva when i was on the ground !, 
  i ignored it because i did n't know what it did , and then i went on this sub and learned that you can put kerbals outside of spaceships , and i put 2 and 2 together and figured that that 's what it did . 
  i guess there 's 2 or more kinds of people ... 
  ( czech ), 
  ( spoilers ), 
  why is n't his symbol of power the steam logo ? 
  or , you know , the symbol on the power button :p, 
  a teaching tool is exactly what i 'm using it for . 
  some weeks ago i got fed up with using a graphing calculator ( i tutor high school students in my spare time ) , and began to devise an alternative solution . 
  i already had a raspberry pi ; i ordered a battery and miniature keyboard for it , as well as a pico projector ( for projecting onto the surface of the desk ) . 
  i put a pirated copy of mathematica on the pi ( could n't find a way to transfer the one i already payed for ) , wrote a few scripts that do useful things ( such as show slope fields , illustrate integrals , show solutions to differential equations , that kind of stuff ) , and pre-rendered a few animations that show essential concepts ( i 'm still in the process of that one ) . 
  i designed a bracket to hold the thing together , and , once the 3d printing gets done ( over the weekend , i 'll go to a place that does it ) , i 'll have an arm-mounted teaching tool !, 
  i 've already demoed it sans bracket to a lot of teachers at the school , and at least one of them would be willing to pay me to build such a device for them , and i 've been scratching my head over just putting another pirated copy on the duplicate or selling it with the price of mathematica included . 
  this solves my problem !, 
  ... your government-mandated supplier is * fisher ? 
  * that 's kind of funny actually, 
  clicking through those fast is like watching a stop motion film . 
  seriously did you press the screenshot button every 6 seconds or something ? 
  ( great job on the mission , by the way ), 
  i 'll make a post on / r/buildapc once i 've printed the bracket . 
  in the meantime enjoy [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gtsauf2.jpg ) ( sorry for potato ) . 
  what i 've learned is if you 're handling a complicated piece of equipment , never press a button until you know what it does . 
  otherwise , you might change things in a way that might be hard to fix . 
  they 're adorable !, 
  - time traveling ( limited ), 
  - invisibility, 
  - mastery over mind magic, 
  - can turn anything into anything , in small amounts ( why has n't he made nanobots yet ? 
  somebody needs to buy him a copy of drexler 's * nanosystems * ), 
  - has a map that tells the location of everyone in hogwarts in real time, 
  not overomnipotent , but overpowered all right . 
  when this happened to me , it was on mun , so i used by jetpack . 
  unfortunately , i self-destructed all of the kerbals that way , so i ended up not having to send another rescue mission ( yay ... ? 
  good luck to him ever actually crashing into one of those . 
  so many goo containers !, 
  o_o why would you ever need all of those ? 
  cool arm !, 
  is it kas ? 
  oh god , once i screwed up my microwave so bad i had to do a hardware reset . 
  never again . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ no , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ bioengineer . 
  mine was just :, 
  step 2 : fingernails, 
  step 4 : attempt to use other pieces as leverage, 
  i specifically told my mom not to cut my fingernails so short , and to leave at least 2 mm or so . 
  in a way , it is ... just two of them . 
  technically , it actually is . 
  no , it 's definitely a religion ( although they teach you self-help techniques as well ) , but it 's also a capital e evil organization that does proper brainwashing , and humanitarian crimes . 
  [ some of the worst is outlined here . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientology_controversies#treatment_of_members ), 
  i 'm having a hard time imagining a polygon with five sides and not five angles . 
  luckily , [ this ] ( http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5282 ) happened before i found that out . 
  edit : oh , i thought this was another thread . 
  but yeah , that 's what happened . 
  i wrote the algorithms on my laptop . 
  huh , til polygons can be self-intersecting . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : but , then ... the guy in the picture is incorrect . 
  sorry , what i mean is , i did n't install mathematica on it until after the news came out that the engine got redone for arm . 
  for the demo , i used the internet version of mathics . 
  ah , i see where the confusion is coming from . 
  what i meant is , i * intended * to put a pirated copy of mathematica on the pi , without realizing that mathematica would n't work on it . 
  i only got as far as building the device and installing raspbian , without installing mathematica , so i never ran into that problem , because i never installed mathematica . 
  but now i have , following this great news . 
  i do n't know !, 
  all i know is whenever i tried to enter numbers , it entered letters instead , and no button i could press could put it back to normal . 
  why does a microwave have a letter mode anyway ? 
  but saying that it has 5 angles when it has * more * than 5 angles violates the [ maxim of quantity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cooperative_principle#maxim_of_quantity ) . 
  wait , cancer is bad for you ? 
  could you please explain this ? 
  75 km for me, 
  tried it already . 
  did n't work . 
  i think i 'm gon na have to fuck around with the gtkrc . 
  you 're thinking of eve . 
  the bg of the tray stays white , as does that of the cpu monitor . 
  the icons randomly switch between having black and white backgrounds , between boots . 
  if you had enough blue , you could collect it and re-emit it as higher-energy photons . 
  you could turn those into electron-positron pairs by passing them in front of nuclei , but i do n't know where you 'd get protons from . 
  assuming you found a way though , you can use fusion to make carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen from the protons . 
  arrange those and the protons and electrons in the correct way and you get chocolate . 
  so , no . 
  probably because it 's better . 
  ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
  right , and i 'm asking whether there was ever any mk where you can do that with blue shells . 
  yes , i landed some 10m from the shore . 
  except scotland will get to secede sometime, 
  wow , yes , making websites !, 
  really fulfilling , there . 
  there are so many better things you could have picked , even just within the realm of programming .
