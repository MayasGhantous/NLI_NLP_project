  cool , i have the same card !, 
  mine is from asus . 
  how do you like yours ? 
  do n't downvote this guy , it 's possible . 
  everything is either black or white . 
  why are you getting downvoted . 
  this is more or less correct . 
  although it 's 4 colors per palette , and one graphical tile is a single palette . 
  but you have the right idea . 
  me , when i 'm disorganized . 
  also , do you play a string instrument ? 
  now i 'm curious . 
  did it say something stupid , correcting something ? 
  it exists, 
  and i thought my dirt house was pretty cool ... :(,

  this is my new favorite seed , as it spawns you in a huge jungle biome . 
  well , mine does n't have a vga port , rather , an hdmi , a dvi , and a displayport port . 
  oh , and it comes overclocked to 710 mhz or whatever . 
  but yeah , i doubt there 's much difference . 
  i really like it !, 
  and one of the , like , two reasons i bought it is to play minecraft on settings other than very short and fast . 
  the other is portal . 
  mine is kinda loud , but i can bear it . 
  my asrock motherboard , the 88gxh/usb3 , also comes with integrated graphics . 
  ironically , it supports sli/crossfire , but the card does n't .

  [ i 'd say knight is active . 
  what , with 4 ellipses ? 
  i know , i know !, 
  i just wanted a succinct answer that displayed dave being very active . 
  he certainly was n't defending anyone , just kicking ass in spectacular fashion . 
  does n't look too passive to me . 
  ya , i was talking about dave : accelerate , which you said was a bad example . 
  i never said or thought that passive = no control of powers . 
  i understand what you 're talking about . 
  i really do !, 
  although i might even disagree with you on that active/passive are strictly `` give good to self '' as opposed to `` give good to allies '' . 
  i think the difference is much looser than that . 
  more like , passive powers are more `` spread out '' , activated for long periods of time over large areas , benefiting one as well as one 's teammates . 
  meanwhile , active powers are much more acute , able to be utilized in specific instances for specific purposes . 
  whether this is for one 's own benefit or the benefit of one 's fellow players is dependent on the action itself . 
  ooh , ( semi - ) literal clear black and white !, 
  i like this perspective , a lot . 
  i might start using it !, 
  the save gets high and raves about a rainbow for three minutes ? 
  look at it this way , you get link karma for it ( which is much harder to obtain ) .

  mother of god ... the best part is that to new readers the former looks like it is foreshadowing pm 's obtention of the sword from jack . 
  actually , rereading , that 's what ** i ** thought .
