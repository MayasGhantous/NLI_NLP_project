  red does not blend into yellow well , not at that resolution . 
  he has schizophrenia . 
  he 's very good at programming , in any case . 
  his welfare allows him to work on his projects 24/7 , which is pretty cool imo . 
  would n't `` potato '' best refer to the incas ? 
  hamburgers , of course . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  it looks like almost 20 minutes to get to the top , if i were in tip-top athletic shape . 
  where do you think you are ? 
  yeah , but who says i 'm psychologically fit to live in antarctica ? 
  you do n't have to not know the scientific method to be a crackpot . 
  all you have to do is love a theory so much that you ca n't let it go . 
  plenty of people who are otherwise good scientists can do that . 
  ( iirc zephir is a rabbit farmer , though ? 
  still does n't mean he does n't know about the scientific method . ), 
  when i was 9 i managed to convince an adult i was related to hitler . 
  oh god it was terrible . 
  well , whatever , she and her family were slightly nutjobs anyway . 
  that 's the proper way to use it though ? 
  as somebody who 's never seen jurassic park , i doubt i would have been able to guess that it means `` dinosaurs '' without having absorbed jp from pop culture . 
  hungarian : our postpositions agglutinate to the ends of our nouns sometimes !, 
  no , that 's the verbs : \u00f6sszepaprik\u00e1sithatatlans\u00e1goskod\u00e1saitok\u00e9rt is , at its core , a noun made verb , with a ( postposition-derived ) modifier stuck to the beginning , and a modifier , a conjugation , a cast to an adjective , a cast to a noun , another modifier , a declension , and a postposition stuck to the end . 
  what kind of person ca n't load images ? 
  maybe if you set your browser to ultra-hipster mode ... or is there some dark corner of a city where there is an office building that prohibits images in their browsers ? 
  also , two of them are n't even chemical reactions ( okay for this sub , not okay for cracked to be calling chemical reactions ), 
  it 's empty on the inside . 
  wow good job getting reference, 
  guys , this is a troll . 
  leave it at -5 . 
  i 'm offended by this article . 
  just because i 'm getting a phd it means that i have a one-track mind ? 
  i have bses in biongineering and * physics * . 
  i want to focus on the most important thing first , so that 's what i 'm doing . 
  ( relatedly , francis crick is my role model . ), 
  ah , about that middle paragraph , i had n't heard that part yet . 
  that 's strange , considering how lucidly he discusses sigma values . 
  of course !, 
  but then it would decay . 
  have you heard of [ muonic atoms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muonic_atom#muonic_atoms ) ? 
  while technically you 're talking about the same physical thing that i am , what i am teaching the course on is in the context that cells make proteins to do stuff for them , not the context that humans eat proteins . 
  it 's much more interesting to talk about proteins as machines than as something to digest !, 
  plus , i do n't know the first thing about dieting . 
  :p i 'll consider crossposting though !, 
  it would be kind of a funny crossover of the two `` fields '' .

  [ `` essentially equal to the lifetime of a muon '' ] ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0611121.pdf ), 
  i left at bromine turning into bromide, 
  edit : although that 's technically a thing, 
  do n't expect to learn an incredible amount of biochem from this course . 
  this is intended to be an in-depth study of proteins , and probably wo n't discuss a lot of specific metabolic processes . 
  it 's more about learning how succinate dehydrogenase works than learning its role in the cac . 
  of course , a lot of biochem stuff might osmose over anyway . 
  that will be determined after i plan out the curriculum more thoroughly . 
  then you 've come to the right place !, 
  not anything directly relevant , no . 
  sorry if i cluttered up your subreddit , you can delete this post if you like . 
  you would learn * why * you need protein , and , incidentally , why certain steroids are bad for you , but that can be summarized in a paragraph , and is tangential at best . 
  99 % of the course material would be totally irrelevant to bodily fitness . 
  i ( and someone else ) just thought you might be interested !, 
  in hungary , we use commas for decimals ( and we use spaces to separate thousands , but i think the comma thing is universal ) . 
  huh , that was an interesting thing to research . 
  thanks for showing me !, 
  now , on one hand i 'd like to say campbell knows what he 's doing , since he 's had a lot more experience in the field than me , and nutritional biochemistry is n't exactly my field either , but on the other hand he simply does n't have good evidence supporting him . 
  if you look at [ studies ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304383591902002 ) done on whey protein , it actually inhibits tumor in mice !, 
  the way that animal protein is supposed to cause cancer is that it raises your igf-1 levels , which is a simple signaling protein that tells your cells to grow . 
  ( the gf stands for `` growth factor '' . ), 
  however , i only found exactly [ one paper ] ( http://edrv.endojournals.org/content/15/1/80.short ) that 's supposed to link animal protein consumption to rise in levels of igf-1 , and it 's paywalled . 
  ( i mean , the other paper was paywalled too , but at least it explained everything in the abstract . 
  this one is clearly more sketchy . ), 
  i ended up not being able to find out the mechanism by which it 's supposed to do this that ca n't also be done by plant proteins . 
  meanwhile , i found out that legume proteins [ inhibit digestion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-nutritional_factor#examples ) , by binding to the digestive enzymes . 
  who knew ? 
  conclusion : probably not , but i 'd love to see more research either way on this . 
  turning up only two particularly relevant papers is n't so good . 
  i feel bad about not getting it until the comment you replied to, 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  about the only thing you left out was how they help synthesis , namely by providing amino acids you ca n't make . 
  excellent !, 
  if i get enough applicants , the course rolls out in february, 
  i usually do n't like linking to xkcd , but it hits the nail right on the head with respect to the reaction i always have to this visualization : http://xkcd.com/895/, 
  thanks , but nutritional biochemistry is a little outside my field !, 
  i work in protein engineering , designing protein mechanisms . 
  no harm in looking though of course ... 
  huh , this comment was doing well last night . 
  i dunno what happened . 
  that makes me wonder whether one could create a sort of zephir-bot . 
  it would have two behaviors : one where it looks for words like `` electron '' , `` energy '' , `` time '' , and `` quantum '' in the article and article title , and recites the appropriate awt lore in response , and another one where it copies sections out of comments on the article . 
  i 'll bet it would rely on the same basic structure as a regular summary-bot !, 
  while you raise a good point that the anti-intellectualism in this article might not be indicative of cracked as a whole , i 'm afraid to say that its tone is pretty much actually consistent with the rest of cracked . 
  it seems `` hip and accessible '' has morphed into `` too cool for school '' with them , which is unfortunate . 
  almost all of cracked is lists . 
  and calculus is letters anyway . 
  and chemistry has nothing to do with calculus for the most part . 
  these people suck . 
  oh , do n't worry , i will !, 
  that will be covered in the section on garbage collection and amyloid fiber . 
  suction , for the brief time we have atmosphere, 
  your course sounds higher-level than mine !,
