  i think this is the most impressive/creative post on this sub so far . 
  i think black is the only color that can dual as both a non-metal and metal . 
  there 's many examples of it behaving this way ; see , for example , the estonian flag . 
  i agree that it makes the flag more complicated , but it 's still a simple flag that way . 
  i think your version looks cooler if you know regex . 
  it 's more elegant !, 
  also you forgot the backslash on the period . 
  hooray !, 
  one day , our field will beat out the historians in tracking human movements ... ( probably never ), 
  oh yeah , so it is !, 
  in order to solve the business with escapes , i guess it would be more prudent to indent it by four spaces to make a code line , or enclose it in backticks . 
  ftfy :, 
  the second one also carries the additional pun of `` pipe bomb '' in the stem of the fork , although that 's not especially relevant . 
  anyone else sad that this form of fork bomb no longer works in modern bash ? 
  at the very least you have to give the function a real name , and additionally even if it works it does n't do anything . 
  security  coolness i guess . 
  i 'd eat it, 
  deunglish, 
  shit , you 're right . 
  ~ ~ when i tried it in mint it complained that i ca n't name a function '' : '' , and then when i renamed it it handled it so it would n't go out of contr ~ ~ no wait that was os x , never mind . 
  anyway i tried it just now on my arch and i crashed my computer . 
  hooray, 
  while this comment is ironic it does describe the general trend of reddit posts about obese people, 
  i ca n't tell if you 're joking . 
  if you are n't , you really think you 're different from everybody else ? 
  sorry but i only have time/energy to post just the one comment . 
  you can save the popcorn for a movie, 
  edit : [ well turns out this wo n't be an argument ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1s4qyu/sometimes_i_wonder_if_i_am_retarded/cdu0nhc?context=3 ), 
  ... wait , * did * 1984 mention how they dealt with people with mental disorders ? 
  i suddenly ca n't remember, 
  same here , i once convinced my family to give a showing of it on christmas once . 
  it 's not an incredibly good movie but it has a very entertaining premise and for some reason i can never get tired of it . 
  this video looks better vertical . 
  or at least , more informative . 
  you see the whole monkey and hand and nothing else . 
  anything else would have been superfluous . 
  `` a few extra dollars '' ? 
  what kind of airline allows you to have wifi for that cheap ? 
  but if you 're flying with southwest , your flight only lasts a few hours . 
  not only is it a pretty high cost per hour , who needs internet on a 3 or 4 hour flight ? 
  there * is * right and wrong . 
  the more fun you are having , the more you are doing it right . 
  i mean , boiling water kills germs ( except the extremest of the extremophiles , but even they will succumb after a few minutes ) , but i still would n't boil something dead you found in a woods in a pot that looks like it 's for eating . 
  but i guess it 's not like you can buy a pot that is n't for eating , not easily anyway . 
  i guess you should look for the cheapest pot that 's still big enough to boil it in . 
  it sounded like a joke . 
  wait , i just figured out why my airplane wifi is so much more expensive than this : my wifi is in the arctic circle/over the atlantic or pacific ocean . 
  that sounds more difficult to do than wifi flying over a well-populated continent . 
  although , really , i 'm already surprised that they can get wifi at that altitude . 
  ( a good example of the prices i 'm complaining about is that lufthansa charges $ 11 for an hour of wifi . 
  if you want 24 hours of wifi , you can pay them $ 20 . 
  i 'm not sure what happens if you pay for one hour and then decide that you want more . ), 
  [ his egmont overture is even better imo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysi0ytc7bic ), 
  so if you decide to take a plane back the same day then you get wifi on that as well ? 
  maybe your getting trolled ? 
  i do n't think anybody could actually be this misinformed about something so fundamental, 
  is it even possible to connect to the ground stations at that height ? 
  no problem !, 
  in the meantime i found a [ better performance ] ( http://youtu.be/xocp3qtyima?t=30s ), 
  that 's most of the pictures of them though . 
  it comes with the series . 
  wow , that is really impressive, 
  my salary is less than the maximum unemployment benefit per year in the us !, 
  i 've got to be cheap , haha, 
  he 's spqr-ball at the top left . 
  if they knew what they were doing , they would n't have opened the box , and would n't have died . 
  what kind of pun is that ? 
  it barely sounds anything like `` christmas tree '' !, 
  ^ ( i actually thought this for a good two minutes after reading your comment ), 
  this was my comic . 
  sorry , it 's kind of the weakest advent calendar comic so far ; i blame forgetting the deadline . 
  i 'm still proud of all the innovative things ( for me anyway ) i 've put in there , though . 
  the character lineup is assembled from a combination of [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_nicholas_day ) and personal experience . 
  here 's what everybody 's doing :, 
  ** australia ** is amused by germany and co. 
  ** austria ** is dressed up as a krampus , and is scaring uk . 
  ** belgium ** is not having a good time and wants to go home . 
  ** chile , ** having applied a little makeup at home , is trying to act very inconspicuous , and is hoping nobody finds the body . 
  ** croatia ** thought this was all behind them by now .

  the spqr painting at the top left is st nicholas . 
  he lived in turkey when it was still part of the roman empire . 
  do you guys have st nicholas day too ? 
  i 'm so sorry for forgetting you !, 
  [ add yourselves to the wikipedia article  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_nicholas_day ) i was using that as a metric to make sure i got everyone . 
  uk accidentally dropped sealand into a crack in the floor . 
  no , it 's a wrapped candy in front of it . 
  germany is shaking the chocolate out of belgium !, 
  [ compare/contrast with this .

   ** chile , ** having applied a little makeup at home , is trying to act very inconspicuous , and is hoping nobody finds the body . 
  it 's retrograde in the sense that it goes around the sun in the opposite direction as other planets , is n't it ?
