  i will definitely at least try them out . 
  yeah !, 
  i get a pizza from them every week . 
  and i take people to chez pannise for dinner . 
  and i regularly make sushi using fish from the tokyo fish market ... this place this awesome . 
  nevertheless , they are . 
  the germans taught the hungarians how to agglutinate their words together . 
  [ i dunno , this does n't look especially agglutinating to me ( although i ca n't read it very well ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:hu-funeral_sermon_and_prayer_oszk.jpg ), 
  have n't had it yet , actually . 
  it sounds like i should though !, 
  oh , now * there * i 've been . 
  it was glorious !, 
  ho-lee shit ... 
  i think you mean alpha ' not * alpha , unless you 're suggesting that the striation factor of the gamma sheet is sinusoidally related to the radius of the lucas tensor . 
  you can always order off of fisher if you 're funded by a grant ... 
  [ i 've already asked a similar question . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vxjunkies/comments/1j3bbt/why_doesnt_experimental_evidence_of_yalgeths/ ) short answer , fiber bundle dimensions do n't contribute to threonic wavelength attenuation , so it does n't matter . 
  oh , i was wondering what the v was !, 
  totally forgot it was an element . 
  it blew up so hard it made it night !, 
  yeah , but physics has more cranks than any other field . 
  the idea of finding some hitherto unknown property of the universe itself appeals romantically much more to people than , say , coming up with a theory for the origin of uralic grammar . 
  it sure was part of the eastern bloc , though . 
  but i think most cranks come from the group of people who think achievements in the field have intrinsic worth , rather than are a means to an end . 
  maybe he 's trolling, 
  wait what does that have to do with my comment ? 
  you could possibly find some of the same food , though . 
  unlikely but possible . 
  these are all real diving signs , except for maybe `` behind '' and `` you '' , which would still be intelligible to a diver . 
  or remember that one polish guy ? 
  maybe i guess, 
  my thoughts in order :, 
  no shit . 
  wait , how are they counting that ? 
  alternatively , `` hh '' : `` hhc _ _ chh '' . 
  no , he did n't . 
  on the other hand , he did automatically assume she 's a woman . 
  i ca n't ever not interpret this as a portmanteau of `` john '' and `` marathon '' , and pronounce it that way . 
  it sounds like a supervillain name . 
  why would you pronounce it that way ? 
  that sounds stupid . 
  i was kidding , i 'm a non-native speaker and i 'd pronounce it that way too . 
  when i was little , my parents told me santa was latvian . 
  ( or maybe it was estonian . ), 
  looking at those flags very closely : the curse of hungary \u2248 the netherlands strikes again . 
  i am not regretting my flair . 
  that 's what it was !, 
  yes , that 's exactly what i mean . 
  thank you !, 
  why did you piss him off ? 
  you must be an asshole . 
  i love this map !, 
  i saw it posted on / r/linguistics a few months ago and i loved it . 
  thanks for making me find it again !, 
  / r/korean, 
  ew , automatic image vectorizers are practically eye terrorism . 
  if i had a newtsuit ... maybe !, 
  as someone who used to spend all their weekends in nyc : it was bad sometimes , but never this bad . 
  we have it pretty good with our temperate climate and relatively clean subways in the us . 
  i do n't understand why it likes it so much . 
  it 's a bird ; it can fly !, 
  that has to be more fun than tobogganing , right ? 
  i guess it 's the challenge of having to balance it likes . 
  but then it keeps cheating using its wings . 
  you 're complaining that * reddit * likes norway more than sweden ? 
  reddit talks disproportionately much about sweden . 
  while this does n't do the disparity justice , searching `` site : reddit.com sweden '' on google yields 132,000 results , whereas searching `` site : reddit.com norway '' on google yields 81,000 results . 
  sweden is over 1.5 times as popular as norway here !, 
  we can be sure that he was n't using any existing sign language . 
  if somebody is talking , you can usually tell whether it 's a language or just gibberish . 
  if somebody is signing , where there 's only a relatively much smaller pool of languages to consider , all the more so . 
  what about brain damage ? 
  that still exists in the mor-verse . 
  good job not editorializing there . 
  `` rich kid . '', 
  that said , this is horrible news . 
   is ukraine russia ? 
  not really . 
  racism would be agreeing with its depiction of the japanese as true . 
  although , i do n't think it 's incredibly good propaganda . 
  i 'm not sure how many people would actually buy this . 
  ( it 's very well-drawn though . ), 
  certainly they would understand the sentiment , though . 
  it must be pretty frustrating to have to post everything in the form of a meme . 
  this would have been a much better post without framing it as a meme . 
  i thought it was a subreddit for polish startups in the entertainment industry . 
  are you 8 ? 
  i totally forgot that `` glum '' was a word . 
  same here , but at least my future is vastly better than what i initially thought . 
  in high school i thought i would n't be able to get into an ivy league college , and that i 'd get a bachelor 's degree from a community college and then kill myself after i wo n't be able to get into any graduate programs or real jobs . 
  instead i 'm in the first year of a biomedical engineering phd program at a top university . 
  i 'm still kind of surprised , to be honest . 
  `` bullied '' is a little soft of a term for what the uk did to ireland . 
  it was practically genocide . 
  finland lost the winter war . 
  peasants , i studied both ag and latin in high school and undergrad !, 
  weep before my power . 
  ( seriously though , great job with that guide . 
  it is very comprehensive as far as i can see . ), 
  as a ta , i can totally relate .
