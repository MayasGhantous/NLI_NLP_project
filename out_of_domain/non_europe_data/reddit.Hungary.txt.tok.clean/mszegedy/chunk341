  as i understand it , the `` ice tray '' is attached . 
  the [ cahill-keyes ] ( http://www.genekeyes.com/megamap-beta-2/beta-2-400x210-pdf-to.jpg ) map is better anyway . 
  it looks like california . 
  wow , computer games , that 's a real plus, 
  most of norway is not populated . 
  it 's non-boring ice . 
  and all of their money is from oil , which comes from underneath the ocean . 
  why oh why did it need a vignette ? 
   128-qubit, 
  it has 128 bits of ram . 
  but they 're * quantum * bits that can get entangled with each other in a [ 0,1 ] * { 0,1 } ^ 128 space . 
  that is , the state of the ram is that every possible 128-bit string is assigned a continuous value between 0 and 1 . 
  the squares of these values all have to add up to 1 . 
   superconducting, 
  it has superconductors in it . 
  this is how the qubits interface with each other . 
   adiabatic, 
  it 's thermally sealed . 
  this is important because otherwise the qubits might lose their values . 
   optimization processor, 
  it calculates results for optimization algorithms . 
  unfortunately , every quantum processor needs be an application-specific circuit , since we ca n't make them versatile enough to read instructions off of a rom yet . 
  so this chip in particular is made for calculating some sort of optimization algorithm . 
  sorry if that was patronizing , i 'm not sure whether you were implying that you did n't know what the words meant . 
  maybe somebody will find this helpful at any rate . 
  my family still does n't believe me when i tell them paprika comes from america and not europe . 
  sure !, 
  but this has been engineered * very carefully * to be adiabatic enough . 
  if you prefer tau to pi , why did you say pi ? 
  he was from roman anatolia , so his race would maybe be turkish ? 
  nice touch about leaving stark on longer than any of the armors . 
  * oh , * now i get it . 
  i thought he was referring to the irrationality of pi , but now i understand that he 's referring to the irrationality of * picking * pi . 
  ( okay , i just wanted to get that wordplay in there . 
  he 's referring to how pi is only half a circle . 
  unfortunately you 're not slowly drifting off into that . 
  you 're still orbiting around earth . 
  you 'd need to escape earth 's gravity well for that . 
  then you 'd be orbiting the sun . 
  then you 'd need to escape that gravity well too . 
  and then you 'd be orbiting sagittarius a * at the center of the milky way . 
  you 'd need to escape * that * gravity well ... and then you 'd be free . 
  i think all this business with gravity and wells thereof makes space more comfy . 
  i 'd feel terrified if leaving the surface of earth meant that i might accidentally leave it forever . 
  like when i leave the house and get lost and ca n't find my way back home , as a kid . 
  that exact same kind of terror . 
  but if you 're orbiting , then you at least know that you 're securely in the vicinity . 
  the only one that it works on for me is the horsehead nebula . 
  why would you watch spongebob ? 
  it 's not 60 fps . 
  edit : i 'm sorry , i thought this was / r/pcmasterrace !, 
  not so , you need huge amounts of delta-v this way to get to those places . 
  although , having a source of light and heat is a plus , as is having a neighborhood . 
  and having matter get compressed into large chunks of rock/liquid/gas / plasma/neutronium/singularity / etc is also very gratifying . 
  but having to use rockets to move around in gravity wells ? 
  fuck that . 
  why are you still living in los santos ? 
  move out of that place as fast as possible . 
  that place is simply dangerous to your health . 
   adiabetic, 
  as a biomedical engineer , this made me laugh !, 
  well , of course it would completely shaft south america and africa and a significant part of asia . 
  ( lol japan came into existence around 1600 ) it 's from 1931 . 
  phagocytosis . 
  my god . 
  once i get a phd , i am telling your story to all my students . 
  ** jab it with an ice pick **, 
  you should include the delian league in that last panel for good measure . 
  although it did technically accomplish its true purpose . 
  oh and 40s japan . 
  oh , of course , i 've read all about it . 
  have you read scott aaronson 's blog ? 
  i prefer http://phdcomics.com , they make it not so depressing at least . 
  she could be just commenting on a general trend . 
  giving examples would be mean . 
  in my experience :, 
  - 80 % math, 
  - 20 % software, 
  - 0 % hardware, 
  not if you 're taking * theoretical * computer science i guess . 
  my father , professor of theoretical computer science at uc berkeley , ca n't code his way out of a paper bag . 
  meanwhile i , as a bioengineer , can manage cs major-level competency in coding with only having taken one course in cs as an undergrad . 
  and on the third hand , we have my uncle , who was taught the same as my father , but now works at google as a programmer . 
  so maybe coding proficiency is largely divorced from your degree ? 
  this is fucking awesome . 
  i once heard about a science fiction story where in the future poor people run around with handheld genetic sequencers sequencing everything , because it pays relatively well . 
  i 've always wondered how long it will take to get one of those . 
  i ca n't believe it 's here !, 
  for human blood , anyway . 
  well , if you 're talking about a specific person without mentioning their name , that 's kind of disingenuous , since they might be happier if you confronted them directly . 
  but if you 're talking about a thing a lot of people do , it would be unfair to single out particular people and direct peoples ' attention towards them , because they are no more at fault than the other people that do it . 
  i just noticed a typo in your flair : maxim ** a ** , not maximus . 
  because i prefer an opportunity to talk it out to lame passive-aggression ? 
  a pm would be ideal , but a post is the next best thing . 
  forget i said anything then !, 
  it 's cute the way it is . 
  boobs clouds ? 
  hey , i used to do this to my parents too !, 
  my mother anyway . 
  and , now that my sister has a car , her , too ... it must have been hereditary .
