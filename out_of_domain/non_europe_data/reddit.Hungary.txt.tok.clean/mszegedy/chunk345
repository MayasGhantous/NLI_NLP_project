  hey , maybe he could only copy the genome without editing it . 
  wait , what kind of compensation is actually given out in these situations ? 
  i do n't know whether i 'd like much more than a refund if i were one of those people ... then again , the more money , the better ... 
  yes , but by that logic we should prosecute the families of criminals . 
  i dunno , what class were you supposed to remember this from ? 
  i took us history in high school ( and never before , because i grew up in hungary and then moved to us ) , but that was five years ago . 
  nobody remembers details like that . 
  i do n't like either of these people . 
  they looked terrible via phone , but via computer the bottom left one looks totally fine . 
   mfw i 'm too poor to afford a wii u and sm3dw, 
  i hope your kid had a very happy christmas and enjoyed his gift !, 
  i remember being you on the left , that was very , very fun . 
  i bought my nephew ... nearly that same chemistry set !, 
  ( i got him the microchem one , whereas you got the deluxe glassware one ) i hope you have a lot of fun with that !, 
  what are you planning to do with it ? 
  2 cents : i like being self-sufficient . 
  feeling like i 'm truly the master of my vehicle . 
  * oh * i just understood this post . 
  i thought you were the prude cautioning her that you wo n't put up with her wanting to try certain things out . 
  but no , you were * complaining !, 
  what 's the music ? 
  viewing this on christmas , it 's pretty great, 
  * hungary * is beating the us ? 
  damn , and i have so many conversations with all the nice creationists there . 
  most people in hungary are super catholic , so it made sense to me that there 'd be a lot of creationists as well . 
  meanwhile i 've only met one creationist in the us so far . 
  just shows how much more powerful polls can be versus anecdotes , i guess . 
   planes, 
  so toady * will * finally implement [ my idea ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/q2b8f/4dimensional_dwarf_fortress/ ) ? 
  just this once : nobody dies !, 
  the original plan was to just attach two of those parachute things to it , and maybe blow off the bottom part if that was n't good enough . 
  fortunately , it did n't come to that . 
  then i 'll grind it up , put spices in it , smear it on bread , and eat it raw . 
  or i could also make steak out of it . 
  it is the meat that my favorite meat foods are made from !, 
  while this is not depthhub material , i still liked it a lot . 
  anyone know why it was deleted ? 
  op is an optimist, 
  i tried , but that did n't work . 
  how ? 
  going up to it on eva does n't help . 
   just enough to peek over the top of the base, 
  one of the few instances in which both `` peek '' or `` peak '' would be appropriate . 
  ... i like it ... :(, 
  thanks !, 
  oh man that is actually really cool . 
  while i 'm sure it causes a ton of different health issues for her , i still kind of really want my heart there . 
  also , i hate having sound in my browsing experience . 
  and videos are larger and eat up my internet . 
  and they take several clicks to deal with . 
  and they ca n't be resized . 
  that does n't really count . 
  you ca n't move backwards and forwards in it , only forwards , and at a constant rate . 
  no fun at all . 
  hello , blindness !, 
  i have n't played in a while . 
  can dwarves go blind ( from stabbing , not drinking , of course ) , and does it affect their behavior ? 
  the amount of days she wore it is exactly the same as the amount of days the mission that i sent to eeloo and back in kerbal space program took , as a round trip . 
  holy hell that 's a lot of time . 
  distorted it with the liquefy tool ? 
  it 's easier if you just render clouds and apply that as a distortion map . 
  at least , that 's what i do in gimp , it might be a little different in photoshop . 
  [ it 's got competition . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/1tqu0s/frog_using_leaf_as_an_umbrella/cean0z2 ), 
  you put a - on one side of a number , and a + on another side . 
  while i see what you mean , that 's hilarious . 
  except it [ uses an ampersand ] ( http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/upup_logo.gif ) , which does n't look like anything when it 's upside-down . 
  what is the difference between those two memes anyway ? 
  what the hell kind of computer do you have ? 
  they do n't scuttle around like that , though . 
  ^ ( and they attack bacteria not humans ), 
  they only made cocoa into hot chocolate ( with hot pepper instead of sugar ) . 
  the english later figured out that it , in fact , tastes better with sugar . 
  we could n't make solid chocolate soft enough to eat until some italian scientists or whoever figured out you have to separate the cocoa butter and then mix it back in . 
  before that solid chocolate was invariably completely rock hard . 
  ~ ~ i think we were able to make edible white chocolate , which is made of cocoa butter and is therefore softer , a while before that though . ~ ~ edit : nope , white chocolate did n't appear until the early 1900s . 
  jesus , it took you guys six comments to get to the bottom of that . 
  wow , very cool !, 
  i hope you have fun with it . 
  by the way , were n't all the 7970s snatched up by litecoin miners ? 
  these are beautiful but they still leave out a lot of awesome complexity that i wish could somehow be visualized in such a sculpture . 
  for example , compare that model of hiv to [ this ] ( http://visualscience.ru/en/projects/hiv/illustrations/ ) . 
  is n't the detailed structure gorgeous ? 
  and it would be really cool if that model of e. coli could be filled with little glass models of proteins and ribosomes and little glass ribbons that represent mrna , and so on , \u00e0 la [ david goodsell ] ( http://mgl.scripps.edu/people/goodsell/books/mol2-preview.html ) . 
  and then fill it with water . 
  of course , i 'm not complaining ; i 'm sure they already took tons of work , and they do already look great . 
  sorry , you would n't believe what kind of misconceptions about biology you run into after a while . 
  and also the irish potato famine, 
  it 's not faux though . 
  it basically works exactly the same . 
  even using lowercase omega for w is approximately the same sound . 
  i think the six countries should trade weather with each other and see who dies first . 
  probably whoever gets russia 's weather ( who should be brazil or the uk , because they 're both hilarious ) . 
  well , it 's all just the same genetic algorithm . 
  set up an information system that describes machines to build , make one of those machines one that copies the information system , and then run it for a trillion trillion iterations , and it can produce anything whatsoever . 
  in this case it was simply that rna doubles well as an information system and also as a thing to make machines out of . 
  copy the information system over and over again , making minor random changes as you go along . 
  eventually you get machines that make more sophisticated machines ( e.g. 
  ribosomes , humans ) , and also the information system itself might migrate to a better substrate ( in this case from rna to dna ; now , with gene therapy , from dna to magnetic disks and back again to dna ) . 
  if you set up a really general genetic algorithm , like life back in the day , then everything is possible .
