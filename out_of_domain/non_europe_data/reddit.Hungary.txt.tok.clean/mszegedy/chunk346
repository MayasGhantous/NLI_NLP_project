  ( although it 's still pretty mindblowing that life has actually gone to the moon . ), 
  ( by the way if you like looking at molecular structures i recommend the work of [ david goodsell ] ( http://mgl.scripps.edu/people/goodsell ) ; he does the molecule of the month entries at [ pdb ] ( http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do ) . 
  also check out this cool [ model of hiv ] ( http://visualscience.ru/en/projects/hiv/illustrations/ ) that i linked elsewhere in this thread . 
  and if you want to learn more about how most molecular machines work i recommend [ * protein structure and function * ] ( http://www2.uah.es/farmamol/new_science_press/protein.html ) for proteins or [ * the molecular genetics of bacteria * ( pdf warning ) ] ( http://universitealger.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dale-molecular-genetics.pdf\u200e ) for more general , systems-level stuff . 
  my favorite is [ * how proteins work * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/how-proteins-work-mike-williamson/dp/0815344465 ) but it costs about a million dollars . 
  or for light reading with lots of colorful pictures i recommend david goodsell 's [ * the machinery of life * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-machinery-life-david-goodsell/dp/0387849246/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1 ) . ), 
  i use mandelbulber . 
  it 's in every linux repository , even . 
  edit : wtf it ca n't do 2d ? 
  i 'm a bioengineer , and i 'm suddenly wondering whether i could possibly engineer some plants or bacteria to produce meth . 
  i wonder how the papers that describe the enzymes i would need to design for that would go over . 
  `` you want a grant for what ? '', 
  edit : i 've decided , my next grant proposal is going to involve an * arabidopsis methamphetamina * . 
  there is no turning back now . 
  aww , thanks !, 
  i just like your comics a lot . 
  for the sake of the joke , i 'd like to synthesize it from carbon dioxide , water , and nitrogen gas . 
  but realistically it would be easiest to synthesize from amphetamine probably . 
  it makes sense if you know the cyrillic . 
  `` e '' is `` ye '' , and if you put a diaeresis on it , it becomes `` yo '' . 
  `` p '' is straightforward , it just means `` r '' like in greek ( although it 's not exactly the same letter ) . 
  '' \u0448 '' means `` sh '' ; it has the same origin as greek '' \u03a3 '' and hebrew '' \u05e9 '' , from the phoenician letter `` w '' . 
  no idea where `` ruffe '' comes from . 
  linksys also . 
  apparently , not every network named linksys is unsecured . 
   maybe look into mao-b , and see if it can be modified to cause reduction rather than oxidation . 
  modifying substrate recognition is usually easier than modifying catalytic function . 
  one could probably look into reductases that take molecules that are of similar size as ephedrine . 
  i wonder if an rnr would be a good starting point ? 
  i seem to recall actually having seen one of those a year or two back . 
  long-term memory of details like that is unreliable , though , so i 'm probably imagining it . 
  they 're similar but they 're still sterically very large compared to phenethylamines . 
  ribonucleotides are not much better but two and a half rings is better than 4 + . 
  maybe you were on the right track with mao-b ; one would have to look at the active site to see for sure . 
  i was only joking , i have other stuff to work on ( that is hopefully more important ) . 
  ten years ago i was walking around the streets of tokyo in socks with a laptop , and i could n't find a damn unsecured wi-fi signal . 
  looks like they were ahead of the curve . 
  i do n't remember , but i sure do remember that they got * black * after that . 
  so i guess they were n't black to start with . 
  biomedical engineer here : yes it does . 
  i thought that was the joke !, 
  was good joke . 
  the idea of that was land , though , not anti-semitism . 
  if it had been inhabited by the chinese or the dutch they would have removed it also . 
  a rationalization after the fact for kazakhstan is that their flag is asymmetrical , with the stripe on the left . 
  it 's more suited to a rectangle than a circle . 
  singapore i thought was because of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indonesia%e2%80%93malaysia%e2%80%93singapore_growth_triangle ) . 
  additionally / u/javacode does n't get along with people sometimes . 
  i think he gets far too much flak for it but what 's one to do ? 
  fantastic way to depict scenes of war . 
  this makes me hopeful that a whole lot of other action scenes can be put into comic form , e.g. 
  the battle of salamis . 
   your pussy bitch ass is crying because of the mosquito bite ? 
  cry no more . 
  press a hot spoon onto the spot . 
  the heat will destroy the protein that caused the reaction and the itching will stop . 
  the reaction is caused by histamine , and that 's not a protein and is n't affected by heat . 
  i pronounce it `` leaver '' but i still liked it . 
  i was talking about freshman english actually, 
  / o / before a vowel sounds like / w / . 
  e.g. , i pronounce `` one '' / oan / , and it sounds pretty much like how everybody else says it . 
  there 's a reason some approximants ( including / w / ) are called semivowels . 
  pronounced `` sala - * miss * '' , not `` sala - * meez * '' . 
  writing course material for a course i 'm preparing to teach . 
  :\\ i 'm hoping to to talk to my advisor about doing work on enzymes that can construct buckyballs , or carbon nanotubes , or graphene , atom by atom , depending on which is the most feasible ( probably buckyballs would get me funding ) . 
  i want to expand the idea from just building structures to building functional nanomachines , somewhere down the long road . 
  in the meantime the slogan is `` building a container for drug delivery '' . 
  protein design is difficult but possible . 
  there 's actually a whole lot to know about enzyme design that we know , and a whole lot of tools to help ( e.g. 
  the design software [ rosetta ] ( http://www.rosettacommons.org ) ) . 
  we do understand proteins on many levels now . 
  there is still a lot to learn , but it 's a feasible approach to a problem , now . 
  the latter . 
  english is my second language ; my original language , hungarian , does n't have / w / , so i learned to say / o / before vowels where there is normally / w / . 
  and yes , it does make it similar to / w / . 
  it sounds similar . 
  it might be further back in the throat -- a velar approximant , maybe , rather than a bilabial one -- but it sounds similar nevertheless . 
  i dunno , i was n't saying they were especially related linguistically , just the qualitative observation that / o / before a vowel sounds similar to / w / before a vowel . 
  whatever . 
  well , we 've upvoted cat shit to the front page . 
  you guys happy ? 
  and i knew this straight away not even because of my spanish education , but because of six years of latin . 
  who 's with me ? 
  just typing russian is a fucking pain in the ass . 
  russian has so many letters that you need to use shift to get commas . 
  i do n't know russian but i know slovak ( and cyrillic ) , and believe me the way knowing slovak has helped me the most is that it has helped me communicate with russian players online . 
  for breaking bad you can roll a die ( reroll if it lands on 6 ) . 
  in fact , for episodes of any particular season , you can basically roll a die and flip a coin . 
   work to live , not live to work, 
  what 's wrong with your job being your favorite thing to do ? 
  you can proportion it so that there is n't an uneven amount . 
  it 's a high-school calculus problem . 
  i 'm actually with you on that one . 
  leave the high-school calculus to the high-school students . 
  [ bogobogosort is `` better '' ] ( http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/bogobogosort.html ), 
  but the ice cream tub is not a cylinder , it is a cross-section of a cone . 
  do n't forget sed !, 
  no , actually , i understand why he says that . 
  `` they '' could be referring to either ie or uralic languages . 
  it 's nearly obvious that it means `` uralic '' , since most ie languages have gender , but if you have no knowledge of that , then it 's not trivial .
