  well , of course you 'd know about it . 
  it 's a gif . 
  ( seriously do you have a phd in gifs or something ? ), 
  it 's not about getting * old * , it 's about time passing quickly . 
  like ... does it really seem like decade to you since the ds first came out ? 
  some of these are actually quite similar !, 
  what really gets me though is the amount of meat in the wendy 's taco salad . 
  i 've insisted that my diet is n't so healthy just because it consists primarily of salads for a long time now , and i 've had people back me up on this . 
  but this is a whole new order of magnitude less salad-like than what i 've been having . 
  ice and groundwater, 
  good job , that cloud looks exactly like it should . 
  laptop masterrace . 
  on average my laptop uses 15 w , although its psu is rated far higher . 
  nations , then, 
  does the dream lord count as an evil clone ? 
  that 's what i 'd consider a well-done such story . 
  it 's like a poem . 
  jesus , they got * cyprus * , but not new zealand or the british isles . 
  he means `` made-up '' . 
  p is slang for `` pretty '' ( the adverb ) sometimes so you 're good anyway, 
  why ? 
  it has a gazillion fans , what 's the point of upvoting every time one of them makes a reference to it ? 
  maybe if it were very obscure and you wanted it to get known better , but we 're talking england 's patron show here . 
  itt : `` this is a doctor who reference ! '', 
  are you kidding me ? 
  try eating three 25 cents ramens a day with no seasoning out of the plastic bowl they came in , * with a plastic fork you stole from a nearby fast food place . 
  yeah , right . 
  as far as i can see nearly everybody on this site totally hates each other . 
  all of the letters in the title are actual greek letters that are used right ... except the n , which is not a greek letter at all ( and looks like \u03b7 , which is pronounced `` ay '' ) . 
  they even got the final sigma right ; sigma is usually \u03c3 , except at the end of a word when it is \u03c2 . 
  why could n't they have just written '' \u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' ? 
  does it really become so unintelligible then ? 
  like , god dammit dudes . 
  the one letter is the difference between faux greek and real greek . 
  if you want to pluralize it like english does , you say `` penises '' . 
  if you want to pluralize it like latin does , you say `` penes '' . 
  but please do n't say `` penii '' , it hurts !, 
  ( although it 's not fundamentally * wrong * ), 
  we get these sometimes in new jersey . 
  they 're even cooler to see in person !, 
  i tried to be very careful not to knock them down .

  what the * fuck ? 
  what do you recommend instead ? 
  i got a lenovo laptop , t430s-custom , a year ago and so far i 've had no problems ( except the ones that traditionally come with using arch ) . 
  i wanted a robust , configurable , and durable laptop , with good hardware , and this was good for the job . 
  i 'd gladly take an identical laptop with the old lenovo keyboard on it because this one is shit compared to it . 
  but what other laptops are there in the same price range that are built like tanks ? 
   malware in the hardware 's firmware, 
  that is a really funny line, 
  bash is installed as a binary file . 
  it does n't need anything except for that one file to exist . 
  the file is located in the folder / bin , and is called bash ; hence , / bin/bash . 
  `` bin '' stands for binary ; you might ask `` what runs bash ? 
  '' , and the answer is the computer 's processor itself ; that is what `` binary '' means . 
  you run bash , the file , with the name and path of the source file as its argument . 
  bash takes a look at the source file and does whatever the source file tells it to . 
  i actually want to go to a pizza place where i can have this experience . 
  it sounds fantastic . 
  yeah its p crazy, 
  it 's pretty good . 
  it gives you a chance to use creative thinking to solve interesting problems . 
  you can do lots of crazy stuff in it , and you can go ahead and populate the whole solar system with kerbals . 
  it might lose its charm after all your missions start feeling the same , but that wo n't be until at least 50 hours of playing the game . 
  also i like the idea . 
  it 's creative and also expressive . 
  how close would a human have to get to be able to see it this way ? 
  i 'm assuming just getting out of our atmosphere would n't do the trick , since we do n't have any pictures of it looking like that that i know of . 
  you ca n't ignite it . 
  there 's no oxygen for the reaction . 
  and no , it would n't have been a star ; stars work by fusion , by the sheer mass of the hydrogen crushing itself into helium . 
  ( this is a little simplified an explanation , but that 's the mechanism . ), 
  jupiter could n't become a star just by being set on fire ; it would actually need enough mass to have the appropriate nuclear reactions occur . 
  this mass is about 75 to 80 times what it currently has . 
  if you could get 80 jupiters together , then you could make your own star !, 
  oh wow now i get the joke . 
  * fasces * = bundle of sticks = faggots but also fascists . 
  than you many hues, 
  ^ ( ( but it 's fasces , not fascio ) ^ ), 
  but that does n't necessarily mean a human looking at it would see the same thing . 
  it could be a more sensitive `` retina '' and/or a longer exposure . 
  what i mean is , you do n't hear people aboard the iss talking about how cool it is to be able to see andromeda properly from there . 
  how did hungary end up with the biggest dicks in europe ? 
  we 're originally asian ( although not eastern asian ) . 
  i do n't understand the `` four moons '' part . 
  does it mean polan was seeing double ? 
  the funny part of your comment is the part where you said `` sick '' and then `` deviant '' , instead of the other way around . 
  and the roc , what ? 
  :p ( and zambia and mauritania and madagascar and a whole lot of smaller countries ... 
  i guess it 's not exhaustive ), 
  the balls probably are n't magnetic enough to be able to be reset with household magnets . 
  it 's simpler to just buy a new one , or try the pen trick . 
  you can do that , or something like it . 
  brain-computer interfaces have come a long way !, 
  the easiest way is something called an eeg . 
  it just reads off brainwaves , some of which you can control .
