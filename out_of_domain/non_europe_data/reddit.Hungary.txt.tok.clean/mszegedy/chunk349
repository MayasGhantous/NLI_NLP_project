  you said that arsenic was the king of slow and undetectable poisons . 
  however , large amounts of arsenic give the material a metallic taste ; according to * the poisoner 's handbook * , when the pie was poisoned in a bakery in new york in 1922 , most people eating it stopped early because of the funny taste , given that inordinately large amounts of arsenic were used , and as a result 60 people were hospitalized and `` only '' five killed . 
  would the average would-be roman poisoner know the difference between a fatal dose and an obvious dose ? 
  heheheh , i think the model goes something like this : people pirate it when they are young and they get used to it , and then , if they become graphic designers or something , then they buy it . 
  can * volvox * cells survive independently ? 
  thank you , that was very helpful !, 
  although i do wonder what web journalism has come to , with the relevant text only taking up 35 % of the width of my screen . 
  i knew about cheezwhiz but i do n't know what exactly it is and it seems like it 's sort of a specialty item and i do n't know how high-quality it is . 
  i associate cheezwhiz with cheap cheesesteak restaurants . 
  thanks !, 
  that would have been embarrassing to mess up . 
  sorry , this is the second sauce i have ever made . 
  i heard eve is a capitalism simulator . 
  that doesn ' f sound very fun , because it 's very hard to find good strategies for capitalism , amidst all the junk . 
  so , it 's kind of like having a second life , with its own politics and economics ? 
  has it ever been hacked ? 
  like , if i could hack into real life and give myself infinite cash , or the like , i totally would . 
  or if i had enemies , i 'd disappear them and all their stuff . 
  i ca n't imagine nobody 's tried that before . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  what a great idea . 
  that 's just your biologist sense kicking in . 
  this is an excellent illustration of why marine biology is the most entertaining field of biology there is . 
  edit : also , what 's funny is that the insides of * chilenses * look like [ vanadinite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vanadinite ) . 
  [ ( best example ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/vanadinite%2c_goethite%282%29.jpg ), 
  because you 'd have to convert appliances all over the country . 
  0 \u00b0 f is fucking cold , 100 \u00b0 f is pretty hot , is what he meant with those numbers . 
  i still like my idea of switching weathers and seeing who can survive . 
  we captured iraqi tanks ? 
  that is what the article said . 
  did you read the whole thing ? 
  the mun is made of rocks though . 
  although , names are n't reliable ; the `` double bass '' is a viol , yet it does n't have `` viol '' in its name like most of the other viols . 
  better use [ hornbostel-sachs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hornbostel%e2%80%93sachs ) . 
  ( verdict : they 're all [ necked box lutes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_musical_instruments_by_hornbostel-sachs_number:_321.322 ) . ), 
  damn it , you beat me !, 
  damn . 
  as a bioengineer , if i played with most of my dyes , i would get cancer and die . 
  that is * never * going to hit anything . 
  i love how the pixels just melt off the screen at one point . 
  why is germany use reichos4 ? 
  latest stable version has reichos6 for some time now . 
  i just meant that i 'm sad that i ca n't pour my dyes around with wild abandon . 
  what does a `` this nigga '' face look like ? 
  i do n't . 
  :\\ i do the grammar and the pronouns and that 's it . 
  i just ca n't derive any fun from it . 
  you should have made the fez itself into a dunce cap !, 
  i think i once knew a guy who phded in antenna theory , or something like that . 
   cars that run on water, 
  possible with cold fusion , heheheh . 
   shadow is able to compress a 7 gigabyte full hd movie into a mere kilobyte , without losing one bit of quality, 
  * my * compression algorithm uploads it to youtube , and saves the youtube url only . 
  it can compress several gigabytes to a mere few bytes . 
  tbf most torrented full-movie xvids are around that size . 
  there is no need to be upset ... 
  at first sight it looks like huge overspecialization though , like history of the appalachians . 
  should n't the purple glasses be green ? 
  normally , things with colors have those colors because they reflect them . 
  but in the case of tinted lenses , green glass only allows green light to pass through , red glass only allows red light to pass through , etc. 
  they look that color because the light that comes through is that color , not because they reflect that color . 
  edit : never mind , the goggles * were * green . 
  exactly . 
  but for some reason , they used purple goggles . 
  edit : i could have sworn !, 
  nice , but the 3d is entirely unnecessary and makes it harder to estimate areas . 
  edit : [ fixed . 
  well , that was pretty straightforward . 
  it does n't matter . 
  it did n't really happen . 
  i guess it depends on how close the black hole to us is being modeled as , versus how heavy it 's being modeled as . 
  and its speed . 
  fix one arbitrarily , find out the other two via estimation and calculation . 
  you could have done that just as easily in 2d . 
  edit : [ fixed . 
  i have no excuse, 
  hmm , i would have made john the dalmatian , dave something else , and also rose not a poodle . 
  jade is great though . 
  our pile of scottish jokes would like to disagree with you . 
  20 minutes to download for me , apparently . 
  where are you , canada ? 
  holy * shit . 
  * i mean , i 've ended up on se 's page a lot of times before , but i did n't realize it was so fantastic . 
  my download is already going . 
  sorry for the kind of half-assed fix , i was busy and gimp was acting up . 
  i have no idea about that line over diabetes ; it was there when i started . 
  link : http://gates.ly/1h5cyqc, 
  ah , but hiding jewish jokes as scottish jokes sure could be !, 
  of course , it could just be surly compliance with an outside authority . 
  the area of each box is directly proportional to the amount of years of life lost that the corresponding thing causes . 
  the yellow boxes are transmissible diseases , the magenta boxes are intransmissible diseases , and the green boxes are injuries . 
  some of the boxes do n't say what they are , which is infuriating . 
  the axes themselves do n't mean anything . 
  i was waiting for one of them to wave !, 
  in the us , too . 
  persian * rugs * really . 
  nice , but there 's no way you can expect me to absorb all that information in , quote-unquote , `` less than a minute '' . 
  edit : it 's great if you try and follow trails . 
  what 's the difference between death metal and black metal ? 
  i think it 's due to increased population density .
