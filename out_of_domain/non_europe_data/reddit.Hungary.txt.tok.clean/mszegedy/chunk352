  that 's dumb . 
  exchange it with `` in angle '' or just `` angle '' . 
  i understood it better than the other one , because which way you 're pointing is a 2-vector with spherical coordinates , whereas your velocity is a 3-vector with cartesian coordinates , so it 's unclear what `` difference '' means . 
  the one that does n't use physics terms manages to at least not make it sound like you 're comparing a 3-vector with a 2-vector . 
  ( also , i 'm a biologist , so maybe i 'm just not smart enough to understand the physics explanation ? ), 
  wow , i am sad that this does not have many upvotes . 
  it seems the best creations/missions sometimes get little to no appreciation here . 
  kudos to building this !, 
  do you think you could get it to jool ? 
  fb posts are rarely , if ever , good content . 
  i say ban them . 
  that is czechoslovakia . 
  it 's either andrew or gary, 
  voting does n't automatically produce good content , though . 
  just look at / r/all . 
  [ we can do it in real life too !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/n_6p-1j551y ) of course , a several-ton rocket is different from a 15 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 15 cube , but then again it * is * on the mun . 
  you 're misreading . 
  it 's about reddi ** l ** . 
   ( both of them because if you think about it : is < shift  + ; ), 
  heheheh i understood what you meant perfectly until i realized that very few people use dvorak keyboards . 
  are most vim users also dvorak typists ? 
  i was kidding . 
  the t is n't crossed though , making it look like an l. sorry , that 's what i was trying to point out . 
  at least include * the cove * . 
  why is a documentary about fractals randomly stuck between various documentaries about cosmology ? 
  `` i feel the need to inform you ... '' is a meme on this subreddit . 
  he was just pouring more gasoline everywhere , to encourage a fire to start , from the people who did not know about that . 
  fractals appear in places , but you 're not going to find any fractals in the standard model . 
  but that 's like putting a documentary on fluid mechanics in there because both cosmology and fluid mechanics use similar differential equations . 
  they 're * related * , vaguely , but they do n't belong in the same category . 
  now that i think about it , there was n't really a better place to put them anyway , was there ? 
  ^ ^ also ^ ^ thank ^ ^ you, 
  you should n't go to the trouble of setting up a whole virtual machine ; vim exists already on windows . 
  in particular , i recommend gvim . 
  you seem to already have it set up anyway !, 
  solution : leave out the sun ( like they already did ) . 
  you may think it is ugly , but i like the aesthetic . 
  it resembles the lego spaceplanes i built as a child . 
  places where i know it needs work :, 
  - needs more electricity generation, 
  - needs more fuel, 
  - needs more lift, 
  - needs a few more intakes, 
  my solution to this was to extend the fuel tanks up front to twice their size , and stick a pair of delta wings on that ( removing the winglets ) , and completely cover them with solar panels . 
  i also added many , many generators in a neat line . 
  unfortunately , this model does n't even get off the runway because it is so heavy . 
  maybe adding control surfaces to the front set of delta wings will help , but i doubt it . 
  maybe replace the deltas with swept wings ? 
  do i have to have a nuclear ? 
  ions are a whole lot lighter and more efficient . 
  it 's currently got 4 ions on it ; the newer design has 8 but is heavier . 
  is that accounting for 4x acceleration ? 
  hmm you have a point then . 
  really , it 's called `` lithobraking '' because you 're braking using stone , `` lithos '' in greek , by analogy with `` aerobraking '' , where you 're braking using air , `` aeras '' in greek . 
   there is absolutely no shortage of specialists in science and mathematics ; in fact , there is a hideous , life-ruining glut of phds in those fields, 
  everybody is thinking about this the wrong way . 
  it 's not that there 's too many people , there 's * not enough institutions . 
  wow , what a novel !, 
  thank you for all the advice , i feel like i know a lot more about wings now . 
  i will make sure to rebuild my plane based on this new knowledge . 
  heheheh taking away mass is always what i focus on after prototyping . 
  thank you for the advice on intakes though , i will keep that in mind . 
  hey , it 's only my first one !, 
  those are * all * always more complex than they need to be . 
  do americans know what macedonia is ? 
  maybe from ancient history . 
  we do it in real life too !, 
  abrasive shields are more feasible in a world where things do n't just * disappear * when they hit something too hard . 
   almost no mass, 
  which , as publicized by danny2462 , allows them to gracefully skip water like a pod of dolphins . 
  and to be extremely useful as a flotation device . 
  the best part is if you have a stateball flair and you change the flair text , then no one , not even americans , can tell what state it is . 
  itt : til i am even less dyslexic than everybody else . 
  i 'll join the ranks with / u/javacode . 
  holy fucking shit . 
  and when i try to research my pet gene , it has 3 sentences and and an infobox . 
  and when i try to look up a reasonably important chemical , it has a quarter this much text . 
  i think this article may be the article with the lowest importance-to-length ratio on the whole wiki . 
  armenian genocide best day of my life, 
  but , still , holy shit . 
  the page on the mathematical formulation of the standard model -- i.e. , the most important and most comprehensive physics page on wikipedia -- [ is 57103 bytes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=standard_model_%28mathematical_formulation%29&amp;action=history ) .

  the page on the macedonia naming dispute , on the other hand , is [ 210923 bytes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=macedonia_naming_dispute&amp;action=history ) , and has [ * 397 references * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#references ) ( and , slightly hilariously , 0 further reading recommendations ) . 
  either , as far as i can see . 
  formally you 'd use ablative . 
  because pineapple tastes great . 
  i prefer it with other sweet stuff ( or , especially , as a liquid ) , but it goes decent on pizza . 
  maybe the extra upvotes all occurred in the fifteen minutes between you and him ? 
  unlikely , but possible . 
  what about tomatoes , cherry tomatoes especially ? 
  i associate it with slippery proteins . 
  i do n't see how i 'd be doing that . 
  i still do n't get it . 
  of course , the truth is that there is no reason to put a radio telescope in space ever . 
  radio waves get through the atmosphere just fine . 
  the craft could theoretically do lower ( probably a little below 10 ) , but it was piloted by me , instead of someone who knows anything about rocketry . 
  interestingly enough , this was the first design i came up with . 
  or the crater . 
  people with similar times unite !,
