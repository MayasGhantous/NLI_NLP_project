  eve has lakes and oceans like titan , whereas venus only has some lava flows . 
   true or false : `` your computer guy is a genius because he can build a computer from a bunch of parts ? '', 
  `` oh , man , they insulted our intelligence !, 
  now they 've done it ! '', 
  while i do n't like anything about that page , it really * does n't * take anyone remotely smart to build a computer . 
  it 's just a more complicated version of [ this ] ( http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/612557990_1/13-holes-intelligence-box-shape-matching-toy-building-blocks-baby-educational-toys-kids-early-learning-toys.jpg ) game . 
  you do n't even necessarily need to know what the components * do * to build it . 
  if you tell someone the processor is the gpu and vice versa , they can still build the computer just fine . 
  or that there 's two gpus and the motherboard does the processing . 
  i guess they need to know about the psu , but we 're not talking about chimps here , they can figure that out . 
  so , they 're right on that count , at least . 
  ( which is , ironically , a plus for us ! ), 
  for nearly half a minute , i wondered where the hell the ps/2 port itself was . 
  this is assuming you are starting with a circular projection centered on the north pole . 
  saying that the physical representation of a memory is not the memory itself is pedantic , though . 
  the title is fine . 
  how are you pronouncing that in your head ? 
  `` an uninterruptable power supply '' ? 
  for the purposes of a * title * , though ? 
  i think you could . 
  the orbital axes are already fairly aligned , since i launched into the orbital plane of the craft . 
  have you tried different ratios , or different distance functions altogether ? 
  i am going to try this out in mathematica . 
  let 's not even get into all the different kinds of fanfiction there are , either . 
  being subscribed to both / r/gamephysics and / r/anormaldayinrussia can get confusing . 
  good god , imo this is way more impressive than that other one . 
  i guess it becomes simple once you figure out how to reduce the size of the eve lander to ~ 15 tons or so , huh ? 
  but then you also did precision landings , which i 'm still only getting the hang of just now . 
  from the same height , deorbiting using the same method , your change in longitude will be roughly the same each time . 
  this is a good way to examine which functions are more fundamental to us . 
  standing : not so much . 
  clinging : very much !, 
  climbing stairs : not at all . 
  substitute a sulfur for the oxygen and you 're golden . 
  simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 was probably finland 's single biggest asset in the winter war . 
  o h m y g o d t h e k e r n i n g i s h o r r i b l e, 
  otherwise good job , these are very informative , and cover all the key points . 
  however , the temperature scale for some of the boiling temperatures look off . 
  e.g. , for the chalcogens , there is roughly the same amount of distance for a jump of 301 , then 101 , then 33 ( !!!, 
  ) , then 196 . 
  the flame is better oxygenated in fisher burners . 
  i am jeb mackerman , and i am standing on one planet while touching another . 
  i do n't get it, 
  i 've always wished there were atmosphere in space . 
  then we would n't need fuel !, 
  [ apparently not ] ( https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking ), 
  it would make a certain amount of sense . 
  does n't the us spend incredibly large amounts of money on the military already ? 
  what kind of rover has a rockomax-size tank attached to it ? 
  what is the phase space of ? 
  distribution of the positions and velocities of the particles ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  we spent like a whole semester on it in biochem alone . 
  without h10s , how could you have h2 ? 
  i am a molecular biologist . 
  what sets me apart from other kinds of biologists is i study life at the molecular level rather than the macroscopic level . 
  a molecular gastronomist , then , should be analogous : they assemble their food from component molecules , and tweak the molecules themselves . 
  they cook on the molecular level . 
  however , that 's not exactly what molecular gastronomists do , is it ? 
  it 's more like regular cooking , but with the addition of some techniques from chemistry , and a pure chemical here and there ( although it 's not like cooking does n't already deal in pure chemicals ; water and sugar are proof of that ) . 
  ( for the record , imo true molecular gastronomy would probably be rather inedible ... although jello and [ y\u014dkan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y%c5%8dkan ) are delicious ), 
  but that 's not what op was asking about . 
  he/she was asking what kind of pure chemicals , that one can buy by themselves , are good as cooking ingredients , pointing to `` industrial '' food as a starting point . 
  it 's not about `` these chemicals look bad -- should i really be eating them ? '', 
  it 's more like , `` which chemicals should i eat ( outside what my food is already made of ) ? '', 
  well , there 's sads and sids . 
  after quickly looking over it again , i can tell you what kerning * was n't * awful :, 
  - the list of elements on the left, 
  - the title, 
  - the sub-title, 
  - the box that says `` all of the elements have * x * valence electrons '', 
  - the labels on the charts, 
  - the uses under `` uses of the * x * '' ( but not the heading itself ), 
  - `` silicon is ... earth 's crust '' was n't so bad, 
  the rest of it was very bad . 
  you might want to make them not square , or just left-aligned . 
  a misnamed ship or station , probably, 
  jesus christ how much of this did you hand-pixel ? 
  no , the ones with lots of spondees are rarely ever spondaic . 
  ( not to imply that spondaic lines * do n't * have any less spondees than the average line . ), 
  they 're called spondaic because the second-to-last foot is a spondee . 
  the rest of the feet may be whatever . 
  [ you 're about right ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=442+billion+kg+%2f+density+of+neutronium ), 
  you 'd like [ kerbal space program ] ( / r/kerbalspaceprogram ) , then . 
  hyperedit is an actual mod , not a term for editing persistent.sfs, 
  mod-f12 pulls up the debug menu, 
  transferring fuel between tanks can be done natively , and does n't actually involve any mods . 
   something that enhances the current `` science '' system . 
  i love the new career mode . 
  i know they plan on developing it further . 
  however , what i feel is missing , is a sense of `` purpose '' for the kerbalnauts . 
  you get no in-game benefit other than a sense of accomplishment ( which is great do n't get me wrong ! ), 
  for , let 's say , creating a fuel depot , or assembling a space station around kerbol or minmus . 
  there is no in-game reason for launching a resupply mission to dock with a space station . 
  maybe the stations accumulate waste that needs to off-loaded , or require food . 
  kethane is a mod i have n't tried yet , that seems to be gripping with this same issue of resources - adding another gameplay element . 
  get used to this feeling , because you 'll feel it irl too . 
  you have to * establish * a purpose . 
  this is common to all sandboxes . 
  the smallest ship that can get to eve is an okto2 with a xenon tank and an ion drive and an external seat and some solar panels ( i recommend the ox-4 panels ) attached to it .
