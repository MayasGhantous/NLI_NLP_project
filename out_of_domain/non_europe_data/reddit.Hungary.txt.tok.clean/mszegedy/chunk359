  or , since they have the docking port at the front , they can push something to anywhere in the solar system . 
  they are refuelable.the station is perfectly symmetrical and has a docking port sr in the back , so that i can dock an interplanetary drive to it to push it places . 
  this one is probably staying here though . 
  besides the modules at the end there , it consists of only two parts : the core module , in the front , and the extension module in the back . 
  if you look very carefully , after the second pair of gigantors there is a pair of docking port srs where they 're docked together . 
  i can do it in ... four launches , if i 'm limited to four orange tanks at a time . 
  unless you have ion cross ? 
  hmm . 
  remember the wallet challenge ? 
  that , but with every body in the kerbol system . 
  eve and back , then moho and back , then laythe and back , then tylo and back , etc , all in one launch . 
  interpreting vague answer as `` yes '' . 
  damn , this is turning into a disaster . 
  hopefully at least the athletes are safe . 
  so many things wrong with those explanations , but awesome mod nevertheless . 
  good god , you must be a complete master of rendezvous . 
  how are you supposed to do it without a navball ? 
  i plan using maneuver nodes !, 
  i never ever get the bright green marker sadly . 
  thank you for the detailed explanation though !, 
  well , you asked for it !, 
  - the heat of gas planets is n't affected much by their distance from their sun , except for hot jupiters , which urania is n't . 
  they are uniformly cold on the outside and hot on the inside ; their exteriors block light and heat up negligibly , and on their interiors the gases inside of them are compressed greatly to make them hot . 
  how hot depends on their mass . 
  the inside of jupiter is much hotter than the inside of uranus . 
  jupiter is 317.8 earth masses , while uranus is 14.5 earth masses . 
  so , if urania is hotter than jool , it 's because it has more mass , although i like it more as an ice giant . 
  - as funny as the `` large meal '' comment is for deimos , the force of gravity is linearly proportional to the mass of the thing attracted ; that is , the acceleration due to gravity is constant with respect to the mass of the thing attracted . 
  heavier things are n't more affected by gravity . 
  i guess in a roundabout way having a big meal would help , though : while you would n't accelerate more , you 'd have to exert a greater force with your legs/jetpack to move yourself . 
  you 'd be more stable . 
  - how did vulcania have an ocean in the first place ? 
  you could say it used to have an ocean , but then a huge asteroid impact made its rotational speed much higher and then it lost it . 
  this also gives me a really cool idea for a planet : earth , but with no water . 
  - nitrogen gas is actually totally colorless . 
  you 're thinking of ** organo ** nitrogens , like on titan . 
  that 's where you got the idea from , right ? 
  - `` seem ** s ** to be an angry planet . '', 
  or even , '' ** it ** seem ** s ** to be an angry planet . '', 
  - `` thermis '' should be capitalized for minos . 
  - methane gas is vaguely [ cyan ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/uranus2.jpg ) , not orange . 
  i know where you got that from , though : liquid methane is orangey-brown , like you got right in the oceans , and also methane-water ice , methane clathrate , found on earth at the bottom of the ocean , is a beautiful bright orange , and is eaten by adorable little worms . 
  also , striking a match would n't do anything , unless hermes 's atmosphere also contains significant amounts of oxygen . 
  burning is combustion , and requires oxygen , not present in methane . 
  it would n't contain significant amounts of oxygen , though , since any oxygen in there would have gotten ignited by chance . 
  - releasing chlorophyll into the air offends my sensibilities as a biologist . 
  you had a perfectly good setup for `` air algae '' , floating unicellular or oligocellular plants , although if you were being realistic then they would be in the air because they were blown there , and then they would settle on the ground and be blown up again , and so on , but there would be so many that there would be a lot in the air at one time anyway . 
  this makes for big paths of green where the wind is blowing , and green weather is awesome . 
  but `` releasing chlorophyll into the air '' is just wrong !, 
  i accept that it could refer to a chlorophyll analogue instead of chlorophyll itself , but why in god 's name would they be releasing it ? 
  they need it !, 
  and chlorophyll is n't a gas anyway , it 's a bunch of really heavy molecules bundled up in protein , and contains magnesium . 
  releasing it would never evolve for any reason . 
  also , would n't a world where nearly everything is photosynthetic quickly use up all the carbon ? 
  i guess the algae could learn to cannibalize each other , which would be awesome , but i doubt so many of them would be present in that case . 
  or maybe they do n't do carbon fixation at all , but directly replenish some other energy source !, 
  or maybe a lot of their cellular processes produce a ubiquitous carbon-containing waste compound ( almost certainly carbon dioxide ) , which their photosynthesis is n't efficient enough to totally eliminate . 
  - hyperion ca n't be `` almost a dwarf star '' . 
  it would need to be as big as jupiter to be almost a dwarf star , and that 's just the volume requirement , not even anywhere near the mass requirement ; the lower limit on the mass of a star is somewhere between 75 and 80 jupiter masses . 
  there 's a name for `` almost a dwarf star '' , by the way , and it 's [ brown dwarf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_dwarf ) . 
  you can blame the extreme heat on the tidal forces , but then you 'd have to put it extremely close to urania , and then you would n't be able to have erato . 
  otherwise there is no way a body can stay that hot : it would radiate away the heat quickly . 
  if / u/jmile69 comes around , he might be able to tell you any stuff i missed or said incorrectly . 
  their center of mass is very close to your hand , which makes turning them easy , which in turn makes fighting awkward . 
  `` i feel that this should be regarded as a classic . '', 
  -- anyone who has ever read anything by feynman, 
  then again , mexico does make better coke . 
  yeah , but even then . 
  it might have to do with universe replacer ? 
  waffles are an uncountable noun, 
  that sounds amazing actually, 
  thought 1 : but there 's no oxygen on eve !, 
  thought 2 : i 'm an idiot . 
   progression in the techtree should start with airplane parts , manned airplanes came before steerable and manned rockets . 
  but rockets came before spaceplanes . 
  the thing about these parts that makes them come after rocket parts is that they can survive reentry . 
  they used cane sugar , and for a brief period off-brand mexican coke was more popular in california than american coke ( which used corn syrup ) . 
  then coca-cola bought the coke manufacturies in mexico , and now there is still cane sugar coke but it 's owned by coca-cola . 
  well , putting copious amounts of sugar into it is n't going to fix it . 
  but ... we do n't even * have * apple pie . 
  we do n't even have a * word * for pie . 
  we have alm\u00e1s pite . 
  this is kind of demotivational . 
  i already have an existential crisis daily about the importance of my work , reading something that tells me it 's even less important than i thought it was makes me really sad . 
  what i mean is , if you put a regular plane into orbit and deorbited it , then it would n't survive reentry for a lot of reasons . 
  but the plane parts that ksp gives you are ones that * would * survive reentry . 
  those kinds of parts , whether you use them for spaceplanes or not , are post-rocket technology . 
  torta is cake , and s\u00fctem\u00e9ny is pastry . 
  a pie * is * a s\u00fctem\u00e9ny , but just saying `` s\u00fctem\u00e9ny '' is n't enough to specify that the food is a pie . 
  and `` s\u00fcti '' is a cookie . 
  when i have to say pie in hungarian , i usually just say `` pite torta '' like it 's a thing . 
  hah , maybe when * you * deorbit them ... 
  holy shit , your headaches can control the weather . 
  `` transport '' and `` carry '' have the same problem in that context : they both sound like the protein is moving around with the molecule inside it . 
  `` transport '' is the official term , though . 
  ( not that you should have gotten a point off ), 
  maybe not a * third * ... but , in any case , it 's reasonable to leave out , since almost everybody knows all of that . 
   that ship should n't be able to make that kind of maneuver without like a ton of \u2206 v, 
  rule 2 of science fiction : all spaceships have infinite \u2206 v and infinite twr, 
  if this does n't deserve a `` master kerbalnaut '' flair , i do n't know what does .
