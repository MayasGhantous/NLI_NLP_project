  i took just the opposite path on the fork . 
  a message popped up , `` you have n't backed up in 9001 days , '' and i thought a bit about backing up . 
  but then i decided against it . 
  so , of course the drive fails the next day . 
  thank you for the input !,

  is there any way to reinstall windows without losing all my files again ? 
  not that there 's that many , it 's just there 's so much to remember and install that it takes several hours to do and i always miss something . 
  okay .

  hahaha , fuck those cables !, 
  i 'm ambivalent about my non-modular ones , because i can make myself not care about them pretty easily . 
  but man , fuck the system panel cables !, 
  i swear , if i ever find a case that does all of them in one piece , i 'm never buying any other case again , no matter how hard it sucks or how expensive it is . 
  that sounds extremely !! fun !! .

  i 've tried to never bother with those stupid clips . 
  i 'm relatively new to building , and first thing i did was throw out the stock fan with the damn clips and get something with screws , like the cooler master hyper 212 .

  it is a 2d platformer , with the most beautiful oil-paint graphics and lots of inventive puzzles involving time travel that will drive you crazy . 
  there is no dialogue ; instead , the story is told in the form of diaries , a few pages unlocked with each chapter . 
  the ending is strange and definitely is what you make of it !,

  hmmm ... the m4 is sold out at newegg , and retails there for $ 160 . 
  where are these magical ~ $ 130 prices ? 
  and about the psu , i found it relatively cheap compared to the other ~ 850w ones by seasonic . 
  perhaps i was missing something obvious ; i 'll go back and check . 
  edit : after a bit of research , i could n't find the m4 for under $ 150 . 
  i 'll ask him about it . 
  i have an ide 60gb deskstar on my shelf . 
  it failed when i was on the move in san francisco with my laptop around six years ago ( i replaced it with an identical 100gb drive ) . 
  recently i built a new computer , and it has a single ide connector . 
  i decided that i had nothing to lose , and plugged it in ... * holy shit it works . 
  * it failed after a few hours , but i was able to transfer all of my crappy ms paint drawings and shareware games before it died . 
  it already exists , / r/mcmetacirclejerk, 
  at least frozen synapse gets the exposure . 
  i played the game while it was still in extreme beta ( is n't it still ? 
  ) , and the impression i got was that they really need more recognition . 
  it really is a cool game , and aging online with the existing players used to be fun , but , i dunno , the pvp network seemed to have died a while ago . 
  hopefully the influx of potential players will wrench it forward from obscurity . 
  i assumed it was old english ( \u00c6nglisc ) at first , but then i was like , wait , noooooo .

  care to let me in on it ?

  many more memories .

  i would have forgiven the shit outta the first one . 
  if they have n't done a password reset before , or use a service that really does do this and that 's the only one they 've had experience with , then it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to assume that they 'd have been given a password . 
  nearly all of europe , where < i  is actually pronounced / i / . 
  we call it / ` vi , fi / here in hungary . 
  she was being a good customer , and said exactly what she needed to say . 
  i want to clap . 
  this is incredibly well-done . 
  in hungary , anyway , we use a fascimile of the english pronunciation : [ e\u02d0t\u0283 ti\u02d0 \u025bm \u025bl\u02d0 ] . 
  but no , in ipa , & lt ;  is for orthography , while / / is for phonology . 
  [ ] is for pronunciation . 
  ( for comparison , in english , [ wa\u026a fa\u026a ] for `` wi-fi '' , [ e\u026at\u0283 ti\u02d0j \u025bm \u025b\u028e\u02d0 ] or similar for `` html '' . 
  but the latter is n't a very good representation ; you have to account for weak palatalization and aspiration in the t , and the l is n't really pronounced like that . 
  really , the first one is n't very good either , because american accents tend to start more closed than / a / after labial consonants ( that is , / w / exclusively ) , more like [ woa\u026a fa\u026a ] but less stupid-looking . ), 
  sorry , i knew that , it just hit me . 
  :p see the edit . 
  happy cake day !, 
  this post 's title definitely looked like something to do with bacon at first .
