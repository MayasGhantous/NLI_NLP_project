  i guess i 've just never seen a huge blob of protein before . 
  then again , cheese probably qualifies . 
  eww , virus cheese , that could be a thing ... 
  that trick of vibrating to a shift is my favorite one . 
  i figured it would look like egg whites ( which is literally the word for protein in my first language ) : a disgusting transparent slime . 
  but then you 've basically just described snot . 
  which , granted , is mostly protein , but smaller ones than viruses . 
  maybe we should just forget about the water and say it 's a whitish powder .

  3 . x is not a significant improvement over 2 . x , needs you to update your code , and 2 . x is n't forwards-compatible with 3 . x. 
  i 'm always trying to migrate to 3 . x , but then i discover some sticking point . 
  most recently , i found out that they took out reduce ( ) . 
  usually the progression is that first there are comments predicting butthurt , then comments saying that there are always more comments predicting butthurt than actual butthurt , and then finally butthurt . 
  however , in this case it 's butthurt -  this comment -  more butthurt . 
  are yuo of kidding ?

  the prefix `` inter - '' means `` finally '' . 
  `` interficere '' , `` to do finally ( kill ) '' , `` interire '' , `` to go finally ( die ) '' , `` interferre '' , `` to carry finally ( carry off ) '' . 
  `` intercedere '' and `` intervenire '' do n't quite fit the pattern ; i guess romans thought of intercessions as final . 
  the preposition and the prefix can have different meanings . 
  `` per '' is as a prefix `` thoroughly '' , while as a preposition `` through '' . 
  i have been taught that `` inter '' has the same kind of two meanings , in that case being `` finally '' . 
  i still maintain it should be way out in kerbol 's orbit , and be the size of jool !, 
  i think you should n't try to convince sido to do realism . 
  i posted a whole wall of text just to nitpick the descriptions , and that was ignored !, 
  and the thing is , i agree with sido 's point about it being `` just a game '' . 
  moons may not be able to have moons irl , but they 're fun to have in my game . 
  there 's a lot of cool things in the planet pack and i 'd like to keep them . 
  ( please let me repost the wall of text though !, 
  i 'm sad nobody ever read it except sido :, 
  well , you asked for it !, 
  - the heat of gas planets is n't affected much by their distance from their sun , except for hot jupiters , which urania is n't . 
  they are uniformly cold on the outside and hot on the inside ; their exteriors block light and heat up negligibly , and on their interiors the gases inside of them are compressed greatly to make them hot . 
  how hot depends on their mass . 
  the inside of jupiter is much hotter than the inside of uranus . 
  jupiter is 317.8 earth masses , while uranus is 14.5 earth masses . 
  so , if urania is hotter than jool , it 's because it has more mass , although i like it more as an ice giant . 
  - as funny as the `` large meal '' comment is for deimos , the force of gravity is linearly proportional to the mass of the thing attracted ; that is , the acceleration due to gravity is constant with respect to the mass of the thing attracted . 
  heavier things are n't more affected by gravity . 
  i guess in a roundabout way having a big meal would help , though : while you would n't accelerate more , you 'd have to exert a greater force with your legs/jetpack to move yourself . 
  you 'd be more stable . 
  - how did vulcania have an ocean in the first place ? 
  you could say it used to have an ocean , but then a huge asteroid impact made its rotational speed much higher and then it lost it . 
  this also gives me a really cool idea for a planet : earth , but with no water . 
  - nitrogen gas is actually totally colorless . 
  you 're thinking of ** organo ** nitrogens , like on titan . 
  that 's where you got the idea from , right ? 
  - `` seem ** s ** to be an angry planet . '', 
  or even , '' ** it ** seem ** s ** to be an angry planet . '', 
  - `` thermis '' should be capitalized for minos . 
  - methane gas is vaguely [ cyan ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/uranus2.jpg ) , not orange . 
  i know where you got that from , though : liquid methane is orangey-brown , like you got right in the oceans , and also methane-water ice , methane clathrate , found on earth at the bottom of the ocean , is a beautiful bright orange , and is eaten by adorable little worms . 
  also , striking a match would n't do anything , unless hermes 's atmosphere also contains significant amounts of oxygen . 
  burning is combustion , and requires oxygen , not present in methane . 
  it would n't contain significant amounts of oxygen , though , since any oxygen in there would have gotten ignited by chance . 
  - releasing chlorophyll into the air offends my sensibilities as a biologist . 
  you had a perfectly good setup for `` air algae '' , floating unicellular or oligocellular plants , although if you were being realistic then they would be in the air because they were blown there , and then they would settle on the ground and be blown up again , and so on , but there would be so many that there would be a lot in the air at one time anyway . 
  this makes for big paths of green where the wind is blowing , and green weather is awesome . 
  but `` releasing chlorophyll into the air '' is just wrong !, 
  i accept that it could refer to a chlorophyll analogue instead of chlorophyll itself , but why in god 's name would they be releasing it ? 
  they need it !, 
  and chlorophyll is n't a gas anyway , it 's a bunch of really heavy molecules bundled up in protein , and contains magnesium . 
  releasing it would never evolve for any reason . 
  also , would n't a world where nearly everything is photosynthetic quickly use up all the carbon ? 
  i guess the algae could learn to cannibalize each other , which would be awesome , but i doubt so many of them would be present in that case . 
  or maybe they do n't do carbon fixation at all , but directly replenish some other energy source !, 
  or maybe a lot of their cellular processes produce a ubiquitous carbon-containing waste compound ( almost certainly carbon dioxide ) , which their photosynthesis is n't efficient enough to totally eliminate . 
  - hyperion ca n't be `` almost a dwarf star '' . 
  it would need to be as big as jupiter to be almost a dwarf star , and that 's just the volume requirement , not even anywhere near the mass requirement ; the lower limit on the mass of a star is somewhere between 75 and 80 jupiter masses . 
  there 's a name for `` almost a dwarf star '' , by the way , and it 's [ brown dwarf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_dwarf ) . 
  you can blame the extreme heat on the tidal forces , but then you 'd have to put it extremely close to urania , and then you would n't be able to have erato . 
  otherwise there is no way a body can stay that hot : it would radiate away the heat quickly . 
  if / u/jmile69 comes around , he might be able to tell you any stuff i missed or said incorrectly . ), 
  but then the air does n't go through the turbine and `` pull '' the plane , resulting in you needing to put actual thrusters on the plane instead of turbines . 
  so , much more terrible fuel economy , really . 
  edit : `` powering '' is a terrible word for what the air does to the plane . 
  [ golf balls have shapes specifically made to exploit the magnus effect . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golf_ball#design ) your point about baseballs stands , although their surfaces have irregularities in them , too . 
  they are definitely not going at the same speed as billiard balls , also . 
  billiard balls are much heavier than is the maximum mass at which air resistance is a significant force , for that shape and velocity . 
  i mean , have you felt one ?
