   says he did n't use piecewise functions, 
   equations completely covered in abs ( x ), 
  you would n't expect poland 's backyard to be on fire , since backyards are n't normally on fire . 
  but in this case it is , so it 's funny ( since unconventional things are funny ) . 
  i figured `` air resistance '' means that the air ca n't exert a repulsive force on something . 
  so , essentially , the air is there , but it does n't interact with the object of concern . 
  ah , sorry , i meant to ring last time ; this is a copy/paste . 
  the purpose was , is there anything aborrently wrong in this list ? 
  it details the errors in the planet descriptions for sido 's planet pack . 
  why is it that whenever you have a plane that relies on sas force , you consistently use the * smaller * sas modules ? 
  the bigger one is completely unstoppable in my experience . 
  you should still have the saved crafts , though . 
  the only thing broken about your save should be persistent.sfs . 
  did you totally run out of fuel ? 
  you could have burned directly towards earth to get there sooner !, 
  the wiki agrees with you , but what the heck is a flight computer ? 
  i was taught intel x86 assembly by my father when i was very young . 
  i kind of sucked at it though , so later he taught me c , and i was very happy with that for years . 
  then , in 8th grade i discovered the wonderful language that is python , and that has been my primary language since . 
  ^ ( ( also somewhere along the way i became fluent in common lisp but i 've forgotten all of it ) ^ ), 
  it never has n't worked for me . 
  strange . 
  i took a course like that in java in high school . 
  i can completely corroborate his statement . 
  the teacher 's purpose was mostly to make sure kids were on task ( which he did a terrible job of , unfortunately ) , and to hand out grades for late assignments . 
  it 's strange , since he was a dedicated and excellent calculus teacher who took on this course willingly . 
  physics is * far * more practical than math , though ... most math has literally no irl application . 
  or if you 've ever taken latin : [ ` kainorh\u0251bditis ] , `` kie-nor-hob-dee-tees '' ( but with the second `` o '' and the `` ee `` s not being long ) . 
  sure , but it 's transcribed to latin . 
  no greek would ever write `` caeno '' !, 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/redmap.jpg ) is why the hungarians ( we ) historically wanted to revise trianon since forever . 
  ( the map is from 1910 , but the distribution remains roughly the same ), 
  [ transylvania ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ from austria ] ( #green - text ), 
  although we could have come in handy when the turks overran constantinople . 
  not that your country is n't the best , but what about those riots ? 
  ^ ( what were those even about ), 
  solution : everyone just read the bbc , die welt , and aljazeera, 
  huh , that 's really interesting . 
  so some of the scientific words that look like latin words derived from greek actually had the latinization take place directly when they were introduced into scientific vocabulary ? 
  that 's really funny !, 
  ^ ( ( also do n't worry i can read/write greek letters , i was just making a statement about transcription conventions ) ^ ), 
  dear inernet , today i learned switzerland is big, 
  the peters projection makes all the shapes ugly though . 
  i prefer projections that meet halfway , like the [ dymaxion projection ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dymaxion_projection ) . 
  or the [ goode homolosine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goode_homolosine_projection ) is a really cool equal-area one if you 're not into navigation by sea ( or antarctica or greenland ) . 
  edit : i was trying to find a really good one i once saw taped to someone 's wall ( which just read `` times projection '' which does n't appear to be a real thing ; it might have just been robinson , but i remember it being rectangular ... ) , and i stumbled upon the [ cahill butterfly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cahill_butterfly ) and [ waterman butterfly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/waterman_butterfly_projection ) projections , both of which are great and like dymaxion but better in most ways . 
  and he was fitting a cubic , so that 's * 4 * points . 
  then again i think he had the constant term be 0 . 
  hydroxylic acid is the scariest-sounding one imo . 
  there is a common dumb conspiracy theory , and you did n't expect there to be a sub making fun of it ? 
  ( really , s/there is a common dumb conspiracy theory/it exists / ), 
  who 's going to take you seriously if you use a word that makes you sound 400 years old ? 
  fine , someone 25 years old trying to sound 400 years old . 
  ( but i would n't take a 400 year old biologist seriously , unless they had a good reputation . 
  who knows what centuries-old beliefs about biology they refuse to let go of ? ), 
  if germany had his way , they 'd be playing * die siedler von catan * . 
  that 's terrible advice . 
  just give the brush tool a hard edge and you wo n't need to go over anything . 
  ( i.e. , use pencil ), 
  they are not just assholes . 
  they are a properly dangerous cult that destroys lives . 
  you can read all sorts of horrible things about them . 
  read this fantastic [ ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1pe0kb/ ) . 
  i think that was what he was trying to do . 
  maybe they put the rook on there before it was colored and were too lazy to move it . 
  no problem !, 
  sorry i thought badly of you , i thought you were recommending drawing over the specks knowing you could use pencil . 
  oh ... now i feel dumb . 
  get over it ? 
  is that david garrett ? 
  ( while writing this post , i 've discovered there 's no way to say you do n't like pop/classical crossover music but do n't mind if someone else does without coming off as horribly snobbish , not even this one . 
  pretend i found a way anyway . ), 
  you know magyar paprika ? 
  brought by the ottomans . 
  ( also are you talking about t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt k\u00e1poszta ? 
  it is the tastiest dish in existence , i am not even exaggerating . ), 
   in latin, 
  no it is n't !, 
  edit : did you just fucking downvote me , you little shit ? 
  ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with downvoting on a sub with downvotes disabled ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  youre fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and thats just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever downvote was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking finger . 
  but you couldnt , you didnt , and now youre paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  youre fucking dead , kiddo . 
  depends what resources you already have available . 
  a good rough approximation of value in relation to the numbers on the resources is to add up the values of all the resource tiles you own of that port and divide by 2 . 
  well , if nothing else , ram . 
  trying it with white rice also helps . 
  a total sub meltdown would be awesome to watch .
