  you 'll just need to tweak the ones you already have , or launch old ones wholesale . 
  even this one , you could just keep launching again , and again , and again ... 
  i 'd like to see it on dres or ike . 
  it was a zircon crystal from 168 my after the formation of earth , i.e. 
  yes !, 
  yes !, 
  thank you so much , this will make life a whole lot easier, 
  that poor amethyst crystal :(, 
  it just keeps happennig ... 
  you can add variety by getting a cell phone and laptop, 
  supercavitation ? 
  worst-case-scenario , never . 
  rng plays pokemon had to be restarted because the rng released all the pokemon . 
  you have no money to offer them if you are rescued ? 
  like , not even back at your place ( s ) of living ? 
  that is entirely your own fault . 
  better example : / r/all, 
  i 've had really bad experiences with that mod . 
  for some reason my 2000-part mostly-jumbo-tank hyper-rockets blow up on the launchpad outright . 
  there 's also a smaller version of that tank that probably weighs even less , so you can replace it with that . 
  it just blows up on the launchpad . 
  the launchpad itself , strangely , does n't blow up . 
  - irl , your speed actually approaches the speed of light as your kinetic energy gets higher . 
  in ksp , it just increases linearly ( square root-ly , actually ; your kinetic energy is half the square of your speed ) . 
  also , irl , as your speed with respect to something gets higher , you see it as slowing down . 
  in ksp this does not happen . 
  - irl , gravity bends space rather than exerting a force , so orbits `` roll around '' the body in a phenomenon known as [ apsidal precession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apsidal_precession ) . 
  this does n't happen in ksp . 
  - irl , the gravity of everything acts on everything else at the same time . 
  in ksp , large bodies do n't exert gravity on each other ( and neither do small things for that matter ) , and only one body can exert gravity on you at a time . 
  this approximation is known as [ patched conics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patched_conic_approximation ) , without which all orbits are unstable . 
  - irl , pieces of things are n't rigid , and crumple up when they hit something really fast . 
  in ksp , each part is a rigid body , and is connected to the other parts by invisible springs , and just disappears when it hits something hard enough . 
  an example of a game that does this properly is [ beamng.drive ] ( http://youtu.be/x77cthd4vj8 ) . 
  - irl , air resistance depends on the area of the cross-section of the object facing the direction it 's going in , and the direction the air hits the craft can be exploited to create [ lift ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lift_%28force%29 ) . 
  in ksp , each part is a point that has a certain amount of drag , even nosecones ( which , believe it or not , have a positive amount of drag ) , and a certain degree of lift ( usually 0 unless it 's a wing ) . 
  this is probably the biggest physics fudge in ksp , and is what makes asparagus staging possible . 
  you can install a mod called far which actually calculates air resistance the right way . 
  - irl , reaction wheels that are on a certain plane can only rotate the ship in that plane . 
  in ksp , reaction wheels can rotate a rocket every which way . 
  [ here 's an example of how reaction wheels work in real life . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/n_6p-1j551y ), 
  - irl , things heat up really hot when they go through the atmosphere really fast . 
  in ksp , everything is extremely heatproof , even the kerbals themselves . 
  - irl , you communicate with your craft with radio , which can take up to two seconds to get somewhere near earth , fractions of hours to get to mars ( depending on where it is ) , and hours to get to places beyond the asteroid belt . 
  in ksp , you communicate with your craft instantly . 
  this is consistent with the fact that there is no upper limit on your speed in ksp ; it simply means that light travels infinitely fast ( which in a way it really does , considering that the rendering engine puts light in places instantly ) . 
  other things that are unrealistic , but not physically impossible :, 
  - irl , it 's common for planets to have axial tilt , i.e. 
  not spin in the direction they orbit . 
  in ksp , planets have no axial tilt . 
  this makes getting to orbit from the surface of something pretty easy . 
  - irl , life needs a constant energy input . 
  kerbals , however , last forever . 
  - irl , space is relatively filled with tons of small rocks and dust , especially near heavy bodies like jupiter . 
  in ksp , the smallest thing there is is gilly and there 's only like 30 bodies in total . 
  designing proteins . 
  the cells were supposed to evolve them for me , but i accidentally killed them . 
  have you seen [ provo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/flag_of_provo%2c_utah.svg ) 's flag ? 
  provo : `` we can into can into better internet , worse flag than you . '', 
  even if he is ( he 's not , anytime soon ) you can always download it with [ ` wget ` ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wget ) or [ ` curl ` ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curl ) . 
  in hungarian we also have entirely agglutinative verbs , yet we have a few irregular verbs . 
  the irregularity mainly comes in the form of having different stems for different forms of the verb . 
  iirc that kind of process comes from having a few different verbs merge together into one verb . 
  i guess turkish never had any redundant verbs from the onset ? 
  does it work better than just what you get by typing ` wget - r - nc - p http://www.mspaintadventures.com` ? 
  in my experience links and stuff tend to be broken in offline versions . 
  wget is no exception but you may as well get it immediately rather than not immediately . 
  alternis ? 
  also , what mod gave you that wonderful sand texture for the other runway ? 
  i do n't think that 's what it was intended to be , but another piece of evidence you could cite is that there is no way she would land in a lake in a paradise like that . 
  ( then again , i managed to land in a tiny lake once in ksp . 
  it was a goddamn miracle . ), 
  what kind of hardcore tea drinker uses teabags ? 
  thanks !, 
  i use it for other things , too . 
  i use the grey/cyan one the most . 
  come on , do you really think those sas units have wheels in more than one direction ? 
  especially the big sas unit ; it 's ring-shaped , not cylinder-shaped !, 
  as a protein engineer : this is how a protein goes from being one that docks to itself in pairs to being one that forms chains . 
  - williamson , michael p. * how proteins work * . 
  new york : garland science , taylor & francis group , llc , 2012 . 
  wow , this is extremely cool . 
  once i finish doing the grand tour i should try this . 
  what does efficient docking look like ? 
  i can dock anything to anything but i do it pretty much like mechjeb . 
  while a protein would never evolve to do that if it were a bad * thing , any protein will unravel and stack up into [ amyloid fiber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amyloid ) if it is left floating around too long ( in the manner of uncollected trash ) , usually folding into some sort of [ tube ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=amyloid&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=y6wsu9trdshpoath_ycica&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=808#q=amyloid%20structure&amp;revid=1991876757&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_ ) . 
  this is very bad and [ amyloid beta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beta_amyloid ) is a large component of alzheimer 's disease . 
  some kinds of amyloid fibers are so attractive that they will induce perfectly functional proteins to become part of them . 
  these are [ prions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prions ) . 
  ^ ( * note that `` bad '' just means that it prevents the host from reproducing . 
  proteins that chain out of control are perfectly acceptable if the host is n't going to have any more children . ), 
  you should have made an action group that undocks all the docking ports . 
   by around 70 billion, 
  70 billion whats ? 
  it ca n't be 70 billion times ... 
  i do n't think strongly-worded letters will help much against russia ... we appreciate the thought , though . 
  why ? 
  enjoying a game and wanting to finish it as quickly as possible are two completely consistent things . 
  you 're welcome !,
