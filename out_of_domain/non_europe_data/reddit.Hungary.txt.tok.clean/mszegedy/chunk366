  actually , i 've been thinking of making a game like ksp where you design proteins instead of spaceships , but so far every 3d library i 've found is either really ( unnecessarily ) difficult to use , or costs money ( unity i am looking at you ) . 
  maybe i 'll just simplify it to 2d and use libsdl . 
  or i could just code my own yeah right , ai n't nobody got time for that . 
  i was there since the beginning . 
  it 's just that it 's not ironic for people to want to finish a game and to be sad when it 's over . 
  if it were cheese , i 'd eat it . 
  well , 1.5 days in . 
  that 's close enough to count , is n't it ? 
   based on sex, 
  what is n't ? 
  and you ca n't put kerbals in eas seats from the onset , either , which is also terrible and shameful . 
  already done i think, 
  it 's really difficult to get a sense of where your ships are in relation to each other . 
  and then , they also tend to drift in one direction or the other , so the axis you thought it was on 5 seconds ago is no longer the axis it is on now . 
  docking with a port not facing the same direction as your craft ? 
  you made it hard , man !, 
  i keep wanting to install rasterpropmonitor , but then i want all my crafts to still be usable if i have to switch to an install with no mods , and if i want to do a contest . 
  i occasionally need the iva altimeter for contests , so it would be cheating to use rpm in the meantime . 
  maybe if i ever get oculus rift . 
  now strike eve with the whole thing at once . 
  tons , tons of science . 
  lies !, 
  [ xbr ] ( https://github.com/libretro/common-shaders/tree/master/xbr ) is [ the best algorithm ] ( http://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2248 ) !, 
  what i really like about their scaling algorithm is that it mostly preserves colors , but if the colors come out similar enough then it 'll do gradients too . 
  the result can be pretty cool like with the save icon . 
  unfortunately trying to preserve colors ends up sometimes making features that are supposed to be smooth look blocky , like on some of the smw sprites . 
  maybe their algorithm could have a similarity threshold you can set on a run-by-run/pic-by-pic basis , for how similar colors have to be for them to be turned into a gradient . 
  [ some of them are . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stromatolite ) and geology , at least , is . 
  well , without sex there would n't be any geologists , would there ? 
  become a biologist and you , too , can see the world this way !, 
  i thought it only had one biome . 
  but the science multiplier for eve is much higher than the mun 's . 
  i wager you 'd get as much science if you air-dropped all those plus a few computing nose-cones , then you 'd be able to get as much science along the way , if not more . 
  high-orbit and low-orbit you could just do with a mpl , but high-atmosphere , low-atmosphere , and surface are all many hundreds of science points per type of experiment each . 
  but does n't rpm use externally-placable cameras ? 
  i do n't think i 'd be able to land without downward-facing cameras !, 
  thanks for the input !, 
  if i can ask you one more thing , did you go into map mode at all ? 
  or was the mission done entirely from the cockpit ? 
  how did you set up the intercept ? 
  simulations ? 
  i listen to classical music , and lots of orchestras/people release stuff primarily on cd . 
  this is changing though ; most recently i 've bought the complete set of works of il giardino armonico ... on itunes . 
  are you sure it has enough jpg ? 
  [ here 's a slightly bigger version ] ( https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/845885/xo2pudoqwuupa2v6bkbdqmusnv0/large_chart-of-the-day-the-death-of-.jpg ), 
  thank you , i used jmodeltest to determine the right model ( turns out it 's gtr+i+g no matter how you cut it ) . 
  what is a stereotypical superhero ? 
  does it mean that the superhero identity can not be related to stereotypes of the country ? 
  while i can think of some good comics outside of that , half the fun of polandball is stereotypes . 
  is not fair , saying that we are not smart . 
  our primary export is great mathematicians . 
  i thought it was `` we ** do not ** want to see '' !, 
  as much as i love bashing romanians over the internet , that story is `` possibly apocryphal '' and might not even have involved romanians . 
  wow . 
  i know what case i 'm getting next time i build a computer . 
  yeah , but if your rcs ports are n't evenly distributed around your com then it 'll be a lot harder . 
  no , it is n't . 
  sas is for keeping your ship facing the same way . 
  it does nothing to prevent lateral drift . 
  that is what ... some component of mechjeb ... is for . 
  but , of course , you learn to deal with it just like all of docking . 
  the article calls hot jupiters `` exotic '' . 
  are they really exotic ? 
  it seems we find them pretty frequently . 
  ! = = = = / = = = / = = = <  ! = syntactically correct, 
  huh . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  unfortunately , that 's when the first part of the problem , `` it 's really difficult to get a sense of where your ships are in relation to each other , '' comes in . 
  then you try and put it back on the docking axis , and in the meantime you accidentally add some vertical drift and you cancel it out and you go back to the docking axis and you 're * sure * it 's the docking axis and you hit h as hard as you can and you slam into the space station 5 meters to the left for some reason ... 
  i 'm not sure how i even manage to dock so well . 
  you can kind of think of water as a zero-carbon alcohol . 
  between the h and the oh , methanol has one ch * _ 2 _ * , ethanol has two ch * _ 2 _ * s , propanol has three ... and water has zero . 
  they even have similar properties . 
  ( disclaimer : do n't try to reason this way with your professor !, 
  it is wrong . ), 
  edit : and let me tell you about how h * _ 2 _ * is a hydrocarbon ... 
  aaaaugh , run !, 
  but , wow , that is ominous . 
  it is like virus jurassic park , * in siberia . 
  * ... but poor acanthamoeba !, 
  on the one hand , if anyone invented it it was the brits when they started burning coal ( not entirely their fault ; britain was full of coal ) . 
  on the other hand , the hunger for * oil * came from america , starting with standard oil and john d. rockefeller . 
  and it 's also the world 's largest producer of beef . 
  but if you want to consider the people who are responsible for global climate change the first living organisms who ever significantly changed the climate , you 'd have to start with the invention of photosynthesis by the ancestors of cyanobacteria 2.4 billion years ago , who started fixing carbon enough to turn most of the co2 from our atmosphere into o2 and sugar , and who originated in water part of which is definitely now part of the us . 
  well , completely valid brainfuck ... but who would leave comments like `` ddsadjh '' ? 
  if this is analogous to the incredibles universe , then the usa is syndrome and israel is someone who buys syndrome 's weapons . 
  dual boot ? 
  all slavic languages and romanian * and * hungarian have a similar grammar to latin . 
  they 're slightly more agglutinative but it 's basically the same thing . 
  no problem !, 
  still , without knowing much about polish i 'd wager it is at least as latin as my language , hungarian . 
  this , as you mentioned , comes from the christians coming to `` civilize '' us ( both magyars and poles ) in the 900s . 
  as a result the case usages/prepositional meanings are quite similar , and most technical vocabulary is latin-based like in english , but even more so ; the words tend to be copied directly with barely any transcription or modification ; e.g. , compare polish * chemia * and hungarian * kemia * with greek * chemeia * ( latin afaik has no official word for `` chemistry '' ; wikipedia uses * chemia * which is doubtless of rennaissance origin ) , and contrast with english * chemistry * . 
  does this all sound familiar ? 
  since polish and hungarian both have the same backstory , we 'd have the same affectation as well . 
  i wonder if the rest of the slavic languages are like that . 
  i know russian has a different backstory but it has wound up relatively the same as far as i can see ( i know enough technical russian to talk about computationally modeling proteins , but i do n't know how to ask where the bathrooms are or how do you do ) . 
  but xp ? 
  some of the intermediate images for his `` coral '' fractals are worthy of david goodsell .
