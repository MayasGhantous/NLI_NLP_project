  i wonder if this sort of technique is any good for actual rendering of things . 
  i do n't like that rule , anyhow . 
  i subscribed to read interesting stuff that is interesting because of my interest in dwarf fortress . 
  this is one of those . 
  the dome fossil should only say start9 . 
  for fusion you need to get particles to push on each other hard enough for a reaction to occur . 
  you can get them to do this either by pressing them together really hard , like inside the sun , or by colliding them together really fast , like inside this reactor . 
  ( alas , daft punk does not work as a good mnemonic for this , because `` better '' has no analog . ), 
  if you had some really fast-moving particles escape the reactor , then they 'd hit some particles really fast and do a fusion reaction . 
  but the new particles would be a lot heavier and slower . 
  if a proton hits a nitrogen atom in the atmosphere then [ it just turns into a lightweight oxygen and a high-energy photon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cno_cycle.svg ) , the former of which then decays into a neutrino , a positron , and a heavy nitrogen , which is stable ; all the tiny particles generated in the process have negligible effect from thereon out . 
  there will be no protons bouncing around in the atmosphere , thankfully . 
  ( notice in the cno cycle that nitrogen , oxygen , and carbon fusion is fueled by protons . ), 
  i thought i had gotten over my genetic prejudice towards romanians . 
  i was wrong ; this was still the funniest polandball comic i 've seen in months . 
  to be fair , that was a 15-year-old . 
  that is the age group with highest percentage of shitheads . 
  the first comment i 've ever saved on this website without gold powers . 
  but , i have to ask : are n't you only supposed to trim butthole hair , otherwise it 'll get lubricated with sweat and then shut with suction ? 
  damn , i wish there were n't such a stigma against publishing this kind of stuff . 
  null results are just as valuable as positive results , and somehow even scientific journals need to hype their articles enough that they ca n't acknowledge that . 
  maybe they thought it was supposed to be a `` ruby '' ? 
  this is the update that i have been ever excited for the most . 
  i would probably have been more excited for 0.18 , but that was before i started playing ksp . 
  if i win the logo contest , i 'll enter it . 
  did n't the bacterium also have a virus on it ? 
  obviously to build your fortress up from the ground . 
  the philippines ? 
  but , what about the philippine-american war ? 
  i guess being an ally in wwii really does count for something . 
   saved them from japan, 
  well , helped . 
  1m + filipinos still died unfortunately . 
  unfortunately , ford prefect trying to shake hands with a cow is probably less funny than him trying to shake hands with a car . 
  then again cars probably outweigh cattle by many times . 
  i can never find these people . 
  :\\ where am i supposed to look , facebook ? 
  it 's a shame he only did the first movement . 
  the third would have made a much better chiptune . 
  this is like the little brother of dickrhino 's comic about america . 
  i saw it just after seeing gravity , so i kind of really did n't like it . 
  gravity raised my standards for realism in space-based science fiction . 
  ( not that it was entirely realistic in the first place . ), 
  i did n't say europa report has any less merit . 
  i just did n't enjoy watching it , partly because i was used to space being more spectacular and more newtonian . 
  it did n't help that the astronauts all behaved like college-aged kids . 
  sorry , i just did n't find it very immersive . 
  it has its merits but it 's not a movie i would watch again . 
  ( do n't take it personally ; sometimes people do n't even enjoy a whole genre ! ), 
  unfortunately if there is an obvious way to complete a part of the game `` perfectly '' ( e.g. 
  hole in one in golf ) or `` to the highest degree '' ( e.g. 
  getting the highest rating in a timed level ) , then either i ignore it and feel * really uncomfortable * about it and not enjoy the game because of it , or i spend lots of time getting it right doing the same thing over again and not enjoy the game because of that . 
  it is very detrimental to my gaming experience and i wish i did n't have to feel about it that way ( or alternatively always get it right in the first few tries ; this worked with super meat boy ) . 
  i do n't play games very much as a result ; mostly sandbox games . 
  should have learned from [ this guy 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertyworldproblems/comments/1armlo/i_have_built_an_underwater_libertarian_utopia/ ) mistakes . 
  h\u00e1karl is worse than surstr\u00f6mming . 
  congratulations on eating it ; few people would have the guts . 
  i think if i had seen * the fight club * before it i would be comparing it to * the fight club * and complaining about lack of characterization . 
  air ( or water ) comes out of the tube and fills the balloon . 
  as opposed to harder ways to fill the balloon with a fluid . 
  those shock diamonds ... 
  i wonder about the ridiculous exhaust velocity of that thruster . 
  tip : radial intakes float like styrofoam . 
  hungary for justice = a + + pun, 
  ( also you must be kidding about wwiii ), 
  i have a similar thing where i isolate my engraver . 
  i drop down food and booze via a chute occasionally . 
  i have her/him dig tunnels in a space-filling curve pattern and engrave the walls . 
  hash , pound , or number . 
  i 've heard it called `` octothorpe '' a few times , but i never say it because it sounds slightly pretentious due to its obscurity . 
  i heard someone call it the tic-tac-toe sign once . 
  when in the us , i lived in new jersey , massachusetts , and california . 
  interestingly i do n't know the name for it in my native language , hungarian . 
  growing up , when my father taught me programming , he called @ , # , and & all `` at '' or `` et '' . 
  ( technically , he was only wrong about # . 
  there was no way to tell whether he was saying `` at '' or `` et '' , and @ is commonly pronounced `` at '' , while & is a stylized `` et '' . ), 
  thankfully he only taught me ( intel x86 ) assembly and c so this terminology was not confusing . 
  my theory for why it is called `` hash '' ( i should really look this up ) : it was used to indicate hashmaps/hashtables ( until , a little annoyingly , perl ) . 
  these were so called because they were based on converting strings to `` hashes '' . 
  and hashes were called so because they were a messy string of differently-shaped hexadecimal digits , just like hash is a messy plate of differently-shaped foods . 
  edit : oh and `` sharp '' / `` isz '' ( [ is ] ) when in a musical context or just when talking with people whose primary point of reference was music . 
  not that it is the same sign . 
  just to screw with them . 
  while the engraver does level up , nobody is going to see those hallways unless they accidentally fall into the beer chute . 
  i 've heard it called that !, 
  okay , that 's what it is , then . 
  then the first movement * was * better for that . 
  he also could have done appassionata for that . 
  or done something really clever and remixed a chiptune to sound like piano , like bloody tears ( which has a [ great piano remix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjgrhbybmdi ) on youtube by the way ) . 
  but movement 3 would have sounded really great as a chiptune . 
  it arguably makes a * better * chiptune piece than a piano piece . 
  if i ever find the time i 'll try and remix it . 
  edit : or ohhhh , do you know what would sound really great that would make the chiptune a piano ? 
  saint-sa\u00ebns 's 2nd piano concerto , first movement . 
  wow , that would really sound piano-like and also awesome . 
  it 's made entirely out of terms with odd powers ; every time n goes up by one , the degree goes up by two . 
  the intermediate terms are all 0 , because they are multiplied by whatever the sine of 0 is , which is 0 . 
  ( the rest are multiplied by cos ( 0 ) or - cos ( 0 ) , which is 1 and -1 respectively . ), 
   not a very common english curse, 
  yeah , right !,
