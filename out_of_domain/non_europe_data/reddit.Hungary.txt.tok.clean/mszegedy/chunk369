  but then why did n't she have to sync velocity with it with the soyuz ? 
  she was n't orbiting at quite the same speed , but no way the difference was more than 30 m/s ( at a wild overestimate ) . 
  i 'd guess the debris field decelerated both the iss and the chinese station , but i ca n't quite see how the soyuz itself got decelerated ( attachment to the iss while it was being decelerated ? 
  general quantum rocket surgery is way harder . 
  you need to know tensors . 
  the debris field is spread out evenly across a particular orbit that happens to intersect their orbit at a particular point . 
  it 's quite thick . 
  edit : ( i mean this as a possible explanation , and the one that makes the most sense . 
  it 's very unlikely because we do n't have that many satellites and we have even less that intersect the iss orbit . ),

  i was hoping someone would write `` 999999 '' . 
  should n't that be `` left to right '' ? 
  or if you are saying things backwards , that might indicate that you yourself are backwards , and so the text might seem actually left to right to you , coming out as `` right to left '' ... but probably it was only meant to be an inversion of the text , rather than yourself . 
  `` well , the important thing is you 've found a way to feel superior to both . '',

  i think it 's one of the few things that actually follow sturgeon 's law . 
  it has initials rather than a name , which makes it more scary . 
  but , really , the positive ion is sodium , which you know from salt , and the other half is glutamate , which is one of the twenty amino acids your body uses to make proteins . 
  your body produces glutamate for you , though , so you ca n't say it supplies an essential nutrient . 
  i am a protein engineer , so the stigma of this compound especially disappoints me . 
  i use glutamate all the time to build tools that are perfectly edible and are meant to go in people 's bodies . 
  the funniest part , however , is that to make it sound bad , you can say that glutamate is in both ricin * and * botulinum toxin , two of the deadliest poisons on earth !,

  try using it instead of salt where you would use salt . 
  then you will understand the general principle of when it 's effective . 
  it gives things a `` savory '' taste similar to salt . 
  in principle , lots of salts taste roughly the same , i.e. 
  like table salt , and msg is one .

  which end do you mean ? 
   mfw i have linux and no mods, 
  i am pretty much the worst ksp user , are n't i ? 
  the way i usually do especially fast cars is that i put engines on them that provide downwards thrust . 
  this ensures that they do not go into orbit , smash hard against the ground , etc. 
  there 's something really surreal and aesthetically pleasing in seeing your dropped stages float up and away behind you , because they 're at escape velocity . 
  then again these cars generally do n't work so well on kerbin , which has that annoying atmosphere .

  i guess this one does n't have wheels or skids , does it ? 
  it would be extremely useful for rendezvous . 
  the problem is if they make it too easy to use one view or another , one view might become redundant .
