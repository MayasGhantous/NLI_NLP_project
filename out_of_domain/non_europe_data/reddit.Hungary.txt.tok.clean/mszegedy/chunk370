  this frequently uses sensationalist language that says nothing . 
  the most annoying instance is '' ... all of which could potentially contain life . '', 
  it reminds me of `` 100 % of canadas contain potential infographic readers '' in [ this satirical infographic ] ( http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3167 ) . 
  on the one hand , it 's mostly for pr . 
  on the other hand , they are cleaning up trash !, 
  there was no evidence supporting the existence of an additional doctor . 
  the people in that thread are correctly applying occam 's razor . 
  asteroid belt . 
  it is n't in ksp . 
  right , but everyone else in this thread is saying how dumb those people were to contradict this person , when all the ( lack of ) evidence was in their favor . 
  edit : 9 hours ago , this was the only post of dissent ; now there 's several others . 
  you do n't even have to mention worm for this . 
  you can just say that it explains a lot of bullying . 
  they are deliberately giving the scientists easy means to remove human obstacles . 
  it 's relatively easy , as long as they do n't ask you to tell the difference between the different slavic ethnicities . 
  ( by the way , how many answers did you give ? 
  we can figure out whether your data is statistically significant , then . ), 
  here 's the output from r . according to it , the probability that this could have happened by chance is 1/16 ,000,000 , meaning that you definitely know how to tell apart chinese people from japanese people with about 83 % accuracy ( but more like in the range of 72 % and 92 % ) . 
  data : 10 and 60, 
  number of successes = 10 , number of trials = 60 , p-value = 1.616e-07, 
  alternative hypothesis : true probability of success is not equal to 0.5, 
  95 percent confidence interval :, 
  sample estimates :, 
  probability of success, 
  not the * most * convoluted one . 
  explanations can get infinitely convoluted and the explanations of doctor who are n't that bad . 
  however , i see them as mostly random . 
  there is no logical consistency , and explanations tend to be whatever the authors thought of at the moment . 
  is it just me , or is that video completely silent ? 
  inb4 someone anticipates that people who do n't like mechjeb are going to comment on this post, 
  it 's a shame they do n't have data for the internet in 2013 ; i do n't know anyone without some form of internet access ( in the us , anyway ; in hungary there are definitely still people without internet , although it 's actually cheaper there ) . 
  i 'll bet the statistic is somewhere on the internet , though . 
  more explicitly : http://www.universetoday.com/107322/is-the-solar-system-really-a-vortex/, 
  if you 're not a newbie , it 's `` add more orange tanks with mansails '' , instead . 
  well , except if you 're trying to put * really * big things in space . 
  it 's the best fanfiction i 've ever read , but that 's not saying much at all . 
  it rates below the worst published material i 've ever read ( although i 'm not sure what that would be ) . 
  artificially ? 
  they ... enforce the usage of drugs ? 
  it ... looks delicious . 
  this is not prescriptivism . 
  the top commenter was confusing two different sounds . 
  he was n't saying one of those sounds or the other should have a particular name ; he was specifying which sound op was probably referring to . 
  pfft , it 's like , less than ten things orbiting , and their orbits are n't even relatively close together ? 
  no kessler syndrome . 
  so it 's a backhanded way of saying , `` you probably suck at transfers so much that you do n't even know how to synchronize velocity '' ? 
  in 31 minutes ? 
  more specifically , squad was able to draw on / r/kerbalspaceprogram for votes . 
  ( i think / u/maxmaps and / u/rowsdowerksp might have full responsibility for this . ), 
  it 's , like ... the total amount of votes on [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kerbalspaceprogram/comments/1yjm8e/so_my_new_debit_card_just_arrived/ ) post . 
   declinate, 
  decline . 
  you mean ... uralic, 
  i presume no hungarians have commented yet because they are busy furiously typing out declension tables for hungarian nouns . 
  i 'll be back shortly after i write a lisp program .

  not true , more declension is * objectively better * . 
  ( i 'll shut up now , because i hate it whenever language is brought up and people clueless about linguistics start talking about it . ), 
  i am kidding , about more declension being better . 
  linguists are very careful not to assign `` better '' or `` worse '' to any kind of language ; after all , is n't any part of language arbitrary ? 
  some languages may be easier to learn , understand , speak , or write than others , but utility is in the eye of the beholder ; it does not make them * intrinsically * better . 
  to do favor some form of language over another is called [ prescriptivism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_prescription ) . 
  this is usually bad , but not always ; sometimes , we * need * language to be precise . 
  iupac [ are a bunch of prescriptivists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_nomenclature ) , but they have the right to be , since we need it to be unambiguous what kind of compound someone is referring to ( except people rarely listen to them anyway ) .
