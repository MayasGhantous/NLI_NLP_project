  it makes perfect sense if you 're accustomed to polish notation , and you have syntax highlighting . 
  a lot of them are quite fishy/wrong . 
  i just could n't bear to make the program any more complicated . 
  stupid edge cases . 
  ( the worst offender is `` kuty\u00e1jaik '' in the nominative . ), 
  edit : which has now been taken care of . 
  well , hungarian is agglutinative , i.e. 
  it works by sticking one or none of each different kind of part on it , one after another . 
  functional lamguages work by passing data from one function to another , each of which modifies the data in some way . 
  do you see how the first one is a specific case of the second one ? 
  it helps , i think , but i do n't know how much . 
  yeah . 
  i worked on this for about an hour , and i still could n't get all the stupid edge cases , so eventually i put up a mostly-correct version . 
  you 're totally right about '' - ul '' ; that is a missed opportunity . 
  '' - stol '' is , i guess , also another , although i only just now realized that it 's not from `` kuty\u00e1s '' ( which would constitute a derived adjective , imo ) . 
  edit : turns out `` stol '' can not be applied to the possessives . 
  i did make a mistake with `` al\u00e1 '' ; the sublative was entered on wikipedia , but now i realize that that 's because we have it in our pronouns . 
  yes !, 
  to be fair , we do , however , have postpositions . 
  how ever did you arrive at that number ? 
  i 'm not even sure if our nouns have 1176 * forms * . 
  edit : if you do n't count derived adjectives and stuff like that , they have about 250 forms . 
  blah , constructed languages do n't count . 
  once i constructed a language with 7 ^ 3 cases . 
  is it especially great ? 
  nope . 
  ( note to mobile users : that is seven cubed , not seventy-three . ), 
  every time you use circles to represent data , somewhere out there , an edward tufte starts hiccuping . 
  ( but congratulations anyway , this is a great comic ! ), 
  that 's the sad truth , i guess . 
  but this is wrapped to 80 characters in length ; i wonder how much better it would look unwrapped . 
  gay water for gay thinking !, 
  it is always funny to watch tourists and hungarian learners say `` meleg vagyok '' instead of `` melegem van '' . 
  you could always buy a practice mute . 
  what does her being bad at hosting have to do with her being female ? 
  we only have one irregular verb , the verb `` to be '' . 
  agglutinative languages tend to have few/no irregularity , since if the morphology changes , it will change for * all * the words . 
  iirc turkish has no irregular verbs , and neither does russian or something ? 
  we have some irregularity in our pronouns . 
  certain things that would usually be expressed with postpositions become additional cases : `` a kutya alatt '' means `` underneath the dog '' , whereas `` alattam '' means `` underneath me '' . 
  `` a kutya al\u00e1 '' means '' [ to ] under the dog '' , whereas `` al\u00e1m '' means '' [ to ] under me '' . 
  a certain subclass of nouns have a root slightly different from their nominative non-possessed singular : `` sz\u00f3 '' means `` word '' , but rather than `` sz\u00f3k '' for `` words '' like you would expect , it is `` szavak '' , and the accusative as well is , rather than `` sz\u00f3t '' , `` szavat '' , and so on . 
  but `` with [ a ] word '' is still `` sz\u00f3val '' and `` to/for a word '' is still `` sz\u00f3nak '' , * but * `` with words '' is `` szavakkal '' rather than `` sz\u00f3kkal '' . 
  other than that it 's all straightforward . 
  great scott !, 
  he did . 
  because that 's how the reaction happens . 
  even if it * were * pure hydrogen inside the balloon , it would only explode because it mixes with the surrounding air . 
  it 's true !, 
  it 's , like , a whole * continent * of people , and they can not into alcohol dehydrogenase diversity or rhesus factors . 
  this is why you can not donate blood to asian people , and why they get alcohol flush syndrome or whatever sometimes . 
  even ignoring quantum data storage at all , with drexler 's rod-based nano-storage mechanism ( first proposed in his dissertation ; [ it 's in like chapter 12 or so ] ( http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/nanosystems/toc.html ) ) , you can store 1 bit per 40 nm ^ ( 3 ) . 
  that amounts to an [ abominably small amount of space ] ( http://wolfr.am/1pqtcf6 ) ; 100 pb is about the volume of 40 fully-grown * e. coli * bacteria , and that 's counting a pb as a pebibyte rather than a metric petabyte . 
  the question is , really , why can he store so little ? 
  extreme redundancy , i guess . 
  also , exabyte of traffic just means we download an exabyte per month . 
  that is mostly the same information , over and over again ; how many people have seen breaking bad on netflix ? 
  it takes up only a few 100 gb for them , but hundreds of thousands ( millions ? ), 
  of times that in bandwidth . 
  you do get the reaction , just there 's a much smaller fraction of molecules that participate . 
  really it 's `` hydrogen + oxygen + temperature '' , but temperature is required for pretty much any reaction ; it 's just a matter of how much makes the reaction noticeable enough to `` count '' . 
  lots of reactions can occur very fast at room temperature , lots of reactions need a temperature much higher than room temperature to become notable , and lots of reactions have temperatures so low that you can not find the compounds unreacted at room temperature ; e.g. , fluorine bonding to stuff . 
  reactions actually have particular enthalpies at which they happen , i.e. 
  the particular amount of heat molecules have to have to react , but if you have a large number of molecules together , they do not all have the same amount of heat ; there will always be a few with energies high enough for the reaction to occur . 
  increasing the temperature just makes that amount higher . 
  having a shield only in the front ( and , proposedly , back ) is realistic ? 
  you need to shield the whole thing !, 
  radiation comes from all sides . 
  but , we can assume all kerbal parts are already radiation-resistant . 
  my god , why did you burn those nukes on the way up ? 
  they provide , like , no thrust at all . 
  if you 're going to use them , use them for the circ burn , but ideally do n't use them at all . 
  ( n ) edgy ( n ^ ( n ) ) me, 
  this thread has been immortalized in the tops ; people are going to keep commenting on it for a long time . 
  also , inb4 ( n ) edgy ( n ! ^ ( n !, 
  cousin !, 
  i 'm a phd candidate in biomedical engineering as well , and i 'm studying ways to make graphene nanoparticles with proteins ( which would hopefully lead to the creation of more complex machinery ) . 
  i 'm not very far along , so this may change , but for the moment i 'm doing sheets . 
  have n't heard of it !, 
  please explain ? 
  unfortunately , you never asked about mine : as a small child , i was quite a hipster , at least with respect to music . 
  and i heard that smart people listen to classical music . 
  so ... hindsight bias ? 
  what do the letters mean ? 
  which ones are good , and which ones are bad ? 
  yes afaik, 
  seychelles , or singapore . 
  i doubt the seychelles actually has any biotech conferences , ever . 
  oh god , and the html is all one big blob . 
  it is like ioccc for webdev . 
  blah blah everyone should just speak tamil/korean/sanskrit / polish/turkish/finnish / fula , because obviously the merit of a language is determined by its orthographic consistency with respect to phonology , or grammatic symmetry , or the amount of ways you can conjugate a verb , or the amount of noun classes . 
  well , have you met one ? 
  you can provide evidence against it , but there 's always the minuscule chance that your equipment is lying , you just got * that * lucky with random statistical variation , etc. 
  a trivial amount of data gathering will bring the probability above any reasonable doubt that it 's 1/r ^ 2 , but it 's not `` proving '' it in the mathematical sense that it 's a certainty , with a p-value of 0 . 
  with things that are so easily empirically tested as gravity , it 's not worth making the distinction , but it gets extremely annoying when people use the word `` prove '' to mean `` find/is evidence that supports '' in contexts where the evidence is not strong enough to effectively completely rule out alternative hypotheses . 
  i do n't think it 's laymen not realizing what a word means , either ; i think it 's laymen not being very good at bayesian thinking . 
  i think , to them , it actually feels like proving it , in the mathematical , p = 0 sense . 
  we should endeavor to raise awareness of this problem , and train people to say `` supports '' instead of `` proves '' , even in trivial cases like this , so that they recognize evidence for what it is . 
  for the millionth time , people who compile these lists : # 2 is legitimate !, 
  sapir-whorf , all over the place .
