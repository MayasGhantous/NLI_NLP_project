  thank you for making me aware of this book . 
  i ordered it just now . 
  but asteroids are n't on rails , unlike planets and moons . 
  you can tug them to places , and land them on bodies . 
  that was only the first year for them to come out !, 
  ( there * were * other bionicle-like sets before them , though . 
  i own several slizers and two roboriders . ), 
  but going from word to latex felt so great . 
  and making different markup languages that compile to latex was really helpful , too . 
  those are both weak evidence that wysiwym is better . 
  it would have to be some sort of series that converges extremely fast relative to the old arctangent way of doing it , or else it 's quite useless ; also , the terms would get real huge real fast . 
  / r/counting , guys, 
  yes , that makes sense !, 
  `` match up derivatives of e ^ x to get e ^ ( x ) '', 
   us flair, 
  there is the answer . 
  voicing of the dental fricative is not critical in the english language , since it is already spelled the same either way anyway . 
  are you sure ?

  we * foster * stereotypes on this sub . 
  it would n't be fun without them . 
  it 's the whole reason why flair is mandatory . 
  no , but all the best science is published !, 
  it 's only hard if you 're not used to solving puzzles !, 
  and if you do n't try and find every last one of those damn pink cubes . 
  what about saturn and all the exoplanets ? 
  is it even possible to read the blue text ? 
  the color and font make it illegible on its own . 
   literally no one writes the 1 in the denominator of anything . 
  except when you have a sequence where you divide by k somewhere and k happens to be 1 . 
  but this is not one of those times . 
  edit : actually , as a general principle , when you have some sort of expression with n in it , and something is being divided by n , and you want to show the specific case with n = 1 . 
  he was probably joking . 
  what is it about tilt-shift photography that makes things seem small ? 
  is it that our eyes have a very small dof when we watch things up close , and so we associate small dofs with things being close ? 
  if you made the image sharp all around , would it look the right size again ? 
  is this your first encounter with medium.com ? 
  i 've been seeing it everywhere in the past couple of months . 
  and by `` everywhere '' i mean / r/programming . 
  here 's an engine-level one : http://docs.unity3d.com/documentation/components/script-tiltshift.html, 
  there can also be books in that room, 
  it 's not new . 
  lampshading has been lampshaded since forever ; the most recent example that comes to mind that is n't this is [ order of the stick ] ( http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0546.html ) . 
  it 's circular gallifreyan , a conscript for english . 
  i 'm sad whenever it is used as the de facto conlang for gallifreyan , because [ i made a perfectly serviceable outline of an actual conlang for it back in 2011 . 
  thank god , i thought i 've been doing it wrong all this time . 
  it does n't really matter , especially when everybody remembers [ addictinggames ] ( http://addictinggames.com ) . 
  it looked like mario flew away in the beginning ? 
  i think the house is like spikes , except it launches . 
  abacaxi , is n't it ? 
  what os do you have ? 
  is it possible you have accidentally selected an application-specific keyboard for chrome that makes these characters ? 
  edit : do you have any extensions installed that mess with the keyboard at all ? 
  try deactivating just one at a time .

  context : finland has six parties , at odds with each other .

  markov chains do not necessarily produce from whole foods is entirely organic . 
  i just use ( and { , because programmer dvorak master race ( until i find the time to implement chorded typing using clx ) . 
  common lisp xlib !, 
  google around , there 's even window managers written using it . 
  hey bby u want sum uyl, 
  the true finns are pro-nuclear . 
  i want to make it so that i can use my fn key or one of the f < int  keys to cycle between my regular programmer dvorak layout , a chorded layout , and qwerty ( for guests ) . 
  the chorded layout would use 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , c , and v as its actual typing keys , with many of the keys on the right being bound to modifiers ( most of which would allow me to type characters not normally found on one 's keyboard ) . 
  qewasd would be bound to qewasd , because then the layout would be convenient for playing kerbal space program . 
  ( having a toggleable modifier key that binds them to hnijkl instead would be convenient as well . ),

  there need to be more comics about it . 
  ( that being said ... 
  i do have a comic of it i have n't posted ), 
  i do n't see why it would be powered by windows 95 . 
  everybody knows that the only operating system anyone uses is windows xp . 
  thank you for the suggestion , but i see this as an opportunity to learn xlib ( albeit a sugary lisp version of it ) , and also i 'm not comfortable without the level of control that clx offers me . 
  heheheh we 'll see how it turns out . 
  xlib is a huge pain in the ass !, 
   cccp rhymes with `` me '', 
  ... that better not be for the reason why it probably is . 
  i was getting tired of it too , but we ca n't just * not * post this comic when it 's so topical !, 
  unless there 's a / r/chemistrymeta or something .

  why do you always use fixed-width modern serif fonts for your comics ? 
  it looks really bad !, 
  ( but brilliant comic otherwise , we need to do more with physics-related visual puns ), 
  you mean base ( sqrt ( 5761 ) -1 ) / 8 . 
  edit : actually , ( sqrt ( 2129 ) -27 ) / 2 . 
  whatever happened to occam 's razor , in the case that we ca n't empirically verify the hypothesis ? 
  it may be useful as a heuristic , but if you 're given a bag of hypotheses that you ca n't test , then you should go with the simplest one ( that can still explain the data ) .
