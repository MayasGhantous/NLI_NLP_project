  sometimes arguably more so . 
  you 'd think that saying `` subliminal '' after it would cancel the effect , but [ semantic priming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/priming_%28psychology%29 ) works even if you know it 's happening . 
  and if you tell people something is `` subliminal '' , then it encourages them to go back and read it again and again . 
  i can think of at least two reasons why it fits :, 
  - parents stereotypically have mustaches , and lususes are parents, 
  - equius 's lusus has a mustache and is one of the most prominent lususes in the comic, 
  * i 'm * a diver and interested ... 
  who is blue ? 
  i 'd think it 's the ottomans , but their flag was red . 
  my second guess would be the mongols , but their flag was triangular and serrated . 
  that 's not even the main issue . 
  the posts are usually just stupid . 
  ( format nil '' ~ : r '' ( + ( length comments ) 1 ) ), 
  besides using trains and metro to get around amsterdam , the one experience i had with dutch trains was taking a high-speed train from the netherlands through belgium to france . 
  it was a really great experience and i was happy with it . 
  looks really tasty to me too , and i think it 's because if you live in the us for a while anything with french fries starts to look tasty ... 
  the turkey should be shared also by peru and india . 
  in bioinformatics we solved this problem by having dedicated tools written by dedicated software engineers . 
  after that , the only code we have to write is batch scripts , which are really difficult to mess up at so high a level . 
  did he get to graduate ? 
  so , you ca n't express things that are n't insults by virtue of the language not having an indicative mood ( or any other mood that might be used for that ) ? 
  it 's p-type, 
   i only ran it on the first 1000 lines because i 'm running on an amd athlon at 1ghz, 
  holy shit , you can access the internet from the future ? 
  you 've heard about 9/11/01 , right ? 
  ( and in case it is n't obvious , the turn of the millennium wo n't coincide with an apocalypse ), 
  edit : invest in apple !, 
  what i have n't seen mentioned in this thread yet is the fact that the room of requirement seems to be not much more than a powerful transfiguration engine in-canon . 
  for example , it can not create food in-canon because it 's prohibited by the laws of transfiguration . 
  you mean fridge brilliance, 
  they seem kinda outta character . 
  oh well , it was bound to happen with a comic with so many authors, 
  being able to take credit for having done something first is your only concrete reward for your work . 
  if he invests in bitcoin too early , he might inflate the currency and cause its doom . 
  not gon na advise that . 
  i wish it would be that every plaintext file corresponds to a single unique patent ; that would be the best . 
  but this is great too !, 
  nlp is fun . 
  they seem kinda outta character . 
  oh well , it was bound to happen with a comic with so many authors, 
  i 'd say `` in-character '' is behavior consistent with their behavior in the original comic itself . 
  it 's not meaningful to include fanworks in that definition because most readers have n't read fanworks extensively ( the most common fan probably has n't read any at all ) , and so they did not influence their expectations for how the characters should act . 
  this depends on the audience , though . 
  if the paradox space readers consisted mainly of people who had absorbed fanfics , then the behavior of the characters in those fanfics would become relevant and meaningful . 
  well , not quite . 
  they are placed in particular spots . 
  and the go board is a lot huger than a chessboard : a chessboard starts out half full and is 8x8 , whereas a go board starts out empty and is 19x19 ( unless you 're playing a miniature game in which case it 's smaller ) . 
  yes , it is a huge head start , but not obviously ; not when given those things plus the fact that it 's possible to capture large amounts of pieces at once in go . 
  or a flint/steel, 
  technically , he already has !, 
  but ... the comic is sympathetic to us . 
  if anything there might be butthurt from the other countries in the comic . 
  use north rhine-westphalia !, 
  huh , it 's been a while since i 've heard it referred to as `` eternity 's shylock '' ... 
  wo n't the committee that administers the exam nullify your exam if you try and reconstruct it/otherwise talk about it ? 
  if you can get the iq low enough , you can cut them down for meat ethically as well !, 
  when i saw that website , i thought , `` what a good example of the look-elsewhere effect , '' and then stopped thinking about it . 
  different statistical phenomenon , same negative psychological procedure . 
  that 's oversimplifying by a lot , and you know it . 
  ( on the other hand , the other guy is far more wrong than you are . ), 
  or the lack of oxygen in the dead zone . 
  for that matter , that abyss was n't very deep . 
  dammit , you had a really great opportunity to make the comic self-referential and you did n't . 
  i do n't care that the aspect ratio of the comic is too low to sanely put into the panel , you should have messed with the layout until you made it work !, 
  by the way , really * really * great work on the art in this comic . 
  and p\u00e1linka . 
  if you use a password made out of words , then a dictionary attack will still catch it . 
  not just dna polymerase . 
  topoisomerase , helicase , and two polymerases . 
  i do n't understand why it contracts . 
  i buy the molecular mechanics explanation , but from a `` basic physics '' standpoint i do n't get it . 
  you store energy in a rubber band by stretching it out . 
  the more you stretch it out , the more energy you store in it . 
  so , you 'd expect that when you add thermal energy to it , it would get added to the existing bank of energy and stretch the band even more ... but i guess that would violate the second law of thermodynamics ; you 'd be converting thermal energy into useful work . 
  what discipline ( s ) are you implicitly mentioning that * do ( es ) n't * require more than partying ? 
  i 'd have wanted to go into cs , except everybody was complaining about how soul-crushing the jobs are . 
  at least being a grad student is ( surprisingly ) fulfilling . 
  edit : actually , in hindsight these comments piss me off more than i originally thought . 
  how full of yourself do you have to be to put down other fields in such a patronizing way in * / r/compsci ? 
  * you could look anywhere you want among other fields and find people working hard to do well in their chosen field , studying , learning , pursuing the field outside of the established curriculum , etc. 
  but instead you see an article that documents a trend stemming from ** a ) ** & nbsp ; lack of awareness and ** b ) ** & nbsp ; natural variation in people 's interests and imply that everyone else are idiots . 
  it 's not easy to get a rise out of me , but blind elitism will do that . 
  maybe it was just a joke and it 's gone over my head , but if not - get fucked . 
  that 's * awesome * . 
  i guess it ca n't exactly float , can it ? 
  what does it look like with mercury ? 
  does that just go straight to the bottom ? 
  yes , but programmers complain that their job is * uniquely * terrible in a particular way , similar to how mathematicians complain about how their field is * uniquely * badly taught ; and the mathematicians , at least , are right . 
  the problem with this thread is n't that people think cs is more important than other field , but that they think that the main reason people do n't do cs is because they are * stupid * . 
  this is a sense-crushingly egocentric viewpoint . 
  their pretentiousness manages to offend literally everyone else : `` you 're not in cs ? 
  yeah , ` cuz you 're an * idiot . 
  * '' never mind that there 's piles and piles of other fields to choose from and * yes , in fact they do do actual work . 
  * never mind that most people have n't even experienced what it 's like to program !, 
  no , that must not be it , because then they ca n't pat themselves on their backs !, 
  i wonder when their * respect for other people * will grow in . 
  cs is hard , but :, 
  - cs being hard is simply * not * the reason that people do n't go into it . 
  it has to do with the fact that if you know what it does all , you 're probably already going into cs anyway . 
  other engineering and science fields constantly complain about a lack of programmers , and the programmers they * do * have are generally the kind that learned it after they got their bachelor 's .
