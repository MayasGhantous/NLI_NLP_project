  thinking that this is because they simply were n't * smart * enough to be programmers earlier is delusional . 
  awareness is getting better , more people are becoming interested in programming than ever before , but they 're still a tiny fraction of the people that could potentially become a cs major . 
  - the people in this thread are acting like cs is the * only * major that 's hard . 
  you said so yourself , other engineering majors are as hard and some even more so . 
  ( my personal pick for hardest major , from secondhand experience , is physics , though , not an engineering major . ), 
  the existence of even * one * other hard major would drastically reduce the prior probability of someone going to cs given that they are smart enough to do so ; there is no way to justify figuring that with such a wealth of other challenging majors , the * obvious * reason that people did n't pick cs is because they were n't smart enough . 
  - conscientiousness is * at least * as important as intelligence with respect to how well one does at anything whatsoever . 
  you do n't even * need * to be too smart to take cs or any other hard major , as long as you can compensate by working harder . 
  hell , moderately intelligent hard workers might even comprise the majority of existing cs students !, 
  it sure seems to be the case elsewhere . 
  it 's a * hard * major , not necessarily an extremely intellectually challenging one . 
  ( and anyway , on this sub it can be understood better than anywhere else that no matter how crappy your processor is , it 'll eventually solve your problem assuming you have enough space . ), 
  - people who can put up with hard courses are n't localized to particular sets of majors at all . 
  i 've known hard workers who take things seriously and excel at academics from every major that i 've known people from who ca n't keep up with work . 
  even if the majors differ in difficulty , what you do in college ends up being a lot more a function of your personality than your major . 
  and hahahahaha high school seriously ? 
  because i do n't like it if people think they 're more intelligent than other people for stupid reasons ? 
  ca n't you at least tell from how offended i am that i 'm a person who did n't major in cs ? 
  ( i 'm a grad student , in biomedical engineering . 
  i majored in biochemistry . ), 
   ouch , my apologies . 
  i tried to play detective , and it failed badly . 
  i saw that you were a mod for / r/im14andthisismeta , and you just said that you were planning on applying for cs at one time . 
   also , you asked someone in this thread what other majors would n't require partying on the weekends to succeed in besides cs , which i thought was perhaps the naivete of a youth . 
   hence , i assumed that you were a high school student . 
  no big deal !, 
  you misunderstood my other comment , though . 
  i meant to ask what majors they are talking about that you * only * need to party for and never do any work for . 
  they exist , but again this was in a context that made cs sound like some special snowflake for actually requiring work . 
  ( and , / r/im14andthisismeta is another subreddit meant to mock people for having a narrow perspective on things ; it 's kin to / r/im14andthisisfunny , / r/im14andthisiswtf , / r/im14andthisisdeep , etc. 
  i 'm kind of sad it never took off , but a movement to make parts of geb required reading in schools would probably do more good ), 
  i do n't have a problem with anything you 're saying ; it 's all true , and people switching majors because it 's too hard or because they do n't like the work * is * a real phenomenon that happens . 
  but that 's not the bulk of the selection process ; it 's just the thing that people are most familiar with , because they see it firsthand . 
  most of the real selection happens in high school or even earlier , when people are exposed to different fields and different * opinions * about the fields . 
  but that 's not something that people see , because it 's slow and private . 
  you 're not the problem with this thread . 
  neither are comments such as [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/25n78q/american_college_students_arent_flocking_to/chitasm ) ; they are innocent victims of cognitive bias . 
  but comments like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/25n78q/american_college_students_arent_flocking_to/chixmxa ) , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/25n78q/american_college_students_arent_flocking_to/chj0z4z ) , and especially [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/25n78q/american_college_students_arent_flocking_to/chj37ex ) are taking it too far . 
  these people really should have thought about exactly who they 're dismissing before doing so . 
  they do n't actually deserve an angry rant , but seriously , how did they end up with such an attitude ? 
  i guess , culturally , somewhere down the line , cs acquired elitism . 
  that 's really bad and it cheeses me off , a lot . 
  i will be unimpressed if it 's easier to learn than navajo . 
  i look forward to what you can come up with !, 
  nah , osv is equally as difficult to learn as svo , sov , vso , vos , etc. 
  i do n't think you should just try and make it as different from english as possible ; that does n't necessarily make it hard to learn . 
  you need to make it complex , and physically difficult to pronounce . 
  for example , come up with a long , elaborate system of rules for word order , rather than osv . 
  what units ? 
  i guess i 'll go check ... 
  sorry , it was just similar in celsius to what everyone else was posting in the thread , and it seemed so unbelievable as a fahrenheit value . 
  what , you * care * about this stuff ? 
  ... aww , thanks !, 
  with * limbs ? 
  wings are limbs . 
  only because it would invalidate one of my favorite comics ever , the un fairy !, 
  although , those might have been insect wings , which are not homologous . 
  gypsies , obviously . 
  it 's part of the universal language for regexes . 
  yes , it 's part of sed syntax , but it 's not * for * sed syntax , if you see what i mean . 
  lots of other things use it , too . 
  ( `` universal language for regexes '' is , unsurprisingly but nevertheless sadly , kind of a misnomer . 
  regex language varies a little from implementation to implementation ; for example , in vim it 's case-insensitive , and a lot of characters , like + es and ( ) es , have to be escaped using a backslash to get their non-literal meaning , unlike most other places . 
  but s / / / g and s / / / are both truly universal afaik . ), 
  op understands reddit great . 
  this post is very typical for / r/pics . 
  what 's weird about it ? 
  reddit does n't always like the op , and the op does n't always suffer a total breakdown because of that . 
  no way . 
  reddit would be a bunch of people dumped into a really deep pit , groping at each other to get around . 
  new people get added to the pit when insane people view the pit from the top and think `` this looks fun '' and jump in . 
  in fact , the [ jerrycan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerrycan ) , known as the wehrmacht-einheitskanister , was one of the biggest advantages germany had in wwii . 
  robust , stored lots of liquid , easy to store , cooled quickly , had a built-in spout , easy to seal , easy to carry . 
  britain 's stupid leaky canisters , on the other hand , were responsible for the loss of up to 25 % of britain 's fuel . 
  once they found jerrycans , they were quick to copy them . 
  i 'm guessing you 're from the philippines ? 
  but , then , why do you have a scottish flair ? 
  ah , i 'm afraid this will go over many people 's heads . 
  too bad , it 's a good comic !, 
  i wish there would have been some way to show drc sawing off * hands * in particular ( although that would have been anachronistic ) . 
  maybe put a pair of bloody hands on the other side of drc ? 
  two languages : english and spanish . 
  once , i was visiting an elementary school in the us , and i was talking with my sister in hungarian , and one of the kids smartly told the other , `` they 're speaking spanish . '', 
  he seems to know a lot about ai already , though ; it 's certainly on his mind a lot , what with him knowing about the details of early ai research , and comparing other things to it ( he used it as an example of the planning fallacy as early as ch 6 ) . 
  the bloody baron had a romantic relationship with rowena ravenclaw 's daughter in the original canon . 
  although this gives no insight into what harry himself knows , i 'm certain the most fundamental reason for him not mentioning such a thing is because ey wanted to make a fanfic promoting rationality , not the idea of an intelligence explosion ( which could be , and is many times over , an entire work of fiction on its own ) . 
  [ here 's one . 
  ] ( http://qntm.org/hell ) be warned , it was written fast , so it 's not as coherent as it could be . 
  you could accumulate it onto your wand , like deposition . 
  a fan ? 
  can you comment on the significance of the sporadic usage of african american vernacular language throughout the song ? 
  i 'd especially like to hear how you perceive the contrast of its absence in the hook versus its presence in the rest of the song relates to your interpretation of the song . 
  the original phrase was `` i swear on me nan i 'll stab you in the tesco , '' i.e. 
  he 's swearing on his grandmother that he 'll stab the person in the tesco . 
  it was switched around as a joke here . 
  you can use layering in gimp , too . 
  the only reason to pirate photoshop is the indispensable photo manipulation things like the healing brush , patch tool , and most recently , the content-aware fill ( oh my god i love that one so much ) . 
  for * de novo * image creation , though , use gimp !, 
  the advantage is that you can quickly download and run it on anything/everything , so you will never be without a familiar tool . 
  hmm , now i see why i am outmatched in comic output by other people .
