  when i was speaking of the point of religion , i meant more this : is n't it a nice thought , though , that god loved us * so * much , that he sent his * only * son down to die for us ? 
  i like it so much , that i 've decided to believe in it . 
  i like a lot of the rest of christian religious material , though , and some of it teaches very good ideals . 
  there are a lot of good examples to take from it ( like the ones of philanthropy , and the ones of hospitality ) , and i identify with it . 
  i have n't tried sharing it yet , but i think the bible is worth a read , particularly the parts toward the beginning and end . 
  i do n't think the ark of the covenant held in ethiopia is the real thing ; in fact , i think it 's radioactive , and mount sinai was as well ( which would make it the real thing , but i 'm okay with that as well ) . 
  i think most of the ten commandments are good rules to follow , although some are a bit outdated ( relatedly , i think some of the 613 mitzvot are very outdated ) . 
  i 'm not in this for the doctrine , i 'm in this for the stories and ideas . 
  i think it 's all very wonderful , and that a lot of people misapply it . 
  i have succeeded in loving everyone , just like christians are supposed to . 
  i do n't know how i feel about significant historical villains such as hitler ; i 'd have to meet them to find out . 
  i 'm bad at being christian , and if there is a christian hell , then i might be headed there ; if not , then purgatory , if that 's your thing . 
  or maybe there 's no life after death , and this is the only life we 've got . 
  i 'm fine with that as well ; i 'm going to try to prolong and enjoy it as much as i can . 
  but i 'm going to spend the whole thing believing in jesus , because i like it . 
  what about guided evolution ? 
  because that 's what i believe in . 
  i 'm reposting this . 
  wait , what about the one about constitutions being torn down every so many years ? 
  or is that one of the two ? 
  or someone else entirely ? 
  wow , you know your content !, 
  thank you for this ; i 'd never have known it otherwise . 
  hyphens : -,

  i hope i 've made your day more informative !, 
  oh gog , i remember all those literary theorists from before the seventh book came out discussing how he was similar to jesus in this way and that , and they predicted exactly that ... it was really annoying . 
  have you read harry potter and the methods of rationality ? 
  you 'll like it . 
  read as much as possible . 
  one of the five exceptions to gamp 's law of transfiguration : food . 
  an ipa rendering for y' all : [ \u2198 ' \u0294\u00e6\u02e7\u027b\u02d0\u02cci\u02d0\u02e8 ] as opposed to [ ` h\u00e6\u0279\u02d0\u02cci\u02d0 ] \\* holy shit this took ages to do on the iphone *, 
  edit : haha , i forgot a suprasegmental , i 'm such a worthless linguist, 
  oh yes , i am very far away from having proper background knowledge . 
  :( but i know what i 've heard , and how to apply it !, 
  actually i 've already come up with the beginning of the third movement . 
  and yeah , i know about basso continuo . 
  d : i was thinking i 'll just annotate it normally ; i 'd hate to have to learn it just for this . 
  ( my sister knows it ; she can always transcribe it for me . ), 
  i think having the harpsichord is what would really make the piece complete . 
  also , if they did n't have cellos , then what 's [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a784dxwiwki&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) ? 
  but i digress . 
  i think i 'll stick with the cello , then , in hopes that someone will actually be able to play the thing . 
  ( although i know someone who actually owns and plays a viola da gamba . 
  pretty ! ), 
  at our church , the traditional order of paschal greetings is : christos voskrese ! / voistinnu voskrese !, 
  that is , in order : old church slavonic , greek , hungarian , arabic . 
  no english to be found anywhere !, 
  most of our population is slavic . 
  our priest does the hungarian just for us . 
  while i think the blog post itself is good content , this is a shameless plug at a blog . 
  that 's not an acceptable thing . 
  yes . 
  thanks !, 
  so , i will continue to write this ( because i like doing it ) , but without basso continuo notation ( which you 're right about with respect to that i should learn sometime ) . 
  i 've analyzed some more vivaldi , and i believe i can compose for the entire quartet and harpsichord properly now . 
  it 's true that i have comparatively little formal education on the matter ( absolutely nil in period composition ; just one college-level introductory course in general music theory ) . 
  i do n't really know any formal `` rules '' that the composers of that time had to follow ; i guess it 's not really similar to poetry , where they are strict and clear-cut ( use * this * meter , * this * rhyme scheme , and * this * form ! ) . 
  unless i 'm wrong , in which case feel free to tell me about them . 
  ( i love rules ; they narrow down the possibilities . 
  coming from the son of a computer scientist who currently specializes in problem theory , i guess this is n't very surprising , is it . ), 
  i like quantifying music , because it makes things more objective , and easier to handle . 
  i understand terms like `` development '' and `` sequence '' as well , but i prefer things like `` fifths '' and `` contour '' . 
  but i know what sounds good , and what sorts of melodies i can draw out of my brain . 
  and i think it will be those that make the piece . 
  lol fenoius, 
  i always get excited when you can see the rings . 
  this one has color , and detail , too !, 
  this is perfect beyond description . 
  makes predictions with alarming accuracy !, 
  but whytf can i see what 's written there ? 
  he flips out and kills people unless he 's high ? 
  ~ ~ then who would win ... ? ~ ~ woops , i thought you said the civil war . 
  no one is ever serious if they insert 1 's into their exclamation points . 
  [ inserting a dollar sign into a word , however ... ] ( http://www.timecube.com/ ) ( it used to be on the front page ; now it 's hidden in the depths of his personal webring . ), 
  it keeps happening, 
  this shows up in my inbox as a link , and then i 'm like what thef fuck . 
  also , in ipa , / q / is the eleventh phoneme from the lips , and the third + 1 from the throat !, 
  its octopie gawg, 
  to be completely serious , i do n't think it is . 
  yes . 
  it did n't tile , and all the roads were the same color , but it was awesome !, 
  no periods at the end of your sentences , though . 
  are * you * gon na delete your comments ?
