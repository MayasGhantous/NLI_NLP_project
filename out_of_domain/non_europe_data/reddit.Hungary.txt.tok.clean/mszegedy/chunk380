  i do n't really like the rest of their t-shirts . 
  this one is good , though . 
  and they 're healthy , too !, 
  they tend to still have all the algae they 've eaten in their stomachs . 
  you misread it somehow , i 'm saying somehow they got onto the front page of / r/adviceanimals . 
  but the reason people upvote uop is not because they like the fact that it 's an unpopular opinion , it 's because they agree with it . 
  ( maybe * you * vote them up because it 's an unpopular opinion , but trust me , you 're in the tiny minority . ), 
  so once the puffins get to the front page , it looks like most of reddit agrees with this terrible opinion . 
  good idea , but how ? 
  take a look !, 
  sometimes it pokes out , and it 's obvious . 
  in any case , usually you can see the green color of the stomach , and if you bite the mussel in half you can find the algae on the inside . 
  your name is n't actually a protein or other biochemical . 
  where did you get it from ? 
  quick , put it in a chamber with an inert gas before it oxidizes !, 
  oh my god this must have taken so much ink to make ... did they really print out each frame ? 
  well , if nothing else , they would be able to sell them for a nice fundraiser in the end . 
  well , `` ink '' in the metaphorical sense , and what do you mean print it as a cell ? 
  i did mean 3d bear figurines . 
  they do n't break it down into atp , they take it apart into co2 and h2o and use the resulting energy to phosphorylate atp ( it 's a very complicated process ) . 
  and yes , they do have mitochondria . 
  what photosynthesis does is it makes glucose , so that the mitochondria can burn the glucose for energy . 
  you got the second part right . 
  photosynthesis does n't produce atp , though ( well , it actually does , but that 's not the point of photosynthesis ) . 
  here 's how it works :, 
  - photosynthesis uses ** light , carbon dioxide , and water ** to ** make glucose **, 
  - respiration uses ** glucose ** or other nutrients to ** phosphorylate atp ** and ** make carbon dioxide and water **, 
  so , if you stack them up the right way , then it fits !, 
  maybe i should , too . 
  i have work to do , too , but it 's really hard and boring . 
  you should advertise on / r/newreddits . 
  you need about 60 jupiters or something to get a brown dwarf . 
  it actually made the front page of / r/atheism . 
  no clue why , really ... 
  well , it * is , * is n't it ? 
  oh , whoops , i mixed up a brown dwarf with a white dwarf , and 60 with 80 . 
  thank you for correcting me . 
  in any case , it 's not going to ignite unless you pour about 75 more jupiters into it !, 
  they 've still got to unfuck the catastrophe . 
  well , but you 'd expect that since its physics are so realistic , they 'd generalize to other areas . 
  for example , airplanes were never actually programmed for , but due to its realistic aerodynamics model , they work anyway . 
  there 's also the ~ ~ inverse ~ ~ logistic function . 
  `` organic '' is n't a meaningful category if you are trying to describe the properties of materials . 
  there 's other ways of describing a material more directly , such as stiffness , brittleness , elasticity , plasticity , etc. 
  the most you can say is that the engine is n't used to fibrous polymers , but that 's probably not true either . 
  my god . 
  are you going to use it for anything special ? 
  do learn python , scripting languages are very useful for things . 
  if you 're going to need to write text processing programs , learn perl ; it has built-in regex . 
  actually , it 's a solved game !, 
  did you have some exact algorithm you went by ? 
  that 's impossible !, 
  how many sick days did you have ? 
  but iq tests are a terrible measure of intellectual potential . 
  it 's a much better predictor of the upbringing of a child , than anything . 
  unfortunately , we really suck at ways to devise intelligence tests that are even * sort of * invariant with respect to upbringing , never mind entirely so . 
  and brain size is an even worse metric ; have you noticed that women have on average a 130 cc smaller brain than men and yet [ seem no dumber ? 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10234034/ ), 
  and what selection pressures would have made us smarter , anyway ? 
  almost everything in cognitive science has a good evolutionary psychology-motivated explanation , and it 's always , `` in the ancestral environment [ in ethiopia a hundred thousand or more years ago ] , it became evolutionarily advantageous to [ have some sort of cognitive process ] because of [ some feature of life in the jungle ] . '', 
  in other words , we ca n't find any part of our intelligence that has evolved any more recently than before we left ethiopia !, 
  i encourage you to look for some cognitive process ( bias or otherwise ) that is only explainable evolutionarily by some selective pressure of life somewhere other than ethiopia , and show that it only occurs in individuals descended from the people who settled there , but good luck , man , because we have n't found one yet . 
  the claim `` black people are dumber than white people as a matter of genetics '' can easily be refuted by the realization that black people have more genetic diversity than the rest of the world put together ; the same claim about australian aborigines is harder to refute , but it 's based on the same , incorrect grounds as the first one , so i do n't see any reason to believe it . 
  ( just a warning : even if you reply to this post , i will not reply to it ; i do n't like cluttering up / r/polandball with arguments ), 
  does the sport need to be fun to watch as well , or just play ? 
  because most of a rationalist 's work is building a bayesian model of the world , and that 's not very fun to watch . 
  those ai wars games are fun and pretty at the heart of rationalism , but not very aesthetically pleasing for the players ; nothing on a computer beats being outside , in terms of sensory stimulation ( unless the only sense you have is hearing ) . 
  and exercise is a good benefit anyway . 
  i do n't have time to actually come up with one ; just throwing my thoughts out here . 
  edit : oh yeah , hold off on proposing solutions , anyway . 
  eh , it 's not so bad as long as you do n't claim any more importance than is due to you . 
  just treat it like any other intimidating social situation and post stuff without worrying about the consequences . 
  [ it worked for me .

  or , of course , \u03c0 ^ ( 3 / \u03c0 + sqrt ( \u03c0 ) ^ ), 
  edit : sense of humor ... ? 
  it 's not safe . 
  even if the bus were locked and deserted , it 's not safe . 
  you simply do n't get under things that can be made to move with gigantic amounts of inertia . 
  ( for that matter , especially do n't get in front of a running motor , even if the vehicle 's not moving . ), 
  ries , but it 's usually useless, 
  since that is where all the biggest breasts in the world are !, 
  you have been added as moderator to / r/hungary, 
  clay-stealing bastards, 
  hungary has the biggest penises in europe , but when i was talking about breasts i meant russia . 
  chaconne by vitali, 
  it 's just one guy, 
  edit : mostly one , but altogether three i think, 
  missed a good chance to shoehorn a * pinky and the brain * joke in there . 
  that 's unsanitary !, 
  thank you . 
  unfortunately , i can not change from dallas ; i wanted to visit austin , but it 's so far south that it would extend the trip inordinately . 
  i have already booked the accommodations at dallas . 
  thank you !, 
  i will see whether this fits in to my plans . 
  on top of all the other advice here : i know i loved the [ * penrose the mathematical cat * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-adventures-penrose-mathematical-cat/dp/1884550142 ) books as a kid roughly her age . 
  when you think it is appropriate for her reading level/math level , do give her these books to read ; they are really fun . 
  edit : and , when she 's older , you can give her [ * the number devil * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/number-devil-mathematical-adventure-ebook/dp/b009ozn7io/ref=la_b000apv4qo_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1401426989&amp;sr=1-1 ) , another excellent book of the same genre .
