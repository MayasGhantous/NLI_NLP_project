  hey , do you want to help szeklerland become separate from * your * country ? 
  because , we 'd like that a lot ... 
  die schuld , is n't it ? 
  not just you at all . 
  it was never fantastic but this is really shitty, 
  cool , but what makes it mitotic ? 
  flash would have been weird . 
  that 's weird , that they would make him left-handed . 
  i guess because if it were the puppeteer 's left arm that had to control the beak , that would make it more tiring . 
  itt : everything besides well-informed and straightforward answers . 
  maybe try compiling data about average salaries for the different subfields ? 
  [ for those not getting it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vergina_sun#controversy ), 
  yup , we 're going to go with * this * explanation for why we were so extremely incompetent in wwi . 
  ( still beat italy , though , obviously . ), 
  for the record , your hunglish and germenglish are perfect . 
  [ we have low standards ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arrow_cross_party#post-war_developments ), 
  it is , and so is switzerland . 
  nth world is a pretty dumb metric . 
  but man brazil 2014 is getting fucked up badly . 
  and it becomes nicely obvious if you consider their representation using e ^ ( ix ) , too !, 
  thank you !, 
  that is an insane amount of gun ranges to have in one place , i 'll be sure to see if any of these have courses on the correct dates . 
  sure , thanks !, 
  i have been to many kinds of mexican restaurants already , each more authentic than the last , so i 'll go with a bbq place . 
  i looked hard , but there was no way to book it such that i could stay in austin , without extending the trip by another day , which would interfere with my following plane trip to hungary . 
  all the accomodations are already booked now !, 
  can you recommend any specific historic sights ? 
  then again , from his perspective , this might be his only opportunity . 
  got ta get that girl 's number before it 's too late !, 
  my main motivation for wanting gun lessons is a brief `` cultural immersion '' . 
  i 'll surely meet interesting people at a gun range . 
  i 've dedicated my life to stopping people from dying ( i 'm a biomedical engineer ) , so guns in general are not really my thing . 
  i 've memorized the 4 basic rules of gun safety , though . 
  remember how opaque the retrieval charm was ? 
   `` i just falsified every single hypothesis i had !, 
  how can it know that ` bag of 115 galleons ' is okay but not ` bag of 90 plus 25 galleons ' ? 
  it can count but it ca n't add ? 
  it can understand nouns , but not some noun phrases that mean the same thing ? 
  the person who made this probably did n't speak japanese and i do n't speak any hebrew , so it 's not using their knowledge , and it 's not using my knowledge - '' harry waved a hand helplessly . 
  `` the rules seem sorta consistent but they do n't mean anything !, 
  i 'm not even going to ask how a pouch ends up with voice recognition and natural language understanding when the best artificial intelligence programmers ca n't get the fastest supercomputers to do it after thirty-five years of hard work , '' harry gasped for breath , `` but what is going on ? '', 
  the ai capability is probably somehow offloaded onto magic itself .

  well , i suppose it 's * relatively * valuable ... 
   barrage the farrage, 
  prosody ... sense ... tingling ... 
  is there a place where all his `` words of god '' are collected , retracted or not ? 
  me too , turns out it 's really useful ... 
  i 've read about 50 and agree with him . 
  but that 's the beauty -- you only cringe if you have read homestuck !, 
  right , but that would have been obvious to both of them either way . 
  if that was all he was basing his decision on , he would n't have needed to think about it . 
  why ? 
  to give the impression to harry that he 's not as smart as he is ? 
  i do n't see how this would make sense , considering that harry is flabbergasted as to how quirrell was able to figure it out . 
  well , we 've known for a relatively long time that protein motion can be usefully described in terms of fundamental frequencies . 
  we just thought the ones that mattered were the lower frequencies , like opening and shutting . 
  can someone offer a more technical explanation of what these guys have found ? 
  but i 'm surprised that * harry * was surprised that quirrell could figure it out . 
  and then quirrell would n't tell harry how he did so . 
  i , at least , ca n't think of anyone else besides the weasley twins when someone has informed me that a large prank was played by hogwarts students . 
  if the deduction were that obvious , quirrell would just tell harry so , and harry would n't be so surprised . 
  either there was some sort of alternative hypothesis that i do n't know about , or they both forgot that the weasley twins were * the * legendary pranksters and figured it out some other way . 
  that 's true , but i do n't exactly have much more information than harry . 
  he * knows * it was a prank , and essentially tells quirrell so , in addition to that it was performed by hogwarts students . 
  after hearing that , a. ), 
  there 's been a prank , b. ), 
  it was n't harry , c. ) but it was hogwarts students , then how do i avoid coming up with the weasley twins , especially if i 'm a simulated copy of quirrell in harry 's head and subject to his hindsight bias ? 
  it 's not an option !, 
  get `` earth '' or `` multiculti '' if you really do n't want people to see . 
  ( except you 're almost certainly american ! ), 
  great , now i 'm hungry . 
  humans do n't have the emotions for troll romance , so it 's irrelevant, 
  being the kind of person gryffindor idealized is already kind of a big reward . 
  not that i think that necessarily counts for anything . 
  it sounds good ... 
  not upside-down exactly , just has the last two colors switched . 
  maybe we can say it 's the german empire and the yellow in the middle is somehow the effect of lighting . 
  so , putting it together , i suppose your name is richard mcathen ? 
  except `` mcathen '' is n't a name anyone has . 
  for a `` hands on '' approach , you can read * the elements of artificial intelligence : an introduction using lisp * by steve l. tanimoto . 
  it contains some entertainingly out-of-date programming idioms ( e.g. 
  prog , loops using gotos ) and lisp functions ( e.g. 
  tyi and tyo ; they 're so useful , where did they go ? 
  ) , but it does actually cover a lot of key approaches . 
  you thought you could trust an indian to be able to tell the difference between astronomy and cars, 
  * burn * them . 
  there 's no more satisfying explanation than `` weird consequence of fluid dynamics '' . 
  what was the original context for this scene ? 
  i do n't remember it . 
  the part where you differentiate to find the velocity . 
  ... that 's what you 're comparing yourself to ? 
  well , when we see `` harry '' we think of our harry . 
  why make things momentarily confusing ? 
  ( he could also have said `` harry potter '' , which is less obviously specific but almost as helpful . ), 
  [ caltech has the * feynman lectures on physics * in glorious web form . 
  welsh compared to the romance languages is not far enough ; they 're still both indo-european . 
  say `` japanese '' instead .
