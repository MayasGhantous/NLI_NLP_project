  he admits that he hates living on earth , but he never says that all the other alternatives ( in this universe anyway ) are n't even worse . 
  \\ ^ this, 
  i 've been using python for a while and it 's totally fine . 
  visited / r/poland , / r/polska , and even / r/polan , but no animated upvote arrow . 
  yes , but one way or another , pakistan is a pretty shitty country . 
  oh k . but they do n't have animated upvote arrows either , they 've got animated flair . 
  yeah , now i have to find a gif of a kangaroo sleeping and post it, 
  dada, 
  as a hungarian , i tried to look at my country , and what has this map done to it ??? 
  edit : no wait , i 'm dumb , we were combined with slovakia . 
  your username is my profession , sort of . 
  i 'm guessing it 's yours , too . 
  do you enjoy it ? 
  thank you , that was helpful . 
  i inspected ` / etc/chromium/default ` and it seems it has the correct flags , and the version number for pepper coincides with the version i have . 
  i tried launching chromium explicitly with those flags , in addition to ` - plugins-enabled ` , but it still did n't work . 
  the grammar is similar , the phonology is similar , but in terms of vocabulary the only obviously related word i can identify is the word for `` to go '' . 
  ( `` menn\u00e4 '' in finnish , `` menni '' in hungarian ) if you look a little harder you can see other vocabulary similarities , but the languages mostly sound like gibberish to one another . 
  [ check out the comparison of how we count , for example . 
  ] ( http://francistapon.com/travels/eastern-europe/counting-to-10-in-estonian-and-four-other-languages ) the most similar we have is `` kaksi '' vs. `` kett\u0151 '' for `` two '' , but no way would a hungarian be able to tell that `` kaksi '' is supposed to be `` two '' unless someone told them so first . 
  edit : did n't notice `` nelj\u00e4 '' vs. `` n\u00e9gy '' . 
  that 's close enough to be identifiable upon first hearing , actually . 
  but the rest , not . 
  edit 2 : wow , the guy i linked is completely clueless about linguistics , actually . 
  for the record , indo-european and finno-ugric were not the only two language groups in existence at any point , and english has three cases , not one ( although for nouns two always look the same ) . 
  we * never * get over it . 
  trianon was in 1920 ; you think if we had n't gotten over it by 2007 , we 'd have gotten over it by 2008 somehow ? 
  the butthurt lives * on . 
  i was tired enough to not even notice any mistakes . 
  is -  in , restraints -  restaurants, 
  we 'd love to have you !, 
  if you do visit , make sure to see :, 
  - pubs : we have a marvelously atmospheric kind called a `` ruin pub '' in budapest that we keep recommending to tourists . 
  find one . 
  - bookstores : we have really great children 's books , especially didactic books . 
  if you ca n't read hungarian , you can still admire the aesthetics . 
  - historic locations : we 're proud of our crown , our statues , and our squares . 
  we have several historic squares in most major cities , but especially in budapest . 
  - villages : the interesting thing about these places is that they 're largely self-sufficient and kind of poor , so you can take a look at kilns , logging , large animals , seltzer , and old cars . 
   a little stiff, 
  not harsh enough !, 
  op , the pose looks totally awkward . 
  please rethink . 
  ( but great drawing otherwise ), 
  it 's not * in * chrome : / / plugins . 
  this comic explains it , does n't it ? 
  yes . 
  i also did everything i said in the post text ( with restarts in between ) , and what i said in the other comment thread here . 
  i design proteins , sort of . 
  right now , not very much at all . 
  but in general , proteins . 
  do n't want to say , if that 's alright . 
  no , sorry , it 's the regular ` chromium ` ; i edited my other reply to you to reflect the fact . 
  the problem magically fixed itself when i restarted the entire computer , though . 
  i have no idea exactly what solved it ; i updated the system and then rebooted . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  it 's not gnomic , it 's simple . 
  in the photo , shostakovich plays tennis . 
  as opposed to , in general , shostakovich plays tennis . 
  english , with all of its loads of aspects , seems to still have ambiguity between them in the present tense . 
  honestly though , the french are doing a great job right now of helping their former colonies . 
  eh ... has n't `` murica '' as a punchline been put in the jlp ? 
  i mean where the punchline is `` america is going to conquer this place ! '', 
  like the `` muslim rooskies with oil '' comic . 
  so what , she discovered the eka script and became some sort of laplace 's demon ? 
  i figured there 's only two obvious ways to do better than the scientific method ( the second one actually being a subset of the former if you think about it ) : method one , find out that your universe has a part that describes the whole thing ( e.g. 
  the script from * fine structure * ) , and just examine and trust that . 
  method two , find out that your universe `` is a simulation '' ( i.e. 
  is embedded in a larger computational medium ) , and just examine the simulation parameters ( if they are available ) . 
  i 'd have thought that this would be the second case , since the reality she remembers is different from what nephilopolis remembers , and there was that poem that asked `` which is life and which the dream ? '', 
  but this `` final equation '' sounds like the first thing . 
  huh . 
  you do n't need to convert `` brooklyn '' to latin unless you really want to . 
  `` ubi est brooklyn '' is fine for `` where is brooklyn '' . 
  `` where is brooklyn * at * '' would be `` ubi * ad * est brooklyn '' , but that sounds unnatural . 
  thanks , exactly what i was looking for !, 
  this yields the horribly unsatisfying and clunky translation of `` iamiamque venit sol '' for a certain beatles song . 
  well , the joke would be that you are implying brooklyn to be a mobile thing . 
  but i agree , it would take an unusual roman to say such a thing . 
  edit : compare `` where did brooklyn get off to ? '', 
  in hungary , the slow repetitive clap is the most respectful kind of ovation we can give . 
  there 's lots of regexes that would n't match anything , and `` $ $ '' is not literal , but two line ends after one another . 
  `` $ \\ ^ '' also does n't match anything ; it 's asking for a line where the beginning is after its end . 
  my favorite nothing-matching regex , though , is '' [ ] '' , the empty character class . 
  they were close !, 
  i 've met people born after 1992 who thought it was still a country . 
  quite the puzzle, 
  it 's funny/unbelievable/anthropologically interesting, 
  - police department, 
  - video game, 
  - solubility constant, 
  in decreasing order of likelihood . 
  they 've probably already done it . 
  lived in second world , can confirm . 
  still wary about flushing things down the toilet, 
  repeating old things quicker and cheaper to illustrate progress is pretty normal for homestuck , actually . 
  would you say john 's massacre of those gigantic underlings in cascade cheapens his battle early on with the two ogres ? 
  or that the quadruple-entry before caliborn : enter and all the entries in a5a1 cheapen the beta kids ' entries ? 
  or that the excessive amount of time traveling dave does in a5a2 cheapens the original jump he took to become davesprite ? 
  maybe .
