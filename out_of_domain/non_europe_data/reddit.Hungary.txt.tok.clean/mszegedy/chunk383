  but the point is , these things happened . 
  it is , in fact , easy to imagine dave quickly smashing through some kind of beat mesa on caliborn 's planet , in addition to a bunch of other things happening somewhere else . 
  bkew will almost certainly lose the bet , though ; i do n't see any good reason to believe that a third scratch would actually happen , other than symmetry and a more elegant origin for alt!calliope . 
  we do n't disagree , i thought they cheapened them too . 
  ( i suppose that 's why homestuck is only good to be read once -- you go through it the first time thinking `` this is epic '' along the whole way , but if you go back again then it all seems tame . ), 
  i just figure that given precedent it 's not unreasonable that it would happen . 
  no , because it is n't . 
  i certainly only had to read it once to understand . 
  ( no supplemental material , either . 
  look , it 's not * that * complicated . 
  there 's even recaps throughout , although they 're all extremely boring . ), 
  by `` terror group '' we mean an organization * specifically * devoted to terror . 
  the us government might cause terror sometimes , but usually not deliberately , and it 's not even the thing that results from most of its efforts . 
  * usually * not deliberately . 
  you call our flag ( and italy 's flag ) clashing , you jerk ? 
  :p but good point about the swastika . 
  whose idiotic idea was this ? 
  show me the memo , i 'll go notify the perpetrators that they have officially won the troll nobel prize in medicine for using their think pans as a condiment . 
  a better representation would be everybody pushing cylinders . 
  everybody pushes them on the base , except the one person who `` works intelligent '' and rolls it . 
  y-y * _ 0 _ * = m ( x-x * _ 0 _ * ), 
  ax + b masterrace . 
  you use a. . n for all other degree polynomials , why not 1 as well ? 
  because precedent is dumb . 
  we should also be lining the terms up from lowest-order to highest-order , a l\u00e1 mathematica . 
  there 's google , which is similar ( although more powerful and more shady ) . 
  yeah , so ? 
   creationist, 
  you mean biblical literalist . 
  do n't misrepresent your opposition . 
  we liked being part of the nazis , to be honest . 
  we were ( are still ) very white supremacist , and , most importantly , we got lots of clay under them . 
  edit : hmm , downvotes in / r/polandball are always a very bad sign . 
  maybe i did n't explain it very well ? 
  up until the communists took control of hungary , [ nazis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arrow_cross_party ) had been ruling hungary for a while . 
  we willingly voted them into the parliament . 
  during wwii , allying with nazi germany was advantageous for us , because we got to revise our precious trianon , and get back szeklerland . 
  if you 'd have asked any hungarian who lived under both the nazi government and the communist government which one they 'd preferred , then unless they were jewish or sympathetic to jews , they 'd have most likely thought that it was the nazis ( but they 'd say the communists , or else risk very unpleasant lives ) . 
  nowadays we do n't outright murder jews , but not everybody exactly likes them either , and a small section of crazy people even vote for that very party . 
  ( sorry in advance for not providing an actual answer ; i just want to consider the question ), 
  depends on how much energy each human consumes . 
  the absolute minimum is about 2000 kcal per day to fuel your metabolic processes , but if you 're a first-world human , then what you actually consume is ... way , way more . 
  there 's an upper limit on the total amount of human energy consumption the earth can * sustainably * support given current technology , and according to an `` awakening the dreamer '' symposium i attended a few years ago , we were already exceeding it by 2.5 times back then ( although they 're a little spurious , and i 'm not completely certain i 'm remembering the number correctly either ) . 
  notice `` given current technology '' : if we invent easy nuclear fusion , for example , we can grow our limit for how much energy we can consume well beyond just what the sun provides to us ( since we can cannibalize the mass-energy of the earth itself ) . 
  so how many humans is dependent on lifestyle , and your definition of `` carrying capacity '' , and the technology . 
  i would n't even have considered it ; i 'd 've thought that the com of the vehicle would be too imbalanced to fly , even with low-thrust nuke engines . 
  terrifically done . 
  the air presses on the exhaust , slowing it down so that it press as hard on the engine and drive the craft as fast . 
  ( sort of ; the analogy falls apart if you really use your intuition about newtonian mechanics . 
  but this is the best explanation i can think of . ), 
  the most efficient engines in the game , ion engines , should n't work at all in atmosphere , simply because the chamber where the ionized gas comes out of needs a vacuum . 
  in ksp , though , its isp is reduced gradually just like any other engine 's . 
  i like it , but it physically makes my ears hurt . 
  you must admit , we have to get * some * sort of special racism award for still having a nontrivial part of us willing to vote for nazis . 
  and a huge part of us voting for jobbik . 
  nazis we are not , but egalitarians neither . 
  you need * three * diamonds for that . 
  where did palestine get the other two ? 
  in which case palestine would n't need the pickaxe in the first place . 
  we only have patience for one significant figure ; his rounding was fine . 
  how was he supposed to know you preferred 2 ? 
  we * were * an independent state before that , but the pun is so good i do n't care . 
  also , then what * is * a good analytical text about nazi germany that most closely fits the niche * third reich * tries to occupy ? 
  thankfully the way i learned it in hungary is good for english too ( except that english [ l ] is more velarized , but it 's essentially the same phoneme ) . 
  [ ' \u03b5l\u03b5n ] vs [ ' \u03b5l\u03b5n ] or [ ' \u03b5l\u0259n ] or [ ' \u03b5l\u00e6n ] ( i do not have a good grasp of english phonology ) . 
  it 's a little funny because `` ellen '' is `` against '' in hungarian , but i have n't heard any good puns on it , unlike that fantastic french one . 
  the hyperbolic functions , on the other hand , we say `` koszinusz hiperb\u00f3likusz '' , `` szinusz hiperb\u00f3likusz '' , et cetera ( < sz  is just [ s ] and < e  is [ \u03b5 ] , the rest is pronounced exactly like the ipa character it represents , with stress on the first syllable always ) . 
  while unwieldy , i prefer it to the way you english speakers pronounce them !, 
  perhaps the divergence in pronunciation is because of the divergence in orthography : in hungarian , we write `` ch x '' , `` sh x '' , and `` th x '' , while in english you write `` cosh x '' , `` sinh x '' , `` tanh x '' . 
  well i 'll bet they 'll stop now, 
  exhibit a in why vigilante justice is bad . 
  he did horrible things , but * death * , especially * without a trial * , is not the way to deal with that . 
  this brought back horrible memories of grade school . 
  asian parent syndrome : oppressive , but usually gets results . 
  i 'm sure you know a lot about parenting, 
  i dunno , i liked it before ever reading anything about it on the internet . 
  i do n't watch it anymore , but it 's not hard to believe that it 's possible to like it . 
  it 's not * proof * of absence , but it sure as heck is evidence for it . 
  more so if there 's presence elsewhere . 
  as opposed to engineering or computer terms ? 
  really , it does n't make sense for * anything * to be gender-specific , except for biological stuff . 
  it 's pretty , and fun to look at for a person who already knows the maths behind it , but i 'm not sure a person who does n't know much maths from the onset would completely understand it . 
  ( possibly the julia set operation , which is well-visualized . ), 
  a lie , we call it `` foci '' , [ ` fotsi ], 
  but in that case adest is appropriate because you 're talking about people . 
  ( maybe assunt ? 
  that sounds a little ungrammatical . ), 
  i 'd probably just skip the headache and use est. 
  p\u00e1linka is frozen obviously . 
  why austria-hungary , exactly ? 
  well , awesome comic !, 
  really , the realization was that this would be acceptable to post on here, 
  that 's what i figured . 
  but it would be horribly impractical , since transfiguration is so slow and draining . 
  i nearly moved there once . 
  the only thing that i still remember about it is that it never stops raining . 
  how does a place like that even exist ? 
  there had better be an austria-hungary day too , then !, 
  not useless !, 
  contest mode randomizes the order .
