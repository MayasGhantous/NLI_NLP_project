  that 's important . 
  well , then , sucks if you do n't want to count downvotes , but not if you do n't . 
  that 's definitely something that needs to be fixed . 
  oh my god , i 've been subscribed to this subreddit for like a year now and did n't know about this . 
  thanks !, 
  well , and there 's also the fact that you need 60 dives for a divemaster certification , anyway . 
  when roman historian tacitus documented the [ ( proto - ) finnish ( probably ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenni ) in 98 ad , he noted that their babies were covered `` with the branches of trees twisted together '' to shelter them from the wolves . 
  i guess not much has changed in the past two thousand years !, 
   `` in wonderful savageness live the nation of the fenni , and in beastly poverty , destitute of arms , of horses , and of homes ; their food , the common herbs ; their apparel , skins ; their bed , the earth ; their only hope in their arrows , which for want of iron they point with bones . 
  their common support they have from the chase , women as well as men ; for with these the former wander up and down , and crave a portion of the prey . 
  nor other shelter have they even for their babes , against the violence of tempests and ravening beasts , than to cover them with the branches of trees twisted together ; this a reception for the old men , and hither resort the young . 
  such a condition they judge more happy than the painful occupation of cultivating the ground , than the labour of rearing houses , than the agitations of hope and fear attending the defense of their own property or the seizing that of others . 
  secure against the designs of men , secure against the malignity of the gods , they have accomplished a thing of infinite difficulty ; that to them nothing remains even to be wished . '',

  in my english class ( in hungary ) i was taught that `` shall '' is only appropriate for the second person . 
  this is complete bullshit and does n't describe its usage in any place ever , but it 's taught anyway in english lessons all over the world . 
  also , apparently , in [ the uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shall_and_will ) it 's taught that it 's only appropriate for first person . 
  i guess the lesson i received in hungary was a corruption of that prescription . 
  well , tbf when i visit my old village and interact with all of the senile old people there , a part of me wants them to give up and die , too . 
  but that would be horribly immoral and i think they 're worth keeping around . 
  just leave off the accent . 
  you can go and reclaim / r/soccerball if you like . 
  point of fact , the subreddit that \\ / r/polandball overlaps with the most , in terms of users subscribed to both , is / r/soccer . 
  it 's weird . 
  indeed , i linked to it, 
  tbf it barely shows up on my machine ; i do n't blame you, 
  that comment , however , was typical, 
  wow , but that does n't even work on numbers greater than 19 !, 
  what the heck kind of program is this . 
  i thought casting strings to arrays made an array of each character . 
  that 's marginally better , i guess !, 
  yeah , it was kind of dumb to assume a language with all-caps letters would have dynamically-sized arrays . 
  but then again , it 's got ( fixed-size , i guess ? ), 
  strings , which is probably what was confusing me . 
  does num-entries just count the number of commas and add one ? 
  or he 's german or something and ca n't remember english spellings for things . 
  ( for the record , `` handle '' in german is `` horn '' ), 
  while in this case it 's a totally adorable snake , if you 're ever in the southern hemisphere look out for [ caecilians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caecilian ) . 
  they 're fascinating , harmless , and just as cute !, 
  i speak hungarian . 
  the most interesting thing about it , besides the fact that it 's not really closely related to anything ( most closely to mansi ) , is vowel harmony . 
  instead of determining the declension of nouns by noun classes , which would be silly because what even does that accomplish , we determine it by looking at what kind of vowels are dominant in the word , and use a similar vowel in the ending :, 
  - [ \u0252 ] , [ a\u02d0 ] , [ o ] , [ o\u02d0 ] , [ u ] , and [ u\u02d0 ] go together as back vowels, 
  - [ \u025b ] , [ e\u02d0 ] , [ i ] , and [ i\u02d0 ] go together as unrounded front vowels, 
  - [ \u00f8 ] , [ \u00f8\u02d0 ] , [ y ] , and [ y\u02d0 ] go together as rounded front vowels, 
  each case ending will have up to three versions , each having a vowel representative of each group ; e.g. 
  our allative ending has three versions , [ hoz ] , [ h\u025bz ] , and [ h\u00f8z ] , one for each group . 
  sometimes the front vowels get lumped together ; e.g. 
  our illative ending has two versions , [ b\u0252 ] and [ b\u025b ] , the first for the back vowels , and the second for the front vowels . 
  sometimes the ending does n't change at all ; e.g. 
  our temporal ending is always just [ kor ] . 
  the really interesting part is when you do code switching , how the vowels are parsed then . 
  the other language 's vowels are usually not part of hungarian phonology , so they have to be `` cast '' to a known existing vowel . 
  based on my experience with me and other people appending hungarian endings to english and german words , the following mental substitutions are made ( while still pronouncing the word using the native phonology ) :, 
  - [ \u0251 ] , [ \u025c ] , and [ \u028c ] are treated like [ \u0252 ], 
  - [ \u0250 ] is treated like [ a ] , despite short [ a ] not actually being a sound that exists in standard hungarian, 
  - [ \u0254 ] is treated like [ \u0252 ] or [ o ] depending on the speaker, 
  - [ \u028a ] is treated like [ o ] , but if one actually pronounces the word with hungarian vowels out loud , it 's pronounced [ u ], 
  - [ \u00e6 ] and [ \u026a ] are treated like [ \u025b ] , but if one actually pronounces the word with hungarian vowels out loud , [ \u026a ] is pronounced [ i ], 
  - [ \u0259 ] and [ \u0153 ] are treated like [ \u00f8 ], 
  my german education in hungary lied to me !, 
  congratulations on being the first person to correct me . 
  one day , i 'm going to go to the khanty-mansi autonomous okrug , and talk to some mansi people . 
  the linguistic similarity will be blissful . 
  i do n't think randomness in strategy games is inherently bad . 
  you must build your strategy around it . 
  you do n't complain about randomness in a card game ; the randomness is a large part of what makes it fun . 
  in real life we have to plan around stochastic processes all the time as well . 
  what 's wrong with it in a strategy game ?

  it 's good , but do n't you dare use it for math !, 
  it 's a lot better for tallying than what we use in america , for sure , though . 
  as the customer , i 'd lie about my name . 
  whenever i 'm ordering drinks with my older male relatives , who all have the same name as me , i 'm `` sydney '' . 
  well , what did you expect when you put that sticker on your car ? 
  thanks !,

  esl speaker here : the phrase sounds perfectly natural to me . 
  what 's the better way to say it ? 
  thank you , that was very helpful !, 
  in my native language putting `` the '' before the substantive plural is a completely aesthetic choice and is almost always done ; that 's why i did n't understand , i guess .

  the link to it is in the original post, 
  no problem !, 
  it 's kind of weird how obscure it is . 
  i wonder how tim hutton found it in the first place . 
  eh , as a bioengineer i feel it really has pretty little to do with microorganisms , which are a whole lot more complicated than this . 
  on the other hand , they do resemble some of our models of fundamental particles , although that resemblance is pretty superficial as well . 
  i guess the best thing to appreciate it for is itself , and as a demonstration of a lawful , continuous-valued universe . 
  way to make me sound trustworthy , lol . 
  but yeah thanks for covering !, 
  hah ... yeah , that 's ... a complete fiction ... * guys should we be worried about this *, 
  wait , why are n't we calling this ( attempted ) revolution ?
