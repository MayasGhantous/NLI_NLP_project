  i am in the `` too crude '' camp . 
  lots of maps of brain activity look like each other , and people use them to draw all sorts of ridiculous conclusions . 
  the differences between novices and experts sound interesting , though . 
  anyone have the original paper ? 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.21493/abstract ), 
  thank god he did n't hit his back or stomach ; that would have hurt !, 
  how even do you time falls like this ? 
  that 's what i thought , and the answer i expected , but ... this sub is horribly cynical , all the time . 
  i 'm curious to see whether it 's actually justified , in this case . 
  from a political science standpoint , is there anything significantly different about this from a revolution ? 
  ( although `` revolution '' is a broad term ), 
  first thing 's first : it 's probably russian . 
  but it would be really helpful if you 'd tell us * where * you found it . 
  edit : they seem to be to counter dysentery ? 
  also , i 'm more sure it 's russian now . 
  when i first found `` moonlight sonata '' i was very disappointed that it did n't include the third movement as well . 
  that one would make a very fun chiptune . 
  the beautiful horse burns . 
  0/0 not color coded or arranged neatly try again, 
  ( more seriously : it 's good , but it * would * benefit from color-coding and organization , and is also missing a lot of food like jurph said . ), 
  read it as `` how to irradiate '' and was disappointed . 
  irrelevant in this case because there 's way more than 365 people here , and because we 're looking for people with a specific birthday as opposed to just any two people with the same birthday . 
  sorry , but ... how ? 
  did the ice look like indentations in a cliff ? 
  did the background look like a big black arch hanging over everything ? 
  that is some wonderfully-drawn fire . 
  tips ? 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll be sure to practice this . 
  but i 'm afraid localizing color-coding to just the food is wasting its utility . 
  i wo n't judge until you 're finished , but all of those box shapes look pretty similar ; it 'd be much easier to tell stuff apart with a more varied visual representation ( tautologically , almost ) . 
  you 're a bad pilot , but you 're not an expert at takeoff from a horizontal landing ? 
  it does n't compute !, 
  for the record , the way that you do it is that you try and point the rocket straight away from the body at all costs at every point during the takeoff , and you use significantly more throttle than the gravity of the body for the whole takeoff ( but not necessarily full throttle , because you might not turn upwards fast enough before your velocity exceeds the threshold at which your rocket explodes when it rubs against the body ) . 
  it 's not a chemistry game , it 's a computer science game , but one way or another it 's a great game !, 
  thanks for making us aware of the giveaway . 
  you 're fighting gravity that way , and waste delta-v . 
  i mean you burn straight up for the takeoff ( and can stop doing so as soon as you 've left the ground ) , not the transfer . 
  the chart 's a little confusing , i 'll give it that . 
  i 'd 've done individual , informative boxes for different species , and organized them by `` mostly yes '' , `` mostly no '' , `` sort of '' , and `` it really depends '' . 
  but eesti is finnic , not nordic . 
  they do n't say `` b\u00f6rk '' . 
  `` du was fr9d '', 
  ( credit / u/maxi _ w ), 
  it might have taken him dozens of seconds in ~ ~ gimp ~ ~ paint !, 
  dozens !, 
  yeah , this is exactly the kind of thing i 'd want the glorious fascist mods to prevent . 
  eel for example is farmed using juveniles caught from the wild . 
  well , also people that are n't around anymore , like the dacians . 
  frate '' ), 
  but we 're ethnically totally different !, 
  romanians originated from inside europe , while hungarians invaded from the urals in the ninth century . 
  he originally realized it as `` fr9nd '' , i.e. 
  but out loud it sounds fine !, 
  one way you can increase the amount of differentiation is to both consider border colors and body colors . 
  obviously not all combos work , e.g. 
  red body with a purple border looks horrible , but i 'll bet you could find a nice balance . 
  i 'd like there to be a very obvious visual difference between things dwarves can carry around , things dwarves do , and workshops , as well as a difference between things needed to build a workshop and things that a workshop continuously requires . 
  hmm , i might have to make a chart myself ... 
  you 're probably joking , but just in case you are n't , this is how it goes :, 
  - in cameroon , there are chimpanzees . 
  there are also people who hunt chimpanzees for meat , so they can sell it on the black market . 
  you 're not supposed to do that , because you could get any number of weird viruses from it , but it 's pretty lucrative . 
  - one day in maybe the 1930s , some unlucky chimpanzee poacher kills a chimpanzee with sivcpz , the chimpanzee version of hiv . 
  the chimpanzee 's blood runs over him , and gets into an open cut somewhere . 
  siv normally ca n't infect humans , but a mutant virion goes and infects this guy . 
  - our poacher is now infected with hiv . 
  he goes and has sex with someone , and hiv spreads throughout cameroon and the surrounding areas . 
  it infects both genders equally , since the original guy was probably heterosexual . 
  - sometime in the 1960s or 1970s , a gay guy with hiv travels from cameroon to the us . 
  he might have been a tourist who had sex with someone there and caught it like that , or he might have been an emigrant . 
  in the us , he has sex with some other gay people , and hiv spreads throughout the us gay community . 
  doctors are confused by why young people keep dying from old people diseases , until hiv is nailed down in the early 1980s . 
  you know the rest of the story in the us from here , because you 've lived it . 
  - meanwhile in cameroon , people are still poaching chimpanzees . 
  that transmission event that happened in the early 1900s happens three more times , creating [ three new `` groups '' of hiv . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subtypes_of_hiv#hiv-1 ) someone also gets sivsmm from a [ sooty mangabey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sooty_mangabey ) in the same way , resulting in the far less deadly [ hiv-2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subtypes_of_hiv#hiv-2 ) , which is more annoying than anything and will eventually die out . 
  right . 
  here 's what happened to the best of our knowledge ( copy/pasted from my response [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/298nhy/whats_a_conspiracy_theory_that_you_can_make_up/ciip7gz ) ) :,

  lol , thanks for the advice , i 'll keep that in mind !, 
  not just the \u00dcbersaw . 
  `` i have no idea ! '', 
  well , basically , in the 80s and 90s it was seen as mostly a gay disease , by which i mean only a thing that gay people ever got .
