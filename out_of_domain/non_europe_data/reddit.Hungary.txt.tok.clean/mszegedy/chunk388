  f -  m srs ? 
  they were concerned about tyrannical government , at least . 
  ( in the loose sense of the word , i guess . 
  `` taxes '' does n't sound too scary to me . ), 
  they 'd be a good angel for nsa-related issues . 
  tbf \u00c4teritsi 's naming was deliberately silly and does n't mean anything . 
  but why ... 
  thank you . 
  i tried to look it up , but i must have gotten it wrong , finding nothing . 
  how fundamental principles do you need , exactly ? 
  you do n't need to know about how computers make sound to make chiptunes \\* , but you want to learn that as well . 
  if you want to learn ultimately about everything behind anything , i recommend a physics textbook . 
  caltech has [ a very good online version of feynman ] ( http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/ ) . 
  you 'd learn what sound is , and how things like computers can produce it . 
  that 's not very useful for writing chiptunes , though . 
  for actual musical composition , if you want to get more competent , learn music theory . 
  there 's online courses for it both on [ coursera ] ( https://www.coursera.org/ ) ( there 's `` songwriting '' and `` digital sound design '' from berklee and `` fmls of music theory '' from edinburgh , among others ) ~ ~ and [ edx ] ( https://www.edx.org/ ) ~ ~ nope nothing there , and there 's a whole section on it in [ mit ocw ] ( http://ocw.mit.edu ) , where depending on what course you look at exactly there will be anything between lists of textbooks , course notes , and entire didactical videos ; they even have a course specifically on writing chiptunes , `` composing with computers '' , although there 's nothing particularly useful for that one afaics . 
  there 's also some youtube series , but i ca n't speak to their veracity . 
  if videos are n't your thing , though , there 's lots of books on the subject as well . 
  probably the best one [ is n't written yet ] ( https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/open-interactive-music-theory-textbook/x/7970842#pledges ) , but will be soon . 
  i taught myself using videos , not textbooks , so i do n't know much about this . 
  ( if you want to find good undergraduate-level textbooks about any subject , what usually works , besides just asking , is going to the mit ocw page and seeing what textbooks the course for the subject uses . 
  often they 'll cost a lot , but also often they 'll be available for free download one way or another on the internet . ), 
  most of all , i suggest asking / r/musictheory about music theory resources , because they know a whole lot more than me . 
  by the way , lots of chiptune artists go through how they make individual pieces of music on youtube ; you should also check that out . 
  off of the top of my head , [ george buzinkai explained how he did his song `` doctor '' ] ( http://youtu.be/esg71p_zeie ) , renowned among the homestuck community for its ubiquitous remixes/covers . 
  \\* everyone else : yes i know about the waveform editor , but let 's be honest , how often do you use your * intuitive understanding of sound * for that ? 
  meanwhile , i found that / r/musictheory [ already has a thread on learning music theory ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1gyq1i/faq_question_im_new_to_music_theory_how_do_i/ ) . 
  i do n't think `` top ( x ) '' lists are useful without a reasonably well-defined criterion that is n't just a category ( e.g. , `` top 10 for most realistic graphics '' is good , `` top 10 shooters '' is not ) , since people are different and will prefer different games . 
  so in that sense , yeah , they will make people argue , instead of doing anything useful . 
  but that 's probably not what they 're * supposed * to do ; they 're probably compiled with good intentions , maybe with helping newbies decide what games to get . 
  i think the way to solve the problem of varying preferences is to build a ranking system that determines what kind of gamer you are , and bases its recommendations on that . 
  like pandora , or the netflix `` recommended '' slot , but for games . 
  this is already done to some degree with `` if you liked x then you 'll like y '' , `` customers who bought x also bought y '' , and `` related games '' , but they do n't look at everything you like , just the one game you 're looking at . 
  i dunno , it might not be workable for several reasons ( individual games take a lot of time to play , for one thing ) but it could work for , say , steam . 
  you 'll get mechjeb the day you think , `` wow , my 100th takeoff and orbit was exactly the same as my 50th and all the ones in between . 
  this is beginning to feel more like work than play . 
  i wonder if i can automate it ? '', 
  some people never think it , but \\ o_o /, 
  steel armor appears to be made of butter , so you can pierce even masterwork armor with a crossbow . 
  it 's beautiful !, 
  what are all the reaction wheels for ? 
  but that many is overkill . 
  i can think of three reasons :, 
  - whirling the rover around really fast in orbit is really fun, 
  - making the rover be able to do ridiculous things like turn over from its back, 
  - decoration, 
  i personally do n't like it . 
  it 's obvious that the doctor is , overall , a `` good man '' ( well , he seems to be okay with people dying in general , just not while he 's around , but that 's good enough morality to show for a bbc time traveler ) , and him doubting it just makes it look like the bbc contrived an `` internal struggle '' plot at the expense of the doctor 's intelligence . 
  it would be a better plot if * first * he did something particularly immoral , and then had reason to doubt his `` good man '' - ness . 
  yeah sorry , i was gon na say , i was hoping for that . 
  then i forgot to say it . 
  sorry , i was going to say that maybe that 's what happened , but then i forgot . 
  [ `` us '' ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ singapore ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ irrelevant ] ( #green - text ), 
  but that would have been offsides anyway , would n't it ? 
  so , offsides is only you ca n't * pass * to someone behind the hindmost defender ? 
  huh . 
  yup , totally possible . 
  when portal 2 came out , it became my new favorite game . 
  i also felt super mario galaxy was much better than 64 , even though i spent a lot more time playing 64 ( because i was so much worse at games back then ) . 
  it is more difficult for some people to change their minds than others , but it happens . 
  just thought of something . 
  the village of kocs is located in kom\u00e1rom-esztergom megye . 
  kocs is where `` coaches '' were first invented and manufactured , giving rise to the word for `` coach '' and sometimes `` car '' in many languages worldwide ( e.g. 
  in hungarian the colloquial word for car is `` kocsi '' , in filipino the word for car is `` kotse '' , pronounced essentially the same way ; this is through spanish `` coche '' ) . 
  wow , i also caused a bomb threat once , in middle school , but it was nothing like this . 
  [ it was a deliberate attempt to imitate steve wozniak . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-in-jail-fake-bomb-2011-10 ) ( although , the version i heard of the story was that sounding like a bomb was an accident ; it was supposed to sound like dripping water . ), 
  they evacuated the school , and the kid whose locker i put it in was reassigned to a different section of the school . 
  meanwhile , i was never found out . 
  unfortunately , that also means that i never found out the details of how they reacted . 
  alas , i use linux, 
  `` naci '' , i thought, 
  ah , how about sunvox ? 
  its ui is a little clunky for portability , but i 've managed to make stuff with it . 
  oh , hah , did n't notice that . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  never played the game , but after hearing people talk about it , i have to ask , is * any skill * not game-breaking in skyrim ? 
  `` artist telmo miel redraws own doodles 20 years later '', 
  well , trolls are okay if they 're funny . 
  remember ferd ? 
  as a protein engineer , imo the realistic solution is to just rebuild the whole body from scratch . 
  there 's so much stuff that can break just on the molecular level : thousands of places where the epigenetics can break and cause cancer , thousands of proteins that are good for a few decades but eventually break and turn into amyloid , telomeres that are n't elongated ( and if you try to mess with that , you break the epigenetics ) ... in order to salvage it at all , you 'd need constant , intelligent surveillance for every cell . 
  it 's easier to just replace it from the ground up with a platform that you control . 
  ( this is * also * ridiculously hard and problem-prone , but more realistic than trying to clean up the mess that is the human body . ), 
  / u/fabulousferd . 
  he 's banned from most places now , but he was a troll that people liked . 
  you mean more than ? 
  oh , wow , i used to make that mistake . 
  i 'm guessing you speak english as a second language ? 
  it 's okay , the whole thing only contains a single tiny vial of primers . 
  yeah , surprised there was no question about that on the handedness test . 
  maybe so that it can also be used to evaluate children ? 
  i was picturing an elementary school getting a whole class of students to take the test . 
  there 's a lot more places where you can use something `` clean '' than if it 's `` dirty '' . 
  it does n't have to coincide with a real-world event , although the siege of mecca is as decent a trigger as any . 
  well , that one you 'd expect to show up in history , considering it 's a big enough event to ruin all of magical italy . 
  but casting the fidelius charm on the fidelius charm only requires one person , and not even a good reason .
