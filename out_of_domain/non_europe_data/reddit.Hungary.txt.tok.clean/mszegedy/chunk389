  which one , \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u044f or georgia ? 
  it 's the only way to prevent it !, 
  moss is pretty flimsy ; i 'd be worried about it breaking from the pressure from the fork . 
  the only things i recommend serving on moss are things that you lift up : things eaten with hands , or chopsticks , or spoons ( as long as they 're not soaky , like you said ) . 
  sushi might be nice . 
  your mushroom idea could work , but either the person eats it with chopsticks , or it 's raw and meant to be eaten with the hands . 
   thin `` dusting '', 
  that 's [ lichen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lichen ) ( or a fungus ) . 
  that 's not a moss ; it 's fungus and algae in a symbiotic relationship . 
  cool , but yeah , not good for bedding . 
  you need to do a * lot * of programming before you accidentally put a semicolon where there should n't be one . 
  i 've written about ~ 100k loc in my life , admittedly a lot of it in python and lisp , and i have n't made that mistake to date . 
  now , forgetting semicolons , that one happens much more frequently !, 
  edit : putting the opening brace on the same line as the loop statement helps, 
  sorry , did n't see that . 
  hah , i 've also lived in forests , but moss never grew on the rocks to my knowledge , it was always lichen . 
  wait , one of the only temperate rainforests in the us ... at a wild guess , norcal ? 
  `` a lot '' is about 60 % , though . 
  say then i 've written ~ 40k loc in c , c++ , perl , and java . 
  have n't made the mistake . 
  i tell you , it 's because of k&r - style indentation . 
  ( or , more accurately , 1tbs . ), 
  ( it was invisible to radio waves , in particular . ), 
  for me it 's 75 ,, 
  if you do n't care about minimizing delta-v , you can just experiment it out with maneuver nodes . 
  if you do care , then you can look up the phase angles online . 
  not looking them up only means you ca n't do a proper oberth maneuver , though ; in any case you can still get to solar orbit first , and then figure out an intersection point from there by manually searching through the different maneuver nodes . 
  wow , toady has inadvertently made a procedural witty phrase generator !, 
  i tried that in lisp a while back ... wow , imagine if dwarf fortress were programmed in lisp . 
  we 've got a similar very long word in hungarian :, 
  - szents\u00e9g ** telen ** : lacking holiness ( adj ) ( holinessless ? ), 
  - szents\u00e9gtelen ** \u00edt ** : he/she/it makes lack holiness ( v ) ( it deholinessifies ? ), 
  - ** meg ** szents\u00e9gtelen\u00edt : he/she/it makes things/you lack holiness ( v ) ( it deholinessifies ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edt ** het ** : he/she/it can make things/you lack holiness ( v ) ( it can deholinessify ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthet ** etlen ** : unable to be made to lack holiness ( adj ) ( undeholinessifiable ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9g ** es ** : having the inability to be made to lack holiness ( adj ) ( undeholinessifiabilitous ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9ges ** ked ( ik ) ** : he/she/it is partaking in actions that make him/her/it have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off his/her/its inability to be made to lack holiness ( v ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked ** \u00e9s ** : ** the partaking in of ** actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9s ** e ** : ** his/her/its ** partaking in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9se ** i ** : his/her/its partaking ** s ** in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9sei ** tek ** : ** your ( pl ) ** partakings in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek ** \u00e9rt ** : ** for/on account of ** your ( pl ) partakings in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( adpositional phrase , sort of ), 
  we say that this is the longest word in hungarian , but what that really means is that it 's the longest word of hungarian ever non-ironically written down ; notice that you could replace `` szent '' with a much longer adjective , including any of the intermediate adjectives in the formation of the final phrase . 
  we have a joke phrase that 's a little longer than this , `` elk\u00e1poszt\u00e1stalan\u00edthatatlans\u00e1goskod\u00e1saitok\u00e9rt '' . 
  `` k\u00e1poszt\u00e1s '' means `` having or having to do with cabbage '' , so the whole thing means `` on account of your actions of having an inability to be made free of cabbage '' . 
  edit : also , our longest word that still sort of makes sense , but as far as i 'm aware has never been used , is `` elt\u00f6redezetts\u00e9gmentes\u00edt\u0151tlen\u00edttethetetlens\u00e9gtelen\u00edt\u0151tlenkedhetn\u00e9tek '' . 
  it is too late at night for me to actually translate this , but i 'll take a crack at it tomorrow , i promise . 
  confirmed : communists ca n't dub whatsoever !, 
  nor jews . 
  the quality of the hungarian dubs is consistent with the quality we usually get . 
  the 1995 one sounds better than is usual for hungarian dubs .

  edit : help there 's no command pod what do i do, 
  not if you want to express that particular thing ; if you do , then this is by far the most natural way to say it . 
  ( i ca n't even think of an alternative way to say it with a loosely similar meaning . 
  but that does n't mean there is n't one . ), 
  but do n't worry , it rolls off the tongue easily for a fluent speaker !, 
  hungarian is easy . 
  ( the maximally long word you can get out of this in hungarian is megeur\u00f3p\u00e1s\u00edthatatlans\u00e1goskod\u00e1saitok\u00e9rt ), 
  normally you 'd say it in one breath , but there 's no shame in taking a small breath before one of the vowels . 
  keep in mind though , typical hungarian conversation does n't contain words this long ; the longest words would be somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 as long . 
  for example , meg < noun  telen\u00edthetj\u00fck ( `` we can get rid of the < noun  in it '' ) is realistic and comes up relatively often . 
  meg < noun  telen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9g ( `` the inability to get rid of the < noun  in something '' ) is a stretch , but you might hear it . 
  but anything longer is rare . 
  edit : you might hear '' \u00e1ramtalan\u00edthatatlans\u00e1g '' , the inability to be made free of electricity, 
  it 's still kind of embarrassing that lisp emulators written in c run faster than native lisp on lisp machines with similar clockspeeds . 
  there * must * be some sort of architecture on which you can write fast lisp !, 
  hmm . 
  say a devout christian preacher is explaining the ancient muslims , who he perceives to be a crude and savage people , in a sermon . 
  `` you would never want to be caught in the path of these guys . 
  they 'd conquer your land , and try to convert you !, 
  but really it 's slightly contrived even then , because i do n't know why you would n't just say `` megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9geitek\u00e9rt '' ( `` for your inability to be made free of holiness '' ) . 
  it must have taken a convoluted thinker to use the phrase in the first place . 
  i 'll try to look up for you where it 's originally attested . 
  edit : i could n't find the earliest example ever , because i 'm on my phone , but i did find an example `` in the wild '' : its natural habitat seems to be [ postmodernist gibberish ] ( http://www.mu.hu/hu/program/65/gergye-krisztian-tarsulata-adaptacio ) . 
  it 's only a noun phrase , not a sentence . 
  they 're a group of performers telling you what they 're offering in their performance , and they wrote on their ticket , `` calling , with the voluntarily invited , for your actions that show off your inability to be made to lack holiness , or make you have the inability to be made to lack holiness . '', 
  no , it would be if you 're draining the electricity from something so that it can be safely handled , e.g. 
  a capacitor , and for some reason you ca n't drain it . 
  while i disagree with your complete assessment because the whole thing is a consequence of the complexity of hungarian inflection and the richness of our library of clitics , and so it 's interpreted as a heavily modified word , there is a grain of truth : for illiterate hungarians learning to write , one of the biggest challenges is learning where to put the spaces . 
  no , to the little extent that we have noun incorporation , it 's obvious . 
  what tends to be most confusing is that our case endings formed from incorporated postpositions , and we still have postpositions , so it 's not immediately obvious if you 've only heard spoken hungarian which ones are case endings and which ones are postpositions . 
  for example , `` k\u00f6nyv '' means `` book '' . 
  `` a k\u00f6nyv alatt '' means `` under the book '' , while `` a k\u00f6nyv\u00e9rt '' means `` on account of the book '' . 
  an illiterate might make the mistake `` a k\u00f6nyvalatt '' , or `` a k\u00f6nyv \u00e9rt '' . 
  it does n't help that the pronouns tend to have the postpositions as actual cases : `` alattam '' means `` under me '' . 
  also , when concerning verb prefixes , the space can be genuinely arbitrary : `` nem tudom le\u00edrni '' and `` nem tudom le \u00edrni '' both mean `` i ca n't write it down '' , with `` le '' meaning `` down '' . 
  i 'd call that more the pronoun inflecting than the postposition , seeing as though the equivalent for '' - \u00e9rt '' is '' \u00e9rtem '' , and so on for all the actual case endings ( except nominative and accusative , which are '' \u00e9n '' and `` engem '' respectively , even though the accusative ending is '' - t '' ) . 
  since '' - \u00e9rt '' is not what is inflecting in that case ( it 's not a word ; well , it is , but it 's an irrelevant verb ) , you 'd have to accept adpositional marker + pronoun ending as a way that pronouns can inflect . 
  interestingly , certain endings do n't have pronoun equivalents at all : '' - ig '' , which marks the terminative case , has no `` igem '' or such , and neither does '' - kor '' , the temporal case marker , although `` korom '' is indeed a word , meaning `` my age '' ( and also `` grime '' but that 's again irrelevant ) . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i should confess that i originally had '' - etlen '' as one morpheme and i 'm not sure about the legitimacy of breaking it up into '' - et-len '' . 
  i do n't think you can get '' - len '' without '' - et '' behind it . 
  i think it might be that '' - len / - lan '' has individual significance as a morpheme for verbs , whereas for nouns it 's '' - telen / - talan '' ; e.g. 
  `` tejtelen '' , `` lacking milk '' . 
  i do n't know , it 's late and i ca n't think very well , sorry !, 
  edit : changed it to '' - etlen '' being a single morpheme , i think it 's right, 
  ls - lar / | less,
