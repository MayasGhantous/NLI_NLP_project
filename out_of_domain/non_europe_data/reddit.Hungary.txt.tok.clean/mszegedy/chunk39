  jeb fix this hte fuck up, 
  is this [ metacirclejerk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mcmetacirclejerk ) ? 
  i think it 's [ metacirclejerk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sbhj ) . 
  i upvoted this, 
  edit : sir, 
  it 's advertising your blog . 
  that is not what reddit is for . 
  okay . 
  just , you never know . 
  sometimes mods like to remove what they refer to as `` blog spam '' . 
  also , off-topic ( totally congruous , though , i swear ) , are you a fan of homestuck ? 
  8ecause having exactly 8 l 's in `` all '' m8kes me wonder . 
  but he 's presbyterian ; is that a kind of catholicism ? 
  ( as a greek catholic , i only know of greek catholic and roman catholic ) the only instance that i have heard of it was when i read the wednesday wars several years ago , and it sounded like it was n't catholic . 
  that ... sounds extremely cool . 
  better make those optimal points on time , though !, 
  or , even better , it 'll tell you precisely what configuration of pixels posted in what subreddit will earn the most karma possible . 
  how do most actual muslims feel about gays ? 
  i know several people who are muslim and several people who are gay , and they do n't seem to bother each other . 
  heh , as a catholic , this is an interesting idea to me !, 
  it makes perfect sense , though . 
  i just find it kind of ironic , as some other christians accuse * us * of polytheism because of our emphasis on the holy trinity ... 
  i think i 'd prefer oneness , though . 
  what aspects of your life have changed now that you are muslim ? 
  i had no idea . 
  heh , it even has a part about us !, 
  i 'm glad to hear mary is recognized by multiple faiths as holy . 
  so is allah seen as a concrete unit , a singular and absolutely unique and individual being , or as more of a `` force '' ? 
  we christians trend toward the latter , believing that the force of god inhabits pretty much everything . 
  i suppose this makes us monists . 
  what i 'm hearing here is that allah is a completely separate entity , a single idea to hold . 
  a very big idea , of course , but still , a particular thing , rather than a superset of all other things . 
  is this right ? 
  wow , this is a wonderful thing to behold !, 
  it makes one wonder why christians tend to be such jerks towards muslims ( well , the christians that get heard , anyway ) . 
  peace has always been something that i 've loved above all other things , and it makes me feel fantastic just to read something of this nature . 
  what . 
  how ?!, 
  no i mean how were the works contributed to . 
  i was reading mspa before homestuck !, 
  * engage ultra hipster mode *, 
  so what does hussie do ? 
  fucking fix you bastart !!!, 
  i am god , and i created you !, 
  and as a sophomore in high school . 
  do n't forget being a sophomore in high school . 
  fat autocorrect . 
  the traditionally accepted term is `` brood '' or `` peep '' . 
  also , the collective noun for a creeper is a `` grief '' of creepers . 
  okay , but the comic is new . 
  [ ohy you ] ( http://i709.photobucket.com/albums/ww93/ierickim/cl-lan/oh_you.jpg ), 
  downvoted for teh relaz, 
  holy * shit * . 
  feel good knowing that your work has become my desktop for years to come !, 
  ( new computer ; i only set the desktop once , and this is it ! ), 
  [ ephesians 4:6 ] ( http://bible.cc/ephesians/4-6.htm ) : `` one god and father of all , who is over all and through all and in all . '', 
  this is what i have been taught , and what i believe , that god is in everything . 
  this makes me ( and all christians who respect this bible verse ) monists , on account of believing the force of god to be in everything . 
  that distinction was lost on me . 
  yes , i do believe god is transcendent ... 
  [ a grief of creepers ] ( http://redd.it/dv9mv ), 
  [ a peep or brood of cocks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_collective_nouns_for_birds ), 
  a1 tastes like shit . 
  wtf ? 
  oh , okay , that sounds much more reasonable and logical !, 
  if one follows the model of `` sex is only for procreation '' ( i personally do , but i do not know about islam ) , then this makes sense , as it is impossible for gays to reproduce through sodomy anyway , which gives no reason for them to have sex at any particular moment . 
  therefore , sodomy , being a form of sex that never results in biological reproduction , should be banned wholesale . 
  how convenient for them , not having to deal with sex at all !, 
  i think regular readers like me would see it . 
  i see it , but i think you used shadows , which weiner does n't . 
  edit : yeah , both shadows and highlights . 
  weiner does n't do those . 
  it keeps happening !, 
  i was literally about to go to sleep . 
  :( welp , not anymore !, 
  i 'm one of those evil people who just listens to the bandcamp album , and uses freecorder to record songs he really likes . 
  i 'm broke as hell . 
  i like having an orthography where `` massive '' and `` massive '' mean different things . 
  clockstopper , all the way !, 
  `` i 'm leaving you . '', 
  ( okay that 's a pronoun but those act exactly like nouns ), 
  hahaha [ xenon ] ( / spoiler ) was my first guess for the [ x in lomax ] ( / spoiler ) , way back when we saw jake 's ~ ~ twitter feed ~ ~ echeladder !, 
  score !, 
  i wrote it off as hella unlikely though , and kept trying to think of other words that begin with [ x ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  i ended up with [ xylophones ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  boring , i know . 
  but at least we know now : [ the land of mist and xenon ] ( / spoiler ) !, 
  and that 's awesome . 
  [ it 's the land of mist and xenon . 
  mist , because of the weather on jake 's island , and how the weather on peoples ' planets has correlated with the local weather , and xenon , because all of the lands of the nobles end in noble gas letters : h , helium , n , neon , k , krypton , and x , xenon . 
  the `` sterile gas '' theme is i think a nice touch , as well as that the planets are in ascending order of electron shells !, 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  this works as well . 
  i was going by weather patterns . 
  woops , i thought it was his twitter-kind-of-thing , but [ no ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006473 ) . 
  thanks for catching that !, 
  no , that 's the way where the light goes through to solve one of the puzzles . 
  his mother is the same as another one that we lost to a pitbull attack last year , pamacs , or puffball . 
  i 'm no crab !, 
  just in case : should n't 've,
