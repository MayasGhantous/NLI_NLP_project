  but really it 's probably a lisp machine . 
  in which case i do n't know , because i do n't know any diagnostic commands in lisp . 
  sounds a little like intercal . 
  see also : korean, 
  why did he have to make all the letters so similar ? 
  they look very similar !, 
  for a person who does n't know the alphabet , armenian looks like nmhnuhu nmn nmn humun mhn unn umh mnmhumh unmhnmu etc. 
  similarly dyslexia-inducing is arabic ( although that one has concrete , easy-to-identify differences for a lot of the letters : do you see one dot , or two ? 
  below or above the squiggle ? 
  compare that with \u056b vs \u0570 , which is harder to see ) . 
  1443 is recent ? 
  the spanish empire called , there 's an island they want you to take a look at . 
  yeah , a little !, 
  like \u0553 for p ^ ( h ) , and \u0585 for o. 
  and \u0564 and \u0572 might be related to eta . 
  although , knowing the greek alphabet , i ca n't read armenian at all . 
  there 's a little difference between four similar letters and having those kinds of letters constitute the majority of your alphabet !, 
  the byzantines were , obviously , a bad influence . 
  ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg, 
  well , actually , their alphabet is pretty diverse . 
  but it 's still a funny visual . 
  like arabic !, 
  finnish , instead of a phonological change , has a morphological change : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aggressive_mood, 
  knowing hungarian , and knowing some finnish , i can accurately guess the meaning of `` mida vittu '' !, 
  there is only one thing to do , then : empirical measurements . 
  postpositions are written separately , and take a particular case ( usually nominative ) , while case endings are part of the word . 
  also , case endings tend to have vowel harmony , while postpositions do n't . 
  there 's no semantic pattern to either group ; most things are cases , but some things , like `` under '' , `` to under '' , and `` because of '' are postpositions . 
  they look absolutely the worst, 
  good luck !, 
  finnish is easy if you know what to expect . 
  just glue the right morphemes together , that 's all . 
  it 's easy to pronounce , too !, 
  i 'd use two double quotes for that . 
  [ somewhat related ] ( http://xkcd.com/746/ ), 
  [ they 're all metaphors for php . 
  ] ( http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ ), 
  that 's because it barely makes any sense , so people never use it . 
  / r/cirkeltrek is not necessarily funny , but has a good sense of community , anyway . 
  it 's good , but it misses the fact that the only thing fundamentally different about having a soul is that your mind is stored outside your body . 
  that is , it 's still run by * some * mechanism , just not neuron pulses like it 's supposed to . 
  that would n't make muggles p-zombies like quirrel says , it would just make them have different hardware . 
  ( the hardware in question that stores the wizard mind in canon is probably magic itself , just like it does a number of other intelligence-related tasks such as the retreival charm . ), 
  well , because legilimency reads whatever is stored in the magic machine , not the actual neurons in a person 's brain . 
  a muggle 's mind is n't uploaded , so legilimency does n't work . 
  or , alternatively , legilimency simply lies . 
  obviously there 's actual neuron pulses in a muggle 's brain , and if legilimency says otherwise then it 's just wrong . 
  the only question is whether muggles are `` conscious '' or not , but that 's equally mysterious and impossible to tell as it would be for wizards . 
  same mind , different hardware . 
  you can prevent a lot of stuff from oxidizing . 
  also , you can add oxygen and/or helium to it and create nitrox or trimix gas mixes to dive with ( i really do n't recommend this , leave it to the professionals ) . 
  the look-elsewhere effect ? 
  are you sure it applies ? 
  it 's really too bad . 
  pathfinding is a textbook example of `` embarrassingly parallel '' . 
  that 's the latter scenario . 
  ah , but we have n't even got eliza-like dialogue yet ... 
  what the christ . 
  great work , dude . 
   made by kerbals for kerbals, 
  ( from kerbals ), 
  well , if it looks like cs , it 's got the same problems as cs , and should n't be used , for the same reasons . 
  fortunately , in this case its usage is hilarious . 
  i had to struggle really hard to see it . 
  you 're losing it !, 
  there 's been a lot written on the subject . 
  [ this ] ( http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/why-you-hate-comic-sans/ ) is a fairly good summary , although it 's a little nitpicky . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.comicsanscriminal.com/ ) is more succinct , but with a much more annoying format . 
  also bbc wrote [ an article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-11582548 ) about it once that comes up regularly at the top of google searches about the subject , but i do n't like it much . 
  of course you do !, 
  who 'd want to color in all that black ? 
  been there , it 's not so bad if you 're used to it . 
  plus , i found a [ blue button jellyfish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porpita_porpita ) there . 
  and when i did so , i wrote an article online to teach it !, 
  i was 10 at the time , and was quite bamboozled by the programmer who replied that it was a good article but needed to explain how the compiler works and how to write libraries . 
  consequently , i never finished it :\\, 
  ( unfortunately , it was on a geocities site that no longer exists ), 
  is n't that algol , or asm for early processors ? 
  [ more relevant ] ( http://xkcd.com/191/ ), 
   not a good ~ ~ intro ~ ~ language imo . 
  although , it might not be possible to make a language like c++ good . 
  a full kitchen sink is a full kitchen sink , one way or another . 
  47 waxes . 
  ( did the people who wrote the intercal manual live in the southern hemisphere ? ), 
  it does n't . 
  there 's a simple aspect , a perfective aspect , and an imperfective aspect . 
  there 's also a helping verb ( particle , really ) for expressing the future tense . 
  there 's not 20 tenses in english !, 
  there 's two : past and present . 
  you can also get a third , future , with `` will '' . 
  you 're probably confusing tenses with aspects . 
  must have forgotten to tell it to `` relay instructions '' . 
  in its au ( in which it is a minority language in russia ) , it 's spoken by about 5k people . 
  my various other languages are also spoken by 0 people . 
  i am not a very dedicated conlanger . 
  ( for the sake of the pun , but also it 's accurate , since no one new will ever learn it ), 
  they 're low-contrast , and do n't look much like their respective symbols . 
  keep trying , though !, 
  it 's a good idea .
