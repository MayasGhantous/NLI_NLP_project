  sorry , have n't played minecraft in years . 
  i thought you were making a texture pack . 
  then explain time-turners . 
  mickey visiting his grandmother in age of steel . 
  rose and the doctor in doomsday . 
  `` i do n't want to go . '', 
  well , if you 're already in the thread ... 
  well , he almost got it right . 
  it was radio !, 
  and he makes it sound like roosevelt said so right after the market crashed . 
  er , who are you talking about ? 
  i think they 're non-living in the way that my textbooks are !, 
  i leave my textbook where it is for a day , come back , and it has n't changed a bit . 
  i leave my virion where it is for a day , come back , and it has n't changed a bit . 
  of course , nucleic acids eventually degrade , but textbooks eventually rot . 
  you have n't had snake yet ? 
  it 's personal now !, 
  my father is a leading theoretical computer scientist , but ca n't program his way out of a paper bag . 
  no , there 's computer scientists who have literally never made programs . 
  the thing you 'd expect a theoretical computer scientist to design is an algorithm , not a program . 
  well , you can `` prove '' things in theoretical physics . 
  because it 's math . 
  what 's the reason ? 
  ( i welcome speculation ), 
  his old work is very weird , occasionally offensive , and sometimes vaguely erotic . 
  it 's not any `` worse '' than what a lot of other cartoonists make , though ; it 's comparable to perry bible fellowship , or the earliest smbc comics . 
  if you practice it beforehand , it becomes easy ... 
  copy it to your computer and toss it . 
  i learned english in north america , but i 've only ever known the non-north american meaning . 
  i ca n't explain this . 
  the comments on articles on news websites are almost without exception really terrible . 
  i almost never create vocab for this reason . 
  they should really be sidebarred . 
  there 's a couple there already , but the links are all broken . 
  hahaha , that is hilariously incredible . 
  very kerbal . 
  it 's got grammar !, 
  i make the vocab up as i go . 
  why , are any of * your * conlangs completely finished with respect to vocab ? 
  the one conlang i care about having vocab for is the one that 's my flair , \u041c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u044d\u0440 . 
  its whole point is to have a language similar to hungarian ( like making up an imaginary friend as a kid ) , so making vocab for it is fun . 
  from elsewhere in this thread : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christopher_paul_neil, 
  tbf most places have provinces of some sort . 
  well , it does n't !, 
  not until i give it . 
   from the opposite perspective . 
  was expecting bush as a sesame street character . 
  was disappointed . 
  * is baller, 
  baller is an adjective now . 
  what 's wrong ? 
  google 's logo is the letter g. 
  wow , how much practice did this take ? 
  [ you are correct . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_spelling_and_pronunciation#vowels ) short u is [ \u028a ] , which is the sound in `` took '' , `` put '' , `` push '' , `` foot '' , etc. 
  long u is closer to american [ u\u031f\u02d0 ] ( `` choose '' ) , though , being [ u\u02d0 ] . 
  i can naturally do a slavsquat . 
  does that count ? 
  why would they be permanent ? 
  all harry is doing differently is changing what the transfiguration is acting on . 
  i do n't understand why latin is not yet the understood language of all the land . 
  ( it 's been over three years since i 've taken latin , give me a break ), 
  it 's okay , german is n't going anywhere !, 
  except if you have limited amounts of money . 
  knowing * vivaldi * is snobbish ? 
  do n't worry , you 're perfectly fine !, 
  wait till you start arguing with someone about whether glass or reich was a better minimalist . 
  crosspost to / r/youtubehaiku !, 
  swiss , on the other hand , suffer ocd . 
  did n't read the title ; thought the meme was about an oxygen man, 
  constricts your blood vessels , dries out your mucus , forces you to spend time inside with other people ... no , cold is pretty good for getting the cold, 
  well , yeah , you deserved it . 
  corporate enthusiasm is an important area of the industry . 
  i certainly would n't hire anyone who did n't have high marks in it . 
  [ that `` over a million colors '' picture is the most boring possible version of the task ] ( http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors ), 
  or pretty much any combustible compound really . 
  how about iron ? 
  you missed a chance for us to say `` fuck this gay earth '', 
  what he wants probably is `` semper parans '' . 
  ( or `` semper praeparans '' , but that 's a little too on the nose if you ask me , and `` parans '' is more default anyway . ), 
  afaik `` vestibulum '' just means `` entrance '' . 
  usually the best resource to check things with is [ william whitaker 's words ] ( http://archives.nd.edu/words.html ) . 
  it still sounds okay !, 
  the polish language, 
  heheheheh , you can make fun of things on reddit that most people on it do n't watch , but asoiaf/got ? 
  getting a comment seriously instructing you , that you 're * wrong * , is completely inevitable . 
  what , you do n't think the majority of most of these fandoms on this page are reasonable people ? 
  i 'll give you juggalos and columbine , but bronies ? 
  dr who fans ? 
  justin bieber fans ? 
  crossfit users ? 
  reddit users , for that matter ? 
  anime viewers ? 
  it 's always a minority . 
  got is n't different from any of the other listed fandoms , with respect to how much of a problem there is . 
  why would that make a difference ? 
  / u/adlikesepics was talking about irl as well . 
  what happened was he said something bad that got fans do sometimes , and then you responded that there 's people who do n't do that . 
  of course there 's people who do n't do that !, 
  it 's understandable that you 'd get offended at a generalization , but how much stock are you going to put into that generalization when all of the other ones in this thread are equally correct ?
