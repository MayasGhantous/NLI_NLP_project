  ( or incorrect ? ), 
  i do n't mean to pick on you personally . 
  having one person who does n't realize that making fun of them is n't uniquely unfair is normal . 
  what really rubs me the wrong way , though , is that you 've got 3/2 as many upvotes as the guy above you . 
  meaning more people agree with you than that guy . 
  meaning a majority of reddit users read this thread , thinking , `` wow , yeah , that fandom is entirely terrible !, 
  and so is that one !, 
  literally every fan of * that * thing is an idiot ! '', 
  i did n't know reddit was this ... out of touch ? 
  maybe it * is * the worst fandom . 
  ^ ( well , besides all the ones that are actually really bad . ), 
  what do the liberals hate obama for ? 
  or intercal !, 
  no ick . 
  that 's exactly what i noticed too . 
  wtf ? 
  you mean not transient , right ? 
  transient means it only sticks around for a short time . 
  well , it 's a bit sensationalist if you ask me . 
  it 's not like wwi put us in the dark ages or anything . 
  try / r/askhistorians !, 
  `` most of the world '' is generous !, 
  but the real problem is , that the cartoon makes it look like the war 's going to extinguish civilization permanently , when , really , civilization was pretty much on track . 
  * exterminated, 
  this is what having multiple desktops ( or , if you 're rich , multiple monitors ) is good for . 
  unmanned ... that 's creepy . 
  is this on bash.org ? 
  never saw it there . 
  sure , and if you expect nuance from a political cartoon , then you 're foolish . 
  but the person i replied to called it `` prescient '' , which i think is unfair . 
  finally , my cursory knowledge of spoken finnish pays off, 
  i 'd 've done it in microsoft word 2003, 
  sort of like when fighter blocked the ground in 8bt . 
   / ** coas\u0259 ** naks vai l\u025bn , siks his \u02a7o\u02a6\u0259 ` sosul /, 
  do you mean / tsoas\u0259 / ? 
  ( based on < c  in < choce  ), 
  a singularity would be really good for us if it happened . 
  therefore we 'll try to make it happen . 
  what 's entitlement got to do with it ? 
  her pole, 
  well , no , but trucks go long distances when you could just use trains for that instead !, 
  trying to get parking at this place is * terrible . 
  * unless you 're actually there for ikea . 
  why does ikea always make all of its stores sweden-themed ? 
  it 's like a weird form of imperialism . 
  edit : good god you guys can really downvote . 
  ikea = / = ethnic restaurants . 
  you do n't go to ikea thinking , `` i 'm going to buy some furniture here , because it 's culturally swedish ! '', 
  it 's just furniture . 
  so what 's the point of over-emphasizing that it 's swedish ? 
  obviously , it 's because ikea wants to take over the world . 
  it does ? 
  they look more kalmar union-themed to me . 
  do you mean factors ? 
  the thing that i am happy i do n't see in this thread ( yet ? 
  ) : prescriptivists, 
  i do n't, 
  but then how do you portray it ? 
  trolls are magical creatures . 
  you ca n't use transfiguration to put enchantments on things , only to rearrange matter . 
  how is that different from an isis-ball ? 
  no , i mean , visually different . 
  in polandball , flags are just clothes , are n't they ? 
  so an iraq-ball wearing isis insignia is just an iraq-ball with an isis flag ... in other words , an isis-ball . 
  do you mean carrying an isis banner ? 
  that could work . 
  or one after another . 
  sure , you could . 
  just oconnor663 did n't mention that . 
  and it would be easier to just have the troll with you in the first place . 
  ( well , sort of . 
  first , you need to capture a troll . ), 
  the fact that people are dying is probably a good reason . 
  the reason for not making fun of things is because it hurts people 's feelings ( which is worse than it sounds ) . 
  you can make fun of things that do n't seriously hurt anyone 's feelings anymore , but it 's not nice to point and laugh at people who live under terrible conditions at this very moment . 
  everything ?? 
  could you please give examples ? 
  i wish people 'd ask me about the good restaurants in town . 
  maybe i should eat less healthy food and exercisbwahahaha that 's mathematically impossible , i 'm thin because i 'm starving . 
  that i 'm gon na steal something or attack people . 
  or that i 'm very , very poor . 
  only the second one is true . 
  that 's when you dismiss the insult as baseless . 
  this would make a great dr who episode . 
  as a hungarian currently visiting family in poland : probably the most important things to know about it are that poles are very religious , not very socially progressive , and have tasty but unhealthy food made mostly out of potatoes and cabbage . 
  the place is littered with jesuses on crosses , and statues of their favorite pope , [ jan pawe\u0142 ii . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_john_paul_ii ), 
  edit : [ please remember that this is based only on my particular experience !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blind_men_and_an_elephant ) if you have more to say about poland , then please say so . 
  although , in defense of `` very religious '' , [ here 's some data and a chart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ) . 
  poland is one of the most religious places in europe !, 
  pretty close !, 
  as i 've also got family near ostrava in the czech republic , we meet in t\u011b\u0161\u00edn / cieszyn . 
  certain kinds of pierogi , such as those filled with ground meat , cabbage , or potato ( which tend to be bathed in gravy ) , and also szasz\u0142iki . 
  yes ? 
  i 'm not an expert on polish cuisine , and you should really take my opinion for what it 's worth , but the dishes that stick out to me as particularly polish are things like pierogi , bigos , placki zemiacz-something ( potato pancakes anyway ) ... poland 's also got their own version of stuffed cabbage , it 's named after pigeons but i ca n't quite recall it . 
  i guess i 'd also add sausage and ground meat to that characterization , but empirically , potatoes and cabbage is accurate !, 
  since you seem more qualified to tell us , why do n't you do so instead ? 
  to your edit : well , i 'm not generalizing based on my family , i 'm generalizing based on what my family says . 
  my family near skocz\u00f3w is n't religious ; they 're hippies .
