  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/by-the-wind_sailor ) has it got long tentacles ? 
  i wish english was german, 
  good article covering a lot of bases , but i wish they had n't compared copyrighting java to copyrighting a language . 
  cooked bush meat is a lot safer . 
  the fire destroys anything too complex . 
  what about languages with lots of keywords , like common lisp ? 
  hilariously there 's just been made an [ arabic version of that particular language ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/08/03/337168933/-no-tofu-doesn-t-equate-to-no-problem-for-google-universal-typeface ) . 
  yeah , was gon na say . 
  `` holy shit , we 've got an asteroid made of exotic matter ? '', 
  sounds like hungary and romania . 
  in hungary we 're quick to blame romania 's government for things , and make fun of romania for being poorer than us , but disparaging the actual romanian people is much less popular , and interactions in person can be positively friendly . 
  poland-lithuania ? 
  but this is positively libel, 
  missed an opportunity for the vatican to speak latin rather than italian !, 
  `` it takes multum to be best catholic . '', 
  when i was very little in hungary , my mother would give me poppy tea to make me fall asleep ( like everyone else 's mother ) . 
  i guess it had been a widespread practice for a while . 
  did you like it ? 
  working on a phd in molecular and cell biology , i thought that was a left hand . 
  that 's probably what it was supposed to be , but honestly if it were real life it would be more likely that he just sucks at reassuring speeches . 
  ( instead of sucking at acknowledging his mistakes . ), 
  understanding it as copyright is kind of like how rincewind understood insurance as the insurance company making a bet that something bad wo n't happen to you . 
   even some nonpolar substances with ions dissolved in them will behave this way, 
  good luck dissolving ions in a nonpolar substance , though . 
  be sensitive , maybe / u/pinkywithoutbrain is an ai . 
  although , `` butterfly '' * does * sound silly . 
  oh wow , never noticed that . 
  any other interesting derivations to share ? 
  wow , this is great . 
  best joke i 've seen on this sub . 
  i was going to do that , but even if you are naively going on whether the next letter is a vowel alone , you 'd write `` an ai '' . 
  never mind pronouncing it out loud . 
  should have written `` a fai '' ( `` friendly artificial intelligence '' ) , except nobody would have gotten the joke then , and it does n't quite fit anyway . 
  oh no , the return of the terrible fixed-width font :(, 
  would those still exhibit the same effect ? 
  maybe they 'd be too heavy . 
  sorry , i hate it so much, 
  we have n't discovered nuclear fusion yet . 
  i name mine after memes or other sorts of internet terms , like everyone in the comic [ erfworld ] ( http://www.erfworld.com ) . 
  my first rocket to the mun was named leeroy , and my first duna base was named armchair activist . 
  maximum warp !, 
  hah , that 's always been one of my favorite comics of yours . 
  i do n't quite understand why austria has to be magnetized in the first place ( it 's already got the charge , has n't it ? ), 
  but it looks brilliant, 
  well , there 's their problem . 
  * never * looked at porn ? 
  they should have asked about whether they regularly watch porn or not . 
  i appreciate it for some reason . 
  it 's just so reassuring, 
  there should be a gamma ray emission !, 
  hmm , some sort of extremely high-energy particle with enough energy to create both england and savoy ... the gauls ? 
  but the flags are bilaterally symmetric , not rotationally symmetric , so technically it would n't work . 
  [ do you see the problem ? 
  well , just because there 's no single solution does n't mean that it 's completely arbitrary . 
  i ca n't think of any consistent way of projecting flags onto spheres that would both make denmark equivalent to savoy and people would like for all the other flags as well . 
  ( of course , it has n't * got * to be consistent , but most readers would probably agree that it would be inelegant if it were n't . ), 
  when i had to formalize this , i went with a modification of the reverse of the [ pierce quincuncial projection ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peirce_quincuncial_projection ) . 
  fix the aspect ratio of each flag at 2:1 , tile it with a reflection of itself to get a square , and reverse the projection . 
  it preserves angles ( besides the inital aspect ratio change ) , is pretty straightforward , and does n't result in any weird distortions . 
  i use dvorak , and while it 's really easy to remember where x is , i still have n't quite got the hang of q. 
  also , it 's less to type , and i can reach it with either hand . 
  what 's wrong with this post guys ? 
  it 's hilarious . 
  ah , but programmer 's dvorak !, 
  my complaint about q is stupid , i 've had dvorak for about a decade now . 
  some things you can simply never remember ... 
  it was at -4, 
  i think urist mccockgoblin is saying that his computer runs so slow that he 's never generated a world older than 250 years . 
  [ it 's not actually that hard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rzeczpospolita ), 
  three reasons :, 
  tumblr is inhabited mostly by teenagers ( mainly girls ) . 
  there is a sliding scale of how self-aware the people are ; the norm is `` not very '' ( which is mostly harmless ) , and the worst is the mythical `` tumblrina '' , a term which you can google . 
  there are a lot of social justice advocates on the website , who range all the way from knowing exactly what they are doing to being the worst stereotype of misguided social justice warriors you can imagine . 
  it 's not all teenage girls , though ; it 's become a popular way to run a blog for pretty much anyone , be they artists or scientists . 
  but those , especially the scientists , are pretty rare . 
  edit : [ jebusmcazn hit the nail on the head ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2dsyys/you_had_one_job/cjsyrcx ), 
   / \u026b / -- is n't it in free variation with / l / ? 
  hmm , that 's true , i forgot to account for the fact that it 's rp . 
  then it 's actually just [ l ] for that one . 
  [ w ] , then , that 's not in austrian german . 
   / \u0251\u02d0 / -- not in british enlish, 
  what do you mean / \u0251\u02d0 / is n't in british english ? 
  [ yes it is . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipa_for_english ) how 's it pronounced , then ? 
   / \u03b8 / -- replace it with [ t\u032a ], 
  actually , most germanophones , i think , would replace it with [ s ] . 
  either way , not being able to pronounce it is exactly what is happening there . 
  shit you 're right . 
  um , okay , two reasons then . 
  / w / ( weak argument , could be imagined as the diphthong [ \u028a\u025b ] or something ) and the aforementioned [ \u03b8 ] , which still totally counts . 
  hmm , fair point , i forgot to mention fandoms . 
  they 're a pretty integral component of tumblr . 
  i wanted to sort of explain why reddit talks about tumblr so much but at the same time offer a balanced description . 
  sorry , your summary is much better than mine . 
  has anyone really etc etc etc, 
  ca n't canada complain about the mayor of toronto and shitty internet ? 
  ( gib aid pls or nuke ), 
  what the hell is wrong with these people ? 
  i can at least understand aids denialists ; hiv is latent for years before * indirectly * killing you . 
  ebola , however , undoes all of your connective tissue within two weeks .
