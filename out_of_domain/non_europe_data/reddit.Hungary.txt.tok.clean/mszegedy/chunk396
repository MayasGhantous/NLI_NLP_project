  edit : and , after bathing in the h2s , you were supposed to wash your eyes in a nearby spring , which carried what they called `` szemv\u00edz '' , `` eye-water '' , that was supposed to be good for your eyes after you exposed them to the h2s . 
  knowing about amoebas and such , i passed on that one . 
  on the indexed internet , anyway . 
  wow , good job / u/grotestruisvogel !, 
  oh wow that 's embarrassing . 
  basically , i took a crack at it and * failed . 
  * lem me try again :,

  no problem !, 
  it 's fun, 
  hold on , i 've got an important question to ask . 
  last time i saw a thread discussing five guys , everyone agreed in-n-out makes better burgers than five guys . 
  i moved from new jersey ( where i ate at five guys often ) to california ( where i ate at in-n-out exactly once ) last year , and i found the in-n-out burgers much inferior to the five guys burgers . 
  for one thing , the five guys burger used actual , thick crispy buns , whereas iirc the in-n-out used these pretty thin fast-food type of buns . 
  and the in-n-out burger left a weird onion-y aftertaste in my mouth that i associate with fast-food burger places , whereas the five guys burger had a properly balanced taste that was mostly meat and also a lot of the tasty toppings i put on it ( such as jalape\u00f1os ) . 
  my question is , what experience have you had with five guys that makes you prefer in-n-out burgers more ? 
  did i order incorrectly at in-n-out ? 
  ( i ordered a `` double-double '' . ), 
  do five guys just suck in california ? 
  or is it the price ? 
  it 's not as high-resolution as the xkcd charts though . 
  the xkcd charts show the individual groups the characters were in . 
  this chart only shows time travel and multiverse travel . 
  reminds me of that too , really, 
  i agree , fuck the mongols, 
  nope, 
  what kind of shitty trackpad are you using ? 
  my thinkpad 's trackpad works just fine for drawing . 
  it 's like finger painting !, 
  if siphonophores are made of genetically identical units , then what made us decide that they 're collections of organisms rather than single organisms ? 
  it ca n't be that the units can survive on their own , because that 's not true , otherwise they would n't need to be part of a siphonophore . 
  is it the lack of a tissue interface between the different parts ? 
  they ca n't be completely disjoint , otherwise they would n't be able to share resources , but are they generally easy to separate ? 
  wot . 
  how is that not perfect ( colloquial ) english ? 
  none of it would sound unnatural to a native american english speaker . 
  that about 6 million people identifying as jews live in a thin strip of land in the levant is undisputable fact . 
  that they have the military capability to defend that land , that is also reality . 
  but states themselves only exist on paper , and in people 's heads . 
  recognizing israel as a state is an arbitrary thing you do , in your mind . 
  anyone can make that choice . 
  well , single pixel or time step , sure , but that just means that you 've got to plan precisely . 
  you * have * control over single pixels . 
  there did used to be a lot of experimentation going into the details , though . 
  we 've got a catalogue of every single way two gliders can interact with each other , for example . 
  gol engineering actually revolves a lot around firing gliders at things , such as each other . 
  edit : see for example [ the p416 60p5h2v0 gun ] ( http://conwaylife.com/wiki/p416_60p5h2v0_gun ) , which constructs a spaceship by shooting gliders at a base . 
  heheheheheh and sometimes it works out terribly . 
  have you heard of the [ two-glider mess ] ( http://conwaylife.com/wiki/two-glider_mess ) ? 
  i dunno , i think they want to show that they think that the people should n't have moved there in the first place . 
  like , it shows that they think of israel as an unjust occupation of palestinian clay , and that it really belongs to the palestinians . 
  that the correct thing to do would be to give the palestinians their clay . 
  like in your analogy , calling football `` barbaric-ball-game-of-gross '' would imply that you think people should n't play it . 
  what with the moon turning and all , would n't that be really unlikely ? 
  you 'd need an almost perfectly circular orbit , and to not be located inside a crater . 
   for instance , i see no indication in either canon or hpmor that even all the wizards and witches working together could prevent a star from going out . 
  brilliant , i 'm sad i missed this, 
  did you expect it to exist ? 
  well , if you aguamenti 'd a star enough , that could keep it going . 
  not sure how you 'd get enough output for that , though . 
  oh man i kind of wish walkthroughs were still done in ascii . 
  nothing says trustworthy and well-meaning like ascii art and indentation by hand . 
  then again , videos are probably more useful ( but more boring , and more difficult to navigate ) . 
  i say [ \u02c8\u025bv\u0259nz v\u025dz ], 
  ( as is frequently pointed out when this website is mentioned , technically it 's possible to `` download more ram '' in a sense when you have more than 3.5 gib and you upgrade your os from 32-bit to 64-bit . ), 
   that 's rather roundabout logic that certainly does not make downloading ram `` technically possible . '', 
  that 's like saying that you can build a new wing on your house with your bare hands and then opening the door to the already built wing that was just closed . 
  technically possible , right ? 
  wot . 
  you download something and you 've got more ram , how is that not downloading more ram ? 
  but you do n't * have * it until you 're using it . 
  no , more like you wo n't get charged with possession until you 've bought the weed . 
  same logic with the gun . 
  ram you ca n't use is no ram at all . 
  whereas if you 've got weed lying around , you can smoke it anytime . 
  what else would `` download more ram '' mean ? 
  besides strictly `` you download something , and more ram hardware is added '' , which is impossible unless your computer can physically construct ram for you . 
  fine , whatever , i give up . 
  `` downloading ram '' must refer to downloading physical ram hardware , and is therefore impossible and suggesting that anything similar is covered under the definition is completely idiotic . 
  i swear , you are the most patronizing people i 've met on reddit in recent memory . 
  but the important part about the concept of `` downloading more ram '' is that you can increase the amount of ram you have just using the internet , or , more specifically , by downloading a piece of software . 
  or anyway , that 's what i find important about it , because that 's what i find interesting/out of ordinary about it . 
  and you can actually * do * that . 
  but seriously , if you find it so different and lacking ... some sort of core property that you think is important to qualify as downloading more ram ... that you think it `` is n't even remotely technically possible '' , then whatever . 
  i honestly do n't see much of a difference ( download ... ram file or whatever , and install it , getting more ram , vs. download os installer , and use it , getting more ram ) , but arguing semantics about * anything * is pretty much always a terrible waste of time . 
  let 's argue about something that actually is a thing , like , i dunno ... what do you think of newegg ? 
  they 've always shipped out everything i ordered properly , and i 've been able to rma stuff at every opportunity , but i know a lot of people do n't like it because they think it has shitty customer service and sometimes has bad business practices .
