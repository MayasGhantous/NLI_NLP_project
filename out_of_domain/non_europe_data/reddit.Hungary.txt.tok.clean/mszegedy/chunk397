  ( we do n't actually have to discuss this , i was just giving an example ), 
  ( i got your other reply in the meantime . 
  have you ever actually * met * a mentally disabled person ? 
  or a particularly wide range of people for that matter ? 
  being able to understand someone else 's point of view is an important skill , and you 're not doing very well at it right now . 
  or for that matter at being nice to people . ), 
  :\\ i 'll take it, 
  it really does depend on the quality of the theremin , though . 
  the worst ones sound scratchy and uniformly terrible . 
  \\* runs away \\*, 
  sure . 
  first there was old latin , then classical latin , then vulgar latin , then of course all the predecessors to the romance languages , followed by the romance languages themselves . 
  however , this is a very compressed and simplified history ; old latin changed over time , so did classical latin , and vulgar latin was n't really a unified language so much as a bunch of different dialects in a bunch of different places , and really the same thing could be said of its predecessors , and it 's not like all the predecessors to the romance languages come directly from vulgar latin either . 
  in short , it 's complicated , but the answer is definitely yes . 
  [ it 's actually really difficult to get them especially even ] ( http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/ ), 
  not difficult programming-wise , but how long would it take you to come up with poisson-disc sampling by yourself ? 
  in civ , you need to declare war to invade , though . 
  how does it steal land ? 
  * i never knew that . 
  this changes * everything . 
  * thanks !, 
  if you do one of these for america , you 'll get the higest-ever rated comic ... again . 
   anyway , they died of msg poisoning . 
  not that polandball 's got to be accurate , but as a protein engineer the idea of msg being worse for you than table salt annoys me . 
  it 's just salt with the chloride ion replaced by a glutamate ion !, 
  your body literally makes those and builds proteins out of them !, 
  brb making a comic where someone dies of hysteria, 
  hell , not even just 80s style . 
  last time this happened to me was around 2008 when i tried to install sim city 4 . 
  holy crap . 
  you are like those people who buy 10k piece puzzles and enjoy putting them together . 
  awesome comic !, 
  then again , have you met poles ? 
  they 're quick to tell you how terribly hard to learn their language is . 
  [ see this crank especially . 
  ] ( http://claritaslux.com/blog/the-hardest-language-to-learn/ ) but also , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/toi6zvn.jpg ) exists ( titled `` hardest language to learn ( hardest on top ) '' ) . 
  that it 's one of the top posts on / r/badlinguistics should give you a clue as to its veracity . 
  this is n't the place to type out a detailed rant and i do n't have time to anyway , but suffice to say , language difficulty is extremely subjective , depending on what languages one already knows , how much of a grasp of linguistics you have , and individual intellectual differences , and do n't think more inflection = more hardness just because you speak an analytical language . 
  being able to speak multiple registers of the same language is a sign of laziness and illiteracy !, 
  far-right nationalists would be especially scared of russia . 
  i guess they 've been promised something like slovakia ? 
  in hungary : usually a soup , such as a thick , even vegetable-based soup with slices of hot dog sausage in it , or [ this thing ] ( http://www.mindmegette.hu/vegyes-gyumolcsleves.recept ) . 
  sides include bread and sauerkraut . 
  how ? 
  it 's potato quality . 
  edit : oh , no , wait , i see it ; weird movement , shiny opaque black windows, 
  what 's wrong with that quote ? 
  it sounds like he 's just saying that every live cell possesses dna , which is n't wrong . 
  edit : i know about red blood cells , but i do n't think they 're considered to be technically alive . 
  even if they are , though , his quote works as a blanket statement with few notable exceptions . 
  are they considered alive ? 
  iirc you need genetic material for that . 
  that 's a good point , but it did n't sound like he necessarily meant that it 's all reproductive tissue . 
  he could just mean that it 's got the same dna ( roughly ) as the reproductive tissue . 
  ( also , you can probably [ transform ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malignant_transformation ) it depending on what it is , which * will * cause it to divide , but he probably did n't mean that , seeing as though that was unheard of at the time . ), 
  yes . 
  but not in the us thank god . 
  i find it funny that so far nobody 's agreed with anybody else which word stands for what . 
  imo `` peshda '' is obviously the verb , since both `` turunai '' and `` maxroani '' end with '' - i '' , and are next to each other , while `` peshda '' ends with '' - a '' and looks simple enough to stand for such a basic verb phrase such as `` are rebelling '' . 
  i think `` turunai '' is people and `` maxroani '' is kingdom rather than the other way around , because otherwise you would have written `` the kingdom 's people '' . 
  dammit no , this is cancer, 
  or lying . 
  well , that 's because you 're using far . 
  :p but you were way too deep for aerocapture anyway ; that ship was going to end up as a lander !, 
  earth, 
  1 . either a year or 413 days after it began, 
  1 . college maybe ? 
  prolly a better one coming up as i get married soon, 
  post it at / r/hydraulicsporn , too !, 
  it 's mine . 
  nobody ever posts . 
  :\\ pls post it so that there 's more content, 
  yes , figured it would be one of poland 's neighbors and wondered whether the joke was supposed to be surprising or not . 
  then i tried to think of any other countries that fit , and wondered whether japan spoke more than one language . 
  it depends , if there 's games in it you know are good then you can get it and like it . 
  if i do n't have terraria , or civ v + expansion packs , or vvvvv , or antichamber , etc. , if i see it in a bundle with maybe some other game i like i 'll buy it . 
  unless you 've got gold , which i usually do n't . 
  :( it 's like the one thing it 's useful for if you 're not a moderator . 
  ( recently someone very nicely gifted me gold for a comment on / r/videos , and i 'm enjoying the hell out of it ), 
  thank you !, 
  is there any way to get a version of the wiki from the previous version ( like the dwarf fortress wiki ) ? 
  i realize that i could look through the revision history , but that takes a lot of time . 
  tries to push handle with hand holding jar of paint , jar spills ? 
  [ ever ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007998 ), 
  edit : but seriously though , dirk 's eyes in prince : rise up and the ghost 's eyes in roxy : sleepwalk and probably a lot of other places too, 
  never mind capaldi , what does tennant say in `` silence in the library '' after saying that the shadow is n't gone , it 's moved ? 
  `` ah , i 'm sick ( thick ? ) !, 
  i 'm old and ( s/th ) ick !, 
  \\* additional gibberish \\* '' what 's its context in the plot ? 
  brain-wifi messing with his mind ? 
  no , it 's to show its 3d-ness . 
  it 's way too far away for us to see multiple angles of it . 
  this was constructed digitally . 
  but he already knew what was up before , telling donna that the shadow 's moved . 
  why does it make sense that he realized it just then ? 
  and what 's the third sentence he says , after `` i 'm old and thick ! '' ? 
  i ca n't understand it at all . 
  ( thank you for replying , though ! ), 
  i still like that other origin story posted here better , because it contains the lines ( paraphrased ) , `` they were looking to create a new , intelligent race of beings , that would expertly take to the stars and rediscover their lost civilization . 
  instead , they got kerbals . '',
