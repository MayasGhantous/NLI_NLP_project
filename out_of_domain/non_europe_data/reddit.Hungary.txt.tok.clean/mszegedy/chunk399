  or simply use pastebin, 
  - rts level of complexity ; i want to be able to design a spaceship to get kerbals to planets , and then send a thousand of those there to start a colony , and grow it into an entire planetary civilization , thereby extending the amount of fun i can get from one playthrough, 
  - procedurally generated * everything imaginable * ( planets , solar systems , parts , celestial bodies of every kind , starting locations ... they add a critical level of variety to the experience ), 
  - multiple launch sites , especially ones i can establish in places ; this makes it convenient to launch things , and cool to use to expand your `` empire '', 
  - multiple galaxys ' worth of stuff to visit ; this gives more stuff to see , like hot jupiters , star systems with many stars , quasars , etc. 
  - n-body physics , because they 're hilarious, 
  - life i can discover , in all sorts of stages using all sorts of biochemistries, 
  - good music ; people sink hundreds or thousands of hours into this game , they should n't have to listen to the same five or so mediocre tracks all the time, 
   sometimes they 're the same person ... 
  mario , motherload ... nope , ca n't name any more . 
  killing bats , however , might actually do some good . 
  they carry diseases !, 
  even so , this gets posted weekly . 
  they 've got to have * something * else they can post instead of it that has been seen by less than 90 % of reddit . 
  the stupidest part is , it 's not even into the communist, 
  i thought you did it on purpose !, 
  no , but a tin can . 
  this is really , really great sm64guy , i 've wanted something like this for years . 
  thank you for compiling it . 
  this is brilliant !, 
  i like the idea of countries still being around millions of years before humans even evolved . 
  ugh , what a / r/atheism vibe . 
  i do n't like the quote anyway , as it 's possibly the most pretentious thing you could possibly say . 
  first three words match hungarian : '' \u00c9s a kutya fia ... '' , meaning `` and the dog 's son '' . 
  i doubt that 's what it actually is , though . 
  i do think the last syllables are `` messiah '' . 
  what is your teacher 's ethnicity ? 
  edit : actually almost all of it parses to hungarian -- '' \u00c9s a kutya fia csak a [ luma ] sz\u00e1ja '' , `` and the dog 's son is just the mouth of the [ luma ] '' . 
  it 's probably not hungarian . 
  well of course , but who 's going to interpret it that way ? 
  the / r/atheism vibe is due to its being a quote ( incidentally containing the word `` god '' ) on a stock picture of space . 
  or almost any other austronesian language, 
  maybe `` a [ luma ] '' is a verb ? 
  but then it would be `` sz\u00e1j\u00e1t '' . 
  and typically we use `` kurva '' as a derogatory term . 
  how about knut haukelid ? 
  [ pandoraviruses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandoravirus ) are pretty cool , because their genomes are gigantic . 
  ( [ mimiviruses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mimivirus ) are slightly less huge , but better-studied . ), 
  [ virophages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virophage ) and [ satellite viruses in general ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satellite_%28biology%29 ) are imo the `` weirdest '' viruses , because they parasitize not just cells but viruses themselves , in a sense . 
  what 's wrong with asking ? 
  it 's a fair question . 
  although , if it 's a prepared slide , the answer 's probably a boring `` ordered it online '' . 
  thought i was in / r/labrats , disappointed, 
  what do you suggest instead ? 
  we could go the `` programming '' route and name every protein after its function , but then you 've got proteins that are entire noun phrases and are made up of already existing english words . 
  i 'd prefer it to `` c5b67-complex '' , though . 
  fun fact : i learned perl a year and a half ago from sam . 
  thank you sam for writing that tutorial , i still love it very much . 
  your new investigations are hilarious . 
  that 's like asking about making airplanes out of black boxes . 
  it 's not the material that 's special , it 's the structure . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2g4b8e/meanwhile_in_ukraine/ckfvn4j ), 
  it 's not about that . 
  just why the fuck do i have so much karma from here ? 
  lol, 
  thanks for the offer but i 'd rather keep it as a curiosity , lol . 
  any idea what caused it , though ? 
  i told you guys once that it seems like nobody ever downvotes here , but even so ... 
  both . 
  well , you wo n't see anything in the past year or so . 
  i used to be on here a lot , though .

  meh , that would still sound kind of impressive today , especially considering its date . 
  really small data is less than 100mb . 
  ( although even 1mb is a lot , in a sense ), 
  aha , the polandball version of that image floating around that says to the effect of `` what if we use emojis so much that we start writing using ideograms again '' . 
  awesome job !, 
  wow , thank you , this is fantastic !, 
  more like planets . 
  it 's not terrible to confuse people of * any * race who are the same race with each other . 
  i at least do it all the time , and i 'm sure so do a lot of other people . 
  my internet really sucked that day , but it was n't because of the slowdown . 
  i really make an effort to try and tell people apart , but it never works . 
  it was a joke , of course it was newton 's second law and not freakin ' relativistic mass gain . 
  ( well , actually , i do n't think it was either , i think it was structural weakness , but of course your explanation is more plausible ), 
  the coffee table, 
  pfft , he did n't even mention * one * emacs command . 
  started ch 3 , but could n't think of anything interesting enough to write . 
  :( looking back at the fic now , i kind of hate all my writing , but that 's how i feel about literally everything i write . 
  glad you remember it though !, 
  as an eu expat : is n't that only within the schengen zone ? 
  going from hungary to romania , i still had to cross the border and get a visa . 
  i 've always thought the `` honor culture '' vs `` shame culture '' was just a way to oversimplify foreign cultures that everybody latched onto because it 's easy to understand , not an actual anthropological concept . 
  thanks for providing ammo against it . 
  ( any actual anthropologists want to clarify ? 
  can dichotomy really the existence ? ), 
  i wanted to complain about everyone using french for madagascar instead of malagasy , and went to wikipedia for statistics , but then realized that all the links were purple and i 've done this before . 
  there are no language stats for madagascar !, 
  not on wikipedia , not anywhere !, 
  i wish i were a field linguist . 
  did poland share a king once with * everyone ? 
  how do you get so many dikes in one place ? 
  curious if french guyana says that it imports from germany the most because it actually does , or because it 's counted as france . 
  so , if you follow the chain `` up '' , then i think there 's at least two distinct loops ( attractors ) you could get trapped in : germany/netherlands , and china/japan . 
  any others ? 
  wow , i had no idea it was that late . 
  although , it should have been obvious given [ one of the top comics of all time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/16yr67/australian_accent/ ) that at least it was post-wwi !, 
  go to jupiter or saturn !, 
  they have moons made entirely out of ice . 
  or hell , `` just '' go to mars .
