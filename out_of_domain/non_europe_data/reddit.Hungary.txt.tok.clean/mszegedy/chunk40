  `` tavrosgrub flinches ! '', 
  you have to be the most polite person i 've ever seen on reddit . 
  and this news saddens me . 
  i do n't understand why people constantly and thoroughly soil the world in which they reside , in full knowledge of their actions . 
  more amazing though , is the amount of gall that * authority * employs in doing fuck-all about the problem . 
  why do they so resolvedly persist in being completely useless against the trouble they are meant to combat ? 
  the day we get rid of self-interest is the day we solve all of the world 's problems . 
  `` i 'll be the martyr here '' = poorly disguised `` i know i 'll get downvoted for this but '', 
  upvoted anyway . 
  wait , really ? 
  source ? 
  yeah , but it 's still tired . 
  it 's just a thing that happens with memes and language ( memes as in ideas , not persistent and annoying things people say on the internet ) . 
  this actually sounds like a good idea to do . 
  you 'll see the results on the front page on monday . 
  even the authorities ? 
  surely they ca n't be * that * corrupt . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  no love for casey ? 
  but seriously this is the best picture . 
  hmm . 
  i already knew all of this ( save the number seven ) , but never made the connection . 
  actually , i still have n't . 
  so ... seven gates ? 
  but ... what else ? 
  oh , also , my money 's on `` pyramids and neon '' for lopan . 
  oh my gog you 're right, 
  except i 've always had the impression that he had blue skin . 
  blue skin , anyone else ? 
  or am i alone ? 
  well , nevertheless , i think your interpretation is what hussie was going for ( if he was , at all ) . 
  would n't that be `` grand ** o ** '' ? 
  yeah , that 's what i thought , too . 
  somehow plants just seemed more hardy and adaptive than animals !, 
  i think they were * all * extremely fantastic . 
  it 's like a whole album of awesome . 
  i did particularly like `` green ghost '' , `` cyan beast '' , `` pink cat '' , `` emerald terror '' , `` pendulum '' , `` do the windy thing '' , `` bec noir '' , `` battle brotocol '' , `` the vast glub '' ( i 'm not sure why this was n't in the previous album , though ) , `` wv : become the mayor of cans '' ( which follows standard rules of capitalization while do the windy thing does n't ) , `` march of the batterwitch '' , `` clockstopper '' , `` checkmate '' , `` vodka mutiny '' , and `` pipeorgankind '' ( wherefor the art is soooooo beautiful ) . 
  see what i mean about an album of awesome ? 
  oh , and if i had to pick songs that felt a bit lacking , i might say red disc , pilot light ( not a fan of the art either , although it is objectively extremely well-done , which is also a pun ) , and squiddle song . 
  this is my new favorite piece of all time . 
  thank you so much for showing me it . 
  `` oh man , i am so eager to listen to this ! '', 
  \\  the owner of this video has not made it available on mobile . 
  fffffffffuuuuuuuu, 
  paw cat you outrun meow, 
  when i 'm already fur . 
  i 've thought lots of homestuck shenanigans have been red herrings in the past . 
  i was wrong . 
  i 'm going to play it safe on this one and believe it . 
  there 's lots and lots of universes . 
  some will have doc scratch . 
  yil that you can do that with audacity . 
  even * rufio * 's died . 
  uhh ... jack noir , dirk , roxy , pm , lord english . 
  davesprite , if that counts ? 
  if so , then nannasprite and jaspersprite as well , but not jadesprite . 
  is billious slick dead ? 
  oh , and post-scratch draconian dignitary , jack noir , and courtyard droll . 
  and then the white queen , but not the white king and the black royals . 
  most of the prospitians and dersites . 
  one squiddle . 
  the condesce . 
  the denizens , and the consorts , and the population of post-scratch earth . 
  aaaaaaaaand ... that 's it , i think . 
  edit : no , wait , uu/uu . 
  and quarters and clover , possibly . 
  edit 2 : well , i guess the black king and queen from the alpha universe are n't confirmed dead . 
  but what would the condesce do , just let them keep living ? 
  * post-scratch * wq . 
  and , what i 'm saying is , davesprite , nannasprite , and jaspersprite were dead \\* before * they became sprites . 
  so , given our very loose definition of `` having died '' , can we say that they have n't ? 
  and i know about both billious slicks , i just was n't sure whether jack had actually killed the trolls ' or just seriously injured him . 
  i was considering hiring an artist , but i figured it would be too much money ( any money is too much money ) . 
  if i could find somone who would do it for free , that would be awesome ... 
  i 'll write the music first , though . 
  flatly contradicting a statement is n't the best argument against it ( evidence and so forth ) , but i digress . 
  because you know for sure the exact reason why the things that christians attribute to god exist ? 
  not a mastermind . 
  a mastermind knows moderation . 
  thanks !, 
  where might i find this ? 
  i like the first one !, 
  thank you very much , i 'll pm the author , if such a thing exists on tumblr . 
  i 'm not familiar with exact parameters of these two methods , but the way i see it , there 's only one way : one of your living selves has to die on a quest bed . 
  having an alive dreamself up to the point that you die on your questbed also seems to be a requirement , especially since it has always been the character 's dreamself that becomes the godtier . 
  or i guess you could do some weird sprite sorcery and prototype a sprite with ... something ? 
  hmm . 
  i now have a valid excuse to go to britain !, 
  ( from america ! ), 
  no , this time around they added more buildings around the enderman . 
  before , it was just the enderman and the building he was ripping up from the ground , with a lot of close-ups . 
  no i ` ts persay you fool, 
  edit : i was joking . 
  i have several years of education in latin . 
  oistrakh 's , i think . 
  i do n't have a particular reason that i can give as to why he sounded the best to my ears , it just sort of felt ... more `` real '' than the other two ? 
  i think my subconscious musta liked the piano or something . 
  i dunno , just ... wow . 
  jeb fix,
