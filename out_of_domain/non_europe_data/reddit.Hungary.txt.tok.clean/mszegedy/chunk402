  i want this to get built so i can visit the hell out of it . 
  thank you mr. bot !, 
  sorry , i thought that was done automatically . 
  i want this to get built , so i can visit the hell out of it . 
   are n't these the same people who are enthusiastically child-free ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  at least since recently , the counterjerk has been strong . 
  i think the character you project for the `` chosen '' is a little pessimistic . 
  people manage to feel bad about things all the time ; i 'm sure at least a minority of them would feel bad about all the people getting sterilized . 
  oh who am i kidding . 
  probably they 'd just nervously laugh about it , say out loud that it 's a shame , and think to themselves that they 're lucky they 're probably not going to be the ones getting sterilized . 
  how even could you mistake hungarian for finnish ? 
  the phonologies are pretty different . 
  if it ends in `` s '' it sounds okay . 
  otherwise , not . 
  :\\ you should probably go elsewhere for that . 
  not sure where though . 
  it 's okay, 
  yeah , saw it a year or so ago , and remembered that it would be appropriate for this sub after seeing a skyscraper on here, 
  aww . 
  i guess if it ends in a noun it makes sense , but imo `` united kingdom '' sounds fine . 
  ( although this is coming from a guy whose first language puts the word for country after every country 's name ), 
  yeah . 
  :( or actually :, 
   `` earthscraper '' concept for mexico city, 
  would planes ever really be a serious concern for skyscrapers ? 
  the sky is big and both planes and skyscrapers are pretty tiny in comparison . 
  - [ even sentences constructed out of the most closely related words are n't mutually intelligible ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#lexicography ), 
  - they split off in like 3000 bc or something, 
  - languages tend to have similar phonologies to neighboring languages , not related languages per se , although both are influences, 
  - have you heard samples of both ? 
  they do sound very different, 
  - or just look at the phonologies :, 
  - three vowels in common , four vowels that are similar ( but subtleties like that are what make languages sound like themselves in the first place , if you get what i mean ) , and one vowel in finnish that 's not present in hungarian at all plus two vowels in hungarian not present in finnish at all ( i 'm thinking of / \u00e6 / vs / \u025b / and / a : / , although the / \u00e6 / and / \u025b / are pretty similar ) . 
  - finnish does diphthongs with / w / , which i can only think of one example of in hungarian , `` aut\u00f3 '' . 
  - hungarian is full of affricates , which are barely present in finnish at all . 
  in the other direction , finnish has / \u028b / , while in hungarian labial approximants , even from loanwords , are always realized as [ v ] . 
  mfw he was n't trolling, 
  yes , i just randomly remembered this . 
  i could have sworn that it was actually going to be built , though . 
  edit : [ slightly more detailed ( and therefore more convincing ) explanation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thingscutinhalfporn/comments/2gqnve/earthscraper_planned_in_mexico_city_2539x1653/cklqboq ), 
  what is its effect ? 
  got to try this out . 
  you did n't know keks as a word for cookies/crackers ? 
  it 's one of the best things out there !, 
  we read fiction irl too , are n't we horrible ? 
  the real crime / u/cikedo committed was being rude . 
  then again , that second paragraph was hilarious .

  aww thanks !, 
  tbf we spent a hell of a lot of time in siberia . 
  the uralic people diverged around 3000 bc or so ( living in the urals for millennia prior ) , and hungarians only moved to the west side of the ural mountains in like the 4th century ad !, 
  for some reason , my [ context comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2gth4o/asians_in_hungary/ckmcito ) got buried, 
  it puzzles me , too , but i imagine if you ca n't even get a substantial consensus on proto-altaic , it 's difficult to compare it to proto-uralic . 
  no we definitely are genetically magyars in some part , but interbreeding with ( and occasionally getting raped by ) a whole lot of other people has reduced the portion of magyar genes to relatively little . 
  even by the time we got to europe , we had interbred with the indo-iranians . 
  i was snowcloning [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2gth4o/asians_in_hungary/ckmcito ) comic by / u/legitprivilege . 
  oh of course , everyone does that . 
  it 's just that the top comment is usually the context comment . 
  the point is , there is a continuous line of descent and ethnic identity going back to the stone age urals . 
  we * are * what happened to the magyars . 
  what you 're describing is more like that the magyar genes disappeared entirely long ago , and the hungarians are a bunch of slavs who adopted the culture secondhand . 
  but while our contact with many different peoples over the past three thousand years has reduced the portion of uralic genes in our population , they were never replaced wholesale , and we definitely still have some of them . 
  ( our high rate of suicide is [ evidence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugrian_suicide_hypothesis ) , albeit weak evidence , for this . ), 
  huh , you 're right , that 's weird . 
  but apparently the genes still are n't european , but central asian . 
  ( to be fair , the uralic genes * did * disappear into the local population . 
  but they 're very sparse , and the majority of our genes are turkic . ), 
  why 've they got to be women ? 
  your genome is n't made entirely of mitochondria !, 
  but then where did the uralic genes go ? 
  it 's not like the original magyars just randomly died out . 
  wait , i 've got it . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians#ethnic_affiliations_and_genetic_origins ) that we have about 5 % uralic dna . 
  but it cites [ this ] ( http://books.google.de/books?id=s4ojaqaaiaaj ) as a source , which i ca n't verify . 
  what i find surprising about those statistics , though , is that the occurrence of slavic and german genes is about 3 % and 1 % respectively . 
  you 'd expect it to be more . 
  ( also , tip : you need to escape the first backslash and first underscore to type that emoticon , typing ` \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ` ), 
  you make a good point but your entire comment is really , really ironic, 
  ah of course you can make a better punchline out of the same premise lol . 
  great job !, 
  no shit !, 
  keas in df are probably bigger, 
  austria , meanwhile , looks like a chicken * leg * . 
  huh . 
  post-gigapause readers exist ? 
  ironically , [ most languages are sov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subject%e2%80%93object%e2%80%93verb#incidence ) . 
  but if you rank by number of speakers rather than number of languages , svo probably dominates . 
  ( then again , modern programming languages usually put the function name first , and it 's not like vso languages are very common . ), 
  oh , man , super smash bros-based comics !, 
  what i 'd give for a website of those !, 
  what compelled you to start reading ? 
  and it must feel really bad to have `` missed out '' . 
  where 's this from ? 
  i was convinced until the end that the doctor and co had been hired as pentesters, 
  obviously this means that everything is run by reptilians, 
  eugenics is wrong because it 's terrible to take away someone 's ability to reproduce .
