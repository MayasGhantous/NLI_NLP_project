  it 's one of the things we value most as humans . 
  also , because whoever institutes eugenics would surely do so according to their own arbitrary , biased standards . 
  imagine being told you 're not allowed to reproduce because * someone else who does n't even know you * thinks you 're not good enough !, 
  sorry , i do n't have time or motivation to get into an argument about this , but trust me , eugenics is terrible !, 
  edit : also , recessive genes make the whole thing a crapshoot anyway if you 're trying to improve the traits of the future population . 
  well , the most obvious subtle hidden homestuck thing is the colors you used for them , and that 's probably my favorite thing about this . 
  great job , hope you get to add more stuff !, 
  so then how is this different from / r/gonewildstories ? 
  ( sorry , the opportunity just sort of presented itself ), 
  trailing zeroes are n't significant , this has exactly one significant figure, 
  [ yet ] ( # 4chan ), 
  english really is n't an agglutinative language like slavic languages , or uralic languages , or austronesian languages , or turkic languages , etc. 
  english has some suffixes and prefixes , but they 're relatively uncommon and usually are n't used in concert with one another . 
  for example , here 's a breakdown of one of the longest words in hungarian ( that was n't deliberately constructed to be long ) :, 
  - szents\u00e9g ** telen ** : lacking holiness ( adj ) ( holinessless ? ), 
  - szents\u00e9gtelen ** \u00edt ** : he/she/it makes lack holiness ( v ) ( it deholinessifies ? ), 
  - ** meg ** szents\u00e9gtelen\u00edt : he/she/it makes things/you lack holiness ( v ) ( it deholinessifies ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edt ** het ** : he/she/it can make things/you lack holiness ( v ) ( it can deholinessify ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthet ** etlen ** : unable to be made to lack holiness ( adj ) ( undeholinessifiable ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9g ** es ** : having the inability to be made to lack holiness ( adj ) ( undeholinessifiabilitous ? ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9ges ** ked ( ik ) ** : he/she/it is partaking in actions that make him/her/it have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off his/her/its inability to be made to lack holiness ( v ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked ** \u00e9s ** : ** the partaking in of ** actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9s ** e ** : ** his/her/its ** partaking in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9se ** i ** : his/her/its partaking ** s ** in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9sei ** tek ** : ** your ( pl ) ** partakings in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( n ), 
  - megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek ** \u00e9rt ** : ** for/on account of ** your ( pl ) partakings in of actions that make one have an inability to be made to lack holiness , or actions that show off one 's inability to be made to lack holiness ( adpositional phrase , sort of ), 
  i 'd already typed this up months ago for / r/linguistics ; it was just a matter of finding the right post and copying/pasting everything . 
  i know !, 
  but having them as a war chant is way more ominous than accordion music . 
  you idiot , that 's supposed to be a wooden bowl, 
  same way you invest in anything : buy it . 
  in order to have beef stock , you must buy and breed cows . 
  so , when the value of cows go up , you can sell them for less than you bought them for . 
  [ a link to uld3 would be nice ] ( http://www.uld3.org/ ), 
  and what resources are there for glossing ? 
  everything i 've found so far has been brief and/or uninformative . 
   like people do . 
  ehhh even that 's kind of dubious, 
  thank you for not mentioning hungary . 
  we 've only got one or two, 
   paying attention to how more experienced people use it, 
  this is really what i mean . 
  is there like a compendium of examples or something ? 
  i do n't read academic articles on linguistics in my spare time ( no time ) . 
  oh i 've read leipzig a ton of times , sorry . 
  what i mean is that even as it describes rules , it does n't really get across the details . 
  there 's two major problems i 've run into when glossing hungarian : how double agreement is treated , and how the possessed suffixes on nouns are treated . 
  or , what if i 've got to differentiate between different uses of the complementizer , which are treated syntactically differently in some languages ? 
  ( e.g. 
  in latin you do purpose clauses with `` ut '' but evidential clauses with an infinitive ) or the different uses of the subjunctive ? 
  not all of them have glossing abbreviations . 
  kids play the rpg that creates universes, 
  how does lyx work , then ? 
  never used it, 
  why 's your language got to use all the * second * most common vowels for their respective letters :(, 
  ( well , actually second most common for < i  is probably [ \u026a ] ), 
  milo + the doctor are a good match , seeing as though the doctor likes traveling and knows every language in existence , while milo likes traveling and is a linguist, 
  *** story time 's over wind bag whoops oh shit get this fuckin ' clock outta my way . 
  i am a one man stampede and i 've got a broom and that peal of splintering wood you hear is the last gasp of a priceless antique disintegrating beneath the outrageous fury of my authorial hooves . 
  ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005973 ), 
  change is n't what i 'm talking about . 
  what i mean is `` attracted to males in particular '' and `` attracted to females in particular '' and `` attracted to no one at all '' are n't complex enough descriptions to give a really accurate model of anyone 's sexuality . 
  the subset of people that people tend to be attracted to usually ca n't just be described as `` a subset of males '' or `` a subset of females '' , not the \u00b4 least because people ca n't just be divided into males and females anyway, 
  should the last three have the same ipa ? 
  like it, 
  bracket 's fine !, 
  you suck at apl though . 
  and why not use something readable like vxlisp anyway, 
   like i mentioned below , i 'm basically just learning enough to recycle and repurpose code for now . 
  i do want to delve deeper at a later date , but this project just needs to get off the table . 
  ohohoho not at all . 
  your code betrays an adequate knowledge of vx apl . 
  less than half of it looks copy/pasted from github !, 
  but for apl more than any other language , you 've got to learn how to structure your code well . 
  otherwise it 'll be the death of you . 
  but like i said apl totally sucks anyway , why not learn lisp ? 
   i 've head vxlisp recommended elsewhere as a good starting point , but the width of available configurations have me a little cautious . 
  i would n't really know where to begin on power configuring capacitance overheads for the delta wave modulation pre-loaders etc. 
  ah , do n't be intimidated by a little domain-specific language !, 
  vxlisp is very similar to ansi common lisp , and only has like one actually complicated macro ( namely ` interleave ` ) . 
  the rest are basically just functions tacked on and follow the pattern of every api for lisp ever . 
  here , you can use [ this ] ( http://www.p-cos.net/lisp/guide.html ) to get familiar with all the lispy stuff , and just fill in the rest from the vxlisp documentation . 
   would starting with something more student configured like livxe be fine , or just waste of time for when i inevitably move on ? 
  well , you * can * , and some people never even look outside of livxe , but in order to unlock the full expressive power of vx programming , you should really get familiar with some form of actual code yourself . 
  i personally never bothered with livxe in the first place , because i already knew how to program and figured learning a vx programming language would n't be too much harder . 
  ( and it really is n't , if you 're familiar with vx , too . ), 
  you definitely could use it , but imo it would always be a crutch . 
  edit : or you could always get the + + vx plugin for emacs if you 're into that , that 's kind of like livxe but you still need to be broadly familiar with a language, 
  this here folks is a shitty programmer . 
  because they do n't know how to do anything in lisp , they use interleave for everything , and then blame the language . 
  actual vxlisp code practically never uses interleave at all . 
  do you know you could say the same thing about ` loop ` ? 
  edit : to be actually helpful : you know you can use ` let ` to bind the oblidisk channels , right ? 
  well , until one or more of the species in it go extinct/lose their natural habitat, 
  then again , the police could have fallen for the posts of people falling for it . 
  `` broken-down '' is also used more broadly to mean `` in need of repair '' . 
  and weed, 
  aww , it 's adorable !, 
  not me , but my friend spammed the word `` homestuck '' all-caps to me over chat hundreds of times when he first found out about it . 
  i still regard it as a completely natural and reasonable reaction , but i 'm pretty sure he regrets it horribly now .
