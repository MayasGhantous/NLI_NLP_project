   also , at 3:48 of constant conquest , there 's a doctor bit . 
  [ he became a god tier obviously . 
  and a time lord !, 
  like the doctor !, 
  ( it 's probably a coincidence ), 
  it 's one of my favorite albums . 
  i liked power fantasy , carne vale , constant confinement , constant conquest , and eternity served cold , but they were all really good , actually . 
  i 'd like to hear more music with the same flow ( and perhaps instrumentation ) as carne vale or esc . 
  ( hey , just noticed , caliborn makes his escape as a song whose title is abbreviated esc plays . 
  100 % coincidental , but cool . ), 
  / r/learngerman, 
  is n't that the joke ? 
  fyi jeb & co always respawn at base if they die, 
  the border there is insane . 
  there are bengali enclaves * inside * indian enclaves in bangladesh !, 
  [ and one indian enclave inside a bengali enclave inside an indian enclave inside bangladesh . 
  why ? 
  so you can see the spit ? 
  i 've always wondered what some of these are for . 
  double subset ? 
  curly or ? 
  i heard about problem sleuth on a blog . 
  i got in just as it was ending . 
  then hs started and it was great . 
  but there 's practically no map projection where texas is bigger than alaska . 
  mercator inflates alaska , all the equal-area ones have it bigger , it still looks bigger on equirectangular , some of the compromises like dymaxion might have enough distortion to account for the difference ... no way . 
  when i went to transylvania , the hungarian bible belt , i met people who did n't believe in evolution , but they were surprisingly receptive to my explanations . 
  i wonder what makes texas different . 
  ( maybe i just sound more convincing because i 'm a molecular biologist ? ), 
  \\* forehead slap \\* that 'll do it, 
  no way , this is a perfect example of correctly drawing borders along ethnic lines . 
  [ congratulations , you 've coined a new word !, 
  maybe what 's different about it is everyone 's attitude towards it, 
  edit : i am become jaden smith , destroyer of words, 
  you have correctly identified what a power glove is good for, 
   an sbahj comic, 
  an `` es-bahj '' comic ? 
  `` is-bahj '' comic ? 
  do you speak a language which only allows one consonant at the onset of each syllable ? 
  it is !, 
  but i went to the part populated by hungarians, 
  sure , but who 's got the time to say five letters ? 
  i thought most people pronounced it like a word, 
  hah , i once knew a guy who collapsed his garage like that . 
  when he remodeled he made sure to reinforce the walls with aluminum, 
  \\  mfw virginia is a lawless wasteland, 
  how did he acquire the parallax converter in the first place ? 
  fake license ? 
  til nintendo was invented around the same time as the kilo . 
   it makes me wonder , seems like he was a decent kid who went down a bad road . 
  been seeing more and more of that lately . 
  recently in / r/medicine we [ found out about ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/2gdg3g/ucla_med_student_steals_ipad_from_dying_cancer/ ) a student who stole a dying patient 's ipad . 
  how do people this stupid get this far ? 
  maybe the guy became unstable after being unable to deal with the pressures of the field ? 
  is it more common in physics-related disciplines like vx ? 
  people who do bad things are all over , but you ca n't get this far on bad intentions alone . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  yeah, 
  but lowes and menards are n't orange . 
  obi is , though . 
  fair point , but you 'd expect the generalized term to describe all or most retail giants , since it 's a term used by a wide variety of people . 
  is hd all or most retail giants , though ? 
  :p xerox certainly is ( or was anyway ) all or most copying machines, 
  haha , etymology is one of the best things to discuss . 
  it seems weird to have people talking about big orange retail giants who have never seen one , but i guess it 's about as weird as people in the philippines talking about `` mga kotse '' who have never heard of the hungarian village of kocs nor the fact that it produced the first springed coach . 
  ( and the word for the village itself came from siberia , so it did almost a full loop ! ), 
  dude i was going to be like `` lol welcome to vx '' but you are taking it way the hell too far . 
  no man was ever meant to accumulate so much vx equipment by themselves . 
  right now it is imperative that you do at least one of these things :, 
  *** the bills are millions of dollars for a reason . 
  vx is a growing field and there 's plenty of sources of funding right now even with the cuts . 
  i do n't care if you think of it only as a hobby ; * this is how you get financed . 
  * going it without funding would be like a computing enthusiast buying one of those petaflop supercomputers for a jillion bucks and expecting that it 's a reasonable purchase he could make by himself . 
  - * use your existing equipment to finance yourself . 
  * people will pay you to perform experiments with your vx , one way or another . 
  you could start a youtube channel showcasing particularly interesting vx experiments . 
  you could auction off time on your setup to small research laboratories , who would most likely be willing to pay for it ( it 's far cheaper for them to just buy time with your stuff than buy their own ; what kind of especially specialized equipment do you have ? 
  this may be your lifeline ) . 
  if possible , you might be able to rig it with a gpu to mine bitcurrencies ; the tertiary thermostabilizers and the chronomodulator give you a huge advantage , at the cost of gargantuan amounts of electricity . 
  - * sell stuff . 
  * yes , it 's very sad . 
  i , too , hold all of my vx parts dear , and i would be loathe to sell them . 
  but dude . 
  $ 3 mil . 
  your life and livelihood is far , far more important . 
  i suggest selling everything that nobody will pay time to use , unless they 're drops in the bucket like a quasi-diamagnetic chamber or something . 
  look at vx labs first ; they 're usually the ones willing to pay the most money for this kind of stuff . 
  then , if you 've got any parts in mint condition , ferrotune at least has an rma policy , and i do n't think you could have accumulated so much stuff so quickly without ordering a shit-ton from them . 
  then craigslist , then ebay . 
  - * ask for money from the internet . 
  * a kickstarter probably would n't work unless you can get them something fantastic like unique souveniers made via transmutation sculpting , or personalized vx experiments , or a piece of your setup , but there 's people in lots of places who would be happy to help . 
  hell , even this sub i think could totally raise a small fortune for you .
