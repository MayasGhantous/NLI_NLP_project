  but it 's terrible humor . 
  `` hahaha !, 
  there 's a news article/study about something obvious ! '', 
  it 's not much of a joke , since it happens a lot irl already anyway ( for good reason ) . 
  punchlines have got to be unexpected ; that 's when it works best . 
  thank you , i 've been trying to remember the name of this guy for months !, 
  yeah , but it does n't make sense in the context of the equation . 
  the curve appears to be described by the equation z = sin ( sqrt ( x ^ 2 + y ^ ( 2 ) ) ) / sqrt ( x ^ 2 + y ^ ( 2 ) ) . 
  no z 's on the right side at all !, 
  it 's probably just a simple mistake . 
  edit : please do n't downvote the guy above me . 
  why would he deserve it ? 
  god , it was a joke . 
  many of my ancestors were killed by the nazis ( although more were killed by the soviets but w/e ) . 
  does that make the comparison between the history of gema and its current state any less funny ? 
  i do n't think so !, 
  wow poor guy , i feel very sorry for him . 
  while the fact that he does n't seem to be finished at all makes me worry that there will be another gigapause ( or even just megapause ) , i 'm very glad that we get to finish homestuck normally , rather than in one big blast . 
  having updates and an active fandom again will be very fun . 
  good luck , hussie !, 
  ( also he got the etymology of `` gigantic '' wrong . 
  both `` giga '' and `` gigantic '' come from greek `` gigas '' , meaning `` monster '' . ), 
  you 're actually amazing at drawing, 
  what you can do sometimes to get a particular `` sound '' is to look up the phonology of the target language and see what syllables are acceptable under it , based on the syllable structure and phoneme inventory . 
  for sanskrit or hindi in particular , though , the rules are very unfortunately complicated . 
  but even when that 's the case , you can fall back on a phonology generator like [ gleb ] ( http://000024.org/cgi-bin/gleb.cgi ) and just retry until you get something that sounds like what you like . 
  hah , you could have drawn the byzantines trying the same thing on everyone who lived in eastern europe at the time . 
  also all the people who `` colonized '' southeast asia in the 16th century with their respective properties , although most of the south was already using arabic anyway . 
  you 're underestimating the number of people who would gladly replace one of the letters in their word with a number, 
   shut up you infidels !, 
  anyone know whether nk also has that superstition ? 
  ( inb4 `` they do n't have fans huehuehuehue '' ), 
  in high school biology in the us , they do n't make you memorize the * citric acid cycle * ^ [ 1 ] ( anymore ? ) . 
  i had to make my sister memorize it myself !, 
   your basically asking what problems is the community to lazy to have solved already ,, 
  not necessarily , and i 'm sorry if the implication offended anyone . 
  ( i really did n't expect this post to go over so well ! ), 
  i 'm just asking which ones you have n't gotten to yet , since i get the impression that there 's a lot of them and not a lot of you . 
   never mind your question annoyed me an instead of being a passive aggressive dick i am going to be a confrontational dick instead . 
  you 're not a dick at all !, 
  you 're very nice . 
  ( how can you be on reddit and think * this * is being a dick ? ), 
  thank you for your input !, 
  it makes it a lot more complicated than [ word ] # [ word ] , though . 
  the space of 6 , 7 , and 8 letter words is pretty big ( although possibly not bigger than the space of 3 and 4 letter words squared ) . 
  yeah , because it 's so easy to put teenagers to bed at 10 o'clock ? 
  the only plausible sci-fi explanation i can think of is their minds being saved to a database ( a la * forest of the dead * ) . 
  in which case it * could * be paradise in a sense . 
  ( and missy could also be river but urrgh i hope not . ), 
  this is great , awesome job !, 
  must have been made by dwarves, 
  biologist here , i know how you feel . 
  fun fact , for sestertii at least , you can use the dollar sign , and it 's even considered a minor hypothesis for the etymology of the sign . 
  my problem 's that it 's * missing * things . 
  how do i search ? 
  post it !, 
   schizophrenia ca n't really be proved by anything empirical , there are just behavioural markers for it . 
  behavioral markers * are * empirical , though . 
  `` empirical '' just means anything that behaves differently in the presence of the phenomenon . 
  and talking about losing touch with reality is pretty much a dead giveaway , is n't it ? 
  m\u00e1r l\u00e1ttad a [ `` great digg vs reddit war '' ] ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1002990 ) komikot ? 
  in `` the shakespeare code '' , ws said he might use that . 
   grace note, 
  sorry for doing this and it 's quite alright if you do n't want to answer , but , in the interest of documenting language and how people use it , what does the phrase `` grace note '' mean to you and where do you think it comes from ? 
  how much have you been exposed to this term , and by whom ? 
  thanks !, 
  you might even say he exaggerates * all the time !, 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about shitty art , you hornses ass ? 
  ill have you know i graduated bottom of my class at the new england institute of art , and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on goggles , and i have over 300 confirmed eyerapes . 
  i am not trained in mouse drawing and im the worst artist in all of tumblr . 
  you are nothing to me but just another reference image . 
  i will draw a jpeg of you with imprecision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fuckass . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across / co / and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , shithead . 
  the storm that wipes out the conksucky little thing you call your eyes . 
  youre fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i cant draw you in over seven hundred ways , and thats just with the spray tool . 
  not only am i extensively untrained in armless cartoons , but i have access to the entire arsenal of photoshop 's filters and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the canvas , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what low-res retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you couldnt , you didnt , and now youre paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit jpeg all over you and you will drown in it . 
  youre fucking dead , kiddo . 
  every time you use xfags as a demonym , your future self cries :(, 
  `` these people '' would have worked there . 
  they 're such a prominent group that `` people who 've only read hivebent '' is too inconvenient to refer to them ? 
  sorry , telling people how to speak is a bad habit to get into ( because you quash beautiful new constructions such as this one ) , but `` i fucking despise ... fags '' implies really terrible things to anyone who 's heard `` fag '' as a derogatory term . 
  adding - fag would be a cool and interesting new way to form demonyms if it were a neutral term , but context unfortunately makes it not so, 
  alright , thank you , just curious !, 
  sometimes people pick a metaphor up and do n't know the original context , which can lead to them having interesting ideas about the origin of the expression . 
  you may have done that for someone today !, 
  this is the correct answer, 
  what 's `` ebin '' mean , `` evil '' ? 
  it was also in sbahj, 
  only parts of it, 
  yes he totally does . 
  he even mentioned it in the latest news update . 
  and have you seen his humanimals strips ? 
  guy writes about horses all the time , it 's a persistent obsession, 
  source ?
