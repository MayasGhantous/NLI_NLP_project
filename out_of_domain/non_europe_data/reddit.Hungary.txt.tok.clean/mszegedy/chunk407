  the base temporarily holds one of the protons , allowing the electrons to rearrange themselves , and then sticks the proton on somewhere else . 
  that is super cool !, 
  enzymes bond with their substrates too ; see for example [ how thermolysin probably cleaves proteins . 
  ] ( http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/@api/deki/files/10505/scheme_3.png ) what i find weird about non-biochemical catalysts is that they 're much less organized than proteins , whose structure explains their function . 
  but i guess this is just a consequence of never studying non-biochemical catalysis ; this kind of mechanism now seems obvious in hindsight . 
  that lego molecule you mentioned must be really neat !, 
  must have taken a hell of a lot of organic chemistry to synthesize it . 
  q1 : did n't really not like any of the books i 've read, 
  q2 : my bookcase, 
  q3 : my tv, 
  q4 : my computer, 
  q5 : does continuously realizing [ `` nothing 's different anywhere '' ] ( http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1384 ) count ? 
   things fall apart, 
  it remains my only insight into pre-european bantu culture , or in general any culture whatsoever in pre-european sub-saharan africa , and thus i treasure it, 
   study . 
  on / r/homestuck, 
   racist . 
  you read it wrong , the whole thing was tongue-in-cheek, 
  it sounds way better that way, 
  i like its ability to interpret the confused , mistyped , abbreviated expressions i type into it , like `` cosx and siny for ( x , y ) = ( 0,1 '' , but sometimes it ca n't do things that gnuplot can , like `` fit a \\* log ( x + b ) + c to ( 1,10 ) , ( 2,20 ) , and ( 3,30 ) via a , b , and c '' . 
  come on , just one !, 
  what 's titan 's atmosphere like ? 
  you could include that instead of mercury 's lack-of-an-atmosphere, 
  it provides a source of nitrogen for our biomolecules . 
  without our nitrogen , you would n't be able to have dna or proteins . 
  it inconveniently needs to be converted to nitrates before use , though , which does n't happen very often . 
  ( i guess in a big-picture sense , the equilibrium is balanced overly in favor of nitrogen gas . ), 
  nah , there 's not a lot of us, 
  does this mean if i pop a balloon , the gas goes to space ? 
  i use fighters for recon, 
  i thought it was in seattle, 
  it 's just volume . 
  spend more time on reddit to get more karma . 
  ( but please do n't actually spend more time on reddit . 
  go do something interesting instead . ), 
  but political scientists are n't scientists , so that rule does n't apply to them, 
  things that are n't science :, 
  - economics and game theory, 
  - political science, 
  - math and computer science, 
  things that are science :, 
  - physics, 
  - biology, 
  things that try the hardest to be science but ultimately fall short :, 
  - psychology, 
  - sociology, 
  ^ ( ( inb4 people not realizing this is a joke ) ^ ), 
  very obvious , but what 's interesting is the ratio of 2:1 . 
  you 'd expect it to be a lot more , since a male can impregnate multiple females per day , but a female can only become pregnant every 9 months . 
  this is great !, 
  mostly a story that could be told with any people , but not entirely devoid of commentary on international relations here either !, 
  i think it 's avatar episodes ; it says `` dvd '' in the top right, 
  i personally do n't want to throw in atmospheres where parachutes do n't open up with atmospheres where they do . 
  have you seen other hobby subs , though ? 
  none of them are as venemous as this one . 
  i keep coming back here because this is the only major online vx community i know of , but honestly i really do n't like the comments here . 
  * everybody 's * always doing something wrong , even if it 's so minor it would n't sensibly affect anything . 
  * nobody * has the right gear . 
  we get `` what the hell are you guys doing '' posts monthly . 
  we should all try and be a little bit nicer . 
  post it !, 
  everybody would love to see it . 
  completely unusable on mobile, 
  if you 're talking about the meal i think you 're talking about ( `` tat\u00e1r bifsztek '' in hungarian ) , then at least you got to experience the fat !, 
  although that may have been buried under all the spices . 
  also , did you try any `` normal '' tatar ever ? 
  it 's already ungodly delicious , especially if the sirloin was cut that day . 
  well , `` bombing the spiders to contain their spread '' might make sense as a plot , if it looks like there 's no other option . 
  it 'd be typical doctor who writing , though , with a mechanic clearly invented specifically to raise the stakes . 
  hopefully the justification will be more interesting . 
  stone ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  objectively , there 's 1 nbar 's worth of gases on mercury . 
  but i do n't care about it like i do about earth 's atmosphere or venus 's atmosphere , because there 's very little of it . 
  neither of us are !, 
  we 're culturally ... slav-ish , in the sense of czech/slovak/poland . 
  but even that 's not quite accurate, 
  sure , but i 'd rather it not be presented next to earth 's atmosphere , which is totally different in scale . 
  hopefully no one takes * this * seriously, 
  and our word for curve is `` g\u00f6rbe '' , [ ` g\u00f8rb\u025b ] , coming from latin `` curva '' , [ ` kurwa ] , meaning `` curve '' . 
  ( because hungarian is 50 % loanwords ) . 
  also possibly related is our word for circle , `` k\u00f6r '' , [ k\u00f8r ] , which comes from latin `` c\u014dr '' , [ ko : r ] , meaning `` heart '' . 
  the two latin words may or may not share etymology . 
  i coulda sworn i saw it in a contest entry somewhere or something . 
  my favorite is sticking `` rhubarb '' where rubidium goes . 
  [ ` sint\u00e6ks ] and [ ` v\u00e6nt\u0259s ] sound the same ? 
  ( sorry for the poor man 's ipa ; i 'm on a phone ), 
  those two are mutually incompatible, 
  the dreambubble act 6 parts were a lot more boring than the rest of homestuck . 
  really , most of act 6 . 
  it felt like taking a vacation from the plot . 
  hopefully things will get interesting now . 
  ( really , they already have . ), 
  [ s ] and [ v ] are kind of a stretch , especially since they are voiced differently . 
  [ \u026a ] and [ \u00e6 ] are reasonable ; in my native language ( hungarian ) they are cast to the same vowel , [ < epsilon  ] , when code-switching . 
  [ ks ] does tend to eventually transform into [ s ] , but that 's still quite a stretch ( a several-hundred-year stretch ) . 
  [ \u00e6 ] and [ \u0259 ] are pretty different , though , and i do n't think i 've ever heard [ 's \u026ant\u0259ks ] . 
  if both were true , then the strilondes would have switched genders when they godtiered, 
  but we saw them as babies, 
  but they all literally looked like younger copies of themselves .
