  i do n't know if you 've ever known any trans people , but the physical changes they make are n't exactly subtle . 
  even ignoring that , though , who hands out sex-change therapy/ops to < 12-year-olds ? 
  depends :, 
  - ** acts 1-3 : ** hahahah another page on this cool webcomic i follow , this is pretty sweet, 
  - ** act 4 : ** hooray more plot , i love plot, 
  - ** act 5 act 1 : ** oh yeah homestuck updated, 
  - ** act 5 act 2 : ** yessssssss , more homestuck !, 
  i love these, 
  - ** act 6 proper : ** hooray more plot , i love plot, 
  - ** act 6 intermissions : ** oh yeah homestuck updated, 
  - ** eoa flashes : ** it 's here !, 
  it 's finally here !, 
  wow , it 's so awesome !, 
  - ** game flashes/html5s : ** coooooooool \\* spends next 2 hours playing it \\*, 
  - ** hussie self-inserts : ** why did you stop the plot you bastard, 
  i tended to like the hussie self-inserts , but i was always anxious to get back to the plot, 
  i 'm stupid , i did n't even notice it was an adaptation of * frozen *, 
  ah , that makes sense then . 
  in that case it 's technically possible , which is all you need for headcanon !, 
  ( although i still find it counterintuitive , since their appearances do n't change at all ) why the strilondes in particular , btw ? 
  i 'd love it if this became a reality . 
  hs is so huge and interesting ; it definitely deserves an annotated version . 
  what i 'd be most interested in recording is each page 's `` history '' ; for example , noting on cascade that it it took a multi-month hiatus to write it and that when it was posted it crashed megaupload and newgrounds , or that a certain set of flashes had different music until the artist had an argument with hussie and pulled all their music from the comic . 
  also their influences , like how trickster mode from the flashes became a plot element , and how the `` caucasian '' page was supposed to poke fun at the racial controversy surrounding hs , and how you can meet the earthbound kids in one flash , and how homestuck in general is inspired in part by earthbound , etc. 
  lure them into your territory , and wait for the winter to finish them off !, 
  why would they deserve bad things to happen to them ? 
  it 's not like not wearing a seatbelt is intrinsically evil or anything . 
  they deserve education or something, 
  when this happens , in my experience it 's a sign that something is deeply bothering them . 
  normal people enjoy life for the long term . 
  ( currently in this state . 
  i do not wish it on anyone , but it 's marginally better than depression , i 'll give it that . ), 
  tbf they trust their government about as far as they can throw it , so you 're on to something anyway, 
  yes , attractive and successful people are role models, 
  yeah , i said it was better than depression , not the same thing as it, 
  dead pixels are a whole lot more annoying , you keep noticing this little thing out of the corner of your eye and maybe rubbing it to get it off because you 're not sure if it 's the dead pixel or a dust mote . 
  you keep coming back to this one point and it drives you crazy, 
  good god , even as a cartoon , those power puff fetuses are horrifying, 
  never mind , i found an [ absurdly old flag ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bronze_flag,_shadad_kerman,_iran.jpg ) for them . 
  no , the hardest are intercal and malbolge . 
  brainfuck is actually similar to assembly in its instruction set ; just assembly can do a lot more . 
  coding in assembly is not a whole lot harder than coding in other languages ( if you know the architecture ; examining it is half the fun anyway ) . 
  that said , it 's still hard , and he coded a whole game by itself . 
  that deserves mad props . 
  what i did n't expect is for the ice to be over a river rather than a lake . 
  then again , what sorts of lakes have brick walls next to them ? 
  ( although i 've seen a few . ), 
  it was gon na get out anyway within like 10 seconds of the update being released, 
  [ usa ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ single neighbor ] ( #green - text ), 
  edit : i 'm an idiot, 
  of course canada only has one neighbor . 
  one of my favorite polandball comics is when he sets some irrelevant arab country ( iraq ? ), 
  on fire for bullying some other irrelevant country ( iran ? 
   like tone ? 
  awesome , it 's in odki . 
  hate tone ? 
  awesome , it 's only in the vocative case . 
  a rising pitch and a falling pitch on an / o / . 
  as simple as that . 
  sounds like sentence-level tone in most other languages !, 
  they look almost exactly the same size to me, 
   another egg being made in 10 seconds in unfeasable . 
  * that 's * your complaint about realism ? 
  how about violation of the law of conservation of mass , or the fact that it lives in space but uses wings ? 
  ( not that solar sails do n't exist , but these * flap * ), 
  so far this is the comment that i 've read that makes the episode the most tolerable to me . 
  this is a fair interpretation of the episode , and makes everyone 's motivations make sense . 
  not sure if this was what they were going for , though . 
  that point can be lost on the authors , although imo there 's not much difference, 
  well , handles , in a sense ... 
  i do n't think not helping was the right thing for him to do . 
  the only good reason for letting people do stuff instead of you ( when you 're better at it than them ) is for them to get better at it , but how did this make humans better at crises in any way ? 
  the astronaut will die before getting another chance to make a decision like this , and clara travels with the doctor , so she 'll always have him around ( and if she does n't , it 's not like she needs lessons in self reliance ) . 
  courtney would have been the best person to do it for , since apparently she became president or something . 
  she did n't have much/any effect on the final outcome , though , and the doctor probably knew that that would happen . 
  ( at this point i should probably just go look up the actual war ), 
  that episode had a single ridiculous break from reality to set up a cheesy gag . 
  those are fine in my book . 
  building the entire plot out of nonsensium , though , so that the viewer feels cheated by the reveal , is unacceptable . 
  okay ty, 
  i 'll take your word for it !, 
  i knew what the dispute was about , just not who was involved . 
  eh , that 's a very complicated question . 
  hungary , germany , new jersey , japan , singapore , california . 
  [ tu quid amice ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png ), 
  who cares about north slavistan , the germanics , and the baltic . 
  so , what , like in that thought experiment with the train , the difference between changing the course of the train to kill people , vs pushing someone in front of the train ? 
  one 's more in your face , yeah , but in other ways they 're not too different . 
  a possible major difference is that by the time the baby is born there 's less of a reason to kill it , since the whole pregnancy already happened . 
  i do n't care much , if they think that that makes a better story , then they can have it . 
  the only thing i have trouble with are logically impossible headcanons ; stupid example , john 's text is both red and blue at the same time . 
  john never godtiered but he did godtier . 
  the beforus universe was made by a session not shown in the comic , but it was made by caliborn 's session . 
  stuff like that . 
  magic seems to work that way ? 
  almost everything seems to have a counter / `` opposite '' . 
  for example , frigideiro vs thermos , somnium or stupefy vs innervate , curses vs shields vs curses that go through those shields , polyjuice vs polyfluis reverso , legilimency vs occlumency , etc. 
  first language i tried , nenets , did n't work . 
  no but actually this is an awesome tool and i 'd love to see it grow .
