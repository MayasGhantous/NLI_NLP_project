  providing transcriptions and multiple samples would be ideal . 
  great job , and i look forward to what this will develop into !, 
  edit dammit no mansi either . 
  you have a long way to go !, 
  thanks !, 
  oops . 
  thank you , fixed . 
  no , i mean they headcanon two contradictory things * at the same time . 
  * contradicting the comic is okay , but contradicting yourself does n't make sense . 
  edit : i swear , this sub did n't used to be so downvote-happy . 
  what * happened ? 
  lookit all that fluid dynamics , wow, 
  hah , i recognize your username . 
  do you do any other kinds of development besides php ? 
  but do other languages besides php throw the hebrew error ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  anyway good luck with web dev !, 
  for literally every protein inside them , yes, 
  ! remindme 18 days `` wish / u/humblemanatee a happy birthday '', 
  huh, 
  sure !, 
  gim me a few days though . 
  i currently do not own a microphone . 
  aww , you too, 
  no , people believe plenty of things that do n't contradict each other, 
  once you do get into it , hungarian etymology is a deep rabbit hole and suddenly you know everything about hungarian history . 
  a uralic base , from the magyar invasion , but with many fundamental words from turkic ( like the personal pronouns , dammit ) , from the 100-year ottoman occupation and the avar occupation and the fact that we 're turkic , many german loanwords and transliterations due to our close ties with the habsburgs , many , many slavic loanwords simply because they are our neighbors , and a mound of latin letters and loanwords , and even a way of forming future passive participles , because of the byzantines . 
  and then you go and learn german and latin and slovak and turkish and proto-uralic and nenets and mansi , and you know the etymology of * every * hungarian word and approximately when it became part of the language , and you even construct a version of hungarian as if the magyars had stayed in the ural mountains on the siberian side . 
  but then you think about what the etymology of the word for `` big '' is and discover it 's unkown and then you realize everything you know is a big lie and you resolve to forget the whole thing . 
  that 's what hungarian etymology 's like . 
  i can find good things about every language i learn , but usually the closer they are to my heart the more i like them . 
  - ** hungarian : ** highly agglutinative , simple syllable structure , topic-prominent , has non-indo-european base but is full of euro loanwords , rarely has copula ( in fact , the copula can be modeled as a pronoun in most cases ) , has three levels of deixis , possessive suffixes , limited polypersonal agreement ( the only dedicated polypersonal suffix is first person subject , second person object , stemming from a first person dual suffix ) , genderless , has vowel harmony , conveniently similar to tagalog, 
  - ** tagalog : ** highly agglutinative , simple phonology , topic-prominent , has non-indo-european base but is full of euro loanwords , has no copula , has three levels of deixis , has isolated possessive suffixes , has a polypersonal pronoun ( the only dedicated polypersonal pronoun is first person subject , second person object , stemming from a first person dual pronoun ) , genderless , has reduplication , conveniently similar to hungarian, 
  - ** english : ** weird and cool phonology , has a hilarious textspeak register with many dialects ( its numbers sounding like common syllables might have been the best thing to happen to english ) , spoken by very many people, 
  - ** german : ** best phonology ever, 
  - ** finnish : ** practically a copy of proto-uralic , has vastly different registers for speaking and writing , amazingly expressive verb conjugation , genderless, 
  - ** mansi : ** closest living relative to hungarian, 
  - ** nenets : ** samoyedic language that accidentally developed the same way as hungarian, 
  - ** czech 'n' slovak : ** `` str\u010d prst skrz krk '' is onomatopoeia for what it describes, 
  \\  not liking / \u00e6 /, 
  well i guess [ finnish ] ( http://youtu.be/tcg01qcpkr4 ) and all the nordic languages can go fuck themselves then, 
  gib backstory pls, 
  years and days are arbitrary because our planet and solar system are n't unique . 
  the only truly universal measurements of time in our universe are planck-seconds , the age of the universe , and the ages of certain other universal things ( i.e. 
  everything in [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/history_of_the_universe.svg ) ) . 
  you can also do the lifetimes of various unstable particles , and , as speeds , the speeds of photons and neutrinos . 
  speaking of photons , you could do the inverse of their frequency when imbued with a unit of planck energy , but that 's just 2pi planck seconds . 
  if you * are * focusing on a particular planet , then here 's some stuff :, 
  - the amount of time it takes for the star it orbits to [ switch magnetic poles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stellar_magnetic_field ) ( for the sun that 's 11 years or so ), 
  - orbital periods and rotational periods of other planets in the solar system, 
  - not a time , but a speed : the speed of the drift of various continents on the planet, 
  - the age of the planet , or the time that passed in the universe before the planet started existing, 
  - ditto for the star, 
  what i found more disappointing about the episode is that the choice was framed that way in the first place . 
  in such a situation , the * very first thing * you do is try and save both . 
  and historically , the doctor has known that , and has successfully avoided sacrificing people . 
  now , to be fair , the doctor is absent here , which is fine , but that this was never even mentioned as an option ( and ended up being the case anyway ) is a little infuriating . 
  as a result the `` lesson '' of the episode becomes far weaker , and the problem that you described is created . 
  would n't the fact that boisik looks terrible be rather evidence of how unusable metafont is rather than how great computer modern ( or metafont , or knuth ) is ? 
  it 's a * little * cute , but the analogy does n't work for a whole lot of reasons . 
  nevertheless , this is probably going up on my and my coworkers ' wall . 
  if they 're looking at the frequencies of photons , they 're not likely to find photons with plack second frequencies ; that 's literally the highest frequency they can have . 
  if they 're confined to a planet then probably reasonable reference frequencies for them to have are significant frequencies in their sun 's emission spectrum . 
  for example , [ our sun ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/solar_spectrum_en.svg ) has distinct frequencies at about 500 nm and about 1000 nm and a few other places , which translate to times of about 1.5 and 3 femtoseconds respectively . 
   they 're writing episodes to service characters , which we have n't seen them do in a very long time . 
  aw , come on , how much time has it been since `` the girl who waited '' ? 
  they are more frequent though , which is good, 
  op said `` ion '' is `` i do n't '' and `` eem '' is `` even '' , so it 's a pretty safe bet, 
  enthusiasts ? 
  also people with other stuff on their mind than concise communication, 
  but it 's dying , unfortunately, 
  that was probably the point, 
  do these 7/8 equations have anything to do with `` 6 to go '' from the earlier chapter ? 
  or does that refer to `` six more dark science people to go before kimiko can go scot-free '' ? 
  there appear to be a lot more than 6 , but maybe not all of them are important, 
  but as any euiv player knows , it did used to be a fairly powerful long-lasting sovereign state, 
  i can imagine myself doing the same thing , given the circumstances ... although i 'd probably just cut out the middleman and kill myself, 
  i did not like the episode , sorry . 
  problems :, 
  - main reveal was outside the realm of possibility for a doctor who episode , and thus made the plot feel very jerky and badly paced ( going straight from `` no clue what 's happening '' to `` every clue what 's happening '' ) . 
  when unphysical things happen in doctor who , you expect an unphysical , `` applied phlebotinum '' explanation ; e.g. 
  i liked the `` gravity bomb '' explanation . 
  but this looked for all the world like it was claiming to be an actual biological process . 
  maybe more foreshadowing and better handwaving could have solved it ? 
  `` we 've always detected heat in the moon 's interior , but it did n't make sense . 
  now that we have the technology , we can also see that there 's void particles here , which means that there 's some sort of dimensional incursion ... '', 
  - i felt that clara 's yelling was entirely justified , but i did n't understand why the doctor left in the first place . 
  historically he 's ( almost ) always been willing to help , being a responsible person who knows that doing things yourself is usually your best bet to have things come out right . 
  even after he explained it , i did n't quite see how he arrived at that action . 
  thus , the character-oriented dialogue felt weak . 
  this is probably just peculiar to me , but i do wish the doctor had n't been so abript about it . 
  - i do n't like the limited choices explored in the episode . 
  the very first thing you do when you have to choose between two bad things is to see whether you can avoid * both * , and nobody even considered that , even though that would be routine for at least the doctor , and would be a very important lesson to teach for the episode . 
  here , what they could have done is realize that since this moon is only 100 million years old , there must have been another hatching event 100 million years ago ( since earth has had a moon for billions of years ) . 
  there was no mass extinction 100 million years ago , qed this one is n't going to cause one either . 
  - lundvik was a flat character throughout the whole episode , and could have been replaced with a chatterbot that promotes lunicide . 
  even her admission at the end did n't look like a change of heart . 
  she was not interesting , and felt very cardboard . 
  i like the fact that the doctor and clara have had a falling-out . 
  hopefully the next episode is companion-lite , and then we get some sort of juicy reconciliation .
