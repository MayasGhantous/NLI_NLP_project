  it is obviously that your a foggot, 
  the fuck are those . 
  this is what i did to my sister . 
  ... that 's actually a really good comparison . 
  i do n't consider myself to be a fan , because the people that call themselves fans are too weird . 
  do n't even talk to me about xkcd . 
  how about facebook ? 
  i have n't understood the purpose and popularity of tumblr until you explained it just now , but now it makes sense . 
  but i still do n't understand facebook . 
  do you have a sufficiently-scathing explanation of that as well ? 
  i 'd love to think i 'm better than the people that use it as well . 
  ... that started off as an entirely friendly ( perhaps a tad conspirational ) post . 
  how did it get so sarcastic so quickly ? 
  but anyway , i really do n't know about facebook . 
  could you please summarize that as well ? 
  right after the post in which it was agreed hpon that equius is the least cosplayed troll . 
  good going !, 
  i do n't understand what it 's for , and why it has so many damn users . 
  edit : i thought he was referring to facebook , gim me a break . 
  you have to go into regedit and create the registry `` oembackground '' in a certain folder ( i think it was under key_user \\ software \\ microsoft \\ windows \\ somethingtodowithgui ? 
  somewhere ? 
  you 're gon na have to look this up ) , and then navigate to a corresponding folder ( i think it 's windows \\ system32 \\ oobe \\ backgrounds ; do n't worry about them not existing , just create them ) and drop the pic in there . 
  it must be below 255 kb and be a jpg , though . 
  how can you say it is college-level ? 
  more apt would be `` middle-school '' . 
  it serves only as a soapbox for the author 's opinions , while catering to those who believe it makes them `` nerds '' to know what linux is . 
  i thought your previous post was for a post i made about facebook . 
  no , i know exactly why xkcd is so popular . 
  which is why i hate it . 
  munroe likes to just drop as many references as possible so as to make people think they 're awesome to understand it . 
  it 's kind of a vicious circle . 
  munroe finds something that he thinks most of his fanbase knows , and puts it in a webcomic . 
  and then that whatever is instantly niche and his viewers are savvy geniuses for recognizing it . 
  just ... goddamn it . 
  wait , read my edit first !, 
  thank you !, 
  this has fulfilled all of my expectations and more !, 
  `` you 're sure gon na miss him ! '', 
  console yourself with the fact that he lives on in every single thought that jack noir ever has about kibbles . 
  what arn ` et i recgonizing ?? 
  i feel so proud of myself, 
  everyone keeps saying that !, 
  and i ca n't draw for shit , either ( for scenes , all i know is that i should start with the very foreground and continue on into the background ) . 
  i have adobe illustrator , and i 'm usually a master at adobe products ( my photoshops and flashes and fireworkses are unreal ) , but i can make neither head nor tail of it . 
  even my pencil sketches turn out to be pretty much shit ( i ca n't draw a straight fucking line ) . 
  we should start a mspa art fund , for art classes for people like you and me . 
  it would be, 
  epic, 
  i like how your hand is screaming . 
  and i respect that . 
  \\* twitch *, 
  ( i was kidding . 
  what i mean is , that 's the response that i 'd get from most people . 
  maybe i know the wrong people ? ), 
  so do i !, 
  except big bang theory is watched by even less intelligent people ( this is not saying much ; the average xkcd fan is i think pretty intelligent ; it 's just the self-gratification i ca n't stand ) . 
  i thought the point of big bang theory was that you * did n't * get the things , though ? 
  what about all of the countless variations of dave who did due ? 
  insofar as we can say dave to have dies , we cam say davesprite to have done so , for acceptanly loose definitions of `` have died '' . 
  no , it still is . 
  aha , okay , i just assumed that that was where the quest beds of those players were . 
  though , the crypt bed is n't round ; rose and dave 's are squarish like the other kids ' quest beds . 
  aradia 's is round because quest cocoons are round . 
  i know this because i have seen cascade more times than i 've slept with your mother ( which is , admittedly technically true ) . 
  of course , definitely . 
  i assumed it was made by the same person and they added scenery for the enderman . 
  i was * always * happy to hear it . 
  a lot of times my cartridges did n't take on the first time i jammed them in . 
  i was laughing my ass off throughout the entire thing . 
  so now we know what is up with those potions . 
  [ just how ] ( / dunkass ) [ h ] ( / tg ) [ i ] ( / ta ) [ g ] ( / gg ) [ h ] ( / gt ) [ do you have to be to have all this ** blood ** ] ( / dunkass ), 
  if i had a nickel for every time i said something to that effect ... 
  i have n't read it in days !, 
  that is , i keep forgetting to read it . 
  i did n't think the author would ever make anything like this . 
  but it exists . 
  he was being sarcastic ? 
  tennant will always be my favorite . 
  to be fair , [ matt smith does n't look like matt smith in the picture either . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/billy_zane ), 
  because this generally does n't happen when distinguishing between white people . 
  now , yes . 
  no u asrehoal beong christian is ** wrong **, 
  are you a student of german ? 
  i know decent german , but the language i study is latin . 
  my native language is hungarian , however . 
  we have uncountably many cases ( the `` i lost count at twenty-six '' kind ) , all having to do with prepositions . 
  the instrumental case , also part of hungarian , simply means `` with '' , excepting the sense in which it is used with a person , in which case it is sociative , which is also a case in hungarian . 
  noun case is a funnily abstract thing . 
  you can invent a million , if you like , to fullfill whatever order you may have for your noun . 
  they can indicate morphosyntactic alignment . 
  they may indicate a prepositional clause . 
  they may * replace * a prepositional clause . 
  the case is defined by the inflection of the noun in a particular situation , rather than the cases defining the situations wherein a noun can reside . 
  case is actually quite powerless in this aspect . 
  you can * say * that , a noun , when inflected in this manner , means a particular thing . 
  then , that manner of inflection is a case . 
  but you ca n't fabricate a case that orders the noun to behave in the way to mean that particular thing . 
  case is descriptive ; it is impossible to make a list of all particular cases , because that list is infinite . 
  for , for every finite list , i could invent a language that has nouns that inflect in a way not covered by any of the cases on your list .
