  mostly vacuum , but also some neutrinos and photons, 
  no , usually they do the standard fantasy modus operandi of sticking to certain rules for concepts . 
  things work the way the viewer expects them to based on how they are introduced , and if they do n't , then there 's explanation to go along with why . 
  there 's surely counterexamples , but i ca n't think of any in recent memory . 
  tvtropes calles violation of this an [ `` ass pull . 
  '' ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/asspull ), 
   statues that can move when you 're not looking and send you back in time to feed on energy ? 
  once that trait was established , they consistently functioned that way . 
  ( and when they did n't , it was inelegant , but at least it was explained . 
  and when they did n't * and * it was n't explained -- i 'm looking at you , statue of liberty -- people complained endlessly . 
  but it was n't a big deal because the plot of the entire episode was n't built around it . ), 
   cracks in the universe that can completely erase things from time ? 
  these also functioned consistently . 
  they can appear anywhere , lead anywhere , and are very dangerous when open . 
   a massive alien presence living in a star ? 
  u wot m8 . 
  if `` literally anything can be alive '' is n't one of the biggest fantasy trends in dw i do n't what is . 
   the core of planet earth containing a giant alien-spider spaceship with a tunnel to the surface right underneath the thames river ? 
  this does n't violate any of our sensibilities , though . 
  dirt can be moved , and spaceships take up a finite amount of space , and can hover to places , and sometimes teleport . 
  we 've got * expectations * for how things work , even if they are set by the showrunners themselves . 
  and it 's annoying when they 're violated . 
  if violating the law of conservation of mass without further explanation becomes a common event in doctor who , then we 'll get used to it . 
  but right now the lack of precedent is grating . 
  law of conservation of mass is actually violated regularly in dw , with ftl teleportation . 
  but it has an explanation according to dw mechanics , and has clearly established modes of function . 
  the problem here comes from the explanation , not the event : they said that it 's gaining mass because it 's growing , but we think it needs matter to grow , so we feel lied to . 
  dw had n't explicitly introduced any mechanisms for spontaneously creating mass if you are a biological creature , and it still has n't ( although it * has * made viewers more wary ) . 
  that 's the problem . 
  ah something similar just happened to me . 
  it 's horrible . 
  how long had you been dating ? 
  ( 7 years here , was gon na marry ; long-distance is a killer ), 
  that 's not going to make them much less offended . 
  even with people making fun of the governments of european countries , you get many annoyed europeans saying that that 's just the government , followed with the rebuttal of `` we know '' . 
  ( i should know ; i 'm hungarian ! ), 
  hmm , that 's true , although that might not be creating mass , just hollowing out parts of itself . 
  the tardis is already pretty surreal on the inside , though , so you would n't expect anything weird that happens inside of it to generalize to things outside of it . 
  hooray , you followed up !, 
  this is really cool . 
  i did n't even know about morning * ford * axions , 
  it did !, 
  but that was characterized as `` the bigger on the inside leaking out '' , i.e. 
  the inside of the tardis getting thrust into our reality . 
  ( i could have sworn that that had happened before , too , in old who , but i ca n't find the occurrence . 
  that 's not too relevant anyway because many viewers nowadays have n't seen those episodes . ), 
  reminds me of the team special olympics comics . 
  very dumb surrealist gag strips , with the same art style , based on simple , specific recurring themes . 
  i wonder if one inspired the other . 
  sure !, 
  one of the biggest things the eu is good for is protecting produce . 
   relatively uncommon, 
  u wot m8 . 
  east asia and the pacific are not small places !,

  not an accurate analogy , unless you mean democracy mode , in which case it 's perfect, 
  the first one i copied out by hand . 
  the rest i just copied and pasted into a . txt and regexed it into something usable using vim and perl . 
  the problem is you would n't be able to serialize the dna anyway if you just read it straight out of the word file , because it was broken up into sections of about 50 base pairs each , so you 'd have 50 base pairs from a followed by a line break , then 50 base pairs from b followed by a line break , then 50 base pairs from c followed by a line break , ( and so on for about 20 more sources ) , then * two * line breaks , then another 50 base pairs from a , then b , et cetera . 
  i think whoever did it generated a ( usable ) alignment file where it was broken up like that , and then copied and pasted it into an ( unusable ) word file .

  i stole '' \u0442\u0443\u0433 '' from / u/lanerdofchristian in [ the great borrowing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2h92rk/the_great_borrowing_an_adventure_in_shameless/ ) . 
  in his language , saadan , it means `` dragon '' . 
  the actual hungarian word for `` horrible '' also derives from our word for `` monster '' , but its suffix is n't common enough to be considered a separate morpheme . 
  its etymology is indeterminate , so i substituted another etymology-lacking word instead . 
  it also works with the joker .
