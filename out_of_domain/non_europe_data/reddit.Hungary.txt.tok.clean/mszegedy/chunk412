  languages do n't tend to lose latin loanwords . 
  source : i speak hungarian , it seems like practically half our words come from latin as well as a large chunk of grammar, 
  even so , you want to figure out the geography of individual tweets , right ? 
  is there really enough information in single tweets for that ? 
  ( of course , i 've been proven wrong before . 
  there was a wonderful language map of the philippines posted here a while ago that relied on tweets . 
  since this is a dialect of english , though , you 'd expect it to be a lot harder to tell . ), 
  meh , not necessarily . 
  `` what do you mean you do n't sell opium anymore ? '', 
  well , we have a dedicated verb for need !, 
  but actually i just remembered that that one in particular was n't a borrowing , seeing as though it 's common to uralic languages . 
  compare for example the line from munamies 's [ `` pomppufiilis '' ] ( http://youtu.be/zhreqkrvone ) : `` minulla on pomppufiilis '' , literally `` at me exists desire-to-bounce . '', 
  in hungarian , `` n\u00e1lam van pattoghatn\u00e9k , '' with the same translation ( although different topic/comment structure ; in order to correctly emphasize `` pattoghatn\u00e9k '' , you 'd say `` van n\u00e1lam pattoghatn\u00e9k '' ) . 
  to make it up to you , here 's some grammar stuff we actually for 100 % certain borrowed from latin :, 
  - we form future passive participles with '' - nd - '' . 
  - we use adpositions as verb prefixes . 
  not even old hungarian did this . 
  the meanings are frequently the same as in latin , but not always . 
  - we chain together various particles and conjunctions to make new , more nuanced conjunctions . 
  they rarely have any relation to what the chains mean in latin , but occasionally they will match up probably by accident , e.g. 
  we get the meanings of the particles from german , though . 
  in addition , a bunch of loanwords :, 
  - almost everything to do with education . 
  see for example this sentence :, 
  ** meaning : ** `` we drew in school during physics class circles with ink on paper . '', 
  ** languages of origin : ** `` german latin/greek latin/greek latin latin latin latin/greek . '', 
  - almost everything to do with religion ; we pray to `` j\u00e9zus krisztus '' , the `` apostol `` s , and occasionally `` angyal `` s in `` templom `` s, 
  i got to do this once . 
  i was supposed to write an article on the beginning of wwi from the perspective of an axis newspaper . 
  i wrote in hungarian . 
  later i got to read [ actual such articles ] ( http://digit.bibl.u-szeged.hu/00000/00099/01914/00216/dm_1914_225.pdf ) ( pdf warning ) . 
  i love the work you put into the dialect continuum . 
  it 's really impressive making up so many related phonologies that all sound terrible . 
  and so have agreements , although historically usually people have tried to understand them before making them, 
  ( actually i like the sound of all kinds of german a lot , i was just jumping on the bandwagon because it 's 3 am and i 'm too tired to come up with something clever ), 
  the walls trap the heat so you do n't need to heat as much , and obviously you would n't heat the whole thing, 
  according to claude shannon , english contains about [ 1 bit of information per character . 
  ] ( http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/shannon1950.pdf ) any improvements on his research in the past 60 years ? 
  that 's a screw, 
  cool !, 
  what a fascinating paper . 
  but even so , with the information density being roughly the same , the two methods are n't directly comparable like that . 
  for phylogeny you use bayes to build markov chains and let them evolve your tree for you . 
  ( which can turn out to be garbage , if you do n't have enough data ) for determining dialects , you build a naive bayesian model to determine dialect based on word membership , do n't you ? 
  sorry , it was a bad idea to compare them in the first place ; i just wanted to express that , even in a really high-granularity bayesian analysis like you do for phylogenetics , 140 characters is totally not enough to meaningfully determine stuff about , never mind if you 're looking at tweets which contain only like 20 ( mostly very widely used ) words each . 
  but eh i 'll wait to see the results i guess . 
  wot, 
  the original is `` police box '' . 
  `` boksz '' is just a magyarization of `` box '' . 
  together , it 's kind of funny . 
  ( the hungarian word for `` box '' is `` doboz '' . 
  however , if you told a hungarian that the doctor lived in a `` doboz '' , they would n't think it was funny and whimsical . 
  they 'd think , `` what , is this guy a hobo ? '' ), 
  11/10 love it, 
  oh yeah that would work ; `` rend\u0151rf\u00fclke '' . 
  and that 's probably what the word is . 
  ( `` f\u00fclke '' means `` booth '' , and literally means `` little ear '' for some reason ; possibly a wholesale loanword from some slavic language or other , or possibly a result of our language reform a century or so ago ), 
  not hate train necessarily , just ridicule train, 
  dunno , this is what it looks like whenever i fry fish i caught , and it tastes great . 
  this picture , as a result , looks appetizing, 
  inspect element , read source ? 
  you mean we got transylvania back !, 
  1944 was a bad year for hungary ; both the germans occupying us , and the soviets besieging our capital . 
  this must be what it feels like to be poland, 
  he regenerates into the [ horthy regency !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_hungary_%281920%e2%80%931946%29 ), 
  christie traffic , occasionally, 
  and that 's normal, 
  i like it too , but i always hated it as a kid because the bones were left in . 
  ( and because they were made of freshwater trout , which is kind of tasteless . ), 
  you could also try / r/biology, 
  what 's the point of having a new backend if the main server crashes anyway ? 
  wear making this * nont * happem, 
  it 's a funny t-shirt , though, 
   crush you like sars, 
  smallpox would be the most appropriate, 
  it 's not going down , huh . 
  fascist, 
  unfortunately if you 're going by [ vitalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitalism ) , which is kind of a formalization of the concept , then yes it does , since it burns gasoline , which is made from living things . 
  a better argument would be tectonic plates . 
  eh , i can think of plenty of examples where it 's like this . 
  the most frustrating one is arriving to america at the newark airport and getting in line to have your passport and reasons for coming checked : it begins with a single long line , but at the end it breaks up into about eight smaller lines . 
  you 've got to judge which one is the smallest , and sometimes there 's holdups , and sometimes the people in front of you switch out , and sometimes there 's clearly a booth with only one group of people or so waiting in front of it ... basically this gif . 
  i like this one better , you can actually see what the picture is, 
  normal modes !, 
  it 's highly dependent on the frequency of vibration , and it 's theoretically possible to guess what frequency your tea was experiencing from this picture . 
  [ here 's an applet to play around with !, 
  ] ( http://www.falstad.com/membrane/ ), 
  this would make a great picture to use for psas if it did n't have text scrawled all over it, 
  meh , something made by microsoft is difficult to get working ? 
  honestly i 'm not very surprised, 
  on one hand , it 's like you 're skipping over all the things that i 'd like to see more in the comic in the first place , i.e. 
  wacky adventures with funny dialogue , in exchange for walls of text about consequentialism . 
  on the other hand , the whole point is that making it like that would be unoriginal , so if that 's really what i wanted to read i could just go read/watch whatever it 's parodying . 
  i feel like the flow 's a little broken up with this chapter , what with it being a lot longer than any of the other ones , and a lot more plot-heavy . 
  i hope the next arc 's less serious . 
  it 's cool , but it was almost certainly [ essential tremor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/essential_tremor ) anyway . 
  even so , what an interesting experience it must have made for everyone involved . 
  i am sorry prokofiev but your piano concerto no . 
  2 in g minor will never compare to [ saint-saens 's .
