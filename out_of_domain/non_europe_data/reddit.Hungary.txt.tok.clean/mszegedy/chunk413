  curiosity, 
  i loved it , best episode this series so far imo . 
  many original and well-executed ideas, 
  not that i think that theory is likely , but imagine how upset so many people would get if the first female doctor was a villain, 
  it 's a legitimate question , since it 's run by people, 
  also is it really as bad as `` nigger '' ? 
  in hungarian it 's completely acceptable, 
  and the message tennant wanted to send to the sycorax . 
  wait , i 'm sensing a pattern, 
  i personally thought aliens having the same names as characters in shakespeare is dumb , but meh , that 's not the only thing to dislike about the ep, 
  i 've played exactly one game of eu4 so far , and portugal , castile , france , and austria allied together in the west ( additionally , austria allied with hungary ; austria got * very * long , tracing a path from modern belgium to modern serbia ) , and the timurids blobbed into the mughals in the east . 
  ( at least i 'm friendly with the timurids/mughals . ), 
  thus : long ottomans , north-south . 
  i had to tunnel through poland , conquer lithuania , fight russia , and bump up against sweden . 
  south-wise , i had to exterminate the mamluks , immediately destroy funj when it appeared , colonize the whole west-african coast , beat kilwa , and not touch portuguese south africa .

  i read somewhere that it 's only a few hundred years old , but is supposed to be permanent . 
  is that true ? 
  honestly though most aliens in fictions are n't as weird as they should be , since they 're humanoid . 
  which is weird . 
  awesome job !, 
  i always like to see these kinds of langs . 
  ca n't say it would n't be noticeable though . 
  semi-relatedly , i once tried to see what was the maximum density of information i could fit on an index card without wasting time learning a whole new language or reading really tiny script . 
  i ended up with a top-to-bottom script on a triangle grid , with each group of three triangles representing a letter ( which could stand for a variety of phonemes in english ) . 
  heheheh aliens with non-humanoid morphologies but human-like psychologies are always so adorable and funny, 
  aww while i feel sorry for the poor guy , who must be terrified out of his mind , how fascinating, 
  she graduated from the elementary school at age 14, 
  molecular biologist , can relate, 
  well , but that 's exactly the difference , we 're way more complex . 
  ( probably . 
  i 'm not sure how complex/not predictable insect behavior is . ), 
  gifs are generally discouraged here , since they tend to end up being just `` wow what a trippy kaleidoscope '' . 
  dutch, 
  dutch is a good guess anyway for belgium . 
  it 's the most widely spoken language there by far . 
  who cares . 
  it 's `` polyamory '' now , bitches !, 
  i am very jealous . 
  me too !, 
  but only on rt saves . 
  that latin is so beautifully fucked up for the aybabtu patch . 
  `` vestri '' has the wrong case , `` ad '' is unnecessary and does n't take the dative , and `` es '' is in the second person . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  it 's perfect and deliberate . 
  it mirrors the bad english for `` all your base are belong to us '' . 
  ah , you just do n't appreciate a good bad translation ... 
  bloom filters are one of my favorite data structures . 
  `` if one hash function does n't work , use more of them ! '', 
  it 's so nice to see such a funny principle getting applied in a useful way . 
  ( that 's the point ), 
  so does probabilistan, 
  i look fine on video but holy shit i am the stupidest , most annoying person you have ever listened to, 
  [ that one 's just silly though ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpatho-ukraine ), 
  itt : are viruses alive ? 
  does a tree falling in a deserted forest make a sound ? 
  is belgium a country ? 
  geminate stops at least are pretty easy : you just let the air build for an instant behind wherever you 're closing up your mouth , and you end up releasing it in a larger burst than usual . 
  the principle generalizes to other consonants as well : you move your mouth into position to produce the consonant , and you start forcing air out , but you wait an instant before releasing the position . 
  there 's always things to spend money on !, 
  - random accidents : needing a lawyer , or paying health bills , or fixing up your car . 
  have you gone to a psychologist yet to make sure you 're okay ? 
  - luxury : you could always buy more expensive food , more expensive tvs , more expensive refrigerators , more expensive vacuums . 
  do you go out every night for dinner ? 
  you should try it . 
  if you like cooking for yourself , though , are you sure you have the best ingredients ? 
  have you tried making something with ingredients from the asian supermarket 2 hours away ? 
  - adventure : try traveling !, 
  the expenses are infinite and indefinite : plane tickets , the price of wherever you 're staying , the price of renting a car , the price of the food , and there 's just so many things in the new place to spend your money on that you do n't have the opportunity to buy at home ... 
  - have you tried having children ? 
  honestly if i had to illustrate sulfuric acid i 'd go with yellow , since sulfur 's yellow, 
  yellow is also beer, 
  sushi !, 
  or fish sticks . 
  who do you play as ? 
  maybe it makes a difference . 
  big o in computer science is roughly how many operations an algorithm takes to perform , in terms of the number of items the algorithm 's performed on . 
  it 's for comparing how fast different algorithms are as the number of items gets large . 
  since they become insignificant as the number of items gets large , we ignore constant coefficients , and constant numbers added to it , so an algorithm that takes 6n ^ 2 + 8 operations and an algorithm that takes ( 2n ) ^ 2 operations are both just o ( n ^ ( 2 ) ) . 
  also , we ignore really inexpensive operations ; for example , for matrix multiplication , which you need both addition and multiplication for , we only count the multiplications . 
  everyone else is suckers , i just discovered europa universalis !, 
  i never had to wait while the series was still shitty !, 
  [ this is on its front page right now ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2jswnj/prepare_for_war/ ), 
  just curious , what temperature do they keep the low-freq receiver base at ? 
  your way is better imo because it shows up correctly on phones . 
  thank you for teaching a cool new trick !,

   it feels like the doctor just hates himself , and then looks for reasons to rationalize that hate . 
  to me it feels more like the * writers * trying to rationalize that hate . 
  and so far it 's fallen flat , but i have faith . 
  frist of all how dare yo u, 
  it could also be automatically blocked, 
  it 's my first game !, 
  does it ? 
  i 'm worried that once i 've discovered all the mechanics , it 'll get significantly more boring, 
  invent a cure obviously . 
  this is exactly how self-interest is supposed to benefit everyone . 
  ( english cardinal numbers thread ), 
  nah programming 's a big field , of course some are going to like puzzles and some are n't .
