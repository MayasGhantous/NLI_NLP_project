  btw personally i find that physical puzzles , the kind with pieces , are a terrible metaphor for problems that require creative thinking ( which we also call puzzles ) . 
  physical puzzles do n't require much creative thinking ; you just compare pieces and find ones that match . 
  i do n't think i 've changed my puzzling strategy since 10 years old , and it would n't be much more interesting if i did so in the near future . 
  whereas every problem is a new experience . 
  and when you turn it you can hear all the various kinds of grains rolling under it like tiny ball bearings, 
  it found a page with `` in catilinam '' on it that has english locale ( set behind the scenes using html ) . 
  that page also had the word `` cicero '' on it somewhere , probably right under the title ( or in it ) . 
  g translate conjectured that cicero means `` in catilinam '' , and then you get this . 
  it ends in `` nt '' , we usually put an apostrophe on that, 
  the bits of dust in the accretion disk jam up horribly tight together and generate light . 
  the ones closest to the center get spit out , creating bright jets . 
  same !, 
  also , the way we say `` caricature '' in hungarian is `` karikat\u00fara '' , a latinized borrowing of english `` caricature '' , or possibly a direct borrowing from italian , in any case ultimately from pie `` k\u0311ers '' ( `` to run '' ) . 
  however , in hungarian , its etymology is hidden , and it looks like a composition of two other hungarian words :, 
  - `` karika '' , an informal word meaning `` circle '' , from `` k\u00f6r '' , our word for `` circle '' , from latin `` cor '' ( `` heart '' ) , ultimately from pie '' \u1e31\u1e17r '' ( `` heart '' ), 
  - `` t\u00fara '' , meaning `` tour '' , from english `` tour '' , ultimately from pie `` terh \u2081 '' ( `` to rub , twist , or turn '' ), 
  so , roughly , a `` loop tour '' . 
  i 've had a lot of different ( all non-english-speaking ) hungarians explain this false etymology to me as the real one , and each one connected it to the meaning of the word in a different ( but inevitably tenuous ) way . 
  obviously / u/timelyparadox was n't thinking of `` wa not '' when he was writing it . 
  i mean that it 's an easy mistake to make because of how often final `` nt '' has an apostrophe in the middle . 
  you do n't really pay attention as you type , and type the more familiar sequence by accident . 
  as an added bonus this one 's just one letter off from `` was n't '' , which makes the connection even stronger . 
  edit : also just one letter off from `` ca n't '' !, 
  it was just asking for it was n't it ? 
  we just use singular for 1 and -1 . 
  it 's arbitrary . 
  other languages might use the singular for 0 too , e.g. 
  uralic or austronesian languages \\* where if there is a specific amount of a thing you use the singular . 
  examples :, 
  - hungarian :, 
  - `` eszik h\u00e1rom ember '' , meaning `` three people eat '' , literally `` eats three person '' , as opposed to `` esznek h\u00e1rom emberek '' , literally `` eat three people '', 
  - `` semennyi ember '' , meaning `` no people '' , literally `` no-quantity-of person '' , as opposed to `` semennyi emberek '' , literally `` no-quantity-of people '', 
  - `` limang bato '' , meaning `` five rocks '' , literally `` five rock '' , as opposed to `` mga limang bato '' , literally '' [ plural ] five rock '', 
  - `` walang tao '' , meaning `` no person '' or `` no people '' , literally `` none person '' , as opposed to `` mga walang tao '' , literally '' [ plural ] none person '', 
  it 's [ worth noting  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_number#types_of_number ) no language has a `` nullal '' number , a grammatical number specifically for none . 
  ( although there might exist languages that have something marginally like that , just it is n't treated like a number in the study of that language , and therefore it did n't make it into the wikipedia list . ), 
  \\* i 'm not actually sure whether that 's a characteristic shared by a broad majority of austronesian languages or not . 
  all the ones i 've had experience with do it , though . 
  [ writes a comic with a classic joke ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ does n't ban himself ] ( #green - text ), 
  that 's awesome , you 've got to keep it . 
  underrated 'cause you posted it late . 
  my favorite in this thread . 
  i love this . 
  could you post a rot13 'd solution to why it works ? 
  edit : actually i can just do it myself ( decipher it [ here ] ( http://www.rot13.com/index.php ) ) : `` k fdhnerq rdhnyf l fdhnerq '' qbrfa ' g arprffnevyl vzcyl `` k rdhnyf l '' . 
  well , i tried . 
  it might not be holeproof ; i 'm very tired . 
  rot13 is a cipher for the english alphabet that shifts the index of each letter by 13 ( so that to reverse the cipher you just apply it again ) . 
  it 's commonly used as an alternative to spoiler tags when they are n't an option .

  you should be able to reason that it 's probably not to do with adam and eve , though . 
  the mother of all spoilers if you have n't seen classic who yet !, 
  ( do n't necessarily need to tag it , but it 's funny ), 
  - that happened in 1970 , you 'd need to be at least about 50 to remember it, 
  - canada is irrelevant , nobody remembers what happens there anyway, 
  - flair up !, 
  hmm , you have no flair ( that 's bad !, 
  flair up !, 
  ) , but i can make an educated guess, 
  it 's no longer rotationally symmetric !, 
  croatia is secret sz\u00e9kely, 
  omg you 're actually ob-ugric ? 
  do you speak either language ? 
  i 've been dying to hear/see them seeing as though they 're the closest existing languages to hungarian, 
  edit : i am not blind i swear, 
  huh . 
  most people i know would say '' -1 apple '' , since saying the sequence of words `` one apples '' feels wrong to them . 
  well there 's a difference between rules and courtesy . 
  but yeah that 's what i was referring to, 
  my reading comprehension is simultaneously bananas and through the roof . 
  you ever met any though ? 
  i do n't see how that is n't rotationally symmetric, 
  but if i rotate it 180 \u00b0 it 's the same thing, 
  but how does this not make him a good man ? 
  saving em is like the best thing you can do for people, 
   because if saving more people means letting others die he 'll do it without hesitation . 
  hes constantly weighing the scales . 
  part of that is weighing the time lost by mourning vs the actions he could have performed in that time . 
  but what about that is bad ? 
  he needs to do that in order to be good effectively . 
  he 'd be less good if he tried less hard to save people . 
   further , he knows he has hate in himself . 
  he hates the daleks enough for one to learn what hate was all over again . 
  that one is a legitimate claim , but imo it felt kinda weak . 
  it 's the daleks 's fault that his entire race is wiped out ; it would be a miracle of human psychology if he * did n't * hate them . 
  ( not that he 's human , but time lords appear to behave well within the boundaries of what is normal for humans ), 
   whether this invalidates if he 's a good man or not does n't matter as much as the fact that it makes the doctor question if he is or not . 
  but i do n't want a stupid doctor who invents things to worry about . 
  dramatic irony is only interesting when there 's a reason the character does n't yet know what they should know ; here , the doctor is not only able to realize his error at any moment , but also should have known this ages ago . 
  this way there is no confidence that the doctor will ever figure out that he 's a good man . 
  if the doctor worries about whether he 's a good man or not , i want either to sympathize with him and wonder as well , or to feel sorry for him for not knowing something that would make him stop wondering , and hope that he finds it out soon . 
  edit : revised section on dramatic irony . 
  unfortunately made it more confusing . 
  you do n't have to say you 're from pakistan ; just get [ flair !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/wiki/flair ), 
  happy diwali !, 
  what a great comic, 
  i think it would be okay if he had some other character flaw to balance it out .
