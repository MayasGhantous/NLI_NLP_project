  like some sort of tendency to make poor decisions that result in other people 's demises , that he then gets to legitimately feel bad about . 
  though for him , the time war was over a thousand years ago at this point , actually . 
  so i said that it would be a psychological miracle if he forgave them , but really , humans at least are n't built to hold grudges that last even decades , never mind centuries . \\* i guess for the viewers it 's only been a few years , though , so they do n't want to see it just forgotten about . 
  \\* of course this is where time lord psychology really does diverge from human : we 're not sure what would even happen to the mind of a human that aged 1600 years , as we already behave markedly differently from decade to decade , and it 's possible that 1600 years might make you go insane altogether . 
  clearly time lords have some sort of extra mental fortitude . 
  making up stuff is easier, 
  i do n't like that conversation in # 4 at all , though . 
  it 's like they tried to imitate what nerds would argue about on the internet , and got it totally wrong . 
  \\  nice, 
  \\  borders ottomans, 
  [ nope ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_croatia#current_design ), 
  it becomes the same again !, 
  but that 's not special , everything in hilbert spaces does that . 
  180 \u00b0 we have a name and a concept for because it 's special . 
  eh they 're not a big deal , they 're very different shades of green . 
  hanover and ottomans though look closer than colonial nations . 
  well , you ca n't be 100 % certain you 'll remember either thing , so if you try to do both , the probability that you 'll have done either one of them will go up . 
  also , you can use one as a memory aid for the other : `` okay , this cab 's number is xxxx , now i 'm set in case i leave my stuff here ... oh i left my stuff here !, 
  glad i caught that . '', 
   i * am * linux !, 
  btw dolphin 's available for linux now , so installing linux on a wii is actually helpful, 
  yes !, 
  with roms you downloaded . 
  there 's a separate set of verb endings for it , which , while being completely different from the usual verb endings , almost all contain '' - j - '' . 
  not much reason . 
  having linux on your wii means that you can run a lot of arbitrary stuff on it , though ( or have it be a webserver huehuehuehue ) : imagine having your roms be synced wirelessly via dropbox , or being able to play your nsmbw hacks immediately after you make them . 
  ultimately though it 's not worth it imo . 
  so you 'll no longer be able to track it if you leave your * other * stuff there . 
  do n't worry , every other hungarian is also pissed off on your behalf, 
  - mixed areas should be finely dotted , not coarsely striped, 
  - lazy rendering of extent of hungarian, 
  - for that matter , lazy rendering of a lot of these -- where is v\u00f5ro even at all ? 
  why does livonian have such a large area ? 
  - coloring is very hard to tell apart ; please also vary the saturation and brightness , and vary the hue more, 
  nice map but needs a lot of work, 
  heck no , hungarian is n't mutually intelligible with anything . 
  you might be able to make out some sentences in mansi or khanty , and select sentences in nenets ( the latter due to its accidental similar phonological evolution to the ugric languages ) , but for the most part even they are quite different from it . 
  the problem is , only about 20 % of the words in hungarian are uralic , and even those underwent substantial phonological change so as to be , for the most part , barely recognizable ; 30 % are of completely unknown etymology , 30 % are slavic , 10 % are turkic , and 10 % are germanic . 
  ( there 's some other less significant languages there that got rounded out : for example , some very important words are indo-iranian , like the words for 10 ( and by extension 8 and 9 , although the root is ugric ) , 1000 , meat , milk , cow , sword , and others . ), 
  finnish is as incomprehensible to hungarian speakers as it is to english speakers , just like malay and hawaiian are n't mutually intelligible either . 
  a while ago , an estonian linguist came up with a sentence that he reasoned both finns and hungarians should be able to understand in each other 's language . 
  however , it did n't work in either direction . 
  can you make any head or tail of it ? 
  there is a degree of mutual intelligibility between finnic languages , though . 
  finnish and karelian speakers can understand each other pretty well , as can estonian and v\u00f5ro speakers . 
  if you want to see what hungarian words are related to other uralic words , you can go take a look at wiktionary 's [ swadesh lists for uralic languages ] ( http://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:swadesh_lists_for_uralic_languages ) , or wikipedia 's [ comparison of select words . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#selected_cognates ) if you want to see other kinds of similarities , see the section on [ uralic typology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#typology ) on the same page . 
  some words , you get different etymologies from different sources ; like for the word `` ing/imeg '' , meaning '' ( button-down ) shirt '' , i 've had one source claim that it 's iranian , and another source claim that its etymology is unknown . 
  fwiw i ca n't find a cognate in farsi , but i did n't look very hard . 
  in general , though , the etymologies of a lot of words are n't apparent at all . 
  my pet theory for where some of them come from ( which is probably wrong , seeing as though i have n't seen any linguists mention it yet ) is that they come from the language spoken by the turkic people who adopted hungarian from the magyars , and are the ancestors of modern hungarians . 
  ( the biggest weakness of this theory is that they would have had to speak a non-turkic language , since if it were turkic we 'd be able to see the similarities . 
  small language families are pretty common though . ), 
  there 's similarities in phonology , but keep in mind that phonology tends to be influenced greatly by a language 's neighbors . 
  hungarian phonology resembles czech or slovak phonology more closely than it does mansi phonology . 
  hungarian and finnish are much , much further from each other than english and german , though . 
  speakers ca n't even figure out the meanings of any individual words pointed out in the other 's language , whereas there 's many entire sentences in german that an english speaker can understand perfectly . 
  the problem is that , while finnish is remarkably close to proto-uralic , not only has hungarian undergone a number of substantial phonological changes and shifts in meaning , it has also replaced a large portion of its vocabulary with loanwords from a variety of sources ( a significant part of which are entirely indiscernible ) . 
  he had to , though , to not die . 
  a guy i know claims to have invented a polynomial-time algorithm for any finite number of cats . 
  i do n't believe him, 
  ( it was , but that does n't make him much worse than the average person ; most people would have done that ), 
  genetic engineer here , i consider selective breeding genetic engineering , because it allows me to claim that my field is thousands of years old, 
  if the alternative is dying , then yeah of course people would go and do that . 
  \\ # 2 looks fun, 
  if you like amateur fiction , you can try [ pact ] ( http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/ ) by wildbow . 
  it 's what you 're talking about , and the author is very good ( although i 'm not a fan of his pacing ) . 
  mildly relatedly , a lot of the names got unnecessarily changed when it was translated to hungarian , and a lot of them sound stupid :, 
  - you-know-who \u2192 tudjukki ( `` we know who '' ) ; stupidest one imo , it sounds so cheery and cute . 
  personally i 'd translate it to `` kinemond '' , `` do n't you say it ( out loud ) '' , which sounds a lot more badass, 
  - hogwarts \u2192 roxfort ( what , like the cheese ? ), 
  - snape \u2192 piton ( `` python '' ) ; this one is better than the original imo because `` piton professzor '' is alliterative, 
  - quirrel \u2192 m\u00f3gus ( try it with google translate , it just translates to `` quirrel '' ), 
  - ravenclaw \u2192 holl\u00f3h\u00e1t ( `` raven back '' ) ; `` raven claw '' literally would be `` holl\u00f3karom '' , which is one syllable more than the original and thus worse, 
  - hufflepuff \u2192 hugrabug ; sounds kind of like `` ugri-bugri '' which is a word you say to children to refer to jumping, 
  - slytherin \u2192 mardek\u00e1r ; `` k\u00e1r '' means `` bad event '' , and `` jaj de k\u00e1r '' means `` what a shame '' , but i 'm not aware of this meaning anything, 
  and then some of them got magyarized dumbly when they really should have been changed entirely :, 
  - muggle -  mugli ( we also magyarize `` google '' as `` gugli '' ), 
  - gryffindor -  griffend\u00e9l ; you changed all the other ones , why are you leaving this alone ? 
  they 're proper nouns !, 
  you do n't translate proper nouns !, 
  and no way hungarian is easy !, 
  you 're just not used to synthetic or agglutinative languages because you speak english . 
  you just put together endings ( from a small inventory ) to get the word you want , how easy is that ? 
  and you use the same word for like , prefer , and love , as well as the same word for learn , study , and do homework !, 
  ( which is itself a verbed form of our noun for `` study '' . ), 
  very easy !, 
  and you never change parts of words when you put them together ; you just tack them on !, 
  ( except for vowel harmony , but that 's only in a maximum of three categories and if you just keep doing it without putting serious thought into it you 'll get it . ), 
  people think our language is hard for having twenty cases , but those cases are just postpositions without a space between the word and the postposition !, 
  english has * more adpositions than hungarian !, 
  * and we do n't care what order you put the words in at all , almost , just say it any way and we 'll understand you !, 
  ( although you can use word order to express something very neat known as `` topic-comment structure '' , but that 's so subtle that nobody will care if you get it wrong . ), 
  hungarian is so easy !, 
  \\  not even indo-european, 
  \\  at least 40 % of our words are indo-european, 
  hah , thank you , but i am neither fluent in english nor a linguist . 
  actually a gigantic amount of our words come from indo-european languages , but 30 % of the total are from slavic languages , although several of those are themselves from latin . 
  here 's some indo-european words you probably wo n't recognize at all that describe pretty basic things :, 
  - rajz ( a thing drawn , the art of drawing ) , vicc ( joke ) : german,
