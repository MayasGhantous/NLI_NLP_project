  - k\u00f6r ( circle ) : latin, 
  alas our verbs conjugate , and we use the suffix '' - z '' to verb a noun . 
  - `` you google muggle . '', 
  - `` to google muggle '' -  `` guglizni a muglit '', 
  `` a '' by the way means `` the '' . 
  we put it on slightly more things than english , including proper nouns ( which is what `` mugli '' is acting as ) . 
  ironically , we used to not put it on anything . 
  the fact that we do now is the fault of the germans . 
  i struggle to remember semi-basic words on a regular basis . 
  just today i could n't remember `` fork '' or `` toilet '' and a couple other things i am forgetting . 
  i may have a good command of grammar , but my vocabulary is limited . 
  i currently live in the us !, 
  the problem is that i often leave , and that i frequently speak other languages with people . 
  i have resigned myself to the knowledge that i can not fit more than three entire languages in my head , so i must be content with fractions . 
  thank you for the kind words !, 
  however , i have never felt so self-conscious about my grammar as i do right now . 
   not even bothered to learn * one * language, 
  what do people in the us speak then ? 
   even after that , though , you give your country too little credit !, 
  not only do your large numbers of immigrants speak their own language , possibly another language from where they came from , and usually english , but even many so-called monolingual americans know two registers of english : standard english , and textspeak , which itself has many highly varied dialects . 
  that alone is a great extension of your linguistic knowledge : a weird language with many pronouns with extra modal meanings ( e.g. 
  `` ion '' , `` ioneem '' , `` id/youd/hed / shed '' ) , with evidentials and opinion markers ( `` imo '' , `` afaik '' , emoticons , emojis ) , where you can leave off the subject , where punctuation * really matters * . 
  but even so i see so many people here who * have * really bothered to learn another language . 
  ( yes , usually spanish , but learning languages to communicate with people where you live is an entirely admirable thing to do ! ), 
  you are selling your country short , and coming from the most monolingual country in europe , i will not brook it !, 
  google translate works heuristically based on data it finds on the internet . 
  sometimes this leads to [ pretty hilarious results . 
  ] ( http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/10-google-translate-fails.html ) ( ahahaha , you got sweden/canada right , gt . 
  they 're both icy , socialist , and to the north of more relevant countries ; what 's the difference ? ), 
  it 's got about the same melting point as chocolate , i.e. 
  just below the temperature of the surface of your body . 
  do n't try to eat it , though ; it 's poisonous . 
   i think the swedish way of doing it should be standard, 
  typical swede !, 
  but arthur dent eventually became a flying god , and got more relevant to the plot . 
  this is completely different from arthur dent, 
  for hungarian , many of the names were translated for the first book , but the entire rest of the series was left mostly alone . 
  it 's inexplicable . 
  i 'm too tired to remember all the rules now , but basically something gets `` a/az '' on it if there 's only one of it , even if that 's just implied . 
  in a lot of ways it 's more logical than how germanic languages do it , but looking at it another way it 's just more verbose . 
  here 's a rough list :, 
  - things that normally get `` the '' / `` der/die/das '' get it, 
  - proper nouns get it : after all , you 're referring to the one and only peter , or whoever . 
  however , sometimes proper nouns can lose the article ; this is ironically also because of germanic influence , which caused us to have articles in the first place . 
  - anything possessed gets it ; `` a sz\u00e1jad '' , `` the mouth of yours '' , rather than just `` sz\u00e1jad '' , `` your mouth '' . 
  leaving off the article is only done in poetry and poetry-like speech . 
  this makes sense , since you 're referring to a particular thing possessed by the person , are n't you ? 
  if you want to refer to a nonspecific thing that the person has , then you can use `` egy '' ( `` one '' ) instead of `` az '' , but you usually end up not needing it . 
  also , there 's a special case where possessed nouns lose their articles entirely : `` van p\u00e9nzed ? '', 
  means `` do you have money ? '', 
  ( literally , `` is there money of yours ? '' ), 
  - also anything that gets a demonstrative adjective in front of it : `` ez a kocsi '' , `` az a kocsi '' , `` amaz a kocsi '' mean `` this car '' , `` that car '' , `` that car ( over there ) '' . 
  when you use `` az '' rather than `` a '' , namely when the modified noun begins with a vowel , you can get the same word twice in a row : `` az az emelet '' means `` that floor '', 
  - anything else there 's only one of by implication , which are mostly abstract concepts such as words , numbers , states of mind , types of government , cultural movements , colors , etc. 
  : `` a kommunizmus '' ( `` the communism '' ) , `` a szerelem '' ( `` the love '' ) . 
  referring to the abstract notion of all instances of a thing also counts : `` mindent elpuszt\u00edt a t\u0171z '' means `` fire ( in general ) destroys everything . '', 
  countries , however , are treated like proper nouns rather than abstract concepts , meaning they can lose `` az '' sometimes : `` franciaorsz\u00e1g hadat \u00fczent '' means `` france has declared war . '', 
  ( but if you were to use verb-initial word order , it would be more natural to say , `` hadat \u00fczent a franciaorsz\u00e1g . '' ), 
  btw , we use `` az '' for three things : first and foremost as a distal demonstrative pronoun ( meaning `` that ( but not * too * far off ) '' ) , secondly as an article , and thirdly as an optional ( but highly recommended ) marker that the word order has been switched from comment-topic ( verb first ) to topic-comment ( verb after middle , or last ) . 
  combined with the fact that we lose the copula ( `` to be '' / `` sein '' ) in the third person , this makes for some pretty hilarious sentences . 
  '' , meaning , `` it 's like if they were saying that in hungarian , `` az '' is the verb ! '', 
  i guess english has such grammatical oddities too : `` jane , while john had had ` had ' , had had ` had had ' ; ` had had ' had had a better effect on the teacher . '', 
  they had `` der/die/das '' . 
  :( do n't blame us , it sounded fancy !, 
  \\  pimento, 
  \\  like the pepper, 
  hahahahahahahaha, 
  it sounds slightly better if you use the hungarian pronunciation , which sounds more like `` mordekar '' . 
  like `` mort '' !, 
  see [ my digression on `` az '' . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2kbwpw/til_in_the_harry_potter_series_tom_riddle_has_a/clk2la1?context=3 ) yep , we have an indefinite article , `` egy '' , which literally means `` one '' . 
  however , there is not much need for it in hungarian . 
  `` van tollad '' means `` you have a pen '' , or literally `` there is a pen of yours '' . 
  you can also say `` van neked toll '' , literally `` there is a pen to you '' or `` there are pens to you '' , but that still does n't require `` egy '' . 
  other clauses with pseudo-verbs are also like this : `` kell neked toll ? '', 
  means `` do you need a pen ? 
  '' , literally , `` is a pen needed to you ? '', 
  in any of these cases , though , if you really cared about the indefiniteness of the noun , you could add `` egy '' : `` van egy tollad . '', 
  a * chem * , it 's * burgonya *, 
  ( yes , good job !, 
  now you just need to learn `` hurka '' , `` kolb\u00e1sz '' , `` lecs\u00f3 '' , `` guly\u00e1s '' , and `` paprika '' , and you 'll be fluent in hungarian ! ), 
  he was immortal !, 
  i was joking, 
  it was an ongoing process starting circa 800 ad or so . 
  back then it was n't really our language , but the magyars 's language , who invaded from the urals and conquered us . 
  close cultural , and eventually dynastic , ties with the habsburgs did much to germanicize hungary . 
  i 'm a complete idiot , how did i not notice that, 
  also * shrek * was better in hungarian than english, 
   danny 's whole speech about there being better wonders than witnessing a coronal mass ejection like some kid saying sorry sounded like a massive touchy feely load of horseshit to me . 
  but that 's just me . 
  i figured a veteran would have a different perspective, 
  it was similar to `` kill the moon '' in many bad ways :, 
  - terrible science again ( this time , actual misinformation ! ), 
  - the whole world is suddenly in danger, 
  - the characters do n't have to do anything to save the world, 
  - people act kind of out of character ( the doctor in ktm , clara in this one ), 
  i enjoyed it more , though . 
  but the only thing keeping me interested in the episode was the mystery , and the reveal was better here than for ktm , but they ran into the * exact same scientific mistake again * , and then even after that , it said even more nonsense !, 
  what made it a better reveal imo is that it had a more progressive lead-in . 
  ( in particular , i liked the bit where they showed that the trees have only one ring . ),
