  even so , though , i am going to stop expecting living things to require any sort of mass/energy intake to grow in doctor who . 
  and repost !, 
  that makes even more sense, 
  must ... post ... joke ... on facebook !, 
  that 's what it 's called !, 
  but they 're all just reprints of a [ * blog !, 
  * ] ( http://bettermyths.com/ ), 
  hey , thank * you !, 
  wait , you 're a real live estonian i can try this on now !, 
  some time ago , an estonian linguist who studied uralic languages came up with a sentence that he reasoned should be mutually intelligible between estonian , finnish , and hungarian , as a result of it being based on common roots that have n't changed much . 
  but while it 's easily intelligible between estonian and finnish , apparently neither finns nor hungarians could understand each other 's version of the sentence . 
  i 've tried the finnish version on many hungarians , and indeed , none of them got it even close . 
  now there 's an opportunity to do it the other way !, 
  can you figure it out ? 
  no cheating !, 
  just stop it , asshole . 
  just ... stop . 
  i do n't have the energy for this . 
  our government is terrible , but * this * is what gets people to protest ... ? 
  no way there 's still tons of varieties in borneo, 
  speaking of misusing terminology, 
   english evolved to, 
  on * the thief and the cobbler * : any soundtrack which uses saint-saens is okay in my book !, 
  ( and it seems your reconstruction uses the same recording as i have at home ... in fact , a lot of the music sounds exactly the recordings i have at home . 
  was the soundtrack made by a hungarian studio , or is it just that there is n't much variety in people 's interpretations of the music ? ), 
  anyway : incredible post !, 
  saved !, 
  ah my favorite theme day so far !, 
  evokes central europe very properly :, 
  - those buses, 
  except for the gigantic expanse of water . 
  everyone knows that while central europe can into river , it also can into landlocked . 
  paging [ cyriak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/cyriak ), 
  especially had [ this one ] ( http://youtu.be/jx3ilfcmdcw?list=pl81280e14a07c995d ) playing in my head while looking at the picture, 
  [ san marino ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ of relevance ] ( #green - text ), 
  i 'd do a laugh , but surprisingly italian does n't have any fricatives further back than \u0283\u02d0 , not even h, 
  your czechified name ... it 's perfect ; - ;, 
  they 're a very important detail . 
  the faces are what you look at the most in pictures . 
  thanks for taking a shot !, 
  i 'm sorry for not providing an ipa transcription ; i considered it , but i figured that it 's close enough to estonian orthography and ipa that it would make sense . 
  here it is though : [ \u02c8\u025bl\u025bv\u025bn h\u0252l \u02c8u\u02d0sik \u0252 vi\u02d0z \u02c8\u0252l\u0252tt ] the accent just means it 's a long vowel , and < sz  is just [ s ] . 
  ( again , blame the germans . ), 
  ahahahah you know what 's the funniest part though ? 
  you made the exact same mistake that hungarians make when translating the finnish and estonian versions , concerning the third word . 
  our word for `` new '' is '' \u00faj '' , and our word for `` newer '' is '' \u00fajabb '' , so you can see the mixup . 
   the czech republic 's use of the old czechoslovak flag is in direct violation of the constitutional act that explicitly forbids former federal symbols to be used by the two successor states . 
  welp, 
  and you also question questions !, 
  in hungarian it 's `` enni \u00e9telt '' for eating , and `` inni italt '' for drinking . 
  also , because a large part of our language is ripped off of german , it 's `` k\u00e9rdezni k\u00e9rd\u00e9st '' for asking questions . 
   a beautiful mind - his friends are all a part of his beautiful mind, 
  that was a spoiler ? 
  i thought it was the premise, 
  con air ? 
  happened to me too . 
  i grew up in hungary , and did n't have much opportunity to see american movies . 
  unfortunately i watched the movie alone . 
  i later showed it it my father , who was n't very impressed . 
  that 's what the movie was , though . 
  and it rocked, 
  you 've got mail ? 
  this is the downside of knowing your mathematics history , i guess . 
  then again i doubt anybody was in suspense about what would happen in * titanic *, 
  forget the last three . 
  well , i have n't seen `` closing time '' in a while ; maybe there 's something to it . 
  but based on the trailer it definitely will take a major turn, 
  australia can into inevitable union with boat people, 
  what did you expect , tengriism ? 
  \u1d35 \u1d4f\u1db0\u1d52\u02b7 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b8 ' \u02b3\u1d49 \u1d52\u02b3\u1d57\u02b0\u1d52\u1d48\u1d52\u02e3 \u02b8\u1d52\u1d58 \u1d48\u1d52\u1db0 ' \u1d57 \u1db0\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48 \u1d57\u1d52 \u02e2\u1d43\u02b8, 
  would make an amazing gif, 
  aotd 1 : depends , generally i use cursewords like any other kind of english words , and because of my limited memory i do n't use a great variety of obscene phrases . 
  but i 'll try not to curse around small children . 
  aotd 2 : hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, 
  aotd 3 : too late , clock 's run out !, 
  now to spend the rest of my life being miserable ( unless i only have thirty minutes because i 'm about to die , in which case , problem solved ), 
  no , zombie apocalypses are n't fun no matter what . 
  everyone dying is not fun for me, 
  i was disappointed because i thought i 'd learn something new :(, 
  have i been doing it wrong literally the entire time since i 've gotten my citizenship ? 
  well , except recently i got this mustard/sauerkraut mix . 
  it 's delicious as hell, 
  have you tried pinching ? 
  works for me, 
  edit : no wait it does n't , now . 
  maybe it 's the size ? 
  and further north , rocket fizz probably sells it, 
  to not spoil it !, 
  how do you get out of it ? 
  obviously you ca n't have negative diplo-points forever , but you also ca n't diplo-annex your vassals , and releasing them would be undesirable . 
  how do you make that work ? 
  it seems like a weak trade-off . 
  you ca n't even build diplo buildings . 
  i do n't trust them anymore after they gave an overwhelmingly positive review for `` kill the moon '' !, 
  did n't like the pacing or the reveal , and it all felt kind of out of character ( or in the case of the woman , flat character ) . 
  it was the first miss in a series of hits for me so it was particularly jarring . 
  ah well , just means i ca n't rely on outpost skaro to have the same tastes as me !, 
  me too , i picked up dw right at the start of series 4 , and i 've been absent one way or another for the first part of each two-parter . 
  even library/forest , which is my favorite set of dw episodes of all time .
