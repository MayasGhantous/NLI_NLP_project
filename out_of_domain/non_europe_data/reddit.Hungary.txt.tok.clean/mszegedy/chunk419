  yes very much . 
  i had to go down to minimal settings . 
  lenovo t430s running arch linux ; processor 's an i5 ( not sure about model or clock speed ) , graphics card 's a nvidia nvs 5400m ( yes it 's on ) . 
  autosave is the slowest ; that 's my 5400 rpm magnetic hard drive at work . 
  ... to my knowledge . 
  why would that be necessary ? 
  closest thing we have to that are nativity scenes !, 
  but we have dressed up santas too , 
  what 's the problem with massively different structure ? 
  euiv has never been very reductionist . 
  tbf there 's some complaining about local autonomy . 
  which is legitimate ; it really is a bad mechanic for non-euros . 
  but actually i appreciate the style change and this is one of my favorite arcs so far . 
  this is more like two 120 \u00b0 turns making a third 120 \u00b0 turn in the opposite direction, 
  thought they were hilarious for their own sake . 
  if i had more time i 'd go and read the shitty fanfiction these are actually based on, 
  hmm , thinking about that , that 's actually worse than mine , who did the opposite ; she withheld antidepressants and adhd medication from me . 
  ( and later refused to take antidepressants herself when she became depressed . ), 
  also a set of islands called hawaii , relatively easy to colonize as japan, 
  while it 's true that very rarely , a lipid molecule will switch places with one on the opposing side , you made it sound like the mcules themselves rotate, 
  eh i do n't think they 'd do the daleks + cybermen thing , for a finale no less , again after series 2, 
  a professional would do it properly , with comic sans and jpeg, 
  that poor mummy :(, 
  edit : also the werewolf, 
  my favorite take on this is [ this smbc ] ( http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2594 ), 
  i think it 's just how long she 's been traveling with the doctor . 
  on the other hand it would be a great reveal if they reunite at the end, 
  thin, 
  male, 
  why does the video only use like 3 colors, 
  as hilarious as it is , i wish people would n't point to that to illustrate what would happen if the rules were repealed . 
  a lot of it was people being silly for the sake of being silly . 
  most of it , actually ; if you look at the list , it 's all regular submitters . 
  it 's probably a little similar , but unless it 's an honest , controlled experiment meant to determine exactly what it would be like if the sub had no rules , i 'm not happy with it as a model . 
  i thought this comic was a double zig-zag , like you expected the punchline to be about belgium 's severed hands , and then it was actually something else , but then the punchline turned out to be the severed hands anyway . 
  then i remembered about masturbation . 
  no way , more like http://i.imgur.com/ikpn7yn.png, 
  uralic ~ ~ stronk ~ ~ well , exists anyway, 
  say that about the [ trailer it 's based on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymdmzahyl6w ), 
  personally i liked the ending a lot , although maybe just because it completes a well-known formula, 
  yes . 
  everything is very choppy and slow . 
  here are my specs :, 
  - lenovo thinkpad t430s, 
  - intel core i5 vpro ( not sure what kind exactly ), 
  - nvidia nvs 5400m ( comp uses integrated graphics unless i tell it to ), 
  - 500 gib 5400 rpm magnet drive ( i 've got a ssd too , but i do n't use it for eu4 ), 
  the only way i was able to get the game running decently is to both turn the settings down to minimum and use the dedicated card instead of the integrated graphics . 
  if i do n't do one of those then it runs terribly . 
  [ i never thought i 'd link one of munroe 's stupid preachy comics , but here we are ] ( http://xkcd.com/1386/ ), 
  we 're not that incredible at natural language processing yet . 
  and if we do become good enough at it to effectively replace human translators , then a lot more jobs than just translation will become obsolete . 
  his overall goal was decent and it would have been fun for everybody to get superpowers , but his plan was really stupid and immoral . 
  why the hell do you need to kill off all the supers and destroy a city ? 
  do you really need advertising * that badly ? 
   kid should have become some amazing genetic engineer . 
  i was gon na complain that genetic engineering is nothing like rearranging components of toys , but then again i played with lego technic sets as a kid and now i 'm a protein engineer , so you may be on to something, 
  meh i 'd rather see him first put work into making everybody not look like freaking lizards , and then release the vector, 
  those also get grease all over your hands . 
  the only solution is to use some sort of grabbing implement . 
  ( not chopsticks , those are too short ), 
  screw the ketchup at that point, 
  you need mongolic ancestry, 
  wait for a patch, 
  ethnicity is complicated , but it 's generally not a surprise when very general ethnic groups are large . 
  it 's probably not very mind-blowing to you that han chinese and indo-aryan people each make up about 17 % of the world 's population . 
  [  original series line ] ( / 4chan ), 
  [  like it ever appeared on the show ] ( / 4chan ), 
  both wario and waluigi are portmanteaus of the word `` warui '' ( `` bad '' ) and the name of the respective hero . 
  `` waluigi '' sounds way better than `` wuigi '', 
  they forgot paradox games , where on the fastest setting it 's less than a second . 
  and in turn-based strategy games you can have years last arbitrarily small amounts of time . 
  ( civ might be a winner , because in early turns you can jump millennia . 
  but being turn-based , they might be excluded . ), 
  okay , but then he 's a badly-written antihero . 
  why does he always go crazy towards the end ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  i just wish he 'd be less willing to kill good-aligned species . 
  he outright declares himself a `` speciesist '' ; should n't he know that 's wrong ? 
  geez what kind of cynical misanthrope are you, 
  must be , since you already have upvotes from me , probably from / r/linguistics, 
  but it 's * const * anti-no-pole . 
  so constantly against discrimination against poles . 
  it 's only complicated when populations overlap . 
  5000 years ago it was easier : culture correlated with language and genetics . 
  now you get entire syncretic populations , including mine to an extent , the hungarians . 
  we 're linguistically uralic , ethnically turkic , and culturally slavic , more or less . 
  also we look white . 
  why do people not like this picture so much ? 
  i meant the altaic peoples in general . 
  what 's the joke with `` mydrane '' ? 
  :d if you do n't know this comic , [ go read all of them !, 
  ] ( http://www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus.html ) it is like calvin and hobbes , but with less snark and more weird . 
  [ not according to the wiki ] ( http://www.eu4wiki.com/client_state ), 
  tbf jupiter is * all * clouds . 
  but good job , and welcome to the stargazing community !, 
  join us over at / r/astronomy !, 
  ethnically chinese , culturally and linguistically malay ... oh boy, 
  that 's alright , we love to see even grainy little blobs !, 
  if you ever take any pics , be sure to post them .
