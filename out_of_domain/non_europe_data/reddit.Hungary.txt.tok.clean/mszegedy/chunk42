  this works for practically every aspect of linguistics , in fact . 
  even tense : i could invent a tense that always refers to the exact time that gavrilo princip shot archduke ferdinand ( which is around 1914 , june 28 , 10:45 am ) , and that would be a new tense !, 
  i could invent a tense each for every point in time , down to infinite subdivisions . 
  some cultures have tenses for the time of and following the beginning of the universe , the ancestral past , or somesuch . 
  there is always more ground to cover when working with linguistic properties . 
  and this does happen to linguists working in the field !, 
  what they will usually do ... what are the only things they are capable of doing is one of two things :, 
  use an existing name for that particular method of inflection . 
  this is the default choice . 
  this leads to extensive confusion sometimes : the latin ablative , for example , has practically nothing to do with the actual prescriptive meaning of `` ablative '' , which means that the noun in question is being moved away from ( so , essentially a substitute for our preposition `` from '' ) . 
  why they chose to stick it under ablative , only god knows . 
  a better choice would have been `` oblique '' , or possibly `` instrumental '' , the former of which is often used to describe cases that do a great number of different things ( which the latin ablative sure does ) . 
  see what i did there ? 
  i called it the `` latin '' ablative . 
  this is what enda up happening to property names that are co-opted by this . 
  for example , in moods , there is the french subjunctive , the spanish subjunctive , the latin subjunctive , the * english * subjunctive ( essentially an imperative clause with the subject stated as well ) , and i suppose one could also even refer to the hungarian subjunctive . 
  what does the subjunctive mood actually do , you ask ? 
  no one knows anymore !, 
  they have had to split it up , because it had been co-opted into oblivion . 
  it is an appropriate thing for me to refer to , for example , the `` jussive subjunctive '' , which typically describes the subjunctive being used in an imperative fashion ( this actually replaces the imperative in hungarian ) . 
  take the case of latin . 
  they ca n't call it the imperative , because that particular inflection paradigm is used elsewhere in the language as well . 
  they ca n't call it the imperative subjunctive , either , because latin * also * has an imperative mood , with subtle differences between the two . 
  but they still have to have a different name for each mood , and so they apply names used so obnoxiously to describe similar moods in other languages . 
  invent a new name for the property , typically with latin roots ( take a look at every single case in the list i have for gallifreyan : linguists came up with these names on the fly ) . 
  this is only employed when the property is radically different from any other existing one in any other language , that already has a name . 
  i did this in my language : i talked about a `` substitutive '' case , which describes the noun being replaced by something else . 
  this name did n't exist until i came up with it . 
  yet , no name existed at that point to serve my purpose . 
  so , i came up with one that any other linguist would have come up with , that describes the purpose of the case most accurately . 
  it requires little thought , but leads to long lists and destroys nuance . 
  this is n't a third option , just what idiot came up with the name `` possessed case '' ? 
  so , in conclusion , use whatever cases work for you , and only those . 
  once you start trying to use one language to describe all others , this gets really messy !, 
  hey , idea : just call linguistic properties whatever they are called in their language . 
  it 's universal ... 
  ... but it 's not immediately obvious from the name what it does , and a lot of times languages have properties that match exactly ( cases that operate on morphosyntactic alignment are this : direct , nominative , accusative , ergative , absolutive , intransitive , and transitive are all objective . 
  unless you have split-ergativity , but that 's a small minority ) . 
  fuck , just forget it , just keep using our stupid system of organization like an asshole . 
  it 's the best we can do . 
  tl ; dr `` language is descriptive not prescriptive you homo ! '', 
  shit , when did this happen ? 
  here 's a download link instead then :, 
  ( lovingly typed out for you by hand because mediafire is an asshole to my iphone ), 
  i am so / r/nocontext-ing this . 
  and everything looks like a drill ? 
  well , it would also have made sense for jake to get vriska . 
  i assumed it was frogs because it had meant that in te past ? 
  see the top comment . 
  it was afrokid . 
  aw no come on jadesprite was cool, 
  what 's `` shermans '' ? 
  yeah but it 's 4 am and i 'm lazy/tired/on my iphone : /, 
  someone kill it, 
  yes . 
  you do , do n't you ? 
  no just that they could complement each other well, 
  and i was so so so so wrong, 
  we were so wrong it 's not even funny . 
  ah , then no . 
  this is ideographic/logographic , and applying an alphabet would n't make the slightest bit of sense . 
  well , we could have them be words for the phonemes represented by those letters in ipa , but what 's the point . 
  it has also done wonders for my cunt . 
  the reasoning is that people do n't make as much ( that is , as sufficient ) effort to distinguish between people of other races . 
  which would be a racist thing to do . 
  however , it 's unrealistic to expect that everyone be able to tell apart everyone in that manner . 
  this is true !, 
  and , even , one of them can do it across time as well , as shown in [ s ] make her pay , enabling vriska to do the double psychic reacharound to younger terezi . 
  i believe it is vriska . 
  i thought vriska looked a lot older that terezi in that flash !, 
  hah , derp , i 'm fucking retarded . 
  thanks !, 
  it was . 
  let 's see who can be worse at geography . 
  welp , that bit of rage sure got destroyed . 
  reminds me of the mexico city [ earthscraper ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2048395/earth-scraper-architects-design-65-storey-building-300-metres-ground.html ) . 
  thank god no one made any porn of it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ although ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sure . 
  although , it * did * lack the kernel halo . 
  welcome !, 
  i hope it works !, 
  ( my tests have proved it fairly certain , p  97 ), 
  one of the * least * comforting . 
  \u00c6rated . 
  best word . 
  my otp !, 
  this is indeed extremely beautiful . 
  this ca n't just come from any hand , but also not just any mind . 
  the artistic direction here is ingenious ; the artist used lighting to pleasing \u00e6sthetic effect , as well as symbolic effect ( and literal effect : she 's the thief of * light * , of course ) . 
  the inward texture of john 's hood really animates his otherwise essentially monochrome outfit ( okay , dichrome : blue , and less dark blue ) . 
  ~ ~ i am not fond of his body position , but i like the general idea ; i just think that his leg should be oriented somewhat less further-in . ~ ~ haha derp that 's his hood . 
  also , vriska 's puffy face becomes her less ; she 's generally more lean , and has more sapience behind her facial expressions . 
  wow , this is really cool . 
  edit : oh , and the artist could have done something with the background . 
  unless , the purple void was intentional ? 
  nah , they were probably just not looking forward to drawing lowas or something . 
  terezi , is that you ? 
  i like it very much !, 
  you portray john in the sort of light that i like - not to much derp , not too much anime , not too much hero ... a young kid on an awesome adventure . 
  and it 's similar to hussie 's style as well , which agrees with me a lot .
