  there was another poster saying the same thing , but with milk rather than water . 
  duly noted about the flavor ; i 'll try out both . 
  you must be doing something wrong . 
  i 've played the beginnings of 3 ironman games as ottomans so far , and it was rather easy . 
  just diplo-annex dulkadir , while conquering bosnia/serbia , get the deus vult idea , and follow your missions and casus belli into the south and east ( you can do reconquest on karaman , candar , and qara qoyonlu , and you can deus vult all those stupid orthodox states in the east ) . 
  once you get the `` conquer the levant '' mission you can go attack the mamluks , and if you have n't rushed too much or wasted too much money ( e.g. 
  hiring better than +1 advisors is pointless ) , you should be brimming with resources \\* with which to do it . 
  you do n't even need to do much about the rebels ; if you maintain roughly +1 stability throughout the whole thing ( which you should get by annexing constantinople ) , the rebels should be infrequent enough that your large army can deal with them . 
  if you really want , boost to +2 stability and raise autonomy , but it should n't be necessary . 
  the only disadvantage is that the constant expending of monarch points will leave you behind in tech , but given your new border with genoa , that just means you 'll get to westernize earlier . 
  * by which i mean money and manpower . 
  edit : whoops , you need deus vult to conquer serbia/bosnia ; what i meant is do things in this order :, 
  reconquer most/all cores from karaman and co. , and diplo-annex athens and dulkadir, 
  conquer the balkans, 
  accept your mission to conquer southeast anatolia or whatever, 
  conquer southeast anatolia or whatever , also optionally the caucasus, 
  keep accepting and completing conquering missions until you get the mission `` conquer the levant '', 
  if you 've been spending monarch points but not much else liberally , by now you should be in great shape to deal with the mamluks . 
  you should n't get rebels very frequently in the meantime if you avoid raising your unrest for any reason and avoid losing stab . 
  ( it 's probably defending its eggs ), 
  that 's what i thought , but then, 
   even as an ottoman player the advance in muslim lands seems harder than the austro-hungarian front . 
  so i figured better safe than sorry . 
  thanks , this is super helpful !, 
  one question , why would i bother attacking qq ? 
  i do n't really need their land , and this way i can release persia early and not have to deal with any revolts . 
  \\  mfw i own all provinces local to the node , too, 
  granted , but deus vult is an even more valuable cb in 1.8 because of its ae reduction ( since diplomacy has been fixed to make more sense now ) . 
  also the additional tolerance of the true faith is super helpful . 
  i think it might be because now their `` conquer the mamluks '' missions do n't appear as often . 
  you do n't get a say in this unless you [ flair up !,

  in high school and college i did n't care . 
  nowadays though if i had to take a test with my coworkers i 'd probably feel very self-conscious about it . 
  new new rev. 
  great rev. 
  new new cosmopolitaine colombian holy roman empire and knuckles, 
  yup . 
  means you 're in the middle of an ironman game and not connected to the internet . 
  it 's probably nothing to worry about . 
  you should never get mad at jokes about your country just because they 're somewhat inaccurate , but if they 're entirely not funny -- like these ones , owing to their overuse and lack of variation -- go after 'em with pitchforks . 
  plus latvia has few gypsies . 
  eh good luck with that . 
  hope to see this coming out well . 
  is the american government actually more indecisive than other western ones , or is it just that more comics get made about it because it 's an anglo ? 
  nope . 
  you eat them , but you ca n't shear them .

  just saying `` update '' makes it impossible to tell the posts apart, 
  as dumb as these are , i prefer them to painful pics from my ex . 
  my condolences . 
  :( it 's very , very hard to lose a family member like that . 
  i wonder what he would say about this post though !, 
  he 'd probably understand reddit 's reaction and be able to predict every comment . 
  you have to start somewhere . 
  art made by tracing is still art . 
  and , as a bonus , when you take it out , it looks like you 're holding a ball of water, 
  i have also observed `` omgggggg '' , `` fmllllllll '' , and the like . 
  sure it is !, 
  it 's just less impressive than if you had n't traced it . 
  that 's typically what it does for me . 
  i * want * it as a new game , but programming all the other stuff is too much work . 
  i guess you can think of it as a total conversion mod . 
  same , in hungary they talk in hungarian . 
  how curious !,

  fuck it , seeming eager is entirely fine, 
  the 90s called , they want their animation back,

  it always works,

  / r/vxcirclejerk, 
  yeah , i could only see her arm . 
  now that you mention it though i notice the whole thing . 
  i need to get better at this . 
  just found it out myself . 
  but seriously , i hope memes do n't become regular posts here . 
  we might need to make a separate sub like / r/vxmemes or / r/oblidisktuners for those if they do . 
  what made you love souffl\u00e9 girl and victorian clara but not regular clara ? 
  i could never really get a sense of any of those ( although that might just be social impairment talking ; i am possibly the worst person at telling people apart that has ever existed ) . 
  this is probably a demonstration ; few people are this stupid , and normally this would make the gun blow up . 
  plus it 's cross-sectioned . 
  very good gun though . 
  jeez just looking at that makes me shiver .
