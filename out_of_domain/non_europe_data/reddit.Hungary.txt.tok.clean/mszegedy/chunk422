  was it fun ? 
  see anything worth getting frostbite for ? 
  ironically it took me a while to see what you were referring to , whereas irl i find it completely irresistible to look , in a do n't - think-about-pink-elephants sort of way . 
  anyway , tvtropes calls this [ absolute cleavage ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/absolutecleavage ) . 
  it 's pretty popular !, 
  a cockmuncher !, 
  ( damn , you should have said you 'd eat a cock ; you could have gotten away with only eating chicken ), 
  huh , til . 
  and they 're [ not even an outgroup in the phylogeny ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bilateria#phylogeny ) . 
  would n't ted cruz want fast internet ? 
  you 're welcome ?!, 
  i do n't think ikimaru appreciates how bloody and hurt terezi is right now, 
  well , they * are * rather important in developmental biology,

  alas , i only know tok pisin and english, 
  doom , it does n't make any fucking sense . 
  ( you even referred to them as elements the second time , you so had it coming ), 
  i 'd either even it out a little so that more things are animated at better-paced intervals , or convert all the flashes to html5 , * or * get rid of the dumb fractal sub-acts, 
  i just realized i called you `` tastymilkshake '' rather than `` magicpastry '' . 
  heheheh , they used to not be so crackpot !, 
  thankfully there are similarities though -- similar phonologies , topic-prominence . 
  ah , i wish ... you been ? 
  the closest i 've dived to the south pacific is bali , which was pretty awesome ; they have octopuses !, 
  but imo a better experience was when i visited [ lady elliot island ] ( http://www.ladyelliot.com.au/ ) for a week next to australia . 
  it 's fucking tiny and surrounded by coral . 
  all i did was snorkel , but wow , there was so much life !, 
  it 's the most lush location i 've ever visited , marine-wise . 
  learn some history , jungle-brit !, 
  hold out !, 
  there are people just waiting for you to discover the cure to cancer or something . 
  marine biology might be cool , but you 'll never help anyone that way !, 
  the airplane landing strip goes from one end of the island to the other . 
  it takes about 30 minutes to walk the perimeter of the island , if you are going very slowly . 
  it 's about the size of a very small town . 
  edit : [ here 's a picture ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/1525694_808152625877334_618989257_n.jpg?oh=c7f8c6f915bd8f36e0d27e7e3e168580&amp;oe=54e98c34&amp;__gda__=1428047906_1c88dcd416fd06176c3751e487f108e3 ) ; the light stuff around it is underwater coral , not land for walking on, 
  view from my terrace looks exactly like this in berkeley ca . 
  different trees though obviously , and you ca n't see the ground . 
  there 's hummingbirds sometimes, 
  oh man mode 7 effects are always my favorite to look at . 
  shear effects on 2d maps in 16-bit consoles just have something about them that makes them look really cool . 
  every parody of pawn stars ever recites practically word-for-word this chain of comments . 
  it 's really that repetitive ? 
  you do n't need one :, 
  but regexes are less useful/impressive when they match things outside the group of things that they 're supposed to match , and if we tried to make one of those , you 'd need irish separately . 
  except you can only fire once, 
  [ i made one !, 
  ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/view/?vit1471bbm612a7 ) based on doctor who . 
  no phonology or vocabulary , though . 
  first conlang i ever made . 
  edit : rereading this kind of makes me want to flesh it out again . 
  it would make an amazing calligraphic script . 
  on the other hand the only currency you can use is real money :(, 
  \\  mfw your lab looks exactly like my lab, 
  protein crystal oblinomics , right ? 
  10/10 for the unidan reference !, 
  but i happen to agree with you . 
  vx modules have to generate a flux field to be a vx module . 
  if they do n't , then they 're not a vx module . 
  it 's that simple . 
  i did n't even notice . 
  that was great , i have to watch this show . 
  on the other hand , making fun of `` syntax errors '' is mean and wrong .
