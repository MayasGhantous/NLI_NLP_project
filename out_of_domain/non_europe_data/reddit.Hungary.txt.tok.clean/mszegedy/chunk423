  but that was like 10 seconds of the whole thing ; the rest was solid gold . 
  nah i just have a stick up my ass about calling one form of communication better than an other . 
  ( good job , your `` statistical significance '' means that they 're probably speaking their own idiolects , you * complete moron * ) this dude is amazingly funny . 
  here 's the thing . 
  this was without ever allying with crimea at all !, 
  alas , now i 'm in the middle of a coalition war , getting raped by poland , austria , and bavaria . 
  my only ally is the timurids ( reasonably strong , they 've even got a large militarily capable vassal ) , and the idiots went after hejaz in the far south instead . 
  i think if i had n't horribly mismanaged the start of the war ( build up my army to about 70k in size , eventually get forced to attack with all of it at once ) , i 'd 've fared better , but now they 've occupied all of former hungary and then some , and my warscore 's at -15 . 
  good luck with the inheritance war , though . 
  edit : inheritance , not coalition . 
  aceh is very fun . 
  it 's like playing as england or castile , but the people you conquer are right next door . 
  happy birthday !, 
  one of the news articles about it suffers an unfortunate case of muphry 's law , misspelling `` gabor '' as `` grabor '' . 
  ( it 's the hungarian version of `` gabriel '' . ), 
  the cartoon is sarcastic , though . 
  maybe i 'm confusing him with another cartoonist , but is n't larson famously anti-new media ? 
  would n't practically anything have msg in it `` naturally '' ? 
  neither sodium ions nor glutamate ions are especially uncommon in the cytoplasm of most cells . 
  women , water , fire , violence , and certain animals !, 
  you joke but that was ( is ? ), 
  a fairly common name . 
  it 's greek !, 
  because it 's convenient for n-choose-k , and because the analytical extension , the gamma function , also has 1 at that place . 
  ( gamma of x is ( x-1 ) ! , so i mean that gamma of 1 is 1 . ), 
  [ basque tnt ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ not stolen from spanish ] ( #green - text ), 
  i can write programs to generate a png with the text in it . 
  but i 'd rather have an actual font put together using lines drawn in inkscape . 
  what do you mean ? 
  modifying a large project like an editor , even in small ways , would be very difficult for you , as a beginner , so i do n't recommend it , but if you think it 's feasible you can give it a shot . 
  he 's spades slick, 
  any project by someone else is big , when you 're starting out . 
  but yeah , unfortunately even [ tiny ones ] ( https://github.com/hackerwins/imejs ) are rather large . 
  what 's more is usually the comments are in chinese or something . 
  you can understand them , though !, 
  it just takes effort . 
  you 're right , i should stop using reddit, 
  i knew how it 's pronounced in english and i still did n't get it, 
  alas , hungarian is more like a uralic-based creole rather than a straight uralic language . 
  even our singular personal pronouns are turkic , dammit . 
  ( humorless people take note : i am not literally claiming hungarian is a creole ), 
  from the point of view of a non-ie speaker , everyone in your comic 's just in one group , hungary , finland , and estonia are in another , and poor basque is still alone by itself . 
  hey , actually , if we 're going to include languages that do n't have their own states , why not add a few more , like all the minor romance languages and minor slavic languages ? 
  romansh and sardinian , sorbian and church slavonic ... also the varieties of romani , although they do n't genetically constitute a family . 
  also do n't forget about the jews !, 
  you can have a jew-box both in the germanic group and by itself . 
  final thought :, 
  [ armenia ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ european and having only one language ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ implying turkey is n't europe but armenia is ] ( #green - text ), 
  not related to any * living * language . 
  we know plenty of languages related to basque , like aquitanian and all the iberian languages ( the latter probably ; it 's possible that they are not genetically related , but there 's certainly related vocabulary ) . 
  and on top of all the uralic languages they listed , there 's even more !, 
  ingrian , veps , votic , probably some other really tiny more exotic ( read : not finnic ) ones dying off near perm . 
  after all , everything west of the urals is europe , is n't it ? 
  when they blew up that train , though , the tnt was stolen . 
  using russia is cheating !, 
  also they do n't have their own flags . 
  nope nope nope . 
  uralic languages = / = altaic languages ( unless you 're stuck in the 60s ) , and even the genetic relationship between the macro-altaic languages is spurious . 
  also slavic i guess . 
  but that 's one flag for two languages . 
  same with the permic languages . 
  you could include karelia , though . 
  fair point . 
  [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operaci%c3%b3n_ogro ), 
  i 'd understand it if you were replying to my comment about the vasconic languages being related to the iberian languages , or about the uralic languages not being related to the altaic languages ( although that one has been generally accepted for decades now ) , but what 's particularly controversial about * this * comment ? 
  armenia not being european ? 
  [ implying nordicks are christian ] ( #green - text ), 
   the taiwanese barely exist, 
  ftfy, 
  ottomans are n't arabs , although they * are * part of the muslim world . 
  turkey does seem to be doing well these days compared to the middle east, 
  you 'd think this subreddit would n't like the movie very much , considering its framerate, 
  kind of like our [ reddit-ese ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/23g441/reddit_lang_vocabulary_ideas_1/ ), 
  it 's tongue-in-cheek , ( sh ) e means `` everything '' , as a form of hyperbole, 
  i love italy 's glasses ; clever way to get around the `` no hair '' rule, 
  expected one-panel picture of belgium , nothing more, 
  imo that 's best left for more complex games with a larger element of realism , like eu4 . 
  at least the colors are right, 
  my god , i 'd like to have a shiny ass like that . 
  mine is all hairy and disgusting . 
  :o imagine all the metallines you could enaggerate with this !, 
   make the top rated : today , this week , this month , this year etc , somewhere visible . 
  i think that would be kind of useless for a site where the material is as diverse as youtube . 
  on porn sites the purpose of all the material is the same : to get people horny . 
  as a result , each video can serve as a substitute for any other video , making a `` top videos '' list useful , since what you were going to do anyway was look for videos that get you horny . 
  on youtube it might be useful if you usually go on youtube looking for something funny , or epic rap battles of history or whatever . 
  but that 's nowhere near universal , so it should n't be a universal feature . 
  that was horrible . 
  do those episodes have real stingers that i was just missing out on because i lived in america ? 
  i effected fire on the zombies . 
  twitter shut down their api ? 
  d : a sad day for the field of linguistics in general, 
  * that * would be awesome . 
  unfortunately google rarely seems to be that smart about things . 
  edit : you might want to hold the number of users per group constant rather than the amount of groups , though . 
  and [ this ] ( http://longestjokeintheworld.com/ ) is the ultimate shaggy dog story ( ignore all the bullshit psychoanalysis at the end ), 
  you can see continuous sections of grey blocks at the beginning that later do n't make it into the bin .
