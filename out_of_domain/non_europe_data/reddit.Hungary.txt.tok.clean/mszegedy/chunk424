  very interesting . 
  it 's a lot more complex . 
  the music is all made up of a small variety of very short repeated notes . 
  that looks great . 
  we have this kind of kebab in hungary too , but somehow i do n't remember it tasting as good as this looks . 
  now i have to go back and eat some . 
  it looks great !, 
  thanks !, 
  * super paper mario * technically counts . 
  and it 's a great game , too . 
  thanks , this looks amazing !, 
  on the snes itself , too . 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  edit : dammit i did n't see `` first world '' . 
  fine , there 's still belgium , spain , and the uk . 
  - india, 
  - ukraine for that matter, 
  - china ? 
  - somalia ( how did it take me so long to think of this one ? 
  this is surely the prizewinner for `` least united country on the planet '' ... iirc it was invaded by italy though , so you were close , in a way ), 
  - papua new guinea ( either somalia or this one ), 
  - spain, 
  - indonesia ? 
  - syria and/or iraq, 
  - mexico, 
  - even [ poland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nrgy0xt.png ) for chrissakes ( credit / u/mo4gv9eywmpmw3xr , thread [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/23upkg/a_b_the_tale_of_two_polands/ ) ), 
  thanks , watched tb playthrough , looks promising !, 
  wow , thank you so much for putting this together !, 
  holy crap these are some great suggestions . 
  this is enough games to last for years !, 
  fuck of course it has to be when i 'm out of country . 
  i 'm afraid not , only metroid games . 
  sotn is on my list though , especially since `` bloody tears '' was one of the first songs i learned on the piano . 
  no , the doctor never said that . 
  it was n't even conceived in english ; it was conceived in northeastern prydonian gallifreyan . 
  if you have trouble believing that , then it was conceived in hungarian . 
  gloss ( please note that `` ins '' stands for `` instructive '' rather than `` instrumental '' ) :, 
  ##### first sentence ( bottom left , read bottom to top ) :, 
  some-nom solve-gno-pres . simp person-pl-nom a-acc problem-pl-acc a-ins consult [ gerv ] - s-ins a-acc book-s-acc, 
  ##### second sentence ( right , read top to bottom ) :,

  ##### fourth sentence ( center , read top to bottom ) :, 
  but i3-nom improvise.mir-pres . simp a-nom, 
  two notes on vocabulary :, 
  - `` but '' in the fourth sentence is n't literally `` but '' , rather a modal particle akin to hungarian `` meg '' or `` pedig '' , or tagalog `` naman '' . 
  it indicates that the subject of the sentence is different from the subjects of the previous sentences ( among other things , but this is how it 's being used here ) . 
  - `` i3 '' in the fourth sentence indicates that it 's a first-person singular pronoun , but it 's one of several possible first-person singular pronouns that could have been used , in this case being the third one . 
  ( less facetiously : it 's a logographic script , with morphological information tacked on to the outside via various graphemes , like the thicknesses of the surrounding lines , or the number and placement of orbs on said lines ; this example uses line width to convey morphology almost exclusively ), 
  * wednesday *, 
  i never recognize * anyone * from high school . 
  that 's partially because i only knew them for at most 2 years though . 
  - technically not a monkey , an ape, 
  - sort of , but it 's a coincidence, 
  * rolls eyes * 10 pm on a sunday is hardly a sunday . 
  you need to get into the scheduled webcomics game more , man !, 
  here 's how it works :, 
  - the update is scheduled for `` monday '', 
  - the update is released midnight between sunday and monday ( i.e. 
  sunday night ), 
  - people still say that the update was released monday, 
  saying a comic is gon na be released tuesday is implying you can stay up monday night and catch it !, 
  anatolia is especially valuable to acquire ; high base tax , good for producing units with and building buildings in . 
  congrats you wrote exactly what i was going to , char-for-char . 
  man i 'd love to go and get op to illustrate my edge fanfics . 
  first i have to write some though . 
  the edge universe was brilliant , but , ironically considering its large number of illustrations , not illustrated enough imo . 
  i guess what i 'm looking for is a motion picture ? 
  an * animated movie * , drawn by chris riddell . 
  e-rectin ' a dispenser !, 
  dammit i had a whole long response typed out about what the experience of waiting for a comic posted `` midnight est '' is like around the world , but my power cut out and i lost the whole thing . 
  basically though , seriously , take it from someone who 's lived in most of 'em , the experience varies wildly from time zone to time zone around the world ; in europe you get it in early morning , in russia and india you get it while you 're at school , in eastern asia and australia you get it sometime in the afternoon , in nz you get it early evening and in hawaii late evening . 
  and in each of those time zones ( except hawaii ) , a comic posted on `` wednesday '' is a comic posted on wednesday !, 
  referring to the date that a comic is posted has a completely different meaning for a lot of people , but it 's entirely reasonable to use the date that the comic 's posted in est as a universal convention for when the comic 's posted , especially since that 's when basically everyone gets it . 
  ( atm i live in west coast usa myself . 
  i freely admit that this time zone is irrelevant in the face of the vast majority of other time zones , and that it 's practically the same as on the east coast . ), 
  oh man this takes some dedication to fuck up , but the same thing 's happened to me once too !, 
  i get to new jersey after i spent several months in california ( where i live ) . 
  it 's a thursday . 
  i came by car , for over a week , bringing all of my sister 's belongings in these huge boxes . 
  it was a rather epic journey , and while it was fun and scenic , i 'm glad the trip is over . 
  except i 'm going to hungary next !, 
  i scheduled the flight for a saturday . 
  i figured it was the saturday after i came back ; after all , who wants to spend an entire week in new jersey ? 
  so through friday i frantically unpack all of the contents of the boxes and install them in the correct places in my sister 's house ( you would n't * believe * how much clothes my sister has ) , * and * pack all of * my * belongings so i can go to hungary on saturday ( tbf those are n't much ... passport , boarding pass , toothbrush , laptop ) . 
  so i groggily get up saturday morning and drive all the way to newark airport ... and it turns out i scheduled it for * next * saturday so that i could get in a breather . 
  this is what i get for scheduling my tickets months in advance . 
  you do n't pay in money ; you pay in stress . 
  and before that , in classical latin , it meant `` witty '' !, 
  brilliant work man . 
  like i said below , it is * very * chris riddell . 
  in fact , i am considering the possibility that you are literally him . 
  anyway though i love drawings of eldritch creatures , and also admire your ability to do shading with only two colors at your disposal . 
  the whole thing ended up looking very cool !, 
  you got any more ? 
  do it , but in non-ironman !, 
  huh . 
  must be a new feature . 
  meh you can have even very smart people spell badly when typing colloquially , while getting good grades in english .
