  while there were several state-ish entities that took that name , the one you can form in eu4 does n't really correspond to any of them . 
  folk metal confirmed for sounding the same from one side of the continent to the other . 
  in hungary our folk metal uses flutes to complement the modern guitar , with the same sort of jumpy tune and scale , so it sounds very similar to this . 
  the estonians are not ethnically nordic , and the galicians are not ethnically celtic . 
  it fits !, 
  damn , i never knew where this fandom 's reputation for obscure references came from until this moment . 
  i 'm not sure , but it 's also been [ extended to well past that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4doqgqgqbkk ), 
  but but muh deus vult, 
  epirus has a lot of cores and their rebels are possible for centuries into the game . 
  they even get * cyprus . 
  * ( but they 're not a problem , usually , if you 've got half a brain when you play the ottomans . ), 
  maybe without the big red circle, 
  obviously this means that you should conquer them . 
  i 'm sure everyone here can attest to having waged a war because of labels . 
  brilliant !, 
  my only two problems with this ( which are both minor ) :, 
  - john 's zappy powers no longer serve much of a plot purpose . 
  maybe typheus makes his zappy powers take him to that session , but you 'd think the denizen 's power would be sufficient . 
  - lowas would remain destroyed , which is inelegant ( not to mention genocide ! ), 
  [ proteins in 1958 !, 
  ] ( http://proteopedia.org/wiki/images/3/3a/myoglobin1958.png ) this is our first ever protein structure determined by crystallography ( or any means ) , and is of myoglobin , attributable to kendrew and perutz . 
  perutz had the following to say about it :, 
   could the search for ultimate truth really have revealed so hideous and visceral looking an object ? 
  kendrew , meanwhile , wrote in the [ paper  ( http://libgen.org/scimag/get.php?doi=10.1038%2f181662a0 ), 
   perhaps the most remarkable features of the molecule are its complexity and its lack of symmetry . 
  the arrangement seems to be almost totally lacking in the kind of regularities which one instinctively anticipates , and it is more complicated than has been predicated by any theory of protein structure . 
  it 's alright , kendrew , most proteins are oligomers !, 
  there 's a few other pictures of the structure in the paper , and [ this ] ( http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/i053/10321094.aspx ) is the actual model that the picture is of . 
  beyond that i 'm not sure what you 're looking for -- i do n't know of any other early pictures of proteins ( they discovered a high-res structure of myoglobin pretty soon after ) . 
  - if you like artistic depictions of molecular machinery , check out [ david goodsell ] ( http://mgl.scripps.edu/people/goodsell/ ) ; the style gets a little wearisome after a while , but it looks fantastic regardless . 
  - if you just like to look at proteins , you can query any database ( pdb being the primary one ) for some , and you 'll find rendered 3d structures in there . 
  if you want , you can even take the structure 's file , load it into your favorite modeling program ( namd , jmol , rosetta if you have it ) and get a lot of different viewing options . 
  - probably the best thing for just looking at pictures of proteins , though , is the [ rcsb pdb ] ( http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do ) , which includes a `` molecule of the month '' series ( illustrated by david goodsell !, 
  ) , and many pretty pictures and metadata . 
  it even has its own excellent ios app !, 
  i do n't know the first one , but the second one says , `` die with us brother '' . 
  vote : this is the most disturbing comic ( and panel ) in paranatural so far . 
  that sounds significantly better, 
  getting texts on an airplane ? 
  how , wifi + imessage ? 
  those italian flavored potato chips made my mouth water, 
  wtf did you do , declare war on kilwa/malindi ? 
  the consonant clusters fit, 
  brittany thinks it 's a great power ? 
  that 's adorable, 
  how are you going to avoid getting pounded by france , poland , and co ? 
  unfortunately in vanilla , client states are only available by admin tech ~ ~ 28 ~ ~ 22 or something , i.e. 
  late game, 
  i love the style , where everyone 's a throwaway character !, 
  america , yuo * still * inferior to all europ !, 
  we can apart languages us tell fine !, 
  itt : delicious slavic tears, 
  then that 's what , sorry, 
  do you even need to try for that anymore , though , in 1.8 ? 
  byzantium forms very often . 
  i 'd like to play a game where i free as many of the weirder and more obscure nations as i can . 
  it would probably just turn into a wc , but damn if it would n't be interesting . 
  possibilities :, 
  - op allies with spain and/or england often, 
  - op wars france often and gets them to release nations, 
  - terrible luck for france ; i 've at least seen independent brittany pretty often, 
  i still do n't understand . 
  w does he mean ? 
  it did look vaguely similar to that , but i do n't think it 's in terebellidae for two reasons :, 
  - there was no tube or burrow anywhere , as is characteristic of terebellids, 
  - terebellids are n't found anywhere near the aegean sea ; they live in oceans and scandinavia, 
  you gave me a thought just now , though . 
  maybe it was a bivalve with tentacles ? 
  - more jade and calliope, 
  - meaning we avoid a direct panel of a denizen yet again ( although sb 's work is fine ), 
  - we might not find out what the deal was until at least the update after this one, 
  huh . 
  such as ? 
  generate words using a [ context-free grammar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/context-free_grammar ) with only single-letter expansions, 
  hooray , finally the fabled typheus panel we 've been waiting for since act 4 !, 
  i 'm kind of glad ah left his face to our imagination . 
  alright then , i 'll go with terebellid ; thanks for all the help guys !, 
  okay then i guess that 's what it was !, 
  thanks for all the help !, 
   your ( fantastic ) description !, 
  aww shucks :p, 
  `` i could have done * so ... much ... 
  more !, 
  that line sold it for me . 
  i think this thread speaks to how greatly people 's opinions are influenced by circumstance . 
  the console-smashing scene was undeniably great , but i watched it at a time when i was n't very emotionally invested in doctor who . 
  as a result , it just does n't compare to tennant 's farewell , which ended the run of my favorite doctor , who influenced my very personality . 
  the downside of this realization is that you get to thinking about how many times this very cognitive effect may have screwed you over , from when i did n't get picked for some game as a kid possibly because of a first impression , to when my fianc\u00e9e left me possibly because of the same . 
  i guess you 're supposed to just suck it up and * make * your luck . 
   i 'm a native speaker . 
  do n't think for a second that what is written on that page is scots . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's scottified english . 
  real scots is another beast . 
  figured  do these [ sample texts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_scots#sample_texts ) do it justice ? 
   though i do n't like how you dropped most cases quite late on . 
  it would be nicer if the oblique stayed . 
  now its just nominative and genitive . 
  examples ? 
  i see distinct nom/acc/gen cases for pronouns !,
