  cool !, 
  be careful with those examples ; the wikipedia mods will scrutinize it very carefully and may delete it for one obscure reason or other . 
  some observations :, 
  - you use the oblique on the pronouns as a genitive ? 
  - \\  mfw distinguishes 2s and 2pl ... 
  i think formal written english might be literally the only language to not do this . 
  on the other hand it does n't distinguish case for 2nd person at all , like most dialects of english . 
  - if i am mapping this right : < y  -  / i / , < e  -  / e / , < ei  -  / e : / , < u  -  / \u025c / , < \u00f9  -  / u : /,

  i am muslim , and it took surprisingly little work . 
  the original point was just to improve relations with them so that they do n't coalition against me , but then it turned out that i could ally them . 
  i was very surprised ; it must have taken a lot of luck . 
  they trusted me very much ; possibly because we both used to be simultaneously at war with hungary . 
  that might be my fault . 
  back when i absorbed hungary , hungary was allied with the hansa , whose asses i kicked .

  - infantry and cavalry in the back do n't attack, 
  - maneuver is one of the most important factors in a battle, 
  - discipline is a straight damage multiplier, 
  - annexing opm papal state without cb can cause so much ae that all of western europe forms a coalition against you, 
  - when poland collapses , it can spit out galicia-volhynia , which promptly forms ruthenia,

   presenting ... ... ... 
  presentin ' ? 
  that 's `` 3x '' , i.e. 
  3 times, 
  so the second one , then, 
  well , < e  is pronounced [ i ] when you say the letter 's name out loud ( and in a lot of other cases , like in `` meet '' , `` meat '' , or `` mete '' ) , and < i  is often pronounced [ \u026a ] , which sounds somewhat like [ \u025c ] , so it 's understandable . 
  also , the base word is `` price '' . 
  well , could have been brisbane , california, 
  because `` pricier '' , at least in general american , is pronounced something like [ \u02c8p\u0279a\u026asi\u025d ] , or [ \u02c8p\u0279a\u026asi\u025c\u0279 ] . 
  * as for [ \u026a ] sounding like [ \u025c ] : try pronouncing [ \u02c8p\u0279a\u026asi\u026a\u0279 ] . 
  it 'll sound very similar to [ \u02c8p\u0279a\u026asi\u025d ] . 
  putting practically any vowel before [ \u025d ] that 's both closer and fronter than it is difficult to tell apart from just saying it . 
  * although i 'm a lot more partial to the first one ; american does n't really have exactly [ \u0279 ] , it 's an r-colored vowel . 
  even [ p\u0279a\u026as ] should really be [ p\u025aa\u026as ] or something of the sort . 
  probably a person who actually studies american phonology can tell me . 
   the fact alone that both groups inhabited the iberian peninsula bordering one another would already explain the common vocabulary . 
  and there go most other arguments for genetic relationships as well ; altaicists vs anti-altaicists is the most familiar . 
  i 'm skeptical of a genetic relationship myself , though ; there 's not a lot of evidence connecting the two . 
  admittedly i mostly meant the paleohispanic languages , on the condition that they are genetically related to basque . 
  even if they are n't , though , vocabulary is a connection on its own , although not as exciting as being in the same language family . 
  probably random variation ; the numbers might just be accidentally similar between 2 and 3, 
  hungarian linguistics is frequently bad linguistics . 
  one of my most treasured possessions is [ this thing ] ( http://www.amazon.com/sumerian-ural-altaic-magyar-relationship-sumiro-hungarica/dp/0914246534 ) , claiming hungarian is related to both the altaic languages and sumerian . 
  damn , cause it takes a real special asshole to call someone a douche , right ? 
  and this guys got spelling and grammar down near perfect , not that thats a even close to reasonable thing for determining whether someone 's a asshole or not ( or for that matter smart ) . 
  on the other hand , not many people go around telling people their `` bitches '' , so maybe your the exceptional one ?

  make your self feel better ? 
  or what ? 
  its not a hard habit to break , and you know its bad . 
  sound point , but spiciness usually does n't have permanent consequences, 
  well , but whats the point ? 
  even if you dont act this way in real life ( whichs possible , although being toxics a hard habit to get out of ) , why go around offending people online ? 
  theres got to be a reason you comment , and its probably better served by acting nice . 
  you said you generalize attitude from single comments ; if you care about figuring people out , thats one thing you can actually get better at , by not using methods like that . 
  but nobody ever argues that , and if they do , they get downvoted, 
  urr what terrible phrasing , though . 
  `` 1000 years more advanced than ... '' you do n't measure `` technological advancement '' in years !, 
  ( warning : two paragraphs of sleep-deprived nonsense ; tl ; dr , eu4 was n't built to handle this timescale anyway , so et would have to try a lot harder to be reductionist than eu4 allows to accurately simulate history ), 
  the level of reductionism in eu4 is only a good fit for its scale of a few centuries in one era . 
  in order to accurately model history on a larger scale , you 'd need to be a lot more reductionist than that , adding in/reducing a lot of mechanics so that you can have new cultures , new religions , migrations , different sorts of non-states/pseudo-states ( other than hordes ) , etc. 
  i once wrote about an [ `` ideas system '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/2lpe5o/mod_idea_a_more_reductionist_approach_to_culture/ ) that would go a ways towards that , but it would be work-intensive , would n't fix the problem completely , and would n't really be for eu4 . 
  but eu4 is n't for long-term history , either -- it assumes colonization is the same for everyone , it assumes new cultures never emerge , it assumes conquering large amounts of land is similarly problematic for everyone , it assumes everyone has a capital and lives a sedentary life , it assumes every government is basically the same , and every war is basically the same . 
  that 's * alright * ... but you have to restrict your scope , and shore up the inconsistencies with real life with events , like the numerous flavor events in vanilla eu4 , or the roman event in et . 
  and et is going to be even worse at real history than eu4 , because of much larger scope while retaining most of the same mechanics . 
  to counteract this they can add in more events and more mechanics ( my favorite is their mongol one ) , but it 'll feel less reductionist , because it * is . 
  * but what can you do , when your game was built to model the early modern era ? 
  * you * ruined it , would n't have looked at the link otherwise,

  and also completely surrounding nagorno-karabakh ? 
  have you been to either nakhchivan or nk ? 
  by nk i mean nagorno-karabakh !, 
  i asked about the two because they 're both very strange border situations . 
  in the case of nakhchivan , it 's rare to have a large part of your country away from the heartland like that , and in the case of nagorno-karabakh , it 's rare to have part of your country be mostly independent , and declare itself an independent country . 
  in cyprus , where the north part is independent from the south part , there is a border , with guards and fences , and it 's difficult to get across .
