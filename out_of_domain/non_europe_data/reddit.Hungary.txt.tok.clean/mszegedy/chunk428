  is it like that in azerbaijan ? 
  if you go around looking at these castles , at least in eastern europe , they 'll * all * strike you like that . 
  each lord/king/whatever had extravagant tastes , but they were all similar in their extravagance . 
  ( on the other hand , you occasionally find cool unique stuff ; e.g. 
  when i went to betliar , i was surprised by the amount of arab tapestries and artifacts they had . 
  the last thing you 'd expect to find in the personal gallery of a hungarian lord is a bunch of flowery arabic calligraphy , right ? ), 
  it might just be dependent on how you 're feeling at the moment . 
  maybe if you go live somewhere cluttered for a while , you 'll come back and look at this and like it for its roominess and elegance !, 
  introducing , the new car ... ... ... ... ... ,, 
  i 've seen maybe two or three threads where the argument was brought up , but in all of them , the vast majority of people claimed that [ g\u026af ] is the right pronunciation , and any arguments to the contrary are stupid . 
  meh , people use hre all the time as an example of historical border-gore . 
  i 'd like to see new examples , e.g. 
  burgundy , hungary during the ottoman occupation , han during the early warring states period , and such . 
  sure , but what 's the point of mocking them if there 's not that many of them ? 
  no man you 're blowing it out of hand !, 
  it was a passing remark about a bingo card , darn it . 
  neither of us really care about it that much , so you should n't get worked up over it . 
  sorry if i came across as confrontational ; i was just saying . 
  itt : expected condemnation of hitting an easy target . 
  found eu4 jokes instead . 
  / r/worldnews , for once you 're not terrible !, 
  good point , but :, 
  - betliar is in ko\u0161ice , slovakia ; that [ was n't even conquered by the ottomans ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/central_europe_1572.png ), 
  - the andr\u00e1ssy family who owned the castle only rose to prominence in the late 1600s , right after the occupation ended , and iirc they collected most of their most exotic stuff in the 1800s , a la several other noble families across europe during that period, 
  - hungarians destroyed most of their stuff that was from the ottomans after the occupation ended , and maintain a healthy revile of the occupation to this day ; what survives of the ottoman influence on hungarian culture is a large number of words in hungarian , and a large number of baths in hungary, 
  what i found surprising about it was that a hungarian , stereotypically a devout catholic with a history of muslim oppression , would willingly put up things relating to islam ( which is what the tapestries were ; iirc they were mostly quotes from the quran , or something ) in their home . 
  i guess it did n't matter to them as much that it was muslim as that it was exotic and foreign . 
  they had stuff from other continents , too , like ... a taxidermied elephant or something , ca n't remember . 
  where is this ? 
  went to transylvania two summers ago , stayed in 3 star hotel in cs\u00edkszereda ( miercurea ciuc ) . 
  it was nothing like this , but the staff were certainly friendly . 
  in hungarian he is named `` f\u00fcles '' ( the '' \u00fc '' makes the sound `` y '' makes in danish , and the `` s '' makes the sound `` sh '' makes in english ) , which means `` the one with ears '' . 
  most of the other characters were just named after the animal they are , except :, 
  - christopher robin became r\u00f3bert gida ( `` robert faun '' ; in hungarian , the surname normally comes first , so it is unclear how his name is supposed to be structured ), 
  - piglet became malacka ( `` piggy '' ; the letter `` a '' sounds like any of the sounds `` o '' makes in danish , and the letter `` c '' sounds like `` ts '' ), 
  - kanga just remained `` kanga '' ( but pronounced hungarianly ), 
  - roo became `` zsebibaba '' ( `` pocket baby '' ; `` zs '' sounds like the sound `` zh '' makes in english ), 
  it should be noted that `` kangaroo '' in hungarian is `` kengur\u00fa '' ( which is what an american saying `` kangaroo '' sounds like to a hungarian ) , so the asymmetry with kanga and roo is n't * that * bad . 
  edit : i 'm a dumbass , i forgot winnie himself . 
  he 's called micimack\u00f3 ; `` mici '' is just a name ( albeit an endearing one ) , while `` mack\u00f3 '' is a cute term for a bear . 
  kanga the mother kangaroo, 
  i can unlock all of them except the guy . 
  fuck his levels , they 're all so damn hard ... at least you can retry them infinitely . 
  should n't it be a different shade of white then ? 
  * fairly standard europe ? 
  - weak france, 
  - germany looks like vomit , but not in the usual sense, 
  - big milan, 
  - sicily instead of naples ... while aragon still exists, 
  - no spain, 
  - no poland, 
  and growing !, 
  meh small scale border gore is n't that bad . 
  the bigger an exclave is , the weirder it is . 
  i think it 's a gag, 
  true , but i was saying exclaves , not enclaves . 
  although those are even nastier . 
  why do you think so ? 
  it seems like a relatively typical way to make fun of a particularly jarring piece of dialogue, 
   to keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space , many other functions and files have been eliminated in emacs 23.4 . 
  heheheh , this is the best part . 
  i do n't think culture clash was ever done too great in dw . 
  - the aliens and the conception of the ( far ) future are already unrealistic , so it 's difficult to give them a realistic culture , and by extension make a good culture clash episode about them, 
  - the `` past earth '' episodes would make good culture clash episodes , but they often do n't reflect history ; e.g. 
  martha 's trip to shakespeare 's avon was especially unrealistic, 
  - any real juicy culture clash would be too controversial to show on screen ; e.g. 
  imagine if we ever got a companion who sincerely believes in enslaving some or all humans, 
  i 'm sad that we ca n't get a proper cc episode , but such is dw . 
   a real juicy culture clash ... like a discussion of slavery : we actually get that with the ood . 
  in two two-parters we watch humans who are absolutely ok with slavery . 
  that 's exactly what i was talking about , though . 
  you have a great opportunity to put someone really controversial in the spotlight , but then they made all the discussion seem so half-hearted . 
  rose is like , `` you 've got slaves ?! '', 
  crew member goes , `` yeah , they 're helpful , and it does n't bother them . '', 
  fin . 
  even * harry potter * had a more thorough exploration of that situation and attitude . 
  the other episodes you mentioned i have n't seen recently enough to comment on , unfortunately . 
  actually i like 3/3/6 . 
  it implies that he started off as 1/1/4 or something , but he got reelected enough times , due to corruption , to boost his stats . 
  yes !, 
  this is the most dialogue-rich update we 've had since the gigapause . 
  i am cherishing every panel of it . 
  ( also , hah , in your face , mrcheeze ! ), 
  if they 're polymerized , why do they wash off ? 
  sure . 
  this one is n't even hard , it 's just a pattern-matching algorithm that op played right into the hands of . 
  it looks for the word `` bot '' in your sentence , and replies with that `` lost me '' line . 
  it also looks for the word `` fake '' in your sentence , and replies with that other line . 
  it also looks for `` real person '' or something ... you see ? 
  it 's not too hard . 
  we had these [ back in the 60s . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eliza ) chapter 1 of an ai textbook . 
  ( if you want to read more about how to write one , you can read [ this ancient textbook ] ( http://norvig.com/paip.html ) by peter norvig , ~ ~ who wrote the first ever eliza . ~ ~ no he did n't , what am i talking about . 
  he 's still a big name in ai though . ), 
  edit : i should mention , a really easy way to test if the bot you 're talking to is an eliza or not is to reply with the same thing multiple times . 
  if you get a repeat , it 's almost for certain one ( although if there 's nothing scripted for your response , they usually do what 's called `` punting '' , and grab a random response from a bag ; the bag 's usually pretty small though ) . 
  i know fuckall about ruling anything . 
  i might be decent at managing an army though . 
  i 'd probably make diplomatic blunders often . 
  my country 'd get a luck bonus from me knowing history , though .
