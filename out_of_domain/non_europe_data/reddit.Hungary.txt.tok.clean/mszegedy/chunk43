  also , your refusal to draw his feet reminds me of [ rob liefield ] ( http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/robliefeld.html ) , heh !, 
  check out number 38 . 
  ( not that i think you 're a bad artist !, 
  just , you are another person who found drawing feet hard . 
  trivia : it took me two hours and eleven minutes to find this link . ), 
  i want nothing to formally do with the field of linguistics . 
  lots to organize and research , but it has to stop somewhere , right ? 
  and the pay is n't too good , either . 
  my mother , on the other hand , is/was indeed a linguist . 
  she did practical applications : esl , speech therapy , that kind of stuff . 
  this is the reason my house is full of textbooks on linguistics written by chomsky and russian and german and greek written by well-meaning companies who assume ( correctly ? ), 
  that the average person does n't know ipa and make it frustrating for me to learn the actual pronunciation on my own . 
  ... for me to read . 
  bluh . 
  anyway , case is an example of a grammatical category . 
  these are each a series of names describing different forms of different facets of a language . 
  cases describe the role of a noun . 
  tenses describe the time of a verb . 
  number describes the amount of things a word refers to . 
  aspect describes the particular fabric of time of a verb . 
  mood describes ... you know what , i still ca n't come up with a satisfying explanation . 
  the point is , though , the more complex the grammar of a language is , the more grammatical categories you need to describe it . 
  actually , that 's a pretty good measure of the complexity of a language . 
  the ones i listed , are pretty standard and exist in pretty much every language ( hungarian does n't actually really have aspect , though ) , and it 's really only a matter of which ones ( english has two cases for nouns , and three for pronouns ; it has three tenses , and at least three aspects ; it has two numbers ; it has two voices , but one is periphrastic in its conjugation ; it has just over two moods , because the subjunctive barely counts and the interrogative is n't considered one in this case ) . 
  beyond those , however , there are more exotic and obscure ones . 
  wikipedia lists a handful . 
  evidentiality , for example , is a common one : how do you know how an action took place ? 
  imagine having to append a verb ending for each one : `` i know that , '' `` i saw that , '' `` i heard that , '' `` i felt that , '' `` it is said that , '' `` i believe that , '' it really goes on as far as the language takes it . 
  animacy is also popular , and in fact * not * present in english : we have `` he , she , it '' , which could theoretically be used to describe animacy , with `` it '' referring to objects that do not move whatsoever ... however , we ruin this by using `` it '' on most of our animals , and for good reason ( there are no good alternatives available in the language ) . 
  one that is very rare and is considered inappropriate to add to a constructed language because it 's obviously because you want it to be so damn exotic is associativity , which , when added onto a noun , denotes not only the noun itself , but also a group of people associated with that noun . 
  this is used almost exclusively only on people . 
  for example , when i say `` nagymama '' in hungarian , i am to mean my grandmother and her only . 
  however , `` nagymam\u00e1 *** \u00e9k *** '' refers to not only her , but my grandfather as well , and anyone else living in their household ( which used to be my aunt , but now it refers only to a single songbird and a chipmunk ) . 
  it does get awkward to use , though , for omitting another person , so i just wind up saying `` nagymam\u00e1\u00e9k meg nagyap\u00e1\u00e9k '' ( that is , `` grandmother and co. and grandfather and co. '' ) in order to compensate . 
  you can see why it 's not very popular !, 
  the more insignificant these categories get , the less likely they are to be formally called such . 
  most categories only have a single member ( like this one !, 
  ) , and it 's just called a `` feature '' of the language or something , a particular thing that this sort of noun can do . 
  but in reality , it 's an entire category with infinite potential !, 
  what if i were to invent a language with a form of associativity that refers only to females ? 
  or people with beards ? 
  or tattoos ? 
  or tattoos of beards ? 
  or scars on their left scrotum ? 
  anything can be expanded upon this way !, 
  however , it 's only the * useful * ones that are kept . 
  * that 's * why nearly all languages have that particular list of categories i told you about further up . 
  * those * are the ones they found useful !, 
  ( except noun class ; i have no idea why anyone bothers with those . 
  and imagine verb class , like in all of the languages you know . 
  \\* shudder * that 's why people complain about `` irregular '' verbs in english ; they 're all part of the verb class known as `` strong verbs '' , which you must be totes familiar with by now . ), 
  who needs fifteen kinds of associativity when it 's much more useful to have another aspect ? 
  i think you 'd like japanese . 
  i studied it for a year or two , but never made much headway . 
  the only thing i took with me was the alphabet , which you 'll have a lot of * fun * memorizing . 
  there is no inflection at all that i remember , but the * vocabulary * is so damn interesting . 
  and i mean the vocabulary that is tied to grammar . 
  like , there are three kinds of cardinal numbers , all for counting different things . 
  i 'll be damned if i can remember what , though . 
  and why do they have to have so many pronouns ? 
  because pronouns are awesome . 
  you can convey more nuance in a pronoun in japanese than you could do in a sentence in english . 
  i heartily reccommend it !, 
  me , i prefer bales upon bales of inflection . 
  a fully conjugates english verb could fill a couple sticky notes , if you write smallish . 
  a latin verb , a page or two . 
  an arabic verb ? 
  it can conjugate something like 1.7 million different ways !, 
  and i want to learn every last one of them . 
  that 's the kind of thing that i find fascinating . 
  you ? 
  who knows !, 
  go and see !, 
  you 've tried your hand at synthetic languages , and you speak an analytical one . 
  you 've seen subject-first languages , now go and try topic-first ones !, 
  there 's just so many things you can learn about it 's hardly a risible subject . 
  what entices you more , the complex mechanics of disassembling a verb to make room for a new mood , or the novelty of making mental distinctions between things that you previously never even thought to categorize ? 
  find out !, 
  ( i must make the disclaimer , however , that i have never read a single word of chomsky except as a sleeping aid . ), 
  in retrospect : nope, 
  it 's the present active participle with an elided / g / . 
  pretty motherfuckin ' standard if you ask me . 
  at least < \u0394  is pronounced / d / , like a reasonable orthography . 
  edit : no wait it substitutes < a  . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrgh \\* bangs head into sharp edge repeatedly *, 
  man , i 'd feel lucky to see these at * all * . 
  it still must have been wonderful to behold , however many degrees below melting point your toes were !, 
  \\  sees latest homestuck update, 
  \\  thinks , `` i 've got ta make porn of this right now . '', 
  just half ? 
  uh , it 's already a null session . 
  void sessions are null sessions . 
  i assumed it was too obvious to talk about . 
  this does n't contradict anything you 've said , but do notice `` lomax '' in there . 
  ( i 'm going to write an actual answer soon , but just wanted to let you know : it 's not 1.7 million ; my memory screwed up . 
  i checked the source i was using for that , and it states it to be a mere 150,000 . 
  wikipedia , which , despite * not * being the teacher of a reputed and very well-meaning arabic course who is kind enough to compose an email every two weeks or so , i trust more , puts the figure at 1,632 . 
  so , i dunno for that one . 
  the language that i 've composed that has the most verb inflection lets verbs conjugate 127,370,880 ways ; 1,528,450,560 if you count * simple * time travel tenses . 
  it would be hard to speak , though , and i doubt any existing language has even close to that many ways of inflection . ),
