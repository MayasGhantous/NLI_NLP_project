  i 've always found it somewhat ironic, 
  but what causes this ? 
  i frequent other small subs and i never have this issue there . 
  but it implies that what you are replying to can be a negation of the previous comment , so your mental picture of the previous comment is `` not - [ whatever was written ] '' , in this case `` not - ( not-not-not-satisfying ) '' , which is four levels of negation . 
  the reason you would n't count it is that `` though '' 's meaning is difficult to pin down , and that the 4-negative statement is n't what the comment itself is saying , rather what it 's saying the comment before it is . 
  is n't it 16 ? 
  it depends on if a pair of twins is 2 or 4 people .

  is there any equivalent to slashdot today ? 
  i mean , i guess slashdot , but a website that is n't * extremely ancient * and has a larger user base .

  [ you 're going to have a hard time with this list then . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english-based_creole_languages ) although some of these are basically just code-switching between some other language and english , like taglish . 
  some particular languages i suggest you check out :, 
  - [ tok pisin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tok_pisin_language ) ( papuan pidgin that extends english grammar beautifully ), 
  - [ hawaiian pidgin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hawaiian_creole ) ( the `` original '' pidgin ), 
  - [ sranan tongo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sranan_tongo ) ( not mutually intelligible with english ), 
  - [ gullah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gullah_language ) ( a comparatively very old pidgin , dating back to the us 's first slaves , now almost extinct ), 
  - [ jamaican patois ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jamaican_patois ) ( 3.2 million speakers and very similar to english ), 
  - [ singlish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singlish ) ( english dun got modal particle meh ? ), 
  also check out this [ translation exercise ] ( http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/problems2014/n2014-g.pdf ) for cameroon pidgin english . 
  still think creoles sound like parodies ? 
  edit : actually from the same problem set there 's [ another exercise ] ( http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/problems2014/n2014-p.pdf ) involving tok pisin , but you need to know [ combinatory categorial grammar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combinatory_categorial_grammar ) notation for the second part . 
  you can still do the matching and translation though for the first part .

  yup !, 
  might be my family . 
  mathematicians ? 
  well , what language do you think jar jar spoke ? 
   certainly not standard american english . 
  yes , but assembly is just an orthographical convention away from 0s and 1s . 
  sometimes people program in bytecode ( not that much , anymore ) , and that 's probably the closest you get to actually using 0s and 1s ( between which and bytecode it 's dead easy to convert ) . 
  what 's wrong with jokes and making fun of his code ? 
  it 's in good spirit, 
  bah if you 're going to tokpisin then do it with pride !, 
  no cp ` ing from wikipedia for you !, 
  that 's true , i forgot about those . 
  you could do the preprocessing by hand , though .

  first `` them '' , then `` him/her '' ? 
  check your back , is it bloody ? 
  that , that is how you draw a table 's worth of food . 
  it 's not colored/shaded , but i love the layout, 
  graffiti-ing with a stencil ? 
  :\\ i do n't blame them if they do n't have art skills , but this would make a pretty cool graffiti piece if it were done wildstyle . 
  that 's because the photos were taken with a turnip , and the picture was made from screenshots of their thumbnails,

  is marijuana really expensive , or just really light ? 
  i guess every other kind of dried herb i know is really light , but damn . 
  thank you to the kurdish people in general for everything you are doing for the levant , and i wish you safety and luck . 
  btw , you called the area where you live `` kurdistan '' . 
  just curious , how is getting a country going these days ? 
  i 'm extremely impressed right now , i never knew that was a phrase in english . 
  `` soldiers '' is a breakfast or brunch dish we make out of toast in hungary , usually for kids . 
  since the british version ( which appears to be almost totally different ) was already explained to you , for fun i 'll tell you the hungarian version . 
  they are essentially miniature open-faced sandwiches . 
  you take small pieces of bread -- best when they 're cross-sections of a [ kifli ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kifli&amp;tbm=isch ) , so that the crust goes all the way around the edge -- and smear butter on it and put slices of whatever random deli stuff you happen to have on you on top , which will usually be some form of [ kolb\u00e1sz ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kolb%c3%a1sz&amp;tbm=isch ) , some cheese , maybe one kind of ham or another , and/or smoked fish . 
  you might also put some sort of lighter topping on top , like cucumbers , typically pickled one way or another ( we have many kinds of pickles ) , or boiled egg ( ai n't nobody got time for that , though , usually ) . 
  then , if you like , you spear the whole thing through with a toothpick , and eat it in one bite . 
  it might seem like a lot of work for a bite , but you can prepare a lot quickly , and it makes the * best * stoner food , assuming you actually have deli in your refrigerator . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=katon%c3%a1k+%c3%a9tel&amp;tbm=isch ) a google image search that should turn up examples of it , but since the query is just `` soldiers food '' , it 'll turn up mostly bullshit ( i.e. , soldiers and food , not soldiers * the * food ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://mindmegette.hu/lapokkepek/cikkek/114000/114376_05.jpg ) a good example , [ here 's ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lsnw7zpwuj4/utblgrtckhi/aaaaaaaaf2a/drwi9njpz0u/s1600/katona+ezred.jpg ) another one . 
  ( you can see the difference between one that uses kifli and one that uses bread . ), 
  as you can see by some of the other results , the term really just refers to anything that you can stick a toothpick through , which is why the words `` usually '' and `` typically '' featured so heavily in my post . 
  edit : put an end to [ unrealistic beauty standards ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/kifli.jpg ) for kifli !, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.naposmezopekseg.hu/upload/kifli.jpg ) is what natural kifli looks like !,

  \\  implying a console peasant can find the psu switch, 
  it was a tongue-in-cheek suggestion , but i am glad you could contribute the tactical knowledge towards the war against the peasants . 
  it 's about using `` let 's make it an option '' as a way of solving the problem of not being able to decide what to put , as opposed to when the users actually ask for the option . 
  there 's no reason to make the aerodynamics model an option in ksp , yet . 
  i was showing it to my younger sister who has n't seen many english movies , and she recognized that that guy was played by the same guy who played some guy in glee , based entirely on the voice . 
  i was very impressed .
