  or it could have `` just '' been genetically modified . 
  but if that were the case , this would probably be a lot more common, 
  [ if you 're thinking of j like in germanic ( minus english , cough cough ) , slavic , or uralic languages , then it 's very hard but not impossible ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trill_consonant ) ( third long paragraph , starting with `` the cells in the ipa chart ... '' ), 
  it 's easier for synthetic languages like russian though where you can mix up the word order . 
  it might have been your lack of vocabulary knowledge preventing you from translating well . 
  ( unless you knew decent amounts of vocabulary too . ), 
  what was being a missionary in russia like ? 
  are you treated well there ? 
  i once translated hungarian songs to english and czech songs to hungarian . 
  the english translations were hard and often came out unsatisfactory , because :, 
  - the words had to go a certain way, 
  - english lacks many filler words , and for that matter , brief synonyms , owing to its smaller phonology, 
  - some syllables ca n't be long notes because they 're schwas ( this same problem is in german , where it 's a lot worse because many clauses must end with it ; you 're better off writing the song around it ), 
  the hungarian translations were a lot easier , because :, 
  - hungarian word order is nearly free if you do n't care about topic-comment structure ( a big `` nearly '' , though ; while word order does vary highly in day-to-day speech , it 's still much less mixed up than you 'd find in , say , latin poetry ), 
  - hungarian has many single-syllable modal particles and useless agglutinating affixes you can insert to ever so slightly but frequently not importantly alter the meaning , which can pad out your syllable count for a line, 
  - there are n't any hungarian vowels that sound weird when long, 
  the best is translating between structurally similar languages . 
  the biggest problem i had when translating songs from hungarian to tagalog , for example , was that tagalog , having a smaller phonology , would typically have longer words ( nem/nincs and hindi/wala , you are the banes of my existence ; my only consolation is `` nem volt '' is the same number of syllables as `` wala '' ) . 
  ( disclaimer : this makes it sound like i know a lot of languages . 
  i actually only know about 3.5-5 , i.e. 
  hungarian , english , tagalog , maybe german , and possibly latin . 
  i am perfectly fluent in none of them . 
  for translating the czech songs , for example , instead of actually learning the language , i pieced together a gloss of the czech using dictionaries and a grammar book . ), 
  i dunno , have you got the straight of gibraltar ? 
  is syncing to the cloud turned on for the game in steam ? 
  it 's got to be , for ironman . 
  at a guess , was english hard to pronounce because it does n't have many vowels in common with other languages , and they 're all wrapped up in diphthongs ? 
  that 's been my greatest difficulty . 
  hungarian does n't have more phonemes than english ( as far as i know ; i have n't actually counted ) , but most english phonemes ca n't occur in every place . 
  the consonants already have a bunch of allophones , like [ t ] , [ \u027e ] , and [ t\u02b0 ] , [ \u03b8 ] and [ \u00f0 ] , [ n ] and [ \u014b ] , etc. 
  but what really destroys the flexibility of english phonology are the vowels . 
  certain vowels appear [ almost exclusively in unstressed positions  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stress_and_vowel_reduction_in_english ) it 's kind of like [ how vowels work in russian , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_reduction_in_russian ) but more complicated . 
  there 's about 12 full vowels in english ( accounting for length distinction ; in hungarian , accounting for length distinction , there 's 14 , and without accounting for it , there 's 9 ) , from which the smaller numbers of reduced vowels found in unstressed syllables are derived . 
  hungarian , meanwhile , allows its phonemes to be lined up in pretty much any order as long as you do n't have too many consonants in a row . 
  the amount of possibilities is reduced a little by vowel harmony and common affixes , but the same can be said for any grammar . 
  word roots can be anything . 
  oh it is in no way worse than english , it 's a really easy language if anything , being agglutinative and all . 
  most of the words are unrecognizable to an english speaker despite probably sharing a common etymology somewhere down the line ( while hungarian is uralic , it is mostly loanwords ) , but why do you expect lexical similarity , you spoiled brat ? 
  few languages are harder than english imo , at least phonology-wise . 
  besides really obscure languages with odd phonologies like ubykh and nux\u00e1lk , and tonal languages like the sinitic and austroasiatic languages that are hard for non-tonal language-speakers to learn , english has one of the weirdest/most difficult phonologies i 've seen . 
  ( southeastern click languages might make top spot , but maybe not . 
  clicks and ejectives are n't so bad once you get used to them . ), 
  the orthography 's probably not as weird as danish orthography , though . 
  [ just look at it !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_phonology#orthographic_version ), 
   `` since intrinsically disordered proteins are very promiscuous binders that are commonly phosphorylated , this mechanism could be widespread . '', 
  interesting . 
  i know about the promiscuous binding ( natively unstructured regions act kind of the fly in fly fishing , sort of grabbing anything in reach with their weird unfolded tentacles ) , but i have n't heard about their proteins getting phosphorylated . 
  what does it do ? 
  angle the unfolded region ? 
  extend it ? 
  or does the phosphorylation happen to the unfolded region itself ? 
  it looks like in this case it did , but this one 's special . 
   then again hydrogens are traditionally black, 
  you misspelled `` white '' !, 
  ( but seriously , where are they black ? 
  every modeling program or rl kit i 've ever used had them as little white balls ),

  on the other hand the word-for-word translations to hungarian , russian , * and * tagalog are all perfectly grammatical !, 
  great going , / u/baba _ 944 !, 
  edit : no , wait , does n't work for hungarian . 
  tl works though , and so does ru . 
  agreed . 
  okinawan is distinguished significantly from japanese in pretty much every manner : intelligibility , vocabulary , grammar , history , and even politics . 
  fun fact : in the created rastafarian dialect of english known as iyaric , you replace `` me '' with `` i '' , because they feel that putting it in the objective case erodes your sense of subjectivity . 
  iyaric also has many words derived from `` i '' , collected [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iyaric#i_words ) . 
  i can only ever do [ c\u0361\u00e7 ] rather than [ c ] . 
  it 's all our fault for being hungarian . 
  how does one do that ? 
  i imagine you could use aow 's transfer occupation mechanic and make the provinces part of the peace deal , but i do n't have aow .
