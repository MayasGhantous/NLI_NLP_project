  what facial scars ? 
  your face looks fine . 
  no , do n't worry about the nose . 
  it 's just a scratch , it 'll buff out . 
  i do n't know why the skin gets that greasy . 
  you mean yours does n't ? 
  no , you 're not italian or anything . 
  do you look italian to you ? 
  oh , um speaking of scars , there 's one on the belly and one on the ankle . 
  appendectomy and an iv respectively . 
  whatever , right ? 
  also forming bukhara adds 2, 
  edit : hmmm ... have uzbek form bukhara -  annex bukhara -  release uzbek -  have uzbek form bukhara -  etc ? 
   going commando, 
  huh . 
  we have this phrase in hungarian ( meaning the same thing , presumably ; you 're referring to not wearing underwear , right ? ) . 
  any idea on its origin ? 
  hungarian linguists however actually like to argue that hungarian is sumerian/altaic/egyptian / basque . 
  anything to avoid being related to those dirty finns . 
  even programming languages have idioms sometimes . 
  and some of them are darn stupid , from a design standpoint . 
  example : in python you have ` if ` blocks and ` else ` blocks , which are ` if ` or ` else ` tokens followed by a ` : ` token and an indented block of code . 
  if you use an ` if ` or ` else ` token almost anywhere else in your code , then you 'll get a syntax error that tells you that it expected an indented block or something . 
  however , if you have the expression ` a if x else b ` , where a , x , and b are expressions that evaluate to some value ( x better evaluate to either ` true ` or ` false ` , or else i will throw fits ) , then you have the traditional [ ternary conditional ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3f: ) , albeit in a pretty dumb order ( a is the true result , b is the false result , and x is the condition ) . 
  ( `` idiomatic programming '' has nothing to do with this , by the way . 
  that just means you use whatever constructs in your code are most appropriate considering the language . ), 
  or release them in a war, 
  [ not perpetually sounding smug ] ( / 4chan ), 
  this has forever been my headcanon involving stable timeloops in a number of works , and appears to be at least vaguely [ shared by others ] ( http://qntm.org/excellent ) . 
  however , in hs , like pretty much every work before it , there 's no actual reason to think so . 
  so bkew 's theory remains a wild supposition . 
  the worst is when they 're at max trust . 
  `` the timurids trust the ottomans utterly . '', 
  you can get them this way by 1600 easily if you focus on the missions you get to destroy the mamluks and the rest of north africa . 
  all the europe conquest was probably just a couple one-off opportunities here and there ; you should be able to do that easily at the same time as you are annihilating the middle east , considering the ottos ' massive force limit and manpower . 
  ( if you also bother invading the arabian peninsula , you can take that , too ; usually if you work hard you can vassalize and diploannex parts of it without even going to war . ), 
  if you do n't feel like you can take the next mission , remember that you can always hire fucktons of mercenaries . 
  dunno , the first two german inventions that come to mind for me are naziism and communism, 
  any decent table like this would be made using a log scale , which this post fails to consider . 
  but this one obviously is n't using even that . 
  ironically , britain was supposed to have the exact opposite reaction to germany 's naval growth . 
  these were less enlightened times . 
  there was nobody to tell the cartoonist how ridiculously stilted the dialogue sounds !, 
  as a ( n experienced ) diver i would n't find it a lot at all ... not like it proves anything , but it does n't have to be special . 
  hmm , in ~ ~ all ~ ~ ~ ~ some countries ~ ~ * only hungary * formerly of gl\u00d6rio\u00dcs habsburg sphere of influence , the word for foreigner is some variation of `` outlander '' : german `` auslander '' , hungarian `` k\u00fclf\u00f6ldi '' . 
  what are good mods that replace monarch points ? 
  as a new player , i 'd be interested in seeing alternative systems . 
  ( i also have vic 2 , but i have n't played it much , as it 's not compatible with my computer . ), 
  do you know how eu3 did it ? 
  monarch points it is , then !, 
  til leonardo dicaprio is immortal, 
   god-mode is simply a way of avoiding the ctrl and alt keys . 
  i use it along with evil-mode . 
  comparing it to evil-mode does n't make a whole lot of sense , though . 
  evil introduces , in a fairly complete way , vim 's editing language to emacs , entirely changing the way one edits text . 
  if you 're someone who is n't familiar with vim , it will probably be baffling . 
  i would encourage you to first become familiar with vim before jumping into evil-mode . 
  long-time vim/evil user here ( i found this thread while searching google for an unrelated evil-mode problem , help :( ) , god-mode and evil-mode are certainly comparable . 
  they both introduce esc as a way of switching between inserting text and using the different letter keys to perform different functions . 
  i prefer evil , since it 's probably more complete and has commands i 'm already used to , but god-mode * does * make emacs act as a sort of pseudo-vim . 
  hmm , i wonder if this was made by a black person or a white person ? 
  whoever they are , their aavl is very good . 
  i do n't really understand sumatra and borneo being separate . 
  indonesia 's been united since 1949 . 
  edit : i got that one but missed an independent transylvania ? 
  i am a terrible hungarian, 
  but they said sumatra , borneo , malaysia , * and * indonesia . 
  that 's already 4 countries . 
  i think for borneo they meant brunei , and randomly added sumatra . 
  edit : tried to make an edit , failed miserably , have the original instead, 
  shit , i thought you meant jersey like the island . 
  i thought , `` expensive ? 
  definitely . 
  sights ? 
  bahahahahahaha '', 
  [ it 's not * that * bad , you just have to watch it several times and maybe read some stuff on the internet ] ( http://qntm.org/primer ), 
  meh , i do n't hear that argument about hochdeutsch vs plattdeutsch . 
  this comment is underrated . 
  not only did you fully disclaim your thought process , but you also left the door open to annoy you with comments like the one i 'm making right now . 
  edit : no , seriously , why does everyone hate his comment ? 
  :( that 's mean, 
  but you could say that to literally any time someone discounts someone else 's opinion . 
  how else was / u/calimiket supposed to phrase his comment ? 
  granted , he could 've just said something like , `` what 's wrong with doing what you want with your body ? 
  '' , but what he said is fine , too ; he was annoyed by / u/pheorach 's attitude towards surgery , and let it show . 
  that 's not a huge crime or anything , and reducing a legitimate argument to `` feeling superior '' is super douchey . 
  ( the xkcd comic a lot of people learned to do this from at least used it on a position that does sound like someone comes up with entirely because they want to feel superior to a bunch of people at once . 
  maybe it just sounds like that to me because i disagree with it . ), 
  that 's a good point , but i do n't think / u/redacted187 took that into consideration , and he did n't need to . 
  that 's the problem with the whole thing ; it 's so general , you can use it on practically anything . 
  edit : / u/redacted187 meant it sarcastically . 
  that 's what i thought at first , but then reddit seemed to interpret it as `` rekt '' . 
  i love lots of xkcd comics and hate a lot of others , but i do n't think that one 's the worst , by far . 
  the worst ones imo are all the `` public service announcement '' comics , which , while this is one of them , can be a lot worse . 
  like [ this thing . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/1357/ ) what the hell , munroe ? 
  it 's just so tactless . 
  he does n't abstain from using the sound , though . 
  he wrote `` phonetic '', 
  if you are using additive mixing ( you should be , since you 're starting with rgb ) , that circle should be white,
