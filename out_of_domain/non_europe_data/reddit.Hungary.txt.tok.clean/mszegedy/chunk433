  alright , thank you . 
  having to explain topic-prominence is going to be a pain , though . 
  huh . 
  how do you feel about having a sultan/oil money/an exclave ? 
  some countries use periods as thousands separators ; that is * clearly * what he meant, 
  it was a joke , but you are right that -9000 would be incredible . 
  as far as i 'm aware , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u ) is reddit 's most downvoted anything , and not even that has net -9000 ( although it comes close ), 
  well , you were asking for it !, 
  how dare you be swedish ? 
  muslim countries are n't allowed in europe !, 
  it depends , sometimes you can visit friends two countries over in short amounts of time . 
  growing up near the hungarian-slovak border ( on the hungarian side ; usually i lived in miskolc , but for the summer i migrated to ^ ( ~ ~ the free , independent , and strictly neutral city of ~ ~ ) gy\u0151r ) , sometimes my parents would go grocery shopping in slovakia for that delicious kofola , taking less than an hour , and we 'd visit our relatives in brno ( in the czr ) for an evening and come back before the night was over . 
  your dad was just buying weed , though , obviously . 
   as a new zealander, 
  you can forego this introduction if you get yourself [ flair !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/wiki/flair ), 
  except the second !, 
  which is good , being surprised once in a while is fun, 
   ** stop . 
  using . 
  mercator . 
  ** should n't this be common knowledge in / r/mapporn , a subreddit literally dedicated to maps ? 
  this is a default subreddit , is n't it ? 
  you should lower your expectations . 
  i 'd take anything after as well ; that 's when we started [ magyarizing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization ) everyone . 
  ( wait fuck i forgot to act typically hungarian . 
  uh , 1920 never forget ? 
  no but seriously they should have made sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld either independent or an exclave . 
  also fuck all the ethnically hungarian land they randomly gave to slovakia ), 
  i might be thinking of / r/dataisbeautiful, 
  that 's true ; just thought i should mention since soucres tend to tell you specifically to [ beware of numbers from that period ( example linked ; seems to suggest recorded hungarian percentage is about double of reality ; your tables seem consistent though ) ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=imyrryzl9k0c&amp;lpg=pa20&amp;dq=census%201910%20hungary%20manipulated&amp;hl=sk&amp;pg=pa20#v=onepage&amp;q=hungarian%20government%20manipulated&amp;f=false ), 
  i 'm kind of disappointed the [ kringlefucker ] ( / dunkass ) did n't just get straight resized ; that 's the most obvious way to make shitty jpegs even shittier . 
  thought : hussie has n't parodied montage videos yet . 
  he should get on it, 
  eh , not noteworthy unless he also explains each mech of action / s, 
  edit : do chemists not understand what / s means ? 
  in czech , you can get phrases like `` ze lvova '' , meaning `` from lviv '' , which people seem to segment more as [ \u02c8z\u025bl.vo.va ] rather than [ z\u025b \u02c8lvo.va ] . 
   i think something more likely to happen if china and the us were to merge would be the development of pidgins in areas with more chinese influence . 
  we 've got singlish at least , which is heavily influenced by chinese grammar . 
  i can just hear this set to the tune of cyriak 's `` cycles '', 
  that started long ago, 
  * we got singlish meh ? 
  itt for me :, 
  but that 's just verb conjugation . 
  there is still a clearly identifiable subject . 
  i 'd think the concept of subject is less applicable to topic-prominent languages like japanese and austronesian languages . 
  yeah , thanks !, 
  i 've already installed one just now , but i guess i 'll have to restart my beloved computer to get them to display . 
  no way , i refuse to concede any necessities for a conlang !, 
  but i usually like it if my conlang can fill out a [ swadesh list ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:swadesh_lists_for_germanic_languages ) . 
  in hungarian , we have the two beautiful sentences :, 
  - ** te ** means you, 
  - ** tenni ** means to do or put , with root ** te - **, 
  - ** - t ** is our past tense marker , and also our perfect passive participle marker ; after e it becomes ** - tt **, 
  - ** - t ** is also our accusative marker . 
  when the noun ends in a consonant , a vowel is inserted between it and the - t , making it ** - ot / - et / - \u00f6t **, 
  - ** - k ** is our pluralizing marker , which works exactly like '' - t '' but goes before it ( e.g. 
  `` t\u00e9l '' means `` winter '' , and `` teleket '' means `` winters '' in the accusative case ), 
  - ** - tat / - tet ** , depending on vowel harmony , is an affix you can add to verbs to mean that one is making somebody do the action of the verb ( becoming ** - ttet ** after e ) ; e.g. , `` csin\u00e1l '' means `` he/she/it does/makes '' , and `` csin\u00e1ltat '' means `` he/she/it has someone do/make '' . 
  the compound with `` tenni '' , `` tettetni '' , means something special : it means `` to pretend '' . 
  - ** e ** is a short way of saying `` this '' , as an adjective, 
  - ** - as / - es / - \u00f6s ** makes an adjective out of a noun , and is our most common affix onto anything . 
  combined with `` tenni '' and the '' - tt '' perfect passive participle marker , this makes `` tettes '' , `` culprit '' , literally `` one who has a thing that has been done ( deed ) '' . 
  - ** - ( j ) a / - ( j ) e ** indicates that something is possessed by a third-person thing ; so `` tej '' means milk , and `` teje '' means his/her/its milk, 
  thus , literally word-for-word :, 
  you do-pst-2sg . def this do-caus-ppp do-ppp-acc , you !, 
  you did this pretended deed , you !, 
  you do-caus-ppp do-ppp-pl do-ppp-pl-having-poss .3 sg , you !, 
  you culprit of pretended deeds , you !, 
  meh , it was useless pedantry . 
  of course you would n't think * every * conlang is * required * to have them ; you 're not dumb !, 
  sorry for bringing it up . 
  meh the hungarian provinces are all shitty , except buda and szepes . 
  he should be fine . 
  i guess because it does n't give ia anymore, 
  for some reason a ton of different provinces can defect to them , even cyprus . 
  i guess it 's all the ones with greek culture . 
  i once released them as ottomans , though , so that i could go orthomans , and it was n't that bad . 
  it looks like enlightenment, 
  thanks for the offer , but it works !, 
  it 's gorgeous !, 
  new flair time !, 
   just like all the other countries in the ` chinese characters sphere ', 
  wait , how many of these are there ? 
  japan 's the only country i know of that adopted chinese characters for a completely different language , in addition to china itself i guess ( taiwan and singapore use chinese characters , but they 're for mandarin and hokkien ) . 
  korean script was inspired by chinese and so maybe counts , but that 's the extent of my knowledge . 
  mongolian is written using its own script ( or cyrillic ) , indochina uses either its own scripts or latin , and so does everything to the east . 
  meanwhile , everyone west of china uses cyrillic , except for the indian region , who also do n't use chinese characters . 
  romanian , too ? 
  hey , we have another thing in common !, 
  are they all slavic and turkish ? 
  and you 're not even using et !, 
  wtf ? 
  edit : everybody 's catholic , though, 
  i currently have work , but i have identified the browser as [ flock , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flock_%28web_browser%29 ) which is associated with enlightenment . 
  edit : nvm , it 's not . 
  i need to see what icon set uses those icons . 
  minor , irrelevant note : i was n't doubting that they had loanwords , i was just wondering how big actually is the chinese characters sphere , if it 's already referred to as such . 
  huh . 
  do latinate etymons count as loans ?
