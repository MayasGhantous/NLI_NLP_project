  or are those considered the basis ? 
  ( apparently constituting 30 % ... 
  i ca n't tell if that 's better or worse than our 20 % uralic + 30 % unknown ), 
  no , why is playing left field, 
  well , my post is no pretended deed ... 
   the fact that his fade is fresh as fuck, 
  it also alliterates, 
  so far i ca n't get it working , but that 's never stopped an emacs user !, 
  wiring up the pi as a server is n't a bad idea , though , i 've been meaning to do it to mine . 
  the only problem 's if you do n't have internet , then you ca n't ssh in . 
  i want to be able to edit offline , too !, 
  the root of it all , though , is the lack of an editor for keyboardless android as excellent as emacs . 
  there 's the emacs port , but it could be made far more convenient and native for a touch screen . 
  i wonder if there 's a swype version of hacker keyboard ; that would already go a ways . 
  huh , it 's kind of like lecs\u00f3 but with meat, 
  they 're all very popular shows/series/whatever , the problem is that still means most people have n't heard of them, 
  what 's the point though ? 
  if you can carpet siege them once , then you can carpet siege them a second time after you 've taken provinces from them . 
  in gl\u00f6rio\u00fcs hungarian we say '' \u00f3vszer '' , a combination of '' \u00f3v '' ( watch out ) and `` szer '' ( device ) . 
  this is probably because in the late 1800s , our politicians decided we had too many loanwords , and so replaced a bunch of them with stuff they thought up . 
  modern hungarian , though , is still at least 50 % loanwords ( 30 % of our words are of unknown etymology , so we do n't really know ) . 
  it 's slightly mitigated by the fact that the `` son '' is pronounced differently in names than in the word, 
  meh , losing power ( and therefore water ) for a week still sucks . 
  i feel your pain . 
  in hungarian , the word `` mi '' means both `` we '' or `` what '' , and is pronounced the same as english `` me '' ( it should be shorter , but they 're easy to mistake ) . 
  so , growing up in a household that spoke hunglish , if someone asked you a question , and you replied `` mi ? / me ? 
  '' , then it could be ambiguously one of three things :, 
  - what do you mean ? / what did you say ? 
  - you 're talking to us ? 
  - you 're talking to me ? 
  `` what '' and `` we '' ? 
  what makes it more confusing is that they 're both nominative , ~ ~ singular , ~ ~ nope and unpossessed . 
  so , the only way to tell from the grammar itself which one is meant is that the `` what '' mi appears in interrogative sentences while the `` we '' mi appears in declarative sentences . 
  thankfully , hungarian distinguishes interrogative pronouns from relative pronouns , so it 's not * that * confusing ; relative `` what '' , like in `` you heard what i said '' , is `` ami '' . 
  most countries do !, 
  ( well , aceh for example is a quran belt , but w/e ) in hungary , our bible belt is ironically not even inside hungary . 
  it is instead located in romania , in their three provinces that are still majority hungarian , sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld . 
  that is actually where i first met a creationist who was n't retired . 
  why is cs the only field where asking for help/resources is met with `` you did n't even look for any did you '' ? 
  i 'm not even sure whether i agree or disagree with your post , or whether it 's a valid reaction or not , i 'm just curious . 
  i see this mentality so widespread literally nowhere else . 
  awesome video !, 
  for my ~ ~ ibm ~ ~ lenovo thinkpad it 's surprisingly easy . 
  you still have to remove the kb , though . 
  oops , meant to write lenovo , ty for reminding me !, 
  thinkpads are awesome , but i do n't like the sucky keyboards on the newest ones . 
  no purple enter , weird layout ... what 's become of one of the staples of the thinkpad line ? 
  you mean this bit ? 
   currently , posts like * `` i want to start programming , but i have no clue where to start . 
  '' * are appearing nearly * hourly * . 
  * all * of them have been answered before . 
  some answers are right there , in the * sidebar * , in the * faq * . 
  if one is not willing to spend even that * minimal effort * to read the faq or the sidebar , or to browse a bit on the subreddit to see if their questions have been answered already is not ready to be a programmer . 
  first , one needs to learn to * observe * , to * consciously read * , to * investigate * . 
  asking the above mentioned question already invalidates these three points . 
  they just want to have everything served to them . 
  alright , but op sounds like he has a problem with more than just sidebarred stuff , and it 's not just op anyway . 
  in multiple cs-related communities , it goes for me something like :, 
  have problem/task, 
  look up related documentation online , e.g. 
  a tutorial or wiki , fail to find solution, 
  ask online community , `` hey i need help with [ problem/task ] '', 
  get the reply , `` have you read the fucking [ tutorial/wiki/docs ] ? 
  stop using this [ software/framework ] n00b '', 
  thankfully i 'm not one to be easily intimidated by that kind of stuff , but i think it sets a poor mold for dealing with people asking for help . 
  sometimes people * do * want to outsource the work of looking for tutorials and things to other people on the internet , and in that case just let somebody nice enough to come up with something answer . 
  * yes , * i 've been trying to start `` what nice thing have you done ? '', 
  threads forever now , but reddit 's always too damn cynical to blow them up !, 
  great thinking !, 
  of course bribing everyone would work ... :p, 
  eh i 've done some stuff but none of it 's too out of ordinary , it 's pretty much what you 'd expect from anyone who 's nice . 
  highlights :, 
  - acted as a sort of therapist and suicide hotline for a couple friends ; confidentiality prevents me from spilling the details , but for at least two of them a part of it was that meds were screwing with their heads . 
  there 's also a cousin of mine who was neglected growing up and is now mentally stunted who i 'd like to help , but i ca n't figure out what to do yet, 
  - filling in for many of my teachers in high school ( especially math , orchestra , and latin ) ; it was a lot more fun then than being a molec bio ta is now , and that 's my favorite field !, 
  - speaking of teaching , doing a lot of free tutoring inside and outside of school through the ages . 
  information wants to be freeeeeee ... \\* rubs stallman beard \\*, 
  - finally producing and distributing at least one helpful open-source application !, 
  i mean , it 's a command-line tool for learning vocab from sections of the aeneid , so it 's kind of niche , but i 'm happy anybody uses it , since i put a lot of love into it . 
  this was back in hs though , so it 's ancient history . 
  funnily enough , though , perl has n't changed enough since then to render it obsolete, 
  hopefully , in the next few years i 'll really make an original contribution to the field of protein engineering , which 'll be a lot more gild-worthy than any of these . 
  bonus list of things i 've done that people have actually found worthy of gilding before :, 
  - explained a really obvious joke ( or something ... never really understood why i got gilded ), 
  - went through a user 's history to figure out why i had upvoted them so much , briefly tried to relate to the subject of one of their failed posts, 
  - encouraged / r/videos to recognize both the good and bad things muslims do ( they 're surprisingly nice people , considering the racism you often see there ), 
  - introduced a guy to creole languages, 
  i once looked at it and i think it was just another generic racist sub , a la / r/niggers ; ca n't really remember though . 
  the name 's confusing, 
  edit : looked at it again , it 's a generic racist sub but they call black people `` apes '', 
  do i even wan na know the allophony rules ? 
  that goes for many other countries , too -- say , turkey can also be considered to have a secular belt , as opposed to a quran belt . 
  ( bengal tigers do live in the nepal region ), 
  unfortunately india blobbed the fuck out in this game , so i ca n't quite conquer them yet . 
  on the other hand i 'm well on my way to forming malaya , although i do n't think i actually want to . 
  i 'm going for a reverse colonization game here ; arguably i 've already reverse colonized in a way by annexing brunei , but soon i will seize a spanish colony and start the game in earnest !, 
  sounds more like a job for an update !, 
  but \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438 is n't associated with neckbeards , that 's why he made the post, 
  jesus fuck look at that tangle . 
  i would definitely not like being the one to unbox it , so to speak .
