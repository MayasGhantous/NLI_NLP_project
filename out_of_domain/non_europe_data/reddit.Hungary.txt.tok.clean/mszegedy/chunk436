  is n't norway in russia ? 
  these are wonderful , thank you !, 
  i was looking more for particular plugins , though . 
  \\  mfw western tech and only one miltech behind france, 
  \\  mfw have plenty of money for additional troops, 
  \\  mfw have 30k troops anyway, 
  it would 've worked , i tell you !, 
  anyway , i tried going to war with spain over something else ( the bastards were colonizing belitung ; get away from my tin , you crotch-grooming pig-lickers !, 
  ) , and it did n't go well . 
  austria invaded my newly-acquired cores in algeria , portugal invaded my colonies in the caribbean , and spain managed to land 25k troops on belitung itself , protected by its insane 14 carracks and bunch of galleys . 
  naval superiority is n't something i have , unfortunately . 
  so , instead , i let spain core that one colony , and colonized everything else in sea asia . 
  it turned out i already have an account , from like 10 years ago, 
  tbf the earth is bigger and deeper than mars, 
  i was mostly talking about loans . 
  :p i had tens of loans available with each being over a hundred . 
  i also forgot to mention that france had just fought and lost a war against savoy ( and austria ? ), 
  and was severely de-manpowered and de-armied . 
  i 've seen france get crushed by early burgundy often ( even with me allied to france as austria ) , and that was with more land . 
  for some reason , they only produced , like , 26k troops then . 
  that sucks about the pips , though , i did n't know that . 
  how awful . 
  is there any way to get around it ? 
  i know if you 're a horde your units can change from horde to muslim , but that 's about it . 
  omg thank you, 
  - large amounts of inflection , even for analytical languages, 
  - overly large phonologies, 
  - unoriginal vocabulary ... it can be a romlang or germlang or even a hunlang but god forbid that its words be unique, 
  i see nothing wrong with this, 
  brits innovating on english for once ? 
  i wo n't have it !, 
  asian languages ?? 
  no way , there 's tons of native german speakers who look asian . 
  meanwhile i ca n't pronounce it with dark l. [ t ] alveolar , just like [ l ] . 
  you 'd think it 'd naturally allophonize . 
  well , in all seriousness , conventions like iupac 's rules are useful . 
  there was [ a paper written in guyanese creole ] ( http://www.science20.com/beachcombing_academia/linguistics_paper_written_guyanese_creole_possibly_only_one_corrected_title-125496 ) a while back . 
  also , i made / r/hydraulicsporn for other kinds of pipe , but it 's understandably less popular . 
  no ascii headers or searchable tags though ( well , maybe you could get tags by putting them in section titles ? ), 
  is there a version of this for linux ? 
  in a bilingual hungarian/english household , this was more complicated than you can ever imagine . 
  - fennel ( \u00e9desk\u00f6m\u00e9ny ; it means `` sweet caraway '' ), 
  - anise ( usually \u00e1nizs , but also called b\u00e9csik\u00f6m\u00e9ny or \u00e9desk\u00f6m\u00e9ny ; the former means `` viennese caraway '' ), 
  - star anise ( csillag\u00e1nizs ; it means `` star anise '' ; this spice became relevant when i was trying to make thai iced tea , and i mixed it up with both the following and preceding items ), 
  - cinnamon ( fah\u00e9ly , thankfully ; it means `` tree peel '' ), 
  - small plums ( k\u00f6k\u00e9ny ; only relevant when visiting romania ), 
  - dill ( kapor ; sue me , it 's similar enough ), 
  bonus : i could never tell the difference between coriander/cilantro and parsley ; while coriander is just called `` koriander '' , parsley is called `` petrezselyem '' and is much more common in hungarian cuisine than `` koriander '' . 
  thanks for the advice about tags !, 
  gamefaqs walkthroughs often contain masterful ascii art , especially for headers . 
  it 's one of my favorite things when working with . txt files -- using my total control over the file 's contents to make it aesthetically pleasing . 
  see this [ super metroid walkthrough ] ( http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/file/super_metroid_o.txt ) for some good examples, 
  that 's the [ austrians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar\u00e1nsebes ), 
  yes , they 're [ beautiful ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2mj0wd/_/ ) . 
  i do n't know how extensive your toolkit is supposed to be , but that would probably be really hard to support , so i suggest you do n't . 
  \\  letters, 
  \\  radicals, 
  no , that 's a dirty impostor lazy relex cipher ^ ( that technically predates mine by a little bit ) . 
  mine 's actually logographic . 
  but , is n't it going to be the dutch now ? 
  thanks so much !, 
  it 's really generous of you to go to all this thought . 
  i 'll be sure to implement as much of this as possible . 
  ( lt is my favorite of these ... 
  i should finish up my generative grammar tool in lisp and port it to elisp so we can have something native ), 
  are you kidding ? 
  - there 's plenty of dishes that use horsemeat, 
  - there 's plenty of dishes that use raw meat ( most relevantly steak tartare ), 
  - there 's plenty of dishes that involve sticking the food in earth one way or another , some when it 's raw or rotten ( most relevantly h\u00e1karl ), 
  how is this not food ? 
  i 've got you covered for images of the logographs ( which are actually just whatever 's inside the big thick circle inside each word ) . 
  the problem is that the thicknesses of the outer two lines , as well as some other stuff , are morphologically significant , and the rules for which parts of which words overlap which ones are complicated . 
  that 's huge though . 
  wolframalpha informs me that that 's 1/9th of the height of the burj khalifa . 
  mine looks similar , but i 'm sulu and i also own all of sea asia and most of china, 
  unfortunately nothing will beat the first one that inspired the achievement in the first place . 
  that was beautiful . 
  so far my favorite game has been as [ sulu . 
  happened to me too . 
  i took java as sulu , and i got sundanese rebels every so often . 
  they occupied a couple provinces , and i was busy in a war , so i let them sit on it for a while , and once i got 10 % warscore i immediately peaced out for concede defeat because the rebels were only a year from enforcing their demands . 
  i defeated the rebels themselves very quickly , but the four or so provinces that they took were apparently still enough to let them enforce demands . 
  and when they did , i lost the entire island of java !, 
  accepting demands did the same thing , too . 
  i was n't in ironman , thankfully , so i could retry , but it took tons and tons of mercs , a +20 % morale advisor , and an absolutely fabulous general before i could assault and take back all of the provinces in just nine months or so . 
  i thought everyone always took the same ideas in the same order ? 
  goddammit , 100 % overextension limit, 
  eh i agree with the second bit , but i do n't really understand how it connects to the first bit . 
  a while ago i [ wrote on ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/2lpe5o/mod_idea_a_more_reductionist_approach_to_culture/ ) realistic/reductionist tech systems and more , but they have nothing to do with `` geography or logistics '' . 
  well , what about the collapse of the soviet union ? 
  i was going to put it in the self text , but i forgot . 
  there was once a / r/askhistorians thread about whether their writing was on the wall , but i do n't remember a conclusive answer . 
  or , traditionally most technology is taken as inevitable , and you hear `` if x did n't invent it , someone else woulda '' a lot . 
  is that true of other things ? 
  is that even true for most technology ? 
  or just for fun , did anybody actually expect the spanish inquisition ? 
  purges of heresy seem like a fairly standard thing to do . 
  i 'm asking because in discussions of paradox games , you often see people complaining that x or y outcome is `` ahistorical '' , i.e. 
  probably would never have happened . 
  but the way that you verify whether a paradox game is `` historical '' or not obviously is n't that you check whether it comes out to modern history every time -- otherwise you 'd just script everything .
