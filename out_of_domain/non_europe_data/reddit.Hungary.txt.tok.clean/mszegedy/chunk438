  the arrogant professor smirked like a rapist and smugly replied `` it 's clearly milk , you crazy homo . 
  what the fuck does milk have to do with political science ? '', 
  `` wrong . 
  it 's an all natural vegan soy almond kombucha latte . 
  no animals or transpeople were harmed or raped in the making of this product . '', 
  the professor was visibly shaken , and dropped his chalk and copy of the wall street journal . 
  he stormed out of the room , clearly planning some kind of rape . 
  the professor realized that he had been playing into the hands of the kyriarchy of ceos , investment bankers , the religious right , and psychiatrists . 
  he then killed himself . 
  the proper term for this is `` trans-dead '' . 
  the students checked their privilege , all diagnosed themselves with autism and gender identity disorder and joined the gay-straight alliance . 
  an obese trans-eagle furry otherkin waddled into the room and tried to perch upon the american flag , bending the flagpole in the process . 
  all parties involved gave up meat , christianity , and the right to bear arms . 
   hungary, 
  welcome to the habsburg sphere of influence , where we have absolutely no creativity, 
  we are , sometimes . 
  what 's funny is that the wikipedia article is called [ burma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burma ) , even though the official name is myanmar . 
  just call it burmyanmar i guess, 
  in this case , by `` photo '' i meant something you take with your camera . 
  something photorealistic , ish . 
  but i have no idea how widely used that semantic distinction is . 
  because you ca n't have more than 255 colors , unless you want to make the filesize absurdly large compared to the png . 
  png has a global palette . 
  it 's not italy without a few enclaves, 
  it 's great to relieve stress if you do it viciously enough . 
  my poor mousepad, 
  i think i saw a mod that did this a while back, 
  this game gives a great intuition for probabilities . 
  - ** you : ** sieges rarely complete , even at high percentages, 
  - ** rebels : ** either they complete the siege early or never, 
  - ** opponents : ** they eventually complete the siege but it can take time, 
  - ** blobs : ** they barely spend any time/troops sieging , and always fight you with their whole fucking army, 
  that 's disappointing . 
  do most people not buy at&t , or do most people not get custom roms ? 
  there 's so much bloat :(, 
  it 's supposed to make you think more about robbing someone . 
  on one hand you 'll rob them , but on the other hand they 'll get random resources . 
  it also makes people stop complaining when they get hit with the robber . 
  rational protein design . 
  [ asian languages ??? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/2sov4p/esperanto_is_selfevidently_easier_to_learn_duh/cnsgxz2?context=1 ), 
  this works on literally every meme , what 's the point ? 
  it 's unclear what you mean by that distinction . 
  the plot is chance of winning the siege displayed vs experimentally determined chance of winning the siege when it says that percentage . 
  ideally it should be a straight line with a slope equal to the aspect ratio of the plot . 
  the joke is that it totally is n't . 
  for example , when you get up to high siege percentages , it seems to take many additional months before you win . 
  the fire guy knows what 's up, 
  what makes shock better than fire exactly ? 
  why does guyenne make a better vassal than france ? 
  that is what inspired this post, 
  they 're mostly digraphs, 
  i do n't get it still . 
  i thought you took the sum of your general 's pips and the troops ' pips and subtracted the sum of the enemy 's general 's pips and troops ' pips from it , and that was your advantage . 
  do the leader 's pips actually multiply the troops ' pips ? 
  or what makes such a great disparity ? 
  i can see that you do n't get fire pips on the units until tech 9-ish , but it only makes an additive difference of one or two pips . 
  welcome to the linguistic concept of `` topic '' , i hope you enjoy your stay . 
  english sadly does n't mark the topic in any way unless you curse ( `` i never fucking sucked his dick '' vs `` i never sucked his fucking dick '' ) . 
  languages that do are called `` topic-prominent '' . 
  some rad topic-prominent languages :, 
  - ** mandarin : ** uses word order to convey it, 
  - ** japanese : ** uses marking particles to convey it, 
  - ** korean : ** uses marking particles to convey it ( may be related to japanese ), 
  - ** austronesian languages in general : ** tend to use marking particles , but not exclusively ; the malay/english creole singlish , for example , uses word order , as does , iirc , malay proper, 
  - ** american sign language : ** word order [ and a marker ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_sign_language_grammar#topic_and_main_clauses ) ( may be related to japanese ... no , jk ), 
  - ** hungarian : ** word order plus one optional marker, 
  - ** siouxan languages in general : ** word order i think ? 
  as you can see it 's mostly an east asian thing , but really , there 's always room for topic-prominence !, 
  edit : i should mention , the emphasized part ( the new info ) is actually the comment , the * rest * is the topic, 
  ~ ~ sort of , but it 's not consistent . 
  generally you do n't , unless you want to . 
  topic-prominent languages mark it every time , or close to it . ~ ~, 
  bleh , what a shitty explanation . 
  you can say that you can mark it with tone , but you ca n't say english is topic-prominent ; in tp languages , differentiating the topic and comment is usually obligatory . 
  ( btw : the part that you 're marking with the emphasis is the comment , not the topic . ), 
  silence in the library, 
  you ca n't beat a good monster, 
  i think he warred castile and got them to release it . 
  same thing with france and burgundy . 
  the ai can do really good re-reconquistas occasionally though, 
  i have no idea . 
  i 'd expect the opposite , though , since your sentence is conveying * more * information rather than less . 
  to a tp language speaker , it should be obvious as day what part is the comment and what part is the topic , much more so than in english . 
  in hungary , our politicians are very untrustworthy and lie through their teeth constantly , but that 's not remarkable . 
  ah , but `` flagellum '' means `` whip '' . 
  so really you 're going for a whipped dinosaur ( which is very sad unless it 's in the sense of whipped cream ), 
  except in hungary . 
  most monolingual country in europe , yea-eaahh !, 
  dutch is one of the closest languages there is to english !, 
  ( the only closer ones are the frisian languages and scots , and all those english-based creoles out there ) they say if you know both english and german , you can understand dutch . 
  i know english and german , but the only things i understand better in dutch due to my english knowledge are french loanwords ( e.g. 
  `` gep\u00e4ck '' in german vs `` bagage '' in dutch ) . 
  ^ ^ \\ ( i ^ ^ am ^ ^ not ^ ^ a ^ ^ linguist , ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ just ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke ), 
  it 's actually turks, 
  well , there 's a lot of good episodes, 
  * exactly *, 
  it does , but english is not topic-prominent . 
  would you say english * normally * marks the topic ? 
  we can discuss many different ways of doing it -- `` it was his dick that i sucked , '' `` as for his dick , i sucked it '' , `` i sucked his * dick * , '' `` i sucked his fucking dick '' -- but they 're all ultimately atypical .
