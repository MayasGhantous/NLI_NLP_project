  all the satire subreddits are the hre . 
  so numerous , and all so irrelevant . 
  / r/circlejerk is austria , / r/braveryjerk is bavaria , and / r/circlebroke is switzerland . 
  admittedly that 's what i would have done . 
  schwa is the most frequently inserted vowel of them all by far . 
  but sometimes you just get vowel doubling ( a form of vowel harmony , i guess ; you see it in arabic ) . 
  it 's possible `` orga '' mutated to `` orgo '' over time ; you can see examples of this if you google [ `` fortition of schwa '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=fortition+of+schwa ) ( the first result deals with schwas in a word-final position so it 's exactlg what you 're looking for ) . 
  it 's probably just because the previous vowel is also `` o '' . 
  that does n't sound unreasonable though . 
  does n't contemporary understanding indicate that mid and late pie were sprachbunds of sorts ? 
  i was just kidding . 
  i am a biophysicist , not a linguist . 
  go full speed ahead with the sandhi . 
  the sfwporn network would be japan . 
  eeugh . 
  there 's only two things i hate : people who are intolerant of others ' vocabulary , and that word . 
  just a few days at most , iirc, 
  this has happened historically . 
  e.g. , the hungarian separatists in romania ended up fighting against the invading hungarians in wwii . 
  good one !, 
  he 's in ireland, 
  usually in my kebab games i have to avoid france . 
  at one point i narrowly avoided a coalition war with them , iberia , and italy by allying austria , muscovy , and some third major european power i ca n't be bothered to remember . 
  it 's a good point , but works of fiction have managed to have flawed female characters without making the portrayal look sexist in the past . 
  obvious solution here : make the companion someone other than a man . 
  ( how about an ai ? 
  have n't had one of those in a while . 
  god yes , that would be great if they gave the ai a unique personality . 
  female doctor \u00d7 oswin 4lyfe . ), 
  install reddit enhancement suite, 
  no , i mean that 's how you get the option . 
  res is used nearly universally , and you should get it . 
  i also think that the header should be fixed . 
  where are you from , the 16th century ? 
  scotland ? 
  a\u026a vs \u0259i i guess, 
  canadians confirmed for vikings 2.0, 
  no , but , [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet_chart_for_english_dialects ) does n't list any major dialects with the phonological characteristics you 're describing ; seems to be closest to irish though , with the exception of [ y\u0289 ] ( sic ; i 'm assuming you meant [ j\u0289 ] ) , which is more scottish or southern hemisphere than anything . 
  / r/stanisms, 
  abomination ? 
  it is the pinnacle of human achievement !, 
  how can you not appreciate what we did to that scrawny bitch teosinte ? 
  we turned it into a * god . 
  funnily enough , the only reason i thought it had anything to do with ireland was because my brain could n't let go of the similarity between `` cluster munition '' and `` munster '', 
  do n't worry guys , i summarized the guide in a neat infographic : http://i.imgur.com/dcu5ndi.jpg, 
  but , i love using that exact copypasta as a parallel text . 
  unfortunately , my calendar 's weeks start on monday . 
  me too . 
  i hate doing wcs as opms and not getting rewarded with unlocking fantastic ideas . 
  in my ongoing sulu game , i get some naval bonuses , including +20 % naval morale , but that 's not great , and i could have done the same thing with brunei . 
  this gives me a comic idea . 
  the soviet union is eating land , and grabs hungary and romania it its gluttony . 
  it squeezes them into a sandwich , but when it bites into it ... it finds that ` honhonhonhon est en fait seychelles anachronique `, 
  maybe , do n't remember . 
  brunei , though , has more total basetax , starts off with an army twice its weak and pathetic neighbor 's , probably has more provinces revealed , and is closer to eurasia and africa . 
  but someone beat that . 
  it 's not actually unwinnable , just half the screen 's obscured . 
  edit : now with a [ source ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20080229043301/http://www.oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?articleid=58&amp;entry=home ) from wikipedia,

   cohen explained that the horse tribes of the hubland steppes were born in the saddle , which rincewind considered was a gynaecological impossibility . 
  thank you !, 
  so , it was actually china 's unity that led to less military technological development ? 
  ah , yes , the great mongolic horde of indiana, 
  i 'd love to make some random opms with awesome ideas that i can carry to glory . 
  some ideas :, 
  a polynesian opm with incredible naval ideas . 
  the easternmost polynesians actually probably reached the new world .

  an unfortunate hungarian opm stuck between austria and hungary , with great defensive ideas . 
  historically , they burned down their city in the face of the ottomans . 
  that 's why the turkish name for it is `` yan\u0131k kale '' ( `` burnt city '' ) .
