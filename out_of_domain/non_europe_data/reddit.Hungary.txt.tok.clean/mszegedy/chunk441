  ### revolutionaria, 
  based on the `` reform society '' gag and the tendency for france to go multiple revolutionary , this opm starts off entirely inside france , in a low basetax province . 
  i tried to present the ideas in the opposite order that they would be useful . 
  ** government : ** revolutionary republic, 
  ** religion : ** reformed, 
  ** tech group : ** western,

  - +30 % better relations over time, 
  you are not quite an opm . 
  rather , you own sixteen provinces , all completely disjoint : two completely surrounded by poland and lithuania , two completely surrounded by france , two completely surrounded by castile , one completely surrounded by the ottomans and another bordering them , two completely surrounded by the timurids , two buried in india , two completely surrounded by ming , and two completely surrounded by the aztecs . 
  the only saving grace ? 
  many of your provinces produce gold . 
  too bad you 're animist !, 
  your capital starts in the aztecs , and , if possible all your european provinces are already part of the hre . 
  your culture is gothic .

  no way !, 
  i want to * earn * my ideas . 
  i released it !, 
  it 's in the description of the first pic . 
  when you do , make sure to take as many loans as you can and queue up as many units in their provinces as you can before you release them !, 
  this way when you play as the released vassal , you can cancel them and get mounds of money and manpower , while your overlord will be at 0 manpower , instant bankruptcy , and no money besides . 
  i got venice , austria , bohemia , and poland to support my independence at the same time . 
  [ everybody occupied a little . 
  is supporting independence a res publica thing ? 
  why do you purposely play vanilla ? 
  do you like that it 's simpler ? 
  vanilla eu4 feels too eurocentric and inflexible for me , so i 'd hate to go without the rotw expansions . 
  the conquest of paradise dlc for example was a must for me . 
  but i understand . 
  mechanics like occupation transfer , supporting independence , and upgrading ships should really be in the base game , since they 're mechanics that either save time or enable the player to do something that they did n't before , but i guess they 're what sell the dlc . 
  the most recent expansion , el dorado , though , is worth it to me for a different reason : it actually extends the variety of the gameplay . 
  not in the same way that the gimmicky expansions do ; those add flavor and depth to existing gameplay scenarios , and just make them more fun . 
  the nation designer , though , actually introduces more ways to play . 
  that 's what all expansion packs should be like , imo . 
  either that or graphical expansions , for people who are into that stuff . 
  i think this one 's actually piet mondrian,
