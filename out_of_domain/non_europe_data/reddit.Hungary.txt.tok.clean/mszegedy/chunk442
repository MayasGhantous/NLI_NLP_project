  most languages in that area have it as `` krim '' or something like that, 
  my home town , miskolc , was [ hungarian since the late 9th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miskolc#history ) , and it 's right on the edge . 
  it 's possible that paradox 's zempl\u00e9n includes the land depicted in the top right of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0wyx9ev.jpg ) picture , which was assuredly ruthenian because they do n't even bother to write how many hungarians lived there , unlike all the other ones . 
  from the other thread :, 
  i 'd love to make some random opms with awesome ideas that i can carry to glory . 
  some ideas :, 
  a polynesian opm with incredible naval ideas . 
  the easternmost polynesians actually probably reached the new world . 
  ** government : ** tribal despotism for each except maori , who get tribal federation instead, 
  ** religion : ** animism, 
  ** tech group : ** mesoamerican ( unfortunately there is no way around this , unless they introduce a shittier tech group than chinese for asia ), 
  ** traditions : **,

  - +10 % morale of armies, 
  - +25 % naval forcelimits, 
  - +1 diplomatic relations, 
  ** ambitions : **, 
  - +40 % morale of navies, 
  an unfortunate hungarian opm stuck between austria and hungary , with great defensive ideas . 
  historically , they burned down their city in the face of the ottomans . 
  that 's why the turkish name for it is `` yan\u0131k kale '' ( `` burnt city '' ) .

  - +1 land leader fire, 
  ** ambitions : **,

  ### kalmyk khanate, 
  a contingent of genghis khan 's army which settled in the northeast caucasus . 
  they became an opm from 1630 to 1771 , after which they got annexed by russia . 
  they have oirat culture . 
  nowadays part of russia , they speak the westernmost mongolic language , and are fast disappearing . 
  ** government : ** steppe nomads,

  edit : also some funny ones based on particular themes or injokes :, 
  ### revolutionaria, 
  based on the `` reform society '' gag and the tendency for france to go multiple revolutionary , this opm starts off entirely inside france , in a low basetax province . 
  i tried to present the ideas in the opposite order that they would be useful . 
  ** government : ** revolutionary republic, 
  ** religion : ** reformed, 
  ** tech group : ** western, 
  ** traditions : **, 
  - -15 % accepted culture threshold, 
  - -10 % culture-conversion cost, 
  ** ideas : **, 
  - +20 % religious unity, 
  - +2 yearly prestige ( i guess if you 've managed to survive this long , you 've earned it ), 
  - +2 tolerance of the true faith, 
  - +2 yearly legitimacy, 
  - lowered impact on stability from diplomatic actions, 
  - -1 national unrest, 
  - +1 yearly republican tradition, 
  ** ambitions : **, 
  - -20 % stability cost modifier ( reform society to your heart 's content ! ), 
  ### minghulms, 
  a crazy mix of the ming , mughals , and ulm , replacing ulm . 
  mashes together ddrjake 's minghals playthrough and the ulm meme . 
  ** government : ** celestial empire, 
  ** tech group : ** chinese, 
  ** traditions : **, 
  - +10 % yearly imperial authority, 
  - -25 % core-creation cost, 
  ** ideas : **, 
  - -10 % idea cost, 
  - +35 % religious unity, 
  - +1 diplomatic relations, 
  - +10 % production efficiency, 
  - -15 % mercenary cost, 
  ** ambitions : **, 
  - +30 % better relations over time, 
  you are not quite an opm . 
  rather , you own sixteen provinces , all completely disjoint : two completely surrounded by poland and lithuania , two completely surrounded by france , two completely surrounded by castile , one completely surrounded by the ottomans and another bordering them , two completely surrounded by the timurids , two buried in india , two completely surrounded by ming , and two completely surrounded by the aztecs .
