  the only saving grace ? 
  many of your provinces produce gold . 
  too bad you 're animist !, 
  your capital starts in the aztecs , and , if possible all your european provinces are already part of the hre . 
  your culture is gothic . 
  ** government : ** steppe nomads ( alternatively , empire ), 
  ** religion : ** animism, 
  ** tech group : ** nomad ( alternatively , mesoamerican ), 
  ** traditions : **, 
  - +20 % cavalry combat ability, 
  ** ideas : **, 
  - -10 % core creation cost, 
  - -5 % idea cost, 
  - +15 % trade steering, 
  - +20 % morale of navies ( heheheheheh ), 
  - +25 % land forcelimits, 
  - -10 % technology cost, 
  - +2 % missionary strength, 
  ** ambitions : **, 
  - +40 % religious unity, 
  is n't that basically just the papal state ? 
  the game 's too bad at describing reality in order for `` how history would have turned out '' scenarios making sense to me . 
  most of the reason that it goes broadly the way it does is mechanics that specifically make it go that way , e.g. 
  missions/events like the burgundian inheritance , expansion-punishing mechanics like overextension , and technology-restricting mechanics like tech groups . 
  i do n't think they let you do complex ideas like those ( or too overpowered ones like +20 % discipline ; not for balance , just because the counter does n't go that high ) , but here 's hoping !, 
  do n't make fun of its dialect !, 
  i 'm posting your comment to / r/badlinguistics, 
  p\u02b0\u025c\u02d1.\u02c8\u026bi\u0301\u02d0z . 
  * obviously * you were just calling attention to the fact that it was pronouncing the phoneme differently than you do . 
  otherwise you would have also included a question that clarified the origin of the bot 's idiolect . 
  what do you have to say for yourself ? 
   it 's probably the smallest international airport you 'll ever see . 
  am from not-western europe . 
  no , but , in hungary for example we have the [ p\u00e9cs-pog\u00e1ny airport ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a9cs%e2%80%93pog%c3%a1ny_rep%c3%bcl%c5%91t%c3%a9r ) , which i swear is international . 
  it 's even smaller than any i 've seen on an island . 
  which reminds me , the maldives probably has a smaller airport , judging from google maps . 
  that is exactly why i referred to europe . 
  because countries are close together . 
  so international airports do n't get as big . 
  the point was to name smaller international airports , was n't it ? 
  the purpose is to allow you to explore right away , and reach the new world immediately ( and , if you 're a min-maxer , westernize extremely early ) . 
  there is of course the drawback of making the second exploration idea useless , but the head start makes a big difference , and the drawback itself is intentional in balancing it . 
  i considered a lot of other ideas for the traditions , but ended up going with this one as the one that made the most sense . 
  i like your +1 maneuver idea better though . 
  does that actually appear in any existing national ideas ? 
   it could always be added to the exploration idea tree along with the leader availability instead - the ` wasted ' points going to increased ship capabilities while still giving them the bonus of almost immediate colonization . 
  what does this mean ? 
  it might be because of the subtractive rule needed this year . 
  although the ones before it already had xl in them . 
  oops , you 're right , i thought it was only for reading roman numerals, 
  i tried to be careful to have them be possible , or at least have them be possible outside of idea numbers . 
  what 's wrong ? 
  i know you 'd need a lot of points , but i can just set it to very easy . 
  ( the one that needs the most points is probably revolutionaria . ), 
  ah , but was p\u00e9cs ever quasi-independent ? 
  do n't think so !, 
  but you ca n't change ideas besides national ones , can you ? 
  that makes sense . 
  it varies based on what sort of sex drive you have . 
  i have to push myself to jerk off even once every couple of days . 
  damn . 
  i suppose i could just make minghulms and tartarus via cheats . 
  that 's disappointing to hear , though . 
  unless tartarus is still within the 800 point limit . 
  itt : central europeans, 
  no military access even ? 
  good luck with the generator dude , do n't listen to the haters . 
  constraint : make an independent germany a super power in a world where napoleon never invaded russia !, 
  ( i know this is silly , but go with it if you like ), 
  none of caliborn 's fantrolls listed under `` fictional characters '' . 
  disappointed, 
  they 're depicted in the thumbnail . 
  they were presented during post-hiatus homosuck, 
  oops , did n't see that . 
  thanks !, 
  what 's wrong with preserving history ? 
  nobody thinks it 's a waste of effort to build and fill museums . 
   considering trying to write a script to do so without any apparent working knowledge of gis data would literally be an exercise in reinventing the wheel . 
  what no hah . 
  i 'm lookin for a library mostly . 
  thank you for all the tools/links !, 
  i do n't have access to arcgis ( i do n't need it for research so i ca n't buy it from grant money ) , so i am currently downloading and building qgis from the git repo . 
  it will only be an auxiliary tool , though , just to help me visualize it . 
  i do not plan to manipulate the data ; a small subset of it will end up as part of the read-only data for a program i 'm writing , and the rest will get tossed out . 
  that 's why i need the python libs . 
   after you 've picked a program or format for dealing with your gis data , you can check out any one of the numerous forums or help pages for the one of your choice . 
  if you want to stay within the reddit community , you could wander over to [ r/gis ] ( / r/gis ) for some help as well . 
  atm i 'm reading the gis commons , which 'll hopefully give me an idea of how the data is structured . 
  i 'll be sure to check out / r/gis as well !, 
  well sure , but it 's still interesting to look at , and you can still notice some interesting disparities . 
  for example , the lane that timbuktu cuts through the sahara in eu4 is virtually nonexistent irl even today ; instead , there 's only a very thin spiderwed of settlements from one region to the other , and a random blob in the middle of algeria ( it does n't seem to correspond with any ecoregions or landforms ) . 
  oh my god . 
  is this ironman ? 
  if so , you can annihilate everyone with a coast !, 
  you can also win every colonial war ever . 
  seize * everything * ... the world is your oyster, 
  being a spanish speaker , you can even pronounce it greekly rather than slavicly . 
  one thing that that article gets wrong is that it equates russian x to spanish j and german ch . 
  the former articulates it in the same place as english/spanish k , and the latter two articulate it in the same place as english/spanish y. 
  they note the difference in the last paragraph , but stangely do n't remark upon it before that .
